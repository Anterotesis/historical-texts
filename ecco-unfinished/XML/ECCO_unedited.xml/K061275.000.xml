<HEAD>A
HISTORY
OF THE
CZAR of MUSCOVY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>ETER ALEXOWITZ, his present
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty; Emperor, or Caesar,
or King, or Grand Duke of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
call it which we will, whose glorious
Life and Actions are the particular
Subject of this Undertaking, was the youngest
Son, tho' at present, the only surviving Son of
the late <HI>Czar Alexis,</HI> or <HI>Alexyea Michaelowitz,</HI> his
Father left one elder Son, and one Daughter, by a
former Venture; which Daughter was living, till
about the Year 1715, and something of the Hi∣story
of both Son, and Daughter, may be briefly
understood, in their Management of Affairs.</P>
<P>THE eldest Son a weak Prince, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncapable
of any great Undertaking, was however at first
possest of the Government, and reign'd about six
Years; dying, as some have said by Poison, by
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
the instigation of some of the Trayterous <HI>Boyars,</HI>
and in Confederacy with the Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> his
Sister.</P>
<P>AFTER his Fathers Death, the present Czar <HI>Peter,</HI>
tho' <HI>Evan</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> his elder Brother was then living,
took Possession of the Government, being then on∣ly
twelve Years of Age; but afterward there was a
terrible Conspiracy, carry'd on by the General of
the <HI>Strelitz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> or standing Forces, and underhand
by the said Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> which threw the Go∣vernment
into great Covulsions, during which,
many of the Nobility, or <HI>Boyars</HI> who were in the
Interest of the Czar <HI>Peter,</HI> were Sacrificed in a
most bloody manner to the fury of the Soldiers,
and the Person of the <HI>Czar</HI> preserv'd, but with in∣finite
difficulty by Prince <HI>Gallitzen,</HI> or <HI>Golloffken,</HI>
as some write him, who snatching the young
Prince, as it were by Violence out of the Hands
of the enrag'd Soldiers, hurried him in the Night
out of the Palace, and happily secur'd him in the
Monastry of <HI>Trotski,</HI> above fifty Miles from the
Court; and then drawing together such Forces as
were at Hand, and such of the <HI>Strelitzes</HI> as con∣tinu'd
faithful, and making a kind of an Accom∣modation;
the two Princes were Proclaim'd equal
in the Government, and the Administration car∣ried
jointly in both their Names.</P>
<P>THIS kind of Government had perhaps conti∣nued
longer, had the Czar <HI>Peter</HI> been of as soft
and easy a Disposition, and as willing to be
manag'd by his Sister <HI>Sophia,</HI> as the Czar <HI>Evan</HI>
appe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd to be; but the <HI>Czar Peter</HI> appearing to
be of a manly Genius, an enterprizing gallant
Temper, and a Spirit fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted by Nature for Em∣pire.
The Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> easily foreseeing the
Termina<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of her Authority in the ripening
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Age of her younger Brother, fill'd the State with
continual Plots and Conspiracies, which at last
Ended, as such things generally do, in establishing
the Authority of the present <HI>Czar,</HI> and in her
own Ruin, as shall appear in its Place.</P>
<P>AS to the Czar, <HI>Evan</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> he dyed a∣bout
the Year 1691, and left the present Czar <HI>Pe∣ter</HI>
sole Governour of the greatest Dominion in
<HI>Europe,</HI> and in whose Reign those Dominions have
received such Additions of strength from an altera∣tion
of the Conduct of the Prince, as the like can∣not
be shewn in the History, of any Country in the
World, especially considering that it has been
generally brought to pass, without any conside∣rable
Conquest of other Princes Dominions, but
chiefly by altering the Oeconomy, the Customs,
Manners and Commerce of his own People.</P>
<P><HI>BY this Means,</HI> he has brought a Nation, who
were before the most blind and ignorant, and
the greatest contemners of Knowledge, and of all
manner of Learning, to be Searchers after Wis∣dom,
studying Sciences and eagerly bringing Home
Books, Instruments, and Artists, from the most
learned parts of the World for their Instruction.</P>
<P><HI>BT this Means,</HI> he has brought his Soldiery,
who were before the most Scoundrel undisci∣plin'd
Crowds, Rabbles, rather than Soldiers,
and just good for nothing to be regular Disci∣plined
Troops, Cloath'd, Arm'd and Paid like
other Nations, and behaving on all Occasions in
a manner sufficient to make them formidable to
those who us'd to Dispise them.</P>
<P><HI>BY this Means,</HI> he has reduc'd his People in ge∣neral,
to a legal kind of Obedience to their Go∣vernors;
not the same blind kind of Homage they
us'd to pay to their Princes, who they rather
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
worship'd than obey'd; but, a more polite Re∣gulation,
so that now the <HI>Czar</HI> endeavours to
convince their Reason, of the real Advantages
which his new Laws are to them, at the same time
that he exacts their Obedience.</P>
<P><HI>BY this Means,</HI> he has regulated their Com∣merce,
shew'd them the Profit of a vast Expor∣tation
of their own Product to other Countries,
and of the Importation of the Product of other
Countries to them; by which their Wealth daily
encreases, their People who before had little
Business, now begin to get Employment, and their
Lands encrease in Value.</P>
<P><HI>BY this Means,</HI> he has brought his People to be
acquainted with the Sea, and they who had be∣fore
scarce a Ship of any Consequence, either for
Trade or War in the World, are now able to ap∣pear
in the <HI>Balti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> with a Royal Naval of near
30 Men of War of the Line, Six and Twenty Fre∣gat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,
and 300 Galleys, such they had in their
great Expedition against <HI>Sweden,</HI> in the Year 1719,
besides Transport Ships, and on board of all,
which as I have been inform'd were employ'd 18000
Seamen, besides Soldiers, which Fleet are since ve∣ry
much encreas'd, as shall be shewn it its Place.</P>
<P>THE former part of this Princes Reign, was
taken up, either in the Quieting the intestine
Troubles of his Subjects, the Factions of his Cour∣tiers,
and the Rebellions, and Conspiracies of the
Nobility and Soldiery, who were continually
rendred Unquiet, and Uneasie to him, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Conspira<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of his Sister, the Princess <HI>So∣phia,</HI>
and her Creatu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, OR in reducing the en∣croa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing
<HI>Tartars,</HI> on the side of <HI>Astra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an,</HI> and
the Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Circ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assia,</HI> who several times gave
him great Disturbance, ravag'd the Country, and
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
carried off great Numbers of his People into Sla∣very;
but in all his Encounters with these Peo∣ple,
he was follow'd with a Series of continual
Success, his Rebels were every where not only
Conquer'd, but entirely Subdu'd, and almost uni∣versally
fell into his Hands, and so were either cut
off by the Hand of the Executioner, in which
Cases, tho' the Severities us'd were terrible, yet
they were no other than the Custom of the Coun∣try
made lawful; or else, were banish'd to <HI>Siberia,</HI>
where they are at full Liberty, and yet rendred
entirely uncapable of ever returning to disturb
the Government.</P>
<P>THE utter impossibility of any Persons, ex∣cept
such as are at the Head of every Action, gi∣ving
any Account of things in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> where no
Records are kept, or History written of publick
things, makes it not to be expected that I should
be able to give Journals of the March of Armies,
and exact Accounts of the several Expeditions of his
Czarish Majesty to the Southern part of his Do∣minions,
either against his own Rebellious <HI>Circassi∣ans,</HI>
the <HI>Calmuck Tartars,</HI> or any other, except
such as those, the Accounts of which we have from
the History of the other Countries he was engag'd
with, of which I shall give as full an Account as
the best Intelligence of those times will permit.</P>
<P>THE enterprizing Genius of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and
his early attempts to put his Empire in a posture
of Defence against the Potent Neighbours who
surrounded it, was not at all agreeable to the com∣mon
Notions of the <HI>Muscovites;</HI> Building Ships of
War, Entertaining Foreign Artists and Engineers,
and laving Schemes according to the Manner of
the other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> whose way of making
War is so eminently improv'd, were all things
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
disagreeable to them, who as they had no Know∣ledge
of Arts and Sciences, no Mathematical un∣derstandings,
or Sense of Improvement, so they Ha∣ted
and Dispised all those who knew more than
themselves.</P>
<P>NAY, so eminently were they carryed out in
the Esteem of their own Ignorance, that they
made it a Point of Religion, and thought it a
breach of the Laws of God to mingle their Cu∣stoms
with those of other Nations, or to bring
the Usage of Foreigners among them; as if Wis∣dom
and Knowledge were not to be search'd af∣ter
to the Ends of the Earth, and it were no
loss to them to be the most blind, and uninform'd
Nation in the World.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Czar</HI> saw with other Eyes; it was
easy to him who had a Penetrating Judgement,
and a Mathematical Head, tho' uninform'd by
the Knowledge of Art, to be sensible of the want
of it; and when he saw the readiness of Foreign
Artists, how they acted their Part by Scale and
Rule, and had a whole System of things in their
Heads, there needed no more for a Prince thus a∣ble
to see the Defect of his own People, and the
Advantage which Neighbouring Nations had o∣ver
them on that account; I say there needed no
more than a Sense of this, to cause him to resolve
upon a general Application to the great Work of
informing himself, and by degrees his People also in
the useful Knowledge which flourish'd among the
other Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> and to bring them to
receive such Notions, and such Customs as might in
time render them equal to their Neighbours: If any
Man were to have a true Account of the former
obstinate Ignorance of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Nation;
how they dispis'd and refus'd all Information,
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
how they made it Criminal to suffer any of their
People to travel Abroad, much less to pretend to
bring Home any experimental Knowledge, or a∣ny
Customs, however good in themselves, from
other Nations; one wou'd first wonder how the
<HI>Czar</HI> came, as it were alone, among his whole Na∣tion,
to resolve upon being better inform'd; and
much more how he has been able to Conquer the
obstinate Ignorance of his People.</P>
<P>NOT that he has Effectually done it yet, or per∣haps
ever will; and if his late Son, the Prince of
<HI>Muscovy</HI> had liv'd, 'tis certain he had so little
Tast of those things, tho' he had been Abroad,
that he would have unravell'd all that his Father
had done, and brought the Nation back to their
Native stupidity again.</P>
<P>BUT that obstacle is remov'd, and so are many
other; the <HI>Czar</HI> lives still, and proceeds to
bring all the <HI>European</HI> Customs and Usages into
Fashion with his People; and in a few Years
more it may happen, that there will be so many
Men of Learning and Judgement found in <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
that they will never return again to the bru∣tal
Life, which they formerly led; especially, if
the Successor to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty should hap∣pen
to be some <HI>German</HI> Prince, who may Marry
his Daughter, or that the present Heir apparent
should live to have a foreign and learn'd Education.</P>
<P>IT has been said, that this insight which the
<HI>Czar</HI> had so early receiv'd, into the Deficiency of
his Countries Customs, and the Impressions
of his own Ignorance, in those things, which
a Prince ought to know, were first formed by
Conversing early with one Monsieur <HI>Le Fort</HI> a
<HI>French</HI> Gentleman, of excellent Parts and Learn∣ing,
who he had Entertain'd in his Court, while
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
he (the <HI>Czar</HI>) was very young, and whose Con∣versation
he was extremely Fond of: That
this Gentleman first exited him to Great and He∣roick
Actions, fill'd his Mind with generous and
gallant Principles, and at last recommended to
him to take that happy step of Travelling in∣cognito
thro' all the polite Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that
there he might see whether what he <HI>Le Fort</HI> had
intimated to him of the exquisite Management
of things in other Countries were true or not; and
that he might from thence return furnish'd with
Knowledge of all things relating to Peace, War and
Government, and make himself Master of what
ever was Necessary to make him truly Great, and
so be in time an equal Match for his (at present)
more powerful Neighbours.</P>
<P>IT is the hardest thing in the Worlds for Man
to be Convinc'd of his own Defects, and till he is
so Convinc'd, 'tis impossible to make him apply to Improvement; for who submits to be taught
what he believes himself to know enough of.</P>
<Q><L>If Fools could their own Ignorance discern,</L>
<L>They'd be no longer Fools, because they'd Learn.</L></Q>
<P>BUT here was a Prince arriv'd to the Perfe∣ction
of Knowledge, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to know that he knew
nothing; and from this original Sense of his own,
and of his Peoples Deficiency, he first resolv'd to
Travel, that he might Learn every thing, and
then return to be the general Teacher of his own People.</P>
<P>HAPPY Humillity! he Travel'd in quest of
Knowledge, that he might be qualified to be the
Great School-Master of his Subjects; and we shall
soon see the Success in a Manner, such as the
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
whole World can show not One Example of the
like.</P>
<P>BUT to return to his other Enterprizes, before the
great Undertaking of all, which takes up so much
Room in all the Histories of the Age. The first
of his Undertakings was the reduction of the
<HI>Circassian Tartars,</HI> who in the infancy of this
Reign had Revolted, or rather made War against
the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> had pass'd the <HI>Wolga,</HI> and seiz'd upon
<HI>Astra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an,</HI> where they committed unheard of Cru∣elties,
and Barbarities upon the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army was not in this War Com∣manded
by the <HI>Czar</HI> in Person, but by his Fa∣vourite
Prince <HI>Gollofkin,</HI> and under him by some
foreign Officers, who carried on the War at first
with Success, but made no great Progress till the
<HI>Czar</HI> coming in Person with some additional
Troops, push'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> with such Vigour, and
used his Victrory so effectually, that he brought
the whole Country of <HI>Circassia</HI> to his Obedience:
And some of his Troops Ravaged the <HI>Crimmee,</HI>
and struck a Terror even into the several other
Nations of <HI>Tartars,</HI> up to the Borders of the
<HI>Boristhenes.</HI></P>
<P>THIS War brought on another of more
Weight, and indeed of more Danger, and that
was a War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> which it must be con∣fess'd,
the <HI>Czar</HI> shew'd his Pollicy in adven∣turing
upon at that Time; because the <HI>Turks</HI> were
just then Embarrass'd in a War with the Emperor
of <HI>Germany,</HI> the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the State,
or Common-wealth or <HI>Venice</HI> all together; so that
they were in no Condition to send any Number
of Men to make their Arms formidable to the <HI>Czar.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
UNDER these fair Prospects, the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Muscovy</HI> broke with the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Year, 1694,
and then follow'd a Series of Successes, which rais'd
the Fame of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Arms above what they
ever reach'd before; but especially, gave the
World a taste of the personal Valour and Conduct
of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, of whom they had heard
very little till now.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Tartars</HI> who had so long been the Terror
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> were miserably Defeated by the <HI>Mus∣covite</HI>
Army in Three very considerale Actions;
of which however, Intelligence coming very slow
and uncertain from Places so Remote, and from
Nations who held so little Correspondence with
the rest of the World; we had no particular Ac∣count
till some Years after, when we were be∣holding
to the Relations given of them from the
Memory of some <HI>Scots</HI> Officers who serv'd in the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Army.</P>
<P>THE first thing done in this War, was to clear
the eastern Banks of the <HI>Wolga</HI> from the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
and drive them effectually into their own Bounds.</P>
<P>THIS had in part been done before, when
Prince <HI>Gollofkin</HI> the Elder, had recovered <HI>Astra∣can</HI>
from them. But they still remain'd in great
Numbers on the Calmuck side, and frequently
made Incursions into the Countries possess'd by
the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and Ravag'd far and near, accord∣ing
to their usual Method, making an inexpressi∣ble
Desolation wherever they came.</P>
<P>THE first Troops the <HI>Czar</HI> sent this way upon
his new Scheme of this War, effectually drove the
<HI>Calmuck Tartars</HI> over the <HI>Wolga;</HI> at the same
time the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> such of them as were Subject to
the <HI>Czar,</HI> had fallen upon a great Body of the
<HI>Crim-Tartars,</HI> who had made an Attempt to fall
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
into the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Dominions on the side of <HI>Circassia,</HI>
and gave them a great Defeat, killing 15000 of
them upon the Spot.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, the <HI>Czar</HI>'s General <HI>Gordon</HI> a
<HI>Scots</HI> Gentleman, and an Officer of great Experi∣ence
entered into <HI>Circassia</HI> itself, and after giving
the <HI>Tartars</HI> several Defeats, reduced that whole
Country under the Obedience of the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Government, as it remains to this Day.</P>
<P>IT should have been observ'd here, that tho'
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Militia were not yet brought to the
happy Regulation and Discipline, they are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince
by the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Application and Management
arriv'd to; yet they had been much Improv'd,
and were in a much better Condition than they
had formerly been in; and this by the Manage∣ment
and Direction of the late Czar <HI>Alexis Mi∣chaelowitz,</HI>
the present <HI>Czar</HI>'s Father, who indeed
began to alter several things in the former un∣polish'd
Method of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Government;
and particularly that of the Army; and remark∣ably
in this, that he resolv'd to introduce the
<HI>German</HI> Military Discipline among his Troops;
and to have the Soldiers taught the Exercise for
the handling their Arms, Marching, Counter∣Marching,
Wheeling, drawing up, Forming and
Embattleing, &amp;c. after the <HI>German</HI> Manner. And
to this purpose, he Entertain'd a great Number of
foreign Officers in his Army, who he Encourag'd
to come out of the Service of all the Princes near
him, by Promises of large Pay and good Usage,
with Preferments according to their Merit, and
which Terms they found very punctually Com∣ply'd
with; and his Son the present <HI>Czar</HI> persu∣ed
the same Method.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
BY this means he had at the time of his Un∣dertaking
the War I am now speaking of, two
Generals (viz.) <HI>Monsieur le Fort,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gordon,</HI>
the first a <HI>French</HI> Man, the second a <HI>Scots</HI> Man,
and above 3000 inferior Officers of several Na∣tions
in his Pay, besides Engineers, Cannoniers,
Bombardiers, and Firemen in abundance.</P>
<P>AND this was the great Reason why his En∣terprizes
in this War were carry'd on with great
Regularity; his Sieges managed, and Trenches
open'd according to Art; his Batteries, Mines,
Attacks &amp;c. well serv'd; and every thing done
as it ought to be done. Things which in former
Times the <HI>Muscovites</HI> knew little of.</P>
<P>I am oblig'd to pass over the first Actions of
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Generals in this War, in a
summary Method, not being able to come at the
particular Days of the Month, or the particular
Circumstances of every Action, nor any Diary
of the March of the Armies, in a time when as
before, scarce any thing was done with that Re∣gularity,
which has been usual in such Cases in
other Countries, and which has since been better
Manag'd there: Besides, this was a kind of a
Tumultuary War, the <HI>Tartars</HI> being a People
that made only a kind of <HI>Camp Volant</HI> in all their
Marchings; and in every thing they did, it might
be only said, that it was by way of Excursion, and
Incursion; Plundering and Burning, when they
Advanced, and Runing or rather Flying, when
they Return'd; so that they were only to be Fought,
with by the way of Intercepting them, and by
Surprize; and when at any time they were brought
to Fight, it could never be call'd a pitch'd Battle,
but rather a runing Fight, their whole Army be∣ing
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
always on Horseback, for as to an Infantry,
they know nothing of them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as the <HI>Cossacks</HI> were likewise
Horse, tho' not so well Mounted, they, often met
with and routed the <HI>Tartars</HI> too; and that ra∣ther,
because the most Soldiery part of the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI>
were at that time Engag'd against the <HI>Po∣landers,</HI>
or in <HI>Hungary,</HI> against the Imperial Ar∣mies,
in Conjunction with the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to come back to the Person and Conduct
of the <HI>Czar,</HI> it was in persuit of his Conquests on
this side, that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty found how fair
a way lay open to him to make himself Power∣ful
by Sea; a thing which had long lain upon his
Thoughts, but which till now he never had so
much as room to find feazible, or indeed possi∣ble;
having no Out-let into any Sea where his
Power might exert itself: As to the <HI>Wolga,</HI>
tho' it be a very great River, and of a prodigious
extended Course, having run above 2500 Miles,
including the Windings and Reaches of its Course,
yet there is no depth of Water in the Channel at
the Mouth or Influx of it into the Sea; but the
Sands and Flats of the Shore in the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea on
the <HI>Russian</HI> side choking up the River, makes it un∣capable
to carry Ships of any Force, except at
the time of the Winter Floods; and even then,
the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea itself for some Leagues, has no
depth of Water answerable for a Royal Navy of
Men of War, such as the <HI>Czar</HI> had Projected to
Build.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, had the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea been
deep and every where Navigable as wou'd be suf∣ficient,
yet this respected only the Shores of <HI>Per∣sia,
Armenia, Georgia,</HI> and those Countries, which
rendered the <HI>Czar</HI> no Prospect of Glory, or Con∣quest.
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
But his Designs lay another way, that is
to say, to open to himself a Navigation into the
<HI>Black</HI> Sea, where he might either extend his Con∣quest
or his Commerce, or perhaps both, into the
lesser <HI>Asia,</HI> and even to the Gates of <HI>Constanti∣nople;</HI>
and either by Force or by Treaty, might
obtain a Passage thro' the Straits of <HI>Hellespont,</HI>
and the <HI>Thracian Bosphorns</HI> into the Mediterrane∣an
Sea, and so might establish an open Trade be∣tween
his Country and the Ports of <HI>Italy, France,</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> and consequently with all the known World.</P>
<P>THIS open'd a Scene of Glory fit for a Prince,
and suited to the great Enterprizes which his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had formed in his Mind: In a
word, here was a Field of Action large enough
to gratifie the Ambition of a Sovereign, Born for
great Things, and who possessing an Empire Su∣perior
to any of his Neighbours, wanted nothing
but an Entrance upon the Stage of Greatness, that
he might Act like himelf.</P>
<P>HE saw at once all the great Things which
might be the Consequence of this Conquest in many
Ages to come; and it was from this Judgment
that he had made of Things, that he had purposed
to Build a large Fleet of Men of War, even while
the World stood Amaz'd at the Mystery of it; see∣ing
they were Built many Leagues up the Coun∣try,
on the bank of a River, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The <HI>Don</HI> or <HI>Ta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is,</HI>
whose Out-let into the Sea was not in his
Possession, but Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck'd up by the <HI>Turks</HI> with in∣numerable
Obstacles; such as strong Fortrcsses,
narrow Straits, great Batteries, Ships of War, and
the like, particularly, the City and Forts at
<HI>Asoph,</HI> the Lines at the Mouth of the River <HI>Don,</HI>
and Works at the Straits of <HI>Caffa,</HI> which last is,
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
the only Entrance into the <HI>Black</HI> Sea, out of that
Sea call'd the <HI>Palus Meotis.</HI></P>
<P>BUT his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's designs were not to
be Diverted with the Prospect of those Difficul∣ties;
and therefore even before he seem'd to aim
at opening the Passage of those Places, or Enga∣ging
in any War to bring it to pass, he employ'd
Agents into <HI>Holland,</HI> and into <HI>England,</HI> to furnish
him with experienc'd Ship-Wrights, and Builders,
in order to build a Royal Navy of Men of War,
even when no Body could foresee in what Part of
the World they should be Employ'd; his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty having then not one Port in the <HI>Baltick</HI>
Sea, the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea, or any where else, except
that of <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> opening to the North Seas, in
the Latitude 72 degrees, where he could have no
occasion to use them.</P>
<P>BUT the Event soon discover'd the Sagacity
of the Design, for the same Year the <HI>Czar</HI> having
before been long Solicited by the Confederates,
came into the War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> which was
solemnly proclaim'd the twentieth, of <HI>February,</HI>
1694.</P>
<P>IN pursuance of this War, and of the Mea∣sures
concerted with the Allies, the <HI>Czar</HI> appear'd
with two Armies in the Field, the beginning of
the Year 1695, the one consisting of 90000 Foot,
and 20000 Horse and Dragoons, Commanded by
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty in Person, and with which he
march'd into the <HI>Russian Circassia,</HI> and entering the
<HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions, sat down before <HI>Asoph,</HI> an im∣portant
Fortress upon the Banks of the <HI>Tanais,</HI>
near the Mouth of that great River, where it em∣pties
itself into the great Lake, or Sea call'd the
<HI>Palus Meotis;</HI> and the other Army consisting of
24000 Foot and 36000 Horse, the latter being
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
all <HI>Coassacks,</HI> and was therefore call'd the <HI>Cossack
Army,</HI> Commanded by Lieutenant General Prince
<HI>Czeremetoff,</HI> of whom we shall often have occasi∣on
to speak hereafter in the Course of this Hi∣story.
This Army march'd by the Way of the
<HI>Ukraine,</HI> and keeping the Course of the great Ri∣ver
<HI>Boristhenes,</HI> or the <HI>Neiper</HI> to the Mouth of the
said River, sat down before the strong Town of
<HI>Kasilkermeen,</HI> a <HI>Tartarian</HI> City, Situated on the
South Bank of the said River <HI>Neiper,</HI> and within
two Leagues or thereabouts of the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Towns were equally considerable, as
Situated at the two great Enterances into the <HI>Pontus
Euxinus,</HI> nearest to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's▪ Domi∣nions;
and most conveniently Seated, both to fa∣cilitate
his Designs for the Commerce of his Sub∣jects
in those Seas, and equally Advantageous to
him for carrying on his farther Design against the
<HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Christian World were agreeable sur∣pris'd
at the <HI>Czar</HI>'s breaking with the <HI>Turks</HI> in a
Juncture so very Momentous, and so Seasonable
to the Confederates, they were even amaz'd to
find a Prince, of whose enterprising Genius they
had yet form'd no Notions, begin a War with such
apparent Proofs, both of an exquisite Fore∣knowledge,
and also of a perfect Understanding
of the Weight and Consequence of what he had
Undertaken; on the other Hand, the manner of
his Entrance into this War, and the formidable
Power with which he began it, gave the <HI>Turks</HI> a
terrible Alarm, especially considering how their
Affairs were at that time Embarass'd in a heavy
War with the Emperor, the King of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> all at the same time, and
in which they had receiv'd several terrible Over∣throws,
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
and had already lost almost all the King
of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> all the <HI>Morea,</HI> and several conside∣rable
Fortresses in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and other Places, be∣sides
having their Millitary Power, broken both
at Sea and Land, by innumerable Defeats of their
Armies and Fleets; but we shall see them farther
Alarm'd in the process of this War, by the Success
of his Czarish Majesty in the Prosecution of
it.</P>
<P>IT was now too late, that the <HI>Turks</HI> saw their
Mistake, in that having for many Years the City
of <HI>Asoph,</HI> in their Possession, if they had consi∣der'd
it as one of the most important Frontiers
of their whole Empire, they would have made it
as impregnable, as the Consequences of such a
Place requir'd, and as the Situation of it very
well allow'd; for it was most advantageously Si∣tuated
on the North Bank of the River <HI>Don,</HI> with
a low Marshy Ground opposite to it, which was
capable of being so Fortify'd, as appear'd after∣wards,
and to be so surrounded with Water, as
not to be any way attack'd, otherwise than by a
Bombardment, or to be taken, but by a strict
Blockade.</P>
<P>ALL that the <HI>Turks</HI> could do, upon the sudden
approach of the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Army, was, to supply the
Want, or Weakness of the Fortifications, with a
bold resolute Garrison of ten thousand <HI>Janisaries,</HI>
all old Soldiers; besides <HI>Tartars;</HI> and under chosen
Officers, well furnish'd with all things for a vigo∣rous
Defence; and this they plac'd the more Confi∣dence
in, by how much they had the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
still in the utmost Contempt, as to their Military
Capacity of attacking such a Place.</P>
<P>NOR did the Garrison disappoint their Masters,
or fail in doing their Duty, and in such manner,
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
that altho' the <HI>Czar</HI> attack'd the Place in Form,
and that his Engineers made their Approaches
with the utmost Skill, and Batter'd and Bombard∣ed
the Place with a 100 Pieces of Cannon, and 40
Mortars; yet the Garrison so Harrass'd them with
Continu'd bold and desperate Sallies, and so ply'd
them with a numerous Artillery from the Walls, so
often levell'd the Trenches of the Besiegers, Nail'd
their Cannon, and ruin'd their Works; that the
Winter coming on, and Provisions growing Scarce,
the <HI>Czar</HI> tho' he was in Person at the Siege, was
oblig'd to give it over, after having lost as some
have reported above 30000 Men before the Place,
and half ruin'd his Calvalry for want of Fo∣rage.</P>
<P>BUT Prince <HI>Czeremetoff</HI> had better luck be∣fore
<HI>Kasikermeen,</HI> which tho' it was better Forti∣fy'd,
was not so well Defended; and the <HI>Cossacks</HI>
pushing on their Attacks with a desperate Fury,
they carried the Place Sword in Hand, the Gar∣rison
having but just time to retreat into two large
Forts, which cover'd the City on the side of the
River, where beating a Parley, they had good
Conditions granted by the Besiegers, and so the
whole City was taken.</P>
<P>THERE was a complaint made against the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> General Prince <HI>Czeremetoff,</HI> for suffer∣ing
the <HI>Cossacks</HI> to Plunder the Garrison after the
Capitulation was Sign'd; and that Princes Dis∣grace
happening soon after, was assign'd to that
Cause; but I do not take upon me to say, this
was the Cause of it, and as that Prince has been
receiv'd into his Masters Favour since, that, with
very great Reputation, 'tis generally suppos'd,
that he acquitted himself of that Accusation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20"/>
IF the <HI>Turks</HI> committed an Over-sight an their,
not fore-seeing the Importance, <HI>and Fortifying in
time the City</HI> of <HI>Asoph,</HI> they were now guilty of
the greatest and most inexcusable Neglect and O∣mission,
in not taking the opportunity of the Win∣ter,
when the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Troops were with-drawn, to
send a powerful Succour to the Garrison, that they
might have Defended the Place another Year, as
they had done the Year before.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> left a Body
of Forces in the Country, who as it were, effect∣ually
Block'd up the Place by Land; and the
<HI>Turks</HI> neither supplyed the Magazines with Provi∣sions,
or reinforced the Garrison with fresh Troops;
both which it was very easie to have done by Sea;
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> having then no Naval Strength at
all: Of both these there was an absolute Necessi∣ty,
for the Magazines were not only Empty, the
Ammunition being extremely lessen'd in the fre∣quent
Sallies and continued Fireings during so
long a Defence, as that of the last Siege, but the
Garrison was reduced from ten Thousand, to two
Thousand eight Hundred Men.</P>
<P>IN this distress'd Condition, they were oblig'd
to sustain the second Siege, having long sollicited
for Succours but in vain, till it was too late to re∣ceive
them, as will appear in the Sequel of the
Story.</P>
<P>DURING the Winter, the <HI>Czar</HI> was not Idle;
the prodigious Preparations made in all Parts of
his vast Dominions, for Recruiting his Army,
Remounting his Cavalry, and supplying the Ma∣gazines
with all necessary Stores of Ammunition,
&amp;c. Intimated plainly, that the Attempt upon
<HI>Asoph</HI> was not laid aside; but that which was
most considerable of all, was the Expedition
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
with which his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty furnish'd himself
with a Fleet in one Winter; and that odd and
extravagant Manner in which some of the Vessels
were Built, several of them having been Built
in the River <HI>Occa,</HI> and carried over Land to the
<HI>Dona,</HI> and most of the rest at <HI>Voranowitz,</HI> a
Town on a River of that Name, which emplies
itself into the <HI>Dona</HI> above 300 Miles above <HI>A∣soph.</HI></P>
<P>THE Detachment of Troops which the <HI>Czar</HI>
had left to Block up the Place during the Winter,
had maintain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d their Posts upon the Neighbouring
Hills, and so well scour'd the Country, that the
Garrison of <HI>Asoph</HI> had no opportunity of reccive∣ing
any Relief or Supply by Land; and early in
the Spring the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Troops began to arrive,
so that they were actually Besieg'd again, before
they had received the least Recruit.</P>
<P>THE Preparations for this second Attack, were
so much greater than those of the first Siege, that
the Garrison had much more need to have been
doubled than lessen'd, the Violence they had to
sustain, being so much the greater; for the Artil∣lery
the <HI>Czar</HI> had prepar'd for this Attack, were
400 Pieces of Cannon, and 150 Mortars.</P>
<P>THE Expedition us'd in all these Preparations
was such, that the Body of the Army arriv'd be∣fore
<HI>Asoph,</HI> in the End of <HI>April;</HI> but the Rivers
not being open for bringing the Vessels loaden
with Artillery, Bombs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for the Ships
from <HI>Veranowitz,</HI> till the middle of <HI>May,</HI> it was
the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> before the Siege was actu∣ally
form'd; all which time the <HI>Turks</HI> had fairly
before them to have relieved the Place; which
however, as if an Ill-fate attended them, they o∣mitted
till about the middle of <HI>July,</HI> when their
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
Squadron began to appear in the <HI>Black</HI> Sea, and
when they found to their Cost that they were too
late, as we shall see presently.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> came in Person to his Army the be∣ginning
of <HI>May,</HI> and the Siege begun with the
utmost Vigour; the Garrison, tho' extreamly re∣duced,
and in want of many things, yet defended
themselves with a desperate Valour, rejecting the
Summons sent them in his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Name,
by General <HI>Gordon,</HI> with offers of an honourable
Capitulation, and another Summons after that,
threatening them that they should have no Quar∣ter,
if they were taken by Storm.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Muscovite</HI> General <HI>Gordon</HI> found that the
Ground did not admit of Carrying on Trenches,
so well as could be wish'd, and the Garrison ha∣ving
near 300 Pieces of Cannon upon their Works,
made such a continual Fire, as ruin'd the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Batteries; for the said Batteries being made of a
loose Sandy Earrh, which would not bear the Weight
of the Artillery. When the Shot of the Town had
but beaten them a little in the Front they fell down;
so that the Guns were dismounted by the Enemy,
with the greatest ease immaginable: Upon this, the
said General <HI>Gordon</HI> undertook to carry on a rol∣ling
Trench, or rather a rolling Parapet, which
by the help of a multitude of Hands, and near
six Weeks labour, he brought to such perfection,
that it terrify'd the Besieged more than all the
Bombs and Cannon in the Army.</P>
<P>THIS Work was begun at a good distance
from the Place, and as there were above 30000
Men continually employ'd in it, who reliev'd one
another every four Hours, the Work came gra∣dually
rowling forward, the Men behind it still
throwing the Sandy Earth from the bottom, up
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
to one another upon Stages, till the uppermost
threw it quite over the Top, so that at last they
brought it within half a Musquet Shot of the
Town, and the height so great, that it overlook'd
the highest part of the Wall, and all the Bastions,
to the great astonishment of the Besieg'd.</P>
<P>DURING all this time, the Batteries for Mor∣tars,
which were so effectually cover'd from the
shot of the Ramparts, play'd so incessantly upon
the Town, throwing Bombs Night and Day;
that the whole Town was reduc'd to Ashes, and
the Garrison continually Harrass'd with the fury
of the Bombs, no Place being secure for them; nor
could they appear upon their Works, but they
were immediately knock'd down with small shot
from the Top of the rowling Trench, which over∣look'd
them like a big Mountain, commanding
the Town!: While this was doing from the Land∣side,
the <HI>Czar,</HI> who took upon himself, the Di∣rection
of the naval Part in particular, brought
his Gallies down by a different Channel of the
River <HI>Don,</HI> which as it was out of the reach of the
Cannon of the Town; so there was so little depth
of Water in that part of the River, that no Ves∣sel
of bulk were ever known to pass that Way
before, except in Cases of great Freshes, or Land
Floods, which were all now over and gone.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Czar</HI> appear'd with a Fleet of Gal∣lies
below the Town, to the astonishment of the
Besieged, who believ'd it impossible they should
pass any way, but in the Mouth of their Guns,
which would have been altogether impracticable,
there being above 150 Pieces of Cannon mounted
to defend the Passage.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
BESIDES this, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty caused se∣veral
Batteries of Cannon to be Planted on the
other side of the River <HI>Donn,</HI> on a small Island,
which is very properly Situated to prevent Suc∣cours
from coming to Relieve the Place; and
behind this Island he placed all his Arm'd Sha∣loups
and Brigantines, as in an Ambuscade, to be
ready to show themselves as occasion shou'd present.</P>
<P>IN this posture, both the Besiegers and the Be∣sieged
expected the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet, which at length
appear'd, bringing Succours for the Garrison;
the Fleet consisted of 12 large Gallies, 30 arm'd
Brigantines, and about 60 Transport Vessels, ha∣ving
on Board 8000 Soldiers to Reinforce the
Garrison, a vast Quantity of Ammunition of all
sorts, Stores of Provision, and Cloths for the
Garrison, and 50000 Ducates in Money for the pay
and Encouragement of the brave Fellows, who had
so well behav'd themselves as above.</P>
<P>IT was about the 24th of <HI>July,</HI> that they ap∣pear'd
in the <HI>Palus Meotis,</HI> standing in among the
Islands in the Mouth of the <HI>Donn,</HI> so to enter the
Place; the first thing they had to Encounter, was
the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Gallies, who drawing less Water than
the Great Gallies of the <HI>Turks</HI> lay farther up the
River, where the other could not come.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the <HI>Turkish</HI> Saicks and Bri∣gantines
to shun those Gallies, kept among the
said Islands in shoal Water, which the <HI>Czar</HI> per∣ceiving,
he took a sufficient Number of Troops
into his Shalloups and Brigantines, and resolv'd
to Attack them where they lay, which they did
with such Bravery and Success, himself ap∣pearing
in Person in the hottest of the Action,
that the <HI>Turks</HI> were entirely Defeated and Di∣spers'd,
and the whole Convoy of Provisions,
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> taken even sight of the Gar∣rison,
not one Vessel being able to reach the
Town.</P>
<P>THIS Overthrow of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet, with the
Succours was follow'd with the Surrender of the
Town; the Garrison Capitulating the 28th of <HI>Ju∣ly,</HI>
the <HI>Czar</HI> granting them very honourable Con∣ditions,
in Consideration of that Bravery they had
shewn in Defence of the Place: It was said, that
when they Surrendred, there was not above 1300
whole Men left of them, who were upwards of
12000 at the beginning of the Siege.</P>
<P>THIS glorious Victory of the <HI>Czar's</HI> surpris'd all
<HI>Europe,</HI> and fill'd every Bodies Mouth with the Per∣sonal
Fame of his Cazrish Majesty's Valour and Con∣duct,
which was the more talk'd of, because it had not
been often, that the World had heard of the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
good Conduct, much less of a Warlike Emperor
at their Head: On this Account and that I may be sure
to leave a full Account of this great Action, I shall
give it in the very Words, in which it was publish'd
to the World in the several Countries, from whence
we had then an Account of it; <HI>For Example;</HI> one
Account, and back'd with good Authority, which
came by the way of <HI>France,</HI> is as follows.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty having before-hand re∣ceiv'd
Intelligence of the approach of this Suc∣cour,
had caus'd seven of his largest Gallies of a
hundred Foot in Length each, besides several lesser,
and a great Number of Brigantines to pass into
that small Branch of the <HI>Don,</HI> which issues forth
a little above the Town. As the Water is very
Shallow in this <HI>Channel,</HI> so it was not without a
great deal of difficulty, that the largest Gallies
could be brought along that Way, and would in
all likelihood not have succeeded, if the <HI>Czar</HI> by his
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
Presence and Encouragement, had not animated
the Workmen to surpass all the Difficulties, which
at last they did, to the no small Astonishment of
the Besieged.</P>
<P>THIS Obstacle being happily surmounted, his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty judg'd it of very great Consequence,
for his purpose to plant good Store of Cannon up∣on
the little Island we have mention'd before,
because the Shoar being very Low, the Cannon-ball
would strike even with the Surface of the Water;
besides that the greatest part of the Isle being
cover'd with Wood, did prevent the Enemy from
discovering the Design.</P>
<P>THE same favourable Disposition of this Island,
furnish'd the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> with an opportunity of
putting some of their lightest Gallies and Brigan∣tines
for a Reserve behind the Isle unperceiv'd by
the Enemy, whom they intended thus to attack
both in the Front and Flank as they passed by that
Way, which succeeded according to Expectation.</P>
<P>FOR all these Precautions having been made
before, when the Enemies Fleet came in sight, the
biggest <HI>Muscovite</HI> Gallies, with many Brigantines
were sent out to meet them, making a show as if
they intended to Engage the <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet; but
no sooner were they come within Cannon-Shot of
one another, but the <HI>Muscovites</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eigning to dread
the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Fleet, as superiour to them in Num∣ber,
made a running Fight, making the best of
their way towards the Shoar, and posting them∣selves
below the Island: The <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving the
Enemy to fly before them, and not in the least fore∣warn'd
of that Plot laid behind the Island, thought
themselves, by the small Number of the <HI>Musco∣vite</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
Gallies that appear'd in Sight, assur'd of the
Victory.</P>
<P>FLUSH'D with these Hopes, they made all
the Sail they could to fall in among the <HI>Musco∣vites,</HI>
but no sooner were they come within reach
of the Cannon from the Isle, but they receiv'd such
a warm salute from thence, that they saw their
Gallies torn to pieces on all sides, by the Enemies
Cannon in an Instant, with a great Slaughter of
many of their Men; but this was only the Fore∣runner
of what was to ensue.</P>
<P>FOR his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, who had a watchful
Eye on all Sides, and who was sometimes upon the
Isle, sometimes on Board the Fleet of Reserve
that lay behind; having soon observed the Con∣sternation
the <HI>Turks</HI> were put in by this unexpect∣ed
Salute, and willing to improve their Confusi∣on
to his Advantage, got on Board in Person one
of the lightest Gallies, Mann'd only with forty
Men, giving the Signal for the rest to follow him,
with all the Oars they could. Thus the Enemy
found themselves surrounded on all Sides by the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> who Attack'd them with great Brave∣ry;
the <HI>Czar</HI> himself Boarding the <HI>Turkish</HI> Admi∣ral,
and being successfully Seconded by the rest,
the Victory was almost as soon compleated, as be∣gan.
The <HI>Turks</HI> being Routed so entirely, that
not one Galley escap'd, but what was either Sunk
or taken; and it must be confess'd, that the <HI>Czar</HI>
shew'd so much Conduct during the whole Action,
that no more could have been expected, from the
Prudence and Valour of the greatest Captain of
our Time.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Account of this Affair expresses
it self in these Words.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28"/>
AT length it is agreed on all Hands, that the
City of <HI>Asoph,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> had in
vain attempted to Relieve; both by Sea and Land
was Surrender'd to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> upon Articles
the 28th, of <HI>July;</HI> in pursuance of which, the Gar∣rison
consisting of three Thousand Men, besides
<HI>Tartars,</HI> March'd out with their Arms and Bag∣gage;
300 pieces of Cannon were found in the
Town, together with a great quantity of Ammu∣nition:
But want of Provision hasten'd the Sur∣render
of the Town; this Town was formerly
call'd <HI>Tanais,</HI> as being Seated upon the River <HI>Ta∣nais,</HI>
now call'd <HI>Don,</HI> the ancient Bounds of <HI>Asia</HI>
and <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>North-East:</HI> It is a Town of great
Trade, especially in <HI>Furrs,</HI> lying not above 15
Miles from the Mouth of the River, upon the
consines of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> but that which makes it
more Considerable is, that it affords the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
and <HI>Cossacks</HI> a fair Opportunity to become
Masters of the <HI>Euxinus</HI> or <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and gives an
Entrance to the Victor, to penetrate as far as
<HI>Constantinople</HI> itself, for which Reason, it has been
more than once Contested for by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and
<HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>THE News of this Loss was known at <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI>
upon the 7th, of <HI>August,</HI> which put the
City into a great Consternation, for fear of losing
those Supplies of Provisions that come to that City
by the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> They tell us also, of a Victory
obtained over the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> by the <HI>Mus∣covites</HI>
near <HI>Precoop;</HI> which Successes as they re∣vive
the Reputation of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Arms, and
render formidable an Enemy; that for several
Years has hardly been thought worth taking No∣tice
of; so the Confequences of their Prosperity,
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
may chance to prove more Fatal, then was at first
expected to the <HI>Ottomen</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Muscovites</HI> have lain untalk'd of a great
Time, and the <HI>Turk</HI> has look'd upon them, as a de∣spicable
Enemy for many Years: But 'tis scarce to
be imagin'd how soon the change of the Monarch's
Genius, alters the Manners and Conditions of a
Nation; the Warmth and Vigour of Martial
Princes, infuse the same warlike Motions into
the Breasts of the People, as the voluptuousness
of a dispirited Sovereign effeminates them, and o∣verwhelms
them in Sloath and Cowardice. The
<HI>Muscovites</HI> are now another sort of People; they
have a Valiant, and politick Leader, under whose
Conduct they have wrested one of the chief Barri∣ers
of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, from the <HI>Turks,</HI> who
were Vanquish'd first by Sea, and then by Land:
Encouraged thus by Prosperity, what may not the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> do? they want neither Numbers or
Strength of Bodies; and there are few Princes
that can resist the Temptations of Success, so
that it is high time for the <HI>Sultan</HI> to call to his re∣membrance,
how often these <HI>Northern</HI> Deluges,
have proved Fatal to the Empires of the <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>THESE accounts shew the Sentiments of the
rest of <HI>Europe,</HI> concerning the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
and his Affairs at that Time; and the Advantage
which the <HI>Czar</HI> was represented with to the rest of
the Princes of that Age. The <HI>Turks</HI> in particular,
were under a just Consternation, and indeed, they
had Reason, when they came to understand that
the <HI>Czar</HI> had Built Men of War at <HI>Veranowitz,</HI>
which carried 700r 80 Guns each, and which would
in Time, be able to Cope with the best Ships the
Port was able to fit out. This gave them a just
Allarm, even at <HI>Constantinople</HI> itself, which City
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
would be but ill able to Subsist, should the Free∣dom
and Commerce of the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> be taken from
them, or even Disputed with them; and there∣fore
the <HI>Turks</HI> are not to be blam'd at all, for the
great Conditions which they Granted the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Muscovy</HI> afterwards, when they had him as it were
in their Power, for the Recovery of this impor∣tant
Place out of his Hands.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Czar</HI> had made this Conquest, he
was far from contenting himself with letting it
remain in the Condition he found it in; but know∣ing
of what Consequence it was to the <HI>Turks,</HI> as
well as now to himself, he immediately order'd it to
be Strengthned with new Fortifications, and that
of such a Kind, as render'd it the most impreg∣nable
Place in those Parts of the World; he not
only repair'd the old Works, and added two new
Bastions to the Body of the Place, but he caused a
new Counterscarp, with a cover'd Way to be
drawn round the whole, and the Ditch to be Se∣cur'd
with half Moons, Lunettes, Tenailles, and
all such necessary Out-works, as might render it
Inaccessible; bringing the River <HI>Donne</HI> so into the
Ditches, as that it might be said, not that the Ri∣ver
supply'd the Ditches with Water, but rather,
that the River ran round the Town.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, in the low marshy Grounds
on the <HI>South-Side</HI> of the River, which the River u∣sually
over-flow'd, and which was a meer Bog, his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty caused first, a firm solid Founda∣tion
to be made with Timber, Stones, Gravel, and
the like Materials; and having rais'd the whole
Surface to a considerable height, above the usual
Flux of the Water: He Built a Royal Fort upon
it, containing six Bastions, with their Cavaliers
Courtins, and Counterguards, with some Out-Works
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
where it was needful; joyning the whole
afterwards to the main Land, with a prodigious
Stone-Bridge of thirty Arches, reaching over the
whole Morass.</P>
<P>THUS he made the Place truely Impregnable,
there being no Attacking the said Fort by any of
the usual Methods of Approach, the whole Ground
round it being to be laid under Water by Sluices
appointed for that purpose, when ever the Garri∣son
found it convenient.</P>
<P>IN this posture the <HI>Czar</HI> left <HI>Asoph,</HI> at the lat∣ter
end of the next Year (<HI>viz.</HI>) 1697, and the <HI>Turks</HI>
had as littles hopes of over Recovering it again,
as any Prince could desire; he also left it well
stor'd with all manner of military Provisions,
having above 400 pieces of Cannon mounted up∣on
the Works, and Ammunition in proportion;
and left in it besides, a Garrison of 15000 Men.</P>
<P>AND now it was, that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
re∣solv'd to furnish himself with a Royal Navy, not
of Gallies and Brigantines, Saiks and Armed
Barks, such as was the usual Vessels for those Seas:
But of capital Men of War, of 60 to 80 Guns
each, the Magazine and Center of which, and of
the Stores belonging to them, should be always
laid up at <HI>Asoph,</HI> and the Ships themselves be pre∣serv'd
in the River <HI>Donn</HI> at proper Places, of
which I shall give a farther Account; waiting till a
convenient Port might be possess'd in the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI>
where they might be laid up and Secur'd.</P>
<P>WITH these vast Thoughts, the <HI>Czar</HI> left the
Place, and ceased not after he was gone, to go
immediately forward with the Execution of it;
and here may be said to be laid one of the first
Foundations of that Resolution this Prince took
to go Abroad; not only to furnish himself with
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
Skill in all the mechanick Parts of Know∣ledge,
necessary in carrying on such Undertakings;
but likewise to furnish himself with able Instru∣ments,
Men of Knowledge and Capacity for such
Things, that might not only do the Work for him
as Occasion requir'd, but Instruct also his own
People to do it after them.</P>
<P>AT his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's return from this Con∣quest,
he took a Resolution to make a publick
triumphal Entry into his capital City of <HI>Muscow,</HI>
and that with all-the Pomp and Splendor that was
possible to be Devised; but it is worth observing,
that this was not founded upon the Vanity of
Temper, which Princes have often been subject to
upon such Occasions; but from the true <HI>Roman</HI>
Principle of provoking Emulation in Vertuous
Actions among his Nobility, and for acquainting
his People with the Value and Importance of the
Victory he had obtained.</P>
<P>IN this triumphal Entry it was observ'd, that
there was one of his Officers whose Name was <HI>Ja∣cob,</HI>
had in the first Siege of <HI>Asoph,</HI> not only De∣serted
to the Enemy, but Nail'd up some of the
<HI>Czar</HI>'s Cannon, and thereby encourag'd the Garrison
to make a desperate Sally on that Side, in
which they ruin'd the Works, and so Discourag'd
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Soldiers, as was one great Reason of
raising the Siege: This <HI>Jacob</HI> was at the second
Siege surrender'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> having
refused to Grant any Terms to the Garrison, un∣less
he had this Traytor deliver'd up to him.</P>
<P>THIS Wretch made Part of the Triumph of
the <HI>Czar;</HI> he was carried Naked and Chain'd on
a Stage in an open Waggon, with a Gibbet over
his Head; on which, after he had been three times
Tortur'd, he was publickly Hang'd for the Terror
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
of Traytors; some said he was broken first alive,
which however, I do not affirm.</P>
<P>AT this Triumph of the <HI>Czar,</HI> there was an o∣pen
Court, and all the Boyars or Noblemen of
<HI>Russia,</HI> were admitted to come and Kiss the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Hand, and pay their Complements on the Occa∣sion,
which was a Favour they were not admitted
to formerly, but as the <HI>Czar</HI> resolv'd to acquaint
his People with the Customs and usuage of other
Countries, so he began already to make the open
free Conversation of the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>British</HI> Na∣tions
Familiar to them.</P>
<P>AFTER this, the <HI>Czar</HI> call'd them all to an
Assembly, where he open'd and explain'd to 'em,
the Nature and Advantages of his Conquests on
the <HI>Black-Sea;</HI> and how he intended to improve
it to the welfare of his own Dominions, in se∣curing
the Navigation of the said <HI>Black Sea</HI> to
them, by a powerful Navy, and perhaps to obtain
a Commerce even thro' the narrow Chanels, at
<HI>Canstantinople</HI> into the <HI>Levant.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpose, it was easie to convince them
of the Necessity of building a good Fleet of ca∣pital
Men of War, such as should be always a
Match for the Grand <HI>Seignior</HI>'s Fleet, and should
maintain the Commerce if need were by strong
Hand: And at the end of this Discourse, he ac∣quainted
some of them, that he resolv'd to Tra∣vel
in Person to some of the Maritime Courts of
<HI>Europe,</HI> to make himself compleat Master of the
Measures of those Nations, who were so Superior
to the rest of the World by their naval Strength;
and withal, to bring back with him the best Ar∣tists
that could be found; not only to undertake
the Building part for his first Fleet, and for the
present Occasion, which admitted no delay; but
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
also to instruct his own People in all the necessa∣ry
Arts, Handicrafts, and Workmanship which
might be wanting; that so in time none but his
own Subjects might be employ'd, and they might
be capable, in time to come, to make <HI>Muscovy</HI> the
Terror of all its Enemies. That they had the
Materials for building and equipping the greatest
Ships in the World, and in such Plenty, that all
the Marine Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> were oblig'd to seek
to them for their Naval Stores; and it was an un∣accountable
Indolence and Neglect, that they
alone should be ignorant of the building of Ships,
and of the Sea Service of every kind, who were
furnished by Nature and Providence with the
principal Funds of all Naval Provisions: That
they had Timber for the Hulls and Masts of Ships
enough to supply all the World; Hemp and Flax
for Cordage, Cables and Rigging; Iron for Anchors,
Bolts, Spikes, Nails and Tools; Pitch and Tar for
Caulking, Graving, Paying, and for working and
preserving the Cordage and Rigging; that all the
Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> were supplyed with those things
from <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and it was very hard that <HI>Muscovy</HI>
alone should not know how to use and apply all
these for themselves, but that they should buy and
hire Ships of other Nations, and even of those who
first fetch'd the materials from <HI>Muscovy</HI> by which
those Ships were made.</P>
<P>THIS was a Discourse too rational not to con∣quer
the Judgment of any reasonable Creature,
who was not before posseds'd with an invincible
Prejudice. But how far it fail'd to answer his
Expectation, as to the Impressions it made on the
Minds of his People, we shall have frequent occa∣sion
to see.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35"/>
BUT <HI>Muscovy</HI> is not the only Nation in the
World that are to be made Great, Rich, and
Happy against their Wills; and in spight of the
most o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stinate endeavours to ruin themselves;
there have been Nations infatuated before them,
tho' I think scarce ever in so gross a manner.</P>
<P>FOR instead of receiving just Notions of the
Wisdom of such Councils, of the Opportunity
that presented to raise the Glory and Reputation
of their Country, and to lay a Foundation of Wealth
and Opulence for their Posterity, they made this
very Discourse a Foundation of Faction, and even
of Rebellion and Treason; forming a Conspiracy
against not the Government only of the <HI>Czar,</HI> but
against his Life also, and giving those very De∣signs
of his for the advantage of his Country, as
Reasons for their conspiring his Destruction.</P>
<P>AND that which was stranger stil than all
this, was, that in forming these Factions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣menting
the Treason I speak of, they brought in
the Clergy to insinuate to the People, that it was
contrary to the Principles of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church to
oblige the People to converse with Foreigners,
and much more to bring Foreigners in among
them on any pretence whatever; pretending that
they would poison the People with Erroneous
Doctrines, and Heretical Opinions, and that it was
Dangerous to their Religion; <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>IT is to no purpose to exclaim here against the
Absurdity of these Things, it is sufficient to my
History to relate the Fact as it lies before us,
which I shall do in its order as distinctly as possible.</P>
<P>THE Triumph of the Day being over, and the
Traytor <HI>Jacob</HI> executed as above, the <HI>Czar</HI> ap∣plyed
himself with his usual Resolutions and Vi∣gor,
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
in persuit of what he had proposed to himself
as above: <HI>First,</HI> he ordered the building such
Men of War as he had immediate occasion for,
and to this purpose tax'd his principal Noblemen
with such proportions towards the Expence, as he
thought fit, and as by the Custom of that abso∣lute
Government he might legally do; allowing
them however this alternative, that if any particu∣lar
Nobleman did not think fit to advance such
sums of Money, and such numbers of Workmen
as he was Tax'd at, he might take upon himself
the Work, and build such Ship or Ships, or such
part of a Ship, or furnish such quantity of Mate∣rials
as were equivalent to the proportion of Mo∣he
was assessed at.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty obliged such
particular degrees of his Boyars and Gentlemen as
he thought proper, to send abroad their Sons into
Foreign Countries, to study and to improve them∣selves
in such arts, as were necessary to qualify
them for publick Employments; particularly Ma∣thematicks,
Navigation, Engineering, and the
like; whose Expence however, the <HI>Czar</HI> ordered to
be supplyed out of the publick Treasury.</P>
<P>WHILE the <HI>Czar</HI> was thus busied in laying
a Foundation of Glory and Greatness for his Sub∣jects,
<HI>Hard lot of Princes!</HI> his Subjects resisting
their own Advantages, were Conspiring against
his Life, and in a word form'd the most horrid
Treason against their Sovereign, and for the cut∣ting
off all that were faithful to him, and to the
Interest of their Country, that has been heard of
in any Age.</P>
<P>It is true the History, <HI>if the few and loose ac∣counts
that are to be found of this affair deserve the
Name of History,</HI> of these things, lay the main
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
part of this Treason upon the Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Sister: But as this turbulent La∣dy
was a close Prisoner on account of former Con∣spiracies,
and that it was not easie for her to cor∣respond
or to carry on any Conspiracy with Peo∣ple
without Doors, without, giving ground of
suspicion; So tho' she might be made acquainted
with the Plot, yet none of the Conspirators,
tho' put to the extrenest Torture, ever charg'd
that Princess with being the Author of it.</P>
<P>THE first of this Plot as I find it either in the
publick Accounts, or from private Intelligence,
was founded in the Discontents of the Nobil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y,
at being rated, or tax'd for the building of Ships
of War for the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> after the manner as
above: All the other Pretences were brought in
as an accumulated Charge upon the <HI>Czar,</HI> for im∣posing
Novelties upon them, such as the send∣ing
their Sons abroad to Travel, a thing always
not only avoided, but even forbid in <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
and reckon'd or esteem'd to be unlawful; nay,
even the very building of Ships was counted Exo∣tic
and Absurd, and was rendred as a wicked De∣sign
to push at foreign Conquest, and bringing
War upon the Country.</P>
<P>THE better and more effectually to embark
the Soldiery in the Quarrel, the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> that
is to say, the standing Forces of the Empire, such
as were the Mamalucks in <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Pretorian
Bands in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, and the Janiza∣ries
in <HI>Turky,</HI> were put in mind how hardly they
had been treated; how their number was conti∣nually
lessen'd by the Executions among them in
the former Tumult at the <HI>Czar's</HI> coming to the Ad∣ministration;
how their number was not made up,
or their Companys recruited, but as they were put
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
upon the hardest Services on all occasions, so their
Companies being not fill'd up, it was apparent
the <HI>Czar</HI> had a mind to wear them out by De∣grees;
that the present <HI>Czar</HI> had no Affection for
them, and had vowed their Destruction; and that
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had frequently declared he
would suppress the very Name of them as a Body;
all which, in fact, might be true; for the <HI>Czar</HI>
not only had no occasion for them, but resolved,
in time, to sink the Name of them out of the
Army.</P>
<P>NOW, much of this might be true (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
the <HI>Czar</HI> having had terrible experience of the mu∣tinous
Temper of the Strelitz, and how they often
took upon them to act in a bloody and furious
manner; insulting the Government, and even
their Prince, pretending to set up or depose who∣ever
they pleased, had secretly resolv'd to let them
wear gradually out, and by warm Service and hard
Duty, to wear away as fast as they could, without
suffering them to be fill'd up or recruited, and he
had abundant reason to resolve to do so.</P>
<P>THESE Men were therefore the more easie to
be brought into any desperate Measures, to pre∣vent
the annihilation of their Order, and to keep
up the figure they had always made in the Go∣vernment;
and as their pretences of Disgust were
very plausible and popular, so they were the more
easy to be brought into the Design. But still I
must leave the dead weight of this Conspiracy up∣on
those People, who, as I said before, were
pinch'd by the new Order for sending their Chil∣dren
abroad, and upon the Boyars who were a∣warded
to build Ships of War at their own charge,
they and their Vassals as above</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39"/>
THESE Men provok'd at the Severity of the
<HI>Czar</HI>'s usage of them, as they call'd it, were be∣ginners
of the Treason, but they did not find it
so hard as it might have been expected, to engage
others in it for the Reasons above-mentioned.</P>
<P>THE building of these Ships, which had not
been done in <HI>Russia</HI> before, and at the same time
obliging the Boyars and Gentlemen to send their
Sons abroad to Travel, were both look'd upon as a
great Grievance, the one being not only to entail
a Charge upon them beyond the common Tax,
but of bringing in of Foreigners to build and sail
their Ships; and the latter, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the sending abroad
their Children, was such an innovation they could
not well bear; Besides this, it was insinuated
by the Priests, that it would be a means of cor∣rupting
them in the Principles of their Religion,
and which they held to be a thing that was direct∣ly
contrary to the Law of God; adhering to those
Texts of Scripture which forbid the Children of
<HI>Israel</HI> to have any Communion with the Nations
that were round about them, that they might not
partake of their Idolatry; for which Reason even
the Envoys which have been sent heretofore to fo∣reign
Courts, have been denied to take their Sons
with them; and upon pain of Death it was forbid
that any <HI>Muscovite</HI> should go out of the Country
without especial leave from the Patriarch; but
they now murmured that the <HI>Czar</HI> wholly adhered
to Strangers, went himself daily to their Houses,
and freely admitted them to his Conversation,
which stirred up the discontents of the Party that
were out of favour at Court, and who had been
made uneasy at their disappointment since the
last Rebellion; who were still in the Interest of
the Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> and wanted to be themselves
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
at the head of the Government, they therefore
take this opportunity in hopes to give a turn to
Affairs, and that they might effectually bring
about their Purpose.</P>
<P>BUT to come to the matter of fact, the Con∣spiracy
being laid deep as Hell, and cruel as Death,
is describ'd by one of the Writers of that time in
the following words:</P>
<P>“NOTWITHSTANDING that the whole
Empire seemed to take share in the glorious
Conquests of their Prince, and that nothing but
Feasting and Rejoicing were to be seen in all
parts during the whole Winter, there remained
nevertheless a certain discontented Party among
the Nobility, who being encouraged by the se∣cret
Cabals of the Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> found means,
in spight of her confinement, to keep an under∣hand
Correspondence with her for the promo∣ting
their designs against the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Person;
they were so well prepared for the undertaking
of any Enterprize of this nature, that there
wanted but little Fuel to kindle the Flame,
they could not brook the loss of their beloved
Strelitzes, whom they had always looked upon
as the chief Supporters of their Authority,
which at last made them conceive so implacable
a hatred against the <HI>Czar,</HI> that they entred in∣to
a Conspiracy against his Life; to put their
Design in execution, they had brought over to
their Party four Captains of the first Regiment
of Strelitzers; but the difficulty was, in what
manner the Attempt was to be made, for they
looked upon it as impracticable to declare open∣ly
against a Prince, who, besides that he was
much beloved by the People, had at his Devo∣tion
a good number of the best Troops, com∣manded
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
by foreign Officers, who were quarter∣ed
in and about the City of <HI>Muscow,</HI> and ready
upon all Occasions to Sacrifice their Lives for
his Majesty; it was proposed among them, that
the <HI>Czar</HI> was used to go sometimes abroad with
very slender Attendance, and to appear in the
Streets of <HI>Muscow</HI> without any considerable Re∣tinue;
this was also look'd upon as too dange∣rous,
considering the general Love the People
bore to the Person of the <HI>Czar.</HI>”</P>
<P>“AFTER many Debates it was at last resolved,
that considering the <HI>Czar,</HI> who takes share in
every thing that concerns his Subjects Welfare,
was wont to appear in Person, in case of any
accident of Fire, which frequently happens,
and makes most terrible havock in the City of
<HI>Muscow,</HI> where most of the Houses are of Wood;
they looked upon this as the most proper op∣portunity
to encompass their Design; where∣fore
it was concluded to set Fire to some Houses
in the night time, when they did not question
to draw the <HI>Czar</HI> thither, and during the con∣fusion,
to find means to Assassinate him. The
next thing to be done was, according to their
own Confession, to have joined the <HI>Donaick Cos∣sacks</HI>
with their Party, to have released the
Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> from her Confinement, recalled
Prince <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>assily Galickzin</HI> out of <HI>Siberia,</HI> and surren∣dred
the Administration of the Government in∣to
their hands, who were also to restore the Stre∣litzes
to their antient Station.”</P>
<P>THIS was the Substance of the Plot, and to car∣ry
it on more effectually, four Captains of the Stre∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zes,
or Troops of the Houshold were brought
into it, besides several great Men as well in the
Court as in the Army.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42"/>
THE Attempt was now ripe for Execution,
and a great number of the Strelitzes were come pri∣vately
into the Town to assist at the horrid work
of murthering their Sovereign, and perhaps at
that of destroying the whole City; for any one
that knows the City of <HI>Muscow,</HI> how that not on∣ly
the Houses, but even the Pavement, as we call
it of the Streets, are all of Wood; and what ha∣vock
a Fire often makes among them, may easily
suppose, that the City being wilfully fired in three
places, and the People being put into such a Fright
and Confusion, as would have been the case at the
murther of their Emperor, and of such bloody and
cruel Executions, or rather Butcheries, as would
necessarily have follow'd such a thing, the necessary
care for extinguishing the Fire would be omitted
in a great measure, and perhaps the greater part
of the City had been destroy'd, which is horrible
but to think of.</P>
<P>THE Day appointed for the Execution was the
20th of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1697, when the Evening before two
of the Captains of the Strelitzers, namely, Cap∣tain
<HI>Largou Gilisaroski</HI> and Captain <HI>Greg Siteri,</HI>
went and discovered the whole Plot to the <HI>Czar,</HI>
who was then at Supper at Monsieur <HI>le Fort</HI>'s, a
<HI>French</HI> Gentleman, of whom mention is often
made in this Relation. The account of the Dis∣covery,
with the Name and Fate of the Conspi∣rators,
take in a few words from another Pen as
follows.</P>
<P>“It was on the first Day of <HI>February</HI> in the
Year 1697, when his Majesty was informed
concerning this Conspiracy formed against his
Life, at the House of General <HI>le Fort,</HI> were he
happened to dine that Day; he appeared very
little moved at so surprising a piece of News;
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
but without any change in his Countenance, arose
from the Table, and being followed only by a few
Persons in whom he confided most, he went di∣rectly
to the House of one of the Conspirators,
whose Name was <HI>John Sickler,</HI> and elevated by
the <HI>Czar</HI> to the chief Dignity of a Counsellor of
State. When his Majesty came to the House of
this wicked Wretch, he commanded the rest to
remain without Doors, and he himself entred, only
with three Gentlemen more, and pretending he
had occasion to ask his advice in some matter
of moment, ordered he should follow him; but
no sooner was he come into the Street but he
was seized and immediately carried to Prison,
as were likewise five more, to wit, the Boyar
<HI>Alexis Sekonnin, Feodore Puskin,</HI> Son of the Boyar,
<HI>Matfefeoa Puskin,</HI> Ten Captains of the Strelitzes,
and a <HI>Donaick Cossack;</HI> they all confessed their
Crimes, and being condemned by all the Boyars,
were executed on the fifth Day of <HI>March</HI> in the
Year 1697, in the great Market-place before
the Castle. First their Arms and Legs were cut
off, then they had their Heads severed from
their Bodies; their Heads were fixed on the top
of a Stone Column erected for that purpose,
and their Arms and Legs stuck upon Iron Bars
round about it; the Trunks of their dead Car∣casses
were left in the Market-place for eight
Days after, till the scent became so nauseous to
the Inhabitants, that they were forced to be re∣moved
from thence.”</P>
<P>“IT having by confession of some of the Con∣spirators
been made apparent, that the Boyar
<HI>Ivan Miloslaski</HI> was the chief Head of the Rebel∣lion
which happened in the Year 1682, immediately
after his present <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Ac∣cession
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
to the Crown, his Body was disinterred,
which being found very near entire, without
any considerable decay, tho' it had lain under
ground near twelve Years; several Gibbets
were erected, on which were hung the Quarters
of the Carcass, which were torn to pieces in an
instance by the enraged Multitude.”</P>
<P>THE Severity of the Executions in this Case
are excused by their being at <HI>Muscovy,</HI> where Ex∣perience
has taught them, that such Executions
are needful; and where if such a severe course had
not been taken, it might have been hard to per∣swade
the People to believe that the Conspiracy
had been real, or the Government in earnest.</P>
<P>WHEN his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had master'd these
Commotions, and all things were calm again, the
<HI>Czar</HI> who was now so resolv'd upon his Design, as
that nothing could divert him, I mean as to his
Travelling Abroad, began to prepare publickly
for his going, and to let the seditious Boyars
know that he was not under the least Apprehensi∣ons
from any thing they were able to do in his
absence, he made it publick also, in whose Hands
he resolved to entrust the Government in his ab∣sence:
He appointed a good Army to Encamp
within a League of the City of <HI>Muscow,</HI> of whom
a strong Detatchment were to do Duty daily at
the Palace; and among all these Troops which
amounted to 22000 Men, it was especially pro∣vided,
that none of the Strelitzers were allow'd,
intimating, that the <HI>Czar</HI> who had resolv'd to sup∣press
effectually that body of Men, did not think
them worthy to be entrusted with the protection of that Government which they had so often at∣tempted
to disturb.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45"/>
WHILE this was doing, Expresses came fre∣quently
in from <HI>Asoph,</HI> and from General <HI>Skeen</HI>
who commanded the Army there, with News of
Advantages gain'd every Day over the Tartars
and Rebel <HI>Cosacks,</HI> of whom great numbers were
often cut off; and that General, who is a vigilant
Officer, daily extended his Quarters in the <HI>Crim Tar∣tary,</HI>
ravaging the Country and bringing in a great
Booty: So that all things went on that side
to his mind; and as the <HI>Turks</HI> had their Hands full
in <HI>Hungary</HI> with the Imperialists, who had beaten
them in several great Battels, and continued their
Conquests till even <HI>Constantinople</HI> it self began to
tremble at them, they were in no condition to do
any thing towards the recovery of <HI>Asoph;</HI> so that
the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Affairs were in a most Formidable Posture
on that side.</P>
<P>THE Preparations for the intended Progress
of the <HI>Czar</HI> were now finished; and tho' I cannot
say I have a full account of them, neither perhaps
was any full account ever published; yet, as I
believe, the following Particulars are rather short
of, than an over reckoning of the vast Treasure and
Expence furnished on this Occasion, I shall transmit
it as I find it, leaving the Reader to judge of
the Reasonableness and Truth of the Relation by
the Particulars they will meet with in the account
of the Journey.</P>
<P>IT was for some time unresolv'd in what Ca∣pacity
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty should Travel, and se∣veral
Propositions were considered of, as particu∣larly
first, that he should go as a private Gentle∣man,
and with a small Retinue, which was the
first Proposal. (2.) As a Clergy-man of the <HI>Greek</HI>
Church, as had been practised by some of his
boyars the Year before. (3.) As an <HI>Armenian</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
Merchant, under which Disguise several <HI>Persians</HI>
and <HI>Turks</HI> had travelled into <HI>Europe;</HI> for as to go∣ing
publickly, and owning himself to be what he
really was, <HI>Czar</HI> or Emperor of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> that the
<HI>Czar</HI> himself had resolved against for many sub∣stantial
Reasons; as, (1.) The Expence of it.
(2.) The losing the opportunity of inspecting per∣sonally
into things, which he had with great Rea∣son
seen could not be done but in a private Capa∣city.
And (3.) Because the whole time would be
taken up in Shows and Ceremonies, things below
the important Design of the Journey, and utterly
inconsistent with it. At length Monsieur <HI>le Fort</HI>
proposed what the <HI>Czar</HI> immediately approved, a
method which as he said would consist both with
the Honour and Safety of his Majesty's Person,
and yet give him all the opportunity of a Con∣cealment
that he could desire, and this was, that
a solemn Embassy should be sent from his Majesty
to all the Courts to which he had intended to go,
with a Compliment of Honour, and Proposals of
Amity and Commerce; and Ambassadors to be
vested with full Plenipotentiary Powers to enter
into Treaties of Alliance and Treaties of Com∣merce
with the said Nations respectively; and
that his Majesty should Travel <HI>Incognito</HI> in the
Retinue of his said Ambassadors, and under the
Protection of the Embassy it self, by which means
it would at the same time be known that he was
personally present, and thereby his Embassy
would be receiv'd with the greater Distinction;
and yet as he would be at liberty to receive all
possible Ceremony and Honour where he thought
fit to accept it, so he would be at liberty to de∣cline
it also, as he found occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47"/>
THIS hit his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Thoughts imme∣diately,
and was so perfectly agreeable to his
whole Design, which was to make himself Master
of all the Methods of the Nations he intended to
pass thro,' in the management of their Military
and Naval Affairs; and particularly of all Ma∣thematical
and Mechanical Knowledge, which he
presently foresaw he should by this Method be
fully able to do.</P>
<P>THIS being therefore resolv'd on, several
things remain'd to be done, and were to be
fully concerted before-hand.</P>
<P>1. WHO should be the Ambassadors appointed
for this Honourable Post.</P>
<P>2. WHO the Government should be committed
to in the <HI>Czar</HI>'s absence. what Power should
be committed to them in the Administration, and
what Forces should be left them.</P>
<P>5. WHAT Nations the Ambassadors should go
to, and the Form of their Powers.</P>
<P>4. THE raising a sufficient Sum of Money for
the Expences of such an Embassy, and for the ex∣traordinary
Service abroad, namely, of purchasing
things proper to be brought away, and what Sum
would be wanting.</P>
<P>5. PROVIDING such Jewels and Cloths, Li∣veries
and Habits as the Ambassadors and their
Servants should have occasion to appear in on the
occasion of Publick Entries, Audiences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or
for presents to carry with them.</P>
<P>6. THE determining who should be appointed
to Travel with or after the Embassy.</P>
<P>THE resolving these Particulars took up some
time, several of them being of very great Conse∣quence,
and we find they were adjusted with a
great deal of Prudence and Caution.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48"/>
THE Choice of the Persons of the Ambassadors
fell upon these three; <HI>First,</HI> General <HI>le
Fort</HI> Captain of the Guards, and at that time Ad∣miral
of the Fleet, who, as he was a <HI>Frenchman</HI>
born, had liv'd many Years at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and
some time in <HI>Italy,</HI> so he in the first place was
fully acquainted with all the Customs and Man∣ners
of those Countries, and capable of advising in
the particular Measures to be observ'd in each
Country; and of the Ceremonial; as well what
Respect was to be shewn, as what was to be ex∣pected
where-ever they came; and in the next
place, as he knew the Language, so he serv'd the
<HI>Czar</HI> as an Interpreter upon the most important
Occasions. The next was <HI>Theodore Alexiamvitz
Golloffkin,</HI> a Grave Majestick Person, and fully ac∣quainted
with the Interest and Trade, as well as
the Laws and Customs of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and how to
carry on any Treaty of Commerce, or receive
Proposals for the Advantage and Interest of Trade;
having been Chancellor of the whole Empire, and
the same who formerly made the Treaty of Peace
between his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty and the Emperor of
<HI>China,</HI> of which we shall speak in its place, and
who had been twice by Land at <HI>China</HI> in the Qua∣lity
of Ambassador and Plenipotentiary to the
Emperor there. The third was call'd, <HI>Proco∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et
Bodgnanovitz Woluitzin,</HI> who had been employ'd
in several Embassies to the Grand Seignior, and
was perfectly acquainted with his Master's Inter∣ests,
with respect to the <HI>Turks,</HI> the settling Limits,
the Affair of <HI>Asoph,</HI> and in any thing else that
might happen on that side, especially if at <HI>Vienna</HI>
any Proposals of an Accommodation should be
made to the Emperor and his Allies.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49"/>
THESE were the three Ambassadors to whom
the whole Affair was committed; nor were there
three Men equally capable to so great a Work in
his whole Dominion; and as his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
was always with them, there was no occasion of
any delay, or spinning out the Negotiations, as is
usual in other cases.</P>
<P>THE General <HI>le Fort</HI> was made first Plenipo∣tentiary,
and consequently was at the Head of this
Embassy, being partly qualifyed by his Know∣ledge
in the Languages and Customs of <HI>Europe</HI> as
above, to appear at the head of all the Negotia∣tions.</P>
<P>THE second Article (<HI>viz.</HI>) who the Admini∣stration
of the Government should be committed
to in the <HI>Czar</HI>'s absence, was soon resolv'd by the
<HI>Czar</HI> himself, who pitch'd upon the Princes <HI>Na∣riskin,
Procorofski,</HI> and <HI>Boris Galitzen,</HI> all faith∣ful
Servants of the Crown, and steady in the Per∣sonal
Interest of the <HI>Czar;</HI> the first being the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Mother's own Brother and prime Minister; the
second the Grand Receiver, or Lord Treasurer,
an ancient faithful Prince, always steady to the
<HI>Czar</HI> and to his whole Family; and the third a
particular Favourite, possessing several high Trusts
in the Government, and vastly rich also himself.</P>
<P>THE Military Trust was committed to Gene∣ral
<HI>Skeen</HI> or <HI>Scherin,</HI> who was made Generalissimo
for all that concern'd the War against the <HI>Turks</HI>
and <HI>Tartars</HI> on the Borders of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and
on the side of <HI>Circassia;</HI> and to General <HI>Gordon,</HI> a
<HI>Scots</HI> Man, for what concern'd the Guard of the
Palace and Capital City of <HI>Muscow,</HI> and all the
Northern Parts of the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Dominions: The
former had under his Command the whole Army
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
at and in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Asoph,</HI> or from
<HI>Astracan</HI> to <HI>Kaiserkameen</HI> on the <HI>Boristhenes;</HI> and
the other had the Command of the rest of the Troops,
as well at <HI>Muscow</HI> as aforesaid, as on the Frontiers
of <HI>Poland</HI> and of <HI>Sweden, Courland, &amp;c.</HI> and had
in particular the Charge given him of Protecting
the Administration in the hands of the three
Princes above-mentioned.</P>
<P>3. THE third Article was to consider what Na∣tions
or Courts this Embassy should be directed
to, and this was soon determined; the Rout or
Cavalcade being ordered to pass forward thus;
First to <HI>Prussia</HI> and the Court of <HI>Berlin.</HI> II. To
<HI>Holland.</HI> III. To <HI>England.</HI> IV. To <HI>Vienna</HI> to the
Emperor. And Lastly, to <HI>Venice:</HI> These being
the Capital places where Military and Naval
Knowledge were now to be found in the greatest
Perfection; except in <HI>France,</HI> which for weighty
Reasons his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty resolv'd not to go
to <HI>France,</HI> at that time, being engaged in a heavy
War against almost all the other Princes of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI></P>
<P>4. THE next Head was the Funds for the Ex∣pence
of this Journey: This the <HI>Czar</HI> took up∣on
himself to direct; and I am assur'd that his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty set apart for this Work above two
Millions of Rubles, which in <HI>English</HI> Money is near
800000 Pounds Sterling; but I do not positively
affirm that so great a Sum was taken: Most of
this Money, be the Sum what it will, was ex∣pended
in buying Ships, materials for forwarding
several Sciences for the publick use in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> as
also for buying Arms, Artillery and Ammuniti∣on
to be sent to <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>5. THE Povision for Presents to be made to
such Princes, and States where they were to appear
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
in Ceremony, and for Audiences, for which
purpose twenty large Bales of the richest Furs,
such as Sables, Ermins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were provided, and
several Bales of rich Cloth of Gold made in
<HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Georgia;</HI> and several Parcels of very
valuable Jewels, as also some fine <HI>Turkish</HI> and
<HI>Tartarian</HI> Horses.</P>
<P>6. THE determining who should be appointed
to Travel with the <HI>Czar;</HI> and this Article was ve∣ry
Significant, as it intimated that the <HI>Czar</HI> took
with him about Forty Persons of the Prime Rank
in his Dominion, or their Sons; This was call'd
an Honour done them, but was wisely determined
to secure them from Plotting and Conspiring a∣gainst
him during his absence: In the mean time
such other Noblemen as were Distrusted, or out of
Favour, were commanded to retire to their own
Seats, and not to come to the City of <HI>Muscow,</HI> or
to Court on pain of Death.</P>
<P>HAVING thus with an inimitable Conduct
assur'd things at home to his full Satisfaction,
and having taken of the Foreign Merchants in his
Dominions Bills of Exchange upon Merchants in
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> for a great part of the Trea∣sure
he had appointed for his Journey; and all
things being ready to depart; the Baggage was sent
before with a strong Guard, and having obtained
proper Passes for the whole Embassy for <HI>Konings∣burgh,</HI>
a City in the Ducal <HI>Prussia</HI> belonging to the
King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> then Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> his
Majesty set out the second of <HI>May,</HI> or thereabouts,
himself going <HI>Incognito</HI> at some distance from his
Ambassadors and their Train, and the 10th of the
same Month be entred the Province of <HI>Livonia,</HI> at
that time belonging to the <HI>Swedes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52"/>
IT was said his Majesty receiv'd some ill Treat∣ment
at <HI>Riga,</HI> that is to say, they declin'd satis∣fying
his Curiosity in letting him view the Works
and Forts in the manner he desir'd; and as it was
the first Town compleatly fortified after the <HI>French</HI>
manner, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was the more pressing
to make his Observations, which they not admit∣ting,
extremely disgusted him; but he has had op∣portunity
to remember it since, to the Cost of
the <HI>Swedes,</HI> from whom he took not that City only,
but the whole Province in a few Years after, and
remains possess'd of them to this Day; and 'tis
observed that the Resentment of the Usage of his
Ambassadors, for he does not take notice of his
being in Person with them, is mentioned in his
Declaration of War against <HI>Sweden,</HI> as one of the
Causes of his breaking the Peace with them.</P>
<P>BUT he found himself treated after a quite
different manner at the next Place of Note he
came to, which was at <HI>Koningsberg</HI> the Capital of
the Ducal <HI>Prussia</HI> as above: Hither the Duke of
<HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> since King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> came with his
whole Court to receive and entertain him; and
here the <HI>Czar</HI> resolv'd to show the World the first
Specimen of his Glory and Greatness. His Em∣bassy
had hitherto a Retinue of Three Hundred
persons, several little Troops of Guards arm'd,
some with Bows, some with Battle Axes, and o∣thers
with Lances; and abundance of the young
Nobility, who afterwards were dispers'd to other
parts, were at this first Entry.</P>
<P>THE manner of this glorious Entry, as it was
publish'd and spread in Print in all the Languages
of <HI>Europe,</HI> take as follows.</P>
<P>“THE Letters are dated from <HI>Koningsberg</HI> in
<HI>Prussia</HI> May 31. <HI>N. S.</HI> That the Ambassadors
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
from the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> who are the Lords
<HI>Francis Jacow Lewits Le Fort, Mexiewits Holo∣win,</HI>
and <HI>Precophei Bodanowitz Wornitzien,</HI> being
arriv'd upon the <HI>Thursday</HI> Morning before
at <HI>Lauterburg,</HI> within a Mile of the City,
with a train of Three Hundred Persons;
the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> immediately sent
away M. <HI>Dankelmen</HI> to compliment the Am∣bassadors
in his Name, and to keep them com∣pany
After Dinner, Mr. <HI>Besser,</HI> the Master of
the Ceremonies, arriv'd at the same place also,
with a great company of Nobility to conduct
them to the City, at what time their Excellen∣cies
taking Coach with M. <HI>Dunkelmen,</HI> and M.
<HI>Besser,</HI> in one of the Elector's Coaches, about
four a Clock that Afternoon made their Publick
Entry into <HI>Koningsberg</HI> in the following manner,
First came his Electoral Highnesses Led Horses,
to the number of Forty. Secondly, an Officer
attended by the Kettle Drums of the Guards,
and Three Troops of the Guards of the Body
clad in Red; next the principal Nobility of
Ducal <HI>Prussia</HI> in Twenty Six Coaches with Six
Horses, then two of the Elector's Coaches, and
One of the Margrave <HI>Albert</HI>'s; after them the
Court Pages Two and Two, with a Page of the
Ambassadors between 'em in Red Liveries Lac'd
with Gold Lace. Sixthly, the chief Ministers
and Officers of the Elector's Houshold in Thirty
Six Coaches. Seventhly, the first Kettle-Drum,
and the first Trumpet belonging to his Electo∣ral
Highness, follow'd by the Ambassador's Foot
Guards clad in Green, with each a Silver Bat∣tle
Axe upon his Shoulder; then Thirty of the
Ambassadors Horse-guards in the same Livery,
but without Battle Axes. Ninthly, the Coach
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
wherein their Excellencies rode. Lastly, the
march was clos'd with twelve Coaches fill'd
with <HI>Muscovite</HI> Gentlemen and <HI>Brandenburghers.</HI>
Their Excellencies being thus conducted over
the <HI>Karkerbrug</HI> to a magnificent Lodging pre∣pared
for 'em in the long Street of <HI>Kneiphoff,</HI>
the Burghers being drawn up in a double File,
and lining the Streets all the way, and a trip∣ple
discharge of all the great Guns saluting
them from their entrance into their Lodging,
where the Garrison of the City stood to re∣ceive
them: So soon as they alighted they were
conducted to their Apartment, which was guard∣ed
by twenty Soldiers; and then the Lords of
the Court, together with M. <HI>Dankelman,</HI> and
the Master of the Ceremonies left 'em, and
were waited on by the Ambassadors to the Stairs
of the House.”</P>
<P>“UPON the Fourth of this Instant, <HI>N. S.</HI> they
had their Publick Audience of the Elector, to
which they were conducted by M. <HI>Dankelman,</HI>
and the Master of the Ceremonies above-nam'd,
with a Train of Thirty Coaches; before the
Ambassadors went Thirty Persons carrying the
<HI>Czar</HI>'s Present to the Elector; the Ambassadors,
who were richly habited in Cloth of Gold
and Silver embroider'd with precious Stones,
being enter'd into the great Hall of the Castle,
where the Elector was seated upon a Throne
attended by the principal Lords of his Court,
made their Reverences; and after they had
every one in their order complimented the E∣lector
in short but significant Speeches, they
deliver'd him the Present, and a Letter pur∣porting,
that the <HI>Czar</HI> had sent the said Em∣bassy
to his Electoral Highness to assure him of
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
his desire to improve the Affection and good
Correspondence which had always been, as well
between him, as his illustrious Ancestors. That
the same Embassy being from thence to pro∣ceed
to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> in order to farther
Consultations and Propositions for the continu∣ance
of the War against the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI>
His <HI>Muscovite</HI> Majesty therefore requested the
Elector to assist 'em in their Journey, withal
returning his Electoral Highness thanks for the
Engineers and Bombardiers which he sent him the
last Year, and which had been so useful to him
in the Siege of <HI>Asoph:</HI> To all which the E∣lector
answer'd, that he was much oblig'd to
the <HI>Czar</HI> for the assurance of his good intentions,
and the splendid Embassy he had sent him.
And then M. <HI>Dankelman</HI> return'd an Answer
more at large, and very obligingly to the Com∣pliments
of the several Ambassadors, who were
after that reconducted to their Lodgings with
the same Ceremonies, and treated with a splen∣did
Dinner at the Elector's Charge. The same
Evening they were also entertained with a
Shew of Fireworks which lasted till Midnight.
Their Present consisted of Sables, Ermins, and
other rich Furrs, several f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owered Silks and Tis∣sues
of Gold and Silver; and other precious
Rarities, valu'd in all at Seventy Five Thou∣sand
Crowns”</P>
<P>DURING his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's stay at this Court
he receiv'd the News by an Express of the Electi∣on
of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> now King <HI>Augustus,</HI>
to the Crown of <HI>Poland;</HI> and as his Majesty had
before discovered himself to be in the Interest of
that Party, which oppos'd the Prince of <HI>Conty</HI>'s
Election; so upon this News he immediately sent
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
a Minister to the new King, to make his Com∣pliment
of Congratulation, and to declare pub∣lickly,
that he would support his Pretensions,
and would maintain him on the Throne with his
whole Power; and particularly, that he would
cause an Army of 60000 Men to march immedi∣ately
to the Frontiers of <HI>Lithuania</HI> to be under his
Majesty's Orders, for his Assistance in case of
need.</P>
<P>ALL the while of the stay of the Embassy, the
Elector of <HI>Brandenbourgh</HI> did every thing that was
possible, as well to shew his own Magnificence,
as to Honour the Embassy of so great a Monarch;
and especially considering that this Embassy, how∣ever
glorious in it self to the Court of <HI>Prussia,</HI> was
yet the more so by the addition of this Article,
that the <HI>Czar,</HI> the greatest Monarch of the <HI>East,</HI>
was there in Person, under the shelter of the Am∣bassadors
his Servants.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had here several Occasions
to Converse intimately with the Elector, and
that with the greatest Freedom and Openness;
communicating to him the Reason of his coming
thus out of his own Dominions, and passing
<HI>Incognito:</HI> I have been told that the Elector,
a Wise and Polite Prince, exceedingly approv'd
and applauded his Intentions,' and said some very
fine things both of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty in his Mi∣nister's
ordinary Discourse, as well as personally
to him; and at the Conclusion, willingly entred
into a Defensive Treaty with his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
Ambassadors. In a word, the Elector omitted
nothing that could either testify his Affection to
the <HI>Czar</HI> in the most obliging manner, or add any
Assistance to him or his Retinue, causing them to
be defray'd at his own Expence, not at <HI>Konings∣berg</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
only, but all the while he was passing thro'
his Dominions.</P>
<P>FROM hence his Majesty went by Water thro'
the <HI>Pillau</HI> and the <HI>Freisch Haft,</HI> as it is call'd, to
<HI>Dantzick;</HI> the Elector ordering some Yachts to at∣tend
his Majesty in the Passage. This Water
call'd the <HI>Freisch Haft,</HI> is an Inland Lake or Wa∣ter
which reaches from the <HI>Pillau</HI> near <HI>Koningsberg,</HI>
to a Branch of the great River <HI>Vistula,</HI> which
passes by <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and by which Vessels pass
from <HI>Koningsberg</HI> to <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and is separated
from the Sea by a narrow Tract of Land not above
three Leagues over, which however lies parallel
with the said <HI>Haft,</HI> and entirely parts it from the
main Sea.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty took great Delight in sail∣ing
upon this Water, and in observing the dex∣trous
manner of the Seamens working the Yachts,
in turning to Windward, and the like; and he spent
some Days on purpose to divert himself in that
Water with sailing up and down, the Weather
also being very pleasant and agreeable at that
time.</P>
<P>ABOUT the 20th he arriv'd at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> where
the Burghers and Magistrates treated his Ambassa∣dors,
and that is to say his Majesty himself, with
all possible Distinction, and caused all the Forts,
Lines, Magazines, and Haven or Port, and every
part of the Fortifications of that great City to be
shown him; which Fortifications far exceeded those
of <HI>Riga,</HI> and which was very much to his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty's Satisfaction. His Embassy made no
Entry here, being not directed to say any thing
to the Citizens as a Body, and as to their Sove∣reign
the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> that Kingdom was at this
time as it were in an <HI>Interregnum,</HI> the late King
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
<HI>John Sobieski</HI> being dead, and the new King <HI>Au∣gustus</HI>
being but newly chosen, and not yet
Crown'd.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the Magistrates of <HI>Dantzick</HI> re∣ceiv'd
several Testimonies of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
Favour, and to let them know how well he was
pleas'd with their Conduct, assur'd them of his
Favour and Protection upon all Occasions; And
as his Embassy had been presented with great
quantities of fresh Provisions, Wines, and Refresh∣ments,
so much as was almost sufficient for their
whole Retinue; in return of this the <HI>Czar</HI> caused
his Ambassadors to make the Magistrates a present
of Sables, and other rich Goods to a very conside∣rable
Value.</P>
<P>FROM hence his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty went direct∣ly
thro' the Ducal <HI>Pomerania</HI> to the City of <HI>Berlin,</HI>
the Court of the Elector of <HI>Brandenbourgh,</HI> where
he was Royally entertained and his whole Em∣bassy
and Retinue: They made no Publick Entry
here, it being the Court of the same Prince who
had receiv'd them with such Splendor at <HI>Konings∣berg:</HI>
But the <HI>Czar</HI> had here the Occasion of seeing
the most splendid Court in <HI>Europe,</HI> except that of
<HI>France,</HI> and to Converse in the most Polite man∣ner;
and was so exceedingly pleas'd with the
Gallantry and Magnificence of all he saw here,
that he resolved to send his Son the Hereditary
Royal Prince to reside there for some time to fi∣nish
and polish his Manners for the great things
which they then suppos'd him to be born to: But
time furnished the <HI>Czar</HI> with Reasons to take o∣ther
Measures, with respect to that Prince, of which
in its Order.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Berlin</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> bent his course towards
the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> where his solemn Embassy was
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
principally design'd to appear; and it is certain
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that is to say the <HI>States,</HI> had made it
much of their business to obtain this Honour;
intimating to the <HI>Czar</HI> their desire to form such
Treaties of Commerce and Assistance as might
be for the mutual Profit of the Subjects of both
Nations; and particularly their Resolution to
furnish his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty with Workmen, Build∣ers,
Shipwrights, and Tradesmen of every kind,
necessary for the Building of his Men of War;
and as they had obtain'd an assurance that his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty intended to Honour them with
his Presence, and with his Embassy, so they were
not wanting in all the necessary Preparations, to
give him a Reception suitable in some measure to
the greatness of his Person and Character.</P>
<P>IT was not till the Month of <HI>August</HI> that the
Ambassadors could set their Foot in the Territo∣ries
of the <HI>States General:</HI> For tho' my business is
to write of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and of him personally, yet
I must be allowed to speak here only in the
Name of the Embassy and of the Ambassadors.
As soon as the <HI>States General</HI> had notice of their
arrival upon their Frontiers, they sent a solemn
Deputation to attend them at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> from their
whole Body; for them, and in their Names, to
bid them welcome into their Country, to de∣fray
all the Charges of the said Ambassadors
and their whole Retinue, to receive them at
the first entrance into their Bounds, and to com∣pliment
them accordingly.</P>
<P>THUS they were carried thro' all the Towns
with the noise of Cannon, and of small Arms on
the one hand, and with the Shouts and Acclama∣tions
of the People on the other; the States being
willing to preserve the Memory of their being
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
thus honoured by so solemn an Embassy, the most
Glorious that had ever been seen in these Parts of
the World.</P>
<P>IT would be to omit the most glorious Demon∣stration
of the <HI>Russian</HI> Greatness, if I should fail
to give a full Account here as well of the said
Publick Entry, as of the great Ceremony of Au∣dience
given these Ambassadors afterwards at the
<HI>Hague,</HI> and also of the noble Appearance and
Deportment of the Ambassadors themselves; ne∣ver
any Men from the Politest Nation under Hea∣ven
behav'd better, or made their Speeches with
a better Grace, or better became the Character
they bore.</P>
<P>IT is certain the <HI>States-General,</HI> who, as I said
before, had earnestly desir'd this Occasion of
showing their Respect to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty,
intended to receive his Ambassadors with great
Marks of Distinction, and especially knowing that
the <HI>Czar</HI> was in Person with them: But they
found themselves a little surpriz'd when they
came to see the Ambassadors themselves; their
Persons, their Behaviour, and the perfect Know∣ledge
they had of every thing that came before
them to Discourse of; the Judgment they made
of the Interests of Nations, and of the Advan∣tages
of Commerce, the manner of extending it,
and of what was fit to propose or not to propose
in that part; and also the Judgment they were
able to make of their being well or ill treated;
so that upon seeing what sort of Ministers they
had to do with, the States found it necessary to
out-do, if possible, what they had at first intend∣ed
in the Honours they design'd them.</P>
<P>WE are to suppose them now pass'd thro' the
<HI>Lower Saxony,</HI> and approaching the Frontiers of
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
the States Country; the States Deputies gone to
meet and compliment them in the Name of the
Republick, and conducting them to <HI>Sourdam,</HI> near
the Capital City of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and to defray their
Charges upon the Way. The next thing is that
of their Publick Entry, which was the 26th of
<HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>THE Magnificence of their Reception here
consisted of several parts, that is to say, not only
in their meer Entry into the City, which was in∣deed
very fine, but in the Entertainment they
had there till the time they went to their Publick
Audience at the <HI>Hague;</HI> and also in the Recepti∣on
they had at the several Cities which they pass'd
thro', as well before they came to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> as
when they went from thence to the <HI>Hague;</HI> in all
which it is to be observed, that tho' the <HI>Czar</HI> was
a constant Eye-witness to the Reception of his
Ambassadors, and had a great deal of Reason to
be very well satisfied with the Honours they re∣ceiv'd,
which indeed was no more or less than
Honours done to himself in the Persons of his
Servants; yet his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty keeping firm to
his first Resolutions of being conceal'd, and of not
appearing in Publick, was never seen in any of
the publick Cavalcades; but either went in the
Retinue conceal'd in the ordinary Dress of a pri∣vate
Person, or had himself placed in some pri∣vate
Station to be a Spectator of what pass'd, as we
shall find he did at their Audience at the <HI>Hague;</HI>
and if he was at any time discovered, as was on
Two or Three Occasions his case, while he was in
<HI>Holland,</HI> nothing gave him more uneasiness, nor
would he leave till he found himself so disguis'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be able to go publickly about and not be
known.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62"/>
THIS, and his desire to view the Yards, the
Docks, the building of Ships, and all the parti∣cular
Operations of the Carpenters, Caulkers,
Anchor-smiths, Black-smiths, Rope-makers, and
so of all the rest, I say this, made him for some
time Dress himself in the ordinary Habit of a
common Seaman with a <HI>Monmouth</HI> Cap, a short
Jacket and wide Breeches, so that it was impossible
to discover him; and in this Disguise I have been
assured, tho' I cannot affirm it of my own knowl∣edge,
that he has suffered himself to be hired in∣to
their Carpenters Yards as a Workman, and has
both performed a Day's Work, and received his
Wages. But I say again, that I rather repeat this
from other hands, than say I believe it, or re∣commend
it to others to believe.</P>
<P>BUT let that be as it will, certain it is, that
in this Disguise he had a compleat liberty, with∣out
the Interruption of the Crowding, and Curio∣sity
of the People to look at him; I say he had
the liberty of seeing every thing that was done,
and also, <HI>which was the main thing to him,</HI> how it
was done.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Ambassadors, the Depu∣ties
sent to receive them on the Borders of the
Country, having brought them to <HI>Sourdam,</HI> a
Town about Miles from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> they
were lodg'd there till the Preparations could be
made for their Reception in the City, which was
done at the Charge of the Magistrates; the Pro∣cession
was in the following manner.</P>
<P>IN the Morning early Five Deputies from the
States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and Three from the City of
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> attended the Ambassadors at <HI>Saurdam,</HI>
to Compliment them on their Arrival, and to In∣vite
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
them into the City; and the Yacht's of the
State were order'd to lye ready to attend them,
and take them on Board, with all their Retinue;
which was done accordingly, and they arriv'd at
the Place appointed for their Landing about ten
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Clock.</P>
<P>A certain Number of the Magistrates were
Deputed to attend them at their Landing, with
about fifty Coaches of the Burgomasters, and of
the Principal Citizens, and were to Complement
them on their Arrival. The Principal young Ci∣tizens
form'd themselves into a Troop, and being
well Mounted, and with extreamly rich Furni∣ture
and Equipage, attended their Excellencies
Entry, being to the Number of near three Hun∣dred
Horse.</P>
<P>BESIDES these the principal Citizens, and
all the Persons of Distinction went to meet them
in their Coaches to a very great Number.</P>
<P>AS soon as the Ambassadors landed, and were
seated in their Coaches, the Cannon from the
Ramparts fir'd round the whole City, and under
the Thunder of the said Guns the Cavalcade be∣gan.</P>
<P>IN the first Place march'd a Body of the City
Officers to clear the Way, and prevent Disorders
from the infinite Throng of People in the Streets;
then march'd 16 Companies of the Burghers un∣der
Arms, who when they came to the Place
appointed for them, form'd two Lines to Lin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
the Street, thro' which the Ambassador and their
whole Retinue were to pass, other Bodies of the
Burghers under Arms, lin'd the rest of the Way
to the Place where the 16 Companies took their
Post.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64"/>
NEXT to these came the Troop of young
Gentlemen on Horseback, very richly Dress'd,
and their Equipages <HI>as before</HI> very splendid; and
before them went the States Trumpets, and City
Musick; then came a small Troop of <HI>Circassian
Tartars</HI> on Horseback, being of the Ambassadors,
Retinue, arm'd with Bows and Arrows; then six
and thirty <HI>Muscovite</HI> Gentlemen on Horseback;
then twenty Pages of the Ambassadors, clothed
in Scarlet lac'd, or rather overlaid with Gold
Lace; then came the eldest Burgomaster's Coach
of State, in which were the Ambassador <HI>Le
Fort,</HI> and the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Prince <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>zike<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;</HI> then
the Grand Pensionary of <HI>Holland's</HI> Coach, in
which were the two other Ambassadors, and another
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Prince: On either side these Coaches,
march'd the Ambassador's Guard, on Foot, carry∣ing
silver Battle-Axes, and by their Sides large
Scymetars; they were Clothed after the <HI>Sclavo∣nian</HI>
manner, with short Doublets, and large
Breeches, and over them Scarlet Cloaks, or Robes
trim'd with silver Buttons, and large Loops, and
Scarlet lac'd with Silver very rich: After these,
came the rest of the Coaches mention'd above, in
which were the rest of the Ambassadors Retinue;
among them the <HI>Czar</HI> himself, but Dress'd in an
ordinary Habit, so as not be distinguish'd; nei∣ther
was it possible to Discover him, tho' the
People were mighty inquisitive about it.</P>
<P>AFTER these Coaches came 120 Coaches of
Citizens, Merchants and Gentlemen, who came
to wait upon the Ambassadors; and among these
were the Magistrates of the City; the whole
Closing with another Body of Burghers in
Arms. But the Magistrates did not End here,
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
for after having thus Conducted the Ambassadors
to their Appartments, they treated them in the
most Magnificent manner immaginable, for five
Days successively, and thus prepar'd a most ex∣traordinary
Firework, raised upon Floats, built
on purpose in the Water of the <HI>Amstel.</HI> It would
take up too much Room in this Work, to give
the Description of this Firework, which was
fram'd in the most Exquisite manner, that the
best Engineers and Architects could Invent; nor
was any Cost spar'd in either, the Device or the
Building. In a Word, it was the most Magnifi∣cent
that ever was seen in these Parts of the
World, and his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was exceedingly
pleas'd with it, as he had a great deal of Reason
to be; for it was Executed with all immaginable
in Order and Success.</P>
<P>IT is true, this Sight was attended with an un∣happy
Accident among the People, for that the
Railes of the Bridge over the River, being Crow∣ded
with People, gave way, and above 100 Peo∣ple
fell into the River, where about thirteen or
fourteen were Drown'd; and indeed it was a great
Wonder the Night being dark and the Water
deep and the Crowd so great, that there were not
more lost.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was now in the Center
of his Business, and had before him the main
Thing he came to see; and therefore shunning
all publick Appearances, other than those which
Necessity oblig'd him to, he took a small House,
near the <HI>East India</HI> Companies Yards or Docks,
that is to say, among the Shipwrights and Buil∣ders,
and where he could with ease get Admit∣tance
in Diguise, to see every thing which he
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
thought fit to Enquire after, and to take his Ob∣servations
at his own Leisure.</P>
<P>IT is true, he was oblig'd to go from thence
for sometime to the <HI>Hague,</HI> to see his Ambassadors
admitted to a publick Audience of their High
Mightinesses the States General; but he soon re∣turn'd
again and remain'd perfectly retir'd for
some Months, where he spent his Time in the
most useful Studies of Life (<HI>viz.</HI>) the gaining true
Ideas of the most noble Things, and searching the
height and depth of Mathematical Knowledge.</P>
<P>I should have observ'd here that the <HI>Czar</HI> him∣self
having receiv'd the Deputies on the Fron∣tiers
of <HI>Guelderland,</HI> and being desirous to Tra∣vel,
perfectly undiscover'd, left his Ambassadors
and their Train, which was very great, to come
leisurely forward with the said Deputies▪ and
himself with only four or five Gentlemen disguis'd
as ordinary Travellers, came to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> four
or five Days before them, where he Lodg'd at first
in a common Inn, or House of Entertainment,
and walk'd freely about the City, view'd the Situa∣tion,
the Buildings, the River, the Port, and that
infinite Number of Ships, which always are to
be seen there; particularly he pitch'd upon the
Place for his Retreat, or private Residence, which as
I have mention'd above was among the Ship-Yards,
Docks and Building-Places, that he might parti∣cularly
make his Observations of those things;
The enquiry after which was his Delight, and
the especial Business of his whole Embassy.</P>
<P>THE Ceremony ended as above, his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty retir'd to the House which he had Hir'd,
and went on with his Equipage and Observations;
and as he spoke Dutch indifferently well before, so
he took occasion to Discourse with all the Work∣men
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
and Artists that he could find, who he disco∣vered
to have any tollerable Judgement in things
of that Nature. Nor was his Majesty so retir'd,
but that he admitted some of the Merchants of
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> to his Conversation, and especially
such as had resided in <HI>Muscovy;</HI> that is to say at
<HI>Arch-Angel</HI> and <HI>Muscow,</HI> of which several were
then living in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and with these he would
be very free and Courteous, and sometimes <HI>even
Merry</HI> only not allowing them to Treat him with
too much Ceremony and Distinction.</P>
<P>BY the Conversation of these Men he had several
People brought to him, who were most
Masters of Science, and who entertain'd his Ma∣jesty
very much to his Satisfaction, with the se∣veral
Experiments in Nature, in Phylosophy, and
in the Mathematicks, which they had made in the
Consequence of long Study; and it was to their
Aftonishment how soon, and how readily his <HI>Cza∣rish</HI>
Majesty took in the just Ideas, which their Dis∣coveries,
and Experiments presented, and how
knowingly he would Discourse, even of those
things, which he had received no Notion of before.</P>
<P>THE Deputies of the Admiralty also shew'd their
respect to his Majesty, in causing every thing that
was curious, relating to Naval Affairs to be shew∣ed
him, and Artists of all kinds to be presented to
him.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the publick Audience of his
Ambassadors call'd him away to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where
he had the satisfaction of seeing their High-Migh∣tinesses
the States General do him the utmost
Honour in the Persons of his Ambassadors, and
even to out do themselves, no Audience having e∣ver
been known like it in that Country.</P>
<P>IT would be tiresome to relate the Magnifi∣cence
of their Reception all the way from <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
to the <HI>Hague,</HI> whether they and all their
Retinue went the latter End of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty also having Intimation of
the great Preparations the <HI>States-General</HI> made for
the Reception of his Embassy, and for Gracing
their Audience, resolv'd to make a suitable pre∣paration
for it on his Side; and therefore caused
his Ambassador to make three of the most Mag∣nificent
Coaches that could be made for Money,
and order'd them to buy Jewels likewise, and
Cloths the Richest that could be had, to en∣crease
their Retinue with about Forty more Ser∣vants,
and to Cloth them and all the rest in new
Liveries quite different from those they had be∣fore;
in a Word, he directed that every thing
should appear in the greatest splendor possible;
so that 'tis said the Expence cost above 200000
Dollars extraordinary.</P>
<P>ALL things being ready, and the Audience ap∣pointed,
they set out from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> the 24th of
<HI>September,</HI> and arriv'd at the <HI>Hague</HI> the same Day.</P>
<P>THEIR publick Entry was infinitely Superi∣or
to that at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> this being at the Ap∣pointment
of the <HI>States-General,</HI> the other only a
Reception of them by the Citizens and Magi∣strates
of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> and yet the particulars of
this part were not so publickly set down as the o∣ther,
what I have met with amounts to this.</P>
<P>THAT the Ambassadors were receiv'd at a di∣stance
from the <HI>Hague,</HI> where they had gone on
purpose for the Occassion, by five Deputies of the
<HI>States-General</HI> as Introductors of Ambassadors:
They were attended by the Reigment of Horse-Guards,
and two Battalions of the Guards of
Foot, call'd the Blew Guards; with two Coaches
of State, drawn by eight Horses each, for the Am∣bassadors,
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
and forty other Coaches with six Horses
each, for their Retinue.</P>
<P>THE Ambassadors were preceeded by forty
Gentlemen on Horseback, habited as <HI>Cossacks,</HI>
arm'd with Bows and Arrows, and thirty others as
<HI>Tartars,</HI> arm'd with Lances and Bows; all exceed∣ing
richly Cloth'd, but after the manner of their
own Countries: They had forty Pages in different
Livery, but all cover'd with Gold and Silver Lace
as rich as possible. Their immediate Guard were
as at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> Habited after the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
manner, carrying silver Battle-Axes in their
Hands, and Symetars with silver Hilts by their
Sides.</P>
<P>THE Ambassadors were in two Coaches of
State, and their own new magnificent Coaches
follow'd, having Thirty two Footmen in rich Li∣veries
walking on the Sides.</P>
<P>THE whole was follow'd with a numerous
Train of Coaches belonging to the Nobility and
Gentry, and to the foreign Ministers, of which
there are always a great many at the <HI>Hague,</HI> but
more especially at that Juncture, it being the time
of that <HI>Congress</HI> for the Peace with <HI>France,</HI> call'd
afterwards the Treaty at <HI>Ryswick.</HI></P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was in the Train in Dis∣guise,
wearing a plain blew Coat, a large white
Perriwig, and a white Feather; and being perfect∣ly
well acquainted both with the Person and ex∣traordinary
Merits of the Sieur <HI>Witsen</HI> (who was
that Year Burgomaster of <HI>Amsterdam</HI>) he borrow∣ed
his Coach, and desir'd him to Accompany him
thit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r; which was perform'd with so much Dex∣terity
and Secresy, by the said Sieur <HI>de Witsen,</HI>
that his Majesty was not discover'd by any body
living.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70"/>
IT was in the Month of <HI>September</HI> of the said
Year, when there was the greatest show of foreign
Ambassadors that ever was seen at the <HI>Hague,</HI> oc∣casion'd
by the Negotiation, <HI>as above,</HI> at <HI>Ryswick:</HI>
Thither most Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> had sent their
Plenipotentiaries, who all striving to out vie
one another in Magnificence. It was no easie Mat∣ter
to add any thing to the Splendor of their Equi∣pages;
yet his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty being sensible that
the Eyes of the World in a most peculiar manner
would be fix'd upon his Embassy; and being in∣vited
by a most commendabl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> emulation to main∣tain,
as well on that as other Occasions the glory
and lustre of his eminent Station in the World,
as claiming the Title of an Emperor, and bearing
the Imperial Arms; he was fully resolv'd that
this most solemn Embassy, honour'd by his Pre∣sence
should bear the Marks of, and be fully an∣swerable
to his high Station and Grandeur.</P>
<P>In effect according to the Testimony of all that
were Spectators of this solemn Audience, every thing
was manag'd with so much order, majesty and gra∣vity,
and with so much Magnificence, that nothing
could add to the Lustre of this Solemnity, which
in all Respects was suitable to his Majesty's De∣sign.</P>
<P>IT is confess'd by all Hands that never any
Ambassador appear'd in a more splendid Attire
then the General <HI>le Fort</HI> the <HI>first</HI> Ambassador did
that Day; he was clad after the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Fashi∣on,
in a long Robe of Cloth of Gold, lin'd with
the most precious Sables that ever were seen. This
Robe as well as the Vest which he wore under it,
was cover'd before with Diamonds in the Shape
of a Hern's feather, with such Luster as dazl'dthe
Eyes of the Beholders; he Harang'd their High and
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
Mightinesses in the <HI>Russian</HI> Tongue, with an Air
altogether Majestick, and suitable to the Cha∣racter
he bore upon so solemn an Occasion. The
two other Ambassadors, who appeared likewise in
very rich Apparel, made also their Compliments
to their High and Mightinesses with a Majestick
Gravity; but that which added the greatest Lustre
to the Audience, was, that all the Ambassadors of
most Princes in <HI>Europe,</HI> honoured these Men with
their Presence; and his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had the
satisfaction to be an Eye-witness of all that pas∣sed
from a Closet Window opening into the Au∣dience
Room, without being perceived by any
Body; and returned the next Day privately to
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> extremely well pleased with his Jour∣ney;
neither did their Excellencies make any long
stay in the <HI>Hague,</HI> they having no other matters
to propose to the States, but the confirming of
former Treaties.</P>
<P>THE Ceremonies now ended, the <HI>Czar</HI> not on∣ly
applyed himself to the Work he came about
as before, but all the Persons of Distinction which
he brought with him, dispers'd themselves according
to the different Commands he gave them; ap∣plying
themselves according as their different In∣clinations
led them, to the Knowledge of such
things as were needful, according to the Pattern
of their great Master.</P>
<P>THIS lessened the Retinue which at first ap∣peared
in the Embassy exceedingly; and yet the
Ambassadors retain'd an Equipage suitable to the
Character they bore, and suitable to the Glory of
their Master.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the <HI>Czar</HI> receiv'd an invita∣tion
very agreeable to him, which was to have an
Interview with the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> at that
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
time, the Glory of that part of the World, and
who had just finished, with Honour to himself,
and Satisfaction to all his Allies, a long and bloody
War with the King of <HI>France</HI> by the Treaty at
<HI>Ryswick.</HI></P>
<P>THE King came to <HI>Utrecht,</HI> where the <HI>Czar,</HI>
accompanied only with Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> and Ge∣neral
<HI>Le Fort,</HI> but all <HI>Incognito,</HI> went to see him;
these two mighty Monarchs receiv'd a mutual Sa∣tisfaction
in this interview, as both of them af∣terwards
testified: They continued some Hours to∣gether,
Monsieur <HI>Le Fort</HI> serving as an Interpre∣ter;
and here it was that his <HI>British</HI> Majesty in∣vited
the <HI>Czar</HI> to come and see his Court at <HI>Lon∣don;</HI>
and that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty accepted the
King's invitation, of which by it self.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty now having his full leisure for
the perfecting what he came about, he hir'd Ar∣tists
in <HI>Holland</HI> of several sorts, and giving them
very good Conditions, dispatch'd them for <HI>Mus∣cow,</HI>
some by Land, the Season not admitting to
go about by the North Cape to <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> and
some were maintain'd and employ'd in making
Models and Draughts for Building, 'till the Sea∣son
for going by Sea came on: In this manner they
were dispers'd many ways, some went to Schools or
Masters to learn Navigation and the Elements of
<HI>Euclid;</HI> others Bound themselves for terms of Years
to Artificers; in a word, none were Idle, the
<HI>Czar</HI> resolving to furnish himself and all his At∣tendants
with a Fund of Knowledge sufficient to
answer his End; and indeed considering his Ma∣jesty's
View, it was a very great Fund of Human
Learning that ought to be laid up, to carry home
and instruct a Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73"/>
IT was an immense Sum of Money that his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty laid out here in buying Tools
and Instruments for the Works, and several Trades
and Arts which he and his People were to put in
Practise; there was not a Handicraft of any Note,
that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty did not acquaint himself
more or less with, and with the manner of their
Working, no not from the making of a Watch to the
builder of a Ship; but it is to be noted, that the Ma∣rine
Affairs were those his chief Delight was in, and
which suited best with his Genius; and while he
was at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> he bought him a Yacht, with
which he diverted himself continually upon the
River and the <HI>Zuyderzee,</HI> till by Custom he learnt
to steer and work her as dexterously as the ablest
Seamen he could get.</P>
<P>HERE he also hir'd several Seamen and Offi∣cers,
and made them Captains and Lieutenants
of his Men of War, some of whom are in his Ser∣vice
to this Day.</P>
<P>ABOUT the of <HI>Septemb.</HI> 1698, he re∣solv'd
upon his Journey, or Voyage rather, to
<HI>England,</HI> and accordingly he arriv'd here in <HI>No∣vember</HI>
1698, of which presently.</P>
<P>BUT I should have noted here, that while his
Majesty remain'd at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> after he had been
at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and was return'd as above, he re∣ceiv'd
three Couriers from his Lords, to whom he
had left the Administration of the Government at
<HI>Muscow</HI> in his absence; bringing him the welcome
News of a great Victory obtain'd by his Army
under the Command of General <HI>Schein</HI> at <HI>Asoph</HI>
over the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI> The Particulars of
this Action, as they were then related, were as
follows, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74"/>
HIS Majesty first receiv'd an Express from
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> with the agreeable News of this Bat∣tel;
the other Accounts came some time after
by different ways: The <HI>Cham</HI> of the <HI>Crim Tar∣tars</HI>
had, in the beginning of the Spring,
caused great numbers of his Troops to pass in
many small Bodies, and at different times,
through <HI>Caffa,</HI> in order to join them with the
<HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Circassia,</HI> and especially those inha∣biting
near the River <HI>Cubanoc,</HI> knowing that the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Army was divided into several Bodies,
the better to cover the Workmen, who were em∣ploy'd
in several places, in compleating the be∣fore-mentioned
Fortifications, looking upon this
as a fit opportunity to surprize them unawares:
For this purpose he order'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> com∣manded
by <HI>Sultan Galga,</HI> to advance with great
and <HI>speedy</HI> Marches towards the <HI>Muscovites:</HI> But
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> General <HI>Schein</HI> having received intel∣ligence
of their approach, had just so much lei∣sure
given him as to draw down his Troops toge∣ther
in an advantageous Place, where he resolv'd
to engage the Enemy; these perceiving them∣selves
superior in number to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and
being encourag'd by the fancy'd fear of the <HI>Mus∣covite</HI>
Army, which did not move from their
Post, fell with great Fury upon them, and were
received with great Bravery by the <HI>Russians,</HI> who
were contented to defend themselves in their Post,
till their General perceiving the first heat of the
<HI>Tarters</HI> slacken, attacked them very briskly, put
them first into Confusion, and soon after to the
Rout, with a great Slaughter on the Enemy's
side, whom they pursued to the River <HI>Hagalinc,</HI>
were many of them were drown'd; this River
runs through <HI>Circassia,</HI> about two Leagues distant
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
from <HI>Asoph;</HI> tho' our Maps put this River to the
North on the other side of the River <HI>Don,</HI> above
thirty Leagues from <HI>Asoph.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR Excellencies the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Ambassa∣dors
made Publick Rejoicings upon this Occasion,
and invited the Magistrates of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and o∣ther
Persons of Quality to a magnificent Enter∣tainment,
where they were diverted with Dancing
and Musick, Fireworks, and all sorts of other Di∣vertisements:
His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was pleas'd to
appear there in Person, and in so pleasant a Hu∣mour,
all the Guess were extreamly satisfy'd
with his Goodness.</P>
<P>TOWARD the end of the Winter this Victory
was seconded by the News of another Advantage
obtain'd near the River <HI>Boristhenes;</HI> for the <HI>Crim
Tartars,</HI> in Conjunction with those of <HI>Budziack</HI>
and <HI>Oczakow,</HI> having besieged <HI>Kasikermeen,</HI> had
carried on their Trenches to the very Counter∣scarp,
and at the same time made themselves
Masters of the adjacent small Isle of <HI>Tomam;</HI> but
a Body of <HI>Muscovites</HI> having joined the <HI>Cossacks</HI> in∣habiting
those Frontiers, came time enough to the
Relief of the place, forcing the <HI>Tartars</HI> to aban∣don
the Siege, and that with a considerable Loss
on their side; upon which his Majesty gave or∣ders,
that the said Island should be strengthened
by some regular Fortifications.</P>
<P>ALL these Successes added to his Majesty's
Glory; and the more, in that they were obtain'd
in his Absence, as it was a Testimony that the
Government of his Affairs was left in good Hands,
and that he had made a right Choice of his Men,
with whom he had entrusted the Command of his
Armies, as well as of those to whom he had com∣mitted
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
the Administration of his Civil Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>THESE Advices were follow'd with other
Letters, giving him an Account of the progress
of his Engineers, and how well they had secur'd
and fortify'd the Places he had won; as well <HI>A∣soph</HI>
as <HI>Tuba, Kaisikermeen,</HI> and other Places; and
that the first of these <HI>especially,</HI> was put into such
a Posture that it might justly be esteemed one of
the strongest Fortresses of the World, particularly
that part which he had directed to be built in the
Morass mention'd above.</P>
<P>THIS was the more agreeable to the <HI>Czar,</HI> as
it was suitable to his wish, for that in a Word,
<HI>Asoph</HI> was the Center of all his vast Designs, and
he had as we may say, laid no less than a Scheme
for the Ruin of the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire in the
Gradations he had Projected from that one Place,
as will be seen hereafter.</P>
<P>WE are now to suppose his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty on
his Voyage to <HI>England,</HI> his <HI>Britanick</HI> Majesty sent
over several Yatches to bring him over with a
Man of War, or two for his Convoy, and he arriv'd
in the River of <HI>Thames</HI> the of <HI>October.</HI> 1697.</P>
<P>WHEN he came to <HI>London,</HI> the King omitted
nothing to show him that he had a very particular
esteem for him; indeed the Intent and Meaning
of his thus hazarding his Person in foreign Parts
for enabling himself to Government, and People
was a thing so inimitably great, and so praise
worthy in a Prince of his Rank, that it merited
all the regard, and all the Assistance that could
possibly be given him.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="77"/>
HIS <HI>Britanick</HI> Majesty at first offer'd the <HI>Czar</HI>
all the publick Honour due to his Character as a
Royal or Imperial Soveraign and Crown'd Head;
as particularly, his Majesty offer'd him <HI>Somerset-House</HI>
for his Residence, being a Pallace Royal,
and that he should be attended by the Officers of
the Royal Houshold, and that all the Expence of
his Kitchin, and of his Retinue should be de∣frayed;
that he should have a Detachment of the
<HI>English</HI> Houshold Troops for a Guard to his Per∣son,
and a certain Number of the King's Coaches
to attend him.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Czar</HI> after returning a very obliging
Answer, declin'd all those Honours; let his Ma∣jesty
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> know the Reasons of his
Resolution to be every where Incognito, and
how necessary it was to his Design in coming a∣broad;
that he came for Improvement, and had
no time to spend in Ceremony, receiving and
returning Visits, and the like.</P>
<P>HE therefore desir'd his <HI>Britanick Majesty</HI> that
he would suffer him to be as much conceal'd
as possible, and yet that he might have so much
of his Royal favour, as should admit him to see
what was proper for his Improvement in Maritime
Affairs, which was the principle thing that he
desir'd to Inspect, and which he found here was
manag'd even in a greater Perfection than in any
other part of the World.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Britanick</HI> Majesty was so extreamly
pleas'd with this, and with all the other Testi∣monies,
which the <HI>Czar</HI> gave of his Personal
Capacities, and his Genius to the things he came
to enquire after; and particularly, the truly no∣ble
End and Design of his enquiring after them;
that he immediately order'd that all possible En∣couragement,
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
and Assistance should be given his
Majesty; that he should be showed every thing that
he had a desire to see, and that all the Men of
Art should communicate every thing that his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty should desire to know: In a
Word, his <HI>Britanick</HI> Majesty let him know that
nothing should be wanting in <HI>England</HI> to give all
possible Assistance to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty in so
glorious a Search after Knowledge, and Wisdom,
and that he would do every thing that was in his
power to let him (the <HI>Czar</HI>) see what esteem he
(the King) had for him on that particular Ac∣count.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty after his letting the King
know his Resolution of remaining Private, took
a House, as proper, and as happily Situated for
such a purpose, as the whole City could hardly have
afforded such another, considering its being a well
built commodious House also; for as it had a good
front Gate to bring a Coach to, in the <HI>Great-Row,</HI>
of <HI>Norfolk-street,</HI> in the <HI>Strand;</HI> so it had a pri∣vate
pair of Stairs to the River, peculiar to the
House only; where Boats could come even at low
Water to set him on shore, or take him in, as he
thought fit, and so that it was scarce possible to
the People to see him go or come.</P>
<P>WHILE he resided here, he had frequent In∣terviews
with the King, and made some Visits
to the Princess <HI>Ann,</HI> afterwards Queen; went to
see <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle, <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and other
publick Places; was particularly shew'd the <HI>Tower</HI>
of <HI>London,</HI> and all the Varieties there, where he
was particularly taken with the Great Armory,
and the admirable Order of the placeing
the small Arms, and Furniture for Horse and
Foot; and epsecially the keeping the Arms so
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
clean, well fix'd, and ready for Service; and, as
we hear, has appointed one to be Built after the
same manner at <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> and to be furnish'd
with small Arms for an Hundred Thousand
Men.</P>
<P>AT the same time he was accommodated at
<HI>Deptford</HI> with an Apartment which had a private
Door into the King's Yard and Wet Dock, and
a way also into the Merchant's Yards and Wet
Docks, on the way from <HI>Deptford</HI> to <HI>Redriff;</HI> by
which he had opportunity to see every part of the
Builders Art exemplifyed; and which was most
delightful to his Majesty, the Master Builders
having express, Orders to oblige his Majesty as
much as possible, laid before him their Moulds
and Draughts, and the accurate Method by which
they fitted every piece of Timber, and directed
the building of the largest Ships of War.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was so extremely pleas'd
with that part, whether it was that their Method
was not so good in <HI>Holland,</HI> or that they did not
let him so far into the Secret of their Art, I know
not; but he was pleas'd to declare, that our
Building far exceeded all that he had seen before,
and that he was resolv'd to make the <HI>English</HI> Men
of War be the Pattern by which all his own Ships
should be built, and to have his Builders instruct∣ed
to work their Models the same way; and I am
informed, he made himself so much Master of
the Method, that he has since drawn the first
Draught of his largest Men of War with his own
Hand.</P>
<P>AFTER this his Majesty the King of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> ordered Admiral <HI>Mitchel</HI> to go down to
<HI>Portsmouth,</HI> where there then lay a Squadron of
Men of War, and caus'd them to be form'd into
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
two Fleets, and to show the <HI>Czar</HI> the manner of
an Engagement at Sea, making them draw out
and Engage, tho' without firing with Ball.</P>
<P>HERE his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty being on board the
Admiral's Ship, was shewed the manner of two
Fleet's preparing to Fight, their Unmooring, their
Scouts giving Signal to the Fleet, the Admiral
giving Signal to draw up in a Line, and when to
engage; their striving for the Weather-gage, bear∣ing
down upon the Enemy, standing off and on to
keep out of the Fight, keeping the Line, putting
off of Fireships, and attacking with Fireships;
firing Broadsides, clapping one another aboard,
lying thwart Hawse, coming up under the Stern,
and pouring in Broadsides upon a Ship's Quarter
or Bow, and in short, all the ways of taking Ad∣vantage
of an Enemy in Fight.</P>
<P>THIS was perform'd with so much Order, so
Dexterously, and so without the least Dammage,
that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty profess'd himself exceed∣ing
well pleas'd with it; and that much more than
he was with something of the same kind offered
him in <HI>Holland,</HI> which being performed also by
smaller Vessels, could not so well explain the Par∣ticulars
necessary to be known for the ordering a
Sea-fight with Capital Ships.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Czar</HI> employ'd his time in <HI>England,</HI>
viewing every thing that was Curious, and enter∣ing
into due Enquiries after those things, which
he found most necessary for his Purpose, as parti∣cularly,
besides what I have mentioned above, he
was very curious in his viewing the Mint, and
Essaying the Metals, reducing them to the Stan∣dard
Value, the Melting-house, the Flatting Mill,
the Stamping, and the Dye, or Stamp which
makes the Impression. Likewise he went to the
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he saw the publick
Libraries, the manner of disposing the Books and
Manuscripts; view'd the Rarities, and particular∣ly
the Printing-house, which he was so pleas'd
with, that he caused all the Materials, and all the
Utensils for setting up the like, to be Bought,
with Fonts of Letters of every size, and of every
Character, resolving to set up a Printing-house at
<HI>Muscow</HI> and at <HI>Petersbourgh,</HI> which I am assur'd he
has since brought to pass.</P>
<P>HIS stay in <HI>England</HI> was about three Months,
during which time he improved himself so much
in all the Parts of those Sciences, which he apply∣ed
himself to look into, that a learned Person
who convers'd with him freely, said publickly,
that an ordinary Proficient would not obtain so
much in three Year.</P>
<P>AT his going away his Majesty presented the
<HI>Czar</HI> with a fine Yacht or Frigate built for his
own particular use, for his passing and re-passing
between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> being not only a
beautiful and finely finished Vessel, but an ex∣cellent
Sailer; carrying 24 Brass Guns, and most
richly painted and guilded; in which Vessel his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, after taking leave of the King and
the Princess, and with great Professions of mutual
Kindness and Satisfaction in what had pass'd, set
Sail for <HI>Holland,</HI> and arriv'd safe at the <HI>Brill,</HI>
tho' not without some hazard, in the Voyage,
having had very bad Weather in his Passage.</P>
<P>ALL the while his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
he employ'd some <HI>English Russia</HI> Merchants
to Hire for him, and Contract with as many of
the best Master Builders, Caulkers, Carvers, and
the like of other Trades, which were generally
employ'd in finishing and fitting out Ships in or∣der
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
to send them to <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and his Majesty
left Commissioners with the same Merchants to
Contract with others after he was gone, and to
send them after him, which was done to his con∣tent;
and 'tis by the help of these very Men
chiefly, that the <HI>Czar</HI> has at this time so many
Ships, as well Capital Men of War, from 50 to 96
Guns, as light Fregates, Brigantines, Transport-Ships,
and the like; which they have built, and
are still ever building at <HI>Croonslot</HI> and <HI>Petersburgh,</HI>
where the <HI>Czar,</HI> who at that time had not a Ship,
or a Port in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> has now such a Fleet, and
so well Mann'd, as no Prince ever had before him
in so short a while; and we have News from thence
just at the writing of these Sheets, that his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty has built at the Port of <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> and
other adjacent Place, no less then six Men of
War, from 76 to 98 Guns, which are some of
them Lanch'd, and the others almost ready to
Lanch, and will be ready for the approaching
Summers Expedition.</P>
<P>ALL this while his Ambassadors remained at
the <HI>Hague,</HI> except that Monsieur <HI>La Fort</HI> had
been allow'd to go over to <HI>England</HI> with the
<HI>Czar,</HI> in a private Capacity, and return'd to <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
again a little before him.</P>
<P>AND now having finish'd his enquires, and
having viewed every thing that was curious, and
Improving as well in <HI>England,</HI> as in <HI>Holland;</HI> set∣tled
Amity and a good Understanding between
himself, and both those Nations, and having far∣ther
Progress to make, especially, resolving to
see the Imperial Court at <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Senate, and
City of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the Antiquities of <HI>Rome</HI> and
<HI>Italy</HI> he prepar'd to be gone.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="83"/>
I SHALL omit the particulars of his Passage from
<HI>Holland,</HI> thro' <HI>Germany</HI> to <HI>Vienna</HI> first, because it
would spin out this Work too far in the Affairs
of least Consequence, and perhaps straiten us for
Room in those of moreweight: And Secondly, be∣cause
we have not a full Account of all the parts
of the Rout he took come to Hand: It may suffice
to say that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty arriv'd at <HI>Vienna,</HI>
about the 10th of <HI>June</HI> with his Ambassadors, and
all their Train, as before; having been receiv'd, with
particular Marks of Respect and Distinction, in
all his Passage thro' the Empire: As to <HI>France</HI> his
Majesty distinguish'd himself so much in Favour
of the Confederates, as not so much as to set
his Foot in any part of <HI>France,</HI> nor to have the
least Intentions of seeing that Court, which values
itself so much upon its being the Center, and the
Scene of all Peoples curiosity.</P>
<P>HIS Imperial Majesty came immediately into
the same Sentiments, as to the <HI>Czar</HI>'s design of Tra∣vel
as others had done, esteeming it an Action tru∣ly
glorious and worthy a Monarch of the highest
Rank in the World, and resolv'd therefore to show
to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty all the Respect, and do him
all the Honours the Imperial Court was capable of.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> and his Ambassadors continu'd in
a particular Lodging appointed for them till the
26th, having first notify'd their arrival in form
as Ambassadors; they had the Pallace of <HI>Gun∣dersdoff,</HI>
belonging to the Count <HI>de Koningsec,</HI>
where they remain'd till the 26th, when they
made their publick Entry with their usual Mag∣nificence.</P>
<P>THE Ambassadors went to a Place call'd Mount
<HI>Tabor,</HI> whence the show was appointed to set
out, and Commissioners were sent thither to re∣ceive
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
them attended by a Party of Dragoons of
the Guards.</P>
<P>THE March began with the Trumpets and
Kettle-Drums, belonging to the States of the
Province, follow'd by two Companies of Dra∣goons,
and some Imperial Officers; after them
the Ambassadors Trumpets in rich Liveries, as
also the Pages and Footmen in the same; thence
proceeded a great Number of Coaches and six
Horses, of the Lords of the Court, which were fol∣low'd
by two of the Emperors Coaches. The first
for Princes that came along with the Ambassa∣dors.
The second for the Ambassadors themselves,
and the Imperial Commissioners; surrounded with
Hey-dukes bearing their Maces, and followed by
Pages on Horseback, and other domestick Servants,
and three noble Coaches belonging to the Ambas∣sadors.
Which with a vast Train of Coaches be∣longing
to the principal Persons in the Imperial
Court, followed by another Detatchment of Dra∣goons,
clos'd the Cavalcade.</P>
<P>THE 29th of the same Month, the Ambassa∣dors
had a private Audience of the Emperor; and
here, tho' incognito, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty appear'd
with his Ambassadors, <HI>that is to say,</HI> went as one
of their Train, after the Audience of the Am∣bassadors,
which was matter of Ceremony, the
<HI>Czar</HI> in particular was admitted to an Enterview
without them.</P>
<P>WHILE the Ambassadors had their Audience,
the Emperor stood for some time cover'd; but af∣terward
sat down, and desir'd the Ambassadors to
sit also, but they excused themselves which they did
more particularly, in regard to the Presence of
their own Soveraign, who being near them, must
have been standing, while they had sat down,
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
which the Emperor presently understanding to
be the Reason, rose up also himself and receiv'd
them standing; Monsieur <HI>Le Fort</HI> made his Ha∣range
here in Latin, which the other two Ambas∣sadors
spoke in the <HI>Russian</HI> Tongue, and the Empe∣ror
answer'd in Latin, which by the way, his Impe∣rial
Majesty spoke very fluently.</P>
<P>WHEN they were dismiss'd, the <HI>Czar</HI> and Ge∣neral
<HI>Le Fort</HI> (no more being admitted) went to the
Interview with his Imperial Majesty. They went
in by a back Pair of Stairs from the Chamber of
Audience, when the <HI>Czar</HI> advancing, his Imperial
Majesty receiv'd him at the Door of his Anti-Chamber.</P>
<P>AFTER the first Complements the Emperor
put on his Hat; but seeing the <HI>Czar</HI> refus'd to be
cover'd, because he was incognito, his Imperial
Majesty uncover'd also; no Body was present at
this Interview, but the Count <HI>Deichtenstein</HI> grand
Chamberlain to the Emperor, and the Count <HI>de
Dictrickstein</HI> his Grand 'Squire, with general <HI>Le
Fort,</HI> who serv'd as the <HI>Czars</HI> Interpreter; and
then it was that the <HI>Czar</HI> took his opportunity to
impart to the Emperor the Letters he had re∣ceiv'd,
which gave him an Account, how that
eight Thousand of his Garrison of <HI>Asoph</HI> had ta∣ken
thirty Thousand Horses from the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
after they had defeated a Body of three Thousand
Men that Guarded them.</P>
<P>THE 6th of <HI>July,</HI> the Count of <HI>Staremberg,</HI>
Camp-marshal General of the Emperor's Ar∣mies,
and President of the Council of War,
gave the <HI>Czar</HI> and his Ambassadors a magnificient
Collation, accompani'd with a Consort of Musick,
and after that a noble Ball; where were present
he principal Lords, and Ladies of the Court; the
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
9th being the Festival of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> the Name
which was given to the <HI>Czar</HI> in Baptism, the
same Prince gave a great Feast, and a Ball in
<HI>Guntersdorf</HI> House, the Emperor sent him his Mu∣sick
and order'd lovely Fire-Works to be made
ready, which were play'd off in the Evening, to
augment the Divertisement of the Feast; the
same Day his Imperial Majesty sent a Present of
all manner of Mathematical Instruments to the
<HI>Czar,</HI> who two Days after went to see the Armo∣ry,
the Libraries, the Pictures, and all the other
Rarieties of the Imperial Palace.</P>
<P>UPON the 21st was a great Feast in the Palace <HI>de
le Favorite,</HI> which began with a Ball, and a Con∣sort
of Musick, afterwards a splendid Col∣lation;
then another Ball, which lasted all
Night, till break of Day; every Masker was in
the Habit of a different Nation; so that all the
most noted Nations of the World were there re∣presented,
and every Prince or Lord had a Lady
by his Side in answerable Habits of the same Nat∣tion;
and the Habits made of rich Stuffs, sparkling
with precious Stones; so that in the memory of
Man, a Sight so Magnificient had not been seen
their.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, who represented an Host, with
two and thirty Pages, habited like Butlers, drank
in a most lovely Glass, the Countryman of <HI>oest
Frise</HI>'s Health, who was represented by the chief
of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Princes; saying at the same time,
that he knew well his extraordinary Zeal for the
<HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> and on the other Side, the Coun∣tryman
of <HI>Oest Frise</HI> drank the Host in Disguise's
Health; saying at the same time, that he was not
ignorant of his inviolable Affection for the Em∣peror;
after which his imperial Majesty reply'd
that he gave the Glass to the Countryman of <HI>Oest
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
Frese,</HI> desiring him to preserve it carefully in
Memory of the Healths drank in such good
Company.</P>
<P>UPON the 29th the grand Embassy had their
publick Audience, to which they were conducted
in the following Manner. First march'd a Com∣pany
of Foot, follow'd by six Trumpeters belong∣ing
to the Embassy, clad in rich Liveries, after
the <HI>German</HI> mode, those were follow'd by fifteen
of the Court Coaches, wherein rode the <HI>Musco∣vite</HI>
Lords, in their own Country Habit, and
others after the <HI>French</HI> dress; after these came
fifty Burghers, clad in black Velvet, bearing the
Presents design'd for his Imperial Majesty, which
consisted in a great Number of lovely Ermins
and Furs, Sables, Cloath of Gold and Silver,
and a Harness enrich'd with Pearl; after this rode
a <HI>Muscovite</HI> a Horseback, carrying the Letters of
Credence, follow'd by one of the Emperor's
Coaches; wherein the Embassadors rode, together
with his Imperial Majesty's Commissioners. This
Coach was surrounded and attended by Pages and
other in Liveries belonging as well to the Ambas∣sadors
as to the Grandees of the Court, who with the
Ambassadors Coaches clos'd the March; the Am∣bassadors
entering into the Court of the Palace
<HI>de le Favorite</HI> found the Guards in Arms, and were
conducted to the Hall of Audience, with the ac∣custom'd
Ceremonies, after which they were mag∣nificently
Treated at the Emperors Charges, and so
Conducted back to the Place where they lay.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> was just upon his departure for <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI>
in his way to <HI>Rome,</HI> and had already sent
eight Persons of his Train before, but at the very
time he was preparing to depart; he was con∣strain'd
to alter his Resolution, and to take Post
for <HI>Muscow,</HI> with a Train of between thirty and
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
forty Horse, upon Advice of a revolt of several
Malecontents within his Dominions, and that if
he did not speedily return, by his Presence to
put a stop to the Current of the Commotion, he
might unhappily find all the Passages stop'd.</P>
<P>WE are now come to the End of this unexam∣pled
Journey, <HI>viz.</HI> the Travels of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and his
Ambassadors, in a Circle of near 2000 Miles, not in∣cluding
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Trip to <HI>England:</HI> It
is now time to look back to <HI>Muscovy:</HI> His <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty had received several Expresses from his
Generals at <HI>Asoph,</HI> of their successful Encounters
with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and just before he left the
<HI>Hague,</HI> where his Ambassadors had their Audience
of leave, there arriv'd another Courier with an
Account, that General <HI>Gordon</HI> had very happily
suppress'd a kind of an Insurrection of 10000 of
the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> and had kill'd 3500 of them upon
the Spot, and taken almost all the rest of them
Prisoners; that he had Decimated the Prisoners, and
hang'd every Tenth Man upon the Field of Bat∣tle,
had retain'd in Prison the rest, with se∣veral
of their Ringleaders, and some of the No∣bility
who had Fomented their insolence, and in a
Word, had effectually suppress'd the Rebellion.</P>
<P>IN the Neck of this came another from <HI>Asoph,</HI>
with the News, that a Detachment of 8000 Men
from the Garison of that City had defeated 6000
<HI>Tartars,</HI> who had been Posted as a Guard to the
<HI>Tartar's</HI> Horses, who were put into the Marshes
on the Frontiers of <HI>Circassia,</HI> and had taken no
less than 30000 Horses of which mention is made,
as above.</P>
<P>BUT all these good Tidings had their Allay,
and the last News his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty receivd,
was such as intimated the Danger to be very
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
great, and that they fear'd a general Insurrection,
entreating him to hasten back, not only that by his
Presence he might encourage his faithful Subjects,
but that he might arrive before the Conspirators
should be able to get a Force together, and seize
upon the Passes, and Entrances into his Country,
and either make it impracticable for him to return,
or perhaps make him run the Danger of falling
into the Hands of his Enemies in the attempt.</P>
<P>It will easily be granted that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty
had Reason to use the utmost Expedition
in his Return, and indeed upon that Expedition
depended his success; for the celerity or swiftness
of his Return was such, that the Conspirators saw
him in the Castle or Pallace of <HI>Muscow,</HI> sur∣rounded
with his Army, and ready to fall upon
them before they thought it had been possible
that he could so much as have any Account of
their proceedings.</P>
<P>THIS was such a surprize to them as broke all
their Measures; for the <HI>Czar</HI> fell to work with
them, the very Moment he arrived, and particu∣larly
with those who General <HI>Gordon</HI> had in Cu∣stody;
for first his Majesty order'd that the princi∣pal
Contrivers and Encouragers of the said Rebel∣lion
should be brought before him, and after he
had himself re-examin'd them, they having before
been condemn'd in a full Hearing before all the
Lords; they were all Sentenc'd to Death, among
whom were Prince <HI>Colorin,</HI> General <HI>Romanodos∣lowski,</HI>
with several Ladies of Quality, and Friars
and Priests of the first Rank, some of them were be∣headed,
some broke upon the Wheel, others bu∣ried
alive, and the aforesaid <HI>Strelitzes</HI> or Soldiers,
whe had actually march'd and fought against the
<HI>Czar's</HI> Arms, and who had ever since the <HI>Czar's</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
first coming to the Crown upon all occasions been
in the Plots and Intreagues of the Princess
<HI>Sophia,</HI> and the Party that adhered to her, and
had in several Instances shew'd their will and
readiness to revolt upwards of 2000 of them
were executed, some their Heads taken of in the
publick Market-place, others hung up upon Gal∣lowses
erected on purpose at the Gates of all the
three Walls round the City, with the Crimes
writ upon the Gallows: This Execution being per∣form'd
in the depth of Winter, their Bodies were
immediately bury'd; those that were beheaded, were
order'd to lie in the same posture, as their Heads
were cut off, in Ranks upon the ground, with
their Heads lying by them; and those which were
hang'd round the Walls of the City were left
hanging, the whole Winter in the same posture to
the view of the People, till the warm Weather
began to come on in the Spring, and then they
were taken down and buried in a Pit together, to
prevent the infection of the Air.</P>
<P>THERE was likewise other Gibbets plac'd on all
the publick Roads leading to <HI>Muscow,</HI> at about two
Miles distance, where others of these Rebels
were hang'd, and a large Monument of Stone
erected upon the several Roads, with the De∣scription
of their Crimes deeply engraven, and
order'd to be repair'd and kept up for ever, and
the very Houses wherein they had liv'd were or∣der'd
to be raz'd to the ground, and the Name of
<HI>Strelitzes</HI> to be no more made use of in the Army
of <HI>Russia</HI> forever, but being chang'd, from that
time they were call'd <HI>Soldatee</HI> or <HI>Soldiers;</HI> such of
the <HI>Strelitzes</HI> that were judg'd most Innocent, or
not so deeply involv'd in the guilt with the rest,
having their Lives given them, were some sent
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
to <HI>Siberia,</HI> others banish'd to <HI>Astracan, Asoph,</HI> and
all the out Parts of the Kingdom, with their
Wives and Families and others of their near Re∣lations
to suffer with them, as it is the way of
most of the Eastern Countries.</P>
<P>THUS his Majesty upon his return from his Tra∣vels
by the example of so vigorous a Proceeding
having surpress'd the Enemies to his Government,
it was the more easie for him to go on with these
things, which he had resolv'd upon for the reforming
his Country; he began first, with establishing his
Guards, which were those Regiments that were fix'd
in the Place of the aforesaid <HI>Strelitzes;</HI> then put
his whole Army upon a new Foot, form'd a new Dis∣cipline,
which he had collected from what he had
observ'd Abroad, and he order'd all his Army to be
regularly Cloath'd, with some distinction in the
Colour and Trimming of the Cloaths like the cu∣stom
of other Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> this had not till
now been done in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> but every one wore his
Claths according to his own Fancy; he order'd
also an Account to be brought to him of such Per∣sons
of the Nobility and Gentry of considerable
Estates, who were not in any Service or Employ∣ment;
out of which he commanded a great part
to go and serve as Voluntiers in the Army, and
others he order'd to attend, and appointed them
Duty in several Stations, some in Equipping his
Navy, and others order'd to go and reside at the
frontier Garrisons, that if they did no good, they
might be out of the way of doing any Mischef.</P>
<P>WHEN he had thus dispos'd things in <HI>Moscow,</HI>
with Relation to his Army, he went down himself
to <HI>Veronize</HI> to view those Ships and Gallies that
were built there by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in his Absence, and
to hasten the Equipment of his Fleet that was prepa∣ring
for the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> he made those <HI>English</HI> that he
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
had brought over with him chief Master-builders,
and discharg'd all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Builders, except what
were to finish the Ships which they had begun, and
those were left under the Command of the <HI>English,</HI>
Ordering that there should be none but <HI>English</HI> fa∣shion'd
Ships to be built for the future; one of which
being a Ship of 50 Guns, his Majesty himself im∣mediately,
as soon as he came there set upon the
Stocks, by a Draught which he had drawn with his
own Hands; and so contriv'd her by an Invention
of his own, that tho' the Keel should be knock'd off,
the Ship should be Tight as he propos'd; which
Ship when he had advanc'd a little way, he left
to be carried on by two young <HI>Russian</HI> Gentle∣men,
that had been Abroad with him, and learn∣ed
to build Ships along with his Majesty; only he
left Orders for them to ask sometimes Advice of
the <HI>English</HI> Builders, when there was any occasion
for it; he left also Orders at <HI>Veronize</HI> with Vice
Admiral <HI>Cruss,</HI> and Real Admiral <HI>Raes,</HI> together
with the Sea Captains, Officers and Seamen that
he had taken into his Service in <HI>Holland,</HI> before
he went over to <HI>England,</HI> and who were now
arriv'd in <HI>Veronize</HI> to get those Ships and Gallies
that were built there, rigg'd and ready fitted, to
Sail down to <HI>Asoph,</HI> whither he intended to go
with them in the Spring of the Year, together with
his Favorite <HI>le Fort,</HI> who tho' he knew nothing
of the Sea, was declar'd Admiral.</P>
<P>WHEN his Majesty had thus settled the Affairs
of his Navy, as he had before done of his Army, he
return'd back again to <HI>Muscow,</HI> where besides what
he had done at his first coming over, he made a
Choice of Lords to be of his Council, and begun
to regulate Affairs in Government, both in the
Church, and in the State.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93"/>
AND now we are to Enter in the Course of his
Majesty's History on a new Scene of Action, and
of a differing kind from what he had ever known
before: Hitherto all his Enterprises had been at∣tended
with an uninterrupted Course of Success;
his Wars with the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> happening
at a time when the <HI>Turkish</HI> Power seem'd to be in
a <HI>Crisis,</HI> went all to his Content, and Victory at∣tended
his Arms upon all occasions.</P>
<P>BUT now his Majesty had another kind of E∣nemy
to deal with, I mean the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI>
whose Fume, tho' yet it had made no Noise in the
World, yet he was attended with a well disciplin'd
Army, a Nation fierce and daring, whose Reputa∣tion
in Arms, was equal, if not Superior to the
most glorious Nations in the World.</P>
<P>WHEN his Majesty, as I have observed, went
from <HI>Vienna</HI> in haste to <HI>Muscow,</HI> he was not how∣ever
so much alarm'd with the News of his Rebel∣lious
Subjects, but that he found room in his
Thoughts as well as leisure in his speed, for a short
Interview with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> thro' whose
Dominions he was necessarily oblig'd to pass.</P>
<P>A LITTLE time may contrive what a great
many Years may be employ'd to Execute; here in
a few Hours they concerted that dreadful War be∣tween
them, and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> which pro∣ved
at first so fatal to them both, and which in
its whole Course was fatal to all the Northern
Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> destructive to the whole Coun∣tries
and in which first and last above 500000
People have lost their Lives; nay, I have heard
it affirm'd that <HI>Sweden</HI> alone has by this very
War been drein'd of 300000 Men to the irrepara∣ble
Desolation of that Kingdom, and we shall
find abundant of Reason to believe that <HI>Poland</HI> and
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> and the <HI>Provinces</HI> adjoyning, put them
all to gether have lost a much greater Number.</P>
<P>IT was not however till the Year 1700, that
the War between the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was openly declar'd after there had
been a seeming renewing of the Peace between
them the Year before.</P>
<P>THIS War they say was concerted between
the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty at
this Interview, and the Measures agreed on; also
how the same should be prosecuted, and some Mea∣sures
too for the engaging the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
in the League; which proposal afterwards prov'd
Successful, <HI>that is to say,</HI> Successful to bring the
King of <HI>Denmark</HI> in, but Unsuccessful to all the
three in the beginning of it, as will appear in the
prosecution of the Story.</P>
<P>IT was now in the Year 1699, when the <HI>Czar</HI>
had spent about eight Months at Home, and
News was brought him to <HI>Muscow,</HI> that his Ple∣nipotenaries
had concluded a Truce with the <HI>Turks</HI>
at <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> where at the same time, the Peace
between the <HI>Turks</HI> and the other Allies, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the
Emperor, the King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the State of <HI>Ve∣nice</HI>
had been concluded.</P>
<P>IT was suggested that the <HI>Czar</HI> desir'd that tho'
the other Allies made a Treaty for 25 Years with
the <HI>Turks,</HI> that yet his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's part should
be no more than a kind of Truce for two Years; and
that he did this, that he might have time in those
two Years to compleat the Fortifications of <HI>Asoph,
Kaisikermeen,</HI> and other Places; and to build a power∣with
ful Fleet of Men of War at <HI>Veroneze,</HI> with
which at the end of the two Years, he doubted not
to be able to dispute the Lordship of the <HI>Black Sea</HI>
with the Grand <HI>Seignior,</HI> and to bring him to
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
grant a Passage for his Subjects through the <HI>Boss∣phor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>
into the <HI>Levant</HI> Seas.</P>
<P>BUT this was a bluster which his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty had no Hand in, and 'tis apparent it was
the <HI>Turks,</HI> who declin'd a Truce with <HI>Muscovy</HI> for
any longer than two Years, purposing as it was
apparent afterward that when they had got the
<HI>Hungarian, Venetian</HI> and <HI>Polish</HI> War off of their Hands,
they would fall upon the <HI>Czar</HI> with all their
Forces for the Recovery of <HI>Asoph, &amp;c.</HI> But the
<HI>Czar,</HI> who was sensible how heavy such a War
would be upon him, at least till he had brought
his Army into all the new Measures he had de∣sign'd,
apply'd immediately to the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
who was Mediator of that Treaty to give
Instructions to his Plenipotentiaries at the Treaty,
to insist that the Peace with <HI>Muscovy,</HI> might
have the same Duration of 25 Years, as the Peace
with the Emperor had, which his <HI>Britanick</HI> Ma∣jesty
did, and obtained it for him accordingly,
which we shall see in a little time acknowledged
under his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's own Hand.</P>
<P>ACCORDINLY the Treaty was, I <HI>say,</HI> conclud∣ed
at <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> and immediately the <HI>Czar</HI> began
the War against the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for the same
Day that the Peace with the <HI>Turks</HI> was proclaim'd
at <HI>Muscovy,</HI> the same Day the War was proclaim'd
against <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE nothing to do to enter here into a Dis∣quisition
of the Justice of this War, or of the
particular Causes moving the <HI>Czar</HI> to engage in it:
That his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was Agressor, that we
do not dispute, one of the Causes assign'd was the
Affront offer'd his Ambassadors at <HI>Riga,</HI> which
considering that his Majesty himself was in Per∣son
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
in the Train, was speaking the Language of
Princes a very great Indignity to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty,
and sufficient to demand Satisfaction upon.</P>
<P>IN Consequence however of having declar'd
War, it behov'd his Majesty to make suitable
Preparations, for that he knew that he had a vi∣gilant
and gallant King to deal with, tho' but a
young Man, and that he was the Head of a brave
People, had a good Army of old, and disciplind
Soldiers on Foot, led by some of the ablest Gene∣ral
in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was young,
and far off, and that the Alliance was strong, even
three-fold, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had room to expect
he might have made a considerable Progress be∣fore
any Number could be brought against him,
that would be to any purpose.</P>
<P>THIS was began with the beginning of the
Year 1700, and his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty drew toge∣ther
such a Body of Men, that had they been well
manag'd, would have been sufficient to havewith
stood a much greater Force than those they were to
deal with; but the desperate Bravery of the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
and the exact Discipline of their Troops struck
such a Terror in the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> that in a Word,
there was no Opposing them, nor any bringing
the Troops to keep their Array, when push'd
with the violence of an Army of Men, that knew
how to die, and how to Conquer, but had not yet
been taught to fly.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI>'s Troops were wonderfully improv'd,
and infinitely better than they us'd to be, but,
were not yet come to a perfection suitable to the
Work they had now before them; or to be a
Match for the <HI>Swedes;</HI> but as they had been put
into a Method of improving, yet farther we shall
<PB N="96" REF="97"/>
find them in time be taught by the <HI>Swedes</HI> the
way of fighting, till they came to be a Match for
any Body, and at last learn'd to beat their Ma∣sters.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Romans</HI> by often beating the barba∣rous
Nations, such as the <HI>Gauls,</HI> the <HI>Goths,</HI> the
<HI>Vandals,</HI> and the <HI>Huns,</HI> taught them the <HI>Roman</HI> dis∣cipline,
and manner of Fighting; till those Na∣tions
return'd Instructed how to Fight, and beat
their Teachers, not out of their Empire only, but
even out of the World.</P>
<P>IN order to Introduce the History of this ter∣rible
War in such a manner, as the Reader may
be fully inform'd of every Action, and of the na∣ture
and reason of things, as he goes along with
the Fact; it will be necessary to look a little into
the State of Affairs in those Northern Parts of the
World in General, at that time, and how it came
to pass that those three Powers, the <HI>Danes,</HI> the
<HI>Poles,</HI> and the <HI>Muscovites</HI> broke at once with <HI>Swe∣den;</HI>
and how their Interest and Forces came so to
be disjointed and separated, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> had
opportunity to attack them singly, and deprive
them of the Capacity of Succouring or Assisting
one another, and this I shall do as concisely as
I can.</P>
<P>AT first his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty did not appear in
this Quarrel; but the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the
King of <HI>Denmark</HI> both at once, whether declaring
War, or not declaring War, is not the Question,
having an Alliance for that Purpose, fell both of
them upon the King of <HI>Sweden:</HI> The King of <HI>Poland</HI>
march'd in Person at the Head of a powerful and
experienc'd Army of <HI>Saxons,</HI> out of <HI>Poland</HI> direct∣ly
for <HI>Courland;</HI> from whence he continu'd his
March, and the 28th of July, 1700 pass'd the
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
<HI>Dwina,</HI> enter'd into <HI>Livonia,</HI> the Dominions of
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and having beaten Count
<HI>Welling</HI> the <HI>Swedish</HI> General, and the few Forces
he had with him, advanc'd towards <HI>Riga,</HI> and in∣vested
the Town, took the <HI>Dunamunder Schans,</HI>
began to Bombard the Town, but was prevail'd,
with to spare it, in respect to the Effects of the
Foreign Merchants, as was given out, who were his
Allies, and so Cantoning his Forces held the Town,
as it were Blocked up, resolving to attack it in
Form the beginning of the next Year.</P>
<P>AT the same time the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> ha∣ving
attack'd the Duke of <HI>Holsteins</HI> Fort at <HI>Husum;</HI>
and Bombarded <HI>Toningen,</HI> made no difficulty to
speak openly of a Rupture with <HI>Sweden,</HI> and to ac∣knowledge
that he was engag'd in Alliance with
the King of <HI>Poland:</HI> The <HI>Czar</HI> all this while lay
still, and made a seeming offer of continuing
Peace with <HI>Swede;</HI> but civily demanded the
Town and Port of <HI>Narva</HI> for the Convenience of
having a Trade for his Subjects into the <HI>Baltick,</HI>
which at that time was the great thing that the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> desir'd.</P>
<P>WHEN the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> had openly de∣clar'd
himself, and the King of <HI>Poland</HI> had actually
attack'd <HI>Riga,</HI> then the <HI>Czar</HI> as had been concert∣ed
between them at the enterview I mention'd, re∣solv'd
to declare himself also, and accordingly
as I have observ'd before; the War against <HI>Sweden,</HI>
was Proclaim'd at <HI>Muscovy</HI> the same day that the
Peace with the <HI>Turks</HI> was also Proclaimed.</P>
<P>BEFORE I go on here, I must pay a Debt
which is the reward of Vertue, and which so much
Merit demands from every faithful Histiorian, I
mean a Debt to the Memory of that truly great
and wise Man General <HI>Le Fort;</HI> a Man to whom
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
the <HI>Czar</HI> owes much of the true Notions of Vertue,
and Honour, which he took in at his first Entrance
upon his Government, who always gave him just
and solid Ideas of things, and who prompted him to
all the great Actions of his Life, and who died
a little before these new Measures were taken.</P>
<P>THIS great Man was really treated by the
<HI>Czar</HI> according to his Merit, for he valu'd him a∣bove
any of the greatest Men in his whole Em∣pire,
and depended entirely upon his Council in
the most difficult Cases that came before him; he
was the principal Agent in all the Measures the
<HI>Czar</HI> took in his Travels, was his first Ambassador
<HI>as has been said</HI> in the great Embassy, was his Ple∣nipotentiary
upon all Occasions of Treaty, and
in a Word, he was so at the time of his Death, all
which shewed that the <HI>Czar</HI> knew how to put a
just value upon the Merit of those who he
employ'd, and that he was a true Judge of Merit
in general: <HI>I say,</HI> he was at the time of his Death
chief General of his Armies, Admiral of all his
Fleets, and his chief Minister: He had served the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> along time, by which he had advanc'd
himself to that degree of Honour, wherein he gli∣ter'd
at his Death; the <HI>Czar</HI> had a particular Love
and Esteem for him, and was pleas'd to give the
World a demonstration of it by the Funeral
which he bestow'd upon him; for <HI>Muscovy</HI> had ne∣ver
seen so much Pomp before upon any occa∣sion
all the military Ceremonies of the inter∣ment
were the same as in these more civiliz'd
Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> the Drums and Colours were co∣ver'd
with black, the Officers of three Regiments
that preceeded the Hearse, had black Scar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and
the Pikes garnish'd at the top with Knots of black
Ribband; the Ensigns of Honour belonging to
the deceas'd, were laid upon black Cushions em∣broider'd
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
with Gold; five Ministers preceeded
the Corps, three of which were of the reform'd
Religion, and two of the <HI>Ausburg</HI> Consession and
one <HI>Stomnies</HI> preach'd the funeral Sermon, taking
for his Text the Words of the 8th Chapter <HI>Eccle∣siastes,</HI>
ver. 8. The <HI>Czar</HI> himself led the Regiments
in deep Mourning.</P>
<P>THE place of this Gentleman was fill'd up, I
cannot say it was supply'd by Major General <HI>Car∣lowitz,</HI>
and afterwards that of General of the Army
was made up, with the Duke <HI>de Croy,</HI> an Officer of
great Experience, and who had served the Emperor
many Campaigns against the <HI>Turks,</HI> but he could
never come to be so well esteem'd or belov'd by
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> themselves, and consequently not
be so well followed.</P>
<P>THE War being thus resolv'd on, the <HI>Czar</HI>
caus'd his Cavalry to draw together about <HI>Novo∣gorod,</HI>
and particularly the Horse who had done
such great Service at <HI>Aspoh</HI> were order'd by easy
Marches, for it is a prodigious long way, to ad∣vance
to <HI>Muscow,</HI> and thence to the Fronciers;
his Infantry at the same time were drawn together
from all Parts, and were computed to make very
near 100000 Men, the Horse were reported to be
25000; but these were not all the Troops prepa∣red
for that Expedition, for his Majesty had a
considerable Body of Men, which were come to
<HI>Novogorod,</HI> but were not at the Battle at <HI>Narva,</HI> be∣ing
those who the <HI>Czar</HI> went in Person to bring for∣ward,
which was the happy Reason that he was not
in the Battle himself; which if he had, he would
have run a very great Risque of being taken Pri∣soner
by the <HI>Swedes.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT the close of the Month of <HI>August,</HI> his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty resolv'd upon the War with <HI>Sweden,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
and in <HI>September,</HI> his Troops invested <HI>Narva,</HI> his
Declaration of War having been in the mean time
published to all the World to the Purpose following.</P>
<P>THAT altho' the <HI>Swede</HI> had assur'd the <HI>Czar</HI>
that he would maintain Peace with him, and bind
it by a strict Amity, and Correspondence; and for
that Reason had sent a solemn Embassy to renew
his Treaties, nevertheless his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty com∣plain'd
and averred, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had un∣derhand
made use of several Intrigues to cross his
Designs, and among others had propos'd to the King
of <HI>Poland</HI> a League to act in Conjunction with
him against the <HI>Czar;</HI> and those Intreagues were
the Cause in part of the difficulties which happen∣ed
at <HI>Constantinople</HI> in the Conclusion of the
Peace between the <HI>Czar,</HI> and the Port, which
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty cannot forbare to make
known to all the World, and particularly to all
Christian Princes, in hopes they will acknowledge
that he has been oblig'd to make use of those law∣ful
Means, which he has in his Power for the
Preservation of his Dominions; and that if he
has declar'd War against <HI>Swedeland,</HI> 'its only to
prevent her doing him any injury by such unjust
Proceedings: The second Motive is, for that
the <HI>Czar</HI> and his Predecessors have always held a
strict Alliance with the Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> by
Virtue of which, they were oblig'd to the mutual
Assistance of each other, and reciprocally to re∣venge
the Wrongs done to either; that the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> had Landed in Person in <HI>Zeeland</HI> with a
strong Army, in the absence of the King of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI>
and put his capital City, and his whole
Kingdom in danger; that he had not only con∣strain'd
the said Prince to make a disadvantageous
Treaty with the Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> but had also
excluded the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
Friend and Confederate, that he might have an
Opportunity to oppress and utterly Ruin him,
that for these Reasons his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty found
himself oblig'd to revenge the Wrongs done his
Friends and Allies, and to break all the dange∣rous
Practice against them.</P>
<P>AFTER this he sent to his Resident in <HI>Sweden</HI>
to make known his Resolutions to that Court,
and having his Levies ready, which are re∣ported
to consist of five and twenty Thousand
Horse, and seventy Thousand Foot, together with a
Train of four Hundred and sixty Cannon and Mor∣tars;
he took Post for <HI>Plesko,</HI> to take a review
of his Forces; the command of which he had con∣ferr'd upon <HI>Aframaon Gosowitz,</HI> as General, who has
under him <HI>Theodore Alexovitz Golovin,</HI> as General
of the Horse, with General <HI>Adan Wyde,</HI> and several
<HI>German</HI> Officers. Of these 'twas said that the <HI>Czar</HI>
intended to send between twenty and thirty Thou∣sand
Men to Re-inforce the King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s Ar∣my,
and that he intended to divide the rest in∣to
two Bodies, one of which was to besiege <HI>Narva,</HI>
and the other to Post themselves at some distance
from thence, to hinder Relief from coming to the
Town.</P>
<P>THE City of <HI>Nerva</HI> or <HI>Narva,</HI> stands upon the
hither Side of the <HI>Gulph</HI> of <HI>Finland,</HI> toward the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Ingria,</HI> upon a River of the same Name,
which formerly separated <HI>Livonia</HI> from <HI>Muscovy:</HI>
On the other Side of the River stands the Fortress of
<HI>Ivanagrod,</HI> formerly built upon a sleep Rock that
appears in the River, like a Peninsula; and which
was thought impregnable till the Year 1617, that
it was taken by <HI>Gustav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden;</HI>
at the Foot of this Rock lies a Town call'd <HI>Russian,</HI>
or <HI>Muscovite Narva,</HI> the City in dispute: This
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
City is Inhabited by natural <HI>Muscovites,</HI> but Sub∣jects
to the Crown of <HI>Sweden;</HI> the River of <HI>Narva▪</HI>
which rises out of the Lake of <HI>Peipus,</HI> and dis∣charges
itself there into the <HI>Gulph</HI> of <HI>Finland,</HI> is
very rapid, and there is a Precipiece in it about
half a League above the City, where the Waters fall
with an extraordinary violence and noise, and by
accident produces a wonderful effect, for the Sun
shining all the Morning upon the falling Water,
causes the appearance of a Rainbow, as lovely
as that which is seen in the Clouds; by reason
of this Fall, the Merchants are forc'd to unload
in that Place all their Goods which are sent from
<HI>Pleskow</HI> and <HI>Dorpat</HI> to <HI>Narva,</HI> to be there Shipped
off upon the <HI>Gulpb</HI> of <HI>Finland:</HI> The City of <HI>Nar∣va</HI>
was built in 1213, by <HI>Waldemare</HI> II, King of
<HI>Denmark, John Basilides</HI> Grand Duke of <HI>Muscovy</HI>
took it in the Year 1558, from the <HI>Tuetonick</HI>
Knights; but the Citizens of <HI>Revel,</HI> who then in
vain implor'd the Succour of the grand Master
<HI>Bernard Keltier,</HI> and Christian King of <HI>Denmark,</HI>
threw themselves at length into the Arms of <HI>Eric</HI>
the IV King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who receiv'd them into his
Protection upon certain Conditions, and coming to
their Assistance, secured them from the destiny of o∣ther
Cities, his Successor John III, retook <HI>Narva</HI> from
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> in 1581, since which time the <HI>Swedes</HI>
have continu'd in possession of it, notwithstanding all the Attempts of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> to regain it.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Swedes</HI> had at once three powerful
Enemies upon their hands; Namely, the <HI>Danes,</HI>
the <HI>Poles,</HI> and the <HI>Muscovites;</HI> the King of <HI>Poland</HI>
would have sent 8000 Men, 4000 Foot, and 4000
Horse to assist the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> but the E∣lector
of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> would not let them pass
thro' his Country, being resolv'd to observe an
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
exact Neutrallity between all Parties, and they
were afterwards beaten by the <HI>Lunenburhger,</HI> in
passing thro' the lower <HI>Saxony.</HI> The <HI>Czar</HI> on
his Side prepar'd to send 30000 Men into <HI>Lithu∣ania,</HI>
to the assistance of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> which
however his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty could not yet do, things
for a time, running very much against him, as we
shall hear.</P>
<P>IT is not our business in writing of the <HI>Czar</HI>
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> to examine what happen'd in every
part of this War, any farther than to bring things
to the present Case in hand, and to introduce
such incidents as relate to the <HI>Czar</HI> himself.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> young in his Throne, and
not yet above 18 Year old in Person, yet being
encouraged by the united Squadrons of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI>
and <HI>Holland,</HI> which appear'd, as (a kind of)
Umpire in the <HI>Baltick;</HI> I say encourag'd by
them, he embark'd an Army, and from <HI>Schonen</HI>
joyning the Fleet of the Allies, with his own, comes
directly to the sound, lands his Army in the
Isle of <HI>Zeeland,</HI> and lies there ready to, ct ei∣ther
one way or other, as the Treaty of <HI>Traven∣dal,</HI>
which was then carrying on by Mediators
should direct.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Denmark</HI> surpriz'd, and over∣power'd,
hastens up the Peace, and so the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> reimbark'd his Troops, and went back to
<HI>Sweden,</HI> very little blood being shed in that Part
of the War; this was the well known Treaty of
<HI>Travendal,</HI> sign'd, and concluded the 18th of
<HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE these things were transacting, the King
of <HI>Poland</HI> made his Fruitless attempt upon <HI>Riga,</HI> of
which mention has been made already, I call it but
an attempt, for altho' he invested the Place the 8th
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
of <HI>August,</HI> he spent two Months before it, without
any considerable Progress and then left his Army;
turning the Seige into a kind of Blockade, and so
as if he had waited on purpose for the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> to come and beat him, did nothing till the
next Spring.</P>
<P>IN <HI>September,</HI> as I have observ'd, the Troops
of <HI>Muscovy</HI> began to move; it was a long step
they had to take; but the <HI>Czar</HI> being at the
Head of them, they made long Marches, and the
2d of <HI>November</HI> they joyn'd the Troops before
<HI>Narva.</HI> Hither the Duke <HI>de Croy</HI> came, with a∣bout
fifty Gentlemen, all Officers of Experience,
and who came from <HI>Hungary,</HI> where they had
serv'd the Emperor against the <HI>Turks;</HI> as soon as
he arriv'd, the <HI>Czar</HI> who had invited him to his
Service, gave him the command of the Siege; him∣self
commanding the Army; the other Officers
which he brought with him, were appointed Com∣mands
in different Places, according to their parti∣cular
Experience in Service.</P>
<P>THESE Gentlemen joyn'd to the foreign Of∣ficers,
which his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had entertain'd
before, brought the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Troops into the best
Method of prosecuting a Siege; caus'd them to En∣trench
their Camp, as well with Circumvalations,
as Contravallations, and had the Army been al∣low'd
a Campaign or two for the Practice of those
new Methods, the <HI>Swedes</HI> would not have had so
cheap a Bargain of them; but as the Men might
be said to be put out of their old way of Fight∣ing,
and not well acquainted, or fully Exercised
in the New, between both, they were more easily
put into Confusion.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="106"/>
THIS will appear by the General Duke <HI>de
Croy's</HI> Letter to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> in which he
applauds the readiness of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Soldiers
in their new Exercises, how regularly they
began to Fire, how well they plyed their Artil∣lery,
and how soon they hoped to make good
Soldiers of them, which conforms with what I
have observ'd, as above: The Letter is as follows.</P>
<P>“LIEUTENANT General <HI>Hallard</HI> arriv'd
the 2d of this Month before <HI>Narva,</HI> where
he found the Governor of <HI>Novogrod</HI> with 8000
Men entrench'd in a square Camp, 2500 Paces
from the Town; the first of these two, has
view'd the Place and the Fortifications, and
has observ'd several Parts very imperfect, and
among the rest, two Curtins which are in a ve∣ry
bad Condition, which makes us presume, that
this important Place cannot hold out long.”</P>
<P>“THE 4th of this Month, the <HI>Czar</HI> caus'd a
Bridge of Boats to be laid over the River <HI>Nar∣va,</HI>
and past it himself at the Head of 22 Ba∣talions,
with a half Pike in his hand, and
march'd somewhat farther; his Men much re∣semble
ours, and are very well Arm'd and Dis∣ciplin'd,
they have also 32 brass Field Pieces; 'tis
a Pleasure to see the <HI>Muscovites</HI> fire them, and
with what Diligence and Address they ply
their Artillery; his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty causes his
Men to keep good Orders, and an exact Dis∣cipline,
which is the Reason that the Products
of the Earth are carefully preserv'd; they are
hard at Work in raising the Circumvallations;
the besieg'd play very thick with their great
Guns; nevertheless we have had but one Sol∣dier
kill'd, and two wounded; the heavy Ar∣tillery
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
will arrive in the Camp within few Days.
General <HI>Weyde</HI> is upon his March with a great
Body of an Army, and Marshal General <HI>Gollowin</HI>
who has above 50000 Men with him in <HI>Messap∣pa</HI>
is to follow him with the same Number; and
the Prince <HI>Loym</HI> with 11000, so that in a little
time the Army will be about 200000 Men, with
a noble Train of Attillery; as for the Lines of
Communication his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty has drawn
them himself, after he had view'd the
Place.”</P>
<P>“A <HI>Swedish</HI> Officer who Deserted out of <HI>Nar∣va,</HI>
surrendred himself, some few Days ago to
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, who examin'd him, and we
understood that Colonel <HI>Horn</HI> Commands in
<HI>Narva,</HI> that the Garrison consists of 900 Foot,
and 150 Horse, 400 Peasants, and 400 Burghers,
that Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Stahl</HI> commanded
the Artillery, and that it was in a good Condi∣tion,
there are some Brass Pieces; but all the
rest are Iron.”</P>
<P>IT is too well known to conceal it, that the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> rais'd this Siege with the fatal o∣verthrow
of the <HI>Musocvite</HI> Army; but the Circum∣stances
of that Action are so full of the Flattery
of the Writers, in their Encomiums upon the King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that they totally forget the Decency
which the Merit of the Prince, he had at that
time the better of demanded; and who command∣ed
it from them in some small time after; in the
mean time we shall not fail to do the <HI>Swedes</HI> ju∣stice
on all occasions, as well as on this of the
Battle of <HI>Narva.</HI></P>
<P>HISTORY brings the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> from
<HI>Carelscoon</HI> to <HI>Peruau</HI> in <HI>Livona,</HI> with an Army of
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
about 20000 <HI>Swedes,</HI> all choice Troops, about the
beginning of <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>ON the 16th of <HI>Novem▪</HI> the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army be∣gan
their March towards <HI>Narva:</HI> The <HI>Czar,</HI> who
foresaw that the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> a daring and en∣terprising
young Prince, would play the desperate
Game, sent some strong Detachments to secure
the Passes at <HI>Sillajoggi,</HI> and on the side of <HI>Dorpat;</HI> not
doubting but that those Troops, which were at least
20000 Men, would give the <HI>Swedes</HI> some little stop
at Places so easy to be defended, and at least Cause
them to take a greater Compass about; in the
mean time his Majesty went himself for <HI>Novogo∣rod,</HI>
to bring up a Body of 40000 Men, who were
by this time gotten thither, and to hasten their
March.</P>
<P>BUT the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> by a feint of pas∣sing
by those Detachments, having gotten between
them and their main Army, and thereby cut off
their Retreat, caused a strong Body to Face a∣bout
and attack them, which Surprize assisted to
put them into disorder, so that they made but a
faint Resistance, and were soon Defeated. This
opened the way to the attack of the grand Army,
which the <HI>Czar</HI> being absent, and those Troops
defeated, were extreamly discourag'd.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the Duke <HI>de Croy,</HI> an old Soldier,
and not at a loss what to do, had the Men he Com∣manded
been equal to the Work, posted his
Troops to all the Advantage the Ground would
admit, and did all that the best General in the
World could have done to animate them to a vi∣gorous
Defence; he posted the Infantry in the
Entrenchment, where they fir'd as in a cover'd
Way, and a second Line to support them, and
the Cavalry behind them to support the Foot,
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
with proper Intervals for them to Advance; but
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Foot wanted the Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of their
Master to animate them, which had been better
than the 40000 Men he was gone to fetch; and
tho' they stood their Ground bravely for several
Hours, and made a terrible fire upon the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
from behind their Entrenchment, by which a great
many of the bravest of their Men were kill'd; yet
the <HI>Swedes</HI> animated by the Presence of their
King, and General <HI>Rebinder</HI> at the Head of eight
Batallions, pouring fresh upon that part of the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Line, which had been twice before at∣tack'd,
there was no resisting the desparate Fury
of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Foot, led on by a general of as
much Fame as any in their Army, who fought at
the Head of them, like a Lyon, and was kill'd
in the very Action, altho' after the Troops were
entred: In short, the Line was forc'd in that
Place, and the Foot enter'd, and the Pioneers
immediately going to Work with the Shovel and
Pick-ax, wide spaces were made in the Breast-work
for the Horse to follow, who presently Charging
in upon the Rear of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Foot, which
were in the other part of the Line, put all into
Confusion, the second Line advancing were then
Charg'd by the Victorious <HI>Swedes,</HI> and driven back
upon the Cavalry, who by that Means were put
into Dissorder, and had no room to come up to
the Charge; and thus the Day was lost: The rest of
the Infantry, being straightn'd within the Compass
of their Camp, had no room to make an orderly
Retreat, but were oblig'd to thro' down their Arms,
and take Quarter. The Horse not able to resist
the Torrent after their Infantry were thus Defeat∣ed,
made off and Retreated in as good order as
they could to <HI>Novogrod,</HI> in the way whether they
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
were met, and their Spirits a little encouraged by
the Troops which were Advancing to their Assi∣stance, and by the
<HI>Czar</HI> their Soveraign.</P>
<P>IT was observ'd, that the <HI>Czar</HI> shew'd not the least
Disorder, either in his Countenance, or in his Con∣duct,
when he had the News of the Defeat of his Ar∣my,
or any Resentment at his flying Troops; but
immediately apylyed himself to gather the scat∣ter'd
Troops together, encourag'd the Men, spoke
kindly to the Officers, and prepar'd to put a stop
to the pursuit of the Conquerers, if their Success
should prompt them to follow his Men, and to
put all things in a posture of Defence, in Case
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> should undertake any new
Enterprise, or attempt to push farther into the
Country.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Swedes</HI> had not their Victory so
cheap neither, as to be in Condition for any far∣ther
attempt at that time of the Year. They had
by their own Confession lost above 3000 Men,
besides the wounded, among which were a great
many brave Officers, as General <HI>Rublinghen, Re∣binder,</HI>
and several others; add to this, the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> had the Winter Season before him,
which was already far Advanc'd; and as the
Snows and Frosts were not yet come in, the ways
were unpassable, and no Magazines erected for
providing the Army with Forage or Provisi∣ons;
so that he contented himself with having
relieved the Town, and beaten the Army, as he
might very well.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> advancing to <HI>Peskow</HI> within twelve
Leagues of <HI>Narva,</HI> made a stand there, to give
his Men opportunity to return to their Colours,
which many did, who it was, thought had been lost,
and here his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty form'd a new Army,
<PB N="110" REF="111"/>
in order to dispute the Ground with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> if
they had offer'd to Advance.</P>
<P>BUT the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as I observ'd, having
reliev'd <HI>Narva,</HI> and gain'd a compleat Victory,
put his Troops into Quarters of Refreshment for
the Season, and contented himself with boasting
of what great things he would do in the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Dominions the next Year, and to give those <HI>Ga∣sconades</HI>
an Appearance of reality, he sent
express Orders to <HI>Sweden</HI> to send over into <HI>Livonia,</HI>
with the first of the Spring, that is, as soon as the
Seas were open again, his whole remaining Army,
in the room of which they were order'd to make
new Levies for the common Guard of their Coun∣try;
these Forces were said to consist of about
12000 Foot, and 6000 Horse, and Dragoons, but
Heaven and his own Fate found the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
other Work than to enter <HI>Muscovy,</HI> or to Pro∣secute
his Revenge at that time.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denyed, that had, the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> when those Forces did arrive push'd the
Advantages, which his late Victory had put into
his Hand, and persued his Revenge singly against
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Troops, tho' Numerous, be∣ing
nothing like to what we find them to be
since, or as we may say to what the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
has taught them to be since, he might with
a victorious Army of 40000 Men, have bid fair for
the Ruin of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and of all his great Designs;
but just Heaven, who knew what a furious inexo∣rable
Enemy, the <HI>Swede</HI> at that time was, tyed
up his Hands, till the <HI>Czar</HI> learnt how to Conquer
his Conqueror, and to beat him into a better
Knowledge of himself; making him pay for a like
desperate Attempt upon the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> with the
loss of the Honour of all his former Victories,
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
and of two such Armies as he never saw himself
Master of afterwards, of all which in his order.</P>
<P>SUCCESS had now made the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
famous, I will not say it had made him insolent,
because a Historian should write in Temper, e∣ven
of those Actions, which were not perform'd
in Temper, and treat all Sides with an impartial
Respect.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had also another Call,
from the pursuit of his Victory at <HI>Narva,</HI> and
this was the attempt of the <HI>Saxons</HI> upon the o∣ther
side of <HI>Livonia,</HI> where the King of <HI>Poland</HI>
had, <HI>as I said,</HI> invested <HI>Riga,</HI> taken the <HI>Dunamun∣der
Schans,</HI> and had Quartered his Troops in such
a manner, as to hold the said City of <HI>Riga</HI> in a
manner block'd up.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Saxons</HI> were esteem'd by the <HI>Swedes</HI> a more
Soldierly Enemy, than the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and at that
time, perhaps they were so, but thus it is when Hea∣ven
appoints to raise a young King to a pitch of
Glory beyond himself; the <HI>Saxons</HI> at <HI>Riga</HI> real∣ly
behav'd worse a great deal than the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
at <HI>Narva,</HI> and were so shamefully beaten in
every Action, and even without Action, that
there could nothing be said for them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army posted in their En∣trenchments,
and encumber'd with the Lines, and
Circumvallations of a Camp, did their Duty till
being forc'd in one part, they were driven upon one
another and Defeated, meerly for want of Field
room, for their Cavalry to act in; for it cannot
be doubted, that had the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Calvalry;
which were at least 25000 Horse and Dragoons,
had room to act, and to have fallen in, and sur∣rounded
the <HI>Swedes,</HI> as by their Number they were
able to have done, the <HI>Swedes</HI> would have paid
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
much dearer for their Victory, than they did, if
perhaps they had not been soundly beaten.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Saxons</HI> play'd the <HI>Poltrons</HI> in such an
egregious manner, as made even their own King
asham'd of them; and as encourag'd the <HI>Swedes</HI>
to push into the Heart of <HI>Poland,</HI> at that time
wretchedly divided into factions and Parties, pro∣secuting
mortal Feuds against one another, with
such an implacable Violence, that they chose
to Sacrifice their Country to the common E∣nemy,
and bring a foreign War into their own
Bowels, rather than not pursue their private
Feuds and Family Quarrels, to the Destruction
of one another, and at last to the Ruin of their
King and their Country; which they brought into
an entire Subjection to the tyrannical Conqueror,
the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>I AM oblig'd to give an Account here of the
Progress of the War in <HI>Poland,</HI> because the King
of <HI>Sweden;</HI> having by the impetuosity of his Vi∣ctory
brought the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to the utmost
Distress, Reason and Policy of State, as well as
the natural Generosity of Friendship, brought his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty into the War, and made <HI>Poland</HI>
the Field, or Seat of the affair, as well between
the <HI>Czar,</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
as between the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> not thinking fit
to seek his Enemy, the <HI>Czar</HI> at his capital City of
<HI>Muscow,</HI> as he had given out he would; his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty was oblig'd to seek him the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> out, even where he was to be found; as
we shall see he did effectually in the Prosecution
of this War. This Defeat of the <HI>Saxons</HI> was a∣bout
the beginning of July 1701, by which means
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> got possession of the Dutchy
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
of <HI>Courland,</HI> where in the Castle of <HI>Mittau,</HI> he
seized the whole Magazine of Arms and Ammu∣nition
belonging to, and laid up for the King of
<HI>Poland's</HI> Army, valued at 300000 Crowns, and
afterwards retook the Fort of <HI>Dunamunder,</HI> where
he found the Train of Artillery of the same Ar∣my,
consisting of 90 Pieces of Brass Cannon for
Battery, and 20 brass Mortars, which was a most
agreeable Booty to a Prince just entring upon a
War against two such Potent Nations, as the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> and the <HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<P>BUT leaving the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> guided by
his ill Fate to pursue and embarrass himself in
the Affairs of <HI>Poland,</HI> where first he will cloth
himself with Glory and load himself with Lawrels,
which must be all taken from him in one Day, by
the more glorious Conqueror, the <HI>Czar;</HI> I say,
leaving him there to pursue his Fate, and omit∣ting
the only offer that he will ever have of ruin∣ing
his first Enemy the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and
pushing his Victory in its proper time, which if
he had done, the <HI>Czar</HI> had perhaps never been
able to stand before him: I must now go back to
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's conduct after this capital
Blow given to his Forces before <HI>Narva.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE mention'd how his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
as if unconcern'd at the surprizing News, ap∣ply'd
himself to comfort and encourage his Offi∣cers
and Soldiers, his Cavalry had not really
suffer'd much, his Infantry indeed was ruin'd and
gone; but every Body knows foot Soldiers are
pretty cheap in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> where the <HI>Czar</HI> being
absolute Monarch, commands as many of his Peo∣ple
to the Wars as he pleases.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115"/>
HOWEVR, this was not his Majesty's case now, for
instead of commanding out such and such Num∣bers
of Men, for the Summer Service, and let∣ting
them go Home again when the Campaign
was over, perhaps, calling another Hundred
Thousand out the next Year, who never saw the
Field or an Enemy before, His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
now took a new Course; he caus'd the Drums
to beat for Voluntiers over all his vast Em∣pire,
telling the People their Advantages, how
they should be new Cloathed, that they should be
duly Paid as Gentlemen Soldiers; and that in their
due Order, and as they merited by their Behavi∣our,
they should be, Prefer'd and Rewarded; so
that every Foot Soldier was capable of being not
a Captain only, but a General, if he behaved
well in his Post.</P>
<P>THIS which was a new Thing in <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
went a great way, and caus'd a vast Number of
Men to come in and List, who were immediately
encouraged with half a Ruble advance Money,
and Weekly Pay, besides sufficient to subsist them,
and make them live Easy and Pleasant; besides
this▪ his Majesty caus'd all the Boyars or Nobility
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end a certain Number of Men, in proportion
to the Number of Servants which they kept, and
to the Revenue of their Estates.</P>
<P>BY this means, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had his Ar∣my
prefently full, so that before the next Cam∣paign,
he had near 120000 New listed Men ready
raised, whom he caus'd to be form'd into Regi∣ments
after the manner of <HI>Europe;</HI> some of four
Baltalions, some of two Battalions, and some of
but one Battalion, as he found Cause.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="116"/>
AS for the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> had now supprest
the very Name, and as much as possible desir'd to
rase out the very Memory of them from the
Earth; in their Room his Majesty form'd seve∣ral
new Reigments of select choice Men; most
of them old Soldiers, and a great many of
them <HI>Germans,</HI> or Foreigners of other Nations,
tho' none of them were admitted but such as had
serv'd Abroad in some of the Wars, either on the
<HI>Danube</HI> or the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>AS the <HI>Czar</HI> had leisure thus to raise this Ar∣my;
so the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> being fully engag'd
in pursuing the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> as a particular
Enemy, gave his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty full Leisure to
make all his new Army, what they never could be
said to be before; that is, not only Men, but Sol∣diers,
for they had leisure to be fully acquainted
with their Arms, and to understand how to do
their Exercise after the <HI>German</HI> method by beat
of Drum: He posted them also in great Bodies
upon the Frontiers of <HI>Livonia,</HI> where, tho' the
<HI>Swedes</HI> behav'd with their wanted Bravery and
oftentimes were too hard for them; yet in their
turn they beat the <HI>Swedes</HI> too, and oftentimes
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut whole Parties of them in Pieces; by which they
began to be enured to the War, acquainted them∣selves
with the New manner of Fighting; learn'd to
look a bold Enemy in the Face, and to find that
the <HI>Swedes</HI> were not invulnerable or invincible: In
a Word, they learn't by frequent fighting the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
not to be so much afraid of them, as usual, and
thus if they did not always beat the <HI>Swedes;</HI> yet
they continually harrass'd them, and wasted their
Numbers, which the <HI>Swedes</HI> not being easily Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruited
with Numbers as the <HI>Muscovites</HI> were, and
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> pushing his Resolution of de∣posing
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
King <HI>Augustus</HI> with such vigour, that he
as it were neglected his own Subjects of <HI>Livonia:</HI>
The <HI>Czar</HI> improving in the mean time every op∣portunity,
and keeping his Troops full, send∣ing
constant Supplies of fresh Men to make up
the Loss of those that were kill'd, or disabled;
his Reigments in <HI>Livonia</HI> became in two or three
Year equal with the <HI>Swedes</HI> in goodness of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and infinitely Superiour to them in Num∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r,
till the <HI>Swedes</HI> came to be beaten oftentimes,
Hand to Hand with equal Numbers, were push'd
from Post to Post, and at last push'd out of the
whole Province, as we shall see its in Course.</P>
<P>AT the same time the Troubles of <HI>Lith<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ania</HI>
ope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d a Door for the two Enemies, the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
and the <HI>Swedes</HI> to enter on that Side. The two great
Families of <HI>Saphiea</HI> and <HI>Oginski,</HI> had brought
their Breach, which was at first but a private
Quarrel, to be an open War: <HI>Oginski</HI> was sup∣ported
by the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and <HI>Saphiea</HI> call'd
in the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to his Succour, and he (the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI>) espous'd the <HI>Saph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iea's,</HI> and made
them Superiour to <HI>Oginski</HI> and his Party; so <HI>Ogin∣ski</HI>
finding the King of <HI>Poland</HI> not able to sup∣port
him, having his handful of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> he
call'd in the <HI>Muscovites</HI> to his aid; his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty
taking him into his Protection, did not assist
him with a handful of Men, as it were on purpose
to prolong the War, but at two or three times
sent him at least 30000 Men; so that tho' the
<HI>Swedes</HI> had many times the better of him too, yet
he always maintain'd himself in the Field, till
all went to wreck, and King <HI>Augustus</HI> himself
was Forc'd to abandon them all, and quit the
Crown, of which in its Place.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118"/>
THESE Transactions kept the World in sus∣pence
three or four Years, during which time, the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Troops gain'd every Day new Expe∣rience,
and new Reputation in the World, being
by the <HI>Czar's</HI> particular Direction all fill'd, not
only with <HI>German</HI> Officers, but having among
them abundance of <HI>German, Polish,</HI> and other fo∣reign
Soldiers, most of them Men of Service, and
who had been fully acquainted with the War be∣fore
they were entertain'd and as his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty
gave very good Encouragement to all
Strangers, who Listed in his Troops, he had a
great many Deserters, even from the <HI>Swedish</HI>
Troops themselves.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all, for as he soon after
this, Conquer'd whole Provinces from the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and had occasion to act with his Armies in
several parts of the Empire, as in <HI>Pomeren</HI> in the
Dutchy of <HI>Mecklemburgh</HI> in <HI>Holstein,</HI> and in <HI>Den∣mark;</HI>
so he fail'd not of entertaining all the a∣ble
Experience'd Soldiers he could get in all those
Countries; by which means many of his Regi∣ments,
and particularly his Guards were made up
of the choicest Men all that part of the World could
affrod: As for the Provinces conquer'd from <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
the <HI>Czar</HI> has rais'd all the Men that it was
possible to get in <HI>Livonia,</HI> and in <HI>Finland,</HI> of whom
he has in his Army at this time several whole
Regiments; particularly of <HI>Finlanders,</HI> who being
some of the best, the boldest, and most hardy Men
of all the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI> Dominions, are now
the <HI>Czar's</HI> proper Subjects, and the last levey the
<HI>Czar's</HI> Generals made there, was of 3500 Men,
which I am told are form'd into one Regiment,
and call'd the Royal <HI>Finlanders;</HI> but 'tis added
that the <HI>Czar</HI> chuses to employ that Regiment in the
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
remoter part of his Country against the <HI>Turks,</HI>
least when they come to act against their old
Master the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> they should play
Booty, and go over to his Side.</P>
<P>I NEED give no farther Account, either why,
or how the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Troops came to be what we
see they are; Namely, equal to other Nations in
the Field; but I may take the liberty to add, that
if the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Troops come to be as good as the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> or other Neighbouring Nations; it must
be allowed, that their Numbers are so far Superior
to them, that there will be no room for the Fu∣ture
for that Contempt, with which those Nations
have formerly look'd on the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>IT is a speculation worthy the best and greatest
Polititians of <HI>Europe,</HI> how much the masculine
Genius of one Prince, may alter the Circumstances
not of his own Subjects only, but of all the Nations
in the World that are any way influence'd by them;
for as they are of Weight in the Ballance of
the Nations, so the Interest of the Neighbouring
Nations, are more or less concern'd to Support, or
Suppress them.</P>
<P>THE Empire of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> extend∣ed
as it is from the North to the South, for the
length of 2500 Miles, that is to say, from the North
Sea, bounding the Coast of the <HI>Rssian Laponia,</HI> in
the Latitude of 72 or from the extream Part of
<HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> in the Latitude of 81, to the Coasts
of <HI>Carakathay,</HI> and the Desarts of the <HI>Calumuck
Tarters,</HI> even to the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea is by the Scituation
so plac'd, as to be effectually cover'd from all man∣ner
of Enemies, either on the East, the North, or
the South, and has nothing to regard, but the West∣stern
side of its Dominion.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120"/>
I CAN liken the situation of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mus∣covy's</HI>
Dominion to nothing so well, as to a well
chosen strong Encampment, plac'd in a piece of
Ground every way inaccessible, but in the Front,
and the Front so Fortify'd, as not to be easily
attack'd, <HI>for Example,</HI> the North Ocean is on its
Right, the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> and the Desarts of <HI>Tar∣tary</HI>
on its Left: The unpassable Wast from the
River <HI>Oby</HI> to <HI>China</HI> in its whole Reer, and no∣thing
lying open, but its Front.</P>
<P>THIS Front is guarded on its <HI>Right Wing,</HI> by
the <HI>Bothnick Gulph,</HI> and the <HI>Gulph</HI> of <HI>Finland,</HI>
with inaccessible Shores, and a multitude of well
fortify'd Ports from <HI>Abbo</HI> round the latter <HI>Gulph,</HI>
by <HI>Wyburg, Cronsloot, Petersbourgh, Narva,</HI> and <HI>Re∣vel,</HI>
to <HI>Riga,</HI> and the Shores of <HI>Courland,</HI> with the
Dutchy of <HI>Courland</HI> in Possession, as an Out-work,
or advanc'd Bastion in a Town, to keep off an E∣nemy
from the Body of the Place.</P>
<P>ALL the Left Wing of this prodigious extend∣ed
Line, is cover'd with the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, the De∣sarts
of <HI>Circassia,</HI> the <HI>Palus-Meotis,</HI> and the rapid
<HI>Boristhenes,</HI> till we come to the <HI>Russian Ukrania</HI>
which lyes again like a strong Out-work, guard∣ed
with a Hundred Thousand faithful <HI>Cossacks,</HI>
the terror of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and a sufficient De∣fence
against their Incursions, which they formerly
made that way into the Heart of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>ALL the middle of this immense Front is
bordered by <HI>Poland,</HI> a Nation so constantly em∣broil'd
with itself▪ as to be formidable to no Bo∣dy;
and yet a Nation, that as it is not considerable
enough to be a terror to <HI>Muscovy,</HI> or offer the <HI>Czar</HI>
any uneasiness on their own Account, so they
are yet too considerable to be forc'd, to suffer an
Invasion of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> thro' their Country; so that
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
upon the whole, there seems to be no Nation cap∣able
of penetrating Into <HI>Muscovy,</HI> but the <HI>Swedes;,</HI>
and how the Cafe stands on that Side, will be seen
in the whole Course of this History.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, the powerful <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> if once his Army is prepar'd as I have
observ'd, to come Hand to Hand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>with any of the
Nations that lye thus on its Front, is able to Sally
out by all these ways, and will be much Superi∣or
to them, on Account of the numberless Mul∣titude
of his People, of whom he is able to raise
as many Thousands, as some of his Neighbours can
Hundreds, and that with less Expence than any
of them.</P>
<P>BUT I return to the Field of Afion, as the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> were call'd into <HI>Litbuania</HI> to assist the
Sieur <HI>Oginski</HI> against the <HI>Saphieas,</HI> and the <HI>Swedes;</HI>
so by this time the King of <HI>Poland</HI> having lost
the Battle of <HI>Cracow,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> de∣claring
his Resolution to Dethrone him, and as it
appear'd, being Powerful enough to bring it to
pass, calls aloud to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty to come
to his Assistance also.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> too well understood his Business, not
to make his just Advantage of the obstinate
warmth of his Enemy the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> in pur∣suit
of the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> and therefore while
that Monarch, who was now with his whole Ar∣my,
as is said, gotten the height of <HI>Cracow,</HI> and
where his Victory over the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> had fil∣l'd
his Head with new Projects, for reduction of the
whole Country, and deposing the King; his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, first sending 20000 to the aid of <HI>Oginski</HI>
in <HI>Lithunia,</HI> thereby to keep the <HI>Swedish</HI> Troops
on that Side employ'd; and after having caus'd
another Army to advance towards Great <HI>Po∣land,</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
to be ready to Succour King Augustus, taking
the advantage of the Absence of the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and his following his imaginary good
Portune, he caus' Fan Army of 60000 Foot, all
Regular, and Regimented Troops, form'd after the
new Model, as above, and Commanded by ex∣perienc'd
Generals, as well as other Officers, most
Foreigners, and 20000 Horse to enter <HI>Livonia,</HI> and
another Army of 30000 foot, and 10000 Horse
at the same time to enter <HI>Ingria,</HI> or <HI>Ingermandland,</HI>
a Province beyond <HI>Livonia</HI> Eastward, and joyning
to <HI>Finland;</HI> and the only way by which any
Troops from that Side of <HI>Sweden,</HI> call'd <HI>Finland,</HI>
could come by Land to the Succour of the <HI>Livo∣nians.</HI></P>
<P>HERE his <HI>Gzarish</HI> Majesty made himself full
Amends, and had his compleat Revenge of the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> for the Loss sustain'd at the Battle of
<HI>Narvaa;</HI> for Prince <HI>Czeremet,</HI> who Commanded
this Army, enter'd <HI>Livonia</HI> unresisted, and having
Ravag'd all the easter Part, call'd <HI>Esthonia,</HI> as
far as <HI>Dorpat,</HI> met with very little, if any op∣pofition;
at length the <HI>Swedish</HI> General <HI>Slipping∣back,</HI>
having gotten together an Army of about
Ten Thousand Men, all <HI>Swedes</HI> and old Soldiers,
and presuming upon the good Fortune of <HI>Narva,</HI>
and the usual contempt they had for the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Troops, oppos'd himself to the Prince; but he
paid for his Ignorance and Rashness, by the entire
Defeat of his whole Army, who were over-thrown,
and almost all cut in pieces by the <HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, the <HI>Swedes</HI> fought like Lyons, or like
Furies rather, and that in the Fight they push'd
whole Brigades of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Infantry, put
them into Confusion, and in that Confusion, they
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
flaughter'd many of them; and this is doing the
<HI>Swedish</HI> valour Justice, for indeed they were over∣come
by meer Numbers.</P>
<P>BUT just the same they would have said of the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at the Battle of <HI>Narva,</HI> if he had
been repulsed, that having an Army of 100000 Men
to deal with, his Men were overlay'd by the
innumerable Multitudes of their Enemies; that
they Fought like Lyons, but what could Men
do, who had an Army of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix to one to deal with?
That Valour gave way at last to Number, <HI>and
the like,</HI> and had the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army had Field
room in that Action at <HI>Narva,</HI> and not been
Coup'd up in a Camp, where the foremost Troops
being put into disorder, the rest were driven one
upon another, and made the Instruments of their
own Ruins; I say, had not this been the Case,
'tis very like the <HI>Swedes</HI> had talk'd of the Action
at <HI>Narva,</HI> as they do now of that near <HI>Dorpat.</HI></P>
<P>BUT 'tis an answerable return, which is made
to this; what an Unsoldierly rashness was it for
General <HI>Slippenback,</HI> to suffer himself to be at∣tack'd,
or pretend to Fight with 10000 Men, a∣gainst
60000? for so many the <HI>Swedes</HI> say the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> were; nay, and if it be true, that as
they say, General Slippenback was not above 6000
the presumption was the greater for Rashness,
and Temerity in Actons of War, are not to be
call'd Valour and Bravery, but Madness and Folly.</P>
<P>BUT to come to the Fact, it was from the Be∣ginning
of <HI>May,</HI> 1702, that the Russians were
known to be drawing together; above 70000
Men, lay about <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>skow</HI> and the Frontiers of
the <HI>Czar's</HI> Dominions, and were encreasing
every Day: Now had the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> thought
his Province of <HI>Livonia</HI> worth securing, or had
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
he not flattered himself, that the Russians would not
dare to appear in the Field, but that they would
be frighted with the Names of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> that the
Scripture Prophesie was to be fulfilled in <HI>Livo∣nia,</HI>
in favour of his Men, <HI>That One should Chasfe a
Thousand, and Two put ten Thousand to flight:</HI> I say,
had he not filled his Head with the most despica∣ble
Opinion of the <HI>Russians,</HI> he would never have
left such a Province as <HI>Livonia</HI> to be devour∣ed,
and such gallant Troops as the <HI>Swedes</HI> really
were, to be cut in pieces in small Bodies for want
of Succour; while he was pursuing his Revenge,
and talking upon him the giving a King too,
and pulling down a King from the Throne of his
Neighbour, the Kingdom of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>BUT thus it was, the <HI>Russian</HI> Army entred <HI>Li∣vonia</HI>
Commanded by the Prince of <HI>Czeremetoff,</HI>
about the beginning of July. They were not
ignorant that the <HI>Swedish</HI> General <HI>Slippenback,</HI>
lay encamp'd between <HI>Dorpat,</HI> and Revel, tho'
the Prince had not any Account of his Numbers,
and if he had, itcould not be depended upon, be∣cause
he might be suppos'd to receive Additions
every Day from <HI>Revel,</HI> and <HI>Riga,</HI> which were in
his Reer, and from the <HI>Swedish</HI> General <HI>Myerfield</HI>
in <HI>Lithuania:</HI> For this Reason the Prince did not
undertake any Siege, resolving to make War in
the open Field, and first seek out and fight his
Enemy, that he might not have the same Game
to Play, as had been fatally play'd at <HI>Narva.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpose the Prince march'd on, and
the 16th of <HI>July,</HI> having an Account that the
<HI>Swedes</HI> march'd towards him, he advanc'd di∣rectly
forward: The <HI>Swedish,</HI> General hearing
what disparity of Numbers he had to engage with,
halted at a Village call'd <HI>Stagnitz</HI> on the River
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
<HI>Emback,</HI> as if he had resolv'd to expect the <HI>Rus∣sians</HI>
There; and so far was he from being sensible
of the odds there was between them, that he did
not so much as offer to Entrench; but with an Ar∣rogance
inimitable, kept his Situation, till the
<HI>Russians</HI> came in view, being in full March to attack
him, and in admirable Order of Battle: A little
surpris'd with the Sight, he then, when it was too
late, put his Men in March, and repass'd the River
upon two Bridges, breaking the Bridges behind
him; but this only serv'd to bring him to a Ne∣cessity
of Fighting afterwards, in a Situation not
more Advantagious than the first; for the <HI>Russians</HI>
passing also the River at some distance; and be∣ing
drawn up again as before, mov'd directly to∣wards
them. Then it was the <HI>Swedish</HI> General
boldly Fac'd about, and resolv'd to Fight. The
oonsequence of which was, his being over-thrown,
and entirely defeated, and all his Infantry cut in
pieces, as I have said; tho' not till after an ob∣stinate
and bloody Fight, which lasted almost a
whole Day.</P>
<P>NOW that I may not be Partial in the Rela∣tion
of this Action, I shall give their own Ac∣count,
which they sent to all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI>
and which excepting the smallness of their own
Number kill'd, we are content to refer to, which
is as follows,</P>
<P>UPON July 6, we say the <HI>Swedes</HI> receiv'd Intelli∣gence,
that the <HI>muscovites</HI> were enter'd into <HI>Livo∣nia</HI>
with a numerous Army, and were advanc'd as
far as <HI>Crosfort;</HI> the next Day our avant Couriers
being repuls'd to our Guards, General <HI>Slippenback</HI>
detach'd 300 Horse to observe the Enemy: This
Party upon the 18th in the Morning, met with a
Body of a 1000 <HI>Muscovites,</HI> which they attack'd,
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
and drove to the Body of their Army, but the
<HI>Swedish</HI> Cavalry being surpris'd at the sight of
such a numerous Host, durst not make any long
stay, but retreated in great Confusion; so that
being pursu'd by the Enemy, we lost Major <HI>Rose,</HI>
and some other Officers, who were slain; the
Major General being inform'd of what had hap∣pen'd,
rod himself to view the Enemy's Army,
and presently perceiving they had a design to sur∣round
his small Body; he judg'd it convenient by
the Advice of a Council of War, to crost the Ri∣ver
of <HI>Emback,</HI> to prevent their Design; which was
done in view of the Enemy, and in very good
order over two Bridges that were broken, so soon
as our Men were over; but the River being then
very low, and the Enemy making use of several
Pontons to waft over their Artillery, 'twas im∣possible
to prevent their passing with the rest of
their Army; so that General <HI>Slippenback</HI> find∣ing
that a great Number of the Enemy were al∣ready
got on our Side, could not avoid coming
to a Battle; all the Advantage at the beginning
was on our Side; we beat the Enemy every
where, we pursu'd them above a <HI>German</HI> Mile; we
took from them six pieces of Cannon, part of their
Baggage, and some Colours, and at length we
press'd so hard upon 'em, that they threw them∣selves
into the River; but the rest of their
Army asham'd to fee their Fellows fly, and mad
to be beaten by such a small Number of Men, Fac'd
about of a sudden, and put the <HI>Finland</HI> Cavalry
into such disorder, that they fell foul upon the
Infantry, and betook themselves to flight, with∣out
any possibility of being rally'd, so that our
Artillery, as well as that which we had taken, fell
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
into the Enemies Power, and our Infantry after
a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tout ressistance was almost cut in pieces: This
Action began about six in the Morning, and lasted
for ten Hours together; our General would fain
have rally'd them again, and posted us at <HI>Helmer,</HI>
but finding it impossible to stop the Horse that
were fled and dispers'd, and being no longer a∣ble
to stand his Ground with the remains of his
Infantry, he was constrain'd to retreat to
<HI>Perna<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this Occasion, the <HI>Swedes</HI> loft 7 Captains,
30 Lieutenants, 11 Ensigns, and 25 Subalterns;
37 Drums, and 1916 common Soldiers; we know
indeed that the Loss of the Muscovites was much
greater, but it was hardly preceptible, by reason
of their Multitude: After this Expedition the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> were about to have march'd back, but
they were hardly arriv'd at the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Peipus,</HI>
when they receiv'd Orders to return, and put all
<HI>Livonia</HI> to Fire and Sword, which they have done
in a most cruel manner, till within some Leagues
of <HI>Riga.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is their own Account in which the im∣partial
Reader will certainly conclude, that had the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> Number been so great, and theirs
so small, as they would represent them, it could
scarce be possible that they could defend them∣selves
ten Hours, and be Defeated at last too;
having no Shelter, no Retreat, no Entrenchments
or Defences at all, but their Arms.</P>
<P>BUT the Sum of the Case was, and that appears
by the Accounts publish'd at that time, that the
<HI>Swedes</HI> were no lest than ten Thousand Men, o∣thers
lay fourteen Thousand, and the publick
Papers printed at that Time, as also by Letters
from <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and from <HI>Riga</HI> at the same time,
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
both to <HI>London,</HI> and to <HI>Holland,</HI> give this Account
in few Words, <HI>viz.</HI> “That Prince <HI>Czeremet</HI> the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> General at the Head of a numerous
Army, had entirely defeated General <HI>Slippen∣back,</HI>
with an Army of 10000 <HI>Swedes,</HI> not Far
from <HI>Dorpat,</HI> and that the <HI>Swedish</HI> General with
a few Horse, who desperately broke thro' the
<HI>Russian</HI> Army had escaped; all the rest of the
Army having been cut in pieces after a gallant
Resistance, and a Fight, Which lasted from eight
a-Clock in the Morning, to seven a-Clock at
Night.”</P>
<P>THE last of these Accounts was certainly well
grounded, with this Exception only, that the
<HI>Swedes</HI> were not all cut in pieces, about 1200 be∣ing
taken Prisoners, with all their Baggage, Can∣non,
Tents and Ammunition.</P>
<P>BUT the particular Reason why I publish here
their own Account of this Fight, is to repeat
what I have so often mention'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of the dif∣ference
between the <HI>Russian</HI> Soldiers now, and
what they were formerly; for now the <HI>Swedes</HI>
found, that after they had broke them several
times by the Fury of their Charge, and put them
into Confusion, yet that they rall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed again by
the skill and dexterity of their Officers, and by
the aptness, and experience of their Soldiers, and
that they returned again to the Charge, after they
had been push'd into Disorder; which was what
the <HI>Swedes</HI> did not expect to find among them,
and this was the ruin of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army.</P>
<P>AFTER this Action, the State of the War took a
new Turn; the <HI>Swedes</HI> were defeated upon all Oc∣casions,
and that not only an <HI>Livonia,</HI> but in <HI>Lithu∣ani</HI>
also; <HI>Oginski</HI> and his Friends, supported by the
Troops the <HI>Gzar</HI> had sent him, routed the <HI>Swedes</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
twice in a Weeks time, killing 400, and taking 800
Prisoners, in one Action, and killing 1000, and ta∣king
700 in the second Action.</P>
<P>AFTER Prince <HI>Gzeremet</HI> had thus clear'd the Field
of his Enemy, he laid wast the whole Province., <HI>as a∣bove;</HI>
the Reason was, that he found them universal∣ly
averse to Submit, even when subdued; and that
upon an order from the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to the
Country, to take Arms, they did so, and fell up∣on
his Men wherever they found them.</P>
<P>THIS was what his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty does not
delight in, nor does he suffer his Troops to Practice
it in the other Countries of his Conquests; but
he had been treated with such personal Indignity
by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> on all Occasions, that he
found himself oblig'd to shew his Resentment;
and on the other Hand he was represented by the
<HI>Swedes</HI> themselves, as an Enemy so contemptible,
that no Rules of Honour, or Justice were to be obser∣ved
with him; and it behov'd his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
on both these Accounts, to let the Subjects of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
know, that he was in a Condition to make
himself be better us'd, and that they might have
Reason to fear him, instead of insulting him.</P>
<P>THERE was also another Reason for this Severi∣ty,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the great Towns of <HI>Livonia</HI> under whose
Protection, the <HI>Swedish</HI> Forces sheltered, might
not be able to subsist them; and also that his Ene∣mies
might not fill their Magazines in <HI>Courland,</HI>
and in Lithuania out of the fruitful Provinces of
<HI>Livonia,</HI> and <HI>Eastonia.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this Execution, the Prince sat down be∣fore
<HI>Dorpat</HI> with his whole Army, keeping at the
same time great Detachments of Horse to scour
the Country to the Gates of <HI>Per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and even to <HI>Ri∣ga,</HI>
to prevent the <HI>Swedes</HI> gatheringany Number of
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
Troops into a Body together, to attempt to Re∣lieve
the Place.</P>
<P>WHILE these things went on thus prospe∣rously
in <HI>Livonia,</HI> the <HI>Russian</HI> Army in <HI>Ingria</HI> were
no less Successful, the Fortress of <HI>Skansterny</HI> after a
vigorous Attack was surrender'd to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
and the <HI>Muscovite</HI> General—<HI>Slippenbach</HI> with a
strong Body of an Army being sent to the Edge of
<HI>Finland,</HI> landed not far from <HI>Wyburgh</HI> with 24000
Men, in 400 Transport Vessels, and in a plain
Field gave Battle to the <HI>Swedish</HI> Forces under Gene∣ral
<HI>Crooniort,</HI> and entirely defeated them, the
<HI>Swedish</HI> General, and a few of his Men making
their Retreat, and escap'd to <HI>Wyburg.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the whole Province of <HI>Ingermania</HI> or <HI>In∣gria</HI>
fell into his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's hand, and his
Troops made daily Excursions upon the Enemy
in <HI>Finland</HI> itself (<HI>viz.</HI>) first Thus</P>
<P>THE particulars of this Action are thus diver∣sly
related, first thus.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the <HI>Muscovites</HI> get Ground in
these Parts having lately obtain'd very considera∣ble
Advantages over a volant Camp of the <HI>Swedes</HI>
commanded by General <HI>Crooniort</HI> in those Quarters,
the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> with a Body of 25000 Men, being
conducted through by, and impracticable ways, fell
upon the <HI>Swedes</HI> when least expected, and after a
bloody Fight, which lasted from six in the Morn∣ing
till two in the Afternoon, being much Supe∣rior
in Number, put the <HI>Swedes</HI> to the Rout; how∣ever
'tis said that the <HI>Swedish</HI> General after a vi∣gorous
Resistance, made good his Retreat to <HI>Wy∣burg:</HI>
There is since publish'd a more exact Rela∣tion
of this Encounter between the <HI>Swedes</HI> and
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> which gives the following Account,
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that General <HI>Crooniort</HI> having Advice, that the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> had fram'd a Design utterly to destroy
his small Army, and for that end had embark'd
a great Number of Troops, in 8 Frigats, 400
small Transport Vessels, and two great Floating
Machines, whereon Batteries were plac'd, design∣ing
to Cannonade the Enemy with their Fleet,
while the rest of their Army fell upon them by
Land; the Major General thereupon, sent out
Parties to observe the Motions of the <HI>Muscovites;</HI>
one whereof return'd towards Morning, and brought
Advice that they had discover'd some of their
Troops within an hours March of the <HI>Swedes</HI>
Out-guards, who immediately prepar'd to receive
them; the <HI>Russians</HI> contrary to their Expectati∣ons
finding the <HI>Swedes</HI> in a readiness, drew back
in order to be joyn'd with more Troops, not far
behind; which they had no sooner done, but they
return'd and Charg'd the <HI>Swedes</HI> with great vigour;
who, tho' but a handful as it were, defended
themselves very well, till General <HI>Crooniort</HI> came
up to them with a Reinforcement of Horse and
Foot; but the Pass of <HI>Susterback,</HI> where the <HI>Swedes</HI>
were posted, being too narrow for the Horse to
do any Service, the Foot were oblig'd to give way
to the Superiour Numbers of their Enemies, who
press'd them close at the Heels, and did not fail to
make the best of their Advantage; but the <HI>Swedish</HI>
Horse coming up again, put a stop to their Progress;
the <HI>Swedish</HI> General began then to discover from the
great clouds of Dust that arose in several Places,
that the rest of the <HI>Muscovite's</HI> Army was coming
up with their Cannon, and not doubting but they
were infinitely stronger then himself: His Army
not exceeding 4000 Men, the General thought it ad∣viseable
to order the Foot to draw off with the Can∣non
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
and Carriages to <HI>Wyburg,</HI> on which the Enemy
seem'd to have an Eye; and the rather because
the General discover'd part of their Troops
marching along the Sea side, to get behind him; the
Foot retir'd in excellent order, while the General
taking the Advantage of the Ground with the
Cavalry alone, kept the Enemy in play (with
a Bravery not to be paralell'd) four Hours toge∣ther,
when the <HI>Muscovites</HI> retir'd, but threaten'd to
return in a short time: By a List of the Prisoners
taken and carryed away by the <HI>Muscovites</HI> upon
this incursion, there are three Colonels, two Majors,
eighteen Captains, Twenty-five Lieutenants, three
Cornets, seventeen Ensigns; a Thousand Soldiers,
and a great Number of other Persons of both
Sexes.</P>
<P>HERE his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty contriv'd the Scheme,
and actually laid the Foundation of a new For∣tress
at the Entrance of the <HI>Nye</HI> or <HI>Neva,</HI> the In∣let,
which opens the Communication between the
Lake <HI>Ladoga,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick;</HI> which Fortress he
called <HI>Croonslot</HI> and farther up his Majesty has
begun to build a Town, which he has call'd after
his own Name <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> or according to some
St. <HI>Petersburgh.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was at first but a small Place, but since is
become a Royal City, and at present contains,
besides publick Edifices, Churches, and a Magni∣ficient
Pallace, not yet quite finish'd above Thirty
Thousand Houses.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty having now, as has been
alledg'd Dispeopled the populous Provinces of <HI>Li∣vonia</HI>
and <HI>Ingria,</HI> made the poor People some a∣mends
by a Proclamation, or Placart, inviting
all the Families, not of those Countries, but of
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
all other Countries to come and Settle in his Do∣minions,
and was to the purpose following, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>TO Invite all Sorts of Artificers, Workmen,
and People using Manufactures, and other Per∣sons
professing Trades and Sciences, to come and
Settle in his Dominions; promising them, that so
soon as they arriv'd upon the Frontiers, they shall
be conducted where they please to Settle; that they
shall have the free Exercise of their Religion,
and the convenience of Churches; that they shall
have the Liberty to employ themselves in what∣soever
they shall think most for their Advantage,
without being Subject to any Duties, Offices or
Imposts: That as for those who shall find them∣selves
capable to undertake any Trade, and shall
not have where withal to follow it, his Majesty
promises to supply them with Money out of
his Treasury, without any Interest; and Lastly,
as are at any time unwilling to stay in his Domi∣nions,
shall have Licenses to depart, and at their
first Request shall be conducted at the <HI>Czar's</HI> ex∣pences
to the Frontiers, or to any Sea-Port.</P>
<P>HIS Majesties Armies rang'd now freely over
both these Provinces, only with this Exception,
that the great Towns in <HI>Livonia, &amp;c.</HI> were still in
the Hands of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> but having secur'd all
behind him, by the taking of the Places above∣mention'd,
as also of <HI>Notteburg</HI> and of <HI>Nyenschans.</HI>
His Majesty now resolv'd to begin with the other
in the next Place, and so finish the Reduction of
<HI>Livonia.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>December,</HI> 1702, the City of <HI>Narva</HI> had like
to have been surpriz'd; but tho' the <HI>Russians</HI> miss'd
their aim as to the Place, yet they did a great
deal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mischief to the Suburbs, and defeated a
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
strong Party of <HI>Swedes,</HI> which defended them:
The Story is told thus,</P>
<P>UPON the last Day of the last Year, accord∣ing
to our Account, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> made an In∣cursion
in the Night time, by the Favour of the
Ice, and after they had surpriz'd the advanc'd
Guards, advanc'd under the very Cannon of the
City, and committed great Disorders in the Neigh∣bouring
Villages, which they laid in Ashes,
making a great Slaughter of the Inhabitants, as al∣so
of some Soldiers that were Quarter'd among
them; they have also reduc'd into heaps of Rub∣bish
several Houses in the Suburbs; two Sawing
Mills, several Country Habitations, notwithstand∣ing
that the great Guns from the City and
the Castle of <HI>Ivanagrod,</HI> continually fir'd upon
them: That they might get more easily into
Peoples Houses, they run about the Streets knock∣ing
at the Doors, and crying out in the Language
of the Country, <HI>usa, usa, vendein tules,</HI> fly, fly, the
<HI>Russians</HI> are a coming; then upon the People open∣ing
their Doors to know what-was the matter, be∣lieving
them to be their Friends, the <HI>Muscovites<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
rush'd into their Houses and put all to the Sword,
not sparing either Age or Sex, that could not e∣scape
to the City, the Cavalry of the Garrison
sally'd out upon them, but were beaten back to
their very Counterscarp; this bloody Execution
continu'd six Hours.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Swedes</HI> went to wreck every where,
and the victorious <HI>Russians</HI> carried all before them;
the <HI>Czar</HI> himself pleas'd with Success, and resolv'd
to push his good Fortune, came down in Person to
the Army, which he had ordered to besiege the
City of <HI>Dorpat;</HI> the Place made a good Defence,
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
but they found that the Case was altered, the <HI>Mus∣covite</HI>
Engineers proceeded as regularly in their
Approaches as any other of the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI>
and attacked, and assualted as boldly, and as
punctually as possible: The Outworks were carried
by degrees, being well defended, and well attack'd;
In a Word, after about 27 Days open Trenches,
the Garrison finding they could not hold out, and
that no relief was to be expected, beat a Parly,
and had very honourable Conditions; they sur∣render'd
the 26th of <HI>July,</HI> and were conducted
to <HI>Riga:</HI> Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty appear'd on Horse∣back
with his Sword in his hand, at the Head of
his Guard du Corps when the Garrison march'd out,
and the Governour saluting his Majesty, he was
pleas'd to return it with great Civility, and
at the Governours request afterwards granted him
leave to go to <HI>Narva,</HI> tho' the City was then
Block'd up by his Forces under General <HI>Schein.</HI></P>
<P>THE Affairs of <HI>Poland</HI> were now come to a
strange <HI>Crisis,</HI> and such as particularly oblig'd his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty to concern himself more than or∣dinarily
with them; for the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had
so far push'd his Conquest as to bring the <HI>Poles</HI> to
an Election of a new King, and carried on his
particular Resentments against King Augustus, to
that extremity of Rage, as nothing could abate
it; no Treaties, no Proposals, no Mediation of
foreign Powers could interpose, so as to bring
him to any Terms.</P>
<P>NOW was the time for a generous Prince to engage
heartily for his Friend; I call <HI>Augustus</HI>
such, because has <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty openly professes
in his Letter to the States or Republick of <HI>Poland,</HI>
that he had always entertain'd a personal Friend∣ship,
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
for the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and now <HI>I say</HI> was the
time to show it.</P>
<P>AS for the King of <HI>Poland</HI> himself, to give due
honour to his Merit, he never gave out; he fought
his Ground by Inches, he struggl'd with an In∣vincible
Spirit against all the Difficulties that sur∣rounded
him: He had a terrible Prince in the
Bowels of his Country to deal with, a factious
divided and unsteady People to govern, who
were neither reasonable in their Demands of him,
or satisfy'd when they were granted; who were
never with him till they were brib'd to it with
Money, nor faithful to him when they had it; who
when they oppos'd him, ruin'd their Country,
and when they joyn'd, ruin'd him; who had Trea∣chery
enough to do him Mischief, and not Cou∣rage
enough to do him Good; out of Action, al∣ways
Insolent, in Action always Cowardly; who
when they should run, would always be for fight∣ing,
and when they should fight would always
run away: Never Man of Honour risqu'd his Life,
spent the Blood of a faithful Nation (his <HI>Saxons</HI>)
and such a mass of Treasure as he brought among
them, for a such a false perverse unperforming
Generation: Take the State of King <HI>Augustus</HI>'s
Case, and the Character of his <HI>Palish</HI> Friends in
the Words of a known Writer of that Day, <HI>Thus.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER nothing discourag'd the King, and
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> setting up a new King, not
only whetted his Courage, but animated those
few <HI>Poles,</HI> that Hood by him, and encreas'd
their Number, so that after the Election King <HI>Au∣gustus</HI>
grew stronger than he was before, nor would
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> have ever been able lo have
reduc'd him, had not the unlucky Defeat of a
new raised Body of <HI>Saxons</HI> open'd a Door to the
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
<HI>Swedes</HI> to enter <HI>Saxony;</HI> This brought the King
<HI>entirely</HI> down, and forc'd him to sigh the <HI>Chart<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Blanc</HI> to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and yeild to what∣ever
he demanded of him: Some particulars of
which were so hard, and so grating to a Man of
Spirit, as King Augustus is known to be, that the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> lost more honour in Imposing
them upon him, than the King of <HI>Poland</HI> did in
submitting to them; the former putting them up∣on
him, as matter of Triumph over his Misfor∣tunes,
and the other submitting to them purely to
prevent the intire Desolation of his Country, and
the ruin of his People; such were the delivering
up General <HI>Patkul,</HI> the writing a Letter to <HI>Stanis∣la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>
giving him the Title of King, and the
restoring the Trophies of his Valour, the Stan∣dards
and Colours taken at the great Battle of
<HI>Calisch,</HI> where he had defeated the whole united
Army of the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> and gain'd a com∣pleat
Victory over them, killing above 12000 on
the spot, and taking all their Cannon and Baggage,
with a great many Colours and Standards, all
which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> obliged him to re∣store.</P>
<P>BUT leaving the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to make War
as never Prince before him did, Namely to gain
Victories abroad, and loose his Country at Home;
to Conquer for other People, and be Conquered
for his own; invade <HI>Saxony,</HI> which he knew he
must quit and loose <HI>Livonia East-honia, Ingria,</HI> and
part of <HI>Finland,</HI> which he never shall recover; if
this be persuit of glory, be that fame peculiar
to himself, for he seem'd to be the only Prince in
the World that ever sought his Glory, at the Ex∣pence
of the Loss of his Dominions, and to cut
in p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ices the worthless <HI>Poles,</HI> sat still and let his
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
own Subjects be cut in peices, and his Dominions
ravag'd and made a desolation; his Subjects flying,
or being carried away, to People the Dominions of
the Conquerer.</P>
<P>BUT thus it was with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for
at the same time that he was thus pushing the
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and spending the Strength and
Arms of <HI>Sweden,</HI> to support a new Boy-King
in <HI>Poland;</HI> he abandon'd his faithful Subjects in
<HI>Livonia,</HI> and quietly let his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty go on
with an unterrupted Course of Conquest, not send∣ing
the least Relief to his besieged Cities, or to his
faithful Garrisons, till they all fell into his Enemies
Hands; for the <HI>Czar</HI> left him not a Foot of Land
on the South Shores of the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and took from
him Countries and Provinces, equal in Wealth
and Commerce, to his whole Kingdom of <HI>Swed∣land.</HI></P>
<P>IT was now that mindful of the Distress
that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was in, and that the
Republick was like to be brought to, his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, at the same time that with an
uninterrupted Course of Victory he rais'd his
Glory in the Conquest of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Dominions,
Concern'd himself in a more particular manner
for the Interest of King <HI>Augustus;</HI> and besides
the numerous Armies, which upon several Occasions,
he sent to his Relief, and tho' his Troops were
seldom well Treated in <HI>Poland,</HI> which made them
less Serviceable than they would otherwise have
been, yet he continu'd to Succour them by all pos∣sible
Methods.</P>
<P>To this End his Majesty wrote that famous Let∣ter
to the Republick; the Measures of which had
they thought fit to have persued, they had never
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
fallen a Prey as they did to the cruel Enemy, who
Triumph'd over them.</P>
<P>THIS Letter because the Contents of it were
dictated immediately from his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
own Mouth, and because it shows how perfectly
he was acquainted with the true Interest of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and with the Methods how their Liberty and Glo∣ry
was to be retriev'd, I shall give at large as it
was rendred in <HI>English</HI> at the time it was sent, <HI>as

<HEAD>The Letter of the Czar of Muscovy, to the Repub∣lick

<P>“PETER ALEXEWITZ, by the Grace of
GOD most Serene, and most Powerful great
Lord, Czar and great Duke of the whole Great,
Lesser, and <HI>White Russia,</HI> Soveraign of <HI>Musco∣vy,

<P>“TO the most Illustrious, most Eminent and

Archbishop of <HI>Geusne,</HI> Cardinal and Pri∣mate
of <HI>Poland;</HI> and to the most Illustrious ge∣nerous

<P>“MOST Illustrious, most Eminent, and most
Reverend Lord Archbishop and Cardinal, and
Reverend Primate of the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and Great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> most Illustious
generous and magnificient Lords, the Senators,
and other Ordrs of most Serene Republick of
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
<HI>Poland</HI> and great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania</HI> our
Friends, and most dear Neighbours, notwith∣standing
we have been inform'd a long time
since, and the like Reports were spread through
most part of <HI>Europe,</HI> that some of your Republick
led by the Motives of a certain inveterate Ha∣tred,
and full of wicked Intention, made use
of all possible Means to drive from his Throne
his sacred polish Majesty, our Brother, and
most dear Neighbour, who is in most strict Al∣liance
with us, that they may afterwards more
Effectually carry on the ill Designs they have
contriv'd, and more s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>afely obtain their Aim;
yet we had so good an Opinion of your Equity
and Justice, that not only we were unwilling to
give Credit to those Reports which came from all
Parts; but also forbore to consider the same, with
the serious Attention that they deserved from
our Thoughts, that if that Fury and abominable
Passion had crept amongst some of the Orders of
your Republick, yet the number of such who think
on what they owe to God, and their Country,
and to Honour and Virtue, would much exceed the
Number of those, who not duly weighing the
fatal Consequences of those Designs, have suf∣fered
themselves to be blinded by a depraved
Passion and their private Interests; we thought
also that those great Agitations being Supported
by no Christian Powers, would be easily ap∣peas'd
amongst your selves; but we have after∣terwards
observ'd, and are convinc'd by un∣questionable
Proofs, that that Evil was more and
more increasing and taking deeper Roots, we
thought it was our Duty more than any
body else to intervene, and express publickly
how much we were concern'd upon hearing of so
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
pernicious a Design, which does no ways become
a Christian Nation: In fine after having matu∣rely
consider'd that Point, we have resolv'd to
do by our Interposition what we believe every
honest Man is bound to do, especially consider∣ing
the great Office we exercise upon Earth, and
the general Obligation laid upon all Christian
Princes, by God and human Society, to expel
Violence and restrain Injustice, and such wicked
Advices, as tend to the subversions of Laws,
and to other ties of human Society, and disturb
the publick Peace of Christendom; so that Ju∣stice
may be every where administred, and In∣nocence
protected, that the common Cause of
Princes, and the Rights of Kings may be chiefly
preserved entire; that instead of that honou∣rable
Liberty allowed by the divine and human
Laws, which are deservedly made the Joy of free
Nations: People may not be carried away to
the Excesses of slighting Princes, and tramp∣pling
under Foot crown'd Heads, whose Ma∣jesty
is deriv'd immediately from God, that
the same may not be exposed to the Fury of
such as love Novelties. Lastly, that the fun∣damental
Laws establish'd by Nature its self
for the Preservation of human Society be not
destroyed, and that Men created in the Image
of God, may not degenerate into Brutes, and
live without any Law; besides all these Rea∣sons
we are particularly oblig'd to concern
our selves in this Affair, by Virtue of the
Peace concluded in the Year 1686, with the
Kingdom of <HI>Poland;</HI> wherein 'tis said in ex∣press
terms, that the brotherly Love, and in∣vincible
Peace be maintain'd between us and the
most Serene King of <HI>Poland;</HI> that they
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
mind the good Advantage of each other; that
as Brothers they may assist each other, and
that their Majesties are as others, bound to
show each other all the Duties of Humanity,
Friendship, and Brotherly Affection, and e∣very
thing else that may tend to their re∣spective
Advantage; and take all possible Care
to avoid all things which may breed Enmity,
or occasion Violence, and more especially such
as might create War, and occasion the effusion
of human Blood, and the ravage of their re∣spective
Countries, as it becomes Christian
Princes; and shall take care that no new Wars
and Divisions may break out upon any Ac∣count
whatever; all these things having been in
a solemn manner Sworn to upon the Book of the
Gospel, the Successors in both Kingdoms are in∣disputably
bound thereto: Grounded upon these
Foundations we have contracted a personal
Friendship with the most serene King of <HI>Poland,</HI>
now reigning, and Concluded with him an Alli∣ance
more strict and particular than the former;
whereby above all other things we have pro∣mis'd
each other, that as long as Providence
would preserve us our Kingdoms, which may
God render happy, we should always, and re∣giously
maintain a sincere Friendship, and per∣form
to each other all the Duties of a good
Neighbourhood; that we should never infringe
the same, but rather should mutually defend
one another against all our Enemies whatso∣ever;
moreover, we are oblig'd to concern our
selves in this Affair, because of the great Care
we are strictly to provide for the Peace and
Soveraignty of our Territories situated on the
Frontiers of <HI>Poland;</HI> for while we see a sire
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
kindled in our Neighbourhood, and threatning
to put all in Flames, we ought to think our
selves concerned in that eminent Danger, and
fear that those Flames may spread themselves
into our Dominions, and deprive them of the
Conveniences a peaceful Neighbourhood does us∣ual
procure; In short, we know what sort of
Monst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er some of you Nourish in your Bosom
against us, making no scruple to entertain such
pernicious Designs, and being not ashamed to
say publickly that after having put in executi∣on
what they nave contriv'd against the sacred
Person of his Majesty, they wall join our Ene∣my,
which is however directly contrary to
the perpetrated Peace aforesaid, which was ob∣tain'd
with the effusion of much human Blood;
for amongst the several Conditions to settle the
stability of the Peace between the two Nati∣ons,
with the most serene King and Republick
of <HI>Poland;</HI> it is expresly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tipulated, that his
Majesty, and his Successors who shall be
Elected after him; the great Dukes of <HI>Lithua∣nia</HI>
and the whole Republick of the Crown of
<HI>Poland,</HI> and great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> the
Ecclesiastical and secular Orders of each Nati∣on
promise to favour no ways our declared or
secret Enemies, neither by themselves, nor by
others to have any Correspondence with them,
and never to suffer them to commit the least
Hostility: To the End then, that this fire which
lies concealed under these treacheous Ashes may
be extinguished in a due time, before it breaks
out into a Flame, and that abominable Design
abhorred of God and Man, perfidiously to break
an Oath, and violate what has been solemnly
Sworn to, may be stifled in its beginning; we have
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
concern'd our selves in this Affair, being satis∣fied
that we have sufficiently shown to all the
World that it is our Duty and Right to interpose
our selves therein, and have thought fit in the first
Place to appeal our selves to your most serene
Republick, and induce you by this friendly
Exhortation to weigh every thing in this ex∣tremity,
and to admonish without interruption,
such who entertain those pernicious Designs,
(detested by all good Men) to reflect upon them∣selves,
and consider what they undertake, and
that they not only expose their Honour and Re∣putation,
but likewise the Security of their
Country to an evident Danger.”</P>
<P>“THE Reasons upon which they fancy they may
ground the dethroning of a King elected ac∣cording
to Law, a re-acknowledg'd by his great∣est
Enemies to appear so unjust and frivilous to
uninterested Persons, that the Authors of
those Councils cannot avoid the Name and Cha∣racter
of Enemies and perfidious Men, which
have been bestowed upon them by their own
Brothers, nor hinder all Christian Princes, and
especially such, who are oblig'd by Treaties or
Reasons of State to Defend, and Protect the
sacred Majesty of Kings from opposing with
all their might the Election of another Person,
to the prejudice of the publick Good of Chri∣stendom,
and puting a stop to those impious De∣signs:
They cannot be ignorant that his sacred
Majesty as Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> has still Forces e∣nough
to repell those Hostilities, and main∣tain
the good Cause and Right, he has once
acquired; and rather the more, because the best
Part of the most serene Republick, in conside∣ration
of their Duty, and their Oath, have de∣clar'd
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
their Readiness to spill their Blood for
their King, and Sacrifice their Lives and Re∣putation
for his Defence, to the immortal Glory
of them, and their Posterity; and what can be
the End of all this, but to make their own Coun∣try
a Theatre of War, and open a large Field
for the Plunder and Devastation of their Neigh∣bouring
Nations? As to the Authors of this De∣sign,
and such who favour them, they will re∣ceive
the punishment they justly deserve; they
will bring a blot upon themselves and their Po∣sterity,
which shall never be wip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of, and sinking
at last under, the weight of Divine Justice,
which never leaves those attempts unpunished,
they will deplore their own Misfortunes, but
too late.”</P>
<P>“As to those among you who have Cause to
complain, for we know very well, that the
whole most Serene Republick is not hurried a∣way
by that impiety, but is for the major Part
inclined for the King, we may say that 'tis cer∣tain
that God himself, and the best and most
prudent Princes cannot equally please all the
World, and that the Chagrin and Disatisfaction
of some proceed from particular Affections,
which usually sway the Words and the Writings,
and from Passion and private Interest of Parties;
but although they had just Cause of Complaint,
which does not hitherto appear, they ought for
all that to consider, that those political Distem∣pers
do not occasion so much Danger to the Re∣publick,
as commonly do the means which, some
are endeavouring to make use of as a remedy in
the present Case, and to neglect the Friendly and
Amicable ways prescrib'd by the fundamental
Laws of <HI>Poland,</HI> even to the offended Party,
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
and have immediately recourse to Violence and
Extremities, is a Practice contrary to the di∣vine
and human Laws.”</P>
<P>“IF the Authors of these Novelties should by
the permission of God, for some secret Rea∣sons
of which there are some Instances obtain
their Aim, what would they Gain thereby? ex∣cept
to suffer somewhat sooner or later the Pu∣nishment
due to their Wickedness, and their
Posterity shall never wash off the Infamy they
have brought upon themselves, and their Nati∣on;
the Assistance of a Foreign Prince encourages
them in this Design, but the Event will enable
them to make a true Judgement of their Acti∣ons,
and time will show their vanity in build∣ing
such great things on a sandy Foundation,
and that they have rely'd on a broken Reed;
they have taken for the Defender of the Cause;
and have espous'd a Prince, who for recom∣pensing
himself for the trouble he must be at,
and reimburse himself of the Expences and
Charges, will seize upon after having ruined
their whole Country; we think it needless to en∣large
any further upon a Subject of so dangerous
a Consequence, and flatter our selves that such
who desire the Preservation of their Republick,
amongst whom there is a great Number of Sena∣tors
and good Patriots will exert their utmost
Prudence to make their Brethren sensible of
their Mistake, and bring back into the right
way such who have been seduc'd; as to the rest,
we declare to the most Serene Republick, that
we are resolved to Interpose our good Offices,
and in Order that such who remembring what
they owe to God, their King and Country, have
promis'd to lay down their Lives for his Ma∣jesty,
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
and likewise such who have the impu∣dence
to oppose their Prince, and stir Heaven
and Earth to obtain their Aim, may equally
know our Intentions towards them; we do
offer with a sincere Heart our good Offices
to pacify the Divisions and Quarrels which have
been excited between his Sacred <HI>Polish</HI> Ma∣jesty,
and some Members of the most Serene
Republick, out of our Affection for our Bro∣ther,
Friend and good Neighbour; and are ful∣ly
perswaded that God's blessing, and the Assi∣stance
of our Friends, and Confederates con∣cerned
therein, we shall restore Peace, Union
and Prosperity to the satisfaction of both Parties,
and the common Advantage of the Kingdom of
<HI>Poland,</HI> and Great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania;</HI> doubt∣ing
not in the least, but that this offer of our
good Offices proceeding from the sincerity of
our Heart will appear free from all Suspicions
to the respective Parties; for as his Sacred Ma∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty
is fully assured of our constant Friendship,
and Brotherly Affection, so the most Serene
Republick may firmly rely upon our plain and
sincere Intentions, whereby we are induced
to Protect their Liberty in Consideration of the
perpetual Peace herein alledged; therefore we
friendly invite by this Letter to a speedy
and Categorical answer, that we may know
whether our Offers are accepted with the same
Dispositions for the Peace and Tranquility of
<HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Luthania,</HI> as we do prosess before
God we have at this time.”</P>
<P>“HOWEVER we shall continue the neccssary
Preparations, that in Case the disastected Party
persist in their wicked Designs, we may be able
to exert the power God has given us to Support

and Maintain his Sacred Majesty on a Throne
he is lawfully possess'd of: As to those who shall
side with the King, or shall in a due time re∣turn
to their Duty, we shall grant them our
special Favour, and show them as much Affecti∣on,
as if they had done something for our selves,
and promoted our own Advantage; promising
to assist them with all our Power for pacifying
these troubles; but for such who oppose the most
Serene King of <HI>Poland</HI> their Soveraign, and will
not desist from their pernicious Design, we de∣clare
them our Enemies, with all their Ad∣herents,
and shall punish them as such every

them, till those Disturbers of the publick
Peace, and Enemies of their Country, as they
have been justly called by their own Countrymen

Neighbourhood is cleared of those wicked Men,
and that this Letter may be of greater force,
and that not only the Serene Republick, but
also all the World may know that this is our
Design, and Resolution; we shall communicate
this Declaration to all the Princes who favour

<P>IN Consequence of this Letter, and at the Request
of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty order∣ed
a Body of 45000 Men, Choice Troops and very
well appointed to march to the Frontiers of <HI>Po∣land,</HI>
on the Side of <HI>Sendomir,</HI> and there to re∣ceive
Orders from the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> which they
did very opportunely for the Service of that
Prince, who was closely pursued by the <HI>Swedish</HI>
General <HI>Rhenschild</HI> with an Army much Superi∣or
to his own, and was oblig'd to pass the <HI>Vistule</HI>
at <HI>Petrowinnear sendomir,</HI> and break down the

Army of his own, and the Swedish General was
glad to retreat in his turn to <HI>Cracow.</HI></P>
<P>THUS his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty gave a Turn to the
Affairs of <HI>Poland,</HI> and King <HI>Augustus</HI> from this
time appear'd every Day more formidable than
other: Here at <HI>sendomir</HI> he Summon'd a great
Council from all the Palatinates which continu'd
faithful to him, and they all under the Encourage∣ment
of the Strength and Figure he appeared in,
took now a new Oath to him in Opposition to
the Confederate Rebels, who by the Politicks and
Influence of the <HI>Swedes</HI> pretended to declare an
<HI>Interregnum,</HI> and choose a new King.</P>
<P>IN this Assembly they declar'd their abhorence
of that perfidious Conventicle, which call'd them∣selves
a Diet met at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> and took a new Oath,
obliging themselves to oppose it with all their
Might: In the next Place they declared, That any
Prince who shall take upon him the Title of King
of <HI>Poland</HI> or shall stand Candidate in the pretended
Election, shall be deem'd the Enemy and Tyrant
of the Country; the Primate and the Bishop of
<HI>Pozen</HI> being look'd upon as the chief Authors Pro∣moters
of these troubles, not minding and the
King's favours towards them, were declared Ene∣mies
of their Country, Infamous and Rebels. And
Application is ordred to be made to the Pope, That
those Prelates be proceeded against by Excommu∣nication,
and other Censures of the Church, as be∣ing
the occasion of the Effusion of so much Chri∣stian
Blood, and that in the mean time, their
Revenues shall be seiz'd and confisticated; the

Marshal of the Crown, and others who have enter∣ed
into the Confederacy at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> are declar'd
Rebels, and condemn'd as such, unless within
four Weeks they quit the Party of the Rebels, and
return to the Obedience of their Soveraign,
which favour was granted them upon the King's
earnest desire, that such who shall return to their
Duty, shall have their Pardon without any Re∣striction,
and shall be paid off their Arrears, if
they are in Service; that the Governours and Com∣manders
of the Fortresses of the Kingdom shall
no longer respect the Orders of the Marshal of

the Marshal of the Royal Confederacy for King

being subscrib'd and confirm'd by Oath, the
Royal Confederacy repair'd to Church, where
Te <HI>Deum</HI> was Sung, to return Thanks for the U∣nanmity
of their Resolutions; The King has on
the other hand swore again to keep the <HI>Pacta Con∣venta,</HI>
that he shall not exact from the Republick
the Sums of Money he has borrowed; That his
<HI>Saxons</HI> Troops shall be under the Command and

<P>FINDING himself in this Posture, the King an

he resolv'd to beat up their Quarters; in pursu∣ance
of this Resolution he remov'd with all his
Calvalry, with the utmost Silence in the Night,
and without letting one Man in his whole Army
know any thing of his Design; he march'd direct∣ly
for <HI>Warsaw,</HI> he executed this Project with a
Celerity scarce Practicable, ordering his Infantry
to follow with all possible speed, and puting his
Cannon into Boats on the <HI>Vistula:</HI> In this
Posture before his Enemies had the least Notice
of his being Decamp'd from <HI>Sendomir,</HI> he appear∣ed
at the Gates of <HI>Warsaw,</HI> in the Morning, before
it was quite break of Day, and invested the Place:
The Confusion it occasion'd to those within, may
a little be guess'd at, and the Success of it is a
little describ'd in the following Account, which
tho' not so very much relating to the Affairs of

King <HI>Augustus</HI> took possession thereof the 3d in the
Morning, but they were forbidden to Plunder,
the Magistrates having promised to pay 50000
Rix Dollars; the same Day General <HI>Brandt,</HI> who
had pass'd the <HI>Vistule</HI> with 6000 <HI>Cossacks</HI> and
1000 <HI>Saxon</HI> Horse, made preparations to attack
the Castle, and a Battery of 4 Pieces of Cannon
was erected the 4th in the Morning to Batter the
same: This oblig'd General <HI>Horn</HI> to surrender
with all the Officers Soldiers, and other Adherents
of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> therein Prisoners of War, the King
having refus'd to grant them any other Terms. The
State Prisoners were the Bishop of <HI>Posnania,</HI> who
proclaim'd the new King; the <HI>Sieurs Waslager,</HI> and
<HI>Palemberg</HI> Plenipotentiaries of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI>

taken in the Castle; the Sieur <HI>Walschlager</HI> being
born a Subject of the Republick, King <HI>Augustus</HI>
has not showed the same regard towards him, as
towards the Sieur <HI>Palemberg,</HI> and has sent him Pris∣oner
into <HI>Saxony</HI> with the Bishop of <HI>Posnania,</HI> and
the two Sons of the <HI>Castellan</HI> of <HI>Cracow:</HI> General
<HI>Horn</HI> obtain'd leave to go to the <HI>Swedish</HI> Camp up∣on
his Parole of Honour, to surrender himself
Prisoner in <HI>Saxony,</HI> within two Months time, un∣less
his Liberty was obtain'd before.</P>
<P>IN a very few Days after this Action, the King
of <HI>Poland</HI> pass'd the <HI>Vistula</HI> again at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> and
advancing towards <HI>Silesa,</HI> encamp'd at a Place
call'd <HI>Whipsogrod,</HI> where he receiv'd a Body of
16000 <HI>Saxons,</HI> all fine Troops, and their Cavalry
exceeding well Mounted, and to join whom it
was, that he March'd that way, for he immediate∣ly
returned.</P>
<P>ALL this while the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> whose
Fate it often was to be wining a great way off, and
loseing nearer home, was advanc'd as far as the
farthest part of <HI>Poland,</HI> and was attacking <HI>Lem∣berg,</HI>
which he took, and his Men exercised such
there unheard of Cruelties upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> and o∣ther
Inhabitants to Extort from them the Discove∣ry
of their Treasure, that made all the Christian
World astonish'd, and made the Name of a <HI>Swede</HI>
odious to the whole <HI>Polish</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>WHILE these things were doing his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty
went on in a rapid Course of interrupted
Victory in <HI>Livonia,</HI> and having taken the whole
Province of <HI>Ingria,</HI> as above, taken <HI>Nyenschans,</HI>
and <HI>Dorpat</HI> by Composition, raz'd <HI>Schansterney,</HI>
built <HI>Petersburgh, Croonslot,</HI> and all the Forts on
the Entry of that Royal Port, His Majesty now
resolv'd on the attack of <HI>Narva,</HI> and the Fort on
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
the other Side of the River call'd <HI>Ivanagrod:</HI> He
had held the Place block'd up for some time, but
now he resolv'd to push the Siege with the utmost
Vigour.</P>
<P>AND here the Governour found the difference be∣tween
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> attacks now, and in the former
Siege: The Trenches were open'd the 27th of <HI>Au∣gust,</HI>
and the Place batter'd with 40 Pieces of hea∣vy
Cannon, and 12 Mortars. The Batteries were
so well serv'd, and the Defences of the Besieg'd
so effectually beaten down, that after 13 Days
open Trenches, the <HI>Russians</HI> gave a general Assault,
and manag'd it so well, mounting the Breach
with such Bravery, that tho' the Garrison which
consisted of 1600 Men, besides Burghers, defend∣ed
themselves with the utmost Bravery, the <HI>Rus∣sians</HI>
entered the Place, Sword in hand, and put
the Garrison, and arm'd Burghers to the Sword;
the <HI>Swedes</HI> not calling for Quarter, but defending
themselves, as it may be said to the last Man.</P>
<P>I NEED say no more to convince the Reader
how the <HI>Russians</HI> were now improv'd in the Affairs
of War, than to show how they behav'd on e∣very
occasion, and particular in the attacking
of this Town, which is now Storm'd in 13 Days,
open Trenches, whereas General <HI>Horn</HI> formerly
Defended it six Weeks against 100000 Men, till
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> came and reliev'd it.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Czar's</HI> Disgrace, as it was call'd be∣fore
<HI>Narva</HI> was compleatly wip'd out: People
began to enquire by what Magick his Majesty had
infus'd Courage and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duct into the <HI>Russians,</HI>
who before were the Contempt of all the Soldiery
of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THE Castle of <HI>Ivanag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od,</HI> opposite to <HI>Narva,</HI>
held out for some Days, but seeing the <HI>Russians</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
go seriously to Work with them, and fearing to
share the same Fate with the City, the Gover∣nour
beat a Parly, after sustaining a prodigious
Battery for six Days: In short he Surrendered the
Fortress upon honourable Conditions.</P>
<P>As to the City of <HI>Narva,</HI> being taken by
Storm, it was given up to Plunder as a reward of
the Labours of the Soldiery, only that they were
forbid to kill any of the Inhabitants, except such
as were arm'd, and made Resistance: In the Heat
of this Execution the <HI>Czar</HI> gave such Orders, and
took care to have them so well executed, that the
Ware-Houses of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants,
and also their Dwelling-Houses and Families
were not touch'd; no, tho' upon the Assurances gi∣ven
them of Safety, they suffer'd their Houses to
be a Retreat for many of the Citizens, and for an
immense Treasure, which they brought to them
for Preserving it from the Soldiers.</P>
<P>HAVING thus made an Entrance upon the Sea-Coast,
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty divided his Army into
three Bodies, and sent one Part to block up <HI>Revel,</HI>
and the other <HI>Riga,</HI> ordering the other Part to co∣ver
their Camp, and Guard the Passes into the
Country, being resolved to reduce those two im∣portant
Places, before any Relief could come to
them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER for some time his Majesty deserred
his Resolution to Besiege them in Form being cal∣led
off to yeild a yet more powerful Assistance to
his distres'd Allie the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> in order
to which, he order'd an Army of 60000 Men to
draw together in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> with which his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty resolv'd to Advance in Person,
and give the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> Battle; as the only
way to make a short End of the Desola∣tions
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
of <HI>Poland,</HI> and drive his Enemies out of the
County.</P>
<P>BUT as he was now for the first time entering
<HI>Poland,</HI> at the Head of an Army to make War as
I may call it in his own Name, tho' for the Inte∣rest
of the King of <HI>Augustus;</HI> he published a Mani∣festo
to the <HI>Polish</HI> Nation, and to the <HI>Lithuanians,</HI>
signifying to them his Reasons for entering their
Country with an Army, a Piece which will for
ever record the Justice of the attempt, and con∣vince
Posterity also of the Necessity of it at that
time: The <HI>Manefesto</HI> therefore, is worth their peru∣ssing,
who think it worth while to acquaint them∣selves
with the History of those Times; the whole
at large is as follows, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>“WE by the Grace of God, the most Illustri∣ous,
and most Potent <HI>Czar,</HI> and great Duke,
<HI>Peter Alexewitz,</HI> absolute Soveraign of the Great∣er,
Lesser, and <HI>White Russia,</HI> and Hereditary
Successor, Lord of several Principalities and
Countries, in the East, and West, Northern Parts
of the World.”</P>
<P>“SIGNIFY hereby to the Illustrious and Magni∣ficent
Senators. Dignitaries, both Spiritual and
Temporal, and the rest of the great Officers,
and Nobility of the most Serene Republick of
<HI>Poland,</HI> and the great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> that
we pursuant to the perpetual Peace, concluded
formerly between both Nations, and the subse∣quent
Alliances made with his Majesty <HI>Augustus</HI>
II, and the whole Republick of <HI>Poland,</HI> for a
mutual Prosecution of the War against our com∣mon
Enemy, have employ'd our utmost endea∣vours
to oblige that Enemy, who has invaded
the Republick of <HI>Poland</HI> to retire out of it; and
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
to prevent the Effects of such impious Factions,
as either for Interest, or fear of the Enemies
Power and Threats, have endeavoured these
two Years past to Dethrone their lawful King;
we have formerly declared our Abhorrence of
such perfidious Proceedings, in a Letter sent to the
whole Republick, wherein we acquainted them
at the same time that we were bound by the
strongest Ties of Brotherly Love and Alliances;
and by our own Inclinations to defend the com∣mon
Rights of Princes to prevent such a horri∣ble
Design, which deserves the severest Expres∣sions
of God's Vengeance and Wrath; and that
we should be oblig'd to look upon such Rebels
to their King and the Republick, as our Ene∣mies,
and pursue them with Fire and Sword;
these our Exhortations and Warnings had such
good Effect at first, that the Fire which had be∣gun
to spread itself, seem'd extinguish'd, but
as appears soon after, it was only hid under de∣ceitful
Ashes till the <HI>Swedes</HI> did blow it up a∣gain
into a sudden Flame, and the <HI>Waywod</HI> of
<HI>Posen, Lescinsky</HI> was unlawfully elected by a
small Number of inconsiderable Persons to be
King, contrary to the Sentiments of many of
the Confederates that appear'd at the Electi∣on,
and in opposition to the Liberties, and
Rights, not only of <HI>Poland,</HI> but the whole uni∣verse;
and this detestable Act was not only
protested against by the Archbishop and Cardi∣nal
Primate <HI>Radziowski,</HI> and other Senators of
the first Rank, though they had at that time
quarrel with their lawful Prince; but the Mar∣shal
of the Confederated Nobility could never
be perswaded to give his consent to this illegal
Choice; but the <HI>Swedish</HI> notwithstanding, persist∣ing
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
ing obstinately in his Design, and exerci∣sing
an absolute Power on the Republick, has
compelled some of the Nobility to conclude a
Treaty with the <HI>Swedes;</HI> Envoys, in the Name
of the elected, who very submissively hearken
to the Dictates of the <HI>Swedes:</HI> Part of the afore∣said
Confederates were indeed taken Prisoners
by their lawful King, and the rest were dis∣pers'd;
but not only the distance of our main
Army, and the Animosities between the Forces
of the Republick, but also the small Number
of <HI>Saxons,</HI> soon after oblig'd the foremention'd
King <HI>Augusus</HI> to march to <HI>Saxony,</HI> with part of
his <HI>Saxon</HI> Troops, in order to prevent the in∣tended
Invasion of the <HI>Swedes</HI> in that Electorate;
He design'd to return soon to <HI>Poland,</HI> but his
return has hitherto been obstructed by the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> who have shut up all the Passages, this
emboldened the Enemy to publish in the Name
of the Cardinal Primate, Circular Letters con∣firming
the foremention'd unlawful Election,
and having call'd together the petty Dyetts the
26 of <HI>June,</HI> a general one was Summon'd to meet
the 11th of the next ensuing Month; we cannot
believe that these Universalia were issued
by the Cardinal Primate, who being not only
the Head of the Clergy, but also the first Mem∣ber
of the Republick, was chiefly concern'd to
endeavour a Reconciliation between the Sub∣jects
of <HI>Poland,</HI> and their lawful Prince; so
that we have Reason to think that this unlaw∣ful
Assembly of the Deputies of <HI>Poland,</HI> was
purely contriv'd by the subtile Enemy, as may
partly appear by the false Rumours spread by
him, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the King of <HI>Prussia</HI> disponding
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
of a Reconciliation between King <HI>Augustus,</HI> and
the <HI>Swedes,</HI> had embrac'd the Party of the King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the elected Person; the falshood
of this imputation is manifest by the Letter
sent to the King of <HI>Prussia</HI> by the Cardinal upon
this Account, and although the King of Prussia be∣ing
a neutural Prince in this War, has not been
adverse to the Party of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> yet we are
assur'd that he will not Recognize the elected
Person, in regard it would injure all crown'd
Heads, who in this World have none above them,
besides the Omnipotent Judge, who according
to his holy Will and Pleasure deposes Kings,
and places others in their room; so that we
cannot imagine this detestable Practice, which
is so abhorr'd in the sight of God can be
approved by Men; even, if not only a small
Number, but also all the Subjects should with∣out
sufficient Cause presume to dethrone their
Prince in compliance with his Enemies desires;
for which Reason we are confident, that the
faid <HI>Universalia</HI> were publish'd by the Enemy,
who therein make mention of the desolations
of the Country of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the depredations
committed upon the holy Churches and Lands;
but the Persons guilty thereof was not Named,
yet it was propos'd therein, to call a general
Diet to prevent such Grievances for the future,
and that the best expedient for that End would
be to confirm the illegal Choice of the <HI>Waywod</HI> of
<HI>Posen,</HI> and to depend upon the Promises of the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as though he were come into
<HI>Poland</HI> to preserve the violated Laws of the Re∣publick;
we do verily believe that only such
as are blinded by Bribes, will give any Credit to
this cunning, dangerous and pernicious Deceit,
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
the plundering the Towns and Castles in <HI>Poland</HI>
and <HI>Lithuania</HI> of their Wealth, Ornaments, Am∣munition
and Artillery; the Churches and Mo∣nastries
of the Relicts of Saints, their Orna∣ments
and their very Bells; and the Oppressi∣ons
of the Waywodships and other Lands by in∣tollerable
Taxes exacted there, show what a
Friend to <HI>Poland</HI> the <HI>Swede</HI> is, notwithstanding
all his pretences that he is to come into <HI>Poland,</HI>
not to seek his own Interest, but to Protect the
Republick, and by the assuming the Soveraign∣ty
of <HI>Courland,</HI> and giving his General <HI>Lewen∣haupt</HI>
the Title of Vice Governour of that
Country, it may be apprehended he will do
the like by some forfeited Towns in <HI>Prussia:</HI>
These things consider'd again, we do declare
that we will defend our Brother and Allie King
<HI>Augustus</HI> to the utmost of our Power, by vertue
of our solemn Alliances with that Prince, and
the Republick, and are for that End resolv'd up∣on
the Petition deliver'd to us in the Name of
the Republick to advance in Person with an
Army into <HI>Poland,</HI> without any regard to our
own Interest; and therefore we notify to all the
States of the Republick to forbear coming to
any Congress, or coming themselves to such as
are Assembled at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> in favour of the
Elected, on pain of being punish'd in their Per∣sons
and Possessions, with Fire and Sword; and
to prevent any Plea of Ignorance, we require
all Sons of their Native Country, after they
shall have detected the Artifices of the Enemy,
to lay aside their private Animosities, and to joyn
unanimously for their common good; and in or∣der
thereunto to endeavour the expulsion of the
enemy who has disturb'd your Peace; we Pro∣mise,
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
on our Parole, that we will asist you herein
as a faithful Allie, having no Pretensions up∣on
you. And we testify, before God, that we
are advanc'd with our Forces into the Lands of
the Republick, meerly upon pressing Invitations
and Intreaties, and for the sake of your Interest
only. And that we demand for the Subsistance
of our Army, such Quantities of Bread as had
stipulated in our Alliance with the Republick,
and that we will enjoin our Forces, on Pain of
Death, to commit no Disorders in your Coun∣try.
We heartily wish that you will be unani∣mous,
and open your Eyes to your Welfare,
as the only Means to recover your Liberty.
We remain a Faithful Allie, and Affectionate
Friend.”</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> at this Time, was in no
Condition to meet such a Power, his Troops being
dispersed, and the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was himself in
<HI>Saxony,</HI> disposing Things as his Circumstances
would permit, to prevent the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s
falling into that Country. But his Army having
been defeated at the Battle of <HI>Frauenstadt,</HI> it was
not possible for him to raise another time enough
for the Work.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the King hearing that his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty was arrived in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> went Incogni∣to
from <HI>Saxony,</HI> and by his exceeding swift Riding,
having prevented any Design to intercept him,
arriv'd at <HI>Tycockzin,</HI> where the <HI>Russian</HI> Army lay,
and there it was, that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty let him,
see what an Army he had brought to serve him.
The Season of the Year not presenting any Op∣portunity
of immediate Action, and some new
Disorders having happen'd at <HI>Moscow,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
took a Resolution to go away Post thither, which
he did, leaving Prince <HI>Alexander Menzickoff</HI> to
Command the <HI>Russian</HI> Army, with positive Di∣rections
to obey the Orders of King <HI>Augustus</HI>
in all Things, as effectually as if it had been
his own.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, by his sudden coming
to <HI>Moscow,</HI> surpriz'd his Enemies, as he had done
more than once before, and having made some
Examples of Justice, and put to Death the prin∣cipal
Authors of the Treason, he soon return'd to
the Frontiers.</P>
<P>BUT I should have taken Notice that his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, before he came into <HI>Lithuania</HI>
with this Army, had been present at the taking
the Town of <HI>Mittau,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Courland.</HI>
The <HI>Swedes</HI> pretended that his Troops had receiv'd
a Defeat at their first Enterance into <HI>Courland,</HI> a
Body of 7000 <HI>Swedes</HI> under General <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> ha∣ving
attack'd them with great Vigour, and yet,
even in this Action, the <HI>Russians</HI> behav'd so well,
that in the Accounts which the <HI>Swedes</HI> themselves
publish'd of the Action, they have this Expres∣sion;
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Foot were cut down in Rank
and File, as they stood, for tho' they faw the
Horse broken, yet not a Man of them would
stir from their Post, tho' surrounded by the
Enemy.</P>
<P>BUT this Victory, as the <HI>Swedes</HI> would call it,
was far from an Overthrow, and far from reliev∣ing
their Cause; for about three Days after the
Battle, the <HI>Czar</HI> advanc'd with his whole Army,
and surpriz'd, as I observed above, and took
<HI>Mittau,</HI> with 900 <HI>Swedes</HI> in it Prisoners of War,
with a great Magazine of Military Stores and Pro∣vision
laid up there by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> which, as was
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
well observ'd by the Writers of those Times,
was but a very indifferent Token of their having
been beaten in a Set Battle, and 7000 of them
killed upon the Spot.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but immediately after this Bat∣tle,
I might have said this Victory, for such, in∣deed
it was to the <HI>Russians.</HI> General <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI>
retired out of the Country, and the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
General, Prince <HI>Czeremettoff,</HI> caused the City of
<HI>Riga</HI> to be besieged in Form, which for want of
Relief, was also taken about 2 Months after, the
Garrison having been reduced to the last Extre∣mity.</P>
<P>IT is hard to come at the Journals of these
Sieges, no particular Account of them having
been pnblish'd in the World, but this may Sum
up that Part; that while the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> went on pushing King <HI>Augustus</HI> with an implaca∣ble
Rage out of his Kingdom, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
over-run all the <HI>Swedish</HI> Dominions, on the South
Side of the Gulph of <HI>Finland,</HI> and even the
Dutchy <HI>Courland</HI> it self; this would have been
called a Diversion in King <HI>Augustus</HI>'s Favour, in
any Place in the World, but here; perhaps to any
Prince in the World, but to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> it
would have been so: For, who could have
suppos'd, that any Prince like this, would have
push'd on a remote Conquest, in which his own
proper Dominions were so little concerned, and
for the meer Satisfaction, or if you will, for the
Glory of pulling down a King, who he had already
sufficiently reduced; and at the same Time, suf∣fer
his own Hereditary Dominions to be torn from
him, his miserable Subjects ruined and ravaged
without Succour; his strong and most Important
Towns taken from him, without relieving them;
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
and his Brave Troops be beaten for want of Rein∣forcement.</P>
<P>HE that can do thus, may indeed say that no
Expedition of his Enemies, by way of Diversion,
can be a Relief to those he pushes with Revenge.
'Tis evident here, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> could
not be said to fight for Peace, but for Revenge and
Glory. For, it is evident, he might have glo∣ried
in making Peace, both with <HI>Poland,</HI> and the
<HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> also, upon very Honourable Con∣ditions.
But nothing would serve him but redu∣cing
and dethroning the One; after which, he
grew so opinionate, that he fancy'd he could do
the like by the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> Nay, and his
Ministers gave it openly out, that he had resol∣ved
to do it: And had Heaven suffer'd him to
have carry'd on his Victory that Length, 'tis not
doubted but he would have deposed all the Kings
of the Earth, if it had been in his Power.</P>
<P>BUT we must not anticipate our Relation of
Things, we shall in the Course of this History,
bring his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
nearer together in the War, than we have done
yet, in order to this, we shall begin with what
his Troops did in <HI>Poland,</HI> before the <HI>Czar</HI> came to
act in Person.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar,</HI> as I have said, had left the War in
<HI>Livonia</HI> to the Prince <HI>Czeremetoff,</HI> who managed
it with such Success, that he beat the <HI>Swedes</HI> upon
all Occasions, and at last compleated the Conquest
of <HI>Livonia,</HI> by taking the Towns of <HI>Riga, Pernau,
R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vel,</HI> and <HI>Neyen,</HI> with all the other Towns and
Forts of any Strength; Posted a strong Body of
Troops in <HI>Courland,</HI> to Cover <HI>Livonia</HI> from the Re∣turn
of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and then followed his Master,
the <HI>Czar▪</HI> into <HI>Lithuania.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166"/>
HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Troops in <HI>Livonia</HI> had
block'd up <HI>Riga,</HI> the <HI>Dunamund</HI> Schans was almost
ruined by a Disaster of Fire, which taking hold
of the Powder in the Magazein, blew it all up
with a terrible Noise, 300 of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Garrison
perishing in the Blast. This Accident caus'd the
<HI>Russian</HI> General <HI>Baver,</HI> who Commanded at <HI>Mit∣tau,</HI>
to advance towards <HI>Riga</HI> with 3000 Men, to
see if he could make any Advantage of that Acci∣dent,
but the Fate of that Place was not yet come.</P>
<P>WE are to understand now, that a great Coun∣cil
of State had been assembled by King <HI>Augustus</HI>
at <HI>Grodno,</HI> in <HI>Lithuania▪</HI> where the King met sthem,
and where they declar'd King <HI>Stanistaus</HI> a Traytor
and Usurper, and agreed to assist King <HI>Augustus</HI>
with the whole Army of the Crown, which was
to be made up to 36000 Men, and to furnish Mo∣ney
for their Payment.</P>
<P>THIS nettled <HI>Stanistaus,</HI> and he flies to the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> for Help, who drawing his Forces
together, pretended to march to attack King <HI>Au∣gustus</HI>
and his Army, at <HI>Tycockzin:</HI> But when he
found that the <HI>Russian</HI> Forces had join'd with him,
he thought better of it, and marched back, not
thinking it fit to venture his Army. The Parti∣culars
of this fruitless Attempt, was thus related
from the very Place, by a Person who was an Eye
Witness of it all.</P>

<HEAD>GRODNO, <DATE>Decemb. 31, 1705.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>“THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having decamp'd from
<HI>Bloni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> passed the <HI>Vistula</HI> with all his Forces the
28th Instant, on the Bridge of Boats; and from
thence continued his March with all Expedition
to attack the <HI>Muscovites</HI> at <HI>Grodno</HI> and <HI>Tycockzin,</HI>
the latter had secured the Bridges on the River
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
<HI>Bug.</HI> But the <HI>Swedes</HI> being favour'd by the great
Frost, they pass'd that River with all their Ar∣tilery
over the Ice. The <HI>Muscovites</HI> upon Ad∣vice
of his Approach, left 3000 Men in that
Place, under the Command of Lieutenant
General <HI>Ronne,</HI> with Orders to defend it to the
last Extremity, and march'd with the rest of
their Forces, quartered in those Parts, to join
the King of <HI>Poland</HI> at <HI>Grodno.</HI> That Prince
receiv'd Advice the 30st, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> having
not thought fit to attack <HI>Tycockzin,</HI> were in a full
March towards <HI>Grodno,</HI> and were already ad∣vanc'd
within 10 Leagues of his Camp; whereon
he held the 22d. a Council of War, with all the
<HI>Polish, Saxon,</HI> and <HI>Muscovite</HI> Generals; wherein
it was resolv'd, that the Army should continue
near <HI>Grodno,</HI> and expect the <HI>Swedes</HI> in Order of
Battle; and that to render the Approaches to
their Camp the more difficult, a considerable
Body of Troops were posted in a Wood, to secure a
Desile through which the <HI>Swedes</HI> would be oblig'd
to pass: They settled likewise in that Council
the Rank of the General Officers; the Right of
the Army was given to Velt Mareschal <HI>Ogliby;</HI>
and the Left to General <HI>Allard;</HI> and the Body
of the Battle was commanded by the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Prince <HI>Menzickoff;</HI> all under the Orders and
Direction of the King of <HI>Poland.</HI> This was the
Posture of Affairs in <HI>Lithuania</HI> the 23d past,
when the last Letters came away. But a Gen∣tleman
of the King of <HI>Polands,</HI> who is just now
arriv'd from thence, and who left the Court of
that Prince the 31ft, reports, that the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> being advanc'd in Sight of the <HI>Mus∣covite</HI>
Army, and finding the same advantagi∣cusly
posted; he did not think fit to attack the
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
King of <HI>Poland:</HI> And continu'd his March to∣wards
<HI>Wilna;</HI> his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty held thereupon
another Council of War, and according to the
Resolutions taken therein. He march'd imme∣diately
after, with a Detatchment of 3000 Horse
directly towards <HI>Warsaw,</HI> and was arriv'd at
<HI>Fokzen,</HI> in his way thither, when this Gentle∣man
was dispatched away; he adds, that Prince
<HI>Menzickoff</HI> is sent for <HI>Moscow,</HI> by express Or∣ders
of his Master, and has left the Command
of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army to Velt Marshal <HI>Ogliby;</HI>
the King of <HI>Poland</HI> endeavoured to fall upon
the Rear of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army, and a 1000 Dra∣goons
commanded by Major General <HI>Henke</HI> fell
upon their Baggage, and took 40 Waggons;
the Sieur <HI>Smigielski</HI> with his <HI>Poles,</HI> had also a
Skirmish with them, and took 3 Lieutenants,
with 50 Soldiers, besides the Secretary of <HI>Stanis∣laus.</HI>”</P>
<P>I have mention'd that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty ha∣ving
an Occasion to make a Tour to <HI>Moscow,</HI> left
his Troops in <HI>Lithuania</HI> with positive Orders to
obey the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the above Relation
will show a little how they behaved: But this
is not all, for I must new add that the King of
<HI>Poland</HI> led them the Path to Glory; taking a
strong Body of them with him, to the great Bat∣tle
of <HI>Kalish</HI> in <HI>Posnania,</HI> which follow'd soon after
the last recited Action.</P>
<P>IT must be observ'd here that the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> finding he could not weary out, or dis∣courage
his Indefatigable Enemy the King of
<HI>Poland;</HI> but if he was beaten in one Place he re∣vived
in another, and that the Confederated <HI>Pa∣latinates</HI>
in the South of <HI>Poland,</HI> who form'd the
Assembly of <HI>Sendomir,</HI> continu'd to Supply him
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
with Money, and Troops, and particularly the
famous <HI>Smegielski,</HI> and above all the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mus∣covy</HI>
in Person, whose Army having entered <HI>Li∣thuania,</HI>
had appear'd too strong to be attack'd, as
above, and had another Army ready to assist his
<HI>Polish</HI> Majesty, lying on the Frontiers of <HI>Sendo∣mir,</HI>
12000 of which had actually joyn'd him, and
that besides this, he receiv'd daily great Succours
out of <HI>Saxony:</HI> I say, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> finding
this, resolv'd upon the only effectual way he had
left to reduce the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> and this was
to enter the Electorate of <HI>Saxony</HI> with his whole
Army: The King of <HI>Poland</HI> had been aware of
this some time, and had both written to the
States of <HI>Saxony</HI> to put themselves into a posture
of Defence, and had gone thither himself to see
it effectually done, but the <HI>Swedish</HI> General <HI>Rhens∣child</HI>
having routed the <HI>Saxon</HI> Army at <HI>Fruaenstat,</HI>
and the Country, by that means being quite
naked of Defence, the <HI>Swedes</HI> enter'd at once,
without resistance.</P>
<P>THIS immediately brought the King of <HI>Po∣land</HI>
to Terms; his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty like a true Fa∣ther
of his Country, could not stop his Ears to the
Cries of his People, as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had
done to those of his miserable Subjects in <HI>Livo∣nia,
Ingria</HI> and <HI>Finland;</HI> if I may suppose he
heard those Cries, for some People suggested that
Court <HI>Piper,</HI> General <HI>Steenboch,</HI> and those Men
who managed Affairs for the Prince, conceal'd
from him the Miseries of his People: If it be
true, that they did so, no doubt but the Ruin of
his Country, and the Blood of its Inhabitants lye
at their Door, seeing by a just and honourable
Peace it might have been all prevented.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170"/>
BUT to return to the History of Fact, the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> having enter'd the <HI>Electorate</HI> of <HI>Saxony</HI>
contrary to the Representations made by the Mi∣nisters,
of the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the States Ge∣neral
of the united Provinces, and several other
Potentates, who all press'd him not to make such
a Breach upon the Peace of the Empire, and
would no doubt in time have join'd to have dri∣ven
him out again, the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was at the
Entreaty of his States of <HI>Saxony,</HI> brought to
name Plenipotentiaries for a Treaty, and this
Treaty was actually carrying on; but while these
Agents were hammering at a Peace, the Armies
in <HI>Poland</HI> having made no Cessation of Arms, act∣ed
on every Side as usual, and the <HI>Swedes,</HI> that
the King of <HI>Poland</HI> might not have an opportuni∣ty
to follow them into <HI>Saxony,</HI> had post'd Major,
General <HI>Mardevelt</HI> with an Army of about 25000
Men, <HI>Lithuanians, Poles</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> at <HI>Kalish,</HI> in
the Lesser <HI>Poland,</HI> as it were directly in the way
to <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>HIS <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty resolving to rescue his own
Dominions whatever it cost him, found it abso∣lutely
necessary to fight this Army in the first
Place, and having now the Support of a power∣ful
Army from his faithful Alie the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> he resolv'd upon the attempt, and there∣upon,
call'd a great Council of War, at which
were present the <HI>Russian</HI> General Prince <HI>Menzic∣koff,</HI>
and several of the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility that were
in his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty's Interest, who all agreed to
what the King of <HI>Poland</HI> had resolv'd (<HI>viz.</HI>) to
Fight; what followed upon this, will be best un∣derstood
by the following Account, written up∣on
the Spot where the Action was perform'd.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171"/>
“IT having been resolved in a Council of War,
held by his Majesty at <HI>Peterkan,</HI> that the Army
Should continue their March in quest of the
Enemy; the two Mareschals of the Crown,
and General <HI>Brod</HI> were detach'd the 22d In∣stant,
with 8000 Men; and the 23d his Maje∣sty
and Prince <HI>Alexander Menzickoff</HI> followed
with the main Body. The 26th, the two Bodies
join'd near <HI>Szat,</HI> two Leagues from <HI>Kalish,</HI>
with a Resolution to expect us; thereupon his
Majesty went to take a narrow View of them,
and caused immediately the <HI>Calmuck Tartars,</HI>
and <HI>Cossacks,</HI> to advance under the Cannon of
<HI>Kalish,</HI> to that several Skirmishes happen'd be∣tween
them and the Enemy. The 28th, the
whole Army advanced within a small League
of that of the Enemy commanded by General
<HI>Mardevelt;</HI> but having several Defiles, and a
Bridge to pass before he could get at them,
his Majesty employ'd the remaining part of
that Day, in making the necessary Dispositions
for attacking them the next, with the utmost Vi∣gour.
The 29th, his Majesty march'd directly
towards the Enemy in Order of Battle, and
finding their Army drawn up likewise, behind
an Eminence, about Three in the Afternoon
gave the Signal for the Attack, by three Can∣non
Shot; the Enemy answer'd by two Shots,
and came down into the Plain with their whole
Army, having intermix'd their Squadrons with
their Batallions; their Right Wing being com∣pos'd
of Polish Troops, was commanded by the
Sieur <HI>Potocki,</HI> Palatine of <HI>Kiow;</HI> their Left con∣sisting
of <HI>Lethuanians,</HI> had Prince <HI>Sapieha</HI> at
their Head; their Center was commanded by
the Swedish General <HI>Mardevelt;</HI> and the
<PB N="171" REF="172"/>
whole Army was cover'd with two deep Mo∣rasses,
the Town of <HI>Kalish,</HI> and a good Baracade
of Waggons; insomuch, that the Design of at∣tacking
them, seem'd to be attended with al∣most
insuperable Difficulties; notwithstanding
which, King <HI>Augustus</HI> persisted in his Resolution.
In order to put the same in execution, his Ma∣jesty
form'd the Center, and the two Wings of
his Army, and divided his <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Troops; besides which, there were two Bodies
of Reserve of the <HI>Polish</HI> Forces, commanded by
the two Generals of the Crown; his Majesty
took the Command of the Left Wing upon him∣self;
gave that of the Right to Prince <HI>Alexander
Menzickoff;</HI> and the Center to General <HI>Brand,</HI> or
<HI>Brod.</HI> The Ingagement began between three and
four a Clock, and his Majesty's Troops fought
with so much Vigour, that the Enemy's Right
Wing was soon overthrown, and driven within
the Baracade of Waggons they had near the Town
of <HI>Kalish,</HI> but the rest of their Army defended
themselves with great obstinacy till fix at
Night; his Majesty, during the whole Action,
expos'd himself where the Fire was greatest, and
charg'd the Enemy several Times in Perso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
with his Horse Guards, and several other Squa∣drons;
but his Majesty having no Foot, his
Horse suffer'd much by the continual Fire of
the Enemy's Infantry, and particularly of the
<HI>French</HI> Troops, and others, who, in the Action
at <HI>Frawenstadt,</HI> flung down their Arms, and
went over to the <HI>Swedes.</HI> Nevertheless, the
Enermy was push'd with the utmost Vigour, and,
by the Blessing of God, we obtain'd a compleat
and signal Victory over them. Their Forces,
before the Battle, consisted of 10000 <HI>Swedes,</HI> and
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
15000 <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Lithuanians;</HI> and ours of 7000
<HI>Poles,</HI> 5000 <HI>Saxons,</HI> 9000 <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and some
Thousands of <HI>Tarters,</HI> or <HI>Calmuck Cossacks;</HI> so
that the two Armies were, almost of equal
Strength; most of the <HI>Sweeds</HI> were kill'd in
the Field of Battle; twenty <HI>Polish</HI> Companies
of their Party, came over to us during the
Action; and the next Morning, some Thousand
<HI>Poles,</HI> who were retired within the Barricades of
Waggons, were likewise oblig'd to yield them∣selves
Prisoners of War; among the latter,
were the Sieur <HI>Patocki,</HI> Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI> his
Lady and all her Children; Sieur <HI>Tarlo,</HI> Master
Cook of the Crown; and several other Persons of
Note; who were all disarm'd, and their Horses
taken, as were also 10000 Waggons that made
up their Barricade: The <HI>Sweeds</HI> had left their
Baggage at <HI>Kalish,</HI> under a Guard of 300 Men,
and after the Action, 500 Horse escaped thither,
but they were all afterwards obliged to sur∣render
at Discretion. However, his Majesty
was so generous, as to restore the Baggage to
the Officers. All the Enemy's Artillery and
Ammunition was taken. The <HI>Saxon</HI> Cavalry
took 19 Standards and Colours from the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
44 from the <HI>Poles,</HI> and 4 Pair of Kettle Drums;
the rest were taken by the <HI>Poles</HI> in our Army,
and the <HI>Muscovites.</HI> This Victory is so com∣pleat,
that 'tis believ'd, not above 2000 of the
Enemy escap'd. All the Troops, as well <HI>Poles,</HI>
and <HI>Saxons,</HI> as <HI>Muscovites,</HI> behaved themselves
in this Action, with great Courage and Intripi∣dity;
and all their respective Generals signa∣liz'd
themselves in Emulation of each other.
Our Loss is very inconsiderable, for we had
only one Officer of Note kill'd, <HI>viz.</HI> Colonel
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>
<HI>Guersdorf;</HI> this Victory is the more remarka∣ble,
because his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty's Troops had
undergone great Fatiegues, by their continual
Marches and Countermarches, during the
Campaign; whereas the Enemy's had been a
long time in Quarters of Refreshment.”</P>
<P>“HERE follows a List of the Prisoners taken
from the <HI>Swedes,</HI> both in the Field of Battle,
and in the Town of <HI>Kalish,</HI> besides the <HI>Poles</HI>
that were taken the next Day, in the foremen∣tion'd
Brigade of Waggons, <HI>viz.</HI> General <HI>Mar∣dervelt,</HI>
who commanded in Chief; 4 Colo∣nels,
<HI>viz. Marschal, Muller, Horn</HI> of the Foot,
<HI>Horn</HI> of the Horse, 5 Lieutenant Colonels, <HI>viz.
Guildenstern, Raad, Horn, Issendorff,</HI> and <HI>Mu∣mand;</HI>
4 Majors, to wit, <HI>Bornfold, Openbasch,
Schelling,</HI> and <HI>Rurst;</HI> 27 Captains of Foot, and
4 of Horse, 39 Lieutenants, 21 Ensigns, 4
Adjutants, 294 Subaltern Officers, 1600 Sol∣diers,
making in all 2007 Prisoners taken in
the Battle, those taken in the Town of <HI>Kalish,</HI>
are, 1 Major, 1 Captain of Horse, 16 Captains of
Foot, 19 Lieutenants, 15 Cornets, 6 Ensigns,
4 Ministers, 18 Subaltern Officers, and 800
Soldiers, in all 894 Prisoners; which with
those taken in the Battle, amount to 2901.
We had 806 <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> kill'd, and 800
wounded.”</P>
<P>THE great Share his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
Troops had in this Victory, was acknowledg'd by
King <HI>Augustus</HI> himself, till he found it necessary
for Reasons of State to Cancel all the Obligations
which he ow'd to his Supporters, and Consequent∣ly
to lessen the Merit of the Support, which they
had given him; but as he own'd to have in his
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
Army 9000 <HI>Muscovite</HI> Soldiers, I mean Regular
Troops under Prince <HI>Menzickoff;</HI> so 'tis known▪
he had olso as many <HI>Cossacks</HI> and <HI>Circassians</HI> of his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Subjects, who in their way did
him very good Service on that occasion.</P>
<P>BUT now we come to the Transactions of King
<HI>Augustus</HI>'s Life, which are the meanest part of his
History, Namely, that of abandoning the Crown
of <HI>Poland,</HI> quitting his Alliance with the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mus¦covy,</HI>
who had never forsaken him in his greatest
Distress, and yielding to the lowest Steps, which
his insulting Enemies could put upon him.</P>
<P>IT must be confest that the Plenipotentiaries
on either Side, had sign'd the Treaty at <HI>Alt Ran∣stadt,</HI>
nay, the Peace was concluded and sign'd
four Days before the Battle of <HI>Kalish</HI> was fought;
otherwise, perhaps King <HI>Augustus</HI> would have
ventur'd with his victorious Army to have march'd
directly against the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who tho' they were
indeed in possession of the open Country of the
<HI>Electorate,</HI> yet had no fortify'd Place in their Hands,
nor above 15 or 16000 Men in their Army, where∣as
the King of <HI>Poland</HI> could in less than 12 Days
have had 60000 Men in his Army, besides what
Troops he had in <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it was too late, and King <HI>Augustus</HI> made
it a point of Honour to stand to the Agreement
his Plenipotentiaries had made, however dishon∣ourable
it might be; so he laid down his Arms at
once, and gave up the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> and all
his Friend, and Interest there to the Mercy of a Mer∣cenary,
who the <HI>Poles</HI> dispis'd most heartily, tho'
many of them were oblig'd to call him King, and
this was the Condition of things when his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty return'd to his Army in <HI>Lithuania.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176"/>
BUT this no way discourag'd the <HI>Czar,</HI> he re∣solv'd
to Support the Party that had stood for the
Liberty of their Country against the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and
to this purpose he publish'd a Declaration, or
Memorial to the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility, and having re∣ceiv'd
a formal Notification of the Treaty con∣cluded
by King <HI>Augustus</HI> with the King of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
he wrote Letters to the General of the
Crown, the Primate of the Kingdom, and other
Grandees, who were in the Party of King <HI>Au∣gustus,</HI>
to represent to them, That he concluded an
“Alliance with the Republick, and not in parti∣cular
with <HI>Augustus,</HI> and that he was resolved
to perform all the Articles thereof, of assist
the Republick with all his Forces against the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> who being not satisfy'd with having oblig'd
King <HI>Augustus</HI> to adicate his Crown, would im∣pose
a King of their own Election upon them.
His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty promises therein to repair
shortly to <HI>Lemberg</HI> to concert Measures with
the Republick, and in the mean time to send such
an Army as will be sufficient to enable the <HI>Poles</HI>
to vindicate their indpendency; the Primate
having held a great Council with the Officers of
the Crown, has appointed a great Council to
meet at <HI>Lembergh</HI> the 17th of the next Month,
and has declared the Throne vacant, bidding
all the <HI>Poles</HI> to acknowledge the <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Po∣zen,</HI>
under the Name of <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> the Primate
also has written to the Emperor, the Queen of
<HI>England,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Prussia,</HI> the
States General, the Pope and other Potentates,
to acquaint them with the vacancy of the Throne.
The General of the Crown, has also published
universalia, forbidding the Forces of the Re∣publick
to receive any Orders from King <HI>Au∣gustus,</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
or King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> and promising a re∣ward
of 5000 Rixdollars to such who shall de∣liver
up alive the Sieur <HI>Smigielski,</HI> or 2000 to
such who shall deliver him dead; that Gentle∣man
has lately embrac'd the Party of King
<HI>Stanislaus,</HI> and set at Liberty the Weywood of
<HI>Kalish,</HI> which has so provoked Prince <HI>Menzic∣koff,</HI>
that he has caus'd him to be hang'd in Ef∣figie.”</P>
<P>IN pursuit of these Resolutions, his Majesty
came in Person to <HI>Zolkiew</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> the 11th of
<HI>January,</HI> 1707. And being inform'd by his Mi∣nisters
“of what had pass'd during his Absence;
he order'd them to write to all the Generals of
the Army, and of the Crown, and to the Sena∣tors
to invite them to repair to him, he also or∣der'd
universaly in his own Name to be print∣ed
for confirming those already publish'd by
his Ministers; the 9th he went to Church attended
by Prince <HI>Menzickoff,</HI> and other Officers and
Generals, and afterwards Din'd in Publick;
the 10th and 11th were spent in Conferences a∣bout
the disposing of the Army, and in sending
private Dispatches to divers foreign Courts.”</P>
<P>PURSUANT to this Summons of the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> the 7th of <HI>February</HI> the great Assembly
of Senators, Generals and great Officers, that
is to say, the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility met together at
<HI>Lemberg,</HI> there to consult with his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty
what was to be done in the present Con∣juncture:
This Grand Council, for such they were
call'd, open'd their first Session, by going in
formal Procession to Church to implore the Bles∣sing
of Heaven on their Proceedings, then they
repair'd to the Hall of Council, where several
Pathetic Speeches were made to explain to one
<PB N="177" REF="178"/>
Author the Reason of their Assembly, and re∣present
the present State of their Country, all
of them concurring to declare the Throne vacant.</P>
<P>“AFTER these things they renew'd the Confe∣deracy
of <HI>Sendomir,</HI> as the most effectual Means,
to put themselves in a Condition to assert their
Liberties; they seem'd very unanimous in their
Resolutions; but had not yet taken any Mea∣sures
for a new Election. And King <HI>Augustus</HI>
having not notify'd unto them his Renuncia∣tion
of the Crown; the Assembly seem'd to act
rather, as if their King was Prisoner amongst
his Enemies, or absent, than if the Throne
were Vacant. Prince <HI>Dolhorucki,</HI> Chief Mini∣ster
of State to the <HI>Czar,</HI> had then his first
publick Audience of the Council, to which
he was conducted by one of the Chief Officers
of the Crown, with 7 Coaches, and a Detach∣ment
of the Cavalry of the General of the
Crown; he was placed in the Congress, be∣tween
the two chief Ministers of the Repub∣lick;
and delivered a Letter to the Assembly
from the <HI>Czar,</HI> and then made a Speech in the
<HI>Polish</HI> Language, importing, That notwith∣standing
the Republick seem'd reduced to the
last Extremities, by the Retreat of King <HI>Au∣gustus,</HI>
yet, they were still in a Condition, to
retrieve their Affairs and Glory, if they would
concur in the Measures that should be proposed
unto them on the Part of the <HI>Czar,</HI> a faithful
Ally of <HI>Poland;</HI> whom no private Advantage
whatsoever, that may be proposed unto him,
shall be able to separate from the Interest of
the Republick; Concluding with a pathetical
Exhortation, to take vigorous Measures against
their Common Enemy; and assuring them that
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
the <HI>Czar</HI> would restore to the Republick, the
Places in the <HI>Ukraine,</HI> that formerly belonged
to <HI>Poland,</HI> and furnish the Sums he had <HI>belonged
fed</HI> for paying of the Army of the Crown.”
The Primate of the Kingdom Answered, in the
Name of the Republick; “And having return'd
Thanks to the <HI>Czar</HI> for his Affection and Friend∣ship,
he assured his Minister that the Council
would not separate 'till they had taken such Re∣solutions,
as the Glory of their Nation, and
the distressed Conditon of their Country re∣quired
from them. Then Prince <HI>Dolhorucki</HI> was
conducted back to his House with the same Cere∣mony:
The 19th his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty with his el∣dest
Son Prince <HI>Alexander,</HI> Prince <HI>Menzickoff,</HI> and
some other Persons of Note arrived there from
<HI>Zolkiew;</HI> he was Complimented upon his arrival
by the Primate, and other Grandees, and nob∣ly
entertain'd by the General of the Crown;
the 20th that Prince assisted at the Ceremony
of the Consecration of the Bishop of <HI>Cujavia</HI>
perform'd in the Cathedral, and presented that
Prelate with a Crucifix, valued, at 15000 Rix-dollars;
the 21st, there was a long Conference
between the Ministers of that Prince, and the
Council of <HI>Poland;</HI> but the Resolutions taken
therein were kept very private: His Majesty
with the Prince and Ministers, set out the next
day to return to <HI>Zolkiew,</HI> and Prince <HI>Dolhoureki,</HI>
continued there as his Plenipotentiary, the
Count <HI>de Denhoff,</HI> Governour of <HI>Crawcow</HI> or∣dered
the Fortification of that place to be aug∣mented
with all possible speed, and has in con∣cert
with the <HI>Czar,</HI> order'd the Neighbouring
Districts to furnish without delay a quantity of
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
Forage, and Corn it being resolved to make a
great Magazine in that City.”</P>
<P>The following Letter was also written by the
<HI>Czar</HI> to the great General, and dated from <HI>Zolkiew</HI>
the 7th of <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> having by Force and
Management, compass'd his Design against King
<HI>Augustus,</HI> seeks with no lefs Cunning to gain his
Ends of us and the Republick, and to render Fruitless
our good Dispositions to maintain the common Interest.
In this View, his Ministers in all foreign Courts insi∣nuate,
that he is treating of a Peace separately with
us. We do not deny, that (when) formerly, at <HI>Seoli∣za,</HI>
several Ministers of foreign Potentates, sounded
our Inclination to Peace; we intimated, that out of
Christian Duty, and to spare the Effusion of Blood,
we should always be ready to hearken to all Propostions
of Peace which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> should offer,
but on Condition, that such Peace should be negotiated
openly, and with the Consent and Participation of
the Republick, and concluded by Commissioners
appointed by all the Nations concern'd. We never did,
or shall entertain any Thoughts of treating of Peace
secretly, by the Intervention of any foreign Courts;
prefering to all Interest and Advantage, the Reputa∣tion,
Honour, and Inviolable good Faith of a Mo∣narch,
in the strict Observation of all his Alliances.
We therefore, assure your Lordship, that we have not
yet enter'd into any Manner of Negotiation of Peace
with <HI>Sweden,</HI> nor, for the future, will enter into any,
otherwise than we have already declared, with the
Participation and Consent of the Estates of the Re∣publick;
being absolutely determin'd to keep inviolably
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
the Alliance and Guarantee we are ingaged in with
the Republick.</P>
<P>IN Pursuit of the <HI>Czar's</HI> Resolutions to assist
the <HI>Poles,</HI> we find that his Majesty's Troops were
very numerous in <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>THE Body of <HI>Muscovits</HI> in <HI>Prussia</HI> consisted of
18000 Men, and were augmented considerably;
the City of <HI>Dantzick</HI> were not a little alarm'd at
it, especially since they receiv'd a threatning Let∣ter
from the <HI>Czar</HI> on Account of their acknow∣ledging
<HI>Stanislaus.</HI> The Body of <HI>Muscovites</HI> about
<HI>Thorn</HI> were so strong, that they oblig'd Prince
<HI>Lubomirsky</HI> to retire with his Troops into great
<HI>Poland.</HI> The <HI>Muscovites</HI> also form'd another Bo∣dy
near <HI>Calish,</HI> making near 30000 Men; and a
Fourth about <HI>Guesna.</HI> During these things the
<HI>Czar</HI> seeing the <HI>Poles</HI> unsteady in their Resolutions,
and disputing Trifles with their best Friends, went
himself in Person to the great Council of Senators,
which were adjourn'd from <HI>Lemberg,</HI> and met at
<HI>Lublin;</HI> where is <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty arrived the 20th
of <HI>May,</HI> 1707, with a Guard of 3000 Dragoons.
The Senators had all agreed as above, that up∣on
the King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s having abdicated the
Crown, they were in a State of <HI>Interregnum,</HI> and
that the Throne was vacant; but could never be
brought to fill up the Vacancy, and elect a new
King, which his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty justly thought
was the only way to engage them heartily, so
that they might be depended on.</P>
<P>BUT they put it always off, alledging that
King <HI>Augustus</HI> had not signified his Resolution of
abandoning the Crown to them in Particular, and
therefore they ought to send a Deputation to
<PB N="181" REF="182"/>
him, to have his last Answer from his own
Mouth.</P>
<P>THIS the <HI>Czar</HI> took for gross Triffling with
him, and such indeed it was; for they had their
Articles of Peace between the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> and
the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> publish'd by the said two
King's respectively, and the Letter which the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> oblig'd the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to
write to King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> owning him for King of
<HI>Poland,</HI> all these were before them, and yet they
made Excuses to put off a new Election of a
King.</P>
<P>THEY were indeed, all of them willing to have
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty to advance with his Army,
and proposed to concert Measures to act against
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> with joint Forces, and Endea∣vour
to bring the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to a decisive
Battle; which his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was willing
enough to do, as soon as a new King should be
nam'd, but did not think any other Step less
than that, could sufficiently assure him of
the Fidelity and Steadiness of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who in
Case of a Battle, he knew well enough might
have an Opportunity to make their Peace at his
Majesty's Expence; and indeed, those Uncer∣tainties
produced such a general Distaste, and
gave such a plain Ground of Mistrust, that they,
the <HI>Poles,</HI> only sought a Delay, and to see what
Measures the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> would take, or whe∣ther
he resolved to bring his Army again into
<HI>Poland,</HI> or not, that they might have Time to
take up with the Strongest; that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty,
from this Time, begun to see plainly, he
had nothing but his own Power to depend upon;
and that the <HI>Poles</HI> were not to be trusted; and
this brought in the End, all the Consultations,
<PB N="182" REF="183"/>
Confederacies and Pretences of Defending the
Liberties of <HI>Poland</HI> to nothing, and ended as such
generally do, in their falling all into the Hands
of their Enemies; and being oblig'd to submit to
King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> as we shall presently shew.</P>
<P>BUT his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty who knew them too
well, to be drawn into any Snare by them;
acted an open, plain, and fair Part with them;
and let them know, that since they would not do
their Duty, and were not mov'd either by their
present or future Interest, he would take Care
to depend upon himself only, and take such
Measures as he should think fit. But whereas
their famous Champion <HI>Smegielski,</HI> who had done
so many gallant Exploits against the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the
Cause of King <HI>Augustus,</HI> had now made his Peace,
and was gone over to <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> and had commit∣ted
some Hostilities against the <HI>Russians:</HI> The <HI>Rus∣sian</HI>
General caus'd him to be hang'd in Effigie,
as a Traytor to his Country, and put a Reward
upon his Head, to any who should bring him in alive or dead.</P>
<P>AT the same Time, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty seeing
himself thus used, by King <HI>Augustus,</HI> even just
after his Troops had obtain'd a great Victory for
him, the said King <HI>Augustus;</HI> and that notwith∣standing
all this, he had not only abandon'd his
Confederacy or Alliances with his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty,
but had joyn'd his Enemy the King of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
and obliged himself to act Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rary to the
Interest he had espoused; and also that King <HI>Au∣gustus</HI>
had sent Letters and Memorials to <HI>England,</HI>
to <HI>Holland,</HI> and other Places, to excuse and palli∣ate
the Treachery of his Friendship. I say, see∣ing
himself thus used by King <HI>Augustus;</HI> his <HI>Czar∣ish</HI>
Majesty thought it needful to write to the
<PB N="183" REF="184"/>
same Powers to expose the Ingratitude of King
<HI>Augustus,</HI> and to let them see, what in the Course
of the late War, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had done for
him; the Copy of this Letter to the Queen
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> being as follows, that to the
States General, being <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> much the
same.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Most honoured and beloved SISTER.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH 'tis not unknown to your Royal
Majesty yet we have judged it necessary as Af∣fairs
now stand in a Friendly and Brotherly manner,
to acquaint you by this Letter, and as briefly as possi∣ble
with the Services we have done King <HI>Augustus,</HI>
from his first Election to the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI>
having by our powerful Endeavours for the common
Benefit of that Crown, hindered the Prince of <HI>Con∣ti,</HI>
who had been chosen before by part of the Repub∣lick
from taking posession of it, and even sent a nu∣merous
Army against the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Party, for
the use and Service of those Senators, that sided with
King <HI>Augustus,</HI> before any League had been conclud∣ded
with him, or his Enterance into <HI>Poland;</HI> the
Army was immediately upon his arrival put under his
command, that he might be able to punish his Enemies,
besides which we threatned the contrary Party with
Fire and Sword; upon Apprehension hereof, many
were forced to acknowledge him, and so by our Assi∣stance
he was firmly Settled upon the Throne; after∣wards
by his particular Intreaties, and a Message by
General <HI>Carlowitz</HI> in the Year 1700, we concluded
with him an Alliance against the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
in which there was no Subsidies of Money promised
him, moreover many Affronts and Injuries having
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
been done us at the beginning of the War by the Crown
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> we were prevail'd with by the earnest
Sollicitations of his Minister General <HI>Langa</HI> in an
unproper Season, it being the latter End of Autumn
for his Relief, and to make the Enemy turn their
Arms against us, to begin to attack <HI>Narva,</HI> and then
his Forces, contrary to his Promise, leaving ours in
Action, went into Quarters in <HI>Poland,</HI> and <HI>Cour∣land,</HI>
on which occasion our Forces suffer'd no small
Loss, notwithstanding which, a League being renewed
with him at <HI>Birsa,</HI> in 1701, not a small Sum of Mo∣ney
was Lent him, besides which, we assisted him with
20000 Foot, nevertheless this signified nothing, nor
were our Arms made use of according to the Treaty,
but by the Intrigues of the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador <HI>du
Heiron,</HI> to whom contrary to our Agreement and
Personal Protestations confirm'd by us, full power
was at that time given to Treat about a separate
Peace, those our Forces without necessity were greatly
fatigued and the Enemy permitted to pass the <HI>Dwina,</HI>
dismiss'd without being supplied with Provisions, du∣ring
their March, for which the said King received
Money from us, which caused great Numbers of
them to perish, and others to Desert: Notwith∣standing
all this, upon his repeated Assurance, and
Messages, we renewed a League with him in the Year
1703, and promised 300000 Rubles for the use of
his Forces, and 12000 Foot to be maintain'd at our
own Charges, which we faithfully perform'd; and al∣though
the Subsides, and Auxilliaries were not then
specified in that Treaty, nor whether the same should
be given Yearly, yet we sent him every Year no less
then the abovementioned Sum, not reckoning other im∣mense
Charges, we were at, for the preserving the
Republick in his Interest; but instead of imploying the
Forces against the Enemy, he made them March to
<PB N="185" REF="186"/>
and fro in <HI>Poland,</HI> whereby they were very much fa∣tigued;
and afterwards parting from them without
any occasion, be permitted them to be driven into <HI>Sax∣ony,</HI>
together with the <HI>Saxons,</HI> whereby without any
necessity half of them were unaccountably lost, and
the rest were forced to die with Hunger; and altho'
free Winter Quarters were promis'd them in the
Treaty, yet on the contrary, 'twas forbidden to sup∣ply
them with Bread in their Quarters: Upon which
our Minister extraordinary, <HI>Van Patkul,</HI> then re∣siding
at his Court, and chief General of those Forces,
in order to preserve them from utter and certain
Ruin, agreed with the Emperor's Ministers to put
them into his imperial Majesty's Service, for which
by the Suggestions of the said King's wicked and trea∣cherous
<HI>Saxon</HI> Ministers, he was put under Arrest
contrary to the Law of Nations, and without our
consent, was cast like a Traytor into a loathsome Pri∣son,
altho' we were oblig'd for the Interest of the
said King <HI>Augustus,</HI> as well as before the Affront of∣fered
to our Minister, as after the going of the said
King out of <HI>Poland,</HI> in order to preserve him upon
his Throne, and defend the Republick of <HI>Poland</HI> a∣gainst
the <HI>Swedish</HI> Forces, to leave all our Armies
to Act for his Interest; and at the desire of the Re∣publick
by their extraordinary Embassy to March
with all our Forces into <HI>Poland,</HI> where they were ob∣lig'd
to be maintain'd to this Day to our great Charge
in own Pay; yet notwithstanding all this, his Generals
at his going out of <HI>Saxony,</HI> with our and their Troops,
suffered themselves, not without suspicion of Treache∣ry,
to be beaten without any Resistance; and our
Forces were so Deserted, that only 1600 of them re∣mained,
and these with much a-do saved themselves,
and return'd into <HI>Saxony,</HI> although King <HI>Augustus</HI>
upon our repeated Instances and Sollicitations, pro∣mis'd
<PB N="186" REF="187"/>
both before and after his infamous Peace, by
his Messages and Protestations made to us by General
<HI>Goltz,</HI> either to deliver up to us, or secretly to set
at Liberty our said Minister, General <HI>Van Patkul;</HI>
yet nothing was performed, notwithstanding which,
without regarding the intolerable Falshoods of the said
King <HI>Augustus,</HI> his Non-performances of the Treaty
made with us, his imprisoning our Minister, and vio∣lating
the Laws of the Nations, and tending to se∣parate
Peace, as well by the Sieur <HI>Octima,</HI> as by
Count <HI>Koningmark,</HI> and afterwards in Writing by
their Secretary <HI>Nemitz</HI> and <HI>Figgstone</HI> from the
beginning of the War, and after their enterance into
<HI>Saxony,</HI> of which Transactions we had Notice given
us by several of our faithful Friends, and notwith∣standing
we had those Treaties in our Hands, yet we
did not leave to assist him, both with our Forces and
Money; and in the last Compaign, though the Seasou
of the Year was so far advanced, it being the latter
End of Autum, yet being desir'd to draw the Ene∣my
back, and harrass his Army, we sent our Caval∣ry
under the command of our General Prince <HI>Men∣zikoff</HI>
to join him, and his <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Polish</HI> Forces,
who Marching towards <HI>Calish,</HI> met with the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI>
General <HI>Mardefelt,</HI> and the <HI>Poles</HI> of the con∣trary
Party under the command of the <HI>Waywode</HI> of
<HI>Kiow,</HI> and by the Assistance of the most High, entirely
defeated them, and took their chief General and ma∣ny
other inferior Officers, and Soldiers, Prisoners of
war, whereby all great <HI>Poland</HI> was brought under his
Obedience; after this, being fully supplyed with all
Necessaries, we des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn'd, by the Help of the most High,
to act still in his Defence, which was begun with the
Action at <HI>Wyburg</HI> in <HI>Finland,</HI> and did expect many
good Consequences from that Defeat, and rely'd on
a strict Observance of the Treaty, pursuant to the <HI>Assur</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="188"/>
ances we had receiv'd from him in two Letters,
written since the Battle, the first dated the 31st. of
<HI>October,</HI> and the second the 20th of <HI>November;</HI>
but saw at first, that he begun to take away from our
said General, Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> the General Officers,
and other Prisoners we had taken, giving his Royal
Word, and many Assurances, that he either would
exchange them for our Generals and other Officers,
detain'd in <HI>Sweden;</HI> for the Performance whereof,
General <HI>Mardefelt,</HI> with the Rest of the Officers,
gave also their Parole, and confirm'd the same to our
General; or, if it were not possible to effect this Ex∣change,
that he would restore the said Prisoners into
our Hands; but contrary to all his Promises, he let
them go without any Exchange. After this, we under∣stood
to our great Astonishment, that he had already
concluded a dishonourable Peace with the King of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
and <HI>Lescheinsky;</HI> yielded up all his Rights to
the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> and surrendering all to the
Pleasures of his Enemies, without giving us any previ∣ous
Notice, that we might have provided for our own
Security, in Return of the innumerable Favours done
him by us; but what shows his Ingratitude to the
highest Degree, is, that the Peace was confirm' by him
many Days before the Battle. After which, by his
Letters, he gave his earnest Assurances of his firm
Adherence to the Treaty; the Inconstancy of his Pro∣mises,
Non-performance of the League, and Forgetful∣ness
of our many Favours and Assistance, we leave
to the righteous Judgement and Vengeance of Almigh∣ty
God, and upon whose powerful Assistance in our just
Cause, we firmly rely; protesting against the said
King <HI>Augustus</HI> and his Subjects; and Leave also to
all the World to Judge impartially of our faithful
Performance of the League to the very last. More∣over,
we are extreamly surpriz'd, at three Articles in
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>
the aforesaid League, viz. the 11th, 12th, and
20th, in the first of which, be, the said, late
King Augustus, promised to deliver up our publick
Minister and Plenipotentiary residing at his Court,
into the Hands of our Enemies, in an unheard of
Manner, and to his utter Ruin, upon Pretence of his
being a <HI>Swedish</HI> Deserter. Secondly, in the 12th
Article be maliciously obliges himself to deliver up to
the Enemy, as Prisoners of War, the Remains of 12
Regiments, <HI>viz.</HI> 1600 Auxiliary Troops, who for his
Preservation have often expos'd their Lives; and were
there sent by him as Auxiliaries into the Empire;
which is not only contrary to divine and human Laws,
but even to the Customs and Laws of Barbarians:
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> In the 20th Article, he stipulates for him∣self,
in Case of Peace between us and the Enemy, full
Satisfaction. And afterwards, he the said <HI>Augustus,</HI>
in that Treaty, obliges himself, to procure your Roy∣al
Majesty Guarantee, therefore we in a brotherly and
friendly Manner, desire your Royal Majesty, that
through your innate and wonted Goodness, you would
be pleased not to consent thereunto, nor countenance
his dishonourable Actions. It would have been neces∣sary
we should, before this Time, have exhibited this
our Protestation, both to your Royal Majesty, and
other Potentates in writing, which we absolutely would
have performed by our Ministers, had we not been de∣luded▪
as we have made it appear, by the the fresh Assu∣rance
he sent us by Major General <HI>Goltz,</HI> who among
many other false Assurances of Friendship engaged for
the Performance of the League, and solemnly assured
us, that our Minister should never be deliver'd up,
and that in Case, it should come to the last Extreme∣ly,
King <HI>Augustus,</HI> should either set him privately
at Liberty, or detain him in <HI>Koningstein</HI> 'till the De∣parture
of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> and afterwards, deliver him
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
into our Hands. But we have since, with Wonder,
and bitter Grief understood, that that Prince fore∣going
his Honour, has deliver'd up our innocent pub∣lick
Minister, contrary to the Law of Nations, and
even Customs of <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and without the Fear of
God, into the Hands of his Enemies. For which
Reason, we have the rather thought fit to acquaint
your Majesty with all the Premises; and in a friendly
and brotherly Manner, to defire, that you would be
pleased, by your good Offices, to procure the Liberty
of our said Minister, <HI>Van Patkul,</HI> or at least, that
he may be used by the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as our Mini∣ster,
and not as his Subject, which we are confident,
his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty will grant, at your Royal Ma∣jesty's
Desire, whereby he will gain, with all the
World, the Name of a magnanimous Monarch, in∣stead
of giving an Example of so wicked and barbarous
an Action. But, if on the Contrary, <HI>Van Patkul</HI>
be hardly dealt with, and not used as our Minister,
we shall be forced to seek Opportunities to return the
like Usage. Trusting that in our just Cause, we shall
receive all Asistance from the Most High. We hope
likewise, by your Majesty's good Offices, and others,
our Subjects detain'd at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> and now under
Arrest, <HI>viz.</HI> the same Number and of the same
Rank, as those that were permitted to go upon their
Parole from our General, Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI>
namely, his General <HI>Mardefeldt,</HI> and other Officers,
and Soldiers, by Order of King <HI>Augustus;</HI> and on
the Parole of the rest of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Officers. The
said <HI>Augustus,</HI> having thus, Evidently before all the
World, violated his Vows, and the Laws of Nations,
by his unheard of dishonourable Proceedings, contra∣ry
to the Dictates of Conscience; as appears by those
Treaties, we shall be oblig'd to do our selves the
Justice, and seek for entire Satisfaction from him, as
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and a Member of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Empire, which our fair Proceedings and Stedfastness
to the League entitiled us too. The rather, because
by the 20th Article, contrary to his own Conscieoe,
be proposes to seek for full Satisfaction from us; the
remaining Part of our Auxiliary Troops now upon the
<HI>Rhine,</HI> we put under your Royal Majesty's Protection;
and desire that they may either enter your Majesty's
Service, or that of your Allies; or at least we en∣treat
your good Offices, that they may have Leave to
return Home with Safety; hoping that you will fa∣vour
us with your Concurrence and Assistance in these
our just Desires; We the Imperial Czarish Majesty.

<P>THIS Letter is too significant, and the Subsist∣tance
of it of too much Weight, to be pass'd over,
it being an Abridgement of the Conduct of his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, in Aid of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and of his treacherous Return, and also a kind
of Summary of the State of Things between
them at that Time.</P>
<P>THERE are two Cases mention'd in this Le∣tter,
which have not yet been spoken to; the one
is, That of the 1600 <HI>Russians,</HI> who had been put
into the Service of the Confederates in the Em∣pire,
and were acting upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as Part of
King <HI>Augustus</HI>'s Quota to the grand Alliance a∣gainst
<HI>France;</HI> and the other, is that of General
<HI>Patkull,</HI> who the <HI>Czar</HI> here declares to be his Mini∣ster
and Ambasstador to King <HI>Augustus;</HI> certain it
is, that King <HI>Augustus</HI> yielded both these Points to
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that is to say, as far as lay
in his Power; he gave up the <HI>Russian</HI> Troops up∣on
the <HI>Rhine</HI> to the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> but the
Emperor, who had more Humanity and Honour,
than to be a Party to so dishonourable an Action,
stood out so long, 'till the said Regiments had
Opportunity to retire from thence, and to dis∣band,
and by small Parties to pass through the
Imperial Countries into <HI>Poland,</HI> and so to their
own Country. But as for General <HI>Patkull,</HI> he de∣liver'd
him up to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who, deaf
to all Intercession, and not regarding him as a
Publick Minister, but as a Traytor, caused him
without Mercy, to be put to Death, by breaking
him a-live, and that with some extraordinary Marks
of Cruelty, such as particularly causing his own
Nephew, an Officer then in the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s
Service, to be the Person to see the Execution
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>
perform'd, to the Astonishment and Horror of all
that heard it.</P>
<P>BUT to return to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, he now
found that nothing was to be done with the <HI>Poles,</HI>
and that he must resolve to stand upon his own
Feet, against the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who having
encreased his Army, in <HI>Saxony</HI> to 50000 Men, by
raising Men almost over the whole Empire, was
in Motion towards <HI>Poland.</HI> I say, finding this, his
Majesty leaving 40000 Horse in <HI>Poland,</HI> to Coun∣tenance
the <HI>Poles</HI> if they would be steady, and
discharge themselves as was their Duty: Went
himself into <HI>Lithuania,</HI> to draw his Forces toge∣ther
there, in order to be in a Condition to Face
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or, withdraw the rest of his
Troops, as he should find Occasion.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> left <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Begin∣ing
of <HI>September,</HI> to the great Joy of the Poor
People there, who had been terribly impoverish'd
by their long Stay in the Country. They ad∣vanced
by long Marches through <HI>Silesia,</HI> and came
the 10th of October, to Casimir in <HI>Poland,</HI> where
the barbarous Execution of Count <HI>Patkull,</HI> above∣mention'd,
was perform'd, being the first Town
they halted at, on their entering <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty being, as I have said, gone
into <HI>Lithuania,</HI> had his head Quarters at <HI>Wilda;</HI>
before the withdrawing his Army, he ordered the
Lands of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alatines,</HI> in the Intercst of the U∣surper
<HI>Stanislaus</HI> to be laid Waste, which his Ene∣mies
represented as a mighty Injury; altho' he
therein only follow'd the Example of the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
who had so often done the like in an extraordina∣ry
manner, to the Lands and Estates of the No∣bility
who adheard to the Interest of their Coun∣try.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194"/>
THIS was the Case wherein the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>'s
Party pretended the <HI>Czar</HI> had rifled the Seats
of the Nobility in <HI>Poland,</HI> and carry'd away the
Pictures, Statues, Orange Trees, &amp;c. into <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
as also several Extraordinary Libraries with
many valuable Manufscripts, and other Curiosities,
or Rarities in Nature and of Art, part of which,
if it were so, was relative only to the Houses of
his Enemies, which by the Laws of War he had
Right to, they being now in Arms against him.</P>
<P>THE Diet or Assembly at <HI>Lublin,</HI> continued
some time longer, and seem'd to adhere to their
former Resolutions, and to support their Liber∣ties,
against King <HI>Stanislaus</HI> and the <HI>Swedes,</HI> but
as the <HI>Czar</HI> had no Confidence in them, so indeed,
he had no Reason, as the Event shew'd after∣wards;
for the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> advancing, they
all separated and disappear'd, leaving his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty to stand by himself, as it may be said,
in the War with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> which how
well he was able to do, and how Ill they de∣serv'd
it of him, will soon appear in the Conse∣quence
of the Story.</P>
<P>NOT that they ever fell in heartily with the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or with <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> which made
the Revolution which follow'd, the more easie to
the King of <HI>Poland.</HI> But the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
coming with so formidable a Power, back into
<HI>Poland,</HI> and bending the first of his March towards
<HI>Thorn,</HI> and the Towns on the lower <HI>Vistula;</HI> it
was no more Question'd for some Time, but that
his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty, Would in the first Place, clear
the Country of all King <HI>Sanislaus</HI>'s Enemies, and
use them with the uttmost Severity.</P>
<P>BUT the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> whose dark Hours
were just now begining, and who, as some have
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
observ'd, scarce ever took one right Step, after
his coming from <HI>Saxony,</HI> but delay'd his Proceed∣ings
either one Way or other, for near three
Months, hovering on that Side of <HI>Poland</HI> next the
Borders of <HI>Silesia,</HI> 'till he had brought the Empe∣ror
to Execute fully a Treaty which had been
made between them, in the behalf of the Pro∣testants
of <HI>Silesia.</HI></P>
<P>AND indeed, he was oblig'd to stay thus long
about <HI>Posen,</HI> and <HI>Calish,</HI> and those Parts, to lay
up Magazins, and Stores of Provisions for his
Army; for the <HI>Russians</HI> had ruined the Country
with a Designs to render it difficult to him to sub∣sist,
and it had the desired Effect; for after he be∣gun
to extend himself, there was no Forrage to be
found, sufficient to supply his Army on any con∣siderable
Occasion, and this made the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> lye still, till the Month of <HI>February</HI> at
least.</P>
<P>DURING all this Time, things hung in suspense
between the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Muscovy;</HI> several Powers, and Princes, sought to
mediate a Peace between his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty and
the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> Nor was the <HI>Czar</HI> averse to
a Peace, upon equitable and just Conditions; but
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> breathed nothing but War
and declar'd or the World was so unjust as to
publish it in his Name, that nothing should satis∣fy
him now, but dethroning the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
as he had dethron'd the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> So that
the <HI>Czar</HI> might be truly said to fight for his
Crown, as he had fought before for his Friend
the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and for the Peace of the
Republick.</P>
<P>IN Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>suance of this wicked Principle of Re∣venge,
he turn'd his Arms froom <HI>Poland,</HI> not yet
<PB N="195" REF="196"/>
subdued, and left his new pretended King,
to strugle with a half reduced Nobility, and a di∣vided
Nation, and profess'd to make War against
neither small nor great, but against his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty in Person.</P>
<P>THIS chymerical Piece of Personality in War,
drew is <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty, otherwise a most gallant
and experienc'd Prince, into so many wild and
desperate Undertakings, as have never been heard
of before; and into such Mistakes, to say no
worse of them, as never any General of an Army
run into, and which at last ended in his utter Ruin,
and overthrow, as will presently appear.</P>
<P>His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, dispising the Threatening
or <HI>Gasconade</HI> of Deposing him; but not at all Dis∣pising,
either the Person or Armies of the King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> had no more to do than to draw off his
Armies from <HI>Poland,</HI> keep his new Conquests well
guarded, and provided, and bring all his Forces
into such posts, as that he might soonest draw to∣gether
his Power, when he saw where the Cloud
would break; wait to see which Way this new In∣vader
would go about this great Work of entering
the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire, in order to bring to pass the
Revolution he had projected.</P>
<P>IT was with some Reason that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty
thought the first Step that the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
would take, would be to march into <HI>Livonia,</HI>
and there endeavour to recover what he had lost;
retrieve the ruin'd Condition of that flourishing
Country, and like a true Father thereof, restore
Peace to his People. But far from this, he found
that on a suddain, his Enemy turn'd his Face to
the <HI>South,</HI> or rather to the <HI>South East,</HI> and bent his
Marches really towards his Majesty's Dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="197"/>
THEN it was, that the <HI>Czar,</HI> who early pene∣trated
into the Design; foresaw, that some Trea∣chery
must be form'd among the <HI>Cossacks</HI> of the
<HI>Ukrain,</HI> and that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had held
some private Correspondences with the Traytor
<HI>Maz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppa,</HI> General of that false and fickle People:
And this was the more probable, because it was
the only View that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> could
have on that Side: The <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Cirassia,</HI> and all
that Side of the Country, were too remote for
any such Attempt, nor would it be possible for the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to penetrate into <HI>Muscovy</HI> any
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her Way, the Frontiers lying desolate for
so long a Way before he could come to the inha∣bited
fruitful Part of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> that it would be
impossible for an Army to subsist, to find For∣riage
for their Horses, and Food for their Men,
and that the carrying it with them for so long a
March, would be as Impracticable, as the other
would be Impossible.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Ukrain,</HI> a fruitful and populous Coun∣try
could it be brought into a Revolt, as the
<HI>Swedes</HI> had flatter'd themselves, or as some had
brought them to believe it would, might indeed,
have given him an Inlet into the Heart of the
Country, and have furnish'd them with Carriages
and H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reses for carrying their Provisions, if the
<HI>Czar</HI> should lay waste the Enterance into his
Dominions, as they might conclude would be
done.</P>
<P>WITH this View, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> began
the desperate undertaking, and marching thro'
the whole Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> past the <HI>Boristhe∣nes,</HI>
and advanc'd directly towards the <HI>Ukra∣nia</HI>
by long and Fateaguing Marches, having
42000 Men compleat in his Army, which a fine
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
Train of Artillery, and such an infinite Store
of Ammunition and other millitary Things, as
also of Provisions and Baggage as took up 11000
Waggons to carry after them, besides Mules and
Baggage Horses innumerable, and besides an Army
of 16000 Men, under the Command o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Genral
<HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> who his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty left to come af∣ter
him, with another Train of Artillery, and 7000
Waggons of Amunition and Warlike Stores more.</P>
<P>NOW his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty knew his Business;
the Field was mark'd out for him, and he knew
where to expect his Enemy. Now he saw where
this gathering Cloud would break, and where the
Storm would fall; and he had no more to do but
to follow and provide for his Defence.</P>
<P>HE did not however, abandon all Hopes from
the confederate States of <HI>Poland,</HI> or their Assem∣bly
at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> tho' he ceased to depend upon their
Assistance; but as he knew the Disposition of the
<HI>Poles</HI> perfectly well, he knew that tho' they
would not go on in the Path that he proposed,
that is to say, to bring Things to a Point, and
set up another King; which, after they had de∣clar'd,
and publish'd an <HI>Interregnum,</HI> one would
have thought they should not have stuck at; yet,
that they had gone too far, to go back again to
King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> and that at least they would create
him a great deal of Trouble, and employ a great
many of his Troops, to prevent him joyning with
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and this happen'd exactly as
the <HI>Czar</HI> foresaw it would.</P>
<P>UPON this Foot, I say, he did not break with
them, and leave them abruptly, and entirely to
themselves, which had been to have them all
torn in Pieces by the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or to have
forc'd them to go in at once to King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI>
and to joyn him against his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
Armies. But to prevent either of these Extreams,
the <HI>Czar,</HI> tho' he retir'd with the Gross of his
Army, to his own Frontiers; and as I have said,
prepar'd to defend himself, yet he left a Body of
Troops with them, to encourage, and assist them,
and manag'd them so well, that they could ne∣ver
be brought to joyn King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> or fall in∣to
his Measures, and Interest, to the last, no not
when the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had 60000 Men in the
Bowels of their Country.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> it has
been observ'd by some Writers, and such too, as
have made the best Judgement of those Things,
that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> never took one prospe∣rous
Step, nor did any Thing thrive that he un∣dertook,
after the cruel Execution of Count <HI>Pat∣kull,</HI>
nor after his unjust and personal War against
the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI>'s Crown: I mean his declar'd
Resolution, to depose and dethrone his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty; a Thing the World laugh'd at, and
which was in itself, considering the numerous
Armies the <HI>Czar</HI> had then on Foot, really ridicu∣lous.
But this is by the Way.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having layn still, in the
<HI>lesser Poland,</HI> as above, near 3 Months, and ha∣ving
consulted with his Generals, and resolv'd
what Course to steer, what Forces to take with
him, and what Armies the Generals should Com∣mand
in his Absence, set forward the 8th of <HI>March</HI>
on his resolv'd Expedition into <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>THE Troops he took with him, were about
forty two Thousand Men, all well disciplin'd cho∣sen
Men, and he left General <HI>Rhenschild</HI> Field
M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scha, and Governor of <HI>Livonia</HI> as above,
with 15000 Men more, and a second Train of
Artillery, with 6000 Waggons Loaden with
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
Amunition, and Military Stores, and Provisions,
to follow him.</P>
<P>THIS was indeed, a formidable Force, and
might have been more suitable to the Under∣taking,
had he been actually in the Field of
Action, that is to say, had he been in the inha∣bited
populous Part of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and had not a vast
unpeopled wasted Country to march through,
and which the <HI>Czar</HI> had on purpose strip'd of all
possibility of subsisting him, and that he must
carry every Mouthful of Provisions with him,
as well Forrage for his Horse, as Bread for his
Men.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, about <HI>March,</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
a Prince resolute and unalterable in his Underta∣kings,
when once his Councils were concluded,
began his March, as I have said, for <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and
passing the <HI>Vistula,</HI> first advanced to wards <HI>Lithua∣nia:</HI>
HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had left a Body of 3000
Horse, and 22000 Foot, to guard the Passages of
the <HI>Vistulla,</HI> against any Parties of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> but
with Orders to Retreat in Case the whole <HI>Swedish</HI>
Army should advance.</P>
<P>His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, was at this Time, gone
to <HI>Muscow,</HI> to settle the Minds of his People, and
to raise Money for carrying on the War; as also,
to appoint more Troops to advance towards the
Frontiers, He likewise, settled his Affairs of
Civil Government, and appointed a Body of an
Army to continue about <HI>Moscow,</HI> to keep all quiet
at the Capital.</P>
<P>HE had left the Army above, under the Com∣mand
of the Princes <HI>Czermet</HI> and <HI>Repuin,</HI> both
bold daring Officers, and accustom'd to the Ser∣vice,
tho' natural <HI>Russians,</HI> and who had often
look'd the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the Face. But, as above, it
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
was the <HI>Czar</HI>'s express Order to them, to harrass
the <HI>Swedes</HI> with continual Parties, and Excur∣sions,
but never to come to a general Battle with
them if it was possible to avoid it.</P>
<P>THIS they observ'd exactly, so that when the
<HI>Swedes</HI> pass'd the <HI>Vistula</HI> these retreated before
them; in the mean Time, the pretended King,
<HI>Stanislaus,</HI> with a strong Body of Troops, as well
<HI>Poles</HI> as <HI>Swedes</HI> advanc'd toward <HI>Sandomir,</HI> to try
if possibly he could, either by fair Means, or foul,
bring over the confederate Nobility to joyn
with him; and he had the more Prospect of it at
that Time, because he carry'd with him the In∣strument
of King <HI>Augustus</HI>'s relinquishing them,
and in which, was somthing particularly reflect∣ing
upon their Conduct; and which, <HI>if they resent∣ed,</HI>
it might be very propable they would take
Part with the new King. But it was not to be
done, the <HI>Poles</HI> true to themselves, <HI>that is to say,</HI>
ever factions, and steady to nothing but their
Unstreadiness; tho' they had declin'd the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Proposal for a new Election, tho' they had no
new King, and their old One had disown'd them,
as a People not worth any Prince's while to Go∣vern;
yet they would not hear of <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> but
assembling again at <HI>Opatow,</HI> they bound them∣selves
by a new Oath, to oppose King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI>
and the <HI>Swedes</HI> also, to the last Drop. So that
King <HI>Stanislaus</HI> not being willing to use Force with
them, least he should drive them again into the
Arms of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> and indeed, not be∣ing
strong enough, to attack them, came away and
left them, and jovn'd the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at <HI>Minsk,</HI>
in <HI>Lithuania.</HI> That which encouraged the Conse∣derate
Nobility the more, was, that besides 22000
<HI>Russians,</HI> which the <HI>Czar</HI> had ordered to march to
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
<HI>Opatow,</HI> to defend them; they had by a particu∣lar
Negotiation, brought over the <HI>Cossacks</HI> of the
<HI>Ukraine,</HI> to favour their Interest; and General
<HI>Mazeppa,</HI> the famous Chief of the <HI>Cossacks</HI> ad∣vanced
to joyn them with 30000 Horse, and pro∣mised
them, on Occasion, 20000 more.</P>
<P>THIS encourag'd them still the more, and made
the other of the Nobility come in to them; so
that they began to rise on every Side, against
<HI>Stanislaus;</HI> his Friends had their Houses in∣sulted,
and their Lands Wasted, and were every
where fain to fly to the <HI>Swedes</HI> for Succour; even
the Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI> was obliged to follow the
Course of King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> and with all his Depen∣dents,
making about 6000 Men, came to the
<HI>Swedes</HI> Camp at <HI>Minsk.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Swedes</HI> continu'd in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> from <HI>March</HI>
to the Middle of <HI>June,</HI> not yet resolving, it seems,
which Rout yet to take; And the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
not finding <HI>Poland</HI> in a Posture fit to be
left to their own Defence; In all this Time, they
could never come to any considerable Action with
the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Troops; The principal Skirmish we
had with them, was near <HI>Mohilow,</HI> on the <HI>Boris∣thenes,</HI>
where they surpriz'd a Body of about
8000 of our Men, most of them Dragoons; who,
after a very Gallant Defence, in which the <HI>Swedes</HI>
lost abundance of Men, were oblig'd to retire
with the Loss of about 3000 Men kill'd, and
taken Prisoners.</P>
<P>THIS Days Action might have let the <HI>Swedes</HI>
have seen, that the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Troops were now
quite another sort of People than they used to be,
and fought with as much Order and regularity as
other People; that they rallied as expertly after
any Disorder; and retreated as orderly after a
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
Defeat. In a Word, That they would soon be
equal to other Nations on all Occasions; but the
<HI>Swedes</HI> were too blind in their own Praises, to
foresee the Fate that was before them; so that this
little Victory, did but animate them to their own
Ruin, and prepare them still to do more rash
Things than ever they had done before.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Swedes,</HI> as if irresolute still what Course
to take, stay'd at <HI>Mohilow</HI> 'till the 20th of <HI>July.</HI>
They were now at a Crisis of thier Affairs, if
they had a Mind to march for <HI>Moscow,</HI> as they pre¦tended;
the Way was before them from <HI>Mohilow</HI>
North East to <HI>Smolenskow,</HI> and so keeping the <HI>Bo∣risthenes</HI>
or <HI>Neiper</HI> on their Left, they had a plain
Country, of about 360 Miles from <HI>Smolenskow</HI>
to <HI>Moscow;</HI> it is true, the <HI>Czar</HI> had laid waste
the Frontiers, and lay full in his Way with three
Armies, which altogether made about 140000 Men,
and these he was resolv'd they should fight at
three Times, one after another, and all within
two or three Days of one another, before they
could go on.</P>
<P>BUT here it was plain the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> car∣ry'd
on a secret Intelligence with that ruin'd Tray∣tor
<HI>Mazeppa,</HI> having found Means by Bribe∣ry,
and other Methods, to corrupt him, who had
indeed, the <HI>Ukranian Cossaks</HI> much at his Call, be∣ing
their hereditary General.</P>
<P>THIS Treaty was carry'd on, as we afterwards
understood, by some of King <HI>Stanislaus</HI>'s his Party,
and particularly by the Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI> or,
<HI>Kiovia,</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s fast Friend; And
in a “Word, was fully concluded, tho' in an ill
Hour, as well for himself, as the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
while their Armies lay at <HI>Mohilow.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204"/>
As soon as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had a full Satis∣faction
that this Treaty was concluded, he de∣camp'd
from <HI>Mohilow,</HI> and to the Surprize, not of
the <HI>Russians</HI> only, but of all the World, left the
direct Road for <HI>Moscow,</HI> and turn'd away South,
keeping the River on his Right, and march'd Di∣rectly
to <HI>Czernikiow</HI> on the River <HI>Desna▪</HI> on the
Frontiers of the <HI>Cossacks</HI> Country, and where he
had more immediate Correspondence with the Re∣bel
<HI>Mazeppa,</HI> as we shall see presently.</P>
<P>HAD his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty continued at <HI>Mohilow,</HI>
but 10 Days longer, he had been joyn by his
famous General <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> with 15000 Men, all
gallant Troops indeed, and with a new Train of
heavy Cannon, and a vast Quantity of military
Stores, who was in full March to joyne him. But
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as I have observ'd, was un∣der
the great <HI>Climacterick</HI> of his Fame, and all
Things went against him, so he marched away,
and General <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> followed.</P>
<P>IT has been observ'd, by those who tell this
Story in Favour of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that Ge∣neral
<HI>Lewenhaupt,</HI> having 15000 Men with him,
all old Soldiers, and experienc'd well dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iplin'd
Regiments, he might be very well supposed not
to want a Convoy; and the mean Opinion the
<HI>Swedes</HI> had of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> added to their Con∣fidence
in that Affair; the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having
on that Occasion, said, as 'tis Reported, that an
Army of 15000 <HI>Swedes</HI> was never beaten by the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> in a pitch'd Battle before, at least in
the Memory of Man.</P>
<P>GENERAL <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> had a long March,
for he came from the Provinces of <HI>Courland,</HI> and
<HI>Livania,</HI> where he had drawn this Army together,
with great Care, and been four or five Months in
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
his Preparations; he made easy Marches through
<HI>Lithuania,</HI> where he was joyn'd by some old Re∣giments
of <HI>Swedes</HI> out of the <HI>Great Poland,</HI> and
he was now come within three Leagues of <HI>Mohilow:</HI>
His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty having Notice, of
his March, resolv'd to try the Mettle of his Troops,
upon this Body of Men, and to Cut them off
from joyning the <HI>Swedes</HI> if possible; and, indeed,
it was a Juncture that required some <HI>Coup d' Eclat;</HI>
for that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was already possess'd
of <HI>Czernikiow,</HI> on the <HI>Desua,</HI> where he had been
joyn'd by the Traytor <HI>Mazxeppa,</HI> with 10000 <HI>Cos∣saks,</HI>
and had the plentiful Country of the
<HI>Ukrain</HI> open to him; so had General Lewenhaupt
Joyn'd him, with these 15000 Men, his Army
would soon have been 100000 Men; that is to say,
44000 of his own Army, 15000 of General <HI>Lew∣enhaupt,</HI>
all <HI>Swedes,</HI> 8000 of the Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI>
who lay ready to joyn him, and 36000 <HI>Cossaks</HI>
who <HI>Mazeppa</HI> had promised to bring in.</P>
<P>IN this Case therefore, I say, the <HI>Czar</HI> resolv'd
to begin and try his Fortune with General <HI>Lew∣enhaupt:</HI>
For this Action he drew out a Select
Body of Men out of all his Army, being about
8000 Horse, and 23000 Foot, which was the
most, and gave the Command of them to that
fortunate General Prince <HI>Menzikoff.</HI> But the
<HI>Czar</HI> knowing the Importance of the Action, went
himself in Person to see it executed, tho' not ta∣king
any Command upon himself, but serv'd un∣der
his General as a Voluntier.</P>
<P>THE Fight lasted two Days, and almost a
Night, the Prince having marched with some
Speed in the Morning, to come up with the Ene∣my,
having shown himself in Order of Battle,
ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut Eleven a-Clock, he gave his Men some Time
<PB N="205" REF="206"/>
to Rest, and Refresh themselves; so that he did
not begin the Fight, 'till near Three in the After∣noon;
when advancing in excellent Order, he came
again in View of their Line, which was drawn
up to great Advantage, being surrounded with a
Morass on one Flank; and by their Carriages and
a Rivulet running close by them on the other
Flank: Had he entrench'd his Front, which it
was easy for him to have done, and which he had
Leisure enough for, it would not have been
practicable for our Men to have attack'd him:
But the <HI>Swedes</HI> scorn'd to Entrench against an
Army of <HI>Muscovites.</HI> And this arrogant Tem∣per
of theirs, was more than this once their
Destruction. For now they gave us a fair
Front to fall on, and we failed not to take the
Offer.</P>
<P>“THE Onset was given by the <HI>Russian</HI> Dra∣goons,
Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> commanded Colonel
<HI>Campbell,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Man who had the Van∣guard,
to cause his Regiment of Dragoons to
Dismount and attack two Battalions, which
the <HI>Swedish</HI> General Count <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> had
caused to advance about a Mile before the
Front of his Line, and posted behind a little
Morass, to dispute our Passage: Those two
Battallions made so quick a Fire upon our Men,
that they had hardly any time to Form them∣selves
into Order of Battle; Colonel <HI>Campbell</HI>
observing how active the Enemy were, caus'd
the five Squadrons who had Dismounted to ad∣vance,
to give Opportunity to the rest of his
Troops to put themselves into a Posture to fol∣low
them; and those Dismounted Dragoons ha∣ving
stood the Enemies Fire for some time, his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty caused them to be supported by
<PB N="206" REF="207"/>
four Battalions of his Guards, and two of <HI>Inger∣manland:</HI>
Our Men pouring in their Shot, up∣on
the two fore-mention'd Battalions, killed
above half of them that guarded the Passage,
and so facilitated our drawing up in Battalia
before the Enemies front.”</P>
<P>“GENERAL <HI>Lewenhaupt,</HI> perceiving his Van∣guard
was Beaten, resolved to prevent us; and
caused his Army to march up and meet us in
Battalia, then his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty observing
that the Enemies Line extended wider than
ours, ordered his Highness Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI>
to cause four Regiments of Dragoons to alight,
and they were immediately placed in our Left
Wing, with two Regiments of Horse to cover
their Flank, under the Command of General
<HI>Pflug;</HI> and our Right was commanded by the
Princes of <HI>Gallcizin</HI> and <HI>Darmstadt,</HI> whose Flank
was cover'd by two Regiments of Dragoons of
his Highness Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI>'s Guards; all
these Dispositions being made, about Eleven a
Clock the Signal for attacking the Enemy was
given by a general Discharge of all our Artillery:
About 12 a Clock the Enemy began to advance
towards us with great Fierceness and Resolution;
and the Fight being hot and obstinate on both
Sides, for above an Hour and half, the Vict∣ory
hung in Suspence.”</P>
<P>“DURING the terrible Fire, which was made
every where, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty appear'd in the
Places of most Danger, to annimate by his Va∣lour,
and Presence, all the Officers and Soldiers;
and observing that the Left suffer'd much, he
caused it to be reinforced by the Regiment of
Guards of Prince <HI>Menzikoff.</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208"/>
“THE Enemy observing, how well we acquit∣ted
our selves under the Eye of our August Ma∣ster,
begun to give Ground, yet drew off in
Order of Battle.”</P>
<P>“THEN we redoubl'd our Efforts, to improve
that Advantage: The Enemy being driven
back to their Waggons and Baggage, the Action
was for some time forborn on both Sides; about
three a Clock our Cannon coming up, began to
play again.”</P>
<P>“THINGS standing thus, His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
being inform'd, that General <HI>Bour</HI> was within
half a League of him with 4000 Men, thought
fit to wait a little for his Arrival.”</P>
<P>“ABOUT four a Clock General <HI>Bour</HI> came up
with his Body, and was oblig'd to endure the
Fire of the Enemies Artillery, before he
could joyn our Right, where he was to post
himself.”</P>
<P>“FROM this Junction, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty be∣gan
to entertain Hopes that all would end well;
and order'd that neither Right nor Left, should
renew the Fight one without the other; but
the Left Wing, having stood a good while
without attacking, the Impatience of all our
Officers and Soldiers superceeded that Order,
our Right Wing renew'd the Attack likewise
with the utmost Vigour.”</P>
<P>“THE Enemy seeing themselves repuls'd,
caus'd two Battallions and ten Squadrons of
their Reserve to advance, and Charge our Right
in Flank; but they were so well received, and
afterwards so closly pursu'd, that, of the two
Battallions, not above 50 Men escaped. Upon
this Advantage, our left, and our Center, push'd
forward among the Enemies Waggons, break∣ing
<PB N="202" REF="209"/>
all their Left Wing. On their Right <HI>Lew∣enhaupt</HI>
rallying his Troops, faced our Men who
were among their Waggons, and caused such a
Fire to be made on our Battallions and Squa∣drons,
as oblig'd them to retire; but our Cen∣ter,
and Left Wing advanced at the same Time
against the Enemy, who were oblig'd to Face
to the Right about, to make Head against us; then
the Charge, was renewed with greater Fury than
before, both by the Horse and Foot, and their
Fire which the Enemy answer'd duly, did not
cease 'till it was dark Night, when we could no
longer distinugish our own Men, from our
Enemis.”</P>
<P>“IN the Night, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty consider∣ing
the Difficulty of dislodging the Enemy
from behind the Waggons, forbid the Officers,
on pain of being Cashier'd, and the Soldiers of
being hang'd, to quit their Ranks, to rifle the
killed; so the Army kept all Night under Arms
watching the Enemy, In the mean Time the
Trophies of the Day, were presented to his
Majesty, consisting of 47 Colours, and 10
Standards; and 16 Cannon, which he had
gain'd, were added to our Train of Artillery.”</P>
<P>“THUS we pass'd the Night, which was very
Cold, and towards the Morning, we saw the
Enemy kindle Fires, about their Waggons. His
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty order'd that Fires also should be
made in the Front of our Line, and that
we should hold our selves in a Readiness against
Break of Day; which being come, we march'd
towards the Enemies Waggons, expecting to meet no less Resistance than before; but we
found that <HI>Lewenhaupt,</HI> had made use of that
Stratagem to cover his Flight, abandoning to
<PB N="203" REF="210"/>
our Discretion, all the Wounded, and 7000
Waggons design'd to Supply the Want under
which the King his Master Labours.”</P>
<P>“GENERAL <HI>Pflug</HI> was immediately order'd
with a 1000 Granadiers on Horse-back, and
2000 Dragoons, to pursue and harrass the fly∣ing
Enemy; he had not March'd above half
a League, when he found the Remains of the
Enemy in a Wood, and falling upon them,
he made a Slaughter among them for the
Space of a League and a half, to <HI>Propoi∣sick'</HI>
where the rest of the Run-aways, to the
Number of 3000, retir'd into the Church-Yard.”</P>
<P>“OUR General advancing to Force them,
they made a Signal that they were desirous
to Capitulate; and then he sent a Lieutenant
Colonel, with six Granadiers, to receive their
Offers of Capitulation; but many of the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI>
Soldiers being Drunk with Brandy, would
not agree to their Officers Propositions, and
many of them Firing, kill'd two of our Gra∣nadiers,
the Lieutenant Colonel seeing their
Headiness, retir'd. And General <HI>Pflug</HI> resolv'd
not to spare them; our Granadiers and Dra∣goons
enter'd the Church Yard Sword in
Hand, kill'd all that resisted. During this Exe∣cution,
part of them fled towards the River
<HI>Soza;</HI> General <HI>Mikusch</HI> pursu'd that Party two
Hours, and saw Count <HI>Leuwenhaupt</HI> Swimming
through that River among his Men; whereup∣on
he swam it with his Detachment, and com∣ing
to the other Side, most of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Offi∣cers
begg'd Mercy and he gave them Quarter,
but caus'd the Soldiers to be put to the Sword:
He rejoyn'd General <HI>Pflug,</HI> with all the Officers

<PB N="204" REF="213"/>
and Booty; and those Prisoners reported, that
General <HI>Leuwenhaupt</HI> was Dead of two Shots
through his Body.”</P>
<P>“THE next Day, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty caus'd
Thanks to be solemnly return'd to the Almigh∣ty
for this signal Victory, which cost the Ene∣my
20 Regiments, amounting to 16000 Men,
among them, Major General <HI>Sculemburgh,</HI> who
was kill'd on the Field of Battle, with all the
Officers that were not taken Prisoners.”</P>
<P>“WE have 2673 Prisoners, 103 Officers, 47
Colours, 10 Standards, 16 Cannon, 7000 Wag∣gons,
and all the Arms and Baggage; the
Victory being compleat.”</P>
<P>“ON our Side, we lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t 70 Officers kill'd or
dangerously wounded, 1277 Soldiers kill'd,
2734 wounded, among them his Highness the
Prince of <HI>Darmstadt,</HI> General <HI>Baur,</HI> Colonel
<HI>Weiden,</HI> and two <HI>Muscovite</HI> Colonels.”</P>
<P>UPON this Dissaster, the <HI>Swedes</HI> were at a full
Stop, they could neither go forward, or back∣ward,
they had lost all their Ammunition, and all
their Magazine, among which were 20000 small
Arms, wherewith they propos'd to Arm, and
Discipline the <HI>Cosacks</HI> which should Rebel; they
lost 500 Ton of Musket Bullets, 6000 Barrels of
Powder, and about 600000 Rixdolars in Money;
their Communication with <HI>Poland</HI> was entirely
cut off, and the Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI> the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI>'s faithful Allie, was utterly disabled
by another Defeat given him, by the Crown
Army of <HI>Poland;</HI> so that King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI>
and General <HI>Crassau,</HI> who with another Army of
18000 were advanc'd almost to <HI>Lemberg,</HI> could
get no intelligence of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or
<PB N="205" REF="214"/>
of his Army, nor by any Means break thorough
to set him Free.</P>
<P>IT is true, the Province of <HI>Ukrania,</HI> a rich,
fertil, and plentiful Country, supply'd the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> effectually with Provisions in Great
Plenty; and his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty seeing what
Condition he was reduced to, mark'd out a Camp,
in a very advantagious Situation, on the River
<HI>Desna</HI> between <HI>Czeruikhow</HI> and <HI>Mekoszi;</HI> where he
caus'd strong Entrenchments to be made, and
mounted his Cannon resolving not to be attack'd
by Surprize. Here he resolv'd to stay till he had
recruited his Magazines of Millitary Provisions
as well as his Army with Troops; but during his
whole Stay here, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty so scour'd
the Country with continual Parties, that no Mes∣senger
he could ever send arriv'd, nor could he
receive any Intelligence from the rest of <HI>Poland,</HI>
or they from him.</P>
<P>DURING this long Encampment, his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty's General, by incessant Parties, cut off
abundance of his Men, and continually harrass'd
them with his Troops, and gave them two or three
very considerable Defeats.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, the <HI>Swedes</HI> on the other
Hand, found Means to get some Supplies of Amu∣nition
out of <HI>Podolia,</HI> and from <HI>Lemberg</HI> they got
some small Arms, tho' all was with great Difficulty
brought to them, the Confederates being strongest
on that Side, and it being a most tedious Way to
bring things all by Land Carriage to <HI>Kiovia</HI> in
the <HI>Ukrainalso;</HI> and on the Side of <HI>Vol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inia,</HI> they
Listed a great many Men, with which they fill'd
up all the Regiments of General <HI>Leuwenbaupt</HI>'s
Army, which we had defeated, and made them
as strong as when we first attack'd him; on∣ly,
<PB N="206" REF="215"/>
with this Exception, namely, that they were
not so good Soldiers by a great Deal.</P>
<P>THUS the two Armies pass'd the Winter, and
the first part of the Spring. But the Season ad∣vancing,
and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> still fancying
himself strong enough to put his Designs in Ex∣ecution,
and hoping for great Matters from the
<HI>Cossacks,</HI> he prepar'd for his Enterprize.</P>
<P>IT should have been obsery'd here, that the
Rebel <HI>Mazeppa,</HI> finding the <HI>Czar</HI> Press'd hard up∣on
the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> and terrify'd them from follow∣ing
him; so that he could not bring that Number
with him to his new Confederate the King of
<HI>Swden,</HI> as he had Promis'd, endeavour'd by Par∣ties
and Inroads on the side of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> to in∣tercept
all the Provisions that should be convey'd
that Way to the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Army, and ravag'd the
Country far and near, by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s
Order; to punish them for which Treachery, Prince <HI>Manzickoff</HI> advanc'd with Treachery,
Prince <HI>Menzickoff</HI> advanc'd with 24000 Foot,
And 6000 Horse, to the East Side of the <HI>Ukrain,</HI>

<PB N="207" REF="216"/>
the Place, that in one Night and Day, he had
made a tolerable Breach, which tho' it was not
what they call practicable, in the Common Dia∣lect
of the Enginiers, yet he caus'd it to be
storm'd: The Garrison defended themselves with
a great deal of Obstinacy, and kill'd the <HI>Mus∣covites</HI>
by Heaps in their Ditches. But the Russi∣ans
led on again, and annimated by the Presence
of their Generals, fell on with such Fury, and
withal, in such Numbers, that they enter'd the
Town Sword in Hand, cut all the Traytor <HI>Cossacks,</HI>
being 6000, as above, in Pieces; not giving Quar∣ter
to one of them; which was a Piece of requisite
Justice, not only upon them for their Treason
and Rebellion, but in Terror to the rest, who
had shew'd Inclination enough to Rebel; as for
the Town it was plunder'd by the Soldiers.</P>
<P>NOR did their Execution fail of its disign'd End,
for it effectually aw'd the rest of the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> from revolting to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as was the design
of the whole Nation of them, besides which, it
lessen'd the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> Army 6000 Men, for
those 6000 were Part of the 10000 who had join'd
the <HI>Swedes</HI> with their General.</P>
<P>AFTER the taking of this Town, which was
Sight of the whole <HI>Swedish</HI> Army, the River
<HI>Desua</HI> only parting them; over which, however,
the <HI>Swedes</HI> had no Bridge. I say, after this, the
<HI>Russian</HI> General suppress'd entirely the Dissafecti∣on
of the <HI>Cossacks,</HI> and having proclaim'd <HI>Mazep∣pa</HI>
a Traytor, and caused him to be bang'd in
Effigic, made the whole Body of <HI>Cossacks</HI> meet,
and choose another Chief or General, which was
done with the loud Acclamations of the People;
so the <HI>Czar</HI> was in some Degree even with the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for if he deposed one King, the
<PB N="208" REF="217"/>
<HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> now deposed another, for tho
<HI>Mazeppa</HI> was not a King in Title, he was equal
to a King in Power, and every way Equal if not
Superior to King <HI>Augustus</HI> in the divided Circum∣stances,
in which his Power stood, even at the
best of it.</P>
<P>AND now the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having resolv'd
to move forward, decamp'd, in an evil Hour for
him, in the begining of <HI>June,</HI> and passing the <HI>Des∣na</HI>
at <HI>Czeruibow</HI> advanced towards <HI>Pultowa.</HI> The
Country all the Way in this March being low and
level, is full of Rivers-which fall into the <HI>Neiper,</HI>
and lying just cross the Way which the <HI>Swedes</HI> were
to March, they had sometimes three or four of
those Rivers to pass in a Day; the Reason of this
is plain, for that the Course of the <HI>Boristhenes</HI>
being here from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South,</HI> and the great
River receiving into it all the smaller Rivers of
the Country of both Sides, the Course of those
Rivers naturally must be from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West,</HI> on
the Side where the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army march'd.</P>
<P>THIS retarded the March of the <HI>Swedes</HI> very
much, who were oblig'd to mate Bridges over
most of those Rivers, and who drew a great
Train of Carriages with them for their Baggage,
and Ammunition, besides their Artillery.</P>
<P>SOME of these Rivers indeed, the Weather
being dry, and the Season so far advanc'd, were
low, and might be foarded by the Cavalry and
Carriages, but others again could not.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> whose Autho∣rity
press'd on his Men, forc'd to March over all
the Rivers, and whatever Difficulties offer'd to
stand in his Way, push'd on till he came to <HI>Pul∣towa;</HI>
a Town which the <HI>Czar</HI> had forti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y'd in a
better manner than formerly; and as it was a
<PB N="209" REF="218"/>
Frontier against the <HI>Budriack Tarter,</HI> who used to
make their Incursions that way into <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty finding the <HI>Swedes</HI> in
Motion, broke up with all his Army from <HI>Smo∣lensko,</HI>
where he had encamped in order to dispute
the Ground Inch by Inch with them, if they had
offer'd to move towards <HI>Moscow,</HI> and mov'd after
them; he had never stirr'd from that Situation
with the Gross of his Army while the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> lay on the Bank of the <HI>Desna,</HI> least find∣ing
his Army remov'd, they should counter
March and slip by him on the Way to <HI>Moscow;</HI>
but now finding the <HI>Swedes,</HI> running farther
into the Net, he pursu'd with his whole Army,
which was about 70000 Men, besides about 42000
which were posted at distant Places, as at <HI>Mohi∣low,</HI>
and at the River <HI>Bug,</HI> to prevent Succours
passing to the <HI>Swedes.</HI></P>
<P>WITH this Army his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty follow'd
the <HI>Swedes</HI> so close, that he was always at Hand
to take any Advantage that might offer.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who was now near the
End of his good Fortune, and found himself
embarrass'd with the Difficulties of the Country,
encamp'd under the Walls of a Town, tho' not
considerable in it self, yet better fortified, and
better furnish'd than he expected, wanting many
Things necessary for a Seige of Importance; and
which was worse, the <HI>Czar,</HI> who he had always
flatter'd himself, would never venture a Battle, was,
as I have said at his Back with an Army of 70000
Men, and not only seem'd resolv'd to venture a
Battle with him, but posted himself in such a man∣ner,
as that it was apparent he would Besiege him
and his Camp, and perhaps attack his Intrench∣ments.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="219"/>
HAD not the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Courage exceed∣ed
his Discretion at that Time, and his ill Fate
hurry'd him on to his own Destruction, he would
certainly have carry'd on his Attacks in the usual
Form, and choosing a strong Situation, have en∣camped
with the Gross of his Army to cover the
Siege; expecting that if the <HI>Czar</HI> would raise the
Seige, he should fight him with all the Disadvan∣tages
usual on such Occasions; as namely, that of
attacking a Powerful Army entrenche'd up to the
Teeth, and posted with all possible Art and Ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>BUT on the other Hand, had their Resolution
to Fight been attended with the usual Prudence of
a good General, such as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> cer∣tainly
was, and such, as if he had not been so
himself, all his other leading Men were esteem'd
to be; particularly, Field Marischal <HI>Rhenschild,</HI>
the Generals <HI>Lewenhaupt, Slippenback, Stakelberg,
Stenbook</HI> and others; and it was very strange they
should not re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rain him, by Reasoning against the
Measures taken; but to do him Justice, it is re∣ported
that his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty was not so much
for fighting as his Generals were, and that it was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a Council of War, before the King gave
his Opinion: The case was dubious, and every
Man <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to speak first against Fighting, least
be should be supposed to want Courage, and least
the King, whose Temper was 7s;o well known,
should resert it; thus it was that all Men voted
for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> even almost every one of them
were against it in their Judgements.</P>
<P>THIS was too much the Effect of the exceed∣ing
Fire in the Temper of their Monarch, who was
so much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by his Officers, that they it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> voted as they thought would be most agree∣able
<PB N="211" REF="220"/>
to their Prince's Humour, than Safe and pru∣dent
for his Interest and Honour.</P>
<P>THE Neighbourhood and Strength of the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Army made it difficult, and scarce practicable
to carry on the Siege of the Place, the Garrison
being numerous also, and well furnish'd, and the
<HI>Swedes</HI> began to see a Necessity of removing the
Enemy, or of raising the Siege, and upon this
Occasion, the great Council of War was called,
where it was, unfortunately for them, resolv'd
to Fight.</P>
<P>BEING now come to mention the Battle it self,
I refer the Reader to a full Account of it given
by the Enemy themselves, because what they ac∣knowledge
comes with ah Authority not to be
deny'd; whereas, speaking of a Thing of such
Consequence on the Side of that Monarch, whose
Story we write, we may be the more suspected
of Flattery and partiality; take it then from
their own Accounts as follows,</P>
<P>“Our Army, <HI>say</HI> they, consisted of about 36000
Men if we had been all together, of whom our
Cavalry made the better Half; our Infantry in
the Battle, were not above 15000; neither had
we any Artillery with us; the Design being to
force an Enterance, and then break in with our
Horse; of these Forces we left our whole Body
of Reserve as before noted, in the Camp; which,
with other Troops left there, were about 8000
Men; so that in the Battle we had not above
28000 Men.”</P>
<P>“THE King led on his Cavalry, and with him
General <HI>Lewenhaupt, Steenboch,</HI> and <HI>Spar; Rhens∣child,
Horn and Stakelberg</HI> commanded the Foot;
as soon as we came out of the Defiles, and saw
the Countenance of the Enemy, it was easie to
<PB N="212" REF="221"/>
see we had a terrible Task on our Hands; but
there was no looking back, the King with his
usual intrepidity advanc'd to the Charge, and
with his Horse fell upon a great Body of <HI>Musco∣vite</HI>
Horse, who were advanc'd from The rest,
and in a Moment drove them into the Line of
Horse, which stood behind them, upon which
the rest of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Horse advancing the
whole Line acted at once, and push'd the Ene∣my
several times into Confusion; but by the
Vigilance of their Officers, and the help of new
Troops, they restored their Line and fought with
the utmost obstinacy: During this part of the
Action, the Enemy with a great Body of Horse,
and some Foot had wheel'd at some distance,
and appear'd on our Flank in order to sur∣round
our Cavalry, some Troops charg'd them,
but being over power'd were repulsed, and
this made us slacken the Charge in Front for
fear of being cut of from our Infantry.”</P>
<P>“THAT in the mean time our Infantry ad∣vancing,
and the Horse making a Halt till they
came up, form'd themselves in order of Battle,
the Horse on the Wings, and the Foot in Cen∣ter,
and advanc'd again directly to the Enemy,
Charging them with great Fury and good Suc∣cess;
but the Cannon from the entrench'd
Camp advancing, and the Troops opening in
several Places for their playing upon us; it
was impossible our Foot could keep their or∣der,
or the Men stand in the Face of seventy
Peices of Cannon, loaden with Cartouches of
small Shot; so that our Generals saw it absolute∣ly
necessary to draw of the Foot, the Horse all
this while continu'd engaged, and drove the
Cavalry of the Enemy every where before them,
<PB N="213" REF="222"/>
but the Enemies Foot advancing to support
their Cavalry with their Fire, our Horse also
sounded a Retreat, and drew off in very good
order out of the Field of Battle, recover∣ing
the Defiles were our Foot was posted. The
Enemy made a no pursuit at that time, the E∣nemy
made shew of advancing indeed on our
Left, and some Skirmishes happen'd, but they
were beaten off with Loss; however, having
thus left the Field of Battle to the Enemy, se∣veral
Disasters follow'd; as first, being cut of
from our Camp, our Body of Reserve, our Ar∣tillery,
heavy Baggage, Carriages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fell all
into the Enemies Hands, and the Troops left
there were oblig'd to yeild themselves Priso∣ners
of War; in this Condition there was nothing
left to consider of, but Retreating with all pos∣sible
Speed before the Enemy should be in a
posture to attack us, and the way for this was,
if possible to reach the <HI>Baristhenes,</HI> and get
means to pass over the Troops, and reach to
<HI>Kiou.</HI>”</P>
<P>“GENERAL <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> had the Conduct of the
Retreat, and he march'd with such Expedition,
that all the Troops came to the Bank of the
River the next Day, about One at Night, tho'
extreamly fatigu'd and harrass'd, especially
the poor Infantry, of whom many died by the
way, either of their Wounds, or by the extremity
of the March; insomuch, that as appear'd after∣wards,
there were not 4000 of them left, above
3000 of them chose rather to fall into the Enemies
Hands, then suffer so severe a March, and so drop'd
off some and some by the way, expecting every
Hour to be knock'd on the Head by the Ene∣my,
many of them wandered about the Coun∣try,
<PB N="214" REF="223"/>
and got into <HI>Poland</HI> afterwards, and Listed
in the Troops of King <HI>Stanislans,</HI> so escaping to
the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army at better Leisure.”</P>
<P>“BUT we were in no better Condition now then
before, for the River was a full stop to us; Boats
there was none, we had no Materials for a
Bridge, or time to ma ke it, we knew the Ene∣my
was at our Heels; we had neither Strength
left to Defend ourselves, nor Ammunition to
Supply a Battle if we were disposed to it; nei∣ther
had we Provisions to keep our Men from
perishing: In this strait the main Concern of
our Generals was for the safety of the King, to
have him fall into the Hands of the Enemy
was worse than Death to think of, there was
but one way, which was to venture to Swim the
great and rapid River that we lay on the Bank
of, and then to make the best of his way into the
<HI>Turks</HI> Dominions, his Majesty made light of the
hazard; but it was easie to see that it was with
extream reluctance that he parted with his be∣loved
Troops, who he knew must immediately
fall into the Hands of the Enemy; but there
was no deliberating in the Choice; his Majesty
could not by staying save his Men, and falling
into the Enemies Hands with them, would but
increase their Misfortune, so it was resolv'd;
and the next morning the King, attended by
about <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the best Horse pass'd the River in a
little Boat, most of the rest Swam the River, be∣ing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by some <HI>Cossack</HI> Gentlemen, who it
seems in that Country make light of it;
they all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> safe on the other Side. His Ma∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> private Orders to the rest of his
Men <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could make any escape, they
should f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow towards the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominions,
<PB N="215" REF="224"/>
where they would soon hear of him, if he got
safe thither. That same Evening the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Prince <HI>Menzickoff</HI> at the Head of about 10000
Horse, appear'd in sight of our Camp, and Ge∣neral
<HI>Reinschild,</HI> who was then Prisoner among
them, having signify'd to them, as they said,
that it was probable in the Condition we was
in, we would Capitulate; the Prince sent a Trum∣pet
with a <HI>Swedish</HI> Captain, and a <HI>Muscovite</HI> Co∣lonel
with a Letter to our General, to offer us,
if we would Surrender, good Usage and hono∣rable
Conditions; this was the more welcome
to us, because it was wholly unexpected: The
matter needed no Debate, our Circum∣stances
admitted of nothing else, and if
he had not sent to us; we must have sent to
him, and have yeilded; wherefore our General
after holding a short Council of War,
return'd a respectful Answer to the Prince,
signifying, that if he might have Soldier like
usage, and be treated honourably, he would en∣ter
into a Treaty, but that if not, they would
die with their Swords in their Hands, and sell
their Lives as dear as they could; in the mean
time many of our Men enrag'd at the Thoughts
of the Slavery of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> threw themselves
madly into the River, some strip'd and Swam,
but they found it worse, for many of them pe∣rish'd
with Hunger, and with wandering naked
over the Country, and some not able to reach
over, for the River is there very Broad, were car∣ried
down the Current and drown'd; to be short
with this dismal Story; we obtain'd very hono∣rable
Conditions, and Surrendered to the <HI>Mus∣covites;</HI>
tho' we cannot say those Conditions
have been so honourably p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm'd as they
<PB N="216" REF="225"/>

<P>OUR Loss being thus of our whole Army, it is
needless to enquire how many fell in each particu∣lar
Action; but, this is certain, that what the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> have publish'd of 10000 Men slain in
the Battle, cannot be true; we reckon about 6000
kill'd in the Action, 2000 Prisoners, at that time
also, 7000 in the Camp before <HI>Pultowa,</HI> about
2000 who swam over the River, with, and after
the King, 3000 who wandred away and escap'd
into the Country, and 16000 now with General
<HI>Leuwenhaupt;</HI> thus far the <HI>Swedish</HI> Account.</P>
<P>I COME then to the Account, which was given
from the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army, which is more proper∣ly
my Part, and which varies in nothing, but the
Manner of Things: Which, however, is very
significant to know, and is as follows.</P>
<P>“AFTER the <HI>Muscovites</HI> had pass'd the River
<HI>Works<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> with their whole Army on the 20th of
<HI>June, O. S.</HI> they encamp'd within a League of
the <HI>Swedes</HI> till the 24th, that Day they advanc'd
within a Quarter of a League of them, and en∣camping,
presently caus'd an Entrenchment
to be thrown up before the Camp to prevent
all Surprize; their Cavalr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was posted in the
Woods, cover'd by the Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oubts, furnish'd with
Men; and tho' the <HI>Czar</HI> gave out Orders for
preparing to attack the Enemy, they prevent∣ed
him according to their usual Custom; for on
the 27th early in the Morning, while it was
yet dark, the <HI>Swedes</HI> came nut of the Defiles,
where they had lain all Night on their Arms,
and attack'd the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Cavalry both
<PB N="221" REF="230"/>
with their Horse and Foot so vigorously, that
notwithstanding they were repulsed several
times, and beaten off with Loss from the Redoubts
which they assaulted, the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Cavalry,
who cou'd not be assisted in time by the Infan∣try,
were oblig'd to retire towards their En∣trenchments;
but soon return'd to the Charge,
entirely defeating the <HI>Swedes</HI> Right Wing, and
took Prisoner General <HI>Slippenback,</HI> who com∣manded
it; while this was doing the <HI>Czar</HI> de∣tach'd
Prince <HI>Menzickoff,</HI> General in chief of
the Army, and Lieutenant General <HI>Rentzell,</HI> as
well to cut of the Troops, who were advancing
to the Assistance of the Enemy, as to attack
those left in the Trenches under the <HI>Swedish</HI> Ge∣neral
<HI>Rosen;</HI> the Prince marching accordingly,
met in his way the Enemy's Body of Reserve
of 3000 Men, whose Right Wing was Flank'd
by a Wood; after some Ressistance he broke
them, put some to the Sword, gave Quarters to
the rest, and return'd to the main Army; leaving
Lieutenant General <HI>Rentzell</HI> to proceed on
to <HI>Pultowa,</HI> at whose approach the <HI>Swedish</HI> Ge∣neral
<HI>Rosen</HI> retir'd with his Regiments into the
Works they had made; however, the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
General attack'd him, and forc'd him after some
Ressistance to Surrender with all his Men at
Discretion: On the other hand, the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army
having in retiring joyned their Foot; all
the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army drew up in order of Battle a∣gainst
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Front, at the distance of a∣bout
a Quarter of a League; the <HI>Czar</HI> at the
same time caus'd two Lines to move out of the
Entrenchments, leaving the Third to guard the
Camp, and drew up his Army in such a manner,
that his Infantry made the main Body, and
<PB N="222" REF="231"/>
the Cavalry the two Wings, of which the
Right was commanded by Lieutenant <HI>Bauer</HI>
in the room of Lieutenant General <HI>Rence,</HI> who
was wounded in the first Engagement: The
Left was commanded by Prince <HI>Menzickoff,</HI> his
Presence being most necessary, and his main
Body was commanded by the <HI>Czar</HI> in Person:
The Field Marshal <HI>Czeremettoff;</HI> the Generals
of the Foot, Prince <HI>Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in</HI> and M. <HI>Hallard,</HI>
as also Lieutenant General <HI>Belling</HI> attend∣ing
at his Post; Lieutenant General <HI>Brous</HI> had
the Direction of the Artillery; the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Army being in this posture, no sooner began
to move towards the <HI>Swedes,</HI> then contrary to
expectation, these had the boldness after the re∣pulse
they had receiv'd, to advance to meet
them: About nine in the Morning the Fight
began, and the fire grew thick on both Sides,
which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> continu'd with such Brave∣ry
that they defeated and broke the <HI>Swedes</HI> Army,
after a Battle of half an Hour; a thing very
strange, and put both their Horse and Foot to
the Rout, the latter not daring to Halt, or
make farther opposition, and were driven like
a Herd of Cattle, with Sword, Bayonet and
Pike quite to the Woods. Major-General <HI>Sta∣kelberg</HI>
was the first Prisoner taken, then Gene∣ral
<HI>Hamilton,</HI> Field Marshal <HI>Rhenschild,</HI> the
Prince of <HI>Wirtenberg,</HI> Cousin to the King of
<HI>Sweden;</HI> many Colonels and Subaltern Officers,
and some thousands of Foot and Horse, a great
Number of which yielded themselves volunta∣rily
with their Horses, and Arms. The <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
Cavalry pursued the <HI>Swedes</HI> full speed a∣bove
half a League, that the Plains and Woods
for three Leagues round the <HI>Pultowa,</HI> were strew∣ed
<PB N="223" REF="232"/>
with the Enemies Bodies; the Number of
their kill'd being 8 or 10000; thus by the help of
the Almighty they gain'd so compleat a Victo∣ry
over the <HI>Swedes,</HI> that it is hardly to be paral∣lel'd,
and that with little Loss by the Victori∣ous
Arms of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and under his own Con∣duct,
in which he most eminently fignaliz'd
his Valour and Experience in the War, exposing
himself to all Dangers, and had his Hat shot
thro'; Prince <HI>Menzickoff</HI> had three Horses
wounded under him; 'tis worthy to be remark∣ed,
that 'twas only a Line of Foot, of 10000
Men, who defeated the Enemy, the other Line
not being engaged. Here follows a List of the
Prisoners, and of what was taken from the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> as far as they could inform themselves
in the first two Days.”</P>

others in the Ankle; and indeed, so various

of Men, which did not exceed 9000 to advance
against the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and some Prisoners having ad∣ded,
that they believed they might be dispos'd to
surrender themselves on terms of Capitulation:
His Highness summon'd them to yield, intimating
to them, that they were depriv'd of all Means of
escaping by a Retreat, and that if they rejected
his offer, they were not to hope for Quarter,

to which, the <HI>Swedes</HI> who contrary to all expecta∣tion,
were yet 16286 Men strong, well arm'd
and mostly Horse, yielded themselves Prisoners
of War, and laid down their Arms, surrender∣ing
that Day to Lieutenant General <HI>Bauer,</HI>
with the Camp Chest or Treasure, the Military

<OPENER>To the General, Velt Marischal, Lieutenant.
MONSIEUR,</OPENER>
<P>I Acquaint you, by these Presents, with the great
Victory I have (unexpectedly) obtain'd, by the
Blessing God, and the unspeakable Bravery of my
Troops, with very little Loss on my Side; in the fol∣lowing
Manner: The Enemy early this Morning, at∣tack'd
with all their Forces, both Horse and Foot;
our Cavalry, which behav'd themselves so well, that the
<HI>Swedes</HI> were repulsed with great Loss; they drew up
again in Order of Battle before our Army, where∣upon,
we caused our Infantry to march out of our
Intrenchments, and drew up our Forces in order of
Battle; and posted our Horse, on the Wings of the
Foot, which being perceiv'd by the Enemy, they did
the like, and having attack'd us, they were so well
receiv'd by our Troops, that they were oblig'd to
quit the Field; and our Troops took many Standards,
Colours, and Cannon; and among the Prisoners,
there are the General Velt Mareschal <HI>Renschild,</HI> be∣sides
four other Generals, <HI>viz. Slippenbach, Sta∣kellbrugh,
Hamilton,</HI> and <HI>Rosen;</HI> the first Minister
of State, Count <HI>Piper,</HI> the two Secretaries of
State, <HI>Hermelin</HI> and <HI>Cederkielm;</HI> and some thou∣sands
of Soldiers and Officers, of which we will cause
the Particulars to be sent to you very speedily, because
the Shortness of the Time does not permit to do it at
present. To say all in a Word, the Enemy's whole
Army has bad the Fate of <HI>Phaeton;</HI> we do not yet
know what is become of the Person of the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> whether he be Living, or with our Fathers.
We have commanded our Lieutenants General, <HI>Galic∣zin</HI>

</LETTER>
<P>THUS ended all the vast Designs of the King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> of whom we shall say no more here,
than that he escaped, as hath been said, into the
Dominions of the Grand Seignior, and was well
receiv'd by the Order of the Port at the City of
<HI>Bender,</HI> a Frontier of the <HI>Turks,</HI> on the Side of
<HI>Tartary,</HI> and on the Banks of the <HI>Neister,</HI> and
where he meditated his Revenge, in a Manner so
unbecoming a Christian Prince, as to animate
the <HI>Manometans</HI> and Common Enemies of <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI>
to make a War against the <HI>Czar;</HI> and was
again the Occasion of much Blood, and much
Cost to the <HI>Christian</HI> World, as shall appear in its
Place.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had now no more Work
upon his Hands of this Kind, the Grand Enemy
being thus gone, and that Army entirely defeat∣ed,
which had been so long the Terror of <HI>Poland;</HI>
what remain'd, was the Work of meer Negotiation
and Alliance. The pretended King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI>
and his Party, having now lost their main Sup∣porter,
fell into their first Nothing, whence they
came, and King <HI>Augustus</HI> dethron'd in an Arbitra∣ry
and violent Manner, as has been said; was in∣vited
to re-assume the Kingdom, even by many of
those, who had been Instruments in turning him out.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="237"/>
THAT Part of the Affairs of <HI>Poland,</HI> relate so
much to the Affairs of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> had
so much Glory in restoring that ruin'd Prince
King <HI>Augustus,</HI> notwithstanding he had relinquish'd
his Friendship, and broken his Treaties with him,
that it cannot be omitted.</P>
<P>AS Moderation, and doing Good for Evil, is
one of the Best of <HI>Christian</HI> Virtues, so forgetting
Injuries, and relieving oppress'd Princes, is one
of the brightest Parts in the Glory of the Conque∣ror;
the <HI>Czar</HI> made it one of his first Dispatches,
to give King <HI>Augustus</HI> a Part in the Joy of his
Victory, and thereby let his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty see,
that he had Kindness enough left, to forget what
was past, and place it all to the Account of the
Violence he was under; and we were told a Mes∣sage
was soon after sent to invite him to reas∣sume
the Throne, with Assurances of Support,
from the same conquering Hand, which had driven
his only Enemy, <HI>that is to say,</HI> his only formi∣dable
Enemy out of <HI>Christendom,</HI> and who was
now in a State of Exile, among the <HI>Barbarians,</HI>
without an Army, without his victorious Gene∣rals,
without his Chief Minister Count <HI>Piper,</HI>
without Friends, and without Money; and con∣sequently,
that there was no Room to fear his
Return into <HI>Poland,</HI> or meddling any more with
the Affairs of that Country.</P>
<P>WHETHER this were so or not, <HI>this is certain,</HI>
that King <HI>Augustus</HI> no sooner received this surprizing
and unexpected News, but he began to cast
about his Return and meditate his going back in∣to
<HI>Poland,</HI> to recover the Crown, which was torn
from his Head by Violence and War: Nor was it
long before he receiv'd such Invitations from the
<HI>Poles</HI> themselves, as without any Room to consider
<PB N="229" REF="238"/>
farther, determin'd him in the Affirmative, as
we shall see presently.</P>
<P>IF the Overthrow of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was
a Surprize of Joy to the abdicated King <HI>Augustus,</HI>
it was no less an Astonishment to King <HI>Stanislaus;</HI>
indeed it was a Clap of Thunder to him, a Bla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
from Heaven, that at one Gust, overthrew him
and all his Interest and Friends.</P>
<P>HE was at <HI>Lemberg</HI> when he met with the
News, and had with him General <HI>Crassau,</HI> with a
Body of 16000 <HI>Swedes,</HI> very good Troops, and
had about 12000 <HI>Poles,</HI> who were most of them
Gentlemen, and were very well mounted: So
that he had near 30000 Men, besides the Palatine
of <HI>Kiou,</HI> who was hearty in his Interest, and had
about 8000 Men more, with him, at his capital
City of <HI>Kiou,</HI> or <HI>Kiovia.</HI></P>
<P>HAD the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> after the Loss of
the Battle at <HI>Pultowa,</HI> instead of Flying into the
<HI>Turks</HI> Dominions he scarce knew whether, kept
to the North, and gone to <HI>Kiou,</HI> and had directed
all that could escape to have done the like, he
had play'd a Game, that might still have renew'd
the War, for his Cavalry which surrender'd to
the <HI>Russians,</HI> would immediately have separated,
and in small Bodies have escap'd, and perhaps
five or six Thousand of them, have got together
there; and having such a Body of Men at Hand,
as King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> and the Palatine <HI>Kiou</HI> had, as
above, he would have been 50000 strong again
immediately; but, <HI>Lui Jupiter vult perdere hos
dementat,</HI> his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty was not to take one
right Step, or do any thing but what was to pre∣cipitate
himself, and all his Friends into farther
Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="239"/>
AS soon as King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> his People, receiv'd
the News, they stood like Men Thunder-struck,
looking at one another; the <HI>Poles</HI> that were with
him, and adheard to his Interest, began to con∣sult
their own Safety, and fled like <HI>Israelites</HI> eve∣ry
Man to his Tent; so that of 12000 Horse, he
had in a Weeks time, scarce 2000 left, General
<HI>Crassan;</HI> with his <HI>Swedes,</HI> foreseeing the Storm that
began immediately to gather behind him, I mean
from <HI>Saxony,</HI> and of which I shall speak at large
presently, began to consider in what Part of the
World he was, namely in the remotest Part of
<HI>Poland,</HI> that he had no Time to lose, and that if
he did not immediately secure the Passages into
<HI>Prussia</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> his Retreat might be cut
off, or he might be obliged to cut his Way
through with the Sword.</P>
<P>UPON this Consideration, he immediately put
himself in a Posture to Retreat, and by long
Marches, made towards great <HI>Poland;</HI> nay, he
made such Expedition, that it look'd as if he had
been pursu'd by the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army; but the
Truth of the Case was, that he feared more his
Enemies that were before him, than those that
were behind him; King <HI>Stanislaus</HI> went with him,
and glad he was to have such a Convoy; for he,
that a little before, had a great Body of Troops at
his Command, was glad now to take Shelter in a
<HI>Swedish</HI> Camp, and to quit <HI>Poland,</HI> as fast as he
could, least he should fall into the Hands of his
Rival.</P>
<P>AND this brings me to the Sum of the Affair
on that Side; the Victory of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
at <HI>Pultowa,</HI> had more Influence upon that remo∣ter
Part of the World, by a great deal, than up∣on
that Part where it was transacted; the <HI>Czar</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="240"/>
had nothing to do, but to stand still and see with
Pleasure, the Consequences of his Victory over
the whole Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> over the whole
Electorate of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and indeed over all <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE mention'd before how the Confede∣rated
Nobility, call'd the assembly at <HI>Lublin,</HI> had
rejected the, Invitations of King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> and
how they met afterwards at <HI>Sendomir,</HI> and how even
after the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI> return into <HI>Poland,</HI> they
yet kept together, and took an Oath to stand by
one another; tho' at the same time they would
not come into the Measures, which the <HI>Czar</HI> would
have brought them to, <HI>viz,</HI> to Choose a third King
of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING is more certain than that this Con∣federacy
were the Life of King <HI>Augustus</HI> Cause at
last, for they all a long kept a Correspondence
with him, and waited only an Opportunity to re∣store
him to the Crown; nor were they without
very rational prospects of bringing it about, even
from the first time, that they saw the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> pursue such wild Chimerick Projects as
dethroning the <HI>Czar,</HI> marching into <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and
afterwards into <HI>Urkania;</HI> but especially after
they found that the <HI>Czar,</HI> at the Head, but of a
Part of his Army had defeated General <HI>Lewen∣haupt,</HI>
and such an Army of Soldiers as he had
with him, who were thought to be invincible, and
that all the Ammunition, and Millitary Provisions,
which were carrying to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> were,
fallen into the Hands of the <HI>Russians;</HI> these things
not only put the Confederated Nobility in Heart;
but they actually pursued the Design of bringing
back King <HI>Augustus,</HI> let his Engagements submit∣ted
<PB N="232" REF="241"/>
to, when under Violence, and Opposition of
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> be what they would.</P>
<P>“ON the other Hand it was easie to see for some
time before the Battle of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> that King
<HI>Augustus,</HI> had form'd new Designs, and was ta∣king
Measures for another Attempt upon <HI>Po∣land,</HI>
he found that notwithstanding the King of
<HI>Sweden's</HI> advance into <HI>Poland,</HI> he made no great
influence on the <HI>Poles;</HI> that the Nobility had an
universal hatred to King <HI>Stanislaus;</HI> he found
also, that altho' the <HI>Czar</HI> push'd at a new Electi∣on,
yet he could not, bring the <HI>Poles</HI> to consent to
it; but that they manifested an exceeding Af∣fection
to his Person, and a great desire to see him
once again at the Head of his Armies in <HI>Poland;</HI>
the <HI>Czar</HI> also found he should never bring the
<HI>Poles</HI> to fall into a Conjunction with him, but
that the Interest of King <HI>Augustus</HI> reviv'd, and
that he could not with all his Art, no not by
threatening to abandon them to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> bring
them to publish an <HI>Interegnum,</HI> much less to
hear of a new Election; but that they owned
to him, that they knew as King <HI>Augustus</HI> was
driven by violence to give up the Crown, so
he would not be backward to take the first op∣portunity
to re-assume it. These Considerati∣ons
brought the <HI>Czar</HI> and King <HI>Augustus</HI> also to
a secret Correspondence, and even before the
Battle of <HI>Lesno,</HI> where Count <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> was
beaten; King <HI>Augustus,</HI> who all the World ex∣pected
would have retrench'd his Expences, and
lessen'd his Troops to recover his Losies, on a sud∣den
listed Men throughout all his Dominions,
and among all the Princes of his House, till he
had such an Army as all well knew the Revenues
of his own Country could not maintain, tho'
<PB N="233" REF="242"/>
it had been in the time of his greatest Prosperi∣ty;
for he had rais'd above 30000 Men, where∣of
at leaft 16000 were Horse; a Force which
it was apparent, was with some extraordinary
Enterprise in View: Certain it was, he could
not foresee the Defeat of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
neither could he expect with all the Forces,
which it was in his power to raise, to be able to
fight the <HI>Swedish</HI> Forces; so that if he had not
had some secret Assurances, he could never have
been so weak to have ventured a second. At∣tempt,
after the first had been so fatal to him;
It is true, when by the frequent going, and re∣turning
of Courriers to and from the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> and King <HI>Augustus,</HI> and from publick
Conferences held with the Minister of the <HI>Czar</HI>
at <HI>Dresden,</HI> some umbrage was taken, that he
was forming new Designs in Concert with the
<HI>Czar</HI> against the <HI>Swedish</HI> Interest, he endeavour'd
to take off those Apprehensions by publickly
declaring there was no Designs of that kind on
Foot; ordering his Minister at the Court of <HI>Ber∣lin</HI>
to signifie to his <HI>Prusian</HI> Majesty, that the
Reason of those Conferences, and Dispatches,
were only to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettle some mutual Pretensions
between him, and the <HI>Czar;</HI> particularly, as to
<HI>Patkull's</HI> Papers, and Writings belonging to his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, which were in the Hands of
a <HI>Muscovite</HI> Commissary, who died at <HI>Dresden;</HI>
These were the Answers given upon those Occa∣sions;
but we found not long afterwards that
this first was only to amuze the Courts of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
till his Designs were ripe for Execution;
for no sooner was Count <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> defeated
at <HI>Lesno,</HI> as has been said, and the <HI>Swedish.</HI>
Communication with <HI>Poland</HI> cut off, the <HI>Czar</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="243"/>
sending Word to King <HI>Augustus,</HI> that he had the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at an Advantage, and that he
would answer for giving a good Account of him.
I say, no sooner were these Appearances of Suc∣cess
in his View, but King <HI>Augunstus</HI> began to
discover himself; the great and open Concourse
of the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility to his Court, the fre∣quent
Expresses sent to <HI>Cracow,</HI> where the No∣bility
in his Interest were Assembled; the visi∣ble
Concert of Measures with the Crown Ge∣neral,
and the <HI>Polish</HI> Army, and several other
Circumstances made it no longer doubted but
that he had resolv'd to return into <HI>Poland;</HI> but
as soon as he had receiv'd by Express from the
<HI>Czar,</HI> on Account of the Battle of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> and
of the entire defeat of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army, as
you have heard, with the Flight of his <HI>Swedish</HI>
Majesty to the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions; he then
threw off the Mask, and made his Designs no
longer a Secret.”</P>
<P>BUT this went farther immediately, for now
the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility throng'd to <HI>Dresden,</HI> to make
their Court to the King, and to tender their Ser∣vice
to him, and a little after this came a solemn
Deputation from the Crown Army, and from the
Confederate Nobility at <HI>Sendomir,</HI> to invite him
to return to his People, and to take upon him a∣gain
the Governvent; promising all the Obedi∣ence
and Fidelity of Loyal Subjects, and to set
him upon the Throne again, and maintain him
thereon against all his Enemies whatsoever.</P>
<P>UPON all these Encouragements he could do no
less than consent, so he receiv'd the <HI>Polish</HI> Deputati∣on,
acquainted them with his Resolution to return
into <HI>Poland,</HI> and at the same time sent an Ambassador
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> to Congratulate him upon
<PB N="235" REF="244"/>
the News of his Victory, and to acquaint him
with his new Measures, desiring his Concur∣rence,
and Assistance, which was only matter of
Form, all that Part having been concerted, and
concluded between them long before his Prepa∣rations.</P>
<P>IT is time now to look back to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty's
Proceedings after the great Battle at <HI>Pul∣towa;</HI>
the first thing was to send a strong Body
of Troops over the <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> to push the flying
Enemy; this Party pick'd up some straglers, but
the chief Service was to hurry the King of <HI>Swed∣land</HI>
forward, who hearing of those Troops in
his Rear, would be sure not to return towards
<HI>Poland,</HI> which was the only thing that the <HI>Czar</HI>
was unwilling should happen.</P>
<P>SOME of the stragling <HI>Swedes,</HI> who escaped
from the Battle, fell into the Hands of a <HI>Musco∣vite</HI>
Officer, who was posted on the Frontier of
<HI>Polodia,</HI> who attack'd them, and after a short,
but bloody Engagement, the <HI>Swedes,</HI> of whom
about 120 were kill'd, surrendered, and were
made Prisoners, being about 250 Men; but as
for about 800 <HI>Cossacks,</HI> the <HI>Russian</HI> General looking
on them as Rebels, and Traytors, would give
them no Quarter, but they were all cut in Pieces.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Kiou</HI> was the only Man that
stood firm for King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> even after he had
receiv'd News of the Loss at <HI>Pultowa,</HI> and after
the Retreat of the said King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> and of
General <HI>Crassau,</HI> as above; but as his Forces were
small, he was fallen upon by a Deteachment from
the <HI>Russian</HI> Army and entirely defeated, and fled
afterward to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at <HI>Bender.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was that <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Kiou,</HI> who brought
the <HI>Cham</HI> of the <HI>Tartars</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="245"/>
together, and so wrought with the <HI>Cham,</HI> and
thro' his means with that <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperor, that
he brought the <HI>Czar</HI> into the fatal War with the
<HI>Turks,</HI> in which he had that Misfortune to pur∣chase
Peace with the Loss of that important For∣trese
of <HI>Asoph,</HI> and there-with of all that pro∣spect
the <HI>Czar</HI> had of Commerce, and Conque<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t on
the Side of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> of which so much has
been said in the beginning of this History, and of
which we shall have more to say very quickly.</P>
<P>IT might take up some time here to look into
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> and take some Notice of the rejoycings
there, upon the News of this Victory and the
Triumph of the <HI>Czar</HI> at his return to <HI>Muscow,</HI> his
Capital City; but I shall Couch it all in this
short Abridgement at present, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it was
such as it is impossible to describe.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Muscovites</HI> were not a little in pain at first,
on the approach of such a Prince, and such an
Army, as Fame had represented the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
and his Army to be; and at the Apprehensi∣ons
of that very Prince approaching them, who
had so terribly defeated them at the Battle of
<HI>Narva;</HI> and to have an Account that this Prince
was beaten, and that in such a manner, as scarce
ever Army was beaten before, <HI>viz.</HI> so that none
at all of so great a Power should escape, except
such a trifling Number as is mentioned to have
gone away with that King; this must be surpri∣sing
(to be sure) to them, since it was so to all the
World.</P>
<P>BUT the Triumph of their Prince exceeded all
the rest, and indeed his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had as
much Reason to Triumph as ever any <HI>Roman</HI>
Consul, or <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor had for the greatest
Victory they ever won; for the <HI>Romans</HI> exceeded
<PB N="237" REF="246"/>
in Military Knowledge, and the Experience of
Wars of all the Nations of the World; but here was
a Prince, and even a Nation, who were, as it
might be said, but as of Yesterday in War, yet
victorious over the bravest and most experienc'd
Soldiers then thought to be in the World: In a
Word, it was a Victory that the World thought
impossible; the Scholars beating their Masters
the <HI>Russians</HI> beating the <HI>Swedes,</HI> was like the <HI>Gauls</HI>
beating the <HI>Romans;</HI> which was the Wonder of
the World.</P>
<P>AS the Glory of the Victory was great, so,
the <HI>Czar</HI> being willing his Subjects should see
what their Monarch had fought so boldly for, and
to show familliarly to them the Affair of War, he
let them see the Trophies which he brought, and
what had been purchased at the Expence of their
Blood. This glorious Triumph was made the
21st of <HI>December,</HI> 1701, and is here set down at large, from the most Authentick Account.</P>
<P>On the 11th, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty attended by
Admiral <HI>Aparxin,</HI> and several of the Nobility,
arriv'd at a Country Seat, call'd <HI>Kolemski,</HI> which
is about five <HI>English</HI> Miles distant from <HI>Moscow,</HI>
Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> went thither on the 14th, and
on the 16th, the whole Court took up their Lodg∣ings
in one of the Suburbs which is separated
from the Town by the River <HI>Moscow;</HI> his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty had appointed to receive the Compli∣ments
of all the Foreign Ministers on the 17th,
but a great Fire happening to break out in the
Neighbourhood, the <HI>British</HI> Envoy was oblig'd
to defer his Visit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till the Day following; at
which Time the <HI>Czar</HI> receiv'd him with great
Distinction, at Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI>'s Appartment,
<PB N="238" REF="247"/>
and was pleas'd to confer with him several Hours.
Monsieur <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uel,</HI> Envoy from the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
to that Court, together with Monsieur <HI>Grand,</HI> his
Predecessor, had Audience of his Majesty, in a
private manner. But it being inconvenient the
Court should stay in a Place where there were so
litle Accommodation, his Majesty gave Orders that
the Publick Entry should be made on the 21st,
altho' the Preparations which were making for
that Solemnity were not compleated, and the
Triumphal Arches, of which they had erected
seven, were not perfectly finish'd; the necessa∣ry
Instructions being accordingly given, the Pro∣cession
was perform'd on the 21st, in the following Manner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seminiowski</HI> Regiment led the Way, who were
followed by the Cannon, Colours, and Officers that
were taken in the Battle against General <HI>Lewen∣haupt;</HI>
these were closed by a Company of <HI>Preobra∣fenski</HI>
Guards, the <HI>Swedish</HI> Remains, of the Battles
of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> and <HI>Perewolosch</HI> marched in the next
Place, the Non-commission'd Officers of this Body led
the Way, next to them the Ensigns and second Lieute∣nants,
in the third Place came the Lieutenants, and
next to them the Captain Lieutenants, after whom
the Captains of both Foot and Horse; these were
followed by the Officers and other Attendants of the
Train of Artillery, who preceeded the Ordinance;
after which were carry'd the Kettle-Drums, and Co∣lours;
then march'd the Majors, Lieutenant Colonels,
Colonels, and General, Adjutans and were succeeded
by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Houshold, and Equipage, to∣gether
with the Litter and Bed that he used in the Day
of Battle; after which came the chief Officers, each
marching single, in this Order; Monsieur Posse Colonel
<PB N="239" REF="248"/>
General of the Guards, Major General <HI>Hamilton,</HI>
Major General <HI>Stakelbergh,</HI> Major General Rose,
Major General <HI>Crass,</HI> Major General Caxcits,
Major General <HI>Schelippenback,</HI> General <HI>Lewen∣haupt,</HI>
Field Mareschal <HI>Rheinschild;</HI> the whole, be∣ing
closed by Count <HI>Piper,</HI> the King of Sweden's first
Minister of State, then his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty on a stately
Horse, which had been presented to him by King Au∣gustus, with his Sword drawn, which was formerly a pre∣sent
from King Augustus to the King of <HI>Sweden:</HI> He
followed the Prisoners, at the Head of the <HI>Preobrasens∣ki</HI>
Guards, having Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> on his Right,
and Prince <HI>Dolgoruki</HI> on his Left; in this Order
they made their Procession through the City, and his Majesty was received at the first Triumphal-Arch, by
the Magistrates, at the second, by Prince <HI>Gavari</HI>
Governour of the Town; at the third, by the Nobi∣lity;
at the fourth, by the principal Merchants;
at the fifth, by the Clergy; at the sixth, by the
Empresses Dowager, and the Princes of the Blood;
and at the last, by the Burghers: The foreign Mini∣sters
had separate Houses allotted them for their Cere∣mony,
and his Majesty made a short stand at the re∣spective
Places where they stood: The Cannon was
fired several times round the Town during the Solem∣nity,
and all possible Demonstrations of Joy, were ex∣press'd
on that Occasion: About Eight or nine Thou∣sand
Soldiers that were taken Prisoners, were brought
into the Town on the Day preceeding; but the Officers
belonging to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Foot Guards, ha∣ving
not arriv'd from <HI>Kiow,</HI> soon enough to appear in the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Triumphant Entry, they were publickly
conducted into that City, on the 27th, with the same
Solemnity, as the other Prisoners, had before march∣ed,
on the first Instant.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="249"/>
HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty treated all the chief Per∣sons
of Quality, and the foreign Ministers at a
publick Dinner; in the Evening sumptuous Fire
Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, on which were several Inscriptions, and
Representations, was prepar'd and went off with
great Exactness: The chief Machines were, a
<HI>Pha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iton</HI> struck with a Thunder-Bolt; and another
Figure, in allusion to a late Medal Struck in <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
two Pillars were first lighted, which sup∣ported
imperial Crowns, and were adorn'd with
great Variety of blue, green and pale Flames;
when they had burnt some Time, a Lion mov'd
forward, on whose Approach, the first Pillar
broke short at the Pedes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al, but as he advanc'd
near the second, a Spread Eagle representing his
Majesty's Arms, launch'd a Rocket, which blew
the Lions Head and Neck off, and the Pillar re∣mained
firm to the last.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, however, made but a short
Stay at <HI>Moscow,</HI> he knew as well how to im∣prove,
as how to gain a Victory, having there∣fore
driven his two capital Enemies, the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and the Palatine of <HI>Kiow</HI> into the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Dominions, secur'd the Frontiers as well of <HI>Poland,</HI>
as of <HI>Moscovy,</HI> from their returning, by posting
a strong Body of Horse, on the Frontiers of the
former, about <HI>Lemberg</HI> and <HI>Kiovia;</HI> and another
on that Side of the <HI>Unkrain,</HI> on the Bank of the
<HI>Boristhenes,</HI> with Orders to them both, to Scour
the Countries so effectually, that no Foreign
Troops might enter. <HI>I say,</HI> His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
having thus secur'd the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> from re∣turning
into <HI>Poland</HI> or <HI>Muscovy;</HI> he order'd his
Troops to File off to the <HI>North,</HI> and by easy
<PB N="241" REF="250"/>
Marches to come to <HI>Smolensko,</HI> under the Leading
of Prince <HI>Czeremetoff,</HI> and General <HI>Baur,</HI></P>
<P>FROM thence, one Body of them marched in∣to
<HI>Lithuania,</HI> and about 28000 of them, were di∣rected
to wait the Orders of King, <HI>Augustus,</HI> who
was now, in Concert with the <HI>Czar</HI> returning in
to <HI>Poland</HI> as above; as soon as they heard his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solish</HI>
Majesty had pass'd the <HI>Oder,</HI> they were to ad∣vance
to the Banks of the <HI>Vistula,</HI> on the other
Side of <HI>Warsaw,</HI> to be ready to go wherever the
King of <HI>Poland</HI> should lead them.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had now a clear Country
before him, and having before reduc'd all the
Inland Part of the Province of <HI>Livonia,</HI> taken
<HI>Narva,</HI> reduc'd <HI>Ingermanland,</HI> razed <HI>Scansterny</HI> on
the <HI>Neva,</HI> built the Fortress of <HI>Croonslot,</HI> and be∣gan
to build the Royal City of <HI>Petersburg;</HI> he
resolv'd now, to attack the Coast Towns of <HI>Livo∣nia,</HI>
which were very Strong, and had in them
numerous Garrisons of <HI>Swedish</HI> Soldiers, who were
sure to make a long and vigorous Defence; at
the same time, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty resolv'd, to
extend his Conquest on the North of <HI>Ingermanland,</HI>
into <HI>Finland,</HI> and the Hereditary Dominions of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>IN Consequence of these Resolutions, his <HI>Cza∣rish</HI>
Majesty ordered a Body of an Army to march
from the Side of <HI>Pleskow</HI> and <HI>Novogrod</HI> into <HI>Fin∣land,</HI>
and attack the strong City of <HI>Wybourgh,</HI> the
best Port in all that Part of the Country, while
another Army at the same time march'd thro'
<HI>Lithuania</HI> into <HI>Livonia,</HI> and besieg'd the strong
City of <HI>Riga.</HI></P>
<P>THIS last was an Undertaking of great Impor∣tance,
for the City of <HI>Riga</HI> was a terrible Place,
strong by situation, and that situation improv'd
<PB N="242" REF="251"/>
with the otmost Art; it had a numerous Artille∣ry,
a strong Fort, or rather Fortress command∣ing
the Entrance to it by Sea, call'd the <HI>Duna∣muder
scans,</HI> being indeed a Royal Citadel, exquir∣sitely
Fortified, and almost inaccessible; it was
reported that there was in the City and the <HI>Shcans</HI>
a Garrison of 10000 Men, including the Burghers,
who did Duty as Soldiers, commanded by General
<HI>Stromfield,</HI> an experienced Officer, and a Man
from whom the World expected all that became
a Man of Honour, and of the utmost Bravery.</P>
<P>BUT all this was far from Discouraging the
<HI>Czar</HI> from the attempt; he knew the importance
of the Enterprise, and that now was the critical
Juncture, in which it was to be Undertaken,
with a prospect of Success; the Affairs of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
being in such Confusion, that he was very
sure to meet with no Interruption from without,
his Majesty therefore resolv'd on the Seige.</P>
<P>THIS Siege was begun by Field Marshal <HI>Cere∣mettoff,</HI>
but was after some time stop'd, and af∣terwards
carried on only by a Bombardment and
Blockade, in order to save the effusion of Blood;
it was certain that there was time enough before
them to reduce the Garrison to Extremity, no
Relief being likely to come to the Place by Sea,
and none possible to be brought by Land; at the
beginning of this Blockade a most lamentable Dif∣saster
befel the Besieg'd, in which the Besiegers
had no hand at all; for the 22d of <HI>January</HI> the
Labratory where the Engineers made their Fire∣works,
and fill'd their Bombs, which was built in
the Rear of the Bastions, adjoyning to one of the
Magazines belonging to the Garrison took fire by
accident, and the fire reaching one of the shells
it burst, and in an instant the whole House, with
<PB N="243" REF="252"/>
the Magazine, adjoyning, blew up into the Air
with a Blast that shoke the whole City, and made
even the Earth as far as the <HI>Russian</HI> Camp trem∣ble:
There was, 800 Barrels of Gunpowder in the
Magazine, besides what was in the Labratory;
and besides the Shells which were fill'd; the Con∣sternation
in the City was inexpressible, not a
a House but suffer'd, and the whole Place look'd
like a City in Ruins; of the Garrison the Bar∣racks
being near the Place, 600 Men were entire∣ly
lost, including the Guard of the Bastion; the
Bastion it self was entirely ruined, and the great
Hospital, in which was 1200 sick or wounded Sol∣diers,
besides the Officers of the House attending
them was blown up, and not a Soul of them all
left a live; so that in the whole, near 2000 Peo∣ple
were destroyed, besides such as were wounded
an other Parts of the Town.</P>
<P>THE Governor under the greatest surprise of
Mind, as well as influenced by the Blast being on
the Parade of the Place, giving orders for a Sa∣lly
fell down as one dead; and when by proper
Applications he recovered himself, he could not
hear, no not the Noise of a Drum; he had no Notion
for a great while, but that a Mine had been Sprung
by the Enemy under the Bastion, and that they
would immediately Storm the Breach.</P>
<P>THE force of the Powder had not only blown up
the Bastion, but it had made a Breach in the Bo∣dy
of the Place nine or ten Yards wide, so that e∣ven
the Horse might have come in; the rest
of the Officers, while things were in this Extre∣mity,
being under no such great Concern, and
Consequently less surpris'd, than the Governour,
resolv'd sooner what was to be done, and beat∣ing
to Arms, rais'd the whole Garrison to defend
<PB N="244" REF="253"/>
the Place if they should be attack'd; then they
caus'd all the Horse Dung and Litter, which could
be had to be brought to the Place, and made up
the Breach in the Bastion as well as time could
permit, setting three Rows of Pallissadoes before
the Breach, and making a large Coupre or Re∣trenchment
behind it; so that tho' the <HI>Russians,</HI> had
they been aware of the Blow, might have made an
Advantage of it; yet such was the Diligence of
The Garrison, that they made it up, as above, the
same Night that the Dissaster happen'd; nor could
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Generals make any advantage of it.</P>
<P>THE Blockade of this Place held till the latter
End of <HI>July,</HI> 1710, when General <HI>Stromfield,</HI> the
Governor was oblig'd to Capitulate, the Garrison
being reduc'd by Hunger, and hard Service, and
by the fire of the Bombs, together with the Dis∣saster
above-mention'd, to less than 2000 sound
Men; the <HI>Russian</HI> Velt Marshal gave them honour∣able
Conditions, as well for the Garrison, as to the
Burghers and Inhabitants, Courts of Justice, and
Nobility, to whom all their Priviledges, Judica∣tories,
and civil Rights were continu'd and pre∣served;
as to the Garrison, they were allowed all
Soldierly Honours, and to be conducted to <HI>Revel,</HI>
upon Condition nevertheless, that they should Em∣bark
there, and return to <HI>Stockholm.</HI></P>
<P>GENERAL <HI>Baur,</HI> who as I have noted before,
serv'd under the Velt Marshal <HI>Czeremet</HI> at this
Seige was immediately after the surrender of <HI>Ri∣ga,</HI>
Detach'd with a good Body of Troops, to at∣tack
<HI>Peruan,</HI> which he reduc'd in about 6 Weeks,
being taken the 19th of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>DURING the Blockade of <HI>Riga,</HI> General, or
Admiral <HI>Apraxin,</HI> who for the time commanded
the Land Army, besieged <HI>Wybourgh</HI> in <HI>Finland,</HI> as
<PB N="245" REF="254"/>
above. The Governor had Conditions granted
him also upon the Capitulation; but the Admiral
thought fit after the Surrender to detain the Gar∣rison,
by way of Reprisal, till satisfaction was
obtain'd for several Breaches of the Rules of War,
which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in the time of his Pros∣perity
had practis'd upon his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
Subjects: As <HI>first,</HI> detaining a Ship sent by his
<HI>Gzarish</HI> Majesty's order into <HI>Sweden</HI> with a Flag
of Truce, to propose some Regulations of Passes
and Rules for visiting the Ships of Neutral Nations,
which Ship contrary to the Law of Nations was
never restor'd. (2.) Detaining the <HI>Russian</HI> Resident
at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> at the breaking out of the War, tho'
the <HI>Swedish</HI> Resident at <HI>Muscow</HI> was suffer'd to go
Home, without any manner of Restraint. (3.)
Because the Subjects of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who went into
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and liv'd there in the time of Peace, on
the meer Affairs of Commerce, and behaving
quietly and peaceably, had notwithstanding their
Effects seiz'd and confiscated.</P>
<P>GENERAL <HI>Apraxin</HI> found in <HI>Wybourg,</HI> part of
the Magazine for the whole Province of <HI>Finland,</HI>
The particulars are as follows,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>An Inventory of the Artillery, Arms, and Ammu∣nition
found in Wybourg.</HEAD>
<P>“EIGHT Mortars, Four-Bombs, from 40 to 80
Pound weight; 2 Hauwitezers of 16 Poun∣ders,
3 Brass Cannon of 9 Pound Ball, and 95
of Iron, from 3 Pound to 24 Pound Ball, 8644
Granadoes, from 5 Pound to 30, 17540 Bullets,
from 3 to 40 Pound, 1816 Cartridges, for from

of Copper, 1660 new Musquets, and 1950 used,
1700 new Carbines, 189 damaged, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There
were likewise found in the Town 58 Colours,
and one Standard.”</P>
<P>THE City and Port of <HI>Revel,</HI> the Isle of <HI>Osel,</HI>
the Town of <HI>Arensburg,</HI> and <HI>Kexholm</HI> in <HI>Finland,</HI>
were all taken this Campaign; a Year almost, as
glorious to the <HI>Czar</HI> as the last: In these Places
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> found great Quantities of Cannon,
and Ammunition, as also small Arms, and Hand
Granadoes in abundance.</P>
<P>THE whole Province of <HI>Livonia</HI> was now re∣duced,
except the <HI>Dunamunder schans,</HI> which Hea∣ven
gave into his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's hands soon af∣ter,
his own way, that is, by another Blast of
Powder. The <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> having by this time
compleated the Conquest of <HI>Livonia,</HI> and conse∣quently
Triumph'd over the <HI>Swedes</HI> in those Parts
of the World; his Majesty, to gain the Affection
of the People promis'd them, not only the con∣tinuation
of their Priviledges, but likewise to
discharge them from several heavy Burthens they
complain'd of under the Regency of the <HI>Swedes.</HI>
He also publish'd a Proclamation to encourage
Trade, and Navigation, and permitted the Ex∣portation
of all the Goods of the Country, ex∣cept
Timber fit for building of Ships, which he
had occasion for himself, being resolv'd to have
in a short time a considerable Navy in the <HI>Baltick.</HI>
Foreign Shirps which were come into the Harbours
of <HI>Livonia</HI> since the Conquest thereof, have been
receiv'd with all possible Civility; and in short,
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> neglected nothing to render their
Government acceptable to Foreigners as well as
to the Natives.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="256"/>
WE must now look a little back to the King
of <HI>Poland,</HI> and to the Powers with whom the <HI>Czar</HI>
of <HI>Muscovy</HI> had necessarily to do in this War;
I have taken notice that his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty having
been invited by the Confederated Nobility, and
encourag'd by his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, and especially
upon the Victory at <HI>Pultowa,</HI> to re-assume the
Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> had declar'd his Resolution to
do so, and was march'd for <HI>Warsaw,</HI> with 800
Horse, having pass'd the Order the 24th of <HI>Augusst,</HI> 1709.</P>
<P>IT remains to take notice that his <HI>Polish</HI> Ma∣jesty,
at his Entrance into <HI>Poland</HI> publish'd a full
<HI>Circular Letter</HI> of the Reasons, both of his having
Abdicated, and of his Return, which has so much
in it of his former Concert of Measures with his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, and so much just Acknowledge∣ment
of his Obligation to the <HI>Czar,</HI> that when
we shall find him forgetting those Obligations a
second time, we shall have occasion to look back
upon this <HI>Circular Letter,</HI> as a great Satisfaction, in
order to make a Judgement of the Justice of his
Proceedings. The <HI>Circular Letter,</HI> is as follows;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>We Augustus II, by the Grace of God, King of
Poland, Great Duke of Lithuania, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>TO All, and every One, this may concern, and in
particular, to the most Venerable, the Venerable
in Jesus Christ; the most Illustrious, Magnificent, and
Generous Senators, and Officers of the Nobility, and
to all the Inhabitants of the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and the great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> of what soever
Condition they be: We make known what follows, you
may have easily understood from our Proceedings, tho'
<PB N="248" REF="257"/>
we did not declare it; that altho' through a hard but
unavoidable Necessity, we were obliged to absent our
selves from you with the Body, yet you always re∣main'd in our Hearts: However, seeing that God
who has been mov'd with Compassion on one Part,
for our Sufferings and Misfortunes; and provok'd on
the other, by the excessive Pride of our Enemies; be∣gins
to promise more favourable Days to the King∣dom
of <HI>Poland;</HI> and seeing on the other Hand, that
in maintaining the Confederation of <HI>Sendomir,</HI> in all
its Parts, you have used your utmost Endeavours, for
preserving the Republick in the same Condition in
which we left it, according to the Example of true
and faithful <HI>Polanders;</HI> who have on all Occasions,
express'd their Loyalty to their Kings. And
1astly, Seeing that after an Heroical Patience, and so
long a Tryal, you are continually exhorting us, to re∣turn
and Resume the Government of the Kingdom of
<HI>Poland.</HI> We on our Parts being no less desirous than
you, or any Member of the Republick, to express our
Paternal Affection and Fidelity, being so indispenci∣bly
obliged thereunto, by the <HI>Pacta Conventa;</HI> that
according to the express Terms thereof, it ii not left
in our Power, altho' we should have a Mind to it,
to renounce a Crown which was so lawfully put upon our
Head: Insomuch, that whatsoever has been done con∣trary
thereunto, is to be look'd upon as null and void,
as you have declar'd, in the Diets of <HI>Leopold</HI> and
<HI>Lublin:</HI> Therefore we are return'd into <HI>Poland,</HI> to
assert and defend the Honour of the Crown; and we
declare, by these Presents, that as we have therein no
other Aim, than chiefly to maintain the holy ortho∣dox
Faith, defend the ancient Rights and Privileges
of the Nation, and preserve the Bounds of the King∣dom;
of all which, we are ready to give full Assu∣rances,
in the next Assembly or Council, by confirm∣ing
<PB N="249" REF="258"/>
the <HI>Pacta Conventa,</HI> as to the Points aforesaid,
according to the desire of the States: Therefore, We
earnestly invite all such, as are faithful to us, and
adhere to our Majesty, either Burghers or Military
Men, to assist us; and in this, we think to give them
Proofs of our paternal Gratitude; at the same time
we offer our Clemency, and paternal Affection, to all
those, who before we left the Kingdom, or since, have
quitted our Party upon any Pretence whatsoever; re∣presenting
unto them, that unless they are willing,
through a desperate Attempt, to expose the Publick
to a general Subversion, they have no Reason to de∣cline
this Act of Indemnity; being willing to forget
their Offences, and promising to receive them into our
Favour and Protection. Furthermore, We assure the
States of the Republick, that in the Passage and
Quartering of our Troops, we will keep them under
an exact Discipline, and will have all possible Regard
to the Estates of the Clergy and others, as long as the
War will continue; and after the Conclusion thereof,
which we pray God to hasten, we promise, upon our
Royal Word, to send them, without delay, out of the
Kingdom; being willing, wholly to conform ourselves
therein, to the Intentions of the Republick. We
Command all Officers, Civil and Military, and others,
to cause these Presents to be read and published, in
all Places.</P>

<P>THIS <HI>Circular letter</HI> was publish'd by King <HI>Au∣gustus,</HI>
at the Head of his Army as soon as he
enter'd <HI>Poland,</HI> and it was annex'd to a long <HI>Mani∣festo,</HI>
and to a like <HI>Circular Letter</HI> to the Nobility
and Clergy of <HI>Lithuania</HI> inviting them to come
and joyn him at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> offering to receive them,
and promising his Amnisty, or Pardon, even to
those who had joyn'd King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> and acted
against him.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Poles</HI> embraced this latter part, with al∣most
an universal Consent, and the King of <HI>Poland</HI>
was received with all the Caresses, and all the
Tokens of Zeal and Affection imaginable; as to
the particulars, such as the vast Concourse of the
Nobility to him at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> and the Harangues,
Speeches, Compliments, and Promises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made
to him, by those that attended his Court at <HI>War∣saw,</HI>
they relate more particularly to the History
of King <HI>Augustus,</HI> and I therefore refer the Rea∣der
to other Writers of them; only observing that
in the Course even of his History, we may per∣haps
see of how little importance, Vows and Pro∣testations
of Sincerity, Loyalty, and Fidelity
are in this Age, in those Parts of the World.</P>
<P>BUT leaving these things, it follows of Course
now to carry our History farther from his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty's share of acting than before, and go as
far as <HI>Denmark</HI> to find another Allie in this War,
in whose Territories, we shall quickly find his
Majesty obliged to act, as well in Person as by his
Armies and Navies, and to make a yet more
considerable Figure in the War, than ever he did be∣fore.</P>
<P>IT has been mention'd in the beginning of this
Work, how far the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was an Allie
with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and with his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty,
<PB N="251" REF="260"/>
in the beginning of the War with <HI>Sweden;</HI> how
the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> assisting the <HI>Swedes</HI> by Sea,
and the Troops of the House of <HI>Lunenburg</HI> assisting
the Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI> by Land, the King of <HI>Den∣mark</HI>
was forced to make a Disadvantageous Peace
with both <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Holstein,</HI> and have the Mor∣tification
to see his Conquest in <HI>Holstein</HI> snatch'd
out of his Hands, to raise his Siege of <HI>Toningen,</HI>
and to see the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> under the Protecti∣on
of the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Squadrons Land just
at his Palace Gate, and Bombard his capital City
of <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></P>
<P>BUT now the Tables were turn'd, the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> was, as it were, out of the World, and
the <HI>Czar</HI> the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Allie, and fast
Friend, was Victorious, and very Formidable; now
his Majesty of <HI>Denmark</HI> thought it was a Juncture
happily offer'd by Heaven, for him to push the
<HI>Swedes</HI> in his Turn, and to retrieve the Dishonour
which he had suffer'd, and that he had as just Rea∣son,
to Break with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as the
King of <HI>Poland</HI> had, whose Case was many Ways
the same.</P>
<P>WITH these Thoughts, and concerting Mat∣ters
with his <HI>Czarsh</HI> Majesty for assistance, as
well by Sea as by Land, he resolv'd to break
with <HI>Sweden</HI> immediately, and according to the
King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s Method, his <HI>Danish</HI> Majesty
publish'd also a Manifesto, of the Reasons for
his Resolution; this, as being not to our present
Purpose, I omit, and only mention it to Intro∣duce
the Story of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Part in
this War, which follow'd after.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Denmark</HI> having declar'd “War,
and brought a considerable Army together, re∣solv'd
to pass over with them to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>honen,</HI> a Pro∣vince
<PB N="252" REF="261"/>
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> once belonging to <HI>Denmark,</HI>
but Conquer'd formerly by the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and conceded to <HI>Sweden,</HI> by the Treaty of Ros∣child.</P>
<P>TO bring this Abridgment of the History of
this War into a narrow Compass, it is to be ob∣serv'd,
that the <HI>Swedes</HI> being at first surpriz'd, to be
thus attack'd, were at first under great Apprehen∣sions,
but General, Count <HI>Steinhock,</HI> one of the
<HI>Swedish</HI> Officers at the Battle of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> and who
made his Escape out of that Battle, being ap∣pointed
to Command the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army, gave
Battle to the <HI>Danes,</HI> under the Walls of <HI>Helsing∣burgh</HI>
in <HI>Schonen,</HI> and entirely defeated their
whole Army, taking all their Cannon, Baggage,
and Ammunition, and forcing the Remainder of
their Army, to embark as well as the could, on
board some <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships in the <HI>Sound,</HI> and get
over into <HI>Jutland,</HI> and to <HI>Elesnore,</HI> to save their
Lives; the <HI>Swedes</HI> kill'd in this Battle, about
3000 Men, and took near 4000 Prisoners.</P>
<P>THIS Victory deliver'd <HI>Sweden</HI> effectually,
for a time; but the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who burn'd
with an impatient Desire of Revenge, not
being equal to his Enemies, enter'd into a
Treaty with his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, to be supply'd
with 8000 Men, who were to be Convey'd to
<HI>Copenhagen</HI> by Sea.</P>
<P>IT now comes in the Event of Things, to take
Notice that the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> having, as has
been fail, built a Royal City on the <HI>Neva,</HI> and a
Fortress defending the Port, by which it was effectulaly
secur'd, so as to be able to receive and
protect any Number of the bigest Ships. His
Majesty whose Genius for the Sea Service, has
been sufficiently mentioned, resolv'd to build
<PB N="253" REF="262"/>
himself a Royal Navy; and to that Purpose,
having now made himself Master of <HI>Narva,</HI> and
<HI>Riga, Wyborg,</HI> and <HI>Revel,</HI> and other Places on that
Coast, he thereby got great Supplies of Seamen,
besides what he hir'd at other places.</P>
<P>IN a Word, such Expedition his Majesty made
in building Ships of his own, and employing also
several Persons to buy Ships of great Burthen,
in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> which he fitted up as Ships
of War; that by this Means his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
began to haVe a Fleet at Sea, as well as the <HI>Swedes</HI>
and <HI>Danes,</HI> tho' not at first of so great Ships; tho'
now he has built so many noble, large, beautiful
Men of War, that he dispises those bought Ships,
which being built generally for Merchants Busi∣ness,
and not for the War, were not so useful as
those which he built.</P>
<P>FOR the effectual Furnishing these Ships with
experienced Seamen, for managing them, his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was not dismaid with the Impos∣sibility;
he got Men for Money, in almost all Parts
of <HI>Europe:</HI> And thus his Men of War appear'd in
the <HI>Baltick</HI> in this <HI>Danish</HI> War, of which we shall
say more in its Place, sooner than could have
been imagin'd: From these Beginnings, his <HI>Czar∣ish</HI>
Majesty has raised himself to that formidable
Posture in his Marine Affairs, which we see him in at Present.</P>
<P>BY the Conversing with, and by Direction of the
foreign Seamen, which his Majesty has entertain'd
in his Pay, his own Subjects are gradually bred up
to thte Sea, and are found to be as expert in guid∣ing
the Ships, and as bold and daring in Fight,
as can be desir'd of them; and even the Men, fol∣lowing
in that, the Genius of their Sovereign, appear
pleas'd and delighted with the Service,
<PB N="254" REF="263"/>
and with Maritime Affairs; so that now his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty has many Thousand able Seamen of his
own Subjects, and will in a few Years have as
many Thousand more as he pleases.</P>
<P>TO furnish himself with Ships he had nothing
to do but to furnish himself with Builders, and
Carpenterps, having all the Materials for building
with in himself, and able to furnish all the Nati∣ons
of the World, besides: Naval Stores of all
kinds are the natural Produce of his Country,
and our East Country Merchants know very well,
that even the Royal Navies of great <HI>Britain, Hol∣land,
Frarce</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> are furnish'd with Hemp,
Flax, Timber Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k Pitch and Tar, from his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty's Dominions, and as for his Iron, which is
the only thing wanting, he has enough in his own
Country, if they please but to dig for it, and of
Copper also.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's known Diligence in
these things is such, and his Application has been
follow'd with so much Succcss, that the List of
his Fleet, as I have seen it in the latter End of the
Year 1720, was thus,
<LIST>
<ITEM>36 Ships of the Line, from 50 to 104
Guns each.</ITEM>
<ITEM>28 Frrgates, from 12 to 40 Guns each.</ITEM>
<ITEM>20 Brigantines and Sloops, from 4 to 10
Guns each.</ITEM>
<ITEM>360 Gallies for Transporting Soldiers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>120 Transport-Ships, and Ships employ'd in
fetching Timber, and Naval Materials from
<HI>Riga</HI> to <HI>Petersburg.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<Q>Besides hir'd Ships.</Q>
<P>IF this List he a true One, I refer the Reader
to any, or all the Histories in the World, to find
<PB N="255" REF="264"/>
out one Example of any Prince in the World,
who from having not one Ship, or one Sea-Port in
those Seas, did in so short time furnish out such a
Navy, and bring a Nation, who before knew little
or nothing of the Sea, and had neither Genius for
it, or Notion of it, to be Masters of the Business, ex∣pert
and able Seamen, and equal, if not Superi∣or
to all his Neighbours of the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P>IT was but three Years between his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty
having not one Ship, and a strong Navy,
not one Port in those Seas, and be Master of six
of the strongest Port Towns in the North, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>Riga, Pernau, Revel, Narva, Petersburg</HI> and <HI>Wy∣bourg.</HI></P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> as I have noted had
declared against <HI>Sweden,</HI> and had Landed an Ar∣my
in <HI>Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>honen,</HI> but was driven out again by plain
Force, and his Army entirely routed, and cut in
Peices at the great Battle of <HI>Helsingburg:</HI> This
throws him into the Arms of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty,
who was now become the general Refuge of op∣press'd
Monarrhs, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty embracing
all occasions to Support the Enemies of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
went in Person to his Assistance, where a second
Descent upon <HI>Schonen,</HI> was resolved, and his Ma∣jesty
carried such a Fleet, and such an Army to
assist in that Work, that had been more than suf∣ficient
to have reduc'd the whole Kingdom of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> rather than a Province, which attempt,
how it was laid aside, and why, and what the
Consequences of it were, we may see farther that
the relating the Story, of which in its turn.</P>
<P>BUT we must now turn our Eyes to the East
and the South, from whence new Enemies were
rais'd up by the indefatigable bustle of the King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Kio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u,</HI> of whom I took
<PB N="256" REF="265"/>
Notice, that being defeated he fled to <HI>Bender,</HI>
after the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was now come to <HI>Bender,</HI>
where the <HI>Bassa</HI> receiv'd him Civily, but would
not go any Length in protecting and succouring
him, without Orders, and therefore sent a <HI>Chioux</HI>
Express to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> for farther Instructions,
in the Affair of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> the Answer
to which, was, an express Order to shew the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> all possible Respect, to assure him of
the Protection of the <HI>Grand Senior,</HI> and to assign
him a Place to reside in, near the Town; and to
defray his Expence, and the Expence of all his
Retinue, out of the Publick Treasure; sending
at the same time, a Messenger to the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> to condole the Necessity of his Flight,
and to assure him of a powerful Protection from
the Grand <HI>Signior;</HI> with his Assistance, as far as he
was able to restore his Affairs: This was brought
at the first Enterance of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> into
the <HI>Turk</HI>'s Dominions, but the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
found Means afterwards, to put the whole <HI>Turk∣ish</HI>
Government into a Ferment, by the Means
of the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and the Platine of
<HI>Kiow</HI> above-nam'd.</P>
<P>IT seems, the Palatine was an Intimate of
the <HI>Tartar</HI> Prince, and receiv'd signal Favours
from him, upon the first News of his Misfor∣tunes,
and some time after, the Palatine took
a Journey to the Camp of the <HI>Cham,</HI> to return his
Acknowledgement, but principally to set<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on
Foot the Conferences, which afterwards produc'd
such remarkable Events.</P>
<P>AT this Interview, the Palatine firmly in∣gaged
the <HI>Tartar</HI> Prince, in the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI>
Interest; and from that Time forward, they
<PB N="257" REF="266"/>
meditated together, the proper Measures for bring∣ing
in the Port to the same Sentiments, and to
break, if possible, the Peace between the <HI>Grand
Seignior</HI> and the <HI>Czar,</HI> and bring a War upon the
<HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>THEY had Room to Insinuate the exorbitant
growing Greatness of the <HI>Czar,</HI> upon this Defeat
of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the Danger which hung
over the Head of the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire
from the encrease of Naval Power in the <HI>Black
Sea;</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> building a Royal Navy at <HI>Veronitz,</HI>
his Fortifying of <HI>Azoph,</HI> and threatening, even
the imperial City of <HI>Constantinople</HI> it self.</P>
<P>THIS with some other, and more powerful
Motives, inflam'd the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> who fail'd
not to have them represented with Advantage to
the Grand <HI>Vizier,</HI> Embarking the Bassa of <HI>Bender</HI>
also in their Interest.</P>
<P>THIS Issued in the Palatine of <HI>Kiow</HI>'s going to
<HI>Constantinople;</HI> some told us he was sent for by
the <HI>Grand Vizier;</HI> others, That he was sent as an
Envoy from the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> others, That
he was sent by the <HI>Cham,</HI> or <HI>Han</HI> of <HI>Tartary.</HI> Be
that as it will, `tis certain that they manag'd
their Affairs so artfully, that a grand <HI>Divan</HI> was
call'd at <HI>Constantinpole;</HI> the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> the
<HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> the <HI>Muffty,</HI> and the <HI>Captain Bassa,</HI>
or Admiral, were all brought into it being perswad∣ed
that assisting the <HI>Swede,</HI> and declaring against
the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> was absolutely necessary, and this
was the only Crisis, when it might be effectual∣ly
brought to pass, and when the <HI>Czar</HI> would
necessarily be reduc'd, and all the Danger ap∣prehended
from him, be avoided, and return'd
upon himself.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="267"/>
IT was about the middle of <HI>November,</HI> 1710,
when the <HI>Turks</HI> came to a Resolution, in their
great <HI>Givan</HI> at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that it was necessary
to Break with the <HI>Czar;</HI> immediately the Horse-Tail,
was set up at the Gate of the <HI>Vizier</HI>'s Pal∣lace,
and the Russian Ambassador was clapt into
Prison in the seven Towers, according to the Cu∣stom
of the <HI>Turks</HI> in such Cases.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary</HI> was, it seems, at this
<HI>Divan,</HI> and appearing to concur with the Propo∣sal
of a War, making a long Speech to the Coun∣cil
to move them to it, by setting forth the great
Growth of the <HI>Czar's</HI> Empire, the Improvement
of his Soldiery, and the Naval Preparations
which he was making, to attack the Imperial Ci∣ty
of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and to Force a Passage and
Communication with the <HI>Levant,</HI> and with the
Emperor, and the <HI>Venetians,</HI> the ancient Enemies
of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>THIS Discourse, together with his setting forth
the great Opportunity put into their Hands, upon
this Junction of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> to reduce the
Power of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and even, if needful to de∣throne
him, annimated the <HI>Turks</HI> to that Degree
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at the War was resolv'd on with the greatest
Allacrity imaginable, and the Preparations began
Immediately; for the <HI>Cham</HI> was sent Back to be∣gin
Hostilitics and order'd to make Excursions;
the Palatine of <HI>Kiou</HI> had a great Sum of Money
given him, for the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> and that
Prince was encourag'd to entertain a Body of
Troops, to be able to enter <HI>Poland,</HI> under the
Protecton of the Grand Army of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
when they should advance to the Frontiers;
and Munsieur de <HI>Kiou</HI> had 10000 Dollars given
<PB N="259" REF="268"/>
him for his own Share, and to support himself and
Friends.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was not much alarm'd at
this, his Affairs being at that Time in so good a
posture, that he was able to appear Equal in the
Field to any of his Enemies, or to all of them if
they were put together. However, his Majesty
was not backward to make the needful Prepara∣tions;
and when it appear'd that nothing was to
be done by Negotiation, he prepar'd to repel
Force by Force, and in the mean Time, caused
his Troops to march for the Frontiers, to prevent
the Ravages and Incursions of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE these Things were doing, and that
both Sides prepar'd for War, we must bring our
own Country of <HI>England</HI> into a little <HI>Demellez,</HI>
or Broil, with his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, in which there
is, however, this to be said, that her Majesty
Queen, <HI>Anne</HI> being sensible, that the Injury was
done on the Side of <HI>England,</HI> and that the <HI>Czar</HI>
had Justice on his Side, nothing was omitted that
could reasonably be done, to give his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty
Satisfaction; the Case was about an Affront
put on the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Ambassadour, by some Tradesmen
here, who very rashly, and without considering
as they ought to have done, the publick Character
he carryed, Arrested Monsieur <HI>Matteuoff,</HI> the <HI>Russian</HI>
Ambassador, and insulted him very rudely, also
detaining him in Custody for some Time.</P>
<P>THIS we must not over-look; the Story is thus,
Monsieur <HI>Andrew Matteuoff,</HI> was Embassador
Resident to her Majesty the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
from the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy:</HI> Upon some Occasion
or other, he was Arrested, as above, by some private
Persons; who finding his Excellency had had
Audience of Leave of the Queen, and was going
<PB N="260" REF="269"/>
away; and imagining, or pretending to imagine,
he would leave the Kingdom, as it were in Cog∣nito,
without paying a few Debts which he ow'd;
imploy'd some Bayliffs to Arrest him; the Am∣bassador
justly surpris'd at this Treatment, in
Relation to the Laws of Nations; and perhaps
not so readily submitting to the stop, was very
roughly handled by those sort <HI>Canibals:</HI> Upon
which, he made Application for Redress to her
Majesty, and her Council, who immediately
took Care to confine those Fellows, who had
thus, in Contempt of Authority, put this Affront
upon him. There were various Stories which
flew about, in Reference to the Particulars of
Reparation insisted on, by his Excellency, which
I shall not trouble my self to repeat. But in
short, his Excellency, at last, seem'd to be a lit∣tle
satisfy'd; and her Majesty, even after his De∣parture,
order'd her Attorney-General, a little
before the Beginning of that <HI>Micaelmas</HI> Term, to
prosecute those who had been guilty in that Par∣ticular,
in the <HI>Queen's-Bench</HI> Court. That this
was all that could be done, was certain; but
how little the <HI>Russian</HI> Ambassador was satisfy'd
with it, will appear by the following Letters,
which pass'd between Mr. <HI>Henry Boyle,</HI> now Lord
<HI>Charleton,</HI> then Secretary of State, and the said
Monsieur <HI>Mattueoff,</HI> who was retir'd to <HI>Holland;</HI>
and by which the whole of the first Part of that
tedious Story may be fully understood; the first
Letter was from, the Ambassadour to the Secreta∣ry,
as follows.</P>

<P>“HAVING observ'd (ever since I had the ho∣nour

<P>“THE matter of Fact speaks of it self, and I
shall only say in short, that the Bailiff of that

a scandalous House, without notifying to me the
Reason, and to abuse me, by thrusting himself
into my Coach, and seizing on my Person, af∣ter
taking away my Sword, Hat and Cane, as
it were from a Malefactor; not only contrary
to the Law of Nations, but even the Right of
all private Persons, the immunity of Ambassa∣dors,

<P>ACCORDINGLY, as I had the Honour to tell your

the great Affront that was put upon you, I have us'd
my utmost Endeavours with all the Zeal I Profess
for your Excellency's Person, and Character, to find
out the most effectual Means for causing a due Repara∣tion
to be made you; as soon as I arriv'd at <HI>Wind∣sor,</HI>
I inform'd the Queen of the Outrage committed
against your Excellency, and her Majesty order'd me to
assure you, that she is extreamly Concern'd upon account
of that enormous Procedure, and highly displeas'd with
Her Subjects who were the Authors of it; and for as
much as the Queen has all the Respect imaginable for
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, whose Friendship and good Cor∣respondence
have been at all Times, and ever will be
most Dear and Precious to Her; and in Regard that
she has a very peculiar Esteem for your Excellency's
Person and Merit, she will omit nothing that lyes in Her
Power, to give an ample Satisfaction for the extraordi∣nary
affront which has been put upon your Excellency;
and to shew her own Resentments on <HI>Sunday</HI> last, an extraordinary Assembly of her Majesty's Privy-Coun∣cil
was call'd at <HI>Windsor,</HI> and seven of the Princi∣pal
Accomplices in that desperate Attempt were ta∣ken

is to meet again about that Affair, as soon as possible,

<P>“I HAVE sent to your Excellency this Morn∣ing

<HEAD>A Translation of a Letter, written in Latin, by
His Sacred Czarish Majesty, to the Most Serene
Queen of Great Britain.</HEAD>
<Q>(After both Titles, at large)</Q>
<P>WE, cannot forbear notifying to your Majesty, with
how great Trouble of Mind and horror, by the
humble Remonstrances of <HI>Andrew de Matteuoff,</HI> our
Ambassador at your Court, Charg'd with several im∣portant
Commissions; me have receiv'd an unexpected
Peice of News, <HI>viz.</HI> That the said Ambassador,
after having obtain'd an Audience of Leave of your
Majesty, at <HI>London,</HI> the Place of your Residence;
out of premeditated Malice, and of set Purpose, (as
<PB N="269" REF="278"/>
it appears) was set upon in the open Street, by several
Bailiffs, who receiv'd their Commission from a certain
Viscount or Sheriff, and acted like Robbers against
the Publick Laws of Nations, with an unheard of,
and unparallell'd Barbarity: For by Dispersing his
Servants, violently breaking his Coach, taking away
his Sword, Cane and Hat, and tearing his Cloaths;
put, upon him such a notorious Affront as no civil∣liz'd
Person would presume to offer to a foreign Mini∣ster
of his Character; nor even to a Commoner, unless
he would run the Risque of being Most severely pu∣nish'd:
And what most of all inhances the Heinous∣ness
of the Fact, while our said Ambassador, crying
out for Help, against the Outrage and Robbery, had
got together some Persons, who intended to rescue
him out of the Hands of the Pillagers; and when
they, for that Purpose, bad stopp'd the Coach, and
being desirous to know the Cause, brought him into
the next Victualling House, the audacious Miscreants,
produc'd a Warrant to detain the said Ambassador,
for the Sum of 50 l. Sterling, due from him, to cer∣tain
Merchants: And when the People, who ran
together, began to separate again, upon the Discovery
of the Matter; they forthwith hurry'd him into a
Hackney Coach, taken by Force, and delivered him
up to be confin'd in a certain Infamous House, call'd
the <HI>Black Raven</HI> and altho', our said Ambassa∣dor,
had notify'd this unheard of, and flagitious Out∣rage,
to the Secretary of State, nevertheless, he could
not be found; and Secretary <HI>Walpole,</HI> only came
to the House, not to set him at Liberty, (as most
evidently appears) but to be an Eye Witness of this
Usage; the like of which, was never seen under the
Sun; neither did he offer any Assistance to our Am∣bassadour,
as a Person skill'd in the publick Law of
Nations, which Protects the Character of an Ainbassa∣dor
<PB N="270" REF="279"/>
from all manner of Insults, but went away: So
that our said Ambassador being destitute of all Help,
and forsaken, was forced to Redeem himself, from
the House of Bondage; and after a long Space of
Time, to procure his Liberty.</P>
<P>Forasmuch, then, as our Majesty is apparently
assaulted, by thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wicked Attempt and Indignity, put
upon the Person of our Ambassadour, such as was
never practised nor even heard of in the whole World;
much less among civiliz'd People; not only profain∣ing,
but quite subverting the Law of Nations.
Therefore hoping that your Royal Majesty will have
due Regard, to the grievous Affront offer'd to us, in
the Person of our Ambassador, together with the In∣fringement
of the Law of Nations, occasion'd primal∣ly
by the Sheriff, as the Author of the whole Mis∣chief,
inasmuch, as the said Sheriff countenanc'd so
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndacious an attempt, and look'd upon the detaining
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Ambassadour, as a Tri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le. And, secondly, by the
Bailiff who presum'd to abuse our said Ambassador
in the open Street, after the above-mention'd Manner.
And lastly, by the Merchants, who occasion'd his
Confinement, (as is evident from their malevolent
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stigation, in order to overthrow the ancient Friend∣ship
establish'd with us and our Empire) wherefore,
we being pers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aded, that your Majesty will esteem

The same Ambassador, by Vertue of the In∣structions
given him, on this Subject, will more
largely explain our Request to your Majesty, which
has been already declar'd, by our Ministers, to your
Majesty's Resident in our Court; on those Conside∣rations
we have Reason to hope, from your Majesty's
justice, such a Satisfaction for this Intolerable Out∣rage;
and the rather in regard that your Majesty's
Honour, and Reputation of all your Subjects of
Great Britain, will by this Means become famous
throughout the whole World; and we shall be certain∣ly
assur'd of the Continuance of your Royal Friend∣ship,
and all Effects of a contrary Opinion, will be
entirely remov'd: And least, upon Failure of a Satis∣faction
worthy of, and equivolant to our injur'd
Honour, we be compell'd to obtain it by way of Repri∣sal;
which, indeed, would be very irksome to us, upon
Account of that particular Esteem, we have for your
Majesty's Friendship. Finally, We wish your Majesty

<HEAD>To the Ambassadors Letter, Mr. Secretary
Boyle return'd the following Answer.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I Did not think Fit to return a Speedy An∣wer,
to the two Letters of the 27th of
<HI>November,</HI> and 4th of <HI>December</HI> last, <HI>N. S.</HI> with
which your Excellency was pleas'd to Honour
me; because I could not inform you, what Sa∣tisfacton
our Laws would afford, against those
who put that grievous Affront upon your Excel∣lency's
Person: But forasmuch, as-I am appre∣hensive
that too long a Silence, may be taken for
want of due Respect for your Excellency; or,
that I have net been sufficiently solicitous to put
in Execution, every thing that is incumbent
upon the Queen's Majesty, in order to procure
the promis'd Reparation: I could no longer for∣bear
making Answer to your Excellency, to
assure you, that the Resentment you express of
the outragious Affront, particularly in your
Letter, of the 27th of <HI>November</HI> ult. Cannot
be greater, than the Indignation which her Majesty
has conceiv'd upon that Account; and I
doubt not, but Mr. <HI>de Ayrolle,</HI> according to the
Inructions he receiv'd, has already notify'd to
your Excellency, that the indispensable Forms
of the Laws of this Kingdom, cannot admit of a
final Determination of that Affair, till the
next Sessions of our Court of Judicature, which
is so well known, and so firmly regulated here,
that in order to punish any Malefactor, for the
most enormous Crimes, even Treason against
<PB N="273" REF="282"/>
her Majesty's Sacred Person, he must be brought
to his Tryal, according to usual Forms establish'd
in this Country: I am perswaded that
your Excellency's Sagasity and Equitableness,
will distinguish between the Insolence and Bru∣tishness
of some particular sensless Men, and the
Marks of a very particular Esteem and Respect,
which you have receiv'd upon all Occasions,
as well from the Queen, as from Persons em∣ploy'd
in the highest Offices of the Govern∣ment:
And that your Excellency will be so
Just, as to believe, that they would not have
failed to give you the most ample Satisfaction,
long ago, if the Means of doing it were as rea∣dy
at Hand, and Practicable, as the Queen's
inclination is forward to satisfy his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty thereupon: Therefore I hope your Excel∣lency,
will represent the State of this Affair,
to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, after the most favoura∣ble
Manner, assuring him, that nothing has been
neglected by, and that nothing for the Future,
shall be omitted, which tends to procure all the
Reparation the utmost rigour of the funda∣mental
Laws of this Kingdom can afford. And
farther, if this be not found sufficient, and any
thing can be suggested, that is in the Queen's
Power, whereby the may express her high Dis∣pleasure
against those who committed so notorious
an insult, which may contribute to the
maintaining of Amity and good Correspondence
between her and his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, she will
not fail on her Part, to be always ready to do
it; upon that Account, I lately proposed, by
the Queen's special Order to the Parliament of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> that a Bill might be brought in,
<PB N="274" REF="283"/>
for establishing, and securing the Privileges of
Ambassadors and other foreign Ministers, as well
to prevent the like Outrages for the future, as to
notify, at the same Time, to the whole World,
how far her Majesty, and the whole <HI>British</HI> Na∣tion
detest the Violence that was offer'd to your
Excellency's Person and Character, but for as
much, as her Majesty, is desirous of nothing
more, than to be in a Capacity of giving
Satisfaction in that Affair and she is abso∣lutely
disposed to do all that lies in her
Power for that Purpose, we are perswaded,
that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty will not forbear ha∣ving
so just a Regard to the Queen's Friendship,
and the ancient Alliancies, between the
two Crowns, that he will not insist upon her
attempting Impossibilities; and that he will
not undertake any thing, which may in any
wife be prejudicial to the good Correspondence
that has been hitherto maintain'd between
both their Majesty's, and which, as I hope
will continue for ever. I have the Satisfaction
to inform your Excellency, that the Queen
had no sooner Notice, that two young <HI>Mus∣covite</HI>
princes, the Relations of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty,
were arrived in this Kingdom, but she
forthwith gave Orders for their Reception
and Entertainment, with that particular Di∣stinction,
and Respect, which is due to their
high Birth. As for what Concerns my
self have, in executing the Queen's Orders
on this Emergency, I shall discharge my
Duty with a great deal of Delight: And I
can assure your Excellency, at that time, that
no Person in the World can be more for∣ward

which shall offer themselves, with

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour to receive your Letter, dated
from White-hall, the 11th Instant, O. S. and I
find therein many Declartions and Promises for the
future, as to what relates to the Reparation to the un∣paralell'd
Assault made upon me by the Rabble, which
Promises are directed to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty my Ma∣ster,
on the part of the Queen of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> but
for the rest, all that I can observe most considerable,
is the Proposal you have tendered to the Parliament of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> by the Queen's Instructions, in order
to get a Law enacted for the Security, and Mainte∣nance
of the Sacred Privileges of Ambassadors, and
other foreign Ministers, residing in her Majesty's Courts;
indeed this is a very proper Means to dissipate the Fears
which they were seized with, since the Insult that was
made, on a Minister of the first Rank, however, give me
<PB N="276" REF="285"/>
leave to tell you farther, that nothing carries less Ap∣pearance
of the Satisfaction which his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty
requires, since the definitive Resolution is still want∣ing
and is referr'd to the particular Laws of the
Country, so that the Business is protracted by putting
it off from Time to Time, and from one Delay to a∣nother:
If it were in the Queen's Power to consult the
Parliament about enacting of a new Law, touching the
immunity of foreign Ministers, and to prevent the Out∣rages
which might be hereafter offer'd to them, could
not due Measures have been taken at the same time,
for the Reparation of the pass'd Affront, which ac∣cording
to your Letter is detested by the, Queen, and
the whole <HI>British Nation:</HI> Certainly, it is a very ea∣sy
Matter to do it, in Case her Majesty has the least
Inclination to bold an amicable Correspendence with
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, as his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty is dis∣posed
to do with her, and to maintain the Law of
Nations in its Vigour, as the whole Universe does;
which ought to be the rather to be expected from the
Queen, since she has formerly Contributed very much
to the Preservation of the same, by firmly demand∣ing
of the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> for an affront
offer'd to the Earl of Manchester her Ambassador,
altho' the Insult was only made upon his Barks
and domestick Servants; so that the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nate, not∣withstanding
the most ancient Laws of the Re∣publick,
was prevailed upon to follow the Law of
Nations, by satisfying the Ambassador, after the
manner he desir'd and demanded. Sir, You desire
by the same Letter, that I should acquaint his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty with the delay of your Courts of Judicature,
which binders this Affair; from being brought to an
Issue, altho' it might have been very conveniently ad∣justed
in the Space of six Months, since which Time
the Accident happen'd. But forasmuch as your Let∣ter
<PB N="277" REF="286"/>
contains nothing definitive, with Respect to the Sa∣tisfaction.
I am extreamly concern'd, that it is not in
my Power to comply with your Desires in that Particu∣lar,
and I am so much the more uncapable of doing it,
in regard that I have receiv'd his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
positive Resolution upon the Busines; as also, later
Orders, earnestly to press for the Qneen's Answer
to my Master's Letter, and a Categorical Determi∣nation,
whether the Law of Nation, with Respect
to foreign Powers, will be observ'd or not? There∣fore,
pursuant to the said Orders, which I have
newly receiv'd, I would entreat you, Sir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to honour
me with an Answer to the above-mention'd Articles,
after you have shewn the Contents to the Queen; to
the End that this Affair may be no longer deserr'd,
for the Delay occasion'd by your Laws, cannot give
any manner of satisfaction to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty,
As to the Honours that have been lately done, by the
Queen's special Command, to the two yomng Noble
Men, who are taken for <HI>Muscovite Princes,</HI> related
to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, and are now at <HI>London;</HI>
I can assure you, that his Majesty reckons none but the
Imperial Hereditary Prince within the Virge of his
august House: They are two young Lords of illustru∣ous
Birth, who have the Honour of being a Kin to
him, and are Travelling, <HI>incognito,</HI> to see the
World. But his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty does not desire that
they should be defray'd by any Power, they have
where withal to bear their own Charges, and if with∣out
their Master's Orders, they think fit to accept of
Lodgings, or any thing else of that Nature, they are
to be accountable for t be same. It only remains, that
I return Thanks for the Kindness and Good Will you
profess to have for me, of the future Continuance of

for the issue of the Queen's efforts in
prosecuting the Criminals, since her Majesty has

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“FOR as much as Mr. <HI>D' Ayrole,</HI> has had Or∣ders
from time to time, to notifie to your
Excellency, what has happen'd with Respect to
the Trial of those Persons, who put the Out∣ragious
Affront upon your Excellency; I look'd
upon it as needless to trouble your Excellency
with any Letters about that Affair; but since
I perceive by the Honour of your last, that you
press for an Answer to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Let∣ter,
with a great deal of earnestness, I can no long∣er
exempt my self from acquainting-your Excel∣lency,
that the Queen on her Side is very desirous
of being in a capacity to Answer the said Let∣ter,
after such a manner as is Requisite; but
for as much as the Tryal cannot be brought to
a Conclusion, by Reason of the indispenable
Formalities of our Laws; it is evident that an
Answer must needs be imperfect before a final
Determination of this Case; this is the only
Reason, for which it has been judged expedi∣ent
to defer the Answer, and I doubt not but
your Excellency will do so much Justice to the
Queen, as to make convenient Excuses there∣upon,
to the End that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty may be
certified, that this stop put to the Business, does
not proceed from any affected procrastination,
but from an insuperable Necessity, and I ought
to assure your Excellency, that when the said
Cause comes to be determined, her Majesty will
not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ail to Answer his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Letters,
in such Terms as that he will clearly perceive
the Queen is Solicitous of nothing more, then
to give the most ample Satisfaction which can
<PB N="283" REF="292"/>
be made for the said Indignity; I likewise do
myself the Honour to inform your Excellency,
that the Bill for maintaining the Privileges of
Ambassadors is ready to pass into the House of
Lords; so that in a short time the Queen will
give the Royal Assent thereto, and thus your
Excellency will see how much the <HI>British</HI> Nation
is concern'd at what has so unfortunately befal∣len
you, since it is therein express'd at large, that
the said Outrage was the only Motive which in∣duc'd
them to make such an Act; and further, I
cannot forbear acquainting your Excellency, that
for as much as the 2 <HI>Muscovite</HI> Princes have lately
signified that this Business obliges them to pass
over into <HI>Holland;</HI> the Queen who has conferred
extraordinary Favours upon them, by Reason
of the Honour they had in being nearly related
to the <HI>August</HI> House of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, has
given them to understand, that they are at full
Liberty to set out on their Voyage, when, and
in what manner they shall Judge most expedi∣ent;
and that her Majesty will endeavour to
make their Departure as agreeable, as she has
hitherto made their Residence in these Parts
easy, and delightful: I have often assur'd your
Excellency of my particular Inclination to your
Service, that it were needless to add any thing
more, but a Repetition of the Esteem and Re∣spect
with which I have the Honour to be.”</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have defer'd 'till now, the returning an Answer
to the Letter with which you honoured me, dated
29th of <HI>March, O. S.</HI> because, my Lord, Duke of
<HI>Marlborough,</HI> and the Secretary of the Queen of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> Mr. <HI>d' Ayroll,</HI> had several Times as∣sur'd
me, they were ready to bring to pass the just
Reparation, that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, my Master,
requires of the unheard of Insult made upon me, and
the Satisfaction due to my Honour, and the great
Damages I have sustain'd; waited for the Issue
thereof, with so much the greater Complacency, in
regard, that by your Letter, you confirm'd to me
the same Assurance, of the sincere Intention, and
particular Care taken for that Purpose. But, for
as much, as the Letters from <HI>England,</HI> of the 17th.
Instant, <HI>O. S.</HI> do not express, that from the 11th,
which was the Beginning of the <HI>Term,</HI> to the said
13th Day any Progress has been made in the
Courts of Judicature, in order to obtain the Sen∣tence
which ought to be pronounced against those
Wret<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bes, who assaulted me; nor even that the Af∣fair
has been debated; it appears to me, that the
application of the Court, does not concur so much
as the sincere friendship betwixt his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
and the Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> requires, in order
to put an End to those Delays, and Means of demur∣ing
which have caused the Business to be protracted,
for the Space of almost a whole Year: And there∣fore,
<PB N="285" REF="294"/>
not seeing at this very Instant, any apparent
Effects of the fair Promises which have<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>been made
to me, and finding my self oblig'd to obey the Orders
I receiv'd from his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty; again, once
more to demand, whether it be the Queens Pleasure, to
give Satisfaction proportionable to the Outragiousness
of the Affront, such as his Majesty, my Master, re∣quires,
and to answer his Letter; I would also in∣treat
you to send me an answer in Writing, which I
impatiently expect, to the End that I may send it to
the Court, conformable to my Orders. As to the no∣tifying
the Act newly made, upon the Occasion of the
late Assault, upon my Person, for maintaining the
Privileges of Ambassadors, of which Act Mr. <HI>d Ay∣roll</HI>
afterwards deliver'd a Copy to me, by your Or∣der,
I do my self the Honour to tell you, that it con∣tributes
not, in any wise, to the Satisfaction now in
Debate; because, the sacred Characters of Ambassa∣dors
have been in all Ages, accounted inviolable among
the <HI>Christan</HI> Powers, before that Declaration; which
being but a particular Law, can only serve to justify
the Honour of the Nation, and prevent for the Fu∣ture,
all Inconveniencies which may happen to foreign
Ministers in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as well as to those of
your Crown, in other Courts: 'Tis very much against
my will, that my Name is Celebrated in such a Man∣ner
in your Constitution, and that the Example is
transmitted to P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sterity; whereas, there being no∣thing
Blame worthy in my Conduct, during my Re∣i|dence
in <HI>London;</HI> I had Reason to hope, I should not
be thus exposed to the deadly Affront, put upon the
Character of an Ambassador, with which I am
invested. For the rest, being perswaded of your par∣ticular
Friendship, and that you are desirous to give
me farther Marks thereof, upon this Occasion, I
would have you to believe, that I am, as I formerly

<P>AFTER this Mr. <HI>Mat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ueoff</HI> sent over a Letter
from the <HI>Czar</HI> himself, to her <HI>Britanick</HI> Majesty,
wherein he express'd in very Warm, but respect∣ful
Terms, his Resentment of the Treatment of
his Ambassador, and that he expected such Repa∣ration,
as was suitable to the Indignity he had
received.</P>
<P>ALL these Writings to, and again, having
brought this Affair to no Conclusion, it was re∣solved
on both Sides, at last, that the Queen
should send a solemn Embassy to the <HI>Czar</HI> to his
Court at <HI>Moscow,</HI> to make an Acknowledgment
for the Affront, and to desire his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
to be pacify'd, and to take this, for a Testimony
of her Majesty's great Desire to give him ample
Satisfaction upon that Occasion, and indeed, it
was a great Testimony of it.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, Mr. <HI>Whitworth</HI> was sent by
her Majesty to <HI>Moscow,</HI> what he did, and how
this Matter was ended, in a manner very honou∣rably

<HEAD>A RELATION of what past at Moscow,
on the 16th of February, N. S. 1710. the Day
his Majesty, Peter, Emperor of Great Russia,
admitted to publick Audience, his Excellency Mr.
Charles Whitworth, formerly Envoy Extraordi∣nary
of her Majesty, Anne Queen of Great Bri∣tain;
and since, vested with the Character of her
Ambassador Extraordinary, Commissioner and Ple∣nepotentionary,
expresly and purposely to make so∣lemn
Excuses in her Name, for the insult done at
London, the first of August, N. S. 1708. to his
Excellency, Mr. Andrew Artemonides de Ma∣tueoff,
Minister of State, Governor of the Dutchy
of Jaroslaw, and at that Time, Ambassador Ex∣traordinary
of his Czarish Majesty, at the Court
of her Britannick Majesty. To which are added,
the Articles stipulated in the Conference between
the Minister of the Czar, and the same Ambassa∣dor
of the Queen.</HEAD>
<P>THE 8th of <HI>February,</HI> being appoint∣ed
for the Solemnity, Monsieur <HI>Basilis
de Salticof,</HI> Chief Carver to his <HI>Czar∣ish</HI>
Majesty, accompany'd by Mon∣sieur
<HI>Athanasius de Dmitreemomonof,</HI>
Cup-Bearer, who officiated as Master of the Cere∣monies,
went from the Court in one of his <HI>Czar∣ish</HI>
Majesty's Coaches, to the House of her <HI>Brita∣nick</HI>
Majesty's Ambassador, being follow'd by
twenty other Coaches, of the Grandees, and
Principal Lords of the Court, some, only to
make up a Train for Show; and others, for
<PB N="288" REF="297"/>
the Ambassador's Secretary and Gentlemen, who
were all richly Cloath'd, answerable to the
Coaches in which they Rode.</P>
<P>BEING come to the Ambassadors House, the
Carver, and Cup-Bearer, went up to his Appart∣ment,
where they declared to his Excellency, the
Business they were come about, and after some
Moments Conversation, they went into the
Coach with the Ambassador, who took the Place
of Honour; the Chief Carver sat by his Side,
and the Cup Bearer against him; the Secretary,
and Centlemen of the Embassy, went in the
Coaches appointed for them, each according to
his Rank, and the Train being encreased by the
Ambassador's Coaches, proceeded to the Court.</P>
<P>ARIVING there, the two Regiments of Guards
<HI>Preobrazenski</HI> and <HI>Semionasski,</HI> who were drawn
up within the Court, made the Salutes of Honour
to the Ambassador according to Custom, and re∣main'd
standing in Parade During the whole
Audience; making a very fine Shew, the Rich∣ness
of their Cloaths, and the neatness of their
Arms and Accoutrements setting off the comely
Men, of which those Regiments are compos'd;
the Officers at their Head made the most Splendid
Appearance that can be imagin'd; and the whole
Extent of the Court, as large as 'tis, could hard∣ly
afford them Room enough.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Narichkin,</HI> Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber,
to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, received the
Ambassador at the Foot of the Stair-Case, where
his Excellency came out of the Coach, and com∣plimented
him; Prince <HI>George de Scherhaty,</HI> Coun∣sellor
of State perform'd the same Honours to him
at the Top of the Stair-Case; and Monsieur <HI>de
Mussinpuchkin,</HI> Privy-Counsellor, complimented
<PB N="289" REF="298"/>
him in the Anti-Chamber, and the Ambassador
was conducted according to the Cerimonial, to the
Hall of Audience, where his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was
standing, uncover'd, under a Canopy, leaning
against a Table, having an arm'd Chair behind
him, the Grandees, and Ministers of the Court,
with the Generals of his Armies standing on each
Hand of him.</P>
<P>AS soon as the Ambassador came in Sight of
him, he made his first Obeisance, in the Middle
of the Hall, his second, and the third when he
had ascended the Estrade on which his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty stood; where standing, and with his Hat
off, his Excellency made a Speech in <HI>English,</HI> of
which the Secretary read aloud, a Translation in
the <HI>German</HI> Tongue, sign'd with the Ambassador's
Hand, to the End, the foreign Ministers, who
had been formally Invited to assist at this Solem∣nity,
might understand the Contents of it; and
then one of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Secretaries read
it out in the <HI>Russian</HI> Language, for the Information
of the Lords and Gentlemen of the Empire; the
Speech was as follows,</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Most High, and most Powerful Emperor.</OPENER>
<P>“'TIS not without a very sensible Grief,
that I am oblig'd to mention to your
Majesty, the Affront which was offer'd to your
Ambassador, in <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and I should be
much more concern'd at it, were I not furnish'd
with express Orders, and full Power, to de∣clare,
with how great Diligence, her Maje∣sty,
the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> my most gracious
Mistress, has endeavour'd to give sufficient
Satisfaction for it, proportion'd, as well to her
<PB N="290" REF="299"/>
Equity, as to her Greatness of Soul; and such,
as may serve, as an evident Mark of her con∣stant
Friendship, which she has always had for
your Imperial Majesty, and which her Ma∣jesty,
is desirous inviolably to continue to
you.”</P>
<P>“THE first Advice of that unfortunate Acci∣dent,
was no sooner brought to Court, but the
Guilty were made sensible of her Royal Indig∣nation;
they were immediately arrested; they
were examin'd before the Queen, in her Coun∣cil;
they were imprison'd, and prosecuted with
the utmost Severity of our Laws: And tho'
these were found not to be extensive enough,
yet, they were declared infamous, by the Con∣sent
of the whole Nation, assembled in Parlia∣ment,
who declar'd to the whole World, by a
publick Act, how much they abhor'd the Indig∣nity
of the Fact, and took necessary Precau∣tions
to prevent the like Insolencies for the
Future. Neither did they stop there, for those
Criminals, were afterwards declared unworthy
any Favour or Protection, and excluded from
the General Pardon, which her Majesty, the
Queen, caused to be publish'd, for all her
Subjects; even, for those, who had in a most
inormous manner, attempted against her sacred
Person; and tho' other Criminals do actually
Enjoy that Benefit, those are still under her
Majesty's high Displeasure.”</P>
<P>“AND to the End, that her Royal Equity
and Amity may reach farther, and become the
more shining in the World, her Majesty, has
graciously been pleas'd to honour me with
the Charracter of her Ambassador Extraordina∣ry,
Commissary, and Plenipotentiary, and to

give me the Power, to represent her Royal Per∣son,
as if her self were here present, in the first
Place to testify the Sorrow, and the just and
high Abhorrence she has for that rash Deed per∣petrated
against a Publick Minister, especially,
against such a one as her Majesty the Queen, has
a most particular Esteem for; and afterwards,
to beg Excuse for the Defect, and Insufficiency
of our ancient Constitution, in the Case of so
extraordinary a Violation of the Law of Nati∣ons;
for which, the Criminals should with
Justice have been punished with the utmost Ri∣gour,
according to your Imperial Majesty's De∣sire:
And in the last place, to assure your Ma∣jesty,
in the most sincere manner, how much
her Majesty, the Queen, is inclin'd to maintain
the ancient Friendship, and good Corespondence,
which for so long a Time, have been between
the two Crowns: Of which your Imperial Ma∣jesty,
may please to take further Notice, in this
her Letter, which is a Testimony of the great
Affection, and high Esteem, her Majesty the
Queen, has for your Imperial Majesty.”</P>
<P>“WHEREFORE, I most instantly desire, in the
Name of her Majesty, the Queen, that your
Imperial Majesty, may vouchsafe to accept the
aforesaid Excuse, with the usual fraternal Af∣fection,
and not to impute either to her Maje∣sty,
the Queen, or the <HI>British</HI> Nation, and Action
of which, some disorderly Persons are the Au∣thors:
But that entirely putting the same in
Oblivion, your Imperial Majesty may again
generously continue you high Affection to the

most happy, if I may any way contribute to
so great a Work, so advantagious to both the

<P>“SEVERAL great Benefits and Marks of Fa∣vour,
which I have already receiv'd, during the
Discharge of my former Employment, of which,
I shall ever retain a thankful Remembrance,
makes me hope for the same favourable Recep∣tion,
during the Remainder of my Stay here,
in the Exercise of my new Commission, as
often as I shall have the Honour to make any

to your Imperial Majesty's high Protection,
with Respect to the Free Trade, which their

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="293" REF="302"/>
<HEAD>(After the usual Titles on both Sides.)</HEAD>
<P>WE have already written to your Imperial Majesty,
to declare to you, the Grief we conceiv'd, for
the unhappy Affront which was offer'd to your Am∣bassadour
before he left our Court: We have since re∣ceiv'd
the Letter which your Imperial Majesty wrote
to us, and we can assure your Imperial Majesty, that
we were touch'd with true Sorrow, when we saw how
highly you resented the Violence which had been offer'd
to your Imperial Majesty's own Person, in the Cha∣racter
of your Ambassador, and we were the more
griev'd on this Occasion, when we reflected on the insuf∣ficiency
of our Laws, to give as ample a Satisfaction as
we desire to make, as well for the just Sense, We our
Self had, of the Indignity which had been offer'd, as
to Convince your Imperial Majesty, how much we were
Inclin'd to make a suitable Reparation, for the Inju∣ry
done so good a Friend and Ally; but we must con∣fess,
that at the same Time, we had a singular Pleasure,
in observing your Imperial Majesty's desire, to pre∣vent
the Misunderstanding that might arise there∣from;
and the great Esteem you shew'd for our
Friendship; as well as the Care you Express'd, to pre∣serve
and cultivate it by Reciprocal marks of Friend∣ship
and Affection.</P>
<P>Wherefore, we promise our self, from your Good∣ness,
that upon the Representations, which, from
Time to Time have been made to you, in our Name,
by our Envoy Extraordinary, at your Imperial Court,
your Imperial Majesty will be pleased, to examine in∣to
the Nature of this Affair; where your Imperial
Majesty, will not see the least Inclination, to favour
the Criminals, nor to screen them from Justice.
But that there are insuperable Difficulties, with Re∣spect
<PB N="294" REF="303"/>
to the ancient and fundamental Laws of the
Government of our People; which we fear, do not
permit so severe and rigorous a Sentence to be given,
as your Imperial Majesty, at first, seem'd to expect▪
in this Case; and we perswade our self, that your
Imperial Majesty, who are a Prince Equally famous
for Clemency, aud exact Justice, will not require us,
who are the Gaurdian and Protectress of the Laws,
to inflict a Punishment upon our Subjects, which the
Laws do not impower us to do.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, we have not been wanting, at the
same Time, to use all the Means, which we judg'd
most effectual, to perswade your Majesty, and the
whole World, of the Sincerity of our Intentions, and
of our Endeavours in this Affair; and to the End
the guilty might be Punish'd, so far, as the Laws and
Constitutions of our Kingdoms, which were then in
Force, would permit; we gave express, and re∣peated
Orders to our Officers of Justice, and to
our Ministers, to prosecute them with the uttermost
severity.</P>
<P>That Prosecution has been long continu'd with ve∣ry
great Diligence, and nothing has been omitted, to
bring it to as speedy a Conclusion as possible: But
after all▪ the Matter is such, that we find our self
oblig'd, to inform your Imperial Majesty, that as
well, because of the different Pleadings, in Favour
of the Criminals, the slow, but indispersable Manner
of proceeding in a Law Suit of so great Importance;
as of the Case it self, which is of an extraordinary
Nature, against which, no sufficient Provision is
made; in the ancient Statutes of these Kingdoms: It
has not been in the Power of our Council Learned in
the Law yet to obtain a Sentence, nor a final Decission
in this Affair.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="304"/>
Wherefore, considering all these Inconveniencies,
and foreseeing the Delays which might probably hap∣pen,
in the ordinary Course of Law, and desiring,
at the same Time, to give you signal Marks of our
Sorrow; as also to shew you the Indignation of all
our Subjects on this Occasion, we have pass'd an Act
of Parliament made in the most solemn manner, by
the Council, and Assembly of our Kingdom of <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> wherein is made a Declaration as Authen∣tick
as possible, of the just Horror which our Sub∣jects
in general have against this violent Insult, and
all the Acts and Proceedings which relate to the Ar∣rest
of the Person of your imperial Majesty's Ambas∣sadour,
are annul'd, and raz'd out of the Registers of
our Courts of Justice; and those who had a Share
therein,
are branded as infamous Criminals, and ob∣noctious
to the Laws, which were then in Force; and
if any Person hereafter, durst commit the like Offence,
or any ways violate the Privileges of Ambassadors
and other foreign Ministers, they will be lyable to
the most severe Penalties and Punishments, which the
arbitrary Power of the Judges, shall think fit to inflict
upon them, and to which no bounds are given, in this
new Act; so that all Insults of this Nature, will be
prevented for the Future, and the Security, which
all Prince's Ministers ought to enjoy, will be firmly
establish'd and preserv'd by this famous Law; And
this will remain as a Monument to all Posterity; as
a Defference, which has been shewn to your Imperial
Majesty: And all the Ministers, which shall come for
the Future, will be indebted for this extraordinary
Act for their Protection, to the particular Considera∣tion
which we, and our People have had for your Im∣perial
Majesty's Honour: Therefore, your Imperial
Majesty cannot but see, that we have used our utmost
Endeavours in prosecuting the Criminals, and in
<PB N="296" REF="305"/>
causing them to be punished, tho' not with the Suc∣cess
we could have wished; and since we have pro∣cur'd
an Act to be made by the Representative of all
our Subjects of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as well for Repara∣tion
of what has been done, as to prevent the like
Insolence sor the Future, we instantly pray your Impe∣rial
Majesty, to accept of all that we have done on
our Side, as the most we could do here, for your Sa∣tisfaction;
whereby your Imperial Majesty will give us
the strongest Proof that can be of your Affection
towards us, and you may be assured that we shall
not fail on our Side to do all that lies in our Power,
on all Occasions, to shew you our Gratitude, by our
firm Friendship and Esteem.</P>
<P>And to the End, that nothing may be omitted,
which is in our Power, to do farther, by way of
suitable Reparation, we thought fit to make Choice of
some worthy and able Person to declare to your Im∣perial
Majesty, in the most publick and solemn Man∣ner
the Indignation we conceiv'd at the Affront
offer'd, and our Concern that it is not in our Power
to cause the Criminals to be punish'd according to
their Deserts: And as our trusty and well beloved,
Mr. <HI>Charles Whitworth,</HI> has merited our Royal
Approbation, by his Ability and Experience in all
the Affairs which have been entrusted with him, as
also, by his good Conduct at your Imperial Maje∣sty's

our Person, as our Ambassadour Extraordinary

all that he shall say to you in our Royal Name,
as if we were Present, to do it in Person. We
will only add, as a Mark of our Esteem, for your
Ambassadour himself, who suffer'd this Insult, that
as we were sensible of his Personal Virtues, and
<PB N="297" REF="306"/>
great Qualities, during his Residence at our Court;
so we were more particularly concern'd, that such
an Injury should be offer'd to a Gentleman of so
great Merit and Consideration; being, besides, the

Allie. And so praying, that the Dispencer of all
good Things, will vouchsafe to Power forth his
heavenly Benedictions, upon the Person and King∣doms
of your Imperial Majesty, we recommend you
to his holy Protection.</P>

<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, having receiv'd this Let∣ter
from the Hands of the Ambassador, deliver'd
it to the Count <HI>de Galoffkin,</HI> great Chamberlain
of his Empire, and was pleas'd to make the fol∣lowing
Answer in his own Tongue.</P>
<P>“IT was but requisite, that her Majesty, the
Queen, should have given us Satisfaction,
by punishing the Criminals, conformably to our
Demands, in the most rigorous Manner, as is
the Custom in such Cases through out the Uni∣verse:
But seeing her Majesty has ordered you
<PB N="298" REF="307"/>
to make Excuses, in the Quality of her Am∣bassador
Extraordinary conferr'd upon you, ex∣presly
for this Purpose, and to remonstrate that
her Majesty could not inflict such a Punish∣ment
upon them, because of the Defect in that
Particular, of the former establish'd Constitu∣tions
of her Kingdom, and that with the una∣nimous
Consent of the Parliament, her Maje∣sty
has caused a New Act to be passed, to serve
as a Law therein for the Future, we accept
all this, for a Proof of the Affection, her Ma∣jesty
has for us, and for sufficient Satisfaction;
and we will give Orders to our Ministers, to
settle entirely this Affair with you in a Con∣ference.”</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty having conluded his An∣swer,
his Excellency, the Ambassador, retired
backwards out of the Hall, making three Obei∣sances,
in the same Manner as when he came in,
and was conducted back to his House, with the
same Ceremony, and with the same Train, ac∣company'd
by the Carver and the Cup-Bearer,
the First of which, treated him three Days suc∣cessively,
by express Orders of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty,
with the greatest Plenty, Delicacy, and Mag∣nificence,
the Officers of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
Houshold serving at the Table.</P>
<P>ON the 9th. <HI>O. S.</HI> The Ambassador came to
the House of his Excellency, the Count <HI>de Goloff∣kin,</HI>
Great Chamberlain of the Empire, and
there had a Conference with him, and other Mi∣nisters
of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, in which this trou∣blesome
Affair was terminated, to the mutual Sa∣tisfaction
of the two Powers, the Differences
which had been occasion'd by so ill an Accident,
<PB N="299" REF="308"/>
were Compos'd, and the ancient Friendship, and
good Correspondence between the two Crowns
renew'd, on the Condition, that the following
Articles, which were stipulated, should be per∣form'd;
the Ambassador of her <HI>Britanick Majesty,</HI>
Engaging to procure the Execution of the last
but one.</P>
<P>THAT his Czarish Majesty Emperor of <HI>Great
Russia,</HI> will send Orders to Monsieur <HI>de Ma∣tueoff</HI>
his Ambassador, and Plenipotentiary, at the
<HI>Hague;</HI> to notify, provisionally, by a Letter to her
Majesty, the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that Mr.
<HI>Charles Whitworth,</HI> being vested with the Cha∣racter,
of her Ambassador Extraordinary, and Pleni∣potentiary,
expresly, and purposely to make Excuses,
on occasion of the Affront, in Question has perform'd
that Commission; and that his Majesty, having re∣gard
to the Instances of her Majesty, the Queen,
has been pleased to accept the said Excuses, made in
her Name, for Satisfaction of the outrage done at
<HI>London,</HI> to the Ambassador of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty;
with an Intention, thereby to shew, the high
Value he puts upon the Friendship of her <HI>Britanick</HI>
Majesty, and on the Continuance of that Friendship,
and in Hope of the like Return on her Part, in
Occasions wherein his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty may be con∣cern'd:
And that in Consequence hereof, his <HI>Czar∣ish</HI>
Majesty is willing to forgive the criminal Pro∣ceedings
of the Authors and Accomplicies of the said
Affront; and desires her Majesty, the Queen, to be
pleased to order them to be discharg'd from the Pro∣cess
issued against them, and from the Sentence pro∣nounced,
and the Penalties to which they were con∣demned
for to the said Insult.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="309"/>
His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty having a just regard, to the
faithful and signal Services which his said Ambas∣sador,
who was insulted, has perform'd; and in
a gracious Remembrance of the laudable Zeal of his
deceased Father, his Excellency, Monsieur <HI>Artemon
Sergiewicz de Matueoff,</HI> first Minister and Boyar
in the Reign of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Father, and
Grand-father of glorious Memory, who in exhorting
Rebels to their Obedience, Crowned his faithful and
important Services with his Blood, shed by Mutiniers:
He cannot but (in token of his good Will towards
him) after his own Satisfaction, regard the particu∣lar
Satisfaction of his Minister, namely, the Repa∣ration
of his Honour, and that of his Family by the
Expedient of a Letter from her Majesty, the Queen,
and the Reimbursement of all the Costs and Dama∣ges
which he has been obliged to be at, and to suf∣fer
on Account of the said Affront.</P>
<P>His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, will give Orders to his
said Ambassador, to demand his Letter of Re-cre∣dence,
which he refused to accept when he left <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
as well as the usual Present, and the Yatch
which her Majesty caused to be offer'd to him; and
this, because of the aforesaid Affront.</P>
<P>All that is above specify'd, being Executed, his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty will acquaint her Majesty, the
Queen, that he is content with the aforesaid Satis∣faction,
by a Letter, which shall be deliver'd to the
Ambassador, Mr. <HI>Whitworth.</HI></P>
<P>THUS ended this Affair, in which, some Peo∣ple
thought the Queen stoop'd to low to the
<HI>Czar;</HI> as if the <HI>Czar</HI> had not been a Prince of
such Fame and Power, as merited so much Consi∣deration;
but the Queen and her Council knew
better what Figure the <HI>Czar</HI> made in the World,
<PB N="301" REF="310"/>
and of what Use the Commerce of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
to the <HI>Russian</HI> Dominions was of; and besides this,
her Majesty very well knew, also, that Justice
requir'd it, as she would expect her Ministers
abroad should be well used, by the Princes and
Powers, her Neighbours; and as she expected o∣ther
Princes and Nations should act by her, if
her Ministers receiv'd any Affront from the Rables
and Clamours of the People.</P>
<P>WE are now to return to the Affair of the
<HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> was really, very loath to fall out
with the <HI>Turks.</HI> But, as he found his Enemy,
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI>
had the Ascendant there, and would kindle a
Flame whether he would or no, he made the ne∣cessary
Preparations for his own Defence.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, heat the same time wrote Letters,
and sent Ambassadors to the Grand Seignior, if
possible, to prevent a Rupture, and publish'd
several Declarations, offering to refer any Differ∣ences
that might happen between the Grand
Seignior and himself, to the Arbitration of other
Princes; and the <HI>Turks</HI> at the same Time, send∣ing
an Aga, as a Minister to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to prevent the
Emperor taking Umbrage at his Breach with the
<HI>Czar,</HI> His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty transmitted one of his
Declarations to <HI>Vienna,</HI> that it might be commu∣nicated
to the said <HI>Turkish</HI> Minister, upon his Ar∣rival
there; this Declaration shewing a Readi∣ness
in the <HI>Czar,</HI> to preserve the Publick Peace;
is of very great Consequence in this Case, to
clear the Character of the <HI>Czar,</HI> from the Scan∣dal
of Breach of Treaty, which was pretended
to be charg'd upon him, the <HI>Turks</HI> being manifest∣ly
the Aggressors.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="311"/>
WHEREAS, we have receiv'd certain Informa∣tion,
from divers Places, that the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port
endeavours to justify the Violation of Peace, by a War;
already declared against us, and actually begun, by
the Irruption of the <HI>Tartars</HI> into our Territories:
And for that Purpose, charge us with several ground∣less
Matters, by which, they pretend they were forc'd
to come to a Rup<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure; and amongst others, as if we
were not inclin'd to continue in Peace with them, but
had actually resolved to begin a War: As also, that
contrary to the Peace concluded with the <HI>Otto∣man's</HI>
we had erecteds several new Fortifications, on
our Frontiers; suffer'd our Troops to Enter the
<HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions; and that we would not give
them Leave to Convoy the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in
Safety, back to his own Territories. We have
thought it necessary to declare here openly, that
we never had the leaft Intention, to break in any
Manner whatsoever, the Peace concluded between us
and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, and to enter into a War
with the <HI>Turks;</HI> but the same has been hitherto,
religiously, and inviolably observed by us; the For∣tifications
erected by us, are likewise, in no Respect,
against the Treaty, but upon our own Territories;
which partly belong'd to us of Old, and partly was
yielded to us by the Treaty, and the Limits marked
out by the Commissaries on both Sides, which have
been fixed many Years ago: And it is therefore to be
wonder'd, that the <HI>Port</HI> would take Occasion to com∣plain
thereof, at this Juncture; our Troops never
enter'd on the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions, but remain'd only
upon the Frontiers; and altho', they did some Time
ago▪ according to the Laws of War, pursue their Enemy
into the <HI>Turkish</HI> Territories, and seized them there∣in;
which, however, was done in such Places, where
<PB N="303" REF="312"/>
there were, no Inhabitants; yet all this as well as
other Matters, were fully setled and adjusted, in the
Confirmation of Peace, renew'd last Year; whereby
the <HI>Port</HI> did likewise stipulate with our Ambassa∣dor,
that they should Convoy the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
with 500 <HI>Turks,</HI> thro' <HI>Poland,</HI> and that we should
Guard him by our Officers from the Frontiers; to
which, we not only consented, but also, promised to
procure the like Consent, from the King and Repub∣lick
of <HI>Poland:</HI> But this being not accepted by the
<HI>Port,</HI> on the Account of several Pretences, we did
at last, in two of our Letters to the Sultan, and
by our Ambassador, and Privy-Councellor <HI>Tolshoy,</HI>
at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> declare that we would suffer
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to pass through <HI>Poland</HI> free,
and unmolested, into his own Dominions; and to
that End, permit him a Guard of 5000 <HI>Turks,</HI>
to send him safe thro' <HI>Poland;</HI> whereby our peace∣able
Temper sufficiently appears, and that on our
Part, we have contributed all, what might pre∣vent
all manner of Disturbance, and maintain
a good Correspondence, and Neighbourly Friend∣ship
with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, and that all the
World may be sensible thereof, we confirm here,
with our former Declaration an Offer, before a
tedious War be commenc'd, to accommodate Matters
with the <HI>Port,</HI> and to live in a neighbourly Amity
with her, as formerly: And notwithstanding, in
order to provide for our Precaution and Security;
(after we have been informed from all Parts, of a
Rupture, and that the War is actually declared
against us at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and our Ambassa∣dor
carried Prisoner to the <HI>Seven Towers</HI>), we
have caused our Troops to march to the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Frontiers: They shall, however, not undertake any
Hostilities, provided the <HI>Turks</HI> live on their Part,
<PB N="304" REF="313"/>
peaceably; put a Stop to all Preparations of War,
and set our Ambassador with all his Retinue, at
Liberty; and we will, as soon as we are sufficient∣ly
assured of these Things, by the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port;
Order our Forces to with draw from the Frontiers,
and facilitate as much as in us lies, a friendly Ac∣commodation:
So we willingly accept, and herewith
desire the Mediation of his Imperial Majesty, her
Majesty the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and their High
Mightinesses the States General. But in Case the
<HI>Port,</HI> without any Occasion given her by us, should
persist in her Resolution to break the Peace with us,
and begin the War against us; we declare before God,
and all the World, that we are excusable, and not
guilty of all the Blood that may be spilt on this Oc∣casion;
and we have an entire Confidence in God,
that he will assist our just Cause, and prosper our
Arms with Victory, against an Enemy who breaks
Treaties; and who but a Year ago, by so many Oaths
and Promises, confirm'd, and renew'd the Peace with
us.</P>

<P>AFTER this, the War being actually begun by
the <HI>Turks,</HI> his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty published another
Declaration, which was sent to all the Ministers
of Christian Powers at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> in order
to have them insist as Occasion offer'd, with the
<HI>Turkish</HI> Ministers, upon the Terms offer'd, there∣in,
as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="314"/>
“TIMES have produced Revolutions, Peace
and War have alternately succeeded
in the World; and Mankind in every Age,
has been toss'd with strange Vicissitudes: But
the present Profidiousness of the <HI>Ottomans,</HI>
is such, as Antiquity can scarse Paralel, and
the modern Ages deservedly abhor.”</P>
<P>“NO doubt, but the Common Report of this,
has reached most Peoples Ears; Be it therefore,
manifestly Known to all, how <HI>Achmet,</HI> the
now Reigning Sultan of the <HI>Turks,</HI> has impi∣ously,
frivolously, and without the least, just
Occasion, violated, and broken the 30 Years
Peace, concluded between his sacred <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty,
and his Predecessor, Sultan <HI>Mustapha,</HI>
tho' renew'd by himself, this very last Year,
1710, and ratify'd by a solemn Oath, in the
Presence of the most high God of Heaven;
which he afterwards confirm'd, as well in his
Letters which he writ to his said <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty,
as in the Deed of publick Renovation;
and yet, in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> the very
same Year, e're the Sun had compleated its
annual Course, he declared War publickly, at
<HI>Constantinople;</HI> and contrary to the Law of
Nations, cast his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Ambassador,
and Privy-Councellor, Monsieur <HI>Tols<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy,</HI> and
his whole Family, into the Prison called the
<HI>Edicul,</HI> after having first affronted him in a
most ignominious Manner, and seized upon
his Goods.”</P>
<P>“IT is true, he has not herein degenerated
from his Fore-fathers; for being born an
Enemy to the Name of CHRIST, he never Ar∣ticles
with an Intention to observe the sacred
<PB N="306" REF="315"/>
Laws of Peace; but as a Man void of all
Honour, does it only, that he may after∣wards,
with greater Security, attack, and ut∣terly
overwhelm those that rely upon the
religious Sanctions of publick Treaties.”</P>
<P>“The Historians of former Ages, and especi∣ally
that most excellent Patriarch of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
St. <HI>Nectaris</HI> testifies, that the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> from
their very Beginnings, made it their chief
Study, to watch Quarrels and Disagreements,
that at any Time happen'd between any <HI>Chri∣stian</HI>
Princes, and States; and that as often as
they found Occasion, they never stuck at any
Stipulations of Peace, or solemn Oaths; and
that thus, the Offspring of Thieves and Rob∣bers,
did in a few Years, subdue to their own
Dominions, so many ancient and renowned
<HI>Christian</HI> Kingdoms and Provinces, together
with a great many holy and venerable Places;
and at last became the most powerful, and
formidable People.”</P>
<P>“THE poor oppress'd <HI>Grecians, Valachians,
Bulgarians,</HI> and <HI>Servians,</HI> groan still under
Yoke, and their Misery shews by woful
Experience, how little a Value do those Bar∣barians
set upon publick Treaties. Nor has
the Kingdom of <HI>Hungary</HI> experienced less to
its great Detriment.”</P>
<P>“THE <HI>Russian</HI> Monarchy, still bears in Mind,
the Destruction with which it was threaten'd,
in the Year, 1677, when in the Reign of the
<HI>Czar, Theodore Alexowits,</HI> Emperor of all
<HI>Russia,</HI> of pious and glorious Memory; the per∣fidious
<HI>Turk,</HI> being in Hopes that the lesser
<HI>Russia,</HI> should become a Prey to his Ambition,
thro' the Treachery of <HI>Poroszen,</HI> General of the
<PB N="307" REF="316"/>
<HI>Cossacks,</HI> beyond the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>risthenes,</HI> broke the Peace,
and with a vast and dreadful Army, invaded
the <HI>Ukrain,</HI> and tho' he had been already inform'd
that the said Traytor, had submitted to
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Mercy, and the <HI>Higirin,</HI>
the Place of his chief Residence, was actually
Garrison'd, by his said Majesty's Forces: Yet
finding that the noble Firmness of the <HI>Russian</HI>
Troops, did hinder him from penetrating far∣ther
into the <HI>Ukrain,</HI> he bent all the Fury,
which he design'd to make the whole Province
feel, against the City, which he in Vain be∣sieg'd,
tho' but slightly fortify'd, insomuch,
that the <HI>Russians</HI> themselves, would have aban∣doned
and demolish'd it, but that the Exegency
of the War requir'd their keeping it for that
Time: So, that after a prodigious Loss of Men,
he was forc'd to retire to his own Teritories,
loaded with Shame and Ignominy, and to beg
Peace of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, which was con∣cluded
in 1681.”</P>
<P>“THE memorable Slaughter, made of these
Peace Breakers at <HI>Vienna</HI> in <HI>Austria,</HI> in 1683,
and the wonderful Progress of the <HI>Christian</HI>
Arms afterwards, are still fresh in every Bo∣dy's
Memory; nor is it needful to mention,
the Insolence, with which they then broke in,
to besiege that Metropolis.”</P>
<P>“IT is recorded in the Archieves of <HI>Christan</HI>
Princes, the having seriously fore-seen the cun∣ning
Designs, which the <HI>Barbarians</HI> form'd, of
swallowing up their several Dominions, one by
one; they enter'd into a holy and mutual
League: To wit, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, the Em∣peror
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire,
his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty, the Republick of <HI>Poland,</HI>
<PB N="308" REF="317"/>
and <HI>Venice,</HI> and the Pope of <HI>Rome;</HI> and their
<HI>Czarean</HI> Majesties, <HI>John Alexowitz,</HI> of pious
Memory, and <HI>Peter Alexowitz,</HI> who now happily
Reigns, being likewise invited, for the common
Safety of <HI>Christianity;</HI> and induced both by the
continual Irruptions of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI>
into their Territories, and their Hostilities
and Incursions into the Dominions of other
<HI>Christian</HI> Princes; join'd first in a perpetual
Peace, and a perpetual League, offensive and
defensive, with his Royal Majesty the King of
<HI>Poland,</HI> in 1696; and the Following Year 1697,
in a triennial Alliance, with his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty,
the Emperor of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and the Re∣publick
of <HI>Venice,</HI> mutually Engaging them∣selves,
to deliver the Kingdoms of <HI>Hungary,
Sclavonia, Dalmatia,</HI> and the <HI>Morea;</HI> together
with the Cities of <HI>Tanna,</HI> (commonly called <HI>A∣zoph</HI>)
and <HI>Casifurmen,</HI> from the Tyranny of the
Infidels: Nor could this Design well fail of the
wish'd Success, if by continuing the War, a few
Years longer, as his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty would have
had it. The Enemy, who was already reduc'd
to great Straits; had been brought so low, as
not to have it in their Power, but at the Peril
of their unavoidable Downfal, ever to annoy
the <HI>Christian</HI> World any where again.”</P>
<P>“BUT to our great Sorrow, these irreconcilea∣ble
<HI>Barbarians,</HI> did at the Congress of <HI>Carlowitz,</HI>
partly by Perswasions, and partly by Artifice,
induce the High Confederates to enter into a
Treaty with them; made Room for Intrigues,
sow'd the Darnel of Discord, and withdrew
all the above-mention'd Potentates from his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Alliance, and at last conclud∣ed
a 25 Years Peace, exclusive of him; no
<PB N="309" REF="318"/>
other Remedy being left, Monsieur <HI>Worniori,</HI>
his said Majesty's Ambassador, but to adjust a
Truce for two Years, on the 3d of <HI>July,</HI> 1700;
which was soon followed, by 30 Years Peace,
concluded at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> between his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty, and the late Sultan <HI>Mustapha,</HI> by his
said Majesty's Envoys, Monsieurs <HI>Ucranstow,</HI>
and <HI>Heredajow:</HI> But enough of Things done
so long ago, let us come to Matters near
Hand, which require a more diligent Exami∣nation.”</P>
<P>“HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty did so religiously ob∣serve
the Articles of this Treaty; and tho' be∣fore
it was ratify'd, the Sultan of the <HI>Budziack
Tartars,</HI> did offer to subject himself, and his
People, to his most powerful Scepter; the
Proposal was rejected, because nothing should
be done, that might have the least Appearance
of Contravention; nor did the <HI>Turkish</HI> Subject,
<HI>Kubjick Murza</HI> succeed better afterwards, when
he came to <HI>Azoph,</HI> with a considerable Body
of <HI>Cubak Tartars,</HI> to offer also Homage.”</P>
<P>“AND his said Majesty being also▪ resolv'd, to
observe the Peace, still with more Exactness,
after it was ratify'd by his Ambassador Extra∣ordinary,
and Plenipotentiary, Prince <HI>Deme∣trius
Galickzin;</HI> he enjoyn'd all his Governors in
the Frontier Towns, the General of the <HI>Zaporavi∣an
Tartars,</HI> who was one of his Subjects, and all
other Commanders of his Troops, as well Na∣tives
as Foreigners, under most severe Penalties,
that they should not presume to disturb the
Peace, and good neighbourly Friendship, by
any Incursions, into the Teritories, either of
the <HI>Turks,</HI> or <HI>Tartars.”</HI></P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="319"/>
“AND his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty carry'd the punctu∣al
Observation of the Articles of this Treaty,
to that Height; that whereas, some of the
<HI>Zaporavion Tartars,</HI> did in the Tear 1701, Rob
some <HI>Grecians,</HI> who were coming to the <HI>Ukrain</HI>
with Merchandize, and that the Sultan of the
<HI>Turks</HI> demanded the Damage to be made good; his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty knowing, it was to no Purpose, to
expect any Reparation from the Robers, order'd
that the said <HI>Grecians</HI> should be indemnify'd out
of his own Treasury, and that 100000 Dollars
of an Ounce Weight, should be paid to them.”</P>
<P>“ON the other Hand, notwithstanding this,
Peace was confirm'd by both the Sultans own
Letters, and his solemn Oath, the <HI>Turks</HI> and
<HI>Tartars</HI> did continually, and by all manner of
Ways, injure his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Subjects, kil∣ling
line some, carrying others into Captivity; and
taking away their Horses, and other Cattle; as

“HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Ambassador at <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI>
made his Complaint of these Outrages;
but to no purpose: For neither were the Da∣mages
made good, nor any Stop put to those
Depredations; tho' on his Majesty's Side,
the <HI>Turks</HI> receiv'd Satisfaction, even to their most
frivolous pretentions.”</P>
<P>“WHO would have doubted, but that after the
above-mention'd Instances of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty's
true Friendship, in rejecting so many Ho∣mages
offer'd him, he should at least have met
with a suitable Return on the like Occasion;
but it was quite otherwise.”</P>
<P>“THE <HI>Turks</HI> in the Year 1708, did not only
give Shelter and Assistance to the fugitive Re∣bel
<HI>Cossacks, Nearassaw,</HI> and his Adherents;
but permitted the <HI>Tartars</HI> to join with them,
and make Inroads into his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty Ter∣ritories.”</P>
<P>“NOR did they act with more Candor, in the
Year 1709, in <HI>Reference,</HI> to the Remains of
the <HI>Swedish</HI> Forces, after the glorious and me∣morable
Battle of <HI>Pultoua:</HI> For the King him∣self,
with as many of the Officers, and Soldiers
of his routed Army, as did escape the Conque∣ror's
Sword, and his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Be∣trayor
the base <HI>Mazeppa,</HI> with his Adherents,
retiring into the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions, where pro∣tected
there: And tho' by the Law of Nations,
and War, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Troops might
have pursued them, yet they receiv'd Orders
by no Means to approach <HI>Oczacow,</HI> where
the Enemy and the aforesaid Rebels were, but
on the Contrary, to come back again to their
own Territories. And whereas his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty
did first by his Ambassador, and after∣wards,
<PB N="312" REF="321"/>
by three different Letters, which he
writ to the Sultan, demanded that he would
not protect his Enemy; but that without far∣ther
Delay, he would make him depart his
Dominions, and deliver up the Rebels: Neither
was he comply'd with, nor any Answer return'd
to his Letters in a great while: But rather
Leave granted to the Enemy, and the Rebels
to invade his Majesty's Dominions; which they
did in conjunction with the <HI>Valachians</HI> and <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
surprizing in the Night-time, the Town
of <HI>Jaharhick,</HI> and carrying away the Com∣mander,
with whatever belong'd to him.”</P>
<P>“AFTERWARDS, in the Year 1710, they car∣ry'd
off all the Inhabitants of <HI>Jargowitz</HI> and
<HI>Nemback,</HI> with all their Substance; kill'd a
Captain and several Soldiers, of <HI>Uman Cossacks;</HI>
carry'd away another, with 150 private Centi∣nals;
they plundered a great Company of Car∣riers,
that were coming with Salt from <HI>Mo∣lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naw,</HI>
carrying away most of the Men, and
all the Horses; they also robb'd the Waggons
design'd for carrying the Baggage of the Army,
at a Place call'd <HI>Cammen Laton,</HI> carrying off
most of the Waggons, and all the Beasts of
Carriage, and plunder'd the Town of <HI>Comensea,</HI>
in the District of <HI>Czigirin.</HI>”</P>
<P>“NO Redress was ever made for any of these
Damages, nor any satisfactory Answer given,
to the many Complaints made of such hostile
Invasions, but the Matter still put off, with
frivolous Excuses.”</P>
<P>“THE <HI>Ottomans</HI> at last, being resolv'd to carry
their wicked Designs, under the Masque of
Peace, their chief Minister, the Visier <HI>Ali Basha,</HI>
proposed to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Ambassador,
<PB N="313" REF="322"/>
that if his Majesty would consent, to confirm
the thirty Years Peace concluded between him
and the present Sultan's Brother, and give his
positive Word, that he was firmly resolv'd, to
observe it; he promised, that the Sultan then
would not only ratify it, but that also, the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s departure out of his Domini∣ons
should be agreed upon.”</P>
<P>“HEREUPON, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was pleased
to send full Powers to his Ambassador for that
Purpose, and writ to the Sultan himself about
it; upon which the Sultan of the <HI>Turks,</HI> did so∣lemnly
confirm the Peace with his Majesty,
in <HI>December</HI> 1709, and bound himself by Oath,
calling the great God of Heaven, to witness,
(as shall appear by the Copy hereto annexed)
that he would Religiously observe the Laws of
it, and the Ratifications were afterwards mutu∣ally
exchang'd.”</P>
<P>“AS to what concerns the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> it
was agreed with the chief Minister <HI>Ali Basha,</HI>
1. 500 <HI>Turks</HI> should be permitted to accompa∣ny
him thro' <HI>Poland</HI> into his own Country; and
that for his greater Security, from being insult∣ed
by any of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Troops, one
of his Majesty's Officers, and some of the <HI>Rus∣sian</HI>
Garrisons would receive him upon the Fron∣tiers,
and conduct him safe thither, but that in
Reference to the Rebel <HI>Cossacks,</HI> they should be
all expell'd the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions.”</P>
<P>“HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty gave Consent to this
Agreement, and order'd Letters to be writ
thereupon to his Ambassador; But the <HI>Turk,</HI>
far from putting the Articles thereof in Execu∣tion,
did neither dismiss the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
nor expel the Rebels; But rather gave way to
<PB N="314" REF="323"/>
several ill Designs, which were carrying on
against his <HI>Carish</HI> Majesty.”</P>
<P>“UPON Notice of these Artifices, his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty resolv'd to write a Letter to the Sul∣tan,
(the Copy of which is hereunto annex'd,
and mark'd with an A); wherein he was pleased
to declare to him, that he consented that the
Number of the <HI>Turks</HI> design'd to accompany
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> should be augmented to
3000; sending Orders at the same Time, to
his Ambassador, that they should be made up
5000.”</P>
<P>“BUT it was to no Purpose to expect any
Answer to this point: On the contrary, the
Report began ro encrease, that the <HI>Turks</HI> began
to incline their Thoughts to War.”</P>
<P>“WHEREUPON his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty order'd a
second Letter to be written to the Sultan, on
the 18th—29th of <HI>October</HI> 1710, (as appears
by the Copy hereunto annex'd, and mark'd B)
and dispatch'd an Envoy Extraordinary on pur∣pose
with it. But in stead of an Answer, Word
was brought to him, that-his Envoy, contrary
to the Law of Nations, was seiz'd and put
into a Dungeon, where he Lies to this very
Day.”</P>
<P>“Couriers at length began to arrive from all
Parts, with Advice, that the Sultan at the In∣stigation
of the Han of <HI>Tartary,</HI> had actuallay
declar'd War at <HI>Constantinople</HI> against his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty, without any Conscience, and only
with a bear Pretence, that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
had given some Motives thereunto, as forced
him to break the Peace; which is but a ridicu∣lous
saying; for those very Motives pretended,
were all decided by the last Peace. They
<PB N="315" REF="324"/>
further brought Word that his Majesty's Ambas∣sador,
after several base Affronts put upon
him, was imprison'd; the warlike Preparations
were making throughout the whole <HI>Turkish</HI>
Empire; the Troops were drawing together
about <HI>Bender,</HI> and the Expedition was notify'd
to all the <HI>Yurkish</HI> Generals (commonly call'd
<HI>Bashas</HI>) with Orders to raise Soldiers.”</P>
<P>“THESE Proceedings were more than enough,
to expose the perfidiousness of the Sultan; how∣ever,
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, to convince the whole
World, that the Breach of the Peace, and the
Effusion of Humain Blood, which of Necessity
must follow, ought not to be laid to his Charge,
but to the Sultans; did after all, tho' to little
Purpose, order another Letter to be writ to him
in his Name, dated at <HI>Petersburg,</HI> the 6th, 17th,
of <HI>January</HI> last, of the same Tenure with the
Copy (here unto also annex'd, and mark'd with
C. (<HI>viz.</HI>) that if the said Sultan did not acquaint
him put of Hand with his positive Resolutions,
of renewing, and strictly observing the Treaty
of Peace; he would look upon it as a real Breach
of it; nor would he suffer himself to be amus'd,
or circumvented by any Craft; but would
(with God's assistance) begin Warlike Prepara∣tions
with all Expedition, in order to oppose him
early both by Sea and Land.”</P>
<P>“NOW let the honest and impartial Part of
the World examine the several Heads of the
<HI>Turkish</HI> Declaration of War, so falsely and so
awkardly patch'd together, and publish'd
every where, as also, the Crimes they charge
us with.”</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="325"/>
“THE <HI>Ottomans</HI> give out, that they began this
War purely to assist the Rebel <HI>Lezeinsky,</HI> whom
they look upon to be the right King of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and to deliver the Republick from his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty's Troops, and that they do this at the
Request of the said Republick, prescribed there∣to
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the depriv'd Palatine of <HI>Kiow Polocky,</HI>
and <HI>Poniatowsky,</HI> but who in every Fact, are Be∣trayers
of their native Country; and likewise,
because his said <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had refused at
the <HI>Turks</HI> Request, to withdraw his Troops out
of the Kingdom, and to relinquish his Royal
Confederate <HI>Augustus</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Poland.</HI>”</P>
<P>“WHO is the Man will say, that this was a
Thing fit to be done; or that such a Demand
was just; whereas the whole Republick of <HI>Po∣land,</HI>
and the grand Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> do own
his Royal Majesty <HI>Augustus</HI> the Second, for their
lawful King, and the said King and Kingdom,
continue in Alliance with his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty,
by Vertue of which, the said Troops are obli∣ged
to continue in <HI>Poland,</HI> as Auxiliaries; and
that the King and Senate, are under a Necessi∣ty
of keeping them there: For it is as clear as
the Sun at Noon, that their Common Enemy,
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the <HI>Polish</HI> Rebels are
protected by the Sultan, for no other End but
that through their Means, a bloody War might
be again kindled in the <HI>Russian</HI> and <HI>Polish</HI> Domi∣nions:
Besides if his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had with∣drawn
his said Troops, the Consequence would
be; that the <HI>Turks</HI> introducing the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> into <HI>Poland</HI> on one Side, and <HI>Lezeinsky</HI>
entring on the other, after they had ravaged
the whole Kingdom at their Pleasure, would
<PB N="317" REF="326"/>
unite their Forces, and fall upon his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty, and so create worse Disorders than
the former: This is the Reason why his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty refused to comply with the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Arrogance, or by relinquishing his Confedera∣cy,
to expose <HI>Poland</HI> as a Pray to the <HI>Barba∣rians.</HI>”</P>
<P>“WHY was not the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> all this
while dismiss'd out of <HI>Turkey,</HI> by some of the
ways proposed by his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, either by
Sea or Land, or even with a select Guard, or
by some other better Way; laying aside all
tnose far fetch'd, and Frivilous Pretences, which
are made use of; and then his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
would immediately have withdrawn all his
Troops out of <HI>Poland,</HI> and out of the fortify'd
Towns of the Republick, which for their Com∣mon
Security he is at Present oblig'd to Gar∣rison,
until the Danger be over.”</P>
<P>“THE <HI>Turks</HI> complain besides in their Declara∣tion
of War, that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had built
some Forts, within the Boundaries of the <HI>Otto∣man</HI>
Dominions; but this Pretence is manifestly
false: For his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty caused no Forts
to be Built any where, but in those Places that
were incorporated with his Empire, and expres∣ly
adjudg'd to belong to it, as well by the
Treaty of Peace, as by the Agreement ad∣justed
on assertaining the Boundaries on the

Monsieur <HI>Tolstoy</HI> Governor of the said City;

<P><PB N="318" REF="327"/>
“AND as for what the <HI>Turks</HI> object, in the
same Declaration about his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
Troops breaking into their Territories, in pur∣suit
of the fugative <HI>Swedes,</HI> where they killed
some and enslav'd others; the <HI>Muscovites</HI> did
this according to the Manner and Custom of

when the Thing was afterwards rightly ex∣plain'd
to them; besides, that this Affair, was
entirely adjudg'd, and for ever to be hush'd by
the last renewing of the Peace.”</P>
<P>“BUT as far as we dive into the true Design
of the <HI>Turks,</HI> it appears to be, first, To force
by previous Aggressions, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's
Troops, who by Virtue of the Alliance with
his Royal Majesty King <HI>Augustus,</HI> and the Re∣publick
of <HI>Poland</HI> as is already mention'd, re∣main
the Kingdom as Auxiliaries, to return out
of it. Next, to introduce the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>

drive the aforesaid Lawful King again from
his Throne; and last of all to obtrude with
Fire and Sword, the Rebel <HI>Stanislaus Lezeinsky,</HI>

the several Provinces being for ever dismem∣bred

Fortress of <HI>Caminick,</HI> be yielded up to the In∣fidels,
according to the Promises made by the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the late Palatine of <HI>Kiow
Postoki,</HI> and <HI>Poniatows<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> in <HI>Lezenisky's</HI> Name;
besides, what by the Artifice of their Confede∣rates,
what by means of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Forces, and
<PB N="319" REF="328"/>
those of <HI>Lezeinsky,</HI> now lurking in <HI>Pomerania,</HI>
they would raise a Storm in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire,
and kindle a War there; which done, to carry
on the War against his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, in
conjunction with their Confederates, and by
the perfidious Means of the <HI>Mazeppian</HI> Rebels,
and <HI>Blavian</HI> Cossacks, to foment Sedition within
his Majesty's Empire; and thus to put in Ex∣ecution
those most pernicious and abominable
Designs which they have premeditated as
well against his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, and the
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> as against the whole <HI>Christian</HI>
World.”</P>
<P>“THAT therefore, the Justice of his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty's Cause, may clearly appear to all
the honest Part of the World, that he never
since this first Minute of the Truce of <HI>Carlo∣witz,</HI>
and the Conclusion of the 30 Years Peace,
which the Sultan of the <HI>Turks</HI> has now basely
broke to this very Hour, gave him any Occati∣on
for such a Breach, but did holily and reli∣giously
observe the same, notwithstanding
the great and many Attempts made to the Con∣trary,
on the Part of the <HI>Turks,</HI> what by ho∣stile
Irruptions in his Dominions; and what by
protecting his rebel Subjects, and giving Shelter
to his Enemy, he has the Contrary been graci∣ously
Pleas'd to command this most wicked
Breach of the <HI>Turks</HI> to be exposed to all Mens
View.”</P>
<P>“LET every Body now consider the Inclinati∣on
which his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty has shew'd all along
for Peace: Then discuss the just and Moderate
Steps he made in the whole Series of this Af∣fair,
and judge whether there was the least Oc∣cation
given on his Majesty's Side, for break∣ing
<PB N="320" REF="329"/>
of the Peace, and whether after the previ∣ous
Marks which he gave of his good Intentions,
he could abstain from declaring War in his
Turn, against the profidious and perpetual
Enemy of <HI>Christanity:</HI> And finally, let him
conclude, that this particular War was forced
upon his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty contrary to the Faith
of Treaties, and the Sacred Tye of publick
Oaths; who thereupon with God Almighty's
Assistance, has resolv'd in his own Defence, to
order his Army, to March to his Frontiers
against his perfidious Enemy, the Sultan of the
<HI>Turks,</HI> and all his Confederates and Abettors:
And to follow it himself in Person, very soon,
and committing upon his bended Knee, the
Justice of his Cause, to the same great God's
Judgment, thus betakes himself to Arms.”</P>
<P>“AT the same time the <HI>Czar</HI> wrote a Letter to
the Grand Seignior himself, to remove the Ob∣jection

into his own Territories, offering to give him free
Passage through the <HI>Muscovite</HI> and <HI>Polish</HI> Domini∣ons,
with a sufficient Guard for the Safety of his
Person, or to allow the <HI>Turks</HI> to convoy him
with a certain Number of Troops. The Letter
is as follows.”</P>
<P>WE wrote twice to your Highness, namely, <HI>first</HI>
the 28th of <HI>July,</HI> and <HI>secondly,</HI> the 29th of
<HI>October,</HI> of the last Year, that according to inter∣cepted
Letters, and by the long Abode of the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> in your Territories, it was to be fear'd
that that Prince and his Adherents, with the <HI>Cos∣sacks,</HI>
<PB N="321" REF="330"/>
Rebels to us, and to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> our
Ally; would by Means of the tryaterous Palatine of
<HI>Kiow,</HI> and others, who finding Refuge in your Ter∣ritories,
endeavours to engage your Highness in a
War; for which Reason we desir'd that your Highness
would Cause his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty forthwith to depart
your Territories, and return into his own; offering
him a free Passage through our Armies, under a
a Guard of 4000 <HI>Tartars,</HI> and 5000 <HI>Turks,</HI> in case
your Highness should think it proper, for his greater
Security: This is what our Ambassador was charged
to propose to you; and his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty having
likewise consented to it, we were bound to answer for
the said free Passage.</P>
<P>Moreover, We declared, that in case your High∣ness
would grant a more numerous Guard to the King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and conduct him into <HI>Poland</HI> by force of
Arms, This would be look'd upon by us, and by his
<HI>Polish</HI> Majesty, that your Highness had a mind to
break the Peace of <HI>Carlowitz</HI> and that we should be
oblig'd to oppose the same to the utmost of our Power,
by Virtue of the Alliance, whereby we are mutually
bound to assist each other.</P>
<P>We are not the violators of that Peace, but would
religiously observe it on our Part, to prevent the Effu∣sion
of Human Blood; God will surely revenge it
upon the Fomentor of the War, and Violator of the
most Solemn Treaties: and should the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
offer to return into his Dominions by any other
Way than has been proposed to him under Colour of
greater Security, we shall look upon that Proceeding
as an open Violation of the Peace.</P>
<P>We have not yet received any Answer from your
Highness, to our former Letters, nor from our Am∣bassdor,
to let us know whether he deliver'd them
to your Highness, and whether he had any Answer
<PB N="322" REF="331"/>
or not: But on the Contrary, we have received cer∣tain
Advice, from several Places, that our Ambas∣sador
has been arrested, that the War against us has
been resolv'd upon at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and Orders
are given for forming an Army at <HI>Bender;</HI> and that
the <HI>Tartars</HI> who are ready to conduct the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> are order'd to enter <HI>Poland</HI> by Force of
Arms; wherefore we thought fit to write this Letter
to your Highness, to exhort you once more to answer
our former Letters, and to let us know whether you
intend to observe the Treaty prolong'd with us last
Year, for 30 Years, confirm'd with several Oaths,
made before the Judge of all our Actions, or to vio∣late
if, without the least Occasion on our Part
given.</P>
<P>We also declare, that in case we receive no Answer
touching your Intention to preserve the Peace, and
that your Highness continues your Military Prepa∣rations,
to conduct the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> through <HI>Po∣land,</HI>
with a powerful Army, we shall look, upon this
as an open Violation of the Truce; and calling God
to our Assistance, shall provide for our own Safety,
and endeavour to repulse our Enemies with the Ar∣my
we have sent upon the Frontier.</P>
<P>In the mean while, if the Rupture of the Peace
be attended with the Effusion of Human Blood, we
declare, before God and Man, that it will not be
our Fault, but that we shall be forc'd to it. We like∣wise
take God to Witness that it was never our In∣tention
to break the Truce, but to observe it religi∣ously
as we promised, wherefore, without Trusting
in any vain Immagination, but only in the supreme
Judge, we hope, he will defend us against all Di∣sturberso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Peace and Violators of Cat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="332"/>
We expect therefore, an Answer to these Pre∣sents
and in case none comes, we shall look. up∣on
it, as a Breach of the Peace: But if we
see by your Highnesses Answer, that your Inten∣tion
is to let us alone, and inviolably to main∣tain
the Peace with us, (the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> be∣ing
sent back, without its being in any wise in∣fringed)
all our Umbrage will Cease.</P>
<P>And as our Army is advancing towards the
Frontiers, without committing any Act of Hosti∣lity,
the Rupture cannot be attributed to us;
the less because, if the Satisfaction that is re∣quir'd
be given us, our Troops shall forthwith with∣draw
from your Neighbourhood, and we will in∣violably
maintain the Truce, with your Highness;
We wish your Highness perfect Health.</P>

of the <HI>Turks</HI> which had encamped at <HI>Adrinople</HI>
some Time, began to advance.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> had a good Army of excellent
Troops, and he had order'd the Horse for some
Time to rendezvous about <HI>Lemberg,</HI> where his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty came soon after in Person, and
advanc'd with them to the Frontiers; they con∣sisted
in about 40000 Horse, and a great Body of
the Horse remain'd about <HI>Jassy,</HI> to secure the
Communication.</P>
<P>WITH this Army, when joyn'd by the Infant∣ry,
the <HI>Czar</HI> advanced; and having an intimate
Correspondence with the Hospodar of <HI>Moldavia,</HI>
he made Conditions with him, to furnish his,
Army with Bread, and other Provisions, and
to give him Passage and Re-passage thro' the
Country.</P>
<P>SOME have said the Hospodar kept a secret
Correspondence with the Grand Vizier, all the
while; and did this on purpose to betray the
<HI>Czar,</HI> but this was grounded on a Mistake; the
Hospodar perform'd his Agreement as long as he
was able to do it without ruining himself, and
all his Affairs; but drew off, when he saw the
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urkish</HI> Army was so much superior to the <HI>Czar,</HI>
that he apprehended a Blow, and that he should
fall into the Hands of the <HI>Turks;</HI> then indeed,
it was to be expected he would act with more
Caution.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, 'tis said, the Hospoder
did perform his Part effectually, as to furnishing
what Provisions the <HI>Czar</HI> requir'd, and that no∣thing
was deficient, but that the Hospodar never
condition'd to furnish Troops, or to draw his
Sword in the Quarrel.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="334"/>
BUT to let that pass, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty set
out from <HI>Jaroslaw,</HI> the 10th of <HI>June,</HI> 1710,
where Matters were concerted between the King
of <HI>Poland</HI> and himself, for mutual Assistance
in this War, after which the King of <HI>Poland</HI>
went away into <HI>Saxony,</HI> to settle his Affairs
in <HI>Germany;</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> went from thence
to <HI>Lemberg,</HI> as above, then the Army; that is to
say, the Cavalry, were order'd to advance to the
<HI>Dneister;</HI> His Majesty joyn'd them near <HI>Kami∣nieck</HI>
and march'd, keeping the River on his
Right, till he came to <HI>Raskow,</HI> on the <HI>Dneister,</HI>
where he was joyn'd by the four Regiments of
his Guards, or Houshold Troops; the rest of the
Infantry coming up in a few Days more, by the
Way of <HI>Bracklaw</HI> and <HI>Czarkassy;</HI> some passing
by <HI>Kiovia,</HI> and some by <HI>Pultowa,</HI> a Place made
famous by the late Overthrow of the King of
<HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the whole Army was brought toge∣her,
they reckon'd them to be 35000 Foot, and
40000 Horse, all choice Troops, especially
the Infantry; 3000 <HI>Turks</HI> posted overagainst <HI>Raskow,</HI>
in order to dispute their Passage Over the <HI>Neither,</HI>
abandon'd their post upon the coming up of 2000
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Grenadiers, who had pass'd in the
Night in some small Boats, at about a League di∣stance,
and out of their Sight.</P>
<P>AS soon as the <HI>Turks</HI> were fled, two Bridges
being laid upon the River, and a small En∣trenchment
at the End of each Bridge, to se∣cure
the Passage, the whole Army passed over
with their Artillery and Baggage.</P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Neister,</HI> the Army advanced to
the <HI>Pruth,</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> went in Person with
5000 Dragoons to <HI>Jassy,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Moldavia;</HI>
<PB N="326" REF="335"/>
to Converse with the Hospodar, and to secure
sufficient Magaziens of <HI>Provisions</HI> which that Coun∣try
and <HI>Wallachia,</HI> being very fruitful, were very
well able to Furnish: Here the <HI>Czar</HI> staying too
long, gave the <HI>Turks,</HI> who where then as far off
as the <HI>Danube,</HI> Time to come up, for the Vizier
hearing that the <HI>Czar</HI> was past the Neister, made
long Marches, fearing the <HI>Russians</HI> should reach
to the Banks of the <HI>Danube</HI> before him, and con∣sequently
should prevent or dispute his Passage,
and perhaps have given him a Blow, if he had
attempted it.</P>
<P>The Vizier was decamp'd from <HI>Adrianople</HI> ac∣cording
to the best Advices, when the <HI>Czar</HI> came
to the Banks of the <HI>Neister;</HI> but had sent a great
Body of his Infantry that they might pass the
Straights of the Mountain <HI>Hemus,</HI> which runs
in a Chain, from the Shore of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Gulph,
thro' <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Thrace,</HI> to the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea;
but as soon as the Vizier had an Account, that
the <HI>Czar</HI> had advanc'd, he put himself in full
March with the Horse, and came to the <HI>Danube,</HI>
the 24th of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>HAD not his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty been delay'd at
<HI>Jassy</HI> too long, but had pass'd the <HI>Pruth</HI> at that
City, and march'd on directly to the <HI>Danube,</HI> he
had certainly carry'd the Point, and the Vizier
had been kept at Bay, at the passing that River;
for he would not have ventur'd to have pass'd
the <HI>Danube,</HI> which is a prodigious great River at
<HI>Silisiria, a little above which he went over,</HI> and the
Stream fierce and Rapid: I <HI>say,</HI> he would not
have ventur'd to pass that River, in the Teeth
of the <HI>Russian</HI> Army; or if he had, he would
have run a great Risque of being defeated.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="336"/>
IT was without doubt, either a Mistake, or a
Misfortune, that his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Army
should Halt upon the <HI>Pruth,</HI> and let the <HI>Turks</HI>
pass the <HI>Danube;</HI> and his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty saw it,
when it was too late; for had the Banks of the
<HI>Danube</HI> been secured, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> must
have shifted his Quarters, and have quitted
<HI>Bender,</HI> with as much Precipitation, almost, as
he did <HI>Pultowa,</HI> and perhaps would have found
it more difficult to have made his Escape.</P>
<P>NOR would the Forces of the <HI>Tartars</HI> have
been so troublesome, if the Grand Army of the
<HI>Turks</HI> had been kept off; for tho' they call'd
the <HI>Tartars</HI> 50000 yet the <HI>Russians</HI> would have
fac'd about, and have made them shift off, as
fast as they came: But when the <HI>Turks</HI> lay at
the <HI>Danube</HI> before, and the <HI>Russians</HI> had their
Hands full of them in their Front, it was easy
for a Body of <HI>Tartars</HI> to do Mischief in the
Rear.</P>
<P>'TIS to no Purpose to enlarge upon what
might have been done, it is our Part to give
the History of what was really done; and the
<HI>Czar</HI> having lost 12 Days Time at <HI>Jassy,</HI> the
Banks of the <HI>Pruth,</HI> the Grand Army of the
<HI>Turks</HI> Pass'd the <HI>Danube</HI> undisturb'd, and advanc'd.
a-pace.</P>
<P>WHILE the <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Russians</HI> were then
facing one another, the <HI>Tartars</HI> by their Inroads
Harrass'd the <HI>Russian</HI> Army, took many Horses,
and killed a great many People, and at last,
effectually cut off their Provissions, sunk or
burnt all the Boats they had on the <HI>Purth,</HI> and
in a Word, being very numerous, they did the
<HI>Russians</HI> a World of Mischief.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="337"/>
THIS brought them to a Battle, for the <HI>Turks</HI>
advancing to the <HI>Pruth,</HI> and the <HI>Russians</HI> seeing
themselves almost reduced to an Extremity, re∣solv'd
to wait their coming and Fight, them;
the Mystery of this Engagement, and of the
sudden Peace which was the Conseuence of it
is not fully known in the World, and perhaps
never may.</P>
<P>THE Sum of the Story, is this; the <HI>Turks</HI> ad∣vancing,
and appearing very numerous, the <HI>Czar</HI>
caused his Men to entrench, believing the Ene∣my
would attack them; as, indeed, they did
the next Day; the Entrenchment which they
attack'd, was Guarded by 12 Battallions of <HI>Mus∣covite</HI>
Infantry, and about 3000 Granediers;
who all together ply'd their Time so well, and
lay'd so many of the Enemy dead upon the
Spot; that the <HI>Janizaries</HI> after a furious Attack,
which la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted four Hours, the Basha's bringing
on fresh Men, as the others were beaten off,
were finally repulsed with great Slaughter; a
Body of Dragoons, who were posted to Support
the Defendants, falling out also upon them in
their Retreat.</P>
<P>THAT Night the Intrenchments were en∣larg'd,
and 10000 Foot, supported by Dragoons,
were posted to defend them; the Enemy came
on again to the Assault, with 20000 <HI>Janizaries,</HI>
supported by a great Body of Horse; the <HI>Russian</HI>
Army stood in Order of Battle in two Lines, in
their Camp, which was also entrench'd; the Fight
was obstinate, and very bloody; the Fury of the
<HI>Turks</HI> not being to be resisted, without great Loss
on the <HI>Russian's</HI> Part also; However, the <HI>Turks</HI>
were again Beaten off; and in these two Days, it
was said, that the <HI>Turks</HI> lost 12000 of their best
Men.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="338"/>
HOWEVER, as the <HI>Turks</HI> still prepar'd to re∣new
their Efforts, as if resolv'd to carry the
Entrenchments, whatever it Cost; and his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty finding the <HI>Tartars</HI> which harraz'd him,
continually in the Rear, had 10000 Foot sent
them from the Viziers Army, and that he should
be in Danger of being quite Surrounded by two
vast Armies of near 100000 Men each; and which
was worse, that his Convoys were cut off by the
<HI>Tartars;</HI> he resolv'd to Retreat; which, however,
was done in such Order, and with such daring
Boldness of Courage, in Sight of the Enemy,
that when the <HI>Turkish</HI> Cavalry, pretended to pur∣sue
them, the Foot fairly faced about, threw
down their <HI>Chevauz de Frieze,</HI> and pour'd in
their Volleys upon the <HI>Turks,</HI> and then Re∣treated.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this retreating fareagu'd the Army
to the last Degree, and the <HI>Tartars</HI> surprizing
a great many of the <HI>Czar's</HI> Horses, added to the
Misfortune, several Regiments of Horse be∣ing
entirely dismounted: So the <HI>Czar</HI> finding a
convenient Situation to Encamp and Entrench,
halted again.</P>
<P>HERE the Vizier came up with the whole
<HI>Turkish</HI> Army, but durst not attack the <HI>Russian</HI>
Camp, the Front being defended by a Morass;
the Right Wing, by a winding Branch of the Ri∣ver
<HI>Pruth;</HI> and the Left, by a Hill, which the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Infantry, had entrenched: The Vizier
seeing this, brings up his Cannon, and Can∣nonaded
them in their Camp, with 50 Pieces of
heavy Artillery; and their Camp lying exposed
to this Battery, there was no hindring it; at the
same Time, they seem'd entirely to be shut in,
by the winding of the River <HI>Pruth,</HI> and the E∣nemy;
<PB N="330" REF="339"/>
so that in short, the Generals began to
look one upon another, as Men desperate, and
at a Loss what to do.</P>
<P>THE Colonels, and inferiour Officers, were
for drawing out the Array, and giving the <HI>Turks</HI>
Battle, and the Common Soldiers cry'd out to
be led against the Enemy, that they might dye
with their Swords in their Hands, and sell their
Lives as dear as they could, rather than be torn
in Pieces with the Cannon, and perish in the
Camp for Want of Provisions: But his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty, who alone was not dismaid at the Cir∣cumstances
he was in, quikly resolv'd what to
do, and order'd a Trumpet with three Officers,
to the Vizier, writing a Letter to the Vizier
himself.</P>
<P>THE Effect of this Message, <HI>what ever the Pro∣posal
was,</HI> answer'd so well what his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty
desir'd, that it produc'd a Treaty; and tho'
it must be confess'd, that the Circumstances of
the <HI>Russian</HI> Army then were such that a De∣feat
was inevitable, except by a desperate Brave∣ry
they could have broke thro' the whole <HI>Turkish</HI>
Army, which being so destitute of Horses, was
next to impossible; yet, as they were all re∣solv'd
to dye with their Emperor, and to sell
their Lives like Men of Honour; the Vizier, who
knew it, must have caused a most bloody Action,
and perhaps might have been ruinous to him also,
thought fit to consider what Proposals were made
and whether the Demands he might make, might
not only save the present Effusion of Blood, but
a future Expence both of Blood and Treasure
to the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="340"/>
UPON this Foot, he Demanded the City of
<HI>Asoph,</HI> which was indeed, a Purchase, which a
whole Campaign, and a good Array could not
have procur'd them; (<HI>some say,</HI> his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty
offer'd the City of <HI>Asoph</HI>) he demanded
also 1200000 Dollars in Money; the first, he
called, the Agreement of Peace; and the second,
he called, the Ransom of the Army; who, he
supposed, to be all as good as his Prisoners, and
consequently Slaves, ready to be sold at Market;
which indeed, as Things stood, was almost the
Case.</P>
<P>THE bringing such a Treaty to Conclusion,
in such an Exigency, was a Master-Piece of
the <HI>Czar</HI>'s own conducting; for on the other
Hand, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> did his utmost to pre∣vent
it, nay, even he reproach'd the Vizier in
the Head of has Army, complaining that he
should give up the Grand Seignior Enemy, when
he was in his Hand, and that in one Day the
<HI>Czar</HI> must be his Prisoner, and all his Army;
and even threatening to represent it to the
Grand Seignior, as to be sure he afterwards did.</P>
<P><HI>I say,</HI> it was a Master Piece indeed, for the
Vizier, by what Means is yet unknown, and per∣haps
will ever be so, continued firm, and repre∣sented
the Advantages of Peace on the Terms
proposed, particularly the restoring of <HI>Asoph,</HI> a
Place, the Loss of which, had been a hear
Breaking to the <HI>Turkish</HI> Court: <HI>I say,</HI> he repre∣sented
this so effectually to the Port, that the
Sultan confirmed the Treaty, and ratify'd it
with great Satisfaction, notwithstanding all the
Representations of some of his Courtiers, who
were against it.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="341"/>
AS for the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the Han of
<HI>Tartary,</HI> they fail'd not, to give a quite diff∣erent
Account of the Thing, representing the
Vizier as Confederate with the <HI>Czar,</HI> to betray
his Master, the Grand Seignior's Interest; and
that he had taken a great Sum of Money to let
the <HI>Czar</HI> escape out of his Hands, when he might
with Ease have carry'd him away in Triumph,
and have deliver'd him up, at the Gate of the
Seven Towers in <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>THIS they aggravated to that Degree after∣wards,
and told their Tale so speciously, that the
Grand Seignior was quite turn'd about in his
Judgment of the Thing, and resented it to the
Ruin of the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> who was strangled
soon after, by Order of his Master, for making
the Treaty, which he himself had approv'd.</P>
<P>BY this Treaty, (the Peace being made) the
<HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and his whole Army, march'd
safe and quietly, to the Bank of the <HI>Dneister,</HI>
and so by easy Marches, into the <HI>Ukraine,</HI> with
all their Cannon and Baggage; and thus ended
this short War, wherein tho' the <HI>Czar</HI> indeed
lost the Honour of the Field, yet he gain'd this
great Point; namely, that the <HI>Turks</HI> abandon'd
the Interest of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> which was
all i. deed, that the War was made for; and
which if they would have done before, the <HI>Czar</HI>
would never have took the Field at all: The
Loss the <HI>Czar</HI> sustain'd in this Battle, was not
much less than 10000 Men, and a prodigious
Number of Horses, some said 30000, but no
Artillery, or Trophies.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty having thus gotten over the main Article, the War with the <HI>Turks;</HI> little
of Moment pass'd for some time, the King of
<PB N="333" REF="342"/>
<HI>Poland</HI> was wholly taken up in settling himself in
his newly restored Kingdom; and the <HI>Czar</HI>
giving his Troops a whole <HI>Winters</HI> Rest, had lei∣sure
to recrute and refresh them, and in particular
to fill them up with Forreigners, <HI>Germans, Scots,
Livonians, Poles,</HI> nay, even with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> them∣selves,
for whole Companies of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who
surrendered at <HI>Pultowa,</HI> and were taken in Bat∣tle
there, and other Places, finding no other
End of their Misfortunes, Listed in the <HI>Czar's</HI>
Service, and were generally employ'd on the
Side of <HI>Cyrkassia,</HI> and <HI>Ukrania,</HI> and such remote
Parts of his Dominions.</P>
<P>THE Articles of Peace, thus agreed upon,
by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> however
they may be thought hard, and worded disho∣nourably
for his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, the Justice due

<P>THE King of <HI>Poland</HI> began this Part of the

and having publish'd a large Manifesto
of his Reasons for it; the <HI>Czar</HI> came in rather as
an Auxiliary than otherwise tho' his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty's

with any of them; this Manifesto stating the Case
of the whole War, I amoblig'd to mention, because
the <HI>Czar</HI> is nearly concern'd in the Consequences,
tho' not in the Reason of that part of the
Quarrel.</P>

HOW great a Regard the most Serene King of
<HI>Poland</HI> has ever had since the Beginning of this
War, to the Friendship of the most Serene <HI>Allies</HI> in
the War against <HI>France;</HI> and what he has done up∣on
that Consideration, must be sufficiently known to
all the World; how also, and often postponing his own
Advantage; he has neglected no Occasion to express
his Inclination and Readiness to promote their In∣trest,
of which, certainly, his Majesty gave an unde∣niable
Instance, in the Year 1709, when the <HI>Swed∣ish</HI>
Troops under General Crassau retir'd from <HI>Po∣land</HI>
into <HI>Pomerania;</HI> it was doubtless his <HI>Polish</HI>
Majesty's Interest, to fall upon his Enemies at that
Time, and give them no time to re-establish their
Forces, in order to disturb again the Kingdom of
<HI>Poland,</HI> or invade the Hereditary Dominions of his
sacred Majesty, or at least to keep them in continual
Apprehensions of an Irruption: These were suffici∣ent
Reasons to induce his Majesty to the Enterprize,
and he had Forces enough to execute it; For, besides
the Army of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania,</HI> the Auxiliary
Troops of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> under General <HI>Goltz,</HI> were at
Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d▪ his Majesty might very well have followed the
Example given him by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> himself,
in the Year 1706, and have pursu'd and attack'd
the <HI>Swedes</HI> in <HI>Pomerania;</HI> but notwithstanding
this appear'd highly necessary for his own Security,
he for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore it of his own accord, at the desire of
the High Allies, making War against <HI>France,</HI> he so
wisely, and prudently directed that Affair, that upon
Condition of a certain and sufficient Guaranty, which
was to be given by the said <HI>Allies;</HI> for the Security
of the co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>federated Princes in the <HI>North,</HI> they alter'd
their Resolution to pursue the Troops under General
<HI>Crassau,</HI> in the Province aforesaid. The <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> and the Republick of <HI>Poland,</HI> caus'd im∣mediately
<PB N="339" REF="348"/>
after, their Minister at Ratisbon and the
<HI>Hague,</HI> to signify, as they did likewise themselves,
by Letters, their good Intentions, for the Confede∣rates
against <HI>France;</HI> adding, however, a Clause, or
Condition, that not only the <HI>Saxon</HI> Territories, but
also the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the <HI>Danish</HI> Pro∣vinces,
afterwards mention'd in the publick Acts of
the <HI>Nutrality,</HI> should be absolutely secur'd against all
Invasion on the part of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> by the Guarant∣y
of the High <HI>Allies,</HI> against <HI>France;</HI> for it would
have been highly unjust in any, to have procured a free
and safe Flight and Retreat for the Enemies above∣said,
and to have refus'd, at the same time to pre∣vent
the Danger that might be apprehended from
them.</P>
<P>This being approv'd, Treaties were set on Foot,
and concerted for that Neutrallity at the <HI>Hague</HI>
and <HI>Ratisbon</HI> in the usual manner, and the most Se∣rene
<HI>Allies,</HI> look'd upon that Affair, at that time,
almost as the Safety and Preservation of the Empire,
and as if the Fate of the whole Common Cause de∣pended
thereupon; the <HI>Confederates</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI>
having the same Notions, accepted the Neutrality,
and by means thereof, bound themselves in some man∣ner
with the <HI>Allies</HI> against <HI>France;</HI> and it was re∣solved,
that if any should act contrary to this Agree∣ment,
that the other, should unite their Forces against
the Infringer of the said Neutrality. The most Se∣rene
King of <HI>Poland</HI> observed religiously what had
been concerted and agreed to, by the <HI>Allies</HI> on both
sides; expecting and confiding, that the King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
would agree, and conform himself to that Con∣vention,
according to the obligatory Declaration of
the Royal <HI>Senate</HI> of <HI>Stockholm,</HI> delivered in a
solemn manner in Writing at the <HI>Hague;</HI> but con∣trary
to the Opinion and Expectation of all, the King
<PB N="340" REF="349"/>
<HI>Sweden</HI> was of a different Opinion, and manifested
the same by Word and Deed, as it is sufficiently
known to the World; be endeavour'd at first, amusse
the most Serene <HI>Allies</HI> in several ways, and set
on Foot a Treaty with them for putting into their Ser∣vice
8000 Men, to be detach'd from the Troops un∣der

was look'd upon as concluded, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e forbid the Senate
of <HI>Stockholm</HI> to part with any Forces for the Ser∣vice
of the <HI>Allies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> Not contented therewith, he augmented his
Army in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> above one half of the
Number the same was at first, by new Levies.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> He caused a considerable Number of Men, to
be brought over, at several Times, from <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
into <HI>Pomerania,</HI> sometimes 500 Men, and
at other times 800.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> He caused several <HI>Danish</HI> Ships belonging to
the Provinces included in the Neutrality, to be
chased by his Men of War, and used in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
manner, breaking thereby the Neutrallity afore∣said.</P>
<P><HI>IV.</HI> After having concluded an Alliance with the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, the Hereditary Enemy of the
<HI>Christian</HI> Name, which cannot be excused; he
did not scruple do declare a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Hague,</HI> and
at the Diet of <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> by a solemn Writing
dated from <HI>Bender,</HI> the 30th of <HI>November,</HI>
1710; that he rejected the Neutrallity aforesaid,
and would not be oblig'd to the same; and the
Baron <HI>de Stralenheim,</HI> his Envoy at the Impa∣rial
Court, had already protested against it, the
11th of August the said Year; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e used there∣in
<PB N="341" REF="350"/>
a harsh Stile, attended with Mennaces, hard∣ly
to be endur'd, as that the Convention for the
said Neutrality was partial (tho' it was for his
Advantage, if he would consider the Thing
Right:) that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e reserv'd to himself an unlimit∣ed
Liberty, to employ his Forces against whomsoever,
and in such Times, and Places, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
should think fit, according to the Laws and
Customs of War; if any one offer'd to hinder
him from pursuing his declared Enemy with his
Arms, he could not but consider him as an Ag∣gresser,
and declare him for such: Which a∣mounts
in Effect, not only to a Declaration of War
against the Confederated Princes in the <HI>North</HI>
in general, and against the most Serene King of
<HI>Poland,</HI> in particular, and a Signification that
he will attack him in the <HI>Polish</HI> Dominions, and
in his Electorate, or, wheresoever he should
think fit; but may be look'd upon also, as a De∣claration
of War against the <HI>Allies,</HI> now in War
against <HI>France;</HI> and an intimation that he will
carry on the same on all Sides, by the help of
his Confederates the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars:</HI> This
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> has express'd in plain
Terms, in his Manifesto dated from <HI>Bender,</HI>
28th of <HI>January,</HI> of this present Year 1711.
which the Palatine of <HI>Kiow</HI> dispersed in <HI>Po∣land,</HI>
attended with an Army of <HI>Barbarians</HI>
and <HI>Infidels,</HI> and which was directly intended
against the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> wherein he declar'd
be has made an Alliance with the <HI>Turks</HI> and
<HI>Tartars,</HI> for that Purpose; But these Threats
will not binder the most Serene <HI>Allies;</HI> against
<HI>France,</HI> from adbearing to the Measures con∣certed,
for maintaining the Neutrality, afore∣said.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="351"/>
<HI>V.</HI> To what has been already said, it must, be ad∣ded,
that the Rebel <HI>Smigielski,</HI> was lately sent
from the <HI>Swedish Pomerania</HI> with a Manifesto
of Count <HI>Lezinski</HI> (who not only continues in
the Country, but is maintain'd therein) and with
some Troops has made an Irruption into the
Country to exhort the <HI>Poles</HI> to Rebellion, and
has actually committed Hostilities against the
Troops of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and when they
were Pursuing him, he retired again into the
<HI>Swedish</HI> Province aforesaid, where he is en∣tertain'd,
and supply'd with Necessaries, by
which Action, this Neutrality has been again
infringed by the <HI>Swedes:</HI> Therefore the most
Serene King of <HI>Poland,</HI> is not only grounded in
Justice, But besides, lies under a pressing Necessity,
to make use of all lawful Means, for eradica∣ting
this Evil, and preventing those Dangers in
their very Source.</P>
<P>There is no Reason to believe, that when the most
Serene <HI>Allies</HI> against <HI>France,</HI> induced the most Serene
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his Allies, to accept, out of
Regard to them, a Neutrality so advantagious to the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> tho' he had rejected it with Scorn,
ever pretend that this Compliance and Readiness of
his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty, should turn to the Ruin of the
Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> and other Provinces belonging to
him; tho' this has, in a great Measure, already hap∣pen'd;
seeing that out of Fear of an Invasion on the
Part of the said <HI>Swedish</HI> Forces in <HI>Pomerania</HI>
Many Subjects of his Majesty have abandon'd their
Country, whereby the Credit of the Merchants amongst
Forreigners, and trade in general, has receiv'd great
Prejudice: besides this Damage; the Expences for
raising new Forces, and equiping them, their
<PB N="343" REF="352"/>
Marches, and Maintenance, with the raising of the
Militia throughout the whole Electorate of <HI>Saxony,</HI>
have not only put the most Serene King of <HI>Poland</HI> to
great Charges, and involv'd him in great Difficulties,
but have also lessen'd very much his Revenues, and
occasion'd many other Losses.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it would be altogether unreasonable,
that the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who has already receiv'd
this Benefit of the Convention of the Neutrality tho'
irreverently rejected by him, in that no Body has pursu'd
the Forces of <HI>Crassau</HI> into <HI>Pomerania,</HI> should conti∣nue
to enjoy the said Neutrality, to the Prejudice of
the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his Allies, in the <HI>North;</HI>
for no Body can be insensible that the <HI>Turkish</HI> War
is founded on the Augmentation of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army
in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and the future Invasion by the same,
of <HI>Poland</HI> or <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>The State of Affairs being such, and the World
being perswaded that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> has so ex∣plain'd
his Mind by Words and Deeds, that nothing
further is to be expected from him; and that on the
other Hand, it appears, after other violent Means of
that King, which were scarce ever heard of before, from
a <HI>Christian</HI> Prince; That the Security of the most
Serene King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his Dominions depends
on the Dispersion of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army in <HI>Pomera∣nia;</HI>
it follows that the most Serene <HI>Allies</HI> against
<HI>France,</HI> are oblig'd to assist him with their Forces,
according to the Tenor of the Convention, and as the
Preservation and Tranquility of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI>
Empire, and the happy Success of the Common Cause
depend, in a great Measure on this Point; the most
Serene King of <HI>Poland</HI> expected that the most Serene
<HI>Allies</HI> against <HI>France,</HI> would have sent their Forces,
design'd for maintaining the said Neutrality, to be
employ'd under his Command, as being the Party of∣offended,
<PB N="344" REF="353"/>
and in Danger; but as they have not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
able hitherto, to execute their good Intentions, as the
Delays of the March of their Troops they had pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ised,
and other Difficulties sufficiently shew; the most
Serene King aforesaid, thinks himself Necessitated to
take without delay, such Measures as are necessary
for his Affairs, and for preventing the Inconvenien∣cies,
and Damages afore-mention'd, and their Conse∣quences;
on the other Hand, the faithful States of
the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> will be no longer uncer∣tain,
as wishing to see the Tranquility of their Coun∣try
settled upon a firm Bottom.</P>
<P>But the Reasons alledg'd here, for the Preserva∣tion
of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI> are not the only Motives
that induce his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty to make use of the
lawful Means aforesaid; but the Tranquility of the
holy <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, whereof the Preservation is
chiefly committed to his Care, at this present time as
<HI>Vicar</HI> thereof, besides the Dignity of Director of the
Circle of <HI>Upper Saxony,</HI> does chiefly require this
from him; especially, seeing it is known that the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> has lately made an Alliance with the King
of <HI>France,</HI> the Tenor of which, could not be kept
a Secret, but that the <HI>Allies</HI> had notice of it: Be∣sides,
it is likewise known, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> in <HI>Pome∣rania</HI>
wait only that the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> may ex∣ecute
his Projects on the <HI>Upper Rhine,</HI> against the
Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, there being no doubt but they
would lay hold of that Opportunity to invade <HI>Saxony,</HI>
and the Provinces of <HI>Germany,</HI> rather than those of
<HI>Poland:</HI> From whence it appears, how necessary it
is to use proper Means in Time, that thro' the Disper∣sion
of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> that Tran∣quility
of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, may be settled,
and preserv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, that the dangerous Machinations,
afore said, may be prevented, and that the Fire hid
<PB N="345" REF="354"/>
under those treacherous Ashes, may be Extinguish'd
therefore no Body can blame the Design of the most
Serene King of <HI>Poland,</HI> to provide for his Security,
and discharge his Office with the Forces God has
given him, and the Assistance of his Allies; Its further
more declared, on the Part of the most Serene King
of <HI>Poland,</HI> that he has no other Intention and De∣sign,
but to procure the Security of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI>
Empire, and his own; and that he is induced to it
that the most Serene <HI>Allies</HI> against <HI>France,</HI> will see
that the most Serene <HI>Allies</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI> have made
such Dispositions, and taken such Measures, that they
will more readily concur therein, and perform what
they are oblig'd to, by their Agreement; and this
happy <HI>Band of UNION</HI> among themselves, which is
hitherto continued may remain in-disoluble to their
Common Advantage.</P>
<P>THO' the King of <HI>Poland</HI> began this Part of
the War, in declaring the Intentions of the Allies,
yet the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> first enter'd the Country,
that Prince perhaps glad to leave his own Domi∣nions,
and his Capital City where the Plague
rag'd, at that Time, most violently, enter'd the
<HI>Swedish Pomerania</HI> with his Army, the 8th of
<HI>August,</HI> 1711. And without any Resistance, that
was considerable, advanced to the Neigbourhood
of <HI>Stralsound.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this was too great an undertaking for the
King of <HI>Denmark's</HI> Army who were not full 20000
Men, without the King of Poland; however
in <HI>September,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> arriv'd, to the Number
of 12000 Men, and the two Armys being thus
joyn'd, they invested <HI>Stralsund:</HI> But <HI>Stralsund</HI>
strong by Situation, and well fortify'd, was too
knotty a Piece of Work, even for both the Kings
<PB N="346" REF="355"/>
united; for they found, that there was no In∣vesting
it effectually, unless the <HI>Isle of Rugen,</HI>
which lies over-against it, should be first reduc'd;
to prevent this, the <HI>Swedes</HI> had in that Island, and
in the City, an Army of old Soldiers, Stronger
in Foot, than both the King's Armies put toge∣ther,
tho' not equal to them in Horse; they like∣wise
found, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> Daily relieved the
Town, by Sea, as they thought convenient;
having a Squadron of Men of War, and Frigats,
always in the Harbour; these Difficulties oblig'd
them at last to raise the Siege, without so much
as carrying on any effectual Attack, or, so much
as offering to Storm any of the Out-works. But
it must be enquir'd a little how they spent their
Time.</P>
<P>IT was the End of <HI>October</HI> before the <HI>Saxon</HI>
Artillery arriv'd in the Camp, as for the <HI>Danes,</HI>
they brought no heavy Cannon along with
them, but had some afterwards, when it was
too late.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, for a great while they amused the
World with their Resolutions to attack the <HI>Isle of
Rugen,</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> who understand Sea Affairs
better than the <HI>Saxons,</HI> contriv'd to make great
Rafts of Timber, on which to transport their
Horse; but the Arrival of some <HI>Swedish</HI> Fregats
who lay at a Distance, and batter'd those Rafts,
and threw Bombs upon them, shew'd the King
of <HI>Poland</HI> that the transporting their Cavalry
in that manner, would be impracticable.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, 12 <HI>Swedes</HI> Men of War
arriv'd on the Back of the Island, and Landed
some Troops, and sent 3 Ships about to <HI>Stralsund,</HI>
laden with Ammunition for the Garrison, and
two more large Ships laden with Corn, which
<PB N="347" REF="356"/>
were <HI>Danish</HI> Ships, that were bringing of Corn to
the <HI>Danish</HI> Army, which was in great want of it,
but they fell into the Hands of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and
the besieged had the Satisfaction of eating the
Bread which was furnish'd for the Besiegers.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Swedish</HI> Captain gave out, that a large
Embarkation of Troops and other Necessaries,
was práeparing at <HI>Carelscroon,</HI> and would sail in a
few Days; this News discourag'd the Besiegers, and
in a Word, Provisions also growing very scarce,
in an exhausted Country, and the Season ad∣vancing,
the Troops separated, and gave over
the Enterprize for that Year. But I should have
mention'd, that before this, a strong Detatch∣ment
of 15000 <HI>Muscovites,</HI> in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Regiments, all
Infantry, arrived in the Camp; and a strong Squa∣dron
of <HI>Danish</HI> Men of War, came to the Back
of the <HI>Island of Rugen,</HI> pretending to support the
Allies in attacking of the Town but it was too late.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was all this while Carry∣ing
on his Interests of one kind or another, on the
Frontiers of <HI>Tartary,</HI> by Negotiations with the
<HI>Turks,</HI> on the Subject of Peace, of which, in its
Place.</P>
<P>HE arriv'd the 24th of <HI>October</HI> at <HI>Torgau</HI> on the
<HI>Elb,</HI> where the Marriage of his eldest and only
Son was solemniz'd with the Princess of <HI>Wolfem∣buttel;</HI>
an happy Match, of an unhappy Son!</P>
<P>THIS Marriage had been concerted for some
Time, but was not consummated till the latter
End of the Year; the View that the <HI>Czar</HI> had in
this Match, was very well lay'd, for as his <HI>Cza∣rish</HI> Majesty always aim'd at the getting a Footing,
by some Means or other, in the Empire of <HI>Germany,</HI>
he did not question but by this Alliance, some
Pretentions might in Time arise, to give him
<PB N="348" REF="357"/>
Room to intermedle on that Side, as afterwards
he try'd again in the Dutchy of <HI>Mecklemberg,</HI> but
both without Success, as shall appear in its
Place.</P>
<P>BUT ro return to the Siege of <HI>Straelsund,</HI> the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Infantry having joyn'd the Confede∣rate
Army, and the <HI>Danish</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> Artillery
being all arriv'd, and a <HI>Danish</HI> Squadron of Men
of War superiour to the <HI>Swedish,</HI> the World ex∣pected
they would go on with Success; but we
shall see this Part reserv'd for a further Exercise of
their Patience.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Danes</HI> indeed, out did themselves on this
Occasion, at Sea; for their Fleet consisted, if
we may believe the List they publish'd, of 36
Men of War of the Line of Battle, from 50
Guns the least, to 110 Guns the highest, and
eight Fregats; but we shall never see them fit
out such a Fleet again, neither were these all at
Sea together; nor were those that were out fully
mann'd for an Engagement: However, the <HI>Swedes</HI>
had no Fleet able to look these in the Face,
so that their Affairs, had they managed them
rightly, were in a fair way, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> must
have yielded up the Town. Their Troops
were as follows.</P>
<LIST>

<ITEM>and Dragoons 5000</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THIS was a great Army, had they been well
apply'd, and well supply'd, but the Season of the
Year was too far gone; they had used the Coun∣try
ill at their first coming, especially the <HI>Danes,</HI>
so that if the poor People who would have supp∣ly'd
them, had neither Corn nor Forrage left
them to bring to the Camp; in a Word, the
Country was Exhausted, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> at the
Beginning scour'd the Seas so, that nothing could
come that Way; for the <HI>Danes</HI> Fleet came too
late, and when 'twas to no Purpose to open
Trenches, the whether being Cold, and begining
to freez; this made their Soldiers dye and defert
for meer Want, and the Severity of the Weather
and service; so that the <HI>Danes</HI> Foot were reduc'd
to a Handful, the Cavalry was ruin'd and the
Horse starv'd; and in a Word, the <HI>Danes</HI> did not
march off above 9000 effective Men, <HI>as we were
told,</HI> out of 21800 they brought with them as
above.</P>
<P>AS for the <HI>Russian</HI> Troops they came late, but
they brought some Stores with them, which assist∣ed
them, and yet they suffer'd very much too,
and were extremly fateigu'd with long Mar∣ches.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Siege, as the Difficul∣ties
and Hardships the Troops indured were
great, so their Councils were divided; the ablest
Generals were of Opinion, to raise the Siege, hold
the Place block'd up during the <HI>Winter,</HI> and At∣tack
it early in the Spring with 60000 Men;
others were for carrying it on, whatever it cost;

and to that Purpose to send for more Troops,
and both the Kings were really loath to break
up the Siege, especially, while the <HI>Danish</HI> Fleet
was so strong, and the <HI>Swedish</HI> Fleet durst not
appear.</P>
<P>BUT a new Piece of Advice alter'd their
Measures, the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> had Advice that
the <HI>Swedes</HI> prepar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a great Fleet of Transports
at <HI>Carelscroon,</HI> with a Convoy of 28 Capital
Men of War, and that they Shipp'd 18000 Men,
on Board this Fleet, under the Command of Count
<HI>Stienboch,</HI> a Name terrible to the <HI>Danes;</HI> this
brought the King immediately to consider, how
naked he had left his Capital City, the Army
and Fleet being all here; and that if the <HI>Swedes</HI>
should go directly to <HI>Copenbagen,</HI> they would ruin
him at once, while he was pushing a foreign
Project.</P>
<P>WITH this Apprehension, which was very
just in it self; the <HI>Danish</HI> Fleet was sent back to
the Coast of <HI>Denmark,</HI> except some Fregates
left to Cruise before the <HI>Isle of Rugen,</HI> and the
Strait at <HI>Straelsund,</HI> to prevent Succours being
brought to the Garrison.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who shew'd themselves, on
this Occasion, appear'd in the Beginning of
<HI>December</HI> upon the Back of <HI>Rugen,</HI> where the
Transports immediately Landed about 8000
Men with a great Quantity of Ammunition, a
Train of Artillery, and Store of Provisions for
the Besieged, and immediately stood back again
for the Coast of <HI>Sweden,</HI> to fetch more Troops,
which, however they did not bring at that
Time.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="360"/>
IN this Posture, Things stood till the End of
<HI>December,</HI> when the two Kings finding they
should but ruin their Armies, and perhaps fail
in their Enterprize at last, resolv'd to break up
the Siege; and accordingly the Troops de∣camp'd
the 17th of <HI>January;</HI> and we shall find
this difficult Work reserv'd for the power∣ful
Assistance, and Councils of the <HI>Czar</HI> in
Person.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Beginning of <HI>November</HI> this Year,
the Hereditary Prince of <HI>Mouscovy,</HI> with his new
Bride, the Princess of <HI>Wolfembuttle,</HI> set out from
her Father the Dukes Court, on their return
to <HI>Petersburgh;</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> at the same time came to
meet them at <HI>Koningsberg</HI> in the <HI>Royal Prussia,</HI> the
19th, where he was magnificently treated by the
Duke of <HI>Holstien Sonderburgh</HI> Governor of <HI>Purssia,</HI>
who went to receive him at <HI>Fredericksburg,</HI> on
the Frontiers of that Dutchy; they all return'd
to <HI>Petersburgh</HI> in <HI>December,</HI> where the Princess
(<HI>afterwards unhappy!</HI>) was treated by the <HI>Czar</HI>
himself, with great Affection aud Tenderness:
But we shall say more of this Affair hereafter,
perhaps in a Treatise by it self.</P>
<P>WHILE these things were in agitation, the
<HI>Turks</HI> began to discover some uneasiness at the
<HI>Russians</HI> not having perform'd the Articles of the
late Peace, particularly that, about the Surren∣der
of <HI>Asopb,</HI> and the withdrawing the <HI>Russian</HI>
Troops out of <HI>Poland;</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> had, indeed, de∣sired
to have the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI> Passage settled
first, for his Return to his own Dominions; but
the <HI>Turks</HI> were positive, and insisted that the
manner of his Return was not any Part of the
Condition, upon which the evacuating of <HI>Asopb</HI>
was stipulated.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="361"/>
AFTER many Debates on either Side, the
<HI>Czar</HI> not having the least Apprehensions of the
manner of his Return, one Way or other, re∣solv'd
to perform his Part of the Treaty; and
accordingly order'd all the additional Works at
<HI>Asoph</HI> to be demolish'd, and the royal Fort over∣against
it with the magnificent Bridge, the most
beautiful Building in that Part of the World, to
be all blown up in the Air, and the Town to be
put in the same Posture at was before, and then
gave it up to three Bassa's, who were sent with
some Troops from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to receive it; at
the same time, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty declared to
the Court of the Grand Seignior, that he would
oppose the <HI>Turks</HI> by Force, if they offer'd to
send back the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> either through his
Dominions, or through the King of <HI>Poland's</HI>
Country with an Army, or with more than
5000 Horse, the Number proposed; and thus
ended that knotty Business, the only Action
of his Life, which the <HI>Czar</HI> had brought to
Account of Loss, where he led his Armies in
Person having never been personally defeated
before.</P>
<P>I must now look back again to <HI>Pomerania,</HI>
to lay a Foundation of some great Actions, which
will bring his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty into the Field on
this Side of the World, where he was, perhaps,
least expected: The Siege of <HI>Straelsund</HI> was raised,
as has been observ'd, and the two Kings of <HI>Den∣mark</HI>
and <HI>Poland</HI> gone Home, and their Troops
put into <HI>Winter</HI> Quarters. In this Interval, the
<HI>Swedes</HI> brought over more Troops; and together
with those already there, form<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a considerable
Army and that, such a one, as they threaten'd
to invade their Enemies with, on every Side,
<PB N="353" REF="362"/>
and particularly, they were greatly alarm'd
with the Apprehensions of them in <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>THIS made his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, at the pres∣sing
Instances of the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and
<HI>Poland,</HI> prepared for an early Campaign, and
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty resolv'd to be there also
in Person; accordingly 25000 <HI>Russians,</HI> of the
choicest of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Army, began
their March so early, that they were upon
the Frontiers of <HI>Pomerania</HI> by the End of <HI>April;</HI>
the <HI>Danes</HI> were longer, because their Naval Pre∣parations
seem'd to take them up, almost entir∣ely;
being resolved to support the next Years Enter∣prize,
with such a Fleet, as that the <HI>Swedes</HI> should
not dare to show themselves at Sea to interrupt
them; but we shall soon see the Effect.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Swedes</HI> in the Mean time had Ship'd off
so many Troops, and such a Prodigious Quanti∣ty
of Arms and Amunition, that they began to
threaten to take the Field with an Army; and
yet to leave the Cities of <HI>Stetin</HI> and <HI>Straelsund</HI>
with sufficient Garrisons to defend themselves in
Case of an Attack; they had also put a sufficient
Number of Troops into <HI>Wismar,</HI> which the <HI>Danes</HI>
had in vain block'd up, the Year before: The
King of <HI>Prussia</HI> was pleased so far to favour this
War against <HI>Sweden,</HI> that he gave Passage to
Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Russian</HI>
Army, and to his Troops in their March for <HI>Po∣merania,</HI>
and the said Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> pass'd by
<HI>Koningsburgh,</HI> the 15th of <HI>April,</HI> 1712.</P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> had now been allarm'd for several Months
with the News that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at <HI>Bender,</HI>
by his own Interest, and by the Solicitation of the
Cham of <HI>Tartray,</HI> had prevailed with the Grand
Seignior to break again with the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
<PB N="354" REF="363"/>
and to renew the War; and so much there was
of truth in it, that the <HI>Turks</HI> made several ex∣travagant
Demands, and that with some Mena∣ces
added to them, which were, (however, insisted
on) yet very unjust, but as his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
had in the first Place, perform'd the last Treaty
in every Part of it; and more-over, that Ways
and Means were found oat to bring over the
Cham of <HI>Tartary,</HI> from the Interest of the King
of <HI>Sweden:</HI> A new Treaty was set on Foot, at
<HI>Corstantinople,</HI> which was at length finish'd, and
sign'd, the principal Articles are as follows.</P>
<P>I. THAT the <HI>Czar</HI> shall be oblig'd within 30
Days to withdraw all his Forces out of <HI>Po∣land,</HI>
which shall not return thither upon any
Pretence whatsoever, unless it should happen that the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> being return'd into his Dominions,
should joyn with the <HI>Poles</HI> and attack <HI>Muscovy</HI>
on that Side, in which Case his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
shall be at Liberty to march again into <HI>Poland</HI> with
his <HI>Troops.</HI></P>
<P>II. That the <HI>Port</HI> shall be allow'd to procure the
Return of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> into his Dominions,
by such Ways as the Grand Seignior shall think fit,
without allowing the <HI>Muscovites</HI> to fix the Time of
his Departure, or his Way; but in case that
Prince marches through the Territories of <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Troops that shall attend him,
shall commit no manner of Hostilities or Ravages.</P>
<P>III. That the <HI>Czar</HI> shall remain in Possession of
<HI>Kiou</HI> and <HI>Ukrania,</HI> with their ancient <HI>Limits,</HI> but
shall renounce all his Pretentions to the Country of
<PB N="355" REF="364"/>
the Cossacks on this side of the <HI>Borifthenes,</HI> that
are not in the Dependance of <HI>Kiof,</HI> and on a certain
Island in that River, and that good Orders shall be
given on both sides, to prevent the Excursions of the
<HI>Cossacks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>IV. That for the Future, no Fortress shall be
erected between the two Frontier Places of Asoph
and <HI>Ciraski</HI> by either of the Parties, and that the
Forts erected by the <HI>Muscovites</HI> in the Teritories of
Asoph shall be demolish'd in four Months, but that
the Grand Signior shall be at Liberty to rebuild
the Fort of <HI>Cinoli,</HI> over-against Asoph.</P>
<P>V. That whereas by the Articles of the Treaty
concluded at <HI>Moldavia,</HI> it was stipulated that <HI>Asoph</HI>
should be restor'd in the same Condition that it was in
when the <HI>Muscovites</HI> took it, and that it appears
that there were then in that Place 60 Pieces of Brass
Cannon, which have not been found therein when it
was restor'd; his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty shall be obliged to
restore the said Artillery, or pay the Value thereof,
and the <HI>Turks</HI> shall deliver to the <HI>Muscovites</HI> the
Iron Cannon that they have left in that Place.</P>
<P>VI. That none of the Parties shall be allow'd
to erect any Forts at <HI>Comenski</HI> and <HI>Savar,</HI> which
by Virtue of the Treaty of <HI>Moldavia</HI> have been de∣molish'd.</P>
<P>VII. That the Peace shall be continu'd 25 Years,
to reckon from the signing of the Treaty, but may
be prolonged before that time is elapsed; and lastly,
that after the Ratification of the present Treaty,
the <HI>Czar</HI> shall be allow'd to send an Ambassador to
Constantinople to receive the same, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BY the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> the <HI>Russian</HI> Troops
arriv'd in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> commanded by Prince <HI>Men∣zikoff,</HI>
and encamped at <HI>Schweds,</HI> having there
<PB N="356" REF="365"/>
a Bridge over the <HI>Oder,</HI> being the same Place
where <HI>Gustav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Adolphus,</HI> the Great King of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
encamp'd, when he reduced that Country;
but notwithstanding all this, the <HI>Danes</HI> did not
appear, and in a Word, the <HI>Czar</HI> was fain to re∣mit
them 90000 Crowns before they could stir
out of their Quarters: With this Relief, the King
of <HI>Denmark</HI> came to his Army at <HI>Itzhoe</HI> the 10th
of <HI>July,</HI> and when all the World expected him
to march Into <HI>Pomerania</HI> to joyn the <HI>Russian</HI> and
<HI>Saxon</HI> Armies, his <HI>Danish</HI> Majesty turn'd his
Arms another Way, and passing the <HI>El<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> enter'd
the Dutchy of <HI>Bremen,</HI> then-under the Govern∣ment
of Count <HI>Welling</HI> for the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI>
and not to enter into that Part of the Story too
far, he reduced it entirely, and with it the Coun∣try
of <HI>Verden,</HI> and afterwards Morgag'd them to
the King of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> which will give
Occasion of farther History to relate the Affair
which attended that Mortgage.</P>
<P>THIS Attempt was a Diversion, however, to
the Arms of <HI>Sweden;</HI> as was also the Attack of
<HI>Wismar,</HI> which the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and the
<HI>Hanover</HI> Troops, for the King of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI>
as Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> had declared
against <HI>Sweden</HI> also, held block'd up a great
while.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Affair of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty arrived in that Country the
26th of <HI>July,</HI> and it was time to enter upon
Action.</P>
<P>I cannot omit, in this Place, (tho' it be a
Transition at once, from the <HI>Baltick</HI> Shore, to
the <HI>Black Sea</HI>) to mention that the good Under∣standing
at this time settled between the <HI>Turks</HI>
and the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mascovy,</HI> was so firm and pro∣mising,
<PB N="357" REF="366"/>
notwithstanding all the Mannagement
of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and his Friends, that no∣thing
could be better establish'd; and the World
wat surpriz'd to hear that the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Resident
at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> had made a formal Rejoycing,
or Festival in that City, on the Birth-Day of
his Master, the <HI>Czar;</HI> this being what was not
usually allow'd by the <HI>Turks</HI> to any Princes Am∣bassadors,
was done the more publickly now,
that the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> might see that the great
Boast that the <HI>Swedes</HI> had made of the powerful
Interest that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had at <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI>
was really nothing in Substance, and
that the <HI>Turks</HI> shew'd all posible Honours to
the <HI>Russian</HI> Ambassador: The Particulars of this
Rejoycing are very remarkable, as follows.</P>
<P>“The 10th of this Month being the Festival of
St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the first being the Name
of the <HI>Czar,</HI> the Baron de <HI>Schapfir of,</HI> Vice-Chancellor
of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, his Privy-Councellor,
and his Ambassador Extraordina∣ry
and Plenipotentiary at the Port, gave a great
Entertainment upon that Account, and also for
celebrating the Anniversary of the famous Bat∣tle
of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> tho' he had already observ'd
the same two Days before with Illuminations in
his House. All the Ambassadors residing here
were invited to the same, as were also the
Resident of the Emperor, the Vicar of the
Pope, the Secretaries of Ambassadors, and
the chief Merchants of all Nations, so that
there was an Appearance of above 100 Per∣sons,
for whom there were seven Tables,
and they were treated with an extraordinary
Magnificence. During the Entertainment
<PB N="358" REF="367"/>
there was a fine Consort of Vocal and Instru∣mental
Musick, and after the same, the Com∣pany
was entertained with a Comedy in the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Tongues. The Secretary
Interpreter of the Ambassy, pronounced after∣wards
the Panegyrick of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
in <HI>Latin,</HI> and another Gentleman recited some
Epigrams on the subject of the Feast, to the
Satisfaction of the Company, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Col∣lonels
of the Jannizaries of the Guard, had
caused the Doors of the House of the Ambassa∣dors
of that Prince to be adorn'd with Festoons
of Palm, Lawrel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Civility the
Vice Chancellor afore-said, acknowledg'd with
a Present. The Windows of the Honse were
illuminated at Night with Emblems of the He∣roick
Actions of the <HI>Czar;</HI> and there was a
Fire-work representing the Arms of that
Prince, his Name in Cyphers, and the Town of
<HI>Pultowa</HI> with proper Descriptions. On the
side of that Fire there were two Decorations,
each representing two Hearts united, and upon
one there were this Inscription, <HI>Long live the
Emperor</HI> Perer I. <HI>and the Empress</HI> Catherina;
and on the other, <HI>Long live the Prince Imperial</HI>
Alexis, <HI>and the Princess Imperial</HI> Charlote. These
two Decorations continued illuminated all
Night, and the two Nights following, and the
Feast concluded with a B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, which lasted till the
next Morning, and during the same there was
a magnificent Collation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Fire-work
and the Illuminations were expresly noted in
the Consent given by the Port to that Enter∣tainment,
which has been seldom allow'd to any
Foreigm Ministers, and especially in <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI>
which sheweth the Value the <HI>Turks</HI> put
<PB N="359" REF="368"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upon the Friendship of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, and
their Esteem for his Ministers.”</P>
<P>BUT to return to <HI>Pomerania,</HI> where the <HI>Czar</HI>
and King <HI>Augustus,</HI> now commanded in Person,
as above, the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> being employ'd
in the Reduction of <HI>Bremen,</HI> as before; yet the
<HI>Danish</HI> Fleet put to Sea in aid of the <HI>Pomeranian</HI>
War, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> having been at Sea, to bring
over Troops of Reinforcement to the <HI>Isle of Ru∣gen,</HI>
the <HI>Danes</HI> attack'd them in their Return,
and had a sharp Fight, but the <HI>Swedes</HI> having
done their Business, made a rnnning Fight over
to their own Coast, and the <HI>Danes</HI> could do no
more but fall in among the Transports, of which
they destroy'd near 20: However, the <HI>Danes,</HI> to
keep their Reputation a-float; which, as to their
War with the <HI>Swedes</HI> shrunk very low, the <HI>Swedes</HI>
always beating them, cry'd this up for a great
Victory: But this has not been his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty's
Method to boast of Victory, when he had
won nothing from his Enemy; the Truth is, if
any had the Victory, it was the <HI>Swedes,</HI> for they
did their Business, <HI>viz.</HI> landed their Troops;
and their Business then, was not to Fight, but
to go back to fetch more, which they also did,
notwithstanding all the <HI>Danes</HI> could do.</P>
<P>HAD the <HI>Danes</HI> met them at Sea, with their
Army on Board, and fought them then, had they
either sunk or taken any of the Men of War, or
hinder'd their going to land the Troops, and
made them go back again with them to their
own Coast, there had been a Victory indeed;
but as it was, the boasting of a Victory, because
the Swedes declin'd a close Engagement, and
<PB N="360" REF="369"/>
the taking a few empty Transports was rather
a Gasconade than any thing else.</P>
<P>THE Troops which the <HI>Swedes</HI> landed amount∣ed
to 2000 Horse, and 7000 Foot, Which added
to the Forces they had before, made the At∣tempt
upon that Island appear impracticable,
and so the <HI>Czar</HI> and the King of <HI>Poland</HI> lay'd
the Thought of it aside, for that Year also,
while the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Rugen</HI> is not reduc'd.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty therefore, finding no∣thing
considerable could be done more, and his
Affairs calling his Majesty to <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> he left
the Army the 7th of <HI>October,</HI> under the Com∣mand
of Prince <HI>Galiczin;</HI> but with Direction
to obey in all things, the Orders of King <HI>Au∣gustus.</HI></P>
<P>THE Army was then so posted, as to hold
both <HI>Stralsond</HI> and <HI>Wismar</HI> block'd up all the
<HI>Winter;</HI> which contributed greatly to the further
Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tressing the Enemy, who, notwithstanding
their Reinforcement, could do nothing considera∣ble,
till they had yet another Embarkation of
Troops from <HI>Sweden,</HI> as we shall see pre∣sently.</P>
<P>BUT now we must come in its Turn to do
Justice to our Enemies, and to shew what Mea∣sures
they took, in the Prosecution of this War:
The <HI>Czar</HI> who was the Life of the War, being
gone, and the Armies being left, as I have said,
to the Order of King <HI>Augustus,</HI> the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who
were now grown strong by the arriving of the
Succours above named, transported their Troops
over from the <HI>Isle of Rugen</HI> to <HI>Stralsond,</HI> and
Count <HI>Steenbock</HI> who commanded them, form'd
an Army of 18000 Men in the Plain, under the
Cannon of <HI>Stralsond,</HI> and began to threaten to
<PB N="361" REF="370"/>
act offensively; nor were the <HI>Russian</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI>
Army in the best Condition to receive them, ha∣ving
been much diminish'd and fateigu'd by the
Service, and much want of Provisions besides.
If Count <HI>Steinbock</HI> had resolv'd to attack them,
so near Hand, he could have drawn eight or nine
thousand Men more out of the Garrisons of
<HI>Stralsond, Gripswald,</HI> and other Places, which he
could not do when he should march farther from
their own Territories.</P>
<P>THINGS standing thus, King <HI>Augustus</HI> and the
<HI>Russian</HI> General Count <HI>Galiczen,</HI> order'd their Posts
to be intrenched, and the several Passes by
which the <HI>Swedes</HI> might march out, to be forti∣fy'd
with very good Lines and Redoubts, and
posted their Troops in them to oppose their
Enemies.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Swedes</HI> are allow'd to be a daring and
Enterprizing People, so their Generals are uni∣versally
Men that understand their Business, and
want no military Experience: Count <HI>Steinbock</HI>
being now once more at the Head of an Army,
and <HI>Pomerania</HI> being no Place to subsist them in
at this Time, When it was so exhausted by other
Troops, that it starv'd its own Inhabitants, he
resolv'd to push out, and try the Fortune of the
Field; accordingly he began his March the 3d
of <HI>November,</HI> and having forc'd the Pass of <HI>Dam∣garten,</HI>
which the frighted <HI>Saxons</HI> quited, and let
him pass by, much too cheap; he entered the
County of <HI>Mecklemburgh</HI> with his whole Ar∣my,
the 6th, and marched directly towards <HI>Wismar.</HI></P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY upon this News, away run the
<HI>Danes,</HI> who had roosted all the <HI>Summer</HI> at <HI>Rostock,</HI>
and other <HI>Danish</HI> Regiments likewise; who car∣ry'd
<PB N="362" REF="371"/>
on the Blockade of <HI>Wismar</HI> marched off with
the greatest Precipitation, nor to hazard their
Rear, which the Garrison press'd upon, but were
disappointed.</P>
<P>THE Dominions of <HI>Denmark</HI> upon the Conti∣nent
were allarm'd at this March, and the King
of <HI>Denmark,</HI> whose Troops lay about <HI>Hamburgh,</HI>
from which City they had, drawn about 260000
Rix Dollars, began to gather togther, and to ad∣vance
for fear of being cut off from joyning
their <HI>Allies</HI> the <HI>Russians,</HI> without whom, they
were not able, as will appear presently, to look
their Enemies in the Face.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Denmark</HI> hasten'd likewise to
his Army, he left <HI>Gottorp</HI> the 19th, and having
joyn'd General <HI>Schoult</HI> and all his Troops, ad∣vanc'd
to meet the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who were as forward
as his Majesty to come to Action: This Excur∣sion
of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> as it relates to the War, in
which his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was so much concern'd,
cannot be omitted here, or the Acton which fol∣low'd
it, because it would render the History of
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty uncompleat, the <HI>Czar</HI> having
acted in it presently afterwards in Person,
with all his Army; the Story of the Excursion
of the <HI>Swedes</HI> is absolutely Necessary, that it
may appear how ill the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> did their
Part; for certainly, if they had done their Duty
at the Pass of <HI>Damgarten,</HI> which they pretended
to Guard, and which, as will appear by the Ac∣count
following, a few Troops well disposed,
might have defended, the <HI>Swedes</HI> could never have

follow'd, and if the <HI>Czar</HI> had not afterwards

<HEAD>From the Head Quarters of Count Steinbock at
Ribitz, <DATE>November 5. 1712.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>“ALL the Troops that were in the <HI>Island
of Rugen,</HI> having been brought over to
<HI>Straelsund</HI> the 30th past, in the Evening, with
their Baggage, Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> Commander
in Chief of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army, took his Leave
the next Day of the Garrison and Burghers of
<HI>Straelsund,</HI> who were drawn up in Arms, to
whom he made a pathetick Speech, wherein he
exorted them to continue Faithful to their So∣vereign
and Country, and be Vigilant in their
several Stations for the Preservation of that
Place. The same Night he gave Orders to the
Generals of the Army, and the next Day the
Troops began to move, it being given out, that
they were to attack the Lines of the Enemy
before <HI>Straelsund.</HI> The general Disposition of
their March was as follows; Lieutenant Gene∣ral
<HI>Ducker,</HI> who commanded the Van-Guard,
consisting of the Cavalry of the Dutchy of
<HI>Bremen,</HI> and the Dragoons of <HI>Marderfeldt</HI> and
<HI>Stromfeldt,</HI> with nine Pieces of Cannon, was
to march with all Speed towards <HI>Damgarten,</HI> to
take Post there, and lay Bridges over that Ri∣ver,
before the Enemy could draw their Troops
<PB N="364" REF="373"/>
together, and hinder the <HI>Swedes</HI> from passing
the same; and as the Success of the whole
Enterprize depended in a great Measure on
the Secrecy and Expedition of the March of
this Body; Care had been taken for three Days
together, that none should go out of <HI>Strael∣sund</HI>
or the Camp, to inform the Enemy there∣with.
General <HI>Ducker</HI> with his Detatch∣ments,
continu'd all that Night at <HI>Ribbartz,</HI>
from whence the Adjutant General <HI>Leppenon</HI>
was detatch'd with 200 Men toward <HI>Frautz∣bergh</HI>
to observe the Motions of the Enemy
behind their Lines, and give timely Notice
thereof. Lieutenant General <HI>Taube</HI> with the
Cavalry of the Province of <HI>Westergothland,</HI> a
<HI>Pomeranian</HI> Regiment of Horse, and one of
Foot of Colonel <HI>Ekeblad</HI> encamped that Night
at <HI>Karnin,</HI> having under him Major General
<HI>Ashenberg.</HI> This was the Body of Battle, and
the Rear commanded by Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> him∣self,
and under him by Major General <HI>Patkul,</HI>
consisted of the rest of the Horse, Foot and
Artillery. These were followed by 1500
Boors, carrying Deal Boards and other Matte∣rials
to lay Bridges. The Roads being very
bad by Reason of Rainy Weather, the Rear of
the Army could not march from Noon till the
Evening, above one League, and encamped at
Pyts. King <HI>Stanisla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> came after the Rear
with his Retinue, The 2d, Lieutenant Gene∣ral
<HI>Ducker</HI> advanced to <HI>Damgarten,</HI> where he
took Post, and marched immediately through a
Defile to a small Fort, or Redoubt, the Enemy
had erected on the other Side near <HI>Ribnitz,</HI>
which he took Sword in Hand, whereby the
Enemy had many Men kill'd and Wounded.
<PB N="365" REF="374"/>
Lieutenant General <HI>Taube</HI> continu'd at <HI>Kar∣nin</HI>
till Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> came up with the
Rear, and then they march'd together to <HI>Lan∣gen-Hansagen.</HI>
The following Day, being the
3d Instant, they march'd by Break of Day to
<HI>Damgarten,</HI> where all the Troops joyn'd about
Noon, the General taking his Quarters at <HI>Blom∣monsdorf</HI>
on the River <HI>Ribnits,</HI> within a Quar∣ter
of a League of that Place. That River
has on both sides a long and deep Morass, which
especially on the side of <HI>Mecklemburgh</HI> was said
to be unpassable even for Cattle tho' in the hot∣test
Summer; but however, Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> re∣solved
to try whether his Troops could go over it
or no. In order thereunto, he commanded Boards
and Planks to be joyn'd together, to serve
instead of Bridges over such Places as should
appear too deep to be pass'd otherwise, and
posted 400 Foot with 8 Field Pieces, on the
Banks of the River to cover the Men who
were sent before to take a View of the Morass,
and to see which way it might be more con∣veniently
pass'd over. The Enemy who ob∣serv'd
these Motions, posted about 1000 Horse,
on the other side of the Morass, but were ob∣lig'd
to quit that Post by the extraordinary Fire,
that was made from the Field Pieces afbresaid,
and retire into the Wood. The <HI>Swedes</HI> posted
at <HI>Damgarten</HI> fir'd also upon them, and they
had above 90 Men kill'd and wounded. The
General order'd the Pontons to be brought
down the River, with other Materials for Brid∣ges
over the said Morass, and at <HI>Damgarten,</HI>
which were finish'd that Night. The Generals
being call'd together, Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> gave
them the following Directions for the next
<PB N="366" REF="375"/>
Day. Lieutenant General <HI>Ducker</HI> was order'd
to pass over the Bridge laid at <HI>Damgarten,</HI>
with six Pieces of Cannon and the Vanguard
of the Army, consisting of the Regiments of
Dragoons of <HI>Marderfeldt</HI> and <HI>Stromfeldt,</HI>
the Cavalry of <HI>Westergothland</HI> and <HI>Bremen,</HI>
and the Regiments of Foot of <HI>Ekebladt,
Schultz,</HI> and <HI>Elf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>org;</HI> while Count <HI>Steinboch</HI>
himself and Lieutenant General <HI>Taube</HI> with the
rest of the Foot and eight Field Pieces should
pass the River and Morass by <HI>Blommendorf.</HI>
The rest of the Cavalry was order'd, if pos∣sible,
to march after them; but in case they
found it too long and difficult, they were order'd
to pass over the Bridge of <HI>Damgarten,</HI> under
the Command of the Majors General <HI>Ashenberg;</HI>
and <HI>Mereschal.</HI> The 400 Foot posted on the
Bank of the River aforesaid, under the Com∣mand
of Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Slippenback</HI> and
Major <HI>Lewenhaupt,</HI> were order'd to march first
of all over the Morass, and take Post on the
other side. These were to be follow'd by the
Detatchment who carry'd the Planks and
Bridges designed to be laid over the deep or un∣passable
Places of the said Morass. Major Ge∣neral
<HI>Patkul</HI> was to march next with the Regi∣ments
of <HI>Sudermania, Dalecarlia,</HI> and <HI>Wester∣gotbland.</HI>
These were to be follow'd by the
Prince <HI>de la Gardic,</HI> who brought up the Rear
with the Regiments of <HI>Ostergothland, Westman∣land,
Helfinge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and the two Regiments of the
Provinces of <HI>Narike</HI> and <HI>Wermerland.</HI> Lieu∣tenant
General <HI>Cronstedt</HI> was order'd to follow
the Infantry with the Artillery, but if he did
not find it practicable, he was commanded to
march after the Cavalry by <HI>Damgarten.</HI> Col∣lonel
<PB N="367" REF="376"/>
<HI>Rozen</HI> with 600 Horse and 500 Foot was
order'd to guard the Avenues to <HI>Damgarten,</HI>
that the Enemy might not attack the Baggage
which was sent thither. Adjutant General <HI>Lop∣penon</HI>
with his 200 Horse came the same Night
from <HI>Frautsbergh,</HI> and reported that the Enemy
were quiet in their Lines, and he had met only
with a Party of <HI>Hussars</HI> of whom he had kill'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix. According to the Dispositions aforesaid,
the March begun the following Day, the Sol∣diers
carrying along with them Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks and all
the Doors they could get from the Houses, and
besides every other Man carry'd a Fascine to fill
such Holes as they should meet in their way,
whereby not only the Infantry but even the
Artillery pass'd in good Order over the Morass,
Which as it has been said before, was thought
impassable even for the Cattle in the <HI>Summer</HI>
Time. The General seeing there was no Ene∣my
to oppose him on the other side of the Mo∣rass,
order'd the Cavalry to pass over the
Bridge at <HI>Damgarten,</HI> and the whole Army be∣ing
on the other side in the Country of <HI>Mack∣lenburgh,</HI>
was drawn up in Order of Battle,
and made a general Salvo of their 8 Field
Pieces and small Arms for this happy Success
in their Passage, without the Loss of one Man,
and which has rendred useless the strong Lines
on which the Enemy have been employ'd about
a Year. The Prince of <HI>Weyssenfeldt,</HI> who com∣manded
3000 Men on that side, retired to∣wards
<HI>Rostock,</HI> but not thinking himself Safe
in that Place retired farther, and Colonel <HI>Bas∣se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itz</HI>
was sent to take Possession thereof.”</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="377"/>
UPON the News of this Success of the <HI>Swedish</HI>
General, the <HI>Czar</HI> who was then at <HI>Dresden,</HI> took
Post immediately to put himself at the Head of
his Army in <HI>Pomeren,</HI> where he arrived the 25th,
having before order'd a strong Reinforcement of
Troops to joyn them.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Augustus</HI> was there with his Army alrea∣dy,
so that Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> had no less than 3 Mo∣narchs
at the Head of three Armies to encounter
with, and was so surrounded by them, that they
made no Question to give a very good Account
of him; and for this Reason it was, that the <HI>Czar</HI>
resented very much a Cessation of Arms for 15
Days, which was agreed between Count <HI>Stein∣boch</HI>
and the <HI>Allies,</HI> and spoke with some Tokens
of Displeasure against Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> on that
Account; but when his Majesty came to the
Army, that General convinc'd him, that King
<HI>Augustus</HI> had agreed to it without his Participati∣on,
that he had opposed it, and that he would have
had the <HI>Saxons</HI> to have joyn'd in following the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> till they should be forced to Fight all the
three Armies together.</P>
<P>IT is true, the <HI>Saxons</HI> were not ready, nor the
King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> so that King <HI>Augustus</HI> acted
upon a just Necessity; and when he lay'd the
Reasons before the <HI>Czar,</HI> and convinc'd him that
he had no private Treaty in Hand, either with
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or with <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> who was
then in the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
was better satisfied, and the two Armies ad∣vanc'd
to <HI>Gustraw,</HI> where his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
had his Quarters; the <HI>Danes</HI> who likewise had
not agreed to the Cessation, but who alone had
the Benefit of it, having gain'd the Time to bring
their Army together, had they made a right Use
<PB N="369" REF="378"/>
of the Advantage, were now advanced to <HI>Gads∣husch;</HI>
so that Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> was, as it were,
block'd up in the narrow District of <HI>Wismar,</HI>
having his Infantry quartered in the very City,
and his Cavalry canton'd in the Villages round;
where had the three Armies joyn'd, they must
have fallen all into the Hands of the Allies,
without Fighting, at least all the Horses, the
Country not affording Forrage Sufficient to sub∣sist
them.</P>
<P>BUT Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> knew the Enemy he had
to deal with, and gathering his Troops together
in one Days time, the Truce being to end the
very next Day, he put himself in full March to∣wards
<HI>Gadsbusk,</HI> even before the <HI>Danes</HI> had No∣tice
of his being stirr'd from <HI>Wismar;</HI> as the
<HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Russian</HI> Armies were near, the King of
<HI>Poland</HI> detached 4000 <HI>Saxon</HI> Horse to reinforce
the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> as soon as ever he heard
that Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> went that Way, and the <HI>Danes</HI>
hasten'd them in their way by many Messengers
on the Heels of one another, and at last by a
Signal of three Pieces of Cannon, which inti∣mating
the Extremity, caused the <HI>Saxon</HI> Cavalry
to make such Haste, that when they arriv'd, be∣ing
immediately to go on Action, their Horse
were so fateigu'd, that they were neither able to
fight, or to run away, and were easily defeated,
helping rather, to discourage, than reinforce
the <HI>Danish</HI> Army, who they came to serve.</P>
<P>IT was the 20th of <HI>December</HI> when the two
Armies came to engage; a full Account of the
Battle can never be drawn from the Perticulars
which were made Publick at that time, each side
setting forth their own Case with the Boasts and
Rhodomontadoes, usual with those Nations: But
<PB N="370" REF="379"/>
in few Words, 'tis evident the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
was soundly Beaten; his Army being driven out
of the Field; his Majesty, very little to his Ho∣nour,
retiring even before the Battle was entire∣ly
lost; the <HI>Swedes</HI> took all their Cannon and
Baggage, several Colours and Standards, and near
4000 Prisoners, and the scatter'd Remains of their
Army retir'd to <HI>Oldesloe,</HI> and afterwards Count
<HI>Steinboch</HI> enter'd into <HI>Holstein,</HI> and had not the
<HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> reliev'd the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
by joyning his Forces with the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI>
and persuing the <HI>Swedes,</HI> the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
had, in all human Probability, been Ruin'd.</P>
<P>THUS his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty has been first, or last,
the Deliverer of all his <HI>Allies,</HI> and the only
Prince that has appear'd able to reduce the
haughty Courage of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Nation; as soon
as his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had an Account of the
Battle, he joyn'd the King of <HI>Polands</HI> Army, and
all together march'd after Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> who
had already passed the <HI>Trave,</HI> and was advanc'd
into <HI>Holstein;</HI> the Remains of the <HI>Danish</HI> Horse
which had escaped the Battle of <HI>Gadsbusch,</HI>
joyn'd them in their March, being 2700 Men,
and the whole Army was now, by the Consent
of the two Kings, put under the Command of his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, as Generalissimo.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, the <HI>Swedes</HI> went on, they
passed the <HI>Trave</HI> near <HI>Lubeck,</HI> and Advancing
towards the <HI>Elb,</HI> came to <HI>Hamburgh;</HI> here they
sent out Parties to demand heavy Contribu∣tions
of all the Country, and particularly, of the
City of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> it self; and having enter'd the
King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Territories, they burn'd <HI>Alte∣na,</HI>
a rich trading Town, within two Miles of
<HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mburgh:</HI> This they pretended was done in
<PB N="371" REF="380"/>
Reprisal for Towns the <HI>Russian</HI> Army and other
Confederates had destroy'd in <HI>Pomerania.</HI></P>
<P>THIS barbarous Action, Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> lay'd
to the Charge of General <HI>Welling,</HI> late Governor
of <HI>Bremen;</HI> and in Justification, publish'd the fol∣lowing
Letters about it, one whereof pretends
to reproach his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Troops, in their
Treatment of their Masters Enemies, perhaps
he intends <HI>Livonia</HI> tho' he names it not; the o∣ther,
lays the same Violent Method to the
Charge of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and their Usage of the In∣habitants
<HI>Ossenden</HI> in the Dutchy of <HI>Bremen;</HI>
which perhaps was the Occasion of this Works
being order'd by Count <HI>Welling,</HI> as above. The
Letters with the proper Introductions to them,
are as follows.</P>
<P>“THE <HI>Swedes</HI> having continued for some Days
about <HI>Odesloe</HI> and <HI>Segebergh,</HI> made a Motion to∣wards
<HI>Pinenberg,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Bassewitz</HI> with
200 Horse came to <HI>Altena,</HI> and requir'd the In∣habitants
to pay a great Sum for Contributions.
On <HI>Sunday</HI> in the Afternoon Count <HI>Steinboch</HI>
came to <HI>Hamburgh</HI> with several Generals and
having had a long Conference with Count <HI>Wel∣ling,</HI>
went to joyn his Troops posted before
<HI>Altena,</HI> which had been reinforced by several
Detatchments. 'Tis said the <HI>Swedes</HI> demanded
of that Place 200000 Rixdollars, whereupon,
they offer'd 50000, declaring, that it was im∣possible
for them to pay a greater Sum, upon
which the Agreement was broke, and the fol∣lowing
Night several Detatchments march'd
into <HI>Altena,</HI> and set it on Fire, whereby 'tis
computed that about 3000 Houses were reduc'd
to Ashes, together with the <HI>Popish</HI> Church; but
<PB N="372" REF="381"/>
those of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> and Reform'd were pre∣serv'd,
with about 70 or 80 Houses. The
<HI>Swedes</HI> burn'd also several large Magazines along
the <HI>Elbe,</HI> whereby there are a World of People
ruin'd. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Factors who foresaw that
Misfortune, withdrew most of their Effects
from that Place, and removed them to <HI>Ham∣burgh.</HI>
The Generals <HI>Fleming</HI> and <HI>Scholten,</HI>
who were there, sent a Trumpeter to Count
<HI>Steinboch,</HI> to complain of this Proceeding, who,
as we heard, answer'd, that he would acquaint
the World by a Manifesto, with the Reasons
that have oblig'd him to carry Things to these
Extremities; and in the mean time, they
Hand about here a Copy of a Letter written
by that General to Monsieur <HI>Wibe,</HI> on of the
Privy-Counsellors to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI>

Reasons of War, and an indespensable Necessi∣ty,

Reprisals, and burn down the Town of <HI>Altena;</HI> de∣claring
further, that if the Enemies make any new

<P>I don't know, Messieurs, whether the Sight of the
Destruction of <HI>Staden</HI> has been more dreadful to you,
than that of the Burning of <HI>Altena;</HI> but it is cer∣tain,
that the former might have been avoided, where∣as
the latter was absolutely necessary. The Reasons
that obliged Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> tho' entirely against his
Will, to come to such Extremities, have already been
made Publick. If the red hot Bullets you threw into
<HI>Stral<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und</HI> and <HI>Wisinar,</HI> had had their Effect, and
burnt those Towns as well as our Magazines therein,
the Reason of War would have justify<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d you, as well as
it now does Count <HI>Steinboch.</HI></P>
<P>But the many Flames that have been kindled, and
the dreadful Devastations of several of the King my
Master's Dominions, cannot find the same Justifica∣tion,
being committed without any manner of Necessi∣ty,
by those of your Allies, that you even call <HI>Chri∣stians.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Danish Zealand,</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI> will always be
an Evidence, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> never had recourse to
Flambeaux, unless they were forced to the same, by
Reasons of War; but that our Nation, always used
<PB N="377" REF="386"/>
to revenge themselves upon their Enemies, by way of
Arms, and of▪ Humanity, never with Burning, and
exercising of Cruelties.</P>
<P>The dreadful Ruins several of his <HI>Swedish</HI> Maje∣sty's
Provinces and Towns belonging thereunto, have
suffer'd, and the Chains of Slavery under which a∣bove
a hundred Thousand of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s
Subjects, of both Sexes, who have been sold to the In∣fidels,
groan at this very Time, will, for the good of
your Master's Countries, prevail upon you, to concur
with Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> in making a more humain
War.</P>
<P>I have deliver'd to Colonel <HI>Meyer</HI> the Precau∣tion
Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> has recommended to Mon∣sieur
<HI>Wibe,</HI> to be taken in this Matter; and I do
not at all doubt, but you will contribute thereto.
Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> has assur'd me, that for his Part,
he will proceed not to any Extremity against the
Dutchy of <HI>Holstein,</HI> unless he be necessitated to it.</P>
<P>Your own Wisdom, and the Reason of War, will
justify his Conduct in such a Case.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>A LETTER from the Generals
Flamming and Scholten, to General Welling.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY the Letter which you have done us the Ho∣nour
to write to us, we have seen the Reasons
which you alledge for the Burning of <HI>Altena.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="387"/>
We being Parties, will not take upon us to be Judges,
There are enough to decide it. Mean while, you will
allow us to tell you, there is no Comparison between
what has been done at <HI>Altena,</HI> and what happen'd at
<HI>Staden. Staden</HI> is a fortify'd Town, which resisted
the Arms of his <HI>Danish</HI> Majesty, and against which,
it was allowable to use all the Means that are ordi∣narily
taken to reduce a Town: But <HI>Altena</HI> is an
open defenceless Place; and we believe, Sir, that a
Parallel can never be made, between a Bombardment
and the setting a Town on Fire with Torches. 'Tis
as if the inevitable Slaughter in a Battle or an Assault,
should be compared with a Massacre of People who
do not defend themselves, nor are in a State of De∣fence.</P>
<P>The other Reasons for the Burning of <HI>Altena,</HI>
that have been made Publick, amount to this, that
Magazines were providing, and Bread baking there;
but 'tis certain, there was no Magazines in <HI>Altena,</HI>
or if there were, they were so inconsiderable, that
there could be no Pretence on that Account, for
burning above 2000 Houses, and reducing several
Thousands of People to Beggary; and this, without
gaining any Advantage by it. According to this
Allegation that there were Magazines, was not
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught of in the Answer which Count <HI>Steinboch</HI>
made to the Deputies of <HI>Altena;</HI> nothing was then
urg'd, but the Affair of <HI>Staden,</HI> to which we think
we have given a sufficient Reply.</P>
<P>As to the Burning Bullets fired into <HI>Stralsund</HI>
and <HI>Wismar,</HI> we refer to what we have said about
the Bombarding of <HI>Staden.</HI> This is lawful, but
voluntary Burnings are abhorred.</P>
<P>As to the Conduct of our Allies, we suppose you
will allow a Distinction between cutrages committed
without Order, and those committed by express
<PB N="379" REF="388"/>
Order. Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> himself made that Di∣stinction
very justly some Months ago, when speaking
of some Disorders done by the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Soldiers,
<HI>he ask'd,</HI> whether they had been order'd to commit
them; and being assured, that not only such Orders
had never been given, but that the Authors of those
Excesses had been punish'd; <HI>he said,</HI> he was glad to
hear it, adding, that he could not treat those who
should commit such Outrages by Order, and who should
fall into his Hands, as Prisoners of War, but as In∣cendaries.
What you can alledge farther of the Con∣duct
of our <HI>Allies,</HI> may be easily justify'd by the Right
of Reprizals. Remember only, Sir, what was
practised on our Side, after the Battle of <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rva.</HI>
Before that Time, had any such Cruelties been
acted?</P>
<P>Those who were Authors of the First, are answer∣able
for all that have been committed since. You
know, Sir, that there is no other Foundation of the
Law of Nations than Agreement and Example.
After the Precedent yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have newly set us, it will
be lawful for our Masters to retaliate others upon
you, of what kind soever, and this by the Law of
Nations.</P>
<P>In our Opinion the <HI>Swedish</HI> Moderation in <HI>Zealand</HI>
ought not to be alledged on this Occasion, for the
King your Master not having landed there as an
Enemy, but as a Guarantee of Peace, could not exercise
Acts of Hostility there.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Saxony,</HI> your Interest had a greater Share
in your Humanity, than Humanity it self. With the
23 Millions which you drew from <HI>Saxony,</HI> it might
have been restored to its former State, had it been
all laid in Ashes. And how otherwise could you
have cloathed, recruited and remounted your Army.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="389"/>
Be this as it will, those two Examples prove
however, that Burnings and Acts of Inhuma∣nity,
are more authoriz'd by the Ministers and Ge∣nerals
of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> than by that Prince
himself.</P>
<P>We have reply'd to the Example which you al∣ledged
of the Ruin of several of your Provinces;
but we cannot apprehend what you mean by advising
us to concur with Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> in carrying on the
War humanly, after the Example of Inhumanity and
Cruelty, which he has newly given us: A Cruelty,
that has cost the Lives of so many poor Innocents, of
Women in Childbed and in Labour, of Sick who were
not in a Condition to get out of Bed. How many
Children and Aged snatch'd from the Violence of
the Flames, were unable to endure the Extremi∣ty
of the Cold, and perished miserably in the
Snow?</P>
<P>How many unhappy Wretches of both Sexes and
all Ages, exposed to the Rigour of the Season,
perish daily of Cold and Hunger? Are these the
Instances of Humanity which Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> would
have us Imitate? Can we make such a Proposition
to our Masters?</P>
<P>We have seen the Letter which Count <HI>Steinboch</HI>
wrote to Monsieur <HI>Wibe,</HI> we will suspend our Judg∣ment
on it; bnt know that Threats work nothing
upon the Persons who are just, and of generous Minds,
such as are in the Court of the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI>
We conclude, by saying, that you can never justify
the Burning of <HI>Altena;</HI> but it will Justify all that
we may attempt for taking true Vengeance, if our
August Masters, agreeably to their usual Humanity and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, do not think fit to defer the imitating
so cruel an Example, unless they are forced to it by
new Cruelties of the like Nature: We are assured in
<PB N="381" REF="390"/>
the mean while, that the Almighty mill not let pasts
without Punishment, the unheard of Cruelties that
have been practised at <HI>Alten.</HI></P>

<P>AFTER all that has been said, of the Civility
of the <HI>Turks</HI> to the <HI>Czar,</HI> and to his Ministers,
such was the uncertainty of Things, on that Side
the World, that in the midst of the Proceedings of
the <HI>Czar,</HI> in so remote a Part of the World, his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was again allarm'd with the Ru∣mour
that his Ambassador at <HI>Coustantinople</HI> was a∣gain
imprisoned in the <HI>Seven Towers,</HI> and that the
<HI>Turks</HI> had declared War again against him; and
he was earnestly press'd by his Generals to leave
this Petty Retail War, (<HI>as they called it</HI>) and ad∣vance
to the Frontiers of <HI>Tartary,</HI> to prepare to
oppose the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER as his Majesty had better Intelli∣gence
than his Enemies in the <HI>Ottoman Port,</HI> he
was always appriz'd of things as they really were
reported to be, and knew very well how far they
were True, and how far not. The <HI>Turks</HI> were
for awhile much influenc'd by the Han of <HI>Tartary,</HI>
and the Creatures of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> 'twas a
little hard that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> should be able
to bribe the <HI>Turks</HI> with their own Money, and
distribute the same Sums, which the <HI>Port</HI> gave
him for his Support, to the great Officers of the
same <HI>Port,</HI> to engage them to break Faith with
the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> after he had perform'd all
that was required by their last Treaty; had re∣stor'd
<PB N="382" REF="391"/>
<HI>Asoph,</HI> had dismantled <HI>Kassirkameen,</HI> and
the other Places, and fully withdrawn his Troops
out of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Czar</HI> was too many for them here too,
for his Ministers at the <HI>Port</HI> having Power given
them to enter upon a new Treaty, and the
<HI>Czar</HI> causing about 70000 Men to advance to the
Frontiers of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> to let the <HI>Turks</HI> see he
was not unprovided; the <HI>Russian</HI> Ministers found
it much easier to reconcile Matters with the <HI>Port,</HI>
than was imagin'd, and the old League was not
only renew'd for 30 Years, but other Terms were
gain'd, which made as much for his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje∣sty's
Interest as could be desir'd.</P>
<P>ALL this while his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty was at the
Head of the Confederate Army in <HI>Holstein,</HI> push∣ing
the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army under Count <HI>Steinboch;</HI> his
Majesty had, indeed, determin'd to leave the
Army, and return to his own Dominions, and
the rather, because of the Mischief which he knew
was breeding at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> by the Intreagues
of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> but knowing the Misun∣understandings
in the Confederate Army
would be such, about the Command, that there
would be no Agreement; and it being hard, that
the Army, two Thirds of which were at the same
Time his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's own Forces, should be
Commanded by any but his own Generals; up∣on
this Consideration, he resolv'd to manage
the other Part by Negotiation, and to Command
the Army in <HI>Holstein</HI> himself.</P>
<P>THE Confederates were, as things then stood,
much too strong for Count <HI>Steinboch;</HI> their Force
was above 36000 Men, the <HI>Swedes</HI> nor above
14000 at best, but led by an old Fox that knew
his Advantages, and how to lay hold of them, to
<PB N="383" REF="392"/>
a Tittle; that knew how to fight when he had a
feir Field, and how to avoid it, when he was out
Number'd and not in Condition.</P>
<P>THIS, Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> seeing the Confederates
advance, and that they were too powerful for
him, march'd from <HI>Altena,</HI> North into <HI>Upper Hol∣stein,</HI>
and advancing along the <HI>Eyderstorm,</HI> kept the
Confederates at Bay a great while, about <HI>Fred∣rickstand,</HI>
near which Place they pass'd the said
River <HI>Eyder,</HI> and advanc'd to <HI>Oerfield,</HI> and to
<HI>Husum:</HI> Here they laid the Country under Con∣tribution,
and raised a very great Sum in Mo∣ney,
and Provisions: Here Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> post∣ed
himself to so much Advantage among the Ri∣vers
and Dikes, that it was not easy to attack
him.</P>
<P>BUT his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty resolv'd to make
short Work with him, and in a Word, to attack
him, where-ever he could find him, cost what it
would; for as I noted above, the <HI>Czar</HI> at this
Time, was press'd by his own Affairs, not know∣ing
whether his Affairs with the <HI>Turks</HI> would
End in Peace or War; Orders were therefore gi∣ven
to make Dispositions for the Attack, while
the <HI>Swedes</HI> on the other Hand, fortify'd their
Camp, and made an Appearance of Resistance,
threatening to give the <HI>Russians</HI> a very warm Re∣ception.
But Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> after repulsing our
Men at the Attack of one of his Posts, where the
<HI>Russians</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> had some Loss, thought fit
not to stand the Shock of a general Attack by
the whole Army; and accordingly, quitted the
advantagious Camp, and retired to another, and
thus retiring from one Post to another, and the
Confederates still following him Close, and push∣ing
<PB N="384" REF="393"/>
him from Place to Place, he begun to be
brought to Extremity.</P>
<P>THE best Account of these several Motions
leave them very uncertain, and are scarce worth
our collecting; the short of the Matter is, that
the Confederates attack'd the <HI>Swedes</HI> at <HI>Holling∣stede,</HI>
but were repulsed with the Loss of 300
Men; and the next Night the <HI>Swedes</HI> retired, and
posted their whole Army in a very strong Situa∣tion,
between <HI>Fredrickstadt,</HI> and the Fortress of
<HI>Toningen.</HI> This last was a very strong Place, be∣longing
to the Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> and Garrison'd
by his Troops, who being in <HI>Sweden,</HI> a Youth,
and under Age, the Administration of his Estates,
was left to the Care of his Uncle, the Prince
and Bishop of <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tin.</HI></P>
<P>THE Governor of this Fortress made Show of
keeping an exact Neutrality; and once, when
Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> sent a Letter to him, sent it un∣open'd,
refusing to receive any Letter or Messa∣ges
on either Side; and while Matters stood thus,
Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> stood but in very ill Terms,
being streighten'd for Room, and also for Provi∣sions,
and almost surrounded by the Confedorate
Armies, who were so much superior.</P>
<P>IN this Posture the Confederates press'd him
very hard; and tho' he avoided Fighting, and
retir'd from one Post to another, yet it was
apparent he must at last Fight to his inevi∣table
Destruction, or su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ender to his Ene∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.</P>
<P>HE defended himself, however, in this Man∣ner
a long time, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Beginning of
<HI>January,</HI> till the 14th of <HI>February,</HI> 1712<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 13. In
vain pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing the Governor of <HI>Tonnighen</HI> to give
him a Retreat into the Fortress, and being
<PB N="385" REF="394"/>
push'd to Extremity by the Confederates, he
came with the whole <HI>Swedish</HI> Army and encamp∣ed
at <HI>Gardenghen,</HI> a Village, within half a League
of <HI>Toningen.</HI></P>
<P>THE Confederates follow'd him Close, and
here the Governor of <HI>Toningmen,</HI> whether by
Order of the Prince Administrator of <HI>Holstein,</HI> or
by Stratagem of Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> is very little
known to this Day: But the Governor, <HI>I say,</HI>
let the <HI>Swedish</HI> General, and with him, his whole
Army, into the Place, to the great Relief and
Encouragement of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who were, indeed,
brought to the Point of being ruin'd.</P>
<P>THIS was a Blow to the Confederates who had
been extreamly fateigu'd with the Service they
had been upon, having kept in the Field all the
<HI>Winter:</HI> The Matter was now come to a Point,
there was now no way left now to force them,
and nothing but a very close Blockade, could
Effect their Reduction, and this the Army a∣greed
on.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> finding now that the Thing would
be drawn out in Length, left the Army and went
to <HI>Hamburgh;</HI> and from thence, to <HI>Hanover.</HI> His
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty left the Army the 15th of <HI>Fe∣bruary,</HI>
having first had a long Conference with
the Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> where the Command of
the Army was settled, and the Rank of the
Troops, and every thing needful to carry on the
Design; for having Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> and the
<HI>Swedes</HI> in so close a Place, it was certain, they
ought not to let them go off, cost what it would.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> having now left the Army, had se∣veral
private Affairs in Hand, as particularly, at
<HI>Wolfembotle,</HI> where he made some Stay, in order to
reconcile things between the Princess of <HI>Russia,</HI>
<PB N="386" REF="395"/>
his Daughter-in-Law, and her Husband, the
<HI>Czarowitz,</HI> or Hereditary Prince, who, it seems
had had some Difference with the Princess, his
Spouse, of which we shall hear farther.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Wolfenbuttel,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> went to <HI>Magde∣burg,</HI>
and thence to <HI>Schoonhosen</HI> near <HI>Berlin,</HI> where
he had an Interview with the King of <HI>Prussia,</HI>
and where his <HI>Prussian</HI> Majesty entertain'd him
with the utmost Magnificence. This was the
10th of <HI>March,</HI> the next Day, the two illustrious
Monarchs dined together; and the <HI>Czar</HI> having
abu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dance of Reason to be very well satisfy'd
with his Reception, parted the same Afternoon
for <HI>Dantzick</HI> in his way to <HI>Livonia.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT was made Publick at this Time of his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Journey, seems to have Truth
in it, being writen from <HI>Dantzick,</HI> after the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Arrival there as follows, <HI>viz</HI></P>
<P>THE Court of <HI>Wolfenbuttel</HI> is highly satisfy'd
with the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and the Princess, Wife
to the Hereditary Prince, set out the 16th of
<HI>March</HI> under the Discharge of the Cannon for
<HI>Petersburg</HI> by the way of <HI>Berlin</HI> and <HI>Dantzick.</HI>
The <HI>Czar</HI> presented her with a great Sum of Mo∣ney
for the Charges of her Journey; and at the
same time assur'd her, that she should be used
with so much Respect in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> that he did not
question but she would easily forget <HI>Germany.</HI>
That Prince made considerable Presents to the
Mother of that Princess, and amongst other
Things, presented her with his Picture set with
Diamonds, of a considerable Value. The Court
of <HI>Muscovy</HI> is to continue at <HI>Petersburg</HI> for some
Time, and some Grandees of the Retinue of the
<HI>Czar,</HI> report, that that Prince intends to make
that Place the Seat of his Empire, and 20000
<PB N="387" REF="396"/>
Persons are remov'd thither from <HI>Moscow.</HI> His
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty designs to have at Sea this <HI>Sum∣mer</HI>
a Squadron of his own Ships, and besides those
that have been built in his own Harbours, he has
bought several Frigats at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and in <HI>Holland,</HI>
which are to be man'd and fitted out at <HI>Copen∣hagen,</HI>
to act in Conjunction with the <HI>Danish</HI>
Fleet under the Command of Vice Admiral
<HI>Cruitz.</HI> Thus far this Account.</P>
<P>WHILE these things were doing, the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Troops kept their Footing in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and a
great Part of the Town of <HI>Wolgast</HI> refusing to
pay their Contributions, was burnt by the
<HI>Russian</HI> General's Order. But the Attack of
<HI>Stralsund</HI> or <HI>Stetin,</HI> was not thought proper to be
undertaken 'till the <HI>Swedes</HI> in <HI>Holstein</HI> were en∣tirely
reduc'd, which were yet a Work of Diffi∣culty.</P>
<P>THIS Year his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Queen, or
rather Empress, tho' they call'd her in <HI>Muscovy</HI>
by neither of those Stiles, but that of <HI>Czarina,</HI>
was deliver'd of a Daughter, or Princess; this
happen'd very much to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Sa∣tisfaction,
just after his Arrival at <HI>Petersburg.</HI>
This Princess was baptized a few Days after, ac∣cording
to the Rites of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, and
named, <HI>Maria Petra Witza.</HI></P>
<P>ALL this while the Preparations against the
<HI>Turks</HI> went on as before, the <HI>Russian</HI> Court not yet
knowing what the unsettled Dispositions of the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Court might issue in; and his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty, that his Enemies might not flatter
themselves with Hopes of taking him at the same
Advantage they did before, <HI>viz.</HI> to be surround∣ed
with their <HI>Tartars,</HI> to cut off his Provisions, or
to be betray'd by the <HI>Moldavians,</HI> who had under∣taken
<PB N="388" REF="397"/>
to supply the Army, <HI>I say,</HI> of take from his
Enemies all Expectations of that kind; his Maje∣sty
caused three large Forts to be erected upon the
Banks of the <HI>Dniester,</HI> and two Bridges of Com∣munication
to be laid over the River; and here
he laid up, and resolv'd to lay up Stores of Corn,
and Forrage, with Meal, and an infinite Quanti∣ty
of other Provisions, sufficient for his whole
Army; resolving also, if he advanc'd into <HI>Mol∣davia,</HI>
to build two strong Forts; one at an impor∣tant
Pass, in the Way to the <HI>Pruth;</HI> and another,
on the Bank of the <HI>Pruth;</HI> to secure his Convoys
and Provisions from the <HI>Tartars:</HI> In this Posture
the <HI>Turks</HI> found Things when they held their
great <HI>Divan,</HI> or Council, to conclude, whether
they should break with the <HI>Russians,</HI> or, no:
Their seeing the <HI>Czar,</HI> in such a formidable Po∣sture,
contributed not a little to cool their
Warmth for a War, and to adhere to the wiser
Councils of Peace, as we shall hear presently.</P>
<P>BUT to come back to <HI>Holstein,</HI> where the War
was now near a Close, the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army being at
length forc'd by the Confederates to quit their
Intrenchments and Fastnesses they had made, and
retire into <HI>Tonningben,</HI> where they were reduced
to Extremity for want of Provisions, and the
<HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Russians</HI> resolving to attack them in
Form, and force them out of that Fortress Sword
in Hand, General Count <HI>Steinbock</HI> was forced to
Capitulate; several Treaties and Offers had been
made on one Side and other, which came to no∣thing:
But on the 16th of <HI>May,</HI> the whole Mat∣ter
was agreed on, and an End put to that War.
The Terms of this Capitulation, as it was call'd,
was as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

That all the General and chief Officers, to∣gether

<P>THIS Affair being thus concluded Prince <HI>Men∣zikoff,</HI>
and the other <HI>Russian</HI> Generals prepared to
bring away the Army, and put them into Quar∣ters
of Refreshment, after so severe a Campaign,
which had lasted now from the beginning of <HI>De∣cember,</HI>
to the middle of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>ON the 4th of <HI>June,</HI> the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Forces
march'd from their Camp with their Quota of the
<HI>Swedish</HI> Prisoners Colours and Cannon: This Pro∣portion,
or Quota was thus stated, and agreed a∣mong
the Generals of all Sides; the whole was
divided into five equal Parts, of which the <HI>Russians</HI>
had two Fifths, the <HI>Danes</HI> two, and the <HI>Saxons</HI> one,
and upon this Division, Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> sent to
his Camp 47 <HI>Swedish</HI> Colours, 27 Standards, 3
pair of Kettle Drums, and 6 Pieces of Cannon;
with these the Troops decamp'd, and march'd to∣wards
the <HI>Trave;</HI> but the Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> then
went to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> where he resolv'd to humble
the City for some Insolences they had suffer'd to
be put up on the <HI>Russians,</HI> and their Affairs; where∣upon
he demanded 500000 Rixdollars of them,
and to give the more vigour to his demand, he
mark'd out a Camp for 15000 Men in their Ter∣ritories,
he order'd the Troops to approach, as if
he intended really to attack them.</P>
<P>THE just Pretentions the Prince had to be of∣fended
at the Conduct of the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> were
sent them in a Letter, and are to the Purpose
following.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. “THAT some Years since they have print∣ed
in this City false Reports reflect∣ing
on the Honour of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, and
that upon Complaint thereof, the Magistrates
<PB N="393" REF="402"/>
have refused to deliver up the Authors of the
same.”</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT the Sieur <HI>Vosbein,</HI> Director of Com∣merce
“for <HI>Muscovy,</HI> was arrested and kept
Prisoner, till he was released by giving Bail,
whereby he sustain'd a Damage, amounting
to above 100000 Florins, tho' he was known
to be under the Protection of the <HI>Czar.</HI>”</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. “THAT in the Year 1700, 20000 Fire Arms
belonging to that Prince, were betrayed by
the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> to the <HI>Swedes.</HI>”</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. “THAT an Officer of the <HI>Czar</HI> coming
through <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> was suffer'd to be plunder'd
at one of the Gates by the Officers of the
Custom House, in sight of the Guards.”</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. “THAT the Baron <HI>de Lewenwodle,</HI> Adjutant
General of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army was lately af∣fronted
in a most scandalous manner at the
Gate of <HI>Altena,</HI> which the said Prince <HI>Menzi∣koff</HI>
declares, that his Master expects a suita∣ble
Satisfaction.”</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, who never Sleeps upon
the Enterprizes he has in View was at this time,
at <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> as is observ'd above, and had the
satisfaction in one Day to receive an Account
from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the hopes his Ministers there
had of renewing the Peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI>
and from <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> of the Surrender of Count
<HI>Steinboch,</HI> and the whole <HI>Swedish</HI> Army at <HI>Ton∣ningen.</HI></P>
<P>THO' this did not hasten his Preparations for
his other Designs, which he was resolved to
have push'd, tho' his Enemies had not made
Peace in <HI>Turky,</HI> or had not been reduc'd in <HI>Hol∣stein,</HI>
yet it added this to it, that he was now at
<PB N="394" REF="403"/>
Leisure to appear at the Head of his Army, and
on Board his Fleet for an Expedition against the
<HI>Swedes</HI> in <HI>Finland.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the Enterprize, and it was not an
Undertaking of small Consequence for could
he but reduce this Province, the <HI>Swedes</HI> would be
entirely driven not only out of the Gulph of <HI>Nar∣va,</HI>
and the great Gulph of <HI>Finland,</HI> but even
out of the<SEG REND="decorInit">G</SEG>ulph of <HI>Bothnia;</HI> for if <HI>Finland</HI> was
once taken, the Eastern <HI>Bothina</HI> would fall of Course.</P>
<P>IT was for this Reason, that his Majesty pre∣par'd
so considerable a Force for this Conquest.
The <HI>Czar</HI> sail'd the 19th from <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> with
with a Fleet of 20 Men of War 100 Gallies, and
200 Transport Ships, having on Board 18000 Foot,
with a Train of Artillery, as well of heavy Can∣non
and Mortars, as of Field peices with a great
Magazine of all sorts of Stores of War directing,
his Course strait for <HI>Abo</HI> in <HI>Finland;</HI> the Cavalry,
consisting of 9000 Horse, and Dragoons were or∣der'd
to march by Land to meet the Army at
their coming on Shoar: The Hereditary Prince of
<HI>Russia</HI> also attended his Father the <HI>Czar</HI> in this
Expedition.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty went on this attempt, as
to a certain Conquest, for the Affairs of the <HI>Swedes</HI>
were at this time at so low an Ebb, and the Nation
of <HI>Swedland</HI> under such discouragements, that they
were in no Condition to repulse him, or defend
themselves; he therefore carried with him a Mani∣festo
to be published at his Landing, to assure the
Inhabitants, prevent their flying from their Ha∣bitations,
and promising them all possible good
Usage, and that the Army should not Plunder,
but observe good Discipline, and pay punctally
<PB N="395" REF="404"/>
for all the Provisions they took of them over and
above the ordinary Contributions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be wondered at, if this Expedition
put the whole Kingdom of <HI>Swedeland</HI> into a ter∣rible
Consternation, for seeing the great Prepa∣ration
making for a Descent, and so great an Army
embark'd, the Senate and Governors of <HI>Swedeland</HI>
made no Question, but that it was designed against
the Capital of the Kingdom, and Consequently
was a blow at the Root in order to subvert the
whole Government, and make an entire Conquest
of <HI>Sweden</HI> it self, which as things then stood, had
been no difficult thing for his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty to
have done: This alarm however, they had really
no Cause, for yet the Fright, had this good Effect,
that the Governor of <HI>Sweden</HI> drawing all the
strength of the Kingdom together for the Defence
of the Coast about <HI>Stockholm,</HI> and the Coast of west
<HI>Gothia,</HI> between <HI>Stockholm</HI> and <HI>Um,</HI> and between
<HI>Stockholm</HI> and <HI>Carelscroon;</HI> so they left the Province,
and Coast of <HI>Finland,</HI> whether the true design of
the <HI>Czar</HI> was pointed quite unguarded, and in a
manner neglected, not that they forgot the need∣ful
Care of it, but that being anxious to preserve
the Heart, or Main of the Kingdom of <HI>Sweden,</HI> they
had not Troops to spare for the succour of the re∣moter
Provinces, where the Danger indeed only
lay.</P>
<P>THIS gave his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty an easie Con∣quest
of <HI>Finland,</HI> where he Landed his Army
without any considerable opposition: He Landed
at <HI>Hesingsford,</HI> a small Port Town, which the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI>
Garrison not being in Condition to defend,
set on fire, and retired towards <HI>Abbo,</HI> where the
<HI>Swedish</HI> General <HI>Arenfield,</HI> who had the com∣mand
of the Troops left for the Defence of that
<PB N="396" REF="405"/>
Province, drew all his Forces together to make
Head against the <HI>Russians,</HI> and had advanc'd to
<HI>Borgo,</HI> a strong Pass, which he pretended to de∣fend;
but we shall afterwards see how well they
maintain'd themselves there.</P>
<P>IN the mean time we must cast back our Eyes
to Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> and the <HI>Russian</HI> Army in their
Victorious return from the Country of <HI>Holstein,</HI>
their demand upon the City of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> has been
mention'd; the Conclusion of which was, that
the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> Paid the Prince 200000 Rixdol∣lars,
and so the <HI>Russian</HI> Army quitted their Di∣strict;
the like Pretensions the Prince made upon
the Citizens of <HI>Lubeck,</HI> and got 100000 Marks
of them, and then without any stop they ad∣vanc'd
towards <HI>Pomerania;</HI> it was propos'd to at∣tack
<HI>Wismar,</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> provided a great
Train of Artillery for that Purpose; but the Ge∣nerals
differing afterwards upon particular Diffi∣culties
in the Enterprize it was laid aside, and the
<HI>Russian</HI> Army march'd and joyn'd the rest of their
Troops in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> where being together, they
made up an Army of 36000 Men, with which
Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> resolv'd to attack the City of
<HI>Stetin,</HI> the Capital of the Royal <HI>Pomerania.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a City of great strength, and the Works
were in very good Condition, and considering
the gallant Defence this City made when besieged
by the King of <HI>Prussia's</HI> Father, then Elector of
<HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> against whom it defended it self to
the last Extremity; I say, considering this, it was
esteem'd a desperate Undertaking of the <HI>Russian</HI>
General, and the World expected it would be the
ruin of their Army, and the disgrace of the Gene∣ral;
but this did not Discourage Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI>
who about eight Days after he had Invested the
<PB N="397" REF="406"/>
Place, rais'd a Battery against the <HI>Oder</HI> Fort, a
strong Work, which guarded the Bridge, and af∣ter
having Batter'd it two Nights, caus'd it to be
storm'd, which his Men did with such Fury,
that the <HI>Swedes,</HI> which defended it, being not able
to maintain their Ground, the <HI>Russians</HI> entered
Sword in Hand, the Defendants being all cut in
pieces, except a very few, who had Quarter grant∣ed
them: This gave the Courage of the Citizens
a shock, and it was easie to see they had not the
Gallantry and Resolution of their Ancestors.</P>
<P>WHILE this was doing, the <HI>Saxons</HI> who lay at
<HI>Damin</HI> and at <HI>Gripswald,</HI> found means with the
help of some <HI>Danish</HI> Fregates, and some other
Vessels to Land upon the Isle of <HI>Rugen,</HI> the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI>
General <HI>Ducker,</HI> who commanded in the
Island, having but very few Troops retired to a
strong Pass in the way to <HI>Stralsund,</HI> and made a
stand there, but kept his Retreat open to <HI>Stralsund,</HI>
if need were, and the <HI>Saxons</HI> receiving some Re∣inforcements
from <HI>Gryswaldt</HI> advanced towards
him, on which being in no Condition to maintain
the Post, he retir'd to <HI>Stralsund,</HI> and left the
<HI>Saxons</HI> Masters of the whole Island; and now the
King of <HI>Denmark</HI> repented heartily that he had
not caus'd his Army to advance into <HI>Pomeren,</HI> for
now had been the Time to have attack'd the City
of <HI>Straelsund,</HI> in which there was not a sufficient
Garrison, or Provisions to have held out a Siege,
nor any Relief at Hand, the Affairs of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
being as I have said in great Confusion; the King's
Sister, since Queen of <HI>Sweden,</HI> being about that
time about taking upon her the Regency of the
Kingdom in the Absence of the King.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="407"/>
THE <HI>Saxons</HI> were sensible of the Advantage they
had, but they wanted every thing needful for such
a Seige as that of <HI>Straelsund;</HI> however they sat
down before the Place, invested it, and surpriz'd
400 Horses, and 50 dismounted Troopers, in the
Enclosures near the City, and dispatch'd Expresses
to <HI>Denmark</HI> for Cannon and Ammunition, which
came not in time, as you shall hear, which occa∣sion'd
the Seige to be deferr'd till new Laurels
were prepar'd by these things for his <HI>Czarish</HI> Ma∣jesty.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd at this very time a Discovery
of the villainous Design against the Life of the
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> which made a very great Noise,
and oblig'd Count <HI>Flemning</HI> to go away imme∣diately,
and the <HI>Saxon</HI> Troops were order'd to
draw off from the intended attack of <HI>Straelsund,</HI>
and follow with all speed the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> ex∣pecting
a General Revolt, especially on the Side
of <HI>Lithuania;</HI> but his <HI>Polish</HI> Majesty manag'd his
Affairs with such Dexterity that nothing of that
kind happen'd.</P>
<P>THE attack of <HI>Stetin</HI> was also deferr'd for the
present, but the City was closely block'd up, and
the Blockade so well concerted, that the Navigati∣on
of the <HI>Oder</HI> was cut off from the <HI>Stetiners,</HI>
which was indeed the only Means to reduce
them.</P>
<P>THE Enemies of the <HI>Russian</HI> Glory had now the
Mortification also to see the renew'd Peace between
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty and the <HI>Turks</HI> confirm'd, by in∣telligence
from all Parts, and particularly from
the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI> exil'd Court near <HI>Adrianople,</HI>
and the Articles were publish'd by themselves,
which being allow'd to be right and in Substance,
are as follows.</P>

each a Fortress on their respective Frontiers;

shall be referr'd to another Time.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>XI.</HI> This Peace shall continue for 25 Years, and may
be prolong'd for a longer Time.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THE publishing of these Articles, stopp'd the
Mouths of those People who insulted the <HI>Czar,</HI>
with having submitted for fear of a War with
the <HI>Turks,</HI> to be Tributary to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as for∣merly
the <HI>Czars</HI> had been, but as his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty had always rejected the Articles with
Scorn, so it was now apparent that the <HI>Turks</HI> had
dropp'd it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Russian</HI> Army lay all this while before <HI>Ste∣tin,</HI>
sometimes resolving to besiege it in Form, and
then, at other times to blockade it; but now Prince
<HI>Menzikoff</HI> being returned from <HI>Berlin,</HI> where a
Treaty for Sequestring the Town into the Hands of
the King of <HI>Prussia</HI> had been set on Foot, but came
to nothing. <HI>I s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> the Prince being Return'd,
resolv'd upon a Bombardment, which he knew
would either bring the City to surrender, or the
King of <HI>Prussia</HI> to yield to the Sequestration upon
the Terms propos'd, which was to pay to the <HI>Czar</HI>
of <HI>Muscovy</HI> 600000 Rix Dollars for the Charges
of the Siege.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to these Resolutions, our Trenches
were open'd, and advanc'd to proper places; and
the Batteries raised with the utmost Expedition,
<PB N="401" REF="410"/>
the Artillery consisted of 58 Pieces of heavy
Cannon, and 32 Mortars: On the 20th of <HI>Sep∣tmber,</HI>
all our Batteries of Cannon and Mor∣tars
being in a Readiness, it was resolv'd to
Fire upon the Place the 28th in the Morn∣ing.
All the Drums and Houtboys of the Ar∣my
were order'd to meet in the Trenches about
9 of the Clock, where they play'd about an Hour,
to the great Surprize of the Besieged, who appear'd
on their Walls to see what the meaning of it
could be; but about Ten, we began to fire from
all our Batteries at once, and continu'd till the
Evening; which had such an Effect, that the
Inhabitants seeing about 160 of their best Houses
burnt, and their Churches batter'd down, they
oblig'd General <HI>Meyrfelt</HI> to desire a Cessation of
Arms. The Sieurs <HI>Bassewitz</HI> and <HI>Brukenthal</HI> were
sent into the Place, and told the Governor that the
Hostilities should be discontinu'd for seven Hours
only, and that he might take his Measures there∣upon.
Those Gentlemen reported, that the
Burghers refused to take up Arms, and the Regi∣ment
of <HI>Pomerania</HI> expressing an Inclination to
lay them down. General <HI>Meyrfelt</HI> offer'd to march
out with his Garrison in 5 Days, provided they
would give him leave to send an Express to Count
<HI>Welling,</HI> to acquaint him there with; which was
granted him, upon Condition that a <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Officer should go along with the Person he would
send to the Count aforesaid, and that his Letter
to him should not be seal'd. This being agreed
to, the <HI>Swedish</HI> Officer and the <HI>Muscovite</HI> set out the
same Morning very early or <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and we
hop'd in a few Days to be Masters of this important
Fortress.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="411"/>
BUT while the Garrison of <HI>Stetin</HI> were thus,
at the Extremity, another Medium was found
out, which made all Sides easy, and this was the
Treaty of Sequestration, <HI>mention'd above.</HI> This
was absolutely, necessary for Prince <HI>Menzkioff</HI> to
yield to; or, to break with the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the
King of <HI>Prussia</HI> also; for the former, protested
absolutely against <HI>Stetin</HI> being put into the Hands
of his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty singly, and insisted that there
should be a Quota of <HI>Danish</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> Troops put
into Garrison there, as well as <HI>Muscovite,</HI> which
Prince <HI>Menzicoff</HI> rejected; those Powers having
not contributed one Farthing towards the Siege.</P>
<P>IN a Word the King of <HI>Prussia</HI> sending a very
obliging Answer to the last Offers of the Prince,
was in Return invited to the <HI>Russian</HI> Camp, where
his <HI>Prussian</HI> Majesty arriv'd the 5th of <HI>October,</HI>
at ended with 3000 Dragoons and 9000 <HI>Prussian</HI>
Foot, being on the other Side the <HI>Oder,</HI> where they
encamp'd. His <HI>Prussian</HI> Majesty was very Magni∣ficently
entertain'd by Prince <HI>Menzicoff,</HI> and a
Royal Tent set up, in which his Majesty lodg'd;
the 6th at Night, having been shewn all the Ap∣proaches
of the <HI>Russian</HI> Army, their Batteries, and
the Preparations which the Ingineers had made for
storming the Place, and that we were sure of our
Game.</P>
<P>THE next Day the Sequestration was settled
and agreed upon, and the Garrison and Burghers of
<HI>Stetin,</HI> agreeing also that the King of <HI>Prussia</HI> should
march into the City the 7th at the Head of 1600
Dragoons, his Infantry entering the Town by the
<HI>Oder</HI> Bridge the next Day.</P>
<P>BY this Treaty, the Possession of <HI>Stetin</HI> was to
remain a-like to the King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> and the Duke
of <HI>Holstein</HI> till the Peace, and 1600 Men of the
<PB N="403" REF="412"/>
Troops of <HI>Holstein</HI> were allow'd to remain in Gar∣rison
with 1600 <HI>Puissians;</HI> and the King of <HI>Prussia</HI>
paid Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> 500000 Rix Dollars, and so
this troublesome Affair ended.</P>
<P>BUT I must observe here, that both the <HI>Saxons</HI>
and <HI>Danes</HI> took great offence at this Treaty; for
the Sequestration of <HI>Stetin</HI> was not Communicated
to them, the <HI>Saxons</HI> alledg'd, seeing the Cannon
furnished for the Siege belong'd to their King, his
<HI>Polish</HI> Majesty ought to share the Money, and de∣manded
one half of the 500000 Dollars; but Prince
<HI>Menzikoff</HI> gave them good Words, and kept all
the Money.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Denmark</HI> took the Allarm,
there being a Report spread that another Treaty
was also on Foot for the Sequestration of <HI>Wismar</HI>
and <HI>Stralsund,</HI> upon which the <HI>Danish</HI> Minister
presented a Memorial in his Master's Name, to
the Ministers of <HI>Prussia</HI> and <HI>Muscovy,</HI> intimating
that his Master had been very much surprized to
hear▪ that an Affair of so much Importance as the
Sequestration of <HI>Stetin</HI> had been concluded, and
that Place deliver'd to the Troops of the Duke of
<HI>Holstein,</HI> whose Interest is inseparable from that
of <HI>Sweden;</HI> That his Majesty hopes nothing shall
be concluded without his Participation in relation
to <HI>Wismar,</HI> because of his particular Concerns in
that Affair, and that the whole Matter, which has
been hitherto kept Secret from him, shall be fairly
communicated to his Majesty, and in the mean
time the said Minister has thought fit to protest
against whatever has been done in this Sequestra∣tion
without his Consent and Knowledge.</P>
<P>As to the Treaty for the Sequestration of <HI>Wis∣mar</HI>
and <HI>Stralsund,</HI> it came to nothing; and all things
being now over, the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army, which was
<PB N="404" REF="413"/>
by this Time reduced by hard Service without
any considerable Action to 22000 Men from
36000; they began their March out of the Coun∣try,
the 25th of <HI>September,</HI> according to the Capi∣tulation
of which, that was one of the most par∣ticular
Conditions.</P>
<P>WHILE this was done, the Armies of his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty were Victorious in <HI>Finland;</HI> General <HI>Le∣becker</HI>
had been recall'd from that Government,
and General <HI>Arenfield</HI> sent in his Room, as is no∣ted
above; but he had no better luck than the
other, for being encamped at a very advantagious
Post, with 7000 <HI>Swedes,</HI> regular and old Troops, and
18000 Men, new raised, but well arm'd, and un∣der
very good Officers, yet the <HI>Russians</HI> attack'd
them; the new raised Troops being undisciplin'd,
yet made very great Resistance at first, but were
charg'd with such Fury, that they were at length
defeated; which occasion'd that the 7000 <HI>Swedes</HI>
were surrounded, and after a very good Defence,
were almost all cut in Pieces, or taken Prisoners,
with all their Artillery, and Baggage.</P>
<P>AFTER this Action, the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Troops enter'd
<HI>Abo</HI> without Resistance, and his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
resolv'd to batter down the Defences of the other
two Forts, which lye adjoyning to the Sea, and
which interrupted his Progress; and thus he
became Master of the whole Province, with the
Loss of very few Men, and the Tranquility of
the Country w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s restor'd entirely: As the <HI>Czar</HI>
had gain'd this whole Province so ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily, he was
resolv'd it should not be so easily taken from him;
he therefore went to Work immediately, to forti∣fy
the Towns of most Importance, as <HI>Abo</HI> and
<HI>Helsingvos,</HI> and others, both which, he has since
made very strong.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="414"/>
THIS Action with the <HI>Swedish</HI> Troops under
General <HI>Ahrenfield,</HI> having been diversly reported,
and the <HI>Russians</HI> being charged with Partiallity, in
relating their own Affairs; I shall therefore give
here a Copy of General <HI>Ahrenfields</HI> own Ac∣count,
which tho' he makes the best of his Loss
to save his own Character; yet an impartial Rea∣der
will easily perceive, a Total defeat was given
him, and that he has lost not only his Army, but
the whole Province; so that our Account will be
effectually ackowledg'd by the Enemy, which is the
best kind of Confirmation; his Letter is as follows:</P>
<P>THIS will inform, that we sustained Yesterday a
fierce Attack from the Enemy, who, at last, oblig'd
us to give Ground. Our Intrenchments near <HI>Palka∣na</HI>
were very strong, and we reckon'd to be able to
de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end 'em a great while against considerable Forces:
But, contrary to our Expectation, the Enemy found
Means to land 7000 Men within a quarter of a
League behind us. I had made several Detachments, and
sent our Parties to get Intelligence, by which I learnt,
that several of the Enemy's Boats were in sight;
whereupon I made all the necessary Dispositions to
hinder a Descent; I also view'd the Place where the
Enemy design'd to land, and caus'd same Horse to be
posted there. I had besides this, drawn two thirds of
the Infantry, that were within the Lines, in order
likewise to oppose the Descent; but the Wind, which
had been contrary to the Enemy's design all Night,
turn'd favourable to them at Break of Day; besides
which, there was a thick Fog, that we could not per∣ceive
till they advanc'd upon us. Our Cavalry was
<PB N="406" REF="415"/>
at first oblig'd to retire, because the Infantry I had
drawn from our Line could not came up time enough
to sustain them; the Enemy before their approach,
having landed the best part of their Troops. Never∣theless,
we advanc'd and charg'd them with a great deal
of Bravery, and by our superior Fire, push'd them into
the Water; but they being supported by such as hourly
landed on all sides, we were obliged to give way in our
Turn. We had disposed things in such a manner, that the
Horse was to attack the Enemy in Flank, and if they
had perform'd their Duty, 'tis probable we should have
had Success: But tho' the Foot did all that could be
expected from the best Troops, yet we could never
prevail with the Cavalry to do the like, each
Plattoon giving way one after another. Things
being at this Pass, it was not difficult for the
Emnemy to attack our Lines; however, they lost abun∣dance
of Men, till upon certain Considerations, I
order'd the Troops to abandon the Intrenchments.
The Loss we have sustain'd in those Attacks is not
small. We were oblig'd to march through the most con∣venient
Places to favour our Retreat, and the Infantry
being obliged to take several Routs, it is not yet possible
for me to know what Number of Men are missing. In
mean time, I have again posted my self in this Passage,
in order to make all possible Resistance. The great
Number of Roads and Passages had oblig'd me to
divide my Troops in such manner, that I had only
with me 700 Horse and 1100 Foot to oppose the
landing. This Day the Enemy advanc'd near this
Place, and I am now in Expectation of their further
Undertakings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE Truth of this Matter was thus, that Gene∣ral
<HI>Ahrenfield</HI> was entirely defeated, his Horse
which indeed did not do their Duty were never
<PB N="407" REF="416"/>
heard of, till they were effectually secured at a∣bout
60 Miles retreat North, and the General
with that small Remnant of his Infantry, which,
out of 25000 Men, did not amount to above 8000,
5133 being kill'd in the Action, and 512 taken
Prisoners, quitted the whole Province, and made
long Marches, tho' none pursued them into <HI>Lap∣land,</HI>
whence we heard of them no more; but
suppose they got Boats to carry them over the
Gulph of <HI>Bothnia</HI> into <HI>Swedeland,</HI> where they were
at that time in Confusion enough.</P>
<P>THE Conquest of this Province has been of great
advantage to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Affairs, for he
was now sufficiently separated from <HI>Sweden,</HI> and
under no Obligation to maintain a great Number
of Troops upon his Frontier, as before the keep∣ing
of good Garrisons in <HI>Abo</HI> and <HI>Helsingford,</HI>
Places which he has made very strong, and
keeping a Number of Gallies always ready up∣on
that Coast, is sufficient to keep all quiet on
that Side.</P>
<P>FROM hence also his Majesty had drawn a vast
Number of good Soldiers, the <HI>Finlanders</HI> being al∣ways
esteem'd the best Men in the <HI>Swedish</HI> Ar∣mies,
and especially for Horse, it being a Coun∣try
for breeding of Horses, the Men are naturally
good Horse-men, and yet I understand that his
Majesty has not Levy'd any Men there, but such
as voluntarily Listed into his Service.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> had now finish'd the Conquest of
the <HI>Swedish</HI> Territories, as far as they lay con∣tiguous
to his own; nothing could more be at∣tempted
against the <HI>Swedes,</HI> but by Naval Pre∣parations
for a Descent on the Kingdom of <HI>Swe∣den</HI>
it self. His <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had, as I have
mentioned already, very much improv'd his
<PB N="408" REF="417"/>
Marine Affairs, as well as his Millitary Affairs
by Land, but not to such Perfection, for his Land
Forces were brought to a Perfection not to be
question'd; his Troops were able to grapple with
any of the Forces of his Neighbours Man for Man,
nay, he has often beaten the <HI>Swedes</HI> when they
have been superior in Number, and in the last
Action at the Siege of <HI>Stetin,</HI> where there were
no Troops but <HI>Russians,</HI> it appear'd how well they
did their Business; how regularly they carry'd
on their Approaches; how boldly they storm'd;
how firmly they sustain'd the Sallies of the
<HI>Swedes;</HI> and how artfully they mannag'd the De∣fence
of their Trenches. We shall now see some
Proceedings in which their naval Force was al∣ways
concern'd.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty who knew the Disposition
of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as well as any Man;
knew there was no sitting still while he was in
being; and the only way to reduce him to Rea∣son,
was, to push his Kingdom of <HI>Sweden</HI> to the
utmost Extremity, while he was Absent; if possi∣ble,
to bring the Regency, newly establish'd
there, in the Princess <HI>Ulrica Eleonora,</HI> and the
Senate, to the Necessity of making a Peace,
before the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> return'd from <HI>Turkey.</HI></P>
<P>To this Purpose, the <HI>Czar</HI> caused a Project
to be laid before the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> for a se∣cond
and more effectual Invading of <HI>Schomen,</HI> an
Undertaking, which he knew very well, would
be very ageeable to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who
having receiv'd a terrible Disgrace in his former
Attempt there, at the Battle of <HI>Elsenburg,</HI> would
be very willing to retrieve that Blow, and also
push the <HI>Swedes;</HI> he having likewise push'd the
War on this side the <HI>Sound,</HI> to the utmost, and
<PB N="409" REF="418"/>
compleated the the Conquest of <HI>Holstein, Bre∣men,</HI>
and <HI>Verden;</HI> nothing remaining to the
<HI>Swedes</HI> on this side the whole <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, but
<HI>Pomeren,</HI> and the City of <HI>Wismar;</HI> which were at
that time under a kind of Offer to be Seque∣strated
to the King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> tho' afterwards
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> forbid it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> did not re∣ceive
this Proposal at first, in such a manner
as the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI> expected; and much
Time was spent in debating upon the particu∣lar
Branches of the Undertaking, and the Quo∣tas,
and Expences necessary to be furnished.
But at length his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty who knew this
was the only way by which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
could be effectualy humbled, conquered all his
<HI>Danish</HI> Majesty's Objections, and offer'd such As∣sistance,
as well of Land Forces, as of Shiping,
that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> saw an evident Oppor∣tunity
put into his Hands, for recovering that
Part of the old Kingdom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> which his
Ancestors had lost to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and which was
given up by the Treaty of <HI>Roschild,</HI> viz. <HI>Scho∣nen,
Bleaking,</HI> and <HI>Halland,</HI> Provinces extended
on the Coast of the <HI>Sound</HI> and the <HI>North Sea,</HI> from
<HI>Malmo</HI> to <HI>Gottenbro',</HI> and which lye in the very
Sight of his Pallace in <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></P>
<P>AS the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> began at last to li∣sten
to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's offer; so Troops were
prepar'd, order'd to march into <HI>Pomeren,</HI> and <HI>Meck∣lemburgh,</HI>
to be transported from thence to <HI>Copen∣hagen,</HI>
and in a Word, his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty made
such Preparations both by Land, and Sea, as con∣vinc'd
the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> that he should be put
into a Posture to humble <HI>Sweden</HI> effectually, and this
brought him to come heartily into the thing, tho'
<PB N="410" REF="419"/>
as it appear'd the Circumstances of <HI>Denmark,</HI> were
not at that time equal to the Undertaking.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty stuck at no∣thing
in Reason to animate the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI>
to persecute the War with asuitable vigour, 300000
Rixdollars were remitted to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and
200000 more afterwards to encourage the King of
<HI>Denmark</HI> to hasten out his Fleet to Sea, and in the
mean time the <HI>Czar</HI> fitted out his own Fleet, con∣sisting
of 30 Men of War, most of them being
brought and fitted up in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and
having embark'd 24000 Men on Board, they sail'd
for the Isle of <HI>Aland,</HI> where his Majesty attack'd Ad∣miral
<HI>Ehrenschild,</HI> and took his Ship, and six Gal∣lies,
killed 327 Men, and took about 936 Priso∣ners,
and landed 16000 Men in that Island<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; which
put the whole Kingdom of <HI>Sweden</HI> into the most
terrible Surprize, and Consternation imaginable,
the Isle of <HI>Aland,</HI> being as it were at the Mouth
of the River of <HI>Stockholm.</HI></P>
<P>BUT all this while the <HI>Danes</HI> did nothing, not∣withstanding
the Assistance his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty had
sent them, they pretended indeed to fit out their
Ships and joyn the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Fleet, but they were so
long in doing it, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> was at Sea, and
rendezvous'd at the Isle of <HI>Bournholm</HI> before the
<HI>Danes</HI> were in Condition to act; so that the expected
Conjunction was prevented, which indeed was the
Disappointment of all farther Opperations for that
Summer.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> seeing how little such Allies were
to be depended upon, put off his intended Descent
upon <HI>Sweden,</HI> for the <HI>Swedish</HI> Fleet was so strong,
being 20 Men of War, and some of their Men of
War so large, for they had four or five three Deck
Ships from 84 to 106 Guns, and his Majesty's
<PB N="411" REF="420"/>
Fleet, tho' well appointed, yet consisted chiefly
of Ships, bought in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> most
of them being from 44 to 60 Guns, three Ships or
four of his Majesty's own building might be there
of 70 and 80 Guns, But was not adviseable to
come to a general Engagement with the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
without the Conjunction of the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>IT is to be remembered here, that his <HI>Czarish</HI>
Majesty having for some Years, when he first ap∣plyed
his Thoughts to encrease his Naval strength,
had his Eyes and all his Measures employ'd up∣on
building a Royal Navy for the Service of the
<HI>Black-Sea,</HI> so he had now brought that Work to such
perfection, that he had a Fleet at <HI>Veronowitz,</HI> on
the <HI>Tanais,</HI> consisting of 44 Ships, from 50 to 90
Guns, whereof 16 of them carried from 80 to 90
Guns; all which Preparations were intirely lost,
and rendered useless, by the surrender of <HI>Asoph,</HI>
given back in Consequence of the unhappy Cam∣paign
in <HI>Moldavia</HI> a, s a above.</P>
<P>BUT the opening a Navigation into the <HI>Bal∣tick,</HI>
by the taking the once impregnable Castle of
<HI>Notteburgh;</HI> the making a Harbour and Port at
<HI>Croonslot,</HI> and building the Imperial City of <HI>Pe∣tersburgh,</HI>
which we find at the writing this Histo∣ry
to be rais'd in about 22 Years from a vacant
piece of Ground, to a City of 50000 Houses be∣sides
publick Edifices, all these were at the time
of this taking of the Island of <HI>Aland,</HI> but new
things, and therefore, tho' the Progress the <HI>Czar</HI>
had made, was for the time surprising to the World,
yet his Naval strength was young, his Subjects
not yet enur'd to Sea-Service; and he was too wary
a Prince to put the Success of all his great De∣signs
upon, the hazard of a general Engagement
<PB N="412" REF="421"/>
so early, and as it were in the beginning of things;
and for this Reason he withdrew from the Island
of <HI>Aland,</HI> upon the Disappointment of the <HI>Danes,</HI>
and gave over his Enterprize for that Year.</P>
<P>SINCE this, we have found his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty
has improv'd his <HI>Marine</HI> strength to snch a degree,
and furnish'd himself with such Capital Ships of
his own building, that now he is a Match for the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> put together, and when∣ever
those Powers apprehend his coming to attack
them, thy are oblig'd to get the aid of a Squa∣dron
of Men of War from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to their
Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stance, or rather as it may justly be call'd for
their Protection.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the <HI>Danes;</HI> the King of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> began now to besensible of his Mistake,
and of his having lost the Opportunity for the
humbling his Enemy the <HI>Swede;</HI> and now to re∣trieve
it we find, that the <HI>Czar</HI> press'd him to en∣gag
in a new Scheme for the said second Invasion
of <HI>Schonen,</HI> and offer'd him his Assistance, as well
by Sea as Land; also seeing how successfully
the <HI>Czar</HI> went on, and how it might be probable
that at one time or other, the <HI>Czar,</HI> by his Supe∣rior
strength would break in upon the <HI>Swedes</HI>
without him, and then he might lose the Oppor∣tunity,
and have no share at all of the Advan∣tage:
This turned the Scale at the Court of
<HI>Denmark;</HI> and as the <HI>Czar</HI> press'd him before, as I
have said to engage in such an Attempt, and
promis'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st and Support him; so now he, his
<HI>Danish</HI> Majesty press'd the <HI>Czar</HI> as much to come
into that Scheme, as if it had been contriv'd at
<HI>Copenhagen</HI> and not at <HI>Petersburgh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="422"/>
IN the mean time, the <HI>Czar,</HI> as I have said,
withdrew from <HI>Aland;</HI> and having order'd his
Gallies and light Fregates to carry the Land
Forces to <HI>Abo</HI> in <HI>Finland,</HI> he sail'd with the Gross
of his Fleet, and the Ships, he had taken from the
<HI>Swedes</HI> to <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> where he made his publick
Entry, with almost as much Triumph as he did for¦merly
at <HI>Muscow,</HI> after the Victory at <HI>Pultowa.</HI></P>
<P>AND his Majesty did this the rather, because
it was the first Snow of that kind, which had ever
been made in his new City; and because it was a
heartening, and Encouragement to his Seamen, to
merit by their Bravery, and to other of his Sub∣jects
to enter into the Sea-Service, which they might
see had such Honours, and Triumphs attending it.
The Sum of which is as follows: As to a particular
Description of his Triumphal-Arches, and other
Works for the Decoration of it, it is too long for
this Work: I shall only say they were such as
shewed, that the Contrivers of them very well
understood their Business, and if they had been in
<HI>France</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> they would not have been out

to Congratulate his Majesty upon his Victory, and
the Governor of <HI>Moscow</HI> in the Name of the Em∣pire
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> Complimented him on his Bra∣very,
and thank'd him for his good Services,
and as an Acknowledgement thereof, declared
him Vice-Admiral. They proceeded then in the
Order aforesaid, and march'd into the Fort,
and there was another general Discharge of the
Cannon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> took all
the Foreign Ministers into his Shallop, and car∣ried
them to his Palace, hefore which there
was a magnificent Triumphal Arch erected on the
Water adorn'd with rich Hangings, and about
half an Hour after the <HI>Czar</HI> came thither,
being receiv'd at the said Arch by that Prince,
and then conducted in to the Palace, where a
most magnificent Entertaiment was prepared,
which lasted till Nine at Night. The <HI>Swedish</HI>
Rear-Admiral <HI>Ehrenschild</HI> sat at Table be∣tween
his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty and Prince <HI>Menzi∣koff;</HI>
and during the Entertainment the <HI>Czar</HI>
took the Opportunity to compliment that Ad∣miral
on his brave Defence in the Fight, assur∣ing
him several times of his particular Esteem
and Affection, and that he would take care to
make him as easy as the could under his Mis∣fortune.
The other <HI>Swedish</HI> Officers sat at ano∣ther
Table, and were used with all possible Civi∣lities,
and so ended that great Solemnity.</ITEM>

THERE was also a very Magnificent Fire-work
appointed to be performed or play'd off, at the
Gate of the Royal Palace. But the Engineers
representing that they had not compleated the
Design, and could not be ready under three or
four Days, it was play'd off the <HI>Sunday</HI> after,
when his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty went publickly to the
great Church, to give Thanks for the Success of
his Arms; and it was admirably perform'd,
without the least Disorder or Mistake.</P>
<P>IT is to be noted, That this was not a Triumph
for the bare taking of one Ship and some Gallies
from the <HI>Swedes</HI> at the Isle of <HI>Aland;</HI> but it was
upon a Conclusion of a long Series of Victories
obtain'd over the <HI>Swedes;</HI> and indeed, finishing
the Conquest of all the Dominions which the
<HI>Swedes</HI> had possess'd on the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>East</HI> Sides
of the <HI>Baltick Seas,</HI> viz. the whole Province of
<HI>Livonia;</HI> of <HI>Easthonia,</HI> and of <HI>Carelia;</HI> and <HI>In∣garmania;</HI>
the Town and Port of <HI>Narva;</HI> the
City of <HI>Stetin;</HI> the Castle of <HI>Notteburg;</HI> the
City of <HI>Wyburgh;</HI> the Isle of <HI>Aland;</HI> and the
whole Country of <HI>Finland,</HI> a Province of it∣self,
large enough, to be call'd a Kingdom,
and seated upon the Sea Coast, for 300 Miles
in Length, where it is to be noted that the
strong Castle of <HI>Helsingvos,</HI> the last and only Place
which the <HI>Swedes</HI> held in that Province, was
taken at the relanding of the Army there; so
that the whole Country was subdu'd, and the
<HI>Swedes</HI> put into a terrible Fright, even in the
Heart of <HI>Sweden.</HI> Nay, a Body of <HI>Muscovites</HI> had
transp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted themselves over the <HI>Bothnick</HI> Gulph,
and had landed on the Main of Old <HI>Sweden</HI>
it self, <HI>that is to say,</HI> in the Province of <HI>West Both∣nia,</HI>
<PB N="417" REF="426"/>
where they had ravaged the Country,
burnt several considerable Towns and Villages,
where they had taken <HI>Uma</HI> the Capital of that Part
of the Country, and burnt it to the Ground;
after which, they extended Northwards to <HI>Torne,</HI>
and destroy'd the Iron Works, which are very
Considerable that Way; and did incredible
Damage. Another Body of their Troops, ad∣vanced
from <HI>Finland, North,</HI> into the Country of
<HI>East Bothnia,</HI> where the <HI>Swedish</HI> General <HI>Ahren∣field</HI>
Commanded, and endeavour'd to fight him;
but he not daring to come to Action, retir'd North∣ward,
into a remote and inaccessible, and indeed,
barren and uninhabited Country, where it was
not practicable to follow him, leaving the Coun∣try
of <HI>East Bothnea</HI> open to the Spoil.</P>
<P>THESE things merrited a Triumph, as much
as the <HI>Roman</HI> Generals merited a Triumph for
the Conquest of the most powerful Nations they
subdued.</P>
<P>BUT to come to the Progress of the War
again, the <HI>Winter</HI> was no more past in Idle∣ness
than the <HI>Summer;</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> an active
and restless Genius, in all his great Underta∣kings,
kept his Enemies the <HI>Swedes</HI> in Continu∣al
Allarms, with the Rumour of an Attempt pro∣jected
to pass the <HI>Bothnick</HI> Gulph in the Time
of Frost, with his whole Army over the Ice;
those who know the Country, and those Seas,
know very well, that as the <HI>Bothnick</HI> Sea is not
deep, and consequently not agitated much
by Storms, and also, that there is very lit∣tle
Tide, or Current there, it is the soonest
Frozen of any part of the <HI>Baltick Sea;</HI> and
then, as its Scituation is more Northerly than
<PB N="418" REF="427"/>
any other part of the <HI>Baltick,</HI> lying extended
to the 64th Degree of <HI>North</HI> Latitude; and
it thereby infinitely colder than the rest, so
it is no strange thing to find that Sea like
one solid Rock of Ice, for four or five Months
together, and the Country People travel∣ling
over it themselves, passing and re-pas∣sing
as securely as on dry Land, from the
one <HI>Bothnea</HI> to the other: Hence it was no
improbable thing, that the <HI>Czar</HI> might, if his
Views had been that Way, have marched with
his whole Army over that Sea, not excluding his
Baggage, Cannon, and Waggons.</P>
<P>BUT tho' his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty thought fit to
allarm the <HI>Swedes</HI> with the daily Apprehen∣sions
of such an Attempt; yet, this was really
none of his present View: However, it had
this Effect, it continually harrass'd the <HI>Swedish</HI>
Army, in Marching, and counter Marching,
as their own Fears directed them; nay, it went
farther, for as the <HI>Swedes</HI> had transported two
several Bodies of their regular Troops to the
Isle of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gen</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and a thind to
<HI>Wisma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> So that General <HI>Ducker</HI> who command∣ed
there, threatned to take the Field, and ad∣vance
into <HI>Holstein,</HI> and <HI>Jutland,</HI> as Count
<HI>Steinboch</HI> had done, having this Advantage in
such an Enterprize, <HI>viz.</HI> that he had no Army
of <HI>Russians</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> to follow him in the
Rear. The Allarm given to the <HI>Swedes</HI> in their
own Country, by his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zarish</HI> Majesty hovering
over their Coast, as above, had obliged them to
send for 7000 Men back again from <HI>Pomeren,</HI>
to reinforce their Army at Home, and to de∣fend
the Capital of their Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="428"/>
THUS the <HI>Danes,</HI> were deliver'd at once by
the powerful Fleet of the <HI>Czar,</HI> from an Ene∣my,
which they dreaded in <HI>Holstein;</HI> and from
a War that would have perhaps been too heavy
for them, as well for the power of their Ene∣mies,
as the Expence of it; for the <HI>Swedes</HI> would
at least have ruin'd all the <HI>Danish</HI> Dominions on
the <HI>Terra firm,</HI> by the Contributions they would
have drawn from thence, and the Ravages of
the open Country, from whence the capital City
is furnish'd with daily Provisions.</P>
<P>THIS very View gave the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
an an additional Vigour in his new Design of
invading <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> nothing could more effectually
deliver him from the just Apprehensions of a
Visit from <HI>Pomerania,</HI> as a Descent upon <HI>Schonen,</HI>
carrying the War home into the Heart of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and finding the <HI>Swedes</HI> Employment to defend
their own Towns, instead of giving them Leisure
to meditate the Invasion of those Abroad.</P>
<P>THIS Winter the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> came from
<HI>Turkey,</HI> and arriv'd Incognito at the City of <HI>Stralsund</HI>
in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and the World had great Expectations,
that his coming there would give a new Turn to
the Affairs of <HI>Europe;</HI> but that Prince, whose positive
Temper, averse to the Advice of his best Friends,
push'd him upon the most desperate, and incon∣sistent
Actions, quickly made all his Neighbours
easie, as to their Apprensions of his Power, for
embroiling himself with the King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> and the
Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> since King of <HI>England;</HI> he fi∣nish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
his own Ruin by absolutely refusing the most
honourable Proposal for Peace that could be made
to him, and engaging himself in a new War to his
Ruin, for he was finally besiged both by Sea and
<PB N="420" REF="429"/>
Land, in his City of <HI>Stralsund,</HI> and at last forc'd
to make his Escape in a small Vessel by Sea,
which landed him in <HI>Sweden,</HI> leaving behind him all
his Dominions, and all his hopes in the Empire
of <HI>Germany,</HI> in which he never set his Foot af∣terwards.</P>
<P>AND here necessity, and the swelling of these
Pages beyond Expectation too far, obliges us to
break of the History. From this Period a new
Scene of War was drawn out, in which the <HI>Czar</HI>
of <HI>Muscovy</HI> had not only a great Share, but
which ended infinitely to his Glory, and the
Security of his Allies. The <HI>Swedes</HI> were push'd
at their own Doors; their Country invad∣ed;
the rich Copper Works, and Iron Works,
on which the Commerce of their Nation de∣pended,
were ruined; and to finish all, their
invulnerable Monarch, <HI>as they thought him to be,</HI>
was Slain; their Treasure exhausted, and they
were at last obliged to yield to their Misfor∣tunes,
and make a Peace inexpressibly disad∣vantagious
to themselves, and in Proportion
glorious to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty; all which Acti∣ons
remain to be Recorded, and are sufficient
to make another History.</P>
<P>MAY some other Pen be honoured with the
Narration, that the Glories of our August Em∣peror
of <HI>Russia,</HI> may be handed to Posterity, in
a manner suitable to his Fame; and to the
Merit of the greatest Prince in all the Eastern
Part of the World. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
