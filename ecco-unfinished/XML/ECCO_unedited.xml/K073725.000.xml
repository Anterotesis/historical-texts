<HEAD>TO THE DIGNITARIES OF THE Church of <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Lords,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU always provide the inferior Clergy, your <HI>menial Church Servants,</HI> with a form of prayer to be used on the day of national fasting, but you totally neglect to furnish them with sermons suitable for such an occasion.—Your remissness in this particu∣lar is perfectly consistent with the tenor of your conduct: — You concur in the appoint∣ment of General Fasts; but, when you wal∣low in excess and riot, alas! you leave your curates, poor souls, to experience the prac∣tical <HI>part of fasting.</HI> In this you follow the example of your ancient friends the <HI>Phari∣sees</HI>— <Q>You bind heavy burdens, and grievous “to be borne, and lay them on men's shoul∣ders, but you will not move them with one ”of your fingers.</Q></P>
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
<P>How often, my Lords, have you squandered more money at <HI>one entertainment,</HI> than two or three curates have for the support of them∣selves and their numerous families for a whole year?—The reflection would make any person blush, except <HI>a modern Bishop</HI>—Your con∣sciences are now stupified through volup∣tuousness, but the day is nigh at hand when your titles will not avail, nor your lawn sleeves and mitres protect you from the righteous judgment which will be passed upon every one. When men will not receive a partial sentence or be judged according to their external appear∣ance, but where all distinction of characters will be laid aside.</P>
<P>The Author of the following discourses, having during the course of his life lived at a considerable distance from the <HI>Court</HI> is un∣unaccustomed to flattery; you will therefore excuse his freedom—The language is plain and unequivocal; but perhaps there is more truth contained in them than if written by an <HI>arch∣bishop.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SERMONS FOR THE ENSUING FAST-DAY.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Ecclesiates. x. 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Wo to the O land! when thy King is a child and thy Princes eat in the morning.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS land in which we live, one would think, has no reason to be afraid of the first part of this heavy wo in the text; for the So∣vereign of the British Empire has himself a nu∣merous and beautiful family of children, which in <HI>one</HI> sense clears him of the imputation of being a <HI>child.</HI> With respect to the latter part of this wo, there may be some reason to hesitate. The word in the text which signifies Princes, is not confined in its signification to Princes of the Blood Royal, but may also be applied to Chief Men, or the companions of princes,—or it may
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>be used to signify Privy Counsellors, or Minis∣ters of State. When persons of this character mind eating in the morning more the <HI>necessary</HI> business of the commonwealth it is truly a woful thing to any nation.</P>
<P>The Hebrew word (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) here signifies to <HI>be given to voluptuousness,</HI> or to behave like children, —to run to their food before they apply to their business. The wise man seems to have had in his view, a King and Princes of like characters, and both resembling children in their conduct and behaviour. The learned have said some strange things upon this passage, which I shall not here translate.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Cujus rex peur <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> aetate unde rerum imperitus est &amp; regendi imprudens aliorum ductui obnoxius.

<P>This note which was published an hundred years ago and apwards, is somewhat like the speech of a certain noble Lord, which the Editors of the General Evening Post said they did not think eligible to publish at large. As little is it judged eligible at present, to translate this note. The substance of it is, however, pretty well diffused through the discourse, and the English reader will suffer small loss for want of a translation.</P></NOTE> But it appears sufficiently
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>evident that Solomon, understood in this place, by eating and drinking in the morning, (for the word signifies both) those nocturnal revels where people sit up till three or four in the morning, and go to rest when they should go to business, and are not fit for employment till mid∣day. This is a most woful practice for both soul and body; for health and business, for pu∣blic and private affairs. For in the first place, it is a preposteous way of wasting time, by turning day into night, and wasting health, insensibly, by wearing out the animal spirits for want of rest and natural refreshment. For any person who is possessed of half a grain of human nature, must know, that if he is employed as he ought to be through the day, he will be in∣clined to rest when night approaches; or if he does not enjoy rest suitably in the night, he will be but very unfit for his employment next day. It is no wonder that their <HI>Excellencies</HI> and <HI>Lordships,</HI> manage public affairs aukwardly, with such giddy heads and muddy brains, as they must have, when they return from <HI>masquerades, cotteries,</HI> and other such like places of <HI>dullness</HI> and <HI>stupefaction.</HI> How can it be otherwise? When they eat when they should sleep, and rest and lol in their coaches when they should be about Business. But what renders the matter worse, their natural vigour is exhausted by living contrary to nature, that they are not able to bear the burden of government upon their shoulders. Their senses turn languid,
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>their spirits, torpid, and their minds stupid:—and their whole frame listless to every thing, ex∣cept a repetition of the very same things, which render them <HI>unfit</HI> for all the active employments of government. How wan are their complexions? how pale their cheeks! how languid ther looks? —and gorey their eyes?—Solomon says, <HI>Who have red eyes? those that tarry long at the wine.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, this woful practice disorders the judgment, and inflames the imagination. When the organs of sensation are relaxed through in∣temperance, dissipation and want of natural rest, it is impossible that the judgment can be clear, or have that freeness of exercise that it would have, provided the soul had sound organs to act in, and the animal functions were nourished by wholesome supplies of natural and seasonable food and rest.</P>
<P>This woful course of life also inflames the imagination, and pushes on the whole man to ir∣rational and forbidden gratifications.—Whatever is the cause, the effect is undeniable, that men under the power of intemperance will pursue objects that they would be ashamed to approach, provided they were sober and under the govern∣ment of reason. The danger that arises to a nation when Princes eat in the morning is very great; for when their judgments are blinded and their imaginations inflamed, they are ready to pursue those objects of desire which fancy sug∣gests, instead of those which reason and judg∣ment would dictate to sober persons, and so they either forget national concerns, to pursue their own fancy, or manage all public concerns ac∣cording to imagination, and when whim con∣trary to reason and sound judgment. It is not
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>to be supposed that their lordships who have gone to bed gorged with high seasoned food and strong drink at four o'clock in the morning, can be well qualified to judge of an express from Paris, Madrid, or the West Indies. For though they may be wiser than other men, (which is even problematical) yet they are not naturally stronger, and must have rest and slcep as well as others. And it is plain that their wisdom can be of little service to the nation, when they are asleep. It is true, they have se∣cretaries that are intended to wait upon busi∣ness in their absence;—but wicked fame says, that they also eat in the morning, and sleep as long as their masters.</P>
<P>Thirdly, There is another woful thing that happens when Princes and Privy Counsellors eat in the morning, and that is, that it gives the world reason to infer, that the Sovereign, though he may be a man in point of age, is but a child in conduct, when he employs such irregular and slothful servants to manage the bu∣siness of the empire; for it seldom happens that the first and latter part of this wo are separated. If Great Britain is at this day an exception, it will be an happy circumstance; for by all accounts the case is different in other nations, where Kings, Princes, and Privy Counsellors, pur∣sue the same course. With regard to those na∣tions where there are no Kings, we can form no argument from them concerning the wise man's wo; the people in those countries pro∣bably eat and sleep all together.—But this must be accounted a part of their infelicity; for when a nation has ministers of state to watch for their interest, they may all sleep as sound and as long as they please.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<P>When Princes eat in the morning there are the following woful things that generally happen to the community.</P>
<P N="1">1. The manners of the nation are neglected, and a wide door opened for all sorts of vice and immorality. The rulers of a nation are ap∣pointed not so much to collect the revenue, as to restrain vice and immorality and maintain good order.—Common Excise Officers may per∣form the first, but it requires persons of genius, and true virtue to perform the latter. In re∣straining of vice, the most easy and the most eli∣gible method for rulers, and magistrates to hold forth a good example to the people, and shew the inferior ranks of mankind, that virtue has some real meaning by practising it them∣selves. It is amazing how the inferior degrees of mankind look up to those above them, from the scullion in the kitchen to his Grace's wait∣ing servant. It is no uncommon thing to find all the imitations of high life below stairs, as many of low life above. Men who would desire to make their duties and influence, serve the good and advantage of society, must beware of giving bad examples to those whom they know are ready to form their conduct upon the pat∣terns they give them. It will hardly be found in history, that the common people were wicked and dissolute, when those of high rank were vir∣tuous. In the body politic as in the body na∣tural, the most dangerous and deadly distempers proceed from the head. When the children of Israel rebelled against the Lord in the matter of Korah, they had <HI>Princes</HI> of the congregation for their leaders; and when they committed <HI>whore∣dom</HI> at <HI>Shittim,</HI> they had <HI>Zimri the son of Salu, a
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>Prince of a chief house among the Simeonites,</HI> for a leader in this <HI>filthy</HI> and <HI>abominable</HI> practice.</P>
<P>When magistrates and rulers, who are sup∣posed to be men of wisdom and understanding, and better qualified to distinguish between good and evil than the vulgar, commit deeds un∣worthy of their characters, and contrary to mo∣ral laws, the common ranks of men are ready conclude that there is not much malignity in vice as they were wont to apprehend. They therefore are tempted to presume in trying an imitation, and if charged with transgressing di∣vine laws, have the excuse ready, that they on∣ly, have done what his Lordship set them the example to do.</P>
<P>It will never be in the power of any state to restrain vice by penal laws, without adding the force of example and wise tutorage. Vice and immorality are best prevented by good educa∣tion, and wise example; and if rulers would have their subjects to obey laws, they ought to shew them by their example the propriety, and advantage of obeying them. It is the love of justice, that will make men dutiful and virtu∣ous; the fear of punishment will make them servile but not honest.</P>
<P>If they can once overcome this fear; they will no longer pay any regard to duty.—And there are many ways of getting the better of <HI>even</HI> the fear of death itself, which in most states is considered the highest punishment that the laws can inflict. Habits of vice and wickedness too often produce infidelity and temporary atheism, which make vicious men consider death as only a deliverance from present pain and uneasiness.
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>Caesar spoke the sentiments of more than himself, when he said, <HI>that in sorrow and wretchedness death is rest from trouble, and not a punishment, and that it puts an end to all the evils of mankind.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">In luctu atque miseriis mortem aerumnarum requiem; non cruciatum esse; eam cuncta mortalium mala dissolvere; ultra neque curae neque gaudio locum esse. This no uncom∣mon language among even some modern legislators who are said like Solomon's princes to eat in the morning.
<P>Caesaris oratio pro Catalina.</P></NOTE> There is no manner of doubt but that many of those cri∣minals who suffer the punishment which the laws have adjudged for their crimes, firmly believe that there is no justice in these laws when they see themselves dragged to execution for trans∣gressions which others commit in an higher de∣gree with impunity, and are also honoured and preferred for committing them. There are few so destitute of common sense, as not to perceive that there is as much criminality in robbing a nation of millions, as plundering an individual of a few pounds or shillings, and that sheding the blood of thousands of innocent persons, is as criminal as taking away the life of one man. How can rulers expect that the subjects will pay due regard to mercy, judgment and faith, when those in the high departments of state, and the exalted stations of life, commit those vices for which they are most severely punished? Persons who form the rule of their conduct from the examples of those above them, and not from the laws themselves, will never be perswaded that they can justly deserve punishment for do∣ing what rulers themselves have pointed out to them to do by their example.</P>
<P>It is folly of the most extravagant nature, and for which it is not easy to find a name, for le∣gislators
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>to imagine, that any laws can be bind∣ing upon the consciences of men that are not immediately founded in justice. Justice is one of those cardinal virtues which the heathens de∣clared to be self-evident, and Cicero who per∣haps was a greater man than any in the British senate, considered justice as a thing, concerning which there could be no doubt, or if any doubt arose the thing ought to be done.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Quo circa bene praecipiunt. qui vetant quidquam agere, quod dubites aequum sit an iniquum. Aequitas enim civet ipsa per se; dubitatio, cogitationem insinificat injurice.</NOTE> What is not self-evident in matters of right and wrong ought never to be done; and it can never be self-evident that little crimlnals should suffer, and great ones be preferred for their wickedness. No authority can sanctify what is in its own na∣ture wrong, nor oblige men to yield obedience to preceipts or laws which are contrary to sta∣tutes, already confessed on all hands to be just and righteous.</P>
<P>When the King is a child and Princes eat in the morning, it is no uncommon thing to see those muddy legislators exagerate modern sta∣tutes, and enforce them by the severest sancti∣ons, which are diametrically opposite and con∣trary to ancient laws, and fundamental institu∣tions. Rulers cannot be supposed well qualified to make laws for others when they, under the immediate influence of intemperance, and their senses and understandings annihilated, and in a real delerium. Princes and Ministers of State, can but ill advise for the good of a nation, when they are led tottering from the bagnio to their palaces, and tumble into their couches in a state of insensibility. Supported by such <HI>tot∣tering</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>pillars, it is no wonder the <HI>state staggers,</HI> and the <HI>throne shakes.</HI> These men it is true have their apologies, but they are not new; Julius Caesar, as base a man as ever disgraced govern∣ment, made the same apology more than seven∣teen hundred years ago,—intended to colour the actions of a set of men of a similar cha∣racter. <Q>Men of inferior rank, says he, pass “their days in obscurity, and when they com∣mit any error through passion, few observe it; their fortune and reputation are alike; but those who are employed in high offices of the state, their conduct is known by all men, whence it comes to pass, that men in ”high stations, enjoy the smallest share of li∣berty.</Q><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Qui demissi in obscuram vitam habent, si quid ira∣cundia delinquere, pauci sciunt: fama atque fortuna pares sunt; qui magna imperio praediti in excelso aetatem agunt eorum facta cuncti mortales novere. Ita in maxuma fortuna, minima licentia est. Orati pro Catalina.</NOTE></P>
<P>This thread bare apology is not founded in truth; for there are many transactions of the greatest consequence and importance to the pu∣blic that millions know nothing of. How few are acquainted with the revenue of the Secretary at War, or the emoluments of the Secretary of the Navy? Few people know or believe that the perquisites of these offices amount to nearly as much money as the whole amount of the late new tax upon houses. If the emoluments of the Secretary to the navy were 30,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year besides the salary, in the days of Sir Harry Vane, which he conscientiously gave up to the pu∣blic, though he had a patent for life, what must these emoluments amount to now, when
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>the expence of the British navy is more than ten times the extent that it was at that period. The secretary then had only four-pence the pound for the money audited, and now the rate is six-pence. The great financier as his friends call him, appears to be a mere child in the du∣ties of his office, for he might have had more than his house tax, and post-horse revenue just at his hand, and the blessings of the nation for taking of it; whereas all-ends of the earth where there are Englishmen, curse him by night and by day. The reduction of these enormous sums to the standard of moderation would have answered the purpose of the tax upon houses, which is so grievious to many poor families.</P>
<P>Secondly, When Princes eat in the morning, they devour more in gratifying their lusts and appetites, than would supply the exigencies of government, and greatly relieve the community. The all devouring passions of princes and cour∣tiers waste more treasure, than the real necessi∣ty of the state, and when they are of the cha∣racter to which this <HI>wo</HI> relates, they generally waste all in doing nothing. The largest sums are not sufficient to supply the vast desires of their unbounded lusts; what would support a peace establishment, or even carry on a <HI>just</HI> and <HI>necessary</HI> was, is insufficient to supply the inordi∣nate demands of regal luxury, and ministerial dissipation. What things are necessary for the welfare of a state, are not difficult to be obtain∣ed; the superfluities of rulers require vast sums; the universe itself is insufficient to supply them. The foolish fopperies that are supposed necessary to ornament and dignify government, require larger sums, than the necessary and substantial requisites that support its vitals and give energy
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>to its exertions. Even in time of war there is more expended upon splendour, than upon the requisites really needful for carrying it on; and the expence of guns, swords, ammunition and provisions are scarcely to be compared with the sums wasted upon the supersluities of general offi∣cers, the gains of contractors, the profits of officers of state, and secret expences. There is even more money expended in pressing of one man to serve in our navy, than would be sufficient to enlist three, under good management. But when Princes eat in the morning, their meanest dupes must imitate them, and nothing less can serve them than an expence, equivalent to the lusts of them all. Under the influence and direction of such managers, it is not to be expected that a com∣munity can prosper either in peace or war. In peace the number of unnecessary offices of state re∣quire an expence equal to an ordinary war esta∣blishment, and in time of war provision is not made so much to furnish the army and navy with good men, good officers, and other things neces∣sary for carrying it on, as to supply the friends of those rulers that eat and drink in the morning, with all things that their appetites require.</P>
<P>It can be for no other reason that in some nations in Europe, a great number of half-pay officers, able and willing to serve their country and King, are refused, and not called to duty in the time of danger;—when boys and striplings, ignorant of military service, are placed at the head of regi∣ments and companies, for the sake of emolu∣ment, that in the time of peace, they may riot on the vitals of their country, and idly spend what they never merited. The honour and safety of the nation is not so much the study of depraved and dissipated men, as the gratification
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>of their own appetites, and the support of those that will minister to their pride and ambition. They endeavour to support the last for the sake of the first. Instances of this kind are frequently to be met with in some parts of the world, where men who are pliable to the will of a minister, though unqualified to serve in their profession, are preferred to others possessed of the most consumate and finished accomplishments. This shews that the honour and happiness of the nation are not the chief study, nor the real end which they have in view in their ad∣ministration, otherwise they would prefer the wisest and best men to promote the welfare of their coun∣try.</P>
<P>When the lusts and appetites of Princes become masters of their understanding, they also affect their hearts, and render them callous to virtue and common weal; they feel the force of no objects, so much as those that supply the immediate crav∣ing of appetites, or that stand in the way of their gratification. Their whole desire is bent towards the one, and their aversion against the other. It was a principle of this sort that inclined the Son of Solomon to reject the counsel of the old men, that were his father's counsellors, and embrace the counsel of the young men that had been brought up with himself, and it is abundantly evident, that they gave that prince the advice which he follow∣ed, because they knew his passions and their own inclined after the same objects. It is manifest that the good of the common weal was neither the stu∣dy of the King nor his ministers. Solomon had his own son in view when he uttered these words, <HI>Wo to thee, O land, when thy King is a Child! and thy Princes eat in the morning.</HI></P>
<P>It is very remarkable that dissipation and tyranny
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>have in all ages kept pace with one another, and that when princes were of the complexion referred to by the wise man, they were always oppressive and arbitrary. This observation has held good from the age before the flood until this day, and there is no reason to expect that ever the charm will be broken. One immorality will always make way for another. One reason why profligacy produces tyranny is, that men create new desires, by cor∣rupting their natural appetites, and from this cor∣ruption there flows such a vast generation, that the world itself is not able to supply them. From hence it comes to pass that men are never satisfied with what they have, but grasp at more, and when their own cannot serve them, they covet what be∣longs to others.—And such is the nature of this propensity, that if they cannot obtain what they desire freely, provided they have power, they will take it by force.</P>
<P>There is great danger in all indulgence; what is not agreeable at first, will by indulgence become necessary; and use, and frequent repetition, will make even the most disagreeable things become ne∣cessary, and familiar. The nearer men approach to nature, their appetites will be the fewer, and those they have more easily satisfied; indulge the natural ones, beyond measure, and they will cre∣ate more new desires than the world can satisfy. Would Kings and Princes eat and drink, and be∣have as they should do, little would serve them, and their subjects would never be oppressed.—But after they have been accustomed to so much in∣dulgence, and have had such large revenues at their command, it would be a wonder of an un∣common nature, if their desires did not encrease with their abundance. There is no way to make them virtuous, and temperate, but to reduce them
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>to the standard of moderation, and make them re∣turn to virtue by the same path that they proceeded to <HI>ambition, tyranny,</HI> and <HI>dominion.</HI></P>
<P>It was observed that tyranny and dissipation have always kept pace together; but it must be always remembered also, that the latter is the parent of the former.</P>
<P>The Roman historian has in the pu∣rest and most elegant language, elucidated this observation in the character of the Romans. <Q>“After Carthage, the Rival of Rome was sub∣dued, and riches flowed in by sea and land, the good fortune of that people almost ruin∣ed them, and those who were capable of en∣during the greatest hardships with ease, were unable to behave well when they grew rich. The love of money produced the love of power, these were the materials of all the rest of their evils. Covetousness subverted faith and probity, and other virtues. To indulge these they gratified pride and cruelty, and turned infidel and venal. Ambition made them false, and made them say one thing and think another. They estimated friendship and enmi∣ty, not according to their nature, but according to what advantage might arise from them. They put a good face upon the worst designs. He adds, after honour and riches were united, glory, power and dominion attended them, vir∣tue grew obsolete, and poverty became a re∣proach. Integrity was accounted ill-nature. Luxury, avarice and pride sprung from riches and corrupted the young men, in consequence of which they profusely wasted what was their own, and coveted what belonged to others.
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>They paid no regard to modesty, chastity, ho∣nesty ”or religion.</Q><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Cathaga Aemula imperii Romani, ab stirpe interiit, cuncta maria patebant, saevire fortuna ac miscere omnia cae∣pit, tui labores, pericula, dubias atque asperas res facile to∣leraverant, iis olium divitiae, optandae aliis oneri miseriaeque furere.

The Assyrians, Medes and Persians proceeded in the same manner before the Romans, and ingrafted tyranny and slavery on luxury and dissipation. The consequence was, this rotten principle corrupted all the springs of government, and the whole fabric mouldered into dust.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They will not regard nor listen to the complaints and grievances of the people. They are so intent upon pursuing the objects of their pride and ambition, that they consider all complaints of the subjects, as unreasonable clamour factiously intended to interrupt their pleasures and gratifications. In all corrupt states the rulers
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>generally consider the complaints of the people as unreasonable;—and the true reason and cause of this is, that through habits of vice and dissipa∣tion, their own reason is so depraved, that they are like those rulers mentioned by the prophet, that called good evil and evil good, put light for darkness and darkness for light.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Isaiah, v. 20.</NOTE> Reason speaks the same language in all men, but false reasoning differs much from reason,—as much as a shadow differs from the substance. Reason, and self-evident truth are the same, and all men can perceive it, unless blinded by prejudice, or when they wilfully shut their eyes through corruption. The human mind has its diseases as well as the body, which make it perceive objects in an unna∣tural light. The lower ranks of men as they generally follow nature more nearly than those in high life seldom behave so unreasonably as those who call themselves their superiors; and with regard to objects of common sense, they are full better judges than the others.</P>
<P>They will smile at a man that will tell them there is no heat in fire, nor smell in a rose, and if he insist upon it they will account him mad, and give over reasoning with him. And should any tell them that they are not judges of their own rights and privileges, when they have plain statutes by which they determined, they consider them as ill designing persons who wanted to impose on them. They would be ready to tell them, and not without reason, that if there were any thing in government which they were incapable of un∣derstanding,
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>that they were also incapable of yielding to it, because obedience depends upon knowledge of right, and cannot exist with∣out it.</P>
<P>When rulers are intoxicated with ideas of power, and have their passions inflamed with dissipation, they are ready to imagine that the whole community are as foolish as themselves; and for that reason endeavour to persuade the people that it is faction to oppose their mea∣sures, and treason to maintain their own rights.</P>
<P>Because they will not minister to the gratifi∣cation of the lusts and appetites of those who want to enslave them, they are called factious and rebellious. It is impossible that reason can demand, that government which was instituted for the good of society, should be made the greatest evil and the heaviest curse. It could never be the intent of the appointment of go∣vernment, that rulers should have a right to dis∣pose of more than belonged to the right ad∣ministration thereof. With regard to ostentati∣ous splendor, it adds nothing to the dignity of government as a moral institution; for their is more true dignity in a magistrate executing just laws in the home spun manufacture of his own country, than in one supporting unrighteous de∣crees, and arbitrary authority, dressed in ermine, or trimmed in gold.</P>
<P>Mankind are not in general so ignorant, as to suppose that pageantry and superfluity, add dignity to government, and they can perceive either the fool or the villain throngh all the gar∣nishing
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>and trappings of office. Neither the star nor the garter are so far able to dazzle their eyes, as to hinder them from perceiving the black spots that are underneath them, or, of discerning the the wolf in sheeps cloathing. Rulers fondly imagine that the people are not qualified to discern the injustice of refusing their reasonable requests, and for that reason sport themselves with their petitions and remonstrances; but in this they display more their own want of judg∣ment than the people do want of sense and un∣derstanding.</P>
<P>It is somewhat strange, that princes have not learned from experience and observation, that all unnecessary expence and splendour in govern∣ment are only prognostications of the downfall of states and forerunners of their ruin. The history of the four great monarchies, may serve to instruct all future generations of the folly of pageantry, and the unnecessary expence in the government of nations. Luxury and dissipation has generally produced a desire of dominion, and made princes neglect paying a just regard to the complaints and grievances of their sub∣jects; for they have been for the most part, fondest of dominion when they were least fit to govern, and near to their downfall.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly a woful thing to a nation, to be obliged to supply the extravagances of men, who instead of ruling it with wisdom and justice, spend the substance thereof in all the vile arts of corruption and licentiousness. And what adds to this wo is, that they charge the people with being licentious, after they have
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>taken all the pains in their power to make them so.</P>
<P>Yet bad as the people in general may be, they would shudder, at the thoughts of many acts of wickedness that are committed by their superiors. The charge of licentiousness comes with an ill grace from those who are living constantly in the transgression of both divine and human laws, and have nothing to save them from punishment, except the partiality of go∣vernment, and the indulgence of divine mercy.</P>
<P>With regard to the charge of faction and rebellion which arbitrary rulers bring against the people, it may be returned upon themselves, where these crimes are oftener to be found than among the people. It must pro∣ceed from their not knowing what is the na∣ture of rebellion, that they do not take charge home to themselves.</P>
<P>The prophet Isaiah will help them to under∣stand what is properly rebellion. Thy princes are rebellious and the companions of thieves, every one loveth gifts, and followeth after re∣wards, they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come before them.</P>
<P><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Isa. 1.25,</NOTE> From this description it is plain that princes may be rebellious, and that when they are the com∣panions
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>of theives they come under that pre∣dicament.</P>
<P>There are three things that constitute rebellion according to this description.</P>
<P N="1">(1) Joining interests and partnership with theives and dishonest persons. These are such as take what is not their own, and apply it to their own purposes. This is a course compliment to princes, but as it is given by an inspired pro∣phet it cannot be taken amiss.</P>
<P>His rebellion against God and the laws, for rulers to take more than justly is due to them or join interests with those who do so.</P>
<P>It is also dishonest to promote or procure laws, that may make it legal to give them more than the people can afford; this comes under the notion of theft and rebellion according to the prophet's idea.</P>
<P>The princes of Judah and Israel went part∣ners with the sovereign in the plunder of the nation. They probably voted large supplies to the King, because they knew they would re∣ceive a share of the revenue, and might pro∣mote a law for encreasing the civil list in hopes of serving in his Majesty's houshold; but this was theft and rebellion against justice, and the laws of the land.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
<P>Those who obey the fundamental laws of go∣vernment cannot be rebels, though it is mani∣fest that legislators that make laws contrary to natural justice and the law of God may be guilty of rebellion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Seeking after gifts, and following rewards are joined with rebellion. This probably referred to a vote of credit, which administration of Judah pro∣cured to answer the expence of secret service, without any design of doing any thing with it for the good of the nation. This is joined with theft and rebellion.</P>
<P>And indeed what can be greater theft than to procure the credit of a nation to raise money for the service thereof, and apply it to private purposes? Were such a thing done in Britain, the whole nation would have reason to cry out against it.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Not executing the laws impartially is joined with rebellion, or is rather a part of it. The fatherless and the widow were either ne∣glected or made feel all the force of penal laws when they were guilty, when those who had influence in a tribe or could serve the ends of administration were rescued from justice, when they had committed the most capital crimes.</P>
<P>This is by the prophet accounted the very
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>height of rebellion, and is often committed by princes and their companions.</P>
<P>Thus it is plain, that rebellion is not a crime peculiar to the people only, but is also some∣times to be found at the very springs of go∣vernment.</P>
<P>Some would make us believe that kings and princes cannot be guilty of rebellion, but the scripture informs us otherwise.</P>
<P>As we are certain from the best authority that even princes may rebel, the question now is, whether they ought to be punished for it like other rebels, and who can lawfully punish them? This question requires a little caution, and must be determined by scripture; and it is hoped then that no Christians will dissent from the conclusion.</P>
<P>Whether there is any difference between try∣ing Kings and Princes for rebellion, and pu∣nishing them without trying them, I shall leave to the tories, and casuists to determine. For there has been more noise concerning the trial of King Charles the First, than concerning the punishment of all the rebellious Princes since the conquest.</P>
<P>This Prince is the only Martyr we find a∣mong the Kings of England, though many of
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>them have suffered for their tyranny and rebel∣lion against the laws.</P>
<P>The Kings in this country are considered as the source of the laws, and it is supposed that if the King could die, that all law would be at an end; for this reason the lawyers have made our Kings immortal, and laid it down as a first principle that the King cannot die.</P>
<P>It ought to have been seriously considered before such a mysterious maxim had been laid down as a first principle, whether laws or kings were first appointed by the Almighty; for if ever we can find laws without Kings, it will ap∣pear manifest that they are not necessary to the being of government, but that laws may continue when there is no monarch.</P>
<P>It is plain, that there was law before we hear any thing of any ruler except God himself, from whence it would appear, that the exist∣ence of laws does not depend upon any human regal authority, and though that Kings should chance to die, the laws if just will continue immortal; if they are unjust they ought never to exist.</P>
<P>But to make this point as plain as possible, it must be considered that all government orginally proceeded from God; and this rule of government is expressed two ways by the law of nature, and express and positive pre∣cepts in the divine word, these are the two ways by which God speaks to men concerning go∣vernment. The execution of this civil government is left to the wisdom of society to form.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
<P><GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/>it in what shape men please, provided they do not proceed contrary to nature or divine positive laws. All men are supposed capable of keeping or trans∣gressing the laws, from whence arises rewards and punishments. But there is no infallible legisla∣tor except the Deity; it is he only that can do no wrong. No human authority can raise an in∣dividual in society above the laws, or render that individual free from the penalty of them in case of transgression. That a king has no peers, and consequently cannot be tried by his subjects, is a maxim of human invention; for as he is only a servant in trust, if he betray or abuse his trust, though he may not have peers, he has undoubtedly superiors, to whom he is accountable in justice. The whole community are his superiors, though individual are his subjects, when he observes the laws. When his superiors divest him of his trust for abusing it, he becomes then only equal to other individuals, and consequently is <HI>par communitatis,</HI> a peer of the community, and liable to the sanction of the laws like others. That community which set up one man to execute the laws, may appoint others to judge him for fundamentally destroying the end of his appointment. If God had created kings before subjects, or signified that mankind were made for their behoof, and bound to be suffi∣cient to them under all considerations; in this case a monarch could have had no peers, but would have been as absolute over men, as Adam was over the beasts. But there is no account of this doctrine in scripture, and reason can never suppose it.</P>
<P>That monarchs have been called to account by the people for prostitution of government, with divine approbation, the history of the son of Solo∣mon, and of Amaziah, kings of Judah, are suffi∣cient proof. The story of the first is recorded
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>1 Kings xii, and of the latter, 2 Chron. xxv. The crime of the first was his refusing to listen to the humble petition of his subjects, when they requested to be eased of the heavy burdens they groaned un∣der; and the crime of the latter was, his corrupt∣ing religion and entering into an unjust war with the king of Israel, in which he lost a vast number of his subjects, and reduced the nation to great distress. The history of these two princes shews plainly what people may do without displeasing, or rather what power he has lodged in their hands.</P>
<P>It is a vulgar proverb, that some people are twice children; this is sometimes the lot of kings, and was the case of the son of Solomon, the son of Da∣vid. This prince was forty and one years old when he came to the kingdom, and was a child of a pretty competent age; but notwithstanding his number of years, his folly shewed him to be but a child. It will be necessary to illustrate this prince's childhood in a few particulars.</P>
<P N="1">I. He obstinately refused to redress the grievances of his people, and threatened to encrease them. Though money was plenty in the days of Solomon, the people were poor; gold and silver were plenty in Jerusalem, and near the king's court, but it does not seem to have circulated as far as Shechem, and the extremities of Palastine. The real wealth of nations does not consist in a large quantity of spe∣cie, but in a proper balance of the value of money with the price of useful commodities. Solomon was rich, but his subjects were poor and oppressed. The misfortune of Solomon's government, for all the wisdom that he had, was, that he brought more luxuries into the nation, than commodities profita∣ble for the service of the people. He was also very extravagant in his houshold expences, and the
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>charges of his government. <Q>His provision for one “day was thirty measures of fine flour, and three∣score measures of meal; ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pasture, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl. He had also forty thousand stalls for horses, for chariots, and twelve thousand horse∣men.”</Q><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Kings iv. 28.</NOTE> This was a monstrous peace establish∣ment. What a dreadful expence must this have been to the nation? Under all this shew of wealth and splendour in the king, the people were poor and greatly oppressed. They therefore came to the new king, to ask a redress of their grievances, and to have their burdens made lighter. But he an∣swered them roughly and would not listen to their humble petition. <HI>They spake unto him, saying, Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xii. 4.</NOTE> There was nothing unreasonable in all this; it was a very modest request, and none except a <HI>child</HI> or a <HI>fool</HI> would have refused it. Solomon seems to have had some suspicion of his son before he died; for he says, <HI>he hated all his labour, because he was to leave it to the man that came after him, and he knew not whether he would be a wise man or a fool.</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Eccl. ii. 19.</NOTE> What his father was afraid of he now shewed pub∣licly, in refusing the request of his people, who pro∣mised willingly to serve him, provided he would enable them to do it when it was in his power, Could any thing be more childish than to continue an expensive government, and an enormous civil list, when all ranks of persons were groaning under burdens, and complaining of oppression? The com∣plaints of the people are not to be trifled with; for if princes will not relieve them, they will them∣selves
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>and the Almighty will help them to do it. It was a most childish action in that weak prince to refuse such a reasonable petition, which was altoge∣ther for his own interest to grant; for the people promised to serve him if he would ease them a lit∣tle; so he might have saved all by little condescen∣sion, which he lost through willfulness and obsti∣nacy. What can princes imagine the people are made of, when they treat them so ridiculously? They must surely think that they are not creatures of like passions with themselves, otherwise they would soon conclude that they would not suffer the treatment which they often gave them.</P>
<P N="2">II. This prince refused the advice of his father's aged and wise counsellors. <HI>They spake unto him, saying, if thou will be a servant to this people, and wilt serve them, then will they be thy servants for ever.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xii. 7.</NOTE> They deserved every one a pension for this advice; but such words of wisdom seldom meet with acceptance or preferment from childish princes. These old sages knew the office and duty of a king. It is only that of a <HI>public servant</HI> to the community, by fulfilling of which, they secure the love and obedience of their subjects for ever, which is the best security. This wise counsel did did not suit the humour of this <HI>foolish</HI> and <HI>childish</HI> prince. The word <HI>servant</HI> founded harsh in his despotic ears—A king to be a servant! How un∣courtly the thought! how unroyal the idea! These counsellors could not expect to continue long in his majesty's service; they were far too honest and free in their advice, to suit the cabinet of a <HI>childish</HI> and <HI>obstinate</HI> sovereign. They, however, discharged their duty, and gave the best proofs of their regard and love to their prince and their
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>country. These old men knew the state of the na∣tion, and were well persuaded that the people would not long suffer the oppressions they were groaning under; they understood that many things had been now warped into government that were contrary to the constitution of the kingdom. The law said, <HI>that the king should not multiply horses, nor make the people return to Egypt for that purpose, neither was he to multiply to himself silver and gold.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">deut. xvii. 16.17.</NOTE> Solomon had transgressed in all these respects, and more than all, he had been guilty of Idolatry, and had not walked in the statutes of God, like David his father. These were all flagrant breaches of the constitution, which the old men knew were unwarrantable, and that the Lord would not suffer to pass unpunished if they were persisted in. They also knew that the people's claims were just and reasonable, and ought to have been complied with, and for these reasons gave him wholesome counsel, which a wise prince would have received with thankfulness, and re∣warded with honour. But this childish prince was fonder of the gewgaws of majesty and state, than the dignity of real government; and choose rather to imitate the <HI>sins</HI> and <HI>follies</HI> of his father's reign, than covet his wisdom, wherein he was worthy of imitation.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more foolish and weak, than to violate the fundamental laws of government. It was a fundamental law of the land, that the king should not have his heart lifted up above his bre∣thren; for if this should happen, he nor his chil∣dren were to prolong their days in the kingdom. Yet this he regarded nothing, but for the sake of unjust dominion, lost the ten parts out of twelve of his whole dominions.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>
<P N="3">III. It was childish, to turn away men of age and experience, and to choose young counsellors who knew but little, and were on that account more ready to be rash and headstrong. He however ad∣vised with the young men that had grown up with himself, who gave him counsel according to his own inclination. Perhaps some of them had been his <HI>tutors,</HI> and had taught him those principles of government, which they wished to see put in prac∣tice, now when he was come to the throne. Their principles are manifest from the advice which they gave their sovereign. <HI>And they said unto him, thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying, thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us: thus shalt thou say unto them, my little finger shall be heavier than my father's loins, and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke, my father did chastise you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</HI>* This speech like many other speeches that are made for kings, this childish prince was so foolish as to deli∣ver to the people, which made them change their petition into a remonstrance, which he did not soon forget. <HI>The people answered the king and said, what portion have we in David? Neither have we inheri∣tance in the son of esse: to your tents, O Israel! now see to thine own house David.</HI> It is the greatest folly in the world for kings to drive their subjects to de∣spair; there is none can tell what a people will do when once they are awakened. All families are alike to them when their own natural rights and pri∣vileges are come in competition.</P>
<P>Whatever reasons Rehoboam might give for pre∣ferring these rash counsellors instead of the old sages who give salutary advice, they certainly had their<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 King xii. 10.</NOTE>
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>foundation in weakness and childishness. He might probably alledge that he had a right to choose his own servants and prefer his particular friends; this is a common argument with sovereigns, when they are challenged on this head. But they ought to consider, that the government of a nation is very different from the government of an houshold, or the management of domestic affairs. Though a king has a right to choose his own servants, yet these servants have no right to ruin a whole nation to please one man. A prince may appoint whom he pleases to manage the affairs of his own house with∣out consulting the nation concerning his conduct; but what relates to the public is quite different; the sovereign and all his servants, are accountable to the community for the management of public affairs; for there can be no authority with uncon∣troulable power to ruin mankind, lodged in any de∣partment of society.</P>
<P N="4">IV. It was a childish action in the son of Solo∣mon, after the ten tribes had declared themselves in∣dependent, to employ a man to bring about a recon∣ciliation who had had a chief hand in driving them to a revolt. <HI>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute, and all Israel stoned him with stones till he died.</HI>* Many differences might easily be made up, provided wise men were employed in the business; but when a difference is fomented by folly, it will never be in the power of fools to remedy it. Had some of the men, who gave the king the wise counsel, been employed in the business, it is proba∣ble it might have succeeded; their words would have weight with the people; but to employ the very Judas that kept the bag that swallowed the treasure of the nation, was the most childish scheme that<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 King xii. Verse 18.</NOTE>
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>could have been devised. Their very blood began to boil at the sight of him, and they gave him justice in a summary manner. His master was much to blame in employing him, and shewed himself a mere child in the knowledge of mankind, as well as totally deficient of all powers to govern a king∣dom. It was a sad affair for a first lord of the trea∣sury to be pelted to death with stones like a dog; he deserved perhaps all he met with, but it was a butcherly way of putting him to death. Not to give a poor sinner time to say Lord have mercy on him was a dreadful affair. But what can such men expect when the people are so terribly provoked with their wicked and oppressive measures. Had he been beheaded it would have come much to the same thing; for it was his life they wanted, and either way would have answered the purpose. The greatest folly was in sending him upon such a commission, where there was not the smallest probability that ever he would succeed. It was as improbable that Adoram could bring about a reconciliation between Judah and the ten tribes, as it was that our com∣missioners could have effected one between Great Britain and the colonies. It would have required wise men, and good men, to have performed a work of this kind. It was out of the power of pensioners, or friends of the court of either kings to do it.</P>
<P>What aggravated the childishness of this king was, that after his foolish scheme of involuntary reconci∣liation was frustrated, he determined to take ven∣geance on the revolted tribes, by levying war upon them, and intended to have added blood-shed to op∣pression. After he came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. They were no doubt all good men and
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>true to the cause of their master; persons of war∣like intrepidity, mighty men of valour, men of known character in martial exploits. There is no doubt but some of them might have been in the armies of king David, and had been at the sack∣ing of several cities, and vanquished many armies. They would therefore account it an easy matter to subdue a rebellious rabble of traiterous revolt∣ers, untrained to war, and at present under no discipline. The young men, whose counsels had caused the revolt, would be ready to support their own measures, and to persuade his majesty, that it was impossible to resist his arms; that a mean rebel∣lious mob, would never stand before the king's re∣gular troops, but would flee or lay down their arms at the sight of his standard. Kings in the <HI>second in∣fancy</HI> of their nature, are willing to believe such flattering stories, especially when their hearts are bent upon a project to which they relate. And had not the Almighty interposed his authori<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, this child of a king would have tried an experiment that might have cost him the whole of his dominions and his life into the bargain. The only thing that is wonderful in his whole character is, that he should have paid any regard to the divine authority, or have listened to the prophet that was sent to him. One would have thought that he would have appointed a fast, and tried what influence he had with heaven, and prayed for <HI>strength to resist</HI> the rebellious tribes. Child as he was, he kept clear of this folly, and kept what he had, rather than risk all, by insulting the Deity. In our times the words of the prophets pass for wind; for though they speak as plainly now as in those days, their words are not regarded, but are considered as old prognostications, whose times are elapsed, and themselves out of date. Thus in the character of the son of Solomon we have a mir∣ror, in which we may see the complexion of the se∣cond
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>infancy of princes, and the childhood of kings; we may also perceive how woeful a thing it is to a nation to be governed by a weak and obstinate prince, and how thankful we in these lands should be that it is not our lot to fall under this dismal woe.—But I conclude.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is a vast of mimickry in some people's religion; it would be happy for them if they had more sincerity and less splendor. Above all things it is the most absurd to act a face before God; for there is neither praise nor profit can attend it, and there is a sad account to be given for the part that is acted. It is a great pity but such actors were hissed off the stage now, as they will be when the grand drama is finished, and the curtains withdrawn. Fasting is an act of mortification which but few great men are acquainted with; and it is much to be questioned if our two metropolitans know much about it. Some of the curates would be better qualified to compose a form of prayer for a fast day; men who are accus∣tomed to devour many thousands a year, know but little concerning fasting. Many of the inferior clergy know from experience the nature of this ap∣pointment, and are acquainted with the practical part of the duty; the form of prayer should have been assigned to them to compose. The bishops, deans, prebendaries, and rectors, ought to have been excused till some remarkable festivity was ne∣cessary, and then they would have been the most proper masters of the ceremonies. Fasting is a very serious affair, and requires a very mortified temper
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>of mind. And what is more, it must be neither more nor less than what the Lord hath chosen. There is something whimsical in a man driving in a coach to the house of God, and fasting only the time of divine service, and galloping home to turtle and good wine in the afternoon. Fasting is now become a comedy, intended as a prologue, to tra∣gedy, wherein men endeavour to please God with a farce, that he may give them assistance, to please themselves with shedding human blood in acting the deepest tragedy. The repetition of our modern national fasting is neither more nor less, than the challenge which the Jews gave the Almighty in the third verse of this chapter; <HI>wherefore have we fasted and thou seest it not?</HI> Wherefore hast thou not, O Lord, suffered us to kill all the colonists five years ago? we fasted thrice before for this purpose, and thou regarded it not. We think it very strange that thou hast not permitted us to swallow up and devour these rebels, according to our requests which we de∣votely offered up these three times.</P>
<P>The Almighty gives his reasons why he did not regard the fasting of the Jews, and it may serve as a reason why he has not regarded our national fast∣ing. <HI>Ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness.</HI> This is a fast which the Lord has not chosen, and to which he will pay no merci∣ful regard. I shall very shortly consider a fast which the Lord hath chosen:</P>
<P N="1">I. It consists in loosing the bands of wickedness; in repealing the sanguinary laws that have been made to oppress and kill our brethren in America. They may perhaps be rebels, but what are we? or what were we when Christ died for the ungodly? It is well known that there were no laws in existence that could make them rebels a few years ago; they
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>were only created such, by the modern omnipotence of parliament. And can we imagine that a merci∣ful and gracious God will regulate his conduct, according to the pleasure of men who are more re∣gulated by private interest and ambition, than justice and faith?</P>
<P>By bands of wickedness the prophet understands unrighteous decrees made by modern authority, contrary to ancient constitutional laws of the Jewish nation, given to Israel by the hand of Moses. The laws which God gave to the Jews upon mount Ho∣reb, secured the just rights and privileges of all ranks, and no authority of any judge or judges, sanhedrim or council, could lawfully incroach upon a single privilege of the meanest of the people. In the progress of time things were altered, and man∣ners, measures, and laws were changed; for though the ancient code of laws, and rules of government which God had given them by Moses, were still the professed statutes of the nation, and went by the name of the constitutional laws of the realm, yet those statutes were perverted by modern acts of power which were diametrically opposite thereto, and determined by the government to have as much force as the ancient institutions of Moses. The Jews were at this time much in the same situation that the people of this island are in at this day; they boasted of their privileges, while they perverted them; and when they made use of power to oppress, they produced laws for so doing. The rulers had made their government a jarring system of opposite principles. <HI>Non bene junctarum dis∣cordia semina rerum.</HI> The modern acts of the le∣gislature, were contrary to the constitution, but were at the same time inforced with as powerful sanctions, and executed with more rigour. While mercy, judgment and faith lay neglected, statutes of
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>oppression were inforced with all the energy that go∣vernment was capable of. Swearing, lying, and committing adultery were winked at, while the laws concerning tythes were rigorously executed. A man might defile his neighbour's bed, seduce his daugh∣ter with impunity, but if he failed in paying tythes or of bearing his share of taxes he was most rigour∣ously prosecuted.</P>
<P>Hosea, who lived at the time with the Prophet Isaiah, informs us how relaxed this people were in points of justice and morality, even when they were rigorous in things of very small consequence.— <Q>startq;They make the King glad with their wickedness, and the Princes with their lies. They are all adul∣terers, as an oven over-heated by the baker.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Hosea vii. 5. iv. 2.</NOTE> By swearing and lying, and killing and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of Israel; is it not your office to know judgment, who hate the good, and love the evil? who pluck off the skin from off their bones; who also eat the flesh of my peo∣ple, ”and flay the skin from off them.</Q><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Micah iii. 1.</NOTE> This people, at this very time, pretended to observe the the Laws of Moses, though they were guilty of the most violent oppression and injustice. They were partial in the law; that is, they paid more regard to the new acts of State, than the Old Statutes of the Constitution which were appointed by the Al∣mighty. This appears to be our case at present. A man will be prosecuted with rigour for killing a hare, or suffering a dog to follow him, when he will be permitted to transgress the moral law with impunity. I appeal to our Magistrates, whether they are as zea∣lous in putting the laws in execution against open
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>profaners of the Sabbath day, as they are in execut∣ing them against poachers, and persons that are not judged qualified to kill a hare or a partridge? The statutes which are against immorality, and vice, are standing in our law books, as so many dead acts, while modern statutes, and unconstitutional decrees, are quickened with the utmost energy of power, and executed with the iron hand of rigour. Is the same regard paid to Magna Charta, the Petition of Rights, the Bill of Rights, and the Union Settlement be∣tween the two nations, that is paid to the Boston Port Bill, the Restraining Act, and the Canada Popish law? If our ancient statutes are founded in justice, these modern laws are undoubtedly subversive both of justice and equity. No man can prove that both are righteous decrees, unless he can prove contradic∣tions to be true, and things opposite in their nature to be the same. Such inconsistent statutes are by this Prophet called unrighteous decrees. "Wo unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and write grievousness which they have prescribed. To turn away the needy from judgment, and to take the right from the poor of my people; that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Isaiah x. 1.</NOTE> Such bands of wickedness must be loosed before such as made them can observe a fast acceptably to the Lord; for till this is done, their fast will want one essential characteristic of a fast that the Lord hath chosen. While the rulers of a nation are inforcing daily, arbitrary acts of oppression, it is abundantly daring in them to pretend to keep a fast to the Lord. Is this the fast that I have chosen saith Jehovah, to bow down his head like a bullrush, and spread sack∣cloth under him? WILT THOU CALL THIS A FAST AND AN ACCEPTABLE DAY TO THE LORD? An arbitrary and unrelenting tyrant may hang down his
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>head, and turn up his eyes, in hypocritical gestures of devotion, for the sake of being accounted <HI>pious;</HI> but he who seeth not as man seeth, says, <HI>Who hath requried this at your hand?</HI> Wilt THOU <HI>call this a fast and an acceptable day to the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>The design of the fast now appointed, is to ad∣dress the God of mercy for aid to assist the present administration in carrying on, what is called a <HI>just</HI> and <HI>necessary</HI> war, against our enemies. Among these enemies the American colonies are included. The justice and necessity of this part of the war, is very doubtful, and the other parts of it do not at all ap∣pear necessary. Till the first part of it had been proved to be just, it was soon enough to have deter∣mined any of its departments necessary; for what is not just can never be necessary. Besides, what is doubtful ought not to be assigned as a reason for war. The justice of the laws upon which this war proceeds ought to be self evident: for blood ought never be shed but when guilt is as clear as a sunbeam. The objects of one department of this war refuse the charge of rebellion, and they appeal to the funda∣mental laws of the empire, whether their claims are not the same with those that their fathers and the whole British nation insisted upon at the revolution, and have secured to them by the laws of the land. They say, they do not resist the laws, nor refuse to obey the Sovereign, but resist the violence of an ad∣ministration, that has disgraced the constitution by procuring oppressive statutes. If these modern sta∣tutes are contrary to the wholesome constitution of England, they ought to be repealed before the fast, otherwise it must be considered as a fast for carrying on a war to set aside all that the mercy of Providence wrought for this nation at the glorious re∣volution. But suppose that these laws are doubtful, and have been framed by <HI>rash</HI> and <HI>adventurous</HI> men
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>in the heat of passion and opposition, they ought not to be reasons of war and desolation. Nothing pro∣blematical ought to be reasons of war; and that the grounds of the American war are doubtful is mani∣fest, because the nation is divided concerning them, and the greatest number of individuals have always been against it. In a doubtful case a nation has no just right to go to war, but they have still less reason to ask the Lord to assist them; for there is no faith in such a doubtful proceeding, and whatsoever is not faith is sin. Men that are strongly inclined from principles of prejudice and worldly interest, may at∣tempt to trim this subject, according to their wishes, in the best manner they can; but after all is done, their arguments will be like the lamps of the foolish virgins mentioned in the gospel—<HI>dark for want of oil to give them light.</HI></P>
<P>The promoters of this fast, and the ruinous war it is intended to support, would have behaved with more propriety had they asked counsel of the lord before they began this war that now is so heavy upon their hands. But there is strong reason to suspect, that they began without consulting the will of God; and that this hypocritical fast will have no other effect, than to aggravate their guilt and iniquity. They have tried two experiments already without success, and without reforming one false step they have taken, there is little to hope that without reformation that ever the Almighty will re∣gard our fasting. It is a strange fancy that prevails in this nation, that our rulers always begin war without consulting God; and sustain themselves perfect judges of the lawfulness thereof; and when things go wrong through their own folly and wickedness, they cry to the Almighty to help them without correcting their mistakes or amending their errors. It is none of the professed ends of this fast,
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>according to what is signified in the proclamation, to ask the lord to instruct them whether they have erred or not, or whether they should retract what they have done, or what they intend to do; but to implore aid to assist them to go on. They do not want direction how to proceed, but strength to follow their own wisdom. This is really mocking of God. They want not God to teach them their folly, but that he would enable them to proceed in it. The <HI>wisdom,</HI> and <HI>justice,</HI> of the cause is settled already; it is a <HI>just</HI> and <HI>necessary</HI> was: there is nothing want∣ing but power and success. They are worse than the Greeks at the siege of Troy, for they consulted Apollo concerning the cause of their ill success, and reformed the error when they were told of it. They restored Chryeis, and made an atonement for their fault. But our managers want not to know the cause of their misfortunes, but have them removed without removing the cause. They know the cause perfectly, and it is prodigiously impious to ask as∣sistance of the lord to proceed in a cause in which they never acknowledged his wisdom by asking his advice.</P>
<P>They do not behave like Joshua when Israel was defeated before the men of <HI>Ai;</HI> he asked counsel of the lord, and found out the <HI>cursed thing</HI> that was the cause of their misfortune. Were the men concerned in carrying on this war as strictly examined as Israel, there is reason to fear that the same cursed thing would be found among them, that was found in Achan's tent. Two hundred shekels of silver, a wedge of gold, and a Babylonish garment, were matters to the perquisites that are disposed of in some offices.</P>
<P>But I must now put the promoters of this fast in mind of what they may easily know, that what they
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>intend to ask upon their day of humiliation, the Almighty neither will nor can grant them, nor to any people else upon the same principle. What is the intention of this fast? Is it not to crave divine assistance to execute modern statutes, which are either doubtful in their nature, or contrary to fun∣damental laws.—And with fire and sword against their brethren, who cannot perceive them in the same light that they do. This is instead of loosing the band of wickedness, wickedly seeking to tie them. If the promoters of this fast cannot prove these statutes upon the authority of which they carry on this war consistent with the moral attributes of God and the laws of the British empire, they cannot ex∣pect, till they loose them, that the Almighty will regard their prayers any otherwise than with indig∣nation and abhorrence.</P>
<P>According to the stile of revelation, all unjust and arbitrary decrees are bands of wickedness by whatsoever human authority they are imposed, be∣cause they are contrary to moral justice, and are op∣pressive to the people. And though they can never bind the consciences of men, and so have no moral influence, yet they are cords of oppression, that sit hard upon their bodies and their temporal interest. Laws that are unfriendly to the temporal interests, and general good of society; laws that are made to exalt a few to power and dignity, by spunging, squeezing, and oppressing all other ranks of people, though contrived by angels, and executed by saints, are bands of wickedness, which may suffer for trans∣gressing, but can never sin in disobeying.</P>
<P>When the rulers of a nation, to gratify their own lusts of pride and ambition, impose heavy and op∣pressive burdens upon the people by legislative au∣thority, they establish iniquity by a law, which in
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>the <HI>stristest</HI> sense of the words, is a band of iniquity. The lusts of princes and their servants, often create their own wants, and render them necessitous; they then make use of their power and influence to pro∣cure laws to oblige others to supply them, whether they are able or not; and what aggravates the evil, when the subjects know and feel that they are not able to answer the heavy demands of power, they are not allowed to be judges of their own abilities. Those that rule over others ought to be sober and temperate, and make the reasonable finances of state serve them in executing their offices. Unnecessary splendor and expence in government are inconsistent with both reason and religion, which teach us that it is one of the great ends of laws and government to restrain unruly appetites and irregular passions. It is sinful in princes to coin expensive offices to serve their favourites and oppress their subjects. No∣thing can be more audacious, than for men appointed to be guardians of society, with a design to make individuals easy and happy to pretend to come be∣fore the Lord in the most solemn manner to ask his aid and assistance to oppress them. Such is un∣doubtedly the language of the ensuing fast, and of the conduct of its authors and devisers.</P>
<P>The poor in all parts of Britain are groaning un∣der a heavy load of taxes, devised for new purposes, and imposed by new statutes. But for what reasons? Where is the necessity? What way are they applied? Are they not intended to carry violence and deso∣lation, fire and sword, among a people, whose only fault is that they are endowed with principles and a spirit which Englishmen once gloried in, and which saved this nation from popery and arbitrary power, and will not part with what God and nature, and the laws have given them, to gratify the lusts of
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>men who have degenerated from the noble generous temper of their ancestors, into eastern nabobs, and Turkish bashaws. These men have thought fit to con∣trive war foreign and domestic, to gratify their de∣praved passions, and the rich and poor throughout the nation must be oppressed to carry it on; bands of wick∣edness are twisted one year after another, and the nation groans in chains. All the necessaries of life are in some way or other taxed; our smoke cannot as∣cend to the sky, nor a ray of light peep in at our win∣dows without paying an heavy impost. The inside as well as the outside of our houses are assessed; and poor people who cannot, without great difficulty, afford to pay five pounds for a house to lodge in through the year, must now pay five sixpences more. And for what reason? To carry on a war that originated in injustice, has been carried on with folly, and attended with disgrace and disappoint∣ment.—To shed innocent blood, and carry death and desolation across the Atlantic to destroy our brethren, to satiate the voracious lusts of a few am∣bitious men, who would waste the globe, and ruin heaven itself, provided they had the management thereof. Ah, Britain! will the God of mercy, who delights in forgiving offences, hear your prayers or regard your fasting, when you are twisting cords of oppression, instead of loosing bands of wickedness. Ah, ye rulers of the land, whither are ye hastening? You cannot run long when you are rushing upon the bosses of Jehovah's buckler! <HI>When you fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wicked∣ness,</HI> do you imagine that the God of mercy will hear your prayers with acceptance, or regard your fasting any otherwise than setting them down to the sum total of your past iniquities?</P>
<P>Would Britain wish to have her prayers regarded, and her fasting accepted in the sight of the Almighty,
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>let her loose the bands of wickedness that she has twisted, and break the chains that she has forged for her brethren abroad, and the subjects at home. Let her repeal these novel and hostile laws made against her these colonies, and that have been made in conse∣quence thereof, which are so hard to be borne by the people in the mother-country. Let her withdraw her fleets and armies, and speak comfortably to her brethren, whom she has so much injured. Till this is done her fasts will want one essential charac∣teristic of a fast which the Lord hath chosen. In the form of prayer for fasting last year, the bishops ask the Lord for strength to resist the Americans. Their graces and lordships certainly knew, that there was no occasion for resistance on the part of Britain, with regard to the colonies. They had nothing to do but call home their forces, and none would trouble them. They meant to have said, <HI>Lord give us the good fortune to kill them:</HI> but it stuck in their throat, and they stammered out the word, <HI>resist,</HI> unawares. I wish there may not be spite in the case; for the colonists do not love bishops, and for that reason their reverences cannot forgive them.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is a positive requisite of a fast, which the Lord hath chosen to undo heavy burdens; to burst them asunder and remove them all together. It is not sufficient to lighten them a little; they must be totally removed, as far as they are oppressive. If they are not unjust and oppressive, they do not come under the description of heavy burdens; but if they are oppressive they must be wholly taken away. The <HI>Bishop of London,</HI> in his new translation of this prophecy, seems to have hesitated when he came to this verse. He renders the word which is in our version <HI>undo,</HI> by the word <HI>loosen,</HI> which greatly softens the sense. He was afraid to say <HI>burst asun∣der</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>or <HI>break in pieces,</HI> which is the true signifi∣cation of the Hebrew word, because this would have been too strong an expression; and would have implied, that when legislators make unjust and op∣pressive statutes, they must pass over all forms in repealing them, before they can observe a fast which the Lord hath chosen. The word <HI>loosen,</HI> has much the same import with the word <HI>slacken,</HI> and implies <HI>some</HI> ease or relief, but not perfect liberty from the burden. But in the words of the text <HI>loosen</HI> will not do; the burden must be annihilated and <HI>totally</HI> destroyed. The word undo in our translation is exceedingly proper, and is well understood by the common people: they make use of it to signify to∣tal ruin, and when they say any thing will <HI>undo</HI> them, they mean it will <HI>rain</HI> them. Therefore all heavy, oppressive burdens must be unmade and not merely loosened, before those who lay them on can observe an acceptable day to the Lord.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">What will explain this point clearly is the same use of the Hebrew word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Psal. ii. iii. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Let us break or BURST THEIR BANDS ASUNDER. The Pro∣phet Jeremiah would have set the bishop right in this point, and shewn him the true sense of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Jer. v. 5. I will get me up to the great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the Lord and the judgment of their God.—But these <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> have altogether broken the yoke, and BURST THE BONDS.</NOTE></P>
<P>The commandment in the words of the text is di∣rected to the rulers of Judah, who at this time were grievously oppressing the people; who to gratify, their own ambitious views and depraved inclinations, employed all their power and authority, to make the subjects contribute to their designs. This, in process of time, became very oppressive; for new projects were continually devised, which their pride
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>suggested, and the poor were made to pay for the expence of their execution, though they were di∣rectly contrary to their interest. This will always happen when power is in the hands of covetous, proud, and ambitious men, who consider all the in∣ferior ranks of mankind made for no other purpose, than to serve the ends of their pride, folly, and ambition. The poor in the days of Amos were sold for a pair of shoes: the rulers thought no crime to oppress them in the last degree; and there is but little difference between making men slaves, and taking away from them the means of living.</P>
<P>Government would never be expensive provided rulers were honest and virtuous; it does not require much to support the real dignity of government, but it requires much to gratify the lusts of princes and their servants. The voracious and ungovern∣able appetites of courties and placemen, come upon the subjects with heavy demands. These lay the greatest imposts upon the poor people. Virtuous rulers will not require much to themselves for doing their duty; they will consider virtue and integrity greater honours than robes of ermine, and splendid equipage. <HI>Camillus</HI> and <HI>Cincinatus</HI> would have go∣verned an empire a whole year at a smaller ex∣pence, than Nero bestowed upon a supper; and what would have served the whole senate in the days of the commonwealth, would not have been a mouthful to Nero. Fame is not to be trusted, if a great number of our present burdens do not proceed from the luxuries of the great, who after they have spent their fortunes upon their lusts, turn slaves to the court for <HI>places</HI> and <HI>pensions,</HI> which the honest poor are obliged to support. Such corrupted minions are ready on all occasions to vote perdition to a nation, provided they can have their lust ful∣filled and their passions gratified. These men instead
<PB N="49" REF="54"/>of undoing burdens, undo nations, and are them∣selves the greatest burden. Yet these godly child∣ren of dissipation, and voluptuousness have the daring assurance to call for a national fast, when all the year through, they are employed in wanton lasciviousness, gamboling, and wasting the public treasure. To support a swarm of these impure lo∣custs, the virtuous labourer, and honest tradesman must be burdened with taxes beyond all reasonable bounds. Say not, O ye sons of dissipation, and prodigality, that it is for the support of govern∣ment, that these burdens are laid on, for we know the contrary. Is it a dignity to government, or a real support to it, to maintain men in high offices of state, whose characters are a scandal to society, and a burlesque of all good rule and moral laws? Does it dignify and support government, to waste the substance of a nation, upon Paphian rites, and sensual pleasures, and in supporting a seraglio of fallen angels, together with a number of young sprigs of iniquity, educated in the same practices, and initiated in all the arts of seduction and impuri∣ty? Yet fame reports, that for such purposes is the treasure of the nation wasted, the public money squandered, and the poor more and more oppressed. Our <HI>diguified fasters</HI> must not expect that the lord will regard their fasting, until such time as they <HI>undo the heavy burdens,</HI> which the nation is groaning under. Till they do this, their fast is not such a fast as the Lord hath chosen.</P>
<P>It has a very strange aspect to see men who are continuing in absurd and preposterous measures, which even children would blush to be authors of, so impious as to sollicit heaven to assist them, when they may be sure, that this cannot be done provided God is <HI>just</HI> and <HI>holy.</HI> The Jewish rulers must have made a ridiculous figure in the esteem of the prophet, when they observed forms of fasting and humiliation,
<PB N="50" REF="55"/>in the very instant they were contriving grievous op∣pressions to others, and living in all sorts of volup∣tuousness themselves. It is exceeding farcical and absurd, to behold men who despise all religion both in their hearts and practice, among the first to in∣force an exercise which cannot be performed without the fear of the Lord. Would the devisers of the en∣suing fast really desire that God should regard it in mercy, they ought to change their form of prayer from what it was the last year, and reform their own conversations. Instead of praying for success to the present war, they ought to pray to God to forgive their wickedness in beginning it, and carrying it on: speedily give it over, withdraw their troops, take shame to themselves, and blush for their iniquity. With regard to their private deportment, they must mortify their pride, give over their luxury, dismiss their fallen angels, and live sober and chaste;—dignify government by their self denial and mortification, serve their country for the dividends of inheritance, which Providence has given them more than others; repeal the heavy tax laws that have been made of late years, that the poor may be able to live with more ease, and pray to God for their superiors.</P>
<P>Although persons in high life think little of the prayers of the poor, yet I will hint a secret to them, which perhaps they were not thinking of, and that is,—that in times like these in which we live, the prayers of the poor are the only prayers that the Al∣mighty regards. <Q>He will regard the prayer of “the destitute, and not despise their prayer; this shall be written for the generations to come—for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary, from heaven did the Lord behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those that are appointed unto death. For the oppression of the poor, and the sighs of the
<PB N="51" REF="56"/>needy, will I arise (saith the Lord) I will set him ”in safety from those that puff at him.</Q>—There are not such promises made in all the Scripture to the noble and the rich. Their graces and reverences have generally as little influence at the throne of mercy, as the poor in this world have at the thrones of temporal princes. Although many vain men in high life, despise the poor on account of their mean∣ness, and generally speak disrespectfully of them, yet many of the poor are incapable of doing such mean actions as some of their superiors in rank are capable of: they have in general a truer sense of conscience, and are better acquainted with God. Even the most vicious among the vulgar, are not equal in profligacy to those of the same character among the great. And the common people are not so ignorant, but they can easily perceive that those who rule over others, should themselves walk accord∣ing to moral laws. They consider government in the hands of the wicked, unworthy of that respect that is due to virtuous rulers; and they are fully persuaded that it can never answer the purposes of felicity to society, when it is made more subser∣vient to the passions of governors, than to the good of the public.</P>
<P>If the devisers of this fast only heard what the common people say concerning it, it would astonish them. They really make many shrewd remarks up∣on it. They in the first place observe, that the mi∣nistry are now grievously pinched when they betake themselves to the Lord for assistance. They say there must be losses that we have heard nothing of in the Gazette, otherwise we should have had no fast∣ing. When the two Brothers were successful, and Bur∣goyne was driving all before him, there was not a word of humiliation or of seeking the Lord. Ah! it is all over now when our ministry turn devout. When
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>the sailors begin to pray there is no hope of safety, the vessel is about sinking.—Had they intended to have had heaven on their side they ought to have begun with asking the will of God, and laid the foundation of their plan in justice; but now when they have mismanaged all, do they imagine that the Lord will regard them? There is yet justice in heaven.—What have our brethren done to deserve the treatment they have met with? We would do the same things ourselves, in the same circumstances; and must we ask God to give aid to measures which our own hearts condemn? That would be solly in the extreme.—We should not wonder if there were thunder and lightning all that day, or some ter∣rible earthquake: it is a most dreadful thing to mock God. It is marvellous that the bishops should have any hand in it. Alas! they mind nothing except honours and preferment, otherwise they would never have engaged in such awful and profane business. God has blessed us with great abundance for some years past; but it will be a miracle if there is not a famine in the land before it be long.—What al∣though we should all join against the French, what will it signify? when such base men are at the helm of affairs, we are sure of nothing: they would waste the world, and when we have assisted them to serve their own purposes, they will serve us as they intended to serve the Colonists. They shall neither have our prayers nor our wishes, except to wish them to be called to account for the evil they have done.—This is certainly not <HI>such a fast as the Lord hath chosen: to loose the bands of wickedness and undo heavy bur∣dens.</HI> Alas no! This is <HI>fasting for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness.</HI> Good Lord deliver us from it; it will ruin us all. Many such observations do the people make, concerning the ensunig Fast.—But I shall now conclude.</P>
