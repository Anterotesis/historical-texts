<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have nothing to say in behalf of the
following papers, but that they are
chiefly intended for the great body of Chri∣stians,
called <HI>the common people,</HI> who
have but little time, and as little money,
for buying and reading large books. The
character of such readers makes it like∣wise
necessary that this small performance
should be as plain and familiar as possible.</P>
<P>I mentioned some causes of the thought∣lessness
of mankind, which possibly may be
reckoned more applicable to those in high
stations. But the lowest ranks of men are
too much set upon their pleasures, and
are still projecting to raise themselves
higher. As for those in higher stations,
when they are arrived at the utmost their
ambition can desire, (such is the empti∣ness
of things), they are continually search∣ing
after new pleasures and amusements:</P>
<P>When the woful effects of the fall were
taken notice of (<HI>chap.</HI> 4.), the list might
have been made fuller, and more said con∣cerning
the corruption of the heart: but
perhaps there is enough said to make us
sensible of our fallen state, which pride
seems to have occasioned; as may be in∣ferred
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
from the present disgrace and mi∣sery
we are under; a frail body, full of
diseases, and other no less humbling things.
And what have we to boast of as to the
soul? A defective memory, a confused
judgment, a giddy imagination, a per∣verse
will, a crowd of passions, that give
us no rest, and make the earth desolate.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, we ought not
to forget the happy prospect which the
scripture gives us of a glorious and bless∣ed
state hereafter, wherein all imperfec∣tions
and sorrows are done away.</P>
<P>In chap. 11. the cross was brought in
a little abruptly; and perhaps too ha∣stily
dismissed. This is indeed true, that
the crosses and vexations which people
create to one another, are very much owing
to the mutual defects of their own tem∣pers.
But the cross implies all the varie∣ty
of suffering we can possibly imagine,
and it is the necessary medicine for curing
all the disorders which sin hath brought
upon us. It may be reckoned, that every
cross laid on us by the unsearchable provi∣dence
of God, is fitted to some disorder in
our nature, frequently unknown to us:
and we may conclude in general, that
since our blessed Saviour (who was pu∣rity
itself) made choice of the cross, and
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
sufferings, we (who are polluted with
sin) can have no other way of arriving
at happiness. Holy writ confirms it often.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to have discovered
all the faults of the book. In chap. 17.
chearfulness is called a virtue; which
perhaps will be disputed: for though a
certain sort of chearfulness may be said
to be the effect of the highest virtue, (joy
and peace being fruits of the Holy Spirit,
and a good conscience a continual feast);
yet ordinary and natural chearfulness is
no more to be called a virtue, than bold∣ness,
timorousness, bashfulness, or even
sadness, when they proceed merely from
the natural temper. I grant, the chear∣fulness
which proceeds merely from the
natural temper is not to be called a vir∣tue;
but the chearfulness I had in view,
was a certain mixture of gaiety and com∣plaisance,
in opposition to moroseness and
sullenness, which can never do honour to
religion.</P>
<P>Much more might have been added, if
the design had not been to make a very
small book: and what is chiefly intended
by it is, to stir up people to the study of
the holy scriptures, in which all is con∣tained
that we ought to believe and prac∣tise.
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
There are many pious books<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such as <HI>the Imitation of Christ,</HI> and several books of that spiritual kind, proper for all ranks and conditions.</NOTE>,
which, though inferior to the scriptures,
are to be highly esteemed, as well as se∣veral
books of an inferior class: the
reader may rank them as he thinks pro∣per.
And when we have no book in our
hands, we have the excellency of the
Christian religion to think of, the purity
and peaceableness of its doctrine, with
the comfortable hopes it gives its sin∣cere
followers. The thoughts of death,
judgment, and eternity, will sometimes
enter into the mind, notwithstanding all
the pains that we are at to banish them
from it; and at such times, what can
support us but the doctrine of the gospel?
To say nothing of the terrors of death, we
had need to have recourse to religion to
support us in the common difficulties of
life.</P>

MAN'S Duties and Hopes.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The advantage of thinking seriously on
our condition.</HEAD>
<P>“MAN that is born of a wo∣man,
is of few days, and
full of trouble. He co∣meth
forth like a flower, and
is cut down: he fleeth also as a
shadow, and continueth not<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xiv. 1. 2.</NOTE>.”
“Verily every man at his best state
is altogether vanity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxix. 5.</NOTE>.” Our own
experience teaches us the same truths;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut as we know them only in a con∣fused
manner, so we think very little
about them. Our short time passes
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
away in folly, till we are surprised
by death. Several causes may be gi∣ven
for this thoughtlessness. Our
heart is almost continually inten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon some pleasure or diversion, and
our head taken up with airy projects<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
or if we find ourselves sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
little disengaged, and in a dispositio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to think of our true state, and the
great end of our creation, we are pre∣sently
discouraged with gloomy pro∣spects,
and the misery that casts up
to us.</P>
<P>No doubt we are poor and miser∣able:
but this should not hinder u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from considering the whole of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
condition, since we pretend to be rea∣sonable
creatures, and often to be ve∣ry
wise.</P>
<P>A little consideration might shew
us, that we are not miserable beyon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
hope of recovery: very few are alto∣gether
without some expectation o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
happiness in the next world, afte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this <HI>painful life</HI> is ended; and if w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
give attention to the scripture, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
shall find many passages to confir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
our hopes. The same holy person
Job says, “I know that my Redeemer
liveth, and that he shall stand at
the latter day upon the earth.” He
adds, “And though, after my skin,
worms destroy this body, yet in
my flesh shall I see God: whom I
shall see for myself, and mine eyes
shall behold, and not another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xix. 25. 26. 27.</NOTE>.”
Here is a glorious expectation of de∣liverance,
and of the resurrection.
Our blessed Saviour and his apostles
give that doctrine still a greater force.</P>
<P>Mankind therefore should not be
without hopes, but their confidence
should be only in their Redeemer.
For, alas! what miserable creatures are
we!</P>
<P>We cannot think too meanly of
ourselves, as we are fallen creatures,
and so wretchedly disfigured by sin.
But lest the dwelling too much upon
this thought should cast us into de∣spair,
we must think of the mercy
and power of God, who can renew
us body and soul. He can “create
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
in us a clean heart.” and “change
our vile body, that it may be fa∣shioned
like unto his glorious bo∣dy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 21.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>We were created at first “after
the image of God.” Who could
believe this, considering what we are
now? But the scripture declares it,
and that is enough. We even find in
our present state something that looks
like great about us. We abhor to be
thought capable of base actions. We
aim at a good character before men.
Again, nothing in this world can ful∣ly
satisfy our hearts, which looks as
if they were made for the enjoyment
of God, since nothing less than he
can fill them. And the abhorrence
of being thought base, looks like some
remains of dignity in our nature.
When a person has no sense of
shame, there is nothing that is good
to be expected from him.</P>
<P>But as we are <HI>high</HI> in some respects,
we are very <HI>low</HI> in others. These are
two points which we must constantly
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
keep in view, that we may not either
be proud like the devil, or level our∣selves
with the beasts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The true knowledge of ourselves, and
the state of things, only to be had
from the scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>EXperience may teach us somewhat,
but the scriptures only can teach
us fully and truly. We must read at∣tentively,
otherwise it does not de∣serve
the name of reading. Another
thing requisite for understanding the
scriptures is <HI>an honest heart:</HI> We must
bring with us a sincere intention of
doing our duty, as soon as we under∣stand
it; without which we only cheat
ourselves.</P>
<P>We must not read that we may flat∣ter
our vanity, or to appear know∣ing.
The end of our reading, and
of all our actions, must be to please
God, and to give glory to his name.</P>
<P>If we read the holy scriptures with
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
these good dispositions, or a right frame
of heart, we shall learn out of them all
that is necessary to make us perfectly
happy in the next world, and even
much happier here than otherwise we
could be: For the scriptures have
come from the Spirit of God, the
fountain of all wisdom. There may
be very useful books written by good
men, but they are only borrowed
lights, and dim in comparison of the
scriptures.</P>
<P>When we open those sacred books,
we should put up a private petition to
Almighty God, “That he would
give us the true understanding of
what we read,” lest we read like
children. We must also pray, “That
God would give us a ready heart
to obey his will in all that he plea∣ses
to discover of it to us,” lest we
read like hypocrites.</P>
<P>We cannot deny that our duty is
laid down plainly to us in the scrip∣tures:
common sense is enough to
let us see it. But we are for the most
part in such a hurry when we read, or
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
hear others, that all goes for nothing.
Instead of minding what we read or
hear, our thoughts are carried away
with a thousand impertinent things.
And suppose our attention were great∣er
than it is, yet our foolish desires
and passions blind us; and “the
cares of the world choke the good
seed,” as our blessed Saviour in∣forms
us.</P>
<P>But I say again, our duty is plain.
Our Saviour condescended to speak
to the meanest capacities, and made
use of the most familiar parables.
His apostles teach us our duty also:
and we find it in the Old Testament
itself. God is never wanting upon
his part.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we cannot de∣ny
that there are several things in the
scriptures very dark, according to our
natural apprehension, and which can
only be made intelligible by the same
Spirit from whence they came. But
to this Spirti no bounds can be set: it
can teach the soul immediately; it
can explain dark passages; it can
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
make a light to spring up in the soul,
without letters or sounds, or any
thing that can strike the outward sen∣ses.
He who formed the soul can in∣struct
it after many ways and man∣ners
that human reason can have no
comprehension of.</P>
<P>All we have to do is, to follow the
light that is given us; and when God
sees us fit for higher things, he will
not be wanting. We ought not to
aim at what is extraordinary. David
said, “He did not exercise himself in
things too high for him, but be∣haved
like a weaned child<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxxxi. 1. 2.</NOTE>.” Such
high aims are liable to the punish∣ment
of delusion, which they well de∣serve.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of some principal truths taught us in
holy writ.</HEAD>
<P>THE scriptures teach us our du∣ty,
plainly, fully, and truly. These
three qualities cannot but concur in
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
them, since they are the inspirations
of God. They also teach us many
things concerning the divine nature
and our own, the end we are made
for, and the course we must follow in
order to eternal happiness.</P>
<P>We feel the inconstancy and disor∣der
of every thing here. Our body is
a mass of corruption, and liable every
moment to pain and torture in every
pore and atom of it, and the whole
fabric ready to fall to pieces, like a
ruinous house. Our soul, though
of an immortal nature, is however in
a very poor state here: passions, ima∣ginations,
delusions, cares, sorrows,
these are commonly the troublesome
guests of the soul. We have not
names for all the evils we feel and
fear. All the elements are against us:
the air we breathe often carries death
in it; men are our open enemies;
and “the devil walketh about, like a
roaring lion, seeking whom he may
devour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 8.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>There are other things in our pre∣sent
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
state more agreeable; pleasures
of the body and mind. Hardly is a∣ny
person so destitute as to have no
friend; and one single friend is a
great treasure.</P>
<P>But still man's life is full of trouble,
and he is full of contradictions him∣self;
some good qualities in him, and
many bad.</P>
<P>It is the scripture that shews us how
these contrary things have come to
pass. In informs us, that the first
man <HI>Adam</HI> was created in an upright
and happy state; but that he fell, and
all his posterity in him, since he could
produce none in his corruption but
corrupt creatures like himself.</P>
<P>It informs us, that God was pleased
to pardon <HI>Adam</HI> and his posterity, at
the intercession of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who
took our nature upon him, (except
the sinful part of it), and satisfied the
divine justice by his bitter death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Man's redemption by Iesus Christ is fre∣quently mentioned in scripture, and is one of the mysteries unfathomable by human reason.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It informs us, that though man was
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
thus pardoned, yet he was driven out
of Paradise, and the earth <HI>cursed</HI> for
his sake; that being condemned to
hard labour, and many vexations, he
might be in less hazard of doting on
his present jail, and might have his
eye fixed on a better world.</P>
<P>It informs us, that man's know∣ledge
was much darkened by the fall,
and all his faculties distempered and
poisoned; that he is now a proud,
angry, foolish creature; timorous,
slothful, restless; every thing by turns,
and nothing for any continuance.</P>
<P>It informs us, on the other hand,
that there are great remains of dignity
in our nature; that, notwithstanding
all our defects and miseries, we are
still the children of God, and “joint
heirs with Christ.” What amazing
and endearing expressions!</P>
<P>It informs us, that our title to these
glorious and blessed promises is of the
pure mercy of God, and only owing
to the merits of his well-beloved Son;
that we must take nothing to our∣selves
but <HI>shame and confusion,</HI> nor
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
flatter ourselves with the hopes of be∣ing
acceptable to God without faith
and repentance, and the imitation of
all the virtues of our Lord and Sa∣viour,
as far as is possible for us.</P>
<P>These are some of the principal
truths which the holy scriptures teach
us, and what we could never have
discovered without revelation. It helps
to reconcile the contradictions we find
in our own nature. Man is neither
beast, nor devil, and far less a God;
but he has something in him of all the
three: experience shews it in his
actions. Things are done by man
which look more diabolical than hu∣man;
and there are things brutal to
the last degree; but there are other
things (it is a pity they are so few)
which look very like divine.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The unhappy effects of the fall consider∣ed
a little farther.</HEAD>
<P>BY the fall of our first parents the
divine image is very much disfi∣gured
in us, and we are sunk in wic∣kedness
and folly. It is necessary to
keep our folly in mind, for we are
often proud of our being wicked;
but the remembrance of our being
foolish would help to keep us humble.</P>
<P>We see what men are in the pre∣sent
age. If we look backwards,
and believe the report of those who
have lived before us, we shall find
matters very little better. All histo∣ries
are full of the corruptions of men,
and their violence against one ano∣ther;
and the sacred history informs
us, that when there were but two
brothers upon the earth, the one
killed the other; and that wicked∣ness,
in the course of a few genera∣tions,
came to that height, that all
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
mankind were destroyed by the flood,
except one single family, which was
saved in the ark, with so many crea∣tures
as <HI>Noah</HI> was ordered to take in∣to
it, to preserve their kinds. Every
body talks of the flood of <HI>Noah;</HI> it
were well worth the while to think
seriously of that dreadful event, and
the cause that brought it about; I
mean the abominations of fallen men.</P>
<P>Men still go on in the old way, so
deep is the corruption of our nature.
“The works of the flesh are mani∣fest,”
says St Paul, “adultery,
fornication, uncleanness, lascivious∣ness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred,
variance, emulations, wrath, strife,
seditions, heresies, envyings, mur∣ders,
drunkenness, revellings, and
such like.” He adds, “That they
who do such things, shall not in∣herit
the kingdom of God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 19. 20. 21.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Thus the holy apostle hath given
us a sad list of our disorders and
crimes, (the miserable effects of the
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
fall), and he could have named more,
if he had thought it needful.</P>
<P>St <HI>John</HI> reduceth all the disorders
that are in the world, to “the lust
of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
and the pride of life.” But the
flesh is often used to signify our
whole corrupt nature, and the mo∣tions
of it in general, in opposition to
the Spirit of God, or whatever re∣mains
of it in us. Flesh is opposed
to spirit, as nature is opposed to grace.</P>
<P>These unhappy consequences of the
fall are the evils that have seized up∣on
the soul of man; and sometimes
they are called <HI>moral evils;</HI> as other
evils that have seized both soul and
body, are only called <HI>natural evils,</HI> and
there is no sin in them.</P>
<P>The natural evils of the soul are
darkness and confusion of the under∣standing,
and irregular passions of
the heart: for passions are not vices,
unless they are viciously directed.
But at least our passions and igno∣rance
give us a great deal of trouble;
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
the very defects of our memory are a
vexation to us, and create us much
labour. By the natural evils of the
soul, I understand no more than the
defects presently mentioned: nothing
is sin but what proceeds from a per∣verse
and deliberate will, commonly
called <HI>a bad heart.</HI></P>
<P>The natural evils of the body are
sickness, pain, weariness, and whate∣ver
people use to complain of; for
they seldom complain of the infirmi∣ties
of their mind.</P>
<P>Then we have the evil of things
without us to think of; the disorders
of the air, fire, and water, which
make our habitation of earth often
very comfortless. Without being at
sea, we are frighted in our houses
with storms of wind, thunder and
lightning; earthquakes (though sel∣dom
felt in this island) are still more
dreadful; every thing is in a violent
state, and opposite to man as a guilty
creature.</P>
<P>The curse of the earth certainly
implles more than we imagine; and
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
without some heinous offence, such a
punishment would not have been in∣flicted;
for God put man at first in∣to
a paradise of delights, and “saw
that every thing he had made was
very good.”</P>
<P>There is a mixture of good still:
but the present state is nevertheless a
state of trouble and distress for the
greatest part; and the sons of <HI>Adam</HI>
are not to expect their paradise here.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Vexation and suffering the lot of all
men.</HEAD>
<P>THis is a plain case, much felt
by every body, and often men∣tioned
in holy writ. But we see, and
feel, and forget.</P>
<P>“All is vanity and vexation of spi∣rit.”
This we are told by <HI>Solomon,</HI>
the wisest of men, and the most for∣tunate
as to every thing this world
could afford. Let his history be read
with attention. He seems to have
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
been raised up by Providence to shew
all men that come after him the emp∣tiness
and disquiet of the present
world; for who can make so much
of it as he did? and yet we see what
he says of it.</P>
<P>But mens heads are turned. This
world, rotten as it is, deludes us;
and almost every body fancies he shall
do better than <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>The lowest ranks are still aiming to
be higher; still climbing, and dash∣ing
themselves to pieces. If some few
get into a better fortune than they
were born to, what trouble and sor∣row
have they with it? It would be
much wiser (as St <HI>Paul</HI> advises) “to
be content with food and raiment.”
Most servants are easier than their
masters. I confess it is not only be∣cause
men think they would be easier
in a higher condition, that they seek
to raise themselves; it is their pride
also which makes them climb and
thrust forward.</P>
<P>But as suffering is the lot of all
men, the highest (generally speaking)
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
suffer most: their station exposes
them to envy, their pride grows still
more impatient of contradiction, and
they have great difficulty in keeping
measures with people as proud as
themselves. Then, as to the natural
evils of sickness and death, the high∣est
ranks are no less exposed than the
lowest; they are rather more, and
often destroy themselves by their in∣temperance.</P>
<P>Temptation, danger, and pain, are
every where: men are very much a∣like
by nature; death makes them
perfectly equal.</P>
<P>We carry within us the principles
of seeds of our vexation and suffer∣ing:
outward things could not affect
us as they do, if it were not for that
inward corruption. How long shall
we continue in our dreams? “O
ye sons of men,” says <HI>David,</HI>
how long will ye love vanity,
and seek after leasing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. iv. 2.</NOTE>?” The
things of the world are but lies, and

<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
pleasures of sin for a season<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 25.</NOTE>,”
which <HI>Moses</HI> wisely despised; for they
are but lies, because of their short con∣tinuance,
and the sorrows to which
they expose us afterwards.</P>
<P>All are born to suffer. It is the
present establishment of things, and
none can alter it. “Great travel is
created for every man, and an
heavy yoke is upon the sons of A∣dam,—from
him that sitteth on a
throne of glory, unto him that is
humbled in earth and ashes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ecclus xl. 1. 3.</NOTE>.”
We may be well persuaded that <HI>Solo∣mon</HI>
himself has been sick and weary.
His outward splendor was a figure of
the glorious state which things shall
one day be in: but as he was <HI>born of

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Death.</HEAD>
<P>ONE grievous effect of the fall was
death: for God only threatened
it upon man's disobedience. “It is
appointed for all men once to die,
and after that the judgment.” This
is a sentence we cannot think of with∣out
horror. Nature shrinks at its
dissolution. Every creature that hath
life, endeavours to preserve it. To
say nothing of future apprehensions,
nature hath implanted in us a dread
of losing our present existence.</P>
<P>But with rational creatures there
would be less fear of death, if it were
not for the <HI>judgment</HI> that comes after
it. Men would fear death, and shun
danger, as other living creatures do;
but if they thought of what is to fol∣low,
they would be in great perplexity;
and nothing could support them but
the consideration of the goodness of
God.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="29"/>
But alas! we think very little about
death. We are stupid and drunk
with the low pleasures of this world;
and when we begin to think of
that fatal period, we soon give it
over, the prospect is so dark and dis∣mal.</P>
<P>It is not always because we are sor∣ry
to part with the joys of life, that
the thoughts of death overwhelm us.
We find persons whose life may be
reckoned a burden to them, and yet
they would gladly lengthen it if they
could; which is a strong presumption
that they have some fear of entering
into another state, and undergoing
the judgment of God.</P>
<P>If that were not the case, if there
were not a secret impression of a fu∣ture
state, simple death could not be
so terrible a prospect to a reasonable
creature; it would be but like a deep
sleep, and a real relief from many trou∣bles.
No more oppression, no more
calumny, no more toil, no more pain,
no more grief. “There the wicked
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
cease from troubling, and there
the weary are at rest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job iii. 17.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>But naturally some horror must <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>be
elt at the thoughts of our leaving
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he body: for the soul knows not
whither it is going, and “it is a fear∣ful
thing to fall into the hands of
the living God.”</P>
<P>Let us not however be so afraid of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eath, as if we had no hope in God.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Saviour hath “overcome the
sharpness of death, and opened the
kingdom of heaven to all belie∣vers;”
that is, to all who truly be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eve
his doctrine, and faithfully imi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate
his example. Belief alone is not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fficient, for “the devils believe and
tremble.”</P>
<P>Let us think of death, as what it is,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wit, a release from a painful life,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the end of a tedious journey. At
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e same time, we must look upon it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the punishment of guilt in our first
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arents, and a just condemnation of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur own pride. It is very just that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur high heads should be laid low,
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
and that the worms should feed on
our bodies, which many of us have
treated with so much expence and
care.</P>
<P>Let us, on the other hand, think
of death, as an entrance into a state
of happiness, or into a <HI>hoúse</HI> which
our blessed Saviour hath prepared for
those that love him. This prospect
would fill us with joy, when we con∣sider,
that “our light affliction, which
is but for a moment, worketh for
us a far more exeeeding and eter∣nal
weight of glory.”</P>
<P>But our composition is very strange!
neither the thoughts of heaven nor
hell affect us; we live as if we were
never to die; the present perishing
things only touch us; we talk of
hopes and fears in the next world,
but our affections are only set upon
this earth; any little good we do is
chiefly “to be seen of men;” and if
we abstain from any evil, it is chiefly
for fear of their reproach. Yet those
very men we are thus afraid of, must
die like ourselves; and we see our
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
friends and acquaintance dropping e∣very
day: but for all this we never
change our conduct; we live as if we
were immortal, and our names ne∣ver
to be forgotten!</P>
<P>How would the thoughts of death
put a stop to our extravagant and silly
pursuits! how would it check our
unlawful pleasures, and make us mo∣derate
in those that are lawful!</P>
<P>We are but like shadows or appa∣ritions
upon this earth, and must soon
give place to others, perhaps as vain
and foolish as ourselves. Who is it
that reflects seriously on these things?
“Lord help us so to live, that we
may not be too much afraid to
die.”</P>
<P>How dreadful will it be at death to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook back upon a life spent in drink∣ing,
swearing, lewdness, covetousness,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fraud, oppression, or in any of the
works of the flesh! not only to think
upon the evil we have done, but the
good that we have omitted! If some
particular persons seem to die without
any appearance of remorse or fear,
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
we are not sure but they feel more
than they acknowledge, and that
they may take pains to conceal what
they feel. If there be no remorse at
all, it must either be from stupidity,
or a hardness of heart, contracted by
stifling the repeated checks of con∣science.
For, generally speaking,
conscience does stir; and it is very na∣tural
to fear that fatal period, which
not only separates us from all that is
dear to us in this world, but which is
like casting us from a precipice into a
gulf without bottom.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The goodness and wisdom of God in the
present establishment of things.</HEAD>
<P>MAN's first state was a state of in∣nocence;
the present is a state
of guilt. We need not wonder then
to find many things uneasy to us,
since we are criminals, (being the po∣sterity
of <HI>Adam</HI>), and sent here for a
short time of trial. We are not abso∣lutely
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
condemned, but conditionally:
that is, if we do wickedly, we shall
die; and if we righteously, we shall
live. St <HI>Paul</HI> confirms it: “If ye
live after the flesh, ye shall die; but
if ye through the Spirit do mortify
the deeds of the body, ye shall
live<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 13.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Now since the heart of man is cor∣rupted
by sin, and his understanding
so darkened, that his thoughts are set
upon the present world; it is happy
for him that he is not now in a para∣dise,
and that this world must disap∣point
and vex him; otherwise (as is
observed already) he would have been
more allured than he is.</P>
<P>The earth was therefore deprived
of its primitive fruitfulness and beau∣ty,
that man might set his heart less
upon it; his body was made weak,
that he might feel the uneasiness of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oil; and his labour must be attend∣ed
with uncertainty, to lessen his co∣vetousness,
and to teach him to de∣pend
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
upon God only for his necessa∣ry
subsistence.</P>
<P>The earth was fitted to the state of
man's frail body, and his body fitted
to the disorders of his soul; all fitted
well together. To have put a per∣verse
mischievous soul into a body
that could not be wearied, would
have produced terrible effects. The
necessities of refreshment and rest give
some little peace to mankind. Nor is
our weakness a greater restraint upon
our mischievousness and tyranny, than
upon our debauchery and intempe∣rance.</P>
<P>The wisdom and goodness of God
is exceeding remarkable in mixing
and tempering all things so well.
Man's violence is restrained by his
weakness; his life has been shortened
once and again; and it is very probable
the earth is less pleasant and fertile
since the flood.</P>
<P>But still a thousand delights and
beauties remain. <HI>The light is sweet▪</HI>
the sun is glorious; and the moon
and stars have their particular beau∣ties.
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
Then there are the numberless
beauties of the field, the corn, the
grass, the trees, flowers, herbs, foun∣tains,
rivers, the sea, every thing so
agreeable and so useful, that we would
almost think ourselves in paradise still.</P>
<P>All our senses, as well as our eyes,
are delightfully entertained; the ear
with music, and so of all the rest.
And how many pleasures are there of
the understanding and the heart! It
is pleasure to acquire knowledge, and
more pleasure to acquire friendship.</P>
<P>But our eyes must soon be closed
as to all created objects, and sickness
makes us lose the relish of them in
the mean time: nothing is durable
and fixed. But all this uncertainty is
good with respect to a higher end.
We are made for a better world, and
it is good for us to get warnings that
we must leave the present.</P>
<P>Death itself is good, as being a
state of rest to those “that die in the
Lord;” a state at least (as is gene∣rally
believed) where temptation is at
an end. It is sometimes good with
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
respect to those that survive, for it rids
the earth of monsters: but this is the
most melancholy consideration of all,
that such monsters should be.</P>
<P>Let us think of the goodness and
wisdom of God, in ordering the dif∣ferent
periods or stages of life. How
fit is it that man is born helpless, to
create compassion and care! the di∣stress
of the mother raises pity, as
well as the condition of the crying in∣fant.
How proper is childhood for
taming and instructing the sierce and
ignorant spirit! Youth has its disci∣pline
too. Riper years have their se∣veral
crosses laid upon them; and
poor old age is made up of wearinest
and sorrow, in order to make us leave
the world with the better will.</P>
<P>The changes of the seasons are of
benefit, and some pleasure. We love
variety; and those changes help to
make us depend a little more on Pro∣vidence,
and also to keep us in mind
that nothing is lasting here: the
spring draws on the summer, the
summer the harvest, the harvest the
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
winter, and the winter the spring;
and they are necessary as well as beau∣tiful
in their time.</P>
<P>Nor should we forget the goodness
and wisdom of God in appointing
work and labour for man since the
fall: it not only restrains him from
doing mischief, but refreshes his spi∣rits,
when it is not excessive. None
are so dull and heavy as those that
are idle: we see what difficulty they
have to pass the time, and the filly di∣versions
they fall upon to keep up
their spirits. The lower ranks of
mankind are happy in that point, if
they knew it. We may plainly see
the hand of God in the contrivance
of labour; for he might easily have
made the earth not only produce
without any pains or toil, but he
might also have made us less subject
to other necessities. This body gives
much work to feed it, and clothe it,
and keep it clean. But his wisdom
extends to every thing; the good of
particular persons is provided for, as
well as the quiet of society.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="39"/>
But there are yet higher things to
consider. Man was made to love
God. If there had been more per∣fection
in created things, he would
have forgot his chief end entirely.
Our own imperfections should make
us think ourselves less lovely than
commonly we do, and consequently
beat down our pride: and the imper∣fections
of others seem designed to
make us dote less upon them, and to
raise our love to the fountain of all
beauty and perfection, though we
cannot see it. Our friends cannot
help us in the greatest distress, but
“God is mighty to save.” Our
friends even make us suffer by their
defects, and we make them suffer by
ours. Among the best friends there
is reserve and closeness, but we may
lay ourselves open to God, as hoping
that he will help us without <HI>upbraid∣ing
us.</HI></P>
<P>I say, the defects of all created
things are of use to make us look up
to the all-perfect creator. Our de∣caying
bodies, which we pamper and
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
adorn, are soon to be the food of
worms. But this may make us think
of a more durable and finer state in
another world. And we should often
cast our eye to the great promises in
the scriptures, both that we be not
cheated with the empty pleasures here,
nor cast down when we think of the
numberless pains and sorrows that ne∣cessarily
fall to our lot.</P>
<P>Infinite goodness draws good out
of every thing. Our very passions
and follies are sometimes of use to
make us somewhat more regular than
otherwise we would be; mutual fear
makes us careful not to stir up one
another's anger, and to prevent bo∣dily
harm; and the fear of censure
and ill tongues is a considerable de∣fence
of our weak virtue. We would
more frequently do ill, if we were not
afraid that ill would be said of us. I
grant this is not true virtue, nor can
any thing be acceptable to God when
it is only done upon worldly motives,
and selfish considerations: however,
it is so far good for us not to be
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
wholly abandoned, or without shame▪
for we may chance to reflect after∣wards,
and find out the beauty of vir∣tue
and religion, which we could ne∣ver
do in a profligate course of life.</P>
<P>It is indeed very remarkable, that
disappointments, trouble, fear, folly,
every thing, should produce such
happy effects! but it is most worthy
of infinite wisdom and goodness, that
our own faults should mend us, by
making us humble; and that faults
and imperfections in general should
raise our hearts above this present
world.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD TYPE="sub">God's goodness to his creatures at all

<P>ALL creatures feel the divine care
and goodness; “He opens his
hand, and they are filled with
good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. civ. 28.</NOTE>.” That whole psalm is extra∣ordinary
moving.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="42"/>
Mankind may be said to be God's
peculiar care: they are formed “af∣ter
his image;” and “his delights
are to be with the children of men.”
So the scripture assures us.</P>
<P>In the state of innocence no plea∣sure
was denied; nothing was for∣bidden
but the fruit of one tree;
and “perhaps before it was forbid∣den,
mankind began to be too a∣spiring.”
We are likely to remain
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n darkness concerning those hidden
things, and must stick to the plain
history, that “our first parents fell.”
Their fault was the less heinous, that
they were tempted by the devil, whose
arrogance had made him fall before;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e said “he would be like the Most
High<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. xiv. 14.</NOTE>.” This pride and folly of
our enemy is inconceivable; but St
<HI>Jude</HI> tells us of angels “who kept not
their first estate,” and their arro∣gance
must have thrust them down.
It cannot be otherwise (we may well
think) in the nature of things.</P>
<P>Certainly man has very little reason
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
to be proud; and yet sometimes he is
said to be as proud as <HI>Lucifer!</HI></P>
<P>But to humble this pride of man,
it pleased God to subject him to all
the miseries of body and soul, which
we have hitherto mentioned, and can
never be enough sensible of. After
our Saviour's atonement for us, if we
were free of pride and other vices,
(though pride is the most criminal),
our recovery would come of course.</P>
<P>I shall not say there is any man
that equals himself with God; but
still it is arrogance if he does not give
God the glory of any gifts he has re∣ceived
from him; and it is great folly
to think he has received more than
he hath, which is very often our case</P>
<P>But the goodness of God follows
us at all times: he gives us good
things to enjoy, and mixes bitter
things with them, that we may not
be intoxicated or drunk with plea∣sure;
and to raise us our of our le∣thargy,
he sometimes inflicts the se∣verest
chastisements.</P>
<P>God hath moreover given to man∣kind,
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
at several times, express mani∣festations
of his will, to the end they
might mend their lives, and escape his
wrath. Thus he warned the old
world by <HI>Noah,</HI> and thus he declared
himself to <HI>Abraham</HI> against <HI>Sodom</HI> and
<HI>Gomorrah,</HI> and in like manner to <HI>Jo∣nas</HI>
against <HI>Nineveh;</HI> with many other
instances.</P>
<P>But, which is more remarkable,
when the light of nature was almost
extinguished, and the most abomi∣nable
things done by men, God was
pleased to give express laws in writing
to a whole nation; by whose example
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he rest of the world might be reform∣ed;
especially when they considered
how much God had done, and what
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onders he had wrought for that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople. Let us think of the plagues
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the passage through the
<HI>Red sea,</HI> the journeying in the wilder∣ness,
the <HI>manna,</HI> or food from hea∣ven,
the water out of the rock, the
entry into the promised land, and mi∣raculous
victories over the inhabi∣tants;
let us consider these things, and
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
particularly the giving of the law with
thunder and lightning, and the sha∣king
of the mount, and we shall find
the greatest manifestations of the di∣vine
power that we can imagine.</P>
<P>Let us also consider all the chastise∣ments
of that people, upon their fre∣quent
falling into idolatry and wicked∣ness,
their deliverances from their ene∣mies,
new crimes, and new slavery, ma∣ny
things foretold by the prophets, and
the exact fulfilling of them; is not all
this enough to convince us of the great
stupidity and perverseness of human
nature, and of God's infinite mercy
and long-suffering?</P>
<P>But nothing comes up to our Sa∣viour's
taking our nature upon him,
and doing and suffering for us what
he did. He came in the <HI>fulness of
time,</HI> the time that was fixed for his
coming, and marked by the prophet
<HI>Daniel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. ix. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The law of <HI>Moses</HI> was not able to
make “the observers of it perfect<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 1.</NOTE>,”
as the apostle tells the <HI>Hebrews</HI> very
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
plainly. It was good for the purposes
that God designed it, and no more
was required but the faithful obser∣vance
of it while it stood. And many
pious and wonderful men were Jound
among the <HI>Iews</HI> before our Saviour
came into the world; yea, before the
law of <HI>Moses</HI> holy persons were found,
as <HI>Abraham,</HI> and others descended of
him; and holy men are found even
before the flood, for instance <HI>Enoch,</HI>
who walked with God, and <HI>Noah</HI>
himself; which shews that in all pe∣riods
of the world there have been
righteous persons, and consequently
accepted of God.</P>
<P>But as wickedness increased, new
methods were fallen upon by the wis∣dom
of God, who gave <HI>precept upon

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some precepts and truths in the Chri∣stian
religion.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Saviour hath taught us truths
which we could not have known
without his light, and duties which
we cannot perform without his assist∣ance;
but he has promised his assist∣ance
to all who sincerely ask it. The
first duty that may occur to us is
prayer, on account of our wants and
our dangers. The heart may be said
to have a way of speaking to God
without words, “with groans that can∣not
be uttered:” but when words are
to be used, what can be so fit as those
our Saviour himself condescended to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each? The mind indeed must be in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> right disposition, otherwise all words
and desires are in vain. “Ye ask, and
have not,” says the apostle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James iv. 3.</NOTE>, “be∣cause
ye ask amiss.” For which reason
I mention the asking sincerely, that is▪
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
with a design of pleasing God, as well
as for any benefit to ourselves; or ra∣ther,
we should seek to please God
in the first place: this we should have
at heart, when we say, “Thy king∣dom
come: Thy will be done,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>That prayer commonly called the
<HI>Lord's prayer,</HI> ought to be well con∣sidered:
it shews us our greatness, in
having God for our father; it shews
us our wants, when we pray for <HI>our
daily bread;</HI> and our dangers, when
we pray to be <HI>delivered from evil:</HI> it
shews us the measure of forgiving o∣thers,
namely, as we would wish to
be <HI>forgiven</HI> ourselves: it shews us (if
I may speak so) how we ought to en∣ter
into the interests of God, when
we pray that <HI>his kingdom may come;</HI>
and how perfectly our own will ought
to be resigned, when we pray that <HI>his
will may be done.</HI> I shall leave all the
words of that most divine and perfect
form of prayer to be considered in
their proper order.</P>
<P>If we would give attention, we
should see in how small compass our
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
chief duties lie, with many truths of
the greatest consequence.</P>
<P>Praise and thanksgiving are also
found in that same complete form of
prayer, and they are duties we are
highly obliged to perform: <HI>Be thank∣ful
unto him, and speak good of his
name.</HI> Praise is a chearful thing; the
mind could have no entertainment so
pleasant: prayer is a relief to the mind
in trouble; praise is a delight to it in
prosperity.</P>
<P>Public praise and prayer stir up the
mind, and awaken it from its slum∣ber;
for we are asleep as to heavenly
things, and our thoughts are often
wandering in the midst of our devo∣tions;
but still public devotions are of
great use.</P>
<P>Private praise and prayer may be
performed almost without interrup∣tion,
the lifting up of the heart may
be so frequent; and in those private
devotions there is no fear of hypocri∣sy
or ostentation.</P>
<P>Meditation is another kind of pri∣vate
devotion, in which the mind
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
thinks of the power and wisdom of
God, or any of his attributes: it con∣siders
the works of creation and pro∣vidence;
and as these things cannot
be considered without delight, medi∣tation
will naturally end in praise and
thanksgiving; and when we think on
our own folly and corruption, toge∣ther
with the sad state of the earth,
our meditation will naturally end in
prayer. It is impossible for those who
are taken up with the low pursuits of
the world, and who never pray but
for form's sake, to comprehend what
delight others may have, who pray
from another spirit; nor what disco∣veries
it may please God to make un∣to
them.</P>
<P>All the Christian virtues are inse∣parably
linked together; but humili∣ty
is a principal one, and without it
prayer would not be acceptable, nor
any thing that we could perform.
Humility has been called “the altar
on which God would have us offer
our sacrifices:” and this justly; for
what can the worship of the proud
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
signify, whose end in all their actions
is their own glory rather than God's?</P>
<P>The good effects of humility, and
the bad effects of pride, are both seen
in that excellent hymn of the Virgin
<HI>Mary,</HI> “He hath put down the
mighty from their seat, and hath
exalted the humble and meek,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We are taught to pray, that
“God's kingdom may come;” not
only his glorious reign in the next
world, which will come in his appoint∣ed
time, but also that he may reign
in the soul during the present life;
and this can only be in the soul that
is humble; for “God resisteth the
proud.”</P>
<P>Nor can our prayers be of any use
to us, unless we deny ourselves, and
follow the example of our blessed Sa∣viour.
If we pretend to pray, with∣out
abstaining from what our con∣science
tells us we ought to abstain, we
do not “lift up pure hands.”</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The manners of the present Christians
compared with the doctrine of Jesus
Christ.</HEAD>
<P>THis comparison is extreme melan∣choly.
We see in the Acts of the
Apostles how great marks of love the
primitive Christians expressed to one
another, and to the whole earth.
They lived according to the doctrine
of their blessed master; and we can∣not
too often think of that doctrine
of universal love, and of all virtues.</P>
<P>Nor should we ever forget our Sa∣viour's
example, since example often
goes farther than precept. He lived
poor, we are eager to be rich: this is
enough to shew how his example is
followed at present.</P>
<P>But we ought particularly to re∣member
his manner of life before he
entered upon his ministry▪ He lived
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
thirty years in an obscure and poo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
employment; he shewed himself on∣ly
to the world “to obey the will of
him that sent him;” and to do
good to mankind; he still continued
in his poverty, having no where to
lay his head; and submitted to the
cruelest affronts, and the severest
death.</P>
<P>Many Christians at first imitated
their great master; they did not rush
into employments, they were content
with food and raiment, and patiently
endured hunger and thirst, and the
greatest poverty, contempt, imprison∣ment,
scourging, and death itself.</P>
<P>When their numbers increased,
they were still more persecuted; and
it is almost incredible what they en∣dured
for the name of <HI>Christ,</HI> under
the persecuting Emperors, for the
space of three hundred years. Shal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I ask, how many would suffer martyr∣dom
in this age?</P>
<P>Nothing would be more useful
than to have our Saviour's words
frequently in our mind, and to put
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e question to ourselves, How do
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e observe them? For instance:</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jesus Christ says, “Lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth,
but lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven.” Do not we lay up as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch as we can, and still covet more?
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost of our Saviour's precepts and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounsels have a reason joined to them,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, that the treasures of the earth are
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able to so many accidents, and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eavenly treasures to none. The same
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bservation may be made of other of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is blessed instructions.</P>
<P>Jesus Christ says, “Judge not, that
ye be not judged.” Do not we
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udge and condemn our neighbours,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithout hearing what they have to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay for themselves? Is not the most
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f our conversation taken up in cen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring
and blaming, and putting hard
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onstructions upon every body's ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons?
And as we censure others, so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey censure us.</P>
<P>Jesus Christ says, “Whosoever
shall say to his brother, Thou fool▪
shall be in danger of hell-fire.”
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
Are not our expressions very often
full of insolence and contempt? And
they would be so more frequently, if
we were not afraid of worse treatment
from others; for the danger of hell
is little minded.</P>
<P>Not only the sermon on the mount
should be considered, but the whole
strain of our Saviour's doctrine, with
which we may compare our own be∣haviour.</P>
<P><HI>Jesus Christ</HI> bids us “be humble:”
Are not we extravagantly proud?
He bids us “take the lowest place:”
Are we not still aiming at the high∣est?
He bids us “be meek:” Art
we not stubborn and passionate? At
the same rate, we may go through all
our Saviour's instruction<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the
instructions of his apostles, and com∣pare
them with the practice of the
professors of Christianity at this time.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be said, that Chri∣stians
have been very corrupt at all
times. The thing is too true: even
in the apostles days there were cor∣ruptions
both in doctrine and prac∣tice:
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
pride gives rise to contentions
and heresies. But after the persecu∣tions
ceased, the corruptions grew
excessive: when the church was in
riches and splendor, a door was o∣pened
to competition and envy; and
luxury increased among all ranks.</P>
<P>To preach up poverty, and live in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omp, is very unsuitable. But let
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he doctrine of <HI>Christ</HI> be followed, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot the manners of men; and let
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose who blame others in different
stations consider in their consciences,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f they would not do the same things,
were they in the same circumstances.
And let it be considered in general,
that the great decay of Christianity is
chiefly owing to the neglect of that
great duty of self-denial.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Self-denial the foundation of most of the
Christian duties.</HEAD>
<P>SOmewhat hath been said upon this
head already. We must deny our∣selves
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
selves if we would be the disciples of
<HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> This truth cannot be
too often repeated.</P>
<P>Faith is indeed supposed to go be∣fore
all duties. We must have some
faith even before we pray; and we
must pray that we may get more
saith.</P>
<P>We must pray also that we may be
assisted in the great work of self-de∣nial.
If we continue to indulge our∣selves
in things wherein we know we
ought to deny ourselves, our prayers
cannot be heard upon any account;
for our conscience gives us the lie.</P>
<P>We must consider with our own
conscience what things we ought to
deny ourselves in; for no man can
lay down rules to his neighbour.</P>
<P>Every body knows he should ab∣stain
from gross sins, which is one
kind of self-denial; but there are e∣ven
some gross sins, which the force
of custom makes people forget that
they are sins, such as <HI>drunkenness,</HI>
which St <HI>Paul</HI> numbereth among the
abominable works of the flesh.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="58"/>
But self-denial in things that are
not so gross is almost quite forgot. It
is self-denial to restrain a passionate
world; but very few are at any pains
with themselves in that point. The
rude ignorant people curse their neigh∣bours
to their face, and rail and scold
in a shameful manner: and some
who have had better education, fail
prodigiously in the government of the
tongue.</P>
<P>But it is not angry words only that
are to be restrained, but whatever
gratifies our own vanity, or our
neighbours, though we are not so
ready to err upon this last side: the
most of our discourse drives at some
respect for ourselves; we seek to
shew our skill and our wit in every
thing; sometimes we have a desire to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e thought religious, and at other
times we are ashamed to own religion;
just as the fancy takes us, or as we
think it will raise our character with
the present company.</P>
<P>Self-denial would suppress all these
foolish and wicked motions, or at
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
least weaken them: for we must re∣member,
that all sins come from the
heart, or lie in the will; our mem∣bers
only execute our vile purposes;
the hand that kills is not to blame,
for the same hand may give alms; as
the same tongue that <HI>curses</HI> may <HI>bless.</HI></P>
<P>If we could get the length of self∣denial,
the most of <HI>our</HI> work would
be done, and God would do the rest:
something we must do; our con∣science
tells us so; “but it is God who
worketh in us both to will and to do.”
The sun shines first, but we must open
our eyes to see the light: we must
own that the very power of opening
our eyes is from God; but we dare
not say that he refuses us this power.</P>
<P>We must resign ourselves, or give
up our will and all we have to God▪
and if we do this heartily, we shall
soon be led to all the acts of self-de∣nial
that are fit for us.</P>
<P>We must acknowledge, to the ho∣nour
of religion, that self-denial is
only required upon our own account.
God, who hath no pleasure in the
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
death of a sinner, hath none in any
affliction or uneasiness. To deny
ourselves, is but to deny our corrupt
nature, in its perverse appetites and
imaginations. It is true, we must de∣ny
it even in its allowable desires,
when the indulging them would inter∣fere
with our perfection.</P>
<P>We are in a fallen corrupted state.
It is now necessary for us to deny our
own wills, to stifle our irregular pas∣sions
and appetites, as far as we are
able. We must subdue our vanity,
and our excessive desire of esteem.</P>
<P>We are surrounded with tempta∣tions
of all kinds; we must therefore
keep a continual watch over our
actions, our words, and our very
thoughts. All this is self-denial; for
we are forward and prone to all evil
and folly: we can hardly be in a
place where drink is going, without
being drunk; we can hardly open our
mouth to speak, without speaking
unfavourably of our neighbours, or
too favourably of ourselves; if not
sounding our own praises directly, at
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
least falling upon contrivances to make
others praise us.</P>
<P>It were endless to mention all our
defects, and consequently all the acts
of self-denial which we should prac∣tise
upon every occasion. We must
examine ourselves, and see what vices
we are most inclined to, or “the
weights which so easily beset us,”
as the apostle says, and pray to God
that he may remove them.</P>
<P>There is one thing always to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
kept in mind, that if we do not deny
ourselves, by checking the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st mo∣tions
of vice, they grow too strong
for us to resist, and one vicious act
makes way for another, till at last
there is a settled habit, and we are
tied and bound with chains of our
own making. Let us consider this
carefully, from the melancholy in∣stances
we may have felt in ourselves,
and heard of in others.</P>
<P>Here somewhat ought to be said
concerning the cross, as being the
particular badge of Christianity. Our
Saviour bids us “take up our cross:”
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
for it is laid upon all men, and the
taking it up implieth a chearful sub∣mission
to it.</P>
<P>The cross must be bitter to us, or
it would be no cross; and God, who
knoweth best what is necessary for
our cure, layeth such crosses upon us
as his divine wisdom sees sit for that
purpose. There are crosses to bear
every hour of the day; whatever
contradicts our humour is a cross,
whether the contradiction is reason∣able
or not. Different tempers must
cross <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd mortify one another, which
doth good on both sides: even well-intentioned
people may crucify one
another, through their remains of
imperfection; and their reflecting af∣terwards
upon their error is a new
cross to themselves.</P>
<P>Bodily pain, and loss of goods and
reputation, are crosses that God lays
upon us. Persons advanced in the
spiritual life speak of crosses laid on
more immediately by his divine hand,
which are still harder to bear, as tend∣ing
to a more inward purification.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Equity and Compassion.</HEAD>
<P>THE great duty of self-denial, men∣tioned
in the former chapter,
would make other duties follow of
course, if it were faithfully practised.
If the ill humours were out of the bo∣dy,
health would be restored imme∣diately.</P>
<P>Man was made upright, and some
sense of equity still remains in him,
as also some compassion and tender∣ness
for others.</P>
<P>Equity, or justice, in the highest sig∣nification,
implies all the duties we
owe, even those we owe to God. It
is just that we should praise and love
him, because he is infinitely lovely
and praise-worthy. But we shall first
consider justice only as it relates to
men.</P>
<P>Our blessed Saviour gives us the
measure or standard of justice or e∣quity:
“Therefore all things what∣soever
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
ye would that men should do
to you, do ye even so to them.” He
adds, “For this is the law and the pro∣phets,”
It is all that is required in
the law and the prophets, with regard
to our neighbour. The love of God
is indeed the “fulfilling of the law;”
but if “we do not love our neigh∣bour
whom we have seen, we can∣not
love God, whom we have not
seen.” So the apostle tells us. And
it is remarkable, that the words of the
scripture have a plainness and force in
them, which men very often obscure
and weaken by their explications.</P>
<P>The happy effects of justice may
be imagined, by considering the un∣happy
effects of injustice. The earth
is covered with war and bloodshed;
groans and tears are the effects of in∣justice,
even in private persons.</P>
<P>Justice implies compassion. We
are naturally dear to ourselves. If
we were just, our neighbours would
be dear to us in like manner.</P>
<P>It is but a poor kind of justice that
only abstains from doing injury. We
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
ought to support and relieve others
as we see them in difficulties, since we
would wish to be supported and re∣lieved
ourselves: and it would not
deserve the name of compassion, to
pass by a person in distress, (though
we might feel some pity for him), if
we give him no manner of assistance.
The <HI>tender-hearted Samaritan</HI> is a
noble character.</P>
<P>Hard-heartedness will soon turn in∣to
oppression, and oppression into
cruelty. How many little oppressions
are people guilty of, which are very
grievous to the sufferers! A bitter
word, a contemptuous look, with
many other instances of ill humour,
and saucy behaviour; such things
happen among equals.</P>
<P>But how many instances of severity
in the higher ranks against the low∣er!
the rich oppress the poor. I do
not mean those who have not the ne∣cessaries
of life, but those who are
some degrees poorer than themselves.
What vexatious law-suits! what im∣positions
and fines! landlords op∣press
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
the farmers, and the farmers
oppress any that depend upon them.</P>
<P>Nor are the lowest ranks to be vin∣dicated;
for they are troublesome ve∣ry
often. Servants are stubborn and
unfaithful, and sometimes as saucy as
their masters.</P>
<P>Oppression is too often found a∣mong
the nearest relations, “Hus∣bands
bitter against their wives,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> confess all these cannot be called
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle oppressions; they are very se∣vere,
and discover the want of a ten∣der
heart.</P>
<P>It can never be enough considered
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>how Christianity is so eminent for
that blessed virtue of compassion, I
ought to have called it <HI>brotherly love,</HI>
even love to mankind. Christianity
requires us to love our enemies. A∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>las!
how far are we from that prac∣tice!</P>
<P>To return to justice, equity, righ∣teousness,
integrity, which are all
words for the same thing: The face
of the world would be soon altered
if righteousness took place. But this
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
happy change we are hardly to expect
here. Let us however do the best we
can for our own part, and “look for
new heavens and a new earth,
wherein dwelleth righteousness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Peter iii. 13.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>St <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, after our Saviour,
that “all the law is fulfilled in one
word, even in this, Thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thy self<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 14.</NOTE>.” And
after he had mentioned the works of
the flesh in the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me chapter, he says,
“But the fruit of the Spirit is love,
joy, peace, long-suffering, gentle∣ness,
goodness, faith, meekness,
temperance; against such there is
no law.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Charity.</HEAD>
<P>THis divine virtue often passeth on∣ly
for <HI>giving of alms,</HI> or any good
that is done to men: but what St
<HI>Paul</HI> understands chiefly by it is the
love of God. The word <HI>charity</HI> sig∣nifies
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
<HI>love;</HI> and this divine virtue is
the chief and mother of all virtues;
it implies the purest adoration of the
supreme being, and the fullest surren∣der
of all the powers of our soul: in
short it may be called a principle re∣gulating
all our actions and motions.
To be convinced of the apostle's
meaning, we need but look at the de∣scription
and the marks he gives of it
to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> “Though I speak
with the tongues of men and an∣gels,
and have not charity, I am
become as sounding brass, or a
tinkling cymbal. And though I
have all faith, so that I could re∣move
mountains, and have not cha∣rity,
I am nothing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii.</NOTE>.” The love of
our neighbour is certainly included in
the apostle's description; for “cha∣rity
is kind.”</P>
<P>Let the whole chapter be read.
The apostle proceeds to give the
marks of charity, which cannot agree
so well to any thing as to the love of
God, though there are things in the
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
description of it that agree likewise to
the love of our neighbour: but cha∣rity
is “that which is perfect.” And
the apostle concludes, “And now a∣bideth
faith, hope, charity, these
three; but the greatest of these is
charity.”</P>
<P>Reason itself may teach us that the
love of God is the greatest of all du∣ties,
and that they must all be com∣prehended
in it. In our imperfect
love of any person, we do all we can
to please and shew our esteem, and
are ready to obey all the commands
and to do the will of the beloved per∣son.
How much more reasonable is
it to do the will of our blessed Maker,
and “to love him with our whole
heart, strength, and mind!” He
is the fountain of all goodness and
beauty: we would love him for
his own excellencies, if our hearts
were in good order; and all we can
do in the mean time is to give up our
hearts wholly to him, that he may
cleanse and purify them, and enlight∣en
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
our minds, that we may see his
divine perfections in the true light.</P>
<P>We must pray for the assistance
and grace of God, that we may be
enabled to do what we cannot do by
nature, or of ourselves. We must
pray, that he would root out every
thing in us that hinders us from lo∣ving
him with all the powers and fa∣culties
of our soul.</P>
<P>We have no notion of the deep
corruption that hinders us from lo∣ving
God: “We cannot serve two
masters;” we love the world, and
the things in it, and these chiefly for
the love we bear to ourselves: so that
it is this hateful <HI>self-love,</HI> or selfish∣ness,
that makes us forget God, and
care for nothing but what pleases us
for the present time, or serves our
present interest, or rather our hu∣mour;
for our friends become our
enemies, how soon they cross our in∣clinations,
even though they do it for
our good.</P>
<P>Thus are we blinded by <HI>self-love,</HI>
which is the idol we set up in the
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
place of God. The Heathens, who
worship stocks and stones ignorantly,
are not so much to blame, as we who
worship ourselves, and would have
every body fall down before us.</P>
<P>But it is only the power of God
that can break this idol to pieces. It
is not in our power to free ourselves
of our arrogance and folly. Any
good thing we do is ready to make us
value ourselves upon it, and so we
grow more proud. If we do not
<HI>give alms</HI> with a design <HI>that we may
be seen of men,</HI> at least the reflection
is apt to come in our heads that men
will praise us, and we have often too
much complacency in that reflection.</P>
<P>But often we perform our poor
works with an express intention that
men may praise us; and we endea∣vour
to come off as cheap as we can:
Going to church is but a small mat∣ter;
and we can meet with an ac∣quaintance
at the same time, or shew
our best cloaths; and this we would
have pass for devotion.</P>
<P>I am far from disparaging any reli∣gious
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
observance; we have need of
many things to stir up our dull
minds: but I wish people would exa∣mine
themselves upon the motives of
their actions, and see whether they
are done for God's glory or their
own.</P>
<P>What are we that we should rob
God of his glory? <HI>Dust and ashes</HI> and
sin. We may see the reasonableness
of self-denial, though our Saviour
had not recommended it: it is just
with respect to God, and necessary
upon our own account; for we must
ascend to the love of God by those
steps of prayer, self-denial, and all
the other duties of religion.</P>
<P>I must say again, that common
reason is enough to shew us, that
God's glory ought to be the aim of
all our actions; and that we ought to
love him above all things, since he is
the most perfect of all beings, and
the author of all that is good; and
that our heart must love something,
and is only happy in loving what can
satisfy it, which created things can
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
never do. All this, I say, reason
may teach us imperfectly, but it is
only the divine light that can teach us
perfectly, and only the divine power
that can draw us out of our <HI>corrup∣tion</HI>
and <HI>selfishness,</HI> which are but two
words for the same thing.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of true Conversion.</HEAD>
<P>MEN are very ready to fall into
dangerous mistakes concerning
this point, not considering that con∣version
is the turning from the love
of pleasure to the love of God, from
the flesh to the spirit, from unrigh∣teousness
to righteousness, or from a∣ny
state which makes us disagreeable
to God, to the contrary, which
makes us acceptable to him.</P>
<P>It is indeed a comfort to think we
are in such a church, or society,
where we can have the best helps to
religion, and where the doctrine of
Jesus Christ is taught in the greatest
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
purity. But this is not all; we must
consider seriously what the gospel re∣quires
of us; we must “strive to
enter in at the strait gate,” and to
walk as our Redeemer hath directed
us, and walked before us.</P>

and see how our behaviour
agrees with that of our blessed master.</P>
<P>What can possess us to think we
are <HI>reformed</HI> and <HI>converted,</HI> when we
are still living in wickedness? God
is too good to impose upon us; it
were blasphemy to think it; if the
devil deceiveth us, it seems we are
willing to be deceived; and so upon
the matter we deceive ourselves. The
devil may tempt us, but he cannot
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
force our will; nor can he so delude
our understanding, as to make us
take vice for virtue. God hath not
given our adversary such absolute
power over any of our faculties.</P>
<P>But we are at no pains to resist the
devil, nor our own corrupt inclina∣tions;
and our pride makes us throw
the blame of our misdeeds any where
but upon ourselves: we blame the de∣vil
when we should not; yea, we are
so void of shame and piety, as some∣times
to blame the merciful and just
God.</P>
<P>Let us not deceive ourselves, by
thinking we are converted when we
are not. To be converted, we must
“be renewed in the spirit of our
mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 23.</NOTE>,” as the apostle tells us. The
going from one party to another, is no
more <HI>conversion</HI> nor <HI>reformation,</HI> than
the going from one town to another.</P>
<P>Conversion is the drawing near to
God with the heart. He complain∣ed
of the Jews, that “they drew
near to him with their mouth,
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
and honoured him with their lips,
when their heart was far from
him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxix. 13.</NOTE>.” See also the first chapter
of that prophet, wherein their sacri∣fices
are called <HI>vain oblations,</HI> and all
their outward observances are despi∣sed,
though they were of God's ex∣press
appointment, and not of man's:
but the heart having no share in those
things, they became an <HI>abomination.</HI></P>
<P>What delusion is it to call ourselves
the <HI>elect,</HI> the <HI>godly,</HI> the <HI>reformed,</HI> the <HI>re∣generate,</HI>
the <HI>true church,</HI> or any title
that men take to themselves, without
having the spirit of Jesus Christ? It is
uneasy to mention such plain truths,
and sometimes they are very unwel∣come;
but the delusion is excessive.
If, on the other hand, people assume
such titles, only to get dominion over
others, no words can express such
impudence and profanation.</P>
<P>True conversion (I must say it once
more) is from the <HI>natural</HI> man to
the <HI>spiritual,</HI> from the life of <HI>Adam</HI>
to the life of <HI>Christ,</HI> from the love of
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
ourselves to the love of God, from
sin to righteousness; in a word, from
such states as the scripture condemn∣eth,
to such states as it approveth:
for as it cannot be said, that a dis∣eased
body recovers health only by
changing its cloaths, so neither is the
health of the soul restored by the
mere change of forms and professions.</P>
<P>I beg leave to make a distinction be∣twixt
true conversion and perfect
conversion. Perfect conversion is that
state wherein “we live no more,”
(as St Paul expresseth it) “but <HI>Christ</HI>
liveth in us:” and we cannot con∣ceive
what we must undergo before
we arrive at this blessed state.</P>
<P>True conversion may be said to
happen, when our hearts are touch∣ed
with a sincere desire of forsaking
our own will, in order to do the will
of our heavenly Father. This may
be called real, or true conversion;
for the bare change from one out∣ward
form to another is but a false or
sham conversion.</P>
<P>But true conversion may be attend∣ed
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
with many imperfections. A man
may have a right view of the end of
his journey, or the place where he
should arrive at, as also of the place
from whence he should depart; he
may have a hearty desire to leave the
one, and to reach the other:</P>
<P>I say, we may begin our journey
from this world to the heavenly <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI>
with a very sincere intention;
but then we may be very often intan∣gled
with the things of this miserable
world, the vain fruitless desire of
pleasing men, and the silly fear of
what they may say. We may be like∣wise
hindered by our own violent
passions, which may stop our journey
like storms of wind or rain. We
may be beat down to the ground,
and plunged in the mire of vices; but
as we fall, so we may get up again,
and go on our journey the best we
can; for we are never to despair of
the help of God.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the right Use of Time.</HEAD>
<P>WE are here but a few days, till
we must appear before the judg∣ment
seat of God, to give a strict ac∣count
of all we have done in the bo∣dy.
Of this short time we cannot call
a moment our own: we may die with
the very word in our mouth. How
great need therefore have we to em∣ploy
our short and uncertain time to
good purpose! It is a kind of stock
put in our hands to purchase eternal
happiness; and if we squander it a∣way,
we lose that happiness, and fall
into unspeakable misery.</P>
<P>Sleep, and other necessities of our
frail bodies, must take away a great
part of our time from us: but for
this we are not accountable▪ if we do
not waste too much of it in relieving
those necessities, or rather indulging
our pleasures.</P>
<P>We must also labour in our several
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
employments, by which much time is
cut off from the service of God; but
it cannot be called lost time, since
work and labour is of his appoint∣ment.
And what a happiness this is
for mankind, every body knows:
They who have little to do, are often
more unhappy than those who gain
their living by the sweat of their
brow.</P>
<P>As it is idleness that makes people
fall upon foolish amusements and di∣versions,
to pass away the time which
hangs so heavy upon their hands, it
were very reasonable for them to
think how they might pass it better;
since if they ever reflect especially
on a dying bed, it will be very grie∣vous
to them that they have spent
their precious time so foolishly and
unworthily. How will it torture
them to look back upon their gaming
and drinking, their obscene discourse,
their common way of censuring their
neighbours, in a word, all their tri∣fling
and sinful practices!</P>
<P>I shall not condemn every thing
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
that is called diversion; a game at
cards is better than drinking, or
speaking ill without drinking. A
man's own conscience and good ad∣vice
must direct him for the best, or
the least evil, in such cases; for it is
to be acknowledged, that both body
and mind have need of some relaxa∣tion.</P>
<P>The great body of mankind must
work hard for their bread; it were
good if they could mix some good
thoughts with their labour; which
they might do if they were wise, and
it would very much sweeten their toil.
They might meditate in the field up∣on
God's goodness; pious reflections
might rise when they plough and
sow; and in their houses they might
have many occasions of lifting up
their hearts to God in short prayers
and praises, without any body's know∣ing
what passed in their minds.</P>
<P>Such secret devotions, or whatever
they may be 'called, might be per∣formed
by all ranks: but they must
pass very unobservedly, otherwise
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
pride might mingle with them, and
the company would look upon it as
dreaming, or perhaps madness.</P>
<P>But we are not only to endeavour
to spend our time well for our own
improvement in devotion; we must
likewise endeavour to spend it for our
neighbour's good; and so we must
seek all occasions of relieving the
poor and distressed that properly fall
to our share, for prudence must still
go along; at least we must omit no
occasion that offereth to us of doing
good any manner of way, either by
money, or any other assistance.</P>
<P>We must neither forget our neigh∣bours
nor ourselves. We must not
turn. “keepers of others vineyards,
and neglect our own.” The con∣stant
intention of pleasing God would
lead us right in every thing.</P>
<P>That happy intention is the <HI>walking
before God.</HI> If we consider ourselves
as still in his presence, (which un∣doubtedly
we are), we shall employ
our whole time in doing what we
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
ought; though still we must look up∣on
ourselves as unprofitable servants.</P>
<P>One very happy way of passing time
is in good conversation; nor can any
thing be more agreeable. But here I
suppose there is familiarity, else the
discourse must only be upon common
things: every one is on his guard,
and afraid to talk of religion, lest it
should be thought <HI>cant;</HI> which in∣deed
is very much to be shunned.</P>
<P>But when true friends meet toge∣ther,
who have a relish for pious con∣versation,
they may be very useful to
one another; and they ought to lay
aside reserve.</P>
<P>Religious assemblies, public and
private prayers, good meditations
when alone or in company, (for the
mind is still going upon somewhat),
all these things are very good for em∣ploying
the time.</P>
<P>Reading books of instruction is
what every body knows to be useful,
and no books so useful as the holy
scriptures.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Exhortation to the Study of the
Scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>WHat pity is it that such a present
from heaven should be so
shamefully neglected! The scriptures
are the word of God, and the mani∣festation
of his will to the children of
men: How carefully ought we to stu∣dy
them, both from our interest and
our duty! What study could be so
pleasant, if we had any taste? The
writings of the Old and New Testa∣ment
excel all other writings, in the
plainness and nobleness of the style,
beside the greatness of the truths they
discover. How important are these
truths, on which our happiness or mi∣sery
depend for ever! Yet God
speaketh, and men will not hear!
“Fools hate instruction. We love
darkness better than light, because
our deeds are evil.”</P>
<P>A little was said before concerning
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>
the truths which holy writ teacheth
us. It shews us what man was once;
what we are now, through the fault
of our first parents; and what we
may be through the merits of Jesus
Christ, if our own fault is not a hin∣derance.</P>
<P>The people of <HI>Berea</HI> are commend∣ed
in the Acts of the Apostles, for
their diligence in searching the scrip∣tures:
and they had only the books of
the Old Testament in their hands.
Much more ought the scriptures to
be studied now, since the books of
the New Testament are added.</P>
<P>Both Testament may be compared
together. Our Saviour's coming in∣to
the world, and all his miracles and
sufferings, are prophesied in the Old
Testament; and he appealeth to it in
his arguing with the <HI>Jews,</HI> some of
whom believed in him, and others re∣jected
him, because they expected a
deliverer who should make them
great in this world. Temporal great∣ness
is a bewitching thing.</P>
<P>The state of the <HI>Jews</HI> at this time
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
is melancholy: it was foretold also;
and there are many prophecies con∣cerning
their conversion. It will still
come: “A thousand years in God's
sight are but as one day.”</P>
<P>The Old Testament contains the hi∣story
of that remarkable nation. It
begins indeed with the history of the
world. What strange events! The
<HI>creation,</HI> the <HI>fall,</HI> the <HI>flood,</HI> the <HI>Red
sea,</HI> the <HI>law,</HI> the <HI>promised land;</HI> in a
word, all the extraordinary affairs of
that people, from <HI>Abraham</HI> to the
captivity, and some things which be∣fel
them from that time to the birth
of our Saviour, including two and
forty generations, as St <HI>Matthew</HI> in∣formeth
us.</P>
<P>The New Testament contains our
Saviour's life, his doctrine and mi∣racles,
his sufferings and death, his
resurrection and ascension; the be∣ginnings
of the Christian church, the
labours and miracles of the apostles,
their instruction to the faithful in
their epistles; and, lastly, the revela∣tion
of St <HI>John;</HI> for the true explica∣tion
<PB N="80" REF="87"/>
of which men must wait till God's
appointed time.</P>
<P>It must be remembered, that in
the books of both Testaments there
are more meanings than the literal.
St <HI>Paul</HI> speaking of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s two
sons, the one by <HI>Sarah,</HI> and the other
by the <HI>bond-woman,</HI> addeth, “Which
things are an allegory.”</P>
<P>Some of those figures are appli∣cable
to the next world, which is call∣ed
the <HI>New Jerusalem:</HI> others of
them are applicable to the spiritual
state of the soul; as outward circum∣cision
is a figure of the circumcision
of the heart; the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> a figure
of our unlawful desires and passions;
with a thousand things besides, which
have a relation to moral actions, and
the inward life, though the outward
literal meaning is never to be laid a∣side,
unless the expressions are only
figurative, as when God is said to
have hands and feet, anger, derision,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Let this be considered, and per∣haps
it will not be found a bad key
for understanding several passages of
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>
holy writ, which would be of great
use for the true reformation of our
lives.</P>
<P>When one considers all the beau∣ties
and advantages of these sacred
books, the historical part, the reli∣gious
ordinances, (even under the
law), the pure doctrine, the well-at∣tested
miracles, the fine compositions
of poetry, the prophecies, and their
accomplishment, and above all, the
life and offices of our blessed Redeem∣er;
I say, when one considers all
these things, he must be astonished at
the impicity of despising and ridicu∣ling
what is so divine in itself, and ad∣vantageous
to mortals!</P>
<P>But such strange spirits there are;
though perhaps they are led by a spi∣rit
more cunning than their own,
whose interest they are carrying on
without any express covenant with
him.</P>
<P>Whatever may be of that, it is a∣mong
the higher ranks that such im∣piety
is most heard of: the great bo∣dy
of the people have a respect for
<PB N="82" REF="89"/>
the word of God; they have less
pride, and sounder judgment, than
the “scoffers, who walk after their
own lusts,” as the apostle express∣eth
it.</P>
<P>At the same time it must be own∣ed,
that the great body of the people
are very ignorant of the design and
meaning of the scriptures in many
cases. It is pity to see how they fall
to work with the Bible: they take it
up at random, and sometimes read a
passage of the Levitical law with the
same grave tone as if it were a part of
<HI>Christ</HI>'s sermon on the mount.</P>
<P>In this point the judgment of the
people is not to be made speeches on;
but it proceeds much from inadver∣tency:
and since their intention is
good, any little endeavours for their
better information ought chearfully to
be given, expecting from the Holy
Spirit alone the fruit of any endea∣vours,
and true light only from that
Spirit both to others and ourselves.</P>
<P>I have often thought it would not
be an ill method for those who have
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
Bibles, and can write, to make some
extracts out of them concerning the
most remarkable vices and virtues.
For example, to take pride, and so
collect some texts concerning the dan∣ger
and abomination of it. Some∣times
the same verse will contain both
the vice, and the virtue opposite to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is somewhat of this kind done by Dr Gastrel; but it need not hinder people from making extracts for themselves, provided they can make them with discretion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to pride: “When pride co∣meth,
then cometh shame.” “Pride
goeth before destruction.” “A
man's pride shall bring him low.”
“Only by pride cometh contention.”
“Wo to the crown of pride.” “A
proud heart will not I suffer.”
“Though the Lord be high, yet
hath he respect to the lowly, but
the proud he knoweth afar off.”
“For God resisteth the proud, and
giveth grace to the humble.” St
<HI>Peter</HI> had said immediately before,
“Be ye all subject one to another,
and clothed with humility.”</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="91"/>
The like extracts might be made
upon other subjects; against lying
and deceit, against gluttony and
drunkenness, against sloth, against
anger, against hypocrisy, against op∣pression,
against evil-speaking of all
kinds; in short, against every thing
that is offensive to religion and good
manners.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Canaanites</HI> were driven
out of the Holy Land before the chil∣dren
of <HI>Israel</HI> got possession of it, so
vices are rooted out of the soul before
the planting of virtues. And the like
extracts might be made as to these:</P>
<P>On righteousness, on temperance,
on mercifulness, on the fear and love
of God; which last is all in all.</P>
<P>Extracts might also be made con∣cerning
the miseries of the present
life, and the hopes of a better: on
death and judgment; or any subject
which the well disposed Christian had
a mind to consider with a particular
attention.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Necessity of Discretion, Watchful∣ness,
and Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>THE conclusion of a former chap∣ter
suggested a reflection, that in
practising certain virtues, and shun∣ning
certain vices, we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some ha∣zard
of falling into extremes: for the
common saying is here very true▪
That virtue lieth in the middle.</P>
<P>There are some vices so absolutely
wicked and base, that we cannot keep
at too great a distance from them;
such as pride, envy, malice, and ma∣ny
more. There are some virtues so
necessary and charming, that we can
never have too much of them; such
as sincerity, humility, and the like.</P>
<P>There are lesser virtues, such as li∣berality,
that must be practised with
discretion: for if a man should give
too much to one that happened to
ask first, he might put himself out of
a capacity of assisting another person
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
of more worth and necessity, that
might come afterwards. Indeed our
blessed Saviour bids us in general
“Give to him that asketh; and from
him that would borrow, not to
turn away.” His divine wisdom
did not see it necessary to make any
restrictions, since nature is too ready
to seek excuses and dispensations from
its duty.</P>
<P>But we are not so ready to err up∣on
the <HI>giving side;</HI> only we are to
guard against too much easiness of
temper, which would make us a prey
to every importunate, or every unjust
person.</P>
<P>Discretion must go along with our
actions; the prudence of the serpent
must be joined with the simplicity of
the dove: our Lord himself recom∣mends
it, and often bids us “beware
of men.”</P>
<P>Nor is it less necessary we should
<HI>beware of ourselves,</HI> since we are our
own greatest enemies; for which rea∣son,
the duty of self-examination is
often recommended: but then we
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
must take care not to go to an excess
in making too many reflections upon
our own conduct; which would make
us fall into foolish scruples, and put
a stop to all good actions; it might
even turn our heads, and make us
distrust the mercy of God. I grant
the scrupulous state is not so ordinary
as carelessness and impiety: but all ex∣tremes
are to be shunned.</P>
<P>It is certain that vices can never
turn virtues; but there are virtues
that may turn vices, by pushing them
too far. Chearfulness is a virtue;
but when it passes certain bounds, it is
folly and insolence.</P>
<P>Diligence is a virtue; but it may
turn to hurry, precipitation, and an∣xiety
of mind. Reproof is a virtue;
but it may turn to chiding and scold∣ing.</P>
<P>Thus many good things may dege∣nerate:
frugality may become sor∣did;
decent living, fantastical. We
may be too coarse, or too fine, in our
apparel; too nasty, or too nice: in
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
our behaviour, too formal, or too
rough.</P>
<P>We must still guard against doing
too little or too much. <HI>Solomon</HI> speaks
of an excess in righteousness itself.
We must not expect too much from
imperfect creatures: and there are
several things which discretion must
make us wink at. It is very true,
our Saviour bids us “fulfil all righ∣teousness:”
but moderation, and
bearing with one another, is a part of
righteousness; so that <HI>Solomon</HI> seems
only to have cautioned against too ri∣gid
exactness.</P>
<P>But who is sufficient for these
things? We are surrounded with
dangers upon all sides: if we escape
<HI>rocks,</HI> we are ready to fall into <HI>quick
sands.</HI> We have bad example with∣out
us; and within we have our own
passions, and pride, that still aims to
be admired in every thing we do or
omit.</P>
<P>We must therefore be constantly
upon the watch, according to our
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
Saviour's direction; for we are pla∣ced
<HI>between fire and water.</HI></P>
<P>We must watch, and use our ut∣most
endeavours in every thing; but
at the same time we must remember,
with <HI>David,</HI> that “except the Lord
keep the city, the watchman wa∣keth
but in vain.” Without his
assistance and grace, our prudence is
but <HI>folly,</HI> and our best actions <HI>sin.</HI></P>
<P>This shews clearly the necessity of
prayer. We can never reflect enough
on our passions, our frailty, and our
inconstancy: we have the passion
and folly <HI>of the day</HI> to struggle with;
we are not the same persons in the
forenoon and afternoon; we com∣plain
of being engaged with madmen,
and forget that we are mad ourselves.</P>
<P>How many things have we to pray
for! how many things to pray a∣gainst!
The choice ought certainly
to be referred to the “fountain of all
wisdom, that knoweth our necessities
before we ask, and our ignorance in
asking.” This some of the wiser
Heathens were sensible of.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="97"/>
Somewhat was said on prayer be∣fore;
and on the most excellent form
appointed by our Saviour. “Thy
will be done,” is the most perfect
of all petitions. I do not say that the
heart may not <HI>pour itself out</HI> accor∣ding
as it finds itself moved: but we
always pray best when we come dis∣posed
to do the will of God in every
thing.</P>
<P>Nor do I say, that we must be al∣ways
on our knees when we pray:
the offering up the heart, in whatever
posture, is true prayer: and though
our attention must frequently be
drawn off from God, because of the
things we are necessarily employed in;
yet our heart may be in such a fixed
and settled state, as that the common
actions of life may be said to be done
but by accident; or even any actions,
proceeding from such a frame of
heart, may be said to be done “to
the glory of God,” as St <HI>Paul</HI> ex∣presseth
it.</P>
<P>This is the most material service of
God; this is to honour him perpe∣tually.
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
Our thoughts are ordinarily
scattered and distracted with an infi∣nite
number of things that we have
nothing to do with: such a frame
of heart would gather them in,
(which is called <HI>recollection</HI>), and
would free us of a world of trouble,
created by our wandering imagina∣tions,
and our violent passions.</P>
<P>This state may be termed continual
prayer; it doth not hinder proper
action, but rather makes it more vi∣gorous,
by freeing it from imperti∣nent
clogs.</P>
<P>Our pride and fancy allow us no
peace nor quiet, and our passions are
our executioners; we are tortured
with imaginary affronts and injuries,
when none are intended us.</P>
<P>From all which evils a heart re∣signed
to God, and only intent upon
pleasing him, would fully deliver us.
His providence would be enough for
us; we should live without anxiety
and hurry; our time would be suffi∣cient
for our business, and we should
not be a burden upon ourselves: no
<PB N="92" REF="99"/>
more suspicions; quarrels would
cease; “Envy, hatred, and malice,
and all uncharitableness,” would
be far removed from us.</P>
<P>Such a frame of heart would make
our moments pass in an unspeakable
tranquillity; all impatience, weari∣ness,
and disgust, would be cut off; we
should then be in the state of chil∣dren,
but without their folly; our
life would be attended with spiritual
comfort, even in the midst of tribu∣lations,
and our death would be “the
death of the righteous.”</P>

so the <HI>Turkish</HI> religion is a
mass of wild fictions, an absurd mix∣ture
of <HI>Paganisin, Judaism,</HI> and <HI>Chri∣stianity.</HI>
Many parts of the earth
are still over-run with gross idolatry of
various sorts.</P>
<P>Before the law of <HI>Moses,</HI> or the
<HI>Jewish</HI> religion, we hear of no out∣ward
institutions from God. Sacrifi∣ces
indeed were in use since the begin∣ning
of the world, as we see in the
instance of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel.</HI> But du∣ring
all the time before the flood,
and after it, till the giving of the law
from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> mankind were left
to the natural dictates of conscience,
or what is called <HI>natural religion,</HI> and
sometimes <HI>the patriarchal dispensation.</HI></P>
<P>Before the stood the scripture tells
us of some few men who lived plain,
inoffensive, religious lives, as having
God before their eyes in all their ac∣tions.
<PB N="94" REF="101"/>
It is said particularly of <HI>Enoch,</HI>
that he walked with God, as was ob∣served
before. But as mankind mul∣tiplied,
they became more corrupt,
“and the earth was filled with vio∣lence;”
which brought upon them
the judgment of the flood.</P>
<P>The righteous <HI>Noah,</HI> (who was
saved with his family), continued to
give a good example, except once that
we hear he was <HI>drunken.</HI> But the earth
being again overspread with disorders
and abominations, it pleased God to
call <HI>Abraham</HI> from his country, and
to institute circumcision: he worship∣ped
the true God, and his descendents
continued in his religion till the law
of <HI>Moses</HI> was given; at which period
ended the <HI>patriarchal</HI> dispensation.</P>
<P>Now, for understanding the differ∣ence
between the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI>
religions, together with the value of
each, it will be of great use to consi∣der
attentively those two great e∣pistles,
to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and the <HI>He∣brews.</HI>
But we must understand be∣forehand,
that the true <HI>Jews</HI> and
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
the true <HI>Christians</HI> had but one essen∣tial
religion, which consisted in the
love of God and our neighbour: for,
as St <HI>Paul</HI> hath said, “He is not a
<HI>Jew,</HI> who is one outwardly; nei∣ther
is that circumcision, which is
outwardly in the flesh,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This
agrees with <HI>Moses</HI>'s words to the <HI>Jews,
(Deut.</HI> x.) “Circumcise, therefore,
the foreskin of your heart, and be
no more stiff-necked,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He
had said before, “Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thine heart,”
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Our Saviour confirms the matter,
when he said to the doctor of the law
that tempted him, “Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy mind, and with all thy
strength. This is the first and great
commandment. And the second is
like unto it, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself. On these two
commandments hang all the law and
the prophets.” We see then that love
is the end of the law, and that <HI>Jews</HI>
and <HI>Christians</HI> had but one religion.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="103"/>
In the two epistles above mention∣ed,
the law of <HI>Moses</HI> gets its due, but
the <HI>Gospel</HI> is preferred, both for its
greater efficacy, and the higher cha∣racter
of its lawgiver. <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is
not only exalted above <HI>Moses,</HI> but a∣bove
the angels: for when it is said,
“He was made a little lower than
the angels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 7.</NOTE>,” it is to be understood
as he was man; for he is “heir of
all things, and maker of the
worlds.” He says of himself, “The
Father and I are one;” and St▪ <HI>John</HI>
thus begins his gospel, “In the be∣ginning
was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the
Word was God.”</P>
<P>Of <HI>Moses</HI> it is said, “He was faith∣ful
in all his house, as a servant,
for the testimony of those things
which were to be spoken after:”
but <HI>Christ</HI> “as a Son over his own
house,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI> “He is also called
the Mediator of a better covenant,
which was established upon better
promises.” Much more is to be
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
found in the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> to shew the
insufficiency of the <HI>Jewish</HI> law in
comparison of the gospel; were it
but this one verse, (chap. x.) “For
it is impossible that the blood of
bulls and goats should take away
sins.”</P>
<P>In the <HI>Romans</HI> the law is sufficient∣ly
extolled; but many things are set
down in that epistle to give the
<HI>Christian dispensation</HI> the preference.
“There is now no condemnation to
them that are in <HI>Christ Jesus;</HI>” it is
added, “to them who walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 1.</NOTE>;” to
teach us, that the bare professsion and
form of Christianity are not sufficient
to save us, without the life and power
of it, but will rather make our pu∣nishment
the greater.</P>
<P>Indeed St <HI>Paul</HI>'s great design is, to
shew the excelleney of faith above
the works of the law. The <HI>Jews</HI>
prided themselves that the law was
committed to their keeping, and that
they observed all the parts of it exact∣ly.
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>
The apostle undeceives them,
and tells them plainly they were re∣jected,
because they confided in their
outward observances and privileges,
and despised the rest of the world.</P>
<P>We must carefully remember, that
the works of the law seemingly con∣demned
by the apostle, and which
God himself rejected, when they were
not done from the spirit of religion,
but from vile motives, or superficial∣ly
at best; (for he says by the mouth
of a prophet, “Bring no more vain
oblations, incense is an abomina∣tion
unto me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 13.</NOTE>,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI>); I am bold to
say, the works disregarded by St▪ <HI>Paul</HI>
were by no means the good works of
humanity and love; for “without
works faith is dead;” as, on the o∣ther
hand, without faith no works of
any kind could avail us. What <HI>Jesus
Christ</HI> said in the case of marriage is
applicable here, “What therefore
God hath joined together, let no
man put asunder<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matth. xix. 6.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>But once more, as to the difference
<PB N="99" REF="106"/>
between the <HI>law</HI> and the <HI>gospel,</HI> or
the <HI>Jewish</HI> dispensation and the <HI>Chri∣stian,</HI>
or the <HI>Old Testament</HI> and the
<HI>New;</HI> we find, that the former dis∣pensation
was founded in fear, and
with rigorous observances; whereas
the latter was a dispensation of love,
and no burdensome ceremonies re∣quired.
It is true, we must “de∣ny
ourselves, and take up the
cross:” we must “suffer with
Christ, if we would reign with
him:” this is properly the doctrine
of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> wherein the
corruption of our nature is more
clearly discovered than in the <HI>Old.</HI>
We may conclude too from reason,
that the cross and sufferings are only
laid upon us for our own good, to
cleanse us from our impurity, as me∣tals
are purified in the fire. The
merciful God hath declared, “He
hath no pleasure in the death of a
sinner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xviii.</NOTE>;” nor is any chastisement
infl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted, but for leading man back
to his duty; which is a reason, not
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
only for resignation and submission,
but for thankfulness and love.</P>
<P>It is evident that the Christian law
is much more a law of love than the
<HI>Jewish,</HI> both with relation to God
and our neighbour. For though the
children of <HI>Israel</HI> were injoined to
love God with their whole heart, yet
rewards (temporal rewards) were
promised, to stir them up to that
great duty; infinite goodness thus
conescending to deal with his crea∣tures
according to the weakness and
grossness of their state; since they
cannot easily perceive, that to love
God is the highest reward of itself,
and the greatest happiness imaginable,
or rather a happiness beyond all ima∣gination.</P>
<P>But as the proper character of the
<HI>Jewish</HI> law was fear, temporal punish∣ments
were also threatened; which
was another argument of the gross
state of the people. <HI>Solomon</HI> indeed
hath said, “The fear of the Lord is
the beginning of wisdom;” but
“perfect love,” saith St <HI>John,</HI> “cast∣eth
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>
out fear.” This is not to be
understood of <HI>filial</HI> fear, (the reve∣rence
of children to parents), which
is distinguished from <HI>slavish</HI> fear, and
will not doubt keep its place for ever.
In short, St <HI>Paul</HI> calls the <HI>law</HI> a <HI>state
of bondage,</HI> and the <HI>gospel</HI> a <HI>state of li∣berty.</HI></P>
<P>With relation to our neighbour,
the <HI>gospel</HI> is likewise much more a law
of love than the <HI>Jewish;</HI> as easily ap∣pears
from our Saviour's sermon on
the <HI>mount,</HI> and the whole strain of
the New Testament. It is true, he
reproaches the <HI>Jews</HI> in these words,
“Thus have ye made the command∣ment
of God of none effect by
your tradition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xv. 6.</NOTE>;” with much
more to the <HI>moral law,</HI> when they
punctually observed the <HI>ceremonial
part.</HI> But still love was more insist∣ed
upon in the <HI>new law,</HI> and the
Christians were at first as remarkable
for their love to one another, as they
are now for their hatred. It was a
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
strange instance of love, when “the
multitude of them that believed
were of one heart and of one soul;
neither said any, that ought of the
things he possessed was his own;
but they had all things common.”</P>
<P>As to the difference between the
purity of manners required in the
<HI>new law</HI> and the <HI>old,</HI> let our Saviour's
doctrine be further considered. Our
very thoughts are required to <HI>be pure.</HI></P>
<P>The effects produced by the Chri∣stian
religion in its beginnings were
suitable to the purity of the doctrine:
All debauchery was at an end: The
Christians were sober and temperate
in every thing; they bore with chear∣fulness
the scorn and contempt of the
Heathens, who indulged themselves
in their excesses, and from contempt
proceeded to hatred and cruelty;
which the true followers of the <HI>cruci∣fied
Jesus</HI> endured also with the ut∣most
constancy! Men and women,
the young and aged of both sexes,
suffered a variety of exquisite tor∣ments,
rather than offer a little in∣cense
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
to a Heathen idol! and they
died praying for their persecutors and
tormentors!</P>
<P>The rage of the Heathens is the
less to be wondered at, because they
saw their own condemnation and re∣proach
in the innocent, regular,
chaste, humble lives of the Christians.
The decay of the Heathen ceremo∣nies,
the ridiculous and profane (ob∣scene)
inventions, all which “brought
no small gain” to the priests, as
well as pleasure to the observers, must
have raised the indignation of all
ranks and employments to the height
of fury. It is even thought that the
devil, whom our Saviour calls <HI>the
prince of this world,</HI> governed man∣kind
in an open manner, uttering his
delusive false oracles, and making pa∣rents
kill their children with their
own hands, “souls destitute of
help<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wisdom xii. 6.</NOTE>.” No wonder therefore if
the Christian religion, which oppo∣sed
all such worthless and abominable
practices, was hated and persecuted
<PB N="104" REF="111"/>
by those who had an interest in keep∣ing
them up. To say no more of the
great enemy of mankind, it is too
natural for men themselves to oppress
and destroy one another, upon the
least interfering of their interests,
yea, on the bare difference in opinion.
It is to be remembered, however,
that even in those times of gross
ignorance and abomination, there
were some men who lived commend∣ably,
and were “accepted of God;”
as St <HI>Paul</HI> testifies, that “the Gen∣tiles,
who had not the law,” (the
written law of <HI>Moses</HI>), “did by nature
the things contained in the law,”
(the works of justice and affection,
and other virtues), and were there∣fore
“a law unto themselves,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
By which we may judge if we have
any right to condemn all the Hea∣thens.</P>
<P>It must indeed be owned, the Hea∣then
world was in a very bad state
(as it still is) without the light of the
<HI>gospel:</HI> but the power of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI>
who raised the dead to life, added
<PB N="105" REF="112"/>
this great miracle to the rest, in ma∣king
his doctrine prevail over the
greatest powers of the earth and hell,
by the unlikeliest means imaginable
to human reason. And how low so∣ever
Christianity may be at present,
as to the practice, and its doctrine ri∣diculed
by many who take its name,
yet the same power that established it,
will keep it from salling entirely:
“For he must reign till he hath put
all his enemies under his feet.—And
when all things shall be sub∣dued
unto him, then shall the Son
also himself be subject unto him
that put all things under him, that
God may be all in all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 25. 28.</NOTE>.”</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>AS a multitude of books (of great∣er
and smaller sizes) is still ap∣pearing
on religious subjects, a man
can hardly shun giving his approba∣tion
to some, and shewing his dislike
to others; though it may be supposed
the authors on both sides have lost a
great part of their intention, whether
of doing good or evil. If any shall
say, May not a man keep his appro∣bation
or dislike to himself? there is
no doubt he may, and very often he
ought; but the question is, If he
ought always? All the answer I can
give is, that in a country where the
permission of the superiors is not re∣quired,
a man must judge for himself
the best way he can, having the good
of society always in view, at least
that it suffer no harm from his med∣dling.</P>
<P>But as the few sheets (written se∣veral
years ago) have very little I
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
can call mine in them, so the follow∣ing
scraps shall have still less; that is,
the very words, or words of the same
meaning, shall be taken out of some
books, pretty well known, and unex∣ceptionable;
and from others equally
unexceptionable, tho' less known. It
seems all one, whether the authors
are of the churches of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
of <HI>Luther</HI>'s setting up, or <HI>Calvin</HI>'s,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, suppose them to be <HI>Jews, Turks,</HI>
or <HI>Heathens;</HI> truth being always
truth, and <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> “the true
light, which lighteth every man
that cometh into the world.” I
shall therefore have nothing further
to do, but to tack some truths toge∣ther,
which naturally belong to one
subject, keeping always in view the
first design, of being intelligible to
the meanest reader, the meanest as to
the world, but whose sincerity and
attention may intitle him to the high∣est
privileges.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="108" REF="115"/>
<HEAD>The Scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>THESE sacred writings are allowed
by all parties of Christians to be of
divine authority, and consequently
the rule or standard of faith and
manners. When they are obscure,
we must be content to find our curio∣sity
put to a stand, and our pride
mortified. Our duty is still plain;
the love of God and our neighbour
admits of no gloss nor restriction.</P>
<P>The church of <HI>Rome</HI> receives some
books as <HI>canonical,</HI> or approved scrip∣ture,
which Protestant churches re∣ject,
the authors being mostly un∣known,
and therefore called <HI>apocry∣phal,</HI>
as well as reputed inferior in
the point of authority, and even in
sublimity. The church of <HI>England,</HI>
however, appoints them to be read
“for example of life, and instruction
of manners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book of Common-prayer, 6th Article of Religion.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The scripture teaches the true and
<PB N="109" REF="116"/>
spiritual worship of God, as <HI>Jesus
Christ</HI> said to the woman of <HI>Samaria,
(John</HI> iv.) “God is a Spirit,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Those sacred writings have a surpri∣sing
force in them: and herein lies
the admirable difference betwixt them
and the works of men; the scripture,
under plain and common expressions,
contains a strength and meaning
wholly divine; whereas men general∣ly
fatigue themselves to find strong
and elegant terms for expressing very
weak things. O that people knew
the benefit of reading the holy scrip∣tures!
It is surprising that any person
should be hindered from making it
his constant study, especially the New
Testament! Should children be hin∣dered
from reading their father's will?
Every body, on the contrary, should
be taught to read it with the greatest
attention, respect, and love.—This
paragraph is from a Roman Catholic.</P>
<P>There was no written instruction
during many ages after <HI>Adam</HI> was
created; and even after his full, the
divine law (written in the heart) was
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
sufficient for the faithful and sincere.
This is called <HI>the patriarchal dispensa∣tion.</HI>
But wickedness prevailed in the
earth to such a height, that all the
inhabitants (save eight persons) were
swept away by the flood. We then
hear of precepts given to the sons of
<HI>Noah;</HI> but of nothing written, till the
law of <HI>Moses;</HI> and that only to one
nation: so the wisdom of God, the
Father of mankind, thought fit; for
“God is no respecter of persons.”
Prophets were sent to the <HI>Jews</HI> at dif∣ferent
times, to reclaim them from
idolatry, and all their vices, as well as
to foretell the coming of the <HI>Messiah.</HI>
The writings of the Old Testament
are of various kinds, and not to be
parallelled in sublimity and instruction
but by those of the New. This is
the <HI>dispensation of the gospel,</HI> to which
nothing is to be added; our Saviour,
by his doctrine and example, having
finished all that was necessary to be
made known to mankind.</P>
<P>The apostles wrote epistles to the
Christian converts, to confirm them
<PB N="111" REF="118"/>
in their faith, and to remove their
mistakes, particularly concerning the
<HI>Jewish</HI> law, which some Christians
thought was still in force, with other
errors in point of worship; not omit∣ting
to recommend the duties of so∣cial
life, as between husbands and
wives, parents and children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
With respect to the spiritual life, they
had our Saviour's life for a foun∣dation,
which makes them insist so
much upon being “united with God,
transformed into his image, loving
him with the whole heart;” which
is the great duty and happiness of
men and angels. They insisted on
the necessity of <HI>self-denial,</HI> a doctrine
not current among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and less
known to the <HI>Heathens,</HI> who had ne∣ver
heard of the fall. The scripture,
in fine, has discovered many truths
concerning the dignity and corruption
of man, and the incomprehensible
nature of the ever-blessed God.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
<HEAD>The present state of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is too large a subject to be at∣tempted
in few words; yet there is
the less occasion for many, or rather
there would be occasion for none, if
the scriptures were well considered:
they inform us of the state of the
earth before the fall, when there was
no toil, no sorrow, nor disorder in
man, either as to body or soul.</P>
<P>Ever since the fall, man is much in
the same state, (the shortening of life
after the flood is far from being a
loss), born with the same appetites
and passions, which he constantly stu∣dies
to gratify, and by that means is
said to “live to himself.” Pride, co∣vetousness,
and senfuality, prevail
much in the human composition, and
man is oppressed by one or other of
these task-masters by turns: then his
imagination representing things to
him in a false light, and giving him
foolish notions of pleasure, interest,
and glory, this makes his condition
<PB N="113" REF="120"/>
yet more restless and unhappy. We
need not go far to find out the cause
of wars, which make the earth deso∣late,
even those parts of it inhabited
by the professors of Christianity. St
<HI>James,</HI> who puts the question, “From
whence come wars and fightings
among you?” makes answer him∣self
by another question, “Come
they not hence, even of your
lusts?” <HI>Lust</HI> is another word both
for desire and pleasure; so covetous∣ness
is called by St <HI>John,</HI> the <HI>lust of
the eyes.</HI> We blame kings and prin∣ces
for making <HI>Europe</HI> a field of
blood; and no doubt they have the
same passions and follies in common
with the rest of mortals; but allow∣ances
ought to be made them, on ac∣count
of their elevated stations, which
naturally tend to make them giddy;
to say nothing of their education,
which is often very poor: and then
we ought to consider them as besieged
by those who commonly have no∣thing
in view but their own ends, in
<PB N="114" REF="121"/>
the advices they give their superiors
in power and pageantry.</P>
<P>But we ought not to pore upon
the disorders of persons in higher
ranks, whether in the church or state.
The great body of the people must
pay taxes, and groan, without asking
questions. Nor should the disorders
of private life engage too much at∣tention:
it is but a melancholy busi∣ness,
and apt to lead us into a forget∣fulness
of our own personal disorders
and vices, our self-conceit, and blind∣ness
of mind. Humility is enjoined
to the meanest as well as to the great∣est;
and there is sometimes as much
pride under coarse cloaths as in robes
of state. We ought to look at home.
The consequence of pride is to alie∣nate
men from one another, and
from the spirit of religion; as humi∣lity
promotes mutual love, and is the
surest mark of true piety.</P>
<P>Human nature is not yet so cor∣rupted,
as to be without all sense of
moral duties, and even some impres∣sion
of those we owe our Maker:
<PB N="115" REF="122"/>
but this impression, or whatever
it be called, is very faint and im∣perfect;
and we are ready to satisfy
ourselves with a chimerical religion,
and with false hopes in the merits and
redemption of <HI>Christ,</HI> when we have
little or no desire of being renewed
according to his Spirit. This is de∣ceiving
ourselves in the most deplo∣rable
manner. God is not mocked.
Men even see through our disguises.</P>
<P>True humility, which has a loveli∣ness
in it to a well-disposed mind,
does not consist in humble expressions,
(which are very proper in the public
prayers), but in a deep sense of our
unworthiness in the sight of God,
and in doing nothing to get praise
from men. One great point of hu∣mility
is, to yield our own will to that
of others, when justice and good or∣der
suffer nothing by such condescen∣sion.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="116" REF="123"/>
<HEAD>Conscience.</HEAD>
<P>CONSCIENCE is a proof both of
man's dignity and misery: it is the
accuser, witness, and judge; and,
unless true repentance take place, it
is “the worm that dieth not.” Fi∣gures
are often the shortest way of
conveying instruction: our Saviour
made frequent use of them.</P>
<P>The works of God which we see
with our bodily eyes, might make us
conclude, that he is infinite in power,
wisdom, and goodness: and we might
conclude farther, that all praise and
love belong to him of right. Thus
far we might reflect with a certain
joy; and nothing but our stupidity
deprives us of it.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, when con∣science
is awakened, and we get a
sight of our faults, and discover but
a little of our misery and corruption,
we are scarce able to stand it; and
the merciful God seems to be upon
the managment with us, and to spare
us, by discovering no more of our
<PB N="117" REF="124"/>
own nature, or of his, than we can
bear, and make a good use of.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>Repentance.</HEAD>
<P>AN awakened conscience must na∣turally
produce sorrow and remorse,
which are other words for repent∣ance;
but properly it signifies <HI>a
change of mind,</HI> and a purpose of lead∣ing
a new life. Fear and self-interest
often stir first, and may go a good
length in conversion; but a sense of
justice, leading to the love of God,
who is love, would go much farther,
and prove a greater security for all
duties. Preachers may think of it in
their preaching and catechising, in∣stead
of insisting always upon terror.</P>
<P>True repentance and conversion
are much the same; or the one may
be considered as the beginning of the
other; and conviction must go be∣fore
both. Men must fly like crimi∣nals
to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who only waits
for their repentance and humility to
receive them into mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="125"/>
When pride is removed, were it
but for an hour, the soul is not only
humble before God, but free from all
haughtiness towards men, whom it
loves as its brethren, and the images
of God. When pride returns, the
soul relapses into a state of anger,
confusion, folly, and impiety. Re∣pentance
vanishes, till some new touch
or stroke from the wise and merciful
hand of Providence awaken the soul
again out of its lethargy:—What pas∣ses
after death we know not: but
wisdom, abstracting from duty, leaves
as little to that uncertainty as possible.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>Things to be avoided. What to be kept
in view.</HEAD>
<P>HERE again the list must be imper∣fect,
the number of things which are
not counted <HI>sinful,</HI> being so very great.
But then as they proceed from a cor∣rupt
principle, they are really sins
themselves; for example, disputes
about religion, or any subject a man
enters upon to shew his skill and supe∣riority,
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>
which commonly ends in put∣ing
both parties into a heat. Pride
finds its account in such skirmishes.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there may be
no less pride in an obstinate silence,
when it comes from contempt, or the
fear of discovering our own igno∣rance.
Christian simplicity, and a
modest opinion of ourselves, would
direct us how to behave in company
and conversation. To shun bad com∣pany,
is a common, and a sure rule.</P>
<P>Melancholy is much to be avoided;
for it may land in a distrust of the
goodness of God, and be very trou∣blesome
to those we live with, even so
far as to create a bitterness against
them. The sour temper often turns
to wrath, and is quite opposite to that
state of joy recommended in holy
writ: “God reignetl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, let the earth
be glad.” “Rejoice in the Lord
always,” <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, we are in a fallen state,
and “the creation groaneth.” But
we are to call to our relief the pro∣mises
of a happier world, “A new
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
heaven and a new earth, wherein
dwelleth righteousness.” And tho
every thing we hunt after in this life
may be said to have delusion stamped
upon it, yet there are things which
may be called real satisfactions whilst
they last. The pleasures of the low∣est
senses have a reality in them, and
the pleasures of friendship are much
superior. Persons, again, who have
felt the pleasures of religion, do assure
us they infinitely surpass all that can
be conceived.</P>
<P>But the great number of things to
be avoided, either as directly sinful,
or leading to sin, may be judged of
by looking at some of the instructions
of the Apostles, here and there; as
in these words of St <HI>Peter,</HI> “Where∣fore,
laying aside all malice, and
all guile, and hypocrisies, and en∣vies,
and evil-speakings, as new-born
babes desire the sincere milk
of the word, that ye may grow
thereby<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 1. 2.</NOTE>.” And in St <HI>Paul</HI>'s
words to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> “Let all bit∣terness,
<PB N="121" REF="128"/>
and wrath, and anger, and
clamour, and evil-speaking, be put
away from you, with all malice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 31.</NOTE>”
See also the next chapter, towards
the beginning. Here are but a few
passages: many more will be found
in the Old and New Testament, to
teach us both what to shun, and what
we ought to follow. Those who ne∣glect
to “search the scriptures,” will
find their error when it may be too
late to retrieve it.</P>
<P>Our business in this life is, to do as
sick people, who put themselves into
the hands of a skilful physician, who
will infallibly cure them, if they fol∣low
his directions, and take the me∣dicines
he prescribes. Abstinence
from worldly pleasures and <HI>fleshly lusts</HI>
is necessary in our distempered condi∣tion.
Our Saviour has no need of
our <HI>self-denial;</HI> he only injoins the
renouncing the things of this world,
(rotten at best), that they may not fo∣ster
our diseases, and deprive us of
the heavenly joys he has prepared for
<PB N="122" REF="129"/>
us. We are poisoned with self-love,
and blind as to our true happiness,
which he has put us in the way of
obtaining, and given us his blessed ex∣ample
in order to it.</P>
<P>Afflictions are sent us purely for
our own good, like sovereign reme∣dies;
and supposing them ever so ter∣rible,
they are soon at an end. Let us
consider what St <HI>Paul</HI> says of the mat∣ter:
“For our light affliction, which
is but for a moment, worketh for
us a far more exceeding and eter∣nal
weight of glory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 17. 18.</NOTE>.” He adds,
as a necessary qualification, “while
we look not at the things which are
seen, but at the things which are
not seen: for the things which are
seen, are temporal; but the things
which are not seen, are eternal.”</P>
<P>These eternal things are the object
of faith, which in another epistle i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
called “the evidence of things no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
seen<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 1.</NOTE>.” It implies also trust in
God, “(O ye of little faith!),” sub∣mission
to his divine will in all things
<PB N="123" REF="130"/>
and a constant dependence upon it.
<HI>Faith,</HI> in all its acceptations, “is the
gift of God;” and “saving faith”
is that only “which worketh by
love<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 6.</NOTE>.”</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>Attention to the voice of God.</HEAD>
<P>“God is spirit;” therefore to ima∣gine
he has a voice like man were an
absurdity. Many things are expressed
in scripture by signs accommodated to
our weakness and imperfection. This
every body knows and admits. Thun∣der
is called <HI>the voice of God.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes indeed the scripture
makes mention of voices and words
spoken to holy men and prophets:
but this is supposed to be done by the
ministry of angels: and such extraor∣dinary
communications are not to be
desired; for it might proceed from a
desire of being distinguished or exalt∣ed
above the rest of mankind; and
the reward of such pride might justly
be delusion.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="131"/>
The voice of God is addressed to
the soul of every person, (what high∣er
privilege can be imagined!), and
nothing but want of attention hinders
it from being heard and obeyed.</P>
<P>Sinners are required in scripture,
“to return to their heart;” to “en∣ter
into themselves,” and the like;
which is the same with hearkening to
the conscience. And hence it is that
we find such mention of the <HI>inner
man,—the inward parts,—the hidden
man of the heart,—the inward man;</HI>—all
which are but different expressions
of the same thing, called by spiritual
authors <HI>the interior,</HI> and sometimes
<HI>the centre of the soul</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This term is understood of the innermost
part, or what is properly <HI>divine</HI> in man, and
to which the eternal Spirit alone has acccss.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to our want of attention, it
comes from numberless sources: the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ursuit of riches, pleasure, bare di∣version,
or amusement, to say no∣thing
of fame or glory, all these are
great hinderances to attention. It is
true, the great body of the people
<PB N="125" REF="132"/>
have fewer things to hunt after than
those in higher stations; but every
class of mortals, or rather every indi∣vidual
person, hath his pursuits and
distractions, by which the mind is
drawn off from the consideration of
its duty and eternal happiness. The
poorest have their projects and their
diversions, and are as much given to
shew and luxury (generally speaking)
as they can afford.</P>
<P>It may be said, the number of dis∣tractions
that hinder our attention is
next to infinite. How many cares!
how many passions! how many whims!
and how many wild imaginations,
which may be looked upon as a
particular distemper, and to which
those who are idle are the most
liable! Some imaginations are ridi∣culous
to the last degree, others are
horrid. Honest labour, what a hap∣piness
it is! A wandering imagina∣tion
is often a heavy cross.</P>
<P>Involuntary imaginations are not
indeed criminal; they come into the
head like the dreams of the night;
<PB N="126" REF="133"/>
and it is not in the power of reason
to thrust them out; or they return
very soon to the attack. The crimi∣nal
imaginations are such as rise from
the corrupt inclinations, and may be
said to have their root in the heart;
they spring from the desire of sensual
pleasure, or riches, or command, or
praise; and by fostering these our
desires, (especially that of praise and
esteem), we take sancies of our own
worth and excellency, and imagine we
are admired when we are laughed at.</P>
<P>What shall deliver us from this
state of folly, and slavery, and sin?
Nothing but the sovereign power of
God. It is true, we have the power
of <HI>asking,</HI> and it is promsed we shall
<HI>obtain;</HI> but it is with the condition
that we do not ask <HI>amiss.</HI></P>
<P>To prayer we are to join watch∣fulness,
which is the same with at∣tention.
We hear also of <HI>recollection,</HI>
which signifies the <HI>gathering in</HI> the
scattered affections of the heart, as
well as our wandering imaginations,
that our love may be fixed upon the
<PB N="127" REF="134"/>
only object worthy thereof. If the
heart were in good order, the head
would grow wiser of course. Invo∣luntary
imaginations might contribute
to humble our vanity.</P>
<P>One great error, which argues the
bad state of our mind, and our folly,
is our being in such a dread of cen∣sure;
so that we may rather be said
to give attention to the voice of men
than to the voice of God! That this
infirmity has its root in our pride is
very plain.</P>
<P>But recollection being a thing so
little understood by the generality of
people, it may not be unnecessary to
add a few lines more about it. Re∣collection,
then, is that disposition
we must be in for hearkening to God.
He speaks to the heart, by giving it
good inclinations or motions. He
speaks to the understanding, by ma∣king
discoveries of his divine nature,
and the nature of man. Common
reason may be called <HI>the voice of
God.</HI> The beautiful order and pro∣ductions
of the creation strike us;
<PB N="128" REF="135"/>
and what we see and feel of the im∣perfect
state of things, is a sort of
speaking too, and designed to wean
our hearts from earthly satisfactions.
Great attention is necessary, that when
we find our affections out of order,
(which we may find in the beginning,
when they are not too strong), we
may strive to turn them away, and
apply them to lawful objects. Rea∣son
would be of service to shew the
emptiness and trouble of all worldly
pursuits, which would be well sup∣ported
by experience. But chiefly,
if the love of God were kindled in
the heart, it would consume all im∣purity,
and put an end to all disorder.</P>
<P>If, after all the care we can take,
and all the attention we can give, we
find ourselves still haunted and perse∣cuted
by the involuntary imaginations
already mentioned; the advice given
by persons of experience in the spi∣ritual
life is, to contemn those imper∣tinent
intruders, like the buzzing of
flies, and not to be discouraged by
them, since nothing involuntary is
<PB N="129" REF="136"/>
sinful. No doubt we ought to a∣bridge
our diversions, and even our
business, as much as possible, that so
our heads may not be silled with the
things we have been employed about,
or new images raised by some connec∣tion
with them, or (which is often
the case) without any connection.</P>
<P>But that recollection is no less the
business of the heart than of the head,
(or rather, that it chiefly belongs to
the heart), is evident from these
words of <HI>Solomon,</HI> “Keep thy heart
with all diligence, for out of it are
the issues of life.” And by keep∣ing
the heart is not only meant being
on our guard against our desires and
appetites, but likewise against personal
aversions, which would prevent all
transports of anger, nay, the least ap∣proach
of ill humour.</P>
<P>To do all our actions as in the pre∣sence
of God, (from whom nothing
is hid), and with the design of plea∣sing
him, (which justice requires), is
the best state the heart can be in; it
is called <HI>the presence of God,</HI> as well as
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
<HI>recollection,</HI> the mind being <HI>habitually</HI>
in a state of attention to the divine
will. Nor is there any fear of negli∣gence,
or doing our work the wrong
way; for we are not to let things
drop out of our hands. Diligence
and exactness is even a part of reli∣gion,
when that principle takes place,
(injoined by St <HI>Paul</HI>), “to do all
things to the glory of God.”</P>
<P>Such an attentive good disposition
of soul also gets the name of <HI>prayer:</HI>
for the command, <HI>to pray always,</HI>
cannot be meant either of vocal
prayer, or of meditation; and there∣fore
is only to be understood of the
internal frame of the heart, or <HI>inward
man.</HI> Such a state in scripture is call∣ed
<HI>walking with God.</HI></P>
<P>Outward helps are by no means to
be neglected. The public meetings
of devotion are to be frequented, and
at several times of the day (when ne∣cessary
business can allow) a pious
book may be looked at, were it but a
few lines; and even in the fields, or
within doors, at any labour, a peti∣tion
<PB N="131" REF="138"/>
may be put up, whether in
words or silently, since God regards
the heart only. A well-disposed heart
or spirit can find a thousand ways of
expressing itself to the Father of spi∣rits,
in prayers or praises, without
study or restraint. The meanest of
the works of nature, were it but a
straw, is matter of adoration; and we
have a large field for supplication,
when we consider all our wants, and
the hazards we run, especially that of
forfeiting the happiness designed for
us in the next life. As all the attri∣butes
of God are infinite, so is his
condescension: he suffers children to
speak to him, and delights in true
simplicity.</P>
<P>But, as is said already, if all the
care we can take is not sufficient to
rid us of these pitiful imaginations, but
that they plague us even in the time
we set apart for prayer and retire∣ment,
we should bear them as the
punishment of our past errors and
vices, remaining united to God in
heart and in will, which no power in
<PB N="132" REF="139"/>
nature can force. By this conduct
our distractions and absurd fancies
blow over the sooner.</P>
<P>If it be asked, why people of all
ranks, that are plunged in worldly
business, either for necessary subsist∣ence,
or for gratifying their pride,
and all their desires, complain so little
of being disturbed with such foolish
imaginations? the answer is, that the
generality of the world seldom apply
their mind to any thing but for their
own pleasure in some form or other;
and so they cannot be sensible of the
imaginations that break in upon those
few that set their affections <HI>on things a∣bove,</HI>
and earnestly desire to please God.
If such imaginations are cast in by the
devil, (as it is commonly thought
they are), he does not want to disturb
the fancy whilst he is in possession of
the heart; or if they are only the na∣tural
effect of our disorder since the
fall, it may please God to let them
tyrannize over us for our purification,
and as an antidote to our pride. The
blessed God wants not to disturb us,
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
much less to destroy us. Our happi∣ness
is his great aim; and in the or∣der
of things, purification must go
before happiness; for “no impure
thing can enter into the kingdom
of heaven.” What distress of all
kinds and degrees must be undergone
before the soul can attain to that ne∣cessary
purity or holiness, is as impos∣sible
to conceive, as the joy that waits it
through all eternity.</P>

<P><HI>Question.</HI> WHAT is man's chief
good and happiness?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> It is to have God to be his
God, and his only ruler and governor.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why call you that his chief good
and happiness?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because God is the chief good in
himself, and the cause of all good and
happiness, in every soul that is entirely
ruled and governed by him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is man's greatest evil and
misery?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is to set up self, as an idol, in
God's room, to be ruled and governed
by it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="143"/>
<HI>Q.</HI> Why call you that his greatest evil
and misery?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because the setting up self in
God's room is the greatest evil and in∣justice
in itself, and the cause of all o∣ther
evils and miseries whatsoever.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Who was the first author of this e∣vil
and injustice?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The devil and his angels, who
infected our first parents, and in them
all their posterity, with this horrible
corruption.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Has this corruption entered deep
into man's nature?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It has entered so deep, that the
very life and being of his nature, as it
is corrupted, is nothing else but self-will,
self-love, self-interest, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> inso∣much
that naturally he neither re∣gards
God, or his fellow-creatures, any
further than as they may serve as a
means to please or advance this idol self.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the three universal sins
wherewith this idol has corrupted man's
nature?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Covetousness, sensuality, and pride.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> By what other names are they
called?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are called, the lust of the
eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the
<PB N="5" REF="144"/>
pride of life; or, the love of riches,
pleasures, and honours; or, self-inte∣rest,
self-pleasing, and self-esteem.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the fruits which these
sins produce in mens lives and conversa∣tions?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They produce all the vices and
crimes which too much abound every
where in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Into what estate is mankind redu∣ced
by this abominable idol self, and its
cursed fruits?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Mankind is thereby naturally re∣duced
into a state of banishment from
God and all good; and of a miserable
slavery and captivity, under the power
of the devil, and of all evil.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What was necessarily required to
the redeeming of mankind from such a
miserable state?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It was necessary that the injury
and dishonour done to God, by setting
up such a vile unworthy idol in his
room, should be repaired; as also, that
the idol itself should be so broken down,
and cast our, as it might never again u∣surp
the throne of God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was it in the power of man to per∣form
both these conditions?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> So far from it, that no less power
<PB N="6" REF="145"/>
than omnipotency itself was necessary
to perform either the one or the other
of them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Has any one then been willing to
undertake, and able to perform so great a
work?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes indeed, the Lord Jesus Christ,
the eternal Son of God, true God and
true man. He alone is the Saviour of
the world, and the Redeemer of man∣kind;
who is both able and willing to
save to the utmost all that come to God
through him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What moved him to undertake so
great a work and labour?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> His great love to his Father's
glory, and his great pity and compas∣sion
for lost mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What did Jesus, in order to repair
the dishonour done to God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because man had dishonoured
God, by leaving the lowest and last
place, which was due to him, and u∣surping
the first and chief place, which
belonged to God; therefore, to make
satisfaction and reparation, the Son of
God left the throne of his glory, the
first and chief place due to him; and
taking our nature upon him, he de∣scended
into the lowest and last place,
<PB N="7" REF="146"/>
even into the room and place of sin∣ners.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What further satisfaction and re∣paration
made he, when he had put him∣self
in the place of sinners?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He meekly submitted himself to
all the poverty, contempt, and suffer∣ings,
which were due to them; and al∣ways
honoured his heavenly Father
with an obedience and humility, which
was more boundless and unlimited than
was the pride and disobedience where∣with
man had dishonoured him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What was the most admirable in∣stance
of the obedience, humility, and
charity of the Son of God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> His offering up himself a sacrifice
upon the cross, in the deepest humilia∣tions
and sufferings both of soul and
body.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was this sacrifice acceptable, satis∣fying,
and meritorious, in the sight of his
heavenly Father?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It was so acceptable, satisfying,
and meritorious, that his heavenly Fa∣ther
found his justice thereby not only
satisfied, but likewise indebted to his
dear Son; and that he was obliged to
grant him, in favour of mankind, whom
he so much loved, all grace and glory,
<PB N="8" REF="147"/>
and every good thing that he desired
for them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is it necessary, besides making sa∣tis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>faction
and reparation, that Iesus
should cast forth the idol self, with its
corrupt fruits, out of our hearts, before
we can enjoy the heavenly glory which he
has merited for us?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is so absolutely necessary, that
neither the mercies of God, nor the
merits of Jesus Christ, shall ever bring
us to the heavenly glory, till first this
great work be effectually begun in our
souls, and also thereafter carried on
and finished by the power of our Re∣deemer.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How does our dear Redeemer most
usually begin this work in the soul?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By awakening the conscience
with a sight and sense of its grosser sins
and vices, and with the fear of hell∣torments,
which are due to them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What must necessarily accompany
or follow after this?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A firm belief of God's mercy in
Christ Jesus, to all them that truly re∣pent
of their sins, and forsake them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What effects do both these produce
in the soul?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> An earnest striving and wrestling
<PB N="9" REF="148"/>
against its grosser sins, with a diligent
use of such means and mortifications as
may help it to be victorious over them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Doth the soul, in this state, usual∣ly
make any considerable progress and ad∣vancement?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Although sometimes it may seem
to itself to make considerable progress,
yet really it advances but little, so long
as its inward corruptions, its inward
pride, covetousness, and sensuality, which
are the root of its outward sins, do still
continue in their strength and vigour.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Where can the soul find a proper
and an effectual remedy to purge out these
inward corruptions?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Only in the Lord Jesus Christ, in
his life and doctrine, and in his death
upon the cross.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are those remedies which are
to be found there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the life and doctrine of the
Son of God, and in his death upon the
cross, there are abundance of humilia∣tions,
reproaches, and contempt, to pull
down our pride; of poverty, naked∣ness,
and disengagement, to purge out
our covetousness; and of labours, pains,
and sufferings, to mortify our love of
ease and pleasures.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="149"/>
<HI>Q.</HI> Is it necessary that the soul do truly
love and esteem these things, and willing∣ly
embrace them, whenever it pleases God
to send them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> However the inferior sensual part
of the soul may grieve and be afflicted,
yet the superior part must truly love
and esteem them, and willingly embrace
them; else it cannot follow Jesus
Christ, nor can the love of riches, ho∣nours,
and pleasures, be truly purged out.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is the soul enabled and pre∣vailed
with to take so bitter a medicine?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the divine light which it re∣ceives
from Jesus Christ, and which en∣lightens
it in some measure to know it∣self
and the world, and to know God,
and to know Jesus the Mediator.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What does the soul see itself and the
world to be, in the divine light?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the divine light it sees itself to
be nothing but misery and sin, and that
it has truly deserved hell; as also it
sees the riches, honours, and pleasures,
of the world, whereby it has been de∣luded,
to be but mere empty shadows:
and both these make it despise the
world, and hate itself.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What does the soul discover of God,
in the divine light?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="150"/>
<HI>A.</HI> In the divine light, the soul sees
God to be all infinite goodness, love,
beauty, and excellency, and that all its
happiness is in him; which makes the
soul hunger and thirst, and pant and
breathe after him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What does the soul, in the divine
light, discover of Jesus the Mediator?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It discovers that Jesus is the true
and only way to the Father; and that
there is no other way but his poverty,
contempt, and sufferings, to cast out
man's covetousness, pride, and sensuali∣ty;
and also that his love to man is
boundless and astonishing, in walking
so willingly before him in the way of
the cross, to bring him unto God: all
which constrain the soul to love Jesus,
and cordially to embrace his doctrine
and example of the cross, as being the
only way to its own happiness in God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> When the soul has thus been enabled,
by the divine light, to despise the world
and hate itself, to love God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rnest∣ly
desire him, and to embrace Christ and
his cross, as the only way to the Father,
is there any thing further necessary for it
to do?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, it must, by the divine grace,
apply all its vigour and activity to per∣severe
<PB N="12" REF="151"/>
and continue stedfastly in these
and such like exercises; till all its acti∣vity
being much spent and exhausted,
it does at length, by degrees, enter in∣to
the passive state.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Wherein consists the nature of this
passive state?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It consists in patiently bearing the
operations, and quietly following the
motions and attractions of the divine
grace, which now are felt, and percei∣ved
very sensibly in it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the exercise, or disposition
of the soul, in this passive state?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is to take all its pleasure and
contentment in abiding in God's pre∣sence,
in depending upon him, and lea∣ving
itself entirely to his disposal, as a
continual sacrifice to his holy will.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the fruits and effects of
this state in the soul?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It does more effectually subdue
and cast out the carnal worldly self,
with its inward corruptions, and gives
the soul a more complete and easy vic∣tory
over its sins and imperfections, and
makes it flourish very sensibly in faith,
hope, and charity, in humility, meek∣ness,
patience, resignation, and all o∣ther
Christian graces and virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="152"/>
<HI>Q.</HI> Has such a soul any thing more to
do, but to continue and advance in all
these graces and virtues?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Its activity having been already
spent, it has not much to do; but it has
much to suffer, and a more terrible pu∣rification
to undergo than ever it had be∣fore.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why so?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because in the midst of these sen∣sible
divine graces and virtues, there
grows up a secret, spiritual, refined,
subtle self, which, if God did not pre∣vent
it, would at length become more
destructive to the soul, and more dis∣pleasing
unto him, than the former
gross carnal idol was.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Wherein consists the malignity of
this spiritual self?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In robbing God of his glory, by
appropriating to itself the graces and
virtues which belong to him; and by a
secret spiritual pride, taking compla∣cency
in its own excellency.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Into what state would this spiri∣tual
self bring the soul, if God continue
to multiply his sensible graces therein?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By degrees, into the state of Lu∣cifer,
who was adorned with more re∣splendent
graces than any man on
<PB N="14" REF="153"/>
earth can be; and yet, by this proud
spiritual self, he became a devil.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is the soul able, by its own dili∣gence
and activity, to destroy this mon∣ster?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This monster is so voracious, so
secret, and so subtle, that there is not
any thing which the soul can do, by its
own activity, to destroy it, but what it
feeds upon, and nourishes and strength∣ens
itself thereby.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Who then can destroy it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God alone.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> By what means doth God most u∣sually
destroy that terrible monster?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By letting loose the most grievous
temptations, and withdrawing all his
sensible graces from the soul, and sur∣rounding
it on all hands with darkness
and troubles; whereby it is reduced to
the greatest agonies and straits.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Are these agonies soon over?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the former states, the soul
had many changes or vicissitudes, of
light and darkness, of temptations and
consolations, of painful aridities and
sensible joys: but in these last trials,
the grievous temptations and agonies
do still increase, and are never ended,
if the soul be of any competent strength
<PB N="15" REF="154"/>
to bear them, till it be utterly lost, and
perish, as to its own apprehension.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> For what end is the soul brought to
such a terrible state?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That it may learn to be sacrifi∣ced,
absolutely, without any reserve,
to the will and order of God, even
with respect to grace, virtue, salvation,
eternity, as well as to all temporal
things; that so all self, both spiritual
and carnal, may be wholly rooted out,
and annihilated in the soul.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> When self is thus reduced to no∣thing
in the soul, what then becomes of
it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> When self is really reduced to
nothing, which is the only place that
of right belongs to it, then Jesus takes
possession of his right, and by degrees
becomes all in the soul: so that no
more self-righteousness, self-interest,
self-will, or any thing of self, is to be
found in it; but only the righteousness,
the interest, the will, and the all of
Jesus.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are some of the principal
characters or dispositions of that soul
wherein Jesus has recovered the full do∣minion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A profound peace, a pure disin∣terested
<PB N="16" REF="155"/>
love, and also a child-like in∣nocency
and simplicity, whereby the
soul, for its own safety, is usually kept
from any certain knowledge of its own
happy state.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is Jesus then the only Lord and
King of that soul, who rules and governs
it absolutely, according to his own will,
without any opposition?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, indeed; which as it is man's
greatest happiness in this life, so it is
the great end and design of the Chri∣stian
religion, and all that seems to be
necessary to prepare the soul, and make
it ready for the immediate enjoyment
of the heavenly glory.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What means must we make use of,
whereby we may attain to this great end
and design of the Christian religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That we may attain to this great
end, we must make use both of the in∣ternal
and external means.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the most effectual inter∣nal
means?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are, the inward graces of
repentance, faith, and the prayer of
the heart.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is repentance?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is such a true sorrow for our
sins, as makes us embrace the means,
<PB N="17" REF="156"/>
how bitter or painful soever they may
be, to extirpate them, and to repair
the wrongs we have done by them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what use is repentance for help∣ing
us forward to the great end of our
Christianity?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is of absolute necessity, for a∣mending,
and obtaining pardon of all
the sins and faults that are committed
through the whole Christian course;
but more especially in the beginning of
it, when the sinner breaks off his sins
and evil habits, and returns to God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is faith?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is the evidence of things not
seen, even of the all of God, and of
the nothing of the creature; whereby
the soul, which receives that evidence,
believes in God, and puts all its trust
and confidence in him alone, and not
in the creature, or in any thing that it
can do.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the most native and imme∣diate
effect of this faith?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The greater and stronger that
this faith is, the more it engages God
to take the soul into his own particular
care, conduct, and protection; and al∣so
it makes the soul the more pliable,
submissive, resigned, and abandoned to
<PB N="18" REF="157"/>
the divine will and conduct in all
things.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what use is faith for assisting
us to attain unto the great end and design
of our holy religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is of absolute necessity, for dis∣engaging
the soul from the creatures,
and uniting it to God; and for guiding
and leading it safely into that divine
union, through all the dangers, delu∣sions,
and temptations, wherewith the
devil, the world, and our own corrup∣tion
do continually assault us, in all
the different periods of our Christian
course; but more especially in the last
trials, when the soul can see nothing
but death and darkness on all hands.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the prayer of the heart?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is an inward conversation, or
communication betwixt God and the
soul, wherein the soul, conformably to
the state it is in, offers up to God its
desires, or aspirations, or affections;
or simply exposes itself before him, lea∣ving
itself wholly to his will: And
wherein God corresponds accordingly,
by communicating his graces and fa∣vours
to the soul, as he sees most expe∣dient
for it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what use then is vocal prayer?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="158"/>
<HI>A.</HI> It is of most necessary use, not
only in the public worship, but also in
the most private retirements, whenever
it may serve as a means to fix our atten∣tion,
or assist us in the inward devotion
and prayer of the heart.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what use is prayer for advan∣cing
us to the great end of our religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is of such necessary use from
the beginning to the end of the Christian
course, that the soul's advancement de∣pends
on its fidelity therein; so that
whoever neglects prayer can never make
any considerable progress in the Chri∣stian
life.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the most effectual exter∣nal
means whereby we may attain to the
great end of our religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The most effectual external means
are, the holy scriptures, the sacra∣ments,
and the other offices of the sa∣cred
order of pastors.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How does it appear that the holy
scriptures are a most effectual means to
bring us to the great end of our religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It appears in this, that as the
holy scriptures are all written by divine
inspiration, so they do all tend to hum∣ble
man and exalt God, and to turn
man away from self-love and the love
<PB N="20" REF="159"/>
of the creatures, unto the love of God;
and do contain inexhaustible treasures
of divine light and wisdom, all contri∣buting
to that end.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How ought we to read and study
the scriptures, so as to profit by them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> With an earnest desire to know
God's will, for no other end but that
we may practise it; and with a humble
heart, depending on God for giving us
the understanding of them, so far as he
sees it necessary for that end.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Wherein are the sacraments useful
to us, for our attaining to the great end
of religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are most useful and neces∣sary,
because the awfulness and solemni∣ty
of the mysteries which are celebra∣ted
in them, do serve to awaken us from
our dulness and stupidity, and to raise
up our hearts to God; and because, in
the due use of them, we are solemnly
engaged to our duty, and singularly
assisted to perform it, by the plentiful
effusion of the divine grace upon all
those who with humble and obedient
hearts observe these divine ordinances.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the evil of despising, or
wilfully neglecting the sacraments?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Whoever despises, or wilfully ne∣glects
<PB N="21" REF="160"/>
these holy ordinances, he not on∣ly
deprives himself of the spiritual be∣nefits
and inward graces, which always
accompany the humble and pious use of
them, but also he thereby ranks him∣self
even amongst the infidels, in that
he will not make use of the outward vi∣sible
signs and symbols ordained by
Christ himself, to separate and distin∣guish
betwixt his disciples and all o∣thers;
and that he will not confess him
before men, nor own him to be his
Lord and King, in that solemn sacred
manner which he himself hath appoint∣ed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Of what use are the other offices
to us, of the sacred order of pastors?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Of such singular use, that nothing
more effectual could be done for us, than
to appoint an order of men to feed us
with Christ's doctrine, and to walk be∣fore
us in his steps; and so to teach us,
both by word and deed, how we may
die to ourselves and to the creatures,
that God alone may live and reign in
us. And although some may fail in
their duty, yet we have the pious la∣bours,
writings, and examples, of o∣ther
faithful pastors, which are still of
singular use and advantage to us.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="161"/>
<HI>Q.</HI> Are there any general means, com∣mon
to all mankind, for assisting them to
attain to the great end and design of
[the Christian and] all true religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, there are the works of cre∣ation
and providence outwardly; and
also an inward remainder of the image
of God, which, by the merits and in∣tercession
of Jesus Christ, is continued
with all mankind, as an inward seed or
principle of grace, in the midst of their
corruption.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What are the fruits and effects of
this good principle, in the hearts and lives
of men?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The more that the good motions
thereof, in opposition to the motions of
corruption, are followed and obeyed, it
becomes the stronger, and God com∣municates
his blessing to it, whereby it
has become the spring and fountain of
many good things in the works and wri∣tings
of the heathens: but the more
its motions are rejected, and those of
corruption followed and obeyed, this
good principle becomes the more lan∣guid
and imperceptible, and sometimes
seems to be utterly extinguished.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Wherein do the works of creation
and providence serve men as a means
<PB N="23" REF="162"/>
whereby they may attain to the end of all
true religion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In setting plainly before mens
eyes the greatness and goodness of God,
and the nothingness of man; that his
very soul and body, and all the good
he has, are God's creatures, and do
belong to him; and that therefore he
ought not to rob God, by ascribing or
appropriating any of these things to
himself, but abide in an entire naked∣ness
and poverty of spirit before him,
leaving himself and all he hath in God's
hands, to be disposed of, and ruled and
governed by him, without any opposi∣tion,
as being the only rightful Lord and
King, and true proprietor of all things.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why then might not a Heathen be
sauved by the means of these plain truths,
searched out, and followed by the good
principle of the divine grace within him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> How plain soever these truths
may be in themselves, yet all men are
so blinded with self-love, and the love
of the world, that even amongst those
who have the light of the scriptures,
and the doctrine and example of Jesus
Christ to guide them, there are but few
who penetrate these truths so fully as
they ought to do, and still fewer who
<PB N="24" REF="163"/>
practise them: Therefore it is not to be
supposed that any amongst the Heathen,
who have none to guide them, can en∣ter
into these truths; or if any did, and
practised accordingly, it is not to be
doubted but God would communicate
himself unto them, and save them by
the grace and merits of his Son, even
as he saved the patriarchs, and others
his servants of old, before the scriptures
were written.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Alas, then, if there he so few every
where, who enter into these great and
necessary truths, what shall become of
mankind! Is it not to be feared that
self and the world shall, in a short time,
have dominion over the hearts of all men
living on the earth?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the worst of times God had,
and always will have some to serve
him; and although the greatest a∣bounding
of all evil is foretold to be in
the last days, yet the greatest abound∣ing
of all good is foretold to follow af∣ter
it: for as in the purification of the
soul, the darkest night of trials and
temptations goes before the brightest
day of divine peace; so, in the church,
and in the world in general, after the
greatest disorders and corruptions, shall
<PB N="25" REF="164"/>
follow the greatest purity and order.
Righteousness, truth, and peace shall
flourish; Satan shall be bound, and cast
out; and JESUS shall be absolute Lord
and King in the hearts of all men.</P>
<P>Even so, Lord Jesus, come quickly. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
