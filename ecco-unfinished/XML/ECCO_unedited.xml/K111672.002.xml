<HEAD>LESSONS
FOR CHILDREN,
OF THREE YEARS OLD.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES, what a cle∣ver
thing it is to read!
A little while ago, you know,
you could only read little
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
words; and you were forced
to spell them c—a—t, cat;
d—o—g, dog. Now you can
read pretty stories, and I am
going to write you some.</P>
<P>Do you know why you
are better than Pufs? Puss
can play as well as you; and
Puss can drink milk, and lie
upon the carpet; and she
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
can run as fast as you, and
faster too, a great deal; and
she can climb trees better;
and she can catch mice,
which you cannot do. But
can Puss talk? No. Can
Puss read? No. Then that
is the reason why you are
better than Puss—because
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
you can talk and read. Can
Pierrot, your dog, read?
No. Will you teach him?
Take the pin and point to
the words. No—he will not
learn. I never saw a little
dog or cat learn to read.
But little boys can learn. If
you do not learn, Charles,
you are not good for half as
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
much as a Puss. You had
better be drowned.</P>
<P>What a clock is it,
Charles? it is twelve o'clock.
It is noon. Come in the
garden then. Now where is
the sun? Turn your face to∣wards
him. Look at the sun.
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
That is South; always when
it is twelve o'clock, and
you look at the sun, your
face is towards the South.
Now turn to your left hand.
Look forwards. That is
East. In the morning, when
it is going to be light, you
must look just there, and
presently you will see the
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
sun get up. Always in the
morning look there for the
sun; for the sun rises in the
East. Now turn your back
to the sun. Look straight
forwards. That is North.
Now turn to your left hand.
Look forwards. That is
West. When you have had
your supper, and it is going
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
to be night, look for the sun
just there. He is always
there when he goes to bed;
for the sun sets in the West.
North, South, East, West.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
The wind blows. Which
way does the wind blow?
Take out your handkerchief.
Throw it up. The wind
blows it this way. The
wind comes from the north.
The wind is north. It is a
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
cold wind. The wind was
west yesterday, then it was
warm.</P>
<P>Rain comes from the
clouds. Look, there are
black clouds. How fast they
move along! Now they
have hid the sun. They
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
have covered up the sun,
just as you cover up your
face when you throw a hand∣kerchief
over it. There is
a little bit of blue sky still.
Now there is no blue sky at
all: it is all black with the
clouds. It is very dark,
like night. It will rain soon.
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Now it begins. What large
drops! The ducks are very
glad, but the little birds are
not glad; they go and shel∣ter
themselves under the
trees. Now the rain is over.
It was only a shower. Now
the flowers smell sweet, and
the sun shines, and the little
birds sing again, and it is
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
not so hot as it was before
it rained.</P>
<P>We will drink tea out of
doors. Bring the tea-things.
Come, fetch your hat. It
is very pleasant. But here
is no table. What must we
do? O, here is a large round
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
stump of a tree, it will do
very well for a table. But we
have no chairs. Here is a
seat of turf, and a bank al∣most
covered with violets;
we shall sit here, and you
and Billy may lie on the
carpet. The carpet is in
the parlour. Yes, there is a
carpet in the parlour, but
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
there is a carpet here too.
What is it? The grass is
the carpet out of doors.
Pretty green soft carpet! and
it is very large, for it spreads
every where, over all the
fields, and over all the mea∣dows:
and it is very plea∣sant
for the sheep and the
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
lambs to lie down upon. I
do not know what they
would do without it, for
they have no feather bed to
sleep upon.</P>
<P>It is a pleasant evening.
Come hither, Charles, look
at the sun. The sun is in
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
the West. Yes, because he
is going to set. How pretty
the sun looks! We can
look at him now; he is not
so bright as he was at dinner∣time,
when he was up high
in the sky. And how beau∣tiful
the clouds are! There
are crimson clouds, and
purple and gold-coloured
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
clouds. Now the sun is go∣ing
down down a great pace.
Now we can see only half
of him. Now we cannot
see him at all. Farewell, sun!
till to morrow morning.</P>
<P>But now, Charles, turn
your face the other way,
to the East. What is it
that shines so behind the
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
trees? Is it a fire? No,
it is the moon. It is very
large; and how red it is!
like blood. The moon is
round now, because it is full
moon; but it will not be
so round tomorrow night;
it will lose a little bit: and
the next night it will lose a
little bit more; and more
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
the next night; and so on,
till it is like your bow when
it is bent: and it will not be
seen till after you are in bed:
and it will grow less and less,
till in a fortnight there will
be no moon at all. Then,
after that, there will be a
new moon; and you will
see it in the afternoon; and
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
it will be very very thin at
first, but it will grow rounder
and bigger every day, till at
last, in another fortnight, it
will be a full moon again like
this, and you will see it rise
again behind the trees.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Do you know what rai∣sins
are? They are grapes
dried a great deal. Grapes,
you know, grow upon vines;
but raisins are made of larg∣er
grapes than those upon
the vine in the garden: they
come from a great way off.
Do you know what sugar
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
comes from? Sugar comes
from a cane like a walking∣stick,
that grows in the
ground; they squeeze the
juice out, and boil it a great
deal, and that makes sugar.
And what is tea? Tea is a
leaf that grows upon a shrub,
and that is dried a great deal.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Charles wants some bread
and butter—But the bread
is not baked. Then bid
Christopher Clump heat his
oven and bake it—But the
loaf is not kneaded. Then
bid little Margery take the
dough and knead it—But the
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
slour is not ground. Then
take it to the mill, and bid
Roger the miller grind it
—But the corn is not thresh∣ed.
Then bid John Dobbins
take his flail and thresh it—But
the corn is not reaped.
Then bid Dick Clodpole
take his sickle and cut it—
But the wheat is not sown.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
Then bid Farmer Diggory
take the seed and sow it—
But the field is not ploughed.
Then bid Ralph Wiseacre
take the horses and plough
it—But the plough is not
made. Then go to Hum∣phrey
Hiccory the carpenter,
and bid him make one—But
there is never a plough-share.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28"/>
Then bid Firebrass the smith
go to his anvil and beat one.
—But we have no butter.
Then go to market, Susan,
and buy some. But the but∣ter
is not churned. Then
take your churn, Dolly, and
churn some—But the cow
is not milked. Then take
your pail, Cicely, and milk
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
it—Now, Betty, pray spread
Charles a slice of bread and
butter.</P>
<P>Charles, do not you re∣member
the caterpillar we
put into a paper box, with
some mulberry leaves for it
to eat? Let us go and look
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
at it. It is gone—here is no
caterpillar—there is some∣thing
in the box; what is
it? I do not know. It is
a little ball of yellow stuff.
Let us cut it open, perhaps
we may find the caterpillar.
No, here is nothing but a
strange little grub, and it is
dead, I believe, for it does
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
not move. Pinch it gently
by the tail. Now it stirs:
it is not dead quite. Charles,
this grub is your caterpillar;
it is indeed. That yellow
stuff is silk. The caterpillar
spun all that silk, and cover∣ed
itself up with it; and then
it was turned into this grub.
Take it, and lay it in the
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
sun; we will come and look
at it again to morrow morn∣ing
—Well, this is very sur∣prising!
here is no grub at
all to be found. Did not we
put it on this sheet of paper
last night? Yes we did.
And no body has been in
the room to meddle with it?
No, no body at all has been
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
in the room. Is there no∣thing
upon the sheet of pa∣per?
Yes, here is a white
butterfly. I wonder how it
came here; for the windows
are shut. Perhaps the grub
is turned into a butterfly.
It is, indeed; and look, here
is the empty shell of the
grub. Here is where the
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
butterfly came out. But the
butterfly is too big; this
shell could not hold him.
Yes, it did, because his
wings were folded up, and
he lay very snug. It is the
same, I assure you, Charles;
all the pretty butterflies that
you see flying about were
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
caterpillars once, and crawl∣ed
on the ground.</P>
<P>Charles, you must not go
out into the fields by your∣self,
nor without leave.
You are a very little boy,
you know; and if you were
to venture out by yourself
you would be lost; then you
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
would cry, and night would
come, and it would be dark,
and you could not find your
way home, and you would
have no bed; you would be
forced to lie down in the
fields upon the wet cold
grass, and perhaps you would
die, and that would be a
sad tale to tell.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37"/>
I will tell you a story a∣bout
a lamb. There was
once a Shepherd, who had
a great many sheep and lambs.
He took a great deal of care
of them, and gave them
sweet fresh grass to eat, and
clear water to drink; and if
they were sick he was very
good to them; and when
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
they climbed up a steep hill
and the lambs were tired, he
used to carry them in his
arms; and when they were
all eating their suppers in the
field he used to sit upon a
stile, and play them a tune,
and sing to them; and so
they were the happiest sheep
and lambs in the whole world.
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
But every night this Shep∣herd
used to pen them up
in a fold. Do you know
what a sheep-fold is? Well,
I will tell you. It is a place
like the court; but instead
of pales there are hurdles,
which are made of sticks that
will bend, such as osier twigs;
and they are twisted and
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
made very fast, so that no∣thing
can creep in, and no∣thing
can get out. Well, and
so every night when it grew
dark and cold, the Shepherd
called all his flock, sheep
and lambs, together, and
drove them into the fold,
and penned them up, and
there they lay as snug and
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
warm and comfortable as
could be, and nothing could
get in to hurt them, and the
dogs lay round on the out∣side
to guard them, and to
bark if any body came near;
and in the morning the Shep∣herd
unpenned the fold, and
let them all out again.</P>
<P>Now they were all very
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
happy, as I told you, and
loved the Shepherd dearly,
that was so good to them—all
except one foolish little
lamb. And this lamb did
not like to be shut up every
night in the fold; and she
came to her mother, who
was a wise old sheep, and
said to her, I wonder why
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
we are shut up so every night!
the dogs are not shut up,
and why should we be shut
up? I think it is very hard,
and I will get away if I can,
I am resolved, for I like to
run about where I please,
and I think it is very plea∣sant
in the woods by moon∣light—Then
the old sheep
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
said to her, you are very silly,
you little lamb, you had
better stay in the fold. The
Shepherd is so good to us
that we should always do as he
bids us; and if you wander
about by yourself, I dare say
you will come to some harm.
I dare say not, said the little
lamb; and so when the even∣ing
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
came, and the Shepherd
called them all to come into
the fold, she would not come,
but crept slily under a hedge
and hid herself; and when
the rest of the lambs were
all in the fold and fast asleep,
she came out, and jumped,
and frisked, and danced a∣bout;
and she got out of
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
the field, and got into a
forest full of trees, and a very
fierce wolf came rushing out
of a cave and howled very
loud. Then the silly lamb
wished she had been shut up
in the fold; but the fold
was a great way off—and the
wolf saw her, and seized
her, and carried her away to
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
a dismal dark den, all cover∣ed
with bones and blood;
and there the wolf had two
cubs, and the wolf said to
them, Here, I have brought
you a young fat lamb—and
so the cubs took her, and
growled over her a little
while, and then tore her to
pieces, and eat her up.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48"/>
Gold is of a deep yellow
colour. It is very pretty
and bright. It is exceeding
heavy; heavier than any
thing else. Men dig it out
of the ground. Shall I take
my spade and get some? No,
there is none in the fields
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
hereabouts: It comes from
a great way off; and it lies
deeper a great deal than you
could dig with a spade.
Guineas are made of gold;
and half guineas. This watch
is gold; and the looking
glass frame, and the picture
frames are gilt with gold.
Here is some leaf gold. What
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
is leaf gold? It is gold beat
very thin; thinner than
leaves or paper.</P>
<P>Silver is white and shining.
The spoons are silver; and
the waiter is silver; and
crowns, and half crowns,
and shillings, and sixpences
are made of silver. Silver
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
comes from a great way off
too.</P>
<P>Copper is red. The ket∣tles
and pots are made of
copper; and brass is made
of copper. Brass is bright
and yellow like gold almost.
This sauce-pan is made of
brass; and the locks upon the
door, and this candlestick.
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
What is this green upon the
sauce-pan? It is rusty; the
green is verdigris; it would
kill you, if you were to eat it.</P>
<P>Iron is very hard. It is
not pretty, but I do not
know what we should do
without it, for it makes us
a great many things. Go
and ask the cook whether
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
she can roast her meat with∣out
a spit. Well, what does
she say? She says she can∣not.
But the spit is made
of iron; and so are the tongs,
and the poker, and shovel.
Go and ask Dobbin if he can
plough without the plough∣share.
Well, what does he
say? He says No, he can∣not.
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
But the plough-share
is made of iron. Will iron
melt in the fire? Put the
poker in and try. Well, is
it melted? No; but it is
red hot, and soft; it will
bend. But I will tell you,
Charles; Iron will melt in
a very very hot fire when it
has been in a great while;
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
then it will melt. Come,
let us go to the smith's shop.
What is he doing? He has
a forge: he blows the fire
with a great pair of bellows
to make the iron hot. Now
it is hot. Now he takes it
out with the tongs, and puts
it upon the anvil. Now he
beats it with a hammer.
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
How hard he works! The
sparks fly about: pretty
bright sparks! What is the
blacksmith making? he is
making nails, and horse shoes,
and a great many things.</P>
<P>Steel is made of iron. Steel
is very bright, and sharp,
and hard. Knives and scis∣sars
are made of steel.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="57"/>
Lead is soft and very
heavy. Here is a piece: lift
it. There is lead in the case∣ment;
and the spout is lead,
and the cistern is lead, and
bullets are made of lead.
Will lead melt in the fire?
Try: put some on the sho∣vel:
hold it over the fire.
Now it is all melted. Pour
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
it into this bason of water.
How it hisses! What pretty
things it has made!</P>
<P>Tin is white and soft. It
is bright too. The canisters,
and the dripping pan, and
the reflector are all covered
with tin.</P>
<P>Quicksilver is very bright
like silver; and it is very
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
heavy. See how it runs about!
You cannot catch it. You
cannot pick it up. There is
quicksilver in the barometer.</P>
<P>Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron,
Lead, Tin, Quicksilver.
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven—What? Metals.
They are all dug out of the
ground.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="60"/>
Marble is dug out of the
ground. It is very hard:
you cannot cut it with a
knife; but the stone cutter
can cut it. There is white
marble, and black, and
green, and red, and yellow
marble. The chimney piece
<PB N="62" REF="61"/>
is made of marble, and the
monument in the church.</P>
<P>Stones come out of the
ground, and flints. Here
are two flints: they are very
hard: strike them both toge∣ther.
Ah! here is fire; here
are sparks. Gravel is dug
out of gravel pits. They
put it into carts, and then
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
make gravel walks with it,
or else mend the roads with
it. Chalk and fuller's earth
are dug out of the ground.
Coals come out of the ground.
Men dig great deep pits, and
so they go down into them,
and get the coal with pick∣axes,
and bring it up. Those
men are colliers: they are
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
very black, but I do not
know how we should do for
coals to make fires without
them. A great many things
come out of the ground;
sure it is very deep! Yes,
it is very deep. If you were
to dig a hundred years, you
would never come to the
bottom, it is so deep.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="64"/>
Charles, here is a ring <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or
you to play with. See how
it sparkles! Hold it against
the sun. I see all colours
in it. What is this bright
shining stone? It is a
diamond. It is very hard;
you may write upon the glass
with it. A Ruby is red;
bright crimson red. An
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
Emerald is green. A Topaz
is yellow. A Saphire is
blue. The Amethyst is
purple. The Garnet is red.
The Beryl is light green.
All these are dug out of the
earth. They are called jew∣els
—precious stones. And
here is a white round bead,
which is very pretty; it is
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
in an ear-ring. What is it?
It is a pearl. And does that
come out of the ground too?
No, it comes out of the sea.
Pearls are found in oyster-shells.</P>
<P>Will stones melt in the
fire? No.</P>
<P>Does glass come out of
the ground? No. People
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
make glass in a glass-house.
They have great fires burning
all day and all night. You
shall go to a glass-house some
day and see them make it.</P>
<P>A tree has a root that goes
under the ground a great
way. The roots are like
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
its legs: the tree could not
stand without it. Then the
tree has a trunk; a large,
thick, strait trunk. That
is its body. Then the tree
has branches. Those are
like arms. They spread out
very far. Then there are
boughs; and upon the
boughs, leaves and blossoms.
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
Here is a blossom upon the
apple-tree. Will the blos∣som
be always upon the tree?
No, it will fall off soon:
perhaps it will fall off to
night. But then do you
know what comes instead of
the blossom? What? The
fruit. After the apple blos∣soms,
there will be apples.
<PB N="71" REF="70"/>
Then if the blossom falls
off to night, shall I come
here and get an apple to
morrow? No, you must
have patience: there will
not be ripe apples a great
while yet. There will be
first a little little thing hard∣ly
bigger than a pin's head.
That will swell, and grow
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
bigger every day, and harder,
till at last it will come to be
a great apple. But you
must not eat it yet; you
must let it hang till the sun
has made it red, and till you
can pull it off easily. Now
it is ripe: it is as red as your
cheeks. Now gather it and
eat it.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="72"/>
Has a flower a root too?
Yes: here is a cowslip; we
will pull it up. See, here
are roots like strings; here
is the stem of the cowslip;
here is the foot-stalk; here
is the flower-cup; here are
the leaves of the flower; and
a pretty flower it is: fine
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
yellow with crimson spots.
Here are the seeds. If the
seeds are put in the ground,
when they are ripe, another
flower will grow up.</P>
<P>A she Horse is a Mare.

The Lion lives in a den.
He is very strong. He has
a great deal of thick yellow
hair about his neck. That
is his mane. He has very
sharp claws; they would
tear you to pieces. Look
<PB N="78" REF="77"/>
at him. He is very angry.
See, he lashes his sides with
his tail: his eyes sparkle like
fire. He roars: how loud
he roars! It is very terrible.
He shows his sharp teeth.
His tongue is very rough.
The Lion sleeps all day in
his den. When it is night,
he comes out, and prowls
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>
about to find something to
eat. He eats Cows, and
sheep, and horses; and he
would eat you too, if you
were within his reach. The
Lioness has no mane. She
is like a great dog. Any
body would be afraid of a
Lion if he was to come.
Yes, any body would be
<PB N="80" REF="79"/>
afraid of a Lion, Charles:
but you need not be afraid
of dogs, they are good crea∣tures.
I will tell you a
story.</P>
<P>There was once a little
boy, who was a sad coward.
He was afraid of every thing
almost. He was afraid of
the two little kids, Nanny
<PB N="81" REF="80"/>
and Billy, when they came
and put their noses through
the pales of the court; and
he would not pluck Billy
by the beard. What a silly
little boy he was! Pray
what was his name? Nay,
indeed, I shall not tell you
his name, for I am ashamed
<PB N="82" REF="81"/>
of him. Well, he was very
much afraid of dogs too:
he always cried if a dog
barked, and ran away, and
took hold of his mamma's
apron like a baby. What a
foolish fellow he was! for
dogs do not hurt, you know;
they love little boys, and
play with them. Did you
<PB N="83" REF="82"/>
ever see a dog eat up a little
boy? No, never, I dare
say. Well; so this simple
little boy was walking by
himself one day, and a pret∣ty
black dog came out of a
house, and said Bow, wow;
bow, wow; and came to
the little boy, and jumped
upon him, and wanted to
<PB N="84" REF="83"/>
play with him; but the
little boy ran away. The
dog ran after him, and cried
louder, Bow, bow, wow;
but he only meant to say,
Goodmorrow, how do you
do? but this little boy was
sadly frightened, and ran
away as fast as ever he could,
without looking before him,
<PB N="85" REF="84"/>
and he tumbled into a very
dirty ditch, and there he lay
crying at the bottom of the
ditch, for he could not get
out: and I believe he would
have lain there all day, but
the dog was so good-natured,
that he went to the house
where the little boy lived▪
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>
on purpose to tell them
where he was. So when he
came to the house, he
scratched at the door, and
said, Bow wow; for he
could not speak any plainer.
So they opened the door.</P>
<P>What do you want, you
black dog? we do not know
you. Then the dog went
<PB N="87" REF="86"/>
to Ralph the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervant, and
pulled him by the coat, and
pulled him till he brought
him to the ditch; and the
dog and Ralph together got
the little boy out of the
ditch; but he was all over
mud, and quite wet, and
every body laughed at him
because he was a coward.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="87"/>
Now Charles, my pen is
tired, I cannot write any
more at present, but if you
are a good boy perhaps I
may write you some more
stories another time. Farewell.</P>
