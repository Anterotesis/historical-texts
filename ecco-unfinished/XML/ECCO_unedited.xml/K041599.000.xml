<HEAD>To the REVEREND D<SUP>R</SUP>. DELAUNE, PRESIDENT OF St. JOHN'S College in OXFORD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Shall not, in this Address to you, act inconsistently with my professed mean opinion of our modern Dedicators and Dedications, since I design to avoid in my self whatever gives me offence in them, I expect no <HI>Guineas,</HI> and there∣fore
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
I hope you will be so good as to expect no <HI>Compliments.</HI></P>
<P>What wholly prevail'd upon me to clap your venerable Name to these mis∣cellaneous <HI>Bastards</HI> of my brain, was this; I have had for <HI>nine</HI> or <HI>ten</HI> months many things to say unto you; and I was willing to let the world know what they were, as well as your self.</P>
<P>Lo! therefore, at your feet, Reve∣rend Sir, I throw the following Col∣lection of my Lucubrations, which were written (most of 'em) within your learned Walls, and under your most auspicious Government: you will find it compos'd of Poems, sacred and pro∣phane, original, paraphrased, imita∣ted, and translated; Tales, Epigrams, Epistles, Love-verses, Elegies upon departed Friends, and Satires upon li∣ving Enemies; it begins with the <HI>Cre∣ation of the World,</HI> and ends with the discovery of that ingenious utensil, a <HI>Bottle-scrue.</HI></P>
<P>I humbly make it my request that I may be read with the same candour that
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
my co-temporary Authors at OXFORD have been; and that my rhimes may be equally admir'd with others that are equally dull: and I do particularly for∣bid your <HI>Professor</HI> in this Faculty to cri∣ticize on my Works, before he has done the same justice to his own.</P>
<P>But because I know that he cannot forbear carping and cavilling; I design to be even with him, and propose to establish a very bulky Reputation upon the ruins of his: For this purpose I shall shortly put to the Press some in∣comparable Performances, which I have by me, of that orthodox Poet; particularly an excellent new Garland, intitled, <HI>The Hanover Turnip;</HI> a copy of Verses upon the <HI>Chevalier's Picture,</HI> and another upon the death of the <HI>young Prince,</HI> in which he proves the <HI>exit</HI> of that <HI>Whiggish</HI> young Rogue to be the greatest Blessing the Nation ever re∣ceived; but he will be easily forgiven this little Peccadillo by <HI>those persons</HI> who ought to resent it, having lately experienced their good nature in a
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
much greater instance. How happy are some men, whose Enemies prove their Friends! and how unhappy are o∣thers, whose Friends prove their Ene∣mies!</P>
<P>If any person in the University has any Pieces by him, that compliment the <HI>Church,</HI> or vilify the <HI>Revolution,</HI> let him direct 'em to me in my Garret at Mr. <HI>Francklin</HI>'s (not <HI>Curll</HI>'s, as some persons have suppos'd) in <HI>Fleetstreet,</HI> and they shall be faithfully inserted.</P>
<P>To return to my own Labours. You will find some of 'em that make a little free with your sacred Order; but as every candid reader will suppose that I aim at <HI>bad</HI> Clergymen only, I am sure they cannot give <HI>you</HI> the least un∣easiness.</P>
<P>This is all I shall say of the follow∣ing Collection; I will therefore now throw aside the Poet, and speak to you in the character of an unhappy young Fellow, who has, by his erroneous Principles, fallen under your heavy Displeasure, and has been <HI>expell'd</HI> from
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
your <HI>Affections,</HI> as well as your <HI>Col∣lege.</HI></P>
<P>Don't think, dear Sir, that I am going to charge you with any injustice, or even unkindness to me: no; on the contrary, I have receiv'd abundance of favours from your hands, and I am re∣solv'd to acknowledge them.</P>
<P>In the first place; if ten thousand kind promises to serve me to the utmost of your power; if repeated declarations of your Concern for my Welfare and Prosperity, are any Obligations, how infinitely am I oblig'd to you? I don't indeed say that you ever perform'd any of those numerous Promises, or that in any one instance you ever shew'd that Concern you profess'd for me; but I dare not blame you for that; it would be wounding the whole body of <HI>great Men</HI> at once thro' your sides.</P>
<P>Secondly; It was under your wise Administration, that I first arriv'd at any Knowledge in the world: I came to your College a raw, ignorant school∣boy, and foolishly thought Mankind
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
in earnest in what they professed; I took Liberty for a <HI>real</HI> Blessing, and Religion for the <HI>real</HI> Worship of God; I often remember how scrupulous I was in the most <HI>common</HI> concerns of Life; with what awful dread I took an Oath, and with what tremendous veneration I receiv'd the Sacrament: but how much I am improved for the <HI>better</HI> since, let my <HI>worst</HI> Enemies bear witness.</P>
<P>I rashly judg'd of Religion by the Works it produc'd, and of its Pro∣fessors by the sanctity of their Behavi∣our; but I am now convinc'd of a great Truth, namely, that Faith and a good Life are utterly independent of each other, and that a Tree may bring forth <HI>bad</HI> Fruit, without fear of being <HI>hewn down and cast into the Fire.</HI></P>
<P>It is likewise, under your excellent Administration, that I made my self Master of a pipe of Tobacco, a Bottle, and a Syllogism: I got acquainted with abundance of <HI>crabbed</HI> Names and <HI>me∣taphysical</HI> Gentlemen, who formerly gave me terrible apprehensions; but
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
after a little conversation with them, I found them to be very civil, harm∣less Fellows, and so far from having any <HI>bad</HI> meaning, that they had really <HI>no</HI> meaning at all: indeed they have been made the tools of very wicked Men, and for very wicked purposes; but so have many <HI>non-meaning</HI> Blockheads as well as they.</P>
<P>To you, Sir, and to the <HI>learned old Woman, my Mother,</HI> I am also indebt∣ed for the title and privileges of a <HI>Gen∣tleman:</HI> when I came to the Universi∣ty, I thought my self a vile <HI>Plebeian;</HI> but I am told that a liberal Education intitles me to a liberal Character, and accordingly I have now clapt on a <HI>Sword,</HI> a <HI>Tye-Wig,</HI> and a <HI>laced Hat,</HI> and keep company with the best Gentlemen in the County — Indeed I am my self, by <HI>Birth,</HI> a sort of a Gentleman, for my Father was a Country <HI>Grazier,</HI> and my Grandfather, a Country <HI>Parson,</HI> which is (you will say) no mean Extrac∣tion; but <HI>vix ea nostra voco,</HI> and methinks I would set up, on a stock of my own.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9"/>Nor ought I to forget the good ad∣vice and many kind warnings you were pleased to give me: You fairly told me beforehand, that I did not take the right way to a Fellowship in YOUR College; that, if I expected any friends there, I must not follow my own wild opinions, nor my own hair-brain'd judgment: You told me that I had the character of a <HI>turbulent, obstinate, ma∣licious, ill-natur'd</HI> Fellow; and (what is still worse than all, said you) that I was inclin'd to <HI>Infidelity:</HI> upon which I said within my self, <HI>How good and joyful a thing it is for</HI> Brethren <HI>to dwell together in Unity?</HI></P>
<P>Happy had it been for me, if I had followed your advice! but instead of that, like a fool, I got a cock-horse upon Reason, and gallop'd away in romantick search of a fair Lady, called <HI>Truth,</HI> whom after many tedious jour∣nies, and obstinate encounters by the way, I found at last in a large Castle, guarded by a numerous Regiment of <HI>black</HI> Giants, who told me that she was
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
their Prisoner, and that it was in vain for me to attempt her rescue. They told me farther, that they and their predecessors had kept her there for <HI>a∣bove a thousand years,</HI> and had levied upon Mankind immense sums of Money for maintaining them in religious ig∣norance; which they constantly paid with great <HI>thankfulness</HI> and <HI>humility.</HI></P>
<P>These and several other such like favours have I received from <HI>You</HI> and my <HI>academical</HI> Step-mother: there are also several other things which Flesh and Blood assured me were very bad usage; but I comforted my self under them with the thought of what a mer∣ry Friend of mine says, that it is <HI>for the good of our</HI> Souls, <HI>that you use our</HI> Bodies <HI>so ill:</HI> I am glad that the Par∣sons in this one instance come so near the Almighty, whom they are hir'd to imitate, and <HI>chasten whom they love;</HI> sure they must love me dearly well! I rejoice in their kind severities; for let them but suffer me to make the best of
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
the <HI>next world,</HI> I care not how misera∣ble they make me in <HI>this.</HI></P>
<P>You will pardon me, good Sir, if I think it necessary for your Honour to mention the many heinous crimes for which I was brought to shame. None were indeed publickly alledged against me at that time, because it might as well be done afterwards; sure <HI>old Eng∣lishmen</HI> can never forget, that there is such a thing in the world as hanging a Man first, and trying him afterwards: so far'd it with me; my Prosecutors first proved me, by an undeniable Ar∣gument, to be no Fellow of St. JOHN'S College, and then to be—the Lord knows what.</P>
<P>My Indictment, as it is collected out of the faithful Annals of common Fame, runs thus.</P>
<P><HI>Advices from</HI> OXFORD <HI>say, that on the</HI> 29th <HI>of</HI> June, 1719, <HI>one</HI> NICHOLAS AMHURST <HI>of St.</HI> JOHN <HI>'S College was ex∣pell'd for the following Reasons:</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="12"/><HI>Imprimis,</HI> For loving <HI>foreign</HI> Turnips and <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Bishops.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> For believing that <HI>Steeples</HI> and <HI>Organs</HI> are not absolutely necessary to salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> For Ingratitude to his Bene∣factor, that spotless Martyr, St. WIL∣LIAM LAUD.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> for <HI>Preaching</HI> without Orders, and <HI>Praying</HI> without a Commission.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> For lampooning <HI>Priestcraft</HI> and <HI>Petticoatcraft.</HI></P>
<Q>Quam benè conveniunt &amp; in <HI>unâ sede</HI> morantur?</Q>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> For <HI>not</HI> lampooning the <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> and the <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> For prying into <HI>secret History.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To prevent the same.</P>
<P>My natural Modesty will not permit me, like other Apologists, to vindi∣cate my self in any one particular; the whole Charge is so artfully drawn up, that no reasonable person would think
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
ever the <HI>better</HI> of me, should I justify my self till Doomsday.</P>
<Q><L>— Pudet haec opprobria nobis</L>
<L>Et dici potuisse, &amp; non potuisse refelli.</L></Q>
<P>I am willing to submit to any accu∣sation which so candid and impartial a person as <HI>common Fame</HI> shall bring a∣gainst me; for tho' she has made but a scurvy sort of a Blade of me; yet if her Reports will be allow'd to be au∣thentick, there are <HI>other Persons</HI> in the world as bad as my self.</P>
<P>And therefore, like other polite Ma∣lefactors, I heartily forgive my Accu∣sers, and confess that I deserv'd the punishment I suffer'd: I am now suffi∣ciently convinc'd of the folly and sot∣tishness of Freethinking; and were it possible for me to live over my days a∣gain, no body should accuse me of too little Faith; no, I would believe even to supererogation, and make it the sole business of my Life to bolt new Myste∣ries out of Scripture, and new points of
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
Faith more difficult and abstruse than those already impos'd upon Mankind, to shew how good a Churchman I could be, and how much I could outstrip even the <HI>Athanasian</HI> Believers.</P>
<P>I can scarce forgive my self for my childish Behaviour whilst I was under your Power and Disposal: what had I to do with the Quarrels of the Clergy, or the Authority of the Convocation, or the Divinity of your OXFORD Ladies? Blockhead as I was! Why could not I believe every thing, pay no body, and live in as much Re∣putation as my Neighbours?</P>
<P>My Eyes are now open, and the stu∣pidity of my late Conduct glares me full in the face; I see the fool-hardi∣ness of opposing popular Arguments and established Opinions; and what mortifies me most is, that altho' I am convinc'd of an error, yet is it too late to repent.</P>
<P>Here, methinks, you interrupt me with that notable saying in your mouth, <HI>nunquam sera est ad bonos mores via:</HI>
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
Pho! Doctor, that's all foolish, an∣tiquated stuff! Our modern Ethicks say, that it is too late to repent, when it is too late to get any thing by it. Very well, say you; but pray, Sir, is not <HI>Virtue its own Reward?</HI> O fie, Doctor! worse and worse still; Hunger, Thirst, and Nakedness are but poor Rewards, and (in my opi∣nion) worse than none at all.</P>
<P>I hope all young Men will take warn∣ing from me, how they meddle with spiritual <HI>Edge Tools,</HI> and ecclesiastical <HI>Prize-fighters.</HI> Who, but a Fool or a Madman, would have his Pockets pick'd, or his Bones broken; or be turn'd out of a good Place, or into a nasty Gaol merely for <HI>thinking</HI> like one <HI>in his Senses?</HI> We were some time ago assured by a very great and reverend Person, that <HI>Freethinking is not now the way to Preferment:</HI> and has not he made his word good? Are not the greatest Bigots and Blockheads made the great∣est <HI>Pluralists?</HI> Are not the best <HI>Parso∣nages,</HI> and the fattest <HI>Sine Cures</HI> the Re∣ward
<PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>
of Laziness and Ignorance? If this is not a good Argument against <HI>thinking freely,</HI> I would know what is.</P>
<P>Besides, <HI>Freethinking</HI> is unfashiona∣ble, and makes a Man look singular in all Company; it puts him to the con∣tinual fatigue of proving white to be white, and black to be black, for which he is sure to be heartily pitied and de∣spis'd.</P>
<P>The whole world is govern'd by a <HI>majority:</HI> A powerful Monarch thinks it a good argument for clapping up a Peace with all convenient speed. The same weighty argument has induc'd many an holy Pastor to forswear himself, and comply with the <HI>necessity</HI> of the Times. In short, it makes Kings and Parliament Men; settles Money Bills and Articles of Faith.</P>
<P>Another good argument against <HI>think∣ing freely,</HI> or (which is just the same) against <HI>thinking at all,</HI> is, that it im∣pairs the Constitution, debilitates the Nerves, renders the Countenance sal∣low and wrinkled, is a great nourisher
<PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>
of the Vapours, and very much inca∣pacitates young Fellows for the society of Ladies. This argument has of late done great service to the Church at OXFORD.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Freethinking</HI> is apt to make Men think contemptuously of Excom∣munication, and Absolution, and Be∣nediction, and Passive Obedience, and Hereditary Right, and Per—y, and — other such like <HI>Apostolical</HI> Doctrines of the Church.</P>
<P>These few, but unanswerable argu∣ments will, I hope, be of some use to stop the growing mischiefs of <HI>Reason</HI> and private <HI>Enquiry;</HI> I have felt the smart of them my self, and would shew others the Rock upon which I split: all that I can do farther towards this pious end, is to make a publick Recantation of my Errors, which I freely do in the following words.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Whereas I <HI>N. A.</HI> formerly Member of St. <HI>JOHN</HI>'S College in <HI>OXFORD,</HI> and now Citizen of the wide World, have, by some
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
late poisonous Writings, been unwarily and fatally misled into divers heretical and damnable Opinions, inconsistent with the Prosperity of the <HI>visible</HI> Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and <HI>her visible</HI> Governors, by pro∣fessing an ill-grounded Zeal for the <HI>invi∣sible</HI> Church and her <HI>invisible</HI> King; and whereas, in consequence of this unhappy Delusion, I thought my self at liberty to make use of those faculties and abilities which God Almighty had given me, im∣piously presuming that he had given them me for the same purpose; I do hereby publickly, solemnly, and totally renounce, retract, abjure, and forever disclaim the aforesaid damnable Doctrines and Opini∣ons; and I do most humbly intreat the <HI>Con∣vocation</HI> to pardon (if it be venial) this great and heinous Offence, faithfully promising that I will for the future conform my self to all their Doctrines, Opinions, Decla∣rations, Interpretations, and Decisions whatsoever, however seemingly unjust in themselves, or palpably contradictory to each other, in defiance of my own <HI>Rea∣son</HI> and <HI>private Judgment,</HI> as becomes a
<PB N="xx" REF="19"/>
good Churchman, and a strenuous <HI>Con∣tender for the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>N. AMHURST.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Having made this ample Recanta∣tion, I expect from henceforward to be look'd upon and treated as a sound <HI>Believer,</HI> and to reap all the Privileges and Advantages which belong to that glorious Character; I expect that no body will think the worse of me, if I loosen a little the Reins of my Life, since I have straiten'd those of my Faith; and if I should be accidentally caught tripping in any of the modish Frail∣ties of Flesh and Blood, that I may be excus'd, as other great and orthodox Sinners have been, in this kind man∣ner; <HI>Well, well, for all that, the young Man has sound Principles, and hates the Bishop of</HI> Bangor.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear mentioning, upon this occasion, that my present happy Conversion is in a great measure owing to the late ingenious Writings of the
<PB N="xxi" REF="20"/>
Reverend Dr. <HI>H—re,</HI> which make the deeper Impression upon me, because he was once in the same Errors with my self, tho' he has not thought fit to re∣tract them <HI>formally</HI> as I have done: but as I have now listed my self under him, I hope no body will be surpriz'd if I should tack about again, provided the <HI>irresistible Importunities</HI> of Self-interest and the Convocation should make it ne∣cessary; being convinc'd that <HI>Occasional Conformity</HI> is not a Doctrine belonging to <HI>one</HI> sett of Men only, but that it is grown consistent with the Characters of our best <HI>Churchmen.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I reconcil'd my self to the Church again; and to convince you that I sincerely believe you enter'd un∣willingly into the measures of my Ex∣clusion, give me leave to acquaint the World with what, I have heard, you were pleased to do in my favour.</P>
<P>I am informed, and pretty credibly too, that when Complaints began to multiply and grow loud against me, you did, in your great Goodness, con∣descend
<PB N="xxii" REF="21"/>
to write a Letter to a certain reverend Relation of mine, to acquaint him with my Behaviour, and the Cha∣racter I labour'd under, desiring at the same time his Advice <HI>what to do with me;</HI> and that you put it in his Power to keep me in my Fellowship, or to turn me out of it. What was the Conse∣quence is well enough known: but I must observe that this Procedure was, tho' honestly and candidly designed, very inconsistent with Truth and Ju∣stice: for if, by my Conduct, I did either actually deserve, or, in your Conscience, seem'd to deserve, what I have since suffer'd, I ought to suffer it, whether the <HI>usual</HI> Tenderness of a near Relation interceded in my behalf or not; and, on the other side, if I did not deserve it, neither ought I to have suffer'd it, tho' my <HI>own Father</HI> concurr'd in the Sentence against me. But I believe you were led into this, by your unwil∣lingness to disoblige an old Friend who <HI>keeps a good House,</HI> and has <HI>good Wine</HI> in his Cellar.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="22"/>I am farther informed that you have since waited upon this reverend Gen∣tleman, to notify unto him what was done against me, and how loth you were to comply with it upon his account; and that you found him so perfectly satisfied with your Conduct, and so inveterately enrag'd against me, that he declar'd in the most ungentle manner, <HI>He car'd not what became of me.</HI> Hei mihi!</P>
<P>As you are a Person of great Can∣dour, and equal Integrity, I will cha∣ritably suppose that you play'd no false Play; but that you used no unjust Arts to rob me of the Affections of so <HI>valuable</HI> a Friend; but that you represented my Case to him in the fairest and most im∣partial manner: I will suppose this, tho' I have been told to the contrary.</P>
<P>If you dealt honestly with me, and honourably with him, you assured him that it was solely on account of my obnoxious Opinions that I lost my Fel∣lowship; or that, if you aggravated my bad Principles with bad Practices,
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23"/>
you assur'd him you never did nor ever will admit so <HI>immoral</HI> a Person as my self into <HI>your</HI> College whilst you <HI>govern</HI> it: if you did thus, no doubt you will stand by it, and then I will acquit you with all my Heart.</P>
<P>The pravity and sinfulness of my Opinions I have sufficiently confess'd and repented of in my Recantation; and as for Morality, I hope no body can charge me with violating that part of it which relates to <HI>Friendship, Ho∣nour,</HI> and <HI>common Honesty;</HI> if I have been less careful of that, which in∣jures my self only, it is a frailty that is common to Humanity, and almost inseparable from it: perhaps I now and then <HI>take my Glass too freely,</HI> or <HI>kiss a pretty Woman in a Corner;</HI> but I pay <HI>my Debts</HI> honestly, and <HI>defraud no body.</HI> I wish I had not, at this time, instances before my Eyes of Men most notoriously guilty of <HI>dishonest, knavish</HI> Immorality; which, in my Creed, is much the worse of the two.</P>
<P><PB N="xxv" REF="24"/>I know a certain Person in the world, who was left <HI>Guardian</HI> to a young Wo∣man, who is since married; and tho' the greatest Importunity has been made, for above <HI>four</HI> Years, to get her Fortune out of the Hands of this <HI>unjust Steward,</HI> yet all has proved ineffectual: What makes this piece of Barbarity still more barbarous, is, that her Husband was a young Man and a <HI>Tradesman</HI> then just set up; so that the Money would have been of the greatest Advantage to him; and this fraudulent Detention of it has already prov'd of the greatest Disadvantage. I do not design to point out the Person now, because I hope he will take this Hint and pay the Money; otherwise I am resolv'd to set forth all the Circumstances, and produce him publickly, even tho' he should be found (which God forbid!) within your own Walls. He is a Person long since <HI>infa∣mous</HI> for such inhuman Practices.</P>
<P>But to return to my dear self once more. I have indeed been a very naughty Boy; but, in my Lay-Opi∣nion,
<PB N="xxvi" REF="25"/>
I have done pretty ample Pe∣nance for all my Offences: I have lost a <HI>good</HI> Fellowship, and (which was much more valuable to me) your <HI>good Opinion;</HI> my Enemies insult my Mis∣fortunes, and even my Friends blame my Imprudence for bringing them up∣on my self; the <HI>first</HI> look upon me as a Bigot to the <HI>worst</HI> of Principles; and the <HI>last</HI> as a Betrayer of the <HI>best,</HI> by maintaining them in too great a Lati∣tude, and with too much Openness: These <HI>pity</HI> me, and those <HI>despise</HI> me; nay (to tell you a Secret) I began to despise my self, 'till I had made <HI>my Peace</HI> again with the Church.</P>
<P>I was particularly unfortunate in the Displeasure of a <HI>pretty female Relation,</HI> who (upon hearing that I was <HI>expell'd</HI> from the <HI>University;</HI> for that is our Country Phrase) exclaim'd with some Vehemence, that she was sorry I should bring such a Disgrace upon the FAMILY! Now as I ought to be as much con∣cern'd for the Honour of the AMHUR∣STIAN Family as this fair Lady; I have
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26"/>
seriously taken it into my Considera∣tion, how my <HI>Exclusion</HI> could possibly bring any Disgrace upon it; and after Examination find quite the contrary to what this fair Kinswoman of mine im∣plicitly alledges to be true: for</P>
<P N="1">1. The Honour of our House is so well established by our Predecessors, who (it is well known) were Heroes, and Patriots, and Lovers of their Coun∣try in the worst of Times, and knock'd down Giants, and slew Dragons; that it is out of the Power of any of its corrupt Descendants to bring any real Disgrace upon it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Lord have Mercy upon many of the noblest Families in <HI>England,</HI> if the Vices of the present Generation are any Blots to the original Stock it self.</P>
<P N="3">3. On the contrary, supposing I have degenerated from the Virtues I am Heir to; yet my <HI>Exclusion,</HI> instead of bringing a Disgrace upon my Family, is the best Justification of it. I would ask any rea∣sonable Christian, whether the Fall of the Apostate Angels brought any Dis∣grace
<PB N="xxviii" REF="27"/>
upon the <HI>Angelick Family?</HI> Or whether it would not have rather seem∣ed a Disgrace to it, if they had not fell. Thus, had I continued in the high and eminent Station of a Fellow of St. JOHN'S College in OXFORD, I might indeed have brought Disgrace upon my Family; but being cast down from thence, into the low and grovel∣ing Condition, in which I now am, it is impossible for me to do it, and my <HI>worthy</HI> Relations need be under no Ap∣prehensions upon my account.</P>
<P>Your Goodness, Sir, will pardon this Digression, and will not, I believe, think it wholly impertinent: but you will ob∣serve, how apt Authors are to contra∣dict themselves; I set out with assuring you, that I would not, like other De∣dicators, make you any Compliments; and yet, by confessing such an heap of Iniquities, have I made you the great∣est Compliment that the most fulsome Wretch in this Art could possibly invent. How much ought that Man to be re∣spected (especially by the <HI>Clergy</HI> and the
<PB N="xxix" REF="28"/>
<HI>Ladies</HI>) who remov'd such a Nuisance out of a polite and christian Society?</P>
<P>But I must complain of one thing; whether reasonably or not, let the World judge: when I was voted out of your College, and the Nuisance was thereby remov'd; I thought the Resent∣ments of the <HI>holy ones</HI> would have pro∣ceeded no farther; I am sure the Cause of Virtue and sound Religion (which I was thought to offend) required no more; nor could it be of any possible Advantage to the Church to descend into my private Affairs, and stir up my Creditors in the University to take hold of me at a Disadvantage, before I could get any Money return'd to pay 'em; but there are some Persons in the World, who think nothing unjust or inhuman in the Prosecution of their implacable Revenge.</P>
<P>As this is a very material Circum∣stance of my Life, and of the temper of <HI>some others,</HI> I will give the Reader a short account of this matter truly and impartially, as I will attest it upon my
<PB N="xxx" REF="29"/>
Honour or my Oath, if so vile a Fel∣low may be believ'd in either.</P>
<P>I was dismiss'd from College on <HI>Monday</HI> the 29th of <HI>June;</HI> the next Day I went fourteen or fifteen Miles into <HI>Berkshire</HI> to see a Relation, where I staid till the <HI>Friday</HI> following: I had before sent for Money to discharge all my Debts at OXFORD, being ap∣priz'd of the Design of turning me out of College. On <HI>Saturday</HI> Morn∣ing Mr. <HI>W.</HI> my Mercer called upon me at my Lodgings, and ask'd me how long I should stay in Town; I answer'd, 'till I receiv'd a Bill for Money to pay what I owed there, and no longer. He went away seemingly well satisy'd, and neither ask'd me for Money, nor deliver'd me his Bill, nor indeed had he written it out: but when I came home to my Lodgings at Night, the Chamberlain told me that Mr. <HI>Cox</HI> the Sergeant had enquir'd for me. The next Morning I sent for him, and desired to know his Business, and he told me he had a Writ against
<PB N="xxxi" REF="30"/>
me at the Suit of Mr. <HI>W.</HI> but it being <HI>Sunday</HI> did not serve it. By this time I had receiv'd a Note for Money pay∣able at Sight, which (as things it seems were order'd) brought me Liberty a∣long with it. I then waited upon Mr. <HI>W.</HI> and enquir'd of him the Rea∣son of such uncommon a Proceeding. In answer to which, with the utmost Confusion and Marks of Sorrow, he told me that he was instigated to it by <HI>Persons of my own College,</HI> who assured him, that if he ever expected his Mo∣ney, he must arrest me immediately; for, said they, he will go off privately to morrow morning, will pay no bo∣dy, nor will ever be heard of again, for he designs to <HI>go into the Army;</HI> which you know, Sir, at OXFORD, signifies the same as running away. I shew'd him my Note, and offer'd to leave it with him, which he refused, desiring to be forgiven this rash and silly Action in the most passionate man∣ner; he profess'd that he had rather have cut off his right Hand than have
<PB N="xxxii" REF="31"/>
done it, and was overjoy'd that the Writ was not serv'd, with much more to the same effect; and often repeated it, that he should never have done it, if <HI>some Persons of my own College</HI> had not urged him to it.</P>
<P>Herein again, Sir, I perfectly ac∣quit you, well knowing that you have too much Humanity and Good-Nature to be engag'd in so mean-spirited an Action; your Friendship for the Re∣verend Gentleman my Relation, whom I just now mention'd, would not have suffer'd you to do it, were there no other Motive: but besides that, I am confident you are too well acquaint∣ed with the World, not to know that if <HI>every one</HI> were to be served in the same rigid manner, they might not come off quite so well as I did.</P>
<P>Now I am making my Complaints to you, another thing comes into my Head, which I think very hard, if it be true.</P>
<P>I am told that you had Information of some of the most material Secrets of
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="32"/>
my Life, from <HI>a Quarter,</HI> where you ought least to <HI>expect,</HI> or I to <HI>fear</HI> it. I could not suspect the Person, I mean, to be capable of such disingenuous Dealing; neither did I suspect that I had any Enemy in the World, who would stoop so low as to encourage it. But what shall we say? <HI>Birds of a Fea∣ther,</HI> &amp;c. says a good old Proverb.</P>
<P>It is some Consolation to me under all my Misfortunes, that I am not the only Person, who has suffer'd for hete∣rodox Opinions in OXFORD; I have seen with my own Eyes many a young Fellow deny'd his <HI>Degree</HI> upon this Account; I have seen them hated, calumniated and insulted in the most discouraging man∣ner; some have been expell'd before <HI>me,</HI> and we have one remarkable instance since, how zealous the reverend HEADS of Colleges are to pluck up <HI>Heresy</HI> by the Roots, and purge away the last Dregs of those pernicious Principles which must otherwise end in the Ruin of the <HI>best constituted Church in the World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xxxiv" REF="33"/>You, Sir, in a particular manner de∣serve our Thanks, for your many stre∣nuous Pulpit-Attacks upon those two troublesome <HI>Heresiarchs, common Sense</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>B—r:</HI> I do not men∣tion <HI>common Honesty,</HI> tho' he is sorely suspected of Ill-will to the Church, be∣cause he has not as yet been formally excommunicated;
<Q>Quod diu multumque desideratum.</Q></P>
<P>I hope what I have said is sufficient to vindicate my self from a Report, that I am the Author of a late scandalous Libel, called, <HI>A Letter from a Student in Grubstreet to a Reverend High-Priest and Head of a College in</HI> OXFORD, &amp;c. which, some People, suppos'd was le∣vell'd at you: I protest to you, Doctor, with one Hand laid orthodoxly upon my Heart, and both my Eyes strain'd up to Heav'n in a very religious manner, that <HI>I know nothing of the matter;</HI> nay, I would swear it, were I not well assur'd that no body will presume to question
<PB N="xxxv" REF="34"/>
the bare Word of one who liv'd <HI>three</HI> Years (under the Influence of your good Example) in a College where <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>false Witness</HI> are so exemplarily punish'd and discourag'd.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear that strict Enquiry is made after the Author and Printer of that villainous Libel, and that the Prosecution of them is undertaken by such able Hands as that eminent Biblio∣pole, the worthy Mr. <HI>J—h B—y—r,</HI> and the Right Reverend —</P>
<P>Let me conclude with assuring you that however despicably you may think of me, I will still retain the same good Opinion of you, that I ever had, and will not fail to pay my Respects to you whenever an Opportunity offers; nay, I will frame Opportunities on purpose, rather than be wanting in this parti∣cular.</P>
<P>That you may long live a Pattern of Learning and Piety to our famous University; that St. JOHN'S College may long enjoy so faithful a Steward and indulgent a Father; that as a Re∣ward
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="35"/>
for your Virtues, you may taste all the good things of this World, and late, (ah! very late) receive the <HI>Fruits of your Labours</HI> in another, is the con∣stant and hearty Prayer of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED><HI>Your most oblig'd, most obedient, most devoted, and most grateful, humble Servant,</HI> N. AMHURST.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD><HI>THE</HI> MOSAICAL <HI>CREATION,</HI> A Paraphrase on the first Chapter of <HI>Genesis.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the dark Backward of six thousand years,</L>
<L>(So <HI>Moses</HI> writes and all our christian Seers)</L>
<L>The World, a rude, unfashion'd <HI>Embryo</HI> lay,</L>
<L>Eternal Night, without a glimpse of Day,</L>
<L>Earth, seas, and heaven, in one blind <HI>Chaos</HI> thrown,</L>
<L>And years, and months, and days, were names unknown,</L>
<L>'Till God mark'd out th' interminable space,</L>
<L>And stamp'd Creation on the formless mass;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="39"/>Wide o'er the Void his genial Wings he spread,</L>
<L>And entity uprear'd its infant head;</L>
<L>Prone to her center sunk the earth below,</L>
<L>And o'er her face the rising Waters flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let there be Light, said God; and sudden light</L>
<L>Sprung from the Deep, and burst the womb of night;</L>
<L>Dreadful it gleam'd along the barren Waste,</L>
<L><HI>Hell</HI> startled, and old <HI>Chaos</HI> stood aghast;</L>
<L>From the dusk gloom he call'd the chearful light,</L>
<L>Prescrib'd it's bounds, and wing'd it for the flight.</L>
<L>God saw, approv'd, and bless'd the spreading Ray:</L>
<L>And the <HI>first</HI> Ev'ning clos'd the <HI>first-created</HI> Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again th' Almighty said; let us prepare</L>
<L>A wide expanse of undulating Air;</L>
<L>And let it be, the Waters to remove</L>
<L>Beneath the firmament, from those above;</L>
<L>He spoke benign; and with his outstretch'd hand</L>
<L>Establish'd the immutable command:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="40"/>Forthwith thin vapours from the gulph arise,</L>
<L>Cloud after cloud, and thicken into Skies;</L>
<L>God saw and bless'd: while choral Angels play,</L>
<L>And crown with joyful hymns the <HI>second</HI> Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still was the earth in ambient oceans drown'd,</L>
<L>Nor knew the waters their appointed bound:</L>
<L>When thus again Heav'ns all-sufficient Lord</L>
<L>Thro' the dark Void pronounc'd his pow'rful word;</L>
<L>Hear and obey, ye waters, that below</L>
<L>The firmament in wild disorder flow;</L>
<L>Be gather'd into one capacious bed,</L>
<L>And let <HI>Dry-land</HI> upheave her naked head:</L>
<L>Th' Almighty thus; and sudden at the word,</L>
<L>Obedient down the hills the torrents pour'd;</L>
<L>Thro' porous veins impetuous waters sweep,</L>
<L>And headlong croud into a chrystal heap:</L>
<L>Low sunk beneath the hollow'd earth provides</L>
<L>An ample basin for the rushing tides.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="41"/>Emerging hills, and broken rocks arise</L>
<L>And lift their craggy summits to the skies.</L>
<L>God saw it, and confirm'd the wise decree,</L>
<L>He nam'd the Dry-land, Earth; the Waters, Sea:</L>
<L>And said, let lusty verdure cloathe the earth,</L>
<L>And let the fields conceive a various birth;</L>
<L>Let tender Grass, and painted Flow'rs arise,</L>
<L>And to the season trust their gaudy Dies;</L>
<L>Let lofty Trees their shady honours spread,</L>
<L>And fragrant Herbs perfume the springing Mead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce had he spoke, when lo! the quick'ning ground</L>
<L>Spontaneous smil'd, with vernal beauties crown'd:</L>
<L>Flow'r, Herb, and Grass, arise; and o'er the Plain</L>
<L>Mature for harvest waves the bearded grain;</L>
<L>Unplanted trees drive deep their branching roots,</L>
<L>Spread in the air, and bend with golden fruits.</L>
<L>God saw it, that 'twas good, and bless'd it all,</L>
<L>And the <HI>third</HI> day beheld the shadows fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="42"/>
<L>Again, said God; let radiant Orbs appear</L>
<L>Thro' the wide kingdoms of the Hemisphere;</L>
<L>Alternate day and darkness to divide,</L>
<L>And o'er the seasons of the year preside.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And God created two vast Orbs of light,</L>
<L>To bear dividual rule by day and night:</L>
<L>And first the Sun, an huge, unweildy sphere</L>
<L>He fixt aloft, to lead the circling year;</L>
<L>To spread around his lustre, and bestow</L>
<L>Prolific influence on the world below.</L>
<L>To the bright Car he join'd the flaming horse,</L>
<L>Furnish'd with light; and pointed out his course:</L>
<L>With gen'rous courage, from the barrier freed,</L>
<L>O'er the wide azure, bounds th' aethereal steed;</L>
<L>'Till from afar he views the less'ning East,</L>
<L>And hastens down the ruddy-colour'd West;</L>
<L>There forms, in halcyon waves, a downy bed,</L>
<L>To rest his weary limbs, and quench his burning head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="43"/>
<L>Oppos'd to him the silver Moon displays</L>
<L>Her spotted Orb, and burns with fainter rays;</L>
<L>With level'd aspect views his golden urn,</L>
<L>Feasts on his beams, and fills her famish'd horn;</L>
<L>Which the Almighty fashion'd, to preside</L>
<L>O'er winds and waves, and rule the angry tide;</L>
<L>With spangling Stars to join her trembling light,</L>
<L>And share the gloomy empire of the night:</L>
<L>Of spangling Stars sprung forth, at his command,</L>
<L>And roll'd their destin'd orbs, a num'rous band;</L>
<L>Darkness repuls'd, day scarce could night outvye,</L>
<L>And on the World bestow a brighter sky.</L>
<L>God saw, approv'd and bless'd what he had made,</L>
<L>And the <HI>fourth</HI> day receiv'd the falling shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And God said; let the fruitful Waters teem,</L>
<L>And moving creatures glide thro' ev'ry stream;</L>
<L>Let feather'd Fowl thro' fluid kingdoms fly,</L>
<L>And with their pinions fan the floating sky.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="44"/>He spoke; and strait the pregnant Seas brought forth</L>
<L>And ev'ry billow teem'd a scaly birth;</L>
<L>The huge Leviathan from side to side</L>
<L>Tumbled along, and flounc'd the thundring tide;</L>
<L>On the smooth Calm the arching Dolphins play,</L>
<L>And shape, in sportive chace, their liquid way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While <HI>Embryo</HI> Fowl distend the tepid Shells,</L>
<L>Mature for life, and burst their scanty cells;</L>
<L>Or loosly rang'd, or firmly wedg'd they rise,</L>
<L>A feather'd cloud, and blacken half the Skies.</L>
<L>The strong-pounc'd <HI>Eagle,</HI> with unwearied sight,</L>
<L>Tow'rs the bright sun to his meridian height.</L>
<L>The elegiac <HI>Nightingale</HI> prepares</L>
<L>Her ev'ning song, and sinks in solemn airs.</L>
<L>The <HI>Lark</HI> melodious, poiz'd on level'd wings,</L>
<L>Hangs in mid air, and brisker carols sings;</L>
<L>Borne on the breeze her silver warblings float,</L>
<L>And the Creator swells in ev'ry note.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="45"/>The crested <HI>Cock,</HI> with a majestick mien,</L>
<L>Pains his shril voice, and struts along the Green.</L>
<L>With leathern oars the silver <HI>Swan</HI> divides</L>
<L>The lake, and proudly o'er the mirrour rides.</L>
<L>While that fair bird, whose varied plumes unfold</L>
<L>Myriads of starry eyes, and gems of Gold,</L>
<L>With conscious pride spreads forth his gorgeous train,</L>
<L>And with brocaded Pinions sweeps the plain.</L>
<L>God saw that it was good; and, gracious, said,</L>
<L>(In mantling thunder and in winds aray'd)</L>
<L>Be fruitful, O! ye creatures, that repair</L>
<L>On painted Wings thro' Fields of buoyant Air;</L>
<L>Be fruitful, O! ye creatures, that divide</L>
<L>The restless Waves, and cleave the briny tide;</L>
<L>Female, and male increase; with genial seed</L>
<L>Replenish ev'ry stream, and multiply your breed.</L>
<L>While yet he spoke, the youthful Sun descends,</L>
<L>And the <HI>fifth</HI> day in gloomy darkness ends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="46"/>
<L>Once more th' Almighty said; let fruitful Earth</L>
<L>Unfold her womb, and teem with num'rous birth:</L>
<L>Let cattle in the field expect their food,</L>
<L>And savage beasts frequent the lonely wood;</L>
<L>Let reptile animals, a minim race,</L>
<L>And various insects swarm in ev'ry place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Straitway the earth impregnated conceives,</L>
<L>And the swol'n globe with num'rous offspring heaves;</L>
<L>The shaggy Lyon, and the bristled Boar</L>
<L>Rise into life, and thro' the desart, roar;</L>
<L>The Ox and Tyger crowd the peaceful plain,</L>
<L>And the fleet Courser shakes his flowing mane;</L>
<L>The vast Behemoth, of enormous size,</L>
<L>Starts from the glebe, and rolls his glaring eyes;</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job 4.15.</NOTE>Behemoth, largest of all nature's race,</L>
<L>With ribs of iron, and with nerves of brass;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="47"/>His loins are stronger than the temper'd mail,</L>
<L>And like a cedar moves his length of tail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still there remains, said God, the noblest part,</L>
<L>The boldest effort of <HI>creating Art:</HI></L>
<L>After our likeness let us draw the plan,</L>
<L>And in our image build immortal <HI>Man;</HI></L>
<L>Man o'er the riches of the earth to reign,</L>
<L>Of trackless air, and vast unbounded main;</L>
<L>Endow'd with reason, and a pow'r to Will,</L>
<L>Inclin'd to good, tho' not restrain'd from Ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And from the dust God shap'd the human frame,</L>
<L>And in his Nostrils breath'd the living flame;</L>
<L>Female and Male he shap'd them; to command</L>
<L>Earth, air and seas, and bless his righteous hand;</L>
<L>The brute machine confess'd th' informing ray,</L>
<L>And infant Motion warm'd the strugling clay:</L>
<L>Wak'd into life, his eyes begin to roll,</L>
<L>His heart to beat, to meditate his soul;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="48"/>Erect to heav'n he lifts his ardent sight,</L>

<LG>
<L><HI>Female and Male God shap'd the human Frame</HI></L>

<L>But <HI>Adam</HI> slept; for God his eyelids press'd,</L>
<L>And took the beauteous Female from his breast,</L>
<L>From a stol'n <HI>Rib</HI> the shining creature rose,</L>
<L>Fresh, fair, and spotless as the falling snows</L>
<L>Sparkling and gay as the primoeval light,</L>
<L>Soft to the touch and lovely to the sight,</L>
<L>With polish'd features, but an artless mind,</L>
<L>Unequal fate! to damn and bless Mankind.</L>
<L>Like fragrant flowers she breath'd commanding love,</L>
<L>And her eyes glitter'd, like the stars above,</L>
<L>Soch arming was the Mother of our Race,</L>
<L>That Angels gaz'd in transport on her Face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="49"/>
<L>When thus, in words which, loud as thunder, broke,</L>
