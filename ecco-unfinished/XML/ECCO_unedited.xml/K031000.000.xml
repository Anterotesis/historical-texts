<HEAD>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
SIDNEY,
EARL of GODOLPHIN,
Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Dramatick Poem which was
written in the Cause of Liberty, flies
to Your Lordship for Protection, who have
been so great a Patron and Protector of Li∣berty,
when she was in the utmost Danger.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
And here, my Lord, as a Lover of Li∣berty
and of my Country, I should nei∣ther
think my self Just nor Grateful, if I
should not make mention of the wonderful
things which Your Lordship has done for
both.</P>
<P>But what Writer has Force enough to
mention those Wonders worthily? Or who
has Art enough to manage so nice a Sub∣ject
so dextrously, that neither the Enemies
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> may think he says too much,
nor the Friends too little.</P>
<P>To satisfie the one, and to silence the
other, I shall briefly inquire what impartial
History will say of Your Lordship, and
the just Praises that You will receive from
uncorrupted Posterity.</P>
<P>When a Just and Impartial History shall
relate the dangerous condition in which the
present War at the beginning found these
Nations, and the rest of <HI>Europe;</HI> and af∣terwards
describe the wonderful change to a
State of Conquest and Glory, what vast
Applause will Posterity give to those, who,
<PB REF="5"/>
by the Wisdom of their Councils, wrought
the Delivery of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>For as it was neither Chance nor brutal
Force, but Counsel that laid the Founda∣tion
of the <HI>French</HI> Greatness under Cardi∣nal
<HI>Richlieu,</HI> as it was Counsel and not
Force that carried that Greatness on, wit∣ness
their Treaties, by which they have ac∣quired
more than they have by their Victo∣ries,
and witness their seizing, in one day,
upon a Monarchy of ten times a greater
Extent than their own, so it was neither
Chance nor brutal Force, but Counsel that
shook and overturn'd the excessive Power
of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But I appeal to the very Enemies of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> to their very Malice, their
Invectives, their Libels, if your Lordship
has not had so great a share in the Wisdom
of those Councils which have wrought the
Delivery of <HI>Europe,</HI> that you seem to have
been design'd by Providence, and to have
been sent into the World on purpose to
<PB REF="6"/>
overthrow the vast, but pernicious Designs
of the great Cardinal <HI>Richelieu.</HI></P>
<P>For whom will History deliver down to
Posterity as the Friend and the intimate
Correspondent of the Great Captain who
has done such Glorious Things for us?
With whom has He concerted His Good
and Great Designs? Who duly supply'd
Him with the Nerves of War, the Source
of Discipline, Spirit and Force? The Great
Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and the Illustrious
Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> will be held by Poste∣rity
to have been to this Island, what the
two friendly Gods were formerly esteemed
by the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who were always account∣ed
Propitious, when they appeared and
shone together.</P>
<P>That Your Lordship and your Friend
who have done such mighty Things for us,
may long be the Ornament and the Defence
of your Country, that the QUEEN may
long be supported by both, and appear be∣tween
both, like the Goddess of Wisdom,
<PB REF="7"/>
with Her peaceful Olive on one Hand,
and Her dreadful Shield on the other, is,
and shall be, the hearty wish of,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
Your Lordships
Most Humble,
Most Faithful, and
Most Obliged Servant,

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>WELL Sirs! You have seen <HI>Virginia</HI> die! Ye Powers</L>
<L>The mighty difference between her Time and ours.</L>
<L><HI>Virginius,</HI> an old Captain was of <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Who absent with his City Bands from home;</L>
<L>Heard a Hot Courtier would his Girl engage;</L>
<L>When posting back to <HI>Rome</HI> in mighty Rage</L>
<L>This Son of Hector, like a surly Bully,</L>
<L>Kills his poor Child to disappoint her Cully.</L>
<L>That 'tis far otherwise with us is plain,</L>
<L>While City Captain here makes short Campaign,</L>
<L>In <HI>Bunhill</HI>-Fields subduing <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></L>
<L>How oft has Courtier maul'd both Wife and Daughter?</L>
<L>Yet no such bloody Business follow'd after.</L>
<L>There's something in <HI>Virginia</HI> stranger still,</L>
<L>Whom at her own request her Sire did kill,</L>
<L>For fear she should be pleas'd against her Will,</L>
<L>When will a Damsel of our City strain</L>
<L>Resolve to die e'er Ease her Lover's Pain?</L>
<L>But now to finish all in a more serious vein,</L>
<L><HI>Virginia</HI>'s Death did Liberty restore,</L>
<L>As from <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s Tomb it rose before,</L>
<L>When <HI>Caesar</HI> afterwards enslav'd the State,</L>
<L><HI>Porcia</HI> rous'd <HI>Brutus</HI> to great <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Fate.</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Rome</HI> in Heroes always did abound,</L>
<L>Still from her Women she lost Freedom found.</L>
<L>So fair <HI>Britannia</HI> o'er the World is fam'd</L>
<L>For Men of dauntless Spirits and untam'd;</L>
<L>But yet when by her Folly or her Fate,</L>
<L>Her Liberty was in a dangerous State.</L>
<L>The Blessing ne'er cou'd be secur'd by Man,</L>
<L>But Heav'n reserv'd th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immortal Fame for <HI>Anne.</HI></L>
