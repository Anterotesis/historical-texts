§ I. HAVING thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI.</NOTE> to the best of our power, given
a faithful and exact detail of every material
event in which Great Britain was concerned either at
home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1756.</NOTE> or in her settlements abroad, during the greatest
part of the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six,
we shall now return to Europe, and endeavour to explain
the beginning of a bloody war in Germany, which then
seemed to have become the chief object of the British coun∣cils.
On the eve of a rupture between France and Eng∣land,
it was natural for his B—M—to provide for
the safety of his e—I d—s, the only quarter by
which he was at all accessible to the efforts of the enemy,
who he foresaw would not fail to annoy him through that
avenue. He at that time stood upon indifferent terms with
the K—of P—, who was considered as a partisan and
ally of France; and he knew that the house of Austria
alone would not be sufficient to support him against two
such powerful antagonists. In this emergency he had re∣course
to the Empress of Russia, who, in consequence of
a large subsidy granted by England, engaged to furnish a
strong body of forces for the defence of H—r. His
P—n Majesty, startled at the conditions of this treaty,
took an opportunity to declare that he would not suffer
foreign forces of any nation to enter the empire, either as
principals or auxiliaries: a declaration which probably
flowed from a jealousy and aversion he had conceived to the
court of Petersburgh, as well as from a resolution he had
formed of striking some great stroke in Germany, without
any risque of being restricted or controlled. He knew he
should give umbrage to the French King, who had already
made preparations for penetrating into Westphalia: but
he took it for granted he should be able to exchange his
connections with France for an alliance with Great Bri∣tain,
which would be much less troublesome, and much
more productive of advantage: indeed, such an alliance
was the necessary consequence of his declaration. Had
his B—ck M—y made a requisition of the Russian
auxiliaries, he must have exposed himself to the resentment
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
of a warlike monarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III.</NOTE> who hovered on the skirts of his
electorate at the head of one hundred and forty thousand
men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1756.</NOTE> and could have subdued the whole country in one
week; and if he forbore to avail himself of the treaty with
the Czarina, he did not know how soon the K—g of
P—a might be reconciled to his most Christian Majesty's
design of invasion. As for the Empress-Queen, her atten∣tion
was engrossed by schemes for her interest or preserva∣tion;
and her hands so full, that she either could not or
would not fulfil the engagements she had contracted with
her former and firmest allies. In these circumstances the
K—g of E—d fought and obtained the alliance of
P—a, which, to the best of our comprehension, en∣tailed
upon G—B—the enormous burthen of ex∣travagant
subsidies, together with the intolerable expense
of a continental war, without being productive of one ad∣vantage
either positive or negative to E—d or H—r.
On the contrary, this connection threw the Empress-Queen
into the arms of France, whose friendship she
bought at the expense of the Barrier in the Netherlands,
acquired with in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inite labour, by the blood and treasure of
the maritime powers: it gave birth to a confederacy of
despotic princes; su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icient, if their joint force was fully
exerted, to overthrow the liberties of all the free states in
Europe; and, after all, H—r has been over-run, and
subdued by the enemy; and the K—g of P—a put
to the ban of the Empire. All these consequences are,
we apprehend, fairly deducible from the resolution which
his P—n M—y took, at this juncture, to precipitate
a war with the house of Austria. The apparent motives
that prompted him to this measure we shall presently ex∣plain.
In the mean time, the defensive treaty between
the Empress-Queen and France was no sooner rati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied,
than the Czarina was invited to accede to the alliance,
and a private minister sent from Paris to Petersburgh, to
negociate the conditions of this accession, which the Em∣press
of Russia accordingly embraced: a circumstance
so agreeable to the court of Versailles, that the Marquis
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
de L'Hopital was immediately appointed ambassador ex∣traordinary
and plenipotentiary to the court of Russia.
Applications were likewise made to the courts of Madrid
and Turin, solliciting their concurrence; but their Catho∣lick
and Sardinian Majesties wisely resolved to observe a
neutrality. At the same time intrigues were begun by
the French emissaries in the senate of Sweden, in order to
kindle up a war between that nation and Prussia; and
their endeavours succeeded in the sequel, even contrary to
the inclination of their sovereign. At present a plot was
discovered for altering the form of government, by in∣creasing
the power of the crown; and several persons of
rank being convicted upon trial, were beheaded as prin∣cipals
in this conspiracy. Although it did not appear that
the King or Queen was at all concerned in the scheme,
his Swedish Majesty thought himself so hardly treated by
the Diet, that he threatened to resign his royalty, and re∣tire
into his own hereditary dominions. This design was
extremely disagreeable to the people in general, who
espoused his cause in opposition to the Diet, by whom
they conceived themselves more oppressed than they should
have been under an unlimited monarchy.</P>
<P>§ II. The King of Prussia, alarmed at these formidable
alliances, ordered all his forces to be completed, and held
in readiness to march at the first notice; and a report was
industriously circulated, that by a secret article in the late
treaty between France and the House of Austria, these
two powers had obliged themselves to destroy the protes∣tant
religion, and overturn the freedom of the Empire, by
a forced election of a King of the Romans. The cry of
religion was no impolitick measure; but it no longer pro∣duced
the same e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ects as in times past. Religion was made
a pretence on both sides: for the partizans of the Empress-Queen
insinuated, on all occasions, that the ruin of the ca∣tholick
faith in Germany was the principal object of the
new alliance between the Kings of Great Britain and
Prussia. It was in consequence of such suggestions, that
his Britannick Majesty ordered his electoral minister at
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
the Diet to deliver a memorial to all the ministers at Ratis∣bon,
expressing his surprise to find the treaty he had con∣cluded
with the King of Prussia industriously represented
as a ground of apprehension and umbrage, especially for
religion. He observed, that as France had made open dis∣positions
for invading the electorate of Hanover, and dis∣turbing
the peace of the Empire; that as he had been
denied, by the Empress-Queen, the succours stipulated in
treaties of alliance; and as he was refused assistance by
certain states of the Empire, who even seemed disposed to
favour such a diversion; he had, in order to provide for
the security of his own dominions, to establish peace and
tranquillity in the Empire, and maintain its system and
privileges, without any prejudice to religion, concluded a
defensive treaty with the King of Prussia: that, by this
instance of patriotic zeal for the welfare of Germany, he
had done an essential service to the Empress-Queen, and
performed the part which the head of the Empire, in
dignity and duty, ought to have acted: that time would
demonstrate how little it was the interest of the Empress-Queen
to engage in a strict alliance with a foreign power,
which, for upwards of two centuries, had ravaged the
principal provinces of the Empire, maintained repeated
wars against the archducal house of Austria, and always
endeavoured, as it suited her views, to excite distrust and
dissention among the princes and states that compose the
Germanick body.</P>
<P>§ III. The court of Vienna formed two considerable
armies in Bohemia and Moravia; yet pretended that they
had nothing in view but self-preservation, and solemnly
disclaimed both the secret article, and the design which
had been laid to their charge. His most Christian Majes∣ty
declared, by his minister at Berlin, that he had no other
intention but to maintain the public tranquillity of Eu∣rope;
and this being the sole end of all his measures, he
beheld with surprise the preparations and armaments of
certain potentates: that, whatever might be the view with
which they were made, he was disposed to make use of the
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
power which God had put into his hands, not only to
maintain the public peace of Europe against all who
should attempt to disturb it, but also to employ all his
forces, agreeably to his engagements, for the assistance of
his ally, in case her dominions should be attacked: finally,
that he would act in the same manner in behalf of all the
other powers with whom he was in alliance. This inti∣mation
made very little impression upon the King of Prus∣sia,
who had already formed his plan, and was determined
to execute his purpose. What his original plan might have
been, we shall not pretend to disclose; nor do we believe
he imparted it to any confident or ally. It must be con∣fessed,
however, that the intrigues of the court of Vienna
furnished him with a specious pretence for drawing the
sword, and commencing hostilities. The Empress-Queen
had some reason to be jealous of such a formidable neigh∣bour.
She remembered his irruption into Bohemia, in the
year one thousand seven hundred and forty-four, at a time
when she thought that country, and all her other domi∣nions,
secure from his invasion by the treaty of Breslau,
which she had in no particular contravened. She caballed
against him in different courts of Europe: she concluded
a treaty with the Czarina, which, though seemingly de∣fensive,
implied an intention of making conquests upon
this monarch: she endeavoured to engage the King of
Poland, Elector of Saxony, as a contracting power in this
con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ederacy; and, if he had not been afraid of a sudden
visit from his neighbour of l'russia, it cannot be supposed
but he would have been pleased to contribute to the humi∣liation
of a prince who had once before, without the least
provocation, driven him from his dominions, taken posses∣sion
of his capital, routed his troops, and obliged him to
pay a million of crowns, to indemnify him for the expense
of this expedition: but he carefully avoided taking such a
step as might expose him to another invasion, and even re∣fused
to accede to the treaty of Petersburgh, though it was
expressly defensive; the <HI>Casus Foederis</HI> being his Prussian
Majesty's attacking either of the contracting pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties. It
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
appears, however, that Count de Bruhl, prime mini∣ster
and favourite of the King of Poland, had, in con∣junction
with some of the Austrian ministers, carried on
certain scandalous intrigues, in order to embroil the
King of Prussia with the Empress of Russia, between
whom a misunderstanding had long subsisted.</P>
<P>§ IV. His Prussian Majesty perceiving the military pre∣parations
of the court of Vienna, and having obtained in∣telligence
of their secret negociations with different pow∣ers
in Europe, ordered M. de Klingraafe, his minister at
the Imperial court, to demand whether all those prepa∣rations
of war, on the frontiers of Silesia, were designed
against him, and what were the intentions of her Imperial
Majesty? To this demand the Empress replied, That in
the present juncture she had found it necessary to make
armaments, as well for her own defence as for that of her
allies; but that they did not tend to the prejudice of any
person or state whatever. The King, far from being
satisfied with this general answer, sent fresh orders to
Klingraafe, to represent, That after the King had dis∣sembled,
as long as he thought consistent with his safety
and honour, the bad designs imputed to the Empress would
not suffer him longer to disguise his sentiments; that he
was acquainted with the offensive projects which the two
courts had formed at Petersburgh; that he knew they had
engaged to attack him suddenly with an army of two
hundred thousand men; a design which would have been
executed in the spring of the year, had not the Russian
forces wanted recruits, their fleet mariners, and Livonia
a sufficient quantity of corn for their support; that he con∣stituted
the Empress arbiter of peace or war: if she desired
the former, he required a clear and formal declaration, or
positive assurance, that she had no intention to attack him,
either this year or the next; but he should look upon an
ambiguous answer as a declaration of war; and he called
heaven to witness, that the Empress alone would be guilty
of the innocent blood that should be spilt, and all the
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
dismal consequences that would atten the commission of
hostilities.</P>
<P>§ V. A declaration of this nature might have provoked
a less haughty court than that of Vienna, and, indeed,
seems to have been calculated on purpose to exasperate the
pride of her Imperial Majesty, whose answer he soon re∣ceived,
to this effect: That his Majesty the King of Prussia
had already been employed, for some time, in all kinds of
the most considerable preparations of war, and the most
disquieting with regard to the public tranquillity, when
he thought fit to demand explanations of her Majesty,
touching the military dispositions that were making in her
dominions; dispositions on which she had not resolved till
after the preparations of his Prussian Majesty had been
made; that though her Majesty might have declined
explaining herself on those subjects, which required no
explanation, she had been pleased to delcare, with her own
mouth, to M. de Klingraafe, that the critical state of
publick affairs rendered the measures she was taking
absolutely necessary for her own safety, and that of her
allies; but that, in other respects, they tended to the
prejudice of no person whatsoever: that her Imperial Ma∣jesty
had undoubtedly a right to form what judgment she
pleased on the circumstances of the times; and likewise
that it belonged to none but herself to estimate her own
danger: that her declaration was so clear, she never
imagined it could be thought otherwise: that being ac∣customed
to receive, as well as to practise the decorums
which sovereigns owe to each other, she could not hear
without astonishment and sensibility the contents of the
memorial now presented by M. de Klingraafe; so extra∣ordinary,
both in the matter and expressions, that she would
find herself under a necessity of transgressing the bounds of
that moderation which she had prescribed to herself, were
she to answer the whole of its contents: nevertheless, she
thought proper to declare, that the information communi∣cated
to his Prussian Majesty of an offensive alliance against
him subsisting between herself and the Empress of Russia,
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
together with the circumstances and pretended stipulations
of that alliance, were absolutely false and forged, for no
such treaty did exist, or ever had existed. She concluded
with observing, that this declaration would enable all
Europe to judge of what weight and quality those dreadful
events were which Klingraafe's memorial announced; and
to perceive that, in any case, they could not be imputed
to her Imperial Majesty. This answer, though seemingly
explicit, was not deemed sufficiently categorical, or at least
not suitable to the purposes of the King of Prussia, who,
by his resident at Vienna, once more declared, that if the
Empress-Queen would sign a positive assurance that she
would not attack his Prussian Majesty either this year or
the next, he would direclty withdraw his troops, and let
things be resotred to their former footing. This demand
was evaded, on pretence that such an assurance could not
be more binding than the solmn treaty by which he was
already secured; a treaty which the Empress-Queen had
no intention to violate. But, before an answer could be
delivered, the King had actually invaded Saxony, and pub∣lished
his declaration against the court of Vienna. The
court of Vienna believing that the King of Prussia was
bent upon employing his arms somewhere; being piqued
at the dictatorial manner in which his demands were con∣veyed;
unwilling to lay themselves under further re∣strictions;
apprehensive of giving umbrage to their allies,
and confident of having provided for their own security,
resolved to run the risque of his resentment, not without
hopes of being indemnified in the course of the war for
that part of Silesia which the Queen had been obliged to
cede in the treaty of Breslau.</P>
<P>§ VI. Both sides being thus prepared, and perhaps
equally eager for action, the King of Prussia would no
longer suspend his operations, and the storm first fell upon
Saxony. He resolved to penetrate through that country
into Bohemia, and even to take possession of it as a frontier,
as well as for the convenience of ingress and egress to and
from the Austrian dominions. Besides, he had reason to
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
believe the King of Poland, Elector of Saxony, was con∣nected
with the Czarina and the Empress-Queen; there∣fore,
he thought it would be impolitick to leave that
prince in any condition to give him the least disturbance.
His army entered the Saxon territory towards the latter
end of August, when he published a declaration, importing
that the unjust conduct and dangerous views of the court
of Vienna against his Majesty's dominions laid him under
the necessity of taking proper measures for protecting his
territories and subjects; that for this purpose he could not
forbear taking the disagreeable resolution to enter with his
troops the hereditary dominions of his Majesty the King of
Poland, Elector of Saxony: but he protested before God
and man, that on account of his personal esteem and
friendship for that prince, he would not have proceeded to
this extremity, had he not been forced to it by the laws of
war, the fatality of the present conjuncture, and the ne∣cessity
of providing for the defence and security of his
subjects. He reminded the publick of the tenderness with
which he had treated the Elector of Saxony, during the
campaign of the year one thousand seven hundred and
forty-four, and of the bad consequences resulting to that
monarch from his engagements with the enemies of Prussia.
He declared that the apprehensions of being exposed again
to such enterprises had obliged him to take those precau∣tions
which prudence dictated: but he protested in the
most solemn manner, that he had no hostile views against
his Polish Majesty, or his dominions; that his troops did
not enter Saxony as enemies, and he had taken care that
they should observe the best order and the most exact dis∣cipline:
that he desired nothing more ardently than the
happy minute that should procure him the satisfaction of
restoring to his Polish Majesty his hereditary dominions,
which he had seised only as a sacred depositum. By his
minister at Dresden, he had demanded a free passage for
his forces through the Saxon dominions; and this the
King of Poland was ready to grant, with reasonable limi∣tations,
to be settled by commissaries appointed for that
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
purpose. But these were formalities which did not at all
suit with his Prussian Majesty's disposition or design. Even
before this requisition was made, a body of his troops,
amounting to fifteen thousand, under the command of
Prince Ferdinand, brother to the Duke of Brunswick,
took possession of Leipsick on the twentieth day of Septem∣ber.
Here he published a declaration, signifying that it
was his Prussian Majesty's intention to consider and defend
the inhabitants of that Electorate as if they were his own
subjects; and that he had given precise orders to his troops
to observe the most exact discipline. As the first mark of
his affection, he ordered them to provide the army with all
sorts of provision, according to a certain rate, on pain of
military execution. That same evening notice was given
to the corporation of merchants, that their deputies should
pay all taxes and customs to the King of Prussia: then he
took possession of the custom-house and excise-office, and
ordered the magazines of corn and meal to be opened for
the use of his soldiers.</P>
<P>§ VII. The King of Poland, apprehensive of such a
visitation, had ordered all the troops of his electorate to
leave their quarters, and assemble in a strong camp marked
out for them between Pirna and Konigstein, which was
entrenched, and provided with a numerous train of ar∣tillery.
Thither the King of Poland repaired, with his
two sons Xaverius and Charles; but the Queen and the
rest of the royal family remained at Dresden. Of this
capital his Prussian Majesty, with the bulk of his army,
took possession on the eighth day of September, when he
was visited by Lord Stormont, the English ambassador at
that court, accompanied by Count Salmour, a Saxon
minister, who, in his master's name, proposed a neutrality.
The King of Prussia professed himself extremely well pleased
with the proposal; and, as the most convincing proof of
his neutrality, desired the King of Poland would separate
his army, by ordering his troops to return to their former
quarters. His Polish Majesty did not like to be so tutored
in his own dominions: he depended for his own safety
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
more upon the valour and attachment of his troops thus
assembled, than upon the friendship of a prince who had
invaded his dominions, and sequestered his revenue with∣out
provocation; and he trusted too much to the situation
of his camp at Pirna, which was deemed impregnable. In
the mean time, the King of Prussia fixed his head-quarters
at Seidlitz, about half a German league distant from Pirna,
and posted his army in such a manner as to be able to in∣tercept
all convoys of provision designed for the Saxon
camp: his forces extended on the right towards the fron∣tiers
of Bohemia, and the vanguard actually seised the passes
that lead to the circles of Satzer and Leutmeritz in that
kingdom; while Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick marched
with a body of troops along the Elbe, and took post at
this last place without opposition. At the same time
the King covered his own dominions, by assembling two
considerable bodies in Upper and Lower Silesia, which
occupied the passes that communicated with the circles of
Buntzlau and Koningsgratz. Hostilities were commenced
on the thirteenth day of September by a detachment of
Prussian hussars, who attacked an Austrian escorte to a
convoy of provisions, designed for the Saxon camp; and
having routed them, carried off a considerable number of
loaded waggons. The magazines at Dresden were filled
with an immense quantity of provision and forage for the
Prussian army, and the bakers were ordered to prepare a
vast quantity of bread, for which purpose thirty new ovens
were erected. When the King of Prussia first arrived at
Dresden, he lodged at the house of the Countess Moczinska;
and gave orders that the Queen and royal family of Poland
should be treated with all due veneration and respect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Majesty seems to have abated of this respect in the sequel, if we may believe the assertions of his Polish Majesty's Queen, and the court of Vienna, who affirmed, that sentinels were posted within the palace where the Queen and royal family resided; as also at the door of the secret cabinet, where the papers relating to foreign transactions were deposited. The keys of this cabi∣net were seised, and all the writings demanded. The whole Saxon ministry were discharged from their respective employments, and a new commission was established by the King of Prussia for the administration of affairs in general. When the Queen entreated this prince to remove the sentinels posted within the palace, and contiguous passages, agreeably to his assurances that all due re∣spect should be observed towards the royal family, the King ordered the guards to be doubled, and sent an officer to demand of her Majesty the keys of the secret cabinet. The Queen obtained this officer's consent, that the doors should be sealed up; but afterwards he returned with orders to break them open: then her Majesty, placing herself before the door, said, she trusted so much to the promise of the King of Prussia, that she could not believe he had given such orders. The officer declaring that h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s orders were positive, and that he durst not disobey them, she continued in the same place, declaring, that if violence was to be used, he must begin with her. The officer returning to acquaint the King with what had passed, her Majesty conjured the ministers of Prussia and England to remind his majesty of his promise, but her re∣presentations had no effect; the officer returned with fresh orders to use force, in spite of the opposition she might make against it in person. The Queen, finding herself in danger of her life, at length withdrew: the doors were forced, the chests broke open, and all the papers seised.</NOTE>:
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
even while the Saxon camp was blocked up on every side,
he sometimes permitted a waggon, loaded with fresh pro∣vision
and game, to pass unmolested for the use of his
Polish Majesty.</P>
<P>§ VIII. During these transactions the greatest part of
the Prussian army advanced into Bohemia, under the com∣mand
of Veldt-Mareschal Keith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brother to the Earl Marischal of Scotland, a gentleman who had sig∣nalised himself as a general in the Russian army, and was accounted one of the best officers of his time; no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more admired for his genius, than amiable in his disposition.</NOTE>, who reduced the town
and palace of Tetchen, took possession of all the passes,
and encamped near Aussig, a small town in Bohemia, at
no great distance from the Imperial army, amounting to
fifty thousand men, commanded by Count Brown, an offi∣cer
of Irish extract, who had often distinguished himself
in the field by his courage, vigilance, and conduct. His
Prussian Majesty having left a considerable body of troops
for the blockade of Pirna, assumed in person the command
of Mareschal Keith's corps, and advanced to give battle
to the enemy. On the twenty-ninth day of September he
formed his troops in two columns, and in the evening
arrived with his van at Welmina, from whence he saw
the Austrian army posted with its right at Lowoschutz,
and its left towards the Egra. Having occupied with six
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
battalions a hollow way, and some rising grounds, which
commanded the town of Lowoschutz, he remained all
night under arms at Welmina; and on the first day of
October, early in the morning, formed his whole army in
order of battle; the first line, consisting of the infantry,
occupying two hills, and a bottom betwixt them; the
second line being formed of some battalions, and the third
composed of the whole cavalry. The Austrian general had
taken possession of Lowoschutz, with a great body of in∣fantry,
and placed a battery of cannon in front of the town:
he had formed his cavalry chequerwise, in a line between
Lowoschutz and the village of Sanschitz; and posted
about two thousand Croats and irregulars in the vineyards
and avenues on his right. The morning was darkened
with a thick fog, which vanished about seven: then the
Prussian cavalry advanced to attack the enemy's horse, but
received such a fire from the irregulars, posted in vineyards
and ditches, as well as from a numerous artillery, that
they were obliged to retire for protection to the rear of
the Prussian infantry and cannon. There being formed,
and led back to the charge, they made an impression on
the Austrian cavalry, and drove the irregulars and other
bodies of infantry from the ditches, defiles, and vine∣yards
which they possessed: but they suffered so severely
in this dangerous service, that the King ordered them to
reascend the hill, and take post again behind the infan∣try,
from whence they no more advanced. In the mean
time a furious cannonading was maintained on both sides
with considerable effect. At length the left of the Prussian
infantry was ordered to attack the town of Lowoschutz
in flank; but met with a very warm reception, and, in
all likelihood, would have miscarried, had not Veldt-Mareschal
Keith headed them in person: when he drew
his sword, and told them he would lead them on, he was
given to understand, that all their powder and shot was
exhausted; he turned immediately to them with a chear∣ful
countenance, said he was very glad they had no more
ammunition, being well assured the enemy would not
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
withstand them at push of bayonet; so saying, he advanced
at their head, and driving the Austrians from Lowoschutz,
set the suburbs on fire. Their infantry had been al∣ready
obliged to quit the eminence on the right; and
now their whole army retired to Budin, on the other side
of the Egra. Some prisoners, colours, and pieces of can∣non,
were taken on both sides; and the loss of each might
amount to two thousand five hundred killed and wounded:
so that, on the whole, it was a drawn battle, though both
generals claimed the victory. The detail of the action,
published at Berlin, declares that the King of Prussia not
only gained the battle, but that same day established his
head quarters at Lowoschutz: whereas the Austrian ga∣zette
affirms, that the Mareschal Count Brown obliged
his Prussian Majesty to retire, and remained all night on
the field of battle; but next day, finding his troops in
want of water, he repaired to the camp of Budin. If
the battle was at all decisive, the advantage certainly fell
to the Austrians; for his Prussian Majesty, who, in all
probability, had hoped to winter at Prague, was obliged,
by the opposition he met with, to resign this plan, and
retreat before winter into the electorate of Saxony.</P>
<P>§ IX. The Prussian army having rejoined that body
which had been left to block up the Saxons at Pirna,
his Polish Majesty and his troops were reduced to such
extremity of want, that it became indispensibly necessary
either to attempt an escape, or surrender to the King of
Prussia. The former part of the alternative was chosen,
and the plan concerted with Count Brown, the Austrian
general, who, in order to facilitate the execution, advanced
privately with a body of troops to Lichtendorf, near
Schandau; but the junction could not be effected. On
the fourteenth day of October the Saxons threw a bridge
of boats over the Elbe, near Konigstein, to which castle
they removed all their artillery; then striking their tents
in the night, passed the river undiscovered by the enemy.
They continued to retreat with all possible expedition; but
the roads were so bad, they made little progress. Next
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
day, when part of them had advanced about half way up a
hill opposite to Konigstein, and the rest were entangled in a
narrow plain, where there was no room to act, they per∣ceived
that the Prussians were in possession of all the passes,
and found themselves surrounded on every side, fainting
with hunger and fatigue, and destitute of every conve∣nience.
In this deplorable condition they remained, when
the King of Poland, from the fortress of Konigstein, sent
a letter to his general, the Veldt-Mareschal Count Rutow∣ski,”
vesting him with full and discretionary power to sur∣render,
or take such other measures as he should judge
most conducive to the preservation of the officers and sol∣diers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<OPENER>The letter was to the following effect:
“Veldt-Mareschal Count Rutowski,</OPENER>
<P>“IT is not without extreme sorrow I understand the deplorable situation which a chain of misfortunes has reserved for you, the rest of my generals, and my whole army: but we must acquiesee in the dispensations of Providence, and console ourselves with the rectitude of our sentiments and intentions. They would force me, it seems, as you give me to understand by Major-General the Baron de Dyherrn, to submit to conditions the more s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vere, in proportion as the circumstances are become more necessi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous. I cannot hear them men∣tioned. I am a free monarch; such I will live; such I will die; and I will both live and die with honour. The fate of my army I leave wholly to your discretion. Let your council of war determine whether you must surrender prisoners of war, fall by the sword, or die by famine. May your resolutions, if possible, be conducted by humanity: whatever they may be, I have no longer any share in them: and I declare you shall not be answerable for aught but one thing, namely not to carry arms against me or my allies.

<CLOSER><SIGNED>“AUGUSTUS, Rex”</SIGNED>
To the Veldt-Mareschal the Count Rutowski.</CLOSER>
</LETTER></NOTE>.
By this time Count Brown had retired to Budin,
so that there was no choice left. A capitulation was de∣manded:
but, in effect, the whole Saxon army was
obliged to surrender at discretion: and the soldiers were
afterwards, by compulsion, incorporated with the troops of
Prussia. The King of Poland being thus deprived of his
electoral dominions, his troops, arms, artillery, and am∣munition,
thought it high time to provide for his own
safety, and retired with all expedition to Poland. His
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Prussian Majesty cantoned his forces in the neighbour∣hood
of Seidlitz, and along the Elbe towards Dres∣den.
His other army, which had entered Bohemia, un∣der
the command of the Count de Schwerin, retired
to the confines of the county of Glatz, where they
were distributed in quarters of cantonment; so that
this short campaign was finished by the beginning of
November.</P>
<P>§ X. The King of Poland, in his distress, did not fail to
implore the assistance and mediation of neutral powers.
His minister at the Hague presented a memorial to the
States-General, complaining, that the invasion of Saxony
was one of those attacks against the law of nations, which,
from the great respect due to this law, demanded the as∣sistance
of every power interested in the preservation of its
own liberty and independency. He observed, that, from
the first glimpse of misunderstanding between the courts of
Vienna and Berlin, he had expressly enjoined his mini∣sters
at all the courts of Europe to declare, that it was
his firm resolution, in the present conjuncture of affairs,
to observe the strictest neutrality. He represented, that a
free and neutral state had been, in the midst of peace, in∣vaded
by an enemy, who disguised himself under the masque
of friendship, without alledging the least complaint,
or any pretension whatsoever; but founding himself solely
on his own convenience, made himself master, by armed
force, of all the cities and towns of the electorate, dis∣mantling
some, and fortifying others: that he had disarmed
the burghers; carried off the magistrates as hostages for
the payment of unjust and enormous contributions of pro∣visions
and forage; seised the coffers, confiscated the re∣venues
of the electorate, broke open the arsenals, and
transported the arms and artillery to his own town of
Magdeburgh; abolished the privy-council, and, instead
of the lawful government, established a directory,
which acknowledged no other law but his own arbitrary
will. He gave them to understand, that all these proceed∣ings
were no other than preliminaries to the unheared-of
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
treatment which was reserved for a queen, whose virtues
ought to have commanded respect, even from her enemies:
that, from the hands of that august princess, the archives
of the state were forced away by menaces and violences,
notwithstanding the security which her Majesty had pro∣mised
herself under the protection of all laws, human and
divine; and notwithstanding the repeated assurances given
by the King of Prussia, that not only her person, and the
place of her residence, should be absolutely safe, but that
even the Prussian garrison should be under her direction.
He observed, that a prince who declared himself protector
of the protestant religion had begun the war, by crushing
the very state to which that religion owes its establish∣ment,
and the preservation of its most invaluable rights:
that he had broke through the most respectable laws which
constitute the union of the Germanick body, under co∣lour
of a defence which the Empire stood in no need of, ex∣cept
against himself: that the King of Prussia, while he
insists on having entered Saxony as a friend, demands his
army, the administration of his dominions, and, in a word,
the sacrifice of his whole electorate; and that the Prussian
directory, in the declaration of motives, published under
the nose of a prince to whom friendship was pretended,
thought it superfluous to alledge even any pretext, to colour
the usurpation of his territories and revenues—Though
this was certainly the case, in his Prussian Majesty's first
exposition of motives, the omission was afterwards supplied,
in a subsequent memorial to the States-General; in which
he charged the King of Polan, as an accomplice in, if
not an accessary to the treaty of Petersburgh; and even
taxed him with having agreed to a partition of some Prussian
territories, when they should be conquered. This treaty
of partition, however, appears to have been made in time
of actual war, before all cause of dispute was removed by
the peace of Dresden.</P>
<P>§ XI. While the Austrian and Prussian armies were in
the field, their respective ministers were not idle at Ratis∣bon,
where three Imperial decrees were published against
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
his Prussian Majesty: the first, summoning that prince to
withdraw his troops from the electorate of Saxony: the se∣cond,
commanding all the vassals of the Empire employed
by the King of Prussia to quit that service immediately;
and the third, forbidding the members of the empire to
suffer any levies of soldiers, for the Prussian service, to be
raised within their respective jurisdictions. The French
minister declared to the diet, that the proceedings of his
Prussian Majesty having disclosed to the world the project
concerted between that prince and the King of England, to
excite in the Empire a religious war, which might be fa∣vourable
to their particular views, his most Christian Majesty,
in consequence of his engagement with the Empress-Queen,
and many other princes of the Empire, being resolved to
succour them in the most e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icacious manner, would forth∣with
send such a number of troops to their aid, as might
be thought necessary to preserve the liberty of the Ger∣manick
body. On the other hand, the Prussian minister
assured the diet, that his master would very soon produce
the proofs that were come to his hands of the plan con∣certed
by the courts of Vienna and Dresden, for the sub∣version
of his electoral house, and for imposing upon him
a yoke, which seemed to threaten the whole Empire.</P>
<P>§ XII. About the same time, the Russian resident at the
Hague communicated to the States-General a declaration
from his mistress, importing, that her Imperial Majesty hav∣ing
seen a memorial presented at the court of Vienna by the
King of Prussia's envoy extraordinary, was thereby con∣vinced
that this Prussian Majesty's intention was to attack the
territories of the Empress-Queen; in which case, she (the
Czarina) was inevitably obliged to succour her ally with
all her forces; for which end she had ordered all her troops
in Livonia to be forthwith assembled on the frontiers, and
hold themselves in readiness to march: that, moreover,
the Russian admiralty had been enjoined to provide imme∣diately
a su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icient number of gallies for transporting a large
body of troops to Lubeck. The ministers of the Empress-Queen,
both at the Hague and at London, delivered me∣morials
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
to the States-General and his Britannick Majesty,
demanding the succours which these two powers were
bound to afford the house of Austria by the treaty of Aix∣la-Chapelle;
but their High Mightinesses kept warily aloof,
by dint of evasion, and the King of Great-Britain was far
otherwise engaged. The invasion of Saxony had well nigh
produced tragedies in the royal family of France. The
Dauphiness, who was far advanced in her pregnancy, no
sooner learned the distressful circumstances of her parents,
the King and Queen of Poland, than she was seized with
violent fits, which occasioned a miscarriage, and brought
her life into the most imminent danger. The Prussian mi∣nister
was immediately ordered to quit Versailles; and di∣rections
were dispatched to the French minister at Berlin,
to retire from that court without taking leave. Finally,
the Emperour of Germany concluded a new convention
with the French King, regulating the succours to be de∣rived
from that quarter: he claimed, in all the usual forms,
the assistance of the Germanick body, as guarantee of the
pragmatick sanction and treaty of Dresden; and Sweden
was also addressed on the same subject.</P>
<P>§ XIII. The King of Prussia did not passively bear all
the imputations that were fixed upon his conduct. His
minister at the Hague presented a memorial, in answer to
that of the Saxon resident, in which he accused the court
of Dresden of having adopted every part of the scheme
which his enemies had formed for his destruction. He
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irmed that the Saxon ministers had, in all the courts of
Europe, played off every engine of unwarrantable politicks,
in order to pave the way for the execution of their project:
that they had endeavoured to give an odious turn to his
most innocent actions: that they had spared neither ma∣licious
insinuations, nor even the most atrocious calum∣nies,
to alienate all the world from his Majesty, and raise
up enemies against him every where. He said, he had re∣ceived
information that the court of Saxony intended to
let his troops pass freely, and afterwards wait for events of
which they might avail themselves, either by joining his
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
enemies, or making a diversion in his dominions: that in
such a situation he could not avoid having recourse to the
only means which were left him for preventing his inevi∣table
ruin, by putting it out of the power of Saxony to
increase the number of his enemies. He asserted, that
all the measures he had pursued in that electorate were but
the necessary consequences of the first resolution he was
forced to take for his own preservation: that he had done
nothing but deprived the court of Saxony of the means of
hurting him; and this had been done with all possible mo∣deration:
that the country enjoyed all the security and all
the quiet which could be expected in the very midst of
peace, the Prussian troops observing the most exact disci∣pline:
that all due respect was shown to the Queen of Po∣land,
who had been prevailed upon, by the most suitable
representations, to suffer some papers to be taken from the
Paper Office, of which his Prussian Majesty already had
copies; and thought it necessary, to ascertain the dan∣gerous
design of the Saxon ministry against him, to secure
the originals; the existence and reality of which might
otherwise have been denied. He observed that every man
has a right to prevent the mischief with which he is
threatened, and to retort it upon its author; and that
neither the constitutions nor the laws of the Empire could
obstruct the exertion of a right so superiour to all others as
that of self-preservation and self-defence; especially when
the depository of these laws is so closely united to the
enemy, as manifestly to abuse his power in her favour.</P>
<P>§ XIV. But the most important step which his Prussian
Majesty took in his own justification, was that of publish∣ing
another memorial, specifying the conduct of the courts
of Vienna and Saxony, and their dangerous designs against
his person and interest, together with the original docu∣ments
adduced as proofs of these sinister intentions. As a
knowledge of these pieces is requisite to form a distinct
idea of the motives which produced the dreadful war upon
the continent, it will not be amiss to usher the substance of
them to the reader's acquaintance. His Prussian Majesty
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
affirms, that to arrive at the source of the vast plan upon
which the courts of Vienna and Saxony had been em∣ployed
against him ever since the peace of Dresden, we
must trace it as far back as the war which preceded this
peace: that the fond hopes which the two allied courts
had conceived upon the success of the campaign in the year
one thousand seven hundred and forty-four gave occasion
to a treaty of eventual partition, stipulating that the court
of Vienna should possess the duchy of Silesia and the
county of Glatz; while the King of Poland, Elector of
Saxony, should share the duchies of Magdeburgh and
Croissen; the circles of Zullichow and Swibus, together
with the Prussian part of Lusatin: that after the peace of
Dresden, concluded in the year one thousand seven hun∣dred
and forty-five, there was no further room for a treaty
of this nature: yet the court of Vienna proposed to that
of Saxony a new alliance, in which the treaty of even∣tual
partition should be renewed: but this last thought it
necessary, in the first place, to give a greater consistency
to their plan, by grounding it upon an alliance between
the Empress-Queen and the Czarina. Accordingly these
two powers did, in fact, conclude a defensive alliance at
Petersburgh in the course of the ensuing year: but the
body or ostensible part of this treaty was composed merely
with a view to conceal from the knowledge of the
publick six secret articles, the fourth of which was level∣led
singly against Prussia, according to the exact copy of it,
which appeared among the documents. In this article,
the Empress-Queen of Hungary and Bohemia sets out
with a protestation, that she will religiously observe the
treaty of Dresden: but explains her real way of thinking
upon the subject, a little lower, in the following terms.
“If the King of Prussia should be the first to depart from
this peace, by attacking either her Majesty the Empress-Queen
of Hungary and Bohemia, or her Majesty the
Empress of Russia, or even the republick of Poland; in
all these cases, the rights of the Empress-Queen to Si∣lesia
and the county of Glatz would again take place,
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
and recover their full effect: the two contracting parties
should mutually assist each other with sixty thousand men
to atchieve these conquests.” The King observes upon
this article, that every war which can arise between him
and Russia, or the republick of Poland, would be looked
upon as a manifest infraction of the peace of Dresden,
and a revival of the rights of the house of Austria to Silesia;
though neither Russia nor the republick of Poland is at all
concerned in the treaty of Dresden; and though the latter,
with which the King lived in the most intimate friendship,
was not even in alliance with the court of Vienna: that,
according to the principles of the law of nature, received
among all civilised nations, the most the court of Vi∣enna
could be authorised to do in such cases, would be
to send those succours to her allies which are due to them
by treaties, without her having the least pretense, on that
account, to free herself from the particular engagements
subsisting between her and the King; he appealed, there∣fore,
to the judgment of the impartial world, whether in
this secret article the contracting powers had kept with∣in
the bounds of a de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensive alliance; or whether this
article did not rather contain a plan of an offensive al∣liance
against the King of Prussia. He affirmed it was
obvious, from this article, that the court of Vienna had
prepared three pretences for the recovery of Silesia; and
that she thought to attain her end, either by provoking the
King to commence hostilities against her, or to kindle a
war between his Majesty and Russia by her secret intrigues
and machinations: he alledged that the court of Sax∣ony,
being invited to accede to this alliance, eagerly ac∣cepted
the invitation; furnished its ministers at Peters∣burgh
with full powers for that purpose; and ordered them
to declare that their master was not only ready to accede
to the treaty itself, but also to the secret article against
Prussia; and to join in the regulations made by the two
courts, provided e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ectual measures should be taken, as
well for the security of Saxony, as for its indemnification
and recompense, in proportion to the efforts and progress
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
that might be made: that the court of Dresden declared,
if upon any fresh attack from the King of Prussia the
Empress-Queen should, by their assistance, not only re∣conquer
Silesia, and the county of Glatz, but also reduce
him within narrower bounds, the King of Poland, as
Elector of Saxony, would abide by the partition formerly
stipulated between him and the Empress-Queen. He
also declared that Count Loss, the Saxon minister at Vi∣enna,
was charged to open a private negociation for settling
an eventual partition of the conquest which might be
made on Prussia, by laying down, as the basis of it, the
treaty of Leipsick, signed on the eighteenth day of May, in
the year one thousand seven hundred and forty-five, as
would appear by the documents affixed. He owned it had
been supposed, through the whole of this negociation,
that the King of Prussia should be the aggressor against
the court of Vienna; but he insisted, that even in this
case the King of Poland could have no right to make con∣quests
on his Prussian Majesty. He likewise acknowledged
that the court of Saxony had not yet acceded in form to
the treaty of Petersburgh; but he observed, its allies were
given to understand again and again, that it was ready to
accede without restriction, whenever this could be done
without risque; and the advantages to be gained should be
secured in its favour: circumstances proved by divers au∣thentick
documents, particularly by a letter from Count
Fleming to Count de Bruhl, informing him that Count
Uhlefield had charged him to represent afresh to his court,
that they could not take too secure measures against the
ambitious views of the King of Prussia; that Saxony, in
particular, ought to be cautious, as being the most exposed:
that it was of the highest importance to strengthen their
old engagements upon the footing proposed by the late
Count de Harrach in the year one thousand seven hundred
and forty-five; a step which might be taken on occasion
of his Polish Majesty's accession to the treaty of Peters∣burgh.
The answer of Count Bruhl to this dispatch im∣ported,
That the King of Poland was not averse to treat
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
in the utmost secresy with the court of Vienna about
succours, by private and confidential declarations relating
to the fourth secret article of the treaty of Petersburgh,
on condition of reasonable terms and advantages, which
in this case ought to be granted to his Majesty. He quoted
other dispatches, to prove the unwillingness of his Polish
Majesty to declare himself, until the King of Prussia should
be attacked, and his forces divided; and that this scruple
was admitted by the allies of Saxony. From these pre∣misses
he deduced this inference, that the court of Dresden,
without having acceded in form to the treaty of Peters∣burgh,
was not less an accomplice in the dangerous designs
which the court of Vienna had grounded upon this treaty;
and that having been dispensed with from a formal concur∣rence,
it had only waited for that moment when it might,
without running any great risque, concur in effect, and
share the spoils of its neighbour. In expectation of this
period, he said, the Austrian and Saxon ministers laboured
in concert and underhand with the more ardour, to bring
the <HI>Casus Foederis</HI> into existence; for it being laid down as
a principle in the treaty, that any war whatever between
him and Russia would authorize the Empress-Queen to
retake Silesia, there was nothing more to be done but to
kindle such a war; for which purpose no method was found
more proper than that of embroiling the King with the
Empress of Russia; and to provoke that princess with all
forts of false insinuations, impostures, and the most atro∣cious
calumnies, in laying to his Majesty's charge a variety
of designs, sometimes against Russia, and even the person
of the Czarina; sometimes views upon Poland, and some∣times
intrigues in Sweden. By these and other such con∣trivances,
he affirmed they had kindled the animosity of
the Empress to such a degree, that in a council held in the
month of October, in the year one thousand seven hundred
and fifty-three, she had resolved to attack the King of Prussia,
without any further discussion, whether he should fall upon
any of the allies of Russia, or one of them should begin
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
with him: a resolution which for that time was frustrated
by their want of seamen and magazines; but the prepa∣rations
were continued, under pretence of keeping them∣selves
in a condition to fulfil their engagements contracted
in the last subsidiary convention with England; and when
all were finished, the storm would fall on the King of
Prussia.</P>
<P>§ XV. This is the substance of that famous memorial
published by his Prussian Majesty, to which the justifying
pieces or authentick documents were annexed; and to
which a circumstantial answer was exhibited by the parti∣sans
of her Imperial Majesty. Specious reasons may,
doubtless, be adduced on either side of almost any dispute,
by writers of ingenuity: but, in examining this contest,
it must be allowed that both sides adopted illicit practices.
The Empress-Queen and the Elector of Saxony had cer∣tainly
a right to form defensive treaties for their own pre∣servation;
and, without all doubt, it was their interest and
their duty to secure themselves from the enterprises of such
a formidable neighbour: but, at the same time, the con∣tracting
parties seem to have carried their views much
farther than defensive measures. Perhaps the court of
Vienna considered the cession of Silesia as a circumstance
altogether compulsive, and, therefore, not binding against
the rights of natural equity. She did not at all doubt that
the King of Prussia would be tempted by his ambition and
great warlike power to take some step which might be
justly interpreted into an infraction of the treaty of Dresden,
and in that case she was determined to avail herself of the
confederacy she had formed, that she might retrieve the
countries she had lost by the unfortunate events of the last
war, as well as bridle the dangerous power and disposition
of the Prussian monarch: and, in all probability, the King
of Poland, over and above the same consideration, was de∣sirous
of some indemnification for the last irruption into
his electoral dominions, and the great sums he had paid
for the subsequent peace. Whether they were authorised
by the law of nature and nations to make reprisals by an
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
actual partition of the countries they might conquer, sup∣posing
him to be the aggressor, we shal not pretend to
determine: but it does not at all appear that his Prussian
Majesty's danger was such as entitled him to take those
violent steps which he now attempted to justify. By this
time the flame of war was kindled up to a blaze that soon
filled the Empire with ruin and desolation; and the King
of Prussia had drawn upon himself the resentement of the
three greatest powers in Europe, who laid aside their form∣er
animosities, and every consideration of that balance
which it had cost such blood and treasure to preserve, in
order to conspire his destruction. The King himself
could not but foresee this confederacy, and know the
power it might exert: but probably he con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ided so much
in the number, the valour, and discipline of his troops; in
the skill of his officers; in his own conduct and activity;
that he hoped to crush the house of Austria by one rapid
endeavour at the latter end of the season, or at least esta∣blish
himself in Bohemia, before her allies could move to
her assistance. In this hope, however, he was disappointed
by the vigilance of the Austrian councils. He found the
Empress-Queen in a condition to make head against him
in every avenue to her dominions; and in a fair way of
being assisted by the circles of the empire. He saw himself
threatened with the vengeance of the Russian empress, and
the sword of France gleaming over his head, without any
prospect of assistance but that which he might derive from
his alliance with Great-Britain. Thus the K—of
E—d exchanged the alliance of R—, who was
his subsidiary, and the friendship of the Empress-Queen,
his old and natural ally, for a new connexion with his
P—n Majesty, who could neither act as an auxili∣ary
to G—B—n, nor as a protector to H—; and
for this connexion, the advantage of which was merely
negative, such a price was paid by E—d as had
never been given by any other po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate of Europe, even
for services of the greatest importance.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31"/>
§ XVI. About the latter end of November the Saxon
minister at Ratisbon delivered to the diet a new and ample
memorial, explaining the lamentable state of that electo∣rate,
and imploring afresh the assistance of the Empire.
The King of Prussia had also addressed a letter to the diet,
demanding succour of the several states, agreeably to their
guarantees of the treaties of Westphalia and Dresden:
but the minister of Mentz, as director of the diet, having
refused to lay it before that assembly, the minister of Bran∣denburgh
ordered it to be printed, and sent to his court for
further instructions. In the mean time, his Prussian Ma∣jesty
thought proper to intimate to the King and senate of
Poland, that should the Russian troops be permitted to
march through that kingdom, they might expect to see
their country made a scene of war and desolation. In
France the prospect of a general and sanguinary war did
not at all allay the disturbance which sprang from the dis∣sention
between the clergy and parliament, touching the
bull Unigenitus. The King being again brought over to
the ecclesiastical side of the dispute, received a brief from
the Pope, laying it down as a fundamental article, that
whosoever refuses to submit to the bull Unigenitus is in
the way to damnation: and certain cases are specified, in
which the sacraments are to be denied. The parliament
of Paris, considering this brief or bull as a direct attack
upon the rights of the Gallican church, issued an arret
or decree, suppressing the said bull; reserving to themselves
the right of providing against the inconveniencies with
which it might be attended; as well as the privilege to
maintain in their full force the prerogatives of the crown,
the power and jurisdiction of the bishops, the liberties of
the Gallican church, and the customs of the realm. The
King, dissatisfied with their interposition, declared his
design to hold a bed of justice in person at the palace.
Accordingly, on the twelfth day of November, the whole
body of his guards, amounting to ten thousand men, took
post in the city of Paris: and next day the King repaired
with the usual ceremony to the palace, where the bed of
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
justice was held: among other regulations, an edict was
issued for suppressing the fourth and fifth chambers of in∣quests,
the members of which had remarkably distinguished
themselves by their opposition to the bull Unigenitus.</P>
<P>§ XVII. In England, the dearth of corn, arising in a
great measure from the iniquitous practice of engrossing,
was so severely felt by the common people, that insurrec∣tions
were raised in Shropshire and Warwickshire by the
populace, in conjunction with the colliers, who seised by
violence all the provision they could find; pillaging with∣out
distinction the millers, farmers, grocers, and butch∣ers,
until they were dispersed by the gentlemen of the
country, at the heads of their tenants and dependants.
Disorders of the same nature were excited by the colliers
on the forest of Dean, and those employed in the works
in Cumberland. The corporations, noblemen, and
gentlemen, in different parts of the kingdom, exerted
themselves for the relief of the poor, who were greatly
distressed; and a grand council being assembled at St.
James's on the same subject, a proclamation was publish∣ed,
for putting the laws in speedy and effectual execution
against the forestallers and engrossers of corn.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The fear of an invasion having now subsided,
and Hanover being supposed in greater danger than Great-Britain,
the auxiliaries of that electorate were transported
from England to their own country. At the latter end of
the season, when the weather became severe, the inn-keepers
of England refused to admit the Hessian soldiers
into winter quarters, as no provision had been made for
that purpose by act of parliament; so that they were
obliged to hut their camp, and remain in the open fields
till January: but the rigour of this uncomfortable situa∣tion
was softened by the hand of generous charity, which
liberally supplied them with all manner of refreshment,
and other conveniencies: an humane interposition, which
rescued the national character from the imputation of
cruelty and ingratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33"/>
§ XIX. On the second day of December his Majesty
opened the session of Parliament with a speech that seemed
to be dictated by the genius of England. He expressed
his confidence, that, under the guidance of divine Pro∣vidence,
the union, fortitude, and affection of his people
would enable him to surmount all difficulties, and vindi∣cate
the dignity of his crown against the ancient enemy
of Great Britain. He declared that the succour and pre∣servation
of America constituted a main object of his at∣tention
and sollicitude; and observed, that the growing
dangers to which the British colonies might stand exposed,
from late losses in that country, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emanded resolutions of
vigour and dispatch. He said an adequate and firm defence
at home should maintain the chief place in his thoughts;
and in this great view he had nothing so much at heart as
to remove all grounds of dissatisfaction from his people: for
this end, he recommended to the care and diligence of the
parliament the framing of a national militia, planned and
regulated with equal regard to the just rights of his crown
and people; an institution which might become one good
resource in time of general danger. He took notice that
the unnatural union of councils abroad, the calamities
which, in consequence of this unhappy conjunction, mights,
by irruptions of foreign armies into the Empire, shake its
constitution, overturn its system, and threaten oppression
to the protestant interest on the continent, were events
which must sensibly affect the minds of the British nation,
and had fixed the eyes of Europe on this new and danger∣ous
crisis. He gave them to understand that the body of
his electoral troops, which were brought hither at the
desire of his parliament, he had now directed to return to
his dominions in Germany, relying with pleasure on the
spirit and zeal of his people, in defence of his person and
realm. He told the Commons that he confided in their
wisdom, for preferring more vigorous efforts, though more
expensive, to a less effectual, and therefore less <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rugal plan
of war; that he had placed before them the dangers and
necessities of the publick; and it was their duty to lay the
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
burthens they should judge unavoidable in such a manner
as would least disturb and exhaust his people. He ex∣pressed
his concern for the sufferings of the poor, arising
from the present dearth of corn, and for the disturbances
to which it had given rise; and exhorted his parliament
to consider of proper provisions for preventing the like
mischiefs hereafter. He concluded with remarking, that
unprosperous events of war in the Mediterranean had
drawn from his subjects signal proofs how dearly they
tendered the honour of his crown; therefore they could
not, on his part, fail to meet with just returns of unwea∣ried
care, and unceasing endeavours for the glory, prospe∣rity,
and happiness of his people.</P>
<P>§ XX. The King having retired from the House of
Peers, the speech was read by Lord Sandys, appointed to
act as speaker to that house; then Earl Gower moved for
an address, which, however, was not carried without
objection. In one part of it his Majesty was thanked
for having caused a body of electoral troops to come
into England at the request of his parliament; and this
article was disagreeable to those who had disapproved of
the request in the last session. They said they wished to
see the present address unanimously agreed to by the
Lords; a satisfaction they could not have if such a pa∣ragraph
should be inserted: for they still thought the
bringing over Hanoverian troops a preposterous measure;
because it had not only loaded the nation with an enor∣mous
expense, but also furnished the court of France with
a plausible pretence for invading the electorate, which
otherwise it would have no shadow of reason to attack;
besides, the expedient was held in reprobation by the
subjects in general, and such a paragraph might be con∣sidered
as an insult on the people. Notwithstanding these
exceptions, which did not seem to be very important,
the address, including this paragraph, was approved by a
great majority.</P>
<P>§ XXI. In the address of the Commons no such para∣graph
was inserted. As soon as the Speaker had recited
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
his Majesty's speech, Mr. C. Townshend proposed the
heads of an address, to which the House unanimously
agreed; and it was presented accordingly. This necessa∣ry
form was no sooner discussed, than the House, with a
warmth of humanity and benevolence suitable to such an
assembly, resolved itself into a committee, to deliberate
on that part of his Majesty's speech which related to the
dearth of corn that so much distressed the poorer class of
people. A bill was immediately framed, to prohibit, for
a time limited, the exportation of corn, malt, meal, flour,
bread, biscuit and starch; and a resolution unanimously
taken to address the Sovereign, that an embrago might be
forthwith laid upon all ships laden or to be laden with
these commodities to be exported from the ports of Great
Britain and Ireland. At the same time Vice-Admiral
Boscawen, from the board of admiralty, informed the
house, that the King and the board having been dissatis∣fied
with the conduct of Admiral Byng, in a late action
with the French fleet in the Mediterranean, and for the
appearance of his not having acted agreeably to his in∣structions
for the relief of Minorca, he was then in custody
of the Marshal of the Admiralty, in order to be tried by
a court-martial: that although this was no more than
what was usual in like cases, yet as Admiral Byng was
then a member of the house, and as his confinement
might detain him some time from his duty there, the
board of Admiralty thought it a respect due to the house
to inform them of the commitment and detainer of the
said Admiral. This message being delivered, the journal
of the house in relation to Rear-Admiral Knowles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rear-Admiral Knowles being, in the month of December, one thou∣sand seven hundred and forty-nine, tried at Deptford, before a court-martial, for his behaviour in and relating to an action which happened on the first day of October in the preceding year, between a British squadron under his com∣mand, and a squadron of Spain, the court was unanimously of opinion, that the said Knowles, while he was standing for the en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my, might, by a different disposition of his squadron, have begun the attack with six ships as early in the day as four of them were engaged; and that, therefore, by his neglecting so to do, he gave the enemy a manifest advantage: that the said Knowles remained on board the ship Cornwall with his flag, after she was disabled from continuing the action, though he might, upon her being disabled, have shifted his flag on board another ship; and the court were unanimously of opinion he ought to have done so, in order to have conducted and directed, during the whole action, the motions of the squadron entrusted to his care and conduct. Upon consideration of the whole conduct of the said Knowles, re∣lating to that action, the court did unanimously agree that he fell under part of the fourteenth article of the articles of war, namely, the word Negli∣gence, and no other; and also under the twenty-third article.—The court, therefore, unanimously adjudged that he should be reprimanded for not bringing up the squadron in closer order than he did, and not beginning the attack with as great force as he might have done; and also for not shifting his flag, upon the Cornwall's being disabled.</NOTE> was
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
read, and what Mr. Boscawen now communicated was also
inserted.</P>
<P>§ XXII. The committees of supply, and of ways and
means, being appointed, took into consideration the ne∣cessities
of the state, and made very ample provision for
enabling his Majesty to maintain the war with vigour.
They granted fifty-five thousand men for the sea service,
including eleven thousand four hundred and nineteen
marines; and for the land service forty-nine thousand
seven hundred and forty-nine effective men, comprehend∣ing
four thousand and eight invalids. The supply was
granted for the maintenance of these forces, as well as for
the troops of Hesse and Hanover; for the Ordnance; the
levy of new regiments; for assisting his Majesty in form∣ing
and maintaining an army of observation, for the just
and necessary defence and preservation of his electoral do∣minions,
and those of his allies; and towards enabling
him to fulfil his engagements with the King of Prussia;
for the security of the Empire against the irruption of fo∣reign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“Nothing could more gloriously evince the generosity of a British par∣liament than this interposition for defending the liberties of Germany, in conjunction with two electors only, against the sense of the other seven, and in direct opposition to the measures taken by the head of the Empire, who, in the sequel, stigmatised these two princes as rebels, and treated one of them as an out-law.</NOTE>
armies, as well as for the support of the common
cause; for building and repairs of ships, hiring transports,
payment of half-pay officers, and the pensions of widows;
for enabling his Majesty to discharge the like sum, raised
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
in pursuance of the act passed in the last session of parlia∣ment,
and charged upon the first aids or supplies to be
granted in this session, for enabling the governors and
guardians of the hospital for the maintenance and educati∣on
of exposed and deserted young children to receive all
such children, under a certain age, as should be brought to
the said hospital within the compass of one year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This charity, established by voluntary contribution, might, under proper restrictions, prove beneficial to the commonwealth, by rescuing deserted chil∣dren from misery and death, and qualifying them for being serviceable mem∣bers of the community; but since the liberality of parliament hath enabled the governors and corporation to receive all the children that are presented, with∣out question or limitation, the yearly expense hath swelled into a national grievance, and the humane purposes of the original institution are in a great measure deseated. Instead of an asylum for poor forlorn orphans and than∣doned soundlings, it is become a general receptacle for the ossspring of the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sso∣lute, who care not to work for the maintenance of their families. The hos∣pital itself is a plain edifice, well contrived for ecconomy and convenience, standing on the north side of the city, and a little detached from it, in an agree∣able and salubrious situation. The hall is adorned with some good paintings, the chapel is elegant, and the regulations are admirable.</NOTE>; for main∣taining
and supporting the new settlement of Nova-Scotia;
for reparing and finishing military roads; for making
good his Majesty's engagements with the Landgrave of
Hesse-Cassel; for the expense of marching, recruiting,
and remounting German troops in the pay of Great
Britain; for empowering his Majesty to desfray any ex∣traordinary
expenses of the war, incurred or to be in∣curred
for the service of the ensuing year, and to take
all such measures as might be necessary to disappoint or
defeat any enterprises or designs of his enemies, as the
exigency of affairs should require; for the payment of
such persons, in such a manner as his Majesty should di∣rect,
for the use and relief of his subjects in the several
provinces of North and South Carolina and Virginia, in
recompense for such services as, with the approbation
of his Majesty's commander in chief in America, they
respectively had performed, or should perform, either by
putting these provinces in a state of defence, or by acting
with vigour against the enemy; for enabling the East-In∣dia
company to defray the expense of a military force in
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
their settlements, to be maintained in them, in lieu of a
battalion of his Majesty's forces withdrawn from those forts
and factories; for the maintenance and support of the forts
on the coast of Africa; for widening the avenues, and ren∣dering
more safe and commodious the streets and passages
leading from Charing-cross to the two houses of parlia∣ment,
the courts of justice, and the new bridge at West∣minster<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bridge at Westminster may be considered as a national ornament. It was built at the public expense, from the neighbourhood of Westminster-Hall to the opposite side of the river, and consists of thirteen arches, con∣structed with equal elegance and simplicity.</NOTE>.
Such were the articles under which we may
specify the supplies of this year, on the whole amounting
to eight millions three hundred fifty thousand three hun∣dred
and twenty-five pounds, nine shillings, and three-pence.
It must be acknowledged, for the honour of the
administration, that the House of Commons could not
have exhibited stronger marks of their attachment to the
crown and person of their sovereign, as well as of their de∣sire
to see the force of the nation exerted with becoming
spirit. The sums granted by the committee of supply did
not exceed eight millions three hundred fifty thousand
three hundred twenty-five pounds, nine shillings and three
pence; the funds established amounted to eight millions
six hundred eighty-nine thousand fifty-one pounds, nine∣teen
shillings and seven-pence; so that there was an over∣plus
of three hundred thirty-eight thousand seven hun∣dred
and twenty-six pounds, ten shillings and four-pence;
an excess which was thought necessary, in case the lottery,
which was founded on a new plan, should not succeed.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. Some of these impositions were demmed
grievous hardships by those upon whom they immediately
fell; and many friends of their country exclaimed against
the projected army of observation in Germany, as the com∣mencement
of a ruinous continental war, which it was
neither the interest of the nation to undertake, nor in their
power to maintain, without starving the operations by sea,
and in America, founded on British principles; without
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
contracting such an additional load of debts and taxes, as
could not fail to terminate in bankruptcy and distress. To
those dependents of the ministry, who observed, that as
Hanover was threatened by France for its connexion with
Great-Britain, it ought, in common gratitude, to be pro∣tected,
they replied, that every state, in assisting an ally,
ought to have a regard to its own preservation: that if the
King of England enjoyed by inheritance, or succession, a
province in the heart of France, it would be equally absurd
and unjust, in case of a rupture with that kingdom, to ex∣haust
the treasures of Great-Britain in the defence of such
a province; and yet the inhabitants of it would have the
same right to complain that they suffered for their con∣nexion
with England. They observed, that other do∣minions,
electorates, and principalities in Germany were
secured by the constitutions of the Empire, as well as by
faire and equal alliances with their co-estates; whereas
Hanover stood solitary, like a hunted deer avoided by the
herd, and had no other shelter but that of shrinking under
the extended shield of Great-Britain: that the reluctance
expressed by the German princes to undertake the defence
of these dominions flowed from a firm persuasion, founded
on experience, that England would interpose as a princi∣pal,
and not only draw her sword against the enemies of
the electorate, but concentrate her chief strength in that
object, and waste her treasures in purchasing their con∣currence;
that, exclusive of an ample revenue drained from
the sweat of the people, great part of which had been
expended in continental efforts, the whole national debt in∣curred
since the accession of the late king had been con∣tracted
in pursuance of measures totally foreign to the in∣terest
of these kingdoms: that, since Hanover was the fa∣vourite
object, England would save money, and great quan∣tities
of British blood, by allowing France to take possession
of the electorate, paying its ransom at the peace, and in∣demnifying
the inhabitants for the damage they might
sustain; an expedient that would be productive of ano∣ther
good consequence; it would rouse the German
princes from their affected indifference, and oblige them
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
to exert themselves with vigour, in order to avoid the de∣tested
neighbourhood of such an enterprising invader.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The article of the supply relating to the ar∣my
of observation took rise from a message signed by his
Majesty, and presented by Mr. Pitt, now promoted to the
office of principal secretary of state; a gentleman who
had, upon sundry occasions, combated the gigantick plan
of continental connexions with all the strength of reason,
and all the powers of eloquence. He now imparted to the
House an intimation, importing, It was always with re∣luctance
that his Majesty asked extraordinary supplies of
his people; but as the united councils, and formidable pre∣parations
of France and her allies threatened Europe in
general with the most alarming consequences; and as these
unjust and vindictive designs were particularly and imme∣diately
bent against his Majesty's electoral dominions, and
those of his good ally, the King of Prussia, his Majesty con∣fided
in the experienced zeal and affection of his faithful
Commons, that they would chearfully assist him in form∣ing
and maintaining an army of observation, for the just
and necessary defence and preservation of those territories,
and enable him to fulfil his engagements with his Prussian
Majesty, for the security of the Empire against the irruption
of foreign armies, and for the support of the common
cause. Posterity will hardly believe, that the Emperor and
all the princes in Germany were in a conspiracy against
their country, except the King of Prussia, the Elector of
Hanover, and the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel; and they
will, no doubt, be surprised, that Great-Britain, after all
the treaties she had made, and the numberless subsidies
she had granted, should not have an ally left, except one
prince, so embarrassed in his own affairs, that he could
grant her no succour, whatever assistance he might demand.
The King's message met with as favourable a reception as
he could have desired. It was read in the House of Com∣mons,
together with a copy of the treaty between his
Majesty and the King of Prussia, including the secret and
separate article, and the declaration signed on each side by
the plenipotentiaries at Westminster: the request was
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
granted, and the convention approved. With equal rea∣diness
did they gratify his Majesty's inclination, signified
in another message, delivered on the seventeenth day of
May, by Lord Bateman, intimating, That, in this critical
juncture, emergencies might arise of the utmost impor∣tance,
and be attended with the most pernicious conse∣quences,
if proper means should not be immediately ap∣plied
to prevent or defeat them; his Majesty was, there∣fore,
desirous that the House would enable him to defray
any extraordinary expenses of the war, incurred or to be
incurred for the service of the current year; and to take
all such measures as might be necessary to disappoint or
defeat any enterprises or designs of his enemies, as the
exigency of affairs might require. The committee of
supply forthwith granted a very large sum for these pur∣poses,
including the charge of German mercenaries. A
like message being at the same time communicated to the
Upper House, their lordships voted a very loyal address
upon the occasion; and when the article of supply, which
it produced among the Commons, fell under their in∣spection,
they unanimously agreed to it, by way of a
clause of appropriation.</P>
<P>§ XXV. We have already observed, that the first bill
which the Commons passed in this session was for the relief
of the poor, by prohibiting the exportation of corn; but
this remedy not being judged adequate to the evil, another
bill was framed, removing, for a limited time, the duty
then payable upon foreign corn and flour imported; as
also permitting, for a certain term, all such foreign corn,
grain, meal, bread, biscuit, and flour, as had been or should
be taken from the enemy, to be landed and expended in the
kingdom duty free. In order still more to reduce the high
price of corn, and to prevent any supply of provisions from
being sent to our enemies in America, a third bill was
brought in, prohibiting, for a time therein limited, the
exportation of corn, grain, meal, malt, flour, bread, bis∣cuit,
starch, beef, pork, bacon, or other victual, from any
of the British plantations, unless to Great-Britain or Ire∣land,
or from one colony to another. To this act two
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
clauses were added, for allowing those necessaries, men∣tioned
above, to be imported in foreign built ships, and
from any state in amity with his Majesty, either into
Great-Britain or Ireland; and for exporting from South∣ampton
or Exeter to the Isle of Man, for the use of the
inhabitants, a quantity of wheat, barley, oats, meal, or
flour, not exceeding two thousand five hundred quarters.
The Commons would have still improved their humanity,
had they contrived and established some effectual method
to punish those unfeeling villains, who, by engrossing and
hoarding up great quantities of grain, had created this
artificial scarcity, and deprived their fellow creatures of
bread, with a view to their own private advantage. Upon
a subsequent report of the committee, the House resolved,
that, to prevent the high price of wheat and bread, no
spirits should be distilled from wheat for a limited time.
While the bill, formed on this resolution, was in embryo,
a petition was presented to the House by the brewers of
London, Westminster, Southwark, and parts adjacent,
representing, that, when the resolution passed, the price
of malt, which was before too high, immediately rose to
such a degree, that the petitioners found themselves utterly
incapable of carrying on business at the price malt then
bore, occasioned, as they conceived, from an apprehension
of the necessity the distillers would be under to make use
of the best pale malt, and substitute the best barley in lieu
of wheat: that, in such a case, the markets would not be
able to supply a su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icient quantity of barley for the de∣mands
of both professions, besides other necessary uses:
they, therefore, prayed, that, in regard to the publick
revenue, to which the trade of the petitioners so largely
contributed, proper measures might be taken for prevent∣ing
the public loss, and relieving their particular distress.
The House would not lend a deaf ear to a remonstrance
in which the revenue was concerned. The members ap∣pointed
to prepare the bill immediately received instructions
to make provision in it to restrain, for a limited time, the
distilling of barley, malt, and all grain whatsoever. The
bill was framed accordingly, but did not pass without
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
strenuous opposition. To this prohibition it was objected,
that there are always large quantities of wheat and bar∣ley
in the kingdom so much damaged, as to be unfit for
any use but the distillery, consequently a restriction of this
nature would ruin many farmers, and others employed in
the trade of malting. Particular interests, however, must
often be sacrificed to the welfare of the community; and
the present distress prevailed over the prospect of this dis∣advantage.
If they had allowed any sort of grain to be
distilled, it would have been impossible to prevent the di∣stilling
of every kind. The prohibition was limited to
two months; but at the expiration of that term, the
scarcity still continuing, it was protracted by a new bill to
the eleventh day of December, with a proviso, empowering
his Majesty to put an end to it at any time after the
eleventh day of May, if such a step should be judged for
the advantage of the kingdom.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. The next bill that engaged the attention of
the Commons was a measure of the utmost national im∣portance,
though secretly disliked by many individuals of
the legislature, who nevertheless did not venture to avow
their disapprobation. The establishment of a militia was
a very popular and desirable object, but attended with
numberless difficulties, and a competition of interests
which it was impossible to reconcile. It had formerly been
an inexhaustible source of contention between the crown
and the Commons; but now both apparently concurred in
rendering it serviceable to the commonwealth; though
some acquiesced in the scheme, who were not at all hearty
in its favour. On the fourth day of December, a motion
was made for the bill, by Colonel George Townshend,
eldest son of Lord Viscount Townshend, a gentleman of
courage, sense, and probity; endued with penetration to
discern, and honesty to pursue the real interest of his coun∣try,
in de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iance of power, in contempt of private advan∣tages.
Leave being given to bring in a bill for the better
ordering of the militia <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces in the several counties of
England, the task of preparing it was allotted to Mr.
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
Townshend, and a considerable number of the most able
members in the House, comprehending his own brother,
Mr. Charles Townshend, whose genius shone with di∣stinguished
lustre: he was keen, discerning, eloquent, and
accurate; possessed a remarkable vivacity of parts, with a
surprising solidity of understanding; was a wit without
arrogance, a patriot without prejudice, and a courtier
without dependance.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. While the militia bill remained under consi∣deration
of the House, a petition for a constitutional and
well regulated milita was presented by the mayor, jurats,
and commonalty of the King's town and parish of Maid∣stone,
in Kent, in common-council assembled. At the
same time remonstrances were offered by the protestant
dissenting ministers of the three denominations in and about
the cities of London and Westminster; by the protestant
dissenters of Shrewsbury; the dissenting ministers of De∣vonshire;
the protestant dissenters, being freeholders and
burgesses of the town, and county of the town of Notting∣ham,
joined with other inhabitants of the church of Eng∣land,
expressing their apprehension, that, in the bill then
depending, it might be proposed to enact, that the said
militia should be exercised on the Lord's day, commonly
called Sunday, and praying that no clause for such pur∣pose
might pass into a law. Though nothing could be
more ridiculously fanatie and impertinent than the declara∣tion
of such a scruple against a practice so laudable and
necessary, in a country where that day of the week is ge∣nerally
spent in merry-making, riot, and debauchery,
the House paid so much regard to the squeamish consciences
of those puritanical petitioners, that Monday was pitched
upon for the day of exercise to the militia, though on such
working days they might be much more profitably employ∣ed,
both for themselves and their country; and that no re∣ligious
pretence should be left for opposing the progress
and execution of the bill, proper clauses were inserted for
the relief of the quakers. Another petition and counter-petition
were delivered by the magistrates, freeholders, and
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
burgesses of the town of Nottingham, in relation to their
particular franchises, which were accordingly considered
in framing the bill.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. After mature deliberation, and divers altera∣tions,
it passed the Lower-House, and was sent to the
Lords for their concurrence: here it underwent several
amendments, one of which was the reduction of the num∣ber
of militia-men to one half of what the Commons had
proposed; namely, to thirty-two thousand three hundred
and forty-men for the whole kingdom of England and
Wales. The amendments being canvassed in the Lower
House, met with some opposition, and divers conferences
with their lordships ensued: at length, however, the two
Houses agreed to every article, and the bill soon received
the royal sanction. No provision, however, was made for
clothes, arms, accoutrements, and pay: had regulations
been made for these purposes, the act would have become
a money-bill, in which the Lords could have made no
amendment: in order, therefore, to prevent any differ∣ence
between the two Houses, on a dispute of privileges
not yet determined, and that the House of Peers might
make what amendments they should think expedient, the
Commons left the expense of the militia to be regulated in
a subsequent bill, during the following session, when they
could with more certainty compute what sum would be
necessary for these purposes. After all, the bill seemed to
be crude, imperfect and ine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ctual, and the promoters of
it were well aware of its defects; but they were apprehen∣sive
that it would have been dropped altogether, had
they insisted upon the scheme's being executed in its full
extent. They were eager to seise this opportunity of try∣ing
an experiment, which might afterwards be improved
to a greater national advantage; and, therefore, they ac∣quiesced
in many restrctions and alterations, which
otherwise would not have been adopted.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The next measure that fell under the consi∣deration
of the House was rendered necessary by the in∣hospitable
perseverance of the publicans and inn-holders,
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
who conceived themselves not obliged by law to receive o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
give quarters in their houses to any foreign troops, and
accordingly refused admittance to the Hessian auxiliaries,
who began to be dreadfully incommoded by the severity of
the weather. This objection implying an attack upon the
prerogative, the government did not think fit, at this
juncture, to dispute any other way, than by procuring a
new law in favour of those foreigners. It was intituled,
“A bill to make provision for quartering the foreign
troops now in this kingdom,” prepared by Lord Bar∣rington,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Sollici∣tor-General,
and immediately passed without opposition.
This step being taken, another bill was brought in, for the
regulation of the marine-forces while on shore. This was
almost a transcript of the mutiny act, with this material
difference: it empowered the Admiralty to grant com∣missions
for holding general courts-martial, and to do
every thing, and in the same manner, as his Majesty is
empowered to do by the usual mutiny-bill; consequently,
every clause was adopted without question.</P>
<P>§ XXX. The same favourable reception was given to a
bill for the more speedy and effectual recruiting his Majes∣ty's
land forces and marines; a law which threw into the
hands of many worthless magistrates an additional power of
oppressing their fellow creatures: all justices of the peace,
commissioners for the land-tax, magistrates of corporations
and boroughs, were empowered to meet by direction of
the Secretary at War, communicated in precepts issued by
the high sheriffs, or their deputies, within their respective
divisions, and at their usual place of meeting, to qualify
themselves for the execution of the act: then they were
required to appoint the times and places for their succeeding
meetings; to issue precepts to the proper officers for these
succeeding meetings; and to give notice of the time and
place of every meeting to such military officer, as, by notice
from the Secretary at War, should be directed to attend
that service. The annual bill for preventing mutiny and
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
desertion met with no objections, and indeed contained
nothing essentially different from that which had passed in
the last session. The next law enacted was for further pre∣venting
embezzlement of goods and apparel by those with
whom they are entrusted, and putting a stop to the practice
of gaming in publick houses. By this bill a penalty was
inflicted on pawnbrokers, in a summary way, for receiving
goods, knowing them not to be the property of the pledger,
and pawned without the authority of the owner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was enacted, that persons pawning, exchanging, or disposing of goods, without leave of the owner, should suffer in the penalty of twenty shillings; and, on non-payment, be committed for fourteen days to hard labour; after∣wards, if the money could not then be paid, to be whipped publickly in the house of correction, or such other place as the justice of the peace should appoint, on publication of the prosecutor: that every pawnbroker should make entry of the person's name and place of abode who pledges any goods with him; and the pledger, if he required it, should have a duplicate of that entry: that a pawnbroker, receiving linen or apparel entrusted to others to be washed or mended, should forfeit double the sum lent upon it, and restore the goods: that upon oath of any person whose goods are unlawfully pawned or exchanged, the justice should issue a warrant to search the suspected person's house; and upon refusal of admittance the officer might break open the door: that goods pawned for any sum not exceeding ten pounds might be recovered within two years, the owner making oath of the pawning, and tendering the principal, interest, and charges: that goods remaining unredeemed for two years should be forfeited and sold, the overplus to be accounted for to the owner on demand.</NOTE>. With
respect to gaming, the act ordained, that all publicans
suffering journeymen, labourers, servants, or apprentices to
game with cards, dice, shuffle-boards, mississippi, or billiard
tables, skittles, nine-pins, &amp;c. should forfeit forty shillings
for the first offence, and for every subsequent offence ten
pounds shall be levied by distress.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. Divers inconveniencies having resulted from
the interposition of justices, who, in pursuance of an act
of parliament passed in the present reign, assumed the right
of establishing rates for the payment of wages to weavers,
several petitions were offered to the House of Commons,
representing the evil consequences of such an establish∣ment;
and although these arguments were answered and
opposed in counter-petitions, the Commons, actuated by
a laudable concern for the interest of the woollen manu∣facture,
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
after due deliberation, removed the grievance by a
new bill, repealing so much of the former act as empower∣ed
justices of the peace to make rates for the payment of
wages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It likewise imported, that all contracts or agreements made betwee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> clothiers and weavers, in respect to wages, should, from and after the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> May, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven, be valid, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> withstanding any rate established, or to be established, but that these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or agreements should extend only to the actual prices or rates of wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> manship or wages, and not the payment thereof in any other manner than money: and that if any clothier should refuse or neglect to pay the weavere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> wages or price agreed on, in money, within two days after the work should<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> performed and delivered, the same being demanded, should forfeit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shillings for every such offence.</NOTE>.—The Commons were not more forward to
provide supplies for prosecuting the war with vigour, that
ready to adopt new regulations for the advantage of trade
and manufactures. The society of the free British fishery
presented a petition, alledging, that they had employed the
sum of one hundred thirty thousand three hundred and five
pounds, eight shillings, and six-pence, together with the
entire produce of their fish, and all the monies arising fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the several branches allowed on the tonnage of their ship<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ping,
and on the exportation of their fish, in carrying o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the said fishery; and that, from their being obliged, in the
infancy of the undertaking, to incur a much larger expens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
than was at that time foreseen, they now found themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
so far reduced in their capital, as to be utterly incapable o
further prosecuting the fisheries with any hope of success
unless indulged with the further assistance of parliament
They prayed, therefore, that, towards enabling them t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
carry on the said fisheries, they might have liberty to mak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
use of such nets as they should find best adapted to the sai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fisheries; each buss, nevertheless, carrying to sea the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
quantity and depth of netting, which, by the fishery acts
they were then bound to carry: that the bounty of thirty
shillings per ton, allowed by the said acts on the vessels em∣ployed
in the fishery, might be increased; and for as muc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as many of the stock-proprietors were unable to advance
any further sum for prosecuting this branch of commerce
and other unwilling, in the present situation, and under
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
the present restraints, to risque any further sum in the
undertaking, that the stock of the society, by the said acts
made unalienable, except in case of death or bankruptey,
for a term of years, might forthwith be made transferable;
and that the petitioners might be at liberty, between the
intervals of the fishing seasons, to employ the busses in such
a manner as they should find for the advantage of the
society. While the committee was employed in deliber∣ating
on the particulars of this remonstrance, another was
delivered from the free British fishery-chamber of White∣haven
in Cumberland, representing, that as the law then
stood, they went to Shetland, and returned at a great ex∣pense
and loss of time; and while the war continued durst
not stay there to fish, besides being obliged to run the most
imminent risques, by going and returning without convoy:
that, ever since the institution of the present fishery, ex∣perience
had fully shown the fishery of Shetland not worth
following, as thereby the petitioners had lost two months
of a much better fishery in St. George's channel, within
one day's sale of Whitehaven: they took notice, that the
free British fishery society had applied to the House for
further assistance and relief; and prayed that Campbel∣town,
in Argyleshire, might be appointed the place of ren∣dezvous
for the busses belonging to Whitehaven, for the
summer as well as the winter fishery, that they might be
enabled to fish with greater advantage. The committee,
having considered the matter of both petitions, were of
opinion that the petitioners should be at liberty to use
such nets as they should find best adapted to the white
herring fishery: that the bounty of thirty shillings per ton
should be augmented to fifty: that the petitioners should be
allowed, during the intervals of the fishing seasons, to em∣ploy
their vessels in any other lawful business, provided
they should have been employed in the herring-fishery during
the proper seasons: that they might use such barrels for
packing the fish as they then used, or might thereafter find
best adapted for that purpose: that they should have liberty
to make use of any waste or uncultivated land, one hundred
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
yards at the least above high-water mark, for the purpose
or drying their nets; and that Campbel-town would be
the most proper and convenient place for the rendezvous of
the busses belonging to Whitehaven. This last resolution,
however, was not inserted in the bill which contained the
other five, and in a little time received the royal assent.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. Such are the connexions, dependencies, and
relations subsisting between the mechanical arts, agriculture,
and manufactures of Great-Britain, that it requires study,
deliberation, and enquiry in the legistature to discern and
distinguish the whole scope and consequences of many pro∣jects
offered for the benefit of the commonwealth. The
society of merchant adventurers in the city of Bristol
alledged, in a petition to the House of Commons, that
great quantities of bar iron were imported into Great-Bri∣tain
from Sweden, Russia, and other parts, chiefly pur∣chased
with ready money, some of which iron was exported
again to Africa and other places; and the rest wrought up
by the manufacturers. They affirmed that bar iron, im∣ported
from North-America, would answer the same pur∣poses;
and the importation of it tend not only to the great
advantage of the kingdom, by increasing its shipping and
navigation; but also to the benefit of the British colonies:
that, by an act passed in the twenty-third year of his present
Majesty's reign, the importation of bar iron from America
into the port of London, duty free, was permitted: but its
being carried coastways, or farther by land than ten miles,
had been prohibited; so that several very considerable
manufacturing towns were deprived of the use of American
iron, and the out-ports prevented from employing it in their
export commerce: they requested, therefore, that bar iron
might be imported from North-American into Great-Britain,
duty free, by all his Majesty's subjects. This request being
re-enforced by many other petitions from different parts of
the kingdom, other classes of men, who thought their several
interests would be affected by such a measure, took the
alarm; and in divers counter petitions specified many ill
consequences which they alledged would arise from i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
being enacted into a law. Pamphlets were published on
both sides of the question, and violent disputes were kind∣led
upon this subject, which was justly deemed a matter of
national importance. The opposers of the bill observed,
that large quantities of iron were yearly produced at home,
and employed multitudes of poor people, there being no
less than one hundred and nine forges in England and
Wales, besides those erected in Scotland, the whole pro∣ducing
eighteen thousand tons of iron: that as the mines
in Great Britain are inexhaustible, the produce would of
late years have been considerably increased, had not the
people been kept under continual apprehension of seeing
American iron admitted duty free: a supposition which
had prevented the traders from extending their works, and
discouraged many from engaging in this branch of traffick:
they alledged that the iron works already carried on in Eng∣land
occasioned a consumption of one hundred and ninety-eight
thousand cords of wood, produced in coppices that
grow upon barren lands, which could not otherwise be
turned to any good account: that as the coppices afford
shade, and preserve a moisture in the ground, the pasture is
more valuable with the wood than it would be if the cop∣pices
were grubbed up; consequently all the estates where
these now grow would sink in their yearly value: that these
coppices, now cultivated and preserved for the use of the
iron works, are likewise absolutely necessary for the manu∣facture
of leather, as they furnish bark for the tanners;
and that, according to the management of these coppices,
they produced a great number of timber trees, so necessary
for the purposes of building. They asserted that neither the
American iron, nor any that had yet been found in Great
Britain, was so proper for converting into steel as that
which comes from Sweden, particularly that sort called ore
ground; but as there are mines in the northern parts of
Britain, nearly in the same latitude with those of Sweden,
furnished with sufficient quantities of wood, and rivers for
mills and engines, it was hardly to be doubted but that
people would find metal of the same quality, and, in a few
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
years, be able to prevent the necessity of importing iron
either from Sweden or Russia. They inferred that Ame∣rican
iron could never interfere with that which Great
Britain imported from Sweden, because it was not fit for
edge-tools, anchors, chain-plates, and other particulars
necessary in ship-building; nor diminish the importation
of Russian iron, which was not only harder than the Ame∣rican
and British, but also could be afforded cheaper than
that brought from our own plantations, even though the
duty of this last should be removed. The importation of
American iron, therefore, duty free, could interfere with
no other sort but that produced in Britain, with which, by
means of this advantage, it would clash so much, as to
put a stop in a little time to all the iron works now carried
on in the kingdom, and reduce to beggary a great number
of families whom they support. To these objections the
favourers of the bill sollicited replied, that when a manu∣facture
is much more valuable than the rough materials,
and these cannot be produced at home in sufficient quanti∣ties,
and at such a price as is consistent with the preser∣vation
of the manufacture, it is the interest of the legis∣lature
to admit a free importation of these materials, even
from foreign countries, although it should put an end to
the production of that material in this island: that as the
neighbours of Great Britain are now more attentive than
ever to their commercial interests, and endeavouring to
manufacture their rough materials at home, this nation
must take every method for lowering the price of materials,
otherwise in a few years it will lose the manufacture; and,
instead of supplying other countries, be furnished by them
with all the sine toys and utensils made of steel and iron:
that being in danger of losing not only the manufacture
but the produce of iron, unless it can be procured at a
cheaper rate than that for which it is sold at present, the
only way of attaining this end, is by diminishing the duty
payable upon the importation of foreign iron, or by ren∣dering
it necessary for the undertakers of the iron mines in
Great Britain to sell their produce cheaper than it has been
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
for some years afforded: that the most effectual method for
this purpose is to raise up a rival, by permitting a free im∣portation
of all sorts of iron from the American plantations:
that American iron can never be sold so cheap as that of
Britain can be afforded; for, in the colonies, labour of all
kinds is much dearer than in England: if a man employs
his own slaves, he must reckon in his charge a great deal
more than the common interest of their purchase money,
because when one of them dies, or escapes from his master,
he loses both interest and principal: that the common in∣terest
of money in the plantations is considerably higher
than in England, consequently no man in that country
will employ his money in any branch of trade by which
he cannot gain considerably more per cent. than is expect∣ed
in Great Britain, where the interest is low, and profit
moderate; a circumstance which will always give a great
advantage to the British miner, who likewise enjoys an ex∣emption
from freight and insurance, which lie heavy upon
the American adventurer, especially in time of war. With
respect to the apprehension of the leather tanners, they
observed, that as the coppices generally grew on barren
lands, not fit for tillage, and improved the pasturage, no
proprietor would be at the expense of grubbing up the
wood to spoil the pasture, as he could make no other use
of the land on which it was produced. The wood must
be always worth something, especially in counties where
there is not plenty of coal, and the timber trees would pro∣duce
considerable advantage: therefore, if there was not
one iron mine in Great Britain, no coppices would be
grubbed up, unless it grew on a rich soil, which would pro∣duce
corn instead of cord wood; consequently, the tanners
have nothing to fear, especially as planting hath become a
prevailing taste among the landholders of the island. The
committee appointed to prepare the bill seriously weighed
and canvassed these arguments, examined disputed sacts,
and inspected papers and accounts relating to the produce,
importation, and manufactory of iron. At length Mr.
John Pitt reported to the House their opinion, implying
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
that the liberty granted by an act passed in the twenty-third
year of his Majesty's reign, of importing bar-iron
from the British colonies in America into the port of Lon∣don,
should be extended to all the other ports of Great
Britain; and that so much of that act as related to this
clause should be repealed. The House having agreed to
these resolutions, and the bill being brought in accord∣ingly,
another petition was presented by several noblemen,
gentlemen, freeholders, and other proprietors, owners and
possessors of coppices and woodlands, in the west-riding of
Yorkshire, alledging that a permission to import Ameri∣can
bar-iron duty free would be attended with number∣less
ill consequences both of a public and private nature;
specifying certain hardships to which they in particular
would be exposed; and praying, that if the bill should pass
they might be relieved from the pressure of an act passed
in the reign of Henry VIII. obliging the owners of cop∣pice-woods
to preserve them, under severe penalties; and
be permitted to sell and grub up their coppice-woods, in
order to a more proper cultivation of the soil, without
being restrained by the fear of malicious and interested
prosecutions. In consequence of this remonstrance, a
clause was added to the bill, repealing so much of the act
of Henry the Eighth as prohibited the conversion of cop∣pice
or underwoods into pasture or tillage; then it passed
through both Houses, and received the royal sanction.
As there was not time, after this affair came upon the
carpet, to obtain any new accounts from America, and as
it was thought necessary to know the quantities of iron
made in that country, the House presented an address to
his Majesty, desiring he would be pleased to give directions
that there should be laid before them, in the next session
of parliament, an account of the quantity of iron made
in the American colonies, from Christmas, in the year one
thousand seven hundred and forty-nine, to the fifth day
of January, in the year one thousand seven hundred and
fifty-six, each year being distinguished.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55"/>
§ XXXIII. From this important object, the parliament
converted its attention to a regulation of a much more
private nature. In consequence of a petition by the lord-mayor,
aldermen, and commons of the city of London, a
bill was brought in, and passed into a law without opposi∣tion,
for the more effectual preservation and improvement
of the fry and spawn of fish in the river Thames and waters
of Medway, and for the better regulating the fishery in
those rivers. The two next measures taken for the benefit
of the publick were, first, a bill to render more effectual
the several laws then in being, for the amendment and pre∣servation
of the highways and turnpike roads of the king∣dom;
the other for the more effectually preventing the
spreading of the contagious distemper which at that time
raged among the horned cattle. A third arose from the
distress of poor silk manufacturers, who were destitute of
employment, and deprived of all means of subsisting,
through the interruption of the Levant trade, occasioned
by the war, and the delay of the merchant ships from Italy.
In order to remedy this inconvenience, a bill was prepared,
enacting that any persons might import from any place, in
any ship or vessel whatsoever, till the first day of Decem∣ber,
one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven, organzine
thrown silk of the growth or production of Italy, to be
brought to the Custom-House of London, wheresoever
landed: but that no Italian thrown silk, coarser than Bo∣logna,
nor any tram of the growth of Italy; nor any
other thrown silk of the growth or production of Turkey,
Persia, East-India, or China, should be imported by this
act, under the penalty of the forfeiture thereof. Not∣withstanding
several petitions presented by the merchants,
owners, and commanders of ships, and others trading to
Leghorn, and other ports of Italy; as well as by the im∣porters
and manufacturers of raw silks, representing the
evil consequences that would probably attend the passing
of such a bill, the parliament agreed to this temporary
deviation from the famous act of navigation, for a pre∣sent
supply to the poor manufacturers.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56"/>
§ XXXIV. The next civil regulation established in this
session of parliament was in itself judicious, and, had it
been more eagerly suggested, might have been much more
beneficial to the publick. In order to discourage the prac∣tice
of smuggling, and prevent the desperadoes concerned
therein from inlisting in the service of the enemy, a law
was passed, enacting, that every person who had been,
before the first of May in the present year, guilty of ille∣gal
running, concealing, receiving, or carrying any
wool, or prohibited goods, or any foreign commodities
liable to duties, the same not having being paid or secured;
or of aiding therein, or had been found with fire-arms or
weapons, in order to be aiding to such offenders; or had
been guilty of receiving such goods after seisure; or of any
act whatsoever, whereby persons might be deemed runners
of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oreign goods; or of hindering, wounding, or beating
any officer in the execution of his duty, or assisting therein,
should be indemni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied from all such o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ences, concerning
which no suit should then have been commenced, or
composition made, on condition that he should, before
being apprehended or prosecuted, and before the first day
of December, enter himself with some commissioned o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i∣cer
of his Majesty's fleet, to serve as a common sailor; and
should, for three years from such entry, unless sooner
duely discharged, actually serve and do duty in that station,
and register his name, &amp;c. with the clerk of the peace of
the county where he resided, as the act prescribes. An
attempt was made in favour of the seamen employed in the
navy, who had been very irregularly paid, and subject to
grievous hardships in consequence of this irregularity. Mr.
Grenville, brother to Earl Temple, moved for leave to
bring in a bill <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the encouragement of seamen employed
in his Majesty's navy, and for establishing a regular me∣thod
for the punctual, speedy, and certain payment of their
wages, as well as for rescuing them from the arts of fraud
and imposition. The proposal was corroborated by divers
petitions: the bill was prepared, read, printed, and,
after it had undergone some amendment, passed into the
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
House of Lords, where it was encountered with several
objections, and dropped for this session of parliament.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. The House of Commons being desirous of
preventing for the future such distresses as the poor had
lately undergone, appointed a committee to consider of
proper provisions to restrain the price of corn and bread
within due bounds for the future. For this purpose they
were empowered to send for persons, papers, and records,
and it was resolved that all who attended the committee
should have voices. Having enquired into the causes of
the late scarcity, they agreed to several resolutions, and a
bill was brought in, to explain and amend the laws against
regrators, forestallers, and engrossers of corn. The com∣mittee
also received instructions to enquire into the abuses
of millers, mealmen, and bakers, with regard to bread,
and to consider of proper methods to prevent them in the
sequel, but no further progress was made in this important
affair, which was the more interesting, as the lives of indi∣viduals,
in a great measure, depended upon a speedy refor∣mation;
for the millers and bakers were said to have
adulterated their flour with common whiting, lime, bone∣ashes,
allum, and other ingredients pernicious to the hu∣man
constitution; a consummation of villainy for which
no adequate punishment could be inflicted. Among the
measures proposed in parliament which did not succeed,
one of the most remarkable was a bill prepared by Mr.
Rose Fuller, Mr. Charles Townshend, and Mr. Banks,
to explain, amend, and render more effectual a law passed
in the reign of King William the Third, intituled, “An
act to punish governors of plantations, in this kingdom,
for crimes committed by them in the plantations.”
This bill was proposed in consequence of some complaints,
specifying acts of cruelty, folly, and oppression, by which
some British governors had been lately distinguished; but
before the bill could be brought in the parliament was
prorogued.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. But no step taken by the House of Commons,
in the course of this session, was more interesting to the
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
body of the people than the enquiry into the loss of Mi∣norca, which had excited such loud and universal clamour.
By addresses to the King, unanimously voted, the Com∣mons
requested that his Majesty would give directions for
laying before them copies of all the letters and papers con∣taining
any intelligence received by the secretaries of
state, the commissioners of the Admiralty, or any others of
his Majesty's ministers, in relation to the equipment of the
French fleet at Toulon, or the designs of the French on
Minorca, or any other of his Majesty's possessions in Eu∣rope,
since the first day of January, in the year one thou∣sand
seven hundred and fifty-five, to the first day of August,
1756. They likewise desired to peruse a list of the ships
of war that were equipped and made ready for sea, from
the first of August, in the year one thousand seven hundred
and fifty-five, to the thirtieth day of April, in the follow∣ing
year; with the copies of all sailing orders sent to the
commanders during that period; as also the state and con∣dition
of his Majesty's ships in the several ports of Great-Britain
at the time of Admiral Byng's departure, with the
squadron under his command, for the relief of Fort St.
Philip, during the period of time above-mentioned, ac∣cording
to the monthly returns made to the Admiralty, with
the number of seamen mustered and bor'n on board the re∣spective
ships. They demanded copies of all orders and in∣structions
given to that admiral, and of letters written to
and received from him, during his continuance in that
command, either by the secretaries of state, or lords of the
Admiralty, relating to the condition of his squadron, and
to the execution of his orders. In a word, they required
the inspection of all papers which could, in any manner,
tend to explain the loss of Minorca, and the miscarriage
of Mr. Byng's squadron. His Majesty complied with every
article of their requests: the papers were presented to the
House, ordered to lie upon the table for the perusal of the
members, and finally referred to the consideration of a
committee of the whole House. In the course of their
deliberations they addressed his Majesty for more informa∣tion,
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
till at length the truth seemed to be smothered under
such an enormous burthen of papers as the efforts of a
whole session could not have properly removed. Indeed,
many discerning persons without doors began to despair of
seeing the mystery unfolded, as soon as the enquiry was
undertaken by a committee of the whole House. They
observed, that an affair of such a dark, intricate, and sus∣picious
nature ought to have been referred to a select and
secret committee, chosen by ballot, empowered to send for
persons, papers, and records, and to examine witnesses in
the most solemn and deliberate manner: that the names of
the committee ought to have been published, for the satis∣faction
of the people, who could have judged with some
certainty whether the enquiry would be carried on with
such impartiality as the national misfortune required.
They suspected that this reference to a committee of the
whole House was a m—l contrivance, to prevent a regular
and minute investigation, to introduce confusion and con∣test,
to puzzle, perplex, and obumbrate; to tease, fatigue,
and disgust the enquirers, that the examination might be
hurried over in a superficial and perfunctory manner; and
the ministry, from this anarchy and confusion of materials,
half explored and undigested, derrive a general parliamen∣tary
approbation, to which they might appeal from the
accusations of the people. A select committee would have
probably examined some of the clerks of the respective
offices, that they might certainly know whether any let∣ters
or papers had been suppressed, whether the extracts
had been faithfully made, and whether there might not be
papers of intelligence, which, though proper to be sub∣mitted
to a select and secret committee, could not, con∣sistently
with the honour of the nation, be communicated
to a committee of the whole house. Indeed, it does not
appear that the ministers had any foreign intelligence or
correspondence that could be much depended upon in any
matter of national importance, and no evidence was exa∣mined
on this occasion; a circumstance the less to be re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retted,
as in times past evil ministers have generally found
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
means to render such enquiries ineffectual; and the same
arts would, at any rate, have operated with the same effi∣cacy,
had a secret committee been employed at this junc∣ture.
Be that as it may, several resolutions were reported
from the committee, though some of them were not car∣ried
by the majority without violent dispute and severe al∣tercation.
The first and last of their resolutions require
particular notice. By the former, it appeared to the com∣mittee,
that his Majesty, from the twenty-seventh day of
August, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five,
to the twentieth day of April in the succeeding year,
received such repeated and concurrent intelligence, as gave
just reason to believe that the French King intended to
invade his dominions of Great Britain or Ireland. In the
latter they declared their opinion, that no greater number
of ships of war could be sent into the Mediterranean than
were actually sent thither under the command of Admiral
Byng; nor any greater re-enforcement than the regiment
which was sent, and the detachment, equal to a battalion,
which was ordered to the relief of Fort St. Philip, consis∣tently
with the state of the navy, and the various services
essential to the safety of his Majesty's dominions, and the
interests of his subjects. It must have been something more
powerful than ordinary conviction that suggested these
opinions. Whatever reports might have been circulated
by the French ministry, in order to amuse, intimidate,
and detach the attention of the English government from
America and the Mediterranean, where they really intended
to exert themselves, yet the circumstances of the two na∣tions
being considered, one would think there could have
been no just grounds to fear an invasion of Great-Britain
or Ireland, especially when other intelligence seemed to
point out much more probable scenes of action. But the
last resolution is still more incomprehensible to those who
know not exactly the basis on which it was raised. The
number of ships of war in actual commission amounted
to two hundred and fifty, having on board fifty-thousand
seamen and marines. Intelligence and repeated informa∣tion
of the French design upon Minorca had been con∣veyed
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
to the ministry of England, about six months before
it was put in execution. Is it credible, that in all this
time the nation could not equip or spare above eleven ships
of the line and six frigates, to save the important island of
Minorca? Is it easy to conceive, that from a standing army
of fifty thousand men one regiment of troops could not
have been detached to re-enforce a garrison, well known
to be insufficient for the works it was destined to defend?
To persons of common intellects it appeared, that intelli∣gence
of the armament at Toulon was conveyed to the Ad∣miralty
as early as the month of September, in the year
one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five, with express no∣tice
that it would consist of twelve ships of the line; that
the design against Minorca was communicated as early
as the twenty-seventh day of August, by Consul Banks, of
Carthagena; confirmed by letters from Consul Berttes, at
Genoa, dated on the seventeenth and twenty-sixth of Ja∣nuary,
and received by Mr. Fox, secretary of state, on
the fourth and eleventh of February, as well as by many
subsequent intimations; that, notwithstanding these re∣peated
advices, even after hostilities had commenced in
Europe, when the garrison of Minorca amounted to no more
than four incomplete regiments, and one company of ar∣tillery,
forty-two officers being absent, and the place other∣wise
unprovided for a siege, when the Mediterranean squa∣dron,
commanded by Mr. Edgecumbe, consisted of two
ships of the line, and five frigates; neither stores, ammu∣nition,
or provision, the absent officers belonging to the
garrison, recruits for the regiments, though ready raised,
miners, nor any additional troops, were sent to the island,
nor the squadron augmented, till Admiral Byng sailed
from Spithead on the 6th day of April, with no more
ships of the line than, by the most early and authentick
intelligence, the government were informed would sail
from Toulon, even when Mr. Byng should have been
joined by Commodore Edgecumbe; a junction upon which
no dependence ought to have been laid; that this squadron
contained no troops but such as belonged to the four
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
regiments in garrison, except one battalion to serve in the
fleet as marines, unless we include the order for another
to be embarked at Gibraltar, which order was neither
obeyed nor understood: that, considering the danger to
which Minorca was exposed, and the forwardness of the
enemy's preparations at Toulon, Admiral Osborne, with
thirteen ships of the line and one frigate, who returned on
the sixteenth of February, after having convoyed a fleet of
merchant-ships, might have been detached to Minorca,
without hazarding the coast of Great-Britain; for at that
time, exclusive of this squadron, there were eight ships of
the line and thirty-two frigates ready manned, and thirty-two
ships of the line and five frigates almost equipped:
that Admiral Hawke was sent with fourteen ships of the
line and one frigate to cruise in the bay of Biscay, after
repeated intelligence had been received that the French
fleet had sailed for the West-Indies, and the eleven ships
remaining at Brest and Rochefort were in want of hands
and cannon, so that they could never serve to cover any
embarkation or descent, consequently Mr. Hawke's squa∣dron
might have been spared for the relief of Minorca: that,
instead of attending to this important object, the Admiralty
on the eighth day of March, sent two ships of the line and
three frigates to intercept a coasting convoy off Cape Bar∣fleur:
on the eleventh of the same month they detached
two ships of the line to the West-Indies, and on the nine∣teenth
two more to North-America, where they could be
of little immediate service; on the twenty-third two of the
line and three frigates a convoy-hunting off Cherbourg;
and on the first of April <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive ships of the line, including
three returned from this last service, to re-enforce Sir Ed∣ward
Hawke, already too strong for the French fleet bound
to Canada: that all these ships might have been added to
Mr. Byng's squadron, without exposing Great-Britain or
Ireland to any hazard of invasion: that at length Mr.
Byng was detached with ten great ships only, and even de∣nied
a frigate to repeat signals, for which he petitioned; al∣though
at that very time there were in port, exclusive of
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
his squadron, seventeen ships of the line and thirteen fri∣gates
ready for sea, besides eleven of the line and nine∣teen
frigates almost equipped. From these and other
circumstances, particularised and urged with great vivacity,
many individuals inferred, that a greater number of ships
might have been detached to the Mediterranean than were
actually sent with Admiral Byng: that the not sending
an earlier and stronger force was one great cause of Mi∣norca's
being lost, and co-operated with the delay of the
ministry in sending thither re-enforcements of troops, their
neglect in suffering the officers of the garrison to continue
absent from their duty, and their omitting to give orders
for raising miners to serve in the fortress of Mahon.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The next enquiry in which the House of
Commons engaged related to the contracts for victualling
the forces in America, which were supposed by some pa∣triots
to be fraudulent and unconscionable. This suspi∣cion
arose from an ambiguous expression, on which the
contractor being interrogated by the committee appointed
to examine the particulars, he prudently interpreted it in
such a manner as to screen himself from the resentment of
the legislature. The House, therefore, resolved that the
contract entered into on the twenty-sixth day of March,
in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six, by
the commissioners of the Treasury, with William Baker,
Christopher Kilby, and Richard Baker, of London, mer∣chants,
for furnishing provisions to the forces under the
command of the Earl of Loudoun, was prudent and neces∣sary,
and properly adapted to the securing a constant and
effectual supply for those forces in America.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The preceding session an address had been
presented to the King by the House of Commons, desiring
his Majesty would give orders for laying before them se∣veral
papers relating to disputes which had lately happened
between his Excellency Charles Knowles, Esq. and some
of the principal inhabitants of the island of Jamaica. This
governor was accused of many illegal, cruel, and arbi∣trary
acts, during the course of his arbitration: but these
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
imputations he incurred by an exertion of power which
was in itself laudable, and well intended for the commer∣cial
interest of the island. This was his changing the seat
of government, and procuring an act of assembly for re∣moving
the several laws, records, books, papers, and wri∣tings
belonging to several offices in that island, from Spa∣nish-town
to Kingston; and for obliging the several offi∣cers,
to keep their offices, and hold a supreme court of ju∣dicature,
at this last place, to which he had moved the seat
of government. Spanish-town, otherwise called St. Jago
de la Vega, the old capital, was an inconsiderable inland
place, of no security, trade, or importance; whereas,
Kingston was the centre of commerce, situated on the side
of a fine harbour filled with ships, well secured from the
insults of an enemy, large, wealthy, and fourishing.
Here the merchants dwell, and ship the greatest part of
the sugars that grow upon the island. They found it ex∣tremely
inconvenient and expensive to take out their
clearances at Spanish-town, which stands at a considerable
distance, and the same inconvenience and expense being
felt by the rest of the inhabitants, who had occasion to
prosecute suits at law, or attend the assembly of the island,
they joined in representations to the governor, requesting
that, in consideration of these inconveniencies, added to
that of the weakness of Spanish-town and the importance
of Kingston, the seat of government might be removed▪
He complied with their request, and in so doing entaile<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon himself the hatred and resentment of certai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
powerful planters, who possessed estates in and about th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
old town of St. Jago de la Vega, thus deserted. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
seems to have been the real source of the animosity an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
clamour incurred by Mr. Knowles, against whom a peti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion,
signed by nineteen members of the assembly, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
been sent to England, and presented to his Majesty. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the two sessions preceding this year the affair had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
brought into the House of Commons, where this gove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
nor's character was painted in frightful colours, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vers
papers relating to the dispute were examined. M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Knowles having by this time returned to England, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
subject of his administration was revived, and referred to a
committee of the whole House. In the mean time, peti∣tions
were presented by several merchants of London and
Liverpool, concerned in the trade to Jamaica, alledging,
that the removal of the publick courts, offices, and re∣cords
of the island of Jamaica to Kingston, and fixing the
seat of government there, had been productive of many
important advantages, by rendering the strength of the
island more formidable, the property of the traders and in∣habitants
more secure, and the prosecution of all commer∣cial
business more expeditious and less expensive than for∣merly;
therefore, praying that the purposes of the act pas∣sed
in Jamaica for that end might be carried into effectual
execution, in such manner as the House should think pro∣per.
The committee having examined a great number of
papers, agreed to some resolutions, importing, that a cer∣tain
resolution of the assembly of Jamaica, dated on the
twenty-ninth day of October, in the year one thousand se∣ven
hundred and fifty-three, implying a claim of right in
that assembly to raise and apply publick money without the
consent of the governor and council, was illegal, repug∣nant
to the terms of his Majesty's commission to his go∣vernor
of the said island, and derogatory of the rights of
the crown and people of Great-Britain: that the six
last resolutions taken in the assmbly of Jamaica, on the
twenty-ninth day of October, in the year one thousand
seven hundred and fifty-three, proceeded one a manifest
misapprehension of the King's instruction to his governor,
requiring him not to give his assent to any bill of an unu∣sual
or extraordinary nature and importance, wherein
his Majesty's prerogative, or the property of his subjects,
might be prejudiced, or the trade of shipping of the king∣dom
any ways affected, unless there should be a clause in∣serted,
suspending the execution of such bill until his Ma∣jesty's
pleasure should be known; that such instruction
was just and necessary, and no alteration of the constitution
of the island, nor any way derogatory to the rights of the
subjects in Jamaica. From these resolutions the reader
may perceive the nature of the dispute which had arisen
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
between the people of Jamaica and their governor, Vice-Admiral
Knowles, whose conduct on this occasion seems to
have been justified by the legislature. The parliament,
however, forbore to determine the question, whether the
removal of the courts of judicature from Spanish-town <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Kingston was a measure calculated for the interest of the
island in general.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The last subject which we shall mention,
as having fallen under the cognizance of the Common
during this session of parliament, was the state of Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
haven on the coast of Wales, one of the most capacious
safe, and commodious harbours in Great-Britain. Here
the country affords many conveniences for building ship
of war, and erecting forts, docks, quays, and magazine;
It might be fortified at a very small expense, so as to be
quite secure from any attempts of the enemy, and ren∣dered
by far the most useful harbour in the kingdom fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fleets, cruisers, trading ships, and packet-boats, bound <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and from the westward, for from hence they may pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to sea almost with any wind, and even at low wate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
they may weather Scilly and Cape-Clear when no vesse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
can stir from the British channel, or out of the Fren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ports of Brest and Rochefort, and as a post can travel fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
hence in three days to London, it might become the cent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of very useful sea intelligence. A petition from seven
merchants in London was presented, and recommended <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the House in a message from the King, specifying the ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vantages
of this harbour, and the small expense at which<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
might be fortified, and praying that the House would ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this important subject into consideration. Accordingl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a committee was appointed for this purpose, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
power to send for persons, papers, and records; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
every circumstance relating to it was examined with a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>curacy
and deliberation. At length the report being ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the House by Mr. Charles Townshend, they unan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mously
agreed to an address, representing to his Majest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that many great losses had been sustained by the tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of the kingdom, in time of war, from the want of
safe harbour on the western coast of the island, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
reception and protection of merchant ships, and sending
out cruisers: that the harbour of Milford-haven, in the
county of Pembroke, is most advantageously situated, and,
if properly defended and secured, in every respect adapted
to the answering those important purposes: they, there∣fore,
humbly besought his Majesty, that he would give
immediate directions for erecting batteries, with proper
cover, on the sides of the said harbour, in the most con∣venient
places for guarding the entrance called Hubber∣stone-road,
and also such other fortifications as might be
necessary to secure the interior parts of the harbour, and
that, until such batteries and fortifications could be com∣pleted,
some temporary defence might be provided for the
immediate protection of the ships and vessels lying in the
said harbour; finally, they assured him the House would
make good to his Majesty all such expenses as should be
incurred for these purposes. The address met with a gra∣cious
reception, and a promise that such directions should
be given. The harbour was actually surveyed, the places
were pitched upon for batteries, and the estimates pre∣pared,
but no further progress hath since been made.</P>
<P>§ XL. We have now finished the detail of all the ma∣terial
transactions of this session, except what relates to
the fate of Admiral Byng, which now claims our attention.
In the mean time, we may observe, that on the fourth day
of July the session was closed with his Majesty's harangue,
the most remarkable and pleasing paragraph of which
turned upon his royal assurance, that the succour and
preservation of his dominions in America had been his
constant care, and, next to the security of his kingdoms,
should continue to be his great and principal object. He
told them he had taken such measures as, he trusted, by
the blessing of God, might effectually disappoint the de∣signs
of the enemy in those parts; that he had no further
view but to vindicate the just rights of his crown and
subjects from the most injurious encroachments; to pre∣serve
tranquillity, as far as the circumstances of things
might admit; to prevent the true friends of Britain,
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
and the liberties of Europe from being oppressed and
endangered by any unprovoked and unnatural con∣junction.</P>
<P>§ XLI. Of all the transactions that distinguished this
year, the most extraordinary was the sentence executed on
Admiral Byng, the son of that great officer who had ac∣quired
such honour by his naval exploits in the preceding
reign, and was ennobled for his services, by the title of
Lord Viscount Torrington. His second son, John Byng,
had from his earliest youth been trained to his father's
profession; and was generally esteemed one of the best o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i∣cers
in the navy, when he embarked in that expedition to
Minorca, which covered his character with disgrace, and
even exposed him to all the horrors of an ignominious
death. On the twenty-eighth day of December his trial
began before a court-martial, held on board the ship St.
George, in the harbour of Portsmouth, to which place Mr.
Byng had been conveyed from Greenwich by a party of
horse-guards, and insulted by the populace in every town
and village through which he passed. The court having
proceeded to examine the evidences for the crown and the
prisoner, from day to day, in the course of a long sitting,
agreed unanimously to thirty-seven resolutions, implying
their opinion, that Admiral Byng, during the engagement
between the British and French fleets on the twentieth
day of May last, did not do his utmost endeavour to take,
seise, and destroy the ships of the French King, which it
was his duty to have engaged, and to assist such of his
Majesty's ships as were engaged, which it was his duty to
have assisted; and that he did not exert his utmost power
for the relief of St. Philip's-castle. They, therefore, una∣nimously
agreed, that he fell under part of the twelfth
article of an act of parliament passed in the twenty-second
year of the present reign, for amending, explaining, and
reducing into one act of parliament the laws relating to the
government of his Majesty's ships, vessels, and forces by
sea; and as that article positively prescribed death, with∣out
any alternative left to the discretion of the court under
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
any variation of circumstances, they unanimously adjudged
the said Admiral John Byng to be shot to death, at such
time and on board of such ships as the lord commissioners
of the Admiralty should please to direct. But as it appear∣ed,
by the evidence of the officers who were near the Ad∣miral's
person, that no backwardness was perceivable in
him during the action, nor any mark of fear or confusion
either in his countenance or behaviour; but that he deli∣vered
his orders coolly and distinctly, without seeming de∣ficient
in personal courage, and from other circumstances
they believed his misconduct did not arise either from
cowardice or disaffection, they unanimously and earnestly
recommended him as a proper object of mercy. The
Admiral himself behaved through the whole tryal with
the most chearful composure, seemingly the effect of con∣scious
innocence, upon which, perhaps, he too much
relied. Even after he had heard the evidence examined
against him, and finished his own defence, he laid his
account in being honourably acquitted, and ordered his
coach to be ready for conveying him directly from the
tribunal to London. A gentleman, his friend, by whom
he was attended, having received intimation of the sen∣tence
to be pronounced, thought it his duty to prepare
him for the occasion, that he might summon all his for∣titude
to his assistance, and accordingly made him ac∣quainted
with the information he had received. The Ad∣miral
gave tokens of surprise and resentment, but be∣trayed
no marks of fear or disorder either then or in the
court when the sentence was pronounced. On the con∣trary,
while divers members of the court-martial manifest∣ed
grief, anxiety, and trepidation, shedding tears, and
sighing with extraordinary emotion, he heard his doom
denounced without undergoing the least alteration of fea∣ture,
and made a low obeisance to the president and the
other members of the court as he retired.</P>
<P>§ XLII. The officers who composed this tribunal were
so sensible of the law's severity, that they unanimously sub∣scribed
a letter to the board of Admiralty, containing this
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
remakable paragraph:—“We cannot help laying the
distresses of our minds before your lordships on this occa∣sion,
in finding ourselves under a necessity of condemn∣ing
a man to death, from the great severity of the twelfth
article of war, part of which he falls under, which ad∣mits
of no mitigation if the crime should be committed
by an errour in judgement; and, therefore, for our own
consciences sake, as well as in justice to the prisoner, we
pray your lordships, in the most earnest manner, to
recommend him to his Majesty's clemency.” The
lords of the Admiralty, instead of complying with the
request of the court-martial, transmitted their letter to the
King, with copies of their proceedings, and a letter from
themselves to his Majesty, specifying a doubt with regard
to the legality of the sentence, as the crime of negligence,
for which the Admiral had been condemned, was not ex∣pressed
in any part of the proceedings. At the same time,
copies of two petitions from George Lord Viscount Tor∣rington,
in behalf of his kinsman Admiral Byng, were
submitted to his Majesty's royal wisdom and determination.
All the friends and relations of the unhappy convict em∣ployed
and exerted their in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uence and interest for his
pardon; and as the circumstances had appeared so strong
in his favour, it was supposed that the sceptre of royal mer∣cy
would be extended for this preservation: but infamous
arts were used to whet the savage appetite of the populace
for blood. The cry of vengeance was loud throughout
the land: sullen clouds of suspicion and malevolence in∣terposing,
were said to obstruct the genial beams of the
best virtue that adorns the throne; and the s—n was
given to understand that the execution of Admiral Byng
was a victim absolutely necessary to appease the fury of the
people. His Majesty, in consequence of the representa∣tion
made by the lords of the Admiralty, re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erred the sen∣tence
to the consideration of the twelve judges, who were
unanimously of opinion that the sentence was legal. This
report being transmitted from the privy-council to the Ad∣miralty,
their lordships issued a warrant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or executing the
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
sentence of death on the twenty-eighth day of February.
One gentleman at the board, however, refused to subscribe
the warrant, assigning for his refusal the reasons which
we have inserted by way of note, for the satisfaction of the
reader<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<OPENER>Admiral F—s's reasons for not signing the warrant for Admiral Byng's execution:</OPENER>
<P>“IT may be thought great presumption in me to differ from so great autho∣rity as that of the twelve judges; but when a man is called upon to sign his name to an act which is to give authority to the shedding of blood, he ought to be guided by his own conscience, and not by the opinions of other men.”</P>
<P>“In the case before us, it is not the merit of Admiral Byng that I consider: whether he deserves death or not, is not a question for me to decide; but whether or not his life can be taken away by the sentence pronounced on him by the court-martial, and after having so clearly explained their motives for pronouncing such a sentence, is the point which alone has employed my most serious consideration.”</P>
<P>“The twelfth article of war, on which Admiral Byng's sentence is ground∣ed, says (according to my understanding of its meaning) <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>That every person, who, in time of action, shall withdraw, keep back, or not come into sight, or do his utmost, &amp;c. through motives of cowardice, negligence, or disaffection, shall suffer death. The court-martial does, in express words, acquit Adm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral Byng of cowardice and disaffection, and does not name the word Negligence. Admiral Byng does not, as I conceive, fall under the letter or description of he twelfth article of war. It may be said, that negligence is implied, though the word is not mentioned, otherwise the court-mart<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al would not have brought his offence under the twelfth article, having acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted him of cowardice and disaffection. But it must be acknowledged that the negligence implied cannot be wilful negligence; for wilful negligence, in Admiral Byng's situation, must have proceeded either from cowardice or disaffection, and he is e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pressly acquitted of both these crimes; besides, these crimes, which are im∣plied only, and not named, may indeed justify suspicion and private opinion, but cannot satisfy the conscience in case of blood.”</P>
<P>“Admiral Byng's fate was referred to a court-martial, his life and death were left to their opinions. The court-martial condemn him to death, be∣cause, as they expressly say, they were under a necessity of doing so by reason of the letter of the law, the severity of which they complained of, because <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e admits of no mitigation. The court-martial expressly say, that for the sake of their conscience, as well as in justice to the prisoner, they most earnestly recommend him to his Majesty for mercy; it is evident, then, that in the opinions and consciences of the judges, he was not deserving to death.”</P>
<P>“The question then is, shall the opinions or necessities of the court-martial determine Admiral Byng's fate? if it should be the latter, he will be executed contrary to the intentions and meaning of his judges; if the former, his life is not forfeited. His judges declare him not deserving of death; but, mistaking either the meaning of the law, or the nature of his offence, they bring him under an article of war, which, according to their own description of his offence, he does not, I conceive, fall under; and then they condemn him to death, because, as they say, the law admits of no mitigation. Can a man's life be taken away by such a sentence! I would not willingly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> misunderstood, and have it believed that I judge of Admiral Byng's deferts: that was the business of a court-martial, and it is may duty only to act ac∣cording to my conscence; which, after deliberate consideration, afflisted by the best light a poor understanding can afford it, remains still in doubt, and there∣fore I cannot consent to sign a warrant whereby the sentence of the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> martial may be curried into execution; for I cannot help thinking, that how∣ever criminal Admiral Byng may be, his life is not sorseited by that sentence I do not mean to find fault with other men's opinions; all I endeavour at, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to give reasons for my own; and all I desire or wish is, that I may not be misunderstood; I do not pretend to judge Admiral Byng's deserts, nor to give any opinion on the propriety of the act.”</P>

§ XLIII. Though mercy was denied to the criminal,
the crown seemed determined to do nothing that should be
thought inconsistent with law. A member of parliament,
who had sat upon the court-martial at Portsmouth, rose up
in his place, and made application to the House of Com∣mons
in behalf of himself and several other members of that
tribunal, praying the aid of the legislature, to be released
from the oath of secresy imposed on courts-martial, that
they might disclose the grounds on which sentence of death
had passed on Admiral Byng, and, perhaps, discover such
circumstances as might show the sentence to be improper.
Although this application produced no resolution in the
House, the King, on the twenty-sixth day of February,
sent a message to the Commons by Mr. Secretary Pitt,
importing, that though he had determined to let the law
take its course with relation to Admiral Byng, and resisted
all sollicitations to the contrary, yet, as a member of the
House had expressed some scruples about the sentence, his
Majesty had thought fit to respite the execution of it, that
there might be an opportunity of knowing, by the separate
examination of the members of the court-martial, upon oath,
what grounds there were for such scruples, and that his Ma∣jesty
was resolved still to let the sentence be carried into
execution, unless it should appear from the said examination,
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
that Admiral Byng was unjustly condemned. The sentence
must be strictly legal, and, at the same time, very severe,
according to the maxim, <HI>summum jus, summa injuria.</HI> In
such causes, and perhaps in such cases only, the rigour of
the law ought to be softened by the lenient hand of the
royal prerogative. That this was the case of Admiral
Byng appears from the warm and eager intercession of his
jury, a species of intercession which hath generally, if not
always, prevailed at the foot of the throne, when any thing
favourable for the criminal had appeared in the course of
the trial. How much more then might it have been ex∣pected
to succeed, when earnestly urged as a case of con∣science,
in behalf of a man whom his judges had expressly
acquitted of cowardice and treachery, the only two impu∣tations
that rendered him criminal in the eyes of the na∣tion!
such an interposition of the crown in parliamentary
transactions was irregular, unnecessary, and at another
juncture might have been productive of violent heats and
declamation. At present, however, it passed without cen∣sure,
as the effect of inattention, rather than a design to
encroach upon the privileges of the House.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. The message being communicated, a bill was
immediately brought in, to release the members of the
court-martial from the obligations of secresy, and passed
through the Lower-House without opposition: but in the
House of Lords it appeared to be destitute of a proper
foundation. They sent a message to the Commons, de∣siring
them to give leave that such of the members of the
court-martial as were members of that House might
attend their lordships, in order to be examined on the se∣cond
reading of the bill; accordingly, they and the rest
of the court-martial attended, and answered all questions
without hesitation. As they did not insist upon any ex∣cuse,
nor produce any satisfactory reason for showing that
the man they had condemned was a proper object of mercy,
their lordships were of opinion that there was no occa∣sion
for passing any such bill, which, therefore, they
almost unanimously rejected. It is not easy to conceive
what stronger reasons could be given for proving Mr
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
Byng an object of mercy than those mentioned in the letter
sent to the board of Admiralty by the members of the
court-martial, who were empowered to try the imputed
offence, consequently must have been deemed well quali∣fied
to judge of his conduct.</P>
<P>§ XLV. The unfortunate Admiral being thus aban∣doned
to the stroke of justice, prepared himself for death
with resignation and tranquillity. He maintained a sur∣prising
chearfulness to the last, nor did he, from his con∣demnation
to his execution, exhibit the least sign of impa∣tience
or apprehension. During that interval he had re∣mained
on board of the Monarque, a third-rate ship of
war, anchored in the harbour of Portsmouth, under a strong
guard, in custody of the marshal of the Admiralty. On
the fourteenth of March, the day fixed for his execution, the
boats belonging to the squadron at Spithead being manned
and armed, containing their captains and officers, with a de∣tachment
of marines, attended this solemnity in the har∣bour,
which was also crowded with an infinite number of
other boats and vessels filled with spectators. About noon
the Admiral having taken leave of a clergyman, and two
friends who accompanied him, walked out of the great
cabin to the quarter-deck, where two files of marines were
ready to execute the sentence. He advanced with a firm
deliberate step, a composed and resolute countenance, and
resolved to suffer with his face uncovered, until his friends
representing that his looks would possibly intimidate the
soldiers, and prevent their taking aim properly, he submit∣ted
to their request, threw his hat on the deck, kneeled on
a cushion, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied one white handkerchief over his eyes, and
dropped the other as a signal for his executioners, who
fired a volley so decisive, that five balls passed through his
body, and he dropped down dead in an instant. The time
in which this tragedy was acted, from his walking out of
the cabin to his being deposited in the cossin, did not ex∣ceed
three minutes.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. Thus fell, to the astonishment of all Europe,
Admiral John Byng, who, whatever his errours and indis∣cretions
might have been, seems to have been rashly con∣demned,
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
meanly given up, and cruelly sacrificed to vile con∣siderations.
The sentiments of his own fate he avowed
on the verge of eternity, when there was no longer any
cause of dissimulation, in the following declaration, which,
immediately before his death, he delivered to the marshal
of the Admiralty. “A few moments will now deliver me
from the virulent persecution, and frustrate the further
malice of my enemies. Nor need I envy them a life sub∣ject
to the sensations my injuries, and the injustice done
me, must create; persuaded I am that justice will be done
to my reputation hereafter: the manner and cause of raising
and keeping up the popular clamour and prejudice against
me will be seen through. I shall be considered (as I now
perceive myself) a victim destined to divert the indignation
and resentment of an injured and deluded people from the
proper objects. My enemies themselves must now think
me innocent. Happy for me, at this my last moment,
that I know my own innocence, and am conscious that no
part of my country's misfortunes can be owing to me. I
heartily wish the shedding my blood may contribute to the
happiness and service of my country, but cannot resign my
just claim to a faithful discharge of my duty according to
the best of my judgement, and the utmost exertion of my
ability for his Majesty's honour, and my country's service.
I am sorry that my endeavours were not attended with
more success, and that the armament under my command
proved too weak to succeed in an expedition of such mo∣ment.
Truth has prevailed over calumny and falsehood,
and justice has wiped off the ignominious stain of my sup∣posed
want of personal courage, and the charge of disaf∣fection.
My heart acquits me of these crimes: but who
can be presumptuously sure of his own judgement? If my
crime is an error in judgement, or dissering in opinion from
my judges, and if yet the error in judgement should be on
their side, God forgive them, as I do, and may the distress
of their minds, and uneasiness of their consciences, which
in justice to me they have represented, be relieved, and sub∣side
as my resentment has done. The Supreme Judge sees
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
all hearts and motives, and to him I must submit the justice
of my cause.”</P>
<P>§ XLVII. Nothwithstanding all that has been said in
his favour, notwithstanding the infamous arts that were
practised to keep up the cry against him, notwithstanding
this solemn appeal to heaven in his last moments, and even
self-conviction of innocence, the character of Admiral
Byng, in point of personal courage, will stil with many
people remain problematical. They will still be of opi∣nion,
that if the spirit of a British admiral had been pro∣perly
exerted the French fleet would have been defeated,
and Minorca relieved. A man's opinion of danger varies
at different times, in consequence of an irregular tide of
animal spirits, and he is actuated by considerations which
he dares not avow. After an officer, thus influenced, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
hesitated or kept aloof in the hour of trial, the mind, eager
for its own justification, assembles, with surprising indus∣try,
every favourable circumstance of excuse, and brood<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
over them with parental partiality, until it becomes not
only satisfied, but even enamoured of their beauty and
complexion, like a doating mother, blind to the deformity
of her own offspring. Whatever Mr. Byng's internal feel∣ings
might have been, whatever consequences might have
attended his behaviour on that occasion; as the tribuna<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
before which he was tried acquitted him expressly of cow∣ardice
and treachery, he was, without all doubt, a proper
object for royal clemency, and so impartial posterity will
judge him, after all those dishonourable motives of faction
and of fear, by which his sate was influenced, shall be lost
in oblivion, or remembered with disdain. The people of
Great Britain, naturally fierce, impatient, and clamorous,
have been too much indulged, upon every petty miscar∣riage,
with trials, courts-martials, and dismissions, which
tend only to render their military commanders rash and
precipitate, the populace more licentious and intractable,
and to disgrace the national character in the opinion of
mankind.</P>

<P>§ I. THOUGH the parliament of Great-Britain
unanimously concurred in strengthening the
hands of government, for avigorous prosecution of the war,
those liberal supplies had like to have proved ineffectual,
through a want of harmony in her councils. In the course
of the last year the clamorous voice of dissatisfaction had
been raised by a series of disappointements and miscarriages,
which were imputed to want of intelligence, sagacity, and
vigour in the administration. The defeat of Braddock, the
reduction of Oswego and other forts in America, the de∣lay
of armaments, the neglect of opportunities, ineffectual
cruises, absurd dispositions of fleets and squadrons, the dis∣grace
in the Mediterranean, and the loss of Minorca,
were numbered among the misfortunes that flowed from
the crude designs of a weak dispirited ministry; and the
prospect of their acquiescing in a continental war brought
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
them still farther in contempt and detestation with the
body of the people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII.</NOTE> In order to conciliate the good-will
of those whom their conduct had disobliged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1757.</NOTE> to acquire a
fresh stock of credit with their fellow subjects, and remove
from their own shoulders part of what future censure
might ensue, they admitted into a share of the adminis∣tration
a certain set of gentlemen, remarkable for their
talents and popularity, headed by Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge,
esteemed the two most illustrious patriots of Great Bri∣tain,
alike distinguished and admired for their unconquer∣able
spirit and untainted integrity. The former of these
was appointed secretary of state, the other chancellor of
the Exchequer, and their friends were vested with other
honorable though subordinate offices.</P>
<P>§ II. So far the people were charmed with the promotion
of individuals, upon whose virtues and abilities they had
the most perfect reliance: but these new ingredients would
never thoroughly mix with the old leven. The admini∣stration
became an emblem of the image that Nebuchad∣nezzar
saw in his dream, the leg was of iron, and the
foot was of clay. The old junto found their new asso∣ciates
very unfit for their purposes. They could neither
persuade, cajole, nor intimidate them into measures which
they thought repugnant to the true interest of their coun∣try.
The new ministers combated in council every such
plan, however patronized: they openly opposed in parlia∣ment
every design which they deemed unworthy of the
crown, or prejudicial to the people, even though distin∣guished
by the predilection of the sovereign. Far from
pargaining for their places, and surrendering their princi∣ples
by capitulation, they maintained in office their inde∣pendency
and candour with the most vigilant circumspec∣tion,
and seemed determined to show, that he is the best
minister to the sovereign who acts with the greatest probity
towards the subject. Those who immediately surrounded
the throne were supposed to have concealed the true cha∣racters
of these faithful servants from the knowledge of
their royal master; to have represented them as obstinate,
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
imperious, ignorant, and even lukewarm in their loyalty;
and to have declared, that with such colleagues it would
be impossible to move the machine of government accord∣ing
to his Majesty's inclination. These suggestions, art∣fully
inculcated, produced the desired effect: on the ninth
day of April Mr. Pitt, by his Majesty's command, resigned
the seals of secretary of state for the southern department.
In the room of Mr. Legge, the King was pleased to grant
the office of chancellor of the Exchequer to the right
honorable Lord Mans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield, chief justice of the court of
King's-Bench, the same personage whom we have men∣tioned
before under the name of Mr. Murray, sollicitor-general,
now promoted and ennobled for his extraordi∣nary
merit and important services. The fate of Mr. Pitt
was extended to some of his principal friends: the board
of Admiralty was changed, and some other removals were
made with the same intention.</P>
<P>§ III. What was intended as a disgrace to Mr. Pitt and
Mr. Legge turned out one of the most shining circum∣stances
of their characters. The whole nation seemed to
rise up, as one man, in the vindication of their fame:
every mouth was opened in their praise; and a great
number of respectable cities and corporations presented
them with the freedom of their respective societies, en∣closed
in gold boxes of curious workmanship, as testimo∣nies
of their peculiar veneration. What the people highly
esteem, they in a manner idolize. Not contented with
making offerings so slattering and grateful to conscious
virtue, they conceived the most violent prejudices against
those gentlemen who succeeded in the administration;
fully convinced, that the same persons who had sunk the
nation in the present distressful circumstances, who had
brought on her dishonour, and reduced her to the verge of
destruction, were by no means the sit instruments of he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
delivery and redemption. The whole kingdom catched
sire at the late changes; nor could the power, the cunning
and the artifice of a saction long support it against th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
united voice of Great Britain, which soon pierced the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
of the sovereign. It was not possible to persuade the peo∣ple
that salutary measures could be suggested or pursued,
except by the few, whose zeal for the honour of their
country, and steady adherence to an upright disinterested
conduct, had secured their confidence, and claimed their
veneration. A great number of addresses, dutifully and
loyally expressed, sollicited the King, ever ready to meet
half way the wishes of his faithful people, to restore Mr.
Pitt and Mr. Legge to their former employments. Upon
this they rested the security and honour of the nation, as
well as the public expectation of the speedy and success∣ful
issue of a war, hitherto attended with disgraces and
misfortunes. Accordingly, his Majesty was graciously
pleased to redeliver the seals to Mr. Pitt, appointing him
secretary of state for the southern department, on the
twenty-ninth day of June; and five days after the office of
chancellor of the Exchequer was restored to Mr. Legge:
promotions that afforded universal satisfaction.</P>
<P>§ IV. It would not, perhaps, be possible to exclude
from a share in the administration all who are not per∣fectly
agreeable to the people: however unpopular the late
ministry might appear, still they possessed sufficient influ∣ence
in the privy-council, and credit in the House of Com∣mons,
to thwart every measure in which they did not
themselves partake. This consideration, and very recent
experience, probably dictated the necessity of a coalition,
salutary in itself and prudent, because it was the only
means of assuaging the rage of faction, and healing those
divisions, more pernicious to the public than the most
mistaken and blundering councils. Sir Robert Henley
was made lord-keeper of the great seal, and sworn of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Majesty's privy-council, on the thirtieth day of June:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he custody of the privy-seal was committed to Earl
Temple: his grace the Duke of Newcastle, Mr. Legge,
Mr. Nugent, Lord Viscount Dunca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on, and Mr.
Grenville, were appointed commissioners for executing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he office of treasurer of his Majesty's Exchequer: Lord
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
Anson, Admirals Boscawen and Forbes, Dr. Hay, Mr.
West, Mr. Hunter, and Mr. Elliot, to preside at the
board of Admiralty: Mr. Fox was gratified with the
office of receiver and paymaster-general of all his Majesty's
guards, garrisons, and land forces; and the Earl of Tho∣mond
was made treasurer of the King's household, and
sworn of his Majesty's privy-council. Other promotions
likewise took place, with a design to gratify the adherents
of either party; and so equally was the royal favour dis∣tributed,
that the utmost harmony for a long time subsisted.
Ingredients seemingly heterogenous consolidated into one
uniform mass, so as to produce effects far exceeding the
most sanguine expectations; and this prudent arrangement
proved displeasing only to those whom violent party attach∣ment
had inspired with a narrow and exclusive spirit.</P>
<P>§ V. The accumulated losses and disappointments of
the preceding year made it absolutely necessary to retrieve
the credit of the British arms and councils by some vigo∣rous
and spirited enterprise, which should at the same time
produce some change in the circumstances of his Prussian
Majesty, already depressed by the repulse at Colin, and in
danger of being attacked by the whole power of France,
now ready to fall upon him, like a torrent, which had so
lately swept before it the army of observation, now on the
brink of disgrace. A well-planned and vigorous descent
on the coast of France, it was thought, would probably
give a decisive blow to the marine of that kingdom, and
at the same time effect a powerful diversion in favour of
the Prussian monarch and the Duke of C—d, driven
from all his posts in the electorate of Hanover, by drawing
a part of the French forces to the defence and protection
of their own coasts. Both were objects of great concern,
upon which the sovereign and ministry were sedulously
bent. His royal highness the Duke in a particular manner
urged the necessity of some enterprise of this nature, as the
only expedient to obviate the shameful convention now in
agitation. The ministry foresaw, that, by destroying the
enemy's shipping, all succours would be cut off from
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
America, whither they were daily transporting troops;
the British commerce secured, without those convoys so
inconvenient to the board of Admiralty, and to the mer∣chants;
and those ideal fears of an invasion, that had in
some measure affected the publick credit, wholly dis∣pelled.</P>
<P>§ VI. From these considerations a powerful fleet was
ordered to be got in readiness to put to sea on the shortest
notice, and ten regiments of foot were marched to the
Isle of Wight. The naval armament, consisting of eigh∣teen
ships of the line, besides frigates, fire-ships, bomb-ketches,
and transports, was put under the command of
Sir Edward Hawke, an officer whose faithful services re∣commended
him, above all others, to this command; and
Rear-Admiral Knowles was appointed his subaltern. Sir
John Mordaunt was preferred to take the command of the
land forces; and both strictly enjoined to act with the ut∣most
unanimity and harmony. Europe beheld with asto∣nishment
these mighty preparations. The destination of
the armament was wrapped in the most profound secresy:
it exercised the penetration of politicians, and filled
France with very serious alarms. Various were the im∣pediments
which obstructed the embarkation of the troops
for several weeks, while Mr. P—expressed the greatest
uneasiness at the delay, and repeatedly urged the com∣mander
in chief to expedite his departure; but a sufficient
number of transports, owing to some blunder in the con∣tractors,
had not yet arrived. The troops expressed an eager
impatience to signalize themselves against the enemies of
the liberties of Europe; but the superstitious drew unfa∣vourable
presages from the dilatoriness of the embarka∣tion.
At last the transports arrived, the troops were put on
board with all expedition, and the sleet got under fail on
the eighth day of September, attended with the prayers of
every man warmed with the love of his country, and sol∣licitous
for her honour. The publick, big with expectation,
dubious where the stroke would sall, but consident of its
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
success, were impatient for tidings from the fleet; but it
was not till the fourteenth that even the troops on board
began to conjecture that a descent was meditated on the
coast of France near Rochefort or Rochelle.</P>
<P>§ VII. On the twentieth the fleet made the Isle of
Oleron, and then Sir Edward Hawke sent an order to
Vice-Admiral Knowles, requiring him, if the wind per∣mitted
the fleet, to proceed to Basque road, to stand in as
near to the Isle of Aix as the pilot would carry him, with
such ships of his division as he thought necessary for the
service, and to batter the fort till the garrison should either
abandon or surrender it. But the immediate execution of
this order was frustrated by a French ship of war's stand∣ing
into the very middle of the fleet, and continuing in
that station for some time before she discovered her mis∣take,
or any of the captains had a signal thrown out to
give chase. A—I K—les, when too late, ordered the
Magnanime, Captain Howe, and Torbay, Captain Kep∣pel,
on that service, and thereby retarded the attack upon
which he was immediately sent. A stroke of policy great∣ly
to be admired, as from hence he gained time to assure
himself of the strength of the fortifications of Aix, before
he ran his Majesty's ships into danger.</P>
<P>§ VIII. While the above ships, with the addition of the
Royal William, were attending the French ship of war
safe into the river Garonne, the remainder of the fleet
was beating to windward off the Isle of Oleron; and the
commander in chief published orders and regulations
which did credit to his judgment, and would have been
highly useful had there ever been occasion to put them in
execution. On the twenty-third the van of the fleet, led
by Captain Howe in the Magnanime, stood towards Aix,
a small island situated in the mouth of the river Charente,
leading up to Rochesort, the fortifications half finished,
and mounted with about thirty cannon and mortars, the
garrison composed of six hundred men, and the whole
island about five miles in circumference. As the Magna∣nime
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
approached, the enemy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired briskly upon her; but
Captain Howe, regardless of their faint endeavours, kept
on his course without flinching, dropped his anchors close
to the walls, and poured in so incessant a fire as soon
silenced their artillery. It was, however, near an hour
before the fort struck, when some forces were landed to
take possession of so important a conquest, with orders to
demolish the fortifications, the care of which was entrust∣ed
to Vice-Admiral Knowles.</P>
<P>§ IX. Inconsiderable as this success might appear, it
greatly elated the troops, and was deemed an happy omen
of further advantages; but, instead of embarking the troops
that night, as was universally expected, several successive
days were spent in councils of war, soundings of the coast,
and deliberations whether K—'s express orders were
practicable, or to be complied with. Eight days were
elapsed since the first appearance of the fleet on the coast,
and the alarm was given to the enemy. Sir Edward
Hawke, indeed, proposed laying a sixty gun ship against
Fouras, and battering that fort, which it was thought
would help to secure the landing of the troops, and facili∣tate
the enterprise on Rochefort. This a French pilot
on board (Thierry) undertook; but after a ship had been
lighted for the purpose, Vice-Admiral Knowles reported
that a bomb-ketch had run a-ground at above the distance
of two miles from the fort; upon which the project of
battering or bombarding the fort was abandoned. The
admiral likewise proposed to bombard Rochelle; but this
overture was over-ruled, for reasons which we need not
mention. It was at length determined, in a council of
war held on the eighth, to make a descent, and attack
the sorts leading to and upon the mouth of the river Cha∣rente.
An order, in consequence of this resolution, was
immediately issued for the troops to be ready to embark
from the transports in the boats precisely at twelve o'clock
at night. Accordingly, the boats were prepared, and filled
with the men at the time appointed, and now they
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
remained beating against each other, and the sides of the
ships, for the space of four hours, while the council were
determining whether, after all the trouble given, they
should land; when at length an order was published for
the troops to return to their respective transports, and all
thoughts of a descent, to appearance, were wholly aban∣doned.
The succeeding days were employed in blowing
up and demolishing the fortifications of Aix; after which,
the land officers, in a council of war, took the final reso∣lution
of returning to England without any further at∣tempts,
fully satisfied they had done all in their power to
execute the designs of the ministry, and choosing rather to
oppose the frowns of an angry s—, the murmurings of
an incensed nation, and the contempt of mankind, than
fight a handful of dastardly militia. Such was the issue
of an expedition that raised the expectation of all Europe,
threw the coasts of France into the utmost confusion, and
cost the people of England little less than a million of
money.</P>
<P>§ X. The fleet was no sooner returned than the whole
nation was in a ferment. The publick expectation had
been wound up to the highest pitch, and now the disap∣pointment
was proportioned to the sanguine hopes con∣ceived
that the pride of France would have been humbled
by so formidable an armament. The ministry, and with
them the national voice, exclaimed against the command∣ing
officers, and the military men retorted the calumny,
by laying the blame on the projectors of the enterprise,
who had put the nation to great expense, before they had
obtained the necessary information. Certain it was, that
blame must fall somewhere, and the ministry resolved to
acquit themselves and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix the accusation, by requesting his
Majesty to appoint a board of officers of character and
ability to enquire into the causes of the late miscarriage.
This alone it was that could appease the publick clamours,
and afford general satisfaction. The enemies of Mr. Pitt
endeavoured to wrest the miscarriage of the expedition to
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
his prejudice, but the whispers of faction were soon
drowned in the voice of the whole people of England, who
never could persuade themselves that a gentleman, raised
to the height of power and popularity by mere dint of
superior merit, integrity, and disinterestedness, would now
sacrifice his reputation by a mock armament, or hazard
incurring the derision of Europe, by neglecting to obtain
all the necessary previous information, or doing whatever
might contribute to the success of the expedition. It was
asked whether reason or justice dictated, that a late un∣fortunate
admiral should be capitally punished for not
trying and exerting his utmost ability to relieve Fort St.
Philip's, invested by a powerful army, and surrounded
with a numerous fleet, while no charge of negligence or
cowardice was brought against those who occasioned the
miscarriage of a well-concerted and well-appointed expe∣dition?
The people, they said, were not to be quieted
with the resolutions of a council of war, composed of men,
whose inactivity might frame excuses for declining to ex∣pose
themselves to danger. It was publickly mentioned,
that such backwardness appeared among the general offi∣cers
before the fleet reached the isle of Oleron as occasioned
the admiral to declare with warmth, that he would com∣ply
with his orders, and go into Basque road, whatever
might be the consequence. It was asked why the army
did not land on the night of the twenty-third or
twenty-fourth, and whether the officers sent out to re∣connoitre
had returned with such intelligence as seemed
to render a descent impracticable? It was asked, whether
the commander in chief had complied with his Majesty's
orders, “To attempt, as far as should be sound practica∣ble,
a descent on the coast of France, at or near Roche∣fort,
in order to attack, and, by a vigorous impression,
force that place; and to burn and destroy, to the utmost
of his power, all docks, magazines, arsenals, and ship∣ping,
as shall be found there?” Such rumours as these,
every where propagated, rendered an enquiry no less ne∣cessary
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
to the reputation of the officers on the expedition
than to the minister who had projected it. Accordingly
a board, consisting of three officers of rank, reputation,
and ability, was appointed by his Majesty to enquire into
the reasons why the fleet returned without having exe∣cuted
his Majesty's orders.</P>
<P>§ XI. The three general officers who met on the
twenty-first of the same month, were Charles, Duke of
Marlborough, lieutenant-general, Major-generals Lord
George Sackville and John Waldegrave. To judge of the
practicability of executing his Majesty's orders, it was
necessary to enquire into the nature of the intelligence
upon which the expedition was projected. The first and
most important was a letter sent to Sir John, afterwards
Lord Ligonier, by Lieutenant-Colonel Clark. This letter
had been frequently examined in the privy-council, and
contained in substance, That Colonel Clark, in returning
from Gibraltar, in the year one thousand seven hundred
and fifty-four, had travelled along the western coast of
France, to observe the condition of the fortifications, and
judge how far a descent would be practicable, in case of a
rupture between Great-Britain and France. On his
coming to Rochefort, where he was attended by an en∣gineer,
he was surprised to find the greatest part of a good
rampart, with a revetement, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lanked only with redans; no
outworks, no covered-way, and in many places no ditch,
so that the bottom of the wall was seen at a distance. He
remembered, that in other places, where the earth had
been taken out to form the rampart, there was left round
them a considerable height of ground, whence an enemy
might draw a great advantage: that for above the length
of a front, or two or three hundred yards, there was no
rampart, or even entrenchment, but only small ditches, in
the low and marshy grounds next the river, which however
were dry at low water; yet the bottom remained muddy
and slimy. Towards the river no rampart, no batteries,
no parapet, on either side appeared, and on the land side he
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
observed some high ground within the distance of one hun∣dred
and fifty or two hundred yards of the town, in which
condition the Colonel was told by the engineer the place
had remained for above seventy years. To prevent giving
umbrage, he drew no plan of the place, and even burnt
the few sketches he had by him: however, as to utility,
the Colonel declared himself as much satisfied as if he had
taken a plan. He could not ascertain the direct height of
the rampart, but thought it could not exceed twenty-five
feet, including the parapet. The river might be about
one hundred and thirty feet broad, and the entrance de∣fended
by two or three small redoubts. As to forces, none
are ever garrisoned at Rochefort, except marines, which,
at the time the Colonel was on the spot, amounted to about
one thousand. This was the first intelligence the mini∣stry
received of the state of Rochefort, which afforded
sufficient room to believe that an attack by surprise might
be attended with happy consequences. It was true, that
Colonel Clark made his observations in time of peace,
but it was likewise probable, that no great alterations were
made on account of the war, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he place had remained in
the same condition during the two or three last wars with
France, when they had the same reasons as now to expect
their coasts would be insulted. The next information was
obtained from Joseph Thierry, a French pilot, of the pro∣testant
religion, who passed several examinations before the
privy-council. This person declared that he had followed
the business of a pilot on the coast of France for the space
of twenty years, and served as first pilot in several of the
King's ships: that he had, in particular, piloted the Mag∣nanime,
before she was taken by the English, for about
twenty-two months, and had often conducted her into the
road of the Isle of Aix; and that he was perfectly ac∣quainted
with the entrance, which, indeed, is so easy as
to render a pilot almost unnecessary. The road, he said,
afforded good anchorage in twelve or fourteen fathom
water, as far as Bayonne: the channel between the islands
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
of Oleron and Rhé was three leagues broad, and the banks
necessary to be avoided lay near the land, except one called
the Boiard, which is easily discerned by the breakers. He
affirmed that the largest vessels might draw up close to the
fort of Aix, which he would undertake the Magnanime
alone should destroy; that the largest ships might come
up to the Vigerot, two miles distant from the mouth of the
river, with all their cannon and stores: that men might
be landed to the north of fort Fouras, out of sight of the
fort, upon a meadow where the ground is firm and level,
under cover of the cannon of the fleet. This landing place
he reckoned at about five miles from Rochefort, the way
dry, and no way intercepted by ditches and morasses. He
said great part of the city was encompassed by a wall; but
towards the river, on both sides, for about sixty paces, it
was enclosed only with pallisadoes, without a fosse. To
the intelligence of Col. Clark and Thierry the ministry
added a secret account obtained of the strength and distri∣bution
of the French forces, whence it appeared highly
probable that no more than ten thousand men could be
allowed for the defence of the whole coast, from St. Valery
to Bourdeaux. In consequence of the above information
the secret expedition was planned; instructions were given
to Sir John Mordaunt and Admiral Hawke to make a
vigorous impression on the French coast, and all the other
measures projected, which it was imagined would make an
effectual diversion, by obliging the enemy to employ a great
part of their forces at home, disturb and shake the credit
of their public loans, impair the strength and resources
of their navy, disconcert their extensive and dangerous
operations of war, and, finally, give life, strength, and
lustre to the common cause and his Majesty's arms. The
board of enquiry took next into consideration the several
letters and explanatory instructions sent to Sir John
Mordaunt, in consequence of some difficulties which might
possibly occur, stated by that general in letters to the
minister, previous to his sailing. Then they examined
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
the report made to Sir Edward Hawke by Admiral Brode∣rick,
and the captains of men of war sent to sound the
French shore from Rochelle to fort Fouras, dated Septem∣ber
the twenty-ninth; the result of the councils of war on
the twenty-fifth and twenty-eighth; Sir Edward Hawke's
letter to Sir John Mordaunt on the twenty-seventh, and
the general's answer on the twenty-ninth: after which
Sir John Mordaunt was called upon to give his reasons
for not putting his Majesty's instructions and orders in
execution. This he did in substance as follows: The
attempt on Rochefort he understood was to have been on
the footing of a <HI>coup de main</HI> or surprise, which it would be
impossible to execute if the design was discovered or the
alarm taken. He also understood that an attempt could
not be made, nay, that his Majesty did not require it
should, unless a proper place for debarking, and a safe re∣treat
for the troops was discovered; particularly where
the ships could protect them, and a safe communication
with the fleet, and conveyance of supplies from it, were
found. His sentiments, he said, were confirmed by a
paper to this purpose, delivered to him by Sir John Li∣gonier,
on his first being appointed to command the ex∣pedition.
It was likewise probable, he thought, that al∣though
Rochefort should have remained in the situation in
which Colonel Clark and the pilot Thierry had seen it
three years before, yet that a few days preparation could
make it sufficiently defensible against a <HI>coup de main.</HI>
Judging, therefore, the dependance on such an operation
alone improper, he applied to the ministry for two more
old battalions, and artillery for a regular attack to force
the place, which, from its construction, appeared as diffi∣cult
to be made defensible against the latter, as easily se∣cured
against the former. But this request being refused,
he still thought it his duty to obey his orders on the foot∣ing
on which the expedition was planned, especially as he
understood his instructions were discretionary, regarding
the circumstances of the time, the condition of the place,
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
and the nature of the service. He recited the positive and
credible intelligence received, as well before the embarka∣tion
as during the voyage, of the alarm given to France,
and the preparations made along the French coasts from
Brest and St. Maloes to Rochefort: the accidents that
kept the fleet hovering along the coasts, and prevented the
possibility of an attempt by surprise; the reports of all the
gentlemen employed in sounding the coasts, so contrary to
the intelligence given by Thierry the pilot: the opinion
of the council of war, by which he was enjoined to act,
and with which his own judgment concurred: the en∣deavours
used, after the twenty-sixth, to find out some
expedient for annoying the enemy and executing his Ma∣jesty's
instructions: the attempt made to land, in conse∣quence
of the resolution of the second council of war,
which was prevented by boisterous and stormy weather,
and, lastly, the reasons that determined him, in concert
with the other land officers, to return to England.</P>
<P>§ XII. Having considered all these circumstances, and
examined several officers who served in the expedition, the
court of enquiry gave in the following report to his Ma∣jesty:—
“It appears to us, that one cause of the expe∣dition
having failed is the not attacking fort Fouras by
sea, at the same time that it could have been attacked by
land agreeably to the first design, which certainly must
have been of the greatest utility towards carrying your
Majesty's instructions into execution. It was at first re∣solved
by Admiral Hawke (Thierry, the pilot, having un∣dertaken
the safe conduct of a ship to sort Fouras for that
purpose) but afterwards laid aside, upon the representa∣tion
of Vice Admiral Knowles, that the Barsleur, the
ship designed for that service, was a-ground, at the di∣stance
of between four and five miles from the shore: but
as neither Sir Edward Hawke or the pilot could attend to
give information upon that head, we cannot presume
to offer any certain opinion thereupon. We conceive
another cause of the failure of the expedition to have
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
been, that, instead of attempting to land when the report
was received, on the twenty-fourth of September, from
Read-Admiral Broderick, and the captains who had been
out to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound and reconnoitre, a council of war was sum∣moned,
and held on the twenty-fifth, in which it was
unanimously resolved not to land, as the attempt on
Rochefort was neither adviseable or practicable: but it
does not appear to us that there were then, or at any time
afterwards, either a body of troops or batteries on shore
sufficient to have prevented the attempting a descent, in
pursuance of the instructions signed by your Majesty:
neither does it appear to us that there were any reasons
sufficient to induce the council of war to believe that
Rochefort was so changed in respect to its strength, or
posture of defence, since the expedition was first resolved
on in England, as to prevent all attempts of an attack
upon the place, in order to burn and destroy the docks,
magazines, arsenals, and shipping, in obedience to your
Majesty's command. And we think ourselves obliged to
remark, in the council of war on the twenty-eighth of
September, that no reason could have existed sufficient
to prevent the attempt of landing the troops, as the coun∣cil
then unanimously resolved to land with all possible di∣spatch.
We beg leave also to remark, that after its being
unanimously resolved to land, in the council of war of the
twenty-eighth of September, the resolution was taken of re∣turning
to England, without any regular or general meeting
of the said council: but as the whole operation was of so
inconsiderable a nature, we do not offer this to your Ma∣jesty
as a cause of the failure of the expedition, since we
cannot but look upon the expedition to have failed from
the time the great object of it was laid aside in the council of
war of the twenty-fifth.”</P>
<P>§ XIII. This report, signed by the general officers
Marlborough, Sackville, and Waldegrave, probably laid
the foundation for the court-martial which sat soon after
upon the conduct of the commander in chief on the ex∣pedition.
The enemies of the m—r made a handle of
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
the miscarriage to lessen him in the esteem of the public<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by laying the whole blame on his forming a project s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
expensive to the nation, on intelligence not only slight <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the first view, but false upon further examination. B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the people were still his advocates, they discerned some
thing mysterious in the whole conduct of the commande
in chief. They plainly perceived that caution took plac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of vigour, and that the hours for action were spent in de
liberations and councils of war. Had he debarked th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
troops, and made such an attack as would have distinguishe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his courage, the voice of the people would have acquitte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
him, however unsuccessful, though prudence, perhaps
might have condemned him. Even Braddock's rashne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
they deemed preferable to M—'s inactivity: the loss <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
so many brave lives was thought less injurious and disgrace<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful
to the nation than the too safe return of the presen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
armament. The one demonstrated that the British spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
still existed; the other seemed to indicate the too powerfu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
influence of wealth, luxury, and those manners which
tend to debauch and emasculate the mind. A public<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
trial of the commander in chief was expected by the peo∣ple,
and it was graciously granted by his Majesty. It <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
even thought that Sir John Mordaunt himself demanded
to have his conduct scrutinised, by which method alone
he was sensible his character could be re-established. His
Majesty's warrant for holding a court-martial was accord∣ingly
signed on the third day of December. The cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
was composed of nine lieutenant-generals, nine major-generals,
and three colonels, who sat on the fourteenth,
and continued by several adjournments to the twentieth.
Lieutenant-General Sir John Mordaunt came prisoner
before the court, and the following charge was exhibited
against him; namely, That he being appointed by the
King commander in chief of his Majesty's forces sent on
an expedition to the coast of France, and having received
orders and instructions relative thereto from his Majesty,
under his royal sign-manual, and also by one of his prin∣cipal
secretaries of state, had disobeyed his Majesty's said
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
orders and instructions. The proceedings of this court
were nearly similar to those of the court of enquiry. The
same evidences were examined, with the addition of Sir
Edward Hawke's deposition; and a defence, differing in
no essential point from the former, made by the prisoner,
but the judgement given was clear and explicit. Sir John
Mordaunt was unanimously found Not guilty, and there∣fore
acquitted, while the publick opinion remained un∣altered,
and many persons inveighed as bitterly against the
lenity of the present-court-martial as they had formerly
against the severity of the sentence passed upon a late un∣fortunate
admiral. The evidence of one gentleman in
particular drew attention: he was accused of tergiversa∣tion,
and of showing that partial indulgence which his
own conduct required. He publickly defended his cha∣racter:
his performance was censured, and himself dis∣missed
the service by his sovereign.</P>
<P>§ XIV. Besides the diversion intended by a descent on
the coast of France, several other methods were employed
to amuse the enemy, as well as to protect the trade of the
kingdom, secure our colonies in the West-Indies, and in∣sure
the continuance of the extraordinary success which
had lately blessed his Majesty's arms in the East-Indies;
but these we could not mention before without breaking
the thread of our narration. On the ninth of February
Admiral West sailed with a squadron of men of war to the
westward, as did Admiral Coates with the fleet under his
convoy to the West-Indies, and Commodore Stevens with
the trade to the East-Indies in the month of March. Ad∣miral
Holbourn and Commodore Holmes, with eleven ships
of the line, a fire-ship, bomb-ketch, and fifty transports,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed from St. Helen's for America in April. The Ad∣miral
had on board six thousand two hundred effective men,
exclusive of officers, under the command of General
Hopson, assisted by Lord Charles Hay. In May Admiral
Osborne, who had been forced back to Plymouth with his
squadron by stress of weather, set <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail for the Mediter∣ranean,
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
as did two ships of war sent to convoy the Am<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rican
trade.</P>
<P>§ XV. In the mean time, the privateers fitted out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
private merchants and societies greatly annoyed the Fren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
commerce. The Antigallican, a private ship of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
equipped by a society of men who assumed that nam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
took the Duke de Penthievre Indiaman off the port of C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>runna,
and carried her into Cadiz. The prize was est<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

application was made by France to the court of Spain <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
restitution, while the proprietors of the Antigallican we

that the Penthievre was first violently wrested out of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
nineteen, whence the merchants sustained considerable
damage, and a great quantity of valuable commodities, in∣digo
in particular, was lost to this country.</P>
<P>§ XVI. Notwithstanding the large imports of grain
from different parts of Europe and America, the artifice of
engrossers still kept up the price of corn. So incensed
were the populace at the iniquitous combinations entered
into to frustrate the endeavours of the legislature, and to
oppress the poor, that they rose in a tumultuous manner in
several counties, sometimes to the number of five or six
thousand, and seized upon the grain brought to market.
Nor was it indeed to be wondered at, considering the di∣stress
to which many persons were reduced. The difficulty
of obtaining the necessaries of life raised the price of labour
at the most unseasonable time, when all manufacturers
were overstocked for want of a proper market, which obliged
them to dismiss above half the hands before employed.
Hence arose the most pitiable condition of several thousands
of useful industrious subjects; a calamity attended only
with one advantage to the publick, namely, the facility
with which recruits were raised for his Majesty's service.
At last the plentiful crops with which it pleased Provi∣dence
to bless these kingdoms, the prodigious quantities
of corn imported from foreign countries, and the wise mea∣sures
of the legislature, broke all the villainous schemes set
on foot by the forestallers and engrossers, and reduced the
price of corn to the usual standard. The publick joy on
this event was greatly augmented by the safe arrival of the
fleet from the Leeward Islands, consisting of ninety-two
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail, and of the Straits fleet, esteemed worth three mil∣lions
sterling, whereby the silk manufacturers in particular
were again employed, and their distresses relieved. About
the same time the India company was highly elated with
the joyful account of the safe arrival and spirited conduct
of three of their captains, attacked in their passage home∣ward
by two French men of war, one of sixty-four, the
other of twenty-six guns. After a warm engagement,
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
which continued for three hours, they obliged the French
ships to sheer off, with scarce any loss on their own side.
When the engagement began, the captains had promised
a reward of a thousand pounds to the crews, by way of
incitement to their valour; and the company doubled the
sum, in recompense of their fidelity and courage. His
Majesty, having taken into consideration the incredible
damage sustained by the commerce of these kingdoms, for
want of proper harbours and forts on the western coast to
receive and protect merchantmen, was graciously pleased
to order that a temporary security should be provided for
the shipping which might touch at Milford-haven, until
the fortifications voted in parliament could be erected.
How far his Majesty's directions were complied with, the
number of merchant ships taken by the enemies privateer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon that coast sufficiently indicated.</P>
<P>§ XVII. Whatever reasons the government had to ex∣pect
the campaign should be vigorously pushed in America,
almost every circumstance turned out contrary to expect∣ation.
Not all the endeavours of the Earl of Loudoun to
quiet the diffentions among the different provinces, and to
establish unanimity and harmony, could prevail. Circum∣stances
required that he should act the part of a mediator,
in order to raise the necessary supplies for prosecuting the
war, without which it was impossible he could appear in
the character of a general. The enemy, in the mean time,
were pursuing the blow given at Oswego, and taking ad∣vantage
of the distraction that appeared in the British
councils. By their successes in the preceding campaign,
they remained masters of all the lakes. Hence they were
furnished with the means of practising on the Indians in
all the different districts, and obliging them, by rewards,
promises, and menaces, to act in their favour. Every
accession to their strength was a real diminution of that
of the British commander; but then the ignorance or
pusillanimity of some of the inserior officers in our back
settlements was, in effect, more beneficial to the enemy
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
than all the vigilance and activity of Montcalm. In con∣sequence
of the shameful loss of Oswego, they voluntarily
abandoned to the mercy of the French general the whole
country of the Five Nations, the only body of Indians who
had inviolably performed their engagements, or indeed
who had preserved any sincere regard for the British go∣vernment.
The communication with these faithful allies
was now cut off, by the imprudent demolition of the forts
we possessed at the great Carrying-place. A strong fort, in∣deed,
was built at Winchester, and called Fort Loudoun,
after the commander in chief, and four hundred Cherokee
Indians joined the English forces at Fort Cumberland:
but this re-enforcement by no means counterbalanced the
losses sustained in consequence of our having imprudently
stopped up Wood creek, and filled it with logs. Every
person the least acquainted with the country readily per∣ceived
the weakness of these measures, by which our whole
frontier was left open and exposed to the irruption of the
savages in the French interest, who would not fail to profit
by our blunders, too notorious to escape them. By the
removal of these barriers, a path was opened to our fine
settlements on those grounds called the German Flats,
and along the Mohawk's river, which the enemy destroy∣ed
with fire and sword before the end of the campaign.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. In the mean time Lord Loudoun was taking
the most effectual steps to unite the provinces, and raise a
force sufficient to give some decisive blow. The attack on
Crown-Point, which had been so long meditated, was laid
aside, as of less importance than the intended expedition
to Louisbourg, now substituted in its place, and undoubt∣edly
a more considerable object in itself. Admiral Hol∣bourn
arrived at Hallifax, with the squadron and trans∣ports
under his command, on the ninth of July; and it
was his lordship's intention to repair thither with all possible
diligence, in order to take upon him the command of the
expedition; but a variety of accidents interposed. It was
with the utmost difficulty he at length assembled a body of
six thousand men, with which he instantly began his
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
march to join the troops lately arrived from England.
When the junction was effected, the whole forces amount∣ed
to twelve thousand men; an army that raised great ex∣pectations.
Immediately some small vessels were sent out
to examine and reconnoitre the condition of the enemy,
and the intermediate time was employed in embarking the
troops, as soon as the transports arrived. The return of
the scouts totally altered the face of affairs: they brought
the unwelcome news, that M. de Bois de la Mothe, who
sailed in the month of May from Brest with a large fleet of
ships of war and transports, was now safe at anchor in the
harbour of Louisbourg. Their intelligence was supported
by the testimony of several deserters; yet still it wanted
confirmation, and many persons believed their account of
the enemy's strength greatly magnified. Such advices,
however, could not but occasion extraordinary fluctuations
in the councils of war at Hallifax. Some were for setting
aside all thoughts of the expedition for that season; while
others, more warm in their dispositions, and sanguine in
their expectations, were for prosecuting it with vigour, in
spite of all dangers and difficulties. Their disputes were
carried on with great vehemence, when a packet bound
from Louisbourg for France was taken by one of the Eng∣lish
ships stationed at Newfoundland. She had letters
on board, which put the enemy's superiority beyond all
doubt, at least by sea. It clearly appeared there were at
that time in Louisbourg six thousand regular troops, three
thousand natives, and one thousand three hundred In∣dians,
with seventeen ships of the line, and three frigates
moored in the harbour; that the place was well supplied
with ammunition, provision, and every kind of military
stores; and that the enemy wished for nothing more than
an attack, which it was probable would terminate to the
disgrace of the assailants, and ruin of the British affairs in
America. The commanders at Hallifax were fully apprised
of the consequences of an unsuccessful attempt; it was,
therefore, almost unanimously resolved to postpone the
expedition to some more convenient opportunity, especially
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
as the season was now far advanced, which alone would
be sufficient to frustrate their endeavours, and render the
enterprise abortive. This resolution seems, indeed, to
have been the most eligible in their circumstances,
whatever constructions might afterwards be given, with
intention to prejudice the publick against the commander
in chief.</P>
<P>§ XIX. Lord Loudoun's departure from New-York,
with all the forces he was able to collect, afforded the
Marquis de Montcalm the fairest occasion of improving
the successes of the former campaign. That general had,
in the very commencement of the season, made three dif∣ferent
attacks on Fort William-Henry, in all of which
he was repulsed by the vigour and resolution of the gar∣rison.
But his disappointment here was balanced by an
advantage gained by a party of regulars and Indians at
Ticonderoga. Colonel John Parker, with a detachment
of near four hundred men, went by water, in whale and
bay boats, to attack the enemy's advanced guard at that
place. Landing at night on an island, he sent before
dawn three boats to the main land, which the enemy way-laid
and took. Having procured the necessary intelligence
from the prisoners of the colonel's designs, they contrived
their measures, placed three hundred men in ambush be∣hind
the point where he proposed landing, and sent three
batteaux to the place of rendezvous. Colonel Parker
mistaking these for his own boats, eagerly put to shore,
was surrounded by the enemy, re-enforced with four hun∣dred
men, and attacked with such impetuosity, that, of
the whole detachment, only two officers and seventy pri∣vate
men escaped. Flushed with this advantage, animated
by the absence of the British commander in chief, then at
Hallifax, and fired with a desire to revenge the disgrace he
had lately sustained before Fort Henry, Montcalm drew
together all his forces, with intention to lay siege to that
place. Fort William-Henry stands on the southern coast
of Lake George: it was built with a view to protect and
cover the frontiers of the English colonies, as well as to
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
command the lake: the fortifications were good, defended
by a garrison of near three thousand men, and covered by
an army of four thousand, under the conduct of General
Webb, posted at no great distance. When the Marquis
de Montcalm had assembled all the forces at Crown-Point,
Ticonderoga, and the adjacent posts, together with
a considerable body of Canadians and Indians, amounting
in the whole to near ten thousand men, he marched directly
to the fort, made his approaches, and began to batter it
with a numerous train of artillery. On the very day he
invested the place, he sent a letter to Colonel Monro, the
governor, telling him, he thought himself obliged, in hu∣manity,
to desire he would surrender the fort, and not pro∣voke
the great number of savages in the French army by
a vain resistance. “A detachment of your garrison has
lately, says he, experienced their cruelty; I have it yet
in my power to restrain them, and oblige them to observe
a capitulation, as none of them hitherto are killed.
Your persisting in the defence of your fort can only retard
its fate a few days, and must of necessity expose an un∣fortunate
garrison, who can possibly receive no relief,
considering the precautions taken to prevent it. I demand
a decisive answer, for which purpose I have sent the Sieur
Funtbrune, one of my aides-du-camp. You may credit
what he will inform you of, from Montcalm.” Gen.
Webb beheld his preparations with an indifference and
security bordering on infatuation. It is credibly reported,
that he had private intelligence of all the French general's
designs and motions; yet, either despising his strength, or
discrediting the information, he neglected collecting the
militia in time, which, in conjunction with his own forces,
would probably have obliged Montcalm to relinquish the
attempt, or, at least, have rendered his success very doubtful
and hazardous. The enemy meeting with no disturbance
from the quarter they most dreaded, prosecuted the siege
with vigour, and were warmly received by the garrison,
who fired with great spirit till they had burst almost all
their cannon, and expended their ammunition. Neither
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
Montcalm's promises or threats could prevail upon them to
surrender, while they were in a condition to defend them∣selves,
or could reasonably expect assistance from General
Webb. They even persisted to hold out after prudence
dictated they ought to surrender. Colonel Monro was
sensible of the importance of his charge, and imagined
that General Webb, though slow in his motions, would
surely make some vigorous efforts either to raise the siege,
or force a supply of ammunition, provision, and other ne∣cessaries
into the garrison. At length necessity obliged
him, after sustaining a siege from the third to the ninth
day of August, to hang out a flag of truce, which was
immediately answered by the French commander. Hos∣tages
were exchanged, and articles of capitulation signed
by both parties. It was stipulated, that the garrison of
Fort William-Henry, and the troops in the retrenched
camp, should march out with their arms, the baggage of
the officers and soldiers, and all the usual necessaries of
war; escorted by a detachment of French troops, and in∣terpreters
attached to the savages: that the gate of the fort
should be delivered to the troops of the Most Christian
King, immediately after signing the capitulation; and
the retrenched camp, on the departure of the British forces:
that the artillery, warlike stores, provision, and in general
every thing, except the effects of the soldiers and officers,
should, upon honour, be delivered to the French troops;
for which purpose it was agreed there should be delivered,
with the capitulation, an exact inventory of the stores,
and other particulars specified: that the garrison of the
fort, and the troops in the retrenchment and dependencies,
should not serve for the space of eighteen months, from the
date of the capitulation, against his Most Christian Ma∣jesty,
or his allies: that with the capitulation there should
be delivered an exact state of the troops, specifying the
names of the officers, engineers, artillery men, commissa∣ries,
and all employed: that the officers and soldiers,
Canadians, women, and savages, made prisoners by land
since the commencement of the war in North-America,
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
should be delivered in the space of three months at Carri∣lon;
in return for whom an equal number of the garrison
of Fort William-Henry should be capacitated to serve,
agreeably to the return given by the English officer, and
the receipt of the French commanding officers, of the
prisoners so delivered: that an officer should remain as an
hostage, till the safe return of the escort sent with the
troops of his Britannick Majesty: that the sick and wound∣ed,
not in a condition to be transported to Fort Edward,
should remain under the protection of the Marquis de
Montcalm; who engaged to use them with tenderness and
humanity, and to return them as soon as recovered: that
provision for two days should be issued out for the British
troops: that in testimony of his esteem and respect for
Colonel Monro and his garrison, on account of their gal∣lant
defence, the Marquis de Montcalm should return one
cannon, a six pounder.—Whether the Marquis de Mont∣calm
was really assiduous to have these articles punctually
executed we cannot pretend to determine; but certain
it is, they were perfidiously broke, in almost every instance.
The savages in the French interest either paid no regard
to the capitulation, or were permitted, from views of
policy, to act the most treacherous, inhuman, and in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idi∣ous
part. They fell upon the British troops as they march∣ed
out, despoiled them of their few remaining effects,
dragged the Indians in the English service out of their
ranks▪ and assassinated them with circumstances of un∣heard-of
barbarity. Some British soldiers, with their
wives and children, are said to have been savagely murther∣ed
by those brutal Indians, whose ferocity the French
commander could not effectually restrain. The greater
part of the English garrison, however, arrived at Fort
Edward, under protection of the French escort. The
enemy demolished the fort, carried off the effects, provi∣sion,
artillery, and every thing else lest by the garrison,
together with the vessels preserved in the lake, and de∣parted,
without pursuing their success by any other at∣tempt.
Thus ended the third campaign in America, where,
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
with an evident superiority over the enemy, an army of
twenty thousand regular troops, a great number of pro∣vincial
forces, and a prodigious naval power, not less
than twenty ships of the line, we abandoned our allies,
exposed our people, suffered them to be cruelly massacred
in sight of our troops, and relinquished a large and va∣luable
tract of country, to the eternal reproach and dis∣grace
of the British name.</P>
<P>§ XX. As to the naval transactions in this country,
though less infamous, they were not less unfortunate.
Immediately on Lord Loudoun's departure from Hallifax,
Admiral Holbourn, now freed from the care of the trans∣ports,
set sail for Louisbourg, with fifteen ships of the line,
one ship of fifty guns, three small frigates, and a fire-ship.
What the object of this cruise might have been can only
be conjectured. Some imagine curiosity was the Admi∣ral's
sole motive, and the desire of informing himself with
certainty of the enemy's strength, while others persuade
themselves that he was in hopes of drawing M. de la Mothe
to an engagement, notwithstanding his superiority in num∣ber
of ships and weight of metal. Be this as it may, the
British squadron appeared off Louisbourg on the twen∣tieth
day of August, and approaching within two miles
of the batteries, saw the French admiral make the signal
to unmoor. Mr. Holbourn was greatly inferior in strength,
and it is obvious that his design was not to fight the ene∣my,
as he immediately made the best of his way to Halli∣fax.
About the middle of September, being re-enforced
with four ships of the line, he again proceeded to Louis∣bourg,
probably with intention, if possible, to draw the
enemy to an engagement; but he found De la Mothe too
prudent to hazard an unnecessary battle, the loss of which
would have greatly exposed all the French colonies. Here
the English squadron continued cruising until the twenty-fifth,
when they were overtaken by a terrible storm from
the southward. When the hurricane began, the fleet was
about forty leagues distant from Louisbourg: but were
driven in twelve hours within two mises of the rocks and
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
breakers on that coast, when the wind providentially
shifted. The ship Tilbury was wrecked upon the rocks,
and half her crew drowned. Eleven ships were dis∣masted,
others threw their guns overboard; and all re∣turned
in a very shattered condition to England, at a very
unfavourable season of the year. In this manner ended
the expedition to Louisbourg, more unfortunate to the
nation than the preceding designs upon Rochefort; less
disgraceful to the commanders, but equally the occasion
of ridicule and triumph to our enemies. Indeed, the un∣happy
consequences of the political disputes at home,
the instability of the administration, and the frequent re∣volutions
in our councils were strongly manifested by that
langour infused into all our military operations, and general
unsteadiness in our pursuits. Faction in the mother
country produced divisions and misconduct in the colo∣nies.
No ambition to signalise themselves appeared among
the officers, from the uncertainty whether their services
were to be rewarded or condemned. Their attachment to
particular persons weakened the love they ought to have
entertained for their country in general, and destroyed
that spirit of enterprise, that firmness and resolution which
constitutes the commander, and without which the best
capacity, joined to the most uncorruptible integrity, can
effect nothing.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The French King not only exerted himself
against the English in America, but even extended his
operations to their settlements in Africa, which he sent one
of his naval commanders, with a small squadron, to reduce.
This gentleman, whose name was Kersin, had scoured the
coast of Guinea, and made prize of several English trading
ships: but his chief aim was to reduce the castle at Cape-coast,
of which had he gained possession, the other subor∣dinate
forts would have submitted without opposition.
When Mr. Bell, the governor of this castle, received intel∣ligence
that M. de Kersin was a few leagues to windward,
and certainly intended to attack Cape-coast, his whole
garrison did not exceed thirty white men, exclusive of a few
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
Mulatto soldiers: his stock of ammunition was reduced to
half a barrel of gunpowder; and his fortifications were so
crasy and inconsiderable, that, in the opinion of the best
engineers, they could not have sustained for twenty minutes
the fire of one great ship, had it been properly directed and
maintained. In these circumstances, few people would
have dreamed of making any preparation for defence; but
Mr. Bell entertained other sentiments, and acquitted him∣self
with equal courage and discretion. He forthwith pro∣cured
a supply of gunpowder, and a re-enforcement of
about fifty men, from certain trading vessels that happened
to be upon that part of the coast. He mounted some
spare cannon upon an occasional battery, and assembling a
body of twelve hundred negroes, well armed, under the
command of their chief, on whose attachment he could
depend, ordered them to take post at the place where he
apprehended the enemy would attempt a landing. These
precautions were hardly taken when the French squadron,
consisting of two ships of the line and a large frigate, ap∣peared,
and in a little time their attack began, but they
met with such a warm reception, that in less than two
hours they desisted, leaving the castle very little damaged,
and immediately made sail for the West-Indies, very much
to the disappointment and mortification of the Dutch offi∣cers
belonging to the fort of Elmina, in the same neigh∣bourhood,
who made no scruple of expressing their wishes
publickly in favour of the French commodore, and at a
distance viewed the engagement with the most partial
eagerness and impatience. M. de Kersin was generally
blamed for his want of conduct and resolution in this at∣tempt:
but he is said to have been deceived in his opinion
of the real state of Cape-coast castle by the vigorous and
resolute exertions of the governor, and was apprehensive of
losing a mast in the engagement; a loss which he could
not have repaired on the whole coast of Africa. Had the
fort of Cape-coast been reduced on this occasion, in all pro∣bability
every petty republick of the Negroes settled under
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
the protection of the forts on the Gold Coast would have
revolted from the British interest: for while the French
squadron, in their progress along shore, hovered in the
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing at Anamaboe, an English settlement a few leagues
to leeward of Cape-coast, John Corrantee, the caboceiro,
chief magistrate and general of the Blacks on that part of
the coast, whose adopted son had a few years before been
caressed, and even treated as a prince in England, taking
it for granted that this enterprise of the French would be
attended with success, actually sent some of his depend∣ants,
with a present of refreshments for their commodore;
the delivery of which, however, was prevented by Mr.
Brew, the English chief of the fort, who shattered in
pieces the canoe before it could be launched, and threat∣ened
with his cannon to level the black town with the
dust. The caboceiro, though thus anticipated in his de∣sign,
resolved to be among the first who should compliment
M. de Kersin on his victory at Cape-coast; and, with
this view, prepared an embassy or deputation to go there
by land; but, understanding that the French had failed
in their attempt, he shifted his design, without the least
hesitation, and dispatched the same embassy to Mr. Bell,
whom he congratulated on his victory, assuring him he had
kept his men ready armed to march at the first summon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to
his assistance.</P>
<P>§ XXII. In the East-Indies the scene was changed
greatly to the honour and advantage of Great-Britain.
There the commanders acted with that harmony, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and unanimity becoming Britons, zealous for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
their king and the interest of their country. We left Admi∣ral
Watson and Colonel Clive advancing to Calcutta, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
revenge the cruel tragedy acted upon their countrymen the
preceding year. On the twenty-eighth of December, the
fleet proceeded up the river: next day Colonel <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
landed, and with the assistance of the squadron, in twenty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
four hours made himself master of Busbudgia, a place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
great strength, though very ill defended. On the first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
January the Admiral, with two ships, appeared before the
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
town of Calcutta, and was received by a brisk fire from
the batteries. This salute was returned so warmly, that
the enemies guns were soon silenced, and in less than two
hours the place and fort were abandoned. Colonel Clive,
on the other side, had invested the town, and made his
attack with that vigour and intrepidity peculiar to himself,
which greatly contributed to the sudden reduction of the
settlement. As soon as the fort was surrendered, the brave
and active Captain Coote, with his Majesty's troops, took
possession, and found ninety-one pieces of cannon, four
mortars, abundance of ammunition, stores, and provision,
with every requisite for sustaining an obstinate siege.
Thus the English were re-established in the two strongest
fortresses in the Ganges, with the inconsiderable loss of
nine seamen killed, and three soldiers. A few days after,
Hughley, a city of great trade, situated higher up the river,
was reduced with as little difficulty, but infinitely greater
prejudice to the nabob, as here his storehouses of salt, and
vast granaries for the support of his army, were burnt and
destroyed. Incensed at the almost instantaneous loss of all
his conquests, and demolition of the city of Hughley, the
viceroy of Bengal discouraged all advances to an accommo∣dation
which was proposed by the admiral and chiefs of the
company, and assembled an army of twenty thousand horse
and fifteen thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot, fully resolved to expel the
English out of his dominions, and take ample vengeance
for the disgraces he had lately sustained. He was seen
marching by the English camp in his way to Calcutta on
the second of February, where he encamped, about a mile
from the town. Colonel Clive immediately made appli∣cation
to the admiral for a re-enforcement, and six hun∣dred
men, under the command of Captain Warwick, were
accordingly dra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted from the different ships, and sent to
assist his little army. Clive drew out his forces, advanced
in three columns towards the enemy, and began the attack
so vigorously, that the viceroy retreated, after a feeble re∣sistance,
with the loss of a thousand men killed, wounded,
and taken prisoners, five hundred horses, great numbers of
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
draft bullocks, and four elephants. Though this advan∣tage
was less decisive than could be wished, yet it suffici∣ently
intimidated the Nabob into concessions much to the
honour and advantage of the company. Admiral Watson
gave him to understand in a letter, that this was no more
than a specimen of what the British arms, when provoked,
could perform. The Suba desired the negociation might
be renewed, and in a few days the treaty was concluded.
He promised not to disturb the English in any of those
privileges or possessions specified in the firm and granted
by the Mogul: that all merchandise belonging to the
company should pass and repass in every part of the pro∣vince
of Bengal, free of duty: that all the English facto∣ries
seised the preceding year, or since, should be restored,
with the money, goods, and effects appertaining: that all
damages sustained by the English should be repaired, and
their losses repaid: that the English should have liberty to
fortify Calcutta in whatever manner they thought proper
without interruption: that they should have the liberty of
coining all the gold and bullion they imported, which
should pass current in the province: that he would re∣main
in strict friendship and alliance with the English,
use his utmost endeavours to heal up the late divisions,
and restore the former good understanding between them.
All which several articles were solemnly signed and sealed
with the Nabob's own hand.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. Such were the terms obtained for the com∣pany
by the spirited and gallant conduct of the two Eng∣lish
commanders. They had, however, too much discern∣ment
to rely on the promises of a barbarian, who had so
perfidiously broke former engagements; but they prudently
dissembled their sentiments, until they had thoroughly
reinstated the affairs of the company, and reduced the
French power in this province. In order to adjust the
points that required discussion, the select committee for the
company's affairs appointed Mr. Watts, who had been
released from his former imprisonment, as their commissary
at the court of the Suba, to whom he was personally
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
known, as well as to his ministers, among whom he had
required a considerable influence. Nothing less could
have balanced the interest which the French, by their art
of intriguing, had raised among the favourites of the vice∣roy.
While Mr. Watts was employed at Muxadavad,
in counterworking those intrigues, and keeping the Suba
steady to his engagements, the Admiral and Mr. Clive
resolved to avail themselves of their armament in attacking
the French settlements in Bengal. The chief object of
their designs was the reduction of Chandernagore, situated
higher up the river than Calcutta, of considerable strength,
and the chief in importance of any possessed by that nation
in the bay. Colonel Clive being re-enforced by three hun∣dred
men from Bombay, began his march to Chanderna∣gore,
at the head of seven hundred Europeans and one
thousand six hundred Indians, where, on his first arrival,
he took possession of all the out-posts, except one redoubt
mounted with eight pieces of cannon, which he left to be
silenced by the admiral. On the eighteenth of March the
Admirals Watson and Pococke arrived within two miles
of the French settlement, with the Kent, Tiger, and Sa∣lisbury
men of war, and found their passage obstructed by
booms laid across the river, and several vessels sunk in
the channel. These difficulties being removed, they ad∣vanced
early on the twenty-fourth, and drew up in a line
before the fort, which they battered with great fury for
three hours; while Colonel Clive was making his ap∣proaches
on the land side, and playing vigorously from the
batteries he had raised. Their united efforts soon obliged
the enemy to submission. A flag of truce was waved over
the walls, and the place surrendered by capitulation. The
keys were delivered to Captain Latham, of the Tiger, and
in the afternoon Colonel Clive, with the King's troops,
took possession. Thus the reduction of a strong fortress
garrisoned by five hundred Europeans, and one thousand
two hundred Indians, defended by one hundred and
twenty-three pieces of cannon, and three mortars, well
provided with all kinds of stores and necessaries, and of
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
very great importance to the enemy's commerce in India,
was accomplished with a loss not exceeding forty men on
the side of the conquerors. By the treaty of capitulation
the director, counsellors, and in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erior sevants of the settle∣ment
were allowed to depart with their wearing apparel:
the Jesuits were permitted to take away their church orna∣ments,
and the natives to remain in the full exertion of their
liberties; but the garrison were to continue prisoners of war.
The goods and money found in the place were considera∣ble;
but the principal advantage arose from the ruin of the
head settlement of the enemy on the Ganges, which could
not but interfere with the English commerce in these parts.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. Success had hitherto attended all the opera∣tions
of the British commanders, because they were con∣certed
with foresight and unanimity; and executed with
that vigour and spirit which deservedly raised them high
in the esteem of their country. They reduced the Nabob
to reasonable terms of accommodation before they alarm∣ed
the French; and now the power of the latter was de∣stroyed
they entered upon measures to oblige the treache∣rous
viceroy to a strict performance of the treaty he had
so lately signed. However specious his promises were, they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound him extremely dilatory in the execution of several
articles of the treaty, which, in effect, was the same to
the English commerce as if none had been concluded.
The company's goods were loaded with high duties, and
several other infractions of the peace committed, upon
such frivolous pretences as evidently demonstrated that
he sought to come to an open rupture as soon as his pro∣jects
were ripe for execution. In a word, he discovered all
along a manifest partiality to the French, whose emissa∣ries
cajoled him with promises that he should be joined
by such a body of their European troops, under M. de
Bussy, as would enable him to crush the power of the Eng∣lish,
whom they had taught him to fear and to hate. As
recommencing hostilities against so powerful a prince was
in itself dangerous, and, if possible, to be avoided, the
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>air was laid before the council of Calcutta, and can∣vassed
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
with all the circumspection and caution that a mea∣sure
required, on which depended the fate of the whole
trade of Bengal. Mr. Watts from time to time sent them
intelligence of every transaction in the Suba's cabinet,
and although that prince publickly declared he would
cause him to be impaled as soon as the English troops
should be put in motion within the kingdom of Bengal, he
bravely sacrificed his own safety to the interest of the com∣pany,
and exhorted them to proceed with vigour in their
military operations. During these deliberations a most for∣tunate
incident occurred, that soon determined the coun∣cil
to come to an open rupture. The leading persons in
the Viceroy's court found themselves oppressed by his
haughtiness and insolence. The same spirit of discontent
appeared among the principal officers of his army: they
were well acquainted with his perfidy, saw his preparations
for war, and were sensible that the peace of the country
could never be restored, unless either the English were
expelled or the Nabob deposed. In consequence, a plan
was concerted for divesting him of all his power; and the
conspiracy was conducted by Jassier Ali Khan, his prime
minister and chief commander, a nobleman of great in∣fluence
and authority in the province. The project was
communicated by Ali Khan to Mr. Watts, and so im∣proved
by the address of that gentleman as in a manner to
ensure success. A treaty was actually concluded between
this Meer Jassier Ali Khan and the English company;
and a plan concerted with this nobleman and the other
malecontents for their defection from the Viceroy. These
previous measures being taken, Colonel Clive was ordered
to take the field with his little army. Admiral Watson
undertook the defence of Chandernagore, and the garrison
was detached to re-enforce the Colonel, together with fifty
seamen to be employed as gunners, and in directing the
artillery. Then Mr. Watts, deceiving the Suba's spies,
by whom he was surrounded, withdrew himself from
Muxadavad, and reached the English camp in safety. On
the nineteenth of June a detachment was sent to attack
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
Cutwa fort and town, situated on that branch of the river
forming the island Cassimbuzar. This place surrendered
at the first summons; and here the Colonel halted with
the army for three days, expecting advices from Ali Khan▪
Disappointed of the hoped-for intelligence he crossed the
river, and marched to Plaissey, where he encamped. On
the twenty-third, at day-break, the Suba advanced to
attack him, at the head of fifteen thousand horse, and near
thirty thousand infantry, with about forty pieces of heavy
cannon, conducted and managed by French gunners, on
whose courage and dexterity he placed great dependance.
They began to cannonade the English camp about six in
the morning, but a severe shower falling at noon they
withdrew their artillery. Colonel Clive seised this oppor∣tunity
to take possession of a tank and two other posts of
consequence, which they in vain endeavoured to retake.
Then he stormed an angle of their camp, covered with a
double breast-work, together with an eminence which they
occupied. At the beginning of this attack, some of their
chiefs being slain, the men were so dispirited that they
soon gave way; but still Meer Jassier Ali Khan, who com∣manded
their left wing, forbore declaring himself openly.
After a short contest the enemy were put to flight, the
Nabob's camp, baggage, and fifty pieces of cannon ta∣ken,
and a most complete victory obtained. The Colonel
pursuing his advantage, marched to Muxadavad, the ca∣pital
of the province, and was there joined by Ali Khan
and the mal-contents. It was before concerted that this
nobleman should be invested with the dignity of Nabob;
accordingly, the Colonel proceeded solemnly to depose
Surajah Dowlat, and, with the same ceremony, to substi∣tute
Ali Khan in his room, who was publickly acknow∣ledged
by the people as Suba, or Viceroy, of the provin∣ces
of Bengal, Bahar, and Orixa. Soon after, the late
Viceroy was taken, and put to death by his successor, who
readily complied with all the conditions of his eleva∣tion.
He conferred on his allies very liberal rewards, and
granted the company such extraordinary privileges a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
fully demonstrated how justly he merited their assistance.
By this alliance, and the reduction of Chandernagore, the
French were entirely excluded the commerce of Bengal
and its dependencies; the trade of the English company
was restored, and increased beyond their most sanguine
hopes; a new ally was acquired, whose interest obliged
him to remain firm to his engagements; a vast sum was
paid to the company and the sufferers at Calcutta, to in∣demnify
them for their losses; the soldiers and seamen were
gratified with six hundred thousand pounds, as a reward
for the courage and intrepidity they exerted; and a variety
of other advantages gained, which it would be unnecessary
to enumerate. In a word, in the space of fourteen days a
great revolution was effected, and the government of a vast
country, superior in wealth, fertility, extent, and number
of inhabitants to most European kingdoms, transferred
by a handful of troops, conducted by an officer untu∣tored
in the art of war, and a general rather by intuition
than instruction and experience. But the public joy at
these signal successes was considerably diminished by the
death of Admiral Watson, and the loss of Vizagapatam,
an English settlement on the Coromandel coast. The
Admiral fell a victim to the unwholesomeness of the cli∣mate,
on the sixteenth of August, universally esteemed
and regretted; and the factory and fort at Vizagapatam
were surrendered to the French, a few days after Colonel
Clive had defeated the Nabob.</P>
<P>§ XXV. We now turn our eyes to the continent of
Europe, where we see the beginning of the year marked
with a striking instance of the dreadful effects of frantick
enthusiasm. France had long enjoyed a monarch, easy,
complying, good natured, and averse to all that wore the
appearance of business or of war. Contented with the
pleasures of indolence, he sought no greatness beyond what
he enjoyed, nor pursued any ambitious aim through the
dictates of his own disposition. Of all men on earth such
a prince had the greatest reason to expect an exemption
from plots against his person, and cabals among his sub∣jects;
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
yet was an attempt made upon his life by a man, who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
though placed in the lowest sphere of fortune, had reso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lution
to face the greatest dangers, and enthusiasm suffi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cient
to sustain, without shrinking, all the tortures whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the cruelty of man could invent, or his crimes render ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessary.
The name of this fanatick was Robert Franci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Damien, born in the suburb of St. Catharine, in the
city of Arras. He had lived in the service of several fami∣lies,
whence he was generally dismissed on account of the
impatience, the melancholy, and sullenness of his dispo∣sition.
So humble was the station of a person, who was
resolved to step forth from obscurity, and, by one despe∣rate
effort, draw upon himself the attention of all Europe.
On the fifth day of January, as the King was stepping
into his coach, to return to Trianon, whence he had
that day come to Versailles, Damien, mingling among his
attendants, stabbed him with a knife on the right side,
between the fourth and fifth ribs. His Majesty, applying
his hand immediately to his side, cried out, “I am
wounded! Seize him; but do not hurt him.” Happi∣ly,
the wound was not dangerous; as the knife, taking an
oblique direction, missed the vital parts. As for the as∣sassin,
he made no attempts to escape; but suffering him∣self
quietly to be seized, was conveyed to the guard-room,
where being interrogated if he committed the horrid action,
he boldly answered in the affirmative. A process against
him was instantly commenced at Versailles: many persons,
supposed accessaries to the design upon the King's life,
were sent to the Bastile; the assassin himself was put to
the torture, and the most excruciating torments were ap∣plied,
with intention to extort a confession of the rea∣sons
that could induce him to so execrable an attempt upon
his sovereign. Incisions were made into the muscular
parts of his legs, arms, and thighs, into which boiling
oil was poured. Every re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inement on cruelty, that human
invention could suggest, was practised without effect;
nothing could overcome his obstinacy; and his silence was
construed into a presumption, that he must have had ac∣complices
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
in the plot. To render his punishment more
publick and conspicuous, he was removed to Paris, there
to undergo a repetition of all his former tortures, with
such additional circumstances as the most fertile and cruel
dispositions could devise for increasing his misery and
torment. Being conducted to the Concergerie, an iron
bed, which likewise served for a chair, was prepared for
him, and to this he was fastened with chains. The
torture was again applied, and a physician ordered to
attend, to see what degree of pain he could support.
Nothing, however, material was extorted; for what he
one moment confessed, he recanted the next. It is not
within our province, and we consider it as a felicity, to
relate all the circumstances of this cruel and tragical event.
Sufficient it is, that, after suffering the most exquisite tor∣ments
that human nature could invent, or man support,
his judges thought proper to terminate his misery by a
death shocking to imagination, and shameful to humanity.
On the twenty-eighth day of March he was conducted,
amidst a vast concourse of the populace, to the Greve,
the common place of execution, stripped naked, and
fastened to the seaffold by iron gyves. One of his hands
was then burnt in liquid flaming sulphur, his thighs, legs,
and arms were torn with red hot pincers; boiling oil,
melted lead, resin, and sulphur, were poured into the
wounds; tight ligatures tied round his limbs to prepare
him for dismemberment; young and vigorous horses ap∣plied
to the draft, and the unhappy criminal pulled with
all their force to the utmost extension of his sinews for the
space of an hour, during all which time he preserved his
senses and constancy. At length the physician and
surgeon attending declared it would be impossible to
accomplish the dismemberment, unless the tendons
were separated: upon which orders were given to the
executioner to cut the sinews at the joints of the arms and
legs. The horses drew afresh: a thigh and an arm were
separated, and, after several pulls, the unfortunate wretch
expired under the extremity of pain. His body and limbs
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
were reduced to ashes under the scaffold; his father, wife,
daughter, and family banished the kingdom for ever; the
name of Damien effaced and obliterated, and the innocent
involved in the punishment of the guilty. Thus ended
the procedure against Damien and his family, in a manner
not very favourable to the avowed clemency of Louis, or
the acknowledged humanity of the French nation. It
appeared from undoubted evidence, that the attempt on
the King's life was the result of insanity, and a disturbed
imagination. Several instances of a disordered mind had
before been observed in his conduct, and the detestation
justly due to the enormity of his crime ought now to have
been absorbed in the consideration of his misfortune, the
greatest that can befal human nature.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. Another remarkable event in France, in the
beginning of this year, was the change in the ministry of
that nation, by the removal of M. de Machault, keeper
of the seals, from the post of secretary of state for the
marine; and of M. d'Argenson from that of secretary at
war. Their dismission was sudden and unexpected; nor
was any particular reason assigned for this very unexpect∣ed
alteration. The French King, to shew the Queen of
Hungary how judiciously she had acted in forming an
alliance with the House of Bourbon, raised two great
armies; the first of which, composed of near eighty thou∣sand
men, the flower of the French troops, with a large
train of artillery, was commanded by M. d'Etrées, a gene∣ral
of great reputation; under whom served M. de Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ades,
M. Chevert, and the Count de St. Germain, all
officers of high character. This formidable army passed
the Rhine early in the Spring, and marched by Westpha∣lia,
in order to invade the King of Prussia's dominions,
in quality of allies to the Empress-Queen, and guardians
of the liberties of the Empire. But their real view was to
invade Hanover, a scheme which they knew would make a
powerful diversion of the British force from the prose∣cution
of the war in other parts of the world, where the
strength of France could not be fully exerted, and where
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
their most valuable interests were at stake. They flattered
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemselves, moreover, that the same blow by which they
hoped to crush the King of Prussia might likewise force
his Britannick Majesty into some concessions with regard
to America. The other army of the French, commanded
by the Prince de Soubise, was destined to strengthen the
Imperial army of execution, consisting of twenty-five
thousand men, besides six thousand Bavarians, and four
thousand Wirtembergers. But before these troops, under
Soubise, passed the Rhine, they made themselves masters
of several places belonging to the King of Prussia upon the
borders of the Low Countries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The K—of P—a had withdrawn his garrison from Cleves, not without suspicion of having purposely left this door open to the enemy, that their irruption into G—y might hasten the resolutions of the B—h m—y.</NOTE>; whilst a detachment
from d'Etrees's army seised upon the town of Embden,
and whatever else belonged to the same monarch in East-Friesland.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. At the close of the last campaign, the King
of Prussia, having gained a petty advantage over the Im∣perialists
under the command of Mareschal Brown, and
incorporated into his own troops a great part of the Saxon
army taken prisoners at Pirna, as was observed before,
retired into winter-quarters until the season should permit
him to improve these advantages. His Majesty and Mares∣chal
Keith wintered in Saxony, having their cantonments
between Pirna and the frontier along the Elbe; and
Mareschal Schwerin, returning into Silesia, took up his
quarters in the country of Glatz. In the mean time, the
Empress-Queen, finding the force which she had sent out
against the King of Prussia was not sufficient to prevent
his designs, made the necessary requisitions to her allies
for the auxiliaries they had engaged to furnish. In conse∣quence
of these requisitions, the Czarina, true to her
engagements, dispatched above an hundred thousand of
her troops, who began their march in the month of No∣vember,
and proceeded to the borders of Lithuania, with
design particularly to invade Ducal Prussia, whilst a strong
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
fleet was equipped in the Baltick, to aid the operations
of this numerous army. The Austrian army assembled
in Bohemia amounted to upwards of four-score thousand
men, commanded by Prince Charles of Lorraine and
Mareschal Brown. The Swedes had not yet openly de∣clared
themselves; but it was well known, that though
their king was allied in blood and inclination to his
Prussian Majesty, yet the jealousy which the senate of
Sweden entertained of their sovereign, and the hope of
recovering their ancient possessions in Pom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rania, by me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns
of the present troubles, together with their old attachment
to France, newly cemented by intrigues and subsidies,
would certainly induce them to join in the general confede∣racy.
The Duke of Mecklenbourgh took the same party,
and agreed to join the Swedish army, when it should be
assembled, with six thousand men. Besides all these pre∣parations
against the King of Prussia, he was, in his quality
of Elector of Brandenbourg, put under the ban of the Empire
by the aulick council; declared deprived of all his rights,
privileges, and prerogatives; his fiefs were escheated into the
exchequer of the Empire; and all the circles accordingly
ordered to furnish their respective contingencies for putting
this sentence in execution.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. In this dangerous situation, thus mounced
on all sides, and seemingly on the very brink of inevita<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le
destruction, the Prussian monarch owed his preservation to
his own courage and activity. The Russians, knowing
that the country they were to pass through in their way
to Lithuania would not be able to subsist their prodigious
numbers, had taken care to furnish themselves with provi∣sions
for their march, depending upon the resources they
expected to find in Lithuania, after their arrival in that
country. These provisions were exhausted by the time
they reached the borders of that province, where they
found themselves suddenly and unexpectedly destitute of
subsistence, either to return back or to proceed forward.
The King of Prussia had, with great prudence and fore∣sight,
secured plenty to himself, and distress and famine
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
to his enemies, by buying up all the corn and forage of
the country which these last were entering. Notwith∣standing
these precautions, his Prussian Majesty, to guard
is much as could be against every possible event, sent a
great number of gunners and matrosses from Pomerania
to Memel, with three regiments of his troops, to re-en∣force
the garrison of that place. He visited all the posts
which his troops possessed in Silesia, and gave the neces∣sary
orders for their security. He repaired to Neiss, where
he settled with Mareschal Schwerin the general plan of
the operations of the approaching campaign. There it
was agreed, that the mareschal's army in Silesia, which
consisted of fifty thousand men, should have in constant
view the motions of the royal army, by which its own
were to be regulated, that they might both act in concert,
as circumstances should require. At the same time, other
armies were assembled by the King of Prussia in Lusatia
and Voigtland; twenty thousand men were collected at
Zwickaw, on the frontiers of Bohemia, towards Egra,
under the command of Prince Maurice of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>halt-Dessau;
and sixty thousand chosen troops began their march to∣wards
Great Zeidlitz, where their head-quarters were set∣tled.
In the mean while, the Austrian troops began to form
on the frontiers of Saxony, where some of their detach∣ments
appeared, to watch the motions of the Prussians, who
still continued to pursue their operations with great acti∣vity
and resolution. All possible care was taken by the Prus∣sians
at Dresden to secure a retreat, in case of a de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
As only one regiment of Prussians could be spared to re∣main
there in garrison, the burghers were disarmed, their
arms deposited in the arsenal, and a detachment was post∣ed
at Konigstein, to oblige that fortress to observe a strict
neutrality. All correspondence with the enemy was strictly
prohibited; and it having been discovered that the Coun∣tess
of Ogilive, one of the Queen's maids of honour, had
disobeyed his Majesty's commands, she was arrested; but
on the Queen's intercession, afterwards released. The
Countess of Bruhi, lady of the Saxon prime minister,
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
was also arrested by his Prussian Majesty's order; and, on
her making light of her confinement, and resolving to
see company, she was ordered to quit the court, and re∣tire
from Saxony. M. Henwin, the French Minister, was
told that his presence was unnecessary at Dresden; and
on his replying, that his master had commanded him to
stay, he was again desired to depart; on which he
thought proper to obey. The Count de Waekerbath, mi∣nister
of the cabinet, and grand master of the household to
the Prince Royal of Poland, was arrested, and conducted
to Custrin, by the express command of his Majesty.
The King of Prussia, having thrown two bridges over the
Elbe early in the spring, ordered the several districts of
the electorate of Saxony to supply him with a great num∣ber
of waggons, each drawn by four horses. The circles
of Misnia and Leipsick were enjoined to furnish four hun∣dred
each, and the other circles in proportion.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. While the King of Prussia was taking these
measures in Saxony, two skirmishes happened on the
frontiers of Bohemia, between his troops and the Austri∣ans.
On the twentieth of February, a body of six thousand
Austrians surrounded the little town of Hirscfield in Up∣per
Lusatia, garrisoned by a battalion of Prussian foot. The
first attack was made at four in the morning, on two re∣doubts
without the gates, each of which was defended by
two field pieces: and though the Austrians were several
times repulsed, they at last made themselves masters of one
of the redoubts, and carried off the two pieces of cannon.
In their retreat they were pursued by the Prussians,
who fell upon their rear, killed some, and took many
prisoners; this affair cost the Austrians at least sive hun∣dred
men. About a fortnight after the Prince of Bevern
marched out of Zittau, with a body of near nine thou∣sand
men, in order to destroy the remaining strong holds
possessed by the Austrians on the frontiers. In this expe∣dition
he took the Austrian magazine at Friedland in Bo∣hemia,
consisting of nine thousand sacks of meal, and
great store of ammunition; and, after making himself
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
master of Reichenberg, he returned to Zittau. The van
of his troops, consisting of a hundred and fifty hussars of
the regiment of Putkammer, met with a body of six hun∣dred
Croats, sustained by two hundred Austrian dragoons
of Bathiana, at their entering Bohemia; and immediately
fell upon them sword in hand, killed about fifty, took
thirty horses, and made ten dragoons prisoners. The
Prussians, it is said, did not lose a single man on this oc∣casion;
and two soldiers only were slightly wounded, the
Austrians having made but a slight resistance.</P>
<P>§ XXX. Whatever the conduct of the court of Vienna
might have been to the allies of Great-Britain, still, how∣ever,
proper regard was shown to the subjects of this
crown: for an edict was published at Florence on the
thirteenth of February, wherein his Imperial Majesty, as
Grand Duke of Tuscany, declared his intention of ob∣serving
the most scrupulous neutrality in the then situa∣tion
of affairs. All the ports in that duchy were accord∣ingly
enjoyned to pay a strict regard to this declaration, in
all cases relating to the French or English ships in the
Mediterranean. The good effects of this injunction soon
appeared; for two prizes taken by the English having put
into Porto Ferraro, the captains of two French privateers
addressed themselves to the governor, alledging, that they
were captures of a pirate, and requesting that they might
be obliged to put to sea: but the governor prudently
replied, That as they came in under English colours he
would protect them; and forbad the privateers, at their
peril, to commit any violence. They, however, little
regarding the governor's orders, prepared for sailing, and
sent their boats to cut out one of the prizes. The captain
firing at their boats, killed one of their men, which alarm∣ing
the sentinels, notice was sent to the governor; and he,
in consequence, ordered the two privateers immediately to
depart.—The conduct of the Dutch was rather cautious
than spirited. Whilst his Prussian Majesty was employed
on the side of Bohemia and Saxony, the French auxili∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries
began their march to harrass his defenseless territories
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
in the neighbourhood of the Low Countries. A free
passage was demanded of the States-General through
Namur and Maestricht, for the provisions, ammunition,
and artillery belonging to this new army; and though
the English ambassador remonstrated against their compli∣ance,
and represented it as a breach of the neutrality
their High Mightinesses declared they would observe, yet,
after some hesitation, the demand was granted; and their
inability to prevent the passage of the French troops,
should it be attempted by force, pleaded in excuse of their
conduct.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. Scarce had the French army, commanded by
the Prince de Soubise, set foot in the territories of Juli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s
and Cologn, when they found themselves in possession of
the duchy of Cleves and the county of Mark, where all
things were left open to them, the Prussians, who evacu∣ated
their posts, taking their route along the river Lippe,
in order to join some regiments from Magdebourg, who
were sent to facilitate their retreat. The distressed inhabi∣tants,
thus exposed to the calamities of war from an
unprovoked enemy, were instantly ordered to furnish
contributions, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orage, and provisions, for the use of their
invaders; and, what was still more terrifying to them,
the partizan Fischer, whose cruelties, the last war, they
still remembered with horrour, was again let loose upon
them by the inhumanity of the Empress-Queen. We<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l
was immediately occupied by the French: Emmerick and
Maseyk soon shared the same fate: and the city of Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dres
was besieged, the Prussians seeming resolved to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end
this last place; to which end they opened the sluices, and
laid the country round under water. Those who retreat∣ed,
filing off to the north-west of Paderborn, entered the
county of Ritberg, the property of Count Kaunitz Rit∣berg,
great chancellor to the Empress-Queen. After
taking his castle, in which they sound thirty pieces of
cannon, they raised contributions in the district, to the
amount of forty thousand crowns. As the Prussians re∣tired,
the French took possession of the country they
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
quitted in the name of the Empress-Queen, whose com∣missary
attended them for that purpose. The general
rendezvous of these troops, under Prince Soubise, was
appointed at Neuss, in the electorate of Cologn, where a
large body of French was assembled by the first of April.
The Austrians, in their turn, were not idle. Marshal
Brown visited the fortifications of Brinn and Koninsgratz;
reviewed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he army of the late Prince Picolomini, now
under the command of General Serbelloni; and put his
own army in march for Kostlitz on the Esbe, where he
proposed to establish his head-quarters.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. During the recess of the armies, while the
rigours of winter forced them to suspend their hostile ope∣rations,
and the greatest preparations were making to open
the campaign with all possible vigour, Count Bestucheff,
great chancellor of Russia, wrote a circular letter to the
primate, senators, and ministers of the republick of Po∣land,
settin, forth, “That the Empress of Russia was
extremely affected with the King of Poland's distress,
which she thought could not but excite the compassion of
all other powers, but more especially of his allies: That
the fatal consequences which might result from the rash
step taken by the King of Prussia, not only with respect to
the tranquility of Europe in general, but of each power
in particular, and more espe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly of the neighbouring
countries, were so evident, that the interest and safety of
the several princes rendered it absolutely necessary they
should make it a common cause: not only to obtain proper
satisfaction for those courts whose dominions had been so
unjustly attacked, but likewise to prescribe such bounds
to the King of Prussia as might secure them from any
future apprehensions from so enterprising and restless a
neighbour: that with this view, the Empress was deter∣mined
to assist the King of Poland with a considerable body
of troops, which were actually upon their march<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter was written in December; and the Russians, as we ob∣served before, began their march in November.</NOTE>, under
the command of General Apraxin; and that, as there
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
would be an absolute necessity for their marching through
part of the territories of Poland, her Imperial Majesty
hoped the republick would not fail to facilitate their march
as much as possible.” She further recommended to the
republick, to take some salutary measures for frustrating
the designs of the King of Prussia, and restoring harmony
among themselves, as the most conducive measure to these
good purposes. In this, however, the Poles were so far
from following her advice, that, though sure of being sa∣crificed
in this contest, which side soever prevailed, they
divided into parties with no less zeal than if they had as
much to hope from the prevalence of one side, as to fear
from that of the other. Some of the palatines were for
denying a passage to the Russians, and others were for
affording them the utmost assistance in their power.
With this cause of contention others of a more private
nature fatally concurred, by means of a misunderstanding
between the Prince Czartorinski and Count Mnisnec.
Almost every inhabitant of Warsaw was involved in the
quarrel; and the violence of these factions was so great,
that scarce a night passed without bloodshed, many dead
bodies, chiefly Saxons, being found in the streets every
morning.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. In the mean time, Great-Britain, unsettled
in her ministry and councils at home, unsuccessful in her
attempts abroad, judging peace, if it could be obtained on
just and honourable terms, more eligible than a continental
war, proposed several expedients to the Empress-Queen for
restoring the tranquillity of Germany; but her answer was,
“That whenever she perceived that the expedients pro∣posed
would indemnify her for the extraordinary expenses
she had incurred in her own defence, repair the heavy losses
sustained by her ally the King of Poland, and afford a
proper security for their future safety, she would be ready
to give the same proofs she had always given of her desire
to restore peace; but it could not be expected she should
listen to expedients, of which the King of Prussia was to
reap the whole advantage, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter having begun the war,
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
and wasted the dominions of a prince, who relied for his
security upon the faith of treaties, and the appearance of a
harmony between them.” Upon the receipt of this an∣swer,
the court of London made several proposals to the
Czarina, to interpose as mediatrix between the courts of
Vienna and Berlin, but they were rejected with marks of
displeasure and resentment. When Sir Charles Hanbury
Williams, the British ambassador, continued to urge his
sollicitations very strongly, and even with some hints of
menaces, an answer was delivered to him by order of the
Empress, purporting, “That her Imperial Majesty was
astonished at his demand, after he had already been made
acquainted with the measures she had taken to effect a re∣conciliation
between the courts of Vienna and Berlin.
He might easily conceive, as matters were then situated,
that the earnestness with which he now urged the same
proposition must necessarily surprise her Imperial Majesty,
as it showed but little regard to her former declaration.
The Empress, therefore, commanded his excellency to be
told, that as her intentions contained in her first answer
remained absolutely invariable, no ulterior propositions for
a mediation would be listened to; and that as for the
menaces made use of by his excellency, and particularly
that the King of Prussia himself would soon attack the
Russian army, such threats served only to weaken the am∣bassador's
proposals; to confirm still more, were it possi∣ble,
the Empress in her resolutions; to justify them to
the whole world, and to render the King of Prussia
more blameable.”</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The season now drawing on in which the
troops of the contending powers would be able to take
the field, and the alarming progress of the Russians being
happily stopped, his Prussian Majesty, whose maxim it has
always been to keep the seat of war as far as possible from
his own dominions, resolved to carry it into Bohemia, and
there to attack the Austrians on all sides. To this end
he ordered his armies in Saxony, Misnia, Lusatia, and
Silesia to enter Bohemia in four different and opposite
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
places, nearly at the same time. The first of these he
commanded in person, assisted by Mareschal Keith; the
second was led by Prince Maurice of Anhalt-Dessau, the
third by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick-Bevern, and the
fourth by Mareschal Schwerin. In consequence of this
plan, Mareschal Schwerin's army entered Bohemia on the
eighteenth of April, in five columns, at as many different
places. The design was so well concerted, that the
Austrians had not the least suspicion of their approach till
they were past the frontiers, and then they filled the dan∣gerous
defile of Gulder-Oelse with Pandours, to dispute
that passage; but they were no sooner discovered than
two battalions of Prussian grenadiers attacked them with
their bayonets fixed, and routed them. The Prince of
Anhault passed the frontiers from Misnia, and penetrated
into Bohemia on the twenty-first of April without any
resistance. The Prince of Bevern, on the twentieth of
the same month, having marched at the head of a body of
the army, which was in Lusatia, from the quarters of
cantonment near Zittau, possessed himself immediately of
the first post on the frontier of Bohemia, at Krottau and
Grasenstein, without the loss of a single man: drove away
the enemy the same day from Kratzen, and proceeded to
Machendorf, near Reichenberg. The same morning
Putkammer's hussars, who formed part of a corps, com∣manded
by a colonel and major, routed some hundreds of
the enemy's cuirassiers, posted before Cohlin, under the
conduct of Prince Lichtenstein, took three officers and
upwards of sixty horse prisoners, and so dispersed the rest,
that they were scarcely able to rally near Kratzen. Night
coming on obliged the troops to remain in the open air till
the next morning, when, at break of day, the Prussians
marched in two columns by Habendorf, towards the ene∣my's
army, amounting to twenty-eight thousand men,
commanded by Count Konigseg, and posted near R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ichen∣berg.
As soon as the troops were formed they advanced
towards the enemy's cavalry, drawn up in three lines of
about thirty squadrons. The two wings were sustained by
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
the infantry, which was posted among <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lled trees and en∣trenchments.
The Prussians immediately cannonaded the
enemy's cavalry, who received it with resolution, having
on their right hand a village, and on their left a wood,
where they had entrenched themselves. But the Prince
of Bevern having caused fifteen squadrons of dragoons of
the second line to advance, and the wood on his right to
be attacked at the same time by the battalions of grenadiers
of Kahlden and of Moellendorf, and by the regiment of
the Prince of Prussia, his dragoons, who, by clearing the
ground, and possessing the entrenchments, had their flanks
covered, entirely routed the enemy's cavalry. In the mean
time Colonel Putkammer and Major Schenfeld, with their
hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ars, though flanked by the enemy's artillery, gave the
Austrian horse-grenadiers a very warm reception, whilst
General Lestewitz, with the left wing of the Prussians,
attacked the redoubts that covered Reichenberg. Though
there were many defiles and rising grounds to pass, all oc∣cupied
by the Austrians, yet the regiment of Darmstadt
forced the redoubt, and put to slight and pursued the
enemy, after some discharge of their artillery and small
arms, from one eminence to another, for the distance of a
mile, when they left off the pursuit. The action began at
half an hour after six, and continued till eleven. About
one thousand of the Austrians were killed and wounded,
among the former were General Porpora<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i and Count
Hohenfelds, and among the latter Prince Lichtonstein and
Count Mansfeld. Twenty of their o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icers, and four hun∣dred
soldiers, were taken prisoners, and they also lost three
standards. On the side of the Prussians seven subalterns
and about an hundred men were killed, and sixteen officers
and an hundred and fifty men wounded. After this battle
Mareschal Schwerin joined the Prince of Bevern, made
himself master of the greatest part of the circle of Buntzlau,
and took a considerable magazine from the Austrians,
whom he dislodged. The Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, with
his corps, drew near the King of Prussia's army, when the
latter advanced as far as Budin, from whence the Au∣strians,
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
who had an advantageous camp there, retired to
Westwarn, half way between Budin and Prague; and his
Prussian Majesty having passed the Egra, his army, and
that of Mareschal Schwerin, were so situated as to be
able to act jointly.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. These advantages were but the prelude to a
much more decisive victory, which the King himself gained
a few days after. Preparing to enter Bohemia, at a di∣stance
from any of the corps commanded by his generals,
he made a movement as if he had intended to march to∣wards
Egra. The enemy, deceived by this feint, and
imagining he was going to execute some design, distinct
from the object of his other armies, detached a body of
twenty thousand men to observe his motions; then he
made a sudden and masterly movement to the left, by
which he cut off all communication between that detach∣ment
and the main army of the Austrians, which, having
been re-enforced by the army of Moravia, by the remains
of the corps lately defeated by the Prince of Bevern, and
by several regiments of the garrison of Prague, amounted
to near a hundred thousand men. They were strongly
entrenched on the banks of the Moldaw, to the north of
Prague, in a camp so fortified by every advantage of na∣ture,
and every contrivance of art, as to be deemed almo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
impregnable. The left wing of the Austrians, thus
situated, was guarded by the mountains of Ziscka, and
the right extended as far as Herboholi: Prince Charles of
Lorraine, and Mareschal Brown, who commanded them
seemed determined to maintain this advantageous post▪
but the King of Prussia overlooked all difficulties. Having
thrown several bridges over the Moldaw on the fifth of
May, he passed that river in the morning of the sixth▪
with thirty thousand men, leaving the rest of the army
under the command of the Prince of Anhault-Dessau▪
and being immediately joined by the troops unde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪
Mareschal Schwerin and the Prince of Bevern, resolved
to attack the enemy on the same day. In consequence of
this resolution, his army filed off on the left by Potscher∣nitz;
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
and at the same time Count Brown wheeled to the
right, to avoid being flanked. The Prussians continued
their march to Bichwitz, traversing several defiles and
morasses, which for a little time separated the infantry from
the rest of the army. The foot began the attack too
precipitately, and were at first repulsed, but they soon re∣covered
themselves. While the King of Prussia took the
enemy in flank, Mareschal Schwerin advanced to a
marshy ground, which suddenly stopping his army,
threatened to disconcert the whole plan of operation. In
this emergency, he immediately dismounted, and taking
the standard of the regiment in his hand, boldly entered
the morass, crying out, “Let all brave Prussians follow
me.” Inspired by the example of this great commander,
now eighty-two years of age, all the troops pressed for∣ward,
and though he was unfortunately killed by the first
fire, their ardour abated not till they had totally defeated
the enemy. Thus fell Mareschal Schwerin, loaded with
years and glory, an officer whose superior talents in the
military art had been displayed in a long course of faith∣ful
service. In the mean time, the Prussian infantry,
which had been separated in the march, forming them∣selves
afresh, renewed the attack on the enemy's right, and
entirely broke it, while their cavalry, after three charges,
obliged that of the Austrians to retire in great confusion,
the centre being at the same time totally routed. The
left wing of the Prussians then marched immediately to∣wards
Michely, and being there joined by the horse, re∣newed
their attack, while the enemy were retreating
hastily towards Saszawar. Mean while the troops on the
right of the Prussian army attacked the remains of the left
wing of the Austrians, and made themselves masters of
three batteries. But the behaviour of the infantry in the
last attack was so successful, as to leave little room for this
part of the cavalry to act. Prince Henry of Prussia, and
the Prince of Bevern, signalised themselves on this occa∣sion
in storming two batteries; Prince Ferdinand of
Brunswick took the left wing of the Austrians in flank,
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
while the King with his lest, and a body of cavalry, se∣cured
the passage of the Moldaw. In short, after a very
long and obstinate engagement, and many signal examples
of valour on both sides, the Austrians were forced to aban∣don
the field of battle, leaving behind sixty pieces of can∣non,
all their tents, baggage, military chest, and, in a
word, their whole camp. The weight of the battle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll
upon the right wing of the Austrians, the remains of
which, to the amount of ten or twelve thousand m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, fled
towards Beneschau, where they afterwards assembled under
M. Pretlach, general of horse. The in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antry retired to∣wards
Prague, and threw themselves into that city, with
their commanders, Prince Charles of Lorraine and Mare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣chat
Brown, but they were much harrassed in their re∣treat
by a detachment of the Prussians under Mareschal
Keith. The Prussians took, on this occasion, ten stand∣ards,
and upwards of four thousand prisoners, thirty of
whom were officers of rank. Their loss amounted to
about two thousand five hundred killed, and about three
thousand wounded. Among the former were General
d'Amstel, the Prince of Holstein-Book, the Colonels
Goltze and Manstein, and Lieutenant-Colonel Roke.
Among the latter, the Generals Wenter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield, De la
Mothe, F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uque, Hautcharmoy, Blankensee, and Pletten∣berg.
The number of the killed and wounded on the side
of the Austrians was much greater. Among these last was
Mareschal Brown, who received a wound, which, from
the chagrin he suffered, rather than from its own nature,
proved mortal. The day after the battle, Colonel Meye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was detached with a battalion of Prussian Pandours, and
four hundred hussars, to destroy a very considerable and
valuable magazine of the Austrians at Pilsen, and this set∣vice
he performed. He also completed the destruction of
several others of less importance, by the loss of which,
however, all possibility of subsistence was out off from
any succours the Austrians might have expected from the
Empire.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="133"/>
§ XXXVI. The Prussians, following their blow, im∣mediately
invested Prague on both sides of the river, the
King commanding on one side, and Mareschal Keith on
the other. In four days the whole city was surrounded
with lines and entrenchments, by which all communica∣tion
from without was entirely cut off: Prince Charles
of Lorraine and Mareschal Brown, the two Princes of
Saxony, the Prince of Modena, the Duke d'Aremberg,
Count Lacy, and several other persons of great distinction
were shut up within the walls, together with above twenty
thousand of the Austrian army, who had taken refuge in
Prague after their defeat. Every thing continued quiet on
both sides, scarce a cannon shot being sired by either for
some time after this blockade was formed; and in the mean
while the Prussians made themselves masters of Czisca∣berg,
an eminence which commands the town, where
the Austrians had a strong redoubt, continuing likewise to
strengthen their works. Already they had made a sally,
and taken some other ineffectual steps to recover this post,
but a more decisive stroke was necessary. Accordingly, a
design was formed of attacking the Prussian army in the
night with a body of twelve thousand men, to be sustained
by all the grenadiers, volunteers, Pandours, and Hunga∣rian
infantry. In case an impression could be made on
the King's lines, it was intended to open a way, sword
in hand, through the camp of the befiegers, and to ease
Prague of the multitude of forces locked up useless within
the walls, serving only to consume the provisions of the
garrison, and hasten the surrender of the place. Happily
a deserter gave the Prince of Prussia intelligence of the
enemy's design about eleven o'clock at night. Proper
measures were immediately taken for their reception, and
in less than a quarter of an hour the whole army was under
arms. This design was conducted with so much silence,
that though the Prussians were warned of it they could
discover nothing before the enemy had charged their ad∣vanced
posts. The attack was begun on the side of the
little town, against Mareschal Keith's camp, and the left
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
wing of the Prussian army encamped on the Moidaw.
From hence it is probable the Austrians proposed not only
to destroy the batteries that were raising, but to attack the
bridges of communication which the Prussians threw over
the Moldaw, at about a quarter of a German mile above
and below Prague, at Branick and Bodbaba. The greatest
alarm began about two o'clock, when the enemy hoped to
have come silently and unexpectedly upon the miners,
but they had left work about a quarter of an hour before.
At the report of the first piece which they fired, the piq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t
of the third battalion of Prussian guards, to the number
of an hundred men, who marched out of the camp to su∣slain
the body which covered the works, was thrown into
some confusion, from the darkness of the night, which
prevented their distinguishing the Austrian troops from
their own. Lieutenant Jork, detached with two pla∣toons
to reconnoitre the enemy, attempting to discover
their disposition by kindling a fire, Captain Rodig, by
the light of this fire, perceiving the enemy's situation,
immediately formed the design of falling upon them in
flank, and gave orders to his men to fire in platoons.
which they performed, mutually repeating the signal given
by their commander. The enemy fled with the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter
precipitation, as they were ignorant of the weakness of
the piquet, and as the shouting of the Prussian soldiers
made them mistake it for a numerous body, many of
them deserted, many took shelter in Prague, and many
more were driven into the river and drowned. At the
same time this attack began, a regiment of horse-grenadiers
fell upon a redoubt which the Prussians had thrown up,
supported by the Hungarian infantry: they returned
three times to the assault, and were as often beat back by
the Prussians, whom they found it impossible to dislodge;
though Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick's battalion, which
guarded this post, suffered extremely. During this attack
the enemy kept an incessant fire with their musque<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry
upon she whole front of the Prussians, from the convent of
St. Margaret to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he river. At three in the morning the
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
Prussians quitted their camp to engage the enemy. The
battalion of Parmewitz attacked a building called the Red-house,
situated at the bottom of a declivity before Wel∣lastowitz.
The Pandours, who had taken possession of
this house, fired upon them incess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntly from all the doors
and windows until they were dislodged; and the Prussian
battalions were obliged to sustain the fire both of cannon
and musquetry for above two hours, when the enemy
retired to the city, except the Pandours, who again took
possession of the Red-house, which the Prussians were
forced to abandon, because the artillery of Prague kept a
continual fire upon it from the moment it, was known to
be in their hands. The Austrians left▪ behind them many
dead and wounded, besides deserters, and the Prussians,
notwithstanding the loss of several officers and private
men, made some prisoners. Prince Ferdinand, the King
of Prussia's youngest brother, had a horse killed under
him, and was slightly wounded in the face.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The Prussian works being complexed,
and heavy artillery arrived, four batteries erected on the
banks of the Mol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>law, began to play with great fury.
Near three hundred bombs, besides an infinity of ignited
balls, were thrown into the city in the space of twenty-four
hours. The scene was lamentable, houses, men, and
horses wrapped in flames, and reduced to ashes. The
confusion within, together with the want of proper in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lery
and ammunition, obliged the Austrians to cause
firing, and furnished his Prussian Majesty with all the op∣portunity
he could wish of pouning destruction upon this
unfortunate city. The horrours of war seemed to have
extinguished the principles of humanity. No regard was
paid to the distress of the inhabitants, the Austrians ob∣stinately
maintained possession, and the Prussians practised
every stratagem, every barbarous refinement that consti∣tutes
the military art to oblige them no capitulate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. After
the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lagration had lasted three days, and confirmed a
prodigious number of buildings, the principal inhabitants,
burghers, and clergy, perceiving their city on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
being reduce! to a heap of rubbish, besought the com∣mander,
in a body, to hearken to terms, but he was deaf
to the voice of pity, and, instead of being moved with
their supplications, drove out twelve thousand persons, the
least useful in defending the city. These, by order of his
Prussian Majesty, were again forced-back, which soon
produced so great a scarcity of provision within the
walls, that the Austrians were reduced to the necessity of
eating horse-flesh, forty horses being daily distributed to
the troops, and the same food sold at four-pence a pound
to the inhabitants. However, as there still remained great
abundance of corn, they were far from being brought to
the last extremity. Two vigorous and well-conducted
sallies were made, but they proved unsuccessful. The
only advantage resulting from them was the perpetual
alarm in which they kept the Prussian camp, and the
vigilance required to guard against the attacks of a nu∣merous,
resolute, and desperate garrison.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. Whatever difficulties might have attended
the conquest of Prague, certain it is that the affairs of
the Empress-Queen were in the most critical and despe∣rate
situation. Her grand army dispersed in parties, and
flying for subsistence in small corps; their princes and
commanders cooped up in Prague; that capital in immi∣nent
danger of being taken, the flourishing kingdom of
Bohemia ready to fall into the hands of the conqueror, a
considerable army on the point of surrendering prisoners of
war; all the Queen's hereditary dominions open and ex∣posed,
the whole fertile tract of country from Egra to the
Moldaw in actual possession of the Prussians, the distance
to the archduchy of Austria not very considerable, and
secured only by the Danube; Vienna under the utmost
apprehensions of a siege, and the Imperial family ready
to take refuge in Hungary; the Prussian <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces deemed
invincible, and the sanguine friends of that monarch al∣ready
sharing with him, in imagination, the spoils of the
ancient and illustrious house of Austria. Such was the
aspect of affairs, and such the difficulties to be combated,
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
when Leopold, Count Daun, was appointed the com∣mand
of the Austrian forces, to stern the torrent of dis∣grace,
and turn the fortune of the war. This general,
tutored by long experience under the best officers of Eu∣rope,
and the particular favourite of the great Kevenhuller,
was now, for the first time, raised to act in chief, at the
head of an army, on which depended the fate of Austria
and the empire. Born of a noble family, he relied solely
upon his own merit, without sollici<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing court favour; he
aspired after the highest preferment, and succeeded by mere
dint of superior worth. His progress from the station of a
subaltern was slow and silent: his promotion to the chief
command was received with universal esteem and applause
Cautious, steady, penetrating, and fagacio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, he was op∣posed
as another Fabius to the modern Hannibal, to check
the fire and vigour of that monarch by prudent fore sight
and wary circumspection. Arriving at Boemisch h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od,
within a few miles of Prague, the day after the late defeat,
he halted to collect the fugitive corps and broken remains
of the Austrian army, and soon drew together a force so
considerable as to attract the notice of his Prussian Ma∣jesty,
who detached the Prince of Bovern, with twenty
battalions and thirty squadrous, to attack him before num∣bers
should render him formidable. Daun was too pru∣dent
to give battle with dispirited troops to an army flushed
with victory. He retired on the first advice that the
Prussians were advancing, and took post at Ko<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, where
he entrenched himself strongly, opened the way for the
daily supply of recruits sent to his army, and inspired the
garrison of Prague with fresh courage, inexpectation of
being soon relieved. Here he kept close within his camp,
divided the Prussian force by obliging the King to em∣ploy
near half his army in watching his designs, weakened
his efforts against Prague, harrassed the enemy by eut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
off their convoys, and restored by degrees, the languishing
and almost desponding spirits of his troops. Perfectly ac∣quainted
with the and our and discipline of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>russiam
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the enterprising and impetu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> disposition of
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
that monarch, and sensible that his situation would prove
irksome and embarrassing to the enemy, he improved it to
the best advantage, seemed to foresee all the consequences,
and directed every me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sure to produce them. Thus he
retarded the enemy's operations, and assiduously avoided
precipitating an action until the Prussian vigour should
be exhausted, their strength impaired by losses and deser∣tion,
the first fire and ardour of their genius extinguished by
continual fatigue and incessant alarms, and until the im∣pression
made on his own men, by the late defeat, should,
in some degree, be effaced. The event justified Daun's
conduct. His army grew every day more numerous,
while his Prussian Majesty began to express the utmost
impatience at the length of the siege. When that mo∣narch
first invested Prague, it was on the presumption that
the numerous forces within the walls would, by consum∣ing
all the provision, oblige it to surrender in a few
days, but perceiving that the Austrians had still a consi∣derable
quantity of corn, that Court Daun's army was
daily increasing, and would soon be powerful enough not
only to cope with the detachment under the Prince of
Bevern, but in a condition to raise the siege, he determined
to give the Count battle with one part of his army, while
he kept Prague blocked up with the other. The Au∣strians,
amounting now to sixty thousand men, were deeply
entrenched, and defended by a numerous train of artillery,
placed on redoubts and batteries erected on the most ad∣vantageous
posts. Every accessible part of the camp was
fortified with lines and heavy pieces of battering cannon,
and the foot of the hills secured by difficult de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iles. Yet,
strong as this situation might appear, formidable as the
Austrian forces certainly were, his Prussian Majesty under∣took
to dislodge them with a body of horse and foot not
exceeding thirty-two thousand men.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. On the thirteenth day of June, the
King of Prussia quitted the camp before Prague,
escorted by a few battalions and squadrons, with
which he joined the Prince of Bevern at Milkowitz.
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
Mareschal Keith, it is said, strenuously opposed this mea∣sure,
and advised either raising the siege entirely, and at∣tacking
the Austrians with the united forces of Prussia, or
postponing the attack on the camp at Kolin until his Ma∣jesty
should either gain possession of the city, or some at∣temps
should be made to oblige him to quit his posts.
From either measure an advantage would have resulted.
With his whole army he might probably have defeated
Count Daun, or at least have obliged him to retreat. Had
he continued within his lines at Prague, the Austrian
general could not have constrained him to raise the siege
without losing his own advantageous situation, and giving
battle upon terms nearly equal. But the King, elated
with success, impetuous in his valour, and confident of
the superiority of his own troops in point of discipline,
thought all resistance must sink under the weight of his
victorious arm, and yield to that courage which had al∣ready
surmounted such difficulties, disregarded the mares∣chal's
sage counsel, and marched up to the attack un∣daunted,
and even assured of success. By the eighteenth
the two armies were in sight, and his Majesty found that
Count Daun had not only fortified his camp with all the
heavy cannon of Olmutz, but was strongly re-enforced
with troops from Moravia and Austria, which had joined
him after the King's departure from Prague. He found
the Austrians drawn up in three lines upon the high
grounds between Gentlitz and St. John the Baptist. Dif∣ficult
as it was to approach their situation, the Prussian
infantry marched up with firmness, while shot was poured
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike hail from the enemy's batteries, and began the attack
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout three in the afternoon. They drove the Austrians
with irresistible intrepidity from two eminences secured
with heavy cannon, and two villages defended by several
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>attalions; but, in attacking the third eminence, were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anked by the Austrian cavalry, by grape-shot, poured
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the batteries; and, after a violent con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lict, and pro∣ligious

<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
ardour to the charge, but were a second time repulsed
Sazen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>imes successively did Prince Ferdinand renew the
attack, performing every duty of a great general and
valiant soldier, though always with the same fortune. The
inferiority of the Prussian infantry, the disadvantages of

entrenchments, numbers, and obstinacy, joined to the

the acknowledged errours of his Prussian Majesty were in
some measure atoned by the candour with which he owned
his mistake, both in a letter to the Earl Mareschal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“The Imperial grenadiers, says he, are an admirable corps: one hun∣dred companies defended a rising ground, which my hell in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntry could not carry.

in conversation with several of his general officers. Most
people, indeed, imagined the King highly blameable for
checking the ardour of his troops, to stop and lay siege to
Prague. They thought he should have pursued his con∣quests,
over-run Austria, Moravia, and all the hereditary
dominions, from which alone the Empress-Queen could
draw speedy succours. A body of twenty or thirty thou∣sand
men would have blocked up Prague, while the remain∣der
of the Prussian forces might have obliged the Imperial
family to retire from Vienna, and effectually prevented
Count Daun from assembling another army. It was
universally expected he would have bent his march straight
to this capital, but he dreaded leaving the numerous army
in Prague behind, and it was of great importance to com∣plete
the conquest of Bohemia. The Prince of Prussia
marched all night with his corps to Nimburg, where he
joined the Prince of Bevern, and Mareschal Keith re∣treated
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
next day. Count Brown, having died before, of the
wounds he received on the sixth of May, Prince Charles
of Lorraine failled out with a large body of the Austrians,
and attacked the rear of the Prussians <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but did no further
mischief than killing about two hundred of their men.
The siege of Prague being thus raised, the imprisoned
Austrians received their deliverer, Count Daun, with in∣expressible
joy, and their united forces became greatly su∣perior
to those of the King of Prussia, who was in a short
time obliged to evacuate Bohemia, and take refuge in
Saxony. The Austrians harrassed him as much as possible
in his retreat; but their armies, though superior in num∣bers,
were not in a condition, from their late sufferings,
to make any decisive attempt upon him, as the frontiers of
Saxony abound with situations easily defended.</P>
<P>§ XLI. Having thus described the progress▪ of the
Prussians in Bohemia, we must cast our eyes on the trans∣actions
which distinguished the campaign in Westpha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.
To guard against the storm which menaced Hanover it
particular, orders were transmitted thither to recruit the
troops that had been sent back from England, to augment
each company, to remount the cavalry with the utmost
expedition; not to suffer any horses to be conveyed out of
the electorate; to furnish the magazines in that country
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h all things necessary for fifty thousand men. Of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
twenty-six thousand were to be Hanoverians, and, in
consequences of engagements entered into for that perpose,
twelve thousand Hessians, six thousand Brunswicke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
two thousand Saxe-Gothans, and a thousand Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en∣burgh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,
to be joined by a considerable body of Prussians,
the whole commanded by his royal highness the Duke of
Cumberland. The King of England having published a
manifest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Hanover, specifying his motives for
taking the field in Westphalia, the troops of the confede∣rated
states that were to compose the allied a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any, under
the name of an army of observation, began to assemble
with all possible diligence near Biclefeld<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. That her the
generals appointed to command the several dirisions
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epaired, to settle the plan of operations with their com∣mander,
the Duke of Cumberland, who, having lest
London on the ninth of April, arrived on the sixteenth
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Hanover, and from thence repaired to the army, which,
having been joined by three Prussian regiments that re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired
from Wesel, consisted of thirty-seven battalions and
thirty-four squadrons. Of these six battalions and six
squadrons were posted at Bielefeldt, under the command
of Lieutenant-General Baron de Sporcken; six battalions,
under Lieutenant-General de Block, at Hervorden; six
battalions and four squadrons, under Major-General
Ledebour, between Hervorden and Minden; seven batta∣lions
and ten squadrons, under Lieutenant-General d'Oberg
in the neighbourhood of Hamelen; and sive battalions
and four-squadrons, under Major-General de Hauss, near
Nienburgh. The head-quarters of his Royal Highness
were at Bielefeldt.</P>
<P>§ XLII. In the mean time, the French on the Lower-Rhine
continued filing off incessantly. The siege of
Gueldres was converted into a blockade, occasioned by
the difficulties the enemy found in raising batteries; and
a party of Hanoverians having passed the Weser, as well
to ravage the country of Paderbourn as to reconnoitre the
French, carried off several waggons loaded with wheat and
oats, destined for the territories of the Elector of Cologn.
On the other hand, Colonel Fischer having had an en∣gagement
with a small body of Hanoverians, in the country
of Teklenburgh, routed them, and made some prisoners.
After several other petty skirmishes between the French
and the Hanoverians, the Duke of Cumberland altered
the position of his camp, by placing it between Bieleseldt
and Hervorden, in hopes of frustrating the design of the
enemy; who, declining to attack him on the side of Brac∣wede,
after having reconnoitred his situation several days,
made a motion on their left, as if they meant to get be∣tween
him and the Weser. This step was no sooner taken,
than, on the thirteenth of June in the afternoon, having
received advice that the enemy had caused a large body of
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
troops, followed by a second, to march on his right t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Burghotte, he ordered his army to march that evenin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
towards Hervorden; and at the same time Major-Genera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hardenberg marched with four battalions of grenadiers
and a regiment of horse, to re-enforce that post. Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Schulenberg covered the left of the march with a battalion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of grenadiers, a regiment of horse, and the light troops of
Buckeburg. The whole army marched in two columns
The right, composed of horse, and followed by two bat∣talions,
to cover their passage through the enclosures and
defiles, passed by the right of Bielefeldt; and the left,
consisting of infantry, marched by the left of the same
town. The van-guard of the French army attacked the
rear-guard of the allies, commanded by Major-General
Einfiedel, very briskly, and at first put them into some
confusion, but they immediately recovered themselves.
This was in the beginning of the night. At break of day
the enemy's re-enforcements returned to the charge, but
were again repulsed, nor could they once break through
Lieutenant Colonel Alfeldt's Hanoverian guards, which
closed the army's march with a detachment of regular
troops, and a new-raised corps of hunters.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. The allies encamped at Cofeldt the four∣teenth,
and remained there all the next day, when the
enemy's detachments advanced to the gates of Hervorden,
and made a feint as if they would attack the town, after
having summoned it to surrender; but they retired with∣out
attempting any thing further; and, in the mean time,
the troops that were posted at Hervorden, and formed the
rear-guard, passed the Weser on the side of Remen, with∣out
any molestation, and encamped at Holtzuysen. A
body of troops which had been left at Bieleseldt, to cover
the Duke's retreat, after some skirmishes with the French,
rejoined the army in the neighbourhood of Herfort; and
a few days after his Royal Highness drew near his bridges
on the Weser, and sent over his artillery, baggage, and
ammunition. At the same time some detachments passed
the river on the right, between Minden and Oldendorp, and
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
remarked out a new camp advantageously situated, having
the Weser in front, and the right and left covered with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eminences and marshes. There the army under his royal
highness re-assembled, and the French fixed their head∣quarters
at Bielefeldt, which the Hanoverins had quitted,
seaving in it only part of a magazine, which had been set
on fire. By this time the French were in such warn of
sorage, that M. d'Etrées himself, the princes of the blood,
and all the officers without exception, were obliged to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd
back part of their horses. However, on the tenth of June
their whole army, consisting of seventy battaliens and forty
squadrons, with fifty-two pieces of cannon, besides a body
of cavalry left at Ruremonde for the conveniency of sorage
was put in motion. In spite of almost impossible forests,
famine, and every other obstacle that could be thrown in
their way by a vigilant and exprienced general, they at
length surmounted all difficulties, and advanced into a
country abounding with plenty, and unused to the ravages
of war. It was imagined that the passage of the Weser,
which defends Hanover from foreign attacks, would have
been vigorously opposed by the army of the allies: but
whether, in the present situation of affairs, it was thought
adviseable to act only upon the defensive, and not to begin
the attack in a country that was not concerned as a prin∣cipal
in the war, or the Duke of Cumberland sound him∣self
too weak to make head against the enemy, is a question
we shall not pretend to determine. However that may
have been, the whole French army passed the Weser on
the tenth an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eleventh of July, without the loss of a man.
The manner of effecting this passage is thus related:—Mareschal
d'Etrées being informed that his magazince of
provisions were well furnished, his ovens established, and
the artillery and pontoons arrived at the destined places,
ordered Lieutenant-General Broglio, wish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en battalions,
twelve squadrons, and ten pieces of cannon, to march to
Engheren; Lieutenant-General M. de Chevert, with sixteen
battalions, three brig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>des of carabinears, the royal hunters,
and six hundred hussars, to march to Hervorden, and
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
Lieutenant-General Marquis d'Armentieres, with twelve
battalions and ten squadrons, to march to Ulrickhausen.
All these troops being arrived in their camp on the fourth
of July, halted the fifth. On the sixth, twenty-two bat∣talions,
and thirty-two squadrons, under the command o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Duke of Orleans, who was now arrived at the army
marched to Ulrickhausen, from whence M. d'Armentiere
had set out early in the morning, with the troops under hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
command, and by hasty marches got on the seventh, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

were built, the cannon planted, and the entrenchments<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the head of the bridges completed in the night between th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

possession of Lier, marched on the right of the Ems to

which at first seemed determined to make a defence, but
the inhabitants were not agreed upon the methods to be
taken for that purpose. They, therefore, met to delibe∣rate,
but in the mean time, their gates being shut, M.
d'Auvel caused some cannon to be brought to beat them
down; and the garrison, composed of four hundred
Prussians, not being strong enough to defend the town,
the soldiers mutinied against their officers, whereupon a
capitulation was agreed on, and the gates were opened
to the French commander, who made his troops enter
with a great deal of order, assured the magistrates that
care should be taken to make them observe a good disci∣pline,
and published two ordinances, one for the security
of the religion and commerce of the city, and the other
for prohibiting the exportation of corn and forage out of
that principality. The inhabitants were, however, obliged
to take an oath of allegiance to the French King.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. On Sunday the twenty-fourth of July, the
French, after having laid a part of the electorate of Han∣over
under contribution, marched in three columns, with
their artillery, towards the village of Latford, when
Major-General Fustenberg, who commanded the outports
in the village, sent an officer to inform the Duke of
Cumberland of their approach. His Royal Highness im∣mediately
re-enforced those posts with a body of troops,
under the command of Lieutenant-General Sporcken;
but finding it impossible to support the village, as it was
commanded by the heights opposite to it, which were
possessed by the enemy, and being sensible that it would be
always in his power to retake it, from its situation in a
bottom between two hills, he withdrew his post from Lat∣ford.
The French then made two attacks, one at the point
of the wood, and the other higher up in the same wood,
opposite to the grenadiers commanded by Major-General
Hardenberg, but they failed in both; and though the sire
of their artillery was very hot, they were obliged to re∣tire.
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
The French army encamping on the heights oppo∣site
to the Duke of Cumberland's posts, the intelligence
received, that M. d'Etrées had assembled all his troops, and
was furnished with a very considerable train of artillery,
lest his Royal Highness no room to doubt of his intend∣ing
to attack him. He, therefore, resolved to change
his camp for a more advantageous situation, by drawing
up his army on the eminence between the Weser and the
woods, leaving the Hamelen river on his right, the village
of Hastenbeck in his front, and his left close to the wood,
at the point of which his Royal Highness had a battery of
twelve pounders and haubitzers. There was a hollow
way from the left of the villages to the battery, and a mo∣rass
on the other side of Hastenbeck to his right Major-General
Schulenberg, with the hunters, and two battalions
of grenadiers, was posted in the corner of the wood upon
the left of the battery; his Royal Highness ordered the
village of Hastenbeck to be cleared to his front, to pre∣vent
its being in the power of the enemy to keep pos∣session
of it, and the ways by which the allies had a com∣munication
with that village during their encampment
to be rendered impassable. In the evening he withdrew
all his out-posts, and in this position the army lay upon
their arms all night. On the twenty-fifth in the morn∣ing
the French army marched forwards in columns, and
began to cannonade the allies very severely, marching
and counter-marching continually, and seeming to intend
three attacks, on the right, the left, and the centre.
In the evening their artillery appeared much superior
to that of the allies. The army was again ordered to
lie all night on their arms; his Royal Highness caused
a battery at the end of the wood to be repaired, Count
Schulenberg to be re-enforced with a battalion of gre∣nadiers,
and two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield pieces of cannon, and that
battery to be also supported by four more battalions
of grenadiers, under the command of Major-General
Hardenberg. He likewise caused a battery to be erected
of twelve and six pounders, behind the village of Hasten∣beck,
and took all the precautions he could think of
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
to give the enemy a warm reception. As soon as it was
day-light he mounted on horse-back to reconnoitre the
position of the enemy, whom he found in the same situa∣tion
as the day before. At a little after five a very smart
cannonading began against the battery behind the village,
which was supported by the Hessian infantry and cavalry,
who stood a most severe fire with surprising steadiness and
resolution. Between seven and eight the firing of small
arms began on the left of the allies, when his Royal High∣ness
ordered Major-General Behr, with three battalions
of Brunswick, to sustain the grenadiers in the wood, if
their assistance should be wanted. The cannonading con∣tinued
about six hours, during which the troops that were
exposed to it never once abated of their firmness. The
fire of the small arms on the left increasing, and the
French seeming to gain ground, his Royal Highness de∣tached
the Colonels Darkenhausen and Bredenbach, with
three Hanoverian battalions and six squadrons, round the
wood by Afferde, who, towards the close of the day, drove
several squadrons of the enemy back to their army, with∣out
giving them any opportunity to charge. At length
the grenadiers in the wood, apprehensive of being sur∣rounded,
from the great numbers of the enemy that ap∣peared
there, and were marching round on that side,
though they repulsed every thing that appeared in their
front, thought it adviseable to retire nearer the le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the
army, a motion which gave the enemy an opportunity of
possessing themselves of that battery without opposition.
Here the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick distinguished
himself at the head of a battalion of Wolsenbuttel guards,
and another of Hanoverians, who attacked and repulsed,
with their bayonets, a superior force of the enemy, and
retook the battery. But the French being in possession of
an eminence which commanded and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anked both the
lines of the infantry and the battery of the allies, and
where they were able to support their attack under the
cover of a hill, his Royal Highness, considering the supe∣rior
numbers of the enemy, near double to his, and the
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
impossibility of dislodging them from their post, without
exposing his own troops too much, ordered a retreat; in
consequence of which his army retired, first to Hamelen,
where he lest a garrison, then to Nienburg, and after∣wards
to Hoya; in the neighbourhood of which town,
after sending away all the magazines, sick, and wounded,
he encamped, in order to cover Bremen and Verden, and
to preserve a communication with Stade, to which place
the archives, and most valuable effects of Hanover had
been removed. In this engagement, Colonel Breden∣bach
attacked four brigades very strongly posted, with a
battery of fourteen pieces of cannon, repulsed, and drove
them down a precipice, and took all their artillery and
ammunition; but preferring the care of his wounded to
the glory of carrying away the cannon, he brought off
only six, nailing up and destroying the rest. The loss of
the allies, in all these skirmishes, which lasted three days,
was three hundred and twenty-seven men killed, nine
hundred and seven wounded, and two hundred and
twenty missing, or taken prisoners; whilst that of the
French, according to their own accounts, amounted to
fifteen hundred men.</P>
<P>§ XLV. The French, being lest masters of the field,
soon reduced Hamelen, which was far from being well
fortified, obliged the garrison to capitulate, and took out
of the town sixty brass cannon, several mortars, forty
ovens, part of the equipage of the Duke's army, and
large quantities of provisions and ammunition, which
they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in it, together with a great many sick and
wounded, who, not being included in the capitulation,
were made prisoners of war. Whether the court of France
had any reason to find fault with the conduct of the Mares∣chal
d'Etrées, or whether its monarch was blindly guided
by the councils of his favourite, the Marquise de Pompa∣dour,
who, desirous to testify her gratitude to the man
who had been one of the chief instruments of her high
promotion, was glad of an opportunity to retrieve his
shattered fortunes, and, at the same time, to add to her
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
own already immense treasure, we shall not pretend to
determine; though the event seems plainly to speak the
last. Even at the time no comparison was made between
the military skill of the Mareschal d'Etrées, and that of
the Duke de Richelieu; but, however that may have
been, this last, who, if he had not shone in the character
of a soldier, excelled all, or at least most of his cotempo∣raries
in the more refined arts of a courtier, was, just be∣fore
the battle we have been speaking of, appointed to
supersede the former in the command of the French army
in Lower Saxony, where he arrived on the sixth of Au∣gust,
with the title of mareschal of France; and M.
d'Etrees immediately resigned the command.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. Immediately after the battle of Hastenbeck,
the French sent a detachment of four thousand men to lay
under contribution the countries of Hanover and Bruns∣wick-Wolfenbuttel,
as well as the duchies of Bremen
and Verden; and two days after the arrival of this new
commander, the Duke de Chevreuse was detached with
two thousand men to take possession of Hanover itself,
with the title of governor of that city. He accordingly
marched thither; and upon his arrival the Hanoverian
garrison was disarmed, and left at liberty to retire where
they pleased. About the same time M. de Contades,
with a detachment from the French army, was sent to
make himself master of the territories of Hesse-Cassel,
where he found no opposition. He was met at Warberg
by that prince's master of the horse, who declared, that
they were ready to furnish the French army with all the
succours the country could afford; and accordingly the
magistrates of Cassel presented him with the keys as soon
as he entered their city. Gottingen was ordered by M.
d'Armentieres to prepare for him within a limited time,
upon pain of military execution, four thousand pounds of
white bread, two thousand bushels of oats, a greater
quantity than could be found in the whole country, an
hundred loads of hay, and other provisions.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152"/>
§ XLVII. The Duke of Cumberland remained en∣camped
in the neighbourhood of Hoya till the twenty-fourth
of August, when, upon advice that the enemy had
laid two bridges over the Aller in the night, and had
passed that river with a large body of troops, he ordered his
army to march, to secure the important post and passage of
Rotenburg, lest they should attempt to march round on
his left. He encamped that night at Hausen, having de∣tached
Lieutenant-General Oberg, with eight battalions
and six squadrons, to Ottersberg, to which place he
marched next day, and encamped behind the Wummer,
in a very strong situation, between Ottersberg and Roten∣burg.
the French took possession of Verden on the
twenty-sixty of August, and one of their detachments
went on the twenty-ninth to Bremen, where the gates
were immediately opened to them. The Duke of Cum∣berland,
now closely pressed on all sides, and in danger of
having his communication with Stade cut off, which
the enemy was endeavouring to effect, by siesing upon all
the posts round him, found it necessary to decamp again;
to abandon Rotenburg, of which the French immediately
took possession; to retreat to Selsingen, where his head-quarters
were, on the first of September; and from thence,
on the third of the same month, to retire under the cannon
of Stade. Here it was imagined that his army would
have been able to maintain their ground between the Aller
and the Elbe, till the severity of the season should put an
end to the campaign. Accordingly his Royal Highness,
upon his taking this position, sent a detachment of his
forces to Buck-Schantz, with some artillery, and orders
to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end that place to the utmost: but as it could not
possibly have held out many days, and as the French
who now hemmed him in on all sides, by making them∣selves
masters of a little fort at the mouth of the river
Zwinga, would have cut off his communication with the
Elbe, so that four Englishmen of war then in that river
could have been of no service to him, he was forced to
accept of a mediation offered by the King of Denmark,
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
by his minister the Count de Lynar, and to sign the famous
convention of Closter-Seven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This remarkable capitulation, which we shall give here at full length, on account of the disputes that arose shortly after concerning what the French called an infraction of it, was to the following effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>“HIS Majesty the King of Denmark, touched with the distresses of the countries of Bremen and Verden, to which he has always granted his special protection; and being desirous, by preventing those countries from being any longer the theatre of war, to spare also the effusion of blood in the armies which are ready to dispute the possession thereof, hath employed his media∣tion by the ministry of the Count de Lynar. His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, general of the army of the allies, on the one part, and his Ex∣cellency the Mareschal Duke de Richelieu, general of the King of France's forces in Germany, on the other, have, in consideration of the intervention of his Danish Majesty, respectively engaged their word of honour to the Count de Lynar, to abide by the convention hereafter stipulated; and he, the Count de Lynar, correspondently to the magnanimity of the King his master's intention, obliges himself to procure the guarantee mentioned in the present convention; so that it shall be sent to him, with his full powers, which there was no time to make out, in the circumstances which hurried his departure.</P>
<P>Article I. Hostilities shall cease on both sides within twenty-four hours, or sooner, if possible. Orders for this purpose shall be immediately sent to the detached corps.</P>
<P>II. The auxiliary troops of the army of the Duke of Cumberland, namely, those of Hesse, Brunswick, Saxe-Gotha, and even those of the Count de la Lippe-Buckbourg, shall be sent home: and as it is necessary to settle particu∣larly their march to their respective countries, a general officer of each na∣tion shall be sent from the army of the allies, with whom shall be settled the route of those troops, the divisions they shall march in, their subsistence on their march, and their passports to be granted them by his Excellency the Duke de Richelieu to go to their own countries, where they shall be placed and distributed as shall be agreed upon between the court of France and their respective sovereigns.</P>
<P>III. His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland obliges himself to pass the Elbe, with such part of his army as he shall not be able to place in the city of Stade: That the part of his forces which shall enter into garrison in the said city, and which it is supposed may amount to between four and six thou∣sand men, shall remain there under the guarantee of his Majesty the King of Denmark, without committing any act of hostility: nor, on the other hand, shall they be exposed to any from the French troops. In consequence thereof, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommissaries, named on each side, shall agree upon the limits to be fixed
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
round that place, for the conveniency of the garrison; which limits shall not extend beyond half a league or a league from the place, according to the nature of the ground or circumstances, which shall be fairly settled by the commissaries. The rest of the Hanoverian army shall go and take quarters in the country beyond the Elbe; and, to facilitate the march of those troops, his Excellency the Duke de Richelieu shall concert with a general officer sent from the Hanoverian army the route they shall take; obliging himself to give the necessary passports and security for the free passage of them and their baggage to the places of their destination; his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland reserving to himself the liberty of negociating between the two courts, for an extension of those quarters. As to the French troops, they shall remain in the rest of the duchies of Bremen and Verden, till the definitive reconciliation of the two sovereigns.</P>
<P>IV. As the aforesaid articles are to be executed as soon as possible, the Hanoverian army, and the corps which are detached from it, particularly that which is at Buck-Schantz, and the neighbourhood, shall retire under Stade in the space of eight-and-forty hours. The French army shall not pass the river Oste, in the duchy of Bremen, till the limits be regulated. It shall, besides, keep all the posts and countries of which it is in possession; and, not to retard the regulation of the limits between the armies, commissaries shall be nominated and sent on the 10th instant to Bremenworden, by his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, and his Excellency the Mareschal Duke de Richelieu, to regulate, as well the limits to be assigned to the French army, as those that are to be observed by the garrison at Stade, according to Art. III.</P>
<P>V. All the aforesaid articles shall be faithfully executed, according to their form and tenor, and under the faith of his Majesty the King of Denmak's guarantee, which the Count de Lynar, his minister, engages to procure.</P>

<Q>SEPARATE ARTICLES.</Q>
<P>UPON the representation made by the Count de Lynar, with a view to explain some dispositions made by the present convention, the following ar∣ticles have been added:</P>
<P>I. It is the intention of his Excellency the Mareschal Duke de Richelieu, that the allied troops of his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland shall be sent back to their respective countries, according to the form mentioned in the second article; and that as to their separation and distribution in the country, it shall be regulated between the courts, those troops not being considered as prisoners of war.</P>
<P>II. It having been represented that the country of Lunenberg cannot accom∣modate more than fifteen battalions and six squadrons, and that the city of Stade cannot absolutely contain the garrison of six thousand men allotted to it, his Excellency the Mareschal Duke de Richelieu, being pressed by M. de Lynar, who supported this representation by the guarantee of his Danish Majesty, gives his consent, and his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumber∣land engages to cause fifteen battalions and six squadrons to pass the Elbe; and the whole body of hunters, and the remaining ten battalions and twen∣ty-eight squadrons shall be placed in the town of Stade, and the places
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
nearest to it that are within the line, which shall be marked by posts from the mouth of the Liche in the Elbe, to the mouth of the Elmerbeck in the river Oste; provided always that the said ten battalions and twenty-eight squadrons shall be quartered there as they are at the time of signing this con∣vention, and shall not be recruited under any pretext, or augmented in any case; and this clause is particularly guaranteed by the Count de Lynar in the name of his Danish Majesty.</P>
<P>III. Upon the representation of his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumber∣land, that the army and the detached corps cannot both retire under Stade in eight-and-forty hours, agreeable to the convention, his Excellency the Mareschal Duke de Richlieu hath signified, that he will grant them proper time, provided the corps encamped at Buck-Schantz, as well as the army encamped at Bremen-worden, begin their march to retire in four-and-twenty hours after signing the convention. The time necessary for other arrangements, and the execution of the articles concerning the respective limits, shall be settled between Lieutenant-General Sporcken, and the Mar∣quis de Villemar, first lieutenant general of the King's army.</P>

to the French army, were directed to attack the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ussian territories. Mareschal Richelieu himself arrived
Brunswick on the fifteenth of September; and having,
a few days after, assembled an hundred and ten batta∣lions,
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
and an hundred and fifty squadrons, with an hundred
pieces of cannon, near Wolfenbuttel, he entered the King
of Prussia's dominions with his army on the 27th, 28th,
and 29th of the same month, in three columns, which pe∣netrated
into Halberstadt and Brandenburg, plundering
the towns, exacting contributions, and committing many
enormities, at which their general is said to have connived.
In the mean time, the Duke of Cumberland returned to
England, where he arrived on the 11th of October, and
shortly after resigned all his military commands.</P>
<P>§ II. Had the allied army, after the battle of Hastenbeck,
marched directly to the Leine, as it might easily have
done, and then taken post on the other side of Wolfen∣buttel,
Halberstadt, and Magdeburgh, it might have
waited securely under the cannon of the latter place for
the junction of the Prussian forces; instead of which,
they injudiciously turned off to the Lower Weser, retiring
successively from Hamelen to Nienburg, Verden, Rothen∣burgh,
Buxtchude, and lastly to Stade, where, for want
of subsistence and elbow room, the troops were all made
prisoners of war at large. They made a march of an
hundred and fifty miles to be cooped up in a nook, instead
of taking the other route, which was only about an hun∣dred
miles, and would have led them to a place of safety.
By this unaccountable conduct, the King of Prussia was
not only deprived of the assistance of near forty thousand
good troops, which, in the close of the campaign, might
have put him upon an equality with the French and the
army of the Empire; but also exposed to, and actually
invaded by his numerous enemies on all sides, insomuch
that his situation became now more dangerous than ever;
and the fate which seemed to have threatened the Empress
a few months before, through his means, was, to all
appearance, turned against himself. His ruin was pre∣dicted,
nor could human prudence foresee how he might
be extricated from his complicated distress; for, besides
the invasion of his territories by the French under the
Duke de Richelieu, the Russians, who had made for a
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
long time a dilatory march, and seemed uncertain of their
own resolutions, all at once quickened their motions, and
entered ducal Prussia under Mareschal Apraxin and Ge∣neral
Fermor, marking their progress by every inhumanity
that unbridled cruelty, lust, and rapine can be imagined
capable of committing. A large body of Austrians
entered Silesia, and penetrated as far as Breslau: then,
turning back, they laid siege to the important fortress of
Schweidnitz, the key of that country. A second body
entered Lusatia, another quarter of the Prussian territories,
and made themselves masters of Zittau. Twenty-two
thousand Swedes penetrated into Prussian Pomerania, took
the towns of Anclam and Demmin, and laid the whole
country under contribution. The army of the Empire,
re-enforced by that of Prince Soubise, after many delays,
was at last in full march to enter Saxony; and this
motion left the Austrians at liberty to turn the greatest
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>part of their forces to the reduction of Silesia. An Aus∣trian
general, penetrating through Lusatia, passed by the
Prussian armies, and suddenly presenting himself before
the gates of Berlin, laid the whole country under contri∣bution;
and though he retired on the approach of a body
of Prussians, yet he still found means to interrupt the com∣munication
of these last with Silesia. The Prussians, it
is true, exerted themselves bravely on all sides, and their
enemies fled before them; but whilst one body was pursuing
another gained upon them in some other part. The win∣ter
approached, their strength decayed, and their adver∣saries
multiplied daily. Their king harrassed, and almost
spent with incessant fatigue both of body and of mind,
was in a manner excluded from the Empire. The greatest
part of his dominions were either taken from him, or laid
under contribution, and possessed by his enemies; who
collected the publick revenues, fattened on the contri∣butions,
and with the riches which they drew from the
electorate of Hanover, and other conquests, defrayed the
expences of the war; and by the convention of Closter-Seven
he was deprived of his allies, and left without any
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
assistance whatever, excepting what the British parliament
might think fit to supply. How different is this picture
from that which the King of Prussia exhibited when he
took arms to enter Saxony! But, in order to form a clear
idea of these events, of the situation of his Prussian Ma∣jesty,
and of the steps he took to defeat the designs of his
antagonists, and extricate himself from his great and nu∣merous
distresses, it will be proper now to take a view of
the several transactions of his enemies, as well during his
stay in Bohemia, as from the time of his leaving it, down
to that which we are now speaking of.</P>
<P>§ III. Whilst the King of Prussia was in Bohemia, the
Empress of Russia ordered notice to be given to all masters
of ships, That if any of them were found assisting the
Prussians, by the transportation of troops, artillery, and
ammunition, they should be condemned as legal prizes:
and her fleet, consisting of fifteen men of war and frigates,
with two bomb ketches, was sent to block up the Prussian
ports in the Baltick, where it took several ships of that
nation, which were employed in carrying provisions and
merchandise from one port to another. One of these ships
of war appearing before Memel, a town of Poland, but
subject to Prussia, the commandant sent an officer to the
captain, to know whether he came as a friend or an ene∣my;
to which interrogation the Russian captain replied,
That, notwithstanding the dispositions of the Empress of
both the Russias were sufficiently known, yet he would
further explain them, by declaring that his orders, and
those of the other Russian commanders, were, in con∣formity
to the laws of war, to seise on all the Prussian
vessels they met with on their cruise. Upon which the
commandant of Memel immediately gave orders for point∣ing
the cannon to fire upon all Russian ships that should
approach that place.</P>
<P>§ IV. The land-forces of the Russians had now lingered
on their march upwards of six months; and it was pretty
generally doubted, by those who were supposed to have
the best intelligence, whether they ever were designed
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
really to pass into the Prussian territories, not only on
account of their long stay on the boarders of Lithuania,
but also because several of their Cossacks had been severely
punished for plundering the waggons of some Prussian
peasants upon the frontiers of Courland, and the damage
of the peasants compensated with money, though General
Apraxin's army was at the same time greatly distressed by
the want of provisions; when, on a sudden, they quick∣ened
their motions, and showed they were, in earnest,
determined to accomplish the ruin of Prussia. Their first
act of hostility was the attack of Memel, which surren∣dered;
and by the articles of capitulation it was agreed,
that the garrison should march out with all the honours
of war, after having engaged not to serve against the
Empress, or any of her allies, for the space of one year.</P>
<P>§ V. His Prussian Majesty, justly foreseeing the great
enormities that were to be expected from these savage ene∣mies,
who were unaccustomed to make war, except upon
nations as barbarous as themselves, who looked upon war
only as an opportunity for plunder, and every country
through which they happened to march as their's by right
of conquest, published the following declaration:—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> It
is sufficiently known, that the King of Prussia, after the
example of his glorious predecessors, has, ever since his
accession to the crown, laid it down as a maxim to seek
the friendship of the imperial court of Russia, and culti∣vate
it by every method. His Prussian Majesty hath had
the satisfaction to live, for several successive years, in the
strictest harmony with the reigning Empress; and this
happy union would be still subsisting, if evil-minded po∣tentates
had not broke it by their secret machinations, and
carried things to such a height, that the ministers on both
sides have been recalled, and the correspondence broken
off. However melancholy these circumstances might be
for the King, his Majesty was nevertheless most attentive
to prevent any thing that might increase the alienation of
the Russian court. He hath been particularly careful,
during the disturbances of the war that now unhappily
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
rages, to avoid whatever might involve him in a difference
with that court, notwithstanding the great grievances he
hath to alledge against it; and that it was publickly known
the court of Vienna had at last drawn that of Russia into
its destructive views, and made it serve as an instrumen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for favouring the schemes of Austria. His Majesty hath
given the whole world incontestable proofs, that he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
under an indispensable necessity of having recourse to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
measures he hath taken against the courts of Vienna and
Saxony, who forced him by their conduct to take up arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for his defence. Yet, even since things have been brought
to this extremity, the King hath offered to lay down hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
arms, if proper securities should be granted to him. Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Majesty hath not neglected to expose the artifices by which
the imperial court of Russia hath been drawn into mea∣sures
so opposite to the Empress's sentiments, and which
would excite the utmost indignation of that great princess▪
if the truth could be placed before her without disguise
The King▪ did more: he suggested to her Imperial Ma∣jesty
sufficient means either to excuse her not taking an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
part in the present war, or to avoid, upon the juste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
grounds, the execution of those engagements which the
court of Vienna claimed by a manifest abuse of obligations
which they employed to palliate their unlawful views
It wholly depended upon the Empress of Russia to ex∣tinguish
the flames of the war, without unsheathing th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sword, by pursuing the measures suggested by the King
This conduct would have immortalised her reign through
out all Europe. It would have gained her more lastin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
glory than can be acquired by the greatest triumph▪
The King finds with regret, that all his precautions and
care to maintain peace with the Russian empire are fruit
less, and that the intrigues of his enemies have prevailed
His Majesty sees all the considerations of friendship an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
good neighbourhood set aside by the Imperial court o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Russia, as well as the observance of its engagements wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his Majesty. He sees that court marching its troops throug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the territories of a foreign power, and, contrary to the tene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
of treaties, in order to attack the King in his dominions:
and thus taking part in a war, in which his enemies have
involved the Russian empire. In such circumstances,
the King hath no other part to take, but to employ the
power which God hath entrusted to him in defending
himself, protecting his subjects, and repelling every un∣just
attack. His Majesty will never lose sight of the rules
which are observed, even in the midst of war, among
civilised nations. But if, contrary to all hope and ex∣pectation,
these rules should be violated by the troops of
Russia, if they commit in the King's territories disorders
and excesses disallowed by the laws of arms, his Majesty
must not be blamed if he makes reprisals in Saxony:
and if, instead of that good order and rigorous discipline
which have hitherto been observed by his army, avoiding all
sorts of violence, he finds himself forced, contrary to his in∣clination,
to suffer the provinces and subjects of Saxony to
be treated in the same manner as his own territories shall be
treated. As to the rest, the King will soon pubish to
the whole world the futility of the reasons alledged by the
imperial court of Russia to justify its aggression; and as
his Majesty is forced upon making his defence, he has
room to hope, with confidence, that the Lord of hosts
will bless his righteous arms, that he will disappoint the
unjust enterprises of his enemies, and grant him his power∣ful
assistance to enable him to make head against them.”</P>
<P>§ VI. When the King of Prussia was put under the ban
of the empire, the several princes who compose that body
were required, by the decree of the Aulick council, as
we observed before, to furnish their respective contingents
against him. Those who feared him looked upon this as a
fair opportunity of reducing him; and those who stood in awe
of the house of Austria were, through necessity, compelled
to support that power which they dreaded. Besides, they
were accustomed to the influence of a family, in which the
empire had, for a long time, been in a manner hereditary;
and were also intimidated by the appearance of a confede∣racy,
the most formidable, perhaps, that the world had
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
ever seen. Yet, notwithstanding all this, the contingents,
both of men and money, were collected slowly; the troops
were badly composed; and many of those, not only of
the protestant princes, but also of the catholicks, showed
the utmost reluctance to act against his Prussian Majesty,
which, indeed, none of them would have been able to do,
had it not been for the assistance of the French under the
Prince de Soubise. The Elector-Palatine lost above a
thousand men by desertion. Four thousand of the troops
belonging to the Duke of Wirtemberg being delivered to
the French commissary on the twenty-fourth of June,
were immediately reviewed; but the review was scarcely
finished, when they began to cry aloud, that they were
sold. Next morning thirty of them deserted at once, and
were soon followed by parties of twenty and thirty each,
who forced their way through the detachments that guard∣ed
the gates of Stutgard, and in the evening the mutiny
became general. They fired upon the officers in their
barracks, and let their general know, that if he did not
immediately withdraw, they would put him to death.
Mean while, some of the officers having pursued the de∣serters,
brought back a part of them prisoners, when the
rest of the soldiers declared, that if they were not im∣mediately
released, they would set fire to the stadthouse
and barracks; upon which the prisoners were set at liberty
late in the evening. Next morning the soldiers assembled,
and having seised some of the officers, three or four
hundred of them marched out of the town at a time; with
the musick of the regiments playing before them; and in
this manner near three thousand of them filed off, and the
remainder were afterwards discharged.</P>
<P>§ VII. The King of Prussia, upon his leaving Bohemia
after the battle of Kolin, retired towards Saxony, as we
observed before; and having sent his heavy artillery and
mortars up the Elbe to Dresden, sixed his camp on th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
banks of that river, at Leitmeritz, where his main arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was strongly entrenched, whilst Mareschal Keith, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the troops under his command, encamped on the opposit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
shore; a free communication being kept open by means of
a bridge. At the same time detachments were ordered to
secure the passes into Saxony. As this position of the
King of Prussia prevented the Austrians from being able
to penetrate into Saxony by the way of the Elbe, they
moved, by flow marches, into the circle of Buntzlau,
and, at last, with a detachment commanded by the Duke
d'Aremberg and M. Macguire, on the eighteenth of
June fell suddenly upon, and took, the important post
at Gabel, situated between Boemish-Leypa, and Zittau,
after an obstinate defence made by the Prussian garrison,
under Major-General Putkammer, consisting of four
battalions, who were obliged to surrender prisoners of
war. The Austrians having by this motion gained a
march towards Lusatia, upon a corps which had been de∣tached
under the command of the Prince of Prussia to
watch them, his Prussian Majesty thought proper to leave
Leitmeritz on the twentieth in the morning, and lay that
night at Lickowitz, a village opposite to Leitmeritz, of
which a battalion of his troops still kept possession, while
the rest of his army remained encamped in the plain be∣fore
that place. Next morning, at break of day, Prince
Henry decamped, and made so good a disposition for his
retreat, that he did not lose a single man, though he
marched in sight of the whole body of Austrian irregu∣lars.
He passed the bridge at Leitmeritz, after with∣drawing
the battalion that was in the town, and having
burnt the bridge, the whole army united, and made a
small movement towards the passes of the mountains; the
King then lying at Sulowitz, near the field where the
battle of Lowoschutz was fought on the first of Octo∣ber
of the preceding year. The heavy baggage was sent
on in the afternoon, with a proper escorte; and in the
morning of the twenty-second the army marched in
two columns, and encamped on the high grounds at Lu∣sechitz,
a little beyond Lenai, where it halted the twenty-third.
No attack was made upon the rear-guard, though
great numbers of Austrian hussars, and other irregulars,
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
had appeared the evening before within cannon-shot of the
Prussian camp. On the twenty-fourth the army marched
to Nellendorf; on the twenty-fifth it encamped near
Cotta; on the twenty-sixth near Pirna, where it halted
the next day; and on the twenty-eighth it crossed the
river near that place, and entered Lusatia, where, by the
end of the month, it encamped at Bautzen.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The King's army made this retreat with all the
success that could be wished; but the corps under the
Prince of Prussia had not the same good fortune: for
the Austrians, immediately after their taking Gabel, sent a
strong detachment against Zittau, a trading town in the
circle of Upper-Saxony, where the Prussians had large ma∣gazines,
and a garrison of six battalions, and, in his sight,
attacked it with uncommon rage. Paying no regard to
the inhabitants as being friends or allies, but determined
to reduce the place before the King of Prussia could have
time to march to its relief, they no sooner arrived before it,
than they bombarded and cannonaded it with such fury,
that most of the garrison, finding themselves unable to re∣sist,
made their escape, and carried off as much as they could
of the magazines, leaving only three or four hundred men
in the town, under Colonel Diricke, to hold it out as long
as possible; which he accordingly did, till the whole place
was almost destroyed. The cannonading began on the
twenty-third of July, at eleven in the morning, and lasted
till five in the evening. In this space of time four thousand
balls, many of them red-hot, were fired into this unfortunate
city, with so little intermission, that it was soon set on fire
in several places. In the confusion which the constagration
produced, the Austrians entered the town, and the inhabi∣tants
imagined that they had then nothing further to fear;
and that their friends, the Austrians, would assist them in
extinguishing the flames, and saving the place: but in
this particular their expectations were disappointed. The
Pandours and Sclavonians, who rushed in with the regular
troops, made no distinction between the Prussians and
the inhabitants of Zittau: instead of helping to quench
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
the flames, they began to plunder the warehouses which
the fire had not reached; so that all the valuable merchan∣dise
they contained was either carried off or reduced to
ashes. Upwards of six hundred houses, and almost all
the publick buildings, the cathedrals of St. John and St.
James, the orphan-house, eight parsonage-houses, eight
schools, the town-house, and every thing contained in
it, the publick weigh-house, the prison, the archives,
and all the other documents of the town-council, the
plate, and other things of value, presented to the town
from time to time by emperors, kings, and other
princes and noblemen, were entirely destroyed, and more
than four hundred citizens were killed in this assault.
Of the whole town there was left standing only one
hundred and thirty-eight houses, two churches, the coun∣cil,
library, and the salt-work. The Queen of Poland
was so affected by this melancholy account, that she is
said to have fainted away upon hearing it. As this city
belonged to their friend the King of Poland, the Austrians
thought proper to publish an excuse for their conduct,
ascribing it entirely to the necessity they were under, and
the obstinate defence made by the Prussian garrison. But
what excuses can atone for such barbarity?</P>
<P>§ IX. The corps under the Prince of Prussia, which
had been witnesses to the destruction of this unhappy place,
was, by the King's march to Bautzen, fortunately extri∣cated
from the danger of being surrounded by the Austri∣ans,
who, upon his Majesty's approach, retired from
their posts on the right. Soon after this event the Prince
of Prussia, finding his health much impaired by the fatigues
of the campaign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the reason that was publickly assigned for his quitting the army: but a much more probable one, which was only whispered, seems to have been, that this prince, than whom none ever was more remarkable for hu∣manity and the social virtues, disliking the violent proceedings of the king his brother, could not refrain from expostulating with him on that subject: upon which his Majesty, with an air of great disapprobation, told him, “That the air of Berlin would be better for him than that of the camp.” The Prince accordingly retired to Berlin, where he died soon after; grief and concern for the welfare of his brother, and for the steps taken by him, having no small share in his death.</NOTE>, quitted the army, and returned to
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
Berlin. In the mean time, Mareschal Keith, who had
been left upon the frontier, to guard the passes of the
mountains of Bohemia, arrived at Pirna, having been
much harrassed in his march by the enemy's irregular
troops, and lost some waggons of provisions and baggage.
After resting a day at Pirna, he pursued his march through
Dresden with twenty battalions and forty squadrons, and
encamped on the right of the Elbe, before the gate of the
new city, from whence he joined the King between
Bautzen and Gorlitz. The Prussian army now reassembled
at this place amounted to about sixty thousand men,
besides twelve battalions and ten squadrons which remained
in the famous camp at Pirna, under the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau,
to cover Dresden, secure the gorges of the moun∣tains,
and check the incursions of the Austrian irregulars,
with whom, as they were continually flying about the
skirts of the Prussian army, as well in their encampments
as on their marches, almost daily skirmishes happened,
with various success. Though some of these encounters
were very bloody, they cost the Prussians much fewer
men than they lost by desertion since the battle of Kolin.
The reason seems obvious:—The Prussian army had been
recruited, in times of peace, from all parts of Germany;
and though this way of recruiting may be very proper in
such times, yet it cannot be expected to answer in a state
of actual war, especially an unfortunate war: because
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idelity of such foldiers can never be so much depended
on as that of natives, who serve their natural sovereign
from principle, and not merely for pay, and who must
desert their country, their parents, and their friends, at
the same time that they desert their prince.</P>
<P>§ X. It will be proper here to take notice of some events,
which could not easily be mentioned before without
breaking through the order we have proposed to ourselves
in the writing of this history.—The Empress-Queen,
more embittered than ever against the King of Prussia and
his allies, recalled her ministers, Count Coloredo and
Mons. Zohern, from London, towards the beginning of
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
July; and about the same time Count Kaunitz, great
chancellor of the empire, informed Mr. Keith, the
British minister at Vienna, that the court of London, by
the succours it had given, and still continued to give, the
King of Prussia, as well as by other circumstances relating
to the present state of affairs, having broken the solemn
engagements which united this crown with the house of
Austria, her Majesty the Empress-Queen had thought
proper to recall her minister from England, and conse∣quently
to break off all correspondence. Mr. Keith, in
pursuance of this notice, set out from Vienna on the
twenty-ninth of July; as did also Mr. Desrolles, his Bri∣tannick
Majesty's minister at the court of Brussels, from
this last place, about the same time. On the seventh of
July, General Pisa, commandant of Ostend, Nieuport,
and the maritime ports of Flanders, sent his adjutant to the
English vice-consul at Ostend, at six o'clock in the morn∣ing,
to tell him, that by orders from his court all communi∣cation
with England was broke off; and desired the vice∣consul
to intimate to the pacquet-boats and British shipping
at Ostend, Bruges, and Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>port, to depart in twenty-four
hours, and not to return into any of the ports of the
Empress-Queen till further dispositions should be made.
The reasons alledged by the court of Vienna for debar∣ring
the subjects of his Britannick Majesty from the use
of these ports, obtained for the house of Austria by the
arms and treasures of Great Britain, were, “That her
Imperial Majesty, the Empress-Queen, could not, with
indifference, see England, instead of giving the succours
due to her by the most solemn treaties, enter into an
alliance with her enemy the King of Prussia, and actually
afford him all manner of assistance, assembling armies to
oppose those which the Most Christian King, her ally,
had sent to her aid, and suffering privateers to exercise
open violence in her roads, under the cannon of her ports
and coasts, without giving the least satisfaction or answer
to the complaints made on that account; and the King of
Great-Britain himself, at the very time she was offering
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
him a neutrality for Hanover, publishing by a message to
his parliament, that she had formed, with the Most
Christian King, dangerous designs against that electorate:
therefore, her Majesty, desirous of providing for the
security of her ports, judged it expedient to give the
forementioned orders; and at the same time to declare,
that she could no longer permit a free communication
between her subjects and the English, which had hitherto
been founded upon treaties that Great-Britain had, with∣out
scruple, openly violated.”—Notwithstanding these
orders, the English pacquet-boats, with letters, were
allowed to pass as usual to and from Ostend; the ministers
of her Imperial Majesty wisely considering how good a
revenue the postage of English letters brings in to the post-office
of the Austrian Netherlands. Ostend and Nieu∣port,
by order of her Imperial Majesty, received each of
them a French garrison; the former on the nineteenth of
July, and the latter the next day, under the command of
M. de la Motte, upon whose arrival the Austrian troops
evacuated those places; though the Empress-Queen still
reserved to herself, in both of them, the full and free
exercise of all her rights of sovereignty; to which purpose
an oath was administered to the French commandant by
her Majesty's minister-plenipotentiary for the government
of the Low Countries. At the same time, their Imperial
and Most Christian Majesties notified to the magistracy of
Hamburgh, that they must not admit any English men of
war, or transports, into their port, on pain of having a
French garrison imposed on them. The city of Guel∣dres,
which had been blocked up by the French ever since
the beginning of summer, was forced by famine to capitu∣late
on the twenty-fourth of August, and the garrison
marched out with all the honours of war, in order to be
conducted to Berlin; but so many of them deserted, that
when they passed by Cologn, the whole garrison consisted
only of the commandant, and forty-seven men. By the
surrender of this place the whole country lay open to the
French and their allies quite up to Magdebourg; and the
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
Empress-Queen immediately received two hundred thou∣sand
crowns from the revenues of Cleves and la Marcke
alone.</P>
<P>§ XI. To return to the affairs more immediately re∣lating
to the King of Prussia. The advanced posts of
the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau at Pirna were attacked on
the tenth of August by a body of hussars, and other irregu∣lar
troops of the Austrians; but the Prussians soon obliged
them to retire, with the loss of several men and two pieces
of cannon. On the nineteenth of the same month, early
in the morning, a great number of Austrian Pandours
surrounded a little town called Gotliebe, in which a
Prussian garrison was quartered, with a design to take it
by surprise. The Pandours attacked it on all sides, and
in the beginning killed twenty-three Prussians, and
wounded many; but the Prussians having rallied, re∣pulsed
the assailants with great loss. These, however,
were but a sort of preludes to much more decisive actions
which happened soon after. Silesia, which had hitherto
been undisturbed this year, began now to feel the effects
of war. Baron Jahnus, an Austrian colonel, entering
that country with only an handful of men, made himself
master of Hirschberg, Waldenberg, Gottesburg, Fran∣kenstein,
and Landshut. They were, indeed, but open
places, and he was repulsed in an attempt upon Strigau.
On the side of Franconia the army of the empire was
assembling with all speed, under the Prince of Saxe-Hild∣burghausen;
the French were marching a second army
from their interior provinces into Alface, in order to join
the Imperialists: the first division of their troops had
already entered the empire, and were advanced as far as
Hanau. The Swedes were now preparing, with the ut∣most
expedition, to send a numerous army into Pomerania;
and the Russians, who, since the taking of Memel, had
not done the King of Prussia much damage, besides that
of obliging him to keep an army in Prussia to oppose them,
and interrupting the trade of Koningsberg by their squa∣drons,
were again advancing with hasty strides towards
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
Prussia, marking their steps with horrid desolation.
Field-Mareschal Lehwald, who had been left in Prussia,
with an army of thirty thousand men, to guard that king∣dom
during the absence of his master, was encamped near
Velau, when the Russians, to the number of eighty thou∣sand,
after taking Memel, advanced against the territoiries
of the Prussian King, whose situation now drew upon him
the attention of all Europe. In the night between the
seventh and eighth of August, Colonel Malachowski, one
of Mareschal Lehwald's officers, marched to reconnoitre
the position of the enemy, when a skirmish happened,
which lasted near two hours, between his advanced rank<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and a Russian detachment, three times stronger than the
Prussians. The Russians were repulsed, and fled into the
woods, after having fifty men killed, and a great number
wounded. The Prussians lost but one man, and had four∣teen
wounded.</P>
<P>§ XII. Several other little skirmishes happened between
straggling parties of the two armies; and the Russians
went on pillaging and laying waste every thing before
them, till at length the two armies having approached
one another in Brandenburgh-Prussia, Mareschal Leh∣wald,
finding it impossible to spare detachments from so
small a number as his was, compared to that of the enemy,
to cover the wretched inhabitants from the outrages com∣mitted
on them by the Russian Cossacks, and other bari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rians
belonging to them, judged it absolutely necessary to
attack their main army, and accordingly, notwithstanding
his great disadvantage in almost every respect, he resolved
to hazard a battle on the thirtieth of August. The Rus∣sians,
consisting, as we before observed, of eighty thou∣sand
regulars, under the command of Mareschal Aprax<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
avoiding the open field, were entrenched in a most ad∣vantageous
camp near Norkitten, in Prussia. Their army
was composed of four lines, each of which was guarded
by an entrenchment, and the whole was defended by
two hundred pieces of cannon, batteries being placed upo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all the eminences. Mareschal Lehwald's army scarcely
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
amounted to thirty thousand men. The action began at
five in the morning, and was carried on with so much vi∣gour,
that the Prussians entirely broke the whole first line
of the enemy, and forced all their batteries. The Prince
of Holstein-Gottorp, brother to the King of Sweden, at
the head of his regiment of dragoons, routed the Russian
cavalry, and afterwards fell upon a regiment of grena∣diers,
which was cut to pieces; but when the Prussians
came to the second entrenchment, Mareschal Lehwald,
seeing that he could not attempt to carry it without ex∣posing
his army too much, took the resolution to retire.
The Prussians returned to their former camp at Velau,
and the Russians remained in their present situation.
The loss of the Prussians, little exceeding two thousand
killed and wounded, was immediately replaced out of the
disciplined militia. The Russians lost a much greater
number. General Lapuchin was wounded and taken
prisoner, with a colonel of the Russian artillery, but the
former was sent back on his parole. The Prussian army
had, at first, made themselves masters of above eighty
pieces of cannon, but were afterwards obliged to abandon
them, with eleven of their own, for want of carriages.
Three Russian generals were killed; but the Prussians lost
no general or officer of distinction, of which rank Count
Dohna was the only one that was wounded.</P>
<P>§ XIII. After this engagement, Mareschal Lehwald
changed the position of his army, by drawing towards
Peterswald, and the Russians, after remaining quite in∣active
till the thirteenth of September, on a sudden, to the
great surprise of every one, retreated out of Prussia, with
such precipitation, that they left all their sick and wounded
behind them, to the amount of fifteen or sixteen thousand
men, together with eighty pieces of cannon, and a consi∣derable
part of their military stores. Mareschal Apraxin
masked his design by advancing all his irregulars towards
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Prussian army; so that Mareschal Lehwald was not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nformed of it till the third day, when he detached Prince
George of Holstein with ten thousand horse to pursue
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
them; but with little hopes of coming up with them, as
they made forced marches, in order to be the sooner in their
own country. However, the Prussians took some of them
prisoners, and many stragglers were killed by the country
people in their flight towards Tilfit, which they aban∣doned,
though they still kept Memel, and shortly after
added some new fortifications to that place. They made
their retreat in two columns, one of which directed it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
course towards Memel; whilst the other took the nearest
way through the bailiwick of Absternen, and threw bridge
over the river Jura. Both columns burnt every village
they passed through without distinction. The Prussian
were obliged to desist from the pursuit of these barbarians
because the bridges thrown over the river Memel had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
destroyed by the violence of the stream. The Russia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
army suffered greatly for want of bread, as all the countrie
were ruined through which it passed, so that they coul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
procure no sort of subsistence but herbage and rye bread
All the roads were strewed with dead bodies of men an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
horses. The real cause of this sudden retreat is a
great a mystery as the reason of their stopping so long th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
year before on the borders of Lithuania; though the oc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>casion
of it is said to have been the illness of the Czarina
who was seised with a kind of apoplectick fit, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
made some new regulation in case of a vacancy of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
throne, which rendered it expedient that the regula<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
forces should be at hand, to support the measures take<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by the government.</P>
<P>§ XIV. The King of Prussia, after remaining for som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time
encamped between Bautzen and Goerlitz, remove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his head-quarters to Bernstedel; and on the fifteenth o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
August his army came in sight of the Austrian camp, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
within cannon shot of it: upon which the Austrian
struck their tents, and drew up in order of battle befor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their camp. The King formed his army over again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
them, and immediately went to reconnoitre the groun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
between the armies; but, as it was then late, he deferre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the more exact examination of that circumstance till th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext day. The two armies continued under arms all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight. Next morning, at break of day, the King found
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Austrians encamped with their right at the river
Veisle; the rest of their army extended along a rising
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>round, at the foot of a mountain covered with wood,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich protected their left, and before their front, at the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ottom of the hill on which they were drawn up, was a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nall brook, passable only in three places, and for no more
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an four or five men a-breast. Towards the left of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir army was an opening, where three or four battalions
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight have marched in front: but behind it they had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laced three lines of infantry, and on a hill which flanked
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is opening, within musket-shot, were placed four thou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd
foot, with forty or fifty pieces of cannon; so that,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reality, this was the strongest part of their camp. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing left nothing undone to bring the Austrians to a bat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e;
but finding them absolutely bent on avoiding it, after
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing four days before them, he and his army returned to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir camp at Bernstedel. They were followed by some
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the enemy's hussars and Pandours, who, however, had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot the satisfaction to take the smallest booty in this re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat.
The Austrian army, which thus declined engaging,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as, by their own account, an hundred and thirty thou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and
strong, more than double the number of the King of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>russia, who, the day he returned to Bernstedel, after he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad retired about two thousand yards, again drew up his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmy in line of battle, and remained so upwards of an
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, but not a man stirred from the Austrian camp.
The army of the Empire, commanded by the Prince of
Saxe-Hildburghausen, and that of the French under the
Prince de Soubise, making together about fifty thousand
men, half of which were French, had by this time joined,
and advanced as far as Erfurth in Saxony; upon which
his Prussian Majesty, finding that all his endeavours could
not bring the Austrians to an engagement, set out from
Lusatia, accompanied by Mareschal Keith, with sixteen
battalions and forty squadrons of his troops, and arrived
at Dresden on the twenty-ninth of August, leaving the
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
rest of the army in a strong camp, under the Prince of Be¦vern.
With this detachment, which, by the junction o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
several bodies of troops, amounted to about forty thousan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
men, he made a quick march, by the way of Leipzig
towards Erfurth, to give battle to the united army of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
French and the Empire. But by the time he arrived a
Erfurth, which was on the fourteenth of September
the enemy had retreated towards Gotha; and upon hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
further approach, they retired to Eyesenach, where the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
entrenched themselves in a very strong camp. His Ma¦jesty's
head-quarters were at Kirschlaben, near Erfurth
While the two armies were thus situated, Major-Genera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Seydelitz, who occupied the town of Gotha, being in¦formed,
on the nineteenth, that a large body of the enemy
was coming towards him, and that it consisted of tw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
regiments of Austrian hussars, one regiment of French
hussars, and a detachment made up of French grenadiers
troops of the army of the Empire, and a great number of
Croats and Pandours, retired, and posted himself at some
distance. The enemy immediately took possession of the
town and castle; but General Seydelitz, having been re∣enforced,
attacked the enemy with such vigour, that he
soon obliged them to abandon their new conquest, and
to retire with great precipitation; a report having been
spread, that the Prussian army was advancing against them,
with the King himself in person. The Prussian hussars
took a considerable booty on this occasion, and General
Seydelitz sent prisoners to the camp one lieutenant-colonel,
three majors, four lieutenants, and sixty-two
soldiers of the enemy, who had also about an hundred and
thirty killed. After this action his Prussian Majesty ad∣vanced
near Eyesenach, with a design to attack the com∣bined
army; but they were so strongly entrenched that he
found it impracticable. His provisions falling short, he
was obliged to retire towards Erfurth, and soon after to
Naumburgh on the river Sala; whereupon the combined
army marched, and again took possession of Gotha, Er∣furth,
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
and Weimar; which last place, however, they
soon after quitted.</P>
<P>§ XV. Upon the King of Prussia's leaving Bernstedel,
the Austrians took possession of it on the sixth of Septem∣ber,
and made prisoners a Prussian battalion which had been
left there. The next day fifteen thousand Austrians attack∣ed
two battalions of General Winterfield's troops, being
part of the Prince of Bevern's army, who were posted on a
high ground on the other side of the Neiss, near Henners∣dorff,
in the neighbourhood of Goerlitz; and, after being
repulsed several times, at last made themselves masters of
the eminence. The loss, in this action, was considerable
on both sides, but greatest on that of the Prussians, not so
much by the number of their slain, which scarcely ex∣ceeded
that of the Austrians, as by the death of their brave
General Winterfield, who, as he was leading up succours
to the battalions that were engaged, received a shot from
a cannon, of which he died the night following. The
Generals Nadasti and Clerici, Count d'Arberg, Colonel
Elrickhausen, and several other officers of distinction, were
wounded, and the young Count of Groesbeck and the
Marquis d'Asque killed, on the side of the Austrians, who
took six pieces of the Prussian cannon, six pair of their
colours, and made General Kemeke, the Count d'Anhalt,
and some other officers, prisoners. After this skirmish,
the Prince of Bevern, with the Prussian army under his
command, retreated from Goerlitz to Rotenberg, then
passed the Queiss at Sygersdorff, from whence he marched
to Buntzlau, in Silesia, and on the first of October reached
Breslau, without suffering any loss, though the numerous
army of the Austrians followed him for some days. Upon
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his arrival there, he chose a very strong camp on the other
side of the Oder, in order to cover the city of Breslau, to
the fortifications of which he immediately added several
new works. Though neither side had any very signal
advantage in this engagement, more than that the Austri∣ans
remained masters of the field, yet great rejoicings were
made at Vienna on account of it. The death of Gene∣ral
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
Winterfield was, indeed, an irreparable loss to his
Prussian Majesty, who received at the same time the
news of this misfortune, and of the Swedes having now
actually begun hostilities in Pomerania.</P>
<P>§ XVI. A body of the French, who, let loose against
the King of Prussia by the ever-memorable and shameful
convention of Closter-Seven, had entered the territories of
Halberstadt and Magdeburgh, were worsted at Eglen by
a party of six hundred men, under the command of Coun
Horn, whom Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick had detach¦ed
from a body of troops with which his Prussian Majest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had sent him to defend those countries. The Prussian
took prisoners the Count of Lusignan, colonel, eightee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
other French officers, and four hundred soldiers, and mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
themselves masters of a considerable booty in baggage, &amp;
with the loss of only two men; and, moreover, a Frenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
officer and forty men were made prisoners at Halberstad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Upon this check the French evacuated the country
Halberstadt for a little while, but returning again on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
twenty-ninth of September, with a considerable re-e¦forcement
from Mareschal Richelieu's army, which
now could easily spare, Prince Ferdinand was obliged
retire to Winsteben, near the city of Magdeburgh. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
dangers which had been hitherto kept at a distance fre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Prussian dominions, by the surprising activity of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
king, now drew nearer, and menaced them on all fid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mareschal Richelieu, with eighty battalions and an hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dred
squadrons, entered the country of Halberstadt, a
levied immense contributions; whilst the allied army
the French and Imperialists, being joined by six thousa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
men under General Laudohn, who had just defeate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Weissenfels, a city in the very centre of Thuringia. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Swedes had actually taken some towns in Pomerania, a

part of Silesia, had now laid siege to Schweidni
and were preparing to pass the Oder, in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
the Prince of Bevern in his camp near Breslau. In the
mean time, they made frequent, and always destructive
incursions into Brandenburgh; to oppose which his
Prussian Majesty ordered detachments from all his regi∣ments
in those parts to join the militia of the country,
and sent the Prince of Anhalt Dessau from Leipzig, with
a body of ten thousand men, to guard Berlin, whilst he
himself marched with the troops under his command to
Interbeck, on the frontier of the Lower Lusatia, to be the
more at hand to cover Brandenburgh, and preserve the
communication with Silesia.</P>
<P>§ XVII. While these precautions were taking, General
Haddick, with fifteen or sixteen thousand Austrians, en∣tered
Brandenburgh on the sixteenth of October, and
the next day arrived before Berlin, of which city he de∣manded
a contribution of six hundred thousand crowns,
but contented himself with two hundred and ten thousand.
The Austrians pillaged two of the suburbs, but before they
could do any further mischief they were obliged to retire
in great haste, at the approach of the Prince of Anhalt
Dessau, whose van-guard entered the city in the evening
of their departure. This alarm, however, obliged the
Queen and the royal family of Prussia to remove to Mag∣deburgh
on the twenty-third; and the most valuable re∣cords
were sent to the fort of Spandau, at the conflux of
the Havel and the Sphere. On the other hand, the un∣fortunate
inhabitants of Leipzig now selt most severly the
cruel effects of the power of their new master. The
Prussian commandant in the city had, by order of his
King, demanded of them three hundred thousand crowns,
a sum far greater than it was in their power to raise.
This truth they represented, but in vain. The short
time allowed them to furnish their contingents being ex∣pired,
and all their efforts to comply with this demand
having proved ineffectual, they were subjected to the ri∣gours
of military execution; in consequence of which
their houses were occupied by the soldiery, who seised
upon the best apartments, and lived at discretion; but
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
the sum demanded could not be found. Such was the
situation of this distressed city, when, on the fifteenth of
October, an express arrived, with advice that his Prussian
Majesty would soon be there; and accordingly he arrived
a few minutes after, attended by his life-guards. At the
same time, a rumour was spread that the city would be
delivered up to pillage, which threw the inhabitants into
the utmost consternation. Their fears, however, in that
respect were soon abated, by his Majesty's declaring that
he was willing to spare the place, upon condition that
half the sum required should be immediately paid. All
that could be done was to collect among the merchants,
traders, and others, fifty thousand crowns; bills of Ex∣change
were drawn upon Amsterdam and London for
seventy thousand crowns, and hostages were given, by
way of security, for the payment of thirty thousand more
within a time which was agreed on. But still, notwith∣standing
this, the military execution was continued, even
with greater rigour than before, and all the comfort the
wretched inhabitants could obtain was, that it should
cease whenever advice should be received that their bills
were accepted.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. The King of Prussia had tried several times
to bring the combined army under the Princes Saxe-Hild∣burghausen
and Soubise to an engagement upon fair
ground; but finding them bent on declining it, notwith∣standing
the superiority of their numbers, he had recourse
to one of those strokes in war, by which a general is better
seen than by the gaining of a victory. He made a feint,
soon after the beginning of October, as if he intended no∣thing
more than to secure his own dominions, and march
his army into winter-quarters back to Berlin, leaving
Mareschal Keith, with only seven or eight thousand men,
to defend Leipzig. Upon this the enemy took courage,
passed the Sala, and having marched up to the city, sum∣moned
the Mareschal to surrender, to which he answered,
That the King, his master, had ordered him to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end the
place to the last extremity, and he would obey his orders.
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
The enemy then thought of besieging the city; but, before
they could prepare any one implement for that purpose,
they were alarmed by the approach of the King of Prussia,
who, judging that his feint would probably induce them to
take the step they did, had, by previous and private orders,
collected together all his distant detachments, some of
which were twenty leagues asunder, and was advancing,
by long marches, to Leipzig; upon notice of which the
enemy repassed the Sala. The Prussian army was reassem∣bled
on twenty-seventh of October, and remained at
Leipzig the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth, when every
body expected a battle would be fought in the plains of
Lutzen. On the thirtieth the King drew nigh that place,
and on the thirty-first, in his way through Weissenfels
and Meresbourg, he made five hundred men prisoners of
war. The combined army had repassed the Sala at Weis∣senfels,
Meresbourg, and Halle, where they broke down
the bridges, but these were soon repaired, and the whole
Prussian army, amounting to no more than twenty thou∣sand
men, having passed that river, through these towns,
in each of which they left a battalion, joined again on the
third of November, in the evening, over-against the enemy,
whose forces consisted of forty thousand French, and
twenty-five thousand Imperialists. On the fifth, about
nine o'clock in the morning, the Prussians received intel∣ligence
that the enemy were every where in motion.
They likewise heard the drums beating the march, and,
so near were the two armies to each other, plainly perceived
from their camp, that their whole infantry, which had
drawn nearer upon the rising grounds over against them,
was filing off towards their right. No certain judgement
could, however, yet be formed of the enemy's real design,
and, as they were in want of bread, it was thought proba∣ble
that they intended to repass the Unstrut: but it was
soon perceived that their several motions were contra∣dictory
to each other. At the same time that some of
their infantry were filing off towards their right, a large
body of cavalry wheeled round towards their lest, direct∣ing
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
its march all along to the rising grounds with which
the whole Prussian camp, that lay in a bottom between
the villages of Rederow and Rosbach, was surrounded,
within the reach of large cannon. Soon after that, the ca∣valry
were seen to halt, and afterwards to fall back to the
right; though some of them still remained where they
were, whilst the rest marched back. About two in the
afternoon the doubts of the Prussians were cleared up; it
plainly appearing then that the enemy intended to attack
them, and that their dispositions were made with a view
to surround them, and to open the action by attacking
them in the rear. A body of reserve was posted over
against Rederow, to fall upon their routed troops, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase
they should be defeated, and to prevent their retiring to
Meresbourg, the only retreat which could then have
been lest them. In this situation the King of Prussia re∣solved
to attack them. His Majesty had determined to
make the attack with one wing only, and the disposition
of the enemy made it necessary that it should be the left
wing. The very instant the battle was going to begin,
his Majesty ordered the general who commanded the
right wing to decline engaging, to take a proper position
in consequence thereof, and, above all, to prevent his
being surrounded. All the cavalry of the right wing of
the Prussians, except two or three squadrons, had already
marched to the lest at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull gallop; and being arrived at
the place assigned them, they formed over against that of
the enemy. They then moved on immediately, the
enemy's advanced to meet them, and the charge was very
sierce, several regiments of the French coming on with
great resolution. The advantage, however, was entirely
on the side of the Prussians. The enemy's cavalry being
routed, were pursued <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or a considerable time with great
spirit, but having afterwards reached an eminence, which
gave them an opportunity of rallying, the Prussian cavalry
fell upon them afresh, and gave them so total a defeat,
that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led the utmost disorder. This happened at
four in the afternoon. Whilst the cavalry of the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sssians
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
charged, their infantry opened. The enemy cannonaded
them briskly during this interval, and did some execution,
but the Prussian artillery <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as not idle. After this can∣nonading
had continued o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both sides a full quarter of an
hour, without the least intermission, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire of the infan∣try
began. The enemy could not stand it, nor resist the
valour of the Prussian foot, who gallantly marched up to
their batteries. The batterie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were carried one after ano∣ther,
and the enemy were forced to give way, which they
did in great confusion. As the left wing of the Prussians
advanced, the right changed its position, and having soon
met with a small rasing ground, they availed themselves of
it, by planting it with sixteen pieces of heavy artillery.
The fire from thence was partly pointed at the enemy's
right, to increase the disorder there, and took their left
wing in front, which was excessively ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led thereby. At
five the victory was decided, the cannonading ceased, and
the enemy fled on all sides. They were pursued as long
as there was any light to distinguish them, and it may be
said, that might alone was the preservation of this army,
which had been so formidable in the morning. They
took the benefit of the darkness to hurry into Fryb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgh,
and there to repass the Unstrut, which they did on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he
morning of the sixth, after a whole night's march. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
King of Prussia set out early in the morning to pursue
them with all his cavalry, supported by four battalions of
grenadiers, the infantry following them in two columns.
The enemy had passed the Unstrut at Fryburgh, when the
Prussians arrived on its banks, and as they had burnt the
bridge, it became necessary to make another, which, how∣ever,
was soon done. The cavalry passed first, but could
not come up with the enemy till five in the evening, upon
the hills of Eckersberg. It was then too late to force
them there, for which reason the King thought proper to
canton his army in the nearest villages, and to be satisfied
with the success his hussars had in taking near three hun∣dred
baggage-waggons, and every thing they contained.
The whole loss of the Prussians, in this important engage∣ment,
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
did not exceed five hundred men killed and
wounded. Among the former was General Meincke,
and among the latter Prince Henry and General S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yde∣litz.
The enemy lost sixty-four pieces of cannon, a great
many standards and colours, near three thousand men
killed on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield of battle, and upwards of eight thousand
taken prisoners, among whom were several generals, and
other officers of distinction. Three hundred waggons
were sent to Leipzig, laden with wounded French and
Swiss. Upon the approach of the Prussians towards
Eckersberg, the enemy retreated with great precipitation;
and, after marching all night, arrived the next day at Er∣furth,
in the utmost want of every necessary of life, not
having had a morsel of bread for two days, during which
they had been obliged to live upon turneps, radishes, and
other roots, which they dug out of the earth. The French,
under the Duke de Richelieu, were preparing to go into
winter-quarters; but, upon the news of this defeat of the
combined army, they again put themselves in motion, and
a large detachment of them advanced as far as Duderstadt,
to favour the retreat of their countrymen under the Prince
de Soubise, who, with great precipitancy, made the best of
their way from Erfurth to the county of Hohenstein, and
from thence bent their march towards Halberstadt. Of
the remains of the Imperial army, which was now almost
entirely dispersed, whole bodies deserted, and went over
to the King of Prussia, soon after this battle.</P>
<P>§ XIX. Whilst his Prussian Majesty was thus successful
against the French and Imperialists, the Austrians, who
had carefully avoided coming to an open engagement with
him, gained ground a-pace in Silesia. A detachment of
their army, under the command of Count Nadasti, had
already invested Schweidnitz, and opened the trenches
before it on the twenty-sixth of October. The Prussian
garrison, commanded by General de la Motte Fouquet,
determined to desend the place as long as possible; and
accordingly on the thirtieth they made a sally, in which
they killed, wounded, and took prisoners, eight hundred
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
of the besiegers, and did some damage to their works; but
on the sixth of November the Austrians began to can∣nonade
the city furiously, and on the eleventh made them∣selves
masters of the ramparts by assault. The garrisson,
however, having taken care, during the siege, to throw up a
strong entrenchment in the market-place, retreated thither,
and held out till the next day, when they surrendered
themselves prisoners of war. After the reduction of this
place, General Nadasti, leaving in it a sufficient garrison,
marched with the remainder of his troops, and joined the
main army of the Austrians, under the command of Prince
Charles of Lorraine and Maresehal Daun, who, whilst he
was busied in the siege of Schweidnitz, had invested Bres∣lau
on the lest of the Oder; the Prince of Bevern de∣fending
it on the right, where he was strongly encamped,
with his little army, under the cannon of the city. The
whole army of the Austrians being now reassembled,
and intelligence having been brought, not only of the
King of Prussia's late victory near Leipzig, but also that
he was advancing to the relief of the Prince of Bevern, it
was resolved immediately to attack the last in his en∣trenchments.
Accordingly, on the twenty-second of No∣vember,
about nine in the morning, the Austrians began
a most furious discharge of their cannon, forty of which
were twenty-four pounders, and this continued without
ceasing till one, when it was succeeded by a severe fire of
their small arms, which lasted till five in the evening.
The Prussians, with undaunted resolution, stood two of
the most violent attacks that were ever made, but at the
third, overpowered by numbers, and assailed on both sides,
they began to lose ground, and were forced to retire from
one entrenchment to another. In this extremity, night
coming on, the Prussian generals fearing their entrench∣ments
would be entirely forced, and that they should then
be totally defeated, thought proper to retreat. The Prince
of Bevern, with the greatest part of the army, retired to
an eminence on the banks of the Oder, whilst the rest
of the troops threw themselves into Breslau, which they
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
might have defended, in all probability, till the King had
come up to its relief. But, on the twenty-fourth, their
commander in chief, the Prince of Bevern, going to re∣connoitre
the enemy, with only a single groom to attend
him, fell in among a party of Croats, who took him pri∣soner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are told, that he mistook these Croats for Prussian hussars. But some of the circumstance of this mysterious affair were interpreted into a premedi∣tated design in the Prince to be taken prisoner. It cannot otherwise be sup∣posed that a man of his rank, a prince, a commander in chief, should officiously undertake the always dangerous task of reconnoitring the enemy, with so slight an attendance as only one man, and that but a groom, even if he had judged it necessary to see things with his own eyes. Some secret dissatisfaction, hither to unknown to us, may possibly have been the cause of his taking this s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep; or, which seems still more probable, he might be ashamed, or, perhaps, even afraid to see the King his master, after having so injudiciously abandoned the defence of Breslau, by qui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing his lines, which, it is asserted, his Prussi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Majesty had sent him express orders not to quit on any account what ever, for that he would certainly be with him by the fifth of December, in which we shall find he kept his word.</NOTE>.
His army, thus deprived of their general, re∣treated
northward that night, leaving in Breslau only
four battalions, who, the next day, surrendered the place
by capitulation, one of the articles of which was, that they
should not serve against the Empress, or her allies, for two
years. All the magazines, chests, artillery, &amp;c. remained
in the hands of the Austrians. The garrison marched out
with all military honours, conducted by General Leswitz,
governor of Breslau. Though the Austrians sung <HI>Te
Deum</HI> for this victory, they owned that such another would
put an end to their army, for it cost them the lives of
twelve thousand men; a number almost equal to the
whole of the Prussian army before the battle. They had
four almost inaccessible intrenchments to force, planted
thick with cannon, which fired cartridge-shot from nine
in the morning till the evening, and the Prussians, when
attacked, were never once put into the least confusion.
Among the slain, on the side of the Austrians, were Ge∣neral
Wurben, and several other officers of distinction.
The loss of the Prussians did not much exceed three thou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sand
men, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, of which
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
last there were about sixteen hundred. Their General
Kleist was found dead on the field of battle.</P>
<P>§ XX. The King of Prussia, who, like Caesar, thought
nothing was done while any thing was left undone, staid
no longer at Rosbach than till the routed forces of the
French and Imperialists, whom he had defeated there on
the fifth of November, were totally dispersed. Then he
marched directly with the greatest part of his army for
Silesia, and on the twenty-fourth of that month arrived
at Naumburg on the Queiss, a little river which runs into
the Bobber, having in his route detached Mareschal
Keith, with the rest of his army, to clear Saxony from all
the Austrian parties, and then to make an irruption into
Bohemia, a service which he performed so effectually as
to raise large contributions in the circles of Satz and
Leitmeritz, and even to give an alarm to Prague itself.
His Majesty reserved for himself only fifteen thousand men,
with whom he advanced, with his usual rapidity, to
Barchwitz, where, notwithstanding all that had happened
at Schweidnitz and at Breslau, he was joined by twenty-four
thousand more; part of them troops which he had
ordered from Saxony, part the remains of the army lately
commanded by the Prince of Bevern, and part the late
garrison of Schweidnitz, which had found means to
escape from the Austrians, and accidentally joined their
King upon his march<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whilst the Austrians were conducting them to prison, on their route they chanced to hear of the victory their master had gained at Rosbach. Ani∣mated by these tidings, they unanimously rose upon the escort that guarded them, which, happening not to be very strong, they entirely dispersed. Thus freed, they marched on, not very certain of their way, in hopes to rejoin some corps of the Prussian troops, their countrymen. The same fortune which freed them led them directly to the army commanded by the King himself, which was hastening to their relief, as well as to that of the Prince of Be∣ver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. This unexpected meeting was equally pleasing to both, the prisoner, not having heard any thing of his Majesty's march; and, at the same time, this lucky incident, whilst it added a considerable strength to the army, added likewise to its confidence, for the slightest occurrence is construed into anomen, by an army at the eve of an engagement.</NOTE>. With this force, though greatly
inferior in number to that of the enemy, he resolved to
attack the Austrians, who were entrenched at Lissa near
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
Breslau. On the fourth of December he seised upon their
ovens at Neumarck, and upon a considerable magazine,
guarded by two regiments of Croats, who retired to a
rising ground, where his Majesty ordered his hussars to
surround them, and send a trumpet to summon them to
surrender themselves prisoners of war. Upon their refusal,
the hussars of Zithen fell upon them sabre in hand, and
some hundreds of them having been cut in pieces, the rest
threw down their arms, begging for quarter on their knees.
After this s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isure, and after having distributed to his army
the bread prepared for his enemies, he began again the
next morning his march towards Lissa. General Zithen,
who led the vanguard of light horse, about seven in the
morning fell in with a body of Austrian hussars, and three
regiments of Saxon dragoons, which were the very best
cavalry the enemy had left after the battle of the twenty-second.
They had been detached by the Austrians, in
order to retard the King's march, and to conceal their own,
till their batteries should be completed; for, as they held
the small number of the Prussians in contempt, their in∣tention
was to have met the King two German miles from
their entrenchments. The Austrian cavalry having been
vigorously repulsed to a considerable distance, General
Zithen perceived that their whole army was forming.
He immediately acquainted the King with what he had
discovered, and his Majesty, after having himself observed
the disposition of the enemy, made his own with that sa∣gacity
and dispatch for which he has always been re∣markable.
The action began by attacking a battery of
forty pieces of large cannon, which covered the right wing
of the enemy. The two battalions of guards, with the
regiments of the Margrave Charles and of It zenplitz,
marched up, amidst a most terrible <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, to the very
mouths of the cannon, with their bayonets screwed. In
this attack the Prussians sustained their greatest loss, though
the battery was carried as soon almost as they could reach
it: then the enemy's artillery, now turned against them∣selves,
plaved furiously upon them with their own powder.
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
From that instant the two wings and the centre of the
Prussians continued to drive the enemy before them, ad∣vancing
all the time with that firm and regular pace for
which they have always been renowned, without ever
halting or giving way. The ground which the Austrians
occupied was very advantageous, and every circumstance
that could render it more so had been improved to the
utmost by the diligence and skill of Count Daun, who,
remembering his former success, was emboldened to enter
the lists again with his royal antagonist. The Prussians,
however, no way terrified by the enemy's situation, nor
their numbers, went calmly and dreadfully forward. It
was almost impossible, in the beginning, for the Prussian
cavalry to act, on account of the impediments of fallen
trees, which the enemy had cut down and laid in the field
of battle, to retard their approach; but a judicious dispo∣sition
which the King made overcame that disadvantage.
When he first formed his army, he had placed four bat∣talions
behind the cavalry of his right wing, foreseeing
that General Nadasti, who was placed with a corps of re∣serve
on the enemy's left, designed to take him in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lank.
It happened as he had foreseen, this general's horse at∣tacked
the King's right wing with great fury: but he
was received with so severe a fire from the four battalions,
that he was obliged to retire in disorder. The enemy
gave way on all sides, but at some distance recovered
themselves, and rallied three times, animated by their
officers, and by the superiority of their numbers. Every
time they made a stand, the Prussians attacked them with
redoubled vigour, and with success equal to their bravery.
Towards night, the enemy, still retreating, fell into dis∣order.
Their two wings fled in confusion; one of them,
closely pressed by the King, retired towards Breslau, and
took shelter under the cannon of that city; the other,
pursued by the greatest part of the light cavalry, took
their flight towards Canth and Schweidnitz. Six thou∣sand
Austrians sell in this engagement, and the Prussians,
who had only five hundred men killed, and two thousand
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
three hundred wounded, made upwards of ten thousand
of the enemy prisoners, among whom were two hundred
and ninety-one officers. They also took an hundred and
sixteen cannon, fifty-one colours and standards, and four
thousand waggons of ammunition and baggage. The
consequences that followed this victory declared its im∣portance.
Future ages will read with astonishment, that
the same prince, who but a few months before seemed on
the verge of inevitable ruin, merely by the dint of his own
abilities, without the assistance of any friend whatever,
with troops perpetually harrassed by long and painful
marches, and by continual skirmishes and battles, not only
retrieved his affairs, which almost every one except him∣self
thought past redress; but, in the midst of winter, in
countries where it was judged next to impossible for any
troops to keep the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield at that season, conquered the united
force of France and the Empire at Rosbach on the fifth of
November, and on the same day of the very next month,
with a great part of the same army, was at Lissa, where he
again triumphed over all the power of the house of Austria.
Pursuing his advantage, he immediately invested Breslau,
and within two days after this great victory every thing
was in readiness to besiege it in form. His troops, flushed
with success, were at first for storming it, but the King,
knowing the strength of the garrison, which consisted of
upwards of thirteen thousand men, and considering both
the fatigues which his own soldiers had lately undergone,
and the fatal consequences that might ensue, should they
fail of success in this attempt, ordered the approaches to
be carried on in the usual form. His commands were
obeyed, and Breslau surrendered to him on the twentieth
of December in the morning. The garrison, of which
ten thousand bore arms, and between three and four
thousand lay sick or wounded, were made prisoners of war.
Fourteen of these prisoners were officers of high rank.
The military chest, a vast treasure, with eighty pieces of
cannon, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell into the hands of the victors, who lost only
about twenty men in their approaches. During the siege, a
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
magazine of powder was set on sire by a bomb, which
occasioned great confusion among the besieged, and da∣maged
one of the bastions. The strong fortress of
Schweidnitz still remained in the enemy's possession, de∣fended
by a garrison so numerous, that it might be com∣pared
to a small army, and whilst that continued so, the
King of Prussia's victories in Silesia were of no decisive
effect. For this reason, though it was now the dead of
winter, and the soldiers stood in need of repose his Ma∣jesty
resolved, if possible, to become master of that place
before the end of the year; but as a close siege was im∣practicable,
a blockade was formed, as strictly as the rigour
of the season would permit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such was the rigour of the season, that some hundreds of the sentinels dropped down dead on their several polls, unable to sustain the severity of the cold. The Germans lie under the general reproach of paying very little regard to the lives of their soldiers, and indeed this practice of winter-campaigns in such a cold country bespeaks very little regard to the dictates of humanity</NOTE>. It was not, however, till
the beginning of the ensuing campaign that this place was
taken. The Prussians opened their trenches before it on
the third of April, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight,
and erected two large batteries, which kept a con∣tinual
fire upon the town. The artillery of the besiegers
consisted of three hundred pieces of cannon, of different
dimensions, and eighty mortars; an amazing artillery,
and such as we have never heard of in former campaigns.
On the night of the fourteenth, the Prussians carried
one of the chief works by assault, and lodged themselves
therein; the commandant capitulated the next day, with
the garrison, which was now greatly reduced in number,
being not half of what it amounted to at the beginning of
the blockade. Thus, all the parts of Silesia which the
King of Prussia had lost by one unfortunate blow fell again
into his possession; and his affairs, which but a few months
before seemed irretrievable, were now re-established upon
a firmer basis than ever. The Prussian parties not only
re-possessed themselves of those parts of Silesia which be∣longed
to their king, but penetrated into the Austrian di∣vision,
reduced Jagerndors, Troppau, Tretchen, and
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
several other places, and left the Empress-Queen scarce
any footing in that country, in which, a few days before,
she reckoned her dominion perfectly established.</P>
<P>§ XXI. The Swedes, after many debates between their
king and senate, had at length resolved upon an open
declaration against the King of Prussia, and, in conse∣quence
of that resolution, sent so many troops into Po∣merania,
that, by the end of August, their army in that
country amounted to twenty-five thousand men. Their
first act of hostility was the seisure of Anclam and Demmin,
two towns that lay in the way to Stetin, against which
their principal design was levelled. But before they
proceeded farther, General Hamilton, their commander,
by way of justifying the conduct of his master, published
a declaration, setting forth, “That the King of Sweden,
as guarantee of the treaty of Westphalia, could not help
sending his troops into the upper part of the duchy of
Pomerania belonging to the King of Prussia; and that,
therefore, all the officers appointed to receive the publick
revenue in that country must pay what money they had
in their hands to him, who was commissioned to receive
it for his Swedish Majesty: That, moreover, an exact
account was required, within eight days, of the reve∣nues
of the country; but that no more than ordinary
contributions would be demanded of the inhabitants,
who might rest assured that the Swedish troops should ob∣serve
the strictest discipline.” After this declaration they
attacked the little fortress of Penemunde, upon the river
Pene, and on the twenty-third of September, after
a siege of nine days, obliged the garrison, which
consisted only of militia, to surrender themselves
prisoners of war. This alternative the command∣ing
officer chose, rather than engage not to serve
for two years, observing, that such an engagement was
inconsistent with his honour, whilst his prince had so
much occasion for his service; and the Swedish general,
touched with this noble way of thinking, was, on his
part, so generous as to give him his liberty. On the
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
other hand, General Manteuffell, who commanded the
Prussian forces then in Pomerania, amounting to twelve
thousand men, with whom he was encamped before Ste∣tin,
to cover that place, published in answer to this a de∣claration,
enjoining the inhabitants of Pomerania to re∣main
faithful to the King of Prussia, their lawful sove∣reign,
under pain of incurring his just indignation, and
absolutely forbidding them to pay any regard to the Swe∣dish
manifesto.</P>
<P>§ XXII. In the mean time, Mareschal Lehwald, im∣mediately
after the battle of Norkitten, when the Russians
began their retreat, detached Prince George of Holstein-Gottorp,
with a considerable body of forces, to the re∣lief
of Pomerania; and, shortly after, the Russian forces
having totally evacuated every part of Prussia, except
Memel, and most of them being actually gone into
winter-quarters, he himself followed, with an additional
re-enforcement of sixteen thousand men. Upon his ap∣proach,
the Swedes, who were then encamped at Ferdi∣nandshoff,
and had begun to fill up the harbour of Swinne∣munde,
by way of previous preparation for the siege of
Stetin, retired with such precipitation, that they did not
allow themselves time to draw off a little garrison they
had at Wollin, consisting of two hundred and ten men,
who were made prisoners of war. Demmin was cannon∣aded
by the Prussians on the twenty-ninth of December;
and the Swedes having lost one officer and forty men, de∣sired
to capitulate. As, in order to case the troops, it was
not thought proper to continue the siege in so sharp a
season, their request was granted, and they had leave to
retire with two pieces of cannon. The Prussians took
possession of the town on the second day of January,
after the Swedes had, on the thirtieth of December, like∣wise
given up Anclam, where the conquerors took an
hundred and fifty prisoners, and found a considerable
magazine of provisions and ammunition. Mareschal
Lehwald then passed the Pene, entered Swedish Pome∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ania,
and reduced Gutz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, Loitz, Trips<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and Ne∣bringen.
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
At the same time, Lieutenant-General Schor∣lemmer
passed with his corps from the isle of Wollin into
the isle of Usedom, and from thence to Wolgast, the
Swedes having abandoned this town, as well as Schwine∣munde,
and the fort of Penemunde. The Prince of
Holstein advanced as far as Grimm and Gries<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swalde,
and the Swedes, losing one town after another, till they
had nothing lest in Pomerania but the port of Stral<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und,
continued retreating till they had reached this last place.
The French party in Sweden, to comfort the people,
called this retreat, or rather flight, going into winter-quarters.
The Prussian hussars were not idle wherever
they penetrated; for, besides plundering and pillaging,
they raised a contribution of an hundred and sixty thousand
crowns in Swedish Pomerania. The Mecklenburghers,
who had joined the Swedes with six thousand of their
troops, now found cause to repent of their forwardness,
being left quite exposed to the resentment of the victors,
who chastised them with the most severe exactions. The
army of the Swedes, though they did not fight a battle,
was, by sickness, desertion, and other accidents, reduced
to half the number it consisted of when they took the field.
The Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, soon after his territories
were invaded by the French, in consequence of their ad∣vantage
in the affair of Hastenbeck, had applied to the
King of Sweden, as one of the guarantees of the treaty
of Westphalia, desiring him to employ his good offices
with the court of France, to obtain a more favourable
treatment for his dominions: but his Swedish Majesty,
by the advice of the senate, thought proper to refuse com∣plying
with this request, alledging, that as the crown of
Sweden was one of the principal guarantees of the treaty
of Westphalia, it would be highly improper to take such a
step, in favour of a prince who had not only broke the laws
and constitutions of the empire, in refusing to furnish
his contingent, but had even assisted with his troops a
power known to be its declared enemy. The Aulick
council too, seeing, or pretending to see, the behaviour of
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
the Landgrave in the same light, issued a decree against
his Serene Highness towards the end of this year.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. The court of Great-Britain, justly displeased
with the Dutch, on account of the extreme facility with
which they had granted the French a free passage through
Namur and Maestricht for their provisions, ammunition,
and artillery, in the beginning of this campaign, had
very properly remonstrated against that step, before it was
absolutely resolved on, or at least declared to be so: but
in vain; a pusillanimous answer being all the satisfaction
that was obtained. The tameness and indifference with
which the States-General had since seen Ostend and Nieu∣port
put into the hands of the French drew upon their
High Mightinesses a further remonstance, which was
delivered to them on the twenty-eighth of November of this
year by Colonel Yorke, his Britannick Majesty's pleni∣potentiary
at the Hague, in the following terms, well
calculated to awaken in them a due sense of their own
danger, as well as to evince the injustice of the proceed∣ings
of the house of Austria:—“Considering the critical
situation which Europe has been in during the course of
this year, in consequence of measures concerted to embroil
all Europe, the King of Great-Britain was willing to
flatter himself that the courts of Vienna and Versailles,
out of regard to the circumspect conduct observed by your
High Mightinesses, would have at least informed you of
the changes they have thought proper to make in the
Austrian Netherlands. It was with the utmost surprise
the King heard, that without any previous consent of
your's, and almost without giving you any notice, the
court of Vienna had thought proper to put the towns of
Ostend and Nieuport into the hands of the French troops,
and to withdraw her own, as well as her artillery and
stores, whilst France continues to send thither a formidable
quantity of both. The conduct of the court of Vienna
towards his Majesty is indeed so unmerited and so ex∣traordinary,
that it is difficult to find words to express it:
but whatever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allacious pretexts she may have made use of
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
to palliate her behaviour towards England, it doth not
appear that it can be extended so far as to excuse the
infringement, in concert with France, of the most solemn
treaties between her and your High Mightinesses. The
King never doubted that your High Mightinesses would
have made proper representations to the two courts newly
allied, to demonstrate the injustice of such a proceeding,
and the danger that might afterwards result from it.
Your High Mightinesses will have perceived that your
silence on the first step encouraged the two courts, newly
allied, to attempt others; and who can say where they
will stop? The pretext at first was, the need which the
Empress-Queen stood in of the troops for the war kindled
in the empire, and the necessity of providing for the safety
of those important places, and afterwards of their imagi∣nary
danger from England. But, High and Mighty
Lords, it is but too evident that the two powers, who
have taken these measures in concert, have other projects
in view, and have made new regulations with regard to
that country, which cannot but alarm the neighbouring
states. The late demand made to your High Mightinesses,
of a passage for a large train of warlike implements through
some of the barrier towns, in order to be sent to Ostend
and Nieuport, could not fail to awaken the King's atten∣tion.
The sincere friendship, and parity of interests, of
Great-Britain and Holland require that they should no
longer keep silence, lest, in the issue, it should be consider∣ed
as a tacit consent, and as a relinquishment of all our
rights. The King commands me, therefore, to recall
to your High Mightinesses the two-fold right you have
acquired to keep the Austrian Netherlands under the go∣vernment
of the house of Austria; and that no other has
a title to make the least alteration therein, without the
consent of your High Mightinesses; unless the new allies
have resolved to set aside all prior treaties, and to dispose at
pleasure of every thing that may suit their private interest.
In the treaty between your High Mightinesses and the
crown of France, signed at Utrecht on the eleventh of
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
April, one thousand seven hundred and thirteen, in the
fifteenth article, are these words: 'It is also agreed,
that no province, fort, town, or city of the said Nether∣lands,
or of those which are given up by his Catholick
Majesty, shall ever be ceded, transferred, or given, or
shall ever devolve to the crown of France, or any prince
or princess of the house or line of France, either by
virtue of any gift, exchange, marriage-contract, suc∣cession
by will, or by any other title whatever, to the
power and authority of the Most Christian King, or of
any prince or princess of the house or line of France.
'In the barrier-treaty these very stipulations are repeated in
the first article: 'His Imperial and Catholick Majesty
promises and engages, that no province, city, town,
fortress, or territory of the said country shall be ceded,
transferred, given, or devolve to the crown of France,
or to any other but the successor of the German domi∣nions
of the House of Austria, either by donation, sale, ex∣change,
marriage-contract, heritage, testamentary suc∣cession,
nor under any other pretext whatsoever; so that
no province, town, fortress, or territory of the said Ne∣therlands
shall ever be subject to any other prince, but to
the successor of the states of the House of Austria alone,
excepting what has been yielded by the present treaty to
the said lords the States-General.' A bare reading of
these two articles is sufficient to evince all that I have just
represented to your High Mightinesses: and whatever pre∣text
the courts of Vienna and Versailles may alledge, to
cover the infraction of these treaties, the thing remains
nevertheless evident, whilst these two courts are unable to
prove that the towns of Ostend and Nieuport are not
actually in the power of France. If their designs are
just, or agreeable to those treaties, they will doubtless
not scruple, in the least, to make your High Mightinesses
easy on that head, by openly explaining themselves to a
quiet and pacifick neighbour, and by giving you indis∣putable
proofs of their intentions to fulfil the stipulations
of the said two treaties, with regard to the Netherlands.
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
The King hath so much confidence in the good sense,
prudence and friendship of your High Mightinesses, that
he makes not the least doubt of your taking the most effi∣cacious
measures to clear up an affair of such importance;
and of your being pleased, in concert with his Majesty,
to watch over the fate of a country, whose situation and
independence have, for more than a century, been re∣garded
as one of the principal supports of your liberty and
commerce.” It does not appear that this remonstrance had
the desired effect upon the States-General, who were ap∣prehensive
of embroiling themselves with an enemy so re∣markably
alert in taking all advantages. The truth is,
they were not only unprepared for a rupture with France,
but extremely unwilling to forego the commercial profits
which they derived from their neutrality.</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The King of Prussia, about this period, began to
harbour a suspicion that certain other powers longed eager∣ly
to enjoy the same respite from the dangers and inconve∣niencies
of war, and that he ran the risque of being abandon∣ed
by his sole patron and ally, who seemed greatly alarmed
at his defeat in Bohemia, and desirous of detaching himself
from a connexion which might be productive of the most dis∣agreeable
consequences to his continental interest. Stimulat∣ed
by this opinion, his Prussian Majesty is said to have writ∣ten
an expostulatory letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<P>The letter, which was written in French, we have translated, for the reader's satisfaction.</P>
<P>“I am informed that the design of a treaty of neutrality for the electo∣rate of H—r is not yet laid aside. Is it possible that your M—y can have so little fortitude and constancy, as to be dispirited by a small reverse of fortune? Are affairs so ruinous, that they cannot be repaired! I hope your M—y will consider the step you have made me hazard, and rem∣ber that you are the sole cause of these misfortunes that now impend over my head. I should never have abandoned the alliance of France, but for your flattering assurances. I do not now repent of the treaty I have concluded with your M—y; but I expect you will not ingloriously leave me at the mercy of my enemies, after having brought upon me all the force of Europe. I depend upon your adhering to your repeated engagements of the twenty-sixth of last month, and that you will listen to no treaty in which I am not comprehended.”</P>
</LETTER></NOTE> to the K—of G—B—,
in which he very plainly taxes that monarch with having
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
instigated him to commence hostilities; and insists upon
his remembering the engagements by which he was so
solemnly bound. From the strain of this letter, and the
Prussian's declaration to the British minister when he first
set out for Saxony, importing, that he was going to
fight the King of England's battles, a notion was gene∣rally
conceived that those two powers had agreed to
certain private pacta or conventions, the particulars
of which have not yet transpired. Certain it is, a decla∣ration
was delivered to the Prussian resident at London,
which appears to have been calculated as an answer to the
letter. In that paper the King of Great-Britain declared,
that the overtures made by his Majesty's electoral mini∣sters
in Germany, touching the checks received on the
continent, should have no influence on his Majesty as
king: that he saw in the same light as before the per∣nicious
effects of the union between the courts of Vienna
and Versailles, threatening a subversion of the whole
system of publick liberty, and of the independence of the
European powers: that he considered as a fatal conse∣quence
of this dangerous connexion the cession made by
the court of Vienna of the ports in the Netherlands to
France, in such a critical situation, and contrary to the
faith of the most solemn treaties: that whatever might
be the success of his arms, his Majesty was determined to
act in constant concert with the King of Prussia in em∣ploying
the most efficacious means to frustrate the unjust
and oppressive designs of their common enemies. He con∣cluded
with assuring the King of Prussia that the Bri∣tish
crown would continue to fulfil, with the greatest
punctuality, its engagements with his Prussian Majesty,
and to support him with firmness and vigour. Such a
representation could not sail of being agreeable to a prince,
who, at this juncture, stood in need of an extraordinary
cordial. He knew he could securely depend not only
on the good faith of an English ministry, but also on the
good plight of the British nation, which like an indulgent
nurse hath always presented the nipple to her meagre
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
German allies. Those, however, who pretended to con∣sider and canvass events without prejudice and pre∣possession,
could not help owning their surprise, at hear∣ing
an alliance stigmatised as pernicious to the system of
public liberty, and subversive of the independence of the
European powers, as they remembered that this alliance
was the effect of necessity, to which the house of Austria
was reduced, for its own preservation; reduced, as its
friends and partisans affirm, by those very potentates, that
now reproached her with these connexions.</P>
<P>§ XXV. His B—M—was resolved that the
King of Prussia should have no cause to complain of his
indifference, whatever reasons he had to exclaim against
the convention of Closter-Seven, which he did not scruple
to condemn as a very scandalous capitulation, as much as
he disapproved of the conduct, in consequence of which
near forty thousand men were so shamefully disarmed,
and lost to his cause. Those stipulations also met with a
very unfavourable reception in England, where the
motions of the allied army in their retreat before the
enemy were very freely censured, and some great names
exposed to the ridicule and contempt of the publick.
This event, so singular in itself, and so important in its
consequences, attracted the attention of the privy-council,
where it is said to have been canvassed with great warmth
and animosity of altercation. The g—l complained
that he was restricted by peremptory orders from the re∣gency
of H—; and they were reported to have used
recriminations in their defence. In all probability, every
circumstance of the dispute was not explained to the satis∣faction
of all parties, inasmuch as that great commander
quitted the harvest of military glory, and, like another
Cincinnatus, retired to his plough. The convention of
Closter-Seven was equally disagreeable to the courts of
London and Versailles. The former saw the electorate of
Hanover left, by this capitulation, at the mercy of the
enemy, who had taken possession of the whole country,
seised the revenues, exacted contributions, and changed
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
the whole form of government, in the name of his Most
Christian Majesty: while the French army, which had
been employed in opposing the Havoverians, was now at
liberty to throw their additional force into the scale against
the King of Prussia, who, at that period, seemed to totter
on the verge of destruction. On the other hand, the
French ministry thought their general had granted too
favourable terms to a body of forces, whom he had
cooped up in such a manner, that, in a little time, they
must have surrendered at discretion. They, therefore,
determined either to provoke the Hanoverians by ill-usage
to an infraction of the treaty, or should that be
found impracticable, renounce it as an imperfect con∣vention,
established without proper authority. Both ex∣pedients
were used without reserve. They were no sooner
informed of the capitulation, than they refused to ac∣knowledge
its validity, except on condition that the
Hanoverian troops should formally engage to desist from
all service against France and her allies during the present
war, and be disarmed on their return to their own coun∣try.
At the same time her general, who commanded in
the electorate, exhausted the country, by levying exorbi∣tant
contributions, and connived at such outrages as de∣graded
his own dignity, and reflected disgrace on the
character of his nation. The court of London, to make
a merit of necessity, affected to consider the conventional
act as a provisional armistice, to pave the way for a ne∣gociation
that might terminate in a general peace, and
proposals were offered for that purpose: but the French
ministry kept aloof, and seemed resolved that the electorate
of Hanover should be annexed to their king's dominions.
At least, they were bent upon keeping it as a precious
depositum, which, in the plan of a general pacification,
they imagined, would counterbalance any advantage
that Great-Britain might obtain in other parts of the
world. Had they been allowed to keep this deposit, the
kingdom of Great-Britain would have saved about twenty
millions of money, together with the lives of her best
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
soldiers; and Westphalia would have continued to enjoy
all the blessings of security and peace. But the King of
England's tenderness for Hanover was one of the chief
sources of the misfortunes which befell that electo∣rate.
He could not bear the thoughts of seeing it, even
for a season, in the hands of the enemy; and his own
sentiments in this particular were re-enforced by the
pressing remonstrances of the P—n monarch, whom, at
this juncture, he thought it dangerous to disoblige. Actu∣ated
by these motives, he was pleased to see the articles of
the convention so palpably contravened, because the vio∣lation
unbound his hands, and enabled him, consistently
with good faith, to take effectual steps for the assistance
of his ally, and the recovery of his own dominions. He,
therefore, in quality of Elector of Brunswick-Lunenbourg,
published a declaration, observing, “That his Royal High∣ness
the Duke of Cumberland had, on his part, honestly
fulfilled all the conditions of the convention; but the
Duke de Richelieu demanded that the troops should enter
into an engagement specified above, and lay down their
arms; although it was expressly stipulated in the con∣vention
that they should not be regarded as prisoners
of war, under which quality alone they could be dis∣armed:
that the French court pretended to treat the
convention as a military regulation only; and, indeed,
it was originally nothing more: but as they had ex∣pressly
disowned its validity, and a negociation had
been actually begun for disarming the auxiliaries, upon
certain conditions, though the French general would
never answer categorically, but waited always for fresh
instructions from Versailles, the nature of that act was
totally changed, and what was at first an agreement be∣tween
general and general was now become a matter of
state between the two courts of London and Versailles:
that, however hard the conditions of the convention
appeared to be for the troops of Hanover, his Britannick
Majesty would have acquieseed in them, had not the
French glaringly discovered their design of totally ruining
his army, and his dominions; and, by the most outrageous
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
conduct, freed his Britannick Majesty from every obli∣gation
under which he had been laid by the convention:
that in the midst of the armistice the most open hostili∣ties
had been committed: the caste of Schartzfeis had
been forcibly seised and pillaged, and the garrison made
prisoners of war: the prisoners made by the French before
the convention had not been restored, according to an
express article stipulated between the generals, though it
had been fulfilled on the part of the electorate, by the im∣mediate
release of the French prisoners; the bailies of those
districts from which the French troops were excluded by
mutual agreement had been summoned, on pain of mili∣tary
execution, to appear before the French commissary,
and compelled to deliver into his hands the publick reve∣nue:
the French had appropriated to themselves part of
those magazines which, by express agreement, were
destined for the use of the electoral troops; and they had
seised the houses, revenue, and corn belonging to the
King of England in the city of Bremen, in violation of
their engagement to consider that city as a place absolutely
free and neutral. He took notice that they had proceeded
to menaces unheard of among civilised people, of burning,
sacking, and destroying every thing that fell in their way,
should the least hesitation be made in executing the con∣vention
according to their interpretation.”—Such were the
professed considerations that determined his Britannick
Majesty to renounce the agreement which they had vio∣lated,
and have recourse to arms for the relief of his sub∣jects
and allies. It was in consequence of this determi∣nation
that he conferred the command of his electoral
army on Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, brother to the
duke of that name, who had distinguished himself in the
Prussian army by his great military talents, and was, by
blood and inclination, as well as interest, supposed warmly
attached to his Britannick Majesty. The truth is, the
K—g of P—a recommended him to this command,
because he knew he could depend upon his concurring
with all his measures, in conducting the operations of the
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
British army. The Duke de Richelieu was no sooner in∣formed
of these particulars, than he sent a letter to Prince
Ferdinand, specifying, “That although for some days he
had perceived the Hanoverian troops in motion, in order to
form themselves into a body, he could not imagine the
object of these movements was to infringe the convention
of neutrality which had been established between the Duke
of Cumberland and himself, as French general; that he
was blinded so far by his confidence in the good faith of
the Elector of Hanover, who had signed that convention,
as to believe the troops were assembled for no other purpose
than to be distributed into winter-quarters, which had been
assigned them by the agreement; but his eyes were at last
opened, by repea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed advices, which he had received from
all quarters, importing, that the Hanoverians intended
to infringe those articles which ought to be sacred and in∣violable:
he affirmed, the King his master was still willing
to give fresh proofs of his moderation, and his desire to
spare the effusion of human blood: with that view he de∣clared
to his Serene Highness, in the name of his Most
Christian Majesty, that he persisted in his resolution of
fulfilling exactly all the points of the convention, pro∣vided
they should be equally observed by the Hanoverian
army; but he could not help apprising his Serene Highness
that if his army should take any equivocal step, and, still
more, should it commit any act of hostility, he would
then push matters to the last extremity, looking upon
himself as authorised so to do by the rules of war: that
he would set fire to all the palaces, houses, and gardens;
sack all the towns and villages, without sparing the most
inconsiderable cottage, and subject the country to all the
horrors of war and devestation. He conjured his Serene
Highness to reflect on these particulars, and begged he
would not lay him under the necessity of taking steps so
contrary to his own personal character, as well as to the
natural humanity of the French nation.” To this letter,
which was seconded by the Count de Lynar, the Danish
ambassador, who had meditated the convention, Prince
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
Ferdinand returned a very laconick answer, intimating,
that he would give the Duke de Richelieu his answer in
person at the head of his army. At this particular junc∣ture,
the French general was disposed to abide by the
original articles of the convention, rather than draw up∣on
himself the hostilities of an army which he knew to
be brave, resolute, and well appointed, and which he saw
at present animated with an eager desire of wiping out the
disgrace they had sustained by the capitulation, as well as
of relieving their country from the grievous oppression
under which it groaned.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. About the latter end of November the Hano∣verian
army was wholly assembled at Stade, under the
auspices of Prince Ferdinand, who resolved, without de∣lay,
to drive the French from the electorate, whither
they now began their march. Part of the enemy's rear,
consisting of two thousand men, was, in their march back
to Zell, attacked in the bailiwick of Ebstorff, and entirely
defeated by General Schuylenbourg; and, in a few
days after this action, another happened upon the river
Aller, between two considerable bodies of each army, in
which the Hanoverians, commanded by General Zastrow,
remained masters of the field. These petry advantages
served to encourage the allies, and put them in possession
of Lunenbourg, Zell, and part of the Brunswick do∣minions,
which the enemy were obliged to abandon.
The operations of Prince Ferdinand, however, were re∣tarded
by the resolution and obstinate perseverance of the
French officer who commanded the garrison of Harbourg.
When the Hanoverian troops made themselves masters of
the town, he retired into the castle, which he held out
against a considerable detachment of the allied army, by
whom it was invested; at length, however, the sortifi∣cations
being entirely demolished, he surrendered upon
capitulation. On the sixth day of December Prince Ferdi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and
began his march towards Zell, where the French
army had taken post, under the command of the Duke de
Ricelieu, who, at the approach of the Hanoverians,
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
called in his advanced parties, abandoned several maga∣zines,
burned all the farm-houses and buildings belonging
to the sheep walks of his Britannick Majesty, without pay∣ing
the least regard to the representations made by Prince
Ferdinand on this subject; reduced the suburbs of Zell
to ashes, after having allowed his men to plunder the
houses, and even set fire to the Orphan-hospital, in which
a great number of helpless children are said to have peri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ed.
One cannot, without horrour, reflect upon such brutal
acts of inhumanity. The French troops on divers occa∣sions,
and in different parts of the empire, acted tragedies
of the same nature, which are not easily reconcileable to
the character of a nation famed for sentiment and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.
The Hanoverians having advanced within a league of
Zell, the two armies began to cannonade each other; the
French troops posted on the right of the Aller burned
their magazines, and retired into the town, where they
were so strongly entrenched, that Prince Ferdinand could
not attempt the river, the passes of which were strongly
guarded by the enemy. At the same time, his troops
were exposed to great hardships from the severity of the
weather; he, therefore, retreated to Ultzen and Lunen∣bourg,
where his army was put into winter-quarters, and
executed several small enterprises by detachment, while
the French general fixed his head-quarters in the city of
Hanover, his cantonments extending as far as Zell, in the
neighbourhood of which many sharp skirmishes were
sought from the out-parties with various success. Their Im∣perial
Majesties were no sooner apprised of these transac∣tions,
which they considered as infractions of the conven∣tion,
than they sent an intimation to the Baron de Stein∣berg,
minister from the King of Great-Britain as Elector of
Hanover, that he should appear no more at court, or con∣fer
with their ministers; and that his residing at Vienna,
as he might easily conceive, could not be very agreeable:
in consequence of which message he retired, after having
obtained the necessary passports for his departure. The
chagrin occasioned at the court of Vienna by the Hano∣verian
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
army's having recourse to their arms again was, in
some measure, alleviated by the certain tidings received
from Petersburgh, that the Czarina had signed her acces∣sion
in form to the treaty between the courts of Vienna,
Versailles, and Stockholm.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. In closing our account of this year's
transactions on the continent, we may observe, that on
the sixteenth day of November the Queen of Poland died
at Berlin of an apoplexy, supposed to be occasioned by
the shock she received on hearing that the French were
totally defeated at Rosbach. She was a lady of exemplary
virtue and piety, whose constitution had been broke by
grief and anxiety conceived from the distress of her own
family, as well as from the misery to which she saw her
people exposed. With respect to the European powers
that were not actually engaged as principals in the war,
they seemed industriously to avoid every step that might
be construed a deviation from the most scrupulous neutra∣lity.
The States-General proceeded with great circum∣spection,
in the middle course between two powerful
neighbours, equally jealous and formidable; and the King
of Spain was gratified for his forbearance with a convention
settled between him and the belligerent powers, imply∣ing,
that his subjects should pursue their commerce at
sea without molestation, provided they should not trans∣port
those articles of merchandise which were deemed
contraband by all nations.—The operations at sea,
during the course of this year, either in Europe or Ame∣rica,
were far from being decisive or important. The
commerce of Great-Britain sustained considerable damage
from the activity and success of French privateers, of
which a great number had been equipped in the islands
of Martinique and Guadaloupe. The Greenwich ship of
war, mounted with fifty guns, and a srigate of twenty,
fell into the hands of the enemy, together with a very
considerable number of trading vessels. On the other
hand, the English cruisers and privateers acquirted them∣selves
with equal vigilance and valour. The Due d'Ac∣uitaine,
a large ship of fifty guns, was taken in the
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
month of June by two British ships of war, after a severe
engagement; and, about the same time, the Aquilon, of
nearly the same force, was driven on shore and destroyed
near Brest by the Antelope, one of the British cruisers.
A French frigate of twenty-six guns, called the Emeraude,
was taken in the channel, after a warm engagement, by
an English ship of inferior force, under the command of
Captain Gilchrist, a gallant and alert officer, who, in the
sequel, signalised himself on divers occassions, by very ex∣traordinary
acts of valour. All the sea-officers seemed to
be animated with a noble emulation to distinguish them∣selves
in the service of their country, and the spirit de∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended
even to the captains of privateers, who, instead of
imitating the former commanders of that class, in avoid∣ing
ships of force, and centering their whole attention in
advantageous prizes, now encountered the armed ships of
the enemy, and fought with the most obstinate valour in
the pursuit of national glory.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. Perhaps history cannot afford a more re∣markable
instance of desperate courage than that which
was exerted in December of the preceding year, by the
officers and crew of an English privateer, called the Ter∣rible,
under the command of Captain William Death,
equipped with twenty-six carriage-guns, and manned
with two hundred sailors. On the twenty-third day of
the month he engaged and made prize of a large French
ship from St. Domingo, after an obstinate battle, in which
he lost his own brother and sixteen seamen: then he
secured with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orty men his prize, which contained a
valuable cargo, and directed his course to England, but in
a few days he had the misfortune to fall in with the Ven∣geance,
a privateer of St. Malos, carrying thirty-six large
cannon, with a complement of three hundred and sixty
men. Their first step was to attack the prize, which
was easily re-taken; then the two ships bore down upon
the Terrible, whose main-mast was shot away by the first
broadside. Notwithstanding this disaster, the Terrible
maintained such a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urious engagement against both <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
can hardly be parallelled in the annals of Britain. The
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
French commander and his second were killed, with two
thirds of his company; but the gallant Captain Death,
with the greater part of his officers, and almost his whole
crew, having met with the same fate, his ship was boarded
by the enemy, who found no more than twenty-six per∣sons
alive, sixteen of whom were mutilated by the loss of
leg or arm, and the other ten grievously wounded. The
ship itself was so shattered, that it could scarce be kept
above water, and the whole exhibited a scene of blood,
horrour, and desolation. The victor itself lay like a wreck
on the surface; and in this condition made shift, with
great difficulty, to tow the Terrible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a strange combination of names belonging to this privateer, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Terrible, equipped at Execution-Dock, commanded by Captain Death, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ose lieutenant was called Devil, and who had one Ghost for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urgeon.</NOTE> into St. Malos,
where she was not beheld without astonishment and ter∣rour.
This adventure was no sooner known in England,
than a liberal subscription was raised for the support of
Death's widow, and that part of the crew which survived
the engagement. In this, and every sea-rencounter that
happened within the present year, the superiority in skill
and resolution was ascertained to the British mariners; for
even when they fought against great odds, their courage
was generally crowned with success. In the month of
November, Captain Lockhart, a young gentleman, who
had already rendered himself a terrour to the enemy as
commander of a small frigate, now added considerably to
his reputation, by reducing the Melampe, a French priva∣teer,
of Bayonne, greatly superior to his own ship in num∣ber
of men and weight of metal. This exploit was se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onded
by another of the same nature, in his conquest of
another French adventurer, called the Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of Gra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nont;
and a third large privateer of Bayonne was taken
by Captain Saumarez, commander of the Antelope. In <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
word, the narrow seas were so well guarded, that in a
little time scarce a French ship durst appear in the English
channel, which the British traders navigated without
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olestation.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="210"/>
§ XXIX. On the first day of December, the King of
Great-Britain opened the session of parliament with a
speech from the throne, which seemed calculated to pre∣pare
the nation for the expense of maintaining a new war
on the continent of Europe. His Majesty graciously
declared, that it would have given him a most sensible
pleasure to acquaint them, at the opening of the session,
that his success in carrying on the war had been equal to
the justice of his cause, and the extent and vigour of the
measures formed for that purpose. He expressed the firmest
confidence, that the spirit and bravery of the nation, so
renowned in all times, which had formerly surmounted
so many difficulties, were not to be abated by a few dis∣appointments,
which, he trusted, might be retrieved by
the blessing of God, and the zeal and ardour of his par∣liament
for his Majesty's honour and the advantage of
their country. He said it was his determined resolution to
apply his utmost efforts for the security of his kingdoms,
and for the recovery and protection of the possessions and
rights of his crown and subjects in America, and elsewhere,
as well by the strongest exertion of his naval force, as by
all other methods. He signified, that another great object
which he had at heart, was the preservation of the pro∣testant
religion, and the liberties of Europe; and, in that
view, to encourage and adhere to his allies. For this cause,
he assured them, he would decline no inconveniencies, and
in this cause he earnestly sollicited their hearty concur∣rence
and vigorous assistance. He observed, that the late
signal success in Germany had given a happy turn to
affairs, which it was incumbent on them to improve;
and that, in such a critical conjuncture, the eyes of all
Europe were upon them. He particularly recommended
to them, that his good brother and ally the King of Prussia
might be supported in such a manner as his magnanimity
and active zeal for the common cause appeared to deserve.
To the Commons he expressed his concern that the large
supplies they had already granted did not produce all the
good fruits they had reason to expect; but he had to great
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="209" REF="212"/>
reliance on their wisdom, as not to doubt of their perse∣verance.
He only desired such supplies as should be
necessary for the publick service, and told them they might
depend upon it, that the best and most faithful oeconomy
should be used. He took notice of that spirit of disorder
which had shown itself among the common people in
some parts of the kingdom he laid injunctions upon them
to use their endeavours for discouraging and suppressing
such abuses, and for maintaining the laws and lawful
authority. He concluded with observing, that nothing
would so effectually conduce to the defense of all that was
dear to the nation, as well as to the reducing their enemies
to reason, as union and harmony among themselves. The
time was when every paragraph of this harangue, which
the reader will perceive is not remarkable for its elegance
and propriety, would have been canvassed and impugned
by the country party in the House of Commons. They
would have imputed the bad success of the war to the indis∣cretion
of the ministry, in taking preposterous measures,
and appointing commanders unequal to the service▪ They
would have enquired in what manner the protestant re∣ligion
was endangered; and, if it was, how it could be
preserved or promoted by adhering to allies, who, without
provocation, had well nigh ruined the first and principal
protestant country of the Empire. They would have
started doubts with respect to the late signal success in
Germany, and hinted, that it would only serve to pro∣tract
the burthen of a continental war. They would have
owned that the eyes of all Europe were upon them, and
drawn this consequence, that it therefore behoved them to
act with the more delicacy and caution in discharge of the
sacred trust reposed in them by their constituents: a trust
which their consciences would not allow to be faithfully
discharged, should they rush precipitately into the de∣structive
measures of a rash and prodigal ministry, squander
away the wealth of the nation, and add to the grievous
incumbrances under which it groaned, in support of con∣nexions
and alliances that were equally foreign to her
consideration, and pernicious to her interest. They would
<PB N="209" REF="213"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="210" REF="214"/>
have investigated that cause which was so warmly recom∣mended
for support, and pretended to discover that it was a
cause in which Great-Britain ought to have had no con∣cern,
because it produced a certainty of loss without the
least prospect of advantage. They would have varied
essentially in their opinions of the necessary supplies, from
the sentiments of those who prepared the estimates, and
even declared some doubts about the oeconomy to be used
in managing the national expense; finally, they would
have represented the impossibility of union between the two
parties, one of which seemed bent upon reducing the other
to beggary and contempt. Such was the strain that used
to flow from an opposition, said to consist of disloyalty and
disappointed ambition. But that malignant spirit was now
happily extinguished. The voice of the sovereign was ador∣ed
as the oracle of a divinity, and those happy days were now
approaching that saw the Commons of England pour their
treasures, in support of a German prince, with such a ge∣nerous
hand, that posterity will be amazed at their liberality.</P>
<P>§ XXX. To the speech of his Majesty the House of
Lords returned an address,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> in such terms of complacency
as had long distinguished that illustrious assembly. The
Commons expressed their approbation and confidence with
equal ardour, and not one objection was made to the form
or nature of the address, though one gentleman, equally
independent in his mind and fortune, took exceptions to
some of the measures which had been lately pursued.
Their complaisance was more substantially specified in the
resolutions of the House, as soon as the two great com∣mittees
of supply were appointed. They granted for the
sea service of the ensuing year sixty thousand men, in∣cluding
fourteen thousand eight hundred and forty-five
marines, and the standing army, comprehending four
thousand invalids, was fixed at fifty-three thousand seven
hundred and seventy-seven effective men, commission and
non-commission officers included. For the maintenance
of these forces, by sea and land, the charge of guards and
garrisons at home and abroad, the expense of the Ordnance,
and in order to make good the sum which had been issued
<PB N="211" REF="215"/>
by his Majesty's orders, in pursuance of the address from
the Commons, they now allotted four millions, twenty-two
thousand, eight hundred and seven pounds, seven
shillings, and three-pence. They unanimously granted,
as a present supply in the then critical exigency, towards
enabling his Majesty to maintain and keep together the
army formed last year in his electoral dominions, and then
again put in motion, and actually employed against the
common enemy, in concert with the King of Prussia,
the sum of one hundred thousand pounds: for the ordinary
of the navy, including half pay to the sea officers, they
allowed two hundred twenty-four thousand, four hundred
twenty-one pounds, five shillings, and eight-pence: to∣wards
the building and support of the three hospitals for
seamen at Gosport, Plymouth, and Greenwich thirty
thousand pounds: for the reduced officers of the land∣forces
and marines, pensions to the widows of officers, and
other such military contingencies, forty thousand nine
hundred and twenty-six pounds, seventeen shillings, and
eleven-pence: towards building, re-building, and repairs
of his Majesty's ships for the ensuing year, the sum of two
hundred thousand pounds: for defraying the charge of
two thousand one hundred and twenty horse, and nine
thousand nine hundred infantry, together with the general
and staff officers, the officers of the hospital and the train
of artillery, being the troops of the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel
in the pay of Great-Britain, for sixty days, together
with the subsidy for the said time, pursuant to treaty,
they assigned thirty-eight thousand three hundred and sixty
pounds, nineteen shillings, and ten-pence three farthings.
To the Foundling-hospital they gave forty thousand
pounds, for the maintenance and education of deserted
young children, as well as for the reception of all such as
should be presented under a certain age, to be limited by
the governors and guardians of that charity. Three hun∣dred
thousand pounds were given towards discharging the
debt of the navy, and two hundred eighty-four thousand
eight hundred and two pounds for making up the deficiency
<PB N="212" REF="216"/>
of the grants for the service of the preceding year. The
Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel was, moreover, gratified with
the further sum of two hundred and three thousand five
hundred and thirty-six pounds, four shillings, and nine∣pence
farthing, for the maintenance of his forces, and the
remainder of his subsidy. They granted six hundred and
seventy thousand pounds for enabling his Majesty to make
good his engagements with the King of Prussia, pursuant
to a convention lately concluded with that potentate.
For defraying the charge of thirty-eight thousand men of
the troops of Hanover, Wolfenbuttel, Saxe-Gotha, and
the Count of Buckbourg, together with that of general
and staff-officers actually employed against the common
enemy, in concert with the King of Prussia, from the
twenty-eighth day of November in the last, to the twenty-fourth
of December in the present year inclusive, to be
issued in advance every two months, they allotted the sum
of four hundred and sixty-three thousand eighty-four
pounds, six shillings, and ten-pence; and furthermore
they granted three hundred eighty-six thousand, nine
hundred and fifteen pounds, thirteen shillings, and two-pence,
to defray the charges of forage, bread-waggons,
train of artillery, provisions, wood, straw, and all other
extraordinary expenses, contingencies, and losses what∣soever,
incurred, or to be incurred, on account of
his Majesty's army, consisting of thirty-eight thousand
men, actually employed against the common enemy,
in concert with the King of Prussia, from November
last to next December inclusive. For the extraordi∣nary
expenses of the land-forces, and other services, in∣curred
in the course of the last year, and not provided for
by parliament, they allowed one hundred forty-five thou∣sand,
four hundred fifty-four pounds, fifteen shillings, and
one farthing. They provided eight hundred thousand
pounds to enable his Majesty to defray the like sum raised
in pursuance of an act made in the last session of parliament,
and charged upon the first aids and supplies to be granted
in the current session. Twenty-six thousand pounds were
<PB N="213" REF="217"/>
bestowed on the out-pensioners of Chelsea-hospital; above
twenty thousand for the expense of maintaining the colo∣nies
of Nova-Scotia and Georgia; for reimbursing to the
province of Massachuset's-Bay, and the colony of Con∣necticut,
their expense in furnishing provisions and stores
to the troops raised by them, for his Majesty's service, in
the campaign of the year one thousand seven hundred and
fifty-six, the sum of forty-one thousand, one hundred,
seventeen pounds, seventeen shillings, and six-pence half-penny;
to be applied towards the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> building of London-bridge,
carrying on the works for fortifying and securing
the harbour of Milford, and repairing the parish-church of
St. Margaret, in Westminster, they allotted twenty-nine
thousand pounds. The East-India company were in∣dulged
with twenty thousand pounds upon account, to∣wards
enabling them to defray the expense of a military
force in their settlements, to be maintained by them in
lieu of the battalion of his Majesty's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces withdrawn
from those settlements: the sum of ten thousand pounds
was given, as usual, for maintaining and supporting the
British forts and settlements on the coast of Africa; and
eleven thousand four hundred and fifty were granted as an
augmentation to the salaries of the judges in the superior
courts of judicature. They likewise provided one hundred
thousand pounds for defraying the charge of pay and cloth∣ing
to the militia, and advanced eight hundred thousand
pounds, to enable his Majesty to desray any extraordinary
expenses of the war, incurred or to be incurred for the
service of the current year; and to take all such measures
as might be necessary to disappoint or defeat any enter∣prises
or designs of his enemies, as the exigency of his
affairs might require. The whole supplies of this session
amounted to the enormous sum of ten millions, four hun∣dred
eighty-six thousand, four hundred fifty-seven pounds,
and one penny. Nothing could so plainly demonstrate
the implicit confidence which the parliament, at this
juncture, reposed in the sovereign and the ministry, as
their conduct in granting such liberal supplies, great part
<PB N="214" REF="218"/>
of which were bestowed in favour of our German allies,
whom the British nation thus generously paid for fight∣ing
their own battles. Besides the sum of one million,
eight hundred sixty-one thousand, eight hundred ninety-seven
pounds, four shillings, and eight-pence, expres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly
assigned for the support of these continental connexions,
a sum considerably exceeding the whole of the revenue
raised in the reign of Charles the Second, and what part of
the sum granted to the King for extraordinary expenses
might be applied to the same use, the article might not
improperly be swelled with the vast expense incurred by
expeditions to the coast of France, the chief, if not sole
design of which seemed to be a diversion in favour of the
nation's allies in Germany, by preventing France from
sending such numerous armies into that country as it
could have spared, had not its sea-coasts required a consi∣derable
body of forces for its defense against the attempts
of the English. Indeed, the partians of the ministry were
at great pains to suggest and inculcate a belief, that the war
in Germany was chiefly supported as a necessary divernon
in favour of Great-Britain and her plantations, which
would have been exposed to insult and invasion, had not
the enemy's forces been otherwise employed. But the
absurdity of this notion will at once appear to those who
consider, that by this time Great-Britain was sole <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of the sea; that the navy of France was almost r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined,
and her commerce on the ocean quite extinguished; that
she could not, with the least prospect of success, hazard
any expedition of consequence against Great-Britain, or
any part of her dominions, while the ocean was covered
with such powerful navies belonging to that nation; and
that if one third part of the money annually <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
the German vortex, had been employed in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the naval forces of England, and those forces properly ex∣erted,
not a single cruiser would have been able to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
the harbours of France; all her colonies in the West-Indies
would have fallen an easy prey to the arms of Great-Britain;
and thus cut off from the resources of comme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce,
<PB N="215" REF="219"/>
she must have been content to embrace such terms of peace
as the victor should have thought proper to prescribe.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. The funds established by the committee of
ways and means, in order to realise those articles of supply,
consisted of the malt-tax, the land tax at four shillings in
the pound, sums remaining in the Exchequer produced from
the sinking fund, four millions five hundred thousand pounds,
to be raised by annuities, at three pounds ten shillings per
cent. per ann. and five hundred thousand pounds by a lot∣tery,
attended with annuities redeemable by parliament, after
the rate of three pounds per cent. per ann. these several an∣nuities
to be transferrable at the Bank of England, and
charged upon a fund to be established in this session of parlia∣ment
for payment thereof, and for which the sinking fund
should be a collateral security<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was enacted, That every person subscribing for five hundred pounds should be entitled to four hundred and fifty in annuities, and fifty pounds in lottery tickets, and so in proportion for a greater or lesser sum; that the lottery should consist of tickets of the value of ten pounds each, in a proportion not exceeding eight blanks to a prize; the blanks to be of the value of six pounds each, the blanks and prizes to bear an interest after the rate of three pounds per cent. to commence from the first day of January, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine; and that the sum of four millions, five hundred thousand pounds, to be raised by annuities, should bear an interest after the rate of three pounds ten shillings per cent. from the fifth day of July, in the present year, which annuities should stand reduced to three pounds per cent. after the expiration of twenty-four years, and afterwards be redeemable in the whole, or in part by sums n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t less than five hundred thousand pounds at one time, six months notice having been first given of such payments re∣spectively; that any subscriber might, on or before the twenty-ninth day of April, make a deposit of ten pounds per cent. on such sum as he should choose to subscribe towards raising these five millions, with the cashiers of the Bank, as a security for his future payment to on the days appointed for that purpose; that the several sums so received by the cashiers should be paid into the receipt of the Exchequer, to be applied from time to time to such services as should then have been voted by the House of Commons in this session of parliament, and not otherwise: that any subscriber paying the whole or any part of his subscription previous to the days appointed for the respective payments should be allowed a discount, at the rate of three per cent. from the days of such re∣spective payments to the respective times on which such payments were di∣rected to be made, and that all persons who should make their full payments on the said lottery should receive their tickets as soon as they could be con∣veniently made out.</NOTE>—one million, six hundred and
six thousand and seventy-six pounds, five shillings, one
<PB N="216" REF="220"/>
penny, one farthing, issued and applied out of such monies as
should or might arise from the surplusses, excesses, and
other revenues composing the sinking-fund—a tax of one
shilling in the pound to be annually paid from all salaries
fees, and perquisites of offices and employments in Great-Britain,
and from all pensions and other gratuities payable
out of any revenues belonging to his Majesty in Great-Britain,
exceeding the yearly value of one hundred pounds
—an imposition of one shilling annually upon every dwel∣ling-house
inhabited within the kingdom of Great-Britain
over and above all other duties already chargeable upon
them, to commence from the fifth day of April—an addi∣tional
tax of six-pence yearly for every window or light in
every dwelling-house inhabited in Britain which shall
contain fifteen windows or upwards; a continuation of
certain acts near expiring, with respect to the duties pay∣able
on foreign sail-cloth imported into Great-Britain,
the exportation of British gun-powder, the securing and
encouraging the trade of his Majesty's sugar colonies in
America, and the empowering the importers and proprie∣tors
of spirits from the British sugar plantations to land
them before payment of the duties of excise, and to lodge
them in warehouses at their own expense—an annual tax
of forty shillings for a license to be taken out by every per∣son
trading in, selling, or vending gold or silver plate,
in lieu of the duty of six-pence per ounce on all silver
plate, made or wrought, or which ought to be touched,
assayed, or marked in this kingdom, which duty now
ceased and determined—a cessation of all draw-backs
payable on the exportation of silver plate—a law prohibit∣ing
all persons from selling, by retail, any sweet or made
wines, without having first procured a license for that
purpose—and a loan by Exchequer bills for eight hundred
thousand pounds, to be charged on the first aids to be
granted in the next session of parliament. These provi∣sions
amounted to the sum of eleven millions, seventy-nine
thousand, seven hundred and twenty-two pounds, six-shillings,
and ten-pence, exceeding the grants in the sum
of five hundred ninety-three thousand, two hundred and
<PB N="217" REF="221"/>
sixty-five pounds, six shillings, and nine-pence, so that
the nation had reason to hope that this surplus of above
half a million would prevent any demand for deficiencies in
the next session. By these copious grants of a House of
Commons, whose complaisance knew no bounds, the
national debt was, at this juncture, swelled to the astonish∣ing
sum of eighty-seven millions, three hundred and sixty-seven
thousand, two hundred and ten pounds, nineteen
shillings, and ten-pence farthing; a load that would have
crushed the national credit of any other state in
christendom.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The liberality of the parliament was like
the rock in the wilderness, which flowed with the welcome
stream when touched by the rod of Moses. The present
supply which the Commons granted for the subsistence of
the Hanoverian army was, in pursuance of a message from
his Majesty, communicated to the House by Mr. Secre∣tary
Pitt, signifying, That the King had ordered his
electoral army to be put again in motion, that it might act
with vigour against the common enemy, in concert with
his good brother and ally, the King of Prussia; that the
exhausted and ruined state of the electorate having ren∣dered
it incapable of maintaining that army, until the fur∣ther
necessary charge thereof, as well as the more particu∣lar
measures then concerting for the effectual support of
his Prussian Majesty, could be laid before the House, the
King, relying on the constant zeal of his faithful Com∣mons
for the support of the protestant religion, and of the
liberties of Europe against the dangerous designs of France
and her confederates, found himself, in the mean time,
under the absolute necessity of recommending to the House
the speedy consideration of such a present supply as might
enable his Majesty, in this critical conjuncture, to subsist
and keep together the said army. This address was no
sooner recited by the Speaker, than it was unanimously
referred to the committee of supply, who gratified his Ma∣jesty's
wish with an immediate resolution; and, consi∣dering
their generous disposition, doubtless the same com∣pliance
<PB N="218" REF="222"/>
would have appeared, even though no mention had
been made of the protestant religion, which, to men of
ordinary penetration, appeared to have no natural concern
in the present dispute between the belligerent powers,
although former ministers had often violently introduced
it into messages and speeches from the throne, in order to
dazzle the eyes of the populace, even while they insulted
the understanding of those who were capable of exercising
their own reason. This pretext was worn so threadbare, that,
among the sensible part of mankind, it could no longer be
used without incurring contempt and ridicule. In order
to persuade mankind that the protestant religion was in
danger, it would have been necessary to specify the de∣signs
that were formed against it, as well as the nature of
the conspiracy, and to descend to particulars, properly au∣thenticated.
In that case, great part of Europe would
have been justly alarmed. The States-General of the
United-Provinces, who have made such glorious and inde∣fatigable
efforts in support of the protestant religion, would
surely have lent an helping hand towards its preservation.
The Danes would not have stood tamely neutral, and seen
the religion they profess exposed to the rage of such a pow∣erful
confederacy. It is not to be imagined that the
Swedes, who have so zealously maintained the purity of the
Protestant faith, would now join an association whose aim
was the ruin of that religion. It is not credible that even
the Hungarians, who prosess the same faith, and other
protestant states of the Empire, would enter so heartily
into the interests of those who were bent upon its de∣struction;
or that the Russians would contribute to the
aggrandisement of the catholick faith and discipline, so
opposite to that of the Greek church, which they espouse.
As, therefore, no particular of such a design was ex∣plained,
no act of oppression towards any protestant state or
society pointed out, except those that were excercised by
the protestants themselves; and as the court of Vienna
repeatedly disavowed any such design, in the most solemn
manner, the unprejudiced part of mankind will be apt to
<PB N="219" REF="223"/>
conclude that the cry of religion was used, as in former
times, to arouse, alarm, and inflame; nor did the artifice
prove altogether unsuccessful. Notwithstanding the
general luke-warmth of the age in matters of religion, it
produced considerable effect among the fanatick sectaries
that swarm through the kingdom of England. The
leaders of those blind enthusiasts, either actuated by the
spirit of delusion, or desirous of recommending themselves
to the protection of the higher powers, immediately seised
the hint, expatiating vehemently on the danger that im∣pended
over God's people; and exerting all their faculties
to impress the belief of a religious war, which never fails
to exasperate and impel the minds of men to such deeds of
cruelty and revenge as must discredit all religion, and even
disgrace humanity. The signal trust and confidence which
the parliament of England reposed in the King, at this
juncture, was in nothing more conspicuous than in leaving
to the crown the unlimited application of the sum granted
for augmenting the salaries of the judges. In the reign of
King William, when the act of settlement was passed, the
parliament, jealous of the influence which the crown might
acquire over the judges, provided, by an express clause of
that act, that the commissions of the judges should subsist
<HI>quam diu se bene g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sserint,</HI> and that their salaries should be
established: but now we find a sum of money granted for
the augmentation of their salaries, and the crown vested
with a discretionary power to proportion and apply this
aug mentation: a stretch of complaisance, which, how
safe soeve: it may appear during the reign of a prince famed
for integrity and moderation, will perhaps one day be con∣sidered
as a very dangerous accession to the prerogative.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. So fully persuaded were the ministry that
the Commons would chearfully enable them to pay what
subsidies they might promise to their German allies, that
on the eleventh of April they concluded a new treaty or
convention with his Prussian Majesty, which, that it might
have the firmer consistence, and the greater authority, was,
on the part of Great Britain, transacted and signed by
<PB N="220" REF="224"/>
almost all the privy-counsellors who had any share in the
administration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were, Sir Robert Henley, lord keeper of the great seal; John Earl of Granville, president of the council; Thomas Holles Duke of New∣castle, first commissioner of the Treasury; Robert Earl of Holdernesse, one of the principal secretaries of state; Philip Earl of Hardwicke; and William Pitt, Esq. another of the principal secretaries of state. In the name and on the part of his Prussian Majesty, the Sieurs Dado Henry, Baron of Knvp∣hausen, his privy counsellor of embassy, and minister plenipotentiary at the court of London; and Louis Michel, his resident and chargé d'assairo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>. This treaty, which was signed at West∣minster,
imported, “That the contracting powers having
mutually resolved to continue their efforts for their reci∣procal
defense and security, for the recovery of their pos∣sessions,
the protection of their allies, and the support of
the liberties of the Germanick body, his Britannick Ma∣jesty
had, from these considerations, determined to grant
to his Prussian Majesty an immediate succour in money,
as being the most ready and the most efficacious, and their
Majesties having judged it proper that thereupon a con∣vention
should be made, for declaring and fixing their in∣centions
upon this head, they had nominated and autho∣rised
their respective ministers, who, after having commu∣nicated
their full powers to one another, agreed to the fol∣lowing
stipulations:—The King of Great-Britain engaged
to pay in the city of London, to such person as should be
authorised to receive it by his Prussian Majesty, the sum of
four millions of German crowns, amounting to six hundred
and seventy thousand pounds sterling, to be paid at once,
and in one whole sum, immediately after the exchange of
ratifications, upon being demanded by his Prussian Ma∣jesty.
This prince, on his part, obliged himself to apply
that sum to the maintaining and augmenting his forces,
which should act in the best manner for the good of the
common cause, and for the purpose of reciprocal defense
and mutual security, proposed by their said Majesties.
Moreover, the high contracting parties engaged not to
conclude any treaty of peace, truce, or neutrality, nor any
other sort of convention or agreement, with the powers
engaged in the present war, but in concert and by mutual
<PB N="221" REF="225"/>
agreement, wherein both should be nominally compre∣hended.
Finally, it was stipulated that this convention
should be ratified, and the ratifications exchanged on both
sides, within the term of six weeks, to be computed from
the day of signing this present convention, or sooner, if
possible.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. All the resolutions to which the committee
of ways and means agreed were executed by bills, or
clauses in bills, which afterwards received the royal sanc∣tion.
The militia still continued to be an object of par∣liamentary
care and attention: but the institution was not
yet heartily embraced, because seemingly discountenanced
by the remnant of the old ministry, which still maintained
a capital place in the late coalition, and indeed almost
wholly engrossed the distribution of pensions and places.
The Commons having presented an address to his Ma∣jesty,
with respect to the harbour of Milford-haven, a
book of plans and estimates for fortifying that harbour
was laid before the House, and a committee appointed to
examine the particulars. They were of opinion that the
mouth of the harbour was too wide to admit of any forti∣fication,
or effectual defense; but that the passage called
Nailand point, lying higher than Hubberstone-road, might
be fortified, so as to afford safe riding and protection to
the trade and navy of Great-Britain: that, if it should
be thought proper hereafter to establish a yard and dock
for building and equipping fleets at Milford, no place
could, from the situation, nature, soil, and a general
concurrence of all necessary local circumstances, be more
fitted for such a design: that if a proper use were made
of this valuable though long-neglected harbour, the
distressful delays, too often embarrassing and disappointing
the nation in her naval operations, might be in a great
measure happily removed, to the infinite relief and en∣largement
of the kingdom in the means of improving its
naval force; the necessary progress and free execution of
which was now so unhappily and frequently restrained and
frustrated, by the want of a harbour like that of Milford∣haven,
<PB N="222" REF="226"/>
framed by nature with such local advantages▪
This report appeared to be so well supported by evidence,
that a bill was framed, and passed into an act, for granting
ten thousand pounds towards carrying on the works for
fortifying and securing the harbour of Milford in the
county of Pembroke. Other laws of national consequence
were enacted, in the course of this session, with little of
no opposition. On the very first day of their sitting, the
Commons received a petition from the mayor, magistrates,
merchants, and inhabitants of Liverpool, complaining
of the high price of wheat, and other grain; expressing
their apprehension that it would continue to rise, unless
the time for the importation of foreign corn duty free
should be prolonged, or some other salutary measure taker
by parliament, to prevent dealers from engrossing corn
submitting to the wisdom of the House a total prohibitio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of distilling and exporting grain while the high price
should continue; praying they would take the premisses
into consideration, and grant a seasonable relief to the
petitioners, by a continuance of a free importation, and
taking such other effectual means to reduce the growing
price of corn as to them should seem necessary and ex∣pedient.
This being an urgent case, that equally inte∣rested
the humanity of the legislature and the manu∣factures
of the kingdom, it was deliberated upon, and
discussed with remarkable despatch. In a few days a bill
was prepared, passed through both Houses, and enacted
into a law, continuing till the twenty-fourth day of De∣cember,
in the present year, the three acts of last session
for prohibiting the exportation of corn; for prohibiting
the distillation of spirits; and for allowing the importation
of corn duty free. A second law was established, regu∣lating
the price and assise of bread, and subjecting to
severe penalties those who should be concerned in its
adulteration. In consequence of certain resolutions taken
in a committee of the whole House, a bill was presented
for prohibiting the payment of the bounty upon the
exportation of corn, unless sold at a lower price than is
<PB N="223" REF="227"/>
allowed in an act passed in the first year of the reign of
William and Mary: but this bill, after having been read
a second time, and committed, was neglected, and proved
abortive.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. In consequence of a motion made by Mr.
Grenville, a humane bill was prepared and brought in
for the encouragement of seamen employed in the royal
navy, establishing a regular method for the punctual,
frequent, and certain payment of their wages; enabling
them more easily and readily to remit money for the support
of their wives and families, and preventing the frauds and
abuses attending such payments. This bill, having passed
the Lower House, engaged in a very particular manner
the attention of the Lords, who, by divers messages to
the House of Commons, desired the attendance of several
members. These messages being taken into consideration,
several precedents were recited; a debate arose about their
formality, and the House unanimously resolved that a
message should be sent to the Lords, acquainting them
that the House of Commons, not being sufficiently in∣formed
by their messages upon what grounds, or for what
purposes, their lordships desired the House would give
leave to such of their members as were named in the said
messages to attend the House of Lords, in order to be
examined upon the second reading of the bill; the Com∣mons
hoped their lordships would make them acquainted
with their intention. The Lords, in answer to this in∣timation,
gave the Commons to understand, that they
desired the attendance of the members mentioned in their
messages, that they might be examined as witnesses upon
the second reading of the bill. This explanation being
deemed satisfactory, the members attended the House of
Lords, where they were carefully and fully examined, as
persons conversant in sea-affairs, touching the inconve∣niencies
which had formerly attended the sea-service, as
well as the remedies now proposed: and the bill having
passed through their House, though not without warm
opposition, was enacted into a law by his Majesty's
<PB N="224" REF="228"/>
assent. The militia-act, as it passed in the last session,
being found upon trial defective, Mr. Townshend moved
for leave to bring in a new bill, to explain, amend, and
enforce it: this was accordingly allowed, prepared, and
passed into a law; though it did not seem altogether free
from material objections, some of which were of an alarm∣ing
nature. The power vested by law in the crown
over the militia is even more independent than that
which it exercises over the standing army: for this last
expires at the end of the year, if not continued by a new act
of parliament; whereas the militia is subjected to the power
of the crown for the term of five years, during which it may
be called out into actual service without consent of parlia∣ament,
and consequently employed for sinister purposes.
A commission-officer in the militia may be detained, as
subject to the articles of war, until the crown shall allow
the militia to return to their respective parishes; and thus
engaged, he is liable to death as a mutineer, or deserter,
should he refuse to appear in arms, and fight in support of
the worst measures of the worst minister. Several mer∣chants,
and manufacturers of silk, offered a petition, re∣presenting,
that in consequence of the act passed in the
last session, allowing the importation of fine organzine
Italian thrown silk till the first day of December in the
year one thousand seven hundred and fifty seven, they had
given orders to their correspondents abroad to send large
quantities of such silk through Germany to Hamburgh and
Holland, which in the common course of things might
probably have arrived in London before the act expired,
if their carriage had not been protracted by the great rains
and inundations in Italy and Germany, in the months of
August and September last, which rendered the roads for
many weeks impassable: that from unlucky accidents on
shore, and storms and contrary winds after the silk was
shipped, it could not possibly arrive within the time limit∣ed
by the act; and unless it should be admitted to an
entry, they, the petitioners, would be great susserers,
the manufactures greatly prejudiced, and the good end
<PB N="225" REF="229"/>
and purpose of the act in a great measure frustrated: they,
therefore, prayed leave to bring in a bill for allowing the
introduction of all such fine Italian organized silk as
should appear to have been shipped in Holland and Ham∣burgh
for London, on or before the first day of December.
The petition being referred to a committee, which re∣ported
that these allegations were true, the House com∣plied
with their request, and the bill having passed, was
enacted into a law in the usual form. A speedy passage
was likewise granted to the mutiny bill, and the other
annual measure for regulating the marine forces, which
contained nothing new or extraordinary. A committee
being appointed to enquire what laws were already ex∣pired,
or near expiring, they performed this difficult talk
with indefatigable patience and perseverance; and, in pur∣suance
of their resolutions, three bills were prepared and
passed into laws, continuing some acts for a certain time,
and rendering others perpetual<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among those rendered perpetual, we find an act of the 13th and 14th of Charles II. for preventing theft and rapine.

§ XXXVI. The lord-mayor, aldermen, and commons of
the city of London, in common-council assembled, having
drawn up a petition to the House of Commons, alledging
that the toll upon loaded vessels, or other craft, passing
through the arches of London-Bridge, granted by a
former act, passed in the year one thousand seven hundred
and fifty, for improving, widening, and enlarging the
passage both under and over the said bridge, was alto∣gether
precarious, and insufficient to defray the expense,
including that of a temporary wooden bridge already
erected; and praying that a bill might be prepared, for ex∣plaining
and rendering that act effectual; a committee
was appointed to examine the contents, and a bill brought
in according to their request. This, however, was op∣posed
by a petition from several persons, owners of barges
and other craft navigating the river Thames, who
affirmed, that if the bill should pass into a law as it then
stood, it would be extremely injurious to the petitioners
in particular, and to the publick in general. These were
heard by their counsel before the committee, but no report
was yet given, when the temporary bridge was reduced to
ashes. Then the mayor, aldermen, and commons of
London presented another petition, alledging, that, in
pursuance of the powers vested in them by act of parlia∣ment,
they had already demolished a good number of the
houses on London-Bridge, and directed the rest that were
standing to be taken down with all convenient expedition,
that two of the arches might be laid into one for the im∣provement
of the navigation; that they had, at a very
great expense, erected a temporary wooden bridge, to
preserve a publick passage to and from the city, until the
great arch could be finished, which temporary bridge
being consumed by fire, they must rebuild it with the
greatest expedition, at a further considerable expense;
that the sum necessary for carrying on and completing
this great and useful work, including the rebuilding of
the said temporary bridge, was estimated at fourscore
thousand pounds; and as the improving, widening, and
enlarging London-Bridge was calculated for the general
<PB N="227" REF="231"/>
good of the public, for the advancement of trade and
commerce, and for making the navigation upon the river
Thames more safe and secure; they, therefore, prayed the
House to take the premisses into consideration. This pe∣tition
being recommended by his Majesty to the consider∣ation
of the House, was referred to the committee of
supply, and produced the resolution of granting fifteen
thousand pounds towards the rebuilding of London-Bridge.
A bill was prepared, under the title of an act to im∣prove,
widen, and enlarge the passage over and through
London-Bridge, enforcing the payment of the toll im∣posed
upon loaded vessels, which had been found extremely
burthensome to trade; but this incumbrance was pre∣vented
by another petition of several merchants, trades∣men,
and other inhabitants of the borough of Southwark,
taking notice of the fifteen thousand pounds granted to∣wards
the repair of London-Bridge, and, as they were
informed, intended to make the said bridge free for all
his Majesty's subjects: they said they hoped to partake of
this public bounty; but afterwards hearing that the bill
then depending was confined to the tolls formerly granted
for repairing the said bridge, they represented the hard∣ships
which they and all traders would continue to labour
under; they alledged, that the surveyors and workmen
then employed upon this work had discovered the true
principles on which the bridge was built; that the foun∣dation
of the piers consisted of hard durable stone, well ce∣mented
together, and now as strong and firm as when first
built; that when the bridge should be finished, great savings
would be made in keeping it in repair, from the sums formerly
expended, on a mistaken opinion, that the foundation was of
wood: that there were very considerable estates appointed
solely for the repairs of the bridge, which, they apprehend∣ed,
would be sufficient to maintain it without any toll; or if
they should not be thought adequate to that purpose, they
hoped the deficiency would not be made up by a toll upon
trade and commerce, but rather by an imposition on
coaches, chariots, chaises, and saddle-horses. This re∣monstrance
<PB N="228" REF="232"/>
made no impression on the House. The bill
being, on the motion of Sir John P—s, read a third time,
passed through both Houses, and obtained the royal assent.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The interest of the manufactures was
also consulted in an act encouraging the growth of madder,
a plant essentially necessary in dying and printing callicoes,
which may be raised in England without the least incon∣venience.
It was judged, upon enquiry, that the most
effectual means to encourage the growth of this commo∣dity
would be to ascertain the tithe of it, and a bill was
brought in for that purpose. The rate of the tithe was
established at five shillings an acre; and it was enacted,
that this law should continue in force for fourteen years,
and to the end of the next session of parliament; but
wherefore this encouragement was made temporary it is
not easy to determine. The laws relating to the poor,
though equally numerous and oppressive to the subject,
having been found defective, a new clause, relating to
the settlement of servants and apprentices, was now added
to an act passed in the twentieth year of the present reign,
intituled, “An act for the better adjusting and more easy
recovery of the wages of certain servants, and of certain
apprentices.” No country in the universe can produce
so many laws made in behalf of the poor as those that are
daily accumulating in England; in no other country is there
so much money raised for their support, by private charity,
as well as publick taxation; yet this, as much as any
country, fwarms with vagrant beggars, and seems with
objects of misery and distress; a sure sign either of mis∣conduct
in the legislature, or of shameful relaxation
in the executive part of the civil administration.—The
scenes of corruption, perjury, riot, and intemperance
which every election for a member of parliament had
lately produced were now grown so infamously open and
intolerable, and the right of voting was rendered so obscure
and perplexed by the pretensions and proceedings of all
the candidates for Oxfordshire in the last election, that
the fundamentals of the constitution seemed to shake, and
<PB N="229" REF="233"/>
the very essence of parliaments to be in danger. Actuated
by these apprehensions, Sir John Phillips, a gentleman of
Wales, who had long distinguished himself in the oppo∣sition,
by his courage and independent spirit, moved for
leave to bring in a bill that should obviate any doubts
which might arise concerning the electors of knights of
the shire to serve in parliament for England, and further
regulate the proceedings of such elections. He was
accordingly permitted to bring in such a bill, in conjunction
with Mr. Townshend, Mr. Cornwall, and Lords North
and Carysfort; and in the usual course, the bill being pre∣pared,
was enacted into a law, under the title of, “An act
for further explaining the laws touching the electors of
knights of the shire to serve in parliament for that part of
Great-Britain called England.” The preamble specified,
That though, by an act passed in the eighteenth year of
the present reign, it was provided, that no person might
vote at the election of a knight or knights of a shire
within England and Wales, without having a freehold
estate, in the county for which he votes, of the clear yearly
value of forty shillings, over and above all rents and
charges, payable out of or in respect to the same; never∣theless,
certain persons, who hold their estates by copy of
court-roll, pretend to a right of voting, and have, at
certain times, presumed to vote at such elections: this
act, therefore, ordained, that from and after the twenty-ninth
day of June, in the present year, no person who
holds his estate by copy of court-roll should be entitled
thereby to vote at the election of any knight or knights of
a shire within England or Wales; but every such vote
should be void, and the person so voting should forfeit
fifty pounds to any candidate for whom such vote should not
have been given, and who should first sue for the same, to
be recovered with full costs, by action of debt, in any court
of judicature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the more easy recovery of this forfeit, it was ena<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted. That the plain∣tiff in such action might only set forth, in the declarations or bill, that the desendant was indebted to him in the sum of fifty pounds, alledging the of∣fense for which the suit should be brought, and that the desendant had acted contrary to this act, without mentioning the writ of summons to parliament, or the return thereof; and. upon trial of any issue, the plaintiff should not be obliged to prove the writ of summons to parliament, or the return thereof, or any warrant or authority to the sheriff upon any such writ: that every such action should be commenced within nine months after the fact committed; and that, if the plaintiff should discontinue his action, or be nonsuited, or have judgement given against him, the defendant should recover treble costs.</NOTE>. So far the act, thus procured, may be at∣tended
<PB N="230" REF="234"/>
with salutary consequences: but, in all probability,
the intention of its first movers and patrons was not fully
answered; inasmuch as no provision was made for putting
a stop to that spirit of license, drunkenness, and debauch∣ery,
which prevails at almost every election, and has a
very pernicious effect upon the morals of the people.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. Among the bills that miscarried in the
course of this session, some turned on points of great conse∣quence
to the community. Lord Barrington, Mr. Thomas
Gore, and Mr. Charles Townshend, were ordered by the
House to prepare a bill for the speedy and effectual re∣cruiting
his Majesty's land forces and marines, which was
no more than a transcript of the temporary act passed in
the preceding session under the same title; but the majo∣rity
were averse to its being continued for another year,
as it was attended with some prejudice to the liberty of the
subject. Objections of the same nature might have been
as justly started against another bill, for the more effectu∣ally
manning of his Majesty's navy, for preventing de∣sertion,
and for the relief and encouragement of seamen
belonging to ships and vessels in the service of the mer∣chants.
The purport of this project was to establish re∣gisters
or muster-rolls of all seamen, fishermen, lighter∣men,
and watermen; obliging ship-masters to leave sub∣scribed
lists of their respective crews at offices, maintained
for that purpose, that a certain number of them might be
chosen by lot for his Majesty's service in any case of
emergency. This expedient, however, was rejected, as
an unnecessary and ineffectual incumbrance on commerce,
which would hamper navigation, and in a little time di∣minish
the number of seamen, of consequence act dia∣metrically
opposite to the purpose for which it was con∣trived.—Numberless
<PB N="231" REF="235"/>
frauds having been committed, and
incessant lawsuits produced, by private and clandestine
conveyances, a motion was made, and leave given, to form
a bill for the publick registering of all deeds, conveyances,
wills, and other incumbrances, that might affect any
honours, manours, lands, tenements, and hereditaments,
within the kingdom of England, wherein publick registers
were not already appointed by act of parliament: but this
measure, so necessary to the ascertainment and possession
of property, met with a violent opposition; and was
finally dropped, as some people imagine, through the in∣fluence
of those who, perhaps, had particular reasons for
countenancing the present mysterious forms of convey∣ancing.
Such a bill must also have been disagreeable and
mortifying to the pride of those landholders whose estates
were incumbered, because, in consequence of such a re∣gister,
every mortgage under which they laboured would
be exactly known.—The next object to which the House
converted its attention, was a bill explaining and amend∣ing
a late act for establishing a fish-market in the city of
Westminster, and preventing scandalous monopolies of a
few engrossing fish-mongers, who imposed exorbitant
prices on their fish, and in this particular branch of traffick
gave law to above six hundred thousand of their fellow∣citizens.
Abundance of pains was taken to render this
bill effectual, for putting an end to such flagrant impo∣sition.
Enquiries were made, petitions read, counsel
heard, and alterations proposed: at length the bill, having
passed through the Lower House, was conveyed to the
Lo <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ds, among whom it was suffered to expire, on pretence
that there was not time sufficient to expire, or pretence
the subject.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. The occasion that produced the next bill
which miscarried we shall explain, as an incident equally
extraordinary and interesting. By an act passed in the
preceding session, for recruiting his Majesty's land-forces
and marines, we have already observed, that the commis∣sioners
thereby appointed were vested with a power of judg∣ing
<PB N="232" REF="236"/>
ultimately whether the persons brought before them
were such as ought, by the rules prescribed in the act, to
be impressed into the service: for it was expressly pro∣vided,
that no person, so impressed by those commissioners,
should be taken out of his Majesty's service by any process,
other than for some criminal accusation. During the
recess of parliament, a gentleman having been impressed
before the commissioners, and consined in the Savoy, his
friends made application for a habeas-corpus, which pro∣duced
some hesitation, and indeed an insurmountable diffi∣culty:
for, according to the writ of habeas-corpus, passed
in the reign of Charles the Second, this privilege relates
only to persons committed for criminal or supposed crimi∣nal
matters and the gentleman did not stand in that pre∣dicament.
Before the question could be determined he
was discharged, in consequence of an application to the
secretary at war; but the nature of the case plainly
pointed out a defect in the act, seemingly of the most
dangerous consequence to the liberty of the subject. In
order to remedy this defect, a bill for giving a more speedy
relief to the subject, upon the writ of habeas-corpus,
was prepared, and presented to the House of Commons,
which formed itself into a committee, and made several
amendments. It imported, that the several provisions
made in the aforesaid act, passed in the reign of Charles II.
for the awarding of writs of habeas-corpus, in cases of
commitment, or detainer, for any criminal or supposed
criminal matter, should, in like manner, extend to all
cases where any person, not being committed or detained
for any criminal or supposed criminal matter, should be
confined, or restrained of his or her liberty, under any
colour or pretense whatsoever: that, upon oath made by
such person so consined or restrained, or by any other on
his or her behalf, of any actual consinement or restraint,
and that such consinement or restraint, to the best of
the knowledge and belief of the person so applying, was
not by virtue of any commitment or detainer for any
criminal or supposed criminal matter, an habeas-cor∣pus,
<PB N="233" REF="237"/>
directed to the person or persons so confining or
restraining the party, as aforesaid, should be awarded
and granted, in the same manner as is directed, and
under the same penalties as are provided by the said
act, in the case of persons committed and detained for
any criminal or supposed criminal matter: that the person
or persons before whom the party so confined or restrained
should be brought, by virtue of any hubeas-corpus granted
in the vacation-time, under the authority of this act,
might and should, within three days after the return
made, proceed to examine into the facts contained in
such return, and into the cause of such confinement
and estraint; and thereupon either discharge, or bail, or
remand the parties so brought, as the case should require,
and as to justice should appertain. The rest of the bill
related to the return of the writ in three days, and the
penalties incurred by those who should neglect or refuse
to make the que return, or to comply with any other
clause of this regulation. The Commons seemed hearty
in rearing up this additional buttress to the liberty of their
fellow subjects, and passed the bill with the most laudable
alacrity: but in the House of Lords such a great number
of objections was started, that it sunk at the second read∣ing,
and the judges were ordered to prepare a bill for
the same purpose, to be laid before that House in the next
seilion.</P>
<P>§ XL. His Majesty having recommended the care of
the Foundling-Hospital to the House of Commons, which
chearfully granted forty thousand pounds for the support
of that charity, the growing annual expense of it appear∣ed
worthy of further consideration, and leave was granted
to bring in a bill, for obliging all the parishes of England
and Wales to keep registers of all their deaths, births,
and marriages, that from these a fund might be raised
towards the support of the said hospital. The bill was
accordingly prepared by a committee appointed for the
purpose; but before the House could take the report into
consideration the parliament was prorogued. The pro∣prietors
<PB N="234" REF="238"/>
of the privateer called the Antigallican, which
had taken a rich French ship homeward-bound from
China, and carried her into Cadix, where the Spanish
government had wrested her by violence from the captors,
and delivered her to the French owners, now presented a
petition to the House of Commons, complaining of this
interposition as an act of partiality and injustice; repre∣senting
the great expense at which the privateer had been
equipped, the legality of the capture, the loss and hardships
which they the petitioners had sustained, and imploring
such relief as the House should think requisite. Though
these allegations were supported by a species of evidence
that seemed strong and convincing, and it might be though
incumbent on the parliament to vindicate the honour of
the nation, when thus insulted by a foreign power, the
House, upon this occasion, treated the petition with the
most mortifying neglect, either giving little credit to the
assertions it contained, or unwilling to take any step
which might at this juncture embroil the nation with the
court of Spain on such a friyolous subject. True it is
the Spanish government alledged, in their own justifi∣cation,
that the prize was taken under the guns of Co∣runna,
insomuch that the shot fired by the privateer
entered that place, and damaged some houses: but this
allegation was never properly sustained, and the prize
was certainly condemned as legal by the court of Admi∣ralty
at Gibraltar.</P>
<P>§ XLI. As we have already given a detail of the trial of
Sir John Mordaunt, it will be unnecessary to recapitulate
any circumstances of that affair, except such as relate to
its connexion with the proceedings of parliament. In the
beginning of this session, Lord Barrington, as secretary
at war, informed the House, by his Majesty's command▪
that Lieutenant General Sir John Mordaunt, a member
of that House, was in arrest for disobedience of his Ma∣jesty's
orders, while employed on the late expedition to
the coast of France. The Commons immediately resolv∣ed,
That an address should be presented to his Majesty
<PB N="235" REF="239"/>
returning him the thanks of this House for his gracious
message of that day, in the communication he had been
pleased to make of the reason for putting Lieutenant-General
Sir John Mordaunt in arrest. Among the va∣rious
objects of commerce that employed the attention of
the House, one of the most considerable was the trade to
the coast of Africa, for the protection of which an annual
sum had been granted for some years, to be expended in
the maintenance and repairs of castles and factories.
While a committee was employed in perusing the accounts
relating to the sum granted in the preceding session for
this purpose, a petition from the committee of the African
company, recommended in a message from his Majesty,
was presented to the House, soliciting further assistance
for the ensuing year. In the mean time, a remonstrance
was offered by certain planters and merchants, interested
in and trading to the British sugar colonies in America,
alledging, that the price of n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>groes was greatly advanced
since the forts and settlements on the coast of Africa had
been under the direction of the committee of the company
of merchants trading to that coast; a circumstance that
greatly distressed and alarmed the petitioners, prevented
the cultivation of the British colonies, and was a great
detriment to the trade and navigation of the kingdom:
that this misfortune, they believed, was in some measure
owing to the ruinous state and condition of the forts and
settlements: that, in their opinion, the most effectual
method for maintaining the interest of that trade on a
respectable footing, next to that of an incorporated joint∣stock
company, would be putting those forts and settle∣ments
under the sole direction of the commissioners for
trade and plantations: that the preservation or ruin of the
American sugar colonies went hand in hand with that of
the slave trade to Africa: that, by an act passed in the
year one thousand seven hundred and fifty, for extending
and improving this trade, the British subjects were de∣barred
from lodging theri slaves and merchandise in the
sorts and settlements on the coasts: they, therefore,
<PB N="236" REF="240"/>
prayed that this part of the act might be repealed; that
all commanders of British and American vessels, free mer∣chants,
and all other his Majesty's subjects, who were
settled, or might at any time thereafter settle in Africa,
should have free liberty, from sun-rise to sun-set, to enter
the forts and settiements, and to deposit their good▪ and
merchandise in the warehouses thereunto belonging; to
secure their slaves or othèr purchases without paying any
consideration for the same; but the slaves to be victualled
at the proper cost and charge of their respective owners.
The House having taken this petition into consideration,
enquired into the proceedings of the company, and revised
the act for extending and improving the trade to Africa,
resolved, that the committee of the African company
had faithfully discharged the trust reposed in them, and
granted ten thousand pounds for maintaining the British
forts and settlements in that part of the world. The ene∣my
were perfectly well acquainted with the weakness of the
British castles on the coast of Africa; and had they known
as well how to execute with spirit, as to plan with sagacity,
the attempt which, in the course of the preceding year,
they made upon the principal British fort in Guinea
would have succeeded, and all the other settlements would
have fallen into their hands without opposition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert Hunter Morrie, represented, in a petition to the House, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no falt was made in the British colonies in America, they were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to depend upon a precarious supply of that commodity from foreigners; he therefore, offered to undertake the making of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at a moderate price in one of those colonies, at his own risque and charge, provided h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could be secured in the enjoyment of the profits which the work <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pro∣duce, for such a term of years as might seem to the House a proper <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>punc; compensation for so great an undertaking. The petition was or∣dered to lie upon the table, afterwards read, and referred to a committee which however made no report—A circumstance not easily accounted for unless we suppose the House of Commons were of opinion that such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enterprise might contribute towards rendering our colonies too independence of their mother-country.

§ XLII. The longest and warmest debate which was
maintained in the course of this session arose from a mo∣tion
for leave to bring in a bill for shortening the term
and duration of future parliaments; a measure truly pa∣triotical,
against which no substantial argument could be
produced, although the motion was rejected by the ma∣jority,
on pretence, that, whilst the nation was engaged in
such a dangerous and expensive war, it would be im∣proper
to think of introducing such an alteration in the
form of government. Reasons of equal strength and so∣lidity
will never be wanting to the patrons and ministers
of C—n and V—. The alteration proposed
was nothing less than removing and ann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling an en∣croachment
which had been made on the constitution:
it might have been effected without the least pang or con∣vulsion,
to the general satisfaction of the nation: far from
being unreasonable at this juncture, it would have en∣hanced
the national reputation abroad, and rendered the
war more formidable to the enemies of Great-Britain, by
convincing them that it was supported by a ministry and
parliament, who stood upon such good terms with the
people. Indeed, a quick succession of parliaments might
have disconcerted, and perhaps expelled that spirit of con∣fidence
and generosity which now so remarkably espoused
and gratified the s—'s predilection for the interest
of H—. Other committees were established, to en∣quire
into the expense incurred by new lines and fortifica∣tions
raised at Gibraltar; to examine the original standards
of weights and measures used in England; consider the laws
relating to them, and report their observations, together
with their opinion of the most effectuals means for as∣certaining
and enforcing uniform standards to be used for
the future. The Commons were perfectly satisfied with
the new works which had been raised at Gibraltar; and
with respect to the weights and measures, the committee
agreed to certain resolutions, but no further progress was
made in this enquiry, except an order for printing these
resolutions, with the appendix; however, as the boxes
<PB N="238" REF="242"/>
containing the standards were ordered to be locked up by
the clerk of the House, in all probability their intention
was to proceed on this subject in some future session. On
the ninth day of June sundry bills received the royal assent
by commission, his Majesty being indisposed; and on the
twentieth day of the same month, the lords commissioners
closed the session with a speech to both Houses, expressing
his Majesty's deep sense of their loyalty and good affection,
demonstrated in their late proceedings, in their zeal for his
honour and real interest in all parts, in their earnestness
to surmount every difficulty, in their ardour to maintain
the war with the utmost vigour; proofs which must con∣vince
mankind that the ancient spirit of the British nation
still subsisted in its full force. They were given to under∣stand
that the King had taken all such measures as appear∣ed
the most conducive to the accomplishment of their pub∣lick-spirited
views and wishes; that with their assistance,
crowned by the blessing of God upon the conduct and
bravery of the combined army, his Majesty had been ena∣bled,
not only to deliver his dominions in Germany from
the oppressions and devastations of the French, but also
to push his advantages on this side the Rhine; that he
had cemented the union between him and his good brother
the King of Prussia, by new engagements; that the Bri∣tish
fleets and armies were now actually employed in such ex∣peditions
as appeared likely to annoy the enemy in the most
sensible manner, and to promote the welfare and prosperity
of these kingdoms; in particular, to preserve the British
rights and possessions in America, and to make France
feel, in those parts, the real strength and importance of
Great-Britain. The Commons were thanked for the am∣ple
supplies which they had so freely and unanimously
given, and assured on the part of his Majesty that they
should be managed with the most frugal oeconomy. They
were desired, in consequence of the King's earnest recom∣mendation,
to promote harmony and good agreement
amongst his faithful subjects; to make the people ac∣quainted
with the rectitude and purity of his intentions
<PB N="239" REF="243"/>
and measures, and to exert themselves in maintaining the
peace and good order of the country, by enforcing obe∣dience
to the laws and lawful authority.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. Never, surely, had any sovereign more rea∣son
to be pleased with the conduct of his ministers, and
the spirit of his people. The whole nation reposed the
most unbounded confidence in the courage and discretion,
as well as in the integrity of the minister, who seemed
eager upon prosecuting the war with such vigour and
activity as appeared almost unexampled in the annals of
Great-Britain. New levies were made, new ships put in
commission, fresh expeditions undertaken, and fresh con∣quests
projected. Such was the credit of the administra∣tion,
that people subscribed to the government loans with
surprising eagerness. An unusual spirit of enterprise and
resolution seemed to inspire all the individuals that consti∣tuted
the army and navy; and the passion for military
fame diffused itself through all ranks in the civil depart∣ment
of life, even to the very dregs of the populace: such
a remarkable change from indolence to activity, from in∣difference
to zeal, from timorous caution to fearless ex∣ecution,
was effected by the influence and example of an
intelligent and intrepid minister, who, chagrined at the
inactivity and disgraces of the preceding campaign, had,
on a very solemn occasion, lately declared his belief that
there was a determined resolution, both in the naval and
military commanders, against any vigorous exertion of the
national power in the service of the country. He affirmed,
that though his Majesty appeared ready to embrace every
measure proposed by his ministers for the honour and in∣terest
of his British dominions, yet scarce a man could be
found with whom the execution of any one plan in which
there was the least appearance of any danger could with
confidence be trusted. He particularised the inactivity of
one general in North-America, from whose abilities and
personal bravery the nation had conceived great expec∣tations:
he complained, that this noble commander had
expressed the most contemptuous disregard for the civil
<PB N="240" REF="244"/>
power, from which he derived his authority, by neglecting
to transmit, for a considerable length of time, any othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
advice of his proceedings but what appeared on a writte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
scrap of paper: he observed, that with a force by land an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

tained, with a King and minister ardently desirous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
redeeming her glory, succouring her allies, and promotin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
her true interest, a shameful dislike to the service ever
where prevailed, and few seemed affected with any othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
zeal than that of aspiring to the highest posts, and graspin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the largest salaries. The censure levelled at the command<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in America was founded on mistake: the inactivity <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that noble lord was not more disappointing to the minist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
than disagreeable to his own inclination. He used <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
utmost endeavours to answer the expectation of the pub∣lick,
but his hands were effectually tied by an absolu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
impossibility of success, and his conduct stood justified <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the eyes of his sovereign. A particular and accurate deta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of his proceedings he transmitted through a canal, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he imagined would have directly conveyed it to the foot
the throne; but the packet was said to have been pur
posely intercepted and suppressed. Perhaps he was n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
altogether excuseable for having corresponded so slight
with the secretary of state; but he was said to have go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
abroad in full persuasion that the ministry would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
changed, and therefore his assiduities were principal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
directed to the great personage, who, in that case, woul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have superintended and directed all the operations of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
army. All sorts of military preparations in founderie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
docks, arsenals, raising and exercising troops, and victualling transports, were now carried on with such diligen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and dispatch as seemed to promise an exertion that woul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
soon obliterate the disagreeable remembrance of past dis
grace. The beginning of the year was, however, a little
clouded by a general concern for the death of his Majesty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
third daughter, the Princess Caroline, a lady of the mos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
exemplary virtue and amiable character, who died at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="241" REF="245"/>
age of forty-five, sincerely regretted as a pattern of unaf∣fected
piety, and unbouuded benevolence.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. The British cruisers kept the sea during all
the severity of winter, in order to protect the commerce
of the kingdom, and annoy that of the enemy. They
exerted themselves with such activity, and their vigilance
was attended with such success, that a great number of
prizes was taken, and the trade of France almost totally
extinguished. A very gallant exploit was atchieved by
one Captain Bray, commander of the Adventure, a small
armed vessel in the government's service: falling in with
the Machault, a large privateer of Dunkirk, near Dun∣genness,
he ran her a board, fastened her boltsprit to his
capstan, and after a warm engagement compelled her
commander to submit. A French frigate of thirty-six
guns was taken by Capt. Parker, in a new fire-ship of
inferior force. Divers privateers of the enemy were sunk,
burned, or taken, and a great number of merchant-ships
fell into the hands of the English. Nor was the success
of the British ships of was confined to the English chan∣nel.
At this period the board of Admiralty received in∣formation
from Admiral Cotes, in Jamaica, of an action
which happened off the island of Hispaniola, in the month
of October of the preceding year, between three English
ships of war and a French squadron. Captain Forrest,
an officer of distinguished merit in the service, had, in the
ship Augusta, failed from Port-Royal in Jamaica, accom∣panied
by the Dreadnought and Edinburgh, under the
command of the Captains Suckling and Langdon. He
was ordered to cruise off Cape Francçois, and this service
he literally performed in the face of the French squadron
under Kersin, lately arrived at that place from the coast of
Africa. This commander, piqued at seeing himself thus
insulted by an inferior armament, resolved to come forth
and give them battle; and that he might either take them,
or at least drive them out of these seas, so as to afford a free
passage to a great number of merchant-ships then lying
<PB N="242" REF="246"/>
at the Cape, bound for Europe, he took every precaution
which he thought necessary, to insure success. He re-en∣forced
his squadron with some store-ships, mounted with
guns and armed for the occasion, and supplied the defi∣ciency
in his complements, by taking on board seamen
from the merchant ships, and soldiers from the garrison.
Thus prepared, he weighed anchor, and stood out to sea,
having under his command four large ships of the line,
and three stout frigates. They were no sooner perceived
advancing, than Captain Forrest held a short council with
his two captains. “Gentlemen (said he) you know our
own strength, and see that of the enemy; shall we
give them battle?” They replying in the affirmative,
he added, “Then fight them we will; there is no time
to be lost; return to your ships, and get them ready for
engaging.” After this laconick consultation among
these three gallant officers, they bore down upon the
French squadron without further hesitation, and between
three and four in the afternoon the action began with great
impetuosity. The enemy exerted themselves with uncom∣mon
spirit, conscious that their honour was peculiarly at
stake, and that they fought in sight, as it were, of their
own coast, which was lined with people, expecting to see
them return in triumph. But, notwithstanding all their en∣deavours,
their commodore, after having sustained a severe
engagement, that lasted two hours and a half, found his
ship in such a shattered condition, that he made signal for
one of his frigates to come and tow him out of the line.
His example was followed by the rest of his squadron,
which, by this assistance, with the favour of the land breeze
and the approach of night, made shift to accomplish their
escape from the three British ships, which were too much
disabled in their masts and rigging to prosecute their
victory. One of the French squadron was rendered alto∣gether
unserviceable for action: their loss in men amount∣ed
to three hundred killed, and as many wounded; whereas
that of the English did not much exceed one third of this
number. Nevertheless, they were so much damaged,
<PB N="243" REF="247"/>
that, being unable to keep the sea, they returned to Ja∣maica,
and the French commodore seised the opportunity
of sailing with a great convoy for Europe. The courage
of Captain Forrest was not more conspicuous in his en∣gagement
with the French squadron near Cape Francçois,
than his conduct and sagacity in a subsequent adventure
near Port-au-Prince, a French harbour, situated at the
bottom of a bay on the western part of Hispaniola, behind
the small island of Gonave. After M. de Kersin had
taken his departure from Cape François for Europe, Ad∣miral
Cotes, beating up to windward from Port-Royal in
Jamaica with three ships of the line, received intelligence
that there was a French fleet at Port-au-Prince, ready to
sail on their return to Europe: Captain Forrest then pre∣sented
the Admiral with a plan for an attack on this place,
and urged it earnestly. This, however, was declined, and
Captain Forrest directed to cruise off the island Gonave
for two days only, the admiral enjoining him to return at
the expiration of the time, and rejoin the squadron at
Cape-Nicholas. Accordingly, Captain Forrest, in the
Augusta, proceeded up the bay, between the island Go∣nave
and Hispaniola, with a view to execute a plan which
he had himself projected. Next day in the afternoon,
though he perceived two sloops, he forebore chasing, that
he might not risque a discovery; for the same purpose he
hoisted Dutch colours, and disguised his ship with tarpau∣lins.
At five in the afternoon he discovered seven sail of
ships steering to the westward, and hauled from them, to
avoid suspicion; but at the approach of night gave chase
with all the sail he could carry. About ten he perceived
two sail, one of which fired a gun, and the other made
the best of her way for Leoganne, another harbour in the
bay. At this period Captain Forrest reckoned eight sail
to leeward, near another port called Petit Goave; coming
up with the ship which had fired a gun, she submitted
without opposition, after he had hailed, and told her cap∣tain
what he was, produced two of his largest cannon,
and threatened to sink her if she should give the least alarm.
<PB N="244" REF="248"/>
He forthwith shifted the prisoners from this prize, and
placed on board of her five-and-thirty of his own crew,
with orders to stand for Petit Goave and intercept any
of the fleet that might attempt to reach that harbour.
Then he made sail after the rest, and in the dawn of the
morning, finding himself in the middle of their fleet, he
began to fire at them all in their turns, as he could bring
his guns to bear: they returned the fire for some time; at
length the Marguerite, the Solide, and the Theodore struck
their colours. These being secured, were afterwards used
in taking the Maurice, Le Grand, and La Flore; the
Brilliant also submitted, and the Mars made sail, in
hopes of escaping, but the Augusta coming up with her
about noon, she likewise fell into the hands of the victor.
Thus, by a well-conducted stratagem, a whole fleet of
nine sail were taken by a single ship, in the neighbourhood
of four or five harbours, in any one of which they would
have found immediate shelter and security. The prizes,
which happened to be richly laden, were safely conveyed
to Jamaica, and there sold at public auction, for the
benefit of the captors, who may safely challenge history to
produce such another instance of success.</P>
<P>§ XLV. The ministry having determined to make vi∣gorus
e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orts against the enemy in North-America, Ad∣miral
Boscawen was vested with the command of the fleet
destined for that service, and sailed from St. Helen's on
the nineteenth day of February, when the Invincible, of
seventy-four guns, one of the best ships that constituted his
squadron, ran a-ground and perished; but her men, stores,
and artillery were saved. In the course of the succeed∣ing
month Sir Edward Hawke steered into the Bay of
Bis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay with another squadron, in order to intercept any
supplies from France designed for Cape-Breton or Canada;
and about the same time the town of Embden, belong∣ing
to his Prussian Majesty, which had fallen into the
hands of the enemy, was suddenly retrieved by the conduct
of Commodore Holmes, stationed on that coast, who sent
up two of his small ships to anchor in the river between
<PB N="245" REF="249"/>
Knok and the city. The garrison, amounting to three
thousand seven hundred men, finding themselves thus cut
off from all communication with the country below, aban∣doned
the place with great precipitation, and some of their
baggage being sent off by water, was taken by the boats
which the Commodore armed for that purpose. It was
in the same month that the Admiralty received advice of
another advantage by sea, which had been gained by Ad∣miral
Osborne, while he cruised between Cape de Gatt
and Carthagena on the coast of Spain. On the twenty-eighth
day of March he fell in with the French squadron,
commanded by the Marquis du Quesne, consisting of four
ships, namely, the Foudroyant, of eighty guns, the Orphée,
of sixty-four, the Oriflamme, of fifty, and the Pleiade fri∣gate,
of twenty-four, in their passage from Toulon to
re-enforce M. de la Clue, who had for some time been
blocked up by Admiral Osborne in the harbour of Cartha∣gena.
The enemy no sooner perceived the English squa∣dron
than they dispersed, and steered different courses:
then Mr. Osborne detached divers ships in pursuit of each,
while he himself, with the body of his fleet, stood off for
the bay of Carthagena, to watch the motions of the French
squadron which lay there at anchor. About seven in the
evening, the Orphée, having on board five hundred men,
struck to Captain Storr, in the Revenge, who lost the calf
of one leg in the engagement, during which he was su∣stained
by the ships Berwick and Preston. The Mon∣mouth,
of sixty-four guns, commanded by Captain Gar∣dener,
engaged the Foudroyant, one of the largest ships in
the French navy, mounted with fourscore cannon, and
containing eight hundred men, under the direction of the
Marquis de Quesne. The action was maintained with
great fury on both sides, and the gallant Captain Garden∣er
lost his life; nevertheless, the fight was continued with
unabating vigour by his lieutenant, Mr. Carkett, and the
Foudroyant disabled in such a manner, that her comman∣der
struck, as soon as the other English ships, the Swift∣sure
and the Hampton-Court, appeared. This mortifying
<PB N="246" REF="250"/>
step, however, he did not take until he saw his ship lie
like a wreck upon the water, and the decks covered with
carnage. The Oriflamme was driven on shore under the
castle of Aiglos, by the ships Montague and Monarque,
commanded by the Captains Rowley and Montague, who
could not complete their destruction without violating the
neutrality of Spain. As for the Pleiade frigate, she made
her escape by being a prime sailor. This was a severe
stroke upon the enemy, who not only lost two of their
capital ships, but saw them added to the navy of Great-Britain,
and the disaster was followed close by another,
which they could not help feeling with equal sensibility
of mortification and chagrin. In the beginning of April,
Sir Edward Hawke, steering with his squadron into Basque∣road,
on the coast of Poictou, discovered, off the isle of
Aix, a French fleet at anchor, consisting of five ships of
the line, with six frigates, and forty transports, having on
board three thousand troops, and a large quantity of stores
and provisions, intended as a supply for their settlements
in North-America. They no sooner saw the English
Admiral advancing, than they began to slip their cables,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly in the utmost confusion. Some of them escaped
by sea, but the greater number ran into shoal water,
where they could not be pursued; and next morning
they appeared a-ground, lying on their broadsides. Sir
Edward Hawke, who had rode all night at anchor a-breast
of the isle of Aix, furnished the ships Intrepid and Med-way
with trusty pilots, and sent them farther in when the
stood began to make, with orders to found a-head, that he
might know whether there was any possibility of attack∣ing
the enemy, but the want of a sufficient depth of wa∣ter
rendered this scheme impracticable. In the mean
time, the French threw over-board their cannon, stores,
and ballast; and boats and launches from Rochefort were
employed in carrying out warps, to drag their ships through
the soft mud, as soon as they should be water-borne by
the flowing-tide. By these means their large ships of war,
and many of their transports, escaped into the river Cha∣rente;
<PB N="247" REF="251"/>
but their loading was lost, and the end of their
equipment totally defeated. Another convoy of merchant
ships, under the protection of three frigates, Sir Edward
Hawke, a few days before, had chased into the harbour
of St. Martin's, in the isle of Rhé, where they still re∣mained,
waiting an opportunity for hazarding a second
departure: a third, consisting of twelve sail, bound from
Bourdeaux to Quebeck, under convoy of a frigate and arm∣ed
vessel, was encountered at sea by one British ship of the
line and two fire-ships, which took the frigate and arm∣ed
vessel, and two of the convoy afterwards met with the
same fate; but this advantage was over-balanced by the loss
of Captain James Hume, commander of the Pluto fire-ship,
a brave accomplished officer, who, in an unequal combat
with the enemy, refused to quit the deck even when he
was disabled, and fell gloriously, covered with wounds,
exhorting the people, with his latest breath, to continue
the engagement while the ship could swim, and acquit
themselves with honour in the service of their country.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. On the twenty-ninth day of May the Rai∣sonnable,
a French ship of the line, mounted with sixty-four
cannon, having on board six hundred and thirty men,
commanded by the Prince de Mombazon Chevalier de
Rohan, was, in her passage from Port l'Orient to Brest,
attacked by Captain Dennis, in the Dorsetshire, of seventy
guns, and taken after an obstinate engagement, in which
one hundred and sixty men of the Prince's complement
were killed or wounded, and he sustained great damage in
his hull, sails, and rigging. These successes were more∣over
chequered by the tidings of a lamentable disaster that
befell the ship Prince George, of eighty guns, commanded
by Rear-Admiral Broderick, in his passage to the Medi∣terranean.
On the thirteenth day of April, between one
and two in the afternoon, a dreadful fire broke out in the
fore part of the ship, and raged with such fury, that not∣withstanding
all the efforts of the officers and men for
several hours, the flames increased, and the ship being con∣sumed
to the water's edge, the remnant sunk about six
<PB N="248" REF="252"/>
o'clock in the evening. The horrour and consternation of
such a scene are not easily described. When all endea∣vours
proved fruitless, and no hope of preserving the ship
remained, the barge was hoisted out for the preservation of
the Admiral, who entered it accordingly; but all distinc∣tion
of persons being now abolished, the seamen rushed
into it in such crouds, that in a few moments it overset.
The admiral, foreseeing that this would be the case, strip∣ped
off his clothes, and committing himself to the mercy of
the waves, was saved by the boat of a merchant-ship, after
he had sustained himself in the sea a full hour by swim∣ing.
Captain Payton, who was the second in command,
remained upon the quarter-deck as long as it was possible
to keep that station, and then descending by the stern
ladder, had the good fortune to be taken into a boat be∣longing
to the Alderney sloop. The hull of the ship,
masts, and rigging, were now in a blaze, bursting tremen∣dous
in several parts through horrid clouds of smoak;
nothing was heard but the crackling of the flames, mingled
with the dismal cries of terror and distraction; nothing
was seen but acts of phrenzy and despertation. The
miserable wretches, affrighted at the horrours of such a
conflagration, sought a fate less dreadful, by plunging into
the sea, and about three hundred men were preserved by
the boats belonging to some ships that accompanied the
Admiral in his voyage, but five hundred perished in the
ocean.</P>
<P>§ XLVII. The King of Great-Britain being deter∣mined
to renew his attempt upon the coast of France, or∣dered
a very formidable armament to be equipped for that
purpose. Two powerful squadrons by sea were destined
for the services of this expedition, the first, consisting of
eleven great ships, was commanded by Lord Anson and
Sir Edward Hawke: the other, composed of four ships of
the line, seven frigates, six sloops, two fire-ships, two
bombs, ten cutters, twenty tenders, ten store-ships, and
one hundred transports, was put under the direction of
Commodore Howe, who had signalised himself by his
<PB N="249" REF="253"/>
gallantry and conduct in the course of the last fruitless
expedition. The plan of a descent upon France having
been adopted by the ministry, a body of troops, consisting
of sixteen regiments, nine troops of light-horse, and six
thousand marines, was assembled for the execution of this
design, and embarked under the command of the Duke of
Marlborough; a nobleman, who, though he did not in∣herit
all the military genius of his grandfather, yet far ex∣celled
him in the amiable and social qualities of the heart:
he was brave beyond all question, generous to profusion,
and good-natured to excess. On this occasion, he was
assisted by the councils of Lord George Sackville, second
in command, son to the Duke of Dorset; an officer of
experience and reputation, who had, in the civil depart∣ments
of government, exhibited proofs of extraordinary
genius and uncommon application. The troops, having
been encamped for some time upon the Isle of Wight, were
embarked in the latter end of May, and the two fleets
sailed in the beginning of June for the coast of Bretagne,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaving the people of England flushed with the gayest hopes
of victory and conquest. The two fleets parted at sea:
Lord Anson, with his squadron, proceeded to the bay of
Biscay, in order to watch the motions of the enemy's ships,
and harrass their navigation; while Commodore Howe,
with the land-forces, steered directly towards St. Maloes, a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trong place of considerable commerce, situated on the
coast of Bretagne, against which the purposed invasion
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemed to be chiefly intended. The town, however, was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound too well fortified, both by art and nature, to admit
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f an attempt by sea with any prospect of success; and,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore, it was resolved to make a descent in the neigh∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourhood.
After the fleet had been, by contrary winds,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etained several days in sight of the French coast, it ar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved
in the bay of Cancalle, about two leagues to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astward of St. Maloes, and Mr. Howe having silenced a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall battery which the enemy had occasionally raised upon
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he beach, the troops were landed, without further oppo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion,
on the sixth day of June. The Duke of Marl∣borough
<PB N="250" REF="254"/>
immediately began his march towards St. Servan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with a view to destroy such shipping and magazines as
might be in any accessible parts of the river; and this
scheme was executed with success. A great quantity of
naval stores, two ships of war, several privateers, and abou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fourscore vessels of different sorts, were set on fire, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
reduced to ashes, almost under the cannon of the place
which, however, they could not pretend to besiege i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
form. His grace having received repeated advices tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the enemy were busily employed in assembling forces to
march against him, returned to Cancalle, where Mr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Howe had made such a masterly disposition of the boats
and transports, that the re-embarkation of the troops was
performed with surprising ease and expedition. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
forces, while they remained on shore, were restrained from
all outrages by the most severe discipline; and the French
houses, which their inhabitants had abandoned, were left
untouched. Immediately after their landing, the Duke
of Marlborough, as commander in chief, published and
distributed a manifesto, addressed to the people of Bre∣tagne,
giving them to understand, that his descent upon
the coast was not effected with a design to make war on
the inhabitants of the open country, except such as should
be found in arms, or otherwise opposing the operations of
his Britannick Majesty: that all who were willing to con∣tinue
in peaceable possession of their effects, might re∣main
unmolested in their respective dwellings, and follow
their usual occupations; that, besides the customs and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>axes they used to pay to their own King, nothing should
be required of them but what was absolutely necessary for
the subsistence of the army; and that, for all provisions
brought in, they should be paid in ready money. He
concluded this notice with declaring, that if, notwith∣standing
these assurances of protection, they should carry
off their effects and provisions, and abandon the places of
their habitation, he would treat them as enemies, and de∣stroy
their houses with fire and sword. To the magi∣stracy
of St. Maloes he likewise sent a letter, importing,
<PB N="251" REF="255"/>
that as all the inhabitants of the towns and villages be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>een
Dinant, Rennes, and Doll, now in his possession,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d deserted their habitations, probably to avoid the pay∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent
of the usual contributions; and he being informed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at the magistrates had compelled the people of the coun∣try
to retire into the town of St. Malo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, he now gave
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em notice, that if they did not immediately send them
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck to their houses, and come themselves to his head∣quarters,
to settle the contributions, he should think him∣self
obliged to proceed to military execution. These
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reats, however, were not put in force, although the magi∣strats,
of St. Maloes did not think proper to comply with his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>junction. But it was found altogether impossible to pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent
irregularities among troops that were naturally licen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous.
Some houses were pillaged, and not without acts
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> barbarity: but the offenders were brought to immediate
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tice; and it must be owned, as an incontestable proof
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the general's humanity, that in destroying the maga∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nes
of the enemy at St. Servan, which may be termed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e suburbs of St. Maloes, he ordered one small store∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse,
to be spared, because it could not be set on fire with∣out
endangering the whole district. The British forces
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing re-embarked, including about five hundred light∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orse,
which had been disciplined and carried over with a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew to scour the country, the fleet was detained by con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ary
winds in the bay of Cancalle for several days, during
which a design seems to have been formed for attacking
Granville, which had been reconnoitred by some of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngineers: but, in consequence of their report, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>heme was laid aside, and the fleet stood out to sea, where
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was exposed to some rough weather. In a few days,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he wind blowing in a northern direction, they steered
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gain towards the French coast, and ran in with the land
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ear Havre-de-Grace, where the flat-bottomed boats, pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ided
for landing, were hoisted out, and a second disem∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arkation
expected. But the wind blowing violently
towards the evening, the boats were re-shipped, and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eet obliged to quit the land, in order to avoid the dan∣gers
<PB N="252" REF="256"/>
of a see-shore. Next day, the weather being more
moderate, they returned to the same station, and orders
were given to prepare for a descent; but the Duke of
Marlborough having taken a view of the coast in an open
cutter, accompanied by Commodore Howe, thought pro∣per
to wave the attempt. Their next step was to bear away
before the wind for Cherbourg, in the neighbourhood of
which place the fleet came to anchor. Here some of the
transports received the fire of six different batteries; and
a considerable body of troops appeared in arms to dispute<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the landing; nevertheless, the general resolved that the
forts Querqueville, l'Hommet, and Gallet should be at∣tacked
in the night by the first regiment of guards. The
soldiers were actually distributed in the flat-bottomed boats,
and every preparation made for this enterprise, when the
wind began to blow with such violence, that the troops
could not be landed without the most imminent danger
and difficulty, nor properly sustained in case of a repulse,
even if the disembarkation could have been effected. This
attempt, therefore, was laid aside, but at the same time a
resolution taken to stand in towards the shore with the
whole fleet, to cover a general landing. A disposition was
made accordingly, but the storm increasing, the trans∣ports
ran soul of each other, and the ships were exposed to
all the perils of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce-shore, for the gale blew directly upon
the coast; besides, the provisions began to fail, and the hay
for the horses was almost consumed. These concurring
reasons induced the commanders to postpone the disem∣barkation
to a more favourable opportunity. The fleet
stood out to sea, the tempest abated, they steered for the
Isle of Wight, and next day anchored at St. Helen's.
Such was the issue of an enterprise atchieved with consi∣derable
success, if we consider the damage done to the
enemy's shipping, and the other objects which the ministry
had in view; namely, to secure the navigation of the
channel, and make a diversion in favour of German allies,
by alarming the French King, and obliging him to em∣ploy
a great number of troops to defend his coast from
<PB N="253" REF="257"/>
insult and invasion: but whether such a mighty arma∣ment
was necessary for the accomplishment of these petty
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ims, and whether the same armament might not have
been employed in executing schemes of infinitely greater
advantage to the nation, we shall leave to the judicious
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eader's own reflection.</P>
<P>§ XLVIII. The designs upon the coast of France,
though interrupted by tempestuous weather, were not
as yet laid aside for the whole season; but, in the mean
time, the troops were disembarked on the Isle of Wight;
and one brigade marched to the northward, to join a body
of troops with which the government resolved to augment
the army of the allies in Germany, commanded by Prince
Ferdinand of Brunswick. The Duke of Marlborough
and Lord George Sackville being appointed to conduct
this British corps upon the continent, the command of the
marine expeditions devolved to Lieutenant-General Bligh,
an old experienced officer, who had served with reputation;
and his royal highness Prince Edward, afterwards created
Duke of York, entered as a volunteer with Commodore
Howe, in order to learn the rudiments of the sea service.
The remainder of the troops being re-embarked, and every
thing prepared for the second expedition, the fleet sailed
from St. Helen's on the first of August; and after a tedious
passage from calms and contrary winds, anchored on the
seventh in the bay of Cherbourg. By this time the enemy
had entrenched themselves within a line, extending from
the fort Ecoeurdeville, which stands about two miles to
the westward of Cherbourg, along the coast for the space
of four miles, forti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied with several batteries at proper
distances. Behind this retrenchment a body of horse and
infantry appeared in red and blue uniforms; but as they
did not advance to the open beach, the less risque was run
in landing the British forces. At first a bomb-ketch had
been sent to anchor near the town, and throw some shells
into the place, as a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eint to amuse the enemy, and deceive
them with regard to the place of disembarkation, while
the general had determined to land about a league to the
<PB N="254" REF="258"/>
westward of Querqueville, the most western fort in the
bay. The other bomb-ketches, being posted along shor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
did considerable execution upon the entrenchments, n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
only by throwing shells in the usual way, but also <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
using ball-mortars, filled with great quantities of bal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
which may be thrown to a great distance, and, by scatte∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
as they fly, do abundance of mischief. While the
ketches fired without ceasing, the greanadiers and guar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were rowed regularly ashore in the flat-bottomed boat
and, landing without opposition, instantly formed on
small open portion of the beach, with a natural breaf
work in their front, having on the other side a hollo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
way, and a village rising beyond it with a suddent ascen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on the left, the ground was intersected by hedges, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
covered with orchards, and from this quarter the ene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
advanced in order. The British troops immediately qui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted the breast-work, in order to meet them half way, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a straggling fire began; but the French edging to the lef<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
took possession of the hill, from whence they piqueere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with the advanced posts of the English. In the mean tim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the rest of the infantry were disembarked, and the ene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
at night retired. As the light troops were not yet lande<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
General Bligh encamped that night at the village of Ervill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on a piece of ground that did not extend above four hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
dred paces; so that the tents were pitched in a crowde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and irregular manner. Next morning, the general havin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
received intelligence that no parties of the enemy we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
seen moving on the hill, or in the plain, and that Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Querqueville was entirely abandoned, made a dispositio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for marching in two columns to Cherbourg. An advance
party took immediate possession of Querqueville; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
lines and batteries along the shore were now deserted b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the enemy. The British forces marching behind St. Auln<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Ecoeurdeville, Hommet, and la Gallet, found the tow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Cherbourg likewise abandoned, and the gates bein<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
open, entered it without opposition. The citizens, en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
couraged by a manifesto containing a promise of protection
<PB N="255" REF="259"/>
which had been published and distributed, in order to quiet
their apprehensions, received their new guests with a good
grace, overwhelming them with civilities, for which they
met with a very ungrateful return; for as the bulk of the
army was not regularly encamped and superintended, the
soldiers were at liberty to indulge themselves in riot and
licentiousness. All night long they ravaged the adjacent
country without restraint; and as no guards had been
regularly placed in the streets and avenues of Cherbourg,
to prevent disorders, the town itself was not exempted
from pillage and brutality. These outrages, however,
were no sooner known, than the general took immediate
steps for putting a stop to them for the present, and
preventing all irregularities for the future. Next
morning the place being reconnoitred, he determined to
destroy, without delay, all the forts and the bason; and
the execution of this design was left to the engineers,
assisted by the officers of the fleet and artillery. Great
sums of money had been expended upon the harbour and
bason of Cherbourg, which at one time was considered
by the French court as an object of great importance,
from its situation respecting the river Seine, as well as the
opposite coast of England; but as the works were left
unfinished, in all appearance the plan had grown into dis∣reputation.
The enemy had raised several unconnected
batteries along the bay, but the town itself was quite open
and defenceless. While the engineers were employed
in demolishing the works, the light horse scoured the
country, and detachments were every day sent out towards
Walloign, at the distance of four leagues from Cherbourg,
where the enemy were encamped, and every hour received
re-enforcements. Several skirmishes were fought by the
out parties of each army, in one of which Capt. Lindsay,
a gallant young officer, who had been very instrumental
in training the light horse, was mortally wounded. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
harbour and bason of Cherbourg being destroyed, together
with all the forts in the neighbourhood, and about twenty
pieces of brass cannon secured on board the English ships<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="256" REF="260"/>
a contribution, amounting to about three thousand pounds
sterling, was exacted upon the town, and a plan of re∣embarkation
concerted, as it appeared from the reports of
peasants and deserters that the enemy were already in∣creased
to a formidable number. A slight entrenchment
being raised, sufficient to defeat the last division that
should be re-embarked, the stores and artillery were ship∣ped,
and the light horses conveyed on board their re∣spective
transports, by means of platforms laid in the
flat-bottomed vessels. On the sixteenth day of August,
at three o'clock in the morning, the forces marched from
Cherbourg down to the beach, and re-embarked at Fort
Galet, without the least disturbance from the enemy.</P>
<P>§ XLIX. This service being happily performed, the
fleet set sail for the coast of England, and anchored in the
road of Weymouth, under the high land of Portland.
In two days it weighed and stood again to the southward;
but was obliged, by contrary winds, to return to the same
riding. The second effort, however, was more effectual.
The fleet with some difficulty kept the sea, and steering
to the French coast, came to anchor in the bay of St.
Lunaire, two leagues to the westward of St. Maloes,
against which it was determined to make another attempt.
The sloops and ketches being ranged along shore to cover
the disembarkation, the troops landed on a fair open
beach, and a detachment of grenadiers was sent to the
harbour of St. Briac, above the town of St. Maloes, where
they destroyed about fifteen small vessels: but St. Maloes
itself being properly sureveyed, appeared to be above insult,
either from the land-forces or the shipping. The mouth
of the river that forms its bason extends above two miles
in breadth at its narrowest part, so as to be out of the
reach of land-batteries, and the entrance is defended by
such forts and batteries as the ships of war could not pre∣tend
to silence, considering the difficult navigation of the
channel: besides fifty pieces of large cannon planted on
these forts and batteries, the enemy had mounted forty on
the west side of the town; and the bason was, moreover,
<PB N="257" REF="261"/>
strengthened by seven frigates or armed vessels, whose
guns might have been brought to bear upon any batteries
that could be raised on shore, as well as upon ships entering
by the usual channel. For these substantial reasons the
design against St. Maloes was dropped; but the general be∣ing
unwilling to re-embark without having taken some
step for the further annoyance of the enemy, resolved to
penetrate into the country, conducting his motions, how∣ever,
so as to be near the fleet, which had, by this time,
quitted the bay of St. Lunaire, where it could not ride
with any safety, and anchored in the bay of St. Cas,
about three leagues to the westward.</P>
<P>§ L. On Friday the eighth of September, General Bligh,
with his little army, began his march for Guildo, at the
distance of nine miles, which he reached in the evening:
next day he crossed a little gut or inlet of the sea, at low
water, and his troops being incommoded by the peasants,
who fired at them from hedges and houses, he sent a priest
with a message, intimating, that if they would not desist,
he would reduce their houses to ashes. No regard being
paid to this intimation, the houses were actually set on
fire as soon as the troops had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed their camp about two
miles on the other side of the inlet. Next morning he
proceeded to the village of Matignon, where, after some
smart skirmishing, the French piquets appeared, drawn
up in order, to the number of two battalions; but having
sustained a few shot from the English field-pieces, and
seeing the grenadiers advance, they suddenly dispersed.
General Bligh continuing his route through the village,
encamped in the open ground, about three miles from the
bay of St. Cas, which was this day reconnoitred for re-embarkation:
for he now received undoubted intelligence,
that the Duke d'Aiguillon had advanced from Brest to
Lambale, within six miles of the English camp, at the
head of twelve regular battalions, six squadrons, two
regiments of militia, eight mortars, and ten pieces of
cannon. The bay of St. Cas was covered by an entrench∣ment
which the enemy had thrown up, to prevent or
<PB N="258" REF="262"/>
oppose any disembarkation; and on the outside of this
work there was a range of sand-hills extending along
shore, which could have served as a cover to the enemy,
from whence they might have annoyed the troops in re-embarking:
for this reason a proposal was made to the
General, that the forces should be re-embarked from a
fair open beach on the left, between St. Cas and Guildo;
but this advice was rejected, and, indeed, the subsequent
operations of the army favoured strong of blind security
and rash presumption. Had the troops decamped in the
night without noise, in all probability they would have
arrived at the beach before the French had received the
least intelligence of their motion; and, in that case, the
whole army, consisting of about six thousand men, might
have been re-embarked without the least interruption: but,
instead of this cautious manner of proceeding, the drums
were beating at two o'clock in the morning, as if with in∣tention
to give notice to the enemy, who forthwith re∣peated
the same signal. The troops were in motion before
three, and though the length of the march did not exceed
three miles, the halts and interruptions were so numerous
and frequent, that they did not arrive on the beach of St.
Cas till nine. Then the embarkation was begun, and might
have been happily finished, had the transports lain near the
shore, and received the men as fast as the boats could have
conveyed them on board, without distinction; but many
ships rode at a considerable distance, and every boat carried
the men on board their respective transports to which they
belonged; a punctilio of disposition by which a great
deal of time was unnecessarily consumed. The small ships
and bomb-ketches were brought near the shore, to cover
the re-embarkation; and a considerable number of sea-officers
was stationed on the beach, to superintend the
boats-crews, and regulate the service; but, notwithstand∣ing
all their attention and authority, some of the boats
were otherwise employed than in conveying the unhap∣py
soldiers. Had all the cutters and small craft belong∣ing
to the fleet been properly occupied in this service, the
<PB N="259" REF="263"/>
disgrace and disaster of the day would scarce have happen∣ed.
The British forces had skirmished a little on the march,
but no considerable body of the enemy appeared until the
embarkation was begun; then they took possession of an
eminence by a wind-mill, and forthwith opened a battery
of ten cannon and eight mortars, from whence they fired
with considerable effect upon the soldiers on the beach,
and on the boats in their passage. They afterwards began
to march down the hill, partly covered by a hollow-way
on their left, with design to gain a wood, where they might
form and extend themselves along the front of the English,
and advance against them under shelter of the sand-hills;
but in their descent they suffered extremely from
the cannon and mortars of the shipping, which made
great havock, and threw them into confusion. Their
line of march down the hill was staggered, and for some
time continued in suspense; then they turned off to one
side, extended themselves along a hill to their left, and
advanced in a hollow way, from whence they suddenly
rushed out to the attack. Though the greater part of the
British troops were already embarked, the rear-guard,
consisting of all the grenadiers, and half of the first regi∣ment
of guards, remained on the shore; to the number of
fifteen hundred, under the command of Major-General
Dury. This officer, seeing the French advance, ordered
his troops to form in grand divisions, and march from be∣hind
the bank that covered them, in order to charge the
enemy before they could be formed on the plain. Had
this step been taken when it was first suggested to Mr.
Dury, before the French were disengaged from the hollow
way, perhaps it might have so far succeeded as to disconcert
and throw them into confusion: but by this time they had
extended themselves into a very formidable front, and no
hope remained of being able to withstand such a superior
number. Instead of attempting to fight against such odds
in an open field of battle, they might have retreated along
the beach to a rock on the left, in which progress their
<PB N="260" REF="264"/>
right flank would have been secured by the entrenchment;
and the enemy could not have pursued them along the
shore, without being exposed to such a fire from the ship∣ping,
as in all probability they could not have sustained.
This scheme was like wise proposed to Mr. Dury; but he
seemed to be actuated by a spirit of infatuation. The
English line being drawn up in uneven ground began
the action with an irregular fire from right to left, which
the enemy returned; but their usual fortitude and reso∣lution
seemed to forsake them on this occasion. They saw
themselves in danger of being surrounded, and cut in
pieces; their officers dropped on every side; and all hope
of retreat was now intercepted. In this cruel dilemma
their spirits failed; they were seised with a panick; they
faultered, they broke, and in less than five minutes after
the engagement began they fled in the utmost confusion,
pursued by the enemy, who no sooner saw them give way
than they fell in among them with their bayonets fixed,
and made a great carnage. General Dury being dange∣rously
wounded, ran into the sea, where he perished; and
this was the fate of a great number, officers as well as
soldiers. Many swam towards the boats and vessels, which
were ordered to give them all manner of assistance; but
by far the greater number were either butchered on the
beach, or drowned in the water: a small body, however,
instead of throwing themselves into the sea, retired to the
rock on the left, where they made a stand, until they had
exhausted their ammunition, and then surrendered at dis∣cretion.
The havock was moreover increased by the shot
and shells discharged from the battery which the enemy
had raised on the hill. The slaughter would not have
been so great, had not the French soldiers been exasperat∣ed
by the fire from the frigates, which was still maintained
even after the English troops were routed: but this was no
sooner silenced by a signal from the commodore, than the
enemy exhibited a noble example of moderation and hu∣manity,
in granting immediate quarter and protection to
<PB N="261" REF="265"/>
the vanquished. About one thousand chosen men of the
English army were killed and taken prisoners on this oc∣casion:
nor was the advantage cheaply purchased by the
French troops, among whom the shot and shells from the
frigates and ketches had done great execution. The cle∣mency
of the victors was the more remarkable, as the
British troops in this expedition had been shamefully
guilty of marauding, pillaging, burning, and other ex∣cesses.
War is so dreadful in itself, and so severe in its
consequences, that the exercise of generosity and com∣passion,
by which its horrours are mitigated, ought ever
to be applauded, encouraged, and imitated. We ought
also to use our best endeavours to deserve this treatment
at the hands of a civilised enemy. Let us be humane in
our turn to those whom the fate of war hath subjected to
our power: let us, in prosecuting our military operations,
maintain the most rigid discipline among the troops, and
religiously abstain from all acts of violence and oppression.
Thus, a laudable emulation will undoubtedly ensue, and
the poweres at war vie with each other in humanity and
politeness. In other respects, the commander of an in∣vading
armament will always find his account in being
well with the common people of the country in which the
descent is made. By civil treatment and seasonable grati∣fications,
they will be encouraged to bring into the camp
regular supplies of provision and refreshment; they will
mingle with the soldiers, and even form friendships among
them; serve as guides, messengers, and interpreters; let
out their cattle for hire as draft-horses; work in their own
persons as day-labourers; discover proper fords, bridges,
roads, passes, and defiles; and, if artfully managed, com∣municate
many useful hints of intelligence. If great
care and circumspection be not exerted in maintaining dis∣cipline,
and bridling the licentious disposition of the
soldiers, such invasions will be productive of nothing but
miscarriage and disgrace: for this, at best, is but a pirati∣cal
way of carrying on war; and the troops engaged
<PB N="262" REF="266"/>
in it are, in some measure, debauched by the nature of
the service. They are crowded together in transports,
where the minute particulars of military order cannot be
observed, even though the good of the service greatly de∣pends
upon a due observance of these forms. The soldiers
grow negligent, and inattentive to cleanness and the ex∣terior
ornaments of dress: they become slovenly, slothful,
and altogether unfit for a return of duty: they are tumbled
about occasionally in ships and boats, landed and re-em∣barked
in a tumultuous manner, under a divided and dis∣orderly
command: they are accustomed to retire at the
first report of an approaching enemy, and to take shelter
on another element; nay, their small pillaging parties are
often obliged to fly before unarmed peasants. Their duty
on such occasions is the most unmanly part of a soldier's
office; namely, to ruin, ravage, and destroy. They soon
yield to the temptation of pillage, and are habituated to
rapine: they give loose to intemperance, riot, and in∣toxication;
commit a thousand excesses; and, when the
enemy appears, run on board the ships with their booty.
Thus the dignity of the service is debased: they lose all
sense of honour, and of shame: they are no longer re∣stricted
by military laws, nor over-awed by the authority
of officers; in a word, they degenerate into a species of
lawless buccaneers. From such a total relaxation of
morals and discipline, what can ensue but riot, confusion,
dishonour, and defeat? All the advantage that can be
expected from these sudden starts of invasion will scarce
over-balance the evils we have mentioned, together with
the extraordinary expense of equipping armaments of this
nature. True it is, these descents oblige the French
King to employ a considerable number of his troops for the
defence of his maritime places: they serve to ruin the trade
of his subjects, protect the navigation of Great-Britain,
and secure its coast from invasion: but these purposes
might be as effectually answered, at a much smaller ex∣pense,
by the shipping alone. Should it be judged expe∣dient,
<PB N="263" REF="267"/>
however, to prosecute this defultory kind of war,
the commanders employed in it will do well to consider,
that a descent ought never to be hazarded in an enemy's
country, without having taken proper precautions to secure
a retreat: that the severest discipline ought to be preserved
during all the operations of the campaign; that a general
ought never to disembark but upon a well-concerted plan,
nor commence his military transactions without some im∣mediate
point or object in view; that a re-embarkation
ought never to be attempted, except from a clear open
beach, where the approaches of an enemy may be seen,
and the troops covered by the fire of their shipping.
Those who presumed to reflect upon the particulars of this
last expedition owned themselves at a loss to account for
the conduct of the general, in remaining on shore after the
design upon St. Maloes was laid aside; in penetrating so
far into the country, without any visible object; neglect∣ing
the repeated intelligence which he received; commu∣nicating
by beat of drum his midnight motions to an ene∣my
of double his force; loitering near seven hours in a
march of three miles; and, lastly, attempting the re-embar∣kation
of the troops at a place where no proper measures had
been taken for their cover and defence. After the action
of St. Cas, some civilities, by message, passed between the
Duke d'Aiguillon and the English commanders, who were
favoured with a list of the prisoners, including four sea-captains;
and assured that the wounded should receive all
possible comfort and assistance. These matters being ad∣justed,
Commodore Howe returned with the fleet to Spit-head,
and the soldiers were disembarked.</P>
<P>§ LI. The success of the attempt upon Cherbourg had
elevated the people to a degree of childish triumph; and
the government thought proper to indulge this petulant
spirit of exultation, by exposing twenty-one pieces of
French cannon in Hyde-park, from whence they were
drawn in procession to the Tower, amidst the acclamations
of the populace. From this pinnacle of elation and pride
<PB N="264" REF="268"/>
they were precipitated to the abyss of despondence or de∣jection,
by the account of the miscarriage at St. Cas,
which buoyed up the spirits of the French in the same
proportion. The people of that nation began to stand in
need of some such cordial after the losses they had sus∣tained,
and the ministry of Versailles did not fail to make
the most of this advantage: they published a pompous
narrative of the battle at St. Cas, and magnified into a
mighty victory the puny cheek which they had given to
the rear-guard of an inconsiderable detachment. The
people received it with implicit belief, because it was
agreeable to their passions, and congratulated themselves
upon their success in hyperboles, dictated by that vivacity
so peculiar to the French nation. Indeed these are artifi∣ces
which the ministers of every nation find it necessary to
use at certain conjunctures, in governing the turbulent
and capricious multitude. After the misfortune at St. Cas,
nothing further was attempted by that armament; no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was any enterprise of importance atchieved by the British
ships in Europe during the course of this summer. The
cruisers, however, still continued active and alert. Cap∣tain
Hervey, in the ship Monmouth, destroyed a French
ship of forty guns in the island of Malta; an exploit
of which the Maltese loudly complained, as a violation
of their neutrality. About twenty sail of small French
vessels were driven a shore on the rocks of Bretagne,
by some cruisers belonging to the fleet commanded by
Lord Anson, after a smart engagement with two frigates,
under whose convoy they sailed. In the month of No∣vember
the Belliqueux, a French ship of war, mounted
with sixty-four guns, having, by mistake, run up St.
George's channel, and anchored in Lundy-road, Captain
Saumarez, of the Antelope, then lying in King-road,
immediately weighed and went in quest of her, according
to the advice he had received. When he appeared, the
French captain heaved up his anchor, and made a show of
preparing for an engagement; but soon hauled down his
<PB N="265" REF="269"/>
colours, and without firing a shot surrendered, with a
complement of four hundred and seventeen men, to a ship
of inferior force, both in number of hands and weight of
metal.—By this time the English privateers swarmed to
such a degree in the channel, that scarce a French vessel
durst quit the harbour, and consequently there was little or
no booty to be obtained. In this dearth of legal prizes,
some of the adventurers were tempted to commit acts of
piracy, and actually rifled the ships of neutral nations. A
Dutch vessel, having on board the baggage and domesticks
belonging to the Marquis de Pignatelli, ambassadour from
the court of Spain to the King of Denmark, was boarded
three times successively by the crews of three different pri∣vateers,
who forced the hatches, rummaged the hold,
broke open and rifled the trunks and boxes of the ambassa∣dour,
insulted and even cruelly bruised his officers, stripped
his domesticks, and carried off his effects, together with
letters of credit, and a bill of exchange. Complaints of
these outrages being made to the court of London, the
lords of the Admiralty promised, in the Gazette, a reward
of five hundred pounds, without deduction, to any person
who should discover the offenders concerned in these acts
of piracy. Some of them were detected accordingly, and
brought to condign punishment.</P>
<P>§ LII. The Dutch had for some time carried on a very
considerable traffick, not only in taking the fair advan∣tages
of their neutrality, but also in supplying the French
with naval stores, and transporting the produce of the
French sugar-colonies to Europe, as carriers hired by the
proprietors. The English government, incensed at this
unfair commerce, prosecuted with such flagrant partiality
for their enemies, issued orders for the cruisers to arrest all
ships of neutral powers that should have French property
on board; and these orders were executed with rigour and
severity. A great number of Dutch ships were taken,
and condemned as legal prizes, both in England and Ja∣maica:
sometimes the owners met with hard measure,
<PB N="266" REF="270"/>
and some crews were treated with insolence and barbarity.
The subjects of the United Provinces raised a loud cla∣mour
against the English, for having by these captured
violated the law of nations, and the particular treaty o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
commerce subsisting between Great-Britain and the Re∣publick.
Remonstrances were made to the English mini∣stry,
who expostulated in their turn with the deputies o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the States-General; and the two nations were inflamed
against each other with the most bitter animosity. The
British resident at the Hague, in a conference with the
States, represented, that the King his master could n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
hope to see peace speedily re-established, if the neutra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
princes should assume a right of carrying on the trade o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his enemies: that he expected, from their known justice<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and the alliance by which they were so nearly connecte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with his subjects, they would honestly abandon this fraud
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dulent commerce, and agree that naval stores should b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
comprehended in the class of contraband commodities▪
He answered some articles of the complaints they had mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with an appearance of candour and moderation; declare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his Majesty's abhorrence of the violences which had been
committed upon the subjects of the United Provinces; ex∣plained
the steps which had been taken by the English go∣vernment
to bring the offenders to justice, as well as to
prevent such outrages for the future; and assured them<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that his Britannick Majesty had nothing more at hear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
than to renew and maintain, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull force, the mutu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
confidence and friendship by which the maritime power
of England and Holland had been so long united.</P>
<P>§ LIII. These professions of esteem and affection we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
not sufficient to quiet the minds and appease the resent men<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of the Dutch merchants; and the French party, which
was both numerous and powerful, employed all their a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and influence to exasperate their passions, and widen th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
breach between the two nations. The court of Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>saille
did not fail to seise this opportunity of insinuation while
on one hand, their ministers and emissaries in Holland ex∣aggerated
<PB N="267" REF="271"/>
the indignities and injuries which the States had
sustained, from the insolence and rapacity of the English;
they, on the other hand, flattered and cajoled them with
little advantages in trade, and formal professions of respect.
Such was the memorial delivered by the Count D'Affry,
intimating that the Empress-Queen being under an abso∣lute
necessity of employing all her forces to defend her
hereditary dominions in Germany, she had been obliged to
withdraw her troops from Ostend and Nieuport; and ap∣plied
to the French King, as her ally nearest at hand, to
garrison these two places, which, however, should be
restored at the peace, or sooner, should her Imperial Ma∣jesty
think proper. The spirit of the Dutch merchants at
this juncture, and their sentiments with respect to Eng∣land,
appeared with very high colouring in a memorial to
the States-General, subscribed by two hundred and sixty-nine
traders, composed and presented with equal secresy
and circumspection. In this famous remonstrance they
complained, that the violences and unjust depredations
committed by the English ships of war and privateers on
the vessels and effects of them and their fellow-subjects
were not only continued, but daily multiplied; and
cruelty and excess carried to such a pitch of wanton bar∣barity,
that the petitioners were forced to implore the
assistance of their High Mightinesses to protect, in the
most efficacious manner, the commerce and navigation,
which were the two sinews of the republic. For this
necessary purpose they offered to contribute each his con∣tingent,
and to arm at their own charge; and other propo∣sitions
were made for an immediate augmentation of the
marine. While this party industriously exerted all their
power and credit to effect a rupture with England, the
Princess Gouvernante employed all her interest and
address to divert them from this object, and alarm them
with respect to the power and designs of France; against
which she earnestly exhorted them to augment their mili∣tary
forces by land, that they might be prepared to defend
<PB N="268" REF="272"/>
themselves against all invasion. At the same time, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
spared no pains to adjust the differences between he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
husband's country and her father's kingdom; and, with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
out doubt, her healing councils were of great efficacy i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
preventing matters from coming to a very dangerous ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tremity.</P>

<P>§ I. THE whole strength of Great-Britain during
this campaign was not exhausted in petty de∣scents
upon the coast of France. The continent of Ame∣rica
was the great theatre on which her chief vigour was
displayed; nor did she fail to exert herself in successful
efforts against the French settlements on the coast of Africa.
The whole gum trade, from Cape Blanco to the river
Gambia, an extent of five hundred miles, had been en∣grossed
by the French, who built Fort Louis within the
mouth of the Senegal, extending their factories near three
hundred leagues up that river, and on the same coast had
fortified the island of Goree, in which they maintained a
considerable garrison. The gum-senega, of which a great
quantity is used by the manufacturers of England, being
wholly in the hands of the enemy, the English dealers
were obliged to buy it at second hand from the Dutch,
who purchased it of the French, and exacted an exorbitant
<PB N="271" REF="275"/>
price for that commodity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX.</NOTE> This consideration forwarded
the plan for annexing the country to the possession of
Great Britain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1758.</NOTE> The project was first conceived by Mr.
Thomas Cumming, a sensible quaker, who, as a private
merchant, had made a voyage to Portenderrick, an adjoin∣ing
part of the coast, and contracted a personal acquaint∣ance
with Amir, the Moorish King of Legibelli<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The names the natives give to that part of South Barbary, known to merchants and navigators by that of The Gum Coast, and called in maps The Sandy Desert of Sara, and sometimes Zara.</NOTE>.
He found this African prince extremely well disposed to∣wards
the subjects of Great Britain, whom he publickly
preferred to all other Europeans, and so exasperated
against the French, that he declared he should never be
easy till they were exterminated from the river Senegal.
At that very time he had commenced hostilities against
them, and earnestly desired that the King of England
would send out an armament to reduce Fort-Louis and
Goree, with some ships of force to protect the traders. In
that case, he promised to join his Britannick majesty's
forces, and grant an exclusive trade to his subjects. Mr.
Cumming not only perceived the advantages that would
result from such an exclusive privilege with regard to the
gum, but foresaw many other important consequences of
an extensive trade in a country, which, over and above the
gum-senega, contains many valuable articles, such as
gold-dust, elephants teeth, hides, cotton, bees-wax,
slaves, ostrich feathers, indigo, ambergris, and civet.
Elevated with the prospect of an acquisition so valuable
to his country, this honest quaker was equally minute and
indefatigable in his enquiries touching the commerce of
the coast, as well as the strength and situation of the French
settlements on the river Senegal; and, at his return to
England, actually formed the plan of an expedition for the
conquest of Fort-Louis. This was presented to the board
of trade, by whom it was approved, after a severe exami∣nation;
but it required the patriotic zeal and invincible
perseverance of Cumming to surmount a variety of obsta∣cles
<PB N="272" REF="276"/>
before it was adopted by the ministry; and even the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it was not executed in its full extent. He was abridge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of one large ship, and in lieu of six hundred land forces
to be drafted from different regiments, which he i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
vain demanded, first from the Duke of Cumberland, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
afterwards from Lord Ligonier, the lords of the Admisralty
allotted two hundred marines only for this service
After repeated sollicitations he, in the year one thousan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
seven hundred and fifty-seven, obtained an order, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
two annual ships bound to the coast of Guinea should b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
joined by a sloop and two busses, and make an attemp
upon the French settlement in the river Senegal. Thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ships, however, were detained by contrary winds until th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
season was too far advanced to admit a probability of suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cess,
and therefore the design was postponed. In th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
beginning of the present year, Mr. Cumming being re-enforced
with the interest of a considerable merchant i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the city, to whom he had communicated the plan, renewe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his application to the ministry, and they resolved to hazar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the enterprise. A small squadron was equipped for thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
expedition, under the command of Captain Marsh, having
on board a body of marines, commanded by Major Mason
with a detachment of artillery, ten pieces of cannon, eight
mortars, and a considerable quantity of warlike stores and
ammunition. Captain Walker was appointed engineer
and Mr. Cumming was concerned as a principal director
and promoter of the expedition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On this occasion Mr. Cumming may seem to have acted directly contrary to the tenets of his religious profession; but he ever declared to the ministry that he was fully persuaded his schemes might be accomplished without th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> effusion of human blood; and that if he thought otherwise, he would by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> means have concerned himself about them. He also desired, let the conse∣quence be what it might, his brethren should not be chargeable with wha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was his own single act.—If it was the first military scheme of any Quaker, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it be remembered it was also the first successful expedition of this war, and one of the first that ever was carried on according to the pacifick system o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Quakers, without the loss of a drop of blood on either side.</NOTE>. This little armament
sailed in the beginning of March; and in their passage
touched at the island Tenerisse, where, while the ships
<PB N="273" REF="277"/>
supplied themselves with wine and water, Mr. Cumming
proceeded in the Swan sloop to Portenderrick, being
charged with a letter of credence to his old friend the king
of that country, who had favoured him in his last visit with
an exclusive trade on that coast, by a formal charter,
written in the Arabick language. This prince was now up
the country, engaged in a war with his neighbours, called
the Diable-Moors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the name by which the subjects of Legibelli distinguish those of Brackna, who inhabit the country farther up the river Senegal, and are in constant alliance with the French.</NOTE>; and the Queen-Dowager, who re∣mained
at Portenderrick, gave Mr. Cumming to under∣stand,
that she could not at present spare any troops to
join the English in their expedition against Senegal: but
she assured him, that should the French be exterminated,
she and her subjects would go thither and settle. In the
mean time, one of the chiefs, called Prince Amir, di∣spatched
a messenger to the King, with advice of their ar∣rival
and design. He declared that he would, with all
possible diligence, assemble three hundred warriors to join
the English troops, and that, in his opinion, the King
would re-enforce them with a detachment from his army.
By this time Captain Marsh, with the rest of the arma∣ment,
had arrived at Portenderrick, and fearing that the
enemy might receive intimation of his design, resolved to
proceed on the expedition, without waiting for the pro∣mised
auxiliaries. On the twenty-second day of April he
weighed anchor, and next day, at four o'clock, discovered
the French flag slying upon Fort-Louis, situated in the
midst of a pretty considerable town, which exhibited a
very agreeable appearance. The Commodore having made
prize of a Dutch ship richly laden with gum, which lay
at anchor without the bar, came to anchor in Senegal-road,
at the mouth of the river; and here he perceived
several armed sloops which the enemy had detached to de∣fend
the passage of the bar, which is extremely dangerous.
All the boasts were employed in conveying the stores into
the small craft, while three of the sloops continued ex∣changing
<PB N="274" REF="278"/>
fire over a narrow tongue of land with the ves∣sels
of the enemy, consisting of one brig and six armed
sloops, mounted with great guns and swivels. At length,
the channel being discovered, and the wind, which ge∣nerally
blows down the river, chopping about, Captain
Millar, of the London Buss, seised that opportunity; and
passing the bar with a flowing sheet, dropped anchor on
the inside, where he lay till night, exposed to the whole
fire of the enemy. Next day he was joined by the other
small vessels, and a regular engagement ensued. This
was warmly maintained on both sides, until the busses
and one dogger running a-ground, immediately bulged,
and were filled with water. Then the troops they con∣tained
took to their boats, and with some difficulty reached
the shore, where they formed in a body, and were soon
joined by their companions from the other vessels; so
that now the whole amounted to three hundred and ninety
marines, besides the detachment of artillery. As they
laid their account with being attacked by the natives, who
lined the shore at some distance, seemingly determined to
oppose the descent, they forthwith threw up an entrench∣ment,
and began to disembark the stores, great part of
which lay under water. While they were employed in
raising this occasional defence, the negroes came in great
numbers and submitted; and on the succeeding day they
were re-enforced by three hundred and fifty seamen, who
passed the bar in sloops, with their ensigns and colours
flying.</P>
<P>§ II. They had made no further progress in their opera∣tions,
when two French deputies arrived at the entrench∣ment,
with proposals for a capitulation from the governour
of Fort-Louis. After some hesitation, Captain Marsh and
Major Mason agreed, That all the white people belonging
to the French company at Senegal should be safely con∣ducted
to France in an English vessel, without being de∣prived
of their private effects, provided all the merchan∣dise
and uncoined treasure should be delivered up to the
<PB N="275" REF="279"/>
victors; and that all the forts, store-houses, vessels, arms,
provisions, and every article belonging to the company
in that river should be put into the hands of the English
immediately after the capitulation could be signed. They
promised that the free natives living at Fort-Louis should
remain in quiet possession of their effects, and in the free
exercise of their religion; and that all negroes, mulattoes,
and others, who could prove themselves free, should have
it in their option either to remain in the place, or remove
to any other part of the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The victors, however, committed a very great mistake in allowing them to carry off their books and accounts, the perusal of which would have been of insinite service to the English merchants, by informing them of the com∣modities, their value, the proper seasons, and methods of prosecuting the trade.</NOTE>. The Captains Camp∣bell
and Walker were immediately sent up the river with a
flag of truce, to see the articles signed and executed; but
they were so retarded by the rapidity of the stream, that
they did not approach the fort till three in the morning.
As soon as the day broke they hoisted their flag, and rowed
up towards a battery on a point of the island, where they
lay upon their oars very near a full hour, beating the cha∣made;
but no notice was taken of their approach. This
reserve appearing mysterious, they retired down the river
to their entrenchment, where they understood that the
negroes on the island were in arms, and had blocked up
the French in Fort-Louis, resolving to defend the place to
the last extremity, unless they should be included in the
capitulation. This intelligence was communicated in a
second letter from the governor, who likewise informed
the English commander, that unless the French director-general
should be permitted to remain with the natives, as
a surety for that article of the capitulation in which they
were concerned, they would allow themselves to be cut in
pieces rather than submit. This request being granted,
the English forces began their march to Fort-Louis, ac∣companied
by a number of long boats, in which the artil∣lery
and stores had been embarked. The French seeing
them advance immediately struck their flag: and Major
<PB N="276" REF="280"/>
Mason took possession of the castle, where he found ninety-two
pieces of cannon, with treasure and merchandise to a
considerable value. The corporation and burghers of the
town of Senegal submitted, and swore allegiance to his
Britannick Majesty: the neighbouring princes, attended
by numerous retinues, visited the commander, and con∣cluded
treaties with the English nation, and the King of
Portenderrick, or Legibelli, sent an ambassador from his
camp to Major Mason, with presents, compliments of con∣gratulation,
and assurances of friendship. The number
of free independent Negroes and Mulattoes settled at
Senegal amounted to three thousand, and many of these
enjoyed slaves and possessions of their own. The two
French factories of Podore and Galam, the latter situated
nine hundred miles farther up the river, were included in
the capitulation; so that Great Britain, almost without
striking a blow, found herself possessed of a conquest,
from which, with proper management, she may derive in∣conceivable
riches. This important acquisition was in a
great measure, if not entirely, owing to the sagacity, zeal,
and indefatigable efforts of Mr. Cumming, who not only
formed the plan, and sollicited the armament, but also at∣tended
the execution of it in person, at the hazard of his
life, and to the interruption of his private concerns.</P>
<P>§ III. Fort-Louis being secured with an English gar∣rison,
and some armed vessels left to guard the passage of the
bar, at the mouth of the river, the great ships proceeded to
make an attempt upon the island of Goree, which lies at
the distance of thirty leagues from Senegal. There the
French company had considerable magazines and ware-houses,
and lodged the negro slaves until they could be
shipped for the West-Indies. If the additional force which
Mr. Cumming proposed for the conquest of this island
had been added to the armament, in all probability the
island would have been reduced, and in that case, the na∣tion
would have saved the considerable expense of a subse∣quent
expedition against it, under the conduct of Commo∣dore
<PB N="277" REF="281"/>
Keppel. At present, the ships by which Go∣ree
was attacked were found unequal to the attempt,
and the expedition miscarried accordingly, though the
miscarriage was attended with little or no damage to the
assailants.</P>
<P>§ IV. Scenes of still greater importance were acted in
North-America, where, exclusive of the fleet and marines,
the government had assembled about fifty thousand men,
including two-and-twenty thousand regular troops. The
Earl of Loudoun having returned to England, the chief
command in America devolved on Major-General Aber∣crombie;
but as the objects of operation were various, the
forces were divided into three detached bodies, under as
many different commanders. About twelve thousand were
destined to undertake the siege of Louisbourg, on the island
of Cape-Breton. The general himself reserved near sixteen
thousand for the reduction of Crown-Point, a fort situated
on lake Champlain: eight thousand, under the conduct of
Brigadier-General Forbes, were allotted for the conquest
of Fort du Quesne, which stood a great way to the south∣ward,
near the river Ohio; and a considerable garrison
was left at Annapolis, in Nova-Scotia. The reduction of
Louisbourg and the island of Cape-Breton being an object
of immediate consideration, was undertaken with all
possible dispatch. Major-General Amherst being joined
by Admiral Boscawen, with the fleet and forces from Eng∣land,
the whole armament, consisting of one hundred and
fifty-seven sail, took their departure from the harbour of
Halisax, in Nova-Scotia, on the twenty-eighth of May,
and on the second of June part of the transports anchored
in the bay of Gabarus, about seven miles to the westward
of Louisbourg. The garrison of this place, commanded
by the Chevalier Drucour, consisted of two thousand five
hundred regular troops, three hundred militia, formed of
the burghers, and towards the end of the siege they were
re-enforced by three hundred and fifty Canadians, in∣cluding
three score Indians. The harbour was secured
<PB N="278" REF="282"/>
by six ships of the line<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Prudent, of seventy-four guns; the Entreprenant, of seventy-four guns; the Capricieux, Celebre, and Biensaisant, of sixty-four guns each; the Apollo, of fifty guns; the Chevre, Biche, Fidelle, Diana, and Echo frigates.</NOTE>, and five frigates, three of which
the enemy sunk across the harbour's mouth, in order to
render it inaccessible to the English shipping. The forti∣fications
were in bad repair, many parts of them crumb∣ling
down the covered way, and several bastions exposed in
such a manner as to be enfiladed by the besiegers, and no
part of the town secure from the effects of cannonading
and bombardment. The governor had taken all the
precautions in his power t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prevent a landing, by establish∣ing
a chain of posts, that extended two leagues and a half
along the most accessible parts of the beach: entrench∣ments
being thrown up, and batteries erected; but
there were some intermediate places which could not be
properly secured, and in one of these the English troops
were disembarked, The disposition being made for land∣ing,
a detachment, in several sloops, under convoy, passed
by the mouth of the harbour towards Lorembec, in order
to draw the enemy's attention that way, while the landing
should really be effected on the other side of the town.
On the eighth day of June, the troops being assembled in
the boats before day-break, in three divisions, several
sloops and frigates, that were stationed along shore in the
bay of Gabarus, began to scour the beach with their shot;
and after the fire had continued about a quarter of an hour,
the boats, containing the division on the left, were rowed
towards the shore, under the command of Brigadier-Ge∣neral
Wolfe, an accomplished officer, who, in the sequel,
displayed very extraordinary proofs of military genius. At
the same time the two other divisions, on the right and in
the centre, commanded by the Brigadiers Whitmore and
Laurence, made a show of landing, in order to divide and
distract the enemy. Notwithstanding an impetuous surf,
by which many boats were overset, and a very severe fire of
cannon and musketry from the enemy's batteries, which
<PB N="279" REF="283"/>
did considerable execution, Brigadier Wolfe pursued his
point with admirable courage and deliberation. The sol∣diers
leaped into the water with the most eager alacrity,
and, gaining the shore, attacked the enemy in such a man∣ner,
that in a few minutes they abandoned their works and
artillery, and fled in the utmost confusion. The other
divisions landed also, but not without an obstinate oppo∣sition;
and the stores, with the artillery, being brought
on shore, the town of Louisbourg was formally invested.
The difficulty of landing stores and implements in boister∣ous
weather, and the nature of the ground, which, being
marshy, was unfit for the conveyance of heavy cannon, re∣tarded
the operations of the siege. Mr. Amherst made
his approaches with great circumspection, securing his
camp with redoubts and epaulements from any attacks of
Canadians, of which he imagined there was a considerable
body behind him on the island, as well as from the fire of
the French shipping in the harbour, which would other∣wise
have annoyed him extremely in his advances.</P>
<P>§ V. The governor of Louisbourg having destroyed
the grand battery, which was detached from the body of
the place, and recalled his out-posts, prepared for making
a vigorous defence. A very severe fire, well directed, was
maintained against the besiegers and their works, from the
town, the island battery, and the ships in the harbour;
and divers sallies were made, though without much effect.
In the mean time Brigadier Wolfe, with a strong detach∣ment,
had marched round the north-east part of the har∣bour,
and taken possession of the Lighthouse-point, where
he erected several batteries against the ships and the island
fortification, which last was soon silenced. On the nine∣teenth
day of June the Echo, a French frigate, was taken
by the English cruisers, after having escaped from the har∣bour:
from the officers on board of this ship the Admiral
learned that the Bizarre, another frigate, had sailed from
thence on the day of the disembarkation, and the Comete
had successfully followed her example. Besides the regu∣lar
approaches to the town, conducted by the engineers
<PB N="280" REF="284"/>
under the immediate command and inspection of General
Amherst, divers batteries were raised by the detached corps
under Brigadier Wolfe, who exerted himself with amazing
activity, and grievously incommoded the enemy, both of the
town and the shipping. On the twenty-first day of July
the three great ships, the Ent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eprenant, Capricieux, and
Celebre, were set on fire by a bomb-shell, and burned to
ashes, so that none remained but the Prudent and Bien∣faisant,
which the Admiral undertook to destroy. For
this purpose, in the night between the twenty-fifth and
twenty-sixth days of the month, the boats of the squadron
were in two divisions detached into the harbour, under
the command of two young captains, Laforey and Bal∣four.
They accordingly penetrated, in the dark, through
a terrible fire of cannon and musquetry, and boarded the
enemy sword in hand. The Prudent, being a-ground, was
set on fire, and destroyed, but the Bienfaisant was towed
out of the harbour in triumph. In the prosecution of the
siege, the admiral and general co-operated with remarkable
harmony; the former chearfully assisting the latter with
cannon and other implements; with detachments of ma∣rines
to maintain posts on shore, with parties of seamen to
act as pioneers, and concur in working the guns and mor∣tars.
The fire of the town was managed with equal skill
and activity, and kept up with great perseverance; until
at length, their shipping being all taken or destroyed, the
caserns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may not be amiss to observe, that a cavalier, which Admiral K—had built at an enormous expense to the nation, while Louisbourg remained in the hands of the English in the last war, was, in the course of this siege, entirely demolished by two or three shots from one of the British batteries; so admirably had this piece of fortification been contrived and executed, under the eye of that profound engineer.</NOTE> ruined in the two principal bastions, forty out of
fifty two pieces of cannon dismounted, broke, or ren∣dered
unserviceable, and divers practicable breaches ef∣fected,
the governour, in a letter to Mr. Amherst, pro∣posed
a capitulation on the same articles that were granted
to the English at Port-Mahon. In answer to this pro∣posal
he was given to understand, that he and his garrison
<PB N="281" REF="285"/>
must surrender themselves prisoners of war, otherwise he
might next morning expect a general assault by the ship∣ping
under Admiral Boscawen. The Chevalier Dru∣cour,
piqued at the severity of these terms, replied, that
he would, rather than comply with them, stand an assault;
but the commissary-general, and intendant of the colony,
presented a petition from the traders and inhabitants of the
place, in consequense of which he submitted. On the
twenty-seventh day of July three companies of grenadiers,
commanded by Major Farquhar, took possession of the
western gate; and Brigadier Whitmore was detached into
the town, to see the garrison lay down their arms and de∣liver
up their colours on the esplanade, and to post the
necessary guards on the stores, magazines, and ramparts.
Thus, at the expence of about four hundred men killed
and wounded, the English obtained possession of the im∣portant
island of Cape-Breton, and the strong town of
Louisbourg, in which the victors found two hundred and
twenty-one pieces of cannon, with eighteen mortars, and
a considerable quantity of stores and ammunition. The
merchants and inhabitants were sent to France in English
bottoms, but the garrison, together with the sea-officers,
marines, and mariners, amounting in all to five thousand
six hundred and thirty-seven prisoners, were transported to
England. The loss of Louisbourg was the more severely
felt by the French King, as it had been attended with
the destruction of so many considerable ships and frigates.
The particulars of this transaction were immediately
brought to England, in a vessel dispatched for that pur∣pose,
with Captain Amherst, brother to the commander,
who was also entrusted with eleven pair of colours taken
at Louisbourg: these were, by his Majesty's order, car∣ried
in pompous parade, escorted by detachments of horse
and foot guards, with kettle-drums and trumpets, from
the palace of Kensington to St. Paul's cathedral, where
they were deposited as trophies, under a discharge of can∣non,
and other noisy expressions of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riumph and exulta∣tion.
Indeed, the publick rejoicings for the conquest of
<PB N="282" REF="286"/>
Louisbourg were diffused through every part of the British
dominions, and addresses of congratulation were pre¦sented
to the King by a great number of flourishing town
and corporations.</P>
<P>§ VI. After the reduction of Cape-Breton, some ship
were detached, with a body of troops under the comman<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Lieutenant Colonel Lord Rollo, to take possession o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the island of St. John, which also lies in the gulf of St
Laurence, and, by its fertility in corn and cattle, had sinc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the beginning of the war supplied Quebeck with con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siderable
quantities of provision. It was likewise th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
asylum to which the French neutrals of Annapolis fle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for shelter from the English government; and the retrea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
from whence they and the Indians used to make thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sudden irruptions into Nova-Scotia, where they perpe
trated the most inhuman barbarities on the defenceless sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jects
of Great Britain. The number of inhabitant
amounted to four thousand one hundred, who submitted
and brought in their arms: then Lord Rollo took possession
of the governour's quarters, where he found several scalp
of Englishmen, whom the savages had assassinated, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
consequence of the encouragement they received from their
French patrons and allies, who gratified them with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
certain premium for every scalp they produced. The island
was stocked with above ten thousand head of black cattle
and some of the farmers raised each twelve hundred
bushels of corn annually for the market of Quebeck.</P>
<P>§ VII. The joy and satisfaction arising from the conquest
of Louisbourg and St. John was not a little checked by
the disaster which befel the main body of the British forces
in America, under the immediate conduct of General
Abercrombie, who, as we have already observed, had
proposed the reduction of the French forts on the lakes
George and Champlain, as the chief objects of his enter∣prise,
with a view to secure the frontier of the British
colonies, and open a passage for the future conquest of
Canada. In the beginning of July his forces, amount∣ing
to near seven thousand regular troops, and ten thou∣sand
<PB N="283" REF="287"/>
provincials, embarked on the lake George, in the
neighbourhood of Lake Champlain, on board of nine
hundred batteaus, and one hundred and thirty-five whale-boats,
with provision, artillery, and ammunition; several
pieces of cannon being mounted on rafts to cover the
purposed landing, which was next day effected without
opposition. The general's design was to invest Ticon∣deroga,
a fort situated on a tongue of land, extending
between Lake George and a narrow gut that communi∣cates
with Lake Champlain. This fortification was, on
three sides, surrounded with water, and in front nature
had secured it with a morass. The English troops being
disembarked, were immediately formed into three columns,
and began their march to the enemy's advanced post,
consisting of one battalion, encamped behind a breast∣work
of logs, which they now abandoned with precipi∣tation,
after having set them on fire, and burned their
tents and implements. The British forces continued their
march in the same order; but the route lying through a
thick wood that did not admit of any regular progression
or passage, and the guides proving extremely ignorant, the
troops were bewildered, and the columns broken by falling
in one upon another. Lord Howe being advanced at the
head of the right centre column, encountered a French
detachment who had likewise lost their way in the retreat
from the advanced post, and a warm skirmish ensuing, the
enemy were routed with considerable loss, a good number
were killed, and one hundred and forty-eight were taken
prisoners, including five officers. This petty advantage
was dearly bought with the loss of Lord Howe, who fell
in the beginning of the action, unspeakably regretted as a
young nobleman of the most promising talents, who had
distinguished himself in a peculiar manner by his courage,
activity, and rigid observation of military discipline, and
had acquired the esteem and affection of the soldiery by
his generosity, sweetness of manners, and engaging ad∣dress.
The general perceiving the troops were greatly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atigued and disordered from want of rest and refreshment,
<PB N="284" REF="288"/>
thought it adviseable to march back to the landing place,
which they reached about eight in the morning. Then
he detached Lieutenant-Colonel Bradstreet, with one
regular regiment, six companies of the Royal Americans,
with the batteau-men, and a body of rangers, to take
possession of a saw-mill in the neighbourhood of Ticon∣deroga,
which the enemy had abandoned. This post being
secured, the general advanced again towards Ticonderoga,
where he understood from the prisoners the enemy had
assembled eight battalions, with a body of Canadians and
Indians, amounting in all to six thousand. These, they
said, being encamped before the fort, were employed in
making a formidable entrenchment, where they intended
to wait for a re-enforcement of three thousand men, who
had been detached under the command of M. de Levi, to
make a diversion on the side of the Mohawk river<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This officer intended to have made an irruption through the pass of O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ida on the Mohawk<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> river, but was recalled before he could execute his design. General Abercrombie afterwards sent thither Brigadier Stanwir, with a considerable body of Provincials: and this important pass was se∣cured by a fort built at that juncture.</NOTE>; but
upon intelligence of Mr. Abercrombie's approach, were
now recalled for the defence of Ticonderoga. This in∣formation
determined the English general to strike, if
possible, some decisive stroke before the junction could be
effected. He, therefore, early next morning sent his
engineer across the river on the opposite side of the fort,
to reconnoitre the enemy's entrenchments, and he reported,
that the works being still unfinished, might be attempted
with a good prospect of success. A disposition was made
accordingly for the attack, and after proper guards had
been left at the saw mill and the landing-place, the whole
army was put in motion. They advanced with great
alacrity towards the entrenchment, which, however,
they sound altogether impracticable. The breast-work
was raised eight feet high, and the ground before it covered
with an abbattis, or felled trees, with their boughs point∣ing
outwards, and projecting in such a manner as to render
the entrenchment almost inaccessible. Notwithstanding
<PB N="285" REF="289"/>
these discouraging difficulties, the British troops marched
up to the assault with an undaunted resolution, and sus∣tained
a terrible fire without flinchïng. They endeavour∣ed
to cut their way through these embarrasments with
their swords, and some of them even mounted the para∣pet;
but the enemy were so well covered, that they could
deliberately direct their fire without the least danger to
themselves: the carnage was therefore considerable, and
the troops began to fall into confusion, after several re∣peated
attacks, which lasted above four hours, under the
most disadvantageous circumstances. The general, by
this time, saw plainly that no hope of success remained;
and, in order to prevent a total defeat, took measures for
the retreat of the army, which retired unmolested to their
former camp, with the loss of about eighteen hundred
men killed or wounded, including a great number of offi∣cers.
Every corps of regular troops behaved, on this un∣fortunate
occasion, with remarkable intrepidity, but the
greatest loss was sustained by Lord John Murray's High∣land
regiment, of which above one half of the private men,
and twenty-five officers, were either slain upon the spot,
or desperately wounded. Mr. Abercrombie, unwilling to
stay in the neighbourhood of the enemy with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces which
had received such a dispiriting check, retired to his bat∣teaus,
and re-embarking the troops, returned to the camp
at Lake-George, from whence he had taken his depar∣ture.
Censure, which always attends miscarriage, did not
spare the character of this commander; his attack was
condemned as rash, and his retreat as pusillanimous. In
such cases, allowance must be made for the peevishness of
disappointment, and the clamour of connexion. How
far Mr. Abercrombie acquitted himself in the duty of a
general we shall not pretend to determine; but if he could
depend upon the courage and discipline of his forces, he
surely had nothing to fear, after the action, from the
attempts of the enemy, to whom he would have been su∣perior
in number, even though they had been joined by the
expected re-enforcement: he might, therefore, have re∣mained
<PB N="286" REF="290"/>
on the spot, in order to execute some other enter∣prise
when he should be re-enforced in his turn; for
General Amherst no sooner heard of his disaster than he
returned with the troops from Cape-Breton to New Eng∣land,
after having left a strong garrison in Louisbourg.
At the head of six regiments he began his march to Al∣bany,
about the middle of September, in order to join the
forces on the lake, that they might undertake some other
service before the season should be exhausted.</P>
<P>§ VIII. In the mean time, General Abercrombie had
detached Lieutenant-Colonel Bradstreet, with a body of
three thousand men, chiefly Provincials, to execute a plan
which this officer had formed against Cadaraqui, or Fort-Frontenac,
situated on the north side of the river St. Lau∣rence,
just where it takes its origin from the Lake On∣tario.
To the side of this lake he penetrated with his
detachment, and embarking in some sloops and batteaus,
provided for the purpose, landed within a mile of Fort-Frontenac,
the garrison of which, consisting of one hun∣dred
and ten men, with a few Indians, immediately sur∣rendered
at discretion. Considering the importance of
this post, which, in a great measure, commanded the mouth
of the river St. Laurence, and served as a magazine to the
more southern castles, the French general was inexcuseable
for leaving it in such a defenceless condition. The forti∣fication
itself was inconsiderable and ill contived; never∣theless,
it contained sixty pieces of cannon, sixteen small
mortars, with an immense quantity of merchandise and
provisions, deposited for the use of the French forces de∣tached
against Brigadier Forbes, their western garrisons,
and Indian allies, as well as for the subsistence of the corps
commanded by M. de Levi, on his enterprise against the
Mohawk river. Mr. Bradstreet not only reduced the fort
without bloodshed, but also made himself master of all the
enemy's shipping on the lake, amounting to nine armed
vessels, some of which carried eighteen guns. Two of
these Mr. Bradstreet conveyed to Oswego, whither he
returned with his troops, after he had destroyed Fort-Frontenac,
<PB N="287" REF="291"/>
with all the artillery, stores, provision, and
merchandize which it contained. In consequence of this
exploit, the French troops to the southward were exposed
to the hazard of starving; but it is not easy to conceive the
general's reason for giving orders to abandon and destroy a
fort, which, if properly strengthened and sustained, might
have rendered the English masters of the Lake Ontario,
and grievously harrassed the enemy, both in their com∣merce,
and expeditions to the westward. Indeed, great
part of the Indian trade centered at Frontenac, to which
place the Indians annually repaired from all parts of America,
some of them at the distance of a thousand miles, and here
exchanged their furs for European commodities. So
much did the French traders excel the English in the art
of conciliating the affection of those savage tribes, that
great part of them, in their yearly progress to this remote
market, actually passed by the British settlement of Al∣bany,
in New-York, where they might have been supplied
with what articles they wanted much more cheap than
they could purchase them at Frontenac or Montreal: nay,
the French traders used to furnish themselves with these
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very commodities from the merchants of New-York, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound this traffick much more profitable than that of pro∣curing
the same articles from France, loaded with the
expence of a tedious and dangerous navigation, from the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a to the source of the river St. Laurence.</P>
<P>§ IX. In all probability, the destruction of Frontenac
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acilitated the expedition against Fort du Quesne, entrusted
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the conduct of Brigadier Forbes, who, with his little
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmy, began his march in the beginning of July from
Philadelphia for the river Ohio, a prodigious tract of coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry
very little known, destitute of military roads, incum∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered
with mountains, morasses, and woods, that were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmost impenetrable. It was not without incredible ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtion
of industry that he procured provisions and car∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iages
for this expedition, formed new roads, extended
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>couting parties, secured cams, and surmounted many
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther difficulties in the course of his tedious march, during
<PB N="288" REF="292"/>
which he was also harrassed by small detachments of the
enemy's Indians. Having penetrated with the main body
as far as Ray's-Town, at the distance of ninety miles
from Fort du Quesne, and advanced Colonel Bouquet,
with two thousand men, about fifty miles farther, to a place
called Lyal-Henning, this officer detached Major Grant,
at the head of eight hundred men, to reconnoitre the for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and its out-works. The enemy perceiving him approach▪
sent a body of troops against him, sufficient to surround his
whole detachment: a very severe action began, which the
English maintained with their usual courage for three
hours, against cruel odds; but at length, being overpowere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by numbers, they were obliged to give way, and retire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in disorder to Lyal-Henning, with the loss of about three
hundred men killed or taken, including Major Grant, who
was carried prisoner to Fort du Quesne, and nineteen
officers. Notwithstanding this mortifying check, Briga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dier
Forbes advanced with the army, resolved to prosecut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his operations with vigour; but the enemy, dreading th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

the continent of America: the reader will be convince<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="289" REF="293"/>
that, notwithstanding the defeat at Ticonderoga, and the
disaster of the advanced party in the neighbourhood of
Fort du Quesne, the arms of Great-Britain acquired many
important advantages; and, indeed, paved the way for the
reduction of Quebeck, and conquest of all Canada. In
the mean time, the Admirals Boscawen and Hardy, having
left a considerable squadron at Halifax, in Nova-Scotia,
returned with four ships of the line to England, where
they arrived in the beginning of November, after having
given chase to six large French ships, which they descried
to the westward of Scilly, but could not overtake or
bring to an engagement.</P>
<P>§ X. The conquest of the French settlements in the
river Senegal being deemed imperfect and incomplete,
whilst France still kept possession of the island of Goree,
the ministry of Great-Britain resolved to crown the cam∣paign
in Africa with the reduction of that fortress. For
this purpose Commodore Keppel, brother to the Earl of
Albemarle, was vested with the command of a squadron,
consisting of four ships of the line, several frigates, two
bomb-ketches, and some transports, having on board seven
hundred men of the regular troops, commanded by Colonel
Worge, and embarked in the harbour of Cork in Ireland,
from whence this whole armament took their departure on
the eleventh day of November. After a tempestuous
passage, in which they touched at the isle of Teneriffe,
they arrived at Goree in the latter end of December, and
the Commodore made a disposition for attacking this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sland, which was remarkably strong by nature, but very
indifferently fortified. Goree is a small barren island,
extending about three quarters of a mile in length, of a
triangular form; and on the south-west side rising into a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocky hill, on which the paltry fort of St. Michael is
situated. There is another, still more inconsiderable,
called St. Francis, towards the other extremity of the
island; and several batteries were raised around its sweep,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ounted with about one hundred pieces of cannon, and
four mortars. The French governour, M. de St. Jean,
<PB N="290" REF="294"/>
had great plenty of ammunition, and his garrison amounted
to about three hundred men, exclusive of as many negr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
inhabitants. The flat-bottomed boats, for disembarking
the troops, being hoisted out, and disposed along-side o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the different transports, the Commodore stationed his ship<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on the west-side of the island, and the engagement began
with a shell from one of the ketches. This was a signa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for the great ships, which poured in their broadsides with∣out
intermission, and the fire was returned with equal
vivacity from all the batteries of the island. In the course
of the action the cannonading from the ships became so
severe and terrible, that the French garrison deserted their
quarters, in spite of all the efforts of the governour, who
acquitted himself like a man of honour; but he was obliged
to strike his colours, and surrender at discretion, after a
short but warm dispute, in which the loss of the British
Commodore did not exceed one hundred men killed and
wounded. The success of the day was the more extraor∣dinary,
as the French garrison had not lost a man, except
one negro killed by the bursting of a bomb-shell, and the
number of their wounded was very inconsiderable. While
the attack lasted, the opposite shore of the continent was
lined with a concourse of negroes, assembled to view the
combat, who expressed their sentiments and surprise in
loud clamour and uncouth gesticulations, and seemed to
be impressed with awe and astonishment at the power and
execution of the British squadron. The French colours
being struck, as a signal of submission, the Commodore
sent a detachment of marines on shore, who disarmed the
garrison, and hoisted the British flag upon the castle of St.
Michael. In the mean time, the governour and the rest
of the prisoners were secured among the shipping. Thus
the important island of Goree fell into the hands of the
English, together with two trading vessels that chanced
to be at anchor in the road, and stores, money, and mer∣chandise
to the value of twenty thousand pounds. Part
of the troops being left in garrison at Goree, under the
command of Major Newton, together with three sloops
<PB N="291" REF="295"/>
for his service, the squadron being watered and refreshed
from the continent, that part of which is governed by one
of the Jalof kings, and the prisoners, with their baggage,
being dismissed in three cartel ships to France, the Com∣modore
set sail for Senegal, and re-enforced Fort-Louis
with the rest of the troops, under Colonel Worge, who
was at this juncture favoured with a visit by the King of
Legibelli: but very little pains were taken to dismiss this
potentate in good humour, or maintain the disposition he
professed to favour the commerce of Great-Britain. True
it is, he was desirous of engaging the English in his quar∣rels
with some neighbouring nations; and such engage∣ments
were cautiously and politically avoided, because it
was the interest of Great-Britain to be upon good terms
with every African prince who could promote and extend
the commerce of her subjects.</P>
<P>§ XI. Commodore Keppel having reduced Goree, and
re-enforced the garrison of Senegal, returned to England,
where all his ships arrived, after a very tempestuous voyage,
in which the squadron had been dispersed. This expe∣dition,
however successful in the main, was attended
with one misfortune, the loss of the Lichfield ship of war,
commanded by Captain Barton, which, together with one
transport and a bomb-tender, was wrecked on the coast of
Barbary, about nine leagues to the northward of Saffy, in
the dominions of Morocco. One hundred and thirty men,
including several officers, perished on this occasion; but
the captain and the rest of the company, to the number of
two hundred and twenty, made shift to reach the shore,
where they ran the risque of starving, and were cruelly
used by the natives, although a treaty of peace at that
time subsisted between Great-Britain and Morocco; nay,
they were even enslaved by the Emperor, who detained
them in captivity until they were ransomed by the British
government: so little dependence can be placed on the faith
of such barbarian princes, with whom it is even a disgrace
for any civilised nation to be in alliance, whatever com∣mercial
advantages may arise from the connexion.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="296"/>
§ XII. The incidents of the war that happened in the
West-Indies, during these occurrences, may be reduced
to a small compass. Nothing extraordinary was atchieved
in the neighbourhood of Jamaica, where Admiral Coates
commanded a small squadron, from which he detached
cruisers occasionally for the protection of the British com∣merce;
and at Antigua the trade was effectually secured
by the vigilance of Captain Tyrrel, whose courage and
activity were equal to his conduct and circumspection. In
the month of March, this gentleman, with his own ship
the Buckingham, and the Cambridge, another of the line,
demolished a fort on the island of Martinique, and destroyed
four privateers riding under its protection; but his valou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
appeared much more conspicuous in a subsequent engage∣ment,
which happened in the month of November. Be∣ing
detached on a cruise in his own ship, the Buckingham▪
by Commodore Moore, who commanded at the Leewar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Islands, he fell in with the Weazle sloop, commanded by
Captain Boles, between the islands of Montserrat and
Guadaloupe, and immediately discovered a fleet of nineteen
fail, under convoy of a French ship of war carrying seventy-four
cannon, and two large frigates. Captain Tyrrel im∣mediately
gave chase with all the sail he could carry, and
the Weazle running close to the enemy, received a whole
broadside from the large ship, which, however, she sustained
without much damage: nevertheless, Mr. Tyrrel ordered
her commander to keep aloof, as he could not be supposed
able to bear the shock of large metal, and he himself prepared
for the engagement. The enemy's large ship, the Flo∣rissant,
though of much greater force than the Bucking∣ham,
instead of lying-to for his coming up, made a run∣ning
fight with her stern-chase, while the two frigates
annoyed him in his course, sometimes raking him fore and
aft, and sometimes lying on his quarter. At length he
came along-side of the Florissant, within pistol shot, and
poured in a whole broadside, which did considerable
execution. The salutation was returned with equal
vivacity, and a furious engagement ensued. Captain
<PB N="293" REF="297"/>
Tyrrel was wounded in the face, and lost three fingers of
his right hand; so that, being entirely disabled, he was
obliged to delegate the command of the ship to his first
lieutenant, Mr. Marshal, who continued the battle with
great gallantry until he lost his life: then the charge
devolved to the second lieutenant, who acquitted himself
with equal honour, and sustained a desperate fight against
three ships of the enemy. The officers and crew of the
Buckingham exerted themselves with equal vigour and
deliberation, and Captain Troy, who commanded a de∣tachment
of marines on the poop, plied his small arms so
effectually, as to drive the French from their quarters. At
length confusion, terrour, and uproar prevailing on board
the Florissant, her firing ceased, and her colours were hauled
down about twilight; but her commander, perceiving
that the Buckingham was too much damaged in her rig∣ging
to pursue with any hope of success, ordered all his
sails to be set, and fled in the dark with his two consorts.
Nothing but this circumstance could have prevented a
British ship of sixty-five guns, indifferently manned in
respect to number, from taking a French ship of the line,
mounted with seventy-four pieces of cannon, provided
with seven hundred men, and assisted by two large frigates,
one of thirty-eight guns, and the other wanting two of
this number. The loss of the Buckingham, in this
action, did not exceed twenty men killed and wounded;
whereas, the number of the slain on board the Florissant
did not fall short of one hundred and eighty, and that of
her wounded is said to have exceeded three hundred. She
was so disabled in her hull, that she could hardly be kept
asloat until she reached Martinique, where she was re∣paired;
and the largest frigate, together with the loss of
forty men, received such damage as to be for some time
quite unserviceable.</P>
<P>§ XIII. In the East-Indies the transactions of the war
were chequered with a variety of success; but, on the
whole, the designs of the enemy were entirely defeated.
The French commander, M. de Bussy, had, in the year one
<PB N="294" REF="298"/>
thousand seven hundred and fifty-six, quarrelled with
Salabatzing, viceroy of Decan, because this last would
not put him in possession of the fortress of Golconda. In
the course of the next year, while the English forces were
employed in Bengal, M. de Bussy made himself master o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the British factories of Ingeram, Bandermalanka, and
Vizagapatam, and the reduction of this last l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft the ene∣my
in possession of the whole coast of Coromandel, from
Ganjam to Massulapatam. While a body of the English
company's forces, under Captain Caillaud, endeavoured to
reduce the important fortress and town of Madura, the
French, under M. D'Anteuil, invested Trichinopoly▪
Caillaud no sooner received intelligence of the danger to
which this place was exposed, than he hastened to its re∣lief,
and obliged the enemy to abandon the siege. Then
he returned to Madura, and, after an unsuccessful assault,
made himself master of it by capitulation. During these
transactions, Colonel Ford made an attempt upon the
fort of Nelloure, a strong place, at the distance of twenty-four
miles from Madras, but miscarried; and this was
also the fate of an expedition against Wandewash, under∣taken
by Colonel Aldercron. The first was repulsed in
storming the place, the other was anticipated by the French
army, which marched from Pondicherry to the relief of
the garrison. The French king had sent a considerable
re-enforcement to the East-Indies, under the command of
General Lally, an officer of Irish extraction, together with
such a number of ships as rendered the squadron of M.
d'Apché superior to that of Admiral Pococke, who had
succeeded Admiral Watson, lately deceased, in the com∣mand
of the English squadron stationed on the coast of
Coromandel, which, in the beginning of this year, was
re-enforced from England with several ships, under the
direction of Commodore Stevens. Immediately after this
junction, which was effected in the road of Madras on
the twenty-fourth day of March, Admiral Pococke, who
had already signalized himself by his courage, vigilance,
and conduct, sailed to windward, with a view to intercept
<PB N="295" REF="299"/>
the French squadron, of which he had received intelli∣gence.
In two days he descried in the road of Fort St.
David the enemy's fleet, consisting of nine ships, which
immediately stood out to sea, and formed the line of battle
a-head. The Admiral took the same precaution, and
bearing down upon M. d'Apché, the engagement began
about three in the afternoon. The French commodore,
having sustained a warm action for about two hours, bore
away with his whole fleet, and being joined by two ships,
formed a line of battle again to leeward. Admiral Pococke's
own ship, and some others, being greatly damaged in their
masts and rigging, two of his captains having misbehaved
in the action, and night coming on, he did not think it
adviseable to pursue them with all the sail he could carry;
but▪ nevertheless, he followed them at a proper distance,
standing to the south-west, in order to maintain the wea∣ther-gage,
in case he should be able to renew the action
in the morning. In this expectation, however, he was
disappointed; the enemy showed no lights, nor made any
signals that could be observed; and in the morning not
the least vestige of them appeared. Mr. Pococke, on the
supposition that they had weathered him in the night,
endeavoured to work up after them to windward, but
finding he lost ground considerably, he dropped anchor
about three leagues to the northward of Sadras, and re∣ceived
intelligence from the chief of that settlement, that
one of the largest French ships having been disabled in the
engagement, was run ashore to the southward of Alem∣parve,
where their whole squadron lay at anchor. Such
was the issue of the first action between the English and
French squadrons in the East-Indies, which, over and
above the loss of a capital ship, is said to have cost the ene∣my
about five hundred men, whereas the British admiral
did not lose one-fifth part of that number. Being dis∣satisfied
with the behaviour of three captains, he, on his
return to Madras, appointed a court-martial to enquire
into their conduct; two were dismissed from the service,
<PB N="296" REF="300"/>
and the third was sentenced to lose one year's rank as a
post-captain.</P>
<P>§ XIV. In the mean time Mr. Lally had disembarked
his troops at Pondicherry, and taking the field, imme∣diately
invested the fort of St. David, while the squadro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
blocked it up by sea. Two English ships being at anchor
in the road when the enemy arrived, their captains seeing
no possibility of escaping, ran them on shore, set them or
fire, and retired with their men into the fortress, which
however, was in a few days surrendered. A much more
resolute defence was expected from the courage and con∣duct
of Major Polier, who commanded the garrison
When he arrived at Madras he was subjected to a cour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of enquiry, which acquitted him of cowardice, but were
of opinion that the place might have held out much longer
and that the terms on which it surrendered were shameful
as the enemy were not even masters of the outward covere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
way, as they had made no breach, and had a wet ditch to
fill up and pass, before the town could have been properly
assaulted. Polier, in order to wipe off this disgrace, de∣sired
to serve as a volunteer, with Colonel Draper, and
was mortally wounded in a sally at the siege of Madras▪
Admiral Pococke having, to the best of his power, re∣paired
his shattered ships, set sail again on the tenth of
May, in order to attempt the relief of Fort St. David's;
but, notwithstanding his utmost endeavours, he could not
reach it in time to be of any service. On the thirtieth day
of the month he came in sight of Pondicherry, from whence
the French squadron stood away early next morning, nor
was it in his power to come up with them, though he
made all possible efforts for that purpose. Then receiving
intelligence that Fort St. David's was surrendered to the
enemy, he returned again to Madras, in order to refresh
his squadron. On the twenty-fifth day of July, he sailed
a third time in quest of M. d'Apché, and, in two days
perceived his squadron, consisting of eight ships of the line
and a frigate, at anchor in the road of Pondicherry. They
no sooner descried him advancing than they stood out to
<PB N="297" REF="301"/>
sea as before, and he continued to chase, in hopes of
bringing them to an engagement; but all his endeavours
proved fruitless till the third day of August, when having
obtained the weather-gage, he bore down upon them in
order of battle. The engagement began with great impe∣tuosity
on both sides, but in little more than ten minutes
M. d'Apché set his fore-sail, and bore away, his whole
squadron following his example, and maintaining a run∣ning
fight in a very irregular line. The British Admiral
then hoisted the signal for a general chase, which the
enemy perceiving, thought proper to cut away their boats,
and crowd with all the sail they could carry. They
escaped by favour of the night into the road of Pondicherry,
and Mr. Pococke anchored with his squadron off Carical,
a French settlement, having thus obtained an undisputed
victory, with the loss of thirty men killed, and one hundred
and sixteen wounded, including Commodore Stevens and
Captain Martin, though their wounds were not dangerous.
The number of killed and wounded on board the French
squadron amounted, according to report, to five hundred
and forty; and their fleet was so much damaged, that in
the beginning of September their commodore sailed for
the island of Bourbon, in the same latitude with Madagas∣car,
in order to refit; thus leaving the command and so∣vereignty
of the Indian seas to the English admiral, whose
fleet, from the beginning of this campaign, had been much
inferior to the French squadron in number of ships and
men, as well as in weight of metal.</P>
<P>§ XV. Mr. Lally having reduced Cuddalore and Fort
St. David's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cuddalore was in such a defenceless condition, that it could make no resistance: and there being no place in Fort St. David's bomb-proof, nor any provisions or fresh water, the garrison surrendered in twelve days, on capit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lation, after having sustained a severe bombardment.</NOTE>, resolved to extort a sum of money from the
King of Tanjour, on pretence that, in the last war, he
had granted an obligation to the French governour for a
certain sum, which had never been paid. Lally accord∣ingly
marched with a body of three thousand men into the
dominions of Tanjour, and demanded seventy-two lack of
<PB N="298" REF="302"/>
rupees. The extravagant demand being rejected, he
plundered Nagare, a trading town on the sea-coast, and
afterwards invested the capital: but after he had prose∣cuted
the siege until a breach was made, his provisions and
ammunition beginning to fail, several vigorous sallies being
made by the forces of the King of Tanjour, and the place
well defended by European gunners, sent from the Eng∣lish
garrison at Trichinopoly, he found himself obliged to
raise the siege, and retreat with precipitation, leaving his
cannon behind. He arrived at Carical about the middle
of August, and from thence retired to Pondicherry to∣wards
the end of September. He afterwards cantoned
his troops in the province of Arcot, entered the city with∣out
opposition, and began to make preparations for the
siege of Madras, which shall be recorded among the inci∣dents
of the succeeding year. In the mean time, the land∣forces
belonging to the East-India company were so much
out-numbered by the re-enforcements which arrived with
Mr. Lally, that they could not pretend to keep the field,
but were obliged to remain on the defensive, and provide
as well as they could for the security of Fort St. George,
and the other settlements in that part of India.</P>
<P>§ XVI. Having particularised the events of the war
which distinguished this year in America, Africa, and
Asia, those remote scenes in which the interest of Great-Britain
was immediately and intimately concerned, it now
remains to record the incidents of the military operations
in Germany, supported by British subsidies, and enforced
by British troops, to favour the a—designs of an ally,
from whose solitary friendship the British nation can never
reap any solid benefit; and to defend a foreign el—,
in whose behalf she had already lavished an immensity of
treasure. Notwithstanding the bloodshed and ravages
which had signalised the former campaign, the mutual
losses of the belligerent powers, the incredible expense of
money, the difficulty of recruiting armies thinned by
sword and distemper, the scarcity of forage and provision,
the distresses of Saxony in particular, and the calamities of
<PB N="299" REF="303"/>
war, which desolated the greatest part of the empire, no
proposition of peace was hinted by either of the parties
concerned, but the powers at variance seemed to be ex∣asperated
against each other with the most implacable
resentment. Jarring interests were harmonised, old pre∣judices
rooted up, inveterate jealousies assuaged, and even
inconsistencies reconciled, in connecting the confederacy
which was now formed and established against the King
of Prussia; and, on the other hand, the King of Great-Britain
seemed determined to employ the whole power and
influence of his crown in supporting this monarch. Yet
the members of the grand confederacy were differently
actuated by disagreeing motives, which, in the sequel,
operated for the preservation of his Prussian Majesty, by
preventing the full exertion of their united strength. The
Empress-Queen, over and above her desire of retrieving
Silesia, which was her primary aim, gave way to the sug∣gestions
of personal hatred and revenge, to the gratifica∣tion
of which she may be said to have sacrificed, in some
measure, the interests of her family, as well as the repose
of the empire, by admitting the natural enemies of her
house into the Austrian Netherlands, and inviting them
to invade the dominions of her co-estates with a formidable
army. France, true to her old political maxims, wished
to see the house of Austria weakened by the divisions in
the empire, which she accordingly formented: for this
reason it could not be her interest to effect the ruin of the
house of Brandenburgh; and, therefore, she had, no
doubt, set bounds to the prosecution of her schemes in con∣cert
with the court of Vienna; but her designs against
Hanover amounted to absolute conquest: in pursuance
of these, she sent an army of one hundred and twenty
thousand men across the Rhine, instead of four-and-twenty
thousand, which she had engaged to furnish by the original
treaty with the Empress-Queen of Hungary, who is said
to have shared in the spoils of the electorate. The Cza∣rina,
by co-operating with the houses of Bourbon and
Austria, gratified her personal disgust towards the Prussian
<PB N="300" REF="304"/>
monarch, augmented her finances by considerable sub∣sidies
from both, and perhaps amused herself with the
hope of obtaining an establishment in the German empire;
but whether she wavered in her own sentiments, or her
ministry fluctuated between the promises of France and the
presents of Great-Britain, certain it is, her forces had not
acted with vigour in Pomerania; and her General Apraxin,
instead of prosecuting his advantage, had retreated imme∣diately
after the Prussians miscarried in their attack. He
was indeed disgraced, and tried for having thus retired with∣out
orders: but in all probability this trial was no other than
a farce, acted to amuse the other confederates, while the
Empress of Russia gained time to deliberate upon the offers
that were made, and determine with regard to the advan∣tages
or disadvantages that might accrue to her from per∣severing
in the engagements which she had contracted. As
for the Swedes, although they had been instigated to
hostilities against Prussia by the intrigues of France, and
flattered with hopes of retrieving Pomerania, they prose∣cuted
the war in such a dispirited and ineffectual manner,
as plainly proved that either the ancient valour of that
people was extinct, or that the nation was not heartily en∣gaged
in the quarrel.</P>
<P>XVII. When the Russian general Apraxin retreated
from Pomerania, Mareschal Lehwald, who commanded
the Prussians in that country, was left at liberty to turn
his arms against the Swedes, and accordingly drove them
before him almost without opposition. By the beginning
of January they had evacuated all Prussian Pomerania,
and Lehwald invaded their dominions in his turn. He, in
a little time, made himself master of all Swedish Pome∣rania,
except Stralsund and the isle of Rugen, and posses∣sed
himself of several magazines which the enemy had
erected. The Austrian army, after their defeat at Breslau,
had retired into Bohemia, where they were cantoned,
the head-quarters being fixed at Koningsgratz. The
King of Prussia having cleared all his part of Silesia,
except the town of Schweidnitz, which he circumscribed
<PB N="301" REF="305"/>
with a blockade, sent detachments from his army cantoned
in the neighbourhood of Breslau, to penetrate into the
Austrian or southern part of Silesia, where they surprised
Troppau and Jaggernsdorf, while he himself remained at
Breslau, entertaining his officers with concerts of musick.
Not that he suffered these amusements to divert his at∣tention
from subjects of greater importance. He laid
Swedish Pomerania under contribution, and made a fresh
demand of five hundred thousand crowns from the electo∣rate
of Saxony. Having received intimation that the
Duke of Mecklenbourg was employed in providing maga∣zines
for the French army, he detached a body of troops
into that country, who not only secured the magazines,
but levied considerable contributions; and the Duke re∣tired
to Lubeck, attended by the French minister. The
states of Saxony having proved a little dilatory in obeying
his Prussian Majesty's injunction, received a second inti∣mation,
importing, that they should levy and deliver,
within a certain time, eighteen thousand recruits for his
army, pay into the hands of his commissary one year's
revenue of the electorate in advance; and Leipzick was
taxed with an extraordinary subsidy of eight hundred thou∣sand
crowns, on pain of military execution. The States
were immediately convoked at Leipzick, in order to deli∣berate
on these demands; and the city being unable to pay
such a considerable sum, the Prussian troops began to put
their monarch's threats in execution. He justified these
proceedings, by declaring that the enemy had practised
the same violence and oppression on the territories of his
allies; but how the practice of his declared enemies, in
countries which they had invaded and subdued in the com∣mon
course of war, should justify him in pillaging and
oppressing a people, with whom neither he nor his allies
were at war, it is not easy to conceive. As little can we
reconcile this conduct to the character of a prince, assu∣ming
the title of Protector of the Protestant Religion,
which is the established faith among those very Saxons
who were subjected to such grievous impositions; imposi∣tions
<PB N="302" REF="306"/>
the more grievous and unmerited, as they had never
taken any share in the present war, but cautiously avoided
every step that might be construed into provocation, since
the King of Prussia declared they might depend upon his
protection.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. Before we proceed to enumerate the events
of the campaign, it may be necessary to inform the reader,
that the forces brought into the field by the Empress-Queen
of Hungary, and the States of the Empire, the Czarina,
the Kings of France and Sweden, fell very little short of
three hundred thousand men; and all these were destined
to act against the King of Prussia and the Elector of Hano∣ver.
In opposition to this formidable confederacy, his
Prussian Majesty was, by the subsidy from England, the
spoils of Saxony, and the revenues of Brandenbourg,
enabled to maintain an army of one hundred and forty thou∣sand
men; while the Elector of Hanover assembled a body of
sixty thousand men, composed of his own electoral troops,
with the auxiliary mercenaries of Hesse-Cassel, Bucke∣bourg,
Saxegotha, and Brunswick Wolfenbuttel, all of
them maintained by the pay of Great-Britain. At this
juncture, indeed, there was no other fund for their sub∣sistence,
as the countries of Hanover and Hesse were pos∣sessed
by the enemy, and in the former the government
was entirely changed.</P>
<P>§ XIX. In the month of December in the preceding
year, a farmer of the revenues from Paris arrived at Hano∣ver,
where he established his office, in order to act by
virtue of powers from one John Faidy, to whom the French
King granted the direction, receipt, and administration of
all the duties and revenues of the electorate. This di∣rector
was, by a decree of the council of state, empower∣ed
to receive the revenues, not only of Hanover, but also
of all other countries that should be subjected to his Most
Christian Majesty in the course of the campaign; to re∣move
the receivers who had been employed in any part of
the direction, receipt, and administration of the duties and
revenues of Hanover, and appoint others in their room.
<PB N="303" REF="307"/>
The French King, by the same decree, ordained, that
all persons who had been entrusted under the preceding
government with titles, papers, accounts, registers, or
estimates, relating to the administration of the revenues
should communicate them to John Faidy, or his attor∣nies;
that the magistrates of the town, districts, and com∣monalties,
as well as those who directed the administration
of particular states and provinces, should deliver to the
said John Faidy, or his attornies, the produce of six years
of the duties and revenues belonging to the said towns,
districts, and provinces, reckoning from the first of Janu∣ary
in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty one,
together with an authentick account of the sums they had
paid during that term to the preceding sovereign, and of
the charges necessarily incurred. It appears from the na∣ture
of this decree, which was dated on the eighteenth day
of October that immediately after the conventions of
Closter-Sev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and Bremeworden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Six days after the convention was signed at Closter-Seven, another act of accommodation was concluded at Bremeworden, between the Generals <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>porcken and Villemur, relating to the release of prisoners, and some other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oints omitted in the convention.</NOTE>, the court of Versailles
had deter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to change the government and system of

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the city of Hanover, when it surrender∣ed
on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inth day of August; and that the crown of
France intended to take advantage of the cessation of arms,
in seising places and provinces which were not yet subdued;
for, by the decree above mentioned, the administration of
John Faidy extended to the countries which might here∣after
be conquered. With what regard to justice, then,
could the French government charge the Elector of Hano∣ver
with the infraction of articles? or what respect to good
faith and humanity did the Duke de Richelieu observe, in
the order issued from Zell, towards the end of the year,
importing, that as the treaty made with the country of
Hanover had been rendered void by the violation of the
articles signed at Closter-Seven, all the effects belonging to
the officers, or others, employed in the Hanoverian army
<PB N="304" REF="308"/>
should be confiscated for the use of his Most Christian
Majesty?</P>
<P>§ XX. The Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, being desirous
of averting a like storm from his dominions, not only pro∣mised
to renounce all connexion with the Kings of Great-Britain
and Prussia, but even sollicited the court of France
to receive him among the number of its dependants; for,
on the eighteenth day of October, the minister of the Due
de Deuxponts delivered at Versailles, in the name of the
Landgrave, the plan of a treaty founded on the following
conditions. The Landgrave, after having expressed an
ardent defire of attaching himself wholly to France, pro∣posed
these articles: That he should enter into no engage∣ment
against the King and his allies; and give no assistance
directly or indirectly to the enemies of his Majesty and
his allies: that he should never give his vote, in the gene∣ral
or particular assemblies of the Empire, against his Ma∣jesty's
interest; but, on the contrary, employ his interest,
jointly with France, to quiet the troubles of the Empire:
that, for this end, his troops, which had served in the
Hanoverian army, should engage in the service of France,
on condition that they should not act in the present war
against his Britannick Majesty: that, immediately after
the ratification of the treaty, his Most Christian Majesty
should restore the dominions of the Landgrave in the same
condition they were in when subdued by the French forces:
that these dominions should be exempted from all further
contributions, either in money, corn, forage, wood, or
cattle, though already imposed on the subjects of Hesse;
and the French troops pay for all the provision with which
they might be supplied; in which case the Landgrave
should exact no toll for warlike stores, provisions, or other
articles of that nature, which might pass through his do∣minions:
that the King of France should guarantee all
his estates, all the rights of the house of Hesse-Cassel, par∣ticularly
the act of assurance signed by his son, the here∣ditary
prince, with regard to religion; use his interest with
the Emperor and the Empress-Queen, that, in consider∣ation
<PB N="305" REF="309"/>
of the immense losses and damages his most serene
highness had suffered since the French invaded his coun∣try,
and of the great sums he should lose with England
in arrears and subsidies by this accommodation, he might
be excused from furnishing his contingent to the army of
the Empire, as well as from paying the Roman months
granted by the diet of the Empire; and if, in resentment
of this convention, the states of his serene highness should
be attacked, his Most Christian Majesty should afford the
most speedy and effectual succours. These proposals
will speak for themselves to the reader's apprehension;
and if he is not blinded by the darkest mists of prejudice,
exhibit a clear and distinct idea of a genuine German
ally. The Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel had been fed with
the good things of England, even in time of peace, when
his friendship could not avail, nor his aversion prejudice
the interests of Great-Britain: but he was retained in that
season of tranquillity as a friend, on whose services the
most implicit dependence might be placed in any future
storm or commotion. How far he merited this confidence
and favour might have been determined by reflecting on
his conduct during the former war: in the course of which
his troops were hired to the King of Great-Britain and
his enemies alternately, as the scale of convenience happen∣ed
to preponderate. Since the commencement of the pre∣sent
troubles, he had acted as a mercenary to Great-Bri∣tain,
although he was a principal in the dispute, and stood
connected with her designs by solemn treaty, as well as by
all the ties of gratitude and honour: but now that the cause
of Hanover seemed to be on the decline, and his own
dominions had suffered by the fate of the war, he not only
appeared willing to abandon his benefactor and ally, but
even sued to be inlisted in the service of his adversary.
This intended defection was, however, prevented by a
sudden turn of fortune, which he could not possibly fore∣see;
and his troops continued to act in conjunction with
the Hanoverians.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="310"/>
§ XXI. The Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel was not singular
in making such advances to the French monarch. The
Duke of Brunswick, still more nearly connected with the
King of Great-Britain, used such uncommon expedition
in detaching himself from the tottering fortune of Hanover,
that in ten days after the convention of Closter-Seven
he had concluded a treaty with the courts of Vienna and
Versailles; so that the negociation must have been begun
before that convention took place. On the twentieth day
of September his minister at Vienna, by virtue of full
powers from the Duke of Brunswick, accepted and signed
the conditions which the French King and his Austrian
ally thought proper to impose. These imported, That
his Most Christian Majesty should keep possession of the
cities of Brunswick and Wolfenbuttel during the war,
and make use of the artillery, arms, and military stores
deposited in their arsenals: that the Duke's forces, on
their return from the camp of the Duke of Cumberland,
should be disbanded and disarmed; and take an oath,
that they should not, during the present war, serve against
the King or his allies: that the Duke should be permitted
to maintain a battalion of foot, and two squadrons of horse,
for the guard of his person and castles; but the regulations
made by Mareschal Richelicu and the intendant of his
army should subsist on their present footing: that the
Duke should furnish his contingent in money and troops,
agreeably to the laws of the Empire: that his forces should
immediately join those which the Germanick body had
assembled: and that he should order his minister at Ratis∣bon
to vote conformably to the resolutions of the diet,
approved and confirmed by the Emperor. In consider∣ation
of all these concessions, the Duke was restored to the
savour of the French King, who graciously promised that
neither his revenues nor his treasure should be touched,
nor the administration of justice invaded; and that nothing
further should be demanded, but winter-quarters for the
regiments which should pass that season in the country of
Brunswick. How scrupulously soever the Duke might
<PB N="307" REF="311"/>
have intended to observe the articles of this treaty, his
intentions were frustrated by the conduct of his brother
Prince Ferdinand, who, being invested with the command
of the Hanoverian army, and ordered to resume the opera∣tions
of war against the enemy, detained the troops of Bruns∣wick,
as well as his nephew the Hereditary Prince, not∣withstanding
the treaty which his brother had signed, and
the injunctions which he had laid upon his son to quit the
army, and make a tour to Holland. The Duke wrote an
expostulatory letter to Prince Ferdinand, pathetically com∣plaining
that he had seduced his troops, decoyed his son,
and disgraced his family; insisting upon the prince's
pursuing his journey as well as upon the returning the
troops: and threatening, in case of non-compliance, to use
other means that should be more effectual<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<OPENER>Translation of the letter written by the Duke of Brunswick to his bro∣ther Prince Ferdinand:
<SALUTE>“SIR:”</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“I KNOW you too well to doubt that the situation in which we stand at present, with respect to each other, gives you abundance of uneasiness; nor will you doubt that it gives me equal concern: indeed, it afflicts me greatly. Mean while I could never, my dearest brother, have believed that you would be the person who should carry away from me my eldest son. I am exceed∣ingly mortified to find myself under the hard necessity of telling you that this step is contrary to the law of nations, and the constitutions of the Empire; and that, if you persist in it, you will disgrace your family, and bring a stain upon your country, which you pretend to serve. The Hereditary Prince, my son, was at Hamburgh by my order, and you have carried him to Stade. Could he distrust his uncle, an uncle who hath done so much honour to his family? Could he believe that this uncle would deprive him of liberty, a liberty never refused to the lowest officer: I ordered him to make a tour to Holland: could not the lowest officer have done as much? Let us suppose for a moment, that my troops, among whom he served, were to have staid with the Hanoverians, would it not have been still in my power to give an officer leave of absence, or even leave to resign his commission? and would you hinder your brother, the head of your family, and of such a family as ours, to exercise this right with regard to a son, who is the Hereditary Prince, of whose rights and prerogatives you cannot be ignorant? It is im∣possible you could have conceived such designs without the suggestion of others. Those who did suggest them have trampled on the rights of nature, of nations, and of the princes of Germany: they have induced you to add to all these the most cruel insult on a brother whom you love, and who always loved you with the warmest affection. Would you have your bro∣ther lay his just complaints against you before the whole Empire, and all Europe? Are not your proccedings without example? What is Germany become? What are its princes become, and our house in particular? Is it the interest of the two kings, the cause of your country, and my cause, that you pretend to support?—I repeat it, brother, that this design could never have been framed by you. I again command my son to pursue his journey; and I cannot conceive you will give the least obstruction: if you should (which I pray God avert) I solemnly declare that I will not be constrained by such measures, nor shall I ever forget what I owe to myself. As to my troops, you may see what I have written on that head to the Hanoverian ministry. The Duke of Cumberland, by the convention of Closter-Seven, dismissed them, and sent them home: the said ministry gave me notice of this convention, as a treaty by which I was bound. The march of the troops was settled; and an incident happening, they halted: that obstacle being removed, they were to have continued their march. The court of Hanover will be no longer bound by the convention, while I not only accepted it on their word, but have also, in conformity with their instruc∣tions, negociated at Versailles, and at Vienna. After all these steps they would have me contradict myself, break my word, and entirely ruin my estate, as well as my honour. Did you ever know you brother guilty of such things? True it is, I have, as you say, sacrificed my all; or rather, I have been sacrificed. The only thing left me is my honour; and in the unhappy contrast of our situations, I lament both you and myself, that it should be from you, my dear brother, I should receive the cruel advice to give up my honour. I cannot listen to it; I cannot recede from my promise My troops, therefore, must return home, agreeably to what the Duke of Cum∣berland and the Hanoverian ministry stipulated with regard to me in the strongest manner. I am afraid that the true circumstances of things are concealed from you. Not to detain your express too long, I shall send you, by the post, copies of all I have written to the Hanoverian ministry. It will grieve your honest heart to read it. I am, with a heart almost broken, yet full of tenderness for you, your, &amp;c.”</P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE>“Blanckenbourg, <DATE>Nov. 27, 1757:”</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER></NOTE>. Notwith∣standing
<PB N="308" REF="312"/>
this warm remonstrance, Prince Ferdinand ad∣hered
to his plan. He detained the troops, and the Here∣ditary
Prince, who, being fond of the service, in a little
time signalised himself by very extraordinary acts of bra∣very
and conduct; and means were found to reconcile his
father to measures that expressly contradicted his engage∣ments
with the courts of Vienna and Versailles.</P>
<P>§ XXII. The defeat of the French army at Rosbach,
and the retreat of the Russians from Pomerania, had en∣tirely
changed the face of affairs in the Empire. The
French King was soon obliged to abandon his conquests on
that side of the Rhine, and his threats sounded no longer
<PB N="309" REF="313"/>
terrible in the ears of the Hanoverian and Prussian allies.
As little formidable were the denunciations of the Empe∣ror,
who had, by a decree of the Aulick council, com∣municated
to the diet certain mandates, issued in the
month of August in the preceding year, on pain of the
ban of the Empire, with avocatory letters annexed,
against the King of Great-Britain, Elector of Hanover,
and the other princes acting in concert with the King of
Prussia. The French court likewise published a virulent
memorial, after the convention of Closter-Seven had been
violated, and set aside, drawing an invidious parallel
between the conduct of the French King and the proceed∣ings
of his Britannick Majesty; in which the latter is
taxed with breach of faith, and almost every meanness
that could stain the character of a monarch. In answer
to the Emperor's decree, and this virulent charge, Baron
Gimmengen, the electoral Minister of Brunswick Lunen∣bourg,
presented to the diet, in November, a long me∣morial,
recapitulating the important services his sovereign
had done the house of Austria, and the ungrateful returns
he had reaped, in the Queen's refusing to assist him, when
his dominions were threatened with an invasion. He
enumerated many instances in which she had assisted,
encouraged, and even joined the enemies of the elec∣torate,
in contempt of her former engagements, and di∣rectly
contrary to the constitution of the Empire. He
refuted every article of the charge which the French court
had brought against him in the virulent libel, retorted
the imputations of perfidy and ambition, and with respect
to France, justified every particular of his own con∣duct.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. While the French and Hanoverian armies
remained in their winter-quarters, the former at Zell,
and the latter at Lunenbourg, divers petty enterprises
were executed by detachments with various success. The
Hanoverian general Juncheim, having taken post at Hai∣berstadt
and Quedlimburg, from whence he made ex∣cursions
even to the gates of Brunswick, and kept the
<PB N="310" REF="314"/>
French army in continual alarm, was visited by a large
body of the enemy, who compelled him to retire to Acher∣sleben,
committed great excesses in the town of Halber∣stadt
and its neighbourhood, and carried off hostages for
the payment of contributions. General Hardenberg,
another Hanoverian officer, having dislodged the French
detachments that occupied Burgh, Vogelsack, and Ritter∣hude,
and cleared the whole territory of Bremen, in
the month of January the Duke de Broglio assembled a
considerable corps of troops that were cantoned at Otters∣burgh,
Rothenburg, and the adjacent country, and ad∣vancing
to Bremen, demanded admittance, threatening,
that, in case of a refusal, he would have recourse to ex∣tremities,
and punish the inhabitants severely, should they
make the least opposition. When their deputies waited
upon him, to desire a short time for deliberation, he an∣swered,
“Not a moment—the Duke de Richelieu's orders
are peremptory, and admit of no delay.” He accord∣ingly
ordered the cannon to advance; the wall was scaled,
and the gates would have been forced open, had not the
magistrates, at the earnest importunity of the people, re∣solved
to comply with his demand. A second deputation
was immediately dispatched to the Duke de Broglio,
signifying their compliance; and the gates being opened,
he marched into the city at midnight, after having pro∣mised
upon his honour, that no attempt should be made to
the prejudice of its rights and prerogatives, and no outrage
offered to the privileges of the regency, to the liberty,
religion, and commerce of the inhabitants. This con∣quest,
however, was of short duration. Prince Ferdi∣nand
of Brunswick being joined by a body of Prussian
horse, under the command of Prince George of Holstein
Gottorp, the whole army was put in motion, and advanced
to the country of Bremen about the middle of February.
The enemy were dislodged from Rothenburg, Ottersburg,
and Verden, and they abandoned the city of Bremen at
the approach of the Hanoverian general, who took pos∣session
of it without opposition.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="315"/>
§ XXIV. By this time the court of Versailles, being
dissatisfied with the conduct of the Duke de Richelieu,
had recalled that general from Germany, where his place
was supplied by the Count de Clermont, to the general
satisfaction of the army, as well as to the joy of the Hano∣verian
subjects, among whom Richelieu had committed
many flagrant and inhuman acts of rapine and oppression.
The new commander found his master's forces reduced to
a deplorable condition, by the accidents of war, and dis∣temper
arising from hard duty, severe weather, and the
want of necessaries. As he could not pretend, with such
a wretched remnant, to oppose the designs of Prince Fer∣dinand
in the field, or even maintain the footing which his
predecessor had gained, he found himself under the ne∣cessity
of retiring with all possible expedition towards the
Rhine. As the allies advanced, his troops retreated from
their distant quarters with such precipitation, as to leave
behind all their sick, together with a great part of their
baggage and artillery, besides a great number of officers
and soldiers, that fell into the hands of those parties by
whom they were pursued. The inhabitants of Hanover,
perceiving the French intended to abandon that city, were
overwhelmed with the fear of being subject to every spe∣cies
of violence and abuse: but their apprehensions were
happily disappointed by the honour and integrity of the
Duke de Randan, the French governor, who not only took
effectual measures for restraining the soldiers within the
bounds of the most rigid discipline and moderation, but
likewise exhibited a noble proof of generosity, almost with∣out
example. Instead of destroying his magazine of pro∣visions,
according to the usual practice of war, he ordered
the whole to be either sold at a low price, or distributed
among the poor of the city, who had been long exposed
to the horrours of famine: an act of godlike humanity,
which ought to dignify the character of that worthy noble∣man
above all the titles that military fame can deserve,
or arbitrary monarchs bestow. The regency of Hanover
were so deeply impressed with a sense of his heroick be∣haviour
<PB N="312" REF="316"/>
on this occasion, that they gratefully acknowledged
it, in a letter of thanks to him and the Count de Cler∣mont;
and on the day of solemn thanksgiving to heaven,
for their being delivered from their enemies, the clergy in
their sermons did not fail to celebrate and extol the charity
and benevolence of the Duke de Randan. Such glorious
testimonies, even from enemies, must have afforded the
most exquisite pleasure to a mind endued with sensibility;
and this, no doubt, may be termed one of the fairest tri∣umphs
of humanity.</P>
<P>§ XXV. The two grand divisions of the French army,
quartered at Zell and Hanover, retired in good order to
Hamelen, where they collected all their troops, except
those that were left in Hoya, and about four thousand men
placed in garrison at Minden, to retard the operations of
the combined army. Towards the latter end of February,
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, having received intelli∣gence
that the Count de Chabot was posted with a con∣siderable
body of troops at Hoya, upon the Weser, de∣tached
the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, with four bat∣talions,
and some light troops and dragoons, to dislodge
them from that neighbourhood. This enterprise was ex∣ecuted
with the utmost intrepidity. The Hereditary Prince
passed the Weser at Bremen with part of his detachment,
while the rest advanced on this side of the river; and the
enemy, being attacked in front and rear, were in a little
time forced, and thrown into confusion. The bridge
being abandoned, and near seven hundred men taken pri∣soners,
the Count de Chabot threw himself, with two bat∣talions,
into the castle, where he resolved to support him∣self,
in hope of being relieved. The regiment of Bretagne,
and some detachments of dragoons, were actually on the
march to his assistance. The Hereditary Prince being
made acquainted with this circumstance, being also desti∣tute
of heavy artillery to besiege the place in form, and
taking it for granted he should not be able to maintain the
post after it might be taken, he listened to the terms of
capitulation proposed by the French general, whose garri∣son
<PB N="313" REF="317"/>
was suffered to march out with the honours of war;
but their cannon, stores, and ammunition were surrender∣ed
to the victor. This was the first exploit of the Here∣ditary
Prince, whose valour and activity, on many subse∣quent
occasions, shone with distinguished lustre. He had
no sooner reduced Hoya, than he marched to the attack of
Minden, which he invested on the fifth day of March, and
on the fourteenth the garrison surrendered at discretion.
After the reduction of this city, the combined army ad∣vanced
towards Hamelen, where the French general had
established his head quarters: but he abandoned them at
the approach of the allies, and leaving behind all his sick
and wounded, with part of his magazines, retired without
halting to Paderborn, and from thence to the Rhine, re∣calling
in his march the troops that were in Embden,
Cassel, and the landgraviate of Hesse, all which places
were now evacuated. They were terribly harrassed in
their retreat by the Prussian hussars, and a body of light
horse, distinguished by the name of Hanoverian hunters,
who took a great number of prisoners, together with many
baggage-waggons, and some artillery. Such was the
precipitation of the enemy's retreat, that they could not
find time to destroy all their magazines of provision and
forage; and even forgot to call in the garrison of Vechte,
a small fortress in the neighbourhood of Diepholt, who
were made prisoners of war, and here was found a com∣plete
train of battering cannon and mortars. The Count
de Clermont, having reached the banks of the Rhine,
distributed his forces into quarters of cantonment in Wesel
and the adjoining country, while Prince Ferdinand can∣toned
the allied army in the bishoprick of Munster: here,
however, he did not long remain inactive. In the latter
end of May he ordered a detachment to pass the Rhine at
Duysburg, under the command of Colonel Scheither,
who executed his order without loss, defeated three bat∣talions
of the enemy, and took five pieces of cannon. In
the beginning of June the whole army passed the Rhine,
on a bridge constructed for the occasion, defeated a body
<PB N="314" REF="318"/>
of French cavalry, and obtained divers other advantages
in their march towards Wesel. Kaisersworth was sur∣prised,
the greater part of the garrison either killed or
taken; and Prince Ferdinand began to make preparations
for the siege of Dusseldorp. In the mean time, the Count
de Clermont, being unable to stop the rapidity of his pro∣gress,
was obliged to secure his troops with strong en∣trenchments,
until he should be properly re-enforced.</P>
<P>§ XXVI. The court of Versailles, though equally mor∣tified
and confounded at the turn of their affairs in Ger∣many,
did not sit tamely and behold this reverse; but
exerted their usual spirit and expedition in retrieving the
losses they had sustained. They assembled a body of troops
at Hanau, under the direction of the Prince de Soubise,
who, it was said, had received orders to penetrate, by the
way of Donawert, Ingoldstadt, and Arnberg, into Bohe∣mia.
In the mean time, re-enforcements daily arrived in
the camp of the Count de Clermont; and as repeated com∣plaints
had been made of the want of discipline and subor∣dination
in that army, measures were taken for reforming
the troops by severity and example. The Mareschal
Duke de Belleisle, who now acted as secretary at war with
uncommon ability, wrote a letter, directed to all the
colonels of infantry, threatening them, in the King's name,
with the loss of their regiments, should they connive any
longer at the scandalous practice of buying commissions:
an abuse which had crept into the service under various
pretexts, to the discouragement of merit, the relaxation of
discipline, and the total extinction of laudable emulation.
The Prince of Clermont having quitted his strong camp
at Rhinefeldt, retired to Nuys, a little higher up the river,
and detached a considerable corps, under the command of
the Count de St. Germain, to take post at Crevelt, situated
in a plain between his army and the camp of the allies,
which fronted the town of Meurs: after several motions
on both sides, Prince Ferdinand resolved to attack the ene∣my,
and forthwith made a disposition for this purpose.
He assigned the command of the whole left wing, con∣sisting
<PB N="315" REF="319"/>
of eighteen battalions and twenty-eight squadrons, to Lieutenant-General Sporcken: the conduct of the right
wing, composed of sixteen battalions and fourteen squa∣drons,
was entrusted to the Hereditary Prince and Major-General
Wangenheim; the squadrons, with the addition
of two regiments of Prussian dragoons, were under the im∣mediate
direction of the Prince of Halstein, while the Here∣ditary
Prince commanded the infantry. The light troops,
consisting of five squadrons of hussars, were divided be∣tween
the Prince of Holstein and Lieutenant General
Sporcken. Major Luckner's squadron, together with
Scheither's corps, were ordered to observe the flank of the
enemy's right, and with this view were posted in the vil∣lage
of Papendeick; and a battalion of the troops of
Wolfenbuttel were left in the town of Hulste, to cover
the rear of the army. Prince Ferdinand's design was to
attack the enemy on their left flank; but the execution
was rendered extremely difficult by the woods and ditches
that embarrassed the route, and the numerous ditches that
intersected this part of the country. On the twenty-third
day of June, at four in the morning, the army began to
move; the right advancing in two columns as far as St.
Anthony, and the left marching up within half a league
of Crevelt. The Prince having viewed the position of the
enemy from the steeple of St. Anthony, procured guides,
and having received all the necessary hints of information,
proceeded to the right, in order to charge the enemy's
left flank by the villages of Worst and Anrath; but, in
order to divide their attention, and keep them in suspense
with respect to the nature of his principal attack, he di∣rected
the Generals Sporcken and Oberg to advance
against them by the way of Crevelt and St. Anthony, and,
in particular, to make the most of their artillery, that,
being employed in three different places at once, they
might be prevented from sending any re-enforcement to
the left, where the chief attack was intended. These pre∣cautions
being taken, Prince Ferdinand, putting himself
at the head of the grenadiers of the right wing, continued
<PB N="316" REF="320"/>
his march in two columns to the village of Anrath, where
he fell in with an advanced party of the French, which,
after a few discharges of musquetry, retired to their camp
and gave the alarm. In the mean time, both armies were
drawn up in order of battle; the troops of the allies in the
plain between the villages of Anrath and Willich, oppo∣site
to the French forces, whose left was covered with a
wood. The action began about one in the afternoon,
with a severe cannonading on the part of Prince Ferdi∣nand,
which, though well supported, proved ineffectual in
drawing the enemy from their cover: he, therefore, deter∣mined
to dislodge them from the wood by dint of small
arms. The Hereditary Prince immediately advanced with
the whole front, and a very obstinate action enfucd. Mean
while, the cavalry on the right in vain attempted to pe∣netrate
the wood on the other side, where the enemy had
raised two batteries, which were sustained by forty squa∣drons
of horse. After a terrible fire had been maintained
on both sides, till five in the afternoon, the grenadiers
forced the entrenchments in the wood, which were lined
by the French infantry. These giving way abandoned
the wood in the utmost disorder; but the pursuit was
checked by the conduct and resolution of the enemy's ca∣valry,
which, notwithstanding a dreadful fire from the ar∣tillery
of the allies, maintained their ground, and covered
the foot in their retreat to Nuys. The success of the
day was, in a good measure, owing to the artillery on the
left and in the centre, with which the Generals Sporcken
and Oberg had done great execution, and employed the
attention of the enemy on that side, while Prince Ferdi∣nand
prosecuted his attack on the other quarter. It must
be owned, however, that their right wing and centre re∣tired
in great order to Nuys, though the left was de∣feated,
with the loss of some standards, colours, and pieces
of cannon, and six thousand men killed, wounded, or
taken prisoners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the French officers who lost their lives in this engagement was the Count de Gisors, only son of the Mareschal Duke de Belleisle, and last hope of that illustrious family, a young nobleman of extraordinary accomplish∣ments, who finished a short life of honour in the embrace of military glory, and fell gallantly fighting at the head of his own regiment, to the inexpressible grief of his aged father, and the universal regret of his country.</NOTE>. This victory, however, which cost
<PB N="317" REF="321"/>
the allies about fifteen hundred men, was not at all deci∣sive
in its consequences; and, indeed, the plan seemed
only calculated to display the enterprising genius of the
Hanoverian general. True it is, the French army took
refuge under the cannon of Cologn, where they remained,
without hazarding any step for the relief of Dusseldorp,
which Prince Ferdinand immediately invested, and in a
few days reduced, the garrison being allowed to march
out with the honours of war, on condition that they
should not, for the space of one year, carry arms against
the allies.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. It was at this period that Count de Clermont
resigned his command, which was conferred upon M. de
Contades, and the French army was considerably re-en∣forced.
He even threatened to attack Prince Ferdinand
in his turn, and made some motions with that design,
but was prevented by the little river Erff, behind which
the prince resolved to lie quiet, until he should be joined
by the body of British troops under the command of the
Duke of Marlborough, the first division of which had just
landed at Embden. He flattered himself that the Prince
of Y senbourg, at the head of the Hessian troops, would
find employment for the Prince de Soubise, who had
marched from Hanau, with a design to penetrate into the
landgraviate of Hesse-Cassel: his vanguard had been al∣ready
surprised and defeated by the militia of the country;
and the Prince of Ysenbourg was at the head of a consi∣derable
body of regular forces, assembled to oppose his fur∣ther
progress. Prince Ferdinand, therefore, hoped that
the operations of the French general would be effectually
impeded, until he himself, being joined by the British
troops, should be in a condition to pass the Meuse, transfer
the seat of war into the enemy's country, thus make a di∣version
from the Rhine, and perhaps oblige the Prince de
Soubise to come to the assistance of the principal French
<PB N="318" REF="322"/>
army, commanded by M. de Contades. He had formed a plan
which would have answered these purposes effectually, and,
in execution of it, marched to Ruremond on the Maese,
when his measures were totally disconcerted by a variety
of incidents which he could not foresee. The Prince of
Ysenbourg was, on the twenty-third day of July, defeated
at Sangarshausen by the Duke de Broglio, whom the
Prince de Soubise had detached against him with a num∣ber
of troops greatly superior to that which the Hessian
general commanded. The Duke de Broglio, who command∣ed
the corps that formed the vanguard of Soubise's army,
having learned at Cassel, that the Hessian troops, under
the Prince of Ysenbourg, were retiring towards Munden,
he advanced, on the twenty-third of July, with a body of
eight thousand men, to the village of Sangarshausen, where
he found them drawn up in order of battle, and forthwith
made a disposition for the attack. At first his cavalry
were repulsed by the Hessian horse, which charged the
French infantry, and were broke in their turn. The
Hessians, though greatly inferior in number to the enemy,
made a very obstinate resistance, by favour of a rock in
the Fulde that covered their right, and a wood by which
their left was secured. The dispute was so obstinate, that
the enemy's left was obliged to give ground, but the Duke
de Broglio ordering a fresh corps to advance, changed
the fortune of the day. The Hessians, overpowered by
numbers, gave way; part plunged into the river, where
many perished, and part threw themselves into the wood,
through which they escaped from the pursuit of the hus∣sars,
who took above two hundred soldiers and fifty offi∣cers,
including the Count de Canitz, who was second in
command. They likewise sound on the field of battle
seven pieces of cannon, and eight at Munden: but the car∣nage
was pretty considerable, and nearly equal on both
sides. The number of the killed and wounded, on the
side of the French, exceeded two thousand; the loss of the
Hessians was not so great. The Prince of Ysenbourg
having collected the remains of his little army, took post
<PB N="319" REF="323"/>
at Eimbeck, where he soon was re-enforced, and found
himself at the head of twelve thousand men: but, in con∣sequence
of this advantage, the enemy became masters of
the Weser, and opened to themselves a free passage into
Westphalia.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. The progress of Prince Ferdinand upon the
Maese had been retarded by a long succession of heavy
rains, which broke up the roads, and rendered the country
impassable; and now the certain information of this un∣lucky
check left him no alternative but a battle or a re∣treat
across the Rhine: the first was carefully avoided by
the enemy; the latter resolution, therefore, he found
himself under a necessity to embrace. In his present po∣sition
he was hampered by the French army on one wing,
on the other by the fortress of Gueldres, the garrison of
which had been lately re-enforced, as well as by divers
other posts, capable of obstructing the convoys and sub∣sistence
of the combined army: besides, he had reason to
apprehend that the Prince de Soubise would endeavour to
intercept the British troops in their march from Embden.
Induced by these considerations, he determined to repass
the Rhine, after having offered battle to the enemy, and
made several motions for that purpose. Finding them
averse to an engagement, he made his dispositions for
forcing the strong pass of Wachtendonck, an island sur∣rounded
by the Niers, of very difficult approach, and
situated exactly in his route to the Rhine. This service
was performed by the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick,
who, perceiving the enemy had drawn up the bridge,
rushed into the river at the head of his grenadiers, who
drove them away with their bayonets, and cleared the
bridges for the passage of the army towards Rhinebergen.
At this place Prince Ferdinand received intelligence that
M. de Chevert, reputed one of the best officers in the
French service, had passed the Lippe with fourteen bat∣talions
and several squadrons, to join the garrison of We∣sel,
and fall upon Lieutenant-General Imhoss, who com∣manded
a detached corps of the combined army at Meer,
that he might be at hand to guard the bridge which the
<PB N="320" REF="324"/>
prince had thrown over the Rhine at Rees. His Serene
Highness was extremely desirous of sending succours to
General Imhoff; but the troops were too much fatigued
to begin another march before morning; and the Rhine
had overflowed its banks in such a manner as to render
the bridge at Rees impassable, so that M. Imhoff was left
to the resources of his own conduct and the bravery of his
troops, consisting of six battalions and four squadrons,
already weakened by the absence of different detachments.
This general having received advice, on the fourth of Au∣gust,
that the enemy intended to pass the Lippe the same
evening with a considerable train of artillery, in order to
burn the bridge at Rees, decamped with a view to cover
this place, and join two battalions which had passed the
Rhine in boats, under the command of General Zastrow,
who re-enforced him accordingly; but the enemy not ap∣pearing,
he concluded the information was false, and re∣solved
to resume his advantageous post at Meer. Of this
he had no sooner repossessed himself, than his advanced
guards were engaged with the enemy, who marched
to the attack from Wesel, under the command of Lieu∣tenant-General
de Chevert, consisting of the whole corps
intended for the siege of Dusseldorp. Imhoff's front was
covered by coppices and ditches, there being a rising
ground on his right, from whence he could plainly discern
the whole force that advanced against him, together with
the manner of their approach. Perceiving them engaged
in that difficult ground, he posted one regiment in a cop∣pice,
with orders to fall upon the left slank of the enemy▪
which appeared quite uncovered; and as soon as their fire
began, advanced with the rest of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces to attack them
in front. The bayonet was used on this occasion, and
the charge given with such impetuosity and resolution,
that, after a short resistance, the enemy fell into confusion
and sled towards Wesel, leaving on the spot eleven piece
of cannon, with a great number of waggons and other
carriages: besides the killed and wounded, who amounted
to a pretty considerable number, the victor took three hun∣dred
and fifty-four prisoners, including eleven officers;
<PB N="321" REF="325"/>
whereas, on his part, the victory was purchased at a very
small expense.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. Immediately after this action, General
Wangenheim passed the Rhine with several squadrons and
battalions, to re-enforce General Imhoff, and enable him
to prosecute the advantage he had gained, while Prince
Ferdinand marched with the rest of the army to Santen:
from thence he proceeded to Rhineberg, where he intend∣ed
to pass; but the river had overflowed to such a degree,
that here, as well as at Rees, the shore was inaccessible;
so that he sound it necessary to march farther down the
river, and lay a bridge at Gtiethuyzen. The enemy had
contrived four vessels for the destruction of this bridge; but
they were all taken before they could put the design in
execution, and the whole army passed on the tenth day of
August, without any loss or further interruption. At
the same time the prince withdrew his garrison from Dus∣seldorp,
of which the French immediately took possession.
Immediately after his passage he received a letter from the
Duke of Marlborough, acquainting him that the British
troops had arrived at Lingen, in their route to Coesfeldt:
to which place General Imhoff was sent to receive them,
with a strong detachment. Notwithstanding this junction,
the two armies on the Rhine were so equally matched,
that no stroke of importance was struck on either side dur∣ing
the remaining part of the campaign. M. de Contades,
seeing no prospect of obtaining the least advantage over
Prince Ferdinand, detached Prince Xaverius of Saxony
with a strong re-enforcement to the Prince de Soubise,
who had taken possession of Gottengen, and seemed de∣termined
to attack the Prince of Ysenbourg at Eimbeck.
That this officer might be able to give him a proper recep∣tion,
Prince Ferdinand detached General Oberg with ten
thousand men to Lipstadt, from whence, should occasion
require, they might continue their march, and join the
Hessians. The whole body, when thus re-enforced, did
not exceed twenty thousand men, of whom General
Oberg now assumed the command: whereas the troops of
<PB N="322" REF="326"/>
Soubise were increased to the number of thirty thousand.
The allies had taken post upon the river Fulde at San∣dershaufen,
where they hoped the French would attack
them; but the design of Soubise was first to dislodge them
from that advantageous situation. With this view, he
made a motion, as if he had intended to turn the camp of
the allies by the road of Munden. In order to prevent
the execution of this supposed design, General Oberg de∣camped
on the tenth of October, and, passing by the vil∣lage
of Landwernhagen, advanced towards Luttenberg,
where, understanding the enemy were at his heels, he forth∣with
formed his troops in order of battle, his right to the
Fulde, and his left extending to a thicket upon an emi∣nence,
where he planted five field-pieces. The cavalry
supported the wings in a third line, the village of Lutten∣berg
was in the rear, and four pieces of cannon were
mounted on a rising ground that flanked this village. The
French having likewise passed Landwernhagen, posted
their left towards the Fulde, their right extending far
beyond the left of the allies, and their front being
strengthened with above thirty pieces of cannon. At four
in the afternoon the enemy began the battle with a severe
cannonading, and at the same time the first line of their
infantry attacked Major-General Zastrow, who was
posted on the left wing of the allies. This body of the
French was repulsed; but in the same moment, a consi∣derable
line of cavalry advancing, charged the allies in
front and slank. These were supported by a fresh body of
infantry with cannon, which, after a warm dispute,
obliged the confederates to give way; and General Oberg,
in order to prevent a total defeat, made a disposition for a
retreat, which was performed in tolerable order; not but
that he su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ered greatly, in passing through a defile, from
the fire of the enemy's cannon, which was brought up,
and managed under the direction of the Duke de Broglio.
Having marched through Munden, by midnight, the re∣tiring
army lay till morning under arms in the little plain
near Grupen, on the other side of the Weser; but at day-break
<PB N="323" REF="327"/>
prosecuted their march, after having withdrawn the
garrison from Munden, until they arrived in the neigh∣bourhood
of Guntersheim, where they encamped. In
this engagement General Oberg lost about fifteen hundred
men, his artillery, baggage, and ammunition. He was
obliged to abandon a magazine of hay and straw at Mun∣den,
and leave part of his wounded men in that place to
the humanity of the victor. But, after all, the French
general reaped very little advantage from his victory.</P>
<P>§ XXX. By this time Prince Ferdinand had retired into
Westphalia, and fixed his head-quarters at Munster, while
M. Contades encamped near Ham upon the Lippe: so
that, although he had obliged the French army to evacuate
Hanover and Hesse in the beginning of the year, when
they were weakened by death and distemper, and even
driven them beyond the Rhine, where they sustained a de∣feat;
yet they were soon put in a condition to baffle all
his future endeavours, and penetrate again into Westphalia,
where they established their winter-quarters, extending
themselves in such a manner as to command the whole
course of the Rhine on both sides, while the allies were
disposed in the landgraviate of Hessie-Cassel, and in the
bishoprick of Munster, Paderborn, and Hildesheim.
The British troops had joined them so late in the season,
that they had no opportunity to signalize themselves in
the field; yet the fatigues of the campaign, which they
had severely felt, proved fatal to their commander, the
Duke of Marlborough, who died of a dysentery at Mun∣ster,
universally lamented.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. Having thus particularised the operations of
the allied army since the commencement of the campaign,
we shall now endeavour to trace the steps of the King of
Prussia, from the period at which his army was assembled
for action. Having collected his sorce as soon as the season
would permit, he undertook the siege of Schweidnitz in
form on the twenty-first day of March; and carried on
his operations with such vigour, that in thirteen days the
garrison surrendered themselves prisoners of war, after
<PB N="324" REF="328"/>
having lost one half of their number in the defence of the
place. While one part of his troops were engaged in this
service, he himself, at the head of another, advanced to
the eastern frontier of Bohemia, and sent a detachment as
far as Trautenaw, garrisoned by a body of Austrians, who,
after an obstinate resistance, abandoned the place, and
retreated towards their grand army. By this success he
opened to himself a way into Bohemia, by which he poured
in detachments of light troops, to raise contributions,
and harrass the out-posts of the enemy. At the same time
the Baron de la Mothe Fouquet marched with another
body against the Austrian General Jahnus, posted in the
county of Glatz, whom he obliged to abandon all the
posts he occupied in that country, and pursued as far as
Nachod, within twenty miles of Koningsgratz, where
the grand Austrian army was encamped, under the com∣mand
of Mareschal Daun, who had lately arrived from
Vienna.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this juncture the Prussian commandant of Dresden being admitted into the Japan palace, to see the curious procelaine with which it is adorned, perceived a door built up; and ordering the passage to be opened, entered a large apartment, where he found three thousand tents, and other field utensils. These had been concealed here when the Prussians first took pos∣session of the city: they were immediately seised by the commandant, and distributed among the troops of Prince Henry's army.</NOTE>. Over and above these excursions, the King
ordered a body of thirty thousand men to be assembled, to
act under the command of his brother Prince Henry, an
accomplished warrior, against the army of the Empire,
which the Prince de Deuxponts, with great difficulty,
made a shift to form again near Bamberg, in Franconia.</P>
<P>§ XXXII. The King of Prussia, whose designs were
perhaps even greater than he cared to own, resolved to shift
the theatre of the war, and penetrate into Moravia, a
fertile country, which had hitherto been kept sacred from
ravage and contribution. Having formed an army of fifty
thousand choice troops, near Niess, in Silesia, he divided
them into three columns; the first commanded by Mareschal
Keith, the second by himself in person, and the third con∣ducted
by Prince Maurice of Anhault Dessau. In the
<PB N="325" REF="329"/>
latter end of April they began their march towards Mo∣ravia;
and General De la Ville, who commanded a body
of troops in that country, retired as they advanced, after
having thrown a strong re-enforcement into Olmutz,
which the King was determined to besiege. Had he passed
by this fortress, which was strongly fortified, and well
provided for a vigorous defence, he might have advanced
to the gates of Vienna, and reduced the Emperor to the
necessity of suing for peace on his own terms; but it
seems he was unwilling to deviate so far from the common
maxims of war as to leave a fortified place in the rear;
and, therefore, he determined to make himself master of it
before he should proceed. For this purpose it was imme∣diately
invested: orders were issued to hasten up the heavy
artillery, and Mareschal Keith was appointed to super∣intend
and direct the operations of the siege. Meanwhile,
the Austrian commander, Count Daun, being informed
of his Prussian Majesty's motions and designs, quitted his
camp at Leutomyssel in Bohemia, and entered Moravia by
the way of Billa. Being still too weak to encounter the
Prussians in the field, he extended his troops in the neigh∣bourhood
of the King's army, between Gewitz and
Littau, in a mountainous situation, where he ran little
or no risk of being attacked. Here he remained for some
time in quiet, with the fertile country of Bohemia in his
rear, from whence he drew plentiful supplies, and re∣ceived
daily re-enforcements. His scheme was to relieve
the besieged occasionally, to harrass the besiegers, and to
intercept their convoys from Silesia; and this scheme suc∣ceeded
to his wish. Olmutz is so extensive in its works,
and so peculiarly situated on the river Morava, that it
could not be completely invested without weakening the
posts of the besieging army, by extending them to a pro∣digious
circuit; so that, in some parts, they were easily
forced by detachments in the nights, who fell upon them
suddenly, and seldom failed to introduce into the place
supplies of men, provisions, and ammunition. The forage
in the neighbourhood of the city having been previous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
<PB N="326" REF="330"/>
destroyed, the Prussian horse were obliged to make ex∣cursions
at a great distance, consequently exposed to fa∣tigue,
and liable to surprise; and, in a word, the Prussians
were not very expert in the art of town taking.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. Count Daun knew how to take advantage
of these circumstances, without hazarding a battle, to
which the King provoked him in vain. While the garri∣son
made repeated sallies to retard the operations of the
besiegers, the Austrian general harrassed their foraging
parties, fell upon different quarters of their army in the
night, and kept them in continual alarm. Nevertheless,
the King finished his first parallel; and proceeded with
such vigour as seemed to promise a speedy reduction of the
place, when his design was entirely frustrated by an un∣toward
incident. Mareschal Daun, having received in∣telligence
that a large convoy had set out from Silesia for
the Prussian camp, resolved to seise this opportunity of
compelling the King to desist from his enterprise. He sent
General Jahnus, with a strong body of troops, towards
Bahrn, and another detachment to Stadtoliebe, with in∣structions
to attack the convoy on different sides; while
he himself advanced towards the besiegers, as if he in∣tended
to give them battle. The King of Prussia, far
from being deceived by this feint, began, from the motions
of the Austrian general, to suspect his real scheme, and
immediately dispatched General Ziethen, with a strong
re-enforcement, to protect the convoy, which was escorted
by eight battalions, and about four thousand men, who had
been sick, and were just recovered. Before this officer join∣ed
them, the convoy had been attacked on the twenty-eighth
day of June; but the assailants were repulsed with
considerable loss. Mareschal Daun, however, took care
that they should be immediately re-enforced; and next
day the attack was renewed with much greater effect.
Four hundred waggons, guarded by four battalions, and
about one thousand troopers, had just passed the desiles of
Domstadt, when the Austrians charged them furiously on
every side: the communication between the head and the
<PB N="327" REF="331"/>
rest of the convoy was cut off; and General Ziethen,
after having exerted all his efforts for its preservation, be∣ing
obliged to abandon the waggons, retired to Troppau.
Thus the whole convoy fell into the hands of the enemy,
who took above six hundred prisoners, together with
General Putkammer; and the King of Prussia was obliged
to relinquish his enterprise. This was a mortifying ne∣cessity
to a prince of his high spirit, at a time when he saw
himself on the eve of reducing the place, notwithstanding
the gallant defence which had been made by General Mar∣shal,
the governor. Nothing now remained but to raise
the siege, and retire without loss in the face of a vigilant
enemy, prepared to seise every opportunity of advantage:
a task which, how hard soever it may appear, he per∣formed
with equal dexterity and success. Instead of re∣tiring
into Silesia, he resolved to avert the war from his
own dominions, and take the route of Bohemia, the
frontiers of which were left uncovered by Mareschal Daun's
last motion, when he advanced his quarters to Posnitz, in
order to succour Olmutz the more effectually. After the
King had taken his measures, he carefully concealed his
design from the enemy, and, notwithstanding the loss of
his convoy, prosecuted the operations of the siege with
redoubled vigour, till the first day of July, when he de∣camped
in the night, and began his march to Bohemia.
He himself, with one division, took the road to Konitz;
and Mareschal Keith having brought away all the artillery,
except four mortars, and one disabled cannon, pursued his
march by the way of Littau to Muglitz and Tribau.
Although his Prussian Majesty had gained an entire march
upon the Austrians, their light troops, commanded by
the Generals Buccow and Laudohn, did not fail to attend
and harrass his army in their retreat; but their endeavours
were in a great measure frustrated by the conduct and cir∣cumspection
of the Prussian commanders. After the rear
of the army had passed the defiles of Krenau, General
Lasci, who was posted at Gibau with a large body of
Austrian troops, occupied the village of Krenau with a
<PB N="328" REF="332"/>
detachment of grenadiers, who were soon dislodged; and
the Prussians pursued their march by Zwittau to Leuto∣myssel,
where they seised a magazine of meal and sorage.
In the mean time, General de Ratzow, who conducted
the provisions and artillery, found the hills of Hollitz
possessed by the enemy, who cannonaded him as he ad∣vanced;
but Mareschal Keith coming up, ordered them
to be attacked in the rear, and they fled into a wood with
precipitation, with the loss of six officers and three hun∣dred
men, who were taken prisoners. While the Mare∣schal
was thus employed, the King proceeded from Leu∣tomyssel
to Koninsgratz, where General Buccow, who
had got the start of him, was posted with seven thousand
men behind the Elbe, and in the entrenchments which
they had thrown up all round the city. The Prussian
troops as they arrived passed over the little river Adler,
and as the enemy had broken down the bridges over the
Elbe, the King ordered them to be repaired with all ex∣pedition,
being determined to attack the Austrian en∣trenchments:
but General Buccow did not wait for his
approach. He abandoned his entrenchments, and retired
with his troops to Clumetz; so that the King took posses∣sion
of the most important post of Koningsgratz without
further opposition. An Austrian corps having taken post
between him and Hollitz, in order to obstruct the march
of the artillery, he advanced against them in person, and
having driven them from the place, all his cannon, mili∣tary
stores, provision, with fifteen hundred sick and
wounded men, arrived in safety at Koningsgratz, where
the whole army encamped. His intention was to transfer
the seat of war from Moravia to Bohemia, where he
should be able to maintain a more easy communication
with his own dominions: but a more powerful motive
soon obliged him to change his resolution.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. After the Russian troops under Apraxin had
retreated from Pomerania in the course of the preceding
year, and the Czarina seemed ready to change her system,
the courts of Vienna and Versailles had, by dint of subsi∣dies,
<PB N="329" REF="333"/>
promises, presents, and intrigues, attached her, in
all appearance, more firmly than ever to the confederacy,
and even induced her to augment the number of troops
destined to act against the Prussian monarch. She not
only signed her accession in form to the quadruple alliance
with the Empress-Queen and the Kings of France and
Sweden; but, in order to manifest her zeal to the com∣mon
cause, she disgraced her chancellor, Count Bestuchef,
who was supposed averse to the war: she divided her
forces into separate bodies, under the command of the
Generals Fermer and Browne, and ordered them to put
their troops in motion in the middle of winter. Fermer
accordingly began his march in the beginning of January,
and on the twenty-second his light troops took possession
of Koningsberg, the capital of Prussia, without oppo∣sition;
for the King's sorces had quitted that country,
in order to prosecute the war in the western parts of Pome∣rania.
They did not, however, maintain themselves in
this part of the country; but, after having ravaged some
districts, returned to the main body, which halted on the
Vistula, to the no small disturbance of the city of Dant∣zick.
The resident of the Czarina actually demanded
that the magistrates should receive a Russian garrison: a
demand which they not only peremptorily refused, but
ordered all the citizens to arms, and took every other
method to provide for their defence. At length, after
some negociation with General Fermer, the assair was
compromised: he desisted from the demand, and part of
his troops passed the Vistula, seemingly to invade Pome∣rania,
in the eastern part of which Count Dohna had
assembled an army of Prussians to oppose their progress.
But after they had pillaged the open country, they rejoin∣ed
their main body; and General Fermer, turning to the
left, advanced toward Silesia, in order to co-operate with
the other Russian army commanded by Browne, who had
taken his route through Poland, and already passed the
Posna. By the first of July, both bodies had reached the
frontiers of Silesia, and some of their cossacks, penetrating
<PB N="330" REF="334"/>
into that province, had committed dreadful ravages, and
overwhelmed the inhabitants with consternation. Count
Dohna, with the Prussian army under his command, had
attended their motions, and even passed the Oder at Frank∣fort,
as if he had intended to give them battle: but he was
too much inferior in number to hazard such a step, which
became an object of his sovereign's own personal attention.
Mareschal Daun had followed the King into Bohemia,
and, on the twenty-second day of July, encamped on the
hills of Libischau, a situation almost inaccessible, where he
resolved to remain, and watch the motions of the Prussian
monarch, until some opportunity should offer of acting to
advantage. Nature seems to have expressly formed this
commander with talents to penetrate the designs, embar∣rass
the genius, and check the impetuosity of the Prussian
monarch. He was justly compared to Fabius Maximus,
distinguished by the epithet of Cunctator. He possessed
all the vigilance, caution, and sagacity of that celebrated
Roman. Like him, he hovered on the skirts of the enemy,
harrassing their parties, accustoming the soldiers to strict
discipline, hard service, and the face of a formidable foe,
and watching for opportunities, which he knew how to
seise with equal courage and celerity.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. The King of Prussia, being induced by a
concurrence of motives to stop the progress of the Russians
in Silesia, made his dispositions for retreating from Bohe∣mia,
and on the twenty-fifth day of July quitted the camp
at Koningsgratz. He was attended in his march by three
thousand Austrian light troops, who did not fail to in∣commode
his rear: but notwithstanding these impediments,
he passed the Mittau, proceeded on his route, and on the
ninth day of August arrived at Landshut. From thence
he hastened with a detachment towards Frankfort on the
Oder, and joined the army commanded by Lieutenant-General
Dohna at Gorgas. Then the whole army passed
the Oder by a bridge thrown over it at Gatavise, and
having rested one day, advanced to Dertmitzel, where he
encamped. The Russians, under General Fermer, were
<PB N="331" REF="335"/>
posted on the other side of the little river Mitzel, their
right extending to the village of Zwicker, and their left to
Quertchem. The King being determined to hazard a
battle, passed the Mitzel on the twenty-fifth in the morn∣ing,
and turning the flank of the enemy, drew up his army
in order of battle in the plain between the little river
and the town of Zorndorf. The Russians, by whom he
was out-numbered, did not decline the dispute; but as
the ground did not permit them to extend themselves, they
appeared in four lines, forming a front on every side, de∣fended
by cannon and a chevaux-de-frise, their right flank
covered by the village of Zwicker. After a warm cannon∣ade,
the Prussian infantry were ordered to attack the village,
and a body of grenadiers advanced to the assault; but this
brigade unexpectedly giving way, occasioned a consider∣able
opening in the line, and left the whole left flank of
the infantry uncovered. Before the enemy could take
advantage of this incident, the interval was filled up by the
cavalry under the command of General Seydlitz; and the
King, with his usual presence of mind, substituted another
choice body of troops to carry on the attack. This began
about noon, and continued for some time, during which
both sides fought with equal courage and perseverance:
at length General Scydlitz, having routed the Russian
cavalry, fell upon the flank of the infantry with great fury,
which being also dreadfully annoyed by the Prussian ar∣tillery,
they abandoned the village, together with their
military chest, and great part of their baggage. Notwith∣standing
this loss, which had greatly disordered their right
wing, they continued to stand their ground, and terrible
havock was made among them, not only with the sword
and bayonet, but also by the cannon, which were loaded
with grape-shot, and being excellently served, did great
execution. Towards evening the confusion among them
increased to such a degree, that in all probability they
would have been entirely routed, had they not been favour∣ed
by the approaching darkness, as well as by a particular
operation, which was very gallantly performed. One of
<PB N="332" REF="336"/>
the Russian generals perceiving the fortune of the day
turned against them, rallied a select body of troops, and
made a vigorous impression on the right wing of the Prus∣sians.
This effort diverted their attention so strongly to
that quarter, that the right of the Russians enjoyed a
respite, during which they retired in tolerable order,
and occupied a new post on the right, where the rest of
their forces were the more easily assembled. In this battle
they are said to have lost above fifteen thousand men, thir∣ty-seven
colours, five standards, twelve mortars, the great∣er
part of their baggage, and above one hundred pieces of
cannon. Among the prisoners that fell into the hands of
the victor, were several general officers, and a good num∣ber
lost their lives on the field of battle. The victory cost
the King above two thousand men, including some officers
of distinction, particularly two aids-du-camp, who at∣tended
his own person, which he exposed without scruple
to all the perils of the day. It would have redounded still
more to his glory, had he put a stop to the carnage; for
after all resistance was at an end, the wretched Russians
were hewn down without mercy. It must be owned,
indeed, that the Prussian soldiers were in a peculiar manner
exasperated against this enemy, because they had laid waste
the country, burned the villages, ruined the peasants, and
committed many horrid acts of barbarity, which the
practice of war could not authorise<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A detail of the cruelties committed by those barbarians cannot be read without horrour. They not only burned a great number of villages, but they ravished, rifled, murthered, and mutilated the inhabitants, without distinc∣tion of age or sex, without any other provocation or incitement than brutal▪ Just and wantonness of barbarity. They even violated the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the dead, which have been held sacred among the most savage nations. At Ca∣min and Breckholtz they forced open the graves and sepulchral vaults, and stripped the bodies of the General<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sclaberndorf and Ruitz, which had been deposited there. But the collected force of their vengea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce was discharged against Custrin, the capital of the New Marche of Brandenburgh, situated at the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lux of the Warta and the Oder, about fifteen English miles from Frankfort. The particulars of the disaster that besell this city are patheti∣cally related in the following extracts from a letter written by an inhabitant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eye-witness:</P>
<P>“On the thirteenth of August, about three o'clock in the afternoon a sudden report was spread that a body of Russian hussars and cossacks appeared in sight of the little suburb. All the people were immediately in motion, and the whole city was filled with terrour, especially as we were certainly in∣formed that the whole Russian army was advancing from Meserick and Ko∣tigswalda, by the way of Landsberg. A re-enforcement was immediately sent to our piquet-guard in the suburb, amounting, by this junction, to three hundred men, who were soon attacked by the enemy, and the skirmish last∣ed from four till seven o'clock in the evening. During this dispute, we could plainly perceive, from our ramparts and church-steeple, several persons of distinction, mounted on English horses, reconnoitring our fortification through perspective glasses. They retired, however, when our cannon began to fire: then our piquet took possession of their former post in the suburb; and the re-enforcement we had sent from the city returned, after having broke down the bridge over the Oder. Next day Count Dohna, who command∣ed the army near Frankfort, sent in a re-enforcement of four battalions, ten squadrons, and a small body of hussars, under the command of Lieutenant-General Scherlemmer. The hussars and a body of dragoons were added to the piquet of the little suburb: the four battalions pitched their tents on the Anger, between the suburb and the fortification; and the rest of the dragoons remained in the field, to cover the long suburb. General Scherlem∣mer, attended by our governor, Colonel Schuck, went with a small party to observe the enemy; but were obliged to retire, and were pursued by the cossacks to the walls of the city. Between four and five o'clock next morn∣ing the poor inhabitants were roused from their sleep by the noise of the cannon, intermingled with the dismal shricks and hideous yellings of the cossacks belonging to the Russian army. Alarmed at this horrid noise, I ascended the church steeple, from whence I beheld the whole plain, extend∣ing from the little suburb to the forest, covered with the enemy's troops, and our light horse, supported by the infantry, engaged in different places with their irregulars. At eight I descried a body of the enemy's infantry, whose ran consisted of four or five thousand men, advancing towards the vineyard in the neighbourhood of which they had raised occasional <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the preceding evening: from these they now played on our piquet-p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd and huss fars, who were obliged to retire. Then they fired, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on the tents and baggage of the four battalions encamped on the Anger, who were also com∣pelled to retreat. Having thus cleared the environs, they threw into the city such a number of bombs and red-hot bullets, that by nine in the morning it was set on fire in three different places; and the streets being narrow, burned with such sury, that all our endeavours to extinguish it proved ineffectual. At this time the whole atmosphere appeared like a shower of siery rain and hail; and the miserable inhabitants thought of nothing but saving their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by running into the open fields. The whole place was filled with terrour and consternation, and resounded with the shricks of women and children, who ran about in the utmost distraction, exposed to the shot and the bomb-shells, which, bursting, tore in pieces every thing that stood in their way. As I led my wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, with a young child in her arms, and drove the rest of my children and servants half naked before me, those instruments of death and devasta∣tion fell about us like hail; but, by the mercy of God, we all escaped unhurt. Nothing could be more melancholy and affecting than a sight of the wretch∣ed people, flying in crouds, and leaving their all behind, while they rent the sky with their lamentations. Many women of distinction I saw without shoes and stockings, and almost without clothes, who had been roused from their beds, and ran out naked into the streets. When my family had reach∣ed the open plain I endeavoured to return, and save some of my effects; but I could not force my way through a multitude of people, thronging out at the gate, some sick and bed-ridden persons being carried on horseback and in carriages, and others conveyed on the backs of their friends, through a most dreadful scene of horrour and desolation. A great number of families from the open country, and defenceless towns in Prussia and Pomerania, had come hither for shelter with their most valuable effects, when the Russians first entered the king's territories. These, as well as the inhabitants, are all ruined▪ and many, who a few days ago possessed considerable wealth, are now reduced to the utmost indigence. The neighbouring towns and vil∣lages were soon crouded with the people of Custrin: the roads were filled with objects of misery: and nothing was seen but nakedness and despair; nothing heard but the cries of hunger, fear, and distraction. For my own part, I stayed all night at Goltz, and then proceeded for Berlin. Custrin is now a heap of ruins. The great magazine, the governor's house, the church, the palace, the store and artillery houses, in a word, the old and new towns, the suburbs, and all the bridges, were reduced to ashes; nay, after the ashes were destroyed, the piles and sterlings were burned to the water's edge. The writings of all the colleges, together with the archives of the coun∣try, were tota<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly consumed, together with a prodigious magazine of corn and flour, valued at some millions of crowns. The cannon in the ar∣senal were all melted; and the loaded bombs and cartridges, with a large quantity of gunpowder, went off at once with a most horrible explosion. A great number of the inhabitants are missing, supposed to have perished in the slames, or under the ruins of the houses, or to have been suffocated in subterraneous vaults and caverns, to which they had sled for safety”</P>
<P>Nothing could be more inhuman, or contrary to the practice of a generous enemy, than such vengeance wreaked upon the innocent inhabitants; for the Russians did not begin to batter the fortifications until all the rest of the place was destroyed. In the course of this campaign, the Russian cossacks are said to have plundered and burned fourteen large towns and two hundred villages▪ and wantonly butchered above two thousand defenceless women and children. Such monsters of barbarity ought to be excluded from all the privileges of human nature, and hunted down as wild beasts, without pity or cessation. What insamy ought those powers to incur, who employ and encourage such ruthless burbarians!</P></NOTE>. The Prussian army
<PB N="333" REF="337"/>
passed the night under arms, and next morning the cannon∣ade
was renewed against the enemy, who, nevertheless,
maintained that position, without flinching. On the
<PB N="334" REF="338"/>
twenty-seventh, they seemed determined to hazard another
action, and even attack the conquerors; instead of ad∣vancing,
however, they took the route of Landsberg;
<PB N="335" REF="339"/>
but afterwards turned off towards Vietzel, and posted
themselves between the river Warta and that village.
Immediately after the battle, General Fermer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Fermer was of Scottish extract, and General Browne actually a native of North-Britain.</NOTE>, who had
received a slight wound in the action, sent a trumpet, with
a letter to Lieutenant-General Dohna, desiring a sus∣pension
of arms for two or three days to bury the dead,
and take care of the wounded; and presenting to his
Prussian Majesty the humble request of General Browne,
who was much weakened by the loss of blood, that he
might have a passport, by virtue of which he could be re∣moved
to a place where he should find such accommoda∣tion
as his situation required. In answer to this message,
Count Dohna gave the Russian general to understand,
that as his Prussian Majesty remained master of the field,
he would give the necessary orders for interring the dead,
and taking care of the wounded on both sides: he refused
a suspension of arms, but granted the request of General
Browne; and concluded his letter, by complaining of the
outrages which the Russian troops still continued to com∣mit,
in pillaging and burning the King's villages.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The King of Prussia had no sooner re∣pulsed
the enemy in one quarter than his presence was re∣quired
in another. When he quitted Bohemia, Mareschal
Daun, at the head of the Austrian army, and the Prince
de Deuxponts, who commanded the forces of the empire,
advanced to the Elbe, in order to surround the King's
brother Prince Henry, who, without immediate succour,
would not have been able to preserve his footing in Saxony.
The Prussian monarch, therefore, determined to support
him with all possible expedition. In a few days after the
battle, he began his march from Custrin with a re-enforce∣ment
of twenty-four battalions and great part of his ca∣valry,
and pursued his route with such unwearied diligence,
that by the fifth day of September he reached Torgau, and
<PB N="336" REF="340"/>
on the eleventh joined his brother. Mareschal Daun had
posted himself at Stolpen, to the eastward of the Elbe, in
order to preserve an easy communication with the army of
the empire encamped in the neighbourhood of Koning∣stein,
to favour the operations of General Laudohn, who
had advanced through the Lower Lusatia to the frontiers
of Brandenburgh; to make a diversion from the southern
parts of Silesia, where a body of Austrian troops acted un∣der
the command of the Generals Haarache and De Ville;
and to interrupt the communication between Prince Hen∣ry
and the capital of Saxony. On the fifth day of Septem∣ber,
the garrison in the strong fortress of Koningstein sur∣rendered
themselves prisoners of war, after a very feeble
resistance, to the Prince de Deuxponts, who forthwith
took possession of the strong camp at Pirna. When the
King of Prussia, therefore, arrived at Dresden, he found
the army of the empire in this position, and Mareschal Daun
in a still stronger situation at Stolpen, with bridges of
communication thrown over the Elbe, so that he could not
attack them with any prospect of advantage. He had no
other resolution to take but that of endeavouring to cut
them off from supplies of provision, and with this view he
marched to Bautzen, which he occupied. This motion
obliged the Austrian general to quit his camp at Stolpen,
but he chose another of equal strength at Libau, yet he
afterwards advanced to Rittlitz, that he might be at hand
to seise the first favourable occasion of executing the re∣solution
he had formed to attack the Prussians. The King
having detached General Ratzow on his left, to take pos∣session
of Weissenberg, marched forwards with the body
of his army, and posted himself in the neighbourhood of
Hochkirchen, after having dislodged the Austrians from
that village. Matters were now brought to such a delicate
crisis, that a battle seemed inevitable, and equally desired
by both parties, as an event that would determine whether
the Austrians should be obliged to retreat for winter-quarters
into Bohemia, or be enabled to maintain their
ground in Saxony. In this situation Mareschal Daun
<PB N="337" REF="341"/>
resolved to act offensively, and formed a scheme for attack∣ing
the right flank of the Prussians by surprise. This
measure was suggested to him by an oversight of the
Prussians, who had neglected to occupy the heights that
commanded the village of Hochkirchen, which was only
guarded by a few free companies. He determined to take
the advantage of a very dark night, and to employ the
flower of his whole army on this important service, well
knowing, that should they penetrate through the flank of
the enemy, the whole Prussian army would be discon∣certed,
and in all probability entirely ruined. Having
taken his measures with wonderful secresy and circum∣spection,
the troops began to move in the night between
the thirteenth and fourteenth of October, favoured by a
thick fog, which greatly increased the darkness of the
night. Their first care was to take possession of the hill
that commanded Hochkirchen, from whence they poured
down upon the village, of which they took possession,
after having cut in pieces the free companies posted there.
The action began in this quarter about four in the morn∣ing,
and continued several hours with great fury, for, not∣withstanding
the impetuous efforts of the Austrian troops,
and the confusion occasioned among the Prussians by the
surprise, a vigorous stand was made by some general offi∣cers,
who, with admirable expedition and presence of
mind, assembled and arranged the troops as they could
take to their arms, and led them up to the attack without
distinction of regiment, place, or precedence. While the
action was obstinately and desperately maintained in this
place, amidst all the horrours of darkness, carnage, and
confusion, the King being alarmed, exerted all his per∣sonal
activity, address, and recollection, in drawing re∣gularity
from disorder, arranging the different corps,
altering positions, re-enforcing weak posts, encouraging
the soldiery, and opposing the efforts of the enemy; for
although they made their chief impression upon the right,
by the village of Hochkirchen, Mareschal Daun, in order
to divide the attention of the King, made another attack
<PB N="338" REF="342"/>
upon the left, which was with difficulty sustained, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
effectually prevented him from sending re-enforcements
to the right, where Mareschal Keith, under the greatest
disadvantages, bore the brunt of the enemy's chief endea∣vours.
Thus the battle raged till nine in the morning,
when this gallant officer was shot through the heart.
Prince Francis of Brunswick had met with the same fate;
Prince Maurice of Anhalt was wounded and taken pri∣soner,
and many others were either slain or disabled.
As the right wing had been surprised, the tents continued
standing, and greatly embarrassed them in their defence.
The soldiers had never been properly drawn up in order;
the enemy still persevered in their attack with successive
re-enforcements and redoubled resolution; and a consi∣derable
slaughter was made by their artillery, which they
had brought up to the heights of Hochkirchen. All these
circumstances concurring, could not fail to increase the
confusion and disaster of the Prussians; so that about ten
the King was obliged to retire to Dobreschutz, with the
loss of seven thousand men, of all his tents, and part of
his baggage. Nor had the Austrian general much cause
to boast of his victory. His loss of men was pretty near
equal to that of the Prussian monarch; and, whatever
reputation he might have acquired in foiling that enter∣prising
prince, certainly his design did not take effect in
its full extent, for the Prussians were next day in a condi∣tion
to hazard another engagement. The King of Prussia
had sustained no damage which he could not easily repair,
except the death of Mareschal Keith, which was doubt∣less
an irreparable misfortune<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As very little notice was taken, in the detail published by authority of any part which thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great man acted in the battle of Hochkirchen, and report was industriously circulated in this kingdom, that he was surprised in his tent, naked, and half asleep, we think it the duty of a candid historian <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vindicate his memory and reputation from the foul aspersion thrown by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> persidious and illiberal hand of enviou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> malice, or else contrived to screen som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other character from the imputation of misconduct. This task we are enable<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to perform by a gentleman of candour and undoubted credit, who learned th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> following particulars at Berlin from a person that was eye-witness of the whole transaction. Field-Mareschal Keith, who arrived in the camp the very day that preceded the battle, disapproved of the situation of the Prussian army, and remonstrated to the King on that subject. In consequence of his advice, a certain general was sent with a detachment to take possession of the heights that commanded the village of Hochkirchen; but by some fatality he mis∣carried. Mareschal Keith was not in any tent, but lodged with Prince Fran∣cis of Brunswick, in a house belonging to a Saxon major. When the first alarm was given in the night, he instantly mounted his horse, assembled a body of the nearest troops, and marched directly to the place that was attacked. The Austrians had taken possession of the hill which the Prussian officer was sent to occupy, and this they fortified with cannon: then they made them∣selves masters of the village in which the free companies of Anginelli had been posted. Mareschal Keith immediately conceived the design of the Au∣strian general, and knowing the importance of this place, thither directed all his efforts. He in person led on the troops to the attack of the village, from whence he drove the enemy; but being overpowered by numbers continually pouring down from the hills, he was obliged to retire in his turn. He rallied his men, returned to the charge, and regained possession of the place: being again repulsed by fresh re-enforcements of the enemy, he made another effort, entered the village a third time, and finding it untenable, ordered it to be set on fire. Thus he kept the Austrians at bay, and maintained a desperate con∣flict against the flower of the Austrian army, from four in the morning till nine, when the Prussians were formed, and began to file off in their retreat During the whole dispute he rallied the troops in person, charged at their head, and exposed his life in the hottest of a dreadful fire, like a private captain of grena∣diers. He found it necessary to exert himself in this manner, the better to remove the bad effects of the confusion that prevailed, and in order to inspirit the troops to their utmost exertion by his voice, presence, and example. Even when dangerously wounded, at eight in the morning, he refused to quit the field; but continued to signalise himself in the midst of the carnage until nine, when he received a second shot in his breast, and fell speechless into the arms of Mr. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bay, an English volunteer, who had attended him during the whole campaign. This gentleman, who was likewise wounded, applied to a Prussian officer for a file of men to remove the mareschal, being uncertain whether he was entirely deprived of life. His request was granted; but the soldiers, in advancing to the spot, were countermanded by another officer. He afterwards spoke on the same subject to one of the Prussian generals, a German prince, as he chanced to pass on horse-back: when Mr. Tibay told him the field-mareschal was lying wounded on the field, he asked if his wounds were mortal; and the other answering he was afraid they were, the prince shrugged up his shoul∣ders, and rode off without further question. The body of this great officer, being thus shamefully abandoned, was soon stripped by the Austrian stragglers, and lay exposed and undistinguished on the field of battle. In this situation it was perceived by Count Lasci, son of the general of that name, with whom Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eschal Keith had served in Russia. This young count had been the mareschal's pupil, and revered him as his military father, though employed in the Austrian service. He recognised the body by the large scar of a dangerous wound, which General Keith had received in his thigh at the siege of Ockza∣cow, and could not help bursting into tears to see his honoured master<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus ex∣tended at his feet, a naked, lifeless, and deserted corpse. He forhwith caused the body to be covered, and interred. It was afterwards taken up, and de∣cently buried by the curate of Hochkirchen; and, finally emoved to Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lin by order of the King of Prussia, who bestowed upon it chose funeral honours that were due to the dignified rank and transcendent merit of the de∣ceased; merit so universally acknowledged, that even the Saxons lamented him as their best friend and patron, who protected them from violence and outrage, even while he acted a principal part in subjecting them to the domi∣nion of his sovereign.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="343"/>
§ XXXVII. His Prussian Majesty remained with his
army ten days at Dobreschutz, during which he endea∣voured
to bring the Austrians to a second engagement, but
<PB N="340" REF="344"/>
Count Daun declined the invitation, and kept his forces
advantageously posted on eminences planted with artillery.
His aim having been frustrated at Hochkirchen, where
he fought with many advantages on his side, he would
not hazard another battle upon equal terms, with such an
enterprising enemy, rendered more vigilant by the check
he had received, already re-enforced from the army of
Prince Henry, and eager for an opportunity to retrieve
the laurel which had been snatched from him by the
wiles of stratagem, rather than by the hand of valour.
Count Daun having nothing more to hope from the active
operations of his own army, contented himself with
amusing the Prussian monarch in Lusatia, while the Au∣strian
generals, Harsche and De Ville, should prosecute
the reduction of Neiss and Cosel, in Silesia, which they
now actually invested. As the Prussian monarch could
not spare detachments to oppose every different corps of
his enemies that acted against him in different parts of his
dominions, he resolved to make up in activity what he
wanted in number, and if possible to raise the siege of
Neiss in person. With this view he decamped from Dob∣reschutz,
and in sight of the enemy marched to Gorlitz
without the least interruption. From thence he proceeded
towards Silesia with his usual expedition, notwithstanding
all the endeavours and activity of General Laudohn, who
<PB N="341" REF="345"/>
harrassed the rear of the Prussians, and gained some petty
advantages over them. Count Daun not only sent this
detached corps to retard them in their march, but at the
same time, by another route, detached a strong re-enforce∣ment
to the army of the besiegers. In the mean time,
having received intelligence that the army of Prince Henry
in Saxony was considerably weakened, he himself marched
thither, in hopes of expelling the Prince from that country,
and reducing the capital in the King's absence. Indeed,
his designs were still more extensive, for he proposed to
reduce Dresden, Leipsick, and Torgau at the same time;
the first with the main body under his own direction, the
second by the army of the Empire under the Prince de
Deuxponts, and the third by a corps under General Had∣dick,
while the forces directed by Laudohn should ex∣clude
the King from Lusatia. In execution of this plan
he marched directly to the Elbe, which he passed at Pirna,
and advanced to Dresden, which he hoped would sur∣render
without putting him to the trouble of a formal
siege. The army of Prince Henry had already retired to
the westward of this capital, before the Prince de Deux∣ponts,
who had found means to cut off his communication
with Leipsick, and even invested that city. During these
transactions, General Haddick advanced against Torgau.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The Field-Mareschal Count Daun ap∣pearing
on the sixth day of November within sight of
Dresden, at the head of sixty thousand men, encamped
next day at Lockowitz, and on the eighth his advanced
troops attacked the Prussian hussars and independent bat∣talions,
which were posted at Striessen and Gruenewiese.
Count Schmettau, who commanded the garrison, amount∣ing
to ten thousand men, apprehensive that, in the course
of skirmishing, the Austrian troops might enter the su∣burbs
pellmell, posted Colonel Itzenplitz, with seven hun∣dred
men, in the redoubts that surrounded the suburbs,
that in case of emergency they might support the irregu∣lars:
at the same time, as the houses that constituted the
suburbs were generally so high as to overlook the ramparts,
<PB N="342" REF="346"/>
and command the city, he prepared combustibles and
gave notice to the magistrates that they would be set on
fire as soon as an Austrian should appear within the place.
This must have been a dreadful declaration to the inha∣bitants
of these suburbs, which compose one of the most
elegant towns in Europe. In these houses, which were
generally lofty and magnificent, the fashionable and
wealthy class of people resided, and here a number of ar∣tists
carried on a variety of curious manufactures. In
vain the magistrates implored the mercy and forbearance
of the Prussian governour, and represented, in the most
submissive strain, that as they were unconcerned in the
war, they hoped they should be exempted from the hor∣rours
of devastation. In vain the royal family, who re∣mained
at Dresden, conjured him to spare that last refuge
of distressed royalty, and allow them at least a secure re∣sidence,
since they were deprived of every other comfort.
He continued inflexible, or rather determined to execute
the orders of his master, which indeed he could not
disobey with any regard to his own safety. On the ninth
day of November, about noon, the Austrian vanguard
attacked the advanced post of the garrison, repelled the
hussars, drove the independent battalions into the suburbs,
and forced three of the redoubts, while their cannon
played upon the town. The governour, expecting a vi∣gorous
attack next day, recalled his troops within the city,
after they had set fire to the suburbs. At three in the
morning the signal was made for this terrible conflagra∣tion,
which in a little time reduced to ashes the beautiful
suburbs of Pirna, which had so lately flourished as the seat
of gaiety, pleasure, and the ingenious arts. Every bosom
warmed with benevolence must be affected at the recital of
such calamities. It excites not only our compassion for
the unhappy sufferers, but also our resentment against the
perpetrators of such enormity. Next day Mareschal Daun
sent an officer to Count Schmettau, with a message, ex∣pressing
his surprize at the destruction of the suburbs in a
royal residence, an act of inhumanity unheard of among
<PB N="343" REF="347"/>
christians. He desired to know if it was by the gover∣nour's
order this measure was taken, and assured him,
that he should be responsible, in his person, for whatever
outrages had been or might be committed against a place
in which a royal family resided. Schmettau gave him to
understand that he had orders to defend the town to the
last extremity, and that the preservation of what remained
depended entirely on the conduct of his excellency; for,
should he think proper to attack the place, he (the gover∣nour)
would defend himself from house to house, and from
street to street, and even make his last effort in the royal
palace, rather than abandon the city. He excused the
destruction of the suburbs as a necessary measure, autho∣rised
by the practice of war; but he would have found it
a difficult task to reconcile this step to the laws of eternal
justice, and far less to the dictates of common humanity.
Indeed, if the scene had happened in an enemy's country,
or if no other step could have saved the lives and liberties of
himself and his garrison, such a desperate remedy might
have stood excused by the law of nature and of nations:
but on this occasion he occupied a neutral city, over
which he could exercise no other power and authority
but that which he derived from illegal force and violence;
nor was he at all reduced to the necessity of sacrificing the
place to his own safety, inasmuch as he might have re∣tired
unmolested, by virtue of an honourable capitulation,
which however he did not demand. Whether the pe∣remptory
order of a superior will, <HI>in soro conscientiae,</HI> justify
an officer who hath committed an illegal or inhuman
action, is a question that an English reader will scarce
leave to the determination of a German casuist with one
hundred and fifty thousand armed men in his retinue. Be
this as it will, Mr. Ponickau, the Saxon minister, imme∣diately
after this tragedy was acted, without waiting for
his master's orders, presented a memorial to the Diet of
the Empire, complaining of it as an action reserved for the
history of the war which the King of Prussia had kindled
in Germany, to be transmitted to fugure ages. He af∣firmed,
<PB N="344" REF="348"/>
that, in execution of Schmettau's orders the soldiers
had dispersed themselves in the streets of the Pirna and
Witchen suburbs, broke open the houses and shops, set
fire to the combustibles, added fresh fuel, and then shut
the doors; that the violence of the flames was kept up by
red-hot balls fired into the houses, and along the streets;
that the wretched inhabitants, who forsook their burning
houses, were slain by the fire of the cannon and small arms;
that those who endeavoured to save their persons and effects
were pushed down and destroyed by the bayonets of the Prus∣sian
soldiers, posted in the streets for that purpose: he enu∣merated
particular instances of inhuman barbarity, and de∣clared
that a great number of people perished, either
amidst the flames, or under the ruins of the houses. The
destruction of two hundred and fifty elegant houses, and
the total ruin of the inhabitants, were circumstances in
themselves so deplorable, as to need no aggravation: but
the account of the Saxon minister was shamefully exagge∣rated,
and all the particular instances of cruelty false in
every circumstance. Baron Plotho, the minister of Bran∣denburgh,
did not fail to answer every article of the Saxon
memorial, and refute the particulars therein alledged, in a
fair detail, authenticated by certificates under the hands
of the magistrates, judges, and principal inhabitants of
Dresden. The most extraordinary part of this defence or
vindication was the conclusion, in which the Baron so∣lemnly
assured the Diet, that the King of Prussia, from
his great love to mankind, always felt the greatest emotion
of soul, and the most exquisite concern, at the effusion of
blood, the devastation of cities and countries, and the hor∣rours
of war, by which so many thousand fellow creatures
were overwhelmed; and that if his sincere and honest
inclination to procure peace to Germany, his dear coun∣try,
had met with the least regard, the present war, at∣tended
with such bloodshed and desolation, would have
been prevented and avoided. He, therefore, declared <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
those who excited the present troubles, who, instead o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
extinguishing, threw oil upon the flames, must an∣swer
<PB N="345" REF="349"/>
to God for the seas of blood that had been, and would
be shed, for the devastation of so many countries, and the
entire ruin of so many innocent individuals. Such de∣clarations
cost nothing to those hardened politicians, who,
feeling no internal check, are determined to sacrifice every
consideration to the motives of rapacity and ambition. It
would be happy, however, for mankind, were princes
taught to believe that there is really an omnipotent and
all-judging power, that will exact a severe account of
their conduct, and punish them for their guilt, without any
respect to their persons; that pillaging a whole people is
more cruel than robbing a single person; and that the
massacre of thousands is, at least, as criminal as private
murther.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. While Count Daun was employed in making
a fruitless attempt upon the capital of Saxony, the King of
Prussia proceeded in his march to Neiss, which was com∣pletely
invested on the third day of October. The opera∣tions
of the siege were carried on with great vigour by the
Austrian general, De Harsche, and the place was as vi∣gorously
defended by the Prussian governour, Theskau,
till the first day of November, when the Prussian mo∣narch
approached, and obliged the besiegers to abandon
their enterprise. M. de Harsche having raised the siege,
the King detached General Fouquet with a body of troops
across the river Neiss, and immediately the blockade of
Cosel was likewise abandoned. De Harsche retired to Bo∣hemia,
and De Vill hovered about Jagernsdorf. The
fortress of Neiss was no sooner relieved than the King of
Prussia began his march on his return to Saxony, where
his immediate presence was required. At the same time,
the two bodies under the Generals Dohna and Wedel
penetrated by different routes into that country. The
former had been left at Custrin, to watch the motions of
the Russians, who had by this time retreated to the Vistula,
and even crossed that river at Thorn, and the other had,
during the campaign, observed the Swedes, who had now
entirely evacuated the Prussian territories, so that Wedel
<PB N="346" REF="350"/>
was at liberty to co-operate with the King in Saxony.
He accordingly marched to Torgau, the siege of which
had been undertaken by the Austrian general, Haddick,
who was repulsed by Wedel, and even pursued to the
neighbourhood of Eulenbourg. Wedel, being afterwards
joined by Dohna, drove him from thence with considerable
loss, and then raised the siege of Leipsick. Mean while,
the King prosecuted his march towards the capital
of Saxony, driving before him the body of Austrian
troops, under Laudohn, who retreated to Zittau. On the
tenth day of November Count Daun retired from Dresden,
and with the army of the Empire fell back towards Bo∣hemia;
and on the twentieth the King arrived in that
city, where he approved of the governour's conduct. The
Russian general foreseeing that he should not be able to
maintain his ground during the winter in Pomerania, un∣less
he could secure some sea-port on the Baltick, by which
he might be supplied with provisions, detached General
Palmbach, with fifteen thousand men, to besiege the town
of Colberg, an inconsiderable place, very meanly fortified.
It was accordingly invested on the third day of October;
but the besiegers were either so ill provided with proper
implements, or so little acquainted with operations of
this nature, that the garrison, though feeble, maintained
the place against all their attacks for six-and-twenty days;
at the expiration of which they abandoned their enter∣prise,
and cruelly ravaged the open country in their re∣treat.
Thus, by the activity and valour of the Prussian
monarch, his generals, and officers, six sieges were raised
almost at the same period, namely, those of Colberg,
Neiss, Cosel, Torgau, Leipsick, and Dresden.</P>
<P>§ XL. The variety of fortune which the King of
Prussia experienced in the course of this campaign was very
remarkable; but the spirit of his conduct, and the ra∣pidity
of his motions, were altogether without example.
In the former campaign we were dazzled with the lustre of
his victories; in this we admire his fortitude and skill in
stemming the different torrents of adversity, and rising
<PB N="347" REF="351"/>
superior to his evil fotune. One can hardly without
astonishment recollect, that in the course of a few months
he invaded Moravia, invested Olmutz, and was obliged to
relinquish that design; that he marched through an ene∣my's
country, in the face of a great army, which, though
it harrassed him in his retreat, could not, in a route of an
hundred miles, obtain any advantage over him; that, in
spite of his disaster at Olmutz, and the difficulties of such
a march, he penetrated into Bohemia, drove the enemy
from Koningsgratz, executed another dangerous and fa∣tiguing
march to the Oder, defeated a great army of Rus∣sians,
and returned by the way of Saxony, from whence he
drove the Austrian and Imperial armies; that after his de∣feat
at Hochkirchen, where he lost two of his best generals,
and was obliged to leave his tents standing, he baffled the
vigilance and superior number of the victorious army,
rushed like a whirlwind to the relief of Silesia, invaded by
an Austrian army, which he compelled to retire with pre∣cipitation
from that province; that, with the same rapidity
of motion, he wheeled about to Saxony, and once more
rescued it from the hands of his adversaries; that in one
campaign he made twice the circuit of his dominions, re∣lieved
them all in their turns, and kept all his possessions
entire against the united efforts of numerous armies, con∣ducted
by generals of consummate skill and undaunted
resolution. His character would have been still more
complete, if his moderation had been equal to his courage,
but in this particular we cannot applaud his conduct. In∣censed
by the persecuting spirit of his enemies, he wreaked
his vengeance on those who had done him no injury; and
the cruelties which the Russians had committed in his
dominions were retaliated upon the unfortunate inha∣bitants
of Saxony. In the latter end of September, the
president of the Prussian military directory sent a letter to
the magistrates of Leipsick, requiring them in the King's
name to pay a new contribution of six hundred thousand
crowns, and to begin immediately with the payment of
one-third part, on pain of military execution. In answer
<PB N="348" REF="352"/>
to this demand the magistrates represented that the city
having been exhausted by the enormous contributions
already raised, and absolutely incapable of furnishing fur∣ther
supplies; that the trade was stagnated and ruined,
and the inhabitants so impoverished, that they could no
longer pay the ordinary taxes. This remonstrance made
no impression. At five in the morning the Prussian sol∣diers
assembled, and were posted in all the streets, squares,
market-places, caemeteries, towers, and steeples; then the
gates being shut, in order to exclude the populace of the
suburbs from the city, the senators were brought into the
town-hall, and accosted by General Hauss, who told them
the king his master would have money; and if they re∣fused
to part with it the city should be plundered. To
this peremptory address they replied to this effect: “We
have no more money—we have nothing left but life; and
we recommend ourselves to the King's mercy.” In
consequence of this declaration, dispositions were made for
giving up the city to be plundered. Cannon were planted
in all the streets, the inhabitants were ordered to remain
within doors, and every house resounded with dismal cries
and lamentations. The dreaded pillage, however, was
converted into a regular exaction. A party of soldiers,
commanded by a subaltern, went from house to house,
signifying to every burgher that he should produce all his
specie, on pain of immediate pillage and massacre; and
every inhabitant delivered up his all without further hesi∣tation.
About six in the evening, the soldiers returned to
their quarters; but the magistrates were detained in con∣finement,
and all the citizens were overwhelmed with grief
and consternation. Happy Britain, who knowest such
grievances only by report! When the King of Prussia
first entered Saxony, at the beginning of the war, he de∣clared
the had no design to make a conquest of that electo∣rate,
but only to keep it as a depositum for the security of
his own dominions, until he could oblige his enemies to
acquiesce in reasonable terms of peace; but upon his last
arrival at Dresden he adopted a new resolution. In the
<PB N="349" REF="353"/>
beginning of December the Prussian directory of war
issued a decree to the deputies of the states of the electorate,
demanding a certain quantity of flour and forage, accord∣ing
to the convention formerly settled; at the same time
signifying, that though the King of Prussia had hitherto
treated the electorate as a country taken under his special
protection, the face of affairs was now changed in such a
manner, that for the future he would consider it in no
other light than that of a conquered country. The
Russians had seised in Prussia all the estates and effects
belonging to the King's officers: a retaliation was now
made upon the effects of the Saxon officers who served in
the Russian army. Seals were put on all the cabinets con∣taining
papers belonging to the privy-counsellors of his
Polish Majesty, and they themselves ordered to depart for
Warsaw at a very short warning. Though the city had
been impoverished by former exactions, and very lately
subjected to military execution, the King of Prussia de∣manded
fresh contributions, and even extorted them by
dint of severities that shock humanity. He surrounded
the exchange with soldiers, and confining the merchants
to straw-beds and naked apartments, obliged them to
draw bills for very large sums on their foreign corre∣spondents:
a method of proceeding much more suitable
to the despotism of a Persian sophi towards a conquered
people who professed a different faith, than reconcileable
to the character of a protestant prince towards a peaceable
nation of brethren, with whom he was connected by the
common ties of neighbourhood and religion. Even if they
had acted as declared enemies, and been subdued with
arms in their hands, the excesses of war on the side of the
conqueror ought to have ceased with the hostilities of the
conqueror, who, by submitting to his sway, would have
become his subjects, and in that capacity had a claim to
his protection. To retaliate upon the Saxons, who had
espoused no quarrel, the barbarities committed by the
Russians, with whom he was actually at war, and to treat
as a conquered province a neutral country, which his ene∣mies
<PB N="350" REF="354"/>
had entered by violence, and been obliged to evacuate
by force of arms, was a species of conduct founded on pre∣tences
which overturn all right, and confound all reason.</P>
<P>§ XLI. Having recorded all the transactions of the
campaign, except those in which the Swedes were con∣cerned,
it now remains that we should particularise the
progress which was made in Pomerania by the troops of
that nation, under the command of Count Hamilton. We
have already observed, that in the beginning of the year the
Prussian general, Lehwald, had compelled them to evacu∣ate
the whole province, except Stralsund, which was like∣wise
invested. This, in all probability, would have been
besieged in form, had not Lehwald resigned the command
of the Prussians, on account of his great age and infirmi∣ties,
and his successor Count Dohna been obliged to with∣draw
his troops, in order to oppose the Russian army on
the other side of Pomerania. The blockade of Stralsund
being consequently raised, and that part of the country
entirely evacuated by the Prussians, the Swedish troops
advanced again from the isle of Rugen, to which they had
retired: but the supplies and re-enforcements they ex∣pected
from Stockholm were delayed in such a manner,
either from a deficiency in the subsidies promised by France,
or from the management of those who were averse to the
war, that great part of the season was elapsed before they
undertook any important enterprise. Indeed, while they
lay encamped under the cannon of Stralsund, waiting for
these supplies, their operations were retarded by the ex∣plosion
of a whole ship-load of gunpowder intended for
their use; an event imputed to the practices of the Prussian
party in Sweden, which at this period seemed to gain
ground, and even threatened a change in the ministry.
At length the re-enforcement arrived about the latter end
of June, and their general seemed determined to act with
vigour. In the beginning of July, his army being put in
motion, he sent a detachment to dislodge the few Prussian
troops that were left at Anclam, Demmin, and other
places, to guard that frontier; and they retreated accord∣ingly.
<PB N="351" REF="355"/>
Count Hamilton having nothing further to op∣pose
him in the field, in a very little time recovered all Swe∣dish
Pomerania, and even made hot incursions into the
Prussian territories. Mean while, a combined fleet of thirty-three
Russian and seven Swedish ships of war appeared in
the Baltick, and anchored between the islands of Dragoe
and Amagh; but they neither landed troops, nor com∣mitted
hostilities. The Swedish general advanced as far
as Fehrbellin, sent out parties that raised contributions
within five-and-twenty miles of Berlin, and threw the in∣habitants
of that capital into the utmost consternation.
The King of Prussia, alarmed at their progress, dispatched
General Wedel from Dresden, with a body of troops that
were augmented on their march; so that, on the twen∣tieth
of September, he found himself at Berlin with eleven
thousand effective men, at the head of whom he proceeded
against Count Hamilton, while the Prince of Bevern, with
five thousand, advanced on the other side from Stetin. At
their approach, the Swedish commander retired, after
having left a garrison of fourteen hundred men at Fehrbel∣lin,
in order to retard the Prussians, and secure the retreat
of his army. The place was immediately attacked by Ge∣neral
Wedel; and though the Swedes disputed the ground
from house to house with uncommon obstinacy, he at
last drove them out of the town, with the loss of one
half of their number either killed or taken prisoners.
The body of the Swedish army, without hazarding any
other action, immediately evacuated the Prussian terri∣tories,
and returned to the neighbourhood of Stralsund,
intending to take winter-quarters in the isle of Rugen.
Count Hamilton, either disgusted at the restrictions he
had been laid under, or finding himself unable to act in
such a manner as might redound to the advantage of
his reputation, threw up his command, retired from the
army, and resigned all his other employments.</P>
<P>§ XLII. The King of Prussia was not only favoured
by a considerable party in Sweden, but he had also raised
a strong interest in Poland, among such Palatines as had
<PB N="352" REF="356"/>
always opposed the measures of the reigning family
These were now re-enforced by many patriots, who
dreaded the vicinity, and suspected the designs of the
Russian army. The diet of the republick was opened on
the second day of November; and, after warm debates,
M. Malachowski was unanimously elected mareschal:
but no sooner had the chamber of nuncios begun their
deliberations, than a number of voices were raised against
the encroachments of the Russian troops, who had taken
up their residence in Poland; and heavy complaints were
made of the damages sustained from their cruelty and ra∣pine.
Great pains were taken to appease these clamours;
and many were prevailed upon to refer these grievances to
the king in senate; but when this difficulty seemed almost
surmounted, Padhorski, the nuncio of Volhinia, stood up,
and declared that he would not permit any other point to
be discussed in the diet while the Russians maintained the
least footing within the territories of the republick. Vain
were all the attempts of the courtiers to persuade and
mollify this inflexible patriot, he solemnly protested against
their proceedings, and hastily withdrew; so that the Ma∣reschal
was obliged to dissolve the assembly, and recourse
was had to a <HI>senatus consilium,</HI> to concert proper measures to
be taken in the present conjuncture. The King of Poland
was, on this occasion, likewise disappointed in his views
of providing for his son, Prince Charles, in the duchy of
Courland. He had been recommended by the court of
Russia, and even approved by the states of that country;
but two difficulties occurred. The states declared they
could not proceed to a new election during the life of their
former duke, Count Biron, who was still alive, though
a prisoner in Siberia, unless their duchy should be de∣clared
vacant by the King and republick of Poland; and,
according to the laws of that country, no prince could be
elected, until he should have declared himself of the
Augsburgh confession. His Polish Majesty, however,
being determined to surmount all obstacles to his son's
<PB N="353" REF="357"/>
interest, ordered Count Malachoski, high chancellor of
Poland, to deliver to Prince Charles a diploma, by which
the King granted permission to the states of Courland to
elect that prince for their duke, and appointed the day
for his election and instalment, which accordingly took
place in the month of January, notwithstanding the cla∣mour
of many Polish grandees, who persisted in affirming
that the king had no power to grant such permission with∣out
the consent of the diet. The vicissitudes of the cam∣paign
had produced no revolutions in the several systems
adopted by the different powers in Europe. The Czarina,
who in the month of June had signified her sentiments and
designs against the King of Prussia, in a declaration de∣livered
to all the foreign ministers at Petersburgh, seemed
now, more than ever, determined to act vigorously in be∣half
of the Empress-Queen of Hungary, and the unfortu∣nate
King of Poland, who still resided at Warsaw. The
court of Vienna distributed among the Imperial ministers
at the several courts of the Empire copies of a rescript,
explaining the conduct of her generals since the beginning
of the campaign, and concluding with expressions of self-approbation
to this effect: “Though the issue of the
campaign be not as yet entirely satisfactory, and such as
might be desired, the Imperial court enjoys, at least, the
sincere satisfaction of reflecting, that, according to the
change of circumstances, it instantly took the most vigorous
resolutions; that it was never deficient in any thing that
might contribute to the good of the common cause, and
is now employed in making preparations, from which the
most happy consequences may be expected.”</P>
<P>§ XLIII. We have already hinted at a decree of the
Aulick council of the Empire, published in the month of
August, enjoining all directors of circles, all Imperial
towns, and the noblesse of the Empire, to transmit to
Vienna an exact list of all those who had disobeyed the
avocatoria of the Empire, and adhered to the rebellion
raised by the Elector of Brandenburgh; that their reve∣nues
might be sequestered, and themselves punished in their
<PB N="354" REF="358"/>
honours, persons, and effects. As the Elector of Hanover
was plainly pointed out, and, indeed, expressly mentioned
in this decree, the King of Great-Britain, by the hands
of Baron Gemmegen, his electoral minister, presented a
memorial to the diet of the Empire in the month of No∣vember,
enumerating the instances in which he had
exerted himself, and even exposed his life, for the preser∣vation
and aggrandisement of the house of Austria. In
return for these important services, he observed that the
Empress-Queen had refused him the assistance stipulated
in treaties against an invasion planned by France, whose
hatred he had drawn upon himself by his friendship to that
princess; and his Imperial Majesty even denied him the
dictatorial letters which he sollicited: that the courts of
Vienna had signed a treaty with the crown of France, in
which it was stipulated that the French troops should
pass the Weser, and invade the electorate of Hanover,
where they were joined by the troops of the Empress-Queen,
who ravaged his Britannick Majesty's dominions
with greater cruelty than even the French had practised;
and the same Duke of Cumberland, who had been wounded
at Dettingen in the defence of her Imperial Majesty,
was obliged to fight at Hastenbeck against the troops of
that very princess, in defence of his father's dominions;
that she sent commissaries to Hanover, who shared with
the crown of France the contributions extorted from the
electorate; rejected all proposals of peace, and dismissed
from her court the minister of Brunswick-Lunenbourg:
that his Imperial Majesty, who had sworn to protect the
Empire, and oppose the entrance of foreign troops destined
to oppress any of the states of Germany, afterwards re∣quired
the King of England to withdraw his troops from
the countries which they occupied, that a French army
might again have free passage into his German dominions:
that the Emperor had recalled these troops, released them
from their allegiance to their sovereign, enjoined them to
abandon their posts, their colours, and the service in
which they were embarked, on pain of being punished in
<PB N="355" REF="359"/>
body, honour, and estate; and that the King of England
himself was threatened with the ban of the Empire. He
took notice, that, in quality of elector, he had been ac∣cused
of refusing to concur with the resolutions of the diet
taken in the preceding year, of entering into alliance with
the King of Prussia, joining his troops to the armies of
that prince, employing auxiliaries belonging to the states
of the Empire, sending English forces into Germany,
where they had taken possession of Embden, and exacting
contributions in different parts of Germany. In answer
to these imputations, he alledged that he could not, con∣sistent
with his own safety, or the dictates of common
sense, concur with a majority, in joining his troops,
which were immediately necessary for his own defence,
to those which, from the arbitrary views of the court of
Vienna, were led against his friend and ally, the King of
Prussia, by a prince who did not belong to the generality
of the Empire, and on whom the command had been con∣ferred,
without a previous conclusum of the Germanick
body; that, with respect to his alliance with the King
of Prussia, he had a right, when deserted by his former
allies, to seek assistance wheresoever it could be procured:
and surely no just grounds of complaint could be offered
against that which his Prussian Majesty lent, to deliver
the electroal states of Brunswick, as well as those of
Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel, Hesse, and Buckebourg, from
the oppressions of their common enemy. Posterity, he
said, would hardly believe, that at a time when the troops of
Austria, the Palatinate, and Wirtemberg, were engaged
to invade the countries of the Empire, other members of
the Germanick body, who employed auxiliaries in their
defence, should be threatened with outlawry and seques∣tration.
He owned, that, in quality of king, he had sent
over English troops to Germany, and taken possession of
Embden; steps for which he was accountable to no power
upon earth, although the constitution of the Empire per∣mit
the co-estates to make use of foreign troops, not indeed
for the purpose of invasion or conquest in Germany, but for
their defence and preservation. He also acknowledged that
<PB N="356" REF="360"/>
he had resented the conduct, and chastised the injustice, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
those co-estates who had assisted his enemies, and helped to
ravage his dominions; inferring, that if the crown of France
was free to pillage the estates of the Duke of Brunswick, and
the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, because they had supplied
the King of England with auxiliaries; if the Empress-Queen
had a right to appropriate to herself half of the
contributions raised by the French King in these countries,
surely his Britannick-Majesty had an equal right to make
those feel the burthen of the war who had favoured the
unjust enterprises of his enemies. He expressed his hope,
that the diet, after having duely considered these circum∣stances,
would, by way of advice, propose to his Imperial
Majesty that he should annul his most inconsistent man∣dates
and not only take effectual measures to protect the
electorate and its allies, but also give orders for com∣mencing
against the Empress-Queen, as archduchess of
Austria, the Elector Palatine, and the Duke of Wirtem∣berg,
such proceedings as she wanted to enforce against
his Britannick Majesty, Elector of Brunswick-Lunen∣bourg.
For this purpose the minister now requested their
excellencies to ask immediately the necessary instructions
for their principals. The rest of this long memorial con∣tained
a justification of his Britannick Majesty's conduct
in deviating from the capitulation of Closter-Seven; with
a refutation of the arguments adduced, and a retortion of
the reproaches levelled against the King of England, in
the paper or manifesto composed and published under
the direction of the French ministry, and intituled, “A
Parallel of the Conduct of the King of France with that
of the King of England, relative to the Breach of the Capi∣tulation
of Closter-Seven by the Hanoverians.” But to this
invective a more circumstantial answer was published:
in which, among other curious particulars, the letter of
expostulation, said to have been written by the Prussia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
monarch to the King of Great-Britain after the defea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at Collin, is treated as an infamous piece of forgery, pro¦duced
by some venal pen employed to impose upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
publick. The author also, in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> endeavours to demon¦strate
<PB N="357" REF="361"/>
his Britannick Majesty's aversion to a continental
war, very justly observes, that “none but such as are
unacquainted with the maritime force of England, can be∣lieve,
that, without a diversion on the continent, to em∣ploy
part of the enemy's force, she is not in a condition to
hope for success, and maintain her superiority at sea. Eng∣land,
therefore, had no interest to foment quarrels or
wars in Europe; but, for the same reason, there was room
to fear that France would embrace a different system:
accordingly, she took no pains to conceal her views, and
her envoys declared publickly that a war upon the conti∣nent
was inevitable; and that the King's dominions in
Germany would be its principal object.” He afterwards,
in the course of his argumentation, adds, “that they must
be very ignorant, indeed, who imagine that the forces of
England are not able to resist those of France, unless the
latter be hindered from turning all her efforts to the sea.
In case of a war upon the continent, the two powers must
pay subsidies; only with this difference, that France can
employ her own land forces, and aspire at conquests.”
Such were the professed sentiments of the British ministry,
founded upon eternal truth and demonstration, and openly
avowed, when the business was to prove that it was not
the interest of Great-Britain to maintain a war upon the
continent; but, afterwards, when this continental war was
eagerly espoused, sostered, and cherished by the blood and
treasure of the English nation, then the partisans of that
very ministry, which had thus declared that England,
without any diversion on the continent of Europe, was
an over-match for France by sea, which may be termed
the British element; then their partisans, their cham∣pions,
declaimers, and dependants, were taught to rise in
rebellion against their former doctrine, and, in defiance of
common sense and reflextion, affirm that a diversion in
Germany was absolutely necessary to the successful issue of
England's operations, in Asia, Africa, and America. Not∣withstanding
all the facts and arguments assembled in this
elaborate memorial, to expose the ingratitude of the Em∣press-Queen,
and demonstrate the oppressive measures
<PB N="358" REF="362"/>
adopted by the Imperial power, it remains to be proved,
that the member of a community is not obliged to yield
obedience to the resolutions taken, and the decrees pub∣lished,
by the majority of those who compose this com∣munity;
especially when re-enforced with the authority
of the supreme magistrate, and not repugnant to the
fundamental constitution on which that community was
established.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. If the Empress-Queen was not gratified to
the extent of her wishes in the fortune of the campaign, at
least her self-importance was flattered in another point,
which could not fail of being interesting to a princess famed
for a glowing zeal and inviolable attachment to the religion
of Rome. In the month of August the Pope conferred
upon her the title of Apostolical Queen of Hungary, con∣veyed
by a brief, in which he extolled her piety, and
launched out into retrospective eulogiums of her prede∣cessors,
the princes of Hungary, who had been always
accustomed to fight and overcome for the catholick faith
under this holy banner. This compliment, however,
she did not derive from the regard of Prosper Lambertini,
who exercised the papal sway under the assumed name of
Benedict XIV. That pontiff, universally esteemed for his
good sense, moderation, and humanity, had breathed his
last in the month of April, in the eighty-fourth year of
his age; and in July was succeeded in the papacy by
Cardinal Charles Rezzonico, Bishop of Padua, by birth a
Venetian. He was formely auditor of the Rota; after∣wards
promoted to the purple by Pope Clement XII. at
the nomination of the republick of Venice; was distin∣guished
by the title of St. Maria d'Ara Coeli, the princi∣pal
convent of the Cordeliers, and nominated protector
of the Pandours, or Illyrians. When he ascended the
papal chair, he assumed the name of Clement XIII. in
gratitude to the last of that name, who was his benefactor.
Though of a disagreeable person, and even deformed in
his body, he enjoyed good health, and a vigorous consti∣tution.
As an ecclesiastick, his life was exemplary; his
morals were pure and unimpeached; in his character he
<PB N="359" REF="363"/>
is said to have been learned, diligent, steady, devout, and
in every respect worthy to succeed such a predecessor as
Benedict.</P>
<P>§ XLV. The King of Spain wisely persisted in reaping
the advantages of a neutrality, notwithstanding the in∣trigues
of the French partisans at the court of Madrid,
who endeavoured to alarm his jealousy by the conquests
which the English had projected in America. The King
of Sardinia sagaciously kept aloof, resolving, in imitation
of his predecessors, to maintain his power on a respectable
footing, and be ready to seise all opportunities to extend
and promote the interest of his crown, and the advantage
of his country. As for the King of Portugal, he had
prudently embraced the same system of forbearance; but
in the latter end of the season his attention was engrossed
by a domestick incident of a very extraordinary nature.
Whether he had, by particular instances of severity, ex∣asperated
the minds of certain individuals, and exercised
his dominion in such acts of arbitrary power as excited a
general spirit of disaffection among his nobility; or,
lastly, by the vigorous measures pursued against the en∣croaching
Jesuits in Paraguay, and their correspondents
in Portugal, had incurred the resentment of that society,
we shall not pretend to determine: perhaps all these mo∣tives
concurred in giving birth to a conspiracy against his
life, which was actually executed at this juncture with the
most desperate resolution. On the third day of September,
the King, according to custom, going out in a carriage to
take the air, accompanied by one domestick, was, in the
night, at a solitary place near Belem, attacked by three
men on horseback, armed with musquetoons, one of whom
fired his piece at the coachman without effect. The man,
however, terrified both on his own account and that of his
sovereign's, drove the mules at full speed; a circumstance
which in some measure disconcerted the other two
conspirators, who pursued him at full gallop, and having
no leisure to take aim, discharged their pieces at random
through the back of the carriage. The slugs with which
<PB N="360" REF="364"/>
they were loaded happened to pass between the King's
right arm and his breast, dilacerating the parts from the
shoulder to the elbow, but without damaging the bone, or
penetrating into the cavity of the body. Finding himself
grievously wounded, and the blood flowing a-pace, he,
with such presence of mind as cannot be sufficiently ad∣mired,
instead of proceeding to the palace, which was at
some distance, ordered the coachman to return to Jun∣queria,
where his principal surgeon resided, and there his
wounds were immediately dressed. By this resolution, he
not only prevented the irreparable mischief that might
have arisen from an excessive effusion of blood; but, with∣out
all doubt, saved his life from the hands of other
assassins, posted on the road to accomplish the regicide,
in case he should escape alive from the first attack. This
instance of the King's recollection was magnified into a
miracle, on a supposition that it must have been the effect
of divine inspiration; and, indeed, among a people ad∣dicted
to superstition, might well pass for a favourable in∣terposition
of Providence. The King, being thus disabled
in his right arm, issued a decree, investing the Queen with
the absolute power of government. In the mean time,
no person had access to his presence but herself, the first
minister, the Cardinal de Saldanha, the physicians, and
surgeons. An embargo was immediately laid on all the
shipping in the port of Lisbon. Rewards were publickly
offered, together with promise of pardon to the accom∣plices,
for detecting any of the assassins; and such other
measures used, that in a little time the whole conspiracy
was discovered: a conspiracy the more dangerous, as it
appeared to have been formed by persons of the first quality
and influence. The Duke de Aveiro, of the family of
Mascarenhas; the Marquis de Tavora, who had been
viceroy of Goa, and now actually enjoyed the commission
of general of the horse; the Count de Attouguia, the
Marquis de Alloria, together with their wives, children,
and whole families, were arrested immediately after the
assassination, as principals in the design; and many other
<PB N="361" REF="365"/>
accomplices, including some Jesuits, were apprehended in
the sequel. The further proceedings on this mysterious
affair, with the fate of the conspirators, will be particu∣larised
among the transactions of the following year. At
present, it will be sufficient to observe, that the King's
wounds were attended with no bad consequences; nor did
the imprisonment of those noblemen produce any distur∣bance
in the kingdom.</P>
<P>§ XLVI. The domestick occurrences of France were
tissued with a continuation of the disputes between the
parliaments and clergy, touching the bull Unigenitus.
In vain the King had interposed his authority; first
proposing an accommodation; then commanding the par∣liament
to forbear taking cognizance of a religious contest,
which did not fall under their jurisdiction; and, thirdly,
banishing their persons, and abrogating their power. He
afterwards found it necessary to the peace of his dominions
to recall and re-instate those venerable patriots; and,
being convinced of the intolerable insolence and turbulent
spirit of the Archbishop of Paris, had exiled that prelate
in his turn. He was no sooner re-admitted to his function,
than he resumed his former conduct, touching the denial
of the sacraments to those who refused to acknowledge the
bull Unigenitus: he even acted with redoubled zeal; in∣trigued
with the other prelates; caballed among the in∣ferior
clergy; and not only revived, but augmented, the
troubles throughout the whole kingdom. Bishops, cu∣rates,
and monks presumed to with-hold spiritual conso∣lation
from persons in extremity, and were punished by
the civil power. Other parliaments of the kingdom
followed the example exhibited by that of Paris, in asserting
their authority and privileges. The King commanded
them to desist, on pain of incurring his indignation: they
remonstrated, and persevered; while the Archbishop re∣peated
his injunctions and censures, and continued to in∣flame
the dispute to such a dangerous degree, that he was
given to understand he should be again obliged to quit the
capital, if he did not proceed with more moderation.
<PB N="362" REF="366"/>
But the chief care of the French ministry was employed
in regulating the finances, and establishing funds of credi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for raising money to pay subsidies, and maintain the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in Europe and America. In the course of this year they
had not only considerably re-enforced their armies in Ger<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>many,
but made surprising efforts to supply the colony o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Canada with troops, artillery, stores, and ammunition
for its defence against the operations of the British forces
which greatly out-numbered the French upon the conti∣nent.
The court of Versailles practised every stratage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to elude the vigilance of the English cruisers. The ship<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
destined for America they detached, both single and i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
convoys, sometimes from the Mediterranean, sometime
from their harbours in the Channel. They assembled
transports in one port, in order to withdraw the attention
of their enemies from another, where their convoys lay
ready for sailing; and in boisterous weather, when the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
English could no longer block up their harbours, their
storeships came forth, and hazarded the voyage, for the
relief of their American settlements. Those that had the
good fortune to arrive on the coast of that continent were
obliged to have recourse to different expedients for escaping
the British squadrons stationed at Halifax, or cruising in
the bay of St. Laurence. They either ventured to navi∣gate
the river before it was clear of the ice, so early in the
spring, that the enemy had not yet quitted the harbour o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Nova-Scotia; or they waited on the coast of Newfound∣land
for such thick fogs as might screen them from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
notice of the English cruisers, in sailing up the gulf
or, lastly, they penetrated through the Straits of Belleisle
a dangerous passage, which, however, led them direct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
into the river St. Laurence, at a considerable distan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
above the station of the British squadron. Though th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
French navy was by this time so reduced, that it coul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
neither face the English at sea, nor furnish proper convoy
for commerce, her ministry nevertheless attempted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
alarm the subjects of Great-Britain with the project of a
invasion. Flat-bottomed boats were built, transpor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="363" REF="367"/>
collected, large ships of the line equipped, and troops
ordered to assemble on the coast for embarkation; but this
was no more than a feint to arouse the apprehension of the
English, disconcert the administration, prejudice the na∣tional
credit, and deter the government from sending forces
to keep alive the war in Germany. A much more effectual
method they took to distress the trade of England, by
laying up their useless ships of war, and encouraging the
equipment of stout privateers, which did considerable da∣mage
to the commerce of Great-Britain and Ireland, by
cruising in the seas of Europe and America. Some of them
lay close in the harbours of the Channel, fronting the coast
of England, and darted out occasionally on the trading
ships of this na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, as they received intelligence from
boats employed for that purpose. Some chose their station
in the North-Sea, where a great number of captures were
made upon the coast of Scotland; others cruised in the chops
of the Channel, and even to the westward of Ireland; but
the far greater number scoured the seas in the neighbourhood
of the Leeward Islands in the West-Indies, where they took
a prodigious number of British ships, sailing to and from the
sugar-colonies, and conveyed them to their own settle∣ments
in Martinique, Guadaloupe, or St. Domingo.</P>
<P>§ XLVII. With respect to the war that raged in Ger∣many,
the King of Denmark wisely pursued that course
which happily preserved him from being involved in those
troubles by which great part of Europe was agitated, and
terminated in that point of national advantage which a
king ought over to have in view for the benefit of his
people. By observing a scrupulous neutrality, he enhanced
his importance among his neighbours: he saw himself
courted by all the belligerent powers: he saved the blood
and treasure of his subjects: he received large subsidies,
in consideration of his forbearance; and enjoyed, unmo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested,
a much more considerable share of commerce than
he could expect to carry on, even in times of universal
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranquillity. He could not perceive that the protestant
religion had any thing to apprehend from the confederacy
<PB N="364" REF="368"/>
which was formed against the Prussian monarch; nor wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
he misled into all the expence, the perils, and disqniets <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

might be swayed by private inclination, he did not thin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it was a point of consequence to his kingdom whethe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

for granted that France, for her own sake, would pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vent
the ruin of that enterprising monarch; and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
house of Austria would not be so impolitick, and blind t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
its own interest, as to permit the Empress of Russia to mak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and retain conquests in the Empire: but, even if the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
powers should be weak enough to sacrifice all the maxim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of sound policy to caprice or resentment, he did not thin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
himself so deeply concerned in the event, as, for the distan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
prospect of what might possibly happen, to plunge headlon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Denmark, for the precarious defence of a distant territory▪
It was reserved for another nation to adopt the perniciou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

one twentieth part of that sum; a country with which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
had no natural connexion; but a common alliance arisin
from accident. The King of Denmark, though himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="365" REF="369"/>
a prince of the Empire, and possessed of dominions in
Germany, almost contiguous to the scenes of the present
war, did not yet think himself so nearly concerned in the
issue, as to declare himself either principal or auxiliary in
the quarrel: yet he took care to maintain his forces by
sea and land upon a respectable footing: and, by this con∣duct,
he provided not only for the security of his own
country, but over-awed the belligerent powers, who con∣sidered
him as a prince capable of making either scale pre∣ponderate,
just as he might choose to trim the balance.
Thus he preserved his wealth, commerce, and consequence
undiminished; and, instead of being harrassed as a party,
was honoured as an umpire.</P>
<P>§ XLVIII. The United Provinces, though as adverse
as his Danish Majesty to any participation in the war, did
not, however, so scrupulously observe the neutrality they
professed: at least, the traders of that republick, either
from an inordinate thirst of lucre, or a secret biass in favour
of the enemies of Great-Britain, assisted the French com∣merce
with all the appearance of the most flagrant par∣tiality.
We have, in the beginning of this year's trans∣actions,
observed, that a great number of their ships were
taken by the English cruisers, and condemned as legal
prizes, for having French property on board: that the
Dutch merchants, exasperated by their losses, exclaimed
against the English as pirates and robbers, petitioned the
States for redress in very high terms, and even loudly cla∣moured
for a war against Great-Britain. The charge of
violence and injustice which they brought against the En∣glish,
for taking and confiscating the ships that transported
to Europe the produce of the French islands in the West-Indies,
they founded on the tenth article of the treaty of
commerce between Great-Britain and the States-General
of the United Provinces, concluded in the year one thou∣sand
six hundred and sixty-eight, stipulating, “That
whatever shall be found on board the ships of the subjects
of the United Provinces, though the lading, or part thereof,
may belong to the enemies of Great-Britain, shall be free
<PB N="366" REF="370"/>
and unmolested; except these be prohibited goods
which are to be served in the manner prescribed by the
foregoing articles.” From this article the Dutch mer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chants
argued, that, if there be no prohibited goods or
board, the English had no right to stop or molest any o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their ships, or make the least enquiry to whom the mer∣chandise
belonged, whence it was brought, or whither
bound. This plea the English casuists would by no mean<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
admit, for the following reasons: A general and perpe∣tual
license to carry on the whole trade of their enemy
would be such a glaring absurdity, as no convention could
authorise: common sense has dictated, and Grotius de∣clared,
that no man can be supposed to have consented to
an absurdity; therefore, the interpretation given by the
Dutch to this article could not be supposed to be its true
and genuine meaning; which, indeed, relates to nothing
more than the common course of trade, as it was usually
carried on in time of peace. But, even should this in¦terpretation
be accepted, the article, and the treaty itsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would be superseded and annulled by a subsequent treaty
concluded between the two nations in the year one thou¦sand
six hundred and seventy-five, and often confirmed
since that period, stipulating, in a secret article, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
neither of the contracting parties should give, nor con¦sent
that any of their subjects and inhabitants should give
any aid, favour, or council, directly or indirectly, by
land or sea, or on the fresh waters; nor should furnish
or permit the subjects or inhabitants of their respectiv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
territories to furnish, any ships, soldiers, seamen, victuals
monies, instruments of war, gunpowder, or any othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
necessaries for making war, to the enemies of either party
of any rank or condition soever. Now, the Dutch hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
infringed this article in many instances during the prese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
war, both in Europe and America; and, as they have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
openly contravened one treaty, the English are n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
obliged to observe any other. They, moreover, forfeited:
right to the observance of the treaty in question, by r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦fusing
the succours with which they were bound, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="367" REF="371"/>
most solemn manner, to furnish the King of Great-Bri∣tain,
in case any of his territories in Europe should be
attacked: for nothing could be more weak and frivolous
than the allegation upon which this refusal was founded;
namely, that the hostilities in Europe were commenced
by the English, when they seised and confiscated the vessels
of France; and they, being the aggressors, had no right
to insist upon the succours stipulated in a treaty which
was purely defensive. If this argument has any weight,
the treaty itself can have no signification. The French,
as in the present case, will always commence the war in
America; and when their ships, containing re-enforce∣ments
and stores for the maintenance of that war, shall be
taken on the European seas, perhaps in consequence of
their being exposed for that purpose, they will exclaim
that the English were the aggressors in Europe, conse∣quently
deprived of all benefit accruing from the defensive
treaty subsisting between them and the States-General of
the United Provinces. It being impossible for the English
to terminate the war, while their enemies derive the sinews
of it from their commerce carried on in neutral bottoms,
they are obliged to suppress such collusions, by that ne∣cessity
which Grotius himself hath allowed to be a suffi∣cient
excuse for deviating from the letter of any treaty what∣soever.
In time of peace no Dutch ships were permitted
to carry the produce of any French sugar island, or even
to trade in any of the French ports in America or the
West-Indies; consequently, the treaty which they quote
can never justify them in carrying on a commerce, which,
as it did not exist, and was not foreseen, could not possibly
be guarded against when that convention was ratified.
Grotius, whose authority is held in such veneration among
the Dutch, has determined that every nation has a right
to seise and confiscate the goods of any neutral power,
which shall attempt to carry them into any place which is
blocked up by that nation, either by land or sea. The
French islands in the West-Indies were so blocked
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p by the English cruisers, that they could receive no
<PB N="368" REF="372"/>
relief from their own government, consequently no neu∣tral
power could attempt to supply them without falling
under this predicament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the reign of King William, when the English and Dutch were engaged in a war against France, the northern powers of Sweden and Denmark at∣tempted to carry on the French commerce, under the shade of neutrality: but the Dutch and English joined in seising the vessels that were thus employ∣ed. Complaints of these captures were made at London and the Hague, and the complainants were given to understand at both places, that they should not be allowed to carry on any trade with France, but what was usual in time of peace. In consequence of this declaration, Mr. Groning formed the design of writing a treatise on the freedom of navigation, and communicated the plan of his work to the celebrated Pussendorf, who signified his sentiments in a let∣ter, which is preserved by the learned Barbeyrac, in his notes upon that au∣thor's treatise on the law of nature and nations.</NOTE>. It was for these reasons that the
King of England declared, by the mouth of Mr. Yorke,
his minister plenipotentiary at the Hague, in a conference
held in the month of August with the deputies of the States-General,
that though he was ready to concur in every
measure that should be proposed for giving satisfaction to
their High Mightinesses, with whom he had always studied
to live in the most perfect union, he was nevertheless de∣termined
not to suffer the trade of the French colonies in
America to be carried on by the subjects of other powers,
under the specious pretext of neutrality: nor to permit
words to be interpreted as a license to drive a trade with
his enemies, which, though not particularly specified in
the articles of contraband, was nevertheless rendered such
in all respects, and in every sense, by the nature of the cir∣cumstances. It is not all the more surprising that the
Dutch merchants should complain, than that the English
government should persist in confiscating the ships that
were found to contain the merchandise of their enemies.
The individual traders of every mercantile nation will run
considerable risques in extending their particular commerce,
even when they know it must be detrimental to the gene∣ral
interest of their country. In the war maintained by
the confederates against Louis XIV. of France, the mer∣chants
ships of the Dutch carried on an uninterrupted trade
to the French ports; and, notwithstanding the repeated
<PB N="369" REF="373"/>
sollicitations of England, the States-General could never
be prevailed upon to prohibit this commerce, which un∣doubtedly
enabled France to protract the war. The truth
is, they gave the British ministry to understand, that unless
they connived at this traffick, their subjects could not
possibly defray their proportion of the expense at which the
war was maintained. It is well known through all Eu∣rope,
that the subjects of the United Provinces reaped
considerable advantage, not only from this branch of
illicit trade, but also by providing for both armies in
Flanders, and by the practice of stock-jobbing in Eng∣land;
consequently, it was not the interest, either of the
States-General, or the English general, between whom
there was a very good understanding, to bring that war
to a speedy conclusion; not, indeed, ought we to fix the
imputation of partiality upon a whole nation, for the pri∣vate
conduct of individuals, influenced by motives of self-interest,
which operate with the same energy in Holland,
and among the subjects of Great-Britain. In the course
of the former war, such a scandalous appetite for gain pre∣vailed
in different parts of the British dominions, that the
French islands were actually supplied with provisions,
slaves, and lumber from Ireland and the British colonies
in North America; and Martinique, in particular, must
have surrendered to the commander of the English squa∣dron
stationed in those seas, had it not been thus supported
by English subjects. Certain it is, the Dutch had some
reason to complain that they were decoyed into this species
of traffick by the article of a treaty, which, in their opi∣nion,
admitted of no limitation; and that the govern∣ment
of Great-Britain, without any previous warning
or explaining its sentiments on this subject, swept the sea
at once of all the vessels employed in this commerce, and
condemned them, without mitigation, to the entire ruin
of many thousand families. Considering the intimate
connexion of mutual interest subsisting between Great-Britain
and the States of the United Provinces, they seem
to have had some right to an intimation of this nature,
<PB N="370" REF="374"/>
which, in all probability, would have induced them to
resign all prospect of advantage from the prosecution of
such a traffick.</P>
<P>§ XLIX. Besides the universal clamour excited in Hol∣land,
and the famous memorial presented to the States-General,
which we have already mentioned in another
place, a deputation of merchants waited four times
successively on the Princess Regent, to explain their grie∣vances,
and demand her concurrence in augmenting the
navy for the preservation of their commerce. She pro∣mised
to interpose her best offices with the court of Great-Britain;
and these co-operating with representations made
by the States-General, the English minister was empow∣ered
to open conferences at the Hague, in order to bring
all matters in dispute to an amicable accommodation.
These endeavours, however, proved ineffectual. The
British cruisers continued to take, and the British courts
to condemn, all Dutch vessels containing the produce of
the French sugar islands. The merchants of Holland and
Zealand renewed their complaints with redoubled cla∣mour,
and all the trading part of the nation, re-enforced
by the whole party that opposed the House of Orange,
cried aloud for an immediate augmentation of the marine,
and reprisals upon the pirates of England. The Princess,
in order to avoid extremities, was obliged not only to em∣ploy
all her personal influence with the States-General, but
also to play off one faction against another, in the way of
remonstrance and exclamation. As far back as the month
of June, she presented a memorial to the States-General,
reminding them, that in the beginning of the war between
France and England she had advised an augmentation
should be made in their land forces, to strengthen the gar∣risons
of the frontier towns, and cover the territories of the
republick from invasion. She gave them to undestand,
that the provinces of Gueldres and Overyssel, intimidated
by the proximity of two formidable armies, had resolved to
demand that the augmentation of their land-forces should
be taken into consideration by the other provinces; and
<PB N="371" REF="375"/>
requested her to re-enforce their sollicitations that this
measure might immediately take place. This request, she
said, she the more readily granted, as she could not but be
sensible of the imminent danger that threatened the re∣publick,
especially since the Hanoverian army had passed
the Rhine; and as it behoved the state to put itself in a
condition to hinder either army from retiring into the ter∣ritories
of the republick, if it should be defeated; for, in
that case, the conqueror being authorised to pursue his
enemy wherever he can find him, would bring the war into
the hear of their country. This representation had no
other effect than that of suspending the measure which
each party proposed. The Princess, in her answer to the
fourth deputation of the merchants, declared that she
beheld the present state of their trade with the most anxious
concern; that its want of protection was not her fault,
but that of the towns of Dort, Haerlem, Amsterdam, Tor∣gau,
Rotterdam, and the Brille, to whose conduct it was
owing, that the forces of the state, by sea and land, were
not now on a better footing. The deputies were after∣wards
referred to her minister, M. de la Larrey, to whom
they represented, that the augmentation of the land-forces,
and the equipment of a fleet, were matters as distinct from
each other as light from darkness: that there was no
pressing motive for an augmentation of the army, whereas,
innumerable reasonable reasons rendered the equipment of
a fleet a matter of the most urgent necessity. In a few
days after this representation was made, the Princess, in
an assembly of the States-General, requested their High
Mightinesses, that seeing their earnest and repeated efforts
to induce the provinces of Holland, Zealand, Friesland,
and West-Friesland to acquiesce in the proposed augmen∣tation
of forces by sea and land had not hitherto met with
success, they would now consider and deliberate upon some
expedient for terminating this affair, and the sooner the
better, in order, on one hand, to satisfy the strong and well-grounded
instances made by the provinces of Gueldres,
Utrecht, Overyssel, and Groningen; and, on the other,
<PB N="372" REF="376"/>
to comply with the ardent just desires expressed by the
commercial inhabitants of the country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1758.</NOTE> She told them
that the deputation which waited on her consisted of forty
merchants, a number that merited attention no less than
the speech they pronounced, of which a great number of
printed copies were distributed through all parts of the
country. Without making any particular remarks on
the harangue, she only observed, that the drift of it did
not tend to facilitate the negociation begun with Great-Britain,
nor to induce the nation to prefer a convention
to a rupture with that crown. From this circumstance
she inferred, it was more than time to finish the delibe∣rations
on the proposal for augmenting the forces both
by sea and land; a measure, without which she was con∣vinced
in her conscience the state was, and would always
remain exposed to all sorts of misfortune and danger,
both now and hereafter.</P>
<P>§ L. In consequence of this interposition, the States-General
that same day sent a letter to the states of Holland
and West-Friesland, communicating the sentiments of the
Princess Regent, and insisting upon the necessity of com∣plying
with her proposal of the double augmentation.
They observed, that an augmentation of the land-forces,
for the defence of the frontiers, was unavoidable, as well
as an equipment by sea for the security of commerce: that
the states of the provinces of Gueldres, Utrecht, Overyssel,
and Groningen joined with them in the same opinion;
and accordingly had insisted, by divers letters and pro∣positions,
on those two points so essential to the publick
interest. They represented the danger of delay, and the
fatal effects of discord: they proposed, that by a reciprocal
indulgence one party should comply with the sentiments
of the other, in order to avoid a schism and dangerous di∣vision
among the confederates, the consequences of which
would be very deplorable; while the republick, in the
mean time, would remain in a defenceless condition, both
by sea and land, and depend upon the arbitrary power of
its neighbours. They conjured them, therefore, as they
<PB N="373" REF="377"/>
valued the safety of their country, and all that was dear
to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X. 1758.</NOTE> as they regarded the protection of the good in∣habitants,
the concord and harmony which at all times,
but especially at the present critical juncture, was of the
last necessity, that they would seriously reflect upon the ex∣hortation
of her royal highness, as well as on the repeated
instances of the majority of the confederates; and take a
wise and salutary resolution with regard to the proposed
augmentation of the land-forces, so that this addition,
together with an equipment at sea, might, the sooner the
better, be unanimously brought to a conclusion. It was
undoubtedly the duty of all who wished well to their
country to moderate the heat and precipitation of those,
who, provoked by their losses, and stimulated by resent∣ment,
end eavoured at this period to involve their nation in
a war with Great-Britain. Had matters been pushed to
this extremity, in a few months the republick would, in
all probability, have been brought to the brink of ruin.
The Dutch were distracted by internal divisions; they were
altogether unprovided for hostilities by sea; the ocean was
covered with their trading vessels; and the naval arma∣ments
of Great-Britain were so numerous and powerful as
to render all resistance on that element equally vain and
pernicious. The English could not only have scoured
the seas, and made prize of all their shipping, but were
also in a condition to reduce or demolish all their towns
in Zealand, where they would hardly have met with
any opposition.</P>

<P>§ I. WHILE the operations of the war were prose∣cuted
through the four quarters of the globe,
the island of Great-Britain, which may be termed the
centre that gave motion to this vast machine, enjoyed all
the tranquillity of the most profound peace, and saw no∣thing
of war but the preparations and trophies, which
served only to animate the nation to a desire of further
conquest; for the dejection occasioned by the misfortune at
St. Cas soon vanished before the prospect of victory and
success. Considering the agitation naturally produced
among the common people by the practice of pressing men
into the service of the navy, which in the beginning of the
year had been carried on with unusual violence, the levy
of so many new corps of soldiers, and the endeavours used
in forming the national militia, very few disturbances hap∣pened
to interrupt the internal repose of the nation. From
private acts of malice, fraud, violence, and rapine no com∣munity
whatsoever is exempted. In the month of April,
the temporary wooden-bridge over the Thames, built for
the conveniency of carriages and passengers, while the
workmen should be employed in widening and repairing
London-Bridge, was maliciously set on fire in the night,
and continued burning till noon next day, when the ruins
of it fell into the river. The destruction of this conve∣niency
proved very detrimental to the commerce of the
city, notwithstanding the vigilancy and discretion of the
<PB N="376" REF="380"/>
magistrates, in applying remedies for this misfortune. A
promise of the King's pardon was offered in a publick ad∣vertisement,
by the secretary of state, and a reward of two
hundred pounds by the city of London to any person who
should discover the perpetrator of such wicked outrage;
but nevertheless he escaped detection. No individual,
nor any society of men, could have the least interest in the
execution of such a scheme, except the body of London
watermen; but as no discovery was made to the prejudice
of any person belonging to that society, the deed was im∣puted
to the malice of some secret enemy to the publick.
Even after a new temporary bridge was erected, another
attempt was made (in all probability by the same incen∣diary)
to reduce the whole to ashes, but happily miscarried,
and a guard was appointed, to prevent any such atrocious
efforts in the sequel. Dangerous tumults were raised in
and about Manchester, by a prodigious number of manu∣facturers,
who had left off working, and entered into a
combination to raise, by force, the price of their labour.
They had formed a regular plan, and collecting large sums
for the maintenance of the poorer sort, while they refused
to work for their families. They insulted and abused all
those who would not join in this defection; dispersed
incendiary letters, and denounced terrible threats against
all such as should presume to oppose their proceedings.
But these menaces had no effect upon the magistrates and
justices, who did their duty with such discretion and cou∣rage,
that the ringleaders being singled out, and punish∣ed
by law, the rest were soon reduced to order.</P>
<P>§ II. In the month of June, Florence Hensey, an ob∣scure
physician, and native of Ireland, who had been ap∣prehended
for treasonable practices, was tried in the court
of King's-Bench, on an indictment for high treason. In
the course of the trial it appeared that he had been em∣ployed
as a spy for the French ministry; to which, in
consideration of a paltry pension, he sent intelligence of
every material occurrence in Great-Britain. The cor∣respondence
was managed by his brother, a Jesuit, who
<PB N="377" REF="381"/>
acted as chaplain and secretary to the Spanish ambassadour
at the Hague. The British resident at that court having
learned from the Spanish minister some secrets relating to
England, even before they were communicated to him
from the English ministry, was induced to set on foot an
enquiry touching the source of this information, and soon
received an assurance, that the secretary of the Spanish
ambassadour had a brother, a physician, in London. The
suspicion naturally arising from this circumstance being
imparted to the ministry of England, Hensey was nar∣rowly
watched, and twenty-nine of his letters were inter∣cepted.
From the contents of these he was convicted of
having given the French court the first notice of the expe∣dition
to North-America, the capture of the two ships,
the Alcide and Lys, the sailing and destination of every
squadron and armament, and the difficulties that occurred
in raising money for the service of the publick. He had
even informed them that the secret expedition of the fore∣going
year was intended against Rochefort, and advised a
descent upon Great-Britain, at a certain time and place,
as the most effectual method of distressing the govern∣ment,
and affecting the publick credit. After a long
trial he was found guilty of treason, and received the sen∣tence
of death usually pronounced on such occasions: but
whether he earned forgiveness by some material discovery,
or the minister found him so insensible and insignificant
that he was ashamed to take his life, he escaped execution,
and was pardoned, on condition of going into perpetual
exile. The severity of the governmont was much about
the same period exercised on Dr. Shebbeare, a publick
writer, who, in a series of printed letters to the people of
England, had animadverted on the conduct of the ministry
in the most acrimonious terms, stigmatised some great
names with all the virulence of censure, and even assaulted
the throne itself with oblique insinuation and ironical
satire. The ministry, incensed at the boldness, and still
more enraged at the success of this author, whose writings
were bought with avidity by the publick, determined to
<PB N="378" REF="382"/>
punish him severely for his arrogance and abuse, and he
was apprehended by a warrant from the secretary's office.
His sixth letter to the people of England was pitched upon
as the foundation of a prosecution. After a short trial in
the court of King's-Bench, he was found guilty of having
written the sixth letter to the people of England, adjudged
a libellous pamphlet, sentenced to stand in the pillory, to
pay a small fine, to be imprisoned three years, and give
security for his future good behaviour: so that, in effect, this
good man suffered more for having given vent to the un∣guarded
effusions of mistaken zeal, couched in the language
of passion and scurrility, than was inflicted upon Hensey,
a convicted traitor, who had acted as a spy for France,
and betrayed his own country for hire.</P>
<P>§ III. Amidst a variety of crimes and disorders, arising
from impetuosity of temper, unreined passion, luxury, ex∣travagance,
and an almost total want of police and subor∣dination,
the virtues of benevolence are always springing
up to an extraordinary growth in the British soil; and here
charities are often established by the humanity of indivi∣duals,
which in any other country would be honoured as
national institutions: witness the great number of hos∣pitals
and infimaries in London and Westminster, erected
and maintained by voluntary contributions, or raised by
the princely donations of private founders. In the course
of this year the publick began to enjoy the benefit of se∣veral
admirable institutions. Mr. Henry Raine, a private
gentleman of Middlesex, had, in his life-time, built an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
endowed an hospital for the maintenance of forty poo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
maidens. By his will he bequeathed a certain sum of mo-ney
to accumulate at interest, under the management o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
trustees, until the yearly produce should amount to two
hundred and ten pounds, to be given in marriage-portion
to two of the maidens educated in his hospital, at the ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of twenty-two, who should be the best recommended so
piety and industry by the masters or mistresses whom the
had served. In the month of March, the sum destined so
this laudable purpose was completed; when the trustees
<PB N="379" REF="383"/>
by publick advertisement, summoned the maidens educated
in the hospital to appear on a certain day, with proper cer∣tificates
of their behaviour and circumstances, that six of
the most deserving might be selected to draw lots for the
prize of one hundred pounds, to be paid as her marriage
portion, provided she married a man of an unblemished
character, a member of the church of England, residing
within certain specified parishes, and approved by the
trustees. Accordingly, on the first of May the candidates
appeared, and the prize being gained by one young wo∣man,
in presence of a numerous assembly of all ranks,
attracted by curiosity, the other five maidens, with a sixth,
added in lieu of her who had been successful, were marked
for a second chance on the same day of the following year,
when a second prize of the same value would be presented:
thus a new candidate will be added every year, that every
maiden who has been educated in this hospital, and pre∣served
her character without reproach, may have a chance
for the noble donation, which is also accompanied with the
sum of five pounds to defray the expense of the wedding
entertainment. One scarce knows whether most to ad∣mire
the plan, or commend the humanity of this excellent
institution. Of equal and perhaps superior merit was
another charitable establishment, which also took effect
about this period. A small number of humane indivi∣duals,
chiefly citizens of London, deeply affected with the
situation of common prostitutes, who are certainly the
most forlorn of all human creatures, formed a generous
resolution in their favour, such as even the best men of the
kingdom had never before the courage to avow. They
considered that many of these unhappy creatures, so
wretched in themselves, and so productive of mischief to
society, had been seduced to vice in their tender years by
the perfidious artifice of the other sex, or the violence of
unruly passion, before they had acquired experience to
guard against the one, or foresight to perceive the fatal
consequences of the other: that the jewel, reputation,
being thus irretrievably lost, perhaps in one unguarded
<PB N="380" REF="384"/>
moment, they were covered with shame and disgrace,
abandoned by their families, excluded from all pity, re∣gard,
and assistance: that, stung by self-conviction, in∣sulted
with reproach, denied the privilege of penitence
and contrition, cut off from all hope, impelled by indi∣gence,
and maddened with despair, they had plunged into
a life of infamy, in which they were exposed to deplorable
vicissitudes of misery, and the most excruciating pangs of
reflexion that any human being could sustain: that, what∣ever
remorse they might feel, howsoever they might detest
their own vice, or long for an opportunity of amendment,
they were entirely destitute of all means of reformation:
they were not only deprived of all possibility of profiting
by those precious moments of repentance, and becoming
again useful members of society; but, in order to earn a
miserable subsistence, were obliged to persevere in the paths
of prostitution, and act as the instruments of heaven's ven∣geance
in propagating distemper and profligacy, in ruining
the bodies and debauching the minds of their fellow-crea∣tures.
Moved to sympathy and compassion by these con∣siderations,
this virtuous bad of associates determined to
provide a comfortable asylum for female penitents, to
which they might fly for shelter from the receptacles of
vice, the miseries of life, and the scorn of mankind; where
they might indulge the salutary sentiments of remorse,
make their peace with heaven, accustom themselves to in∣dustry
and temperance, and be profitably reunited to so∣ciety,
from which they had been so unhappily dissevered.
The plan of this excellent institution being formed, was
put in execution by means of voluntary subscription, and
the house opened in Goodman's-sields, under the name of
the Magdalen-hospital, in the month of August; when
fifty petitions were presented by penitent prostitutes, solli∣citing
admittance. Another asylum was also opened by
the hand of private charity, on the Surrey-side of Westmin∣ster-bridge,
for the reception and education of female
orphans, and children abandoned by their parents.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="385"/>
§ IV. Nor was encouragement refused to those who
distinguished themselves by extraordinary talents in any
branch of the liberal and useful arts and sciences, though
no Maecenas appeared among the ministers, and not the
least ray of patronage glimmered from the throne. The
protection, countenance, and gratification secured in other
countries by the institution of academies, and the liberalities
of princes, the ingenious in England derived from the
generosity of a publick, endued with taste and sensibility,
eager for improvement, and proud of patronizing extra∣ordinary
merit. Several years had already elapsed
since a society of private persons was instituted at London,
for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and com∣merce.
It consisted of a president, vice-president, secre∣tary,
register, collector, and other officers, elected from a
very considerable number of members, who pay a certain
yearly contribution for the purposes of the institution. In
the course of every year they held eight general meetings
in a large assembly-room, built and furnished at the com∣mon
expense; besides the ordinary meetings of the society,
held every week, from the second Wednesday in Novem∣ber
to the last Wednesday in May; and, in the interme∣diate
time, on the first and third Wednesday of every
month. At these ordinary meetings, provided the num∣ber
then present exceeded ten, the members had a right to
proceed on business, and power to appoint such committees
as they should think necessary. The money contributed
by this association, after the necessary expence of the so∣ciety
had been deducted, was expended in premiums for
planting and husbandry; for discoveries and improvements
in chemistry, dying, and mineralogy; for promoting the
ingenious arts of drawing, engraving, casting, painting,
statuary, and sculpture; for the improvement of manu∣factures
and machines in the various articles of hats,
crapes, druggets, mills, marbled-paper, ship-blocks, spin∣ning-wheels,
toys, yarn, knitting, and weaving. They
likewise allotted sums for the advantage of the British colo∣nies
in America, and bestowed premiums on those settlers
<PB N="382" REF="386"/>
who should excel in curing cochineal, planting logwood-trees,
cultivating olive-trees, producing myrtle-wax,

moreover, allowed a gold medal, in honour of him who

an historical account of the progressive improve∣ments

on the morals and manners of the people, and
pointing out the most proper means for their future ad∣vancement.
In a word, the society is so numerous, the
contributions so considerable, the plan so judiciously laid,
and executed with such discretion and spirit, as to promise
much more effectual and extensive advantage to the publick
than ever accrued from all the boasted academies of
Christendom. The artists of London had long maintain∣ed
a private academy for improvement in the art of draw∣ing
from living figures; but, in order to extend this ad∣vantage,
which was not attained without difficulty and
expense, the Duke of Richmond, a young nobleman of the
most amiable character, provided a large apartment at
Whitehall, for the use of those who studied the arts of
painting, sculpture, and engraving; and furnished it with
a collection of original plaister casts from the best antique
statues and busts at Rome and Florence. Here any learner
had liberty to draw, or make models, under the eye and
instructions of two eminent artists; and twice a year the
munificent founder bestowed premiums of silver medals on
the four pupils who excelled the rest in drawing from a
certain figure, and making the best model of it in basso∣relievo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Among other transactions that distinguish the history of Great-Britain, scarce a year glides away without producing some incident that strongly mark the singular character of the English nation.

<P>You will apprehend that I mean you should be alone, and depend upon that a discovery of any artifice in this affair will be fatal to you. My safety insured by my silence, for confession only can condemn me.”</P>
<P>The duke, in compliance with this strange remonstrance, ap∣peared at the time and place appointed, on horseback and alone, with pistole <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore him, and the star of his order displayed, that he might be the more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sily known. He had likewise taken the precaution of engaging a friend to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tend in the Park, at such a distance, however, as scarce to be observable. He continued some time on the spot without seeing any person he could suspect of having wrote the letter, and then rode away; but chancing to tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his head when he reached Hyde-Park corner, he perceived a man standing at the bridge, and looking at the water, within twenty yards of the tree which was described in the letter. He forthwith rode back at a gentle pace, and passing by the person expected to be addressed, but as no advance of this kind was made, he, in repassing, bowed to the stranger, and asked if he had not some∣thing to communicate. The man replying, “No, I don't know you;” the Duke told him his name, adding, “Now you know me, I imagine you have something to say to me.” But he still answered in the negative, and the Duke rode home. In a day or two after this transaction another letter was brought to him, couched in the following terms:</P>

<P>“YOU receive this as an acknowledgement of your punctuality as to the time and place of meeting on Sunday last, though it was owing to you it an∣swered no purpose. The pageantry of being armed, and the ensign of your order, were useless, and too conspicuous. You needed no attendant, the place was not calculated for mischief, nor was any intended. If you walk in the west aisle of Westminster-Abbey, towards eleven o'clock on Sun∣day next, your sagacity will point out the person whom you will address, by asking his company to take a turn or two with you. You will not fail, on enquiry, to be acquainted with the name and place of abode. According to which direction you will please to send two or three hundred pounds bank∣notes the next day by the penny-post. Exert not your curiosity too early; it is in your power to make me grateful on certain terms. I have friends who are faithful, but they do not bark before they bite.”</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The duke, determined, if possible, to unveil this mystery, repaired to the Ab∣bey at the time prescribed, and, after having walked up and down for five or six minutes, saw the very same person to whom he had spoke in Hyde-Park enter the Abbey, with another man of a creditable appearance This last, after they had viewed some of the monuments, went into the choir, and the other turn∣ing back, advanced towards the duke, who accosting him, asked if he had any thing to say to him, or any commands for him? He replied, “No, my lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have not.”—“Sure you have,” said the duke, but he persisted in his denial. Then the duke leaving him, took several turns in the aisse, while the stranger walked on the other side. But nothing further passed between them, and although the duke had provided several persons in disguise to apprehend the delinquent, he forbore giving the signal, that, notwithstanding appearances, he might run no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isque of injuring an innocent person. Not long after this second disappointment he received a third letter, to the following effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM fully convinced you had a companion on Sunday: I interpret it as owing to the weakness of human nature, but such proceeding is far from being ingenuous, and may produce bad effects, whilst it is impossible to answer the end proposed. You will see me again soon, as it were by accident, and may easily find where I go to; in consequence of which, by being sent to, I shall wait on your grace, but expect to be quite alone, and to converse in whispers a you will likewise give your honour, upon meeting, that no part of the con∣versation shall transpire. These and the former terms complied with ensure your safety: my revenge, in case of non-compliance (or any scheme to ex∣pose me) will be flower, but not the less sure; and strong suspicion the ut∣most that can possibly ensue upon it, while the chances would be tenfold against you. You will possibly be in doubt after the meeting, but it is quite necessary the outside should be a mask to the in. The family of the Bloods is not ex∣tinct, though they are not in my scheme.”</P>
<P>The expression, “you will see me again soon, as it were by accident,” plainly pointed at the person to whom he had spoke in the Park, and in the Abbey; nevertheless, he saw him not again, nor did he hear any thing further of the affair for two months, at the expiration of which the post brought him the following letter:</P>
<P>“May it please your Grace,</P>
<P>“I Have reason to believe that the son of one Barnard, a surveyor, in Abingdon-buildings, Westminster, is acquainted with some secrets that nearly concern your safety: his father is now out of town, which will give you an opportunity of questioning him more privately: it would be useless to your grace, as well as dangerous to me, to appear more publickly in this affair.</P>

<SIGNED>ANONYMOUS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<Q>He frequently goes to Storey's-Gate coffee-house.”</Q>
<P>In about a week after this intimation was received, the Duke sent a person <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the coffee-house, to enquire for Mr. Barnard, and tell him he would be glad to speak to him. The message was delivered, and Bernard declared he would wait upon his grace next Thursday, at half an hour after ten in the morning. He was punctual to his appointment, and no sooner appeared than the Duke recog∣nised him to be the person to whom he had spoke in the Park and the Abbey. Having conducted him into an apartment, and shut the door, he asked, as before, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f he had any thing to communicate; and was answered, as formerly, in he negative. Then the Duke repeated every circumstance of this strange trans∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction; to which Barnard listened with attention and surprise, yet without exhi∣biting any marks of conscious guilt or confusion. The Duke observing that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was matter of astonishment to see letters of such import written with the cor∣rectness of a scholar, the other replied, that a man might be very poor and very earned at the same time. When he saw the fourth letter, in which his name was mentioned, with the circumstance of his father's absence, he said, “It <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very odd, my father was then out of town.” An expression the more re∣markable, as the letter was without date, and he could not, as an innocent man, be supposed to know at what time it was written. The Duke having made him acquainted with the particulars, told him, that if he was innocent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ought to use his endeavours to detect the writer of the letters, especially of the last, in which he was expressly named. To this admonition he returned no other answer but a smile, and then withdrew. He was afterwards taken into custody, and tried at the Old-Bailey, for sending a threatening letter, con∣trary to the statute; but no evidence could be found to prove the letters were of his hand writing; nor did any presumption appear against him, except his being in Hyde-Park, and in Westminster-Abbey, at the time and place ap∣pointed in the two first letters. On the other hand, Mr. Barnard proved, that on the Sunday, when he saw the Duke in Hyde-Park, he was on his way to Kensington, on particular business, by his father's order, signified to him that very morning: that he accordingly went thither, and dined with his uncle, in company with several other persons, to whom he related what had passed between the Duke of Marlborough and him in the Park: that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being afterwards in Westminster-Abbey was the effect of mere accident<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Mr. James Green wood, his kinsman, who had lain the preceding night at his father's house, desired him to dress himself, that they might walk to∣gether in the Park; and he did not comply with his request till after much sollicitation: that he proposed to enter the Park without passing through the Abbey, but was prevailed upon by Mr. Greenwood, who expressed a desire of seeing the newly-erected monument of General Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>grave: that as he had formerly communicated to his friend the strange circumstance of the Duke's speaking to him in Hyde-Park, Mr. Greenwood no sooner saw that nobleman in the Abbey, than he gave notice to Mr. Bernard, who was very short-sight∣ed: and that, from his passing them several times, concluding he wanted to speak with Mr. Barnard alone, he quitted him, and retired into the choir, that they might commune together without interruption. It likewise app<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed from undoubted evidence, that Barnard had often mentioned openly, to his friends and acquaintance, the circumstances of what passed between him and the Duke in the Park and in the Abbey: that his father was a man of un∣blemished reputation, and in affluent circumstances: that he himself was never reduced to any want, or such exigence as might impel him to any despe∣rate methods of obtaining money: that his fidelity had been often tried, an his life always irreproachable. For these reasons he was acquitted of the crime laid to his charge, and the mystery remains to this day undiscovered.</P>
<P>After all, the author of the letters does not seem to have had any real des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g to extort money, because the scheme was very ill calculated for that purpose and, indeed, could not possibly take effect, without the most imminent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of detection. Perhaps his aim was nothing more than to gratify a petulan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and peculiarity of humour, by alarming the Duke, exciting the curiosity of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> publick, puzzling the multitude, and giving rise to a thousand ridiculous co∣jectures. If any thing more was intended, and the Duke earnestly desired know the extent of the scheme, he might, when he closeted the person <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣pected, have encouraged him to a declaration, by promising inviolable sec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on his word and honour, in which any man would have confided as a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obligation. On the whole, it is surprising that the death of the Duke, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> happened in the course of this year, was never attributed to the secret p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tices of this incendiary correspondent, who had given him to understand, that his vengeance, though slow, would not be the less certain.</P></NOTE>.</P>

§ V. On the twenty-third day of November both
Houses of parliament met at Westminster, when his
<PB N="384" REF="388"/>
Majesty being indisposed, the session was opened by com∣mission,
and the Lord-keeper harangued them to this
<PB N="385" REF="389"/>
effect. He told them, his Majesty had directed the lords
of the commission to assure his parliament that he always
<PB N="386" REF="390"/>
received the highest satisfaction in being able to lay before
them any events that might promote the honour and in∣terest
<PB N="387" REF="391"/>
of his kingdoms: that, in consequence of their ad∣vice,
and enabled by the assistance which they unanimously
gave, his Majesty had exerted his endeavours to carry on
the war in the most vigorous manner, in order to attain
that desireable end, always to be wished, a safe and honour∣able
peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the month of August, the King, in quality of Elector of Hanover, having occasion for two hundred thousand pounds, a loan by subscription for that sum was opened at the Bank, and filled immediately by seven or eight money-dealers of London.</NOTE>: that it had pleased the Divine Providence to
bless his measures and arms with success in several parts,
and to make the enemies of the nation feel that the strength
of Great-Britain is not to be provoked with impunity:
that the conquest of the strong fortress of Louisbourg,
with the islands of Cape-Breton and St. John; the demo∣lition
of Frontenac, of the highest importance to his
operations in America, and the reduction of Senegal,
could not fail to bring great distres on the French com∣merce
and colonies, and, in proportion, to procure great
advantage to those of Great-Britain. He observed, that
France had also been made sensible, that whilst her forces
are sent forth to invade and ravage the dominions of her
neighbours, her own coasts are not inaccessible to his Ma∣jesty's
fleets and armies: a truth which she had expe∣rienced
in the demolition of the works at Cherbourg,
erected at a great expence, with a particular view to an∣noy
England, as well as in the loss of a great number of
ships and vessels; but no treatment, however injurious
to his Majesty, could tempt him to make retaliation on
the innocent subjects of that crown. He told them,
that in Germany his Majesty's good brother, the King of
Prussia, and Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, had found
full employment for the armies of France and her con∣federates,
from which the English operations, both by sea
and in America, had derived the most evident advantage;
their successes, owing, under God, to their able conduct,
and the bravery of his Majesty's troops, and those of his
<PB N="388" REF="392"/>
allies, having been signal and glorious. The King,
moreover, commanded them to declare, that the common
cause of liberty and independency was still making noble
and glorious efforts against the unnatural union formed to
oppress it: that the commerce of his subjects, the source
of national riches, had, by the vigilant protection received
from his Majesty's fleet, flourished in a manner not to be
paralleled during such troubles. In this state of things,
he said, the King, in his wisdom, thought it unnecessary
to use many words to persuade them to bear up against
all difficulties, effectually to stand by and defend his Ma∣jesty,
vigorously to support the King of Prussia, and the
rest of his Majesty's allies, and to exert themselves to
reduce their enemies to equitable terms of accommodation.
He observed to the House of Commons, that the uncom∣mon
extent of this war, in different parts, occasioned it to
be uncommonly expensive: that the King had ordered
them to declare to the Commons, that he sincerely la∣mented,
and deeply felt for the burthens of his people: that
the several estimates were ordered to be laid before them;
and that he desired only such supplies as should be requi∣site
to push the war with advantage, and be adequate to the
necessary services. In the last place, he assured them the
King took so much satisfaction in that good harmony
which subsisted among his faithful subjects, that it was
more proper for him now to thank them for it, than to
repeat his exhortation to it: that this union, necessary at
all times, was more especially so in such critical con∣junctures;
and his Majesty doubted not but the good
effects the nation had found from it would be the strongest
motives to them to pursue it.—The reader, will, no doubt,
be surprised to find this harangue abound with harshness of
period and inelegancy of expression: he will wonder that,
in particularising the successes of the year in America, no
mention is made of the reduction of Fort Du Quesne on
the river Ohio; a place of great importance, both from
its strength and situation, the erection of which had been
one great motive to the war between the two nations: but
<PB N="389" REF="393"/>
he will be still more surprised to hear it declared from the
throne, that the operations, both by sea and in America,
had derived the most evident advantage from the war in
Germany. An assertion the more extraordinary, as the
British ministry, in their answer to the Parallel, which we
have already mentioned, had expressly affirmed, that “none
but such as are unacquainted with the maritime force of
England can believe, that without a diversion on the
continent, to employ part of the enemy's force, she is not
in a condition to hope for success, and maintain her su∣periority
at sea.—That they must be very ignorant, indeed,
who imagine that the forces of England are not able to
resist those of France, unless the latter be hindered from
turning all her efforts to the sea.” It is very remarkable,
that the British ministry should declare that the war in
Germany was favourable to the English operations by sea
and in America; and almost in the same breath accuse
the French King of having fomented that war. Let us
suppose that France had no war to maintain in Europe;
and ask in what manner she, in that case, would have op∣posed
the progress of the British arms by sea, and in Ame∣rica?
Her navy was reduced to such a condition that it
durst not quit her harbours; her merchant-ships were all
taken, her mariners confined in England, and the sea was
covered with British cruisers: in these circumstances,
what expedients could she have contrived for sending sup∣plies
and re-enforcements to America, or for opposing the
naval armaments of Great-Britain in any other part of the
world?—None. Without ships and mariners, her troops,
ammunition, and stores were, in this respect, as useless as
money to a man ship-wrecked on a desolate island. But,
granting that the war in Germany had, in some measure,
diverted the attention of the French ministry from the
prosecution of their operations in America (and this is
granting more than ought to be allowed) the question is
not, whether the hostilities upon the continent of Europe
prevented France from sending a great number of troops
to Canada; but whether the war in Germany was either
<PB N="390" REF="394"/>
necessary or expedient for distressing the French more ef∣fectually
in other parts of the world? Surely every intelli∣gent
man of candour must answer in the negative. The
expense incurred by England for subsidies and armies in
the Empire exceeded three millions sterling annually;
and this enormous expense, without being able to protect
Hanover, only served to keep the war alive in different
parts of Germany. Had one half of this sum been em∣ployed
in augmenting and extending the naval armaments
of Great-Britain, and in re-enforcing her troops in Ame∣rica
and the West-Indies, France would have been, at this
day, deprived of all her sugar colonies, as well as of her
settlements on the continent of America; and being ab∣solutely
cut off from these sources of wealth, would have
found it impracticable either to gratify her subsidiaries, or
to maintain such formidable armies to annoy her neigh∣bours.
These are truths, which will appear to the con∣viction
of the publick, when the illusive spells of unsub∣stantial
victory are dissolved, and time shall have dispersed
the thick mists of prejudice, which now seem to darken
and perplex the understanding of the people.</P>
<P>§ VI. The conduct of the administration was so agree∣able
to both Houses of parliament, that in their address to
the throne they expressed their unshaken zeal and loyalty
to his Majesty's person, congratulated him on the success
of his arms, and promised to support his measures and
allies with steadiness and alacrity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the charge of disaffection to the king's person, which was so loudly trumpeted by former ministers and their adherents against all those who had honesty and courage to oppose the measures of a weak and corrupt administra∣tion, was entirely false, and without foundation, appeared at this juncture when in the midst of a cruel, oppressive, and continental war, maintaine by the blood and treasure of Great-Britain, all opposition ceased in both House of parliament. The addresses of thanks to his Majesty, which are alway<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dictated by the immediate servants of the crown, were unanimously adopte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in both Houses, and not only couched in terms of applause, but even inflate with expressions of rapture and admiration. They declared themselves sensibl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the operations of Great-Britain, both by sea and in America, had re∣ceived the most evident and important advantages from the maintenance the war in Germany, and seemed eager to espouse any measure that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gratify the inclinations of the sovereign.</NOTE>. It was probably in
<PB N="391" REF="395"/>
consequence of this assurance that a new treaty between
Great-Britain and Prussia was concluded at London on
the seventh day of December, importing, That as the
burthensome war in which the King of Prussia is engaged
lays him under the necessity of making fresh efforts to de∣fend
himself against the multitude of enemies who attack
his dominions, he is obliged to take new measures with the
King of England, for their reciprocal defence and safety;
and his Britannick Majesty hath, at the same time, signi∣fied
his earnest desire to strengthen the friendship subsisting
between the two courts, and, in consequence thereof, to
conclude a formal convention, for granting to his Prussian
Majesty speedy and powerful assistance, their Majesties
have nominated and authorised their ministers to concert
and settle the following articles:—All formal treaties be∣tween
the two crowns, particularly that signed at West∣minster
on the 16th day of January, in the year 1756,
and the convention of the 11th of April, in the year
1758, are confirmed by the present convention of the
11th of April, in the year 1758, in their whole tenor,
as if they were herein inserted word for word. The
King of Great-Britain shall cause to be paid at Lon∣don,
to such person or persons as shall be authorised by
the King of Prussia for that end, the sum of four millions
of rix-dollars, making six hundred and seventy thousand
pounds sterling, at one payment, immediately on the ex∣change
of the ratifications, if the King of Prussia shall
so require. His Prussian Majesty shall employ the said
sum in supporting and augmenting his forces, which shall
act in such manner as shall be of the greatest service to the
common cause, and contribute most to the mutual de∣fence
and safety of their said Majesties. The King of
Great-Britain, both as king and elector, and the King of
Prussia, reciprocally bind themselves not to conclude
with the powers that have taken part in the present war
any treaty of peace, truce, or other such like convention,
but by common advice and consent, each expressly in∣cluding
therein the other. The ratification of the present
convention shall be exchanged within six weeks, or sooner,
<PB N="392" REF="396"/>
if possible. In effect, this treaty was no other than a
renewal of the subsidy from year to year, because it was
not thought proper to stipulate in the first subsidiary con∣vention
an annual supply of such importance until the
war should be terminated, left the people of England
should be alarmed at the prospect of such successive bur∣thens,
and the complaisance of the Commons be in some
future session exhausted. On the whole, this was per∣haps
the most extraordinary treaty that ever was con∣cluded;
for it contains no specification of articles, except
the payment of the subsidy: every other article was left
to the interpretation of his Prussian Majesty.</P>
<P>§ VII. The parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> having performed the ceremony
of addresses to the throne, immediately proceeded to the
great work of the supply. The two committees in the
House of Commons were immediately established, and
continued by adjournments to the month of May, by the
twenty-third day of which all their resolutions were taken.
They voted sixty thousand men, including fourteen thou∣sand
eight hundred and forty-five marines, for the service
of the ensuing year; and for the operations by land, a
body of troops amounting to fifty-two thousand five hun∣dred
and fifty-three effective men, besides the auxiliaries
of Hanover, Hesse, Brunswick, Saxe-Gotha, and Bucke∣bourg,
to the number of fifty thousand, and five battalions
on the Irish establishment, in actual service in America
and Africa. For the maintenance of the sixty thousand
men employed in the sea-service, they granted three millions
one hundred and twenty thousand pounds; for the land∣forces,
one million two hundred fifty-six thousand one
hundred and thirty pounds, fifteen shillings, and two-pence;
for the charge of the additional five battalions, forty
thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine pounds, thirteen
shillings, and nine-pence; for the pay of the general and
staff-officers, and hospitals of the land-forces, fifty-two
thousand four hundred and eighty-four pounds, one shil∣ling,
and eight pence; for maintaining the garrisons in
the plantations, Gibraltar, Nova-Scotia, Newfoundland,
Providence, Cape-Breton, and Senegal, the sum of seven
<PB N="393" REF="397"/>
hundred and forty-two thousand five hundred and thirty-one
pounds, five shillings, and seven pence; for the
charge of ordnance for land service, two hundred and twenty
thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine pounds, eleven
shillings, and nine pence; for extraordinary service per∣formed
by the same office, and not provided for by parlia∣ment
in the course of the preceding year, three hundred
twenty-three thousand nine hundred and eighty-seven
pounds, thirteen shillings, and three pence; for the ordi∣nary
of the navy, including half-pay to sea officers, two
hundred and thirty-eight thousand four hundred and
ninety-one pounds, nine shillings, and eight pence; to∣wards
the support of Greenwich-hospital, and for the out∣pensioners
of Chelsea-college, the sum of thirty-six thou∣sand
pounds. They allotted for one year's expense in∣curred
by the foreign troops in the pay of Great-Britain,
one million two hundred thirty-eight thousand one hun∣dred
and seventy-seven pounds, nineteen shillings, and
ten pence, over and above sixty thousand pounds for en∣abling
his Majesty to fulfil his engagements with the Land∣grave
of Hesse-Cassel, pursuant to the separate article of
a new treaty concluded between them in the month of
January of this current year, stipulating that this sum
should be paid to his serene highness, in order to facilitate
the means by which he might again six his residence in
his own dominions, and by his presence give fresh courage
to his faithful subjects. Eighty thousand pounds were
granted for enabling his Majesty to discharge the like sum,
raised in pursuance of an act passed in the preceding session,
and charged upon the first aids or supplies to be granted
in this session of parliament. The sum of two hundred
thousand pounds was voted towards the building and re∣pairing
ships of war for the ensuing year. Fifteen thou∣sand
pounds were allowed for improving London-bridge;
and forty thousand on account for the Foundling-hospital.
For the charge of transports to be employed in the course
of the year they assigned six hundred sixty-seven thou∣sand
seven hundred and twenty-one pounds, nineteen
<PB N="394" REF="398"/>
shillings, and seven pence: for maintaining the colonies
of Nova-Scotia and Georgia they bestowed twenty-five
thousand two hundred and thirty-eight pounds, thirteen
shillings, and five pence. To replace sums taken from
the sinking fund, thirty-three thousand two hundred and
fifty-two pounds, eighteen shillings, and ten pence half-penny;
for maintaining the British forts and settlements
on the coast of Africa, ten thousand pounds; and for
paying off the mortgage on an estate devised for the en∣dowment
of a professorship in the university of Cambridge,
the sum of twelve hundred and eighty pounds. For the
expense of the militia they voted ninety thousand pounds:
for extraordinary expenses relating to the land-forces, in∣curred
in the course of last year, and unprovided for by
parliament, the sum of four hundred sixty-six thousand
seven hundred and eighty-five pounds, ten shillings, and
five-pence three farthings. For the purchase of certain
lands and hereditaments, in order to secure the King's
docks at Portsmouth, Chatham, and Plymouth, they
granted thirty-six thousand nine hundred and sixty-six
pounds, two shillings, and ten pence. They voted two
hundred thousand pounds for enabling his Majesty to give
proper compensations to the respective provinces in North-America
for the expenses they had incurred in levying
and maintaining troops for the service of the publick.
They granted twenty thousand pounds to the East-India
company, towards enabling them to defray the expense
of a military force in their settlements; and the same sum
was granted for carrying on the fortifications to secure the
harbour of Milford. To make good several sums issued by his
Majesty, for indemnifying the innholders and victuallers o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Hampshire for the expenses they had incurred in quartering
the Hessian auxiliaries in England; for an addition to the sa∣laries
of judges, and other less considerable purposes, they al∣lowed
the sum of twenty-six thousand one hundred and se∣venty-eight
pounds, sixteen shillings, and six pence. Finally
they voted one million, upon account, for enabling the King
to defray any extra ordinary expense of the war, incurred, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="395" REF="399"/>
to be incurred, for the service of the current year; and to
take all such measures as might be necessary to disappoint
or defeat any enterprises or designs of his enemies, as the
exigency of affairs should require. The sum of all the
grants voted by the committee of supply amounted to
twelve millions seven hundred sixty-one thousand three
hundred and ten pounds, nineteen shillings, and five-pence.</P>
<P>§ VIII. The Commons were still employed in delibera∣tions
on ways and means on the twenty-second day of
May, when Mr. Secretary Pitt communicated to them a
message from the King, couched in these terms: “His
Majesty, relying on the experienced zeal and affection of
his faithful Commons, and considering that, in this cri∣tical
conjuncture, emergencies may arise, which may be
of the utmost importance, and be attended with the most
pernicious consequences, if proper means should not im∣mediately
be applied to prevent or defeat them, is desi∣rous
that this House will enable him to defray any extra∣ordinary
expenses of the war, incurred, or to be incurred,
for the service of the year one thousand seven hundred
and fifty-nine, and to take all such measures as may be ne∣cessary
to disappoint or defeat any enterprises or designs of
his enemies, and as the exigencies of affairs may require.”
This message being read, a motion was made, and agreed
to <HI>nem. con.</HI> that it should be referred to the committee,
who forth with formed upon it the resolution, whereby one
million was granted, to be raised by loans or Exchequer∣bills,
chargeable on the first aids that should be given in
the next session. This produced a bill enabling his Ma∣jesty
to raise the sum of one million, for the uses and pur∣poses
therein mentioned, comprehending a clause, allow∣ing
the Bank of England to advance, on the credit of the
loan therein mentioned, any sum not exceeding a million,
notwithstanding the act of the fifth and sixth years in the reign
of William and Mary, by which the Bank was established.</P>
<P>§ IX. The bills relating solely to the supply being dis∣cussed
and expedited, the House proceeded as usual to enact
other laws for the advantage of the community. Petitions
<PB N="396" REF="400"/>
having been presented by the cities of Bristol and New-Sarum,
alledging, that since the laws prohibiting the
making of low wines and spirits from grain, meal, and
flour had been in force, the commonalty appeared more
sober, healthy, and industrious; representing the ill con∣sequences
which they apprehended would attend the re∣peal
of these laws, and therefore praying their continu∣ance;
a committee of the whole House resolved that the
prohibition to export corn should be continued to the
twenty-fourth day of December, in the year one thousand
seven hundred and fifty-nine; subject neverless to such
provisions for shortening the said term of its continuance
as should therefore be made by any act of that session, or
by his Majesty, with the advice of his privy-council, during
the recess of parliament; that the act for discontinuing
the duties upon corn and flour imported, or brought in as
prize, was not proper to be further continued; and that
the prohibition to make low wines or spirits from any sort
of grain, meal, or flour should be continued to the twenty-fourth
day of December, in the year one thousand seven
hundred and fifty-nine. Before the bill was formed on
these resolutions, petitions arrived from Liverpool and
Bath, to the same purport as those of Bristol and Sa∣rum;
while, on the other hand, a remonstrance was
presented by a great number of the malt-distillers of the
city and suburbs of London, alledging, that it having been
deemed expedient to prohibit the distilling of spirits from
any sort of grain to the twenty-fourth day of December
then instant, some of the petitioners had entirely ceased
to carry on the business of distilling, while others, merely
with a view to preserve their customers, the compound,
distillers, and employ some of their servants, horses, and
utensils, had submitted to carry on the distillation of spirits
from melasses and sugars under great disadvantages, in
full hope that the said restraint would cease at the expira∣tion
of the limited time, or at least when the necessity which
occasioned that restraint should be removed; that it was
with great concern they observed a bill would be brought
<PB N="397" REF="401"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for protracting the said prohibition, at a time when the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rice of all manner of grain, and particularly of wheat and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arley, was considerably reduced, and, as they humbly
conceived, at a reasonable medium. They expatiated on
the great loss they, as well as many traders and artificers
dependents upon them, must sustain, in case the said bill
should be passed into a law. They prayed the House to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake these circumstances into consideration, and either
permit them to carry on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he distillation from wheat, malt,
and other grain, under such restrictions as should be
judged necessary; or to grant them such other relief, in
respect of their several losses and incumbrances, as to the
House should seem reasonable and expedient. This peti∣tion,
though strenuously urged by a powerful and clamo∣rous
body without doors, did not meet with great encou∣ragement
within. It was ordered to lie upon the table,
and an instruction was given to the committee, empower∣ing
them to receive a clause or clauses to allow the trans∣portation
of certain quantities of meal, flour, bread, and
biscuit to the islands of Guernsey and Jersey, for the sole
use of the inhabitants; and another to prohibit the mak∣ing
of low wines and spirits from bran. Much more at∣tention
was paid to a petition of several farmers in the
county of Norfolk, representing, that their farms consisted
chiefly of arable land, which produced much greater
quantities of corn than could be consumed within that
county; that in the last harvest there was a great and plen∣tiful
crop of all sorts of grain, the greatest part of which
had, by unfavourable weather, been rendered unfit for sale
at London, or other markets, for home consumption;
that large quantities of malt were then lying at London,
arising chiefly from the crops of barley growing in the
year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven, the sale
of which was stagnated; that the petitioners being in∣formed
the House had ordered in a bill to continue the
prohibition of corn exported, they begged leave to observe,
that, should it pass into a law, it would be extremely pre∣judicial
to all, and ruin many farmers of that county, as
<PB N="398" REF="402"/>
they had offered their corn for sale at divers ports and
markets of the said county; but the merchants refused to
buy it at any price, alledging its being unfit for the Lon∣don
market, the great quantity of corn with which that
market was already overstocked, and their not being al∣lowed
either to export it, or make it into malt for expor∣tation:
they, therefore, prayed this prohibition might be
removed, or they the petitioners indulged with some other
kind of relief. Although this remonstrance was duely
considered, the bill passed with the amendments, because
of the proviso, by which his Majesty in council was em∣powered
to shorten the date of the prohibition, with re∣spect
to the exportation of corn during the recess of par∣liament:
but the temporary restraint laid upon distillation
was made absolute, without any such condition, to the no
small disappointment and mortification of the distillers, who
had spared no pains or expense, by private sollicitation and
strenuous dispute in the publick papers, to recommend
their cause to the favour of the community. They urged,
that malt spirits, when used in moderation, far from being
prejudicial to the health of individuals, were in many damp
and marshy parts of the kingdom absolutely necessary for
preserving the field-labourers from agues, and other di∣stempers
produced by the cold and moisture of the cli∣mate;
that if they were debarred the use of malt-spirits
they would have recourse to French brandy, with which,
as they generally resided near the sea coast, the smugglers
would provide them almost as cheap as the malt-spirits,
could be afforded; thus the increased consumption of
French spirit would drain the nation of ready money to a
considerable amount, and prejudice the King's revenue in
the same proportion. They observed, that many distillers
had already quitted that branch of trade, and disposed of
their materials; that all of them would probably take the
same resolution, should the bill pass into a law, as no man
could forsee when the prohibition would cease, should it
be continued at a time when all sorts of grain abounded
in such plenty: that the very waste of materials by disuse,
<PB N="399" REF="403"/>
over and above the lying out of the money, would be of great
prejudice to the proprietor: thus the business of distilling,
by which so many families were supported, would be ba∣nished
from the kingdom entirely: especially, as the ex∣pense
of establishing a large distillery was so great, that
no man would choose to employ his money for this pur∣pose,
judging from experience, that some future accidental
scarcity of corn might induce the legislature to interpose
a ruinous delay in this branch of business. They affirmed,
that, from the excessive use of malt-spirits, no good argu∣ment
could be drawn against this branch of traffick, no
more than against any other conveniency of life: that
the excessive use of common beer or ale was prejudicial to
the health and morals of the people, yet no person ever
thought of putting an end to the practice of brewing, in
order to prevent the abuse of brewedliquors. They urged,
that in all parts of Great-Britain there are some parcels
of land that produce nothing to advantage, but a coarse
kind of barley, called big, which, though neither fit for
brewing or for baking, may nevertheless be used in the
distillery, and is accordingly purchased by those concerned
in this branch at such an encouraging price as enables
many farmers to pay a higher rent to their landlords than
they could otherwise afford: that there are every year
some parcels of all sorts of grain so damaged by un∣seasonable
weather, or other accidents, as to be
rendered altogether unfit for bread or brewery, and
would prove a very great misfortune to the farmer,
if there was no distillery, for the use of which
he could sell his damaged commodity. They asserted,
that malt-spirits were absolutely necessary for prose∣cuting
some branches of foreign commerce, particu∣larly
the trade to the coast of Africa, for which traffick
no assortment could be made up without a large quantity
of geneva, of which the natives are so fond, that they will
not traffick with any merchant who has not a considerable
quantity, not only for sale, but also for presents to their
chiefs and rulers: that the merchants of Great-Britain
<PB N="400" REF="404"/>
must either have this commodity of their own produce,
or import it at a great national expense from Holland:
that the charge of this importation, together with the
duties payable upon it, some part of which is not to be
drawn back on exportation, will render it impossible for
the traders to sell it so cheap on the coast of Africa as it
might be sold by the Dutch, who are the great rivals of
Great-Britain in this branch of commerce. To these ar∣guments,
all of which were plausible, and some of them
unanswerable, it was replied, that malt-spirits might
be considered as a fatal and bewitching poison, which had
actually debauched the minds and enervated the bodies
of the common people to a very deplorable degree; that,
without entering further into a comparison between the
use and abuse of the two liquors, beer and geneva, it
would be sufficient to observe, that the use of beer and ale
had produced none of those dreadful effects which were
the consequences of drinking geneva; and since the pro∣hibition
of the distillery of malt-spirits had taken place,
the common people were become apparently more sober,
decent, healthy, and industrious: a circumstance sufficient
to induce the legislature not only to intermit, but even
totally to abolish the practice of distillation, which has
ever been productive of such intoxication, riot, disorder,
and distemper, among the lower class of the people, as
might be deemed the greatest evils incident to a well regu∣lated
commonwealth. Their assertion with respect to the
coarse kind of barley, called big, was contradicted as a
deviation from truth, inasmuch as it was used in making
malt, as well as in making bread: and with respect to
damaged corn, those who understood the nature of grain
affirmed, that if it was spoiled to such a degree as to be
altogether unfit for either of these purposes, the distillers
would not purchase it at such a price as would indemnify
the farmer for the charge of threshing and carriage; for
the distillers are very sensible that their greatest profit is
derived from their distilling the malt made from the best
barley, so that the increase of the produce far exceeded
<PB N="401" REF="405"/>
in proportion the advance of the price. It was not, how∣ever,
an easy matter to prove that the distillation of malt-spirits
was not necessary to an advantageous prosecution of
the commerce on the coast of Guinea, as well as among the
Indians in some parts of North-America. Certain it is,
that in these branches of traffick the want of Geneva may
be supplied with spirits distilled from sugars and melasses.
After all, it must be owned, that the good and salutary
effects of the prohibition were visible in every part of the
kingdom, and no evil consequences ensued, except a di∣minution
of the revenue in this article: a consideration
which, at all times, ought to be sacrificed to the health
and morals of the people: nor will this consideration be
found of any great weight, when we reflect that the less
the malt-spirit is drunk, the greater quantity of beer and
ale will be consumed, and the produce of the duties and
excise upon the brewery be augmented accordingly.</P>
<P>§ X. In the mean time, all sorts of grain continuing
to fall in price, and great plenty appearing in every part of
the kingdom, the justices of the peace, and of the grand
juries assembled at the general quarter sessions of the peace
held for the county of Norfolk, composed and presented
to the House of Commons, in the beginning of February,
a petition, representing, that the weather proving unfa∣vourable
in the harvest, great part of the barley raised in
that county was much damaged, and rendered unfit for
any other use than that of being made into malt for
exportation; that, unless it should be speedily manu∣factured
for that purpose, it would be entirely spoiled, and
perish in the hands of the growers; a loss that must be
very sensibly felt by the land-owners: they, therefore, en∣treated
that leave might be given for the exportation of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>malt; and that they might be favoured with such further
relief, as to the House should seem just and reasonable.
In consequence of this petition, the House resolved itself
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto a committee, to deliberate upon the subject; and as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t appeared, upon examination, that the price of grain
was reduced very low, and great abundance diffused through
<PB N="402" REF="406"/>
the kingdom, they resolved, that the continuance of that
part of the act, prohibiting the exportation of grain,
ought to be abridged and shortened, and the exportation
of these commodities allowed, under proper regulations
with respect to the time of such exportation, and the
allowance of bounties thereupon. A bill being founded
on these resolutions, was discussed, and underwent several
amendments: at length, it was sent with a new title to
the Lords, who passed it without further alteration, and
then it obtained the royal sanction.</P>
<P>§ XI. While this affair was under the deliberation of
the committee, the Commons unanimously issued an order
for leave to bring in a bill to continue, for a limited time,
the act of last session, permitting the importation of salted
beef from Ireland into Great Britain, with an instruction
to receive a claue extending this permission to all sorts of
salted pork, or hog meat, as the officers of the custom-house
had refused to admit hams from Ireland to an entry.
The bill likewise received another considerable alteration,
importing, That, instead of the duty of one shilling and
three pence, charged by the former act on every hundred
weight of slated beef or pork imported from Ireland, which
was found not adequate to the duty payable for such a
quantity of salt as is requisite to be used in curing and
salting thereof; and to prevent as well the expense to the
revenue, as the detriment and loss which would accrue <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the owner and importer, from opening the casks in whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the provision is generally deposited, with the pickle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
brine proper for preserving the same, in order to ascert<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the net weight of the provision liable to the said duties—
for these reasons it was enacted, That from and after th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
twenty-fourth day of last December, and during the con∣tinuance
of this act, a duty of three shillings and four
pence should be paid upon importation for every barrel <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
cask of salted beef or pork containing thirty-two gallons
and one shilling and three-pence for every hundred weigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of salted beef, called dried beef, dried neats tongues, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="403" REF="407"/>
dried hog-meat, and so in proportion for any greater or
lesser quantity.</P>
<P>§ XII. Repeated complaints having been made to the
government by neutral nations, especially the Dutch, that
their ships had been plundered, and their crews maltreated,
by some of the English privateers, the legislature resolved
to provide effectually against any such outrageous practices
for the future: and with this view the Commons ordered a
bill to be brought in, for amending and explaining an act
of the twenty-ninth year of his late Majesty's reign, inti∣tuled,
“An act for the encouragement of seamen, and
more speedy and effectual manning of his Majesty's
navy.” While the committee was employed in pe∣rusing
commissions and papers relating to private ships of
war, that they might be fully acquainted with the nature
of the subject, a considerable number of merchants and
others, inhabiting the islands of Guernsey and Jersey, pre∣sented
a petition to the House, alledging, that the inha∣bitants
of those islands, which lie in the British channel,
within sight of the French coast, had now, as well as in
former wars, embarked their fortunes in equipping small
privateers, which used to run in close with the French
shore, and being disguised like fishing-boats, had not only
taken a considerable number of prizes, to the great an∣noyance
of the enemy, but also obtained material intelli∣gence
of their designs, on many important occasions;
that these services could not be performed by large vessels,
which durst not approach so near the coast, and indeed
could not appear without giving the alarm, which was
communicated from place to place by appointed signals.
Being informed that a bill was depending, in order to pro∣hibit
privateers of small burthen, they declared that such
a law, if extended to privateers equipped in those islands,
would ruin such as had invested their fortunes in small
privateers; and not only deprive the kingdom of the before∣mentioned
advantages, but expose Great-Britain to infinite
prejudice from the small armed vessels of France, which
the enemy in that case would pour abroad over the whole
<PB N="404" REF="408"/>
Channel, to the great annoyance of navigation and com∣merce.
They prayed, therefore, that such privateers as
belonged to the islands of Guernsey and Jersey might be
wholly excepted from the penalties contained in the bill,
or that they (the petitioners) might be heard by their
counsel, and be indulged with such relief as the House
should judge expedient. This representation being re∣ferred
to the consideration of the committee, produced
divers amendments to the bill, which, at length, obtained
the royal assent, and contained these regulations: That,
after the first day of January in the present year, no com∣mission
should be granted to a privateer in Europe under
the burthen of one hundred tons, the force of ten carriage
guns, being three-pounders or above, with forty men at
the least, unless the lords of the Admiralty, or persons au∣thorised
by them, should think fit to grant the same to
any ship of inferior force or burthen, the owners thereof
giving such bail or security as should be prescribed: that
the lords of the Admiralty might at any time revoke, by
an order in writing under their hands, any commission
granted to a privateer; this revocation being subject to an
appeal to his Majesty in council, whose determination
should be final: that, previous to the granting any com∣mission,
the persons proposing to be bound, and give se∣curity,
should severally make oath of their being respec∣tively
worth more money than the sum for which they
were then to be bound, over and above the payment of all
their just debts: that persons applying for such commissions
should make application in writing, and therein <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et forth
a particular and exact description of the vessel, specifying
the burthen, and the number and nature of the guns <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
board, to what place belonging, as well as the name <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
names of the principal owner or owners, and the numbe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of men: these particulars to be inserted in the commission
and every commander to produce such commission to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Custom-house officer who should examine the vessel, and
finding her answer the description, give a certificate there<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
gratis, to be deemed a necessary clearance, without whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="405" REF="409"/>
the commander should not depart: that if, after the first
day of June, any captain of a privateer should agree for
the ransom of any neutral vessel, or the cargo, or any part
thereof, after it should have been taken as prize, and in
pursuance of such agreement should actually discharge such
prize, he should be deemed guilty of piracy; but that
with respect to contraband merchandise, he might take it
on board his own ship, with the consent of the commander
of the neutral vessel, and then set her at liberty; and that
no person should purloin or embezzle the said merchandise
before condemnation: that no judge, or other person be∣longing
to any court of Admiralty, should be concerned
in any privateer: that owners of vessels, not being under
fifty, or above one hundred tons, whose commissions are
declared void, should be indemnified for their loss by the
publick: that a court of oyer and terminer, and jail deli∣very,
for the tryal of offences committed within the juris∣diction
of the Admiralty, should be held twice a-year in
the Old Bailey, at London, or in such other place within
England as the board of Admiralty should appoint: that
the judge of any court of Admiralty, after an appeal inter∣posed,
as well as before, should, at the request of the
captor or claimant, issue an order for appraising the cap∣ture,
when the parties do not agree upon the value, and
an inventory to be taken; then exact security for the full
value, and cause the capture to be delivered to the person
giving such security; but, should objection be made to the
taking such security, the judge should, at the request of
either party, order such merchandise to be entered, landed,
and sold at publick auction, and the produce be deposited
at the Bank, or in some publick securities; and in case of
security being given, the judge should grant a pass in fa∣vour
of the capture. Finally, the force of this act was
limited to the duration of the then war with France only.
This regulation very clearly demonstrated, that whatever
violences might have been committed on the ships of neu∣tral
nations, they were by no means countenanced by the
legislature, or the body of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="410"/>
§ XIII. Every circumstance relating to the information
of the marine must be an important object to a nation
whose wealth and power depend upon navigation and com∣merce:
but a consideration of equal weight was the esta∣blishment
of the militia, which, notwithstanding the re∣peated
endeavours of the parliament, was found still in∣complete,
and in want of further assistance from the legi∣slature.
His Majesty having, by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, recommended to the House the making suit∣able
provision for defraying the charges of the militia dur∣ing
the current year, the accounts of the expense already
incurred by this establishment were referred to the com∣mittee
of supply, who, after having duely perused them,
resolved, that ninety thousand pounds should be granted
on account, towards defraying the charges of pay and
clothing for the militia, from the last day of the last year
to the twenty-fifth day of March in the year one thousand
seven hundred and sixty, and for repaying a sum advanced
by the King for this service. Leave was given to bring
in one bill pursuant to this resolution, and another to en∣force
the execution of the laws relating to the militia, re∣move
certain difficulties, and prevent the inconvenien∣cies
by which it might be attended. So intent were the
majority on both sides upon this national measure, that they
not only carried both bills to the throne, where they re∣ceived
the royal assent; but they presented an address to
the King, desiring his Majesty would give directions to his
lieutenants of the several counties, ridings, and places in
England, to use their utmost diligence and attention for
carrying into execution the several acts of parliament re∣lating
to the militia. By this time all the individuals that
constituted the representatives of the people, except such as
actually served in the army, were become very well dis∣posed
towards this institution. Those who really wished
well to their country had always exerted themselves in its
favour: and it was now likewise espoused by those who
foresaw that the establishment of a national militia would
enable the administration to send the greater number of
<PB N="407" REF="411"/>
regular troops to fight the battles of Germany. Yet how
zealous soever the legislature might be in promoting this
institution, and notwithstanding the success with which
many patriots exerted their endeavours through different
parts of the kingdom in raising and disciplining the mili∣tia,
it was found not only difficult, but almost impractica∣ble
to execute the intention of the parliament in some par∣ticular
counties, where the gentlemen were indolent and
enervated, or in those places where they looked upon their
commander with contempt. Even Middlesex itself,
where the King resides, was one of the last counties in
which the militia could be arrayed. In allusion to this
backwardness, the preamble or first clause in one of the
present acts imported, that certain counties, ridings, and
places in England had made some progress in establishing
the militia, without completing the same, and that in
certain other counties little progress had been made therein,
his Majesty's lieutenants and the deputy lieutenants, and
all others within such counties or districts, were therefore
strictly required speedily and diligently to put these acts in
execution. The truth is, some of these unwarlike com∣manders
failed through ignorance and inactivity; others
gave or offered commissions to such people as threw a ridi∣cule
and contempt upon the whole establishment, and
consequently hindered many gentlemen of worth, spirit,
and capacity from engaging in the service. The mutiny-bill,
and that for the regulation of the marine-forces while
on shore, passed through the usual forms, as annual mea∣sures,
without any dispute or alteration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The next bill that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell under the cognizance of the House related to a law transaction, and was suggested by a petition presented in the name of the sheriffs, and grantees of post-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines under the crown of England. They enu∣merated and explained the difficulties under which they laboured, in raising and collecting these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines within the respective countries; particularly when the estate conveyed by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine was no more than a right of reversion, in which case they could not possibly levy the post-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, unless the purchaser should obtain possession within the term of the sheriffalty, or pay it of his own free will, as they could not distrain while the lands were in the possession of the do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e. They, therefore, proposed a method for raising these post-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines by a proper officer, to be appointed for that purpose; and prayed that leave might be given to bring in a bill accordingly. This petition was seconded by a message from the King, importing, that his Majesty, as far as his In∣terest was concerned, gave his consent that the House might act in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> affair as they should think proper.</P>
<P>The Commons, in a committee of the whole House, having taken into con∣sideration the merits of the petition, formed several resolutions; upon which a bill was founded for the more regular and easy collecting, accounting for, and paying of post-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines, which should be due to the crown, or to the grantees thereof under the crown, and for the case of sheriffs in respect to the same. Before it passed into a law, however, it was opposed by a petition in favour <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one William Daw, a lunatick, clerk of the King's silver office, alledging, that should the bill pass, it would deprive the said Daw and his successors of an ancient fee belonging to his office, on searches made for post-fines by the under-sheriffs of the several counties; therefore, praying that such provision might be made for the said lunatick as to the House should seem just and reasonable. This, and divers other petitions respecting the bill, being di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cussed in the committee, it underwent several amendments, and was enacted into a law; the particulars of which cannot be properly understood without a previous explanation of this method of conveying estates: a subject obscure in itself, founded upon a seeming subterfuge of law, scarce reconcileable with the dictates of common sense, and consequently improper for the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="412"/>
§ XIV. A committee having been appointed to enquire
what laws were expired, or near expiring, and to report
their opinion to the House touching the revival or conti∣nuation
of these laws, they agreed to several resolutions;
in consequence of which the following bills were brought
in, and enacted into laws; namely, an act for regulating
the lastage and ballastage of the river Thames; an act fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
continuing the law relating to the punishment of persons
going armed or disguised; an act for continuing several
laws near expiring; an act concerning the admeasure∣ment
of coals; and an act for the relief of debtors, with
respect to the imprisonment of their persons. This last
was almost totally metamorphosed by alterations, amend∣ments,
and additions, among which the most remarkable
were these: that where more creditors than one shall
charge any prisoner in execution, and desire to have him
detained in prison, they shall only respectively pay him
each such weekly sum, not exceeding one shilling and
six-pence per week, as the court, at the time of his being
remanded, shall direct: that if any prisoner, described by
<PB N="409" REF="413"/>
the act, shall remain in prison three months after being
committed, any creditor may compel him to give into
court, upon oath, an account of his real and personal
estate, to be disposed of for the benefit of his creditors,
they consenting to his being discharged. Why the hu∣manity
of this law was confined to those prisoners only
who are not charged in execution with any debt exceed∣ing
one hundred pounds cannot easily be conceived. A
man, who, through unavoidable misfortunes, hath sunk
from affluence to misery and indigence, is generally a
greater object of compassion than he who never knew the
delicacies of life, nor ever enjoyed credit sufficient to con∣tract
debts to any considerable amount: yet the latter
is by this law entitled to his discharge, or at least to a
maintenance in prison; while the former is left to starve
in gaol, or undergo perpetual imprisonment, amidst all the
horrors of misery, if he owes above one hundred pounds
to a revengeful and unrelenting creditor. Wherefore,
in a country, the people of which justly pique themselves
upon charity and benevolence, an unhappy fellow-citizen,
reduced to a state of bankruptcy by unforseen losses in trade,
should be subjected to a punishment, which, of all others,
must be the most grievous to a free-born Briton, namely,
the entire loss of liberty; a punishment which the most
flagrant crime can hardly deserve, in a nation that disclaims
the torture; for, doubtless, perpetual imprisonment must
be a torture infinitely more severe than death, because
protracted through a series of years spent in misery and
despair, without one glimmering ray of hope, without the
most distant prospect of deliverance? Wherefore the legi∣slature
should extend its humanity to those only who are
the least sensible of the benefit, because the most able to
struggle under misfortune; and wherefore many valua∣ble
individuals should, for no guilt of their own, be not
only ruined to themselves, but lost to the community?
are questions which we cannot resolve to the satisfaction
of the reader. Of all imprisoned debtors, those who are
consined for large sums may be deemed the most wretched
<PB N="410" REF="414"/>
and forlorn, because they have generally fallen from a
sphere of life where they had little acquaintance with
necessity, and were altogether ignorant of the arts by which
the severities of indigence are alleviated. On the other
hand, those of the lower class of mankind, whose debts
are small in proportion to the narrowness of their former
credit, have not the same delicate feelings of calamity.
They are inured to hardship, and accustomed to the la∣bour
of their hands, by which, even in a prison, they can
earn a subsistence. Their reverse of fortune is not so
great, nor the transition so affecting. Their sensations are
not delicate; nor are they, like their betters in mi∣sfortune,
cut off from hope, which is the wretch's last com∣fort.
It is the man of sentiment and sensibility who, in
this situation, is overwhelmed with a complication of mise∣ry
and ineffable distress. The mortification of his pride,
his ambition blasted, his family undone, himself deprived
of liberty, reduced from opulence to extreme want, from
the elegancies of life to the most squalid and frightful
scenes of poverty and affliction; divested of comfort,
destitute of hope, and doomed to linger out a wretched
being in the midst of insult, violence, riot, and uproar:
these are reflections so replete with horror, as to render
him, in all respects, the most miserable object on the face
of the earth. He, alas! though possessed of talents that
might have essentially served, and even adorned society,
while thus restrained in prison, and affected in mind, can
exert no faculty, nor stoop to any condescension, by
which the horrors of his fate might be assuaged. He
scorns to execute the lowest offices of menial services, par∣ticularly
in attending those who are the objects of con∣tempt
or abhorrence: he is incapable of exercising any
mechanick art, which might afford a happy though a
scanty independence. Shrunk within his dismal cell,
surrounded by haggard poverty, and her gaunt attend∣ants,
hollow-eyed famine, shivering cold, and wan dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase,
he wildly casts his eyes around: he sees the tender
partner of his heart weeping in silent woe: he hears his
<PB N="411" REF="415"/>
helpless babes clamorous for sustenance; he feels himself
the importunate cravings of human nature, which he
cannot satisfy; and groans with all the complicated pangs
of internal anguish, horrour, and despair. These are not
the fictions of idle fancy, but real pictures, drawn from
nature, of which almost every prison in England will af∣ford
but too many originals.</P>
<P>§ XV. Among other new measures, a successful at∣tempt
was made in favour of Ireland, by a bill, permitting
the free importation of cattle from that kingdom for a
limited time. This, however, was not carried through
both Houses without considerable opposition, arising from
the particular interest of certain counties and districts in
several parts of Great-Britain, from whence petitions
against the bill were transmitted to the Commons. Divers
artifices were also used within doors to saddle the bill with
such clauses as might overcharge the scheme, and render
it odious or alarming to the publick: but the promoters
of it being aware of the design, conducted it in such a
manner as to frustrate all their views, and convey it safely
to the throne, where it was enacted into a law. The like
success attended another effort in behalf of our fellow-subjects
of Ireland. The bill for the importation of Irish
cattle was no sooner ordered to be brought in, than the
House proceeded to take into consideration the duties then
payable on the importation of tallow from the same king∣dom,
and several witnesses being examined, the committee
agreed to a resolution that these duties should cease and
determine for a limited time. A bill being formed ac∣cordingly,
passed through both Houses without opposition;
though in the preceding session a bill to the same purpose
had miscarried among the peers: a miscarriage probably
owing to their being unacquainted with the sentiments of
his Majesty, as some of the duties upon tallow constituted
part of one of the branches appropriated for the civil list
revenue. This objection, however, was obviated in the
case of the present bill, by the King's message to the House
of Commons, signifying his Majesty's consent, as far as
<PB N="412" REF="416"/>
his interest was concerned in the affair. By this new act
the free importation of Irish tallow was permitted for
the term of five years.</P>
<P>§ XVI. In the month of February the Commons pre∣sented
an address to his Majesty, requesting that he would
give directions for laying before the House an account
of what had been done, since the beginning of last year,
towards securing the harbour of Milford, in pursuance of
any directions from his Majesty. These accounts being
perused, and the King having, by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, exhorted them to make provision for fortifying
the said harbour, a bill was brought in, to explain, amend,
and render more effectual, the act of the last session relating
to this subject and, passing through both Houses, received
the royal assent without opposition. By this act several
engineers were added to the commissioners formerly ap∣pointed;
and it was ordained that fortifications should be
erected at Peter-church-point, Westlanyon-point, and
Neyland-point, as being the most proper and best situated
places for fortifying the interior parts of the harbour. It
was also enacted that the commissioners should appoint
proper secretaries, clerks, assistants, and other officers, for
carrying the two acts into execution; and that an account
of the application of the money should be laid before
parliament, within twenty days of the opening of every
session. What next attracted the attention of the House
was an affair of the utmost importance to the commerce
of the kingdom, which equally affected the interest of the
nation, and the character of the natives. In the latter end
of February complaint was made to the House, that, since
the commencement of the war, an infamous traffick had
been set on foot by some merchants of London, of import∣ing
French cloths into several ports of the Levant, on
account of British Subjects. Five persons were sum∣moned
to attend the House, and the fact was fully proved,
not only by their evidence, but also by some papers sub∣mitted
to the House by the Turkey company. A bill was
immediately contrived for putting a stop to this scandalous
<PB N="413" REF="417"/>
practice, reciting in the preamble, that such traffick was
not only a manifest discouragement and prejudice to the
woolen manufactures of Great-Britain, but also a relief
to the enemy, in consequence of which they were enabled
to maintain the war against these kingdoms.</P>
<P>§ XVII. The next object that employed the attention
of the Commons was to explain and amend a law made
in the last session for granting to his Majesty several rates
and duties upon offices and pensions. The directions
specified in the former act for levying this imposition hav∣ing
been found inconvenient in many respects, new regula∣tions
were now established, importing that those de∣ductions
should be paid into the hands of receivers ap∣pointed
by the King for that purpose; that all sums de∣ducted
under this act should be accounted for to such re∣ceivers,
and the accounts audited and passed by them, and
not by the auditors of the imprests, or of the Exchequer;
that all disputes relating to the collection of this duty should
be finally, and in a summary way, determined by the
barons of the Exchequer in England and Scotland re∣spectively;
that the commissioners of the land-tax should
six and ascertain the sum total or amount of the perquisites
of every office and employment within their respective
districts, distinct from the salary thereunto belonging,
to be deducted under the said act, independently of any
former valuation or assessment of the same to the land-tax;
and should rate or assess all offices and employment, the per∣quisites
whereof should be found to exceed the sum of
one hundred pounds per annum, at one shilling for every
twenty thence arising; that the receivers should transmit
to the commissioners in every district where any office or
employment is to be assessed, an account of such offices and
employments, that upon being certified of the truth of
their amount they might be rated and assessed accordingly;
that in all future assessments of the land-tax the said offices
and employments should not be valued at higher rates than
those at which they were assessed towards the land-tax of
the thirty-first year of the present reign; that the word
<PB N="414" REF="418"/>
perquisite should be understood to mean such profits of
offices and employments as arise from sees established by
custom or authority, and payable either by the crown or
the subjects, in consideration of business done in the
course of executing such offices and employments; and
that a commissioner possessed of any office or employment
might not interfere in the execution of the said act, ex∣cept
in what might relate to his own employment. By the
four last clauses several salaries were exempted from the
payment of this duty. The objections made without
doors to this new law were the accession of pecuniary in∣fluence
to the crown, by the creation of a new office and
officers, whereas this duty might have been easily collected
and received by the commissioners of the land-tax already
appointed, and the inconsistency that appeared between
the fifth and seventh clauses: in the former of these, the
commissioners of the land-tax were vested with the power
of assessing the perquisites of every office within their re∣spective
districts, independent of any former valuation or
assessment of the same to the land-tax; and by the latter,
they are restricted from assessing any office at a higher rate
than that of the thirty-first year of the reign of George II.</P>
<P>§ XVIII. In the beginning of March petitions were
offered to the House by the merchants of Birmingham, in
Warwickshire, and Sheffield, in Yorkshire, specifying that
the toy trade of these and many other towns consisted ge∣nerally
of articles in which gold and silver might be said
to be manufactured, though in small proportion, inasmuch
as the sale of them depended upon slight ornaments of
gold and silver: that by a clause passed in the last session
of parliament, obliging every person who should sell goods
or wares in which any gold or silver was manufactured
to take out an annual license of forty shillings, they the
petitioners were laid under great difficulties and disadvan∣tages:
that not only the first seller, but every person
through whose hands the goods or wares passed to the con∣sumer,
was required to take out the said license; they,
therefore, requested that the House would take these
<PB N="415" REF="419"/>
hardships and inequalities into consideration, and indulge
them with reasonable relief. The committee, to which
this affair was referred having resolved that this impo∣sition
was found detrimental to the toy and cutlery trade
of the kingdom, the House agreed to the resolution, and a
bill being prepared, under the title of “An act to amend
the act made in the last session, for repealing the duty
granted by an act of the sixth year of the reign of his
late Majesty on silver plate, and for granting a duty on
licenses to be taken out by all persons dealing in gold
and silver plate,” was enacted into a law by the royal
sanction. By this new regulation, small quantities of gold
and silver plate were allowed to be sold without license.
Instead of the duty before payable upon licenses, another
was granted, to be taken out by certain dealers in gold and
silver plate, pawnbrokers, and refiners. This affair being
discussed, the House took into consideration the claims of
the proprietors of lands purchased for the better securing
of his Majesty's docks, ships, and stores at Chatham,
Portsmouth, and Plymouth; and for better fortifying the
town of Portsmouth and citadel of Plymouth, in pursuance
of an act passed in the last session. We have already spe∣cified
the sum granted for this purpose, in consequence of a
resolution of the House, upon which a bill being founded,
soon passed into a law, without opposition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The next bill which was brought into the House related to the sum∣mons issued by the commissioners of the Excise, and justices of the peace, for the appearance of persons offending against, or for forfeitures incurred by the laws of Excise. As some doubts had arisen with respect to the method of summoning in such cases, this bill, which obtained the royal assent in due course, enacted, that a summons left at the House, or usual place of resi∣dence, or with the wife, child, or menial servants of the person so summoned, should be held as legal notice, as we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l as the leaving such notice at the house, workhouse, warehouse, shop, cellar, vault, or usual place of residence of such person, directed to him by his right or assumed name; and all dealers in coffee, tea, or chocolate were subjected to the penalty of twenty pounds as often as they should neglect to attend the commissioners of Excise, when summoned in this manner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>§ XIX. In the month of April, a bill was brought in for
the more effectual preventing the fraudulent importation
of cambricks; and whilst it was under deliberation, several
<PB N="416" REF="420"/>
merchants and wholesale drapers of the city of London
presented a petition, representing the grievances to which
they, and many thousands of other traders, would be sub∣jected,
should the bill, as it then stood, be passed into a
law. According to their request, they were heard by
their counsel on the merits of this remonstrance, and
some amendments were made to the bill in their favour.
At length it received the royal assent, and became a law
to the following effect: It enacted, that no cambricks,
French lawns, or linens of this kind, usually entered
under the denomination of cambricks, should be imported
after the first day of next August, but in bales, cases, or
boxes, covered with sackcloth or canvas, containing each
one hundred whole pieces, or two hundred half pieces, on
penalty of forfeiting the whole: that cambricks and French
lawns should be imported for exportation only, lodged in
the king's warehouse, and delivered out under like security
and restrictions as prohibited East-India merchandise▪
and, on importation, pay only the half subsidy: that all
cambricks and French lawns in the custody of any persons
should be deposited, by the first of August, in the king's
warehouses, the bonds thereupon be delivered up, and the
drawback on exportation paid; yet the goods should not
be delivered out again but for exportation: that cambricks
and French lawns exposed to sale, or found in the possession
of private persons, after the said day, should be forfeited,
and liable to be searched for, and seised, in like manner
as other prohibited and uncustomed goods are; and the
offender should forfeit two hundred pounds, over and above
all other penalties and forfeitures inflicted by any former
act: that if any doubt should arise concerning the species
or quality of the goods, or the place where they were
manufactured, the proof should lie on the owner: finally,
that the penalty of five pounds, inflicted by a former act,
and payable to the informer, on any person that should
wear any cambrick or French lawns, should still remain in
force, and be recoverable, on conviction, by oath of one
witness, before one justice of the peace.—The last success∣ful
<PB N="417" REF="421"/>
bill which this session produced was that relating to the
augmentation of the salaries of the judges in his Ma∣jesty's
superior courts of justice. A motion having been
made for an instruction to the committee of supply, to
consider of the said augmentation, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer acquainted the House that this augmentation
was recommended to them by his Majesty. Nevertheless,
the motion was opposed, and a warm debate ensued. At
length, however, being carried in the affirmative, the
committee agreed to certain resolutions, on which a bill
was founded. While it remained under discussion, a
motion was made for an instruction to the committee, that
they should have power to receive a clause or clauses
for restraining the judges, comprehended within the pro∣visions
of the bill, from receiving any fee, gift, present, or
entertainment from any city, town, borough, or corpo∣ration,
or from any sheriff, jailer, or other officer, upon
their several respective circuits, and from taking any gra∣tuity
from any office or officer of any of the courts of law.
Another motion was made, for a clause restraining such
judges, barons, and justices, as were comprehended with∣in
the provisions of the bill, from interfering, otherwise
than by giving their own votes, in any election of mem∣bers
to serve in parliament; but both these proposals,
being put to the vote, were carried in the negative.
These two motions being over-ruled by the majority, the
bill underwent some amendments; and, having passed
through both Houses in the ordinary course, was enacted
into a law by the royal sanction. With respect to the
import of this act, it is no other than the establishment of
the several stamp-duties, applied to the augmentation;
and the appropriation of their produce in such a manner,
that the crown cannot alter the application of the sums
thus granted in parliament. But, on this occasion, no
attempt was made in favour of the independency of the
judges, which seems to have been invaded by a late in∣terpretation
of, or rather by a deviation from, the act of
settlement; in which it is expressly ordained, that the
<PB N="418" REF="422"/>
commissions of the judges should continue in force <HI>quam dia
se bene gesserine;</HI> that their salaries should be fixed, and
none of them removeable but by an address of both Houses
of parliament. It was then, without all doubt, the in∣tention
of the legislature that every judge should enjoy
his office during life, unless convicted by legal trial of
some misbehaviour, or unless both Houses of parliament
should concur in desiring his removal: but the doctrine
now adopted imports, that no commission can continue
in force longer than the life of the King by whom it was
granted; that therefore the commissions of the judges mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
be renewed by a new king a his accession, who should
have it in his power to employ either those whom he
finds acting as judges at his accession, or confer their
offices on others, with no other restraint than that the
condition of the new commissions should be <HI>quam dia se
bene gesserint.</HI> Thus the office of a judge is rendered
more precarious, and the influence of the crown receives
a considerable re-enforcement.</P>
<P>§ XX. Among the bills that miscarried in the course
of this session, we may number a second attempt to carry
into execution the scheme which was offered last year for
the more effectual manning the navy, preventing desertion,
and relieving and encouraging the seamen of Great-Bri∣tain.
A bill was accordingly brought in, couched
in nearly the same terms which had been rejected in
the last session; and it was supported by a considerable
number of members, animated with a true spirit of pa∣triotism:
but to the trading part of the nation it appeared
one of those plausible projects, which, though agreeable in
speculation, can never be reduced into practice without a con∣comitancy
of greater evils than those they were intended to
remove. While the bill remained under the consideration
of the House, petitions were presented against it by the mer∣chants
of Bristol, Scarborough, Whitby, Kingston-upon-Hull,
and Lancaster, representing, That, by such a law▪
the trade of the kingdom, which is the nursery and support
of seamen at all times, and that spirit of equipping private
<PB N="419" REF="423"/>
ships of war, which had been of distinguished service to
the nation, would be laid under such difficulties as might
cause a great stagnation in the former, and a total sup∣pression
of the latter; the bill, therefore would be highly
prejudicial to the marine of the kingdom, and altogether
ineffectual for the purposes intended. A great number of
books and papers, relating to trading ships and vessels as well
as to seamen, and other persons protected or pressed into the
navy, and to expenses occasioned by pressing men into
the navy, were examined in a committee of the whole
House, and the bill was improved with many amend∣ments:
may, after it was printed and engrossed, several
clauses were added by way of rider; yet still the experi∣ment
seemed dangerous. The motion for its being passed
was violently opposed; warm debates ensued; they were
adjourned, and resumed; and the arguments against the
bill appeared at length in such a striking light, that, when
the question was put, the majority declared for the nega∣tive.
The regulations which had been made in parlia∣ment
during the twenty-sixth, the twenty-eighth, and
thirtieth years of the present reign, for the preservation of
the publick roads, being attended with some inconve∣niencies
in certain parts of the kingdom, petitions were
brought from some counties in Wales, as well as from the
freeholders of Herefordshire, the farmers of Middlesex,
and others, enumerating the difficulties attending the use
of broad wheels in one case, and the limitation of horses
used in drawing carriages with narrow wheels in the other.
The matter of these remonstrances was considered in a
committee of the whole House, which resolved that the
weight to be carried by all waggons and carts travelling on
the turnpike roads should be limited. On this resolution
a bill was framed, for amending and reducing into one act
of parliament the three acts before mentioned for the
preservation of the publick highways: but some objections
being started, and a petition interposed by the land-owners
of Suffolk and Norfolk, alledging that the bill, if passed
into a law, would render it impossible to bring fresh provi∣sions
<PB N="420" REF="424"/>
from those counties to London, as the supply de∣pended
absolutely upon the quickness of conveyance, the
further consideration of it was postponed to a longer day,
and never resumed in the sequel: so that the attempt
miscarried.</P>
<P>§ XXI. Of all the subjects which, in the course of this
session, fell under the cognizance of parliament, there
was none that more interested the humanity or challenged
the redress of the ligislature than did the case of the poor
insolvent debtors, who languished under all the miseries of
indigence and imprisonment. In the month of February
a petition was offered to the Commons in behalf of bank∣rupts,
who represented, That having scrupulously con∣formed
to the laws made concerning bankruptcy, by sur∣rendering
their all upon oath for the benefit of their credi∣tors,
they had nevertheless been refused their certificates,
without any probability of relief; that by this cruel re∣fusal,
many bankrupts had been obliged to abscond, while
others were immured in prison, and these unhappy suffer∣ers
groaned under the particular hardship of being excluded
from the benefit of law occasionally made for the relief of
insolvent debtors; that the power vested in creditors of
refusing certificates to their bankrupts was, as the peti∣tioners
conceived, founded upon a presumption that such
power would be tenderly exercised, and never but in noto∣rious
cases; but the great increase in the number of bank∣rupts
within two years past, and the small proportion of
those who had been able to obtain their certificates, seemed
to demonstrate that the power had been used for cruel and
unjust purposes, contrary to the intention of the le∣gislature:
that as the greater part of the petitioners, and
their fellow-sufferers, must inevitably and speedily perish,
with their distressed families, unless seasonably relieved by
the interposition of parliament, they implored the com∣passion
of the House, from which they hoped immediate
favour and relief. This petition was accompanied with a
printed case, explaining the nature of the laws relating to
bankrupts, and pointing out their defects in point of policy
<PB N="421" REF="425"/>
as well as humanity; but little regard was seemingly paid
to either remonstrance. Other petitions, however, being
presented by insolvent debtors imprisoned in different jails
within the kingdom, leave was given to bring in a bill
for their relief, and a committee appointed to examine
the laws relating to bankruptcy.</P>
<P>§ XXII. Among other petitionary remonstrances on
this subject, the members were separately presented with
the printed case of Captain George Walker, a prisoner in
the jail of the King's-Bench, who had been declared a
bankrupt and complained, that he had been subjected to
some flagrant acts of injustice and oppression. The case
contained such extraordinary allegations, and the captain's
character was so remarkably fair and interesting, that the
committee, which were empowered to send for persons,
papers, and records, resolved to enquire into the particu∣lars
of his misfortune. A motion was made and agreed
to, that the marshal of the prison should bring the captain
before the committee, and the Speaker's warrant was
issued accordingly. The prisoner was produced, and ex∣amined
at several sittings; and some of the members ex∣pressed
a laudable eagerness to do him justice: but his
antagonists were very powerful, and left no stone un∣turned
to frustrate the purpose of the enquiry, which was
dropped of course at the end of the session. Thus the un∣fortunate
Captain Walker, who had, in the late war,
remarkably distinguished himself at sea by his courage and
conduct, repeatedly signalised himself against the enemies of
his country, was sent back, without redress, to the gloomy
mansions of a jail, where he had already pined for several
years, useless to himself, and lost to the community,
while he might have been profitably employed in retriev∣ing
his own fortune, and exerting his talents for the ge∣neral
advantage of the nation. While this affair was in
agitation, the bill for the relief of insolvent debtors was
prepared, printed, and read a second time; but, when the
motion was made for its being committed, a debate arose,
and this was adjourned from time to time till the end of
<PB N="422" REF="426"/>
the session. In the mean time, the committee continued to
deliberate upon the laws relating to bankruptcy; and
in the beginning of June reported their resolution to the
House, that, in their opinion, some amendments might
be made to the laws concerning bankruptcy; to be ad∣vantage
of creditors, and relief of insolvents. Such
was the notice vouchsafed to the cries of many British
subjects, deprived of liberty, and destitute of the com∣mon
necessaries of life.</P>
<P>§ XXIII. It would engage us in a long digressive dis∣cussion,
were we to enquire how the spirit of the laws in
England, so framed for lenity, has been exasperated into
such severity against insolvent debtors; and why, among
a people so distinguished for generosity and compassion,
the jails should be more filled with prisoners than they are
in any other part of Christendom. Perhaps both these de∣viations
from a general character are violent efforts of a wary
legislature made in behalf of trade, which cannot be too
much cherished in a nation that principally depends upon
commerce. The question is, whether this laudable aim may
not be more effectually accomplished, without subjecting in∣dividuals
to oppression, arising from the cruelty and revenge
of one another. As the laws are modelled at present, it
cannot be denied that the debtor, in some cases, lies in a
peculiar manner at the mercy of his creditor. By the ori∣ginal
and common law of England, no man could be im∣prisoned
for debt. The plaintiff in any civil action
could have no execution upon his judgement against either
the body or the lands of the defendant: even with respect
to his good and chattels, which were subject to execution,
he was obliged to leave him such articles as were necessary
for agriculture. But, in process of time, this indulgence
being found prejudicial to commerce, a law was enacted,
in the reign of Edward the First, allowing execution on
the person of the debtor, provided his goods and chattels
were not sufficient to pay the debt which he had contracted.
This law was still attended with a very obvious inconve∣nience.
The debtor who possessed an estate in lands was
<PB N="423" REF="427"/>
tempted to secrete his moveable effects, and live in con∣cealment
on the produce of his lands, while the sheriff
connived at his retirement. To remove this evil, a second
statute was enacted in the same reign, granting immediate
execution against the body, lands, and goods of the debtor;
yet his effects could not be sold for the benefit of his credi∣tor
till the expiration of three months, during which he
himself could dispose of them for ready money, in order
to discharge his incumbrances. If the creditor was not
satisfied in this manner, he continued in possession of the
debtor's lands, and detained the debtor himself in prison,
where he was obliged to supply him with bread and water
for his support, until the debt was discharged. Other
severe regulations were made in the sequel, particularly
in the reign of Edward the Third, which gave rise to the
writ of <HI>capias ad satisfaciendum.</HI> This, indeed, rendered
the preceding laws, called statute-merchant, and statute-staple,
altogether unnecessary. Though the liberty of
the subject, and the security of the landholder, were thus,
in some measure, sacrificed to the advantage of commerce,
an imprisoned debtor was not left entirely at the mercy of
an inexorable creditor. If he made all the satisfaction
in his power, and could show that his insolvency was
owing to real misfortunes, the court of Chancery inter∣posed
on his petition, and actually ordered him to be dis∣charged
from prison, when no good reason for detaining
him could be assigned. This interposition, which seems
naturally to belong to a court of equity, constituted with
a view to mitigate the rigour of the common law, ceased,
in all probability, after the restoration of Charles the
Second, and of consequence the prisons were filled with
debtors. Then the legislature charged themselves with
the extension of a power, which perhaps a chancellor no
longer thought himself safe in exercising; and in the year
one thousand six hundred and seventy, passed the first act
for the relief of insolvent debtors, granting a release to
all prisoners for debt, without distinction or enquiry.
By this general indulgence, which has even in a great
<PB N="424" REF="428"/>
measure continued in all subsequent acts of the same kind,
the lenity of the parliament may be sometimes misapplied,
inasmuch as insolvency is often criminal, arsing from
profligacy and extravagance, which deserve to be severely
punished. Yet, even for this species of insolvency, per∣petual
imprisonment, aggravated by the miseries of ex∣treme
indigence, and the danger of perishing through
famine, may be deemed a punishment too severe. How
cruel then must it be to leave the most innocent bankrupt
exposed to this punishment, from the revenge or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inister
design of a merciless creditor; a creditor, by whose fraud
perhaps the prisoner became a bankrupt, and by whose
craft he is detained in jail, lest, by his discharge from pri∣son,
he should be enabled to seek that redress in Chancery
to which he is entitled on a fair account! The severity of
the law was certainly intended against fraudulent bankrupts
only; and the statute of bankruptcy is, doubtless, favour∣able
to insolvents, as it discharges from all former debts
those who obtain their certificates. As British subjects,
they are surely entitled to the same indulgence which is
granted to other insolvents. They were always included
in every act passed for the relief of insolvent debtors, till
the sixth year of George I. when they were first excepted
from this benefit. By a law enacted in the reign of Queen
Anne, relating to bankruptcy, any creditor was at liberty
to object to the confirmation of the bankrupt's certificate;
but the chancellor had power to judge whether the ob∣jection
was frivolous or well founded: yet, by a later act,
the chancellor is obliged to confirm the certificate, if it
is agreeable to four-fifths in number and value of the credi∣tors;
whereas he cannot confirm it, should he be opposed,
even without any reason assigned, by one creditor to whom
the greatest part of the debt is owing. It might, there∣fore,
deserve the consideration of parliament, whether,
in extending their clemency to the poor, it should not be
equally diffused to bankrupts and other insolvents; whether
proper distinction ought not to be made between the inno∣cent
bankrupt, who fails through misfortunes in trade,
<PB N="425" REF="429"/>
and him who becomes insolvent from fraud or profligacy;
and finally, whether the enquiry and trial of all such cases
would not properly fall within the province of chancery,
a tribunal instituted for the mitigation of common law?</P>
<P>§ XXIV. The House of Commons seems to have been
determined on another measure, which, however, does
not admit of explanation. An order was made in the
month of February, that leave should be given to bring
in a bill to explain, amend, and render effectual so much
of an act, passed in the thirteenth year of George II.
against the excessive increase of horse-races, and deceitful
gaming, as related to that increase. The bill was accord∣ingly
presented, read, printed, and ordered to be com∣mitted
to a committee of the whole House; but the order
was delayed from time to time till the end of the session.
Some progress was likewise made in another affair of
greater consequence to the community. A committee
was appointed in the month of March, to take into con∣sideration
the state of the poor in England, as well as the
laws enacted for their maintenance. The clerks of the
peace belonging to all the counties, cities, and towns in
England and Wales, were ordered to transmit, for the
perusal of the House, an account of the annual expense
of passing vagrants through their respective divisions and
districts for four years; and the committee began to de∣liberate
on this important subject. In the latter end of
May the House was made acquainted with their reso∣lutions,
importing, that the present method of relieving
the poor in the respective parishes, where no workhouses
have been provided for their reception and employment,
are, in general, very burthensome to the inhabitants, and
tend to render the poor miserable to themselves, and use∣less
to the community: that the present method of giving
money out of the parochial rates to persons capable of
labour, in order to prevent them from claiming an entire
subsistence for themselves and their families, is contrary
to the spirit and intention of the laws for the relief of the
poor, is a dangerous power in the hands of parochial
<PB N="426" REF="430"/>
officers, a misapplication of the publick money, and a
great encouragement to idleness and intemperance: that
the employment of the poor, under proper direction
and management, in such works and manufactures as are
suited to their respective capacities, would be of great
utility to the publick: that settling the poor in workhouses,
to be provided in the several counties and ridings in Eng∣land
and Wales, under the direction and management of
governors and trustees to be appointed for that purpose,
would be the most effectual method of relieving such poor
persons, as, by age, infirmities, or diseases, are rendered
incapable of supporting themselves by their labour; of
employing the able and industrious, reforming the idle and
profligate, and of educating poor children in religion and
industry: that the poor in such workhouses would be
better regulated and maintained, and managed with more
advantage to the publick, by guardians, governors, or
trustees, to be specially appointed, or chosen for the
purpose, and incorporated with such powers, and under
such restrictions, as the legislature should deem proper,
than by the annual parochial officers: that erecting work∣houses
upon waste lands, and appropriating a certain
quantity of such lands to be cultivated, in order to produce
provision for the poor in the said houses, would not only
be a means of instructing and employing many of the said
poor in agriculture, but lessen the expense of the publick:
that controversies and law-suits concerning the settle∣ments
of poor persons occasioned a very great, and, in
general, an useless expense to the publick, amounting to
many thousand pounds per annum; and that often more
money is expended in ascertaining such settlements, by each
of the contending parishes, than would be sufficient to
maintain the paupers: that should workhouses be establish∣ed
for the general reception of the poor, in the respective
counties and ridings of England, the laws relating to
the settlements of the poor, and the passing of vagrants,
might be repealed: that while the present laws relating to
the poor subsist, the compelling parish-officers to grant
<PB N="427" REF="431"/>
certificates to the poor would, in all probability, prevent
the hardships they now suffer, in being debarred gaining
their livelihood, where they can do it mostusefully to them∣selves
and the publick. From these sensible resolutions,
the reader may conceive some idea of the misconduct that
attends the management of the poor in England, as well
as of the grievous burthens entailed upon the people by
the present laws which constitute this branch of the legis∣lature.
The committee's resolves being read at the table,
an order was made that they should be taken into consider∣ation
on a certain day, when the order was again put off,
and in the interim the parliament was prorogued. While
the committee deliberated upon this affair, leave was given
to prepare a bill for preventing tenants under a certain
yearly rent from gaining settlements in any particular
parish, by being there rated in any land-tax assessment,
and paying for the landlord the money so charged. This
order was afterwards discharged; and another bill brought
in, to prevent any person from gaining a settlement, by
being rated by virtue of an act of parliament for granting
any aid to his Majesty by a land-tax, and paying the
same. The bill was accordingly presented, read, com∣mitted,
and passed the Lower House; but among the
Lords it miscarried. It can never be expected that the
poor will be managed with oeconomy and integrity,
while the execution of the laws relating to their mainte∣nance
is left in the hands of low tradesmen, who derive
private advantage from supplying them with necessaries,
and often favour the imposition of one another with the
most scandalous collusion. This is an evil which will
never be remedied, until persons of independent fortune,
and unblemished integrity, actuated by a spirit of true
patriotism, shall rescue their fellow-citizens from the
power of such interested miscreants, by taking the poor
into their own management and protection. Instead of
multiplying laws with respect to the settlement and ma∣nagement
of the poor, which serve only to puzzle and
perplex the parish and peace officers, it would become the
<PB N="428" REF="432"/>
sagacity of the ligislature to take some effectual precautions
to prevent the increase of paupers and vagrants, which is
become an intolerable nuisance to the commonwealth.
Towards this salutary end, surely nothing would more
contribute than a reformation of the police, that would
abolish those infamous places of entertainment, which
swarm in every corner of the metropolis, seducing people of
all ranks to extravagance, profligacy, and ruin; that would
restrict within due bounds the number of publick-houses,
which are augmented to an enormous degree, affording so
many asylums for riot and debauchery, and corrupting
the morals of the common people to such a pitch of licen∣tious
indecency, as must be a reproach to every civilised
nation. Let it not be affirmed, to the disgrace of Great-Britain,
that such receptacles of vice and impunity subsist
under the connivance of the government, according to the
narrow views and confined speculation of those shallow
politicians, who imagine that the revenue is increased in
proportion to the quantity of strong liquors consumed in
such infamous recesses of intemperance. Were this in
reality the case, that administration would deserve to be
branded with eternal infamy, which could sacrifice to
such a base consideration the health, the lives, and the
morals of their fellow-creatures: but nothing can be more
fallacious, than the supposition, that the revenue of any
government can be increased by the augmented intempe∣rance
of the people; for intemperance is the bane of in∣dustry,
as well as of population; and what the government
gains in the articles of the duty on malt, and the excise
upon liquors, will always be greatly over-balanced by the
loss in other articles, arising from the diminution of hands,
and the neglect of labour.</P>
<P>§ XXV. Exclusive of the bills that were actually pre∣pared,
though they did not pass in the course of this session,
the Commons deliberated on other important subjects,
which, however, were not finally discussed. In the begin∣ning
of the session, a committee being appointed to re∣sume
the enquiry touching the regulation of weights and
<PB N="429" REF="433"/>
measures, a subject we have mentioned in the history of
the preceding session, the box which contained a Troy
pound weight, locked up by order of the House, was
again produced by the clerk in whose custody it had been
deposited. This affair being carefully investigated, the
committee agree to fourteen resolutions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the curiosity of the reader may be interested in these resolutions, we shall here insert them for his satisfaction. The committee resolved, that the ell ought to contain one yard and one quarter, according to the yard men∣tioned in the third resolution of the former committee upon the subject of weights and measures: that the pole, or per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, should contain in length five such yards and a half; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur long two hundred and twenty; and the mile one thousand seven hundred and sixty: that the superficial perch should contain thirty square yards and a quarter; the rood one thousand two hundred and ten; and the acre four thousand eight hundred and forty: that according to the fourth, fifth, and sixth resolutions of the former committee, upon the subject of weights and measures, agreed to by the House on the second day of June in the preceding year, the quart ought to contain seventy cubical inches and one half; the pint thirty-five and one quarter; the peck five hundred and sixty-four; and the bushel two thousand two hundred and fifty-six. That the several parts of the pound, mentioned in the eighth resolution of the former committee, examined and adjusted in presence of this committee, viz. the half pound or six ounces, quarter of a pound or three ounces, two ounces, one ounce, two half ounces, the five penny-weight, three penny weight, two-penny weight, and one penny weight, the twelve grains, six grains, three grains, two grains, and two of one grain each, ought to be the models of the several parts of the said pound, and to be used for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>izing or ad∣justing weights for the future. That all weights exceeding a pound should be of brass, copper, bell-metal, or cast-iron: and all those of cast-iron should be made in the form, and with a handle of hammered iron, such as the pattern herewith produced, having the mark of the weight cast in the iron: and all weights of a pound, or under, should be of gold, silver, brass, copper, or bell-metal. That all weights of cast-iron should have the initial letters of the name of the maker upon the upper bar of the handle; and all other weights should have the same, together with the mark of the weight, according to this standard, upon some convenient part thereof. That the yard, mentioned in the second resolution of the former committee, upon the subject of weights and measures, agreed to by the House in the last session, being the standard of length, and the pound, mentioned in the eighth resolu∣tion, being the standard of weight, ought to be deposited in the court of the receipt of the Exchequer, and there safely kept under the seals of the chancel∣lor of the said Exchequer, and of the chief baron, and the seal of office of the chamberlain of the Exchequer, and not to be opened but by the order and in the presence of the chancellor of the Exchequer and chief baron for the time being. That the most effectual means to ascertain uniformity in mea∣sures of length and weight, to be used throughout the realm, would be to appoint certain persons at one particular office, with clerks and workmen under them, for the purpose only of sizing and adjusting, for the use of the subjects, all measures of length, and all weights, being parts, multiples, or certain proportions of the standards to be used for the future. That a model or pattern of the said standard yard, mentioned in the second resolution of the former committee, and now in the custody of the clerk of the House, and a model or pattern of the standard pound, mentioned in the eighth resolution of that committee, together with models or patterns of the parts of the said pound, now presented to the House, and also of the multiples of the said pound, mentioned in this report (when the same are adjusted) should be kept in the said office, in custody of the said persons to be appointed for sizing weights and measures, under the seal of the chief baron of the Exchequer for the time being, to be opened only by order of the said chief baron, in his presence, or the presence of one of the barons of the Exchequer, on the appli∣cation of the said persons, for the purpose of correcting and adjusting, as occa∣sion should require, the patterns or models used at the said office, for sizing measures of length and weight, delivered out to the subjects. That models or patterns of the said standard yard and standard pound aforesaid, and also models or patterns of the parts and multiples aforesaid of the said pound, should be lodged in the said office for the sizing of such measures of length or weight, as, being parts, multiples, or proportions of the said standards, should hereafter be required by any of his Majesty's subjects. That all mea∣sures of length and weight, sized at the said office, should be marked in some convenient part thereof with such marks as should be thought expedient, to shew the identity of the measures and weights sized at the said office, and to discover any frauds that may be committed therein. That the said office should be kept within a convenient distance of the court of Exchequer at Westminster; and that all measures of length and weight, within a certain distance of London, should be corrected and re-assized, as occasion should re∣quire, at the said office. That, in order to enforce the uniformity in weights and measures to be used for the future, all persons appointed by the crown to act as justices of the peace in any county, city, or town corporate, being respectively counties within themselves, throughout the realm, should be em∣powered to hear and determine, and put the law in execution, in respect to weights and measures only, without any of them being obliged to sue out a <HI>dedimus,</HI> or to act in any other matter: and the said commissioners should be empowered to sue, imprison, inflict, or mitigate such penalties as should be thought proper; and have such other authorities as should be necessary for compelling the use of weights and measures, agreeably to the aforesaid stand∣ards. That models or pattern of the said standard yard and pound, and of the parts and multiples thereof, before-mentioned, should be distributed in each county, in such a manner as to be readily used for evidence in all cases where measures and weights should be questioned before the said commissioner▪ and for adjusting the same in a proper manner.</NOTE> In the mean
<PB N="430" REF="434"/>
time it was ordered, that all weights, referred to in the
report, should be delivered to the clerk of the House, to
be locked up, and brought forth again occasionally.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="435"/>
§ XXVI. The House of Commons, among other ar∣ticles
of domestick oeconomy, bestowed some attention on
the hospital for foundlings, which was now, more than
ever, become a matter of national consideration. The
accounts relating to this charity having been demanded,
and subjected to the inspection of the members, were, to∣gether
with the King's recommendation, referred to the
committee of supply, where they produced the resolutions
which we have already specified among the other grants
of the year. The House afterwards resolved itself into a
committee, to deliberate on the state of the hospital, and
examine its accounts. On the third day of May their re∣solutions
were reported to the following effect: That the
appointing, by the governors and guardians of the said
hospital, places in the several counties, ridings, or di∣visions
in this kingdom, for the first reception of exposed
and deserted young children would be attended with
many evil consequences; and that the conveying of
children from the country to the said hospital is attended
with many evil consequences, and ought to be prevented.
A bill was ordered to be brought in, founded upon this
last resolution; but never presented, therefore the enquiry
produced no effect. Notwithstanding the institution of
this charity, for the support of which great sums are yearly
levied on the publick, it does not appear that the bills of
mortality, respecting new-born children, are decreased,
nor the shocking crime of infant-murther rendered less
frequent than heretofore. It may, therefore, be not im∣properly
stiled a heavy additional tax for the propagation
of bastardy, and the encouragement of idleness, among the
common people; besides the tendency it has to extinguish
the feelings of the heart, and dissolve those family ties of
blood by which the charities are connected.</P>
<P>§ XXVII. In the month of March leave was given to
bring in a bill for the more effectual preventing of the
melting down and exporting the gold and silver coin of
the kingdom, and the persons were nominated to prepare
<PB N="432" REF="436"/>
it; but the bill never appeared, and no further enquiry
was made about the matter. Perhaps it was supposed
that such a measure might be thought an encroachment on
the prerogative of the crown, which hath always exercised
the power of fixing the standard and regulating the cur∣rency
of the coin. Perhaps such a step was deferred on
account of the war, during which a great quantity of
gold and silver was necessarily exported to the continent,
for the support of the allies and armies in the pay of
Great-Britain. The legislature, however, would do well
to consider this eternal maxim in computation, that when
a greater quantity of bullion is exported, in waste, than
can be replaced by commerce, the nation must be hastening
to a state of insolvency. Over and above these proceed∣ings
in this session of parliament, it may not be unnecessary
to mention several messages which were sent by the King
to the House of Commons. That relating to the vote of
credit we have already specified in our account of the Sup∣ply.
On the twenty-sixth day of April the Chancellor of
the Exchequer presented to the House two messages,
signed by his Majesty, one in favour of his subjects in
North-America, and the other in behalf of the East-India
company: the former recommending to their considera∣tion
the zeal and vigour with which his faithful subjects in
North-America had exerted themselves, in defence of his
just rights and possessions; desiring he might be enabled to
give them a proper compensation for the expenses in∣curred
by the respective provinces in levying, clothing,
and paying the troops raised in that country, according as
the active vigour and strenuous efforts of the several colo∣nies
should appear to merit. In the latter, he desired the
House would empower him to assist the East-India com∣pany
in defraying the expense of a military force in the
East-Indies, to be maintained by them, in lieu of a bat∣talion
of regular troops withdrawn from thence, and re∣turned
to Ireland. Both these messages were referred to
the committee of supply, and produced the resolutions
<PB N="433" REF="437"/>
upon each subject which we have already explained. The
message relating to a projected invasion by the enemies of
Great-Britain we shall particularise in its proper place,
when we come to record the circumstances and miscarriage
of that design. In the mean time, it may not be improper
to observe, that the thanks of the House of Commons
were voted and given to Admiral Boscawen and Major-General
Amherst, for the services they had done their
king and country in North-America; and the same com∣pliment
was paid to Admiral Osborne, for the success of
his cruise in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>§ XXVIII. The session was closed on the second day
of June with a speech to both Houses, from the com∣missioners
appointed by his Majesty for that purpose. In
this harangue the parliament was given to understand,
that the King approved of their conduct, and returned
them his thanks for their condescension; that the hopes
he had conceived of their surmounting the difficulties
which lay in the way were founded on the wisdom, zeal,
and affection of so good a parliament; and that his ex∣pectations
were fully answered; that they had considered
the war in all its parts, and notwithstanding its long con∣tinuance,
through the obstinacy of the enemy, had made
such provision for the many different operations as ought
to convince the adversaries of Great-Britain, that it would
be for their interest, as well as for the ease and relief of
all Europe, to embrace equitable and honourable terms of
accommodation. They were told that, by their assistance,
the combined army in Germany had been completed;
powerful squadrons, as well as numerous bodies of land∣forces,
were employed in America, in order to maintain
the British rights and possessions, and annoy the enemy
in the most sensible manner in that country: that, as
France was making considerable preparations in her dif∣ferent
ports, he had taken care to put his sleet at home in
the best condition, both of strength and situation, to guard
against and repel any attempts that might be meditated
against his kingdoms: that all his measures had been
<PB N="434" REF="438"/>
directed to assert the honour of his crown; to preserve
the essential interests of his faithful subjects; to support
the cause of the protestant religion, and publick liberty:
he, therefore, trusted that the uprightness of his intentions
would draw down the blessing of heaven upon his endea∣vours.
He expressed his hope, that the precautions they
had taken to prevent and correct the excesses of the pri∣vateers
would produce the desired effect: a consideration
which the king had much at heart; for, though sensible
of the utility of that service, when under proper regula∣tions,
he was determined to do his utmost to prevent any
injuries or hardships which might be sustained by the sub∣jects
of neutral powers, as far as might be practicable and
consistent with his Majesty's just right to hinder the trade
of his enemies from being collusively and fraudulently
covered. He not only thanked the Commons, but ap∣plauded
the firmness and vigour with which they had
acted, as well as their prudence in judging, that, notwith∣standing
the present burthens, the making ample provi∣sion
for carrying on the war was the most probable
means to bring it to an honourable and happy conclusion.
He assured them that no attention should be wanting, on
his part, for the faithful application of what had been
granted. They were informed he had nothing fur∣ther
to desire, but that they should carry down the same
good dispositions, and propagate them in their several
counties, which they had shown in their proceedings dur∣ing
the session. These declarations being pronounced,
the parliament was prorogued.</P>
<P>§ XXIX. The people of England, provoked on one
hand by the intrigues, the hostilities, and menaces of
France, and animated on the other by the pride of tri∣umph
and success, which never fails to reconcile them to
difficulties, howsoever great, and expense, however enor∣mous,
at this period breathed nothing but war, and dis∣coursed
about nothing but new plans of conquest. We
have seen how liberally the parliament bestowed the na∣tion's
money; and the acquiescence of the subjects in
<PB N="435" REF="439"/>
general under the additional burthens which had been im∣posed,
appeared in the remarkable eagerness with which
they embarked in the subscription planned by the le∣gislature;
in the vigorous assistance they contributed to∣wards
manning the navy, recruiting the army, and le∣vying
additional forces; and the warlike spirit which be∣gan
to diffuse itself through all ranks of the people. This
was a spirit which the ministry carefully cherished and
cultivated, for the support of the war, which, it must be
owned, was prosecuted with an ardour and efficacy pecu∣liar
to the present administration. True it is, the Ger∣man
mar had been for some time adopted as an object of
importance by the British councils, and a resolution was
taken to maintain it without flinching: at the same time,
it must be allowed, that this consideration had not hitherto
weakened the attention of the ministry to the operations
in America, where alone the war may be said to have been
carried on and prosecuted on British principles, so as to
distress the enemy in their most tender part, and at the
same time acquire the most substantial advantages to the
subjects of Britain. For these two purposes, every pre∣paration
was made that sagacity could suggest, or vigour
execute. The navy was repaired and augmented, and in
order to man the different squadrons, the expedient of
pressing, that disgrace to a British administration, was
practised both by land and water with extraordinary rigour
and vivacity. A proclamation was issued, offering a con∣siderable
bounty for every seaman and even landman that
should, by a certain day, enter voluntarily into the service.
As an additional encouragement to this class of people,
the King promised his pardon to all seamen who had de∣serted
from the respective ships to which they belonged,
provided they should return to their duty by the third day of
July; but at the same time he declared, that those who
should neglect this opportunity, at a time when their coun∣try
so much required their service, would, upon being ap∣prehended,
incur the penalty of a court-martial, and, if
convicted, be deemed unfit objects of the royal mercy.
<PB N="436" REF="440"/>
All justices of the peace, mayors, and magistrates of cor∣porations
throughout Great-Britain were commanded to
make particular search for straggling seamen fit for the
service, and to send all that should be found to the nearest
sea-port, that they might be sent on board by the sea-officer
there commanding. Other methods more gentle
and effectual were taken to levy and recruit the land-forces.
New regiments were raised, on his Majesty's pro∣mise,
that every man should be entitled to his discharge
at the end of three years, and the premiums for inlisting
were increased. Over and above these indulgences, con∣siderable
bounties were offered and given by cities, towns,
corporations, and even by individuals, so universally were
the people possessed with aspirit of chivalry and adventure.
The example was sent by the metropolis, where the com∣mon-council
resolved that voluntary subscriptions should
be received in the chamber of London, to be appropriated
as bounty-money to such persons as should engage in his
Majesty's service. The city subscribed a considerable sum
for that purpose; and a committee of aldermen and com∣moners
was appointed to attend at Guildhall, to receive
and apply the subscriptions. As a further encourage∣ment
to volunteers, they moreover resolved, that every
person so entering should be entitled to the freedom of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, at the expiration of three years, or sooner, if the war
should be brought to a conclusion. These resolutions
being communicated to the King, he was pleased to sig∣nify
his approbation, and return his thanks to the city, in
a letter from the secretary of state to the Lord-Mayor.
Large sums were immediately subscribed by different com∣panies,
and some private persons; and, in imitation of the
capital, bounties were offered by many different communi∣ties
in every quarter of the united kingdom. At the same
time, such care and diligence were used in disciplining the
militia, that, before the close of the year, the greater part
of those truely constitutional battalions rivalled the regu∣lar
troops in the perfection of their exercise, and seemed
to be in all respects as fit for actual service.</P>
<P><PB N="437" REF="441"/>
§ XXX. Before we proceed to record the transactions
of the campaign that suceeded these preparations, we shall
take notice of some domestick events, which, though not
very important in themselves, may nevertheless claim a
place in the History of England. In the beginning of the
year, the court of London was overwhelmed with af∣fliction
at the death of the Princess Dowager of Orange
and Nassau, governante of the United Provinces in the
minority of her son, the present Stadtholder. She was the
eldest daughter of his Britannick Majesty, possessed of
many personal accomplishments and exemplary virtues,
pious, moderate, sensible, and circumspect. She had ex∣ercised
her authority with equal sagacity and resolution,
respected even by those who were no friends to the house
of Orange, and died with great fortitude and resignation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Feeling her end approaching, she delivered a key to one of her attend∣ants, directing him to fetch two papers, which she signed with her own hand. One was a contract of marriage between her daughter and the Prince of Nassau-Weilburg; the other was a letter to the States-General, bese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ching them to consent to this marriage, and preserve inviolate the regulations she had made, touching the education and tutelage of the young Stadtholder. These two papers being signed and sealed, she sent for her children, exhorted them to make proper improvements on the education they had received, and to live in harmony with each other. Then she implored heaven to shower its blessings on them both, and embraced them with the most affecting marks of maternal tenderness. She afterwards continued to converse calmly and de∣liberately with her friends, and in a few hours expired.</NOTE>
In her will she appointed the King her father, and the
Princess Dowager of Orange, her mother-in law, honorary
tutors, and Prince Louis of Brunswick acting tutor to her
children. In the morning after her decease, the States-General,
and the States of Holland were extraordinarily
assembled, and having received notice of the event, pro∣ceeded
to confirm the regulations which had been made
for the minority of the Stadtholder. Prince Louis of Bruns∣wick
was invited to assist in the assembly of Holland, where
he took the oaths, as representing the captain-general of the
union. Then he communicated to the assembly the act
by which the Princess had appointed him guardian of her
children. He was afterwards invited to the assembly of
<PB N="438" REF="442"/>
the States-General, who agreed to the resolution of Holland
with respect to his guardianship; and in the evening,
the different colleges of the government sent formal de∣putations
to the young Stadtholder, and the Princess Caro∣line,
his sister, in whose names and presence they were re∣ceived,
and answered by their guardian and representative.
A formal intimation of the death of the Princess was
communicated to the King her father, in a pathetick letter,
by the States-General, who condoled with him on the
irreparable loss which he as well as they had sustained by
this melancholy event, and assured him they would em∣ploy
all their care and attention in securing and defending
the rights and interests of the young Stadtholder, and the
Princess his sister, whom they considered as the children of
the republick. The royal family of England suffered
another disaster in the course of this year, by the decease
of the Princess Elisabeth-Caroline, second daughter of his
late Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales, a lady of
the most amiable character, who died at Kew in the month
of September, before she had attained the eighteenth year
of her age.</P>
<P>§ XXXI. Certain privateers continuing their excesses
at sea, and rifling neutral ships without distinction or au∣thority,
the government resolved to vindicate the honour
of the nation, by making examples of those pirates, who,
as fast as they could be detected and secured, were brought
to trial, and upon conviction sacrificed to justice. While
these steps were taken to rescue the nation from the re∣proach
of violence and rapacity, which her neighbours
had urged with such eagerness, equal spirit was exerted in
convincing neutral powers that they should not, with im∣punity,
contravene the law of nations, in favouring the
enemies of Great-Britain. A great number of causes were
tried, relating to disputed captures, and many Dutch
vessels, with their cargoes, were condemned after a fair
hearing, notwithstanding the loud clamours of that peo∣ple,
and the repeated remonstrances of the States-General.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="443"/>
§ XXXII. The reputation of the English was not so
much affected by the irregularities of her privateers, armed
for rapine, as by the neglect of internal police, and an in∣gredient
of savage ferocity mingled in the national cha∣racter;
an ingredient that appeared but too conspicuous
in the particulars of several shocking murthers brought to
light about this period.—One Halsey, who commanded a
merchant-ship in the voyage from Jamaica to England,
having conceived some personal dislike to a poor sailor,
insulted him with such abuse, exposed him to such hard∣ships,
and punished him with such wantonness of barbarity,
that the poor wretch leaped overboard in despair. His
inhuman tyrant envying him that death, which would
have rescued a miserable object from his brutality, plunged
into the sea after him, and brought him on board, de∣claring
he should not escape so while there were any tor∣ments
left to inflict. Accordingly, he exercised his ty∣ranny
upon him with redoubled vigour, until the poor
creature expired, in consequence of the inhuman treatment
he had sustained. This savage ruffian was likewise indicted
for the murther of another mariner, but being convicted on
the first trial, the second was found unnecessary, and the
criminal suffered death, according to the law, which is
perhaps too mild to malefactors convicted of such aggra∣vated
cruelty.—Another barbarous murther was perpe∣trated
in the country, near Birmingham, upon a sheriff's
officer, by the sons of one Darby, whose effects the bailiff
had seised, on a distress sor rent. The two young assassins,
encouraged by the father, attacked the unhappy wretch
with clubs, and mangled him in a terrible manner, so that
he hardly retained any signs of life. Not contented with
this cruel execution, they stripped him naked, and drag∣ging
him out of the house, scourged him with a wag∣goner's
whip, until the flesh was cut from his bones. In
this miserable condition he was found weltering in his
blood, and conveyed to a neighbouring house, where he
immediately expired. The three barbarians were appre∣hended,
after having made a desperate resistance. They
<PB N="440" REF="444"/>
were tried, convicted, and executed: the sons were hung
in chains, and the body of the father diffected.—The wi∣dow
of a timber-merchant at Rotherhithe being cruelly
murthered in her own house, Mary Edmonson, a young
woman, her niece, ran out into the street with her own
arms cut across, and gave the alarm, declaring her aunt had
been assassinated by four men, who forced their way into
the house, and that she (the niece) had received those
wounds, in attempting to defend her relation. According
to the circumstances that appeared, this unnatural wretch
had cut the throat of her aunt and benefactress with a
case-knife, then dragged the body from the wash-house
to the parlour; that she had stolen a watch and some silver
spoons, and concealed them, together with the knife and
her own apron, which was soaked with the blood of her
parent. After having acted this horrid tragedy, the bare
recital of which the humane reader will not peruse without
horrour, she put on another apron, and wounded her own
flesh, the better to conceal her guilt. Notwithstanding
these precautions she was suspected, and committed to pri∣son.
Being brought to trial, she was convicted and con∣demned,
upon circumstantial evidence, and finally executed
on Kennington-Common, though she denied the fact to
the last moment of her life. At the place of execution she
behaved with great composure, and, after having spent
some minutes in devotion, protested she was innocent
of the crime laid to her charge. What seemed to cor∣roborate
this protestation, was the condition and cha∣racter
of the young woman, who had been educated in a
sphere above the vulgar, and maintained a reputation
without reproach in the country, where she was actually
betrothed to a clergyman. On the other hand, the cir∣cumstances
that appeared against her almost amounted to a
certainty, though nothing weaker than proof positive ought
to determine a jury in capital cases to give a verdict against
the person accused. After all, this is one of those proble∣matick
events which clude the force of all evidence, and
serve to confound the pride of human reason.—A mis∣creant,
<PB N="441" REF="445"/>
whose name was Haines, having espoused the daugh∣ter
of a farmer in the neighbourhood of Gloucester, who
possessed a small estate, which he intended to divide among
seven children, was so abandoned as to form the design of
poisoning the whole family, that by virtue of his wife he
might enjoy the whole inheritance. For the execution of
this infernal scheme, he employed his own father to pur∣chase
a quantity of arsenick; part of which he administered
to three of the children, who were immediately seised
with the dreadful symptoms produced by this mineral,
and the eldest expired. He afterwards mixed it with three
apple-cakes, which he bought for the purpose, and pre∣sented
to the other three children, who underwent the
same violence of operation which had proved fatal to the
eldest brother. The instantaneous effects of the poison
created a suspicion of Haines, who being examined, the
whole scene of villainy stood disclosed. Nevertheless, the
villain found means to escape.—The uncommon spirit of
assassination which raged at this period seemed to com∣municate
itself even to foreigners who breathed English
air. Five French prisoners, confined on board the King's
ship the Royal Oak, were convicted of having murthered
one Jean de Manaux, their countryman and fellow pri∣soner,
in revenge for his having discovered that they had
forged passes to facilitate their escape. Exasperated at this
detection, they seised this unfortunate informer in the
place of their confinement, gagged his mouth, stripped
him naked, tied him with a strong cord to a ring bolt, and
scourged his body with the most brutal perseverance. By
dint of struggling the poor wretch disengaged himself from
the cord with which he had been tied: then they finished
the tragedy, by leaping and stamping on his breast, till the
chest was broke, and he expired. They afterwards severed
the body into small pieces, and these they conveyed at
different times into the sea, through the funnel of a con∣venience
to which they had access; but one of the other
prisoners gave information of the murther, in consequence
of which they were secured, brought to trial, condemned,
<PB N="442" REF="446"/>
and punished with death.—Nor were the instances of
cruel assassination which prevailed at this juncture confin∣ed
to Great-Britain. At the latter end of the foregoing
year, an atrocious massacre was perpetrated by two Ge∣noese
mariners upon the master and crew of an English
vessel, among whom they were enrolled. These monsters
of cruelty were in different watches, a circumstance that
favoured the execution of the horrid plan they had con∣certed.
When one of them retired to rest with his fellows
of the watch, consisting of the mate and two seamen, he
waited till they were fast asleep, and then butchered them
all with a knife. Having so far succeeded without dis∣covery,
he returned to the deck, and communicated the
exploit to his associate: then they suddenly attacked the
master of the vessel, and cleft his head with a hatchet,
which they likewise used in murthering the man that stood
at the helm; a third was likewise dispatched, and no
Englishman remained alive but the master's son, a boy,
who lamented his father's death with incessant tears and
cries for three days, at the expiration of which he was
likewise sacrificed, because the assassins were disturbed by
his clamour. This barbarous scene was acted within
sixty leagues of the rock of Lisbon; but the vessel was
taken between the capes Ortugal and Finisterre, by the
captain of a French privateer called La Favourite, who
seeing the deck stained with blood, and finding all the pa∣pers
of the ship destroyed, began to suspect that the master
and crew had been murthered. He accordingly taxed them
with the murther, and they confessed the particulars. The
privateer touched at Vigo, where the captain imparted
this detail to the English consul; but the prize, with the
two villains on board, was sent to Bayonne in France,
where they were brought to condign punishment.</P>
<P>§ XXXIII. We shall close this register of blood with
the account of a murther remarkable in all its circum∣stances,
for which a person, called Eugene Aram, suffered
at York, in the course of this year. This man, who ex∣ercised
the profession of a schoolmaster at Knaresborough,
<PB N="443" REF="447"/>
had, as far back as the year one thousand seven hundred
and forty-five, been concerned with one Houseman, in
robbing and murthering Daniel Clarke, whom they had
previously persuaded to borrow a considerable quantity of
valuable effects from different persons in the neighbourhood
on false pretences, that he might retire with the booty.
He had accordingly filled a sack with these particulars,
and began his retreat with his two perfidious associates,
who suddenly fell upon him, deprived him of life, and,
having buried the body in a cave, took possession of the
plunder. Though Clarke disappeared at once in such a
mysterious manner, no suspicion fell upon the assassins;
and Aram, who was the chief contriver and agent in the
murther, moved his habitation to another part of the
country. In the summer of the present year, Houseman
being employed, among other labourers, in repairing the
publick highway, they, in digging for gravel by the road
side, discovered the skeleton of a human creature, which
the majority supposed to be the bones of Daniel Clarke.
This opinion was no sooner broached, than Houseman,
as it were by some supernatural impulse which he could
not resist, declared that it was not the skeleton of Clarke,
inasmuch as his body had been interred in a place called
St. Robert's Cave, where they would find it, with the
head turned to a certain corner. He was immediately
apprehended, examined, admitted as evidence for the
crown, and discovered the particulars of the murther.
The skeleton of Clarke being found exactly in the place
and manner he had described, Eugene Aram, who now
acted as usher to a grammar-school in the county of
Norfolk, was secured, and brought to trial at the York
assises. There, his own wise corroborating the testimony
of Houseman, he was found guilty, and received sentence
of death, not withstanding a very artful and learned defence,
in which he proved, from argument and example, the
danger of convicting a man upon circumstantial evidence.
Finding all his remonstrances ineffectual, he recommended
himself in pathetick terms to the King's mercy; and if
<PB N="444" REF="448"/>
ever murther was entitled to indulgence, perhaps it might
have been extended, not improperly, to this man, whose
genius, in itself prodigious, might have exerted itself in
works of general utility. He had, in spite of all the dis∣advantages
attending low birth and straitened circum∣stances,
by the dint of his own capacity and inclination,
made considerable progress in mathematicks and philoso∣phy,
acquired all the languages ancient and modern, and
executed part of a Celtick dictionary, which, had he lived
to finish it, might have thrown some essential light upon
the origin and obscurities of the European History. Con∣vinced,
at last, that he had nothing to hope from the cle∣mency
of the government, he wrote a short poem in de∣fence
of suicide; and, on the day fixed for his execution,
opened the veins of his left arm with a razor, which he
had concealed for that purpose. Though he was much
weakened by the effusion of blood, before this attempt
was discovered; yet, as the instrument had missed the
artery, he did not expire until he was carried to the gibbet,
and underwent the sentence of the law. His body was
conveyed to Knaresborough-forest, and hung in chains,
near the place where the murther was perpetrated.
These are some of the most remarkable that appeared
among many other instances of homicide; a crime that
prevails to a degree alike deplorable and surprising, even
in a nation renowned for compassion and placability.
But this will generally be the case among people whose
passions, naturally impetuous, are ill restrained, by laws,
and the regulations of civil society, which the licentious
do not fear, and the wicked hope to evade.</P>
<P>§ XXXIV. The Prince of Wales having, in the be∣ginning
of June, entered the two-and-twentieth year of
his age, the anniversary of his birth was celebrated with
great rejoicings at court, and the King received com∣pliments
of congratulation on the majority of a prince,
who seemed born to fulfill the hopes and complete the
happiness of Great-Britain. The city of London pre∣sented
an address to the King on this occasion, replete
<PB N="445" REF="449"/>
with expressions of loyalty and affection, assuring his Ma∣jesty,
that no hostile threats could intimidate a people
animated by the love of liberty, who. confiding in the
Divine Providence, and in his Majesty's experienced
wisdom and vigorous councils, were resolved to exert
their utmost efforts towards enabling their sovereign to
repel the insults and defeat the attempts made by the an∣cient
enemies of his crown and kingdom. Congratu∣lations
of the same kind were offered by other cities,
towns, corporations, and communities, who vied with
each other in professions of attachment; and, indeed,
there was not the least trace of disaffection perceivable at
this juncture in any part of the island.</P>
<P>§ XXXV. So little were the citizens of London di∣stressed
by the expense, or incommoded by the operations
of the war, that they found leisure to plan, and funds to
execute magnificent works of art, for the ornament of the
metropolis, and the convenience of commerce. They
had obtained an act of parliament, empowering them to
build a new bridge over the Thames, from Black-friars
to the opposite shore, about midway between those of
London and Westminster. Commissioners were appointed
to put this act in execution; and, at a court of common-council,
it was resolved that a sum not exceeding one
hundred and forty-four thousand pounds should be forth∣with
raised, within the space of eight years, by install∣ments,
not exceeding thirty-thousand pounds in one year,
to be paid into the chamber of London; that the persons
advancing the money should have an interest at the rate
of four pounds per cent. per annum, to be paid half yearly
by the Chamberlain, yet redeemable at the expiration of
the first ten years; and that the Chamberlain should affix
the city's seal to such instruments as the committee might
think sit to give for securing the payment of the said
annuities. Such were the first effectual steps taken to∣wards
the execution of a laudable measure, which met
with the mostobstinate opposition in the sequel, from the
<PB N="446" REF="450"/>
narrow views of particular people, as well as from the
prejudice of party.</P>
<P>§ XXXVI. The spirit that now animated the citizens
of London was such as small difficulties did not retard,
and even considerable losses could not discourage. In the
month of November the city was exposed to a dangerous
conflagration, kindled in the night by accident in the
neighbourhood of the Royal-Exchange, which burned
with great fury, notwithstanding the assistance of the fire∣men
and engines employed under the personal direction
of the magistracy, consumed a good number of houses, and
damaged many more. That whole quarter of the town
was filled with consternation: some individuals were beg∣gared;
one or two perished in the flames, and some were
buried in the ruins of the houses that sunk under the dis∣aster.</P>
<P>§ XXXVII. The serment of mind so peculiar to the
natives of Great-Britain, excited by a strange mixture of
genius and caprice, passion and philosophy, study and
conjecture, pruduced at this period some flowers of im∣provement,
in different arts and sciences, that seemed to
promise fruit of publick utility. Several persons invented
methods for discovering the longitude at sea, that great
<HI>desideratum</HI> in navigation, for the ascertainment of which
so many nations have offered a publick recompense, and
in the investigation of which so many mathematical heads
have been disordered. Some of those who now appeared
candidates for the prize deserved encouragement for the
ingenuity of their several systems; but he who seemed to
enjoy the pre-eminence in the opinion and favour of the
publick, was Mr. Irwin, a native of Ireland, who con∣trived
a chair so artfully poised, that a person sitting in it
on board a ship, even in a rough sea, can, through a
telescope, observe the immersion and emersion of Jupi∣ter's
satellites, without being interrupted or incommoded
by the motion of the vessel. This gentleman was favour∣ed
with the assistance and protection of Commodore Lord
Howe, in whose presence the experiment was tried in
<PB N="447" REF="451"/>
several ships at sea with such success, that he granted a
certificate, signifying his approbation; and in consequence
of this, Mr. Irwin is said to have obtained a considerable
reward from the board of Admiralty.</P>
<P>§ XXXVIII. The people of England, happy in their
situation, felt none of the storms of war and desolation
which ravaged the neighbouring countries; but, enriched
by a surprising augmentation of commerce, enjoyed all the
security of peace, and all the pleasures of taste, and afflu∣ence.
The university of Oxford having conferred the
office of their chancellor, vacant by the death of the Earl
of Arran, upon another nobleman of equal honour and
integrity, namely, the Earl of Westmorland, he made a
publick entrance into that celebrated seat of learning with
great magnificence, and was installed amidst the Encaenia,
which were celebrated with such classical elegance of pomp,
as might have rivalled the chief Roman festival of the
Augustan age. The chancellor elect was attended by a
splendid train of the nobility and persons of distinction.
The city of Oxford was filled with a vast concourse of
strangers. The processions were contrived with taste,
and conducted with decorum. The installation was per∣formed
with the most striking solemnity. The congratu∣latory
verses, and publick speeches, breathed the spirit
of old Rome; and the ceremony was closed by Dr. King,
that venerable sage of St. Mary Hall, who pronounced an
oration in praise of the new chancellor with all the flow of
Tully, animated by the fire of Demosthenes.</P>
<P>§ XXXIX. We shall conclude the remarkable incidents
of this year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the spring of this year the liberal arts sustained a lamentable loss in the death of George Frederick Handel, the most celebrated master in musick which this age had produced. He was by birth a German; but had studied in Italy, and afterwards settled in England, where he met with the most favourable reception, and resided above half a century, universally admired for his stupendous genius in the sublime parts of musical composition.</P>
<P>One would be apt to imagine that there was something in the constitution of the air at this period, which was particularly unfavourable to old age, inasmuch as, in the compass of a few months, the following persons, remark∣able for their longevity, died in the kingdom of Scotland: William Barnes, who had been above seventy years a servant in the family of Brodie, died there, at the age of one hundred and nine. Catharine Mackenzie died in Ross-shire, at the age of one hundred and eighteen. Janet Blair, deceased at Monemusk, in the shire of Aberdeen, turned of one hundred and twelve. Alexander Stephens, in Bamsfshire, at the age of one hundred and eight. Janet Harper, at Bains-hole, at the age of one hundred and seven. Daniel Cameron, in Rannach, married when he was turned of one hundred, and survived his marriage thirty years.</P></NOTE>, that are detached from the prosecution of
<PB N="448" REF="452"/>
the war, with the detail of an event equally surprising
and deplorable:—A sloop called the dolphin, bound from
the Canaries to New-York, met with such unsavourable
weather, that she was detained onehundred and sixty-five
days in the passage, and the provision of the ship was al∣together
expended before the first fifty days were elapsed.
The wretched crew had devoured their dog, cat, and all
their shoes on board: at length, being reduced to the ut∣mosst
extremity, they agreed to cast lots for their lives,
that the body of him upon whom the lot should fall
might servefor some time to sport the survivors. The
wretched victim was one Antonio Galatia, a Spanish
gentleman and passenger. Him they shot with a musquet;
and having cut off his head, threw it overboard; but the
entrails, and the rest of the carcase, they greedily devour∣ed.
This horrid banquet having, as it were, fleshed the
famished crew, they began to talk of another sacrifice,
from which, however, they were diverted by the influ∣ence
and remonstrances of their captain, who prevailed
upon them to be satisfied with a miserable allowance to
each per diem, cut from a pair of leather breeches found
in the cabbin. Upon this calamitous pittance, re-en∣forced
with the grass which grew plentifully upon the
deck, these poor objects made shift to subfitst for twenty
days, at the expiration of which they were relieved, and
taken on board one Captain Bradshaw, who chanced to
fall in which them at sea. By this time the whole crew,
consisting of seven men, were so squalid and emaciated,
as to exhibit an appearance at once piteous and terrible;
and so reduced in point of strength, that it was found
necessary to sse ropes and tackle for hoisting them from
<PB N="449" REF="453"/>
one ship to the other. The circumstance of the lot
falling upon the Spaniard, who was the only foreigner on
board, encourages a suspicion that foul play was offered to
this unfortunate stranger; but the most remarkable part of
this whole incident is, that the master and crew could not
contrive some sort of tackle to catch fish, with which the
sea every where abounds, and which, no doubt, might
be caught with the help of a little ingenuity. If im∣plements
of this kind were provided in every ship, they
would probably prevent all those tragical events at sea
that are occasioned by famine.</P>
<P>§ XL. Previous to the more capital operations in war, we
shall particularise the most remarkable captures that were
made upon the enemy by single ships of war, during the
course of this summer and autumn. In the month of
February a French privateer belonging to Granville,
called the Marquis de Marigny, having on board near
two hundred men, and mounted with twenty cannon, was
taken by Captain Parker, commander of his Majesty's
ship the Montague; who likewise made prize of a smaller
armed vessel, from Dunkirk, of eight cannon and sixty
men. About the same period, Captain Graves, of the
Unicorn, brought in the Moras privateer of St. Maloes,
carrying two hundred men, and two-and-twenty cannon.
Two large merchant-ships, loaded on the French King's
account for Martinique, with provision, clothing, and
arms, for the troops on that island, were taken by Cap∣tain
Lendrick, commander of the Brilliant; and an Eng∣lish
transport from St. John's, having four hundred
French prisoners on board, perished near the Western
Islands. Within the circle of the same month, a large
French ship from St. Domingo, richly laden, fell in with
the Favourite ship of war, and was carried into Gib∣raltar.</P>
<P>§ XLI. In the month of February, Captain Hood, of
his Majesty's frigate of Vestal, belonging to a small
squadron commanded by Admiral Holmes, who had sailed
for the West-Indies in January, being advance a con∣siderable
<PB N="450" REF="454"/>
way a-head of the fleet, descried and gave chase
to a sail, which proved to be a French frigate called the
Bellona, of two hundred and twenty men, and two-and-thirty
great guns, commanded by the Count de Beauho∣noire.
Captain Hood, having made a signal to the Ad∣miral,
continued the chase until he advanced within half
musquet-shot of the enemy, and then poured in a broad∣side,
which was immediately retorted. The engagement
thus begun was maintained with great vigour on both
sides for the space of four hours; at the expiration of
which the Bellona struck, after having lost all her masts
and rigging, together with about forty men killed in the
action. Nor was the victor in a much better condition.
Thirty men were killed and wounded on board the Vestal.
Immediately after the enemy submitted, all her rigging
being destroyed by the shot, the topmasts fell overboard;
and she was otherwise so damaged, that she could not pro∣ceed
on her voyage. Captain Hood, therefore, returned
with his prize to Spithead; and afterwards met with a
gracious reception from his Majesty, on account of the
valour and conduct he had displayed on this occasion.
The Bellona had sailed in January from the island of
Martinique, along with the Florissant, and another French
frigate, from which she had been separated in the passage.
Immediately after this exploit, Captain Elliot, of the
Aeolus frigate, accompanied by the Isis, made prize of a
French ship, the Mignonne, of twenty guns, and one hun∣dred
and forty men, one of four frigates employed as con∣voy
to a large fleet of merchant-ships, near the island of
Rhée.</P>
<P>§ XLII. In the month of March, the English frigates
the Southampton and Melampe, commanded by the Cap∣tains
Gilchrist and Hotham, being at sea to the northward
on a cruife, fell in with the Danaë, a French ship of forty
cannon, and three hundred and thirty men, which was
engaged by Captain Hotham in a ship of half the force,
who maintained the battle a considerable time with admira∣ble
gallantry, before his consort could come to his assistance.
As they sought in the dark, Captain Gilchrist was obliged
<PB N="451" REF="455"/>
to lie by for some time, because he could not distinguish
the one from the other; but no sooner did the day appear
than he bore down upon the Danaë with his usual impe∣tuosity,
and soon compelled her to surrender: she did not
strike, however, until thirty or forty of her men were
stain: and the gallant Captain Gilchrist received a grape∣shot
in his shoulder, which, though it did not deprive him
of life, yet rendered him incapable of future service: a
misfortune the more to be lamented, as it happened to a
brave officer in the vigour of his age, and in the midst of
a sanguinary war, which might have afforded him many
other opportunities of signalizing his courage for the
honour and advantage of his country. Another remark∣able
exploit was atchieved about the same juncture by
Captain Barrington, commander of the ship Achilles,
mounted with sixty cannon, who, to the westward of
Cape Finistere, encountered a French ship of equal force,
called the Count de St. Florentin, bound from Cape
Francois on the island of Hispaniola to Rochefort, under
the command of the Sieur de Montay, who was obliged to
strike, after a close and obstinate engagement, in which he
himself was mortally wounded, a great number of his men
slain, and his ship so damaged, that she was with diffi∣culty
brought into Falmouth. Captain Barrington ob∣tained
the victory at the expense of about five-and-twenty
men killed and wounded, and all his rigging, which the
enemy's shot rendered useless. Two small privateers from
Dunkirk were also taken, one called the Marquis de Bareil,
by the Brilliant, which carried her into Kinsale in Ireland;
the other called the Carilloneur, which struck to the Grace
cutter, assisted by the boats of the ship Rochester, com∣manded
by Captain Duff, who sent her into the Downs.</P>
<P>§ XLIII. About the latter end of March, Captain
Samuel Falkner, in the ship Windsor, of sixty guns,
cruising to the westward, discovered four large ships to
leeward, which, when he approached them, formed the
line of battle a-head, in order to give him a warm re∣ception.
He accordingly closed with the sternmost ship,
<PB N="452" REF="456"/>
which sustained his fire about an hour: then the other
three bearing away with all the sail they could carry, she
struck her colours, and was conducted to Lisbon. She
proved to be the Duc de Chartres, pierced for sixty cannon,
though at that time carrying no more than four-and-twenty,
with a complement of three hundred men, about
thirty of whom were killed in the action. She belonged,
with the other three that escaped, to the French East-India
company, was loaded with gunpowder and naval
stores, and bound for Pondicherry. Two privateers,
called La Chasseur and Le Conquerant, the one from
Dunkirk, and the other from Cherbourg, were taken and
caaried into Plymouth by Captain Hughes, of his Majesty's
frigate the Tamer. A third, called the Despatch, from
Morlaix, was brought into Penzance by the Diligence
sloop, under the command of Captain Eastwood. A
fourth, called the Basque, from Bayonne, furnished with
two-and-twenty guns, and above two hundred men, fell
into the hands of Captain Parker, of the Brilliant, who
conveyed her into Plymouth. Captain Antrobus, of the
Surprise, took the Vieux, a privateer of Bourdeaux:
and a fifth, from Dunkirk, struck to Captain Knight, of
the Liverpool, off Yarmouth. In the month of May a
French frigate, called the Arethusa, mounted with two-and-thirty
cannon, manned with a large complement of
hands, under the command of the Marquis de Vaudri∣eul,
submitted to two British frigates, the Venus and the
Thames, commanded by the Captains Harrison and Colby,
after a warm engagement, in which sixty men were killed
and wounded on the side of the enemy. In the begin∣ning
of June an armed ship, belonging to Dunkirk, was
brought into the Downs, by Captain Angel, of the Stag;
and a privateer of force, called the Countefs de la Serre,
was subdued and taken, after an obstinate action, by Cap∣tain
Moore, of his Majesty's ship the Adventure.</P>
<P>§ XLIV. Several armed ships of the enemy, and rich
prizes, were taken in the West-Indies, particularly two
French frigates, and two Dutch ships with French com∣modities,
<PB N="453" REF="457"/>
all richly laden, by some of the ships of the
squadron which Vice-Admiral Cotes commanded on the
Jamaica station. A fifth, called the Velour, from St.
Domingo, with a valuable cargo on board, being fortified
with twenty cannon, and above one hundred men, fell in
with the Favourite sloop of war, under the command of
Captain Edwards, who, after an obstinate dispute, carried
her in triumph to Gibraltar. At St. Christopher's, in
the West-Indies, Captain Collingwood, commander of
the king's ship the Crescent, attacked two French frigates,
the Amethyste and Berkeley; the former of which escaped,
after a warm engagement, in which the Crescent's rigging
was so much damaged, that she could not pursue: but the
other was taken, and conveyed into the harbour of Basse∣terre.
Notwithstanding the vigilance and courage of the
English cruisers in those seas, the French privateers
swarmed to such a degree, that in the course of this year
they took above two hundred sail of British ships, valued
at six hundred thousand pounds sterling. This their
success is the more remarkable, as by this time the island
of Guadaloupe was in possession of the English, and Com∣modore
Moore commanded a numerous squadron in
those very latitudes.</P>
<P>§ XLV. In the beginning of October, the Hercules
ship of war, mounted with seventy-four guns, under the
command of Captain Porter, cruising in the chops of the
Channel, descried to windward a large ship, which proved
to be the Florissant, of the same force with the Hercules.
Her commander, perceiving the English ship giving chase,
did not seem to decline the action; but bore down upon
her in a slanting direction, and the engagement began
with great fury. In a little time, the Hercules having
lost her top-mast, and all her rigging being shot away,
the enemy took advantage of this disaster, made the best
of his way, and was pursued till eight o'clock next morn∣ing,
when the escaped behind the isle of Oleron. Captain
Porter was wounded in the head with a grape-shot, and
lost the use of one leg in the engagement.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="458"/>
§ XLVI. Having taken notice of all the remarkable
captures and exploits that were made and atchieved by
single ships since the commencement of the present year,
we shall now proceed to describe the actions that were
performed in this period by the different squadrons that
constituted the naval power of Great-Britain. Intelli∣gence
having been received that the enemy meditated an
invasion upon some of the British territories, and that a
number of flat-bottomed boats were prepared at Havre-de-Grace,
for the purpose of disembarking troops, Rear-Admiral
Rodney was, in the beginning of July, detached
with a small squadron of ships and bombs to annoy and
overawe that part of the coast of France. He accordingly
anchored in the road of Havre, and made a disposition to
execute the instructions he had received. The bomb
vessels being placed in the narrow channel of the river
leading to Honfleur, began to throw their shells, and
continued the bombardment for two-and-fifty hours,
without intermission, during which a numerous body of
French troops was employed in throwing up entrench∣ments,
erecting new batteries, and firing both with shot
and shells upon the assailants. The town was set on fire
in several places, and burned with great fury; some of
the boats were overturned, and a few of them reduced to
ashes, while the inhabitants forsook the place in the ut∣most
consternation: nevertheless, the damage done to the
enemy was too inconsiderable to make amends for the
expense of the armament, and the loss of nineteen hun∣dred
shells and eleven hundred carcasses, which were ex∣pended
in this expedition. Bombardments of this kind
are at best but expensive and unprofitable operations,
and may be deemed a barbarous method of prosecuting
war, inasmuch as the damage falls upon the wretched in∣habitants,
who have given no cause of offence, and who
are generally spared by an humane enemy, unless they
have committed some particular act of provocation.</P>
<P>§ XLVII. The honour of the British flag was much
more effectually asserted by the gallant Admiral Boscawen.
<PB N="455" REF="459"/>
who, as we have already observed, was entrusted with the
conduct of a squadron in the Mediterranean. It must be
owned, however, that his first attempt favoured of temerity.
Having in vain displayed the British flag in sight of Tou∣lon,
by way of defiance to the French fleet that lay there
at anchor, he ordered three ships of the line, commanded
by the Captains Smith, Harland, and Barker, to advance
and burn two ships that lay close to the mouth of the
harbour. They accordingly approached with great intre∣pidity,
and met with a very warm reception from divers
batteries which they had not before perceived. Two
small forts they attempted to destroy, and cannonaded for
some time with great fury; but being over-matched by
superior force, and the wind subsiding into a calm, they
sustained considerable damage, and were towed off with
great difficulty, in a very shattered condition. The Ad∣miral
seeing three of his best ships so roughly handled in
this enterprise, returned to Gibraltar in order to refit; and
M. de la Clue, the French commander of the squadron at
Toulon, seised this opportunity of sailing, in hopes of
passing the Straits mouth unobserved, his fleet consisting
of twelve large ships, and three frigates. Admiral Bos∣cawen,
who commanded fourteen sail of the line, with
two frigates, and as many fire-ships, having refitted his
squadron, detached one frigate to cruise off Malaga, and
another to hover between Estepona and Ceuta-point;
with a view to keep a good look-out, and give timely no∣tice
in case the enemy should approach. On the seven∣teenth
day of August, at eight in the evening, the Gibral∣tar
frigate made a signal that fourteen sail appeared on the
Barbary shore, to the eastward of Ceuta; upon which the
English admiral immediately heaved up his anchors and
went to sea: at day-light he descried seven large ships
lying to; but when the English squadron forebore to an∣swer
their signal, they discovered their mistake, set all their
sails, and made the best of their way. This was the
greater part of the French squadron commanded by M. de
la Clue, from whom five of his large ships and three fri∣gates
<PB N="456" REF="460"/>
gates had separated in the night. Even now, perhaps, he
might have escaped, had he not been obliged to wait for
the Souveraine, which was a heavy sailer. At noon the
wind, which had blown a fresh gale, died away, and al∣though
Admiral Boscawen had made signal to chase, and
engage in a line of battle a-head, it was not till half an
hour after two that some of his headmost ships could close
with the rere of the enemy; which, though greatly out-numbered,
fought with uncommon bravery. The Eng∣lish
admiral, without waiting to return the fire of the
sternmost, which he received as he passed, used all his en∣deavours
to come up with the Ocean, which M. de la
Clue commanded in person; and about four o'clock in
the afternoon running athwart her hawse, poured into her
a furious broadside: thus the engagement began with
equal vigour on both sides. This dispute, however, was of
short duration. In about half an hour Admiral Bos∣cawen's
mizen-mast and topsail yards were shot away;
and the enemy hoisted all the sail they could carry. Mr.
Boscawen having shifted his flag from the Namur to the
Newark, joined some other ships in attacking the Centaur,
of seventy-four guns, which, being thus overpowered,
was obliged to surrender. The British admiral pursued
them all night, during which the Souveraine, and the
Guerrier, altered their course, and deserted their command∣er.
At day-break, M. de la Clue, whose left leg had
been broke in the engagement, perceiving the English
squadron crowding all their sails to come up with him,
and finding himself on the coast of Portugal, determined to
burn his ships, rather than they should fall into the hands
of the victors. The Ocean was run ashore two leagues
from Lagos, near the fort of Almadana, the commander
of which fired three shot at the English; another cap∣tain
of the French squadron followed the example of his
commander, and both endeavoured to disembark their men;
but the sea being rough, this proved a very tedious and
difficult attempt. The captains of the Temeraire and
Modeste, instead of destroying their ships, anchored as
<PB N="457" REF="461"/>
near as they could to the forts Xavier and Lagres, in hopes
of enjoying their protection; but in this hope they were
disappointed. M. de la Clue had been landed, and the
command of the Ocean was left to the Count de Carne,
who, having received one broadside from the America,
struck his colours, and the English took possession of
this noble prize, the best ship in the French navy, mount∣ed
with eighty cannon. Captain Bently, of the War∣spight,
who had remarkably signalifed himself by his courage
during the action of the preceding day, attacked the Te∣meraire,
of seventy-four guns, and brought her off with
little damage. Vice-Admiral Broderick, the second in
command, advancing with his division, burned the Re∣doubtable,
of seventy-four guns, which was bulged, and
abandoned by her men and officers; but they made prize
of the Modeste, carrying sixty-four guns, which had not
been much injured in the engagement. This victory was
obtained by the English admiral at a very small expense of
men; the whole number of the killed and wounded not
exceeding two hundred and fifty on board of the British
squadron, though the carnage among the enemy must
have been much more considerable, as M. de la Clue, in
his letter to the French ambassador at Lisbon, owned that
on board of his own ship, the Ocean, one hundred men
were killed on the spot, and seventy dangerously wounded:
but the most severe circumstance of this disaster was the
loss of four capital ships, two of which were destroyed,
and the other two brought in triumph to England, to be
numbered among the best bottoms of the British navy.
What augmented the good fortune of the victors, was,
that not one officer lost his life in the engagement.
Captain Bently, whom the Admiral dispatched to Eng∣land
with the tidings of his success, met with a gracious
reception from the King, who knighted him for his
gallantry.</P>
<P>XLVIII. As we propose to throw together all the naval
transactions of the year, especially those that happened in
the European seas, that they may be comprehended as it
<PB N="458" REF="462"/>
were in one view, we must now, without regarding the
order of time, postpone many previous events of import∣ance,
and record the last action by sea that in the course
of this year distinguished the flag of Great-Britain. The
court of Versailles, in order to embarrass the British
ministry, and divert their attention from all external
expeditions, had in the winter projected a plan for invad∣ing
some part of the British dominions; and in the begin∣ning
of the year had actually begun to make preparations
on different parts of their coast for carrying this design into
execution. Even as far back as the latter end of May,
messages from the King to both Houses of parliament were
delivered by the Earl of Holdernesse and Mr. Pitt, the two
secretaries of state, signifying that his Majesty had re∣ceived
advices of preparations making by the French
court, with a design to invade Great-Britain: that though
persuaded, by the universal zeal and affection of his people,
any such attempt must, under the blessing of God, end in
the destruction of those who engaged in it; yet he ap∣prehended
he should not act consistent with that paternal
care and concern which he had always shewn for the safety
and preservation of his subjects, if he omitted any means
in his power which might be necessary for their defence:
he, therefore, acquainted the parliament with his having
received repeated intelligence of the enemy's preparations,
to the end that his Majesty might, if he should think pro∣per,
in pursuance of the late act of parliament, cause the
militia, or such part thereof as should be necessary, to be
drawn out and embodied, in order to march as occasion
should require. These messages were no sooner read,
than each House separately resolved to present an address,
thanking his Majesty for having communicated this in∣telligence;
assuring him that they would, with their lives
and fortunes, support him against all attempts whatever:
that, warmed with affection and zeal for his person and
government, and animated by indignation at the daring
designs of an enemy whose fleet had hitherto shunned the
terrour of the British navy, they would chearfully exert
<PB N="459" REF="463"/>
their utmost efforts to repel all insults, and effectually en∣able
their sovereign, not only to disappoint the attempts of
France, but, by the blessing of God, turn them to their
own confusion. The Commons at the same time resolved
upon another address, desiring his Majesty would give di∣rections
to his lieutenants of the several counties, ridings,
and places within South-Britain, to use their utmost dili∣gence
and attention in executing the several acts of par∣liament
made for the better ordering the militia.</P>
<P>§ XLIX. These and other precautionary steps were
accordingly taken; but the administration wisely placed
their chief dependence upon the strength of the navy, part
of which was so divided and stationed, as to block up all
the harbours of France in which the enemy were known
to make any naval armament of consequence. We have
seen in what manner Rear-Admiral Rodney visited the
town and harbour of Havre-de-Grace, and scoured that
part of the coastin successive cruises: we have also recorded
the expedition and victory of Admiral Boscawen over the
squadron of La Clue, which was equipped at Toulon,
with a design to assist in the projected invasion. Notwith∣standing
this disaster, the French ministry persisted in their
design; towards the execution of which they had pre∣pared
another considerable fleet, in the harbours of Roche∣fort,
Brest, and Port-Louis, to be commanded by M. de
Conflans, and re-enforced by a considerable body of troops,
which were actually assembled under the Duc d'Aiguillon,
at Vannes, in Lower Bretagne. Flat-bottomed boats and
transports to be used in this expedition were prepared in
different ports on the coast of France; and a small squa∣dron
was equipped at Dunkirk, under the command of an
enterprising adventurer, called Thurot, who had, in the
course of the preceding year, signalised his courage and
conduct in a large privateer called the Belleisle, which had
scoured the North Seas, taken a number of ships, and at
one time maintained an obstinate battle against two Eng∣lish
frigates, which were obliged to desist, after having re∣ceived
considerable damage. This man's name became a
<PB N="460" REF="464"/>
terrour to the merchants of Great-Britain; for his va∣lour
was not more remarkable in battle than his conduct
in eluding the pursuit of the British cruisers, who were
successively detached in quest of him, through every part
of the German Ocean and North sea, as far as the island
of Orkneys. It must be likewise owned, for the honour
of human nature, that this bold mariner, though destitute
of the advantages of birth and education, was remarkably
distinguished by his generosity and compassion to those who
had the misfortune to fall into his power; and that his
deportment in every respect entitled him to a much more
honourable rank in the service of his country. The court
of Versailles were not insensible to his merit. He obtain∣ed
a commission from the French King, and was vested
with the command of the small armament now fitting out
in the harbour of Dunkirk. The British government
being apprised of all these particulars, took such measures
to defeat the purposed invasion as must have conveyed a
very high idea of the power of Great-Britain to those who
considered, that, exclusive of the force opposed to this
design, they at the same time carried on the most vigorous
and important operations of war in Germany, America,
the East and West-Indies. Thurot's armament at Dun∣kirk
was watched by an English squadron in the Downs,
commanded by Commodore Boys; the port of Havre was
guarded by Rear-Admiral Rodney; Mr. Boscawen had
been stationed off Toulon, and the coast of Vannes was
scoured by a small squadron detached from Sir Edward
Hawke, who had during the summer blocked up the har∣bour
of Brest, where Conflans lay with his fleet, in order
to be joined by the other divisions of the armament.
These different squadrons of the British navy were con∣nected
by a chain of separate cruisers; so that the whole
coast of France, from Dunkirk to the extremity of Bre∣tagne,
was distressed by an actual blockade.</P>
<P>§ L. The French ministry being thus hampered, forbore
their attempt upon Britain; and the projected invasion
seemed to hang in suspense till the month of August, in
<PB N="461" REF="465"/>
the beginning of which their army in Germany was de∣feated
at Minden. Their designs in that country being
baffled by this disaster, they seemed to convert their chief
attention to their sea-armament; the preparations were
resumed with redoubled vigour; and even after the defeat
of La Clue, they resolved to try their fortune in a descent.
They now proposed to disembark a body of troops in Ire∣land.
Thurot received orders to sail from Dunkirk with
the first opportunity, and shape his course round the nor∣thern
parts of Scotland, that he might alarm the coast of
Ireland, and make a diversion from that part where Con∣flans
intended to effectuate the disembarkation of his forces.
The transports and ships of war were assembled at Brest
and Rochefort, having on board a train of artillery, with
saddles, and other accoutrements for cavalry, to be mount∣ed
in Ireland; and a body of French troops, including
part of the Irish brigade, was kept in readiness to embark.
The execution of this scheme was, however, prevented by
the vigilance of Sir Edward Hawke, who blocked up the
harbour of Brest with a fleet of twenty-three capital ships;
while another squadron of smaller ships and frigates, under
the command of Captain Duff, continued to cruise along
the French coast, from Port L'Orient, in Bretagne, to the
point of St. Gilles in Poitou. At length, however, in the
beginning of November, the British squadron, command∣ed
by Sir Edward Hawke, Sir Charles hardy, and Rear-Admiral
Geary, were driven from the coast of France by
stress of weather, and on the ninth day of the month
anchored in Torbay. The French admiral, Conflans,
snatched this opportunity of failing from Brest, with one-and-twenty
sail of the line and four frigates, in hopes of
being able to destroy the English squadron commanded by
Captain Duff, before the larger fleet could return from the
coast of England. Sir Edward Hawke having received in∣telligence
that the French fleet had failed from Brest, im∣mediately
stood to sea, in order to pursue them; and in
the mean time, the government issued orders for guarding
all those parts of the coast that were thought the mostex∣posed
<PB N="462" REF="466"/>
to a descent. The land-forces were put in motion,
and quartered along the shore of Kent and Suffex: all the
ships of war in the different harbours, even those that had
just arrived from America, were ordered to put to sea,
and every step was taken to disconcert the designs of the
enemy.</P>
<P>§ LI. While these measures were taken with equal
vigour and deliberation, Sir Edward Hawke steered his
course directly for Quiberon, on the coast of Bretagne,
which he supposed would be the rendezvous of the French
squadron; but, notwithstanding his utmost efforts, he was
driven by a hard gale considerably to the westward, where
he was joined by two frigates, the Maidstone and Coven∣try.
These he directed to keep a-head of the squadron.
The weather growing more moderate, the former made
the signal for seeing a fleet, on the twentieth day of No∣vember,
at half an hour past eight o'clock in the morn∣ing,
and in an hour afterwards discovered them to be the
enemy's squadron. They were at that time in chase of
Captain Duff's squadron, which now joined the large
fleet, after having run some risque of being taken. Sir
Edward Hawke, who, when the Maidstone gave the first
notice, had formed the line a-breast, now perceiving that
the French admiral endeavoured to escape with all the fail
he could carry, threw out a signal for seven of his ships
that were nearest the enemy to chase, and endeavour to
detain them, until they could be re-enforced by the rest
of the squadron, which were ordered to form into a
line of battle a-head, as they chased, that no time
might be lost in the pursuit. Considering the roughness of
the weather, which was extremely tempestuous; the nature
of the coast, which is in this place rendered very hazard∣ous
by a great number of sand-banks, shoals, rocks, and
islands, as entirely unknown to the British sailors, as they
were familiar to the French navigators; the dangers of a
short day, dark night, and lee-shore; it required extra∣ordinary
resolution in the English admiral to attempt ho∣stilities
on this occasion: but Sir Edward Hawke, steeled
<PB N="463" REF="467"/>
with the integrity and fortitude of his own heart, animated
by a warm love for his country, and well acquainted with
the importance of the stake on which the safety of that
country in a great measure depended, was resolved to run
extraordinary risques in his endeavours to frustrate at once
a boasted scheme projected for the annoyance of his fellow-subjects.
With regard to his ships of the line, he had
but the advantage of one in point of number, and no supe∣riority
in men or metal, consequently, M. de Conflans
might have hazarded a fair battle on the open sea, without
any imputation of temerity: but he thought proper to play
a more artful game, though it did not succeed according
to his expectation. He kept his fleet in a body, and re∣tired
close in shore, with a view to draw the English squa∣dron
among the shoals and islands, on which he hoped they
would pay dear for their rashness and impetuosity, while he
and his officers, who were perfectly acquainted with the
navigation, could either stay, and take advantage of the
disaster, or, if hard pressed, retire through channels un∣known
to the British pilots. At half an hour after two,
the van of the English fleet began the engagement with
the rear of the enemy, in the neighbourhood of Belleisle.
Every ship as she advanced poured in a broadside on the
sternmost of the French, and bore down upon their van,
leaving the rear to those that came after. Sir Edward
Hawke, in the Royal George, of one hundred and ten
guns, reserved his fire in passing through the rear of the
enemy, and ordered his master to bring him along-side of
the French admiral, who commanded in person on board
the Soleil Royal, a ship mounted with eighty cannon,
and provided with a comlement of twelve hundred men.
When the pilot remonstrated that he could not obey his
command, without the most imminent risque of running
upon a shoal, the brave veteran replied, “You have done
your duty in showing the danger; now you are to com∣ply
with my order, and lay me along-side the Soleil
Royal.” His wish was gratified: the Royal George
ranged up with the French admiral. The Thesée, an∣other
<PB N="464" REF="468"/>
large ship of the enemy, running up between the two
commanders, sustained the fire that was reserved for the
Soleil Royal; but in returning the first broad side foundered,
in consequence of the high sea that entered her lower deck∣ports,
and filled her with water. Notwithstanding the
boisterous weather, a great number of ships on both sides
fought with equal fury and dubious success, till about four
in the afternoon, when the Formidable struck her colours.
The Superbe shared the fate of the Thesée going to the
bottom. The Hero hauled down her colours in token
of submission, and dropped anchor; but the wind was so
high, that no boat could be sent to take possession. By
this time day-light began to fail, and the greater part of the
French fleet escaped under cover of the darkness. Night
approaching, the wind blowing with augmented violence
on a lee-shore, and the British squadron being entangled
among unknown shoals and islands, Sir Edward Hawke
made the signal for anchoring to the westward of the small
island Dumet; and here the fleet remained all night in a
very dangerous riding, alarmed by the fury of the storm,
and the incessant firing of guns of distress, without their
knowing whether it proceeded from friend or enemy.
The Soleil Royal had, under favour of the night, anchor∣ed
also in the midst of the British squadron; but at day-break
M. de Conflans ordered her cable to be cut, and she
drove a-shore to the westward of Crozie. The English
admiral immediately made signal to the Essex to slip cable,
and pursue her; and, in obeying this order, she ran un∣fortunately
on a sand-bank called Lefour, where the Re∣solution,
another ship of the British squadron, was already
grounded. Here they were both irrecoverably lost, in spite
of all the assistance that could be given: but all their men,
and part of their stores, were saved, and the wrecks set on
fire by order of the admiral. He likewise detached the
Portland, Chatham, and Vengeance to destroy the Soleil
Royal, which was burned by her own people, before the
English ships could approach; but they arrived time
enough to reduce the Hero to ashes on the Lefour, where
<PB N="465" REF="469"/>
she had been also stranded; and the Juste, another of their
great ships, perished in the mouth of the Loire. The Ad∣miral,
perceiving seven large ships of the enemy riding at
anchor between Point Penvas and the mouth of the river
Vilaine, made the signal to weigh, in order to attack them,
but the fury of the storm increased to such a degree, that
he was obliged to remain at anchor, and even order the
top-gallant-masts to be struck. In the mean time, the
French ships being lightened of their cannon, their officers
took advantage of the flood, and a more moderate gale
under the land, to enter the Vilaine, where they lay within
half a mile of the entrance, protected by some occasional
batteries erected on the shore, and by two large frigates
moored across the mouth of the harbour. Thus they
were effectually secured from any attempts of small vessels;
and as for large ships, there was not water sufficient to
float them within fighting distance of the enemy. On
the whole, this battle, in which a very inconsiderable num∣ber
of lives was lost, may be consdered as one of the most
perilous and important actions that ever happened in any
war between the two nations; for it not only defeated the
projected invasion, which had hung menacing so long
over the apprehensions of Great-Britain; but it gave the
finishing blow to the naval power of France, which was
totally disabled from undertaking any thing of conse∣quence
in the sequel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During this war, the English had already taken and destroyed twenty-seven French ships of the line, and thirty-one frigates: two of their great ships and four frigates perished; so that their whole loss, in this particular, amount∣ed to sixty-four; whereas, the loss of Great-Britain did not exceed seven said of the line, and five frigates. It may be easily conceived how the French marine, at first greatly inferior to the naval power of Britain, roust have been affected by this dreadful balance to its prejudice.</NOTE>. By this time, indeed, Thurot had
escaped from Dunkirk, and directed his course to the
North-Sea, whither he was followed by Commodore Boys,
who nevertheless was disappointed in his pursuit; but the
fate of that enterprising adventurer falls under the annals
of the ensuing year, among the transactions of which it
shall be recorded. As for Sir Edward Hawke, he conti∣nued
cruising off the coast of Bretagne for a considerable
<PB N="466" REF="470"/>
time after the victory he had obtained, taking particular
care to block up the mouth of the river Vilaine, that the
seven French ships might not escape and join M. Conflans,
who made shift to reach Rochefort with the shattered re∣mains
of his squadron. Indeed, this service became such
a considerable object in the eyes of the British ministry, that
a large fleet was maintained upon this coast, apparently for
no other purpose, during a whole year, and, after all, the
enemy eluded their vigilance. Sir Edward Hawke, hav∣ing
undergone a long and dangerous conflict with tem∣pestuous
weather, was at length recalled, and presented to
his sovereign, who gratified him with a considerable pen∣sion,
for the courage and conduct he had so often and so
long displayed in the service of his country; and his ex∣traordinary
merit was afterwards honoured with the appro∣bation
of the parliament. The people of France were so
dispirited by the defeat of their army at Minden, and the
disaster of their squadron at Lagos, that the ministry of
Versailles thought proper to conceal the extent of their last
misfortune under a palliating detail published in the Ga∣zette
of Paris, as a letter from M. Conflans to the Count
de St. Florentin, secretary of the marine. In this partial
misrepresentation their admiral was made to affirm, that
the British fleet consisted of forty ships of the line of battle,
besides frigates; that the Soleil Royal had obliged the
Royal George to sheer off; that the seven ships which
retreated into the river Vilaine had received very little
damage, and would be soon repaired; and that, by the
junction of Bompart's squadron, he should be soon able to
give a good account of the English admiral. These tu∣mid
assertions, so void of truth, are not to be imputed to an
illiberal spirit of vain glory, so much as to a political de∣sign
of extenuating the national calamity, and supporting
the spirit of the people.</P>
<P>§ LII. The alarm of the French invasion, which was
thus so happily frustrated, not only disturbed the quiet of
Great-Britain, but also diffused itself to the kingdom of
Ireland, where it was productive of some publick dis∣order.
<PB N="467" REF="471"/>
In the latter end of October the two Houses of
parliament, assembled at Dublin, received a formal mes∣sage
from the Duke of Bedford, lord-lieutenant of that
kingdom, to the following effect: That, by a letter from
the secretary of state, written by his Majesty's express
command, it appeared that France, far from resigning
her plan of invasion, on account of the disaster that befel
her Toulon squadron, was more and more confirmed in
her purpose, and even instigated by despair itself, to at∣tempt
at all hazards the only resource she seemed to have
left for thwarting, by a diversion at home, the measures
of England abroad in prosecuting a war which hitherto
opened, in all parts of the world, so unfavourable a pro∣spect
to the view of French ambition: that in case the
body of French troops, amounting to eighteen thousand
men, under the command of the Duc d'Aiguillon,
assembled at Vannes, where also a sufficient number of
transports was prepared, should be able to clude the Bri∣tish
squadron, Ireland would, in all probability, be one
of their chief objects; his grace thought it, therefore, in∣cumbent
upon him, in a matter of such high importance
to the welfare of that kingdom, to communicate this in∣telligence
to the Irish parliament. He told them, his
Majesty would make no doubt but that the zeal of his
faithful protestant subjects in that kingdom had been
already sufficeintly quickened by the repeated accounts
received of the enemy's dangerous designs, and actual pre∣parations
made, at a vast expense, in order to inv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de the
several parts of the British dominions. He gave them to
understand he had received his sovereign's commands to
use his utmost endeavours to animate and excite his loyal
people of Ireland to exert their well-known zeal and spirit
in support of his Majesty's government, and in defence of
all that was dear to them, by timely preparation to resist
and frustrate any attempts of the enemy to disturb the quiet
and shake the security of this kngdom: he, therefore,
in the strongest manner, recommended it to them to mani∣fest,
upon this occasion, that zeal for the present happy
<PB N="468" REF="472"/>
establishment, and that affection for his Majesty's person
and government, by which the parliament of that nation
had been so often distinguished. Immediately after this
message was communicated, the House of Commons una∣nimously
resolved to present an address to the Lord-Lieu∣tenant,
thanking his grace for the care and concern he
had shown for the safety of Ireland in having imparted
intelligence of so great importance; desiring him to make
use of such means as should appear to him the most effectual
for the security and defence of the kingdom; and assuring
him, that the House would make good whatever expense
should be necessarily incurred for that purpose. This in∣timation,
and the steps that were taken in consequence
of it for the defence of Ireland, produced such appre∣hensions
and distraction among the people of that king∣dom,
as had well nigh proved fatal to the publick cre∣dit.
In the first transports of popular fear, there was
such an extraordinary run upon the banks of Dublin,
that several considerable bankers were obliged to stop pay∣ment;
and the circulation was in danger of being suden∣ly
stagnated, when the Lord-Lieutenant, the members of
both Houses of parliament, the lord-mayor, aldermen,
merchants, and principal traders of Dublin, engaged in
an association to support publick credit, by taking the
notes of bankers in payment: a resolution which effectu∣ally
answered the purpose intended.</P>
<P>§ LIII. Howsoever the court of Versailles might have
flattered itself that their invading army would in Ireland
be joined by a great number of the natives, in all proba∣bility
it would have been disappointed in this hope, had
their purposed descent even been carried into execution,
for no signs of disaffection to the reigning family appeared
at this juncture. On the contrary, the wealthy indivi∣duals
of the Romish per suasion offered to accommodate the
government with large sums of money, in case of ne∣cessity,
to support the present establishment against all its
enemies; and the Roman catholicks of the city of Cork,
in a body, presented an address to the Lord-Lieutenant,
<PB N="469" REF="473"/>
expressing their loyalty in the warmest terms of assurance.
After Having congratulated his grace on the unparalleled
successes which had attended his Majesty's arms, and ex∣pressed
their sense of the King's paternal tenderness for his
kingdom of Ireland, they acknowledged, with the deepest
sense of gratitude, that protection and indulgence they
had enjoyed under his Majesty's mild and auspicious reign.
They professed the warmest indignation at the threatened
invasion of the kingdom, by an enemy, who, grown des∣perate
from repeated defeats, might possibly make that
attempt as a last effort, vainly flattered with the imaginary
hope of assistance in Ireland, from the former attachments
of their deluded predecessors. They assured his grace, in
the most solemn manner, that such schemes were alto∣gether
inconsistent with their principles and intentions:
that they would, to the utmost exertion of their abilities,
with their lives and fortunes, join in the defence and support
of his Majesty's royal person and government against all
invaders whatsoever: that they should be always ready to
concur in such measures, and to act such parts in defence
of the kingdom, in common with the rest of his Majesty's
subjects, as his grace in his great wisdom should be pleased
to appoint; and think themselves particularly happy to be
under the direction and command of so known an assertor
of liberty, such an important and distinguished governor.
Finally, they expressed the most earnest wish, that his
Majesty's arms might be crowned with such a continuance
of success, as should enable him to defeat the devices of
all his enemies, and obtain a speedy and honourable peace.
This cordial address, which was transmitted to the Earl of
Shannon, and by him presented to the Duke of Bed∣ford,
must have been very agreeable to the government
at such a critical conjuncture.</P>
<P>§ LIV. Although no traces of disaffection to his Maje∣sty's
family appeared on this trying occasion, it must ne∣vertheless
be acknowledged that a spirit of dissatisfaction
broke out with extraordinary violence among the populace
of Dublin. The present Lord-Lieutenant was not remark∣ably
<PB N="470" REF="474"/>
popular in his administration. He had bestowed one
place of considerable importance upon a gentleman whose
person was obnoxious to many people in that kingdom,
and perhaps failed in that affability and condescension
which a free and ferocious nation expects to find in the
character of him to whose rule they are subjected. Whe∣ther
the offence taken at his deportment had created ene∣mies
to his person, or the nation in general began to en∣tertain
doubts and jealousies of the government's designs;
certain it is, great pains were taken to propagate a belief
among the lower sort of people, that an union would soon
be effected between Great-Britain and Ireland; in which
case this last kingdom would be deprived of its parliament
and independency, and be subjected to the same taxes
that are levied upon the people of England. This notion
inflamed the poulace to such a degree, that they assembled
in a prodigious multitude, broke into the House of Lords,
insulted the peers, seated an old woman on the throne,
and searched for the journals, which, had they been
found, they would have committed to the flames. Not
content with this outrage, they compelled the members
of both Houses whom they met in the streets to take an
oath that they would never consent to such an union, or
give any vote contrary to the true interest of Ireland.
Divers coaches belonging to obnoxious persons were de∣stroyed,
and their horses killed; and a gibbet was erected
for one gentleman in particular, who narrowly escaped
the ungovernable rage of those riotous insurgents. A body
of horse and infantry were drawn out on this occasion, in
order to over-awe the multitude, which at night dispersed
of itself. Next day addresses to the Lord-Lieutenant were
agreed to by both Houses of parliament, and a commit∣tee
of enquiry appointed, that the ringleaders of the tu∣mult
might be discovered, and brought to condign pu∣nishment.</P>
<P>§ LV. When the ministry of England received the first
advice that M. Thurot had escaped from Dunkirk with
a small squadron of armed ships, having on board a body
<PB N="471" REF="475"/>
of land-troops, designed for a private expedition on the
coast of Scotland or Ireland, expresses were immediately
dispatched to the commanding officers of the forces in
North-Britain, with orders to put the forts along the
coast of that kingdom in the best posture of defence;
and to hold every thing in readiness to repel the enemy,
in case they should attempt a descent. In consequence
of these instruction, beacons were erected for the imme∣diate
communication of intelligence; place of rendez∣vous
appointed for the regular troops and militia; and
strict orders issued that no officer should absent himself
from his duty, on any pretense whatever. The greatest
encomium that can be given to the character of this par∣tizan,
is an account of the alarm which the sailing of
his puny armament spread through the whole extent of
such a powerful kingdom, whose fleets covered the ocean.
Perhaps Thurot's career would have been sooner stop∣ped,
had Commodore Boys been victualled for a longer
cruise; but this commander was obliged to put into
Leith for a supply of provisions, at the very time when
Thurot was seen hovering on the coast near Aberdeen;
and before the English squadron was provided for a pro∣secution
of the cruise, the other had taken shelter at
Gottenburg, in Sweden.</P>
