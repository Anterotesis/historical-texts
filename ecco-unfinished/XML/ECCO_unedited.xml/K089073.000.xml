<HEAD>A PLAN
FOR THE CONDUCT OF
FEMALE EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE FEMALE CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE PARENTS and guardians of young ladies of the last
half century were less solicitous about procuring for them so
extensive an education, as modern refinement requires. Hence
it happens, that female education has not yet been reduced to a
perfect: system; but is frequently directed by those, who have
not themselves had a good education, or who have not studied
the subject with sufficient attention. And tho' many ingenious
remarks are to be found in the works of Locke, Rousseau,
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Genlis, and other writers still more modern; yet few of them
are exactly applicable to the management of boarding schools;
the improvement of which is the intent of the present treatise.</P>
<P>The advantages of a good education consist in uniting health
and agility of body with chearfulness and activity of mind; in
superadding graceful movements to the former, and agreeable
tastes to the latter; and in the acquirement of the rudiments of
such arts and sciences, as may amuse ourselves, or gain us the
esteem of others; with a strict attention to the culture of morality
and religion.</P>
<P>The female character should possess the mild and retiring vir∣tues
rather than the bold and dazzling ones; great eminence in
almost any thing is sometimes injurious to a young lady; whose
temper and disposition should appear to be pliant rather than ro∣bust;
to be ready to take impressions rather than to be decidedly
mark'd; as great apparent strength of character, however excel∣lent,
is liable to alarm both her own and the other sex; and to
create admiration rather than affection.</P>
<P>There are however situations in single life; in which, after
the completion of their school-education, ladies may cultivate to
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
any extent the fine arts or the sciences for their amusement or
instruction. And there are situations in a married state; which
may call forth all the energies of the mind in the care, education,
or provision, for a family; which the inactivity, folly, or death
of a husband may render necessary. Hence if to softness of man∣ners,
complacency of countenance, gentle unhurried motion,
with a voice clear and yet tender, the charms which enchant all
hearts! can be superadded internal strength and activity of mind,
capable to transact the business or combat the evils of life; with
a due sense of moral and religious obligation; all is obtain'd,
which education can supply; the female character becomes com∣pleat,
excites our love, and commands our admiration.</P>
<P>Education should draw the outline, and teach the use of the
pencil; but the exertions of the individual must afterwards intro∣duce
the various gradations of shade and colour, must illuminate
the landscape, and fill it with the beautiful figures of the Graces
and the Virtues.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>Section II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MUSICK AND DANCING</HEAD>
<P>ARE generally taught by masters, who profess those arts;
concerning which we shall only observe, that they are frequently
believed to be of too great importance in female education; and
on that account that too much time is expended on their acquire∣ment.
It is perhaps more desirable, that young ladies should play,
sing, and dance, only so well as to amuse themselves and their
friends, than to practise those arts in so eminent a degree as to
astonish the public; because a great apparent attention to trivial
accomplishments is liable to give a suspicion, that more valuable
acquisitions have been neglected. And, as they consist in an
exhibition of the person, they are liable to be attended with vani∣ty,
and to extinguish the blush of youthful timidity; which is
in young ladies the most powerful of their exterior charms.</P>
<P>Such masters should be chosen to instruct young ladies in these
accomplishments, as are not only well qualified to sing and play,
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
or to dance themselves; but also who can teach with good temper
and genteel behaviour: they should recollect, that vulgar man∣ners,
with the sharp gestures of anger, and its disagreeable tones
of voice, are unpardonable in those, who profess to teach grace∣ful
motion, and melodious expression; and may affect the taste
and temper of their pupils, so as to be more injurious to their
education; than any thing, which they are able to teach them,
can counterbalance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">READING.</HEAD>
<P>AS Reading is as much a language to the eye, as speaking is
to the ear; it requires much time and labour for children to ac∣quire
both these languages. Such books should therefore be put
into their hands, as join amusement with instruction, and thus
lighten the fatigue of continued application, as Sandford and
Merton, Parent's assistant, Evenings at home, and many others.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
In learning to read aloud, a clear and distinct enunciation is
seldom acquired at schools; which is owing to the child standing
close to the teacher, who looks over the book along with it; and
hence the pupil finds no difficulty in being understood, even
when she pronounces only half words. This however is easily
remedied by placing the reader at the distance of two yards or
more from the hearer; then the young scholar soon finds, that
she is not understood, unless she expresses herself with clear
articulation. For this purpose the teacher should always be pro∣vided
with a duplicate of the book, she teaches; that she may
not be necessitated to look over the shoulder of her pupil.</P>
<P>As the young scholars advance in the knowledge of language,
other books must be taught them both in prose and poetry; such
as may improve their minds in the knowledge of things, in mo∣rality,
religion, or which may form their taste. A great number
of books for the use of children has been published in late years;
many of them by very ingenious writers, and well adapted to the
purpose designed, of such of these, as have come to my know∣ledge,
a catalogue shall be given at the end of this treatise.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<HEAD>Section IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>WRITING, as it keeps the body in a fix'd posture, as well
as drawing, and needlework, should not be too long applied to
at a time; since the body, and even the countenance, may thus
get a certain tendency to one attitude; as is seen in children, who
are brought up to some mechanic art, as in polishing buttons or
precious stones on a lathe. A proper manner of holding the pen,
or pencil, or needle, with an easy but graceful attitude of the
person, and an agreeable moderate attention of the countenance,
should first be taught; for which purposes an inclined desk has
many advantages over an horizontal table for the books, or work∣ing
frames; as the body is thence less bent forwards; and the
light in general situations more vividly reflected to the eye.</P>
<P>If the desk be sixteen inches broad, the furthermost edge of it
should rise about three inches and half from the horizontal line;
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
which produces the most convenient inclination, and the table or
frame, which supports it, for the use of the taller children, should
rise about two feet eight inches from the ground.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GRAMMAR,</HEAD>
<P>WHICH is an abstract science teaching the texture of lan∣guage,
is too hard for very young minds; and is therefore gene∣rally
taught too early: and the same may be said of Arithmetic.
The English grammars in general use at schools are both tedious
and defective compositions; an epitome, or extract, from Lowth's
grammar, with the late improvements of Mr. Horne Tooke in
the theory of language, would well supply this branch of know∣ledge;
and might be given to the public under the name of a
“rational English grammar.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Devis has publish'd a small and useful rudiment of gram∣mar
purposely for the use of young Iadies; which may be taught
as an introduction to Lowth's grammar. The Abbé Gaultier's
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Jeu de Grammaire may perhaps be render'd amusing to children,
and convey to them ideas of the French grammar. It is sold by
Elmsley in the Strand, and by Mrs. Harrow in Pall-Mall; but
is perhaps better adapted to private families, than to schools.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">LANGUAGES.</HEAD>
<P>THE necessity of learning some antient or foreign languages
imposes a laborious task on the youth of both sexes; which con∣sumes
years of their precious time, which might otherwise be
employed in the acquisition of sciences. The difficulty of ob∣taining
a competent knowledge of the Greek or Latin language
is many times greater than that of obtaining any modern one; as
may be deduced from the innumerable changes of the termination
of their nouns, adjectives, and verbs; which to a beginner are
all so many new words. And as the works of the best writers
in these languages have been translated into our own, it is less
necessary in the education of ladies to expend so much time and
labour in acquiring them. But as the French and Italian are less
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
difficult to learn, and contain new books of taste and knowledge,
which are yearly publish'd in this age of literature; and as they
are convenient for conversing with foreigners, who come hither,
or in our travelling into other countries; and lastly, as they are
agreeable as well as fashionable studies; the pupils of boarding
schools should be encouraged to attain one or both of them.</P>
<P>The method recommended by Mr. Locke in his treatise on
education, sect. 162, of teaching languages by conversation, will
on trial be generally found successful in respect to modern lan∣guages
with even the youngest children. Nevertheless a know∣ledge
of grammar should afterwards be taught with care, if the
child be too young at first to attend to it; for without the aid of
grammar not only the French or Italian languages, but even the
English will not always be spoken or written with perfect
accuracy.</P>
<P>For this purpose of acquiring modern languages by conversa∣tion,
a school generally supplies better opportunities than a pri∣vate
family, besides the advantage of some degree of emulation,
which frequently exists, where children converse together: ano∣ther
advantage of infantine society is, that they learn many other
things, as well as languages, by repeating them to each other; and
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
obtain, what is seldom to be acquired from adult companions,
some knowledge of physiognomy; as the passions of children are
more legibly express'd on their countenances than at a maturer
age. This knowledge of physiognomy, which is perhaps only
to be acquired at schools, by giving a promptitude of understand∣ing
the present approbation or dislike, and the good or bad de∣signs,
of those whom we converse with, becomes of hourly use
in almost every department of life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ARITHMETIC</HEAD>
<P>LIKE grammar is an abstract science, which is frequently
attempted to be taught too early; at the same time it may be
observed, that the early initiation of most children into card play∣ing
before they come to school, by giving clear and visible ideas
of the ten first numerals, seems greatly to facilitate their acquire∣ment
of arithmetic; and if this fashionable amusement could be
so managed by the parents, who allow it to their children, as not
to excite a desire of gain along with a contest of ingenuity, it
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
might be rendered, in some measure, advantageous by exciting the
mind to activity in this branch of science; but is nevertheless
not proper to be used in schools, where it's effects on the passions
cannot be sufficiently watched, and counteracted.</P>
<P>So much of the science of numbers as is in common use, as
the numeration, subtraction, multiplication, and division of mo∣ney,
should be learnt with accuracy; to which should be added
the rule of three, and decimal fractions; which will abundantly
repay the labour of acquiring them by the pleasure and utility,
which will perpetually result from the knowledge of them thro'
life. The higher parts of arithmetic, as algebra and fluxions, be∣long
to the abstruser sciences.</P>
<P>There are many introductory books to the science of arith∣metic;
those I have heard most recommended are Vise's tutor's
guide, Hutton's practical arithmetic, and Wingate's arithmetic;
but it is probable, that most of the introductory treatises to arith∣metic
must be nearly of equal excellence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>Section VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GEOGRAPHY.</HEAD>
<P>SO much of this science, as depends only on memory, may be
taught to children in their early years. They should be taught
to point out on large maps the counties of England, and then the
principal divisions of Europe, and of the other quarters of the
world; and lastly to trace out the principal rivers and mountains,
which ingrave or imboss it's surface, which is much to be pre∣fer'd
to dissected maps; as it is the situations, rather than the
exact forms of counties and of countries, which should be at∣tended
to. Afterwards the use of the globes should be explain'd;
and some short outline of astronomy ought to accompany these
lectures.</P>
<P>A compendious system of geography on cards, published by
Mr. Newberry, in St. Paul's church yard, supplies a very conve∣nient
method of instructing children. Other geographical cards
by Bowles, tho' they only mention the latitude and longitude of
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
important places, may also be used with advantage. The maps
publish'd by Mr. Faden, which have blank outlines to be filled up
by the student, are well designed, and not very expensive. The
Abbé Gualtier's cours de Geographie form'd into a game may,
like his game at grammar, be render'd amusing to children, and
are tolerably well adapted both to private families, where there
are but few pupils, and to public seminaries of instruction.</P>
<P>Fairman's geography, a small octavo sold by Johnson, contains
a short account of the planets, and use of the globes. Brooks's
gazetteer is an useful work; and some other good geographical
publications are mentioned in the catalogue of books at the end
of this work.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THE history of mankind is connected with the knowledge of
the earth, which they cultivate. A summary of the history of
England should precede that of other nations, as it may be more
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
interesting, and more easily comprehended by English children.
Afterwards an abridgement of the history of other nations both
antient and modern may be collected from various writers, but
are some of them already made concise and agreeable by Dr. Gold∣smith
in his histories of Greece and Rome, as well as of England
and Scotland; which however cannot be well remembered with∣out
a previous knowledge of geography, or by consulting maps
with every change of place in the account of transactions.</P>
<P>Afterwards a brief, but correct knowledge of history still more
ancient, and of chronology, comprehending the four great em∣pires
of the world, with the rise of the present kingdoms of
Europe from the fall of the last, may be acquired according to
the plan of Mrs. Chapone in her letters on the improvement of
the mind. This outline of history and chronology may be readily
and agreeably learned from Priestley's chart of history; which
with his chart of biography should hang amongst a collection
of large well-colour'd maps in the parlour of a boarding school,
that they may frequently encounter the eyes of the young
students.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
<HEAD>Section X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">NATURAL HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THE history of the various other animals is also connected
with our knowledge of the various parts of the earth, which they
inhabit. This is termed natural history, and may be taught to
children earlier than the histories of mankind, as being easier to
their comprehensions, and thence more interesting and agreeable
to them. Dr. Goldsmith in his history of animated nature has
also made this part of knowledge of easy access; and Mr.
Bewick's account of quadrupedes, with wood-prints of the ani∣mals,
and amusing tale-pieces to the sections, are quite charming
to children. To these should be added a treatise on birds, with
the scientific names admirably adapted for the use of schools by
Mr. Galton, publish'd by Johnson in St. Paul's church yard,
London, in three small volumes. And besides these, children
should be permitted occasionally to inspect the collections of fo∣reign
animals, which are frequently exhibited in this country;
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
as an examination of the objects themselves conveys clearer ideas
than prints and descriptions, and at the same time adds to their
knowledge, and gratifies their curiosity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE RUDIMENTS OF TASTE</HEAD>
<P>ARE too much neglected in most boarding schools; these
should be taught with some care, as perhaps peculiarly belonging
to Ladies; since taste enters into their dress, their motions, their
manners, as well as into all the fine arts, which they have leisure
to cultivate; as drawing, painting, modelling, making artificial
flowers, embroidery; writing letters, reading, speaking, and into
almost every circumstance of life.</P>
<P>The general rudiments of taste are to be acquired first by
reading books, which treat professedly on the subject; as the ten
papers by Mr. Addison on the power of imagination in the Spec∣tator,
vol. 6, No. 411; Akinside's pleasures of imagination;
Burke on the sublime and beautiful; Hogarth's analysis of beauty;
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Mason's English garden; Wheatley's ornamental gardening; and
Gilpin's picturesque views. Secondly by selecting and explain∣ing
admired passages from classical authors, as the Beauties of
Shakespear, of Johnson, and of Stern. And lastly by exhibiting
and explaining the prints of beautiful objects, or casts of the best
antique gems and medallions.</P>
<P>The authors above mentioned have divided the objects of Taste
into the sublime, the beautiful, and the new; but a new sect of
inquirers into this subject have lately added the Picturesque;
which is supposed to differ from the beautiful by it's want of
smoothness, and from the sublime from it's want of size; but
this circumstance has not yet perhaps undergone sufficient exa∣mination.
—See essay on Picturesque, by U. Price.</P>
<P>Others have endeavoured to make a distinction between beauty
and grace; and have esteem'd them, as it were, rivals for the
possession of the human heart. But Grace may be defined Beauty
in action; for a sleeping beauty can not be called graceful, in
whatever attitude she may recline; the muscles must be in action
to produce a graceful attitude, and the limbs to produce a grace∣ful
motion. The supposed origin of our ideas of beauty acquired
in our early infancy from the curved lines, which form the female
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
bosom, is deliver'd in Zoonomia, vol. I. sect. xvi. 6; but is too
metaphysical an investigation for young ladies.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">DRAWING AND EMBROIDERY.</HEAD>
<P>DRAWING as an elegant art belongs to the education of
young ladies, and greatly facilitates the acquirement of Taste.
As this is generally taught by masters, who profess it, I shall
only observe, that tho' as an art it consists of deceiving the eye,
yet as a science it is capable of producing to the mind the most
sublime and beautiful images, or the most interesting scenes of
life, for our amusement, admiration, or instruction.</P>
<P>The same observation applies to Embroidery, which is paint∣ing
with the needle instead of the pencil, and seems to have been
a fashionable employment of ladies of the highest rank in the early
ages of the world. As the ladies in polite life have frequently
much leisure time at their disposal, it is wise for them to learn
many elegant as well as useful arts in their early years; which
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
they may afterward cultivate for their amusement; and thus de∣prive
solitude of irksomeness: And by being able to entertain
themselves, they may be less solicitous to enter the circles of dis∣sipation,
and depend less for happiness on the caprice of others.</P>
<P>Besides the amusement or accomplishment of possessing the
talent of drawing, there is another advantage resulting from it;
which consists in using the pencil as a language to express the
forms of all visible objects, as of flowers, machines, houses,
landscapes; which can not in words alone be conveyed to others
with sufficient accuracy: For this end it may be sufficient to
draw in outlines alone the figures of natural things, without ex∣pending
so much time on this art, as is requisite to enable the
learner to add the nice touches, which form the delicate grada∣tions
of shade and colour.</P>
<P>It may be supposed, that some knowledge of the science of
perspective should be previously acquired for the purpose of draw∣ing
the outlines of objects; but I suspect, that this is not always
necessary, since at our learning to see; before we have compared
the ideas received by the sense of sight with those received by
that of touch; any object placed before our eyes, as suppose the
face of a companion, must appear a flat coloured or shaded sur∣face,
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
and not a solid substance cover'd with eminences and depres∣sions;
as is so well proved by Bishop Berkley in his theory of
vision. Hence if any one could so far unlearn the language of
sight as to imagine the face of his companion to be a flat colour'd
surface only, (as it is really seen) he would draw from nature as
easily and exactly, as if he was copying a picture, as the inequa∣lities
would appear lights and shades; and he would thus be
enabled to take the likeness with much greater facility and accu∣racy without the aid of the rules of perspective.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY</HEAD>
<P>IS connected with the study of taste, and should therefore be
taught in boarding schools; as without some knowledge of it the
works of the painters, statuarists, and poets, both antient and
modern, can not be understood. But as a great part of this
mythology consists of personify'd vices, much care should be
taken in female schools, as well as in male ones, to prevent any
bad impressions, which might be made on the mind by this kind
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
of erudition; this is to be accomplished by explaining the alle∣gorical
meaning of many of these supposed actions of heathen
deities, and by shewing that they are at present used only as
emblems of certain powers, as Minerva of wisdom, and Bellona
of war, and thus constitute the language of painters; and are
indeed almost the whole language which that art possesses, besides
the delineation of visible objects in rest or in action.</P>
<P>These emblems however are not to be so easily acquired by
descriptions alone, nor so easily remembered by young pupils; as
when prints of antique statues, or medallions, or when cameos,
or impressions of antique gems, are at the same time shewn and
explained to them. For this purpose the prints of Spence's
Polymetis may be exhibited and explained; from which Bell's
pantheon is principally taken: And Dannet's dictionary of my∣thology,
originally written in french, may be occasionally con∣sulted;
and the notes on Mr. Pope's translations of Homer.</P>
<P>There is also a little book intitled, “Instructions sur les Meta∣morphoses,
par M. Le Ragois,” which, I am informed is an use∣ful
and unexceptionable work for this purpose, containing a kind
of summary of each story of fabulous mythology: to which may
be added a translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses, published by
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
Garth; which, I am told, is the best translation of that work.
Much agreeable knowledge of this kind is to be found in Byrant's
mythology; Abbe de Pluche's history of the heavens; Warbur∣ton's
essay on Elensinian mysteries; to which I beg leave to add
the descrisption of the Portland vase in the notes to the first vo∣lume

<HEAD TYPE="sub">POLITE LITERATURE</HEAD>
<P>MAY be divided into dissertations, plays, romances, poems;
each of which, if the works are properly selected, may afford
amusement and instruction to young persons; of some of the
books of each of these classes of literature a catalogue will be
given at the end of the work.</P>
<P>Such dissertations, as have been generally admired, may be
selected from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, the World, the
Rambler, Adventurer, besides many others.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31"/>
Plays are of three kinds, tragical, sentimental, and humour∣ous;
of the first, Addison's Cato has been long admired; and the
tragedies of Thompson consist of fine language. Of the second
kind Cumberland's comedies are instances; and of the third She∣ridan's
comedies; some of which are entertaining and inoffensive,
and may be read by young ladies without injury to their morals,
or much outrage to their feelings.</P>
<P>There are many plays, which are better seen as exhibited on
the stage, than as read in the closet; because the objectionable
passages are generally omitted in the representation. But whether
young ladies should be taught to act plays themselves, as is done
at some boy's schools, is a matter of doubt. The danger consists
in this, least the acquisition of bolder action, and a more elevated
voice, should annihilate that retiring modesty, and blushing em∣barrasment,
to which young ladies owe one of their most power∣ful
external charms.</P>
<P>If young ladies act plays amongst themselves only, or without
admitting more than two or three of their friends or parents; or
if they repeat chosen scenes of plays, or speeches only, much of
the above objection ceases, and some advantages may result to
their attitudes or enunciation. Madam de Genlis's Theatre
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
D'Education affords the least exceptionable whole plays, with the
sacred dramas of Miss Moore, and of Metastatio.</P>
<P>3. Novels or romances may be divided into the serious, the
humorous, and the amorous. Of these, the use of the last should
be intirely interdicted; but the first, when well managed, may
convey instruction in the most agreeable and forceable manner:
Such as Mr. Day's Sandford and Merton. The Children's friend.
Tales of the castle. Robinson Crusoe. Edward, by the author
of Zelucco. And to these may be added some other modern
novels, the productions of ingenious ladies, which are I believe
less objectionable than many others; as the Evelina, Cecilia, and
Camilla of Miss Burney. The Emmeline and Ethelinda of
Charlotte Smith; Inchbald's simple story; Mrs. Brook's Emely
Montague; and the female Quixote; all which I have here
introduced from the character given to me of them by a very
ingenious lady, not having myself read them with sufficient
attention. And lastly, the humorous novels, which are not writ∣ten
to inflame the passions, convey instruction, as far as they are
imitations of real life: Of these are Le Sage's famous novel of
Gil Blas; and Fielding's Tom Jones; neither of which however
are proper books for young readers.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/>
There are many, who condemn the use of novels altogether;
but what are epic poems but novels in verse?—It is difficult to
draw the line of limit between novels, and other works of ima∣gination;
unless the word novel be confined to mean only the
romances of love and chivalry.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, that almost all novels, as well as plays, and
epic poems, have some exceptional passages to be found in them;
which might therefore be expunged, before they are allow'd to
be read by young ladies. But are young women therefore to be
kept in intire ignorance of mankind, with whom they must
shortly associate, and from whom they are frequently to chuse a
partner for life? This would be making them the slaves rather
than the companions of men, like the Sultanas of a Turkish
Seraglio. And how can young women, who are secluded from
the other sex from their infancy, form any judgment of men, if
they are not to be assisted by such books, as delineate manners?
—A lady of fortune, who was persuaded by her guardian to marry
a disagreeable and selfish man, speaking to her friend of the ill
humour of her husband, lamented, that she had been prohibited
from reading novels. “If I had read such books, said she, before
I was married, I should have chosen better; I was told, that
all men were alike except in respect to fortune.”</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/>
We must however observe, that novels are perhaps more ob∣jectionable
in schools than in private education; as the comments
of one bad mind may be dangerous to the whole community:
And as they are more amusing to young people than any other
books, if read too early, they may give a distate to more useful
knowledge; which are good reasons for the total prohibition of
them in schools: And in private education, least a preference of
fiction to truth should be thus instill'd, the ridiculous passages,
with which even the best novels abound, should be carefully
pointed out by a friend or governess; with their exaggerations,
improbabilities, and frequent deviations from nature.</P>
<P>There are indeed few books, which delineate manners, whe∣ther
in prose or poetry, however well chosen, which have not
some objectionable passages in them. In reading the fables of
Esop, Mr. Rousseau well observes, that the effect on the mind
may frequently be totally different from that designed by the
author; as in the fable where the fox flatters the crow, and gains
the piece of cheese, the moral was designed to shew the folly of
attending to flatterers; but may equally be supposed to applaud
the cunning of the fox or flatterer, who is rewarded. In the
popular narrative of Robinson Crusoe a childish superstition con∣cerning
intimations of future events, somewhat like the second
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
sight of the highlands of Scotland, is frequently inculcated; and
the use of rum or brandy is proposed as an infallible cure in all
maladies; which however I am told is corrected in the new
Robinson Crusoe.</P>
<P>Pamela, and Joseph Andrews, and Clarissa Harlow, are re∣commended
by Madame de Genlis, and by Mrs. Macawley.
—Madame de Genlis in a note in one of her works gives her reason
for recommending Richardson's novels; because his heroins re∣tain
a more considerable degree of command over their affections
than those of apparently less exceptionable romances. In this
respect, a novel call'd “Plain Sense,” lately published by Lane,
and written by an ingenious Cheshire lady, claims the preference
to all others, and appears to me to carry this idea to excess.</P>
<P>The works of Richardson are nevertheless not only too vo∣luminous,
and thence would consume too much time, which
might be better employ'd in schools; but in these, and even in
Mr. Pope's rape of the lock, and his Eloisa to Abelard, many ob∣jectionable
passages of another kind may be discover'd. If these
passages, from which so few books are totally exempt, were ex∣punged,
it might raise curiosity, and induce young people to
examine different copies of the same work, and to seek for other
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
improper books themselves; it is therefore perhaps better, when
these books are read to a governess, that she should express dis∣approbation
in a plain and quiet way of such passages, rather than
to expunge them; which would give a feeling of dislike to the
pupil, and confirm her delicacy, rather than give impurity to her ideas.</P>
<P>Much therefore depends on the conduct of the governess in
this respect, so long as they are under the eye of a judicious
monitor, no real harm could probably arise from their seeing
human nature in all the classes of life, not only as it should be,
or as it may be imagined to be, but as it really exists, since with∣out
comparison there can be no judgment, and consequently no
real knowledge.</P>
<P>It must nevertheless be observed, that the excessive study of
novels is universally an ill employment at any time of life; not
only because such readers are liable to acquire a romantic taste;
and to return from the flowery scenes of fiction to the common
duties of life with a degree of regret; but because the high-wrought
scenes of elegant distress display'd in novels have been
found to blunt the feelings of such readers towards real objects of
misery; which awaken only disgust in their minds instead of sen∣timents
of pity or benevolence.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37"/>
4. The works of the poets, as well as those of the writers
of novels, require to be selected with great caution. The same
may be said of painting, sculpture, and musick; which by de∣lighting
the imagination influence the judgment, and may thence
be employ'd either to good or bad purposes: But as poetry, when
thus selected, like painting, sculpture, and musick, it's rival sis∣ters,
is an object of refined taste, and affords an elegant amuse∣ment
at least, it so far belongs to the education of young ladies.</P>
<P>Gay's fables, Thomson's seasons, Gisborne's walk in a forest, are
proper for the younger classes of pupils; afterwards Pope's
Ethic epistles, and essay on man, Goldsmith's poems, Akinside,
Mason, Gray, and others, which are enumerated in the cata∣logue.
I forbear to mention the Botanic garden; as some ladies
have intimated to me, that the Loves of the plants are describbed
in too glowing colours; but as the descriptions are in general of
female forms in graceful attitudes, the objection is less forceable
in respect to female readers. And besides the celebrated poets of
our own country, as Milton and Shakespeare, translations from
the antients, as from Homer and Virgil; and from the more mo∣dern
poems of Tasso, and Camoens, may be read with pleasure
and improvement, tho' some objectionable passages may perhaps
be found in all of them.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38"/>
5. For the purpose of forming a style in writing, a few well-chosen
books should be read often over; till the ear acquires, as
it were, the musick of the sentences; and the imagination is thus
enabled to copy it in our own compositions; such as those papers
of the Spectator, which are ascribed to Addison, and are termi∣nated
with a capital letter of the word Clio; or some of Lady
Wortley Montague's letters from Turkey; or other works of
chaste, distinct, and expressive style, not over-loaded with meta∣phors,
which with superabundance of ornament injure perspi∣cuity.</P>
<P>But for other purposes of education it is perhaps better to teach
young people select parts of many books, than a few intire ones;
not only because the pupils will thus be acquainted with more
authors in fashionable literature; but because the business of
polite education is to give the outline of many species of erudi∣tion,
or branches of knowledge; which the young ladies may
cultivate further at their future leisure without the assistance of a
teacher, as may best suit their tastes or their situations.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this section on polite learning without men∣tioning,
that some illiterate men have condemned the cultivation
of the minds of the female sex, and have call'd such in ridicule
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
learned ladies; as if it was a reproach to render themselves agree∣able
and useful. Where affectation is join'd with learning, it be∣comes
pedantry, but this belongs oftener to the ignorant than to
the cultivated; as is so well elucidated in “Letters to literary
ladies,” a small duodecimo published by Johnson, and written by
one of the ingenious family of E—in Ireland.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ARTS AND SCIENCES.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDES the acquisition of grammar, languages, and com∣mon
arithmetic; and besides a knowledge of geography, civil
history, and natural history, there are other sciences, an outline
of which might be taught to young ladies of the higher classes
of the school, or of more inquiring minds, before or after they
leave school; which might not only afford them present amuse∣ment,
but might enable them at any future time to prosecute any
of them further, if inclination and opportunity should coincide;
and, by enlarging their sphere of taste and knowledge, would
occasion them to be interested in the conversation of a greater
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
number and of more ingenious men, and to interest them by
their own conversation in return.</P>
<P>1. An outline of Botany may be learnt from Lee's introduc∣tion
to botany, and from the translations of the works of Linnaeus by a society at Litchfield; to which might be added Curtis's bota∣nical
magazine, which is a beautiful work, and of no great ex∣pence.
But there is a new treatise introductory to botany call'd
Botanic dialogues for the use of schools, well adapted to this pur∣pose,
written by M. E. Jacson, a lady well skill'd in botany, and
published by Johnson, London. And lastly I shall not forbear
to mention, that the philosophical part of botany may be agree∣ably
learnt from the notes to the second volume of the Botanic
garden, whether the poetry be read or not.</P>
<P>2. An outline of Chemistry, which surprizes and enchants
us, may be learnt from the Elements of chemistry by Lavoisier,
originally published in french; to which may be added a small
work of Fourcroy call'd the philosophy of Chemistry. The for∣mer
of these illustrious chemists perish'd by the guillotine, an ir∣reparable
loss to science and to mankind!</P>
<P>The acquirement of Chemistry should be preceded by a sketch
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
of Mineralogy; which is not only an interesting branch of science,
as it teaches the knowledge of diamonds and precious stones, and
of the various mines of metals, coals, and salt; but because it
explains also the difference of soils, and is thus concern'd in the
theory and practice of agriculture: But there is at present no
proper introductory book, that I know of, on this subject for the
use of children; as Cronstedt's, and Bergman's, and Kirwan's
mineralogy are too exact and prolix; nor could be well under∣stood
without a small collection of fossils.</P>
<P>3. An outline of the sciences, to which Mathematics have
generally been applied, as of astronomy, mechanics, hydrostatics,
and optics, with the curious addition of electricity and mag∣netism,
may best be acquired by attending the lectures in experi∣mental
philosophy, which are occasionally exhibited by itinerant
philosophers; and which have almost exclusively acquired the
name of natural philosophy.</P>
<P>The books in common use for teaching these sciences are too
difficult and abstruse for the study of young persons. Some parts
of natural phylosophy are render'd not unentertaining in the
notes of the first volume of the Botanic garden, as the theory of
meteors, and of winds; and an account of the strata of the earth;
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
which nevertheless require too much attention for very young
ladies; but may be read with pleasure after leaving school by
those, who posses inquiring minds. It is to be wished that some
writer of juvenile books would endeavour easily to explain the
structure and use of the barometer, and thermometer, and of
clocks and watches, which supply a part of the furniture of our
houses, and of our pockets.</P>
<P>4. In the same manner the various arts and manufactories,
which adorn and enrich this country, should occasionally be
shewn and explain'd to young persons, as so many ingenious parts
of experimental philosophy; as well as from their immediately
contributing to the convenience of life, and to the wealth of the
nations, which have invented or established them. Of these are
the cotton works on the river Derwent in Derbyshire; the pot∣teries
in Staffordshire; the iron-founderies of Coalbrooke Dale in
Shropshire; the manufactories of Birmingham, Manchester, Not∣tingham;
but these are not in the province of a boarding school,
but might be advantageously exhibited to young ladies by their
parents in the summer vacations.</P>
<P>5. In this section of arts and sciences it may be proper to
mention the art of producing a technical memory invented by
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
Mr. Gray; which may be readily acquired by consulting his
book, and may perhaps be of advantage in remembering dates or
numbers; as they are express'd by letters, and form'd into words.
This work I attended to in my youth, but found it an amusing
trick, rather than an useful art.</P>
<P>6. The art of writing Short-hand, which is said to be of
English invention, should also be mentioned in this place. The
book I learn'd this art from was publish'd by Gurney, and said
to be an improvement on Mason; other treatises of short-hand I
have also examined, but found them all nearly of equal excel∣lence.
I can only add, that many volumes, which I wrote from
medical lectures, I now find difficult to decypher; and that as the
words in short-hand are spelt from their sound only; those scho∣lars,
who practise this art early in life, are liable not afterwards
to spell our language correctly; and lastly, that I believe, this
art is still capable of improvement by first forming a more accu∣rate
alphabet, than that in common use among all european
nations.</P>
<P>7. This section on arts and sciences may perhaps be thought
to include more branches of them, than is necessary for female
erudition. But as in male education the tedious acquirement of
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
antient languages for the purpose of studying poetry and oratory
is gradually giving way to the more useful cultivation of modern
sciences, it may be of advantage to ladies of the rising generation
to acquire an outline of similar knowledge; as they are in future
life to become companions; and one of the greatest pleasures re∣ceived
in conversation consists in being reciprocally well under∣stood.
Botany is already a fashionable study for ladies; and che∣mistry
is ingeniously recommended to them in the Letters to lite∣rary
ladies.—Johnson, London.</P>

<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MORALS.</HEAD>
<P>THE criterion of moral duties has been variously delivered by
different writers: Expediency, by which is meant whatever in∣creases
the sum of public happiness, is by some called the crite∣rion
of virtue; and whatever diminishes that sum is term'd vice.
By others the happiness or misery of the individual, if rightly
understood, is said to be the bond of moral obligation. And lastly,
by others the will of God is said to constitute the sole criterion of
virtue and vice.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45"/>
But besides systematic books of morality, which are generally
too abstruse for young minds, morals may be divided into five
departments for the greater conveniency of the manner of in∣struction.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A sympathy with the pains and pleasures of others, or
compassion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A strict regard to veracity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Prudence, justice, chastity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Fortitude.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Temperance.</ITEM>
</LIST>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">COMPASSION.</HEAD>
<P>A Sympathy with the pains and pleasures of others is the
foundation of all our social virtues. “DO AS YOU WOULD BE
DONE BY,” is a precept, which descended from heaven. Who∣ever
feels pain himself, when he sees others affected with it, will
not only never be liable to give pain, but will always be inclined
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
to relieve it. The lady, who possesses this christian virtue of com∣passion,
cannot but be a good daughter, a good wife, and a good
mother, that is, an amiable character in every department of
life.</P>
<P>The manner of communicating this benevolent sympathy to
children consists in expressing our own sympathy, when any thing
cruel presents itself; as in the destruction of an insect; or when
actions of cruelty are related in books or in conversation. I once
observed a lady with apparent expressions of sympathy say to her
little daughter, who was pulling off the legs of a fly, “how
should you like to have your arms and legs pull'd off? would it
not give you great pain? pray let it fly away out of the win∣dow:”
which I doubt not would make an indelible impression
on the child, and lay the foundation of an amiable character.</P>
<P>This virtue of compassion is a certain foundation of benevo∣lence;
and on that account renders children good to their own
parents in the latter part of their lives, as well as to all other
people; an important circumstance to the happiness of our latter
years! Where cruelty or malevolence resides in the breast, it is
generally exercised most by the child upon the aged parent, with
whom in civilized society he frequently resides; and who often
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
lives so long as to stand in his way to the possession of a wish'd-for
inheritance.</P>
<P>This compassion, or sympathy with the pains of others, ought
also to extend to the brute creation, as far as our necessities will
admit; for we cannot exist long without the destruction of other
animal or vegetable beings either in their mature or embryon
state. Such is the condition of mortality, that the first law of
nature is “eat, or be eaten.” Hence for the preservation of our
existence we may be supposed to have a natural right to kill those
brute creatures, which we want to eat, or which want to eat us;
but to destroy even insects wantonly shews an unreflecting mind,
or a depraved heart.</P>
<P>A young gentleman once assured me, that he had lately fallen
in love with a young lady; but, on their walking out one even∣ing
in summer, she took two or three steps out of her way on the
gravel walk to tread upon an insect; and that afterwards when∣ever
the idea of her came into his mind, it was attended with this
picture of active cruelty, till that of the lady ceased to be agree∣able,
and he relinquished his design of courtship.</P>
<P>Nevertheless this sympathy, however amiable and necessary,
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
may be carried to an extreme, so as to render miserable the per∣son,
who possesses it; since many pitiable objects must be seen in
our journey through life, which we have not power to relieve.
This then furnishes us with a barrier or line, where to stop; that
is, we should endeavour to render our little pupils alive to sym∣pathize
with all remediable evils; and at the same time to arm
them with fortitude to bear the sight of such irremediable evils,
as the accidents of life must frequently present before their eyes.</P>
<P>There should also be a plan in schools to promote the habit as
well as the principle of benevolence; each young lady might
occasionally contribute a small sum on seeing a needy naked child
to purchase flannel or coarse linen for clothes, which they might
learn to cut out, and to make up themselves; and thus the prac∣tise
of industry might be united with that of liberality.</P>
<P>Another still more practical mode of producing a habit of be∣nevolence
in children might be by inducing them to employ some
leisure hours in little works of taste, as in making artificial flow∣ers,
purses, fringes, and bestowing these on poor people, in order
that they might sell them for their support. Miss Hartley at
Bath, the daughter of the great medical philosopher of that
name, has lately exhibited an amiable example of this kind of
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
philanthropy; she has been long distinguished by her talents as
an artist in painting; and has lately distributed her elegant per∣formances
among the poor famished emigrants, who reside in her
neighbourhood; who are thus greatly assisted by the sale of her
works.</P>
<P>Another channel, in which this sympathy should be taught to
flow, is in the observance of those attentions, which perpetually
diffuse happiness by promoting by courtesy of behaviour the
cheerfulness, or forwarding by ready assistance the interests of
those, whether equals, inferiors, or superiors; with whom every
one happens to associate or reside: which constitutes the essential
part of what is termed politeness of manners; and universally
indicates a benevolent disposition.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">VERACITY.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the purpose of inculcating a love of truth early in life
the love of praise supplies the most certain means. This kind of
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
honour has an honest pride for it's basis: a story is related in one
of the modern volumes of the universal history of an inhabitant
of Constantinople, who was brought to the scaffold for denying
the divine mission of Mahomet; and on having a pardon offered
him, if he would then declare his error, answer'd, that he would
not speak an untruth to save his life. And, I think, it is re∣corded,
that one of the fathers of the church used to affirm, that
he would not tell a lie, were he sure to gain heaven by it.</P>
<P>I once heard an ingenious lady say to a company of her friends,
that her daughter, a young girl, who stood by with a counte∣nance
flush'd with pleasure, never told her a lie in her life: This
happy use of flattery was likely to produce a love for veracity,
which would never be destroy'd by interested motives.</P>
<P>The disgrace of telling a lie should be painted in vivid colours,
as totally destructive of the character of a lady or gentleman, ren∣dering
them contemptible in the eyes of the world: And the
inconvenience of this detestable habit of lying should be explain'd
from it's preventing their being believed, when they wish it; as is
exemplified in the fable of the shepherd-boy; who call'd out
“the wolf, the wolf,” so often to alarm his neighbours, and thus
to amuse himself, when no wolf was near; that when the real
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
wolf attack'd his flock, he could by no vociferation prevail on
any one to come to his assistance: Or like the village-drunkard,
who frequently amused himself with crying out “fire,” along
the streets on his return from the ale-house in the night, to the
great alarm of the neighbourhood; till at length, when his cot∣tage
was really in flames, his distress was not believed, and he
could gain no assistance to extinguish them.</P>
<P>This sincerity of character should be confirm'd by the example
of the governesses, who should themselves pay the most exact and
scrupulous attention to truth; they should not exaggerate trifling
errors into reprehensible faults; and, where reproof is necessary,
should give it with kindness: and should not only punctually ful∣fil
their own promises, tho' to their inconvenience, but exact the
same from their pupils in return.</P>
<P>To these should be added the precepts of religion, as
soon as their minds are capable of receiving them, which uniformly in∣culcate
truth and probity in all our words and actions.</P>

<HEAD>Section XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PRUDENCE, JUSTICE, CHASTITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE impressions on the mind made by recent examples
placed, as it were, before our eyes have so much more durable
effects, than the more abstracted ideas deliver'd in systems of
moral philosophy; that I believe the most efficacious method of
inculcating the virtue of prudence in respect to their own conduct
is by telling young people the ill consequences, which have
lately happen'd to others; whose persons or names they are ac∣quainted
with: so that a repetition of the slander of a town,
which always degrades the retailers, has sometimes it's advan∣tage
as a lesson to the hearers.</P>
<P>There is another kind of prudence, which it is necessary to
acquire in some degree, which arms the possessor against the ill
designs of others; hence they should be taught to beware of flat∣terers,
gamesters, drunkards, and of all ill-temper'd persons. As
this prudence is to be acquired by the knowledge of mankind,
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
such books as the maxims of Rochfoucault, and others, might be
recommended; but they give too gloomy a picture of human
nature to be put into the hands of young ladies.</P>
<P>“Know yourself” is a celebrated injunction, and may con∣stitute
one department of Prudence, when any one undertakes
some great action, or great change in the condition of life; but
“know other people” is equally necessary in passing along this
sublunary world, and may be inserted with propriety as another
maxim in the code of prudence. The facility of knowing
others in the daily intercourse of the world is produced by the
knowledge of physiognomy, acquired at schools in early life;
while the passions continue to be impress'd on the countenances
of children; and which is never so well acquired in private tui∣tion;
and thus constitutes one of the great advantages of school-education.</P>
<P>JUSTICE and CHASTITY, which are the principal links, by
which civilized society is held together, are to be inculcated in
young minds by similar methods; that is by pointing out by ex∣amples
the public punishment, or public disgrace, which certainly
accompanies the breach of either of these important duties: and

<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
capable of perceiving their force, to co-operate with the effect
of the laws of society, and of the opinion of the wife and
virtuous.</P>

<HEAD>Section XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FORTITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>IF female children are not treated with tenderness by a mother
in their early years of infancy, they are perhaps liable to acquire
a harshness of character, and an apparent unfeelingness, which
afterwards renders them less amiable; though it may give them
greater fortitude; which should therefore be inculcated at their
rather maturer years.</P>
<P>Neither the robust assailing courage, which prompts to the
performance of heroic actions, nor the ostentatious patience,
which requires the flattery of the public eye for its's support,
belong to the female character. But that serene strength of mind,
which faces unavoidable danger with open eyes, prepared to
counteract or to bear the necessary evils of life, is equally valu∣able
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
as a male or female acquisition. This is term'd presence of
mind; it depends on our judgment of the real value of things;
and on our application of those causes, which contribute to turn
disagreeable circumstances to the best advantage; and can there∣fore
only be acquired by the general cultivation of good sense and
of knowledge.</P>
<P>An occasional effusion of tears has been thought an amiable
weakness, and a mark of delicacy of the sex. When tears are
shed at the irremediable misfortunes of others, it indicates an
amiable sensibility; but when young ladies indulge themselves in
a promptitude of dissolving into incessant tears at every trivial
distress of their own, it shews a kind of infantine debility of
mind, and conveys an idea of their being unfit for the common
duties of life; and should therefore be discouraged by reasoning
on the kind and quantity of the evil, which disturbs them; and
by reciting to them the examples of fortitude exhibited by others
in disasters much more calamitous, of which there are examples
in the letters of Lady Russel: And lastly by reminding them of
the consolations of religion.</P>
<P>A slight appearance of timidity has been esteem'd another
mark of delicacy of the sex; but timidity is the companion of
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
debility of mind rather than of delicacy, and should not therefore
be encouraged. In respect to the expressions of fear the violent
cries and distorted countenances of some ladies in situations of
danger exhibit them in no very amiable attitudes; while they
increase the confusion, and may be said “to help the storm;”
but if to these be added an affectation of fear without cause; as
when a young lady screams through the whole gamut at the sight
of a spider, or a grass-hopper; the fault becomes voluntary, and
should be opposed and conquer'd by the shafts of ridicule.</P>
<P>Impudence in common language has been termed boldness;
and bashfulness has been ascribed to timidity; but neither of
them with sufficient precision; as brave men have been known
to be bashful, and cowards impudent. Assurance of counte∣nance
arises from the possessor of it rather over-valuing his own
abilities; and impudence consists in this assurance with a total
disregard of the opinions of others; but neither of them bear any
analogy to fortitude. On the other hand modesty arises from the
possessor of it rather under-valuing his own abilities; and bash∣fulness
consists in this modesty with great solicitude about the
opinions of others; but neither of them are attended with per∣sonal
fear. So charming is the appearance of this great sensibi∣lity
by adding a blush to the features of beauty, that no endea∣vours
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
should be used to extinguish it early in life. Nor should
any means be contrived to increase it to excess, as embarrassment
both of thought and action, and even impediment of speech, is
then liable to attend the great anxiety it occasions.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TEMPERANCE</HEAD>
<P>INCLUDES the subjugation of the appetites and passions to
reason and prudence; it consists in our moderation in the use of
all those things, which contribute to the convenience, comfort,
or enjoyment of life; as of food, dress, pleasures; and in the
restraining our licentious passions, as of anger, vanity, love, am∣bition.
The method to instil this virtue is by exhibiting the
various inconveniences, which attend unlimitted indulgence;
and thus to inculcate the golden rule of “nothing to excess.”</P>
<P>The example of the governess will have great effect in pro∣ducing
many of the virtues above mention'd in the minds of her
pupils. Justice in the most trivial circumstance must be carefully
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
and exactly done between children in respect to each other in
their little disputes at play. Moderation and self-government
should also constantly appear in the characters of those, who are
to teach these virtues to others.</P>

<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>THE precepts of religion are best taught by requiring the
young pupils regularly to attend such places of divine worship, as
their parents direct; and by reading on sundays select parts of the
holy scriptures, and some approved books of sermons; as those of
Blair, and a few others; and by inculcating the reasonableness of
daily thanksgiving, and the duty of daily prayer, to the great
author of all good.</P>
<P>The divine morality deliver'd in the new testament should be
repeatedly inculcated to an infant audience, who cannot so well
understand the metaphysical parts of religion, such as the duty
of doing to others as we would they should do unto us: to love
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
our neighbours as ourselves: to forgive injuries, not to revenge
them: and to be kind even to our enemies. For this purpose the
sermons of the old Whole duty of man are recommended; one of
which might be read every sunday evening.</P>
<P>Ladies of more mature years, or who have finished their
school-education, may learn the necessity and usefulness of our
excellent religion from Baron Haller's letters to his daughter,
from Lady Pennington's advice to her daughter, and lastly from
Mr. Gisborne's duties of the female sex: and the defence of the
truth of it may be learn'd from Mr. Paley's evidences of christi∣anity;,
but perhaps it is better for them not to perplex their
minds with many works of religious controversy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="23" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a fascinating manner in the address of some peo∣ple,
which almost instantly conciliates the good will, and even
the confidence of their acquaintance. Machiavel in his history
<PB N="61" REF="60"/>
of Castruccio Castricani observes; that his hero could assume
such openess of countenance; that though he was known to be
a man practised in every kind of fraud and treachery, yet in a
few minutes he gain'd the confidence of all, whom he conversed
with; they went away satisfied of his good will towards them,
and were betrayed to their ruin.</P>
<P>This enviable address, which may be used for good purposes
as well as for bad ones, may be difficult to analize; but may pos∣sibly
consist simply in a countenance animated with pleasure at
meeting and conversing with our acquaintance; and which dif∣fuses
cheerfulness by pleasurable contagion into the bosoms of
others; and thus interests them in our behalf. It is not the
smile of flattery, nor the smile of self-approbation, nor the smile
of habit, nor of levity; but it is simply an expression of pleasure,
which seems to arise at the sight of our acquaintance; and which
persuades them, that they possess our love, and for which they
barter their own in return.</P>
<P>However this conciliating manner may have been used, as
above related, for bad purposes; it probably proceeded originally
from friendliness and openess of heart, with cheerful benevo∣lence;
and that in those, who have in process of time become
<PB N="62" REF="61"/>
bad characters, the appearance of those virtues has remain'd, after
the reality of them has vanish'd. What then is the method, by
which this inchantment of countenance can be taught? certainly
by instilling cheerfulness and benevolence into the minds of
young ladies early in life, and at the same time an animation of
countenance in expressing them; and though this pleasurable ani∣mation
be at first only copied, it will in time have the appearance
of being natural; and will contribute to produce by association
the very cheerfulness and benevolence, which it at first only imi∣tated.
This is a golden observation to those, who have the care
of young children.</P>
<P>A very accomplish'd lady, who read the manuscript of this
work, wrote the following with her pencil on the opposite page:
“nothing can be more just and interesting than the whole of this
section; yet however desirable it may be to mend an unpleasant
<HI>abord,</HI> might one not suspect, since Nature has produced a diver∣sity
of manner, that an attempt to engraft this beautiful cheerful∣ness
on a grave set of features might produce the worst of evil
affectations? A natural simplicity of manner, whether serious or
gay, will always please; and probably this amiable address may
be rendered equally consistent with natural manners, whether se∣rious
or gay.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="24" TYPE="section">
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
<HEAD>Section XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the winning manners above described, the art of
pleasing in conversation seems to consist in two things; one of
them to hear well; and the other to speak well. The perpetual
appearance of attention, and the varying expression of the coun∣tenance
of the hearer to the sentiments or passions of the speaker,
is a principal charm in conversation; to be well heard and accu∣rately
understood encourages our companions to proceed with
pleasure, whatever may be the topics of their discourse.</P>
<P>Those, who have been educated at schools, and have learnt
the knowledge of physiognomy from their playfellows in their
early years, understand the pleasurable or painful feelings of all
with whom they converse, often even before their words are
finished; and, by thus immediately conforming the expression of
their own features to the sensations of the speaker, become the
interesting and animated companions above described, which is
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
seldom seen in those educated in private families; and which, as
before observed, gives a preference to school-education.</P>
<P>To speak agreeably in respect to manner consists in a voice
clear, yet not loud; soft, yet not plaintive; with distinct articu∣lation,
and with graceful attitudes rather than with graceful
actions; as almost every kind of gesticulation is disagreeable. In
respect to the matter it should be such, as coincides with the
tastes or pursuits of those, to whom the conversation is address'd.
From hence it will appear, that both to hear well, and to speak
well, requires an extensive knowledge of things; as well as of
the tastes and pursuits of mankind; and must therefore ultimately
be the effect of a good education in general, rather than a parti∣cular
article of it.</P>
<P>There are however faults to be avoided, and cautions to be
observed, in the conversation of young ladies; which should be
pointed out to them by the governess of a boarding school. Of
these I shall mention first, that whenever the thirst of shining in
conversation seizes on the heart, the vanity of the speaker be∣comes
apparent; and we are disgusted with the manner, what∣ever
may be the matter of the discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="64"/>
Secondly, that it is always childish, and generally ridiculous,
when young people boast of their follies, or when they accuse
themselves of virtues; neither of which they probably possess in
the degree, which they describe. A young lady was heard to
say, “I am frighten'd to death at the sight of a bird:” And
another, that she was so inconsiderate, as to give her money to
the poor naked children, whom she saw in the streets in winter.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they should be apprized, that there is danger in
speaking ill even of a bad person; both because they may have
been misinform'd, and because they should judge their neighbours
with charity. A friend of mine was once ask'd by a young man,
how he could distinguish, whether the lady, whom he meant to
address, was good temper'd; and gave this answer. “When any
dubious accusation is brought in conversation against an absent
person; if she always inclines to believe the worst side of the
question, she is ill-temper'd.” There are some nice distinctions
on this subject of good nature delivered in Lady Pennington's
advice to her daughters, p. 89, which are worth a young lady's
attention.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that it is dangerous for a young lady to speak very
highly in praise even of a deserving man; for if she extols his
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
actions, she will seem to give herself the importance of a judge,
and her determinations will sometimes be call'd in question; and
to commend highly the person of a man is in general estimation
inconsistent with the delicacy of the sex at any age.</P>
<P>Fifthly, young ladies should be advised not to accustom them∣selves
to the use of strong asseverations, or of a kind of petty
oaths, such as “upon my honour,” in their conversation; nor
often to appeal to others for the truth of what they affirm; since
all such strong expressions and appeals derogate somewhat from
the character of the speaker; as they give an intimation, that she
has not been usually believed on her simple assertion.</P>
<P>Sixthly, laughing vehemently aloud, or tittering with short
shrieks, in which some young ladies, who have left school, in∣dulge
themselves at cards or other amusements, are reprehensible;
as their dignity of character must suffer by appearing too violently
agitated at trivial circumstances.</P>
<P>Seventhly, an uniform adherence to sincerity in conversation
is of the first importance; as without it our words are but empty
sounds, and can no more interest our companions than the tinkling
of a bell. No artificial polish of manners can compensate for the
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
apparent want of this virtue, nor any acquirements of knowledge
for the reality of the want of it. Hence though the excess of
blame or praise of the actions of others may be imprudent or im∣proper
in the conversation of young ladies; as mentioned in the
third and fourth articles of this section; yet in these, as in all
other kinds of conversation, their opinions should be given with
truth, if given at all; but when the characters of others are con∣cern'd,
they should be delivered with diffidence and modesty.</P>
<P>Lastly, if at any time any improper discourse should be ad∣dress'd
to young ladies, which has a tendency to indecency, im∣morality,
or irreligion, they should be taught to express a marked
disapprobation both in words and countenance. So great is the
power of the softer sex in meliorating the characters of men;
that, if such was their uniform behaviour, I doubt not, but that
it would much contribute to reform the morals of the age; an
event devoutly to be wished, and which would contribute much
to their own happiness.</P>
<P>To these might be added many other observations from the
writers on female education, concerning a due respect in conver∣sation
to superiors, good temper to equals, and condescension to
inferiors. But as young ladies are not expected to speak with the
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
wisdom, or precision of philosophers; and as the careless cheer∣fulness
of their conversation, with simplicity of manner, and with
the grace, ease, and vivacity natural to youth, supplies it with
it's principal charms; these should be particularly encouraged, as
there are few artificial accomplishments, which could Compensate
for the loss of them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">EXERCISE.</HEAD>
<P>THE acquirements of literature, and of many arts, make the
lives of young people too sedentary; which impairs their strength,
makes their countenances pale and bloated, and lays the founda∣tion
of many diseases; hence some hours should every day be
appropriated to bodily exercises, and to relaxation of mind.</P>
<P>Such as tend to produce activity, and to promote the growth
of the person in respect to height, are prefer'd in the schools for
young ladies to those, which render the system more robust and
muscular.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="68"/>
Of these playing at ball, at shuttlecock, swinging as they sit
on a cord or cushion, and dancing, in the open air in summer,
and within doors in winter, are to be prefer'd. To these some
have recommended an exercise of the arms by swinging leaden
weights, which are call'd dumb bells; these should be very light,
if they be used at all, otherwise they load the spine of the back,
and render the shoulders thick and muscular, and rather impede
than forward the perpendicular growth of the person. The ring∣ing
of a real bell hung as is done in churches, or the frequent
drawing up of a weight by a cord over a pulley, with a fly-wheel
to prevent it's too hasty descent, would be an exercise, which
might be used with great advantage by young people; as it both
extends the spine, and strengthens the muscles of the chest and
arms.</P>
<P>Many other kinds of exercise have been recommended by
authors: Madam Genlis advises weights to be carried on the
head, as milk-maids carry their milk-pails; and even to add
weights to the soles of the shoes of children to strengthen, as she
supposes, the muscles of locomotion in walking or running. It
is evident, that carrying weights on the head must be injurious
to young people, especially where there is a tendency to softness
of the bones; as it may contribute to bend the spine by their pres∣sure,
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
and to impede the perpendicular growth of the body; and
the walking in weighted shoes may induce awkward gestures
without any adequate advantage.</P>
<P>There are other modes of exertion, which, though graceful in
themselves, are not allow'd to ladies by the fashion of this age
and country; as skating on the ice in winter, swimming in sum∣mer,
funambulation, or dancing on the streight rope: but walk∣ing
with a stately measured step occasionally, like the march of
soldiers, and reading aloud frequently rather in a theatric man∣ner,
as well as dancing and singing, will much contribute to
give strength and grace to the muscles of locomotion, and of
vocallity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">AIR.</HEAD>
<P>THE strength and activity of young people not only depends
on the perpetual exercise of their limbs, as described in the preced∣ing
sections, but on the purity of the air, which they breathe, and
<PB N="71" REF="70"/>
even on the occasional coldness of it. The cold air of winter
acts on delicate people like a cold bath; as it diminishes the action
of the subcutaneous vessels for a time, and thus produces an accu∣mulation
of animal power, whence an increased action of those
vessels and a consequent warmth of the surface of the body suc∣ceeds;
and by this less expenditure of animal power during im∣mersion
in cold air, and it's consequent accumulation, the per∣son
becomes stronger for a time and more animated; which is
termed in common language “bracing the system.” Hence to
strengthen delicate children they should be encouraged to go into
the cold air of winter frequently, but should not remain in it
longer than a quarter or half an hour at a time. In summer
young people can scarcely continue too much in the air, where
they are shaded from the heat of the sun.</P>
<P>A constant immersion in pure air is now known to contribute
much both to the health of the system, and to the beautiful co∣lour
of the complexion. And this atmosphere should undergo a
perpetual change and renovation; that the vital air, which con∣stitutes
about one-fourth part of it, may not be too much dimi∣nished
by frequent respiration. Due attention should be given to
this important circumstance both by frequently urging the young
ladies to amuse themselves out of doors; and by the proper venti∣lation
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
of the school-room, dining-room, bed-rooms, and their
other apartments. For this purpose it is convenient to saw off
about one inch from the top of every door of these crowded
rooms, and opposite to this aperture to nail along the top of the
door a tin plate about two inches wide, rising at an angle of about
forty-five degrees; which will bend the current of air up towards
the ceiling; where it will be mixed with the warm air of the
room, and sink down amongst the society without the danger of
giving cold to any one: And, besides these door-ventilators, the
upper sashes of every window should always be let down a few
inches, when the external weather will admit of it.</P>
<P>In respect to bed-rooms, which have more than one bed, the
doors should be furnished with similar ventilators for the due ad∣mission
of fresh air; and during the summer months a window
should be kept a few inches open during the night as well as the
day; the sash of which should have a bolt or other proper fasten∣ing
for this purpose; nor should the fire-place be stopt up at any
season by a chimney board, or a bag of straw; as many rooms are
made to shut up so close, that this is the only aperture, by which
fresh air is admitted. To this should be added, that the bed cur∣tains
should never be drawn close round the beds; which confine
the air spoil'd by frequent respiration, and the perspirable matter,
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
like a noxious atmosphere over the unconscious sleepers. At the
same time none of the beds should be placed very near either to
an open window, or to an open chimney, as a partial current of
air might be injurious by the coldness it might occasion.</P>
<P>In crowded bed-rooms, where children are close shut up for
eight or nine hours every night, not only the pale bloated com∣plexion,
which is seen in children of crowded manufactories; but
other diseases are produced by the impurity of the air, such as
indigestion, difficulty of breathing, and sometimes convulsive
fits, as mention'd in Zoonomia, vol. II. class iii. 1. 1. 5. and
lastly putrid fevers; of which fatal instances frequently occur in
the crowded habitations of the poor. Hence parents cannot be
too careful in inspecting the bed-rooms, and the beds of the
schools, to which they intrust their children; as not only their
present comfort, but their future health, and sometimes their
lives depend on this attention; as is further explain'd in the sec∣tion
on rheumatism.</P>
<P>Besides the due ventilation of rooms by a perpetual supply of
pure air in summer, something should be here said about the
manner of warming them in winter. As the quantity of air car∣ried
up a chimney is very great, owing to it's being render'd so
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
much lighter than the external atmosphere by the heat of the
fire, strong currents of cold air press into the room at every chink
of the doors and windows passing towards the fire; and are liable
to give catarrh, rheumatism, kibed heels, and swelled fingers to
those scholars, who are exposed to them. To lessen these currents
of cold air setting in at every aperture, the chimney should be
so contracted over the fire-grate, as to admit no more of the warm
air to go up it, than is necessary to carry up the smoke; and
hence much more of the warm air near the fire-place will rise
up to the ceiling; and descending, as it becomes cooler, in the
distant parts of the room, will form a kind of vertical eddy, and
warm the whole appartment; adding greatly to the heat pro∣duced
by the radiation from the fire.</P>
<P>To effect this Doctor Franklin recommended an iron or tin
plate to slide under the mantle-piece over the fire, so as to leave con∣tract
the aperture of the chimney to two or three inches in width,
all the length over the fire-grate. And lately Count Rumford
has accomplish'd the same purpose by a flat stone about twelve
inches broad, and eighteen inches high; which is rear'd upon
one end at the back of the fire-place, about eight inches above
the grate, and leans forward towards the mantle-piece, so as to
an aperture, three or four inches wide, and twelve or four∣teen
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>
inches long, over the front of the fire-place. The use of
both these contrivances is to contract the mouth of the chimney,
and thus to admit no more warm air up it, than is necessary to
convey the smoke. And the sliding iron plate in Franklin's plan,
and the end-reared stone in Rumford's plan, are designed to be
occasionally withdrawn for the admittance of the chimney-sweeper.
These are described in detail in the essays of Doctor
Franklin, and Count Rumford; and it is believed, that one-third
of the fuel may be thus saved, and the rooms be kept more
equally warm, and more salutary.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CARE OF THE SHAPE.</HEAD>
<P>DELICATE young ladies are very liable to become awry at
many boarding schools, this is occasion'd principally by their
being obliged too long to preserve an erect attitude, by sitting on
forms for many hours together. To prevent this the school-seats
should either have backs, on which they may occasionally rest
themselves; or desks before them, on which they may occasion∣ally
<PB N="76" REF="75"/>
lean. This is a thing of greater consequence, than may
appear to those, who have not attended to it; and who wish their
children to acquire a very erect attitude.</P>
<P>When the least tendency to become awry is observed, they
should be advised to lie down on a bed or sofa for an hour in the
middle of the day for many months; which generally prevents
the increase of this deformity by taking off for a time the pressure
of the head and neck and shoulders on the spine of the back; and
it at the same time tends to make them grow taller.</P>
<P>Young persons, when nicely measured, are found to be half
an inch higher in the morning than at night; as is well known
to those, who inlist very young men for soldiers. This is owing
to the cartilages between the bones of the back becoming com∣press'd
by the weight of the head and shoulders on them during
the day. It is the same pressure, which produces curvitures and
distortions of the spine in growing children, where the bones are
softer than usual; and which may thus be relieved by an hori∣zontal
posture for an hour in the middle of the day, or by being
frequently allow'd to lean on a chair, or to play on a carpet on
the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="76"/>
Young ladies should also be directed, where two sleep in a
bed, to change every night, or every week, their sides of the bed;
which will prevent their tendency to sleep always on the same
side; which is not only liable to produce crookedness, but also
to occasion diseases by the internal parts being so long kept
in uniform contact as to grow together. For the same rea∣son
they should not be allow'd to sit always on the same side
of the fire or window; because they will then be inclined too
frequently to bend towards one side; which in those constitutions,
where the bones are too soft, is liable to produce crookedness of
the spine.</P>
<P>Another great cause of injury to the shape of young ladies is
from the pressure of stays, or other tight bandages; which at the
same time cause other diseases by changing the form or situation
of the internal parts. If a hard part of the stays, even a knot of
the thread, with which they are sewed together, is press'd upon
one side more than the other; the child bends from the side,
which is uneasy, and thus occasions a curiviture of the spine.
To counteract this effect such stays, as have fewest hard parts,
and especially such as can be daily or weekly turn'd, are prefer∣able
to others. A wise fashion of wearing no stiff stays, which
<PB N="78" REF="77"/>
adds so much to the beauty of young ladies, has commenced
since the above was written; and long may it continue!</P>
<P>Where frequent lying down on a sofa in the day time, and
swinging frequently for a small time by the head, with loose
dress, do not relieve a beginning distortion of the back, I have
used with some success a swing for children to sleep in, as de∣scribed
in Zoonomia, vol. II. class I. 2. 2. 16. and also a crutch-chair,
as there delineated; and where these do not seem to suc∣ceed,
recourse may also be had to Mons. Vacher's spinal machine,
first described in the memoirs of the academy of Surgery in Paris,
vol. III. with a good print of it; and since made by Mr. Jones
in London, at No. 6, North-street, Tottenham-court Road;
which suspends the head, and places the weight of it on the
hips.</P>
<P>It will be from hence easily perceived, that all other methods
of confining or directing the growth of young people should be
used with great skill, such as back-boards, or bandages; and that
their application should not be continued too long at a time; least
worse consequences should ensue, than the deformity they are
designed to remove. Of these the stocks for the feet of children,
for the purpose of making them turn their toes quite out, and
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>
the frame for pressing in their knees, as they stand erect, at the
same time, I suspect, when carried to excess, to be particularly
injurious, and to have caused an irrecoverable lameness of the
hip-joint; as explain'd in Zoonomia, vol. II. class 1. 2. 2. 17.
These therefore should be used with proper caution, so as to give
no pain or uneasy feels, or not used at all.</P>
<P>To this it may be proper to add, that the stiff erect attitude,
taught by some modern dancing masters, does not contribute to
the grace of person, but rather militates against it; as is well
seen in one of the prints in Hogarth's analysis of beauty; and is
exemplify'd by the easy grace of some of the antient statues, as
of the Venus de Medici, and the Antinous; and in the works of
some modern artists, as in a beautiful print of Hebe feeding an
eagle, painted by Hamilton, and engraved by Eginton; and many
of the figures of Angelica Kauffman. And lastly, which is so
eminently seen in many of the beauties of the present day, since
they have left off the constraint of whale-bone stays, and assumed
the graceful dress of the ancient grecian statues.</P>
<P>In the tendency to curviture of the spine whatever strengthens
the general constitution is of service, as the use of the cold bath
in the summer months. This however requires some restriction
<PB N="80" REF="79"/>
both in respect to the degree of coldness of the bath, the time of
continuing in it, and the season of the year. Common springs,
which are of 48 degrees of heat, are too cold for tender consti∣tutions,
whether of children or adults; and frequently do them
great and irreparable injury, as I have witnessed in three or four
cases. The coldness of river water in the summer months,
which is about 65 degrees, or that of Matlock, which is about
68, or of Buxton, which is 82, are much to be prefer'd: The
two latter are improperly call'd warm baths, comparing their
degree of heat with that of common springs; whereas they are in
reality cold baths, being of much lower degree of heat than that
of the human body, which is 98. The time of continuing in a
cold bath should be but a few minutes; certainly not so long as
to occasion a trembling of the limbs from cold. In respect to
the season of the year, delicate children should certainly only
use cold bathings in the summer months; as the going fre∣quently
into the cold air in winter will answer all the purposes
of the cold bath.</P>
<P>Other means of counteracting the debility of the system, or
softness of bones, which occasion crookedness, consist in taking
internally from 10 to 20 grains of extract of bark, with as
much soda phosphorata, and mix'd with from five to ten drops
<PB N="81" REF="80"/>
of tincture of opium, twice a day for three or four weeks; as
is further treated of in Zoonomia, vol. II. class I. 2. 2. 14.
and 16.</P>

<HEAD>Section XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">DRESS.</HEAD>
<P>YOUNG Ladies should be instructed to shew attention to
their dress, as it gives an idea of cleanliness of their persons;
which has so great a charm, that it may be reckon'd amongst the
inferior virtues; for this purpose an elegant simplicity of dress is
to be recommended in preference to that superabundance of orna∣ment,
where the lady herself is the least part of her. The form
of dress must nevertheless perpetually vary with the fashion of the
time; but a person of taste may lessen those parts of a fashionable
dress, which oppose beauty or grace; and bring forwards those,
which are more coincident with them; so as to wear a dress in
fashion, and yet not devoid of taste.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="81"/>
Thus when large hoops were in general use, which so totally
militate with all ideas of beauty and grace; ladies of taste wore
them as small, as custom would allow. So in respect to the
ear-rings of the present day; since piercing the tender part of the
ear for the purpose of suspending a weight of gold, or of precious
stones, or of glass beads to it, reminds us of the savage state of
mankind; those ladies of taste, who think themselves obliged to
comply with this indecorous fashion, use the lightest materials, as
a chain of small pearls, to give a less distressing idea of the pain,
they seem to suffer at every motion of their heads. Hence also
long pendant and complicated ear-rings, however they may add
to the dignity of riper years by their costliness, are unbecoming to
young ladies; as they seem to give pain in the quicker, tho' more
graceful, motions of juvenility.</P>
<P>Sir Joshua Reynolds, I think, observes in one of his addresses
to the academy, that hard curls of hair stiffen'd with the fat of
hogs, and cover'd with the flower of wheat, cannot be admitted
into picture. The same may be observed of that coat of mail, the
whale-bone stays, the use of which is now so happily disconti∣nued.
Both of these, however they may conceal the grey hairs
and waining figures of those, who are advanced in life, are highly
injurious to the flowing locks and graceful forms of young ladies.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="82"/>
As beauty consists of lines flowing in easy curves according to
the analysis of Hogarth; those parts of dress, which are com∣posed
of such lines, are always agreeable. Thus a sash descend∣ing
from one shoulder to the opposite hip, or a grecian veil
thrown back and winding carelessly down behind, are always
beautiful; but a few white ostrich feathers rising on the head
before, and a train of silk sweeping on the ground behind, add so
much grace to a moving female figure, as to attract all eyes with
unceasing admiration.</P>
<P>In moving forwards the hair falls back, and in very swift
motion floats upon the air behind; hence by association of ideas,
when the hair is made to retire from the cheeks, it gives an inti∣mation
of the youthful agility of the person; and when it is
brought forwards over the cheeks, it may consent with unmoving
dignity, like the full wig of a judge, but diminishes our idea of
the activity of playful youth.</P>
<P>Where the appearance of use in dress can be given to orna∣ments,
it suggests an excuse for wearing them, and is therefore
to be prefer'd; as diamond pins, strings of pearl, and a comb of
shell, to restrain the exuberant hair; or knots of ribbons to fix the
slipper on the foot, to contract the sleeve around the arm, to unite
<PB N="84" REF="83"/>
the vest upon the bosom, or to attach the cap above the forehead.
And when these are similar in colour, it gives an air of simplicity,
and a kind of pyramidal form to the dress; which the painters so
much endeavour to exhibit both in their landscapes, and their
groups of figures.</P>
<P>Other ornaments, which bear no analogy to use in dress,
should be sparingly worn; least they give an idea, that they were
design'd to display the pride of the possessor, rather than to deco∣rate
her person. These are sometimes seen so ill placed as to
make deformities conspicuous, as a number of rings on fingers
distorted with the gout, or splendid buckles on turn'd-in feet.
Where there is no appearance of use, all shining ornaments should
be so disposed as to direct the eye of the beholder to some beau∣tiful
feature of the lady, who wears them; as diamond stars in
the hair, and artificial flowers on the bosom.</P>
<P>Paint and persumes are totally inadmissible in the dress of
young ladies, as they give a suspicion of natural defects in respect
to colour of the skin, and odour of the breath. Where there
exists but a mediocrity of beauty, and youth is in the wain, a
variety of pretty or of costly ornaments on the dress, and even
he whiteness of powder in the hair, may sometimes mingle with
<PB N="85" REF="84"/>
our idea of the person, and seem to render the whole fairer, more
pleasing, or more respectable. But ornaments of every kind are
useless or injurious to youthful beauty; they add no power to
the charm, but rather disenchant the beholder by abstracting his
attention; which dwells with undiminish'd rapture on beauty
array'd by simplicity, and animated without affectation. Thus
the majestic Juno of Homer is array'd in variety of ornament,
and with ear-rings, which have three large pendant bobs to each,
and commands universal homage. But his Queen of Beauty is
dress'd with more simple elegance, in her magic sash, or cestus,
and charms all eyes.</P>
<P>The attention to taste in dress may nevertheless be carried into
an extreme; it should not seem to be the most important part of
the education of a young lady; or the principal object of her care;
she should rather appear to follow than to lead the fashion, ac∣cording
to the lines of Mr. Pope,
<Q><L>Be not the first, on which the new are tried,</L>
<L>Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">AMUSEMENTS</HEAD>
<P>ARE generally distinguish'd from exercise, as they relieve or
exhilerate the mind. Cards may be occasionally used by chil∣dren
in private families, without their gaming for money; and
will in general facilitate their acquirement of arithmetic; but
cannot be allow'd in schools, least the young ladies should expend
too much time upon them, or should play for money clandes∣tinely.
But the game of chess, from its bearing so great analogy
to common life, is supposed much to improve the most useful
powers of the mind: It has the experience of the remotest anti∣quity
to recommend it, occasions no depraved passions, as it is
not play'd for money; and by the caution perpetually necessary
to watch your adversary, and the judgment required to contrive,
arrange, and manage your own affairs, employs and strengthens
every part of the understanding.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="86"/>
Embroidery, drawing, music, as well as the exercises of
dancing, swinging, playing at ball, and shuttlecock, should be
class'd amongst the amusements of young ladies; and should be
reciprocally applied to, either in the house or in the open air,
for the purpose of relieving each other; and of producing by such
means an uninterrupted cheerfulness of mind; which is the prin∣cipal
charm, that fits us for society, and the great source of
earthly happiness.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PUNISHMENTS. REWARDS. MOTIVES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the custom of many schools to use some kinds of punish∣ments,
which either give pain or disgrace to the delinquent, as a
fool's cap, or a meal of water gruel. The use of these are seldom
if ever necessary in schools for young ladies, and are always at∣tended
with disagreeable consequences, as they either diminish the
character of honour in the punish'd persons, sink their spirits, or
render them insensible to the opinions of others; or injure their
health: Insomuch that at some schools all that can be acquired
<PB N="88" REF="87"/>
can scarcely compensate the loss of cheerfulness, and degradation
of mind, or bad health, which their punishments produce.</P>
<P>Thus the sitting in the public school for an hour in a cap with
bells diminishes the sensibility of a child to the opinions of her
companions, and thus gradually destroys one of the greatest mo∣tives
to good actions, and of the greatest restraints from bad ones.
For the same reason reprimands and even admonitions should be
always applied in private, but applause or reward in public.</P>
<P>A meal of water gruel, given as a punishment instead of a
meal of animal food, so frequently had recourse to in some
boarding schools, I believe to have laid the foundation of incurable
debility. The diseases of debility, as scrophula, bronchocele,
softness of bones, and the consequent distortion of them, are very
common among the children of the poor in Derby, which on
examination, I believe to be owing to their food consisting chiefly
of gruel; or sometimes with milk, which has been twice skim'd,
so that it is totally deprived of it's most nourishing part; at other
times with weak salt broth, but seldom with solid animal food.
When broth is weak in respect to the quantity of fleshmeat boil'd
in it, it is the custom of cooks to add much salt to it to increase
the relish, which renders it still more injurious to weak children;
<PB N="89" REF="88"/>
as salt contains no nourishment, and by its stimulus increases the
action of the system; and by promoting great insensible or sensi∣ble
perspiration diminishes the strength of the child more, than
the small quantity of meat dissolved in the broth can counter∣balance.</P>
<P>2. How then are refractory children to be govern'd? certainly
by the superiority of the mind of the teacher over that of the
pupil. When a famous lady in Italy was put to the torture, and
question'd by what sorcery she had govern'd a princess of the fa∣mily
of Medici; she answered “by no sorcery, but by that
power, which superior minds possess over inferior ones.”</P>
<P>3. Besides the two circumstances, which so much govern the
great world, I mean hope of reward and fear of punishment; in
the microscosm of a boarding school blame and praise, if given
very sparingly, will be found strong motives to the little pupils
to perform their tasks well, and of more efficacy ten times, than
the meal of water gruel, or the disgrace of a cap and bells.
Esteem and disgrace are observed by Mr. Locke to be of all
others the most powerful incentives to the mind, when once it is
brought to regard them: And if once you can communicate to
children a love of credit, and an apprehension of shame, you have
<PB N="90" REF="89"/>
instill'd into them a principle, which will constantly act, and in∣cline
them to do right, tho' it is not the true source from whence
our actions ought to spring; which should be from our duty to
others and to ourselves.—See Essay on education; sect. 56, &amp;c.
where are many other valuable observations on this subject.</P>
<P>4. Emulation at seeing others excel, if properly managed is
another incitement to industry. But as this is liable to degenerate
into envy, it should rather be left to it's own operation, than be
promoted by pointing out the examples, which should be copied.
It is better to say, “your task is not done to-day so well as you
sometimes do it,” than to say, “your task is not done so well as
your sister's.” Since in the latter case envy, and it's consequence
hatred, may succeed; a thing of tenfold worse consequence than
the neglect of a thousand tasks.</P>
<P>5. Tho' some degree of flattery may be used with success in
teaching veracity to very young children, as mention'd in sect.
18. of this work, yet I think it should be used very rarely indeed,
and only on very important occasions, least it should become a
necessary motive of action, instead of moral duty; as observed in
Zoonomia, vol. II. class iii. 2. 1. 8. “The debility of the ex∣ertion
of voluntary efforts prevents the accomplishment of all the
<PB N="91" REF="90"/>
great purposes of life. This often originates from a mistaken
education; in which pleasure or vanity is made the immediate
motive of action, and not future advantage, or what is term'd
duty. This observation is of great value to those, who attend
to the early education of their own children.”</P>
<P>“I have seen one or two young married ladies of fortune, who
perpetually became uneasy, and believed themselves ill, a week
after their arrival in the country; and continued so uniformly
during their stay; yet on their return to London or to Bath im∣mediately
lost all their complaints; and this I observed to happen
to them repeatedly. All which I was led to ascribe to their being
in their infancy surrounded with menial attendants, who had flat∣tered
them into the exertions, which they then used. And that
in their mature years they became torpid for the want of this sti∣mulus,
and could not amuse themselves by any voluntary em∣ployment,
but required ever after to be flattered into activity; or
to be amused by others.”</P>
<P>6. Rewards have been given to children to excite their indus∣try
in the performance of particular tasks; these are certainly less
eligible motives to action than the fear of disgrace, the love of
reputation, and above all the obligations of duty. Where never∣theless
<PB N="92" REF="91"/>
these are thought proper, the kind of rewards requires
some attention; which should consist of books, or maps, or
boxes of colours, or needle cases; but not of money, or of trinkets
for ornamental dress, or of a glass of wine. Where money is
given as a reward for industry in children, it may seem to them
to be the proper motive of their actions instead of reputation or
of duty; and may thus induce the vice of avarice or of extrava∣gance.
Where a fine cap or gown is given as a reward of dili∣gence,
the pride of dress may be produced, and become their
great motive of action, instead of the love of reputation, or of
duty. And lastly, where a glass of wine is given as a reward for
industry, a child is taught to believe wine to be a most valuable
acquisition, and a perpetual desire of it even to intoxication may
be the consequence. I remember a wealthy farmer, who had
two drunken sons, tho' he was a sober man himself, who told
me, that he ascribed this great misfortune to his having occasion∣ally
given them in their early life a cup of ale as a reward for
their exertions.—See Locke on education, sect. 52, &amp;c.</P>
<P>7. A very accurate observer, who has long had the conduct
of schools of various kinds for the instruction of the youth of
both sexes, acquaints me, “That he has often with extreme
surprize observed a child make a greater progress in some one
<PB N="93" REF="92"/>
branch of education in three months, than another of similar
age, opportunity, capacity, and even apparently of equal applica∣tion,
has been able to effect in three years.” The same observa∣tion
has been made by others, but he adds, “That this might
probably arise from some trivial circumstance, which determined
the inclination of the fortunate student; and that it is possible,
that the means may sometime be discover'd of governing these
incidents, and thus producing a new, era in the art of education!”</P>
<P>Similar to this it has often been observed, that the first impres∣sions
made on our infant minds by accidental disgust, admiration,
or flattery, are the frequent causes of our antipathies or aversions,
and continue through life to bias our affections or mislead our
judgments. One of my acquaintance can trace the origin of many of
his own energies of action from some such remote
sources; which justifies the observation of M. Rousseau, that the
seeds of future virtues or vices are oftener sown by the mother
than by the tutor.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LISPING.</HEAD>
<P>LISPING is a defect of pronunciation occasion'd by children's
making use of the sound of the letter TH sibilant instead of the
letter S; as instead of “is it so,” they say “ith it tho.” To
break this habit they must be taught to pronounce the S, by put∣ting
the point of the tongue against the roots of the upper teeth;
and not to put it between their teeth as in pronouncing the TH.
This is easily accomplish'd by putting their own finger against the
point of the tongue, as it comes between their teeth, in at∣tempting
to pronounce the letter S, and pushing it back into the
mouth.</P>
<P>I once saw a young lady, who after she had left school, had the
habit of using occasionally, tho' not constantly, the guttural CH
instead of the letter S, which was uncommonly disagreeable to
english ears. She corrected this ill habit by being taught, as
<PB N="95" REF="94"/>
above, how to place the tongue in pronouncing the S, but not
without many trials and much attention for some weeks; as great
efforts and pertinacious industry are required to break any habit,
which has been long established.</P>
<P>Many children from the difficulty of speaking it are liable to a
defective pronunciation of the letter R; this is indeed almost ge∣neral
in some parts of Northumberland, and is said to be a sound
unknown in China; which obliged the catholic missionaries sent
thither by Louis the 14th to change the name of the virgin Mary,
from Maria into Malia, or from Mary into Mally. In speaking
the letter R the middle of the tongue is made to vibrate with
semivocal air; whereas in pronouncing L, the edges of the
tongue only vibrate; the Northumberland vernacular R is form'd
with sibilant air instead of semivocal air, or differs from the true
R, as S differs from Z. Both which should be explain'd to those
children, who have this imperfect pronunciation.</P>
<P>Among the lower orders of the people of London, who are
called Cockneys, the letter W is pronounced sibilant like the
German W, and not semivocal like our vernacular one; this
seems to resemble the sound of V to inattentive ears; and these
Cockneys, are thence supposed to use V instead of W, as Vomen
<PB N="96" REF="95"/>
and Vine, instead of Women and Wine. This defect is readily
conquer'd by teaching such children to give more vocal sound to
their W, by sounding it at first like OO.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">STAMMERING.</HEAD>
<P>THIS impediment of speech has generally for its remote cause
a too great diffidence, or bashfulness, join'd with an ambition of
shining in conversation; and for its immediate cause an interrupt∣tion
of the association of the initial letter of a word with the re∣mainder
of it. Which association is dissever'd by the ill-intro∣duced
sensation of awe, bashfulness, desire of shining, or fear of
not succeeding; and then violent voluntary efforts are in vain
employ'd to re-join the broken association, and give rise to vari∣ous
distortions of countenance, as explain'd in Zoonomia, vol. II.
class iv. 2. 3. 1.</P>
<P>That this impediment of pronunciation is altogether a disease
of the mind, and not of the organs of speech, is shewn by the
<PB N="97" REF="96"/>
stammerer being able to speak all words with perfect facility,
when alone, as in repeating a play; but begins to hesitate, if any
one approaches; or even if he imagines, that he is listen'd to.
Those words also are most difficult to him to pronounce, which he
is conscious, he cannot change for others, as when he is asked his
own name, or the names of other persons, or of places; and the
more so if he is aware, that the hearer is impatient to be inform'd,
and that he cannot conjecture the name, before it is spoken.</P>
<P>It requires great attention, and much time to overcome this
bad habit; they should be daily exercised in speaking single
words as in spelling; and when they hesitate or find difficulty in
announcing the beginning of a word, they should repeat it fre∣quently
aloud without the initial letter, and at length repeat it
with the initial letter in a softer tone.</P>
<P>Suppose the stammerer finds difficulty in speaking the word
“Paper,” and says p, p, p, p, repeatedly, but cannot join the a
after it. He must be taught to pronounce aper, aper, aper, with∣out
the initial p, for many successive times; and this aper should
be spoken aloud with more breath than common, as if an h
preceded it; and at length he should add in a softer tone the let∣ter
p to it.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="97"/>
This, together with an hourly attention to speaking and read∣ing
slowly, and practising in this manner every word, which is
not readily spoken, both in private and in company, I am inform'd
is the principle, on which those masters cure this impediment,
who make it a profession; and to this should be added a frequent
introduction to the society of strangers, in order to acquire less
agitation or anxiety about the opinions of others.</P>

<HEAD>Section XXXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">SQUINTING.</HEAD>
<P>THIS defect of vision, which is term'd strabismns, may fre∣quently
be conquer'd in children, if it be attended to early, be∣fore
it has been long establish'd by habit. In this deformity it
generally happens, that one eye is better than the other, which
induces the child to view objects with the best eye, and to hide
the center of the other behind the nose. This greater inirritabi∣lity
of one eye is often occasion'd, I suspect, in infancy, by tying
a bandage for too long a time over an eye, which has happen'd
to be slightly inflamed, and thus decreasing it's power of action
<PB N="99" REF="98"/>
by disuse; in the same manner the large muscles of the body
become weaken'd by long inaction; and the right arm is generally
stronger than the left from it's having been more frequently ex∣ercised.</P>
<P>In this case if the best eye be for an hour or two, or longer,
cover'd every day with gauze stretch'd upon a circular piece of
whale-bone, so as to render the vision of this eye as
indistinct as that of the other, the child will naturally turn them both to the
same object, and in a little time the weak eye will become
stronger by being used, or the strong one weaker by disuse, and
the child will cease to squint.</P>
<P>Another kind of squinting is owing intirely to a bad habit, and
consists in looking at objects with one eye only at a time. The
owl bends both his eyes upon the object, which he observes; and
by thus perpetually turning his head to the thing he inspects, ap∣pears
to have greater attention to it; and has thence acquired the
name of the bird of wisdom. All other birds, I believe, look at
objects with one eye only, but it is with the eye nearest the ob∣ject
attended to; whereas in this kind of strabismns the person
attends to objects with the most distant eye only. This habit
has probably been produced, by a cap worn in infancy, which
<PB N="100" REF="99"/>
projected forward beyond the head on each side, like the bluffs
of a coach-horse, so as to make it easier for the child, as he lay in
his cradle, to view oblique objects with the eye most distant from
them; which kind of cap is therefore to be avoided.</P>
<P>A curious case of this ill habit of vision is related in the Philos.
Transact. vol. 68. by Dr. Darwin; which was relieved by fixing
a parchment gnomon on the nose of the little boy; which pro∣jected
about an inch from the ridge of it, and caused him for a
time to view oblique objects with that eye, which was nearest
them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">INVOLUNTARY MOTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>BY confinement in a school-room for many successive hours,
and that without being suffer'd to vary their posture, some of the
more active and lively children are liable to gain tricks of invo∣luntary
actions, as twitchings of the face, restless gesticulations
of the limbs, biting their nails, &amp;c. which are generally at first

superfluous animal power, like the jumping of a squirrel in a

<P>To prevent this kind of deformity children should be suffered
to change their attitudes and situations more frequently; or to
walk about, as they get their lessons. To counteract it the
earliest attention is necessary; as a few weeks frequently establish
a bad habit, which cannot be removed without great difficulty:
This however may be effected early in the disease by a bandage
nicely applied on the moving muscles, or by adhesive plasters put
tightly over them; or by an issue placed over them, so as to give
a little pain, when the muscles are thrown into action under it.</P>

of these complaints is generally owing to the coldness of a brick

and stockings, after walking in the wet; and the former to their
being kept too long from the fire in the cold parts of the school-room

<P>Nothing prevents or cures these maladies but a due attention
to keep the extremities of delicate children warm, either by
clothing, exercise, or fire. The inflammation of the heels or
toes may be sometimes removed by covering them with a double
linen rag moistened in a saturnine solution made by dissolving half
an ounce of sugar of lead in half a pint of water, to be renew'd
morning and night. As the swelling of the fingers thus pro∣duced
is liable to continue, and to injure the shape of them, it

afterwards diminish'd or removed by the frequent application of
vitriolic Ether to them.</P>
<P>The skin of the lips, and of the hands and arms of children is
liable to become inflamed, and chopp'd, or rough, in frosty wea∣ther,

former is relieved by the application of a lip-salve made by mix∣ing
minium or fed lead with spermaceti and oil to a proper con∣sistance;

leathern gloves, the inside of which is smear'd with spermaceti
soften'd with a little oil, or with pomatum; gloves thus prepared
prevent too great exhalation from the skin in frosty air, and the
consequent too great dryness and roughness of it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">BEDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE rheumatism, and other inflammatory diseases, are fre∣quently
occasion'd in crowded schools by placing some of the
beds with one side against a wall; where the weaker child con∣fined
by a stronger bedfellow is liable to lie for hours together
with some part of it in contact with the cold wall; which in the
winter months has often been attended with fatal consequences;
and especially in those boarding schools, where the beds are
small, and but one blanket allow'd to each of them, and a scanty
feather-bed.</P>
<P>We are indued with a very accurate sense to distinguish heat
and cold, which should be nicely attended to; as the extremes of
<PB N="104" REF="103"/>
both of them are injurious to our health, and more so in our
sleeping than in our waking hours. The extreme of heat is not
much experienced in this climate, except when it is artificially
produced; but that of cold is the cause of numerous diseases of
the most fatal tendency. A severe continued frost may be borne
by the strong, who can keep themselves warm by their activity,
but is destructive to the weak and sedentary. In the year 1795
the weather in January, and in one week of February was un∣commonly
severe; the same five weeks in January and February
1796 were uncommonly mild; and it appears by the bills of
mortality in London, that 2823 people died in these five weeks
of frost in 1795; and that only 1471 died in the same five weeks
of mild weather in 1796, which is not much more than half the
number.—See a paper by Dr. Heberden in Philos. Transact. For
the year 1796.</P>
<P>Some misinform'd parents have conceived, that a hard bed con∣tributes
to harden their children in respect to their bearing cold,
and have on that account laid them on straw-mattresses, or on beds
with boarded bottoms. The only difference between lying on a
soft or hard bed consists in this; the weight of the body in the
former case presses on a larger surface, and in the latter on a less;
neither of which has any reference to the habits of tenderness or
<PB N="105" REF="104"/>
hardiness in respect to cold and heat; unless indeed a feather-bed
is so soft, that, as the child sinks down in the middle of it, the
rising edges bend over him, and in part cover him. Perhaps
beds made of soft leather properly prepared, and inflated with
air, as the Emperor of Germany was said to use in camp, might
be preferable on this account to feather-beds.</P>
<P>The beds for young children cannot therefore be too soft,
however they may contribute to the indolence of grown people,
provided they do not keep them too warm by bending over them
as above described. But the too great hardness of beds is, I believe,
frequently injurious to the shape of infants by occasioning them
to rest on too few parts at a time; which hardens those parts by
pressure, and prevents their proportionate growth. It also occa∣sions
their sleep to be less sound by the uneasiness it causes, and
in consequence less refreshing.</P>
<P>The feet and knees and hands of weaker children are liable to
become cold in bed in winter, on which account it is more salu∣tary
for them to sleep with a bed-fellow, rather than alone; as
they then naturally put their cold knees or hands to their compa∣nion
in bed, and thus frequently prevent rheumatic, and other
inflammatory diseases of fatal event. For the same reason it is
<PB N="106" REF="105"/>
better for a new-born infant to sleep with it's mother in winter,
or with a young nurse, than in a solitary crib by her bed-side;
unless the artificial warmth of the room be more nicely graduated,
than is commonly done.</P>
<P>For the same reason, where children are too feeble from illness,
a fire should be allow'd in their bed-chamber in cold weather; as
the cold air is otherwise injurious to their lungs, which cannot be
clothed so as to prevent the contact of the air, like the other parts
of the body; a fire contributes also to ventilate a room, and to
circulate the air in it, and thence to render it more salutary; but
it should not warm it to more than 60 or 65 degrees, that it's
temperature may not differ too much from that of the external
atmosphere; as those, who are kept generally too warm, are liable
to take cold at every blast of air, not from the degree of cold, to
which they happen to be exposed, but to it's difference from that,
which they have been accustomed to.—See sect. xxvi.</P>
<P>The universal analogy derived from other animals, which pro∣duce
a feeble offspring, evinces the truth of this doctrine, both
in respect to the softness, and the due degree of warmth of their
beds: Birds line the nests for their young with feathers; the
cider duck, and the rabbit, pluck the down from their own
<PB N="107" REF="106"/>
breasts to increase the softness of the beds for their tender off-spring;
and brood them with their wings, or clasp them to their
bosoms for the sake of warmth.</P>
<P>The number of hours required for salutary sleep is greater for
younger children, than for those more advanced; as during our
progress through life we acquire greater facility in using our vo∣luntary
power, and recruit it in less time when exhausted. The
younger classes of scholars may go to rest at seven, or eight; but
the elder should be allowed another hour for the purposes of read∣ing
or other kinds of improvement; the hour of rising must vary
with the season.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="37" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">DIET.</HEAD>
<P>MILK is the food designed by nature for young animals, and
should be given them in it's recent state. As the cream is the
most nourishing part of the milk, and is easier of digestion than
the coagulable or cheesy part; and as milk constitutes a principal
<PB N="108" REF="107"/>
portion of the aliment of children; to take off the cream once,
or even twice, as is practised in some boarding schools, before it
is given to the children, is a shameful circumstance of parsimony,
and very injurious to their healths.—See sect. xxx, on punish∣ments.</P>
<P>Nor should the milk given to children be long kept in a boil∣ing
heat; because much of it's fragrant oil is then evaporated, as
is evident from the fine odour of the steam of it, when taken
from the fire; and it's further deterioration from long boiling is
shewn by it's then inducing constipation, which is contrary to
it's effect in it's recent and natural state.</P>
<P>Nevertheless even new milk does not always agree with chil∣dren,
after they have pass'd the years of infancy. For milk taken
into the stomach must be always previously curdled or coagulated,
before it can be digested, or converted into nourishment: Hence
milk is always found curdled in the stomachs of calves, and the
acid juice of their stomachs is used to coagulate the milk in the
process of cheese-making: Now the stomachs of young children
abound more with this acid juice than in their riper years, and
when a sufficient quantity of it is not produced for the purpose
of curdling the milk, which they drink, it is liable to disagree.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="108"/>
To these few therefore, whose stomachs do hot easily digest
the coagulable part of milk, other fluid food should he allow'd to
breakfast, as gruel, or tea with cream and sugar in it, and with
bread and butter; and to supper, a slice of cold meat, or of cheese,
or tart, or bread and butter, with small beer or water for drink;
but it is probable, that milk might be made to agree with all
stomachs, if it was previously curdled by rennet, as I have often
recommended with success to elderly persons; or by letting it
stand, till it becomes spontaneously sour like buttermilk, as is the
custom of the inferior people of Scotland; except nevertheless
where the distaste of the child is owing to prejudice or caprice,
which is then incurable but by time.</P>
<P>For dinner animal food plain dress'd, with vegetables or bread,
and pudding of wheat flour, milk, and eggs, with sugar or but∣ter,
are more nourishing than vegetable sustenance alone. Wheat
flour contains more nutriment than that of rice, or barley, or oats;
as it possesses more starch in proportion to it's bulk, and a gluten
approaching to animal matter. But much salt or spice should not
be allow'd in the diet of children, as they are certainly unwhole∣some
by inducing a weakness of the capillary and absorbent sys∣tems
of vessels in consequence of their too great stimulus, and
contain no nourishment.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="109"/>
As butter and sugar are perhaps the most nutritive of animal
and vegetable substances, they may be more easily taken to ex∣cess;
on which account some mistaken parents have totally pro∣habited
the use of them; which is a great disadvantage to weaker
children, who require more nutritive diet in less bulk than
stronger ones.</P>
<P>For the drink of the more robust children water is preferable,
and for the weaker ones, small beer; but in this, as well as in
the choice of solid food, their palates should be consulted; for the
nice discernment of this sense is bestow'd on us by nature to dis∣tinguish,
what the stomach can best digest. It should however
be observed, that in artificial viands the taste cannot distinguish,
what is unwholesome; as sugar may be mix'd with arsenic. So
in the drinking of fermented liquors, as ale or wine, which are
chemical productions, the palate is not to be consulted; a glass
of meer wine should never be given to children, as it injures their
tender stomachs like a glass of brandy or rum or gin to a grown
person; and induces those diseases, which it is often erroneously
given to prevent; as weakness of digestion, with the production
of worms in consequence. Wine nevertheless diluted with thrice
it's quantity of water may be allow'd, if required, instead of small
beer; or ale or cider diluted with thrice their quantities of water.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="110"/>
Ripe fruits, or fruit pies, are peculiarly serviceable to the con∣stitutions
of children, as well as agreeable to their palates; as they
are known to prevent biliary concretions, and consequent jaun∣dice;
and on the same account to render the skin clearer and
fairer, as well as to counteract the tendency to putrid diseases.
These should therefore be allow'd to children at all seasons; and
may either occasionally constitute a part of their diet; or may be
recommended to them, when they lay out part of their pocket-money
with hucksters, in preference to seed-cakes, gingerbread,
or sugar-plumbs; the former of which are generally made of bad
flour deteriorated by spice; and the latter are liable to be colour'd
with gamboge, vermillion, verdigrease, or other noxious drugs.</P>
<P>Too long fasting, or food of less nourishment than they have
been accustomed to, are peculiarly injurious to children; as they
weaken their power of digestion, impair their strength, and im∣pede
their growth. The children of the inferior poor, and of
families, which have adopted some ill-advised rules of abstemious
diet, are frequently starved into the scrophula, and become pale-faced
and bloated, owing to deficiency of the quantity of blood,
and to want of sufficient stimulus to the absorbent system.</P>
<P>If young people are thought to be too corpulent, a diminution
<PB N="112" REF="111"/>
of food with an increase of exercise, when they have obtain'd
their full growth, may be used with advantage; but even then
not without caution. Since young ladies, after they have left
school, who by ill advice use too great abstinence, are liable to
become pale and emaciated, and to fall into universal debility;
which remains through a diseased and comfortless life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ECONOMY.</HEAD>
<P>1. A Due regard to the prudent expenditure of their money,
a proper care of their clothes, and a parsimonious attention to
the lapse of time, should be inculcated into the minds of young
ladies. To effect these purposes one efficacious method, where
the usual exhortations fail, may be to suffer their imprudence to
produce some inconvenience to themselves; which they should
be permitted to feel to a proper degree.</P>
<P>Thus a profuse unnecessary expenditure of their pocket money
will shortly induce poverty; which should by no means be alle∣viated
<PB N="113" REF="112"/>
by a fresh supply of money; till the inconvenience pro∣duced
has effected a conviction of the impropriety of their con∣duct.
Except when the expenditure has been made for some
laudable purpose, and then no time should be lost in restoring the
power of repeating it.</P>
<P>The same means may be used in respect to their omission to
take care of their clothes; they should find the necessity of re∣pairing
them with their own hands, or of foregoing some visit∣ing
amusements, till new ones can be procured; that thus the
consequent inconvenience may teach them economy, if they are
otherwise too inattentive to the usual admonitions on these sub∣jects.</P>
<P>In respect to the economy of time the hours of amusement and
of exercise should be regularly counted; and the length of time
young ladies employ in dressing should be nicely attended to; as
in adult life the hours consumed at the toilet of some ladies is
perfectly ridiculous, and detains them from more important
duties. Perhaps a stated time might be allow'd the young ladies
for adjusting the articles of their dress, that they might acquire
a habit of disposing them with neatness, taste and elegance, and
yet with expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="113"/>
2. Men are generally train'd from their early years to the
business or profession, in which they are afterwards to engage;
but it most frequently happens to ladies, that tho' destined to the
superintendance of a future family, they receive scarcely any
previous instruction; but begin this important office with a pro∣found
ignorance of the value of money, and of the proper appli∣cation
of the things, which surround them.</P>
<P>Many young ladies destitute of mothers, and without a home,
are continued at school to a later age; such should be form'd into a
class, and properly instructed in domestic economy; each of them
superintending the business of the family, a week or a month by
turns; not only providing for the table, and directing the cookery,
but they should also be taught other parts of domestic employ∣ment,
as cutting out linens, and making them up with plain and
strong needle-work, either for their own families, or to be given
as clothing for necessitous infants or mothers.</P>
<P>Such an addition of domestic knowledge and benevolent in∣dustry
to ornamental accomplishments would give the school,
that procures it, a decided advantage over other schools, which
have no such institution.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="section">
<PB N="115" REF="114"/>
<HEAD>Section XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">SCHOOL-EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE advantages of a school-education, where twenty or
thirty children are properly instructed, over that in a private fa∣mily
are derived from several sources. First, it must be observed,
that almost all our exertions in early life are owing to our imi∣tating
others; in childhood we are most liable to imitate the
actions of those, who are somewhat older than ourselves; and in
manhood, of those we are in somewhat higher life; whence the
general prevalence of fashion in dress and manners. Now there
are more examples to cause this imitative activity in well con∣ducted
schools, and the children in consequence become more
active in the pursuit of their studies, and in the acquirement of
their accomplishments.</P>
<P>It may be added, that not only children, before they have acquired
the use of reason, or voluntary deliberation, but that the greatest
part of adult mankind learn all the common arts of life by imi∣tating
<PB N="116" REF="115"/>
others; and that even dumb creatures seem capable of ac∣quiring
knowledge with greater facility by imitating each other,
than by any methods, by which we can teach them. Thus dogs,
when they are sick, learn of each other to eat grass as are emetic;
and cats to moisten their paws for the purpose of washing their
faces. And the readiest way to instruct all brute animals is by
practising them with others of the same species; which have
already learnt the arts, we wish them to acquire, as explain'd in
Zoonomia, vol. I. sect. 22. 3.</P>
<P>A second advantage of schools, when well conducted, is, that
children often take pleasure in teaching each other, insomuch
that at boy's schools I have often observed, that the lower classes
have learnt more from their school-fellows of the higher classes,
than even from their masters; which has sometimes arisen from
the friendship, or vanity of the elder boy, and sometimes from the
solicitation of the lower one; but has in all cases been advan∣tageous
to both of them.</P>
<P>A third superiority of school-education arises from an emula∣tion,
which naturally exists, where many pursue the same studies,
but which should not be encouraged by rewards or degradations;
as it then may degenerate into envy or hatred; but should in ge∣neral
<PB N="117" REF="116"/>
be left intirely to it's own operation; as mention'd in
sect. xxx.</P>
<P>A fourth advantage of school-education is from the children
acquiring a kind of practical physiognomy; which renders them
more intelligent, and more interesting companions; and is of
greater consequence in our passage through life, than almost any
single accomplishment, as explain'd in sect. vi. and sect. xxiv. of
this work.</P>
<P>Fifthly, where languages are learnt by conversation, as is ge∣nerally
practised in teaching the french language, a school-edu∣cation
properly conducted is much superior to that of a governess
in a private family. And languages are so much easier taught to
children by conversation than by the abstract rules of grammar,
that Mr. Locke is solicitous to have the latin and greek languages
taught by conversation in boys' schools; and thinks the time of
learning words might thus be much shorten'd, which now occu∣pies
seven or eight years; part of which might be much better
employ'd in acquiring the knowledge of things.</P>
<P>The Philosopher, who despising the goods of fortune said,
“he was rich, though he carried about with him every thing,
<PB N="118" REF="117"/>
which he possess'd,” meant to assert, that strength of mind join'd
with strength of body, were superior to any other advantages of
life. A good education furnishes us with this inestimable trea∣sure;
it accompanies us at home, travels with us abroad; delights
us in solitude, graces us in society; comforts us in misfortune,
guards us in prosperity; contributes to the happiness of others,
and ensures our own.</P>

if I had myself been better acqainted, with them, the collection
would probably have been less numerous.</P>

<HEAD>APOLOGY FOR THE WORK.</HEAD>
<P>THE foregoing treatise was written at the desire of Miss S. and Miss M. Parker;
who were themselves educated for the purpose of educating others; and on that account
were originally placed in different seminaries for female tuition; and afterwards en∣gaged
themselves for a time as teachers in other schools, and in private families; the
better to qualify themselves for the arduous task of conducting a boarding school for
the education of young ladies.</P>
<P>About four years ago a house was offered to sale at Ashborne in Derbyshire, at the
very extremity of the town, in a most pleasant and healthy situation, on a dry sandy
soil, with excellent water, well shelter'd from the north-east, and commanding an
extensive prospect of Sir Brooke Boothby's park, and it's beautiful environs; through
which are pleasant walks at all seasons of the year; and of which an engraved plate
was presented to me by Sir Brooke Boothby as a frontispiece to this work.</P>
<P>A spacious walled garden adjoins the house at the bottom of which is a stream of
water, winch may sometime be converted into a river-bath.</P>
<P>Miss PARKERS procured this eligible situation, and had the house well fitted up
for the purposes of a boarding school. It consists of an ample school-room, and an
ample dining-room, and four smaller parlours, on the principal floor; with two stair-cases,
one of which is of stone. The whole is airy and well lighted; and now con∣tains
about thirty pupils without being crowded.</P>
<P>They next had the good fortune to engage very excellent teachers in dancing,
music, and drawing, from Nottingham, Derby, and Lichfield, with a polite emigrant
as French-master; and lastly applied to me for any ideas, I could furnish them with,
on the subject of female education. And now, as their establishment has succeeded to
their utmost wish, have expressed a desire, that I would give to the public, what I
wrote originally for their private inspection.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that a copy of the manuscript has been seen by many of the
ingenious of both sexes, and much improved by their observations; to whom I here
beg leave to return my most grateful acknowledgments.</P>
