<HEAD>TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Author of these Scenes always propos'd to do him∣self the Honour of addressing
<PB REF="3"/>
them to the Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> And when he perceiv'd himself just quitting the Stage of this Life, and retiring beyond the Reach of the Smiles or Frowns of Princes; his Veneration even then of your Royal Highness's exalted and most amiable Quali∣ties was so intense and strong, that he solemnly enjoin'd me to perform this Duty for him. For as he was always remarkably de∣voted to the Cause of Liberty and Justice, (for the Advancement of which the following Piece was written) he thought it would be a kind of Injury, not to conse∣crate it to the most illustrious Patron of Justice, Heroick Vir∣tue,
<PB REF="4"/>
and the Rights of Man∣kind. Your Royal Highness's great Condescension in permit∣ting me to execute the Will of my departed Friend, and in pa∣tronizing his Orphan Play, is a Circumstance that is very glori∣ous to him, and gives a Sancti∣on to his Fame.</P>
<P>All true <HI>Englishmen</HI> in general, as well as the Friends of Mr. <HI>Lillo</HI> in particular, have great Reason to congratulate one another on the Protection which your Royal Highness was graciously pleas'd to afford this Piece during the Per∣formance of it. For to see the Heir Apparent of these Kingdoms so generously countenancing a
<PB REF="5"/>
Tragedy, in which the Cha∣racter of a Righteous King, who founds all his Glory on the Li∣berty and Happiness of his Sub∣jects, is drawn in such strong and lively Colours, must give a very sensible Pleasure to the whole Nation: It serves to keep alive the Hopes which the Pub∣lick has long since conceiv'd, and is an undoubted Pledge, of many future Blessings from your auspicious Influence.</P>
<P>Your Elegancy of Taste, and Illustrious Virtues render you the most generous Protector and the noblest Theme of all who cultivate the politer Arts; as the continual Overflowings of
<PB REF="6"/>
your Bounty towards all Ob∣jects of Distress daily endear you to every Heart that has any Feelings of Humanity: This your Princely Heavenly Disposition is universally felt and acknowledg∣ed, and consider'd with all its Circumstances without a Pa∣rallel.</P>
<P>That your Royal Highness may long continue the Muni∣ficent Encourager of Arts and Letters, an Example to Princes of public Spiritedness, Huma∣nity, and Condescension, is the ardent Wish of every honest <HI>Briton:</HI> For notwithstanding all our Divisions, the Voice of the whole Nation is unanimous in
<PB REF="7"/>
praying for your Life, Honour, and Prosperity: And this we should do from Motives of In∣terest and Self-love, were we not impell'd to it by Gratitude and Duty.</P>

<L>NO labour'd Scenes to Night adorn our Stage,</L>
<L><HI>Lillo</HI>'s plain Sense wou'd here the Heart engage.</L>
<L>He knew no Art, no Rule; but warmly thought</L>
<L>From Passion's Force, and as he felt he wrote.</L>
<L>His <HI>Barnwell</HI> once no Critick's Test cou'd bear,</L>

<L>Deprest by Want, afflicted by Disease,</L>
<L>Dying he wrote, and dying wish'd to please.</L>

<L>Not all the gaudy pleasures I once courted,</L>

<L><HI>Ismena</HI> at this instant leaves the court:</L>
<L>No hope is left, no patience—I'm distracted.</L>
<L>The subtle tyrant Love, who led me long</L>
<L>Through flow'ry paths, and spread elysium round me;</L>

<L>Her pride and virtue are meer accidents:</L>

<L>Forbear such wild and unbecoming thoughts:</L>
<L>The <HI>Palatine</HI> is Regent, you a stranger,</L>

<L>You owe her birth and rank, may satisfy</L>

<L>Love may perhaps inspire your soothing tongue</L>
<L>With eloquence to soften, and persuade</L>
<L>The melting Fair to break her resolution,</L>

<L>By laws divine and human, be pronounc'd</L>
<L>A crime deserving death, the guilty Queen</L>
<L>Drew on herself the justice I inflicted.</L>
<L>Her wicked agent <HI>Conrade</HI>, her vile brother,</L>
<L>Who stain'd the purity of my <HI>Ismena</HI>,</L>
<L>Is left to prove your justice.

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>K.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Can it be!</L>
<L>Thy lovely, chaste <HI>Ismena!</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Elm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>She, my wife.</L>
<L>Lovely she was, and chaste; and not less worthy</L>
<L>That just regard the meanest may pretend to,</L>
<L>I trust, for being mine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Conr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Evasive traitor!</L>
<L>Say for what cause, with impious prophanation,</L>
<L>You dar'd attempt your master's sacred bed;</L>
<L>And I may deign to answer to your charge.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>K.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Is this the court of <HI>Buda?</HI> This vile stage</L>
<L>Of lewdness, death, and black recrimination?</L>
<L>Of what a sudden growth is rank corruption!</L>
<L>That, during my short absence, hath infected</L>
<L>My house and throne, those I most loved and trusted.</L>
<L>—But bring the clearest proof of this foul charge</L>
<L>Against my Queen and brother, or expect</L>
<L>The self same mercy thou hast shewn to her:</L>
<L>Whom, if thy accusation be unjust,</L>
<L>Thou'st basely murder'd twice.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Elm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>I have the strongest proofs,</L>
<L>My wife's accusing tears, who cou'd not forge</L>
<L><PB N="68" REF="67"/>To her own ruin and to my dishonour</L>
<L>A tale so full of shame. But more, the Queen,</L>
<L>The Queen herself, triumphant in her malice,</L>
<L>Confest it to my face, and gloried in it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>K.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>And will <HI>Ismena</HI> vouch it?—I think highly</L>
<L>Of your Wife's truth;—so did I of <HI>Matilda</HI>'s—</L>
<L>I'll not condemn her on a single witness:</L>
<L><HI>Ismena</HI> is but one, thy word is nothing.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Elm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>I have yet farther Proofs. Peruse this scroll,</L>
<STAGE>(<HI>Giving the King a Paper.</HI>)</STAGE>
<L>This full avowal of the hellish deed,</L>
<L>Witness'd by these who both were actors in it,</L>
<STAGE>(<HI>Pointing to</HI> Belus <HI>and</HI> Zenomira.)</STAGE>
<L>Without designing ill, which I produce</L>
<L>With strong reluctance, as it speaks a weakness</L>
<L>Of the lost Queen, which I wou'd fain conceal.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>K.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Why shou'd I tremble thus? Let truth appear,</L>
<L>And shame light where it will.
<STAGE>(<HI>Reads</HI>)</STAGE></L>
<L>Madness and death!</L>
<L>Confess a guilty passion for the Regent!—</L>
<L>Can these things be!—That dignity of spirit,</L>
<L>That high demeanour stoop to such dishonour!—</L>
<L>How shall I credit—what I can't reject?</L>
<L>How root out fixt ideas from a heart</L>
<L><HI>Matilda</HI> fill'd, and bend it to conviction?—</L>
<L>O <HI>Elmerick!</HI> I see the pois'nous source</L>
<L>Of our united woes.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Elm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Her will refus'd,</L>
<L>She offer'd at her Life—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Conr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>This claims attention.
<STAGE>(<HI>Aside.</HI>)</STAGE></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Elm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Which while I strove to save, her brother enter'd;</L>
<L>And, by her art deceiv'd, attempted mine:</L>
<L>The rest that paper speaks.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Conr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Too fatal truth!</L>
<L>'Twas gallant in him then not to accuse her.</L>
<L>I see my fate, and am prepar'd to meet it.
<STAGE>(<HI>Aside.</HI>)</STAGE></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>K.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>You do acknowledge, and confirm for truth</L>
<L>All that is here contain'd?
<STAGE>(<HI>To</HI> Bel. <HI>and</HI> Zen.)</STAGE></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Both.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>So Heaven deal with us.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>K.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis all too plain: Her lawless love, fierce malice,</L>
<L><HI>Conrade</HI>'s foul rage, and poor <HI>Ismena</HI>'s ruin—</L>
<L>To find her guilty, is to find her hateful:</L>
<L>And I wou'd hate—what once I dearly lov'd.</L>
<L>No blood—but tears, and those too weakly shed,</L>
<L>Must stream o'er thy dishonourable hearse,</L>
<L>Unhappy, false <HI>Matilda!</HI>—But no more.—</L>
<L>I will dismiss this weak unworthy softness.</L>
<L>Let <HI>Elmerick</HI> go weep.—<HI>Ismena</HI>'s wrongs</L>
<L>May call forth tears that manhood may be proud of.</L>
<L>To weep <HI>Ismena</HI> is to feel for virtue.</L>
<L>How is it with her sorrows? From this hour</L>
<L>My tenderest care shall be to give them comfort.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Elm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>I fear her sorrows ne'er will taste of comfort.</L>
<L>But see, the messenger I sent returns.</L>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Messenger.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mess.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>I come, my Lord—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Elm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Be brief: how fares my wife?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mess.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>As Angels fare,</L>
<L>With whom she now inhabits. When you sent me,</L>
<L>I found her in the arms of her attendants—</L>
<L>Fainting she seem'd—But when I told my message</L>
<L>She rais'd her head, and lifting up her eyes,</L>
<L>'Till then just clos'd, propitious Heaven! she cried,</L>
<L>Defend this noblest pattern of your justice,</L>
<L>Nor let his matchless love go unrewarded.</L>
<L><PB N="70" REF="69"/>Then with an heavenly smile addrest me thus.</L>
<L>Assure my Lord I die without reluctance.</L>
<L>My soul, that melts with gratitude, presages</L>
<L>Unequal'd blessings shall attend him here,</L>
<L>While I enjoy—and then her speech forsook her,</L>
<L>And she, without one painful sigh, expir'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>K.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Too sure a testimony hast thou given</L>
<L>Of thy foul wrongs, <HI>Ismena—Elmerick!</HI>—</L>
<L>Quite speechless and o'erwhelm'd!—her father too!—</L>
<L>Turn not away—I do not offer comfort—</L>
<L>I mean but to mourn with you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Elm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>So to die!—</L>
<L>Her delicately chaste and heavenly soul</L>
<L>Forsook its earthly temple when prophan'd</L>
<L>Without the steel or poison's lawless aid—</L>
<L>And lives the man who wrong'd me in <HI>Ismena?</HI></L>
<L>Hear then, O righteous King, my high appeal</L>
<L>To thee, and to the law of warlike <HI>Hungary</HI>.</L>
<L>Give me to meet this impious Prince in battle;</L>
<L>There, in the crouded lists, dread scene of justice,</L>
<L>There only can I sue for retribution,</L>
<L>Wrong'd as I am, without a soldier's shame.</L>
<L>And thou, <HI>Ismena</HI>, from thy sainted seat,</L>
<L>Where high thou fit'st crown'd with the starry wreaths</L>
<L>That angels weave for purity like thine,</L>
<L>Look down propitious on me, and accept</L>
<L>This high, this second sacrifice of vengeance.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Conr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Then I have murder'd thee, ador'd <HI>Ismena</HI>.</L>
<L>These mourn thy fate with tears, but what's the sorrow</L>
<L>That streaming eyes can utter and relieve!</L>
<L>Though thou disdain'st my grief, yet learn this truth</L>
<STAGE>(<HI>turning to</HI> Elmerick)</STAGE>
<L><PB N="71" REF="70"/>From him thou most abhor'st:—The innocent</L>
<L>Are not the fittest objects of compassion:</L>
<L>O there's no pain, no misery like guilt—</L>
<L>Nor do I fall thy sacrifice: For know,</L>
<L>Had I been plac'd above the power of vengeance;</L>
<L><HI>Ismena</HI>'s fate, th'effect of my rash love,</L>
<L>Had been lamented thus, and thus reveng'd—</L>
</SP>
<STAGE>(<HI>Stabs himself.</HI>)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>K.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>This is t'atone one error by another.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Conr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Nothing but error: I was born to err:</L>
<L>The willing slave of every youthful passion.</L>

<STAGE>(<HI>Dies.</HI>)</STAGE></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Elm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Unerring power! whose deep and secret counsels</L>
<L>No finite mind can fathom and explore;</L>
<L>It must be just to leave your creatures free,</L>
<L>And wise to suffer what you most abhor:</L>
<L>Supreme and absolute of these your ways</L>
<L>You render no account—We ask for none.</L>
<L>For mercy, truth, and righteous retribution</L>
<L>Attend at length your high and awful throne.</L>

<SPEAKER><HI>K.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Our sorrows must be felt. Yet, O! brave <HI>Elmerick</HI>,</L>
<L>Let not the Publick suffer! Thou'st done greatly.</L>
<L>Still hold the Sov'reign Power till I return</L>
<L>From <HI>Jordan</HI>'s sacred stream and holy <HI>Sion</HI>;</L>
<L>My Substitute till then, my Friend for ever.</L>
<L>The face of justice as she shines in Heaven,</L>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. MILWARD.</BYLINE>
<L>YOU, who supreme o'er ev'ry work of Wit,</L>
<L>In Judgment here unaw'd, unbiast sit,</L>
<L>The <HI>Palatines</HI> and <HI>Guardians</HI> of the Pit;</L>
<L>If to your minds this meerly-modern Play,</L>
<L>No useful sense, no gen'rous warmth convey;</L>
<L>If <HI>Fustian</HI> here, thro' each unnat'ral Scene,</L>
<L>In strain'd conceits <HI>sound high,</HI> and <HI>nothing mean;</HI></L>
<L>If <HI>Lofty Dulness</HI> for your Vengeance call;</L>
<L>Like <HI>Elmerick Judge,</HI> and let the <HI>Guilty Fall</HI>.</L>
<L>But if Simplicity with Force and Fire,</L>
<L>Unlabour'd thoughts and artless words inspire;</L>
<L>If, like the Action which these Scenes relate,</L>
<L>The whole appear irregularly Great;</L>
<L>If master-strokes the nobler Passions move,</L>
<L>Then, like the <HI>King, acquit</HI> us, and <HI>approve</HI>.</L>
