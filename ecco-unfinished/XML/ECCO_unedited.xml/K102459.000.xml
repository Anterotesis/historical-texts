INTRODUCTION
TO THE
Doctrine of <HI>Fluxions,</HI>
And DEFENCE of the
<HI>MATHEMATICIANS</HI>
AGAINST THE
OBJECTIONS of the Author of the
<HI>ANALYST,</HI> so far as they are designed to
affect their general Methods of Reasoning.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE long ago thought that the
first principles and rules of the
method of Fluxions stood in need of
a more full and distinct explana∣tion
and proof, than what they
had received either from their first
incomparable author, or any of his followers; and
therefore was not at all displeased to find the me∣thod
itself opposed with so much warmth by the
ingenious author of the <HI>Analyst;</HI> and had it been
his only design to bring this point to a fair issue, whether a demonstration by the method of Fluxions
be truly scientific or not, I should have heartily
applauded his conduct, and have thought he deser∣ved
the thanks even of the Mathematicians them∣selves.
But the invidious light in which he has
put this debate, by representing it as of consequence
to the interests of religion, is, I think, truly unjusti∣fiable,
as well as highly imprudent. Among all
wise and fair inquirers, 'tis beyond all contradi∣ction
plain, that religion can be no ways affected
by the truth or falshood of the doctrine of <HI>Fluxions.</HI>
And tho' prejudiced minds may be variously affected
by it, yet it is not easy to be conceived what advan∣tage
this debate is likely to give to the cause of
religion and virtue in general even among them.
Whereas it is easy to guess of what disservice our author's representation of a controversy in which
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
religion has no manner of concern, may be towards
raising and inflaming the passions of weak men on
both sides of the question: And I wish he had been
pleased coolly to consider beforehand of what conse∣quence
the result of this dispute is likely to be to the
cause of religion, among those for whose conviction
his <HI>Analyst</HI> is chiefly designed. If he should not be
able to make out his point, will not the blind fol∣lowers
of the Infidel Mathematicians be more con∣firmed
in their errors than they were before? Will
they not be more prejudiced against religion, and
established in their esteem and veneration of their
masters by a weak and fruitless attempt to depress
their characters; and by finding that a zeal for it
has occasioned so strong an attempt to wound the
reputation of Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> Newton as a cautious and
fair reasoner? And on the other hand, if our au∣thor
should carry his point, and his proofs should be
allowed, that the doctrine of Fluxions is an incom∣prehensible
mystery, and that the most accurate
Mathematicians have, one after another, imposed
upon themselves in the most egregious manner, by
false and inconclusive reasonings, what consequences
can we suppose that such persons will draw from
these premises? Our Author indeed would have
them only from hence make this one conclusion, That
their masters, the Mathematicians, are not to be
depended upon when they speak against religion.
But I believe it can't in reason be expected that
they should stop here.</P>
<P>If such men as Dr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> Dr. <HI>Clarke,</HI> &amp;c.
and the incomparable Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> were
capable of imagining that they saw with the greatest
clearness and perspicuity, where they had, nothing
but absolute and incomprehensible darkness before
them, what conclusion will persons, used to take
their opinions from authority, be likely to make
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
from these premises, but that all pretences to know∣ledge
in religion, and every thing esfe, are only
confidence and presumption?</P>
<P>If they are taught that it is inconsistent for a
person to reject the mysteries of religion, and yet be∣lieve
the mystery of Fluxions, will they not know
how to draw the opposite conclusion themselves, that
it is inconsistent to reject the doctrine of Fluxions
because mysterious, and yet receive the mysteries of
religion? And<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Defence of Freethinking, <HI>p,</HI> 62.</NOTE> when they are taught to think that
a person may be <HI>justly</HI> said to have faith, because
they give into what they can neither demonstrate
nor <HI>conceive;</HI> if this give them a mean opinion of
the Mathematicians, 'tis odds if it don't give them
a mean opinion of faith itself. I am sure 'tis a very
strange account of that which may justly be called
faith: For without clear notions no man can be∣lieve
any more than demonstrate.</P>
<P>Considering these things, I can't help thinking
it was highly wrong to bring religion at all into
this controversy, which may inflame the dispute,
but can hardly do any real service: Of which, to
me, it is a very strong presumption, that every
thing urged by the author of the <HI>Analyst</HI> against
Infidels in general, would have sounded full as well
in the mouth of a Papist, if urged against those
Mathematicians that don't believe the doctrine of
Transubstantiation, as it would have been peculi∣arly
in character for such a one to have made his
chief attack upon a great enemy of all superstition
and tyranny, and an hearty friend to the reasona∣ble
religion of Christians and Protestants. But
enough of this. I shall now consider my subject as
stript of all relation it has to religion, and merely
as a matter of human science, and endeavour to
shew that the method of Fluxions is founded upon
clear and substantial principles.</P>

<PB REF="6"/>
<HEAD>SECT I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T cannot be doubted but that
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> well under∣stood
the doctrine of which he was the
original inventor; and
his proofs of it are very far
from being fallacious and de∣ceitful,
or their force hard to be
understood by those that are used to these kinds
of subjects.</P>
<P>BUT it is also very plain, that the question,
which is the main dispute between our author
and his adversaries, whether Mathematicians
take the notion and certainty of the method of
Fluxions implicitly from him or not, does not
depend upon our being able to defend the exact
accuracy of the demonstrations he has made use
of, and the propriety of every phrase by which
he has explained his notions upon this head.
He always seems to have studied conciseness of
expression, and to depend on the good sense
and judgment of his reader. And on this ac∣count
some of his demonstrations are not the
most full and compleat that might be given,
and must remain obscure to those who have no
genius for the mathematical science, and can't
find out those steps in a demonstration, which a
writer often omits in confidence of the sagacity
of his reader. In my opinion this is in some
measure the case with respect to his proofs of
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
the first principles of Fluxions, and therefore I
don't wonder persons differ in their sentiments
about them. But it is truly provoking to find
that the greatest genius that ever appeared in
the philosophical world, and one whom the
lovers of knowledge must always think of with
respect and gratitude, should be represented
contrary to his known character, as craftily
imposing on the world, in confidence of his
own authority, and the obscurity of his subject.
And therefore I would hope that the author of
the <HI>Analyst</HI> did not design that severe reflection
his words seem to carry with them, when he
says, “Such reasoning as this, nothing but the
obscurity of the subject could have <HI>encoura∣ged</HI>
or <HI>induced</HI> the great author of the fluxio∣nary
method <HI>to have put upon</HI> his followers;
and nothing but an <HI>implicit</HI> deference to his
authority could have moved them to admit. ”
To suspect Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> of the mean design
of seeking reputation among the ignorant, by
venting unintelligible notions, and defending
them by artful and cunning sophistry, is what
I think no man is capable of doing. And there∣fore
if the author of the <HI>Analyst</HI> does not think
fit, for his own reputation, to revoke or ex∣plain
the sentence just mentioned, it needs not a
particular confutation. Nor do I propose parti∣cularly
to follow him in all the objections he has
made against Sir <HI>Isaac</HI>'s notions and demonstra∣tions,
being of opinion that the best way of an∣swering
him is to assist persons in understand∣ing
the subject itself; for if any one can do this,
he will easily see there is little weight in what he
has said against it. However, as I go along, I
shall endeavour to obviate any thing that I
think may create a difficulty; but my main
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
view is to settle the first principles on which
the doctrine of Fluxions depends, and then to
shew that, by just reasoning from them, the
rules for finding the Fluxions of equations, as
delivered by Sir <HI>Isaac,</HI> do truly follow.</P>
<P>THE notion of Fluxions was originally
gained by the observation of quantities being
described by a continual motion; and the me∣thod
of Fluxions was designed to do these two
things. Ist, From the magnitude of a quantity
continually changing being given, to find out
the rate or velocity according to which the
quantity itself continually increases or decreases.
And, <HI>2dly,</HI> From this latter continually given,
to find the former.</P>
<P>WHERE you see the main thing taken for
granted is this</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>POSTULATE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Quantities may be supposed as continually changing,
so as every distinct instant of time to be different
from what they were before.</HI></P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ILLUSTRATION.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH quantities are the following, Time from
a given hour, the distance of a body from a
plane to or from which it moves, the amount
of money lent out at interest, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> However,
it is not the business of the Mathematician to
dispute whether quantities do in fact ever vary
in the manner that is supposed, but only whe∣ther
the notion of their so doing be intelligible;
which being allowed, he has a right to take it
for granted, and then to see what deductions he
can make from that supposition. It is not the
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
business of a Mathematician to show that a strait
line or circle can be drawn, but he tells you
what he means by these; and if you understand
him, you may proceed farther with him; and
it wou'd not be to the purpose to object that
there is no such thing in nature as a true strait
line or perfect circle, for this is none of his con∣cern:
he is not inquiring how things are in mat∣ter
of fact, but supposing things to be in a cer∣tain
way, what are the consequences to be de∣duced
from them; and all that is to be demand∣ed
of him is, that his suppositions are intelligi∣ble,
and his inferences just from the suppositions
he makes. In the case before us, Whether
quantities in fact do ever vary in the manner
before explained, or not, is nothing to the pur∣pose,
but whether the notion of their so doing
be intelligible; and that it is so is plain, be∣cause
tho' this should not be fact in any case,
yet in a great many it seems to us so to be
When a stone falls to the ground, the line it
describes seems continually to increase; nor can
I avoid the same sentiment when I describe a
circle or any other line upon a paper. And it
may as well be pretended that the letters I now
write consist of a number of distinct and separate
dots, and no continued lines, as that each of
them does not seem to be formed by a continued
motion. Now if I really think I see quantities
formed by a continued motion, it is plain that
this sort of increase is not unintelligible, and
therefore may be supposed by the Mathemati∣cian.
The reader perhaps may here think that
I intend to obviate an objection that even the
author of the <HI>Analyst</HI> himself would never make;
but I must own my suspicion of the contrary,
because I think he can't allow of such sort of
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
increase, without giving up his cause, and al∣lowing
me a right to make this farther</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>POSTULATE II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The notion of FLUXIONS is intelligible.</HEAD>
<P>FOR if quantities may increase or decrease so
as to be different every distinct instant of time
from what they were before, it will follow that
they must change at a certain rate either fixed or
variable, it being impossible that a man shou'd
conceive of a quantity continually changing,
without knowing that it must either alter at the
same rate always, or else sometimes faster, and
at other times slower; <HI>i. e.</HI> he can't do this without
knowing what Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> means when he
defines the Fluxion of a quantity to be the velo∣city
or swiftness with which the quantity changes
its magnitude: And the Fluxion of a quantity
cannot be an unintelligible notion, when it ne∣cessarily
arises from a plain and easy supposition.
Nay, I am very well satisfied that our author
himself must have a notion both of a first and
second Fluxion. if he at all understands himself,
when he supposes <HI>a line described by the motion of
a point continually accelerated.</HI> At least I am sure
'tis as hard for me to conceive of the motion of
a point, and the acceleration of that motion, as
to form an idea of a first and second Fluxion,</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">DEFINITIONS.</HEAD>
<P>1. A FLOWING quantity is one that continually increases or decreases, and in such a manner that some time is requisite to make any increment or decrement.</P>
<P>2. THE Fluxion of a flowing quantity is its rate or swiftness of increase or decrease.</P>
<P>3. THE change of a flowing quantity is the difference between the flowing quantity itself, and its value at a particular instant of time.</P>
<P>4. THE time in which a change is made, is the time the flowing quantity takes to alter from a prior to a subsequent value, whose difference is the change.</P>
<P>5. THAT change is said to vanish at a given instant, which is the difference between the flowing quantity before that instant and its value then; and that change is said to begin to arise at a given instant, which is the difference between the flowing quantity after that instant, and its value at that instant.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>ILLUSTRATION.</HEAD>
<P>LET <HI>y</HI> be a quantity continually increasing,
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> its value at a given instant; then <HI>A—y</HI> will
represent its change [taken from that instant] so
long as <HI>y</HI> is less than <HI>A;</HI> and this change will
vanish when <HI>y</HI> becomes equal to <HI>A;</HI> and by the
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
continued increase of <HI>y,</HI> there will then begin to
arise another change which is ever afterwards
equal to <HI>y—A.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Def</HI> 6. IF there be two permanent quantities
<HI>A</HI> and <HI>B,</HI> and two other flowing Quantities <HI>a</HI>
and <HI>b,</HI> and the ratio of <HI>a</HI> to <HI>b</HI> be always, during
a given time, that of the sum or difference of
the first permanent quantity <HI>A,</HI> and another
flowing quantity <HI>x</HI> to the sum or difference of
the second permanent quantity <HI>B,</HI> and another
flowing quantity <HI>y,</HI> and at the end of the given
time all the flowing quantities vanish; then the
ratio of the permanent quantities <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B,</HI> is
the last or ultimate ratio of the vanishing quan∣tities
<HI>a</HI> and <HI>b;</HI> which I thus express, ult. <HI>a : b ::
A : B. i. e.</HI> if <HI>a : b :: A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x: B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI> always, du∣ring
the time <HI>T,</HI> and at the end of that time, <HI>a,
b, x, y</HI> all vanish; then ult. <HI>a : b :: A : B.</HI></P>
<P>7. IF other things being supposed the same,
<HI>a, b, x, y,</HI> be each equal to nothing at the be∣ginning
of the time <HI>T,</HI> then the ratio of <HI>A</HI> to <HI>B</HI>
is the first ratio of the nascent quantities <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b:</HI>
which I thus express, p<SUP>mo</SUP> <HI>a : b :: A : B.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Remark.</HI> THESE two definitions are in effect
the same with those given by Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI>
and can't be disputed; for whether <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI>
properly speaking, have any proportion as they
arise, or vanish, yet <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B</HI> have; and that
I am at liberty to call by what name I please.</P>
<P><HI>Coroll.</HI> 1. THE ultimate ratio of two vanish∣ing
quantities, is a determinate ratio; <HI>i. e.</HI> if
ult. <HI>a : b :: A : B,</HI> and ult. <HI>a: b :: A : N. B</HI> is
= <HI>N.</HI> For since ult. <HI>a : b :: A : B;</HI> therefore,
by <HI>Def.</HI> 6. <HI>a: b :: A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x : B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y during a given
time</HI> T, at the end of which the flowing quan∣tities
<HI>a, b, x, y,</HI> all vanish; and by the same
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Defin. <HI>a: b :: A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v : N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>z,</HI> during a given
time <HI>t,</HI> at the end of which the flowing quanti∣ties
<HI>a, b, v, z,</HI> all vanish; and the end of <HI>t</HI> and
<HI>T</HI> coincide, because that is the instant when <HI>a</HI>
and <HI>b</HI> vanish. Taking therefore the shorter of
these times <HI>t,</HI> during that <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x: B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y :: A
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v : N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>z.</HI> Now because <HI>x, y, z, v,</HI> change
only as flowing quantities, and vanish together
at the end of the time <HI>t,</HI> before the end of the
time <HI>t</HI> they will be all less than any assignable
quantity <HI>D</HI> [for suppose any of them never less
than <HI>D</HI> before that instant, then <HI>a</HI> decrement as
large as <HI>D</HI> must be made instantaneously, in or∣der
to its vanishing at that instant, which is
contrary to the supposition of its changing only
as a flowing quantity.] But since <HI>x, y, v, z,</HI>
may be as small as you please, and yet the
analogy <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x : B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y :: A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v : N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>z</HI> be pre∣served,
it is plain that <HI>A : B :: A : N;</HI> and that
therefore <HI>B = N.</HI> Q. E. D.</P>
<P><HI>Coroll.</HI> 2. IN like manner it may be proved
that the first ratio of two arising quantities, is a
given ratio.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>AXIOM I.</HEAD>
<P>THE sum and difference of two flowing, and
the fourth proportional to three flowing quanti∣ties;
and therefore a quantity any how made up
of given and flowing quantities, must be itself a
flowing or permanent quantity; <HI>i. e.</HI> some time
is requisite to its receiving any increment or de∣crement,
because a change in it must imply a
change at least in some one of them.</P>
<P><HI>Coroll.</HI> 3. IF <HI>a : b :: A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x : B</HI> during the time
<HI>T;</HI> then if, at the end of the time <HI>T,</HI> the flow∣ing
quantities <HI>a, b, x</HI> vanish, ult. <HI>a : b :: A : B;</HI>
and if, at the beginning of <HI>T,</HI> they are equal
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
to nothing, p<SUP>mo</SUP> <HI>a : b :: A : B.</HI> For because <HI>a :
b :: A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x : B,</HI> therefore <HI>a : b :: A¦a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x : B

are flowing quantities all vanishing together, or
all arising together; and therefore, by <HI>Defin.</HI>
6 and 7, in the former case ult. <HI>a : b :: A : B,</HI>
and in the latter p<SUP>mo</SUP> <HI>a : b :: A : B.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coroll.</HI> 4. IF <HI>a : b :: A : B</HI> always, <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI>
vanishing or arising together, then ult. <HI>a : b ::
A : B;</HI> or p<SUP>mo</SUP> <HI>a : b :: A : B.</HI> This is proved
as the foregoing.</P>
<P><HI>Coroll.</HI> 5. IF the ratio of two quantities con∣tinually
decreasing approach continually nearer
and nearer to a given ratio, and by so doing at
length come nearer to it than by any assignable
difference, that given ratio is the last ratio of
the flowing quantities when they vanish. Let
the flowing quantities be <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> the given ra∣tio
<HI>A:B.</HI> Then supposing <HI>a : b :: A : B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x</HI>
always, as <HI>a</HI> and <HI>b</HI> decrease, <HI>x</HI> will also continu∣ally
decrease in the same manner as a flowing
quantity, by <HI>Ax.</HI> I. and <HI>x</HI> may be as small as
you please, because the ratio of <HI>a</HI> to <HI>b</HI> may ap∣proach
nearer to that of <HI>A</HI> to <HI>B,</HI> than by any
assignable difference. And therefore when <HI>a</HI>
and <HI>b</HI> vanish, <HI>x</HI> must vanish with them; [for if
it then be equal to <HI>D,</HI> it never before was less
than <HI>D,</HI> since it was continually decreasing;
whereas before it was smaller than any assigna∣ble
quantity] and therefore, by <HI>Coroll.</HI> 3. ult.
<HI>a : b :: A : B.</HI></P>

by the like contrivance as the sixth;
and the like propositions are true, and in like
manner to be proved concerning prime ratio's.</P>
<P><HI>Axiom</HI> 2. A QUANTITY flows uniformly,
or with a permanent Fluxion, when the changes
made in it are always proportional to the times
in which they are made.</P>
<P><HI>Axiom</HI> 3. THE Fluxions of quantities uni∣formly
flowing, are always in the proportion
of their synchronal changes; and therefore, be∣cause
this is a given ratio (by <HI>Coroll.</HI> 4. <HI>Defin.</HI> 5
and 6.) in their ultimate ratio when they va∣nish,
or their prime ratio when they arise.</P>
<P><HI>Axiom</HI> 4. IF thro' any time two quantities
be generated, or changes be made in two quan∣tities,
one with an uniform Fluxion or rate of
increase or decrease, and the other with a Flu∣xion
continually increasing; then the ratio of
the quantity generated, or the change made by
the uniform or permanent Fluxion to the quan∣tity
generated, or the change made by the con∣tinually
increasing Fluxion, will be always less than
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
the ratio of the Fluxion of the former is to
the Fluxion of the latter at the beginning of the
time, and greater than the ratio which the Flu∣xions
are in to one another at the end of the
time.</P>
<P><HI>Axiom</HI> 5. BUT if, other things being suppo∣sed
the same, the latter Fluxion continually
decrease, the ratio of the quantity generated, or
the change made by the uniform or permanent
Fluxion to the quantity generated, or the change
made by the continually decreasing Fluxion,
will be always greater than the ratio of the Flu∣xion
of the former is to the Fluxion of the lat∣ter
at the beginning of the time, and less than
the ratio of the Fluxion of the former to the
Fluxion of the latter at the end of the time.
Both these axioms are plain consequences from
this obvious truth, that if any thing increase
with an accelerated velocity or swiftness, the
increase made in a given time will be greater than
if it had all along increased with the same swift∣ness
it did at the beginning, and less than if
it had all along increased with the swiftness it
did at the end of it; and that the contrary will
happen if the velocity be continually retarded.
And the reader will please to take notice, that
as the foregoing axioms are the sole principles
on which the doctrine of Fluxions is built, so
they were generally allowed, before this doctrine
was ever thought of, in relation to the velocities
of moving bodies, and the spaces described
by their motion. The only thing new in this
case is, that the idea of velocity is render'd
more general, and, in order to prevent ambi∣guity,
the word Fluxion has been substituted in
the room of it: but still the same general notion
is preserved; for as velocity, at least in its more
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
usual sense, signifies the degree of quickness with which
a body changes its situation in respect of space, so the
Fluxion of a quantity signifies the degree of quickness
with which the quantity changes its magnitude. Why
then is the notion of a Fluxion harder to be understood
than that of a velocity? Why may not we make use of
the same axioms in relation to one, which all the world
allows in relation to the other? Surely some reason
ought to be assigned of the difference between the two
cases; or it is not fair to make those things peculiar
objections against the notion of Fluxions, which equal∣ly
affect the notion of velocities. And I am apt to
think that the reader is mistaken, if he imagines that
Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> is peculiarly attacked in the objections
of the <HI>Analyst</HI> on this head, and not the common sense
of mankind both before and since his time. And what
good reason can be assigned why the common notions
of all mankind are represented as the peculiar blunders
of Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> and his followers, it is not easy to determine.
As to the second, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Fluxions, there may, I allow,
seem to be some peculiar difficulty in them to persons
that are not used to these subjects; but it seems to me
great weakness to imagine that there can be any pecu∣liar
objections against them, because tho' the farther
we go in the orders of Fluxions, our ideas become
more and more complex, yet no new simple ideas are
admitted. And when our author asserts, that in order
to conceive of a second Fluxion, we must conceive of
the velocity of a velocity, and that this is nonsense; he
plainly appeals to the sound and not the sense of words.
When velocity is considered only as an affection of mo∣tion,
the velocity of a velocity is nonsense. But then
this is not the notion of a second Fluxion; and if by
inlarging the idea of velocity, you make it synonymous
to the word <HI>Fluxion,</HI> then the velocity
of a velocity, however oddly it may sound, is nothing but plain com∣mon
sense. For the degree of quickness with which any
quantity increases, may vary to greater or less with any
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
degree of quickness imaginable; and this last is called
the second Fluxion of the quantity. Now if the author
of the <HI>Analyst</HI> can shew the absurdity of this notion, he
is welcome so to do; but let him not first dress it up in
an ambiguous phrase, and then think to confute it by
laughing at his own way of understanding that phrase.</P>

<P>IF there be two flowing quantities, one of which
flows with a permanent Fluxion, and the other with a
continually increasing one, then the Fluxions of these
quantities, at any given instant of time, will be in the
last ratio of their synchronal changes vanishing at that

changes which begin to arise at that instant.</P>
<P>I. LET the given instant be the fix'd end of the va∣riable

continually increases, and I suppose now only as a
flowing quantity, whilst the Fluxion of <HI>y</HI> remains al∣ways
the same, call respectively y′, <HI>z′</HI> and <HI>z′.</HI> Then
since ż is the Fluxion of <HI>z</HI> at the given instant, or the
end of <HI>i,</HI> and ż the change made in it during the
time <HI>t,</HI> and this Fluxion continually increases; therefore
ż—z will always express the Fluxion of <HI>z</HI> at the
beginning of <HI>t,</HI> whether <HI>t</HI> be longer or shorter; and
consequently, by <HI>Axiom</HI> 4. the ratio of y′ to z′ will be

that of ẏ to ż. If therefore <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> always,
<HI>x</HI> will be always less than z. Now as <HI>t</HI> continually
decreases, it is plain, by <HI>Axiom</HI> I. that the quanti∣ties
<HI>y′, z′, x, z′</HI> being always made up of given and
flowing quantities, can themselves only vary as flow∣ing
quantities, and as such they must vanish, when <HI>t</HI>
vanishes that is at the given instant: [y′ must then
vanish, being always equal to the difference between
<HI>A</HI> and <HI>y;</HI> and <HI>A</HI> and <HI>y</HI> are equal at the given instant:
for the same reason z′ and z′ vanish at the given in∣stant,

a part of z] Wherefore since <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> al∣ways,

as having two Fluxions at the given instant, one of
which is that it would have had if no such alteration
had been in it; and the other is that it would have
had if the same alteration had been made in it before
the given instant, and not then. And taking the
times <HI>t</HI> and <HI>T</HI> so short, that during both there be no

the same as the ratio of their Fluxions, on the sup∣position

And the same way this part of the
proposition is evident, if there had been ever
so many flowing quantities in the equation.</P>
<P>2. SUPPOSE some of the quantities to de∣crease
whilst others increase, and let the equa∣tion
be <HI>Z—Y + bv—x = R + r + T</HI> always;
I say then, that if the great letters denote in∣creasing
quantities, and the small ones decrea∣sing
ones, that ż—ẏ—v̇ + ẋ—Ṙ—ṙ + j̇
= O. For taking <HI>V</HI> = 2 D—v, and <HI>X = D
—x,</HI> and <HI>P = D—r</HI> always, <HI>D</HI> being a deter∣minate
quantity large enough, it is evident that
whilst <HI>v,</HI> <HI>x,</HI> <HI>r</HI> decrease, <HI>V,</HI> <HI>X,</HI> <HI>P</HI> must increase,
and that <HI>Y + R + T + V = Z + X + P</HI> always.
Wherefore by the foregoing part of this propo∣sition,
ẏ + Ṙ + Ṫ + v̇—ż—ẋ—ḟ = O.
But because <HI>V = 2D—v</HI> always, the synchro∣nal
changes of <HI>V</HI> and <HI>v</HI> are always equal, since
<HI>D</HI> is standing quantity; and therefore <HI>v̇ = v̇</HI>
And in like manner Ẋ = ẋ, and ṗ = ṙ Put∣ting
therefore v̇, ẋ, ṙ in the places of v̇, ẋ, ṗ,
it will follow that <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>,
And in the same way the justness of the

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now proved, I hope, beyond exce∣ption,
that considering Fluxions as the ve∣locities
or rates with which quantities increase or
decrease, that their proportions may be always
found, if the last ratio of their synchronal chan∣ges
vanishing at every given instant is known.
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
But I would here observe, that whatever false
metaphysics there may be in the notion of Flu∣xions
considered as velocities, it does not at all
affect the general method; as Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>
himself has informed us, that instead of these
Fluxions we may make use of any other finite
quantities found out from the last ratio of the
synchronal increments or decrements of Flowing
Quantities; and therefore the Author of the <HI>Ana∣lyst</HI>
hardly acted the part of a fair adversary, in
making such a pother about the notion of Flu∣xions
as incomprehensible, since if he had not
been able to understand them, he might have
made use of any other quantities he did under∣stand
in their stead. I don't say this as if I
thought there were any difficulty in the notion
of Fluxions thus considered; I am on the con∣trary
very positive that no man can make any
objection against a velocity of increase or de∣crease
in general, that will not as strongly lie
against a velocity of motion. If quantities may
increase faster or flower, as well as bodies move
faster or flower, there is no greater impropriety
in saying that one quantity increases with a
greater velocity than another, than in saying
that one body moves with a greater velocity
than another. But tho' I think there is no dif∣faculty
in the notion of Fluxions consider'd as
velocities, yet in order to understand equations
where Fluxions of different orders are jumbled
together, it would be convenient to represent all
Fluxions not as before, but as quantities of the
same kind with their Fluents; and therefore I
should chuse to do it, were I to write a treatise
on this subject: And this may be done in the
following manner. Take <HI>Defin.</HI> 1, and <HI>Axiom</HI> 2
for the two first definitions: Define also ulti∣mate
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
ratio as before, and then proceed thus:
<HI>Defin,</HI> 4. The Fluxion of an uniformly flowing
quantity is the change made in it in a certain
given time. <HI>Defin.</HI> 5. The Fluxion of a quan∣tity
any how flowing at any given instant, is a
quantity found out by taking it to the Fluxion
of an uniformly flowing quantity in the ultimate
proportion of those synchronal changes which
then vanish. And considering Fluxions in this
light, all the uses might be made of them as
are done under the foregoing notion. But I go
on to what the <HI>Analyst</HI> gives me more occasion
to take notice of. I might have proved from
what went before, that the Fluxion of <HI>x</HI> is to
that of <HI>x</HI><SUP>n</SUP>, as I to <HI>nx</HI><SUP>n</SUP>^-<SUP>1</SUP> But for the fake of
justifying Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> I shall now take his
method.</P>
<P>LET <HI>x</HI> increase uniformly, and 'tis proposed
to find the Fluxion of <HI>x</HI><SUP>n</SUP>.</P>
<P>WHILST <HI>x</HI> by flowing becomes <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
will become <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, that is, <HI><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></HI> and the synchronal aug∣ments
0 and <HI><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> &amp;c.</HI>
are to one another as 1: <HI><GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>LET now these augments vanish, and their
last ratio will be as 1:nx<SUP>n</SUP>^-<SUP>1</SUP>; and therefore the
Fluxion of <HI>x</HI> is to the Fluxion <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> as 1 is to
nx<SUP>n</SUP>^-<SUP>1</SUP>. W. W. F.</P>
<P>THIS our author says is no fair and conclu∣sive
reasoning, because when we suppose the
“increments to vanish, we must suppose their
proportions, their expressions, and every thing
else derived from the supposition of their exi∣stence
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
to vanish with them.” To this I an∣swer,
that our author himself must needs know
thus much, <HI>viz.</HI> That the lesser the increment 0
is taken, the nearer the proportion of the incre∣ments
of <HI>x</HI> and <HI>x<SUP>n</SUP></HI> will arrive to that of I to
<HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP>^-<SUP>1</SUP>,</HI> and that by supposing the increment 0
continually to decrease, the ratio of these syn∣chronal
increments may be made to approach
to it nearer than by any assignable difference,
and can never come up with it before the time
when the increments themselves vanish. And
no more nor less than this does Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> mean
(as he himself informs us) when he says, that
the last ratio of the vanishing increments is that
of 1 to <HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP>^-<SUP>1</SUP>.</HI> When therefore our author
must own that to be true which Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> intends,
what signifies it to dispute whether it be proper
to speak of the proportion of the increments as
still in being, when the quantities themselves
vanish or become = 0.</P>
<P>FOR tho', strictly speaking, it should be al∣lowed
that there is no last proportion of vanish∣ing
quantities, yet on this account no fair and
candid reader wou'd find fault with Sir <HI>Isaac
Newton,</HI> for he has so plainly described the pro∣portion
he calls by this name, as sufficiently to
distinguish it from any other whatsoever: So
that the amount of all objections against the ju∣stice
of his method in finding out the last propor∣tion
of vanishing quantities, can arise to little
more than this, that he has no right to call the
proportion he finds out according to this method
by that name, which sure must be egregious
trifling. However, as on this head our author
seems to talk with more than usual confidence
of the advantage he has over his opponents, and
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
gives us what he says is the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analyst,</HI> p. 21.</NOTE> amount of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Isaac</HI>'s
reasoning in a truly ridiculous light, it will be
proper to see on whom the laugh ought to fall,
for I am sure somebody must here appear
strangely ridiculous. His arguings and illustra∣tions
founded on<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 20.</NOTE> the <HI>Lemma</HI> he proposes as
self-evident, I think I have no occasion to med∣dle
with, because I readily allow whatever con∣sequence
he is pleased to draw from it, if it app∣ears
that Sir <HI>Isaac,</HI> in order to find the last
ratio's proposed, was obliged to make two in∣consistent
suppositions. To confute which no∣thing
more need be said than barely to relate
the suppositions he did make.</P>
<P>1. THEN he supposes that <HI>x</HI> by increasing be∣comes
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, and from hence he deduces the
relation of the increments of <HI>x</HI> and x<SUP>n</SUP>.</P>
<P>2. AGAIN; in order to find the last ratio of
the increments vanishing, he<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That what is here made the second supposition, is truly the meaning of <HI>Evanescant jam augmenta illa</HI> in Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> is very plain from the manner in which he supposes quantities to vanish throughout the <HI>Introduction to the Quadratures.</HI></NOTE> supposes 0 to de∣crease
till it vanishes, or becomes equal to no∣thing.
Besides these he makes no other suppo∣sitions,
and these are evidently no more incon∣sistent
and contradictory, than to suppose a man
should first go up stairs, and then come down
again. To suppose the increments to be some∣thing
and nothing at the same time, is contra∣dictory;
but to suppose them first to exist, and
then to vanish, is perfectly consistent; nor will
the consequences drawn from the supposition of
their prior existence, if just, be any ways affected
by the supposition of their subsequent vanishing,
because the truth of the latter supposition no
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
ways contradicts the truth of the former. To
make this more plain, consider what is made
out from each supposition: from the first that
<HI>x</HI> has increased by 0, this consequence is drawn,
that the proportion between the increments of
<HI>x</HI> and <HI>x</HI><SUP>n</SUP>, <HI>so long as they exist,</HI> may be expressed
by that of 1 to <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if 0
always express the increment of <HI>x.</HI> And this
consequence is no ways affected by supposing
0 continually to decrease, and at length to vanish.
But from this last supposition we may gather,
that the lesser 0 is, so much the nearer the ratio
of 1 to <HI>nx<SUP>n</SUP>^-<SUP>1</SUP></HI> comes to the ratio of the incre∣ments;
and that by a continual diminution of
0, it may come as near to it as you please, but
can never equal it before 0 quite vanishes; and
therefore this ratio, and no other whatsoever,
agrees to the description which Sir <HI>Isaac</HI> has gi∣ven
of the ultimate ratio of the vanishing incre∣ments.
His conclusion therefore comes out
without the supposition of any thing inconsistent.
And our Author, by his way of objecting, seems
to make no distinction between two opposite
things being; done at the same time, and their
being done at different ones; between a line's
being drawn, and then rubbed out; and lines
supposed to be drawn, and not drawn at all;
as will appear still farther by considering his
objection against the way of finding out the
ordinate of a curve from the area and abscisse
being perpetually given (which is a problem
analogous to that of finding the Fluxion from
the Fluent perpetually given, and) which I
shall now represent somewhat more distinctly
than he has done, and then consider his obje∣ction
against it.</P>

whence I find the area <HI>BCED × q<SUP>3</SUP> = M
× <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/></HI> and supposing <HI>BCED</HI> = to the rect∣angle
<HI>Bo,</HI> and calling <HI>Do, y,</HI> I find, instead of
<HI>BCED,</HI> putting its value, and dividing by <HI>x-b,</HI>
that <HI>yq = x<SUP>2</SUP> + xb + b<SUP>2</SUP>;</HI> which equation I see
is true, let <HI>x</HI> be of any magnitude either greater
or less than <HI>b;</HI> from whence I conclude it must
be true also when <HI>x = b.</HI> And because I find
that <HI>y</HI> is always a mean between <HI>k</HI> and <HI>z,</HI> I
conclude that when <HI>x = b,</HI> since then <HI>z = k,</HI> that
then also <HI>y = k;</HI> and therefore that at that time
the equation <HI>yq = x<SUP>2</SUP> + b<SUP>2</SUP></HI> must degenerate
into this, <GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> which gives me the relation
of the ordinate and absciffe. W. W. F.</P>
<P>Now in this way of reasoning, says, our Au∣thor,
there is a direct fallacy; because, <HI>first,</HI> we
are obliged to suppose that <HI>b</HI> and <HI>x</HI> are unequal,
without which we could not proceed one step;
and, in the <HI>second</HI> place, it is supposed that they
are equal, which is a manifest inconsistency.
But cannot so accurate a reasoner as our Author distinguish between different; times? To suppose
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/> and <HI>b</HI> equal and unequal at the same time,
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
would have been an inconsistency, but to sup∣pose
them first unequal, and afterwards to be∣come
equal, has not the shadow of difficulty in
it. And there is nothing wonderful in it, that
from the supposition of both these things hap∣pening
one after another, I can deduce a con∣clusion
which would not follow from either sup∣position
singly taken; and that the conclusion
I have drawn is just, will appear to any one
that considers what is distinctly made out in each
step of the demonstration.</P>
<P>BY taking <HI>x</HI> different from <HI>b,</HI> I find this
equation, <HI>yq = x<SUP>2</SUP> + xb + b<SUP>2</SUP>,</HI> and observe it
holds true of whatever magnitude <HI>x</HI> be taken;
the meaning of which may be thus expressed in
words at length: There always is a line greater
than one and less than the other of the two
quantities <HI>k</HI> and <HI>z,</HI> so long as they remain different
which multiplied by <HI>q</HI> is always grea∣ter
than one, and less than the other of the two
quantities <HI>3 x<SUP>2</SUP></HI> and <HI>3 b<SUP>2</SUP>.</HI> Now this proposition
is always true whatever becomes of <HI>x</HI> afterwards,
and from it I infer that at the time when <HI>x = b,</HI>
and <HI>k = z, kq</HI> must also be equal to <HI>3 b<SUP>2</SUP>.</HI> The
force of which inference depends upon this plain
axiom, That if so long as two quantities remain
different, a third be always greater than one
and less than the other of them, as soon as by a
continued increase or decrease any two of these
quantities become equal, all three of them must
be equal. The truth of which, were there any
manner of occasion for it, might easily be made
out by reducing the contrary position to an ab∣surdity.</P>
<P>IN what has been said, I have designedly ta∣ken
notice only of those objections of the inge∣nious
author of the <HI>Analyst</HI> which relate to the
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
doctrine of Fluxions; as for the differential
method of <HI>Leibnitz,</HI> I do not undertake its de∣fence,
because I think the notion of Fluxions
considered as velocities, or rather as finite quan∣tities
of the same kind with their Fluents, as
before described, is much more easily conceiva∣ble,
and frees from difficulty. Nay, I must
confess there seems to me to be some objection
against considering quantities as generated from
moments. What moments, what the <HI>principia
jamjam nascentia finitarum qutantitatum,</HI> are in
themselves, I own, I don't understand; I can't,
I am sure, easily conceive what a quantity is
before it comes to be of some bigness or other;
and therefore moments considered as parts of
the quantities whose moments they are, or as
really fixed and determinate quantities of any
kind, are beyond my comprehension, nor do I
indeed think that Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> himself did
thus consider them. But when he says, for in∣stance,
that the moment of <HI>A<SUP>2</SUP></HI> is equal to the
moment of <HI>A</HI> into twice <HI>A,</HI> his meaning is
only this, that if the increment of <HI>A</HI> be con∣tinually
diminished, the proportion between
that into <HI>A,</HI> and the correspondent increment
of <HI>A<SUP>2</SUP></HI> will approach towards, and at length
come nearer to, a ratio of equality than by any
assignable difference. And thus understanding
him, the proportion of moments is a phrase ea∣sily
intelligible, and his meaning very evident
in every sentence where he uses it, altho', with
me, you can't imagine what a moment in itself
is. 'Tis true indeed, upon this supposition, it
may not be agreeable to the exact accuracy of
language, to speak of moments as if they were
real intelligible quantities; but I am sure this is
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
all that can justly be objected against it, and
that there is no false logic or metaphysics in it.
Whether I have here spoke the sense of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Isaac</HI>
himself, or not, I won't be positive, and must
leave it to the judgment of the reader conversant
in his works; but I think he has given us inti∣mation
sufficiently plain, that we may at least
thus interpret him if we please, he being not at
all solicitous under what notion we consider mo∣ments,
whilst we take their proportions in that
manner he directs us.</P>
<P>OUR Author may perhaps think himself
not fairly used, that there has been no more
notice taken of second and third <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Flu∣xions
in this treatise, but it is to no purpose
to defend these before the objections against
the first are given up; and if the first are well
understood, there is no manner of difficulty in
the other, except what arises from this conside∣ration,
that our ideas become somewhat more
complex as we go on to the higher orders of
Fluxions. However I shall mention one thing
for the sake of young beginners in this science.
Suppose <HI>y<SUP>2</SUP> = x,</HI> and <HI>y</HI> flows uniformly, then,
according to the method of Fluxions, 2<HI>ẏ</HI> = x,
and 2y<SUP>2</SUP> = x<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it may be inquired what is the
meaning of tills equation taking Fluxion in the
notion of velocity, since upon that supposition
first and second Fluxions are quantities of differ∣rent
kinds, and therefore have no proportion to
one another? To this I answer, that the only
meaning of the equation is, that if you take the
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
value of 2ẏ<SUP>2</SUP> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xU at two different times, the
2y<SUP>2</SUP> are in the same proportion to one another
that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xU's are. And in like manner are equa∣tions
always to be understood which involve
quantities of different sorts; they don't express
the proportion of heterogeneous quantities to
one another, but of different values of homoge∣neous
quantities among themselves. And from
hence our Author may, if he pleases, receive
an answer to the latter part of his thirty-first
query, an odd query, surely, to be made by
one that pretends to answer Sir <HI>Isaac Newton:</HI>
But several of this kind are to be met with,
which shew greater prejudice against the Ma∣thematicians,
than knowledge of the principles
which they maintain. And I can't help obser∣ving,
that tho' our Author professes the utmost
caution as to what he admits as true, and a con∣cern
for the utmost accuracy in reasoning, yet
neither the one nor the other appears when he
is making his objections against the Mathema∣ticians.
Of this I should not have taken any
notice, if his design had only been to correct
some mistaken notions among the Mathemati∣cians;
but as his intention is evidently to run
down their method of reasoning, and to repre∣sent
them as Bigots and Enthusiasts in their own
science, it is but a piece of justice to them to
shew that their adversary is as inaccurate in his
reasonings, and as incautious in his assertions,
and in forming his accusations, as any of them
can be. Of this the reader may have already
observed some instances, and I shall beg his pa∣tience
whilst I mention one or two more.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43"/>
1. HE urges against the Mathematicians
with great injustice, I think, that they imagine
there may be a proportion between nothings,
and yet he himself argues from this principle,
<HI>Anal.</HI> p. 18. “Points are undoubtedly equal, as
having no more magnitude one than another,
a limit or point, as such, having no magni∣tude.”</P>
<P>2. EVERY reader of the <HI>Analyst</HI> will observe
what stress he lays on this maxim, Inaccurate
premises cannot infer an accurate conclusion; as
if nothing more was necessary than the belief of
this principle to consute his adversaries; whereas
the inference he would draw from thence, that
we therefore cannot, in any case, know the
conclusion to be right, if we have argued from
the supposition of the truth of what we know to
be false, or don't know to be true, is what no
rules of logic will justify: because it is possible
for me, by virtue of false or inaccurate premises,
to gain a conclusion, and at the same time to
know that the error in the premises will not
cause any error in the conclusion. Thus in
Algebra the supposition of a negative quantity,
or a quantity less than nothing, is an absurdity,
but yet this is no hindrance to the evidence of
those conclusions that according to the rules of
art are derived from it. And again, to bring
an instance more to our present purpose, I'll al∣low
that the supposition of an infinitesimal is
absurd, and also that the supposition that an in∣finitesimal
added to a finite quantity does not
increase its magnitude is absurd, when an infi∣nitesimal
is consider'd as a fix'd determinate
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
quantity; and yet, I say, in deducing the value
of the subtangent of a Parabola from these sup∣positions,
I may be sure that I make a right
conclusion; because those quantities which I
suppose to be infinitely small, if they are not so
will be very small, and those I suppose to be
equal will be very nearly so, and therefore the
error in the conclusion can be but very small;
<HI>i. e.</HI> the subtangent will be equal to twice the
abscisse very nearly. But I am certain that this
cannot possibly be demonstrated concerning any
finite and determinate quantities, unless they are
truly and exactly equal, if you don't fix upon
some determined proportion or difference as the
standard of what is nearly equal, but leave every
person at liberty to chuse what he will. And
from this principle I would observe, that the
conclusions found by <HI>Leibnitz</HI>'s method of differ∣rences
may be proved to be true, notwithstand∣ing
the error or inaccuracy of his principles:
for supposing in his method that the mark of
equality = does not signify truly but nearly equal
in the sense before given, and then correct your
conclusion by the forementioned axiom, and
you may be sure it is just.</P>
<P>3. HE represents the Mathematicians as
founding their reasonings on maxims shocking
to good sense, as particularly when they take it
for granted that a finite quantity divided by no∣thing
is infinite, <HI>Query</HI> 16. I suppose our Au∣thor
will not pretend to say here that he designed
only to ask a civil and innocent question,
but to charge the Mathematicians with proceed∣ing
on such absurd maxims as this; and if so,
it is an hasty and ill-grounded charge; 'tis a
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
charge, I think, he himself can hardly imagine
to be true. Does our Author take all Mathe∣maticians
to be fools; or did ever any fool
imagine that a reasonable answer could be given
to this question, How many nothings will fill a
quart; and that the proper answer is, An infi∣nite
number? Yet this is only to say that a
quart divided by nothing is infinite. 'Tis al∣lowed
that this is a rule in Algebra, <HI>that finite
divided by nothing is infinite:</HI> but the meaning
of it is only this, that if I inquire how big any
quantity must be taken in order to answer any
purpose, and the answer come out according to
the rules of Algebra 1/0 or 2/0 <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this is a sign
that no finite quantity is large enough. And
is there any thing shocking in this to the sense
of any man, from the porter to the philoso∣pher?
The same kind of answer ought to be
given in relation to other maxims of Algebra,
which appear strange to those unaccustomed to
the phrases, and really are in themselves sense∣less
expressions, as that the sum or product of
two impossible quantities may be possible. Nay
this may be said of the terms multiply and di∣vide,
add and subtract, as used in Algebra. An
Algebraist never scruples to subtract a greater
quantity from a less; but if he really designs to
do this, he may try till his heart akes before he
will be able to accomplish it, or to know what
he is about. All these phrases are therefore to
be considered merely as terms of art to help the
memory in an algebraic process, or signs of
rules, which from other principles we must
know to be just, and not from any idea we
have of the things, which, according to the
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
common use of the words, an ignorant man
may fancy they are intended to express. 'Tis
pity, indeed, these things have not been more
particularly explained by the writers of Alge∣bra,
the want of which may well make it ab∣struse
and confounding to beginners. Yet for a
person to make these objections against the art
or those that understand it, is as if I should im∣pute
it to the Logicians as a fault in theirs, that
they use the horrid terms <HI>Barbara, Celarent,</HI> &amp;c.
Nor do I think the use of these absurd expres∣sions
peculiar to Algebra, but they are fre∣quently
used where, thro' their being familiar,
and the design of them easily intelligible, they
are not thought to have any odd found. Thus
it is a maxim in Arithmetic that 2 × 0 = 5 × 0,
or in general any number multiplied by 0 is
= 0. Now I say that if by this any thing
else be understood than that this is a good rule
to go by in managing figures in Arithmetic, I
will so far venture the laugh of the Public as to
declare I don't understand it. He that can
take two nothings and find their sum, and then
five nothings and find their sum equal to the
former, seems to me to be in a fair way to be
able to divide by nothing, and find the quo∣tient;
and, with a little more pains, may
prove that two is equal to five. To multiply
by nothing, is as absurd as to divide by no∣thing;
and to suppose we can do either, is to
imagine nothing to be a real quantity or num∣ber:
for <HI>nihili nulloe sunt affectiones.</HI> Here I
suppose our Author agrees with me from his
40th <HI>Query;</HI> but no one will say that for this
reason we ought to reject the maxim considered
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
as a rule of Arithmetic, that the product of
any number by 0 is = 0.</P>
<P>4thly, <HI>Query</HI> 50. HE represents the dis∣putes
and controversies among Mathematicians
as disparaging the evidence of their methods:
and, <HI>Query</HI> 51. he represents Logics and Me∣taphysics
as proper to open their eyes, and
extricate them out of their difficulties. Now
were ever two things thus put together? If
the disputes of the professors of any science
disparage the science itself, Logics and Meta∣physics
are much more disparaged than Mathe∣matics;
why therefore, if I am half blind, must
I take for my guide one that can't see at all?
And to say the truth, it can hardly be look'd
upon as fair to represent Mathematics as dispa∣raged
by the disputes of its professors, which
insinuates that in this way it is peculiarly dis∣paraged,
whereas the quite contrary is true,
there being fewer disputes among Mathema∣ticians,
as such, than any other persons what∣soever.
The disputes of Mathematicians about
metaphysical and philosophical principles have
nothing to do here; and take away these,
hardly any remain.</P>
<P>Lastly, His frequent insinuations that Ma∣thematicians
don't care to be tried by the rules
of good logic, and require indulgence for in∣correct
and false reasonings, and think that the
truth of the premises are proved without more
ado by the truth of the conclusion, are en∣tirely
groundless. They, as well as all other
mortals, desire indulgence for inaccurate ex∣pressions,
but none for false reasoning; and for
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
following the exactest rules of logic, they
pride themselves in being the most perfect
patterns.</P>
<P>To make a thing plain as a proposition in
<HI>Euclid,</HI> is to give it the last degree of evidence.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Query 43.</NOTE> Nor is it any objection to the justness of their
reasoning, that an algebraical note is some∣times
to be interpreted, at the end of the pro∣cess,
in a sense which cou'd not have been
substituted in the beginning of it; since if
quantities themselves are considered as conti∣nually
changing, the sense of the mark which
represents or expresses them must, in order to
its doing so, continually change along with
them. And they never imagine that any par∣ticular
supposition can come under a general
case which is inconsistent with the reasoning
thereof, or any just reasoning whatsoever:
tho' they have many times good reason to
conclude that particular cases in a general theo∣rem
are true, tho' they could not be proved
in the same manner with the theorem itself.</P>
<P>To conclude; as I would not be thought,
by any thing I have said, to be an enemy
to true Logic and sound Metaphysics; and on
the contrary think the most general use of
the Mathematics is to inure us to a just way
of thinking and arguing; it is a proper in∣quiry,
I imagine, for those who have the
direction of the education of youth, in what
manner mathematical studies may be so pur∣sued
as most surely to answer this end: upon
which head the hints our Author gives, <HI>Queries</HI>
15, 38, 56, 57, deserve to be consider'd: for
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
so far as Mathematics do not tend to make men
more sober and rational thinkers, wiser and
better men, they are only to be considered as an
amusement, which ought not to take us off
from serious business.</P>
