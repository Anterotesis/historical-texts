<P>THE different and almost directly opposite derivations of the name of this river, that have been offered by the learned, afford ano∣ther striking proof of the general uncertainty of etymology. It has
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
been derived by Baxter from a British word, signifying "the extended river<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vide Glossarium Antiq. Brit. I. Baxter in verbo.</NOTE>;" while Skinner, on the other hand, deduces it from a Cambro-British epithet rendered by "pent in<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See Skinner in verbo.</NOTE>." Though the improbability of this last conjecture is evident, on the first sight of its wide and extensive bed, yet has it the sanction also of Cambden's authority, whom Somner suspects to have mistaken the sense of the British word,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
to which he refers it, and to have confounded it with a Saxon one, which greatly resembles it in sound<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>Tine, fluvius, hodièque sic dictus in Agro Northumbrensi:—So called, saith Cambden, if we may believe the Britons, for that by reason of his narrow banks he is strait pent in; for so signifieth tin, as they say, in the British tongue, so be.— For Britons and British, he should haply have rather said Saxons and Saxonic, the word being of that signification with these (as may be seen in Tinan), but not in those."—Somner, Saxon Dict. in verbo.</P>
<P>Bullet, in his Memoires sur la Langue Celtique, tom. i, p. 346, derives the name of our river from a Celtic word, signifying <HI>double,</HI> i. e. a river formed of two rivers. "La Tine, rivière formèe de deux rivieres. <HI>Ty,</HI> deux; <HI>Tyn,</HI> double. On a étendu par abus le nom de Tine à chacu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e des rivieres qui la forment."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The opinion that the names of our rivers are of Saxon origin, has been lately controverted by the author of the History of Manchester, who asserts, with great plausibility of argument, that most of them are British, and the same now as when first imposed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">"Few of the British names," says he, "have descended to us—The appellations of our places have been all lost, but those of our rivers are generally preserved; the former are confined to a small extent of region, and known only to a few; but rivers flow through a length of country, and communicate their names and waters to different districts and various associations of men; while those, therefore, are easily lost, these are pretty faithfully retained;— such are the Avons, the Cams, the Tynes, &amp;c." He adds, "I have previously shewn the word Avon to have been frequently contracted into A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, An, or Un, and as D'Avon and T'Avon are both the same with it, so are they contracted in the same manner; the latter is reduced into Tayne, the name of a frith in Scotland; into Taune or Tone, that of a river in Somersetshire; and into Teyne, that of a current in Staffordshire, &amp;c."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No literary monuments have been transmitted to inform us with certainty by what name this river was distinguished while the Roman legions were stationed on its banks.</P>
<P>It occurs not as a river of Northumberland in Ptolomy's ancient map of Britain; if it was not then called the Vedra, which is the name of a river marked in it, about the place where that of Tyne ought to be found<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Ptolomy is generally thought to have written under Trojan, who began his reign A. D. 99; Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius, who ended his in the year 162. His numerous and manifest errors are very discouraging; the learned and candid Baron Clerk said he always considered Ptolomy amongst the most incorrect of all ancient authors. Several things, however, as Horsley has observed, might justly be pleaded to excuse his inac∣curacies, and great allowances must be made for the time in which he wrote. This must apologize for his omission of the Tine, and of Newcastle under any name, "for," adds the same ingenious writer "unless Vedra mean the Tine, and Ostia Vedrae, the Roman station and town at the mouth of this river, near South-Sheilds, they are nameless in this Geographer."</P>
<P>See Bourne's History of Newcastle, p. 157.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7"/>The present appellation of this river is implied in the first accounts of a religious house at Tinmouth, evidently so called from its vicinity to the mouth of the Tyne, which was first erected a little after the beginning of the seventh century<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">A little after the year of Christ 617. See account of that monastery.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This river occurs, with its present name, in Bede's Church History, under the year 685<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bede is speaking of John, Bishop of Hexham, who had a hermitage opposite to that place, on the north side of the river: "Est mansio quaedam secretior nemore rara et vallo circumdata non longe ab Hagustaldensi Ecclesia, id est, unius fermè millarii et dimidii spatio, interfluente Tino amne separata, &amp;c." <BIBL>Bede, lib. v. cap. 2.</BIBL></NOTE>, and in an ancient record belonging to the church of Durham, sub anno 863<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">A.

<P>From records cited by Spearman, in his Inquiry into the State of Durham, it appears that, in the time of William the Conqueror, the boundaries of this river were described, at which early period the bishop of that see had the south part of it boundering upon this county palatine<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">"Turris London ss.

<P>The following is a just and accurate description of the river Tyne:</P>
<P>"The river Tyne rises from different sources; some of them about sixty miles to the north-west, and others about fifty to the west and south-west from Newcastle, and from thence to its entrance into the sea at Tynemouth is about ten miles; but if we measure by the windings of the river, it will be more in both cases.—The channel betwixt New∣castle and Tynemouth is of a very different width and depth, so that the tide is more rapid in some places than in others. The entrance into the harbour at the low lights is very narrow; but the channel forms into a fine large bason for the whole length of Sheilds, capable of holdin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> above two thousand sail of large ships. Above which, the tide spread<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over the extensive slats of Jarrow-Slake; and then, for a great length some a remarkably fine broad and deep pool called the Long-Reach, all which contain an immense quantity of water. After this the tide is obstructed by several windings and narrow places in the channel, till it comes within about a mile of Newcastle, where it runs in an open and wider pool, till it flows about two miles above the town, when it is a good deal intercepted in its course by a large island, consisting of many acres, called the King's Meadows; after flowing round this island by two narrow channels, and through several beautiful windings, it rises a little above the village of Newburn; in all about seven or eight miles above New∣castle.</P>
<P>"The tides commonly flow about four hours and a half, and ebb about seven hours and a half at Newcastle bridge: and the perpendicular rise of the river here in a spring tide will sometimes be about eleven or twelve feet, and at Tynemouth bar about eighteen feet: but both these circumstances vary greatly from the different winds, and the different quan∣tities of fresh water in the river: in a north-westerly wind they will sometimes rise three feet higher than is mentioned above; and in a south-westerly one, sometimes scarcely half so high: and in some of our great land floods, the tide has not sufficient forces to stem and turn the current, which will set downwards during the whole swell of the tide."</P>

<P><PB N="14" REF="17"/>About the year 1414, a third part of the river Tyne, and of the bridge at Newcastle, was ascertained to belong to the Bishop of Dur∣ham<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Spearman's Durham, p. 10.

<P>A. D. 1416, there appears to have been a cause depending between the church of Durham and the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle, concerning the holding of markets at South-Sheilds for fish, bread, and beer, and concerning the right of wrecks and fishery in the Tyne<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot"><P>In a MS. in the Cotton library, sub effigie Vitellii A. 9. occur: "Responsiones prioris Dunelm' ad querelas majoris &amp; burgensium ville Novi Castri super Tin"—which is in the nature of a breviat, or instruction<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drawn up by Prior Wossington of Durham, for counsel to plead in a cause that was then depending between the church and town, about holding markets at South-Sheilds, for fish, bread, and beer, and the right of wrecks and fishery in the river."—Dr. Ellison's MSS.</P>
<P>It appears, by an inquisition taken at Newcastle upon Tyne on the Tuesday in Easter week, 1417, that anciently all those fishermen that went out to fish at sea from that port, were accustomed to live in a street assigned to them in that town, called Fisher-Gate, to prevent the regrating of the fish before they were brought up to that town, and had paid the king his customs and prizes.—Murray MS. p. 235.</P>
<P>By another inquisition taken at the same town on the Thursday following, it appears that complaints had been exhibited against the priors of Durham and Tinmouth; as also against the abbot of Newminster, for making wears in the river Tyne, which en∣croached on the deep course of the water, that is the king's stream, called the channel and middleway, and for having nets of such small size as to destroy the brood of salmon and other fishes.—Ibid. p. 211.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>The proper disposal of the gravel, &amp;c. brought for the purpose of ballasting the empty ships that traded hither for coal, appears at this early period to have been an object of con∣cern to the corporation of Newcastle, without whose intervention it is not improbable but that the bed of the Tyne had been choked up long ago with this adventitious matter and one of the most important of our rivers by that means rendered unnavigable. The mayor and burgesses of Newcastle, it should seem, were at this time first invested with the power of depositing this ballast where there would be the least danger of its falling into and damaging their river, although in several contests concerning this power they have been desirous of claiming it by prescription as conservators of the Tyne, strengthened by an ad∣ditional authority derived to them from the statute 34 Hen. VIII. cap. 9.</P>
<P>From the circumstance of this being the first mention that occurs of ballast-shores, it seems probable that the coal trade was now first beginning to be of considerable conse∣quence. In a course of years and great increase of commerce, these ballast-shores have crowded the banks of the Tyne on both sides with artificial mountains.</P>
<P>Bourne tells us that a place below Sand-Gate, where there is at present a great ropery, was the first ballast-shore out of the town, the site of which, as also of the burying-ground, which still retains the name of Ballast-Hills, a little lower down the river, had been pur∣chased by the corporation of Newcastle of the Lords of Biker, for that and other purposes.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>The following passage occurs in North's Life of Lord-Keeper North, written in the time of Charles II. p. 121. "Ever since ships have been built larger, partly for better roads, and partly for better pilotage, the port towns have crept nearer the main; as they say would happen upon the Tyne: and Sheilds would become the port-town, if Newcastle had not a privilege, that no common baker or brewer should set up between them and the sea."</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>In the years 1694, 1697, and 1698, the great cause was in agi∣tation, between the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle upon Tyne, plaintiffs, and the dean and chapter of Durham, and Samuel Shep∣herd, defendants, concerning a ballast-key, or wharf, at Westoe, or Jarrow-Slake.

<P>About this time was published "A Draught or Map of the River Tyne," by Capt. G. Collins, II. Moll, sculpsit, dedicated to the Trinity-House of Newcastle.

This suit commenced on the following occasion: Vinkeston, after loading his ship at Newcastle, refused to pay the toll of five-pence for every chaldron of coals shipped in that harbour, and due to the above corporation, for their charge in maintaining the port of that town; for which the defendant seized her anchor, cable, and sails.

<P>It appears from the votes of the House of Commons, June 6th, 1701, that a petition from the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle upon Tyne was presented, and referred to a committee of the whole house, in favour of the numerous body employed in the salt-works upon the river Tyne; who, from the great decay of that trade, were reduced to the lowest indigence, and became a burden to the said town, and places adjacent.

<P>A. D. 1705, there was an attempt made to procure an act of parliament to make the river Were navigable, and to build a pier or piers at Sunderland by the sea: upon which occasion the corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne requested their members to oppose the in∣tended bill, and prevent its passing into a law<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Common-council books. 22d June, 1717, the royal assent was given to this bill.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the year 1706, it appears to have been in agitation to remove the rocks, called "the Black-Middens," near the entrance of the river Tyne into the sea, which had long been complained of as great nuisances to the navigation of that river. This design was, however, never carried into execution: the scheme was revived at two different times afterwards, but to no better purpose than at first<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About the year 1711, when an order of parliament passed for leave to bring in a bill, for making the river Tyne navigable from New∣burn to Hexham, the corporation of Newcastle opposed this scheme, as a project, that, if proceeded in, would be of great damage to the river and port of Newcastle<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>About the year 1726, the Trinity-House of Newcastle petitioned the mayor and aldermen of that town, concerning several sands in the river Tyne; setting forth, that the channel was much straitened and choaked up; a circumstance occasioned, in their opinion, by the building of Willington-Quay, and the custom of taking ballast out of ships into keels.

<P>It appears, January 12th, 1740, that the Tyne was frozen so hard, that all manner of diversions were daily pursued thereon, as sliding, jumping, running, foot-ball; dressing of meat, and selling all kinds of liquors in tents. The continual concourse of persons of both sexes made it resemble a fair. Upwards of 800 keels were laid off work.</P>

<P>In the year 1635, King Charles, by his proclamation, prohibited the importation of any sort of glass from foreign parts, during the term granted by King James to Sir Robert Mansell, for the sole making of that commodity: In this proclamation it is set forth that "Sir Robert Mansell had by his industry and great expence perfected that manufac∣ture, with sea-coal or pit coal, whereby not only the woods and timber of this kingdom are greatly preserved, but the making of all kinds of

It appears that King James, in the 13th year of his reign, had prohibited the making of glass with wood firing, for the better preserving of timber, and also had prohibited the importation of foreign glass. King Charles's proclamation tells us "our subjects now are furnished with glass at far more moderate prices than they were when it was brought from foreign parts." Yet Sir Robert Mansell is permitted to import such glasses from Venice, Morana, and other parts of Italy, as he should think fit for special uses and services.—Anderson, in his Dictionary of Commerce, vol. ii. p. 54, understands this permission as relating to the fine Venetian flint glasses for drinking, the making of which in England was not brought to perfection till the reign of King William the Third.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>MONASTERY OF JARROW.</HEAD>
<P>THIS house, which was of the Benedictine order<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Bede's Lives of the Abbots of Weremouth and Jarrow, edited by Ware, p. 230, 235.</NOTE>, was originally annexed to the neighbouring monastery of Weremouth; so that they stand inseparably connected in the earlier parts of their common history.</P>
<P>Both were founded towards the end of the seventh century, chiefly under the auspices of Benedict Biscop<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>Bede styles him "Biscopus cognomento Benedictus." He was a native of North∣umberland, and descended from a noble family of the Angles: having been rewarded with lands for his military services, by Oswy, king of Northumberland, he betook him∣self to a religious life, and went to Rome, according to the prevailing practice among the new and zealous converts to Christianity, of visiting the holy see. Unsatisfied with the first, he appears to have made a second voyage thither, soon after his return to Britain, and was to have been accompanied in it by Alchfrid, the king's son, if that pious prince had not been prevented by his father's express injunctions to the contrary. Afterwards having taken the tonsure, he was two years a monk in the isle of St. Honorat, in France, and going a third time to Rome, was deputed from thence, by Pope Vitalian, in company with Theodore and Adrian, two distinguished ecclesiasties, emi∣nent for both sacred and profane learning, as a missionary into Britain.</P>
<P>Settling in Kent, where Theodore was appointed archbishop of Canterbury, and Benedict, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul in that city, after two year<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Benedict went a fourth time to Rome, to purchase sacred books, &amp;c. purposing on his return to have put himself under the protection of Coynwalh, king of the West <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but finding that king dead on his arrival, he returned to Northumberland, and, with the assistance of King Ecfrid, founded the above monasteries of Weremouth and Jarrow. Leland, on I know not what authority, has asserted, that Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury, founded the monastery of St. Peter, at the mouth of the Were, and also this at Jarrow, in honour of St. Paul.—Collectanea, vol. iv. tom. iii. p. 70.</P></NOTE>, a Saxon monk, of great eminence in his time, who having been a soldier in his earlier youth,
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
devoted himself to religion at the age of twenty-five; and, having taken the tonsure, became a zealous teacher, and, as it were, missionary of the monastic life.</P>
<P>Under the protection of Egfrid, King of Northumberland, who gave the site<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Egfrid, who had four years before succeeded his father Oswy, in the kingdom of Northumberland, gave Benedict 70 families of land, on the above occasion. Sir James Ware supposes that hides, or carrneates, are here intended by the expression "families of land."</P>
<P>The same king gave afterwards 40 families of land more, in augmentation of the first endowment.—Bede Vit. Abbat. ut supra, 224.</P></NOTE>, together with an ample endowment of land; and, assisted by the skill of an able and zealous coadjutor, named Ceolfrid<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 239.</NOTE>, A. D. 674, this Benedict began to lay the foundations of a monastery, near the mouth, and on the northern bank of the river Were, in ho∣nour of St. Peter, the prince of the apostles. Benedict made a voyage into France the year following, and brought back with him skilful masons to build the church of that abbey<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>He constructed the church of stone, after the manner of the Roman architecture, and adorned its walls and roofs with pictures which he had purchased at Rome, representing, among other sacred subjects, the Virgin Mary, the twelve apostles, the evangelical history, and the visions of the Apocalypse. The windows were glazed by artists brought from France. He added to his monastery an ample library, which he stored with Greek and Latin volumes, imported by himself from Italy. Ceolfrid, his successor, augmented this collection with three volumes of pandects, and a book of cosmography, wonderfully enriched with curious workmanship, and bought at Rome.</P>
<BIBL>See Bede's Hist. Abbat. Wiremuth. p. 295, 297, edit. Cantab.</BIBL>
<P>In one of his expeditions to Rome, he brought over John, Arch-chanter of St. Peter's in that city, who introduced the Roman method of singing mass.—Bede, ibid. p. 295.</P>
<P>He taught the monks of Benedict's Abbey, and all the singers of the monasteries of that province came from various parts to hear him sing.—Bede's Hist. Eccles. iv. 18.

It has two fleurs de lis on it, which sufficiently intimate in what country it was cast. Bede tells us, "Cuncta quae ad altaris et ecclesiae ministerium competebant, vasa sancta, vel vesti∣menta, quia domi invenire non potuit, de transmarinis regionibus advectare religiosus emptor curabat." He is speaking of Benedict, and just before the above passage men∣tions his sending to France for masons and glass-makers. This is certainly one of the first bells used for religious purposes in England.</P>
<P>It is observable in the inscription on this bell (see plate of Miscellaneous Antiquities, N<SUP>o</SUP> 8.), which is plainly to be understood "SANCTE PAULE ORA PRO NOBIS," that the A in ORA, the R in PRO, and the N in NOBIS, have, probably through the ignorance of the founder, been turned upside down in the mould. To the same cause may be attributed the transposition of some of the letters; the V after the L in PALUS, ought to precede it; and the S that follows, be taken to the end of the word NOBIS, where, instead of that letter, there is an E turned upside down, which ought to follow the L, and make the word "Paule," in the vocative case, to agree with "Sancte." That the fleurs de lis were then in the arms of France, see Edmondson's Complete Body of Heraldry. vol. i. p. 3, where he cites several ancient authors, for the fabulous account that a banner, whereon were depicted three lilies, or, on a field azure, was sent from heaven to Clovis, the first Christian monarch of France, who began his reign A. D. 486. The diameter of this bell is nearly 29 inches, and its greatest circumference 78 inches.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>During the absence of Benedict and Ceolfrid, on their visit to the holy see, the church of Jarrow monastery appears to have been com∣pleted.

<P>The stone is of two pieces, joined in the middle. Mr. Allison, the mason and master builder, informed me, that they had been wrought so originally. The piece se∣parated by a crack running through the L C and D, was found cramped on with an iron cramp when taken out. The most minute particulars are interesting concerning a stone, which bears one of the most curious inscriptions now remaining in the island.</P>

<P>Grose, in his account of Jarrow, tells us, that, "in the space between the third and fourth line, there is a roughness on the surface of the stone, seemingly as if a line had been erased." On taking it out of the north wall, A. D. 1782, when Jarrow-church was altered and repaired, it was discovered to be of two pieces, at the juncture of which this roughness appeared.</P>

<P>There is an engraving of Jarrow in Buck's Views—Grose's collection contains a view of the monastery of Jarrow, or Gyrwi, engraved by Sparrow—with the following ac∣count of the place: "The site is an eminence on the south side of the river Tyne, about five miles east of, or below, Newcastle. Its bounds do not seem to have been very ex∣tensive; neither was the place judiciously chosen with respect to healthfulness, there being a large marshy spot bordering it on the south: and when the tide is out, scarce any thing but stinking ouse remains in the bed of the creek that runs close under it, over which is the bridge seen in the view.</P>
<P>The remains consist of the chapel, now converted into a parish church, and several walls and fragments of the offices of the abbey. In some are circular arches, but the greatest number are pointed. Some cottages have been patched up here, partly with the standing walls of the old building, and partly with the materials pulled down. Several pieces of short columns with Saxon capitals lie scattered amongst the rubbish.</P>

But what is esteemed the greatest curiosity, and as such is carefully kept under lock and key in the vestry, is the chair of venerable Bede, a great two armed chair said to have been deposited here ever since the dissolution of the monastery. It is of oak, and appears to have been hewn out with an axe, except that at the top of the back the cross piece is mortised to the standards, or upright parts, which serve both for legs and its support; these, with the seat and sides, are very ancient; but the back, according to the person who shews it, has been since added. Various are the superstitions and ridicu∣lous stories told of this place, among which are these: "That it was never dark in Jarrow church; and that the windows were of horn instead of glass." The latter perhaps re∣lates to some almost forgotten tradition, concerning the introduction of glass by Benedict."</P>

<HEAD>MONASTERY AND CASTLE OF TINMOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING what has been advanced to the contrary by the learned Horsley, some recent discoveries seem clearly to prove to us, that the Romans had a station in this place during their resi∣dence in Britain<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>See Miscellaneous Antiquities (plate of) No. 11, 12, 13, 14.—No. 11 is an exact representation of the front of a Roman altar found in Tinmouth Castle in Northumber∣land, by Major Durnford, at the depth of six feet in the earth, where it had been laid as a foundation stone, probably of the ancient Christian church, which is said to have been erected there soon after the introduction of that faith into Britain. The lower part of it, by whatever accident, is much defaced, and it is at present quite flat at the top, though we may suppose it to have had originally a focus there, which the workmen, in order to make it square and bed properly, may have been obliged to take off. The inscription is plainly to be read: "Jovi optimo maximo Aelius Rufus Praefectus Cohortis quartae Lin∣gonum." The Lingones were a people of Champagne in France, and are well known to have been among the Roman auxiliary troops of infantry, but this is our first informa∣tion where the fourth cohort of them was stationed in Britain.</P>
<P>No. 12, represents a stone nearly square, one foot nine inches by one foot ten, which was found also in the same place, June 12, 1783, where it had been laid in the foundation of some of the ancient buildings.</P>
<P>The first letter of what I call the first line of the inscription, is confessedly faint and doubtful: the second letter appears plainly to be a Y, as does the third to be an R, though at first sight it resembles a P. There can be no doubt concerning any of the others. Whether or not the stone, which I take to have been a tablet on a temple erected there to some god of the winds, has undergone any alterations, when it was wrought up in the Christian structure, I am not able to ascertain. As there are none but the most usual contractions in the other lines, I was induced to think there was none in the first, and therefore read the whole:
<Q><L>Gyrum, Cumbas, et Templum secit Caius Julius Verus</L>
<L>Maximinus Legionis sextae victricis ex voto.</L></Q>
I suppose Gyrum to mean here "a circular harbour for the shipping," and, in favour of this hypothesis, have to observe that there is still a recess of that form, called Prior's Haven, adjoining on the south to Tinmouth Castle, which has every appearance of hav∣ing been one of the artificial harbours of that great people, and is, I presume, the place alluded to in the inscription.</P>
<P>Scheffer, in his Book de Militia Navali Veterum, p. 212, cites Columella, lib. ix. as describing the ancient mode of making harbours in the following words: "praejaciuntur in Gyrum moles."</P>
<P>This word seems to have been corrupted afterwards into "Gyrrus," in the base Latinity: see Dufresne in verbo, where he gives us a quotation from an authority of the date of A. D. 1064, in which the following passage occurs: "Eant et redeant piscatores Gyr∣rum." If this does not mean that "The fishermen shall have ingress and regress to and from the harbour," I fear it will be difficult to point out its signification.</P>
<P>Scheffer abovecited, p. 71, speaking of the word "Cumba" being frequently used for "Cymba" tells us: "Cumbam nominat quam supra Cymbam diximus, usitata Latinis scribendi consuetudine, qua U Graecorum in U suum vertunt."</P>
<P>"Fecit" is with the strictest propriety used here to signify "making" a harbour, "building" ships or barges, and "erecting" a temple.</P>
<P>If this Maximinus be the person who was afterwards made emperor, this inscription may be dated some little time before A. D. 235.</P>

<P><PB N="80" REF="86"/>The honest but credulous Matthew Paris relates, that a wicked monk of St Albans, who had been banished, as their manner was with de∣linquents of that monastery, for the crime of forgery and for having stolen the seal of the house, to their cell at Tinmouth, in the time of John, elected abbot in the year 1195, and who died in 1214, instead of profiting by his punishment, still continued to lead a debauched and impenitent life, and made here a truly horrid and lamentable end<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">"There was at that time in the monastery, one who wore the habit, but was not a monk, but like Lucifer among the angels, or Judas among the apostles, a most wicked hypocrite among the religious men. This man, whose name was William Pigun, be∣ing corrupted by Robert our adversary, thrust himself busily, as it were, to assist them, among those appointed to search the writings of the house; and, observing that the common-seal was not so strictly watched as it ought to have been, being kept among these writings, he artfully found an opportunity, whilst the others were busy, to put the seal to a counterfeit deed prepared for that purpose, and delivered the same to the afore∣said Robert, our adversary; who, having got it into his hands, began to boast that he had not yet produced that which would confound all his opposers. This being told to the abbot, he soon concluded that there must needs have been some treachery in his own house, and, sifting into the matter, the fraud was detected, and the manager of the same convicted; whereupon he was sent away to the cell of Thinemue, there to do perpetual penance for his crime. Being implacable, he often bitterly cursed the abbot, who had sent him to Thinemue: but all his curses fell upon his own head; for, falling asleep in the necessary-house, when he had over-eaten and drank, he never waked again; and the monks who were in the dortor distinctly heard a voice crying in the privy, Take him, Satan—take him, Satan." <BIBL>Matthew Paris, and Stevens' Contin. of Dugdale, vol. i. p. 253</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>

<P>"On the death of John, abbot of St. Albans, A. D. 1214, William Trumpinton was elected to that abbacy. After the death of King John, he visited Thynemue, and other cells. When the abbot goes to Thynemue, he is to be attended by six esquires, who to this effect have extraordinary feofs of the land of the church. These six are at the abbot's charge, both going and coming; but upon their own horses, the which to be sightly and strong enough to carry, according to custom, if need be, the habits of a monk behind each squire. If any horse belonging to any of these squires shall happen to die by the way, the abbot is to give him ten shillings for his loss. It is to be observed that the abbot is to ask the king's licence to go to such remote parts of the kingdom, and so near to Scotland, whensoever he designs to repair to Thynmue. When arrived there, he is to behave himself modestly, correcting the family, not to be a tyrant, not squandering the provisions and stores of the house; but considering he is come thither to reform all that requires it, and to visit his flock with fatherly affection. This abbot pro∣ceeded to Thynemue, attended by such a multitude as looked like an army. There he reformed what was amiss, and was desired by the prior to discharge him of that office, because he was grown old. The old prior of Thynemue with much difficulty obtained leave to quit that dignity, and was all the rest of his life kept by the abbot as his coun∣sellor, and at his table." This abbot had before banished his prior Reimund to the cell of Thinemue, "which is a place of banishment for our monks."</P></NOTE>, William Trumpinton, abbot of St. Albans,
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
visited Tinmouth, and the other cells of that monastery. The mode of his visitation of this place was as follows: he had six esquires to ac∣company him, who were on that account well enfeoffed with lands of that church. These esquires travelled on their own horses, but were supported at the abbot's expencc; these horses were to be good ones, each able to carry an esquire, and, if need required, a monk's clothes behind him; and for every one of them that should happen to die on the journey, the abbot was to allow ten shillings. It appears on this occasion that the abbot was not permitted to visit these remote parts, bordering on the kingdom of Scotland, without a special licence from the King.</P>

Hereupon many of the honest soldiers got over the wall; a corporal refused to yield hereunto, forthwith the lieutenant-colonel run him through. After this he sends down to Sheilds, and towns ad∣jacent, desiring such as love King Charles, to join with him for his assistance: which many did accordingly. This said news being brought presently to Newcastle, Sir Arthur Haslerigg draws out a considerable brigade of foot, and an hundred dragoons, and gives them in command to Lieutenant-Colonel Ashfield, and Major Cobham, with orders to storm the castle with expedition. They advance all night, ladders are sent after them by sea; about two in the morning they fall to work, the ladders prove too short; the lieu∣tenant colonel fires four pieces of ordnance upon the stormers; they, not discouraged, force in at the port-holes, and, after a short dispute, become possessors of the castle, and masters of the soldiers, who cry out for quarter, and then yield. Many of these within were slain; amongst the rest the perfidious governor's body was found: three of the stormers were wounded, but one slain."</P>

<P>The following occurs in the London Gazette: "War-Office, February 27th, 1779. Colonel Spencer Cowper, lieutenant-governor of Tinmouth Castle."</P>
<P>I made the subsequent observations on a visit to the remains of this place, June 20th, 1780.</P>
<P>In the ruins of Tinmouth monastery there are still observable three recesses in the south wall, near the entrance to the oratory of St. Mary; one is said to have been the confessional chair, divided by a stone partition, where there has been anciently a grate.—Another of them has evidently been the cavity for containing the holy water, and the third the closet for the consecrated host.—It is remarkable that the capitals of the columns have each of them a different kind of ornament.</P>
<P>The oratory of St. Mary has been cleaned out by order of the governor, and shut up to preserve it from future desecrations.</P>
<P>On the outside of this oratory, are cut in a sort of blue stone, different from the rest, now almost defaced by time and the fret of the sea, the arms of Tinmouth priory, viz. gules, three crowns or: those of the abbey of St. Albans, <HI>i. e.</HI> azure, a cross saltire or, as used at present by the borough of St. Albans; and in the middle the common Greek abbreviation of the name of Jesus, erroneously interpreted Jesus hominum salvator— for it consists of a Greek <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ota, epsilon and sigma.—The arms of Tinmouth priory were originally those of Oswin, King of Northumberland.—See Miscellaneous Antiquities, (plate of,) No. 1.</P>
<P>Among the ruins in the west part of the church, is a pillar of the very rudest Saxon architecture, which has probably been a part of the original building. On the south side of the grand entrance to the church is a Saxon arch with a Gothic capital.</P>
<P>I observed a whimsical anachronism in sculpture on an upright stone in the priory church∣yard, where in the crest of the shipwright's arms Noah's ark is pierced for guns, and has a quarter-deck. "The 30th of February" occurs on a grave-stone. In an inscription on a stone covering the remains of a child of five years of age, the infant (for want of proper pointing) is plainly made to have a wife and child. A person of the same name with Baronet Liddell has taken the arms of that family upon his tomb-stone, forgetting to omit the hand, gules, of Ulster.—The following quaint inscription occurs, ibid.</P>
<Q><L>"John Grant died April, 1779.</L>
<L>God did call and he is gone</L>
<L>When Death doth come he spareth no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</L>
<L>To his wife and children was good and just</L>
<L>And to his family was one of the best</L>
<L>And to his kindred kind withal</L>
<L>Which makes them to lament his call."</L></Q>
<P>I read also the following: "In memory of Robert Smith, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> late captain-lieutenant in the Royal South Lincoln militia, who departed this life January 11th, 1781, aged 46 years"—"In memory of Sarah, daughter of the Rev.

<P>Mention occurs in the common-council books, January 20th, 1766, of the Barons of the Exchequer at Westminster having ordered that, for the future, the sheriffs clerk of Newcastle shall always attend for passing the sheriff's accounts.</P>
<P>I am indebted for the subsequent very interesting strictures on Mr. Wallis's most erro∣neous account (See his History of Northumberland) of the courts of Newcastle upon Tyne, to the above Nathanael Punshon, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> under sheriff.</P>
<P>"Mr. Wallis has been misinformed in almost every instance respecting the civil government of Newcastle. Speaking of the mayor's court of record, he says, "No attor∣neys are allowed to plead in it, but such as are free of the corporation." By which, one would suppose he means free burgesses: if this be his meaning, he is mistaken; for if an attorney be regularly admitted at Westminster, having served his clerkship to an attorney of the mayor's court, he has a right to be admitted there, whether he be a free∣man or not.—He says, "It has six serjeants at mace to attend it."—Now there are eight, <HI>viz.</HI> The water-bailiff, who bears the great mace, the sheriff's serjeant, and six common serjeants, who are all serjeants at mace, and called so in the charter.—"An action com∣menced in it may be brought to trial for 30<ABBR>s.</ABBR> but will cost more money and time in the sheriff's court, out of which an action may be removed into the mayor's at any time before a jury is sworn; but not of the mayor's into the sheriff's." Here again he is wrong; in the first place, it is very seldom that either the mayor's or sheriff's court takes cogni∣zance of debts under 40 shillings, being restrained by a clause in the act of parliament (of William and Mary) establishing the Court of Requests, commonly called the Court of Conscience, from holding pleas of such small debts, except for rent reserved upon lease, and some other causes of action, which the Court of Conscience does not extend to. Then with respect to the removal of causes from the sheriff's court to the mayor's, there never was an instance of any such removal; for no cause can be removed either from the sheriff's court to the mayor's, or from the mayor's to the sheriff's. These two courts are coeval, being instituted by the same charter (more strictly speaking, they may be said to be con∣tinued by the same charter); they are of similar jurisdiction and practice, and only differ in this particular, <HI>viz.</HI> that actions are brought against free burgesses in the mayor's court, and against foreigners, or non-freemen in the sheriff's. "The juries of this and the sheriff's court are the same; they are returned every Christmas by the several wards of the corporation, at their wardmote inquest, where particular wards appoint persons to serve as jurymen for every month in the year."—There is no such court as that of a ward∣mote in Newcastle at present; nor do I believe there ever was, though the town is divided into wards, and constables appointed to each.</P>
<P>"Upon a cause being removed out of the sheriff's court into this (the mayor's), and it appearing to the mayor that a verdict hath been obtained against the plaintiff for more than his just debt, the mayor may remit the cause to judgment for the just debt only." After observing that causes are not removed, or removable, in this manner, it is needless to say that there is no such practice in Newcastle.</P>
<P>With regard to the sheriff's court, he says, "The attorneys who plead in it are ap∣pointed by the mayor and court of aldermen." There is no court of aldermen in New∣castle. The attorneys are admitted there in the same manner as in the mayor's court.</P>
<P>The fees mentioned by Mr. Wallis are very different from what are taken and al∣lowed. Indeed, they were not well known, and consequently different charges were often made till the 15th and 19th of June, 1767, one being the mayor's, and the other the sheriff's jury day, when the fees of the two courts were settled. "The defendant may (after the verdict is given, and before judgment is entered) stop judgment by taking the cause before the mayor, for time to pay the money recovered." There never was a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> such practice in Newcastle. "If either party cannot stay in town till the day of trial, his testimony in writing will be allowed for good evidence." By the word party, I sup∣pose he means the plaintiff or defendant; and if this were allowed, it would be such an inducement to perjury as never was known, or admitted in any court of law.</P>
<P>The court of guild is holden thrice a year, as Mr. Wallis observes, but not for the purposes he mentions; the principal business of the guild is for the apprentices and sons of freemen to petition for their freedom; they are called by the style of the company that their masters or fathers were of: this is what is termed "calling their guilds." And the wardens and stewards of each company attend there to put a stop to, or prevent any person from obtaining his freedom, who, they apprehend, is not entitled to it. An apprentice<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> called thrice in guild, or rather at three different guilded <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; the son of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only once. And if an objection be made, or a stop put to his guild, the person making the objection is summoned before the common-council, to give his reason for stopping the guild. And if he shew good cause for making the objection, then the person applying cannot be sworn a freeman till the objection be removed. But if no stop be put, or ob∣jection made at guild, then the person applying may at any time afterwards be sworn a free burgess before the mayor, or any other magistrate. This is the principal business of the court, and not for turning over apprentices, or hearing differences between them and their masters, as Mr. Wallis tells us. The oath taken by a freeman on his admission, is very different from that mentioned by Mr. Wallis. Hence it appears, that he has been strangely misinformed with respect to the different courts in Newcastle; and as he has men∣tioned some that neither do, nor ever did exist there; so also he has omitted to mention one, <HI>i. e.</HI> the county court, that still continues to be held."</P>
<P>In the time of the commonwealth, it appears that the magistrates of Newcastle upon Tyne punished scolds with the branks, and drunkards by making them carry a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b, called the drunkard's cloak, through the streets of that town. We shall presume that there i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no longer any occasion for the former, but why has the latter been laid aside?</P>

<P>Also why they claimed to have two-pence for toll of every chalder of coals bought and shipped there, and to be conveyed from thence; one shilling and nine-pence for every ship and boat brought into the port; to take of every one bringing in any grain into the said port a boll out of every ten chaldron brought in; to have justices of peace within the town, and a clerk of the peace there; to hold pleas of action popular, and of several penal statutes of causes arising there, and belong∣ing to justices of peace, of Oyer and Terminer; to take the issues, fines, amercements, and other profits before justices of peace, and in other places aforesaid; to erect a gallows, have coroners, eschaetors, returns of writs in the town and liberties; to have felons goods there; to have and build ballast-shores within a mile of the town on each side of the river, and compel every one that imported or exported any merchandize in that port to cast their ballast on those shores, and not
<PB N="193" REF="202"/>
elsewhere, upon certain pains and penalties; to imprison and detain the ships on the non-payment thereof; to take an oath touching the cast∣ing of ballast within a mile of the port; elect a mayor, and so forth— all which the mayor and burgesses claimed, and set forth their right at large, and the warrant by which they claimed them. And upon a view of the acts of parliament, letters patent, allowances, and other records, writings, and ancient books of the mayor and burgesses shewn to the King's attorney-general, and examined by him; and also upon testimony of witnesses in the court of King's Bench, who deposed that the said mayor and burgesses had held, used, and enjoyed all and singular the said liberties, privileges, and franchises which they claimed, the said attorney-general acknowledged and confessed the same.</P>
<P>And thereupon, after due and mature deliberation, the King's serjeant and the said attorney-general being called thereto and present, the Court of King's Bench adjudged that the said mayor and burgesses, and their successors, should use, have, and enjoy, by virtue of the premises, all and singular the said liberties, privileges, franchises, and free customs which they claimed and challenged, and that they should be allowed and adjudged to them.</P>
<P>February 3d, 1664, King Charles II. granted a charter of Inspexi∣mus, confirming the preceding ones of the 42d of Queen Elizabeth, and the 2d of James I. with their ancient privileges, &amp;c. to the town of Newcastle upon Tyne, at the former rent of one hundred pounds per annum.

<P>In the year 1353 King Edward III. on a slight put upon him by the Flemings, whose Earl, though affianced to one of his, had married a daughter of the Duke of Brabant, removed the staple of English wool into England, when Newcastle upon Tyne, in common with nine others, was first made a staple town<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><P>Rot.

<P>It appears from Rymer's Foedera, tom. v. p. 875, that a royal licence, dated Novem∣ber 25th, 1356, was granted to Thomas Grey, then a prisoner in Scotland, a circumstance to which, probably, he owed the indulgence to ship an hundred sacks of his wool at Ber∣wick upon Tweed for Flanders, without carrying them to the port of Newcastle upon Tyne, where of right they ought to have been shipped.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>Parrot, or kennel coal is distinguished by producing a more copious bright flame than common coal. It is distinguished too by having a much closer texture, admitting a polish, and is often turned into toy.</P>
<P>Common coal has a much looser texture, and is divided into masses by numerous cracks and flaws, so that it generally breaks into masses of cubical figures.</P>
<P>Blacksmith's coal gives out less flame, but undergoes a sort of fusion, and unites into masses, forming a cinder, which is afterwards capable of producing a violent heat. It is valued because it is perfectly free of sulphur.</P>
<P>Kilkenny coal burns like charcoal, with a bright transparent blue flame, like that of spirit of wine, and without any appearance of smoke, leaving only a very small quantity of ashes. There is however a volatile vapour, probably fixed air, which rises from it, and gives a disagreeable smell in the house where it is used. There are many strata of it in the west of Scotland.

There are manifest traces of wood converted into a sort of charcoal: I have not many specimens of these extraneous sub∣stances, but this structure like charcoal is sufficiently common. 'Tis also very common in all the different kinds of coal to meet with a substance which is composed of small fibres, and separable from each other like the softer kinds of charcoal." In proof of this hypo∣thesis he adds farther, "In different parts of the world we find very large quantities of trees, forming beds with other strata over them, crushed together, but not united and blended so much as beds of coal, so that the branches, &amp;c. of the trees may be discover∣ed: of these some are found near Exeter in Devonshire (Bovey coal) in large masses, re∣sembling wood in structure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. president of the Royal Society, so eminent for his knowledge in natural his∣tory, favoured me with the inspection of a large specimen of fossil, found in Iceland, in strata, of consider∣able thickness, and at great depths, which seems to exhibit a substantial proof that coal originally was wood. He has preserved several trunks of it, each of which is flattened, possibly by the weight of super-incumbent strata, so that, instead of being cylindrical, as the body or root of a tree naturally is, it is that. Some of them are more and some less woody. One is a fan plank of wood.

There are beds of this kind also in some parts of Germany, as we are informed in the Berlin Transactions.—The strata of coal are always found mixed with other strata, which are recent, or produced as it were by accident: they are always mixed with strata of free-stone; the constitution of which free-stone, with many phenomena relating to it, on examination, leave no room to doubt its being composed of beds of sand, fastened to∣gether in some particular manner, and which have been washed by the sea: often too it is marked by worms and other marine animals: coal, therefore, as being found intermixed with strata of this kind quite recent, may on this account be supposed to be a substance generated in the same manner, or that it is composed of matter, which, having been bu∣ried by a length of time, had been crushed into a solid form."—Black's Lectures MS. ut supra.</P>
<P>Dr. Moyse, in his lectures which I attended at Newcastle upon Tyne a few years ago, supposed coal to have been originally wood of the fir or pine sort, as it produce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tar as those trees do. He shewed that the branches of trees, or their resemblances, were some∣times found in it: as were also reeds, the hollow part of which was full of clay—that split, as it were, in some directions, it shews its woody texture; and, lastly, that the wood part remains still at the top of the strata.</P>

<P>This writer observes also, "that besides the impressions of plants, that often occur in the roof of coal mines, we likewise meet with frequently in their vicinity, or in the pits made for working them, large portions of wood and even entire trees.</P>
<P>"Near Luxemburg, at a short distance from the coal mines, are found considerable quan∣tities of petrified wood. The Abbot de Sauvages makes mention, in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1743, of some fragments of stony wood, strongly incrusted up in the bark, with one or two inches of coal, in which this petrifaction was performed. It is very common to find, lying over coal mines, wood which is not entirely dissolved; but according as it is buried to a greater depth, it is more sensibly altered.</P>
<P>"At Brull, near Cologn and Bonn, M. de Bury, a famous collier of Liege, by dig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing into a v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lley, found a sort of earth coal, which was nothing else but wood, that had been covered by a mountain of earth. There are several mines wherein none can mistake the trunks and branches of trees, and other remains of wood; heaps of fossil wood are met with at a great depth, disposed by benches, and separated from one another by beds of earth, and all of them affording good reason to suspect a passing of the ligneous nature, or a true transmutation of wood into coal. At the bottom of that chain of mountains that runs from Lyons to Strasburgh, on the high road between these two cities, M. Fontaine, of the Academy of Sciences, discovered one of those subterraneous forests, and took with him to Paris several of the pieces, collected at hazard, which Mr. Macquer and the au∣thor of this treatise, Mr. Morand, were commissioned to examine. They found there∣in two substances different from each other; the first was real wood, which had been preserved in the earth in its natural state, some parts of a brownish colour, others entirely black: the second underwent no alteration in the assemblage of the fibres that compose the ligneous body, in the knots they produce, in their weight and in their colour. The bark that had been consumed with rottenness was replaced by a sandy matter that adhered strongly to the wood. These pieces, whose ligneous body was entire, burnt well and were converted by fire into a good and real vegetable coal.</P>
<P>"In several samples portions were found, whose ligneous fibres were interrupted in their continuity, and reduced into a coaly matter, which crumbled by the pressure of the fingers, and blacked them as charcoal of the willow tree.</P>
<P>"There was another piece which might be called very curious by reason of the changes it underwent. The ligneous fibres were therein very perceptible as to their disposition, but the whole of them had contracted a complete mineralization. All the extremities of the fibres were black, and retained the lustre of finely-polished jet: and the whole piece was heavy, as pieces of petrified wood are known to be. The second substance was purely earthy. In several parts of Germany mines of fossil wood have been discovered, known by the name of Holtz-kohlen. These coals are of different kind, and as much distinguished by their colour as their properties. Some authors think that those heaps of fossil wood may lead to the finding of real coal, and that, if the wood-coal be not such, it is because it does not lie deep enough in the earth, for the woods being resolved to the necessary degree, that constitutes the stone coal: but this pretension does not seem to have any good grounds, if it be considered that good and true coal is often met with at a very little depth in the earth, and sometimes pretty near the surface. It seems more natural to seek the cause that has hindered this coal of fossil wood from becoming true coal, in the different earthy, saline, or bituminous substances wherein it is found. Their nature perhaps is not fit for operating this mineralization, or even <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> an impediment to it."

<P>"That coals were known by the Romans here appears farther, by quantities of this fossil having been found under certain barrows, appointed as it should seem for ancient land-marks. Cambden, speaking of a place in Northamptonshire, where there was anciently a Roman station, tells us, that there was a little piked hill cast up, "which some dig of late days (this was written about 1607), in hopes of finding old hidden treasures; but instead of gold, they met with coals."—"From the digging up of the coals," continues he, "what if I should guess that this hill was thrown up for a mark, or boundary? Since Siculus Flaccus tells us, that either ashes, coals, potsherds, broken glasses, bones half burnt, lime or plaister, were wont to be put under such bounds or limits: and St. Augustine writes thus of coals: Is it not a wonderful thing, that though coals are so brittle, that with the least blow they break, with the least pressure they are crushed in pieces, yet no time can destroy them; insomuch that they who pitch land-marks are wont to throw them un∣derneath, to convince any litigious person, who shall affirm, though ever so long after, that no land-mark was there."—Lib. de Civitate Dei, 21. c. 4.</P>
<P>"And so much the rather I am inclined to this opinion, because they who have written of limits or bounds, inform us, that certain hillocks, which they termed botontines (whence, says he, perhaps, come our buttings), were placed in limits; so that I suppose that most of these mounts, and round hillocks, which are so commonly seen, were raised for this purpose; and that ashes, coals, potsherds, &amp;c. might be found under them by digging deep into the ground."</P>
<P>Mr. Strutt, in his 1st vol. of Manners, &amp;c. p. 60, tells us, that, in the year 1773, he saw one of these opened near Maldon, in Essex, wherein he found potsherds, cinders and char∣coal very perfect, together with bits of bones (not human) so very rotten, as to be crushed to pieces with the least pressure.</P></NOTE>, "appear actually

He sup∣poses this castle was built about A. D. 913, by the renowned Ethelfleda, relict and successor of Aethelred, viceroy of Mercia, and that A. D. 1013 it was set on fire, and de∣molished by the Danes, under Suane, at which time he conjectures this castle had stores of coal in it, "which were reduced into huge masses of cinder, by the intenseness of so great a fire."</P>
<P>He adds, "By their being in such large masses, one would imagine they were the cin∣ders of an iron work; but who would be at the trouble of fetching ore so far as from the iron mines in Staffordshire (I mention these as being the nearest), to be wrought with coal in the upper part of Northamptonshire? for they must have fetched their coals al∣most as far."</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>The worth staith is plainly derived from the Anglo-Saxon staƿe, ripa, littus, statio navium. At Hithe in Kent, the landing place is called to this day The Stade.—"Where the pits," says the Encyclopaedia Edinburg. voce Coaleries, "are situated at some con∣siderable distance from the harbour, it becomes necessary to have a store-house near the shipping place, where the coals may be lodged until the lighters or ships are ready to take them in. The waggon-way should be made into the store-house, at such a height from the ground, as to permit the coals to run from the waggons down a spout into the vessels; or else to fall down into the store-house, as occasion may require. This kind of store-house is well adapted to dispatch, and saving expence; for a waggon-load of coals may be delivered either into the store-house or vessels instantly, with very little trouble; and if the coals were exposed to the effects of the sun and rain, they would be greatly injured in their quality, but being lodged under cover of the store-house, they are preserved."</P>
<P>When the waggons are emptied into a keel or vessel by a spout, it is called a trunk staith.—At Whitehaven, they are called steers. When a waggon lets fall its contents down one of these spouts, the noise at a distance very much resembles a clap of thunder. These waggons, after being emptied, are brought round into the road or waggon-way by a turn-frame, and each is drawn back by a single horse.</P></NOTE> upon Tyne, from Martinmas, 1330, to the same term in the year following.</P>

See Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary, Ceol, navis. On the first arrival of the Saxons in this island, they came over in three long ships, styled by themselves, as Verstegan informs us, keeles. In the Chartulary of Tinmouth monastery, the servants of the prior who wrought in the barges, are called, A. D. 1378, kelers, an appellation plainly synonimous with our present keelmen.</P>
<P>In the oldest books of the Hostmen's company, keelmen are mentioned, A. D. 1600. Their vessels are called keels or lightners. The chief person on board the keel is called the skipper. Vox composita ex scip, navis, et wer, vir; euphonice skipper, Gramm. Angl. Sax. c. 3, reg. 20. The cabin of the keel is called the huddock;—this is probably a diminutive from hutte, cabin, as paddock from padde, a toad, hillock from hill, &amp;c. See Sewel's Dutch Dictionary in verbo.</P>
<P>They call the great oar, used as a kind of rudder at the stern of this vessel, the swape. Swappe, to strike or fling down with violence, occurs in Chaucer.</P>
<P>The poles with which the keelmen on certain occasions navigate their vessels, are called puys.—Poy, appoyo, Spanish. Appuy, of appuyer, French, to support, is a pole used by rope dancers to poise themselves with.</P>
<P>With these puys our keelmen push on their keels in shallow water in the following manner, when it is inconvenient to use sails or oars.</P>
<P>One on each side of the vessel going toward the prow puts down his pole to the bottom, in a position inclined towards the head of the keel; at the same time thrusting against it forcibly with his shoulder, and walking down on the ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was towards th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stem, as the keel moves under him; by this means the keel gains a tolerably quick and even course on the water: having walked the whole length of the vessel, they pluck up the puys, re∣turn hastily to the prow, put them down again, and thrust <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before.</P>
<P>Keel-bullies is a term used for this species of waterme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> bullies is also a common appellation among the people concerned in the in the coal work for brothers:—it is probably derived from the obsolete adjective boo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, beloved.—See Ash's Dictionary.</P>
<P>A pauper giving an account of himself and family before the officers of a parish in New∣castle, in order to obtain a settlement, told them (inter alia) that "his father had brought up six of them bullies,"— <HI>i. e.</HI> had brought up six sons.—Such a clause in a deposition in the office at Bow-street would have justly alarmed a London audience with the account of such a brood to be let loose upon the town.</P>
<P>The wives and daughters of this hardy race, who sweep the keels, and have the sweep∣ings for their pains, are called Keeldeeters. To deet, signifies to wipe or make clean. —See Glossary to the poem called Yorkshire Ale.</P>
<P>Dr. Stukeley thus describes the method of navigating keels, in his Itinerary, about the year 1725. "The manner of rowing their great barges (at Newcastle) is also very particular, and not unworthy of remark. Four men manage the whole; three to a great and long oar, that push it forward, and one to another such a-stern, that assists the other's motion, but at the same time steers the keel, and corrects the bias the other gives it."</P>
<P>"These boats," says Pennant," are strong, clumsy and oval, and carry twenty tons a∣piece, they are navigated with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sail, but generally by two very large oars, one on the side plied by a man and boy; the other at the stern, by a single man, serving both as oar and ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er."—Tour, vol. iii. p. 311.</P></NOTE> which carry the

<P>From the accounts of the merchants-adventurers of Newcastle, A. D. 1516, it should seem that the hostmen were a branch of that society.

<P>There occurs ibid. date July 28, 10 Hen. VIII. an act "that no hosteman nor non other man being free of this fellowship shall buy any goods of their hosts."</P>
<P>About the year 1520, among the impositions mentioned in these merchants books, "beyond the sea," occur "for every two chalder of coals ½.—for every chalder of grind∣stones ½." Yet in the same books in their lists of impositions for 1603 and 1618, no men∣tion occurs of coals or grindstones, after the hostmen had been incorporated by royal charter. It is lastly observable, that out of the 48 names that are found in that charter, 38 occur also about the same time in the merchants books.—See in the statute of Her∣ring, 31 Ed. III. cap. 1, hostelers in the port of Yarmouth, who seem greatly to have resembled the hostmen in the coal-trade at Newcastle, and were, like the latter, a kind of mediators between the buyers and sellers. Cambden, in his Britannia, vol. ii. fol. 1319, gives the following etymon:</P>

<PB N="270" REF="280"/>
in the town of Newcastle upon Tyne from time immemorial, before their incorporation by royal charter, which is said to have been granted on the following occasion: About the year 1599 Queen Elizabeth requiring of the mayor and burgesses of that town the great arrears of a duty payable to the crown, of two-pence per chaldron on coals sold to unfreemen in the port of Tyne, the date of the origin of which can only be conjectured, but of which there is express mention in a printed statute A. D. 1420, it appeared that the payment of this impost had been so long neglected, that they found themselves unable to comply with
<PB N="271" REF="281"/>
her request; on which they besought her majesty to remit them the sum, and to incorporate the old guild of hostmen; who, on their in∣corporation, should, by a grant to the Queen, her heirs and successors, oblige themselves and their successors for ever to pay one shilling for every chalder of coals exported from thence to the free people of England. So writes Gardiner<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">P. 13. "The Queen," he adds, "conceived that twelve-pence upon every chalder would be better for the future, and well paid, and would rise to greater revenue, than the two-pence so long in arrear could endamage."</NOTE>; but they themselves in their own grant<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See Appendix.</NOTE> affirm that they were influenced by more generous motives, and that what they did, arose from their gratitude to her majesty for incorporating them by charter, as also to assist her, then labouring under excessive charges, in support of the realm against its foreign ene∣mies.</P>
<P>The agreement between the Queen and this fraternity, concerning the impost of a shilling per chaldron, had been made, or at least agreed upon before January 1600, for in the royal patent, dated at Westmin∣ster, January 3d, 1600, for the appointing of commissioners to mea∣sure keels at Newcastle, she includes in that number, "the collector of the shilling per chaldron granted her by the hostmen<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Queen Elizabeth, by her patent, dated at Westminster, January 3d, in the 42d year of her reign, appointed the mayor of Newcastle for the time being, the collectors of her custom and subsidy in that part, the comptroller, the farmer of the imposition of 5 shil∣lings per chaldron on coals exported beyond the seas, the collector of the shilling per chaldron granted to her by the hoastmen, 8 merchants, 4 masters and mariners, and 5 yeomen, in all 23 persons, to be commissioners for measuring keels according to the act of parliament made on the second day of May, the 9th of Hen.

<P N="1">1. Masters and Mariners: called also the Trinity-House.</P>
<P>IN tracing the origin of a society, to whose good services not only the port of Tyne, but also our national commerce<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>The mariners of Newcastle upon Tyne are distinguished in our annals for their bravery by sea, and their gallant behaviour in the national service. A. D. 1335, they appear to have been called out on a naval expedition to Scotland, and burnt the town of Dundee.</P>
<P>King Edward III. by writs, dated February 6th, 1341, and February 12th, 1344, com∣manded the mayor and bailiffs of Newcastle upon Tyne, to send up to his council two of their most skilful mariners to consult with on affairs of the greatest importance to the na∣vigation of his kingdom.</P>
<P>A. D. 1380, in company with the mariners of Hull, they took a Scotch pirate with a cargo to the value of seven thousand marks.—Wallis's Northumberland, vol. ii. p. 240; and Hollingshead—also Rymer's Foedera, tom. v. p. 230 and 405.</P>
<P>There was preserved among the writings of the corporation, A. D. 1565, one entitled, "A commission made by one King Henry unto the mayor, for taking of mariners to serve on the sea." See afterwards under 1636, concerning pressing.</P></NOTE> in general owes very considerable obligations, we first discover them as an ancient re∣ligious, or secular guild, with the title of the "Guild, or Fraternity of the Blessed Trinity," consisting of both sexes, and founded, it is pro∣bable, by the licence of some of our former kings<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Madox, in his Firma Burgi, p. 25, tells us that neither religious nor secular guilds could be set up legally without the King's licence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="332"/>January 4th, 1492, this society occurs as a corporate body, purchas∣ing by their feoffees the site of their present house, for which the ac∣knowledgment of a red rose, if demanded, was to be paid yearly at Midsummer for ever<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>From "a breviat of the evidences belonginge to the Trinitie-House" among their records.</P>
<P>I know not whether ever the representatives of Hebborn claimed this acknowledgment no mention occurs in their books concerning the payment thereof.—Bourne says (on what authority I find not, but certainly by mistake) that it was "a red rose at Christmas, which Bertram Anderson turned into wine." The acknowledgment of a pottle of wine an∣nually, was for some additional property, and continued to be paid for above a century after the grant. See under A. D. 1525.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>By a writing still preserved in their archives, and dated January 4th, 1505, they ordered that, on the site of the present Trinity-House, an∣ciently called, from the name probably of a former owner, "Dalton-Place," a hall, chapel, and lodgings, for their poor brethren should be erected at their common expence<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">From records remaining at present in the possession of this house.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>An original deed, dated September 9th, 1525, and preserved in the archives of the society<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>In this writing mention is first made of their altar or chantry, called Triniry Altar, in All-Saints church, which probably they had founded long before, on their having first become a secular guild, or fraternity: in this writing also a government by aldermen and wardens occurs in like manner as after King Henry VIIIth's charter. Their chaplain also is mentioned in it.</P>

<P>January 19th, 1655, this society was desired by the council of trade, under the protector Cromwell, to transmit them a copy of their charter, with an account of their government, and what was want∣ing in their house.

<P>It appears that when Clifford's Fort at the entrance of the Tyne was built in 1672, at the expence of government, the low light-house of this society, as well as the ground annexed to it, was railed in with rails and stakes: Government finding a part of this ground most convenient for their purpose, inclosed about five hundred and nine yards of it within the walls of the new fort, leaving, however, a little door for the keeper of the light-house to go out at, and mark the time of the tide, but which afterwards also was built up<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Books of the society. Before the erection of Clifford's Fort, which Wallis, in his History of Northumberland, has confounded with one which stood on the south side of the Tyne, to the seaward, at a little distance from this light-house there was anciently a sort of baskets filled with sand and mortar, with a gun placed between each basket.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS ACCOUNT OF OFFICERS AND SERVANTS OF THE CORPORATION OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Muster-Masters.</HEAD>
<P>THE earliest mention of a muster-master appointed in the town occurs in the books of the common-council, September 26th, 1638, when William Bowes, of Gateshead, Gentleman, was appointed "muster-master for the training up of youth and the trained bands within this town."—It appears ibid. that before that time, on the death of Captain Thomas Jackson, the place of muster-master had been ob∣tained by Mr. Ralph Errington from his majesty's lord lieutenants of the north, who had resigned in favour of W. Bowes. Salary 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum.</P>
<P>September 19th, 1642, Thomas Williamson.—Ibid.</P>
<P>January 18th, 1664, Henry Milborne, who had been appointed on the death of Thomas Williamson by his majesty's lord lieutenants of the north, was re-appointed at his own request by the Corporation of New-castle, with the above salary, "resigning up his commission from the said lord lieutenants, and accepting the place from the mayor and burgesses."</P>
<P>July 12th, 1708, Richard Stanley, ibid. with a salary of ten pounds per annum.—December 12th, 1711, Mr. Richard Stanley ordered in future to have the yearly salary of ten pounds, five pounds as a gratuity, and five pounds for looking to the arms; with a gratuity of ten pounds
<PB N="363" REF="373"/>
three shillings" for attending several times on my Lord Scarborough, on account of the militia."</P>
<P>December 18th, 1729, on the petition of Mr. Thomas Potts, setting forth, that he had been appointed by commission from the Earl of Scarborough, lord lieutenant, to be muster-master of the town and county of Newcastle—ordered, that ten pounds per annum, and no more, be given him.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Town's Physician.</HEAD>
<P>Samuel Rand, M. D. was appointed town's physician, on the death of Doctor Robert Henryson, with a salary of forty pounds per annum. —Common-council books.</P>
<P>He was displaced for negligence April 21st, 1643, and afterwards, July 5th, 1652, re-admitted.</P>
<P>August 27th, 1660, Dr. George Tunstall was appointed.—The town had been without one for about six years, and from the time of Dr. Rand's death.</P>
<P>November 4th, 1664, Richard Luck, M. D. on the removal of Dr. Tunstall.</P>
<P>August 17th, 1682, Henry Atherton, M. D. was appointed.</P>
<P>Dr. Atherton was succeeded by Dr. Robert Grey, who must have died before March 31st, 1701, when a motion was made in the com∣mon-council to appoint either Dr. Thomas Davison, or Dr. Richard Huntley, to succeed him; but without effect, for the corporation never appointed another.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Town's Solicitor.</HEAD>
<P>The earliest account I find of a town's solicitor, is in an order of common-council, dated March 28th, 1638, when the famous Mr. John Rushworth, "he having been found to be a man verie able, and well experienced in the matters of this towne," was appointed to that office, with a salary of thirty pounds per annum.—Common-coun∣cil books.</P>
<P>March 17th, 1656, Mr. Samuel Hartlib was appointed town's agent at London, on the death of Mr. Maddison.—Ibid.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="374"/>September 1st, 1668, Mr. Michael Tempest, and Mr. Samuel Hartlib, were appointed joint solicitors.—Ibid.</P>
<P>It appears (ibid.) September 25, 1684, on the removal of Mr. John Rushworth, "agent or solicitor for this towne of Newcastle," that Mr. Edward Ridley was appointed, by an act of common-council, to suc∣ceed him in that office, with a salary of thirty pounds per annum.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Town's Surveyor.</HEAD>
<P>The earliest account of the officer termed town's surveyor, that oc∣curs in the common-council books of Newcastle, is in an order, dated March 27th, 1666, when Henry Moore was appointed to that office.</P>
<P>The MS. Life of Alderman Barnes informs us, that one John Pig was some time land-surveyor for the town, well known both to the King (Charles II.) and the Duke of York; "and for his giddy singularities noted not only through the country, but almost through the kingdom. He usually wore a high-crowned hat, a strait coat, and would never ride, but walkt the pace of any horse hundreds of miles on foot with a quarter staff, fenced with an iron fork at one end.</P>
<P>"The King and Duke of York, to whom he was often trotting, made themselves sport with him, as looking upon him to be a brain∣sick enthusiast, and he was no less.</P>
<P>"He was of so peculiar and odd a humour, that he would not only go to prison, when he needed not, but conceitedly chose the vilest part of the prison for his apartment, where he continued a long while, when he might have had his liberty whenever he pleased. This Pig died in a stye, in circumstances not unlike those who lay hands on themselves or die crazy or distracted. Pig's Folly, near Gosforth, was erected by this man." P. 88.</P>
<P>September 24th, 1691, James Quincey appointed.—Common-coun∣cil books.</P>
<P>September 26th, 1716, William Sowerby, on the death of the abovc.—Ibid.</P>
<P>May 3d, 1736, Michael Dawson occurs.—Ibid.</P>
<P>September 26th, 1757, William Errington, on the death of M. Dawson.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="375"/>April 11th, 1774, John Fenwick, on the removal of John Craister from that office<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>Among the inferior officers appointed by the Corporation of Newcastle, occurs one with the singular title of "whipper and hougher," who is also the executioner of felons.</P>
<P>He is called "hougher," from the power he is said to have had formerly of cutting the houghs, or sinews of the houghs, of swine, that were found infesting the streets of the town.—See the Glossary to Gawen Douglas's Virgil, where "to hoch," Scotch, from the Anglo-Saxon "hoh," is rendered "suffragines succidere," to hamstring.</P>
<P>To hox is to hamstring.—So in Knolles' History of the Turks, "alighted, and with his sword hoxed his horse."—King James VI. in his eleventh parliament, had an act to punish hochares and slayers of horses, oxen, &amp;c".—Johnson's and Steevens's Shakespeare, vol. iv. p. 307, notes.</P>
<P>In the common-council books, September 24th, 1691, "James Marke" occurs.</P>
<P>Ibid. September 25th, 1705, Alexander Robinson appointed in the room of Thomas Cooper, to be "common executioner in hanging of felons, putting persons in the pillory, clearing the streets of swine, and to doe and perform all other matters belonging to the place and duty of the hougher."</P></NOTE>.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>FREE CUSTOMS OF THE CORPORATION OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><P>The subsequent were the customs, &amp;c. of this borough in the time of King Henry I. —See History of Newcastle as a corporate town.</P>
<P>"These are the laws and customs which King Henry granted to his burgesses of New∣castle. It is lawful to distrain the goods of rusties, and those that live in the country, within their markets and without, within their houses also and without; and that without licence of the bailiff, unless when they come to the court, or be in the army, or guarding the castle; but it is not lawful for one burgess to distrain the goods of another, without leave of the bailiff Of mayor. If a burgess inherit any thing from a villain, or other per∣son, the pleas that are moved in the borough may be pleaded there, except those that be∣long to the crown. If a burgess be indited, let him not be impleaded without the borough, unless for defect of court, nor ought he to answer concerning an appeal without day or term, unless he has happened to give a foolish answer, or in matters relating to the crown, or belore the justices itinerant.</P>
<P>"If a ship arrive at Tinmouth, and will not go away, by a council of the burgesses, any person may purchase merchandise of that ship.—If a plea be moved between the burgesses and an itinerant merchant, the matter may be determined before three floods of the tide. Merchandises brought to the town by sea, ought to be canied ashore, except salt and herring, which may be sold on board. Whoever shall hold land in the borough a year and a day justly, and without claim, if the claimant be within the kingdom, he is not bound to answer such claimant. If a burgess have a son at his table in his house, let the son have equal liberty with his father.—If a villain come to the borough to stay and hold land in the borough a year and a day, without any prolocution of his lord or himself to any term, let him remain in the borough as a burgess. No foreigner ought to buy cloth to dye, unless he be of the custom of the borough. Any burgess may sell his land, and go where he pleases, unless his land be indited or claimed. If a burgess be impleaded in a plea, whence battle may arise, by any villain, or inhabitant of the country, let him defend himself by the law, which he has in his custom, unless he be impeached of any crime, for which he ought justly to light, nor ought a burgess to fight with a villain, if there be not a prior claim to his burgage. It is not lawful for a foreign merchant to buy wool, skins, or any other things, either in the market or the country. The forfeiture of a burgess towards the bailiff ought to go to the common fund. In the borough there ought neither to be given merchet, heriot, bloodwit, or stengedwit. Every burgess may have a furnace and mill. If any one sell any of his bread or ale, it shall be forfeited to the bailiff, who may act thus: if he incurs the forfeit twice, he must pay it; if three, he must be punished by common-council of the burgesses. No foreigner to be permitted to cut fish to sell. A burgess may carry his corn out of the country whithersoever he pleases without licence."</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the sons of a free burgess claim the franchise of their father by patrimony: there is a kind of double franchise; the fellowship with
<PB N="366" REF="376"/>
the general body, called the freedom of the town, and that of some particular company, usually styled the freedom of a trade; and the per∣son who enjoys both is said to be free of town and trade.</P>
<P>If a father, possessed of a right of franchise, die before admission, all his sons forfeit their claim. No natural son can inherit the franchise.</P>
<P>with a right to vote for two representatives in parliament, every bur∣gess, and widow of a burgess, may claim two stints on the common and common-pasture of the town. Every freeman is also exempt from the payment of tolls, quay dues, river dues, &amp;c. Franchise is also obtained by servitude. Anciently this servitude was in some companies for ten years; it cannot at present be for less than seven. A master, being free of the town only, cannot make his apprentice<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><P>Kennet, in the Glossary to his Parochial Antiquities, cites a deed, dated 12 Ed. III. in which the word apprentice occurs in its present sense.</P>
<P>A. D. 1389, "bond of apprentise" occurs in the Statutes.</P>
<P>An indenture of apprenticeship in Latin, dated April 6th, 14<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9, from the Augmenta∣tion-Office, is preserved in Madox's Formulare Angulicanum.</P>
<P>There is a statute, 7 Hen. IV. that "none shall put son on daughter to serve as ap∣prentice to any craft in any city or borough, except they have land or rent to the value of twenty shillings per annum. Apprentices are mentioned in the ordinaries of the sadlers and glovers companies of Newcastle, dated 1436. These are the earliest accounts I have met with of this kind of servitude.</P></NOTE> free; for, in order to this, the franchise of some company is indispensable.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="377"/>Some privileges are obtained by marriage: if a person who has a right to the franchise of Newcastle, marry a freeman's daughter before his admission, he pays on such admission 6<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> less than those who claim the same freedom either by patrimony or servitude.</P>
<P>The franchise devolves on a freeman's widow; she can enfranchise the apprentices of her husband, if he had been free of any company, and she continues to carry on his bsfiness; she inherits also her hus∣band's exemption from tolls, quay dues, &amp;c. all which are lost if she afterwards marry a non-freeman.</P>
<P>The franchise of Newcastle, it is said, cannot be sold, but may be presented as a gift, when it is usually styled an honorary or personal freedom.</P>
<P>It has been generally supposed, that an honorary freeman can neither transmit his franchise to his sons, nor confer it upon his apprentices.</P>
<P>The determination of this question will, probably, at some time or other, occasion much trouble to the corporation of Newcastle.</P>
<P>The form of the oath, on the admission of a freeman of Newcastle, concludes with an expression that seems to imply that every burgess is bound to a personal defence of the town.</P>
<P>It is usual, on admission, to present the mayor or alderman who ad∣mits, with a silver penny.</P>
<P>By the charter of the 42d of Elizabeth, March 22d, 1600, it was ordered that burgesses should be admitted by the mayor and burgesses, or common-council, whereof the mayor and six aldermen were to be seven.</P>
<P>By the charter of King James I. 1604, all customs, rights and liberties of the town of Newcastle, held by former charter or prescrip∣tion, were confirmed to it.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="378"/>The following passage occurs in the ordinary of the bakers and brewers, dated September 28th, 1579. Every brother was enjoined to live in the town of Newcastle, and "continue therein as a burgesse of the same towne, to watch and ward, and beare scott and lott as other burgesses of the same towne ought to doe."</P>
<P>No freeholder in Newcastle has a right to vote for a member of parliament for that town, as such, unless he be also a free burgess thereof; neither have they votes for representatives for the county of Northumberland; so that by far the greater number of the inhabitants cannot be said to be represented in parliament.</P>
<P>The odium anciently entertained against the Scottish nation, and which hardly yet has subsided among the vulgar, must be referred to as one of the leading reasons, why so few of the present inhabitants of Newcastle enjoy the franchise of that town. There is a clause in the ordinary of almost every company, that no Scotsman born should be taken apprentice; and it is highly improbable that any of that once hostile people would, at least before the time of King James I. be ad∣mitted to a freedom of the town, either after residing any time in it, or on the payment of a fine: which seem to have been the ancient terms of admission.</P>
<P>There was an Essay on Charters published a few years ago at New∣castle upon Tyne, by Mr. Collier, in which the account of the origin of burgesses, except of the claim by servitude, is entirely chimerical, and evinces in almost every line that the writer was totally unacquaint∣ed with his subject.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Form of a Freeman's Oath—from an old copy.</HEAD>
<P>"Newcastle upon Tyne.—You swear that you shall from henceforth hold with our sovereign Lady the Queen's Majesty that now is, and with her heirs and successors, kings and queens of England, against all persons to live and to dye and maintain the peace and all the fran∣chises of this town of Newcastle upon Tyne, and be obedient to the mayor, aldermen, sheriff, and all other the officers of the same. And their counsel keep. And no man's goods avow for yours, unless he be
<PB N="369" REF="379"/>
as free as yourself and of the same franchise: and you shall observe and keep to the best of your power all the lawful ordinances made by common consent on high court days: and all other things shall you do that belong to a freeman of the said town. So help you God.</P>

<HEAD>PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE CORPUS CIIRISTI PLAYS, OR MIRACLE PLAYS, ANCIENTLY PERFORMED BY THE TRADING COMPANIES OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER relates to this subject is extremely interesting, as these miracle plays were the first and earliest of our dramatic exhibitions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Warton's History of Poetry, vol. i. p. 242.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These appear to have been acted in the open air, in what was called in some places the Play-Field, or in some spot calculated to shew the performance to the greatest crowd of spectators<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Arnot's History of Edinburgh, p. 76.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>They are reported to have been many of them very indelicate and obscene<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>They were not without their use<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>Warton ut supra, vol. ii. p. 179. "Not only," he tells us, "in teaching the great truths of scripture to men who could not read the bible, but in abolishing the barbarous attachment to military games and the bloody contentions of the tournament, which had so long, pre∣vailed as the sole spicies of popular amusement.—Rude, and even ridiculous, as they were, they softened the manners of the pcople, by diverting the publick attention to spectacles in which the mind was concerned." See also Appendix to Drake's Eboracum, p. 29, 30, 31.</P>
<P>I know not when this kind of entertainment first began. The Chester plays appear to have been written A. D. 1328.</P>
<P>Mr. Warton, who smiles at the idea of their having anciently committed to the black∣smiths the handling of the "Purification," an old play so called, would have had still greater reason, could he have assigned with truth to the company of taylors "the Descent into Hell."</P></NOTE> however, not only in impressing on the rude minds of an unlettered pcople the chief histories of their
<PB N="370" REF="380"/>
religion, but also in softening their manners, at that time very gross and impure; "creating insensibly," as Mr. Warton observes, "a re∣gard for other arts than those of bodily strength and savage valour."</P>
<P>In the ordinary of the coopers, dated January 20th, 1426, occurs the earliest notice I have found of any of the Corpus Christi exhibitions in Newcastle upon Tyne.</P>
<P>They are mentioned also in those of the smiths and glovers, A. D. 1436; barbers<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The barbers to play the "Baptyfyng of Crist."—See also skinners' ordinary, January 20, 1437—also that of the armourers, &amp;c. 38 of Henry VIII.</NOTE>, 1442; staters<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The following entry occurs in the old book of the slaters:

<PB N="372" REF="382"/>
Edward IV. for settling the order of their procession on Corpus Christi day<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Merchants old books.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By the ordinary of the millers, dated 1578, we may infer that the Corpus Christi plays were at that time on the decline, and never acted but by a special command of the magistrates of Newcastle. "Whenso∣ever," says that authority, "the generall plaies of the towne shall be commanded by the mayor, &amp;c." they are to play "the an∣tient playe of their fellowship, called "the Deliverance of the Chil∣dren of Isrell out of the Thraldome, Bondage, and Servitude of King Pharo<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>The title of the weavers' play was the "Beringe of the Crosse."</P>
<P>Weaver, in his Funeral Monuments, p. 405, informs us that about the beginning of the reign of King James, these Corpus Christi plays were finally suppressed in all towns of the kingdom.</P></NOTE>."</P>
<P>Thus also in that of the house-carpenters, dated July 3d, 1579, it is ordered, that "whensoever the generall plaies of the towne shall be plaied," they shall play "the Burial of Christ," pertaining an∣ciently to the said fellowship.</P>
<P>To this effect also it was ordered by that of the masons A. D. 1581, "that at all times hereafter for ever whensoever the generall plaies of the towne of Newcastle, antiently called the Corpus Christi plays, shall be plaied, they shall cause to be set forth and plaied among other plaies of the said towne the plaie antientlye named "the Buriall of our Lady Saint Mary the Virgin."</P>
<P>And lastly, by the joiners' ordinary, dated 1589, it was provided that "whensoever it shall be thought necessary by the mayor, &amp;c. to comand to be sett forth and plaied or exercised any general playe or martial exercise, they shall attend on the same and do what is assigned them."</P>
<P>Bourne has preserved the following copy of the ancient play belong∣ing to the company of shipwrights, in Newcastle upon Tyne. I sought in vain in all the archives of the several societies of that town for another. After the reformation, they were probably destroyed in∣dustriously as reliques of popish superstition.</P>

<HEAD>ANNALS AND HISTORICAL EVENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE memory of events, transmitted only by tradition, soon must be either defaced or destroyed. By letters alone the accounts of past actions can be handed down to us with accuracy and fidelity. The periods of time therefore preceding the discovery of the art of writing, are necessarily involved in darkness, nor can the earliest histories of nations just emerging from barbarism and ignorance, afford us a light more copious than those faint glimmerings that rather foretel than ascer∣tain the break of day: vain then would be the attempts of the topogra∣pher to rescue the particular and minute transactions of remote antiquity from the common confusion and obscurity; and we may surely rest satisfied with being unable to discover the first residents on the banks of the Tyne, on reflecting that the more general inquirer into the origin of the first inhabitants of our whole island,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">The earliest visitants of Britain are said to have been Grecian and Phoenician mer∣chants, about a thousand years before Christ; but our first account of its being inhabited, that can be depended upon, occurs in Caesar's description of his own attempt upon it, near fifty years before the Christian aera: there is every reason to suppose that it was first peopled from Gaul.—See a memoir on this subject by Mr. Milot, shewing that the Greeks never traded here before Julius Caesar's time.—Memoirs de l' Ac. des Inscript. vol. xxix. p. 265, 295, 12<SUP>mo</SUP>. cited in Gough's Topog. vol. i. p. 1. See also Richard of Cirencester, p. 50.</NOTE> must encounter at least equal difficulties.</P>
<P>The fitness of the river Tyne for the purposes of navigation would not long escape the notice of a commercial people, which the earliest inhabitants of every island must have been; nor need we doubt but that the most ancient Britons were seated on its fertile banks, and im∣posed on it a name<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See, in the account of the river Tyne, conjectures concerning the etymology of the name of this river.</NOTE> that has faithfully been transmitted to the present time.</P>
<P>Whether any village, town, or fortress, was erected by the Britons
<PB N="381" REF="391"/>
on the site of the present Newcastle upon Tyne, forms one of those questions relating to the darker ages and our more remote antiquities, which cannot be answered by any authority of history or tradition.</P>
<P>Julius Agricola<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot"><P>See Horseley's Britannia Romana, p, 39, 40. Also the Chronological Table at the end of that work, sub anno 79. The design of these stations was evidently to cut off the communication betwixt the conquered and unconquered part of the Britons.</P>
<P>The "Orrea" of Ptolemy has been by some writers very erroneously fixed at Newz∣castle.—See Bale, cent. 2, p. 99, &amp;c. &amp;c. "Orrea" says Horseley, ut supra, p. 373, "is placed by Ptolemy about half way between Tay and Forth, and consequently must be in Fife, in Scotland. We are told in Camden, that near the water of Ore (Fife) they find lead, as also many fine crystals of several colours at the Bin and at Orrock. I think we may settle Orrea here, and Victoria at Abernethy."</P></NOTE>, governor in Britain under the emperor Titus Ves∣pasian, was probably the first that distinguished it from the common banks of our river, when he established a garrison here about A. D. 80, and made it one of that chain of military stations which extended from the eastern to the western sea, to defend the northern frontier of a Ro∣man province, against the incursions of still more northern and un∣conquered barbarians.</P>
<P>In the year 120, the emperor Hadrian built his vallum, wall, or rampart, nearly from the Irish sea to the German ocean, taking in the former chain of forts made by Agricola, ending it at this part of the river Tyne, over which also he threw a bridge at this place; a circumstance which gave a new appellation, that of Pons Aelius or Aelii<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See under the account of Tyne-Bridge. By this time, or more probably at a still earlier period, a Roman way conducted hither from the more southern parts of the pro∣vince: I know not whether the appearance of that road in succeeding times, from the top of the hill now called Bottle-Bank, might not have given its present appellation to Gateshead, of which the simple etymology is "the head of the gate," <HI>i. e.</HI> way. See under the account of Gateshead.</NOTE>, derived from his own family name, to the Roman station, the site of which is at present included within the walls of Newcastle.</P>
<P>The emperor Severus, who was here in person in the year 207, began to erect his famous wall of stone that year, which was extended across the island nearly from sea to sea, finishing it in the year follow∣ing. This stupendous monument of the Roman people passed through
<PB N="382" REF="392"/>
the site of the present Newcastle eastward, ending at the station of Segedunum, near the village of Walls-End<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Horseley's Britannia Romana.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About the year 445, Newcastle occurs under the appellation of Pons Aelii, a Roman station, where at that time a cohort of the Cornovii were in garrison<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See the Notitia Imperii, &amp;c. supposed to be dated about A. D. 445, when the bulk of the Roman forces were stationed on the Kentish coast against the Saxon invaders, and on the northern barrier, per lineam valli, a work which appears to have been transcribed from the Latercula, or Registers of State. Gough's British Topography, vol i. p. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After a silence of near two hundred years, mention occurs<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P>In the year 650.</P>
<P>See "account of the churches in Newcastle."—Bede's Eccl. Hist. and Flores Histo∣riarum, by Matthew of Westminster, p. 226, where we read "in vico Regis qui vocatur Ad Murum."</P>
<P>That "Ad Murum" was the then name of Newcastle, seems to be clearly proved by the Itinerary of Richard of Cirencester, discovered since the publication of the Britannia Romana, and edited by a Mr. Bertram, who was so fortunate as to find the MS. in Sweden. It appears not only from the very curious ancient map affixed to this work, but also from the fourth and fifth iters described therein, that the Roman way divided at Vino∣vium, the present Binchester, in the county of Durham, from whence one of the branches conducted to Corbridge, &amp;c. by way of Lanchester and Ebchester, while the other led through Epiacum, the present Chester-le-Street, to the town called "Ad Murum," upon the Roman wall, the present Newcastle upon Tyne, where it seems to have terminated, as no vestiges thereof have ever been traced to the north of that place.</P>
<P>This Richard of Cirencester lived about the end of the fourteenth century, and appears to have been the Leland of his age.—He searched all our monastic libraries, and drew up the geography of Britain from memoirs left by a Roman general, whom Dr. Stukeley persuades himself to have been Agricola. Horseley, p. 387, seems to authorise this sup∣position, observing that most of our military ways were probably laid by Agricola; none certainly were made till after Claudius' conquest, A. D. 44. Richard's is more exact and particular than Antoninus' Itinerary. Of five hundred places which it mentions in Britain and Ireland, one hundred and fifty are new or more correctly fixed.—Gough's Brit. Topog. vol. i. p. 13.</P>
<P>Dr. Stukeley is of opinion that the original itinerary and map which Richard copied, was constructed in Agricola's time, though afterwards additions were made to it.—Such names as ad pontem, ad murum, ad vallum, &amp;c. intimate that the roads were generally made or marked out, but towns, cities, castles not then built.</P></NOTE> again of
<PB N="383" REF="393"/>
this place under the new appellation of Ad Murum (at wall), and the residence of a Northumbrian king<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><P>Bede tells us that Peada, the son of Pendan, King of the Midland Angles, came to Oswin, King of Northumberland, to demand his daughter Alcfleda in marriage. Oswin refused his consent to this match, till Peada should be baptized and embrace Christianity. Either through the love of this fair virgin, or of truth, the condition was accepted, and he was baptized, together with his retinue, adds this writer, by Bishop Finan, at a royal town called Ad Murum, which, in the next chapter he tells us, was close to the Roman wall and at the distance of twelve miles from the eastern sea.—Lib. iii. cap. 21.</P>
<P>Dr. Smith, in his note on the above passage, differs, as he well might, from the common opinion that Ad Murum was the present Walton, a village near the confines of Cumber∣land, and above thirty miles from the sea, and fixes it at Walbottle, an obscure village, about six miles west of Newcastle. A similarity of sound in the name has, it seems, occa∣sioned both these errors, for such have our later discoveries clearly enabled us to call them; Ad Murum being unquestionably the present Newcastle upon Tyne, where there are still both traditionary and printed accounts, that the Saxon kings of Northumberland had their palace. See Grey's Chorographia, p. 12. "After the departure of the Romans, the kings of Northumberland kept their residence and had their house now called Pandon-Hall; it was a safe bulwark, having the Picts wall on the north side, and the river of Tyne on the south." The Roman measures would probably be retained in Bede's time; and if we believe Dr. Gale, who, in his edition of Antoninus' Itinerary, tells us that fifteen English miles answer to twenty Roman, his account of the distance of Newcastle from the sea will be strictly true.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the heptarchy, which lasted from the year 587 to 826, New∣castle upon Tyne, by the name of Ad Murum, or the later appella∣tion of Monk-Chester, appears to have continued to be one of the chief seats of our Northumbrian kings<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>"The Saxons (who generally built on Roman foundations) held it in the greatest esteem, and during the heptarchy made it the chief seat of the kings of the Northumbers, who adorned it with so great a number of monasteries that from them it obtained the name of Munk-Chester."—Warburton's MS. Collections, penes h. v. Due. Northumbriae.</P>
<P>In the preface to the History of the Nunnery of Newcastle, are hazarded conjectures why Ad Murum changed its name for Monk-Chester, which cannot appear altogether improbable to those who are inclined to think, with our writers in general, that that ap∣pellation signifies "the fortified residence of monks," an etymology which, however, has been controverted by Charlton, in his History of Whitby, p. 51, where he endeavours to explain it to be a corruption of "Roman Chester."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the year 826, when Northumberland ceased to be a distinct and separate kingdom, till the reign of William the Conqueror, the
<PB N="384" REF="394"/>
town of Newcastle, under the title of Monk-Chester, as part of that division of territory, known by the title of the county of Northum∣berland, appears to have remained<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>"Newcastel, so since, whych before was called Monk-Chester and did alwaies pertaine to the forespoken earles of Northumber."—MS. in Cotton library, Julius, c. 2, recorded in the Exchequer of Durham.</P>
<P>Diligent inquity has been made after coins fabricated at Monk-Chester by the earls, or at Ad Murum during the heptarchy by the Saxon kings of Nothumberland, but with out success, York having been the principal place of their mintage.</P></NOTE> without interruption in the posses∣sion of the earls of that district, who, it is probable, continued to make it one of their principal places of residence: but no mention thereof occurs in history for more than two hundred years after that period, as the scene of any remarkable transaction.</P>
<P>In the year 1068<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Warburton's MSS. penes. h. v.

This was a kind of purgation continued even till the reign of King John and Henry the Third. There were two sorts of it; one by fire, another by water: liber per ferrum candens, rusticus per aquam.

They assessed tallages and aids, and admitted men to make conventions, fines, and oblata's, in their several iters. It is not easy to discover at what time they were first instituted.—</P>

<P>Till the year 1135, when King Henry died, it seems the good understanding continued betwixt King David and him, as it had done in the reigns of former kings; but King Stephen being placed on the throne of England, to which the Empress Maud's right was declared and confirmed by oath, King David with reason adhered to her, and made war against King Stephen. King David quickly became master of all the fortresses in Cum∣berland and Northumberland, excepting Bebbanburch, and made the nobility give oath of fealty to his niece, with hostages.</P>
<P>King Stephen being at Durham, invaded Northumberland. There was a peace be∣tween the two Kings in the year 1139, at the intreaty of Matilda, <HI>i. e.</HI> Maud, King Ste∣phen's Queen, niece to David, by his sisther Mary, and Countses and heiress of Bulloigne.</P>

<P>Lesley says that peace was made between the above princes, on these conditions; that Northumberland and Huntingdon should be ceded, as of just right, by heirship of his mother, to Henry, David's son; and that Cumberland, as of ancient right, should remain in David's possession. P. 211.</P>

The marquis ordered the firing of the coal-mines, but was prevented by General Lesley's surprising all the boats and vessels; seven of the parliament's frigates lay in the mouth of the haven, to stop their passage by sea." He adds, "15,000 of the Scots passed the river Tyne, and blocked up Newcastle on the south side." "They took also," he continues, "a great fort over against Tinmouth, which com∣mands all ships coming in or going out of Newcastle, and five pieces of ordnance, arm∣powder, and some prisoners, and lost but nine men."</P>
<P>Wallis, in his History of Northumberland, has confounded the capture of this sort of the south-side, with that of Clifford's Fort on the north side of the river Tyne.</P>
<P>"In the mean time," says Rushworth, "a smart dispute happened: the town had raised a sort at the entrance into the Shield-Field, to gain which, the Scots sent out two parties; one to attack the sort on the east side, the other on the west; in which service, divers of them were cut off by the cannon, and particularly Patrick English, the Earl of Lindsay's captain-lieutenant, slain.

General Leven came also before Newcastle; he and Calendar got possession of the bridge, and most of the inhabitants of the lower town sled to the higher for shelter. Leven summoned 3,000 countrymen to come in with spades and mattocks, &amp;c. The lord general's quarters were at Elswick.

<P>A reply of General Leven the same day signified his desire, that hostages might be sent from either side, and some appointed to treat concerning terms and conditions<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>October 16th, Sir John Marley, with the aldermen, and common-council, in reply to the general's last, informed him, "that as to send∣ing hostages, they do not hold they have power, as mayor, aldermen, and common-council; but solely to be in Mr. Maior, as he is governor of the military affairs."</P>
<P>Upon this, the general the same day addressed a letter to Sir John Marley, and desired of him the names of hostages and commis∣sioners.</P>
<P>Sir John Marley, by a letter of the day following, desired the general to name his commissioners first, "that he might suit them as to their qualities, having no noblemen in the town, but two of the Earl's countrymen."</P>

<P>October 18th, the above-named commissioners for the town sent a letter to General Leven, and desired him to rest satisfied till the Mon∣day following, when they hoped to transmit him inch propositions as should give content The Scottish general answered them that same night with great anger.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 19th, instead of the hostages that were ex∣pected, the Scottish general received a letter from the governor, &amp;c. of Newcastle, containing their resolution not to give a final answer till the Monday following. Sir John Marley wrote the same morning to Lord Sinclair, desiring that his drummer might have leave to deliver a letter to General Leven himself, as it was strongly reported in New∣castle that he was dead<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Scots interpreted this last letter of Sir John Marley as an insult, and began, almost instantly after the receipt thereof, a most violent firing from their several batteries upon the town-wall, and the several regiments were drawn up, standing to their arms while the breaches were in readiness, and the mines sprung. About three o'clock in the afternoon, tlie town garrison by their counter-mines had very nearly approached some chambers, where the gun-powder was lodged for blowing up the walls; which being signified to General Leven, he or∣dered immediately that fire should be given to those two mines endan∣gered, and afterwards to maintain the breaches carefully, whilst a general assault should be made from all quarters: a little after, the day failing and the breaches being made, though not so large and passable as was
<PB N="467" REF="478"/>
needful, the rest of the mines were fired, and the regiments advanced all at once towards the breaches, and those places of the wall which were opened by the mines. In this attempt, however, they were ex∣cellently entertained by the besieged, who left nothing unessayed to repel the fury of the assault. They played incessantly from the castle upon the breaches and the flanking towers of the walls, with scattered shot; and the Scots received a considerable loss of soldiers and officers of quality: yet still tliey pressed on, and, after two hours desperate dis∣pute upon the breaches, forced their first entry at the mine sprung on the west side of the town, near to Close-Gate. Tlien the horse in the town gave them three brave charges, which they stoutly sustained, and kept their ground till the reserve of that post came to assist them. Then they marched for the relief of the rest of the breaches: and the soldiers of the garrison seeing farther resistance in vain, forsook the walls, and the whole body almost of the army entering, they soon became mas∣ters of the town. The Scots extolled their own clemency and kindness on this occasion<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><P>Rushworth ut supra. The Milbank MS. cited by Bourne, says: "Newcastle was entered by the White-Fryer Tower and Sand-Gate, where the colliers of Elswick and Benwell were employed under one John Osbourn, a false rebellious Scot, to undermine the walls: which they did and blew them up, and so got and plundered the town. And no marvel, for they were accounted 30,000 men, and the townsmen were but in all 1500 men, wearied with continual watch and duty, though men of great courage, and sought it gallantly to the last: for the Newgate-Ward, which was under Captain Cuthbert Carr, was taken by the enemy, who entered at the aforesaid places, and encompassed them be∣fore and behind: and Pilgrim-Street-Gate was maintained by Captain George Errington, Lieutenant William Robson, and Ensign Thomas Swan, who sought and killed very many: they themselves not having one hurt, until they were encompassed by the enemy before and behind; and even then they would not parley with the Scots, who sougth against them without, but did capitulate with Lieutenant Colonel Smelair who loved and ho∣noured them, and kept his agreement well with them, that not one of them was sobbed of his clothes or money, not were any of his men suffered to give any evil word; and it was the great blessing of God that in all that time there was not one man slain nor hurt, although that company consisted of nine score men, all tradesmen: and there were divers fallies made out at that gate, for it was the longest of all the gates of the town, being barrocaded and shut up. And after they had surrendered, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my was called over at that breach, they durst not approach, but shot at their friends that called them and would not believe that the town was taken."</P>
<P>"Thus," adds Bourne, "was the town taken from the King, after an obstinate and gallant defence, and may well assume the motto bestowed upon it, 'Fortiter defendendo triumphans.' The Scots are said to have risled the town's hutch, and destroyed most of the evidences and deeds belonging to the Corporation, after they had captured Newcastle."</P></NOTE>, affirming, that never was town gained by storm,

Upon their first entry, the gover∣nor, Lodowick Lindesey, Earl Crawford, the Lord Maxwell, Doctor Wishart and others, that had been most resolute for holding out the town, betook themselves to the castle.</P>
<P>Sunday, October 20th, General Leven entered the town, where he went to church with his chief officers, to return thanks to God for their success.</P>
<P>The next day Sir John Marley, mayor, wrote a spirited letter to General Leven from the castle, to which he had retreated, and which he owned could not hold out long.</P>
<P>In this he hinted at the particular motives of his loyalty, and begged for liberty to withdraw to some neighbouring garrison of the King; but the incensed general would allow no terms, and insisted upon a general surrender.</P>

And John the divine, who preached the word that was in the beginning, said that the beast and the whore had power over tongues and languages, and they are as waters. Thus I told him he might see the whore and beast have power over the tongues and the many languages which are in mystery Babylon.—Now said I to the man, dost thou think to make ministers of Christ by these natural confused languages which sprang from Babel, are admired in Babel, and set atop of Christ by a persecutor?

<P>"A memorial the 8th of January, 1696. In Nairne's hand.—Translation.</P>
<P>Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. 4to, No. 5. "The town of Newcastle, one of the most considerable in England, is situated at the distance of a league from the sea, on the river Tyne, which separates the county of Northumberland from the bishoprick of Durham. At the mouth of this river stands a large village called Tinmouth, with a fort, which com∣mands the entry; but is in bad repair towards the land—vessels of 500 tons can enter the harbour. The town is surrounded only by an old ruinous wall, without ramparts or ditches; and is commanded by heights on all sides. It is in this neighbourhood they dig the coals, which are so well known throughout all the kingdom, as coals are shipped only from thence and from Sunderland, a small town at three leagues distance, which is scarcely known but by the nobleman who takes his title from it. From London to New∣castle, there are seventy leagues of as fine a country as is in the world; fifteen from New∣castle to Scotland, and twenty to Lancaster. In the counties of York, Westmoreland, Cum∣berland, Northumberland, and in the bishoprick of Durham, are all the excellent studs; consequently the cavalry and dragoons might be easily mounted. Besides 20,000 car∣riages and cart horses, which carry coals from the mines to Newcastle and Sunderland, will be found in that country, and may be useful for carrying the baggage of the army; but a more important consideration is, that the greatest part of the inhabitants of these districts are well affected towards his majesty, and may join him without any hindrance. The length of the navigation is the only objection that can be foreseen; to which it may be answered, that the difficulty consists in sailing from Dunkirk, and leaving the coast; but that ships when they are once at sea have nothing to fear; and it is immaterial whe∣ther the descent is made on the second or on the fourth day. It is proper to remark, that the favourable wind for this passage is the S. and S. E. which will hinder the ships in the Downs from putting to sea."</P>
<P>"A mistake in a conversation between Lewis XIV. and the late King, defeated the in∣vasion intended for this year. Mr. Powel, who had been sent by the adherents of the latter prince, from England, through the vehemence of his zeal, produced this mistake. He seemed to insinuate, that the Jacobites in Britain were first to take arms, and then expected to be supported by France. On this state of the case, his most Christian Majesty pro∣ceeded to make preparations for transporting a force into England. His order gives, were so well obeyed, that things were in great forwardness in the beginning of the year. James, therefore, and his servants, employed themselves in forming plans for invasion; the above is a scheme for a descent in the neighbourhood of Newcastle."</P></NOTE>.</P>

The wound was six inches long, and her pudens cam out and lay on each side of her, and was buried August 8th, 1703."</P>
<P>The MS. Life of Barnes, p. 354, gives the following particulars. "Elizabeth Sharper was well respected by all her neighbours, and lived with her sister to a great age un∣married, only it was whispered she bore a child to another woman's husband in her younger years. When she had reached her 80th year of age, she fell at once into a deep despair: there was no outward cause by losses or other calamities, that could be assigned as the occasion of it:—most, if not all the parish clergy of Newcastle visited her, but no comfort they could offer ever staid with her. She confessed her bearing a bastard, which was taken from her body, and she believed was murdered. She ript up her belly with a pair of scissars, and pulled her bowels out with her hand. A surgeon put them in their place again, and sewed up her belly. She had her reason and senses perfectly, and lived and died in a house that belonged to Mr. Barnes."</P>

<P>Bishop Crewe addressed a circular letter to the dean and clergy of the diocese of Dur∣ham on this occasion, dated Steane, November 9th, 1715. His lordship compliments the town of Newcastle for its Ioyalty on this occasion. "I hear Newcastle and Berwick, places of great consequence, and both in my diocese, have been very active for our pre∣sent constitution."</P>
<P>"On Monday, October 10th, 1715, the rebels marched to Morpeth, about 300 strong, all horse; they had expectation of surprizing Newcastle; preparing to march to New∣castle, which they expected should open its gates to them, a party having seized the post at Felton-Bridge, and one Thomas Gibson, a blacksmith of Newcastle, whom they ap∣prehended, and detained as a spy, which he is thought to have been from Alderman White, of Newcastle, a zealous gentleman for the govemment; and finding some delay in it, they promised themselves to have it in a few days, and in the mcan time marched to Hex∣ham. But even before any regular forces entered Newcastle, the magistrates and deputy lieutenants, having first suspicion, and soon after positive intelligence of the designs of the rebels to surprise it, had effectually prevented it, and had taken all imaginable precaution for their security, raising immediately what men they could, securing and imprisoning all papists and suspected persons; arming and encouraging the inhabitants for their own de∣fence. Indeed, the magistrates shewed a very commendable zeal in the interest of the King, and the service of the town; and no less courage in their application to the defence of the place. They got the militia and train bands, who about that time were ordered to muster at Killingworth-Moor, near the town, to be taken into it for its better defence. At the same time the Earl of Scarborough, lord lieutenant of the county of Northumberland, repaired with his friends to Newcastle; and the gentry of those parts, after his lordship's example, mounted their neighbours and tenants on horsebakc, so that the town was full of horses and men, both townsmen and countrymen unanimously declaring for King George. A body of 700 volunteers were armed by the town for their immediate guard. The keel∣men offered a body of 700 men more to be always ready at half an hour's warning; an association having been signed by the whole body of loyal inhabitants. In the middle of this hurry, a battalion of foot, and part of a regiment of dragoons, came to Newcastle, and than all their fears vanished. On the 18th of October, Lieutenant-General Carpenter, with Hotham's regiment of foot, and Cobham's, Molesworth's, and Churchill's draggons, arrived at Newcastle, the gates of which were walled up with stone and lime very strong. These left Newcastle, and lay at Woo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> 27th of Octobr, intending to face Kelso the next day.

<P>In the night between Saturday the 16th and Sunday 17th of No∣vember this year, the river Tyne, swoln to an amazing height by a land flood, which had been occasioned by an unremitted fall of heavy rains in the west, swept away the bridge at Newcastle upon Tyne, with the loss of many lives, and immense damages of the inhabitants of that place, and its vicinity<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><P>About eleven o'clock it began, and continued to rise till about seven o'clock next morning, when it was about seven feet four inches above the common flow of a good spring tide, in Bewick's entry, in the street called the Close. It continued at a stand between seven and eight o'clock next morning, and then gradually decreased. About two o'clock that morning, several ships and keels were driven from their moorings, and a very great quantity of tar, timber, deals, &amp;c. was swept off the key, upon which also four ships were left stranded, when the flood subsided. About an hour afterwards, the arches of Tyne bridge began to fill up, and between three and four o'clock, part of it to∣wards Gateshead fell in, and seven of the inhabitants were drowned. The stoppage of water at the bridge occasioned a violent current in the Close and Sandhill, to the north corner of which a boat was rowed. About five o'clock, the north arch adjoining to the toll shop on the bridge fell in: providentially the wind blew from the north-east; had it blown from the west, it might have occasioned a greater rapidity, and been attended with still more fatal consequences. The water fell between eight and nine o'clock five inches; from nine to ten, sixteen inches; from ten to eleven, twenty-five inches; from eleven to twelve, thirty-two inches; from twelve to one, it fell four feet; from one to two, five feet four inches; and was off the key at four o'clock that afternoon, when it had subsided in all about eight feet.—Paper communicated by Mr. Thomas Aubone.</P>
<P>The utility of Jarrow Slake appeared in this disaster, as it took in so immense a body of water, that at Shields the flood was no higher than a spring tide: great damage, how∣ever, was done in that place to the shipping. A vessel took up at sea near that place, a wooden cradle, with a child in it, which was alive and well. Friday morning, Novem∣ber 29th, 1771, two more of the houses on the west side of the south end of Tyne bridge fell down, as did also next morning the remaining part of the south end of the bridge. The week following, the workmen began to remove the ruins of the bridge, and take down the houses on the north end thereof, in order to erect a temporary one with all possible ex∣pedition. November 27th, 1771, the corporation of Newcastle advertised, that a com∣modious and safe ferry for conveying carriages, horses, &amp;c. across the river Tyne, was completed, to attend every day, from six in the morning to eight o'clock at night, and for∣ward dispatches from the post-office at any hour.—Newcastle Courant.</P></NOTE>.</P>

The balloon, being liberated on one side, made a rapid stretch upwards, whereby a considerable rent was made in the neck of it: this occasioned a loud noise, and a considerable discharge of inflammable air: the consternation now be∣came general, in spite of Mr. Lunardi's remonstrances, and the balloon being set at liberty, ascended with great rapidity, and dragged up with it Mr. Ralph Heron, junior, son of the under sheriff of Northumberland, who had twisted a rope, fastened to its top, round his hand and arm, to the height, it is supposed, of five hundred feet, when the rope and netting being disengaged from the balloon, he sell into a garden adjoining, and expired soon after. —In an advertisement which Mr. Lunardi inserted on the occasion in the Newcastle pa∣pers, he says, "It remains for him to yield his own wish to fulfil the expectation of the town to the feelings of a parent wounded by the loss of a most amiable son, and to forbear a repetition in this place of an attempt, which, without fault on his part, has been fatal to the peace of a respectable family."</P>

<P>(In a modern hand) Ex' with a copy from the record by P. Gibson &amp; W. A. D. 20 April, 1772, W. D.</P>
<Q><P>"Judgment in Parliament 34 Ed. I. where the Prior of Tinmouth having lands adjoining to the said river of Tyne at North Shields, and having built a shoar there, within the flood∣mark; it was adjudged that it should be removed at the cost of the prior. It may not be amiss to give some account of this trial.</P>
<P>"The contents mentioned in a plea at Westminster, in the 20th year of Edward I.</P>
<P>"Between the King, and the Burgesses of Newcastle, and the Prior of Tinmouth.</P></Q>
<P N="1">1st, THE whole port in the water of Tyne; 2d, His ovens at Newcastle; 3d, For every quarter of corn there baked; 4th, Of Custom; 5th, The King loseth at North-Shields for the issues of baking per annum 10<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and by the forestalling of the market there 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> The said prior also taketh the wreck of the sea, which specially belongs to the King.</P>
<P>"The King could also take two tun of wine to be chosen behind and before, and every tun of wine for 20<ABBR>s.</ABBR> of every ship of herrings 100, herrings, &amp;c. all which the said prior takes at Shields and elsewhere, by which means the King lost his prises and customs due to him; because the same merchandises came not entirely to his due port of Newcastle.</P>
<P>"The prior also built four ovens at Tinmouth, which were rented at 5<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> per annum, and kept a market on the Lord's day at Tinmouth. It was also objected to him, that the whole country and the mariners applied themselves, and sold their goods and merchandize at Shields, to the King's great detriment, he receiving no toll nor other profits for the same.</P>
<P>"The King ought to have the towage of ships and boats, greater and smaller, in the river of Tyne, in going up to Newcastle, and down to the sea, freely over any lord's land, &amp;c. The King ought to have in his port 4<ABBR>d.</ABBR> for every boat that has an oar, and 1<ABBR>d.</ABBR> for every lesser one that has none.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>"IN ANSWER,</HEAD>
<P>"The prior said, the premises did only touch his free tenement, and he answered, that as for the wreck of the sea, the forestalling of merchandises, &amp;c. be and his predece∣sors had them by charter of King John, grandfather of King Edward I. and so he pro∣ceeds to his new town of Shields.</P>
<P>"He said also, that he had 110 market or oven at Shields. But as to the fishers and buying of fish, he saith, that his predecessors in their times have always had their own fishers fishing in the same water, for the maintenance of their house, toll free, &amp;c. be∣cause the port of the water of Tyne doth especially and entirely belong to the King, and that they (meaning the prior and convent of Tinmouth) have had certain their tenants of Shields, wish their boats within their dcmclncs. " And</P>
<P><PB N="567" REF="577"/>"And as for the market at Tinmouth, he said he claimed none there; but he had a rumbrel, and had hired fishers, brewers and bakers, and also shambles there.</P>
<P>"As to the charge of towage, he said, that he never hindered those that exercised any such office in the water of Tyne, adjacent to his land, save only at Elstwick or Ast∣wick.</P>
<P>"He said moreover, that before and at the time of making King Richard's charter, which was before any liberties granted to Newcastle by King John, the priors of this house took and had all the premises freely and quietly, &amp;c. by virtue of custom of liberties granted to them by their said charter by land and water, whereof he found his church seized, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"Whereupon he demanded judgment.</P>
<P>"Those who prosecuted for the King, said, that the charter was worth nothing. As to the wreck of the sea, they said, no sooner had the ships applied themselves out of the great sea into the said port, and there had the misfortune to break, then the said prior taketh the goods of such broken ships, both swimming and therein abiding, and converts them to his own use; and that the then prior was seized of ten tuns of wine, out of a certain ship of Peter of Appleby, burgess of York, wrecked in the said water.</P>
<P>"And as to the charging or discharging of ships, and of merchandises, &amp;c. they said, that whereas the said port of Tyne is only the King's, as often as the prior should do so, the King was manifestly injured, being then, and always before, in seizin and possession of the said port.</P>
<P>"As to the town of Shields, they said, that whatsoever small dwelling houses there had been there, &amp;c. the said prior (that then was caused there to be made twenty-six houses upon the King's soil; because they are comprehended within the flowing and inundation of the sea, and they demanded the record of justice, that the said then prior alleged that the King therein hath no soil, &amp;c. but that it merely belonged to him, even to the fill of the water.</P>
<P>"They also said, that in those houses at Shields, there were fishers and brewers, and victuallers, &amp;c. so rich that they were able to give loading and victuals for 100 or 200 ships, which ought to apply themselves at Newcastle upon Tyne, and there buy their victuals for the bettering the said town. Whereupon they said, that the said prior is the only occupier of the King's soil, and the only taker away of the said King's town of Newcastle, and that he the said prior had sixteen fishers or more, with great boats, fishing in the sea yearly for traffick's sake only, and not for maintenance of his house; whereof the King received neither toll nor custom.</P>
<P>They said also, that the said prior and his men come out with their horses and car∣riages, and out of such ships as came thither, got necessaries for themselves, so that most times ships and boats return empty and half laden to other ports than to New∣castle aforesaid, whereby the King cannot receive his due prises and customs.</P>
<P>"And after they said that John of the Vale, I suppose De le Val, being judge itine∣rant, 7 Edw. I. It was then reported by the jury, that the prior of Tinmouth built a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the bank on the water of Tyne on one side, and the prior of Durham levied, or built another on the other side, where no towns ought to be, unless lodges only for fishermen; and that the fishermen have there sold their fishes, which ought to have been sold at Newcastle, to the great hurt of the said town, and loss of the King's prises: and that both the said priors of Tinmouth and Durham have caused to be made brewers, and fishers, having great ships, whereas they ought to have but boats, and have caused bread to be baked there, which ought to have been baked at New∣castle.</P>
<P>"It is inhibited and forbidden the said prior of Tinmouth, that from thenceforth he should not hold, or cause to be held a market or fair, in the aforesaid places, and was
<PB N="568" REF="578"/>
determined that the port within the water of Tyne, from the sea to Heddon Streams, is the free port of the King and his heirs, with its prises, customs, towages, tonages, with all other profits and commodities incident and belonging to the same &amp;c. and that neither at Tinmouth, nor at Shields, ships are to be laden or unladen.</P>
<P>"It was also ordered, that four ovens at Tinmouth should pay damages five marks, and those that took tonnage and make forestal, &amp;c. and as to the wrecks of the sea, &amp;c. that the King and his heirs should have them for ever hereafter; as to the markets and fairs, that there be not at Tinmouth or Shields any market or fair, and that neither at Tinmouth or Shields there be any sale of things saleable, as in meats, drinks, or any other things whatsoever, whereby the King, his heirs and successors may be made the worse.</P>
<P>"It was also ordered, that the keys and other things levied and raised by the said prior within the flood-mark on the King's soil, should be removed at the costs of the said prior."—Bourne's Newcastle, p. 161.</P>

<P>"THE <HI>original claim</HI> of the <HI>mayor and burgesses</HI> to the <HI>jurisdiction of the river Tyne,</HI> was from King <HI>Henry the Sixth.</HI></P>
<P>"Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> being humbly <HI>intreated by the mayor</HI> and <HI>burgesses</HI> of Newcastle that her majesty would be graciously pleased to <HI>grant them a charter of liberties concern∣ing sea-jurisdiction and of admiralty in that port,</HI> (to wit) between Sparhawk in the Sea and Hadwyn Streams, being fourteen miles in length, for the advance of the estate of that town, which also was granted as follows:</P>
<P>"The Queen, by her letters patent, dated the <HI>30th day of August,</HI> in the <HI>31st year</HI> of her <HI>reign,</HI> touching the office of the high admiralty of the river of Tine and port of Newcastle, <HI>grants the reversion to the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle,</HI> by reason it, was granted under the great seal of England, bearing date the <HI>fifth of February,</HI> 1522, unto <HI>Charles Lord Howard of Effingham,</HI> amongst other things, in his said patent in the office of lord high admiral of England, &amp;c. for life, <HI>who outlived the Queen,</HI> and <HI>died 26th January in the sixteenth</HI> year of <HI>King James.</HI></P>
<P>"King James, in the second year of his reign, being humbly supplicated by the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle, that he would be graciously pleased to confirm all their antient grants and charters, and to give them further powers, especially of the river Tyne, the King confirms these charters, but grants nothing new, only alters the election of their officers, and prescribes them new oaths to be administred to the said officers in their elections, which charter is in the Chapel of Rolls.</P>
<P>"Also, the King and his Council grants them the conservancy of the river of Tyne, by giving <HI>nine articles</HI> upon the <HI>29th of January,</HI> 1613, and joined in the said order <HI>the Bishop of Durham</HI> and other justices of peace of the county of Durham and Northum∣berland, with the six aldermen of the said town of Newcastle. But <HI>three years after</HI> the mayor, aldermen and jury of the burgesses, exhibited a <HI>great complaint to the king and Council</HI> at Whitehall, <HI>of the great decay of the river,</HI> occasioned by the said commissioners, through their neglect and breach of trust. Which complaint begat this following re∣ference from the council table, and further power to add to the former:</P>
<BIBL><HI>February</HI> 14th, 1616.</BIBL>
<P>"Whereas, upon complaint of the decay of the river Tyne, and of the daily abuses done and committcd to the prejudice of the same, certain articles were granted on the 29th of January, 1613, and commandcd to be put in execution for the remedy of such abuses: And forasmuch as a jury of Newcastle men have, by their petition to this board, grievously complained those abuses were wholly neglected by the mayor and six aldermen of the same town, and the Bishop of Durham and justices of peace, all which were joint commissioners for the preservation of that river, the river decaying so fall, that in short time it would be dord and wrecked up with sand, &amp;c. if not order soon taken therein: The council ordered Sir Ralph Winwood, Sir Julius Cesar, and Sn Daniel Dun one of the judges of the admiralty, with the assistance of the Trinity Mas∣ters of London, to draw up thirteen articles more, to be joined with the former nine.

<P>HAVING this day viewed the harbour of Tinmouth, and particularly that part of the entry thereof lying between the Low-Lights and the Black-Middens; I am of opinion that it will be a great addition to the security of vessels entering and going our of the said harbour; if the loose stones that lie scattered upon the North shore, between the Muscle-Scalp and the Prior-Stones, were removed: these stones in some places ex∣tend themselves into the channel, so that ships which happen by accident to take the ground, often receive damage that would be prevented by their removal; and also by affording a greater width and capacity, would greatly add to the convenience of ves∣sels working to windward, either into or out of the harbour.</P>
<P>The rocks called the Prior-Stones, I am of opinion, for the same reason, should be re∣moved and made level; together with such others as obstruct the channel, as far as they can be got at.</P>
<P>The stones that lie near the Black-Middens, may be stowed away in the hollows of this ledge of rocks, so as to strengthen and increase the utility thereof, as a break∣water, and which, if carefully deposited in the method of a pile of cannon-shot, I am of opinion, will lie, where they shall be placed. Those at a greater distance may be laid in the same method, on a ridge extending over the highest part of the ground be∣tween the Black-Middens and the shore; which will also add to the break-water, and in some measure prevent the current from dividing near high-water into two chan∣nels; and as to those stones that lie up still nearer to the Muscle-Scalp, they may be deposited under the high cliffs, which will tend to the defence and security th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>. Those stones may be removed in different ways; each of which according to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>∣stances may have its advantage; and indeed, I would advise them all to be tried, from whence it may be with certainty determined which way is ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able at the least charge.</P>
<P N="1">1st. The smaller kind of stones may be moved by hand-barrows.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The larger kind may be split with gun-powder and mauls, and then removed by hand-barrows.</P>
<P N="3">3d. They may in some places, both large and small, be removed by carts.</P>
<P N="4">4th. They may be removed by lighters laid on shore, and loaded at low-water, and removed on tide of flood.</P>
<P N="5">5th. They may be drawn over the rough ground by hand windlasses and tackles, to be moved from place to place as need shall require.</P>
<P>The stones may be laid hold of by eye-bolts fixed in h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les bored with a jumper, Lewis fashion, or they may be harnessed with chains.</P>
<P><PB N="587" REF="597"/>I would advise that the workmen at all times employ themselves upon those stones that lie lowest and nearest the channel, and as the flow of tides obliges them to retreat, to work upon those that lie higher.</P>
<P>I observe that a great many of the stones to be removed are very good lime-stones, which if broke up, I apprehend many would be glad to remove for the sake of the lime.</P>

<P>PURSUANT to the request of the right worshipful John Baker, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> mayor, and of the corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne:</P>
<P>We the master, &amp;c. of this house, having this day taken a survey of the rocks and loose stones, lying between the Low-Lights and Black-Middens, are of opinion, that taking up and removing the said rocks and stones, would be of the greatest advantage and utility to the navigation of the river Tyne, viz. where the rocks and stones now lie, there would be a bed of ouze and sand, consequently a fine bason and reservoir for the first influx of the stood-tide; and it is evident that ships or vessels will work in or out of the river Tyne with the greater safety.</P>
<P>The necessity of taking up and removing these rocks and stones is so obvious, and the practicableness thereof such as prevents us saying any more on that head, there∣fore annex Mr. Smeaton's opinion, which we hope will have its due weight.</P>

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX, P. 32. (No. 2.)</HI> A particular Case determined in the Court of King's Bench, on the Act, viz. 19 Geo. II. for the better Preservation of Rivers in England.</HEAD>
<P>A PERSON invented a machine or vessel, called a Hopper (and obtained a patent for it), to take ballast out of ships in rivers, in order to convey the same to the sea, and there drop it. The Hopper was so contrived, that the ballast. might be dropped from its bottom any where at pleasure, as opportunities offered, without being perceived by any, but those in the Hopper, or very near it.</P>
<P>This Hopper came into the river Tyne, and (besides the above objection), after trial, it was found to waste its ballast as it sailed, in such a degree, as to discolour the water where it passed; and being generally disapproved of, Alderman Smith, a justice of the peace at Newcastle upon Tyne (in order to put a stop to its being further used there), upon an information made to him, against one Brucklesbank, a shipmaster, for ballast being cast out of his ship into the Hopper, in order that such ballast might be dropt into the water, and not cast on the land where the tide never flows, summoned Bruck∣lesbank, and, on due proof, convicted and fined him according to the act: Bruckles∣bank, supported by the patentee, brought an action against the alderman for so doing, which was tried at Northumberland assizes, when the jury gave a special verdict, whereon the case was argued in the court of King's Bench, and decided as follows, viz.</P>
<P>M. 32. G. 2. Brucklesbank and Smith. On a special verdict from Northumberland assizes, it was stated, that the defendant, Mr. Smith, was a justice or the peace for the town and county of Newcastle upon Tyne; and that the plaintiff was master of a ship, floating in the river Tyne, being a navigable river; that three tons of ballast and more were unloaded out of the said ship, into a machine or vessel called a Hopper, in the said river, with intent that it should be carried therein into the high and open seas, and that it was accordingly carried out of the said river into the high and open seas, and was there cast out of the said Hopper, where the water was more than 14 fathom deep, at a distance from any port, haven, channel, or navigable river: whereupon the said Mr. Smith convicted the plaintiff as an offender against this act. And the plaintiff brought his action. It was urged, on behalf of the plaintiff, that this was no offence within the meaning of the act; that the mischief which the legislature had in view, was throwing the ballast or rubbish either on the shore, or the sides of rivers, and below the full sea-mark. But this was in the open and high sea, above 14 fathom deep, at a distance from any port, haven, channel, or river. By Lord Mansfield, Ch. J. This is a general question, which goes farther than this particular case: but it is a very plain and clear case, and expressly against the prohibition of the act; which provides, that it shall not be thrown but upon the land. Whereas this man says, that he has found a better way, than that which the act has expressly prescribed: but here is such an opening to fraud in this way, that he has thought a better one, that it would be danger∣ous to trust to this method, though it were not prohibited. However, it is enough, that it is contrary to the direct and express provision of the act. Indeed, if it was put into the Hopper, in order merely to carry it upon the land; that would only be the proper means of doing it, and therefore would not be an offence within the act: but this is with intent to lay it in the water; and there can be no security as to the place where the Hopper may drop it. It is mighty easy, from the construction of the Hopper, to drop it privately. And it is also the interest of the person who carries it in the
<PB N="589" REF="599"/>
Hopper, to drop it as soon as he can; that he may come the sooner again to fetch more The shifting it out of one ship into another, without intention to drop it any where, would not be a case within the act: for that would not be a casting or throw∣ing out at all, within the meaning of the act. And judgment was given by the court, unanimously, for the defendant, the justice. Burrow, Mansfield. 656.</P>

<P>IT appearing by the votes of the House of Commons of the <HI>fourth</HI> day of <HI>this instant February,</HI> that a petition of several owners and masters of ships employed in the coal-trade between London and Shields was presented to the house, setting forth (amongst other things) that from the present method of unloading ballast from ships, the river Tyne has of late years in many places become so shallow, and the river so apparently filling up, that the consequences are become greatly alarming, and praying the house to take the same into consideration: It is therefore unanimously agreed, and ordered accordingly, that a petition (of which the following is a true copy) be prepared, and that the governor be requested to sign the same, and also to affix the common seal of this fraternity thereto, and that the same be immediately after presented to the House of Commons.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SHEWETH,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT your petitioners observe by the votes of this honourable house of the 4th day of February instant, that a petition of the owners and masters of ships employed in the coal-trade between London and Shields, has been presented to this honourable house, containing allegations touching the harbour and river of Tyne, which your petitioners apprehend are not well founded.</P>
<P>That the preservation of the navigation of the river Tyne is of great consequence to your petitioners, and, as your petitioners humbly conceive, to this kingdom in general. That at the mouth of the river Tyne, there is a bar, and also a large bed of sand called the <HI>Herd;</HI> and, as your petitioners apprehend, the navigation of the said river may be in danger of being totally obstructed by a considerable increase of sand or ballast either upon the bar or Herd.</P>
<P>That your petitioners conceive the permitting of ballast to be unloaded from ships or vessels in the river Tyne, otherwise than to be cast or thrown upon the dry land where the tide or water never flows or runs, may be of dangerous consequence to the port and river of Newcastle: your petitioners, therefore, most humbly pray this honour∣able house to take the premises into consideration, and hope this honourable house will
<PB N="590" REF="600"/>
not make any alteration in the laws now in force concerning the unloading of ballast in the said port or river of Newcastle upon Tyne.</P>
<P>And your petitioners, as in duty bound, shall ever pray.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, P. 63. JARROW.</HEAD>
<P>THE large fragment of a Roman stone found at Jarrow, and inscribed, "Om∣nium Fil' Hadriani," &amp;c. I suppose to have been part of an altar erected in honour of all the adopted sons of the Emperor Hadrian: taking this for granted, the word "omnium" must have been preceded by "pro salute." See an inscription on a stone found at the other extremity of the Roman wall, and now or lately at Boulness, in the county of Cumberland, and others.</P>
<P>Hadrian was over in person in Britain, A. D. 120.</P>
<P>Antoninus Pius, who succeeded him in the empire, was one of those adopted sons alluded to in the inscription.—Consult "Vita Hadriani—Script. Hist. August."</P>
<P>The other Roman stone, found in the same place, appears, like that at Tinmouth, to have been a tablet on the front of some temple, or other publick building, and acquires considerable importance from the circumstance of its containing the name of our island, Britannia, at full length. I suspect that the word "ostium" has followed "utrumque;" and that it perhaps may have been brought from the station of South Shields. The word ostium may, however, with the strictest propriety, be applied to the very spot where it was found. I shall hazard an explanation of this curious inscrip∣tion, at the same time leaving the learned, who are conversant in this species of anti∣quities and who may depend upon the faithfulness of the annexed representation, to judge for themselves.</P>
<P>I would supply the lacunae thus:</P>
<P>Diffusis provinciis in Britannia ad utrumque ostium exercitus posuit (or) sieri secit.</P>
<P>And translate it as follows:</P>
<P>"The army erected this on the extension of the Roman dominion in Britain from the western to the eastern sea."</P>
<P>N. B. I must observe in this place, that, as I set out with a resolution not to suppress any historical evidence, I could not but insert the returns of crimes found on the visi∣tation of Jarrow, Tinmouth monastery, &amp;c. which I found in the Cotton Library; yet, I flatter myself I shall be thought to have done this, rather to shew what sort of pretences were made for suppressing the religious houses at the Reformation, than either because I believed the facts myself, or wished to incline others to what I fear would be generally considered as a very uncharitable species of credulity.</P>

<P>N. B. This clause of the King's approving of the recorder and town-clerk is new, and not in former charters; and as this charter of Charles II. is only a charter of con∣firmation, and not granted npon a surrender of former charters and franchises, it is doubtful whethcr this clause doth restrain the former liberties and charters of the cor∣poration. Vide Raym. 439. Comb. 316. 1 Salkeld 168. Skinner 5769. The method of electing officers in a corporation by an old charter, cannot be altered by a new charter; but acting under the new charter, is an evidence of their consent making it good.</P>
<P>The King cannot resume an interest he hath already granted, unless the grantee concur. But in this case, the corporation hath concurred by accepting it, and pro∣ceeding accordingly, which is an evidence of their consent.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>(From Grey's MSS.)</HEAD>
<P>A<SUP>o</SUP>. 1684, Sir Nath. Johnson wrote a letter to the corporation that the King ex∣pected a surrender' of their charter, or that the mayor, recorder, sheriff, and town-clerk, might be always in the King's power to appoint or confirm; upon which the corporation sent a petition to the King, signed by Sir William Blatkett, mayor, and all the common-council (which is entered in the book of orders), whereby they desire the King to confirm their ancient privileges, and promise and agree that the mayor, re∣corder, sheriff, and town-clerk, shall be of his Majesty's appointing.</P>
<P>They again address the King by Sir Geo. Jeffreys when he came judge this circuit, July, anno 1684, and promise the same thing.</P>
<P>A Quo Warranto served February 11th, 1687.</P>
<P>March 7th, 1687, a surrender of their charter is actually sealed, and sent up—(Sir William Creagh, mayor, went to London, March 13th, with the surrender)—Qu. if it was inrolled? N. B. Tlns is all entered in the book of orders.</P>
<P><PB N="643" REF="653"/>Vide proclamation to restore charters—printed in the State Tracts, vol. i. p. 49, by which it appears that the surrender of Newcastle charter was not inrolled. In a letter dated 3d November, 1688, subscribed by Silvester Petyt, and directed to Mr. Douglas, are these words: "As for the-proclamation and orders touching the cor∣porations, I was at the Crown-office, and the clerk told me they were all sent under seal to all the corporations, and that Green, a messenger, had those for Newcastle, and believes you have them before this; and because you think the Gazet not sufficient, I have sent you the proclamation and order printed by the King's printers, and think you may (if the other be not come) give credit to these."</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>A Case concerning the Surrender of Charters to King James II. and the opinion of Mr. Holt, who was afterwards lord chief justice of the King's Bench, taken just before King William came in.</HEAD>
<P>THE mayor, aldermen, and common-counsel, A. D. 1684, surrendered to the King the magisterial part of their charter (but it was not inrolled), and the King granted a new charter, and therein constituted several new aldermen, reserving a power to dis∣place the mayor and aldermen at his pleasure, signified by an order of the privy seal.</P>
<P>Afterwards the King (by virtue of the power in the new charter) by mandamus, December 24th, turns out the mayor and aldermen; and A<SUP>o</SUP>. 1687 appoints others who are chosen in their places, who make another surrender of the charter (March 7th, 1687) more at large than the former surrender (but this last surrender was not inrolled), and a new charter granted, in which a power is reserved in the King to place or displace.</P>
<P>Then the King makes an order to displace the new mayor, aldermen, and all officers; and by a proclamation, 17th October, 1688, requires the corporations whose surren∣ders were not inrolled, to take upon them to act as corporations, and where places were vacant by death, or otherwise, to fill them up, and an order of counsel for the purpose.</P>
<P>Qu. 1. If this proclamation doth repeal the two last charters without scire facias?</P>
<P>R. I conceive the new charters are void, because the first was not surrendered, nor was that surrender of the power of making magistrates inrolled, and there need no scire facias.</P>
<P>Qu. 2. If the aldermen who were displaced by the powers in the first new charter, and had been aldermen before the surrender, are again aldermen, and may by law act as such by virtue of the proclamation and order of counsel?</P>
<P>R. Those who were aldermen by the old charter before any surrender, are alder∣men, and may by law act as such.</P>
<P>Qu. 3. If those officers in the corporation, who had offices for a year, must not be rechosen before they can act?</P>
<P>R. In most corporations the mayor, and other officers who are annual, continue af∣ter the expiration of the year, until another be sworn; therefore I think it sit that he that was mayor at the time of the first surrender, do surrender his office of mayor, and then that the corporation proceed to a new election of a new mayor, as in case of death of a mayor; and after the election of the mayor, and his being sworn, let the sheriff and other officers (that are annual) and were in office at the time of the first surrender, resign their offices, and then let the corporation proceed to the electing and swearing new ones in their places.</P>
<P>Qu. 4. What electors must choose officers into vacant offices, whether those that were electors for that year (in which) the charter was first surrendered (the electors being chosen only for a year), or the election to be made by summoning the several com∣panies and societies, who used annually on Michaelmas Monday to make an election of the mayor and other officers?</P>
<P><PB N="644" REF="654"/>R. Let new electors be chosen for the residue of the year ensuing before the mayor makes his resignation of his office, and let their election be according to custome, for the proclamation gives them this power, though the usual day be past.</P>
<P>Qu. 5. Whether those new-made freemen by mandates, or the last mentioned char∣ters, pattents or grants, can claim any benefit or advantage thereby, or are such free∣doms extinguished?</P>
<P>R. Such freedoms as were made since the first surrender are void.</P>

<LETTER>
<P>WHEREAS it hath been found by long experience, that the erecting of a court for recovery of small debts, and relieving of poor debtors in London, under the value of forty shillings, hath been of great benefit and advantage to the poore sort of freemen and inhabitants of the said city, and hath prevented many great mischiefs and inconveniencies that would otherwise have fallen upon them by the charges of arrest and other processe &amp; proceedings in law; and forasmuch as the towne and county of the towne of Newcastle upon Tyne is very large and populous, consisting of many poor freemen, artificers, labourers, and others inhabiting therein, amongst whom, for want of the like good order and establishment, divers vexatious suits for divers debts, and in several actions upon the case upon assumpsits have been and are commenced and prosecuted as well in the courts at Westminster as in other courts or places, which hath been and is the occasion of much more expence to the parties than the respective debts and causes of action for which they sue have amounted unto, to the ruine of them, their wives and children, and by meanes thereof great charges to the corporation for their support and maintenance have been contracted and occasioned; for remedy whereof, be it enacted by the King and Queen's most excellent Majesties, by and with the ad∣vice and consent of the Lords spirituall and temporall and Commons in this present par∣liament assembled, and by authority of the same, that there be a court to be commonly called or known by the name of a Court of Requests, or Conscience, for reliese of the poorer sort of people in small debts and actions upon the case upon assumpsits in the towne and county of the towne of Newcastle upon Tyne erected and established, and such court is hereby erected and established for and within the said towne and county of the towne of Newcastle upon Tyne, to have continuance for ever; and that the maior, aldermen, and common-council of the said towne for the time being (or the major part of them) whereof the mayor and six aldermen to be seaven, shall and are hereby impowered and required from time to time once in every yeare to nominate, elect, and choose such and soe many persons as they shall think fitt, not being under the

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX, P. 311. (No. 1.)</HI> Notices concerning the Art of and curious Machines and Contrivances used in winning and working Coal Mines.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>BORING AND SINKING.</L>
<L>"When likely signs th' advent'rous search invite,</L>
<L>A cunning artist tries the latent soil;</L>
<L>And if his subtle engine in return</L>
<L>A nitrous mass contains, brittle and adust;</L>
<L>Strait he prepares th' obstructive earth to clear,</L>
<L>And raise the sable rook."</L>
<BIBL>JAGO'S EDGEHILL.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE tools of borers are of the simplest kind, and consist of iron rods, each between three and four feet long, and about an inch and a half square, with a screw (a bed and what fits into it) at each end, by which they are united, and lengthened out as the hole increases in its depth. The chisel is about eighteen inches long, and two and a half broad at the end, and is fixed to the lowest of the rods. The uppermost rod is furnished with an eye, wherein to insert a piece of timber for an handle for two or more workmen to take hold of at once. Their mode of operation is to lift up the rods a little, and then let them fall again, turning them at the same time gently round: by a continuance of this motion a round hole is fretted and worn by degrees through the hardest strata.</P>
<P>When the chisel is quite blunted, or has cut down four or six inches, the rods are lifted up<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot"><P>The borers can put on handles for two, three, or four persons to work, as they find it necessary. After they get down to a certain depth, the rods are wrought by a bracke: a box of wood is inserted first into the ground, to keep the rods in a straight direction. A triangle is erected over the spot where the boring is made, for the sake of drawing up the rods: they have one key to unscrew, and another to secure the rods from falling back again. They use a close wimble to bring up sludge and soft matter.</P>
<P>The established prices of boring are said to be 5 shillings per fathom for the first five fathoms—10 shil∣lings for the next five—15 shillings per fathom for the subsequent five—and so continually increasing, shil∣lings per fathom at the end of every five fathoms. The borer usually finds all his own implements; but when a whinstone occurs above a foot in thickness, he is paid by the day. Three inches diameter for a bore-hole, or boring, is sufficient. The whinstone sometimes resists the hardest-tempered steel, and can scarce be wrought upon.</P></NOTE>, either altogether, if there be convenience, or by pieces, when a key is used to keep the rods from dropping down into the hole, and being either lost, or re∣coverable only with great labour. The chisel is screwed off, and the wimple or scoop put on. This being put down brings up afterwards the dust or pulverised matter of the stratum, through which the chisel has cut, and shews as well what kind of matter they are boring in as the exact depth thereof.</P>
<P>The skilful workmen, however, feel easily, and distinguish the sorts of strata they are upon by the difficulty or facility with which they advance downwards. The prin∣cipal part of the borer's art depends on keeping the hole clean, and observing every variation of the strata with care and attention.</P>
<P><PB N="679" REF="691"/>By the wetness of the rods they know when any feeder of water is pricked, and by their falling down as it were without any labour, when they are upon an old waste or colliery that has been wrought before.</P>
<P>This is an art of the utmost use and importance in collieries; for by boring previously to the sinking of a pit, the owner procures most essential data whereon to proceed, being informed before hand of the nature of the earth, minerals and waters through which he has to pass, and knowing to an inch or so how deep his coal lies, as well as its quality, and the thickness of the stratum or bed<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vide Encyclopaedia, Edinburgh, quarto, in voce "Coalieries;" also The Complete Collier.</NOTE>. The boring notes<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wallis's History of Northumberland, vol. i. p. 129.</NOTE> of collieries are the grand arcana of the coal trade, and secrets which the owners by no means chuse to discover to the prying eyes of the curious philosopher.</P>
<P>No lease is taken of any ground which has not previously been explored by boring. The boring being completed, in order to win the coals, they afterwards sink what is called the shaft<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">sceaft Sagitta. Cuspis, Lignum, teres.

<HEAD>DIP AND RISE OF THE STRATA OF COAL.</HEAD>
<P>BY the sinking of the shaft is opened out a communication with the bed of the coal. The strata of this fossil are seldom or never found to lie in a true horizontal situation, but generally have an inclination or descent, called the dip<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>In all places where the strata lie regular, they are divided and subdivided, &amp;c. Though it is often otherwise; for their regularity is frequently interrupted, and the strata broken and disordered by sundry chasms, breaches or fissures, which are differently denominated according to their various dimensions, and the matters with which they are filled, viz. dikes, hitches, and troubles.</P>
<P>Dikes are the largest kind of fissures; they seem to be nothing but a cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k or breach of the solid strata, occasioned by one part of them being broken away and fallen from the other. They generally run in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> straight line tor a considerable length, and penetrate from the surface to the greatest depth ever yet tried, in a direction sometimes perpendicular to the horizon, and sometimes obliquely. The same kinds of strata are found lying upon each other in the same order, but the whole of them greatly elevated or depressed, on the one side of the dike as on the other. These fissures are sometimes two or three feet wide, and sometimes many fathoms. If the fissure or dike be of any considerable width, it is g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nerally filled with heterogeneous matter, different from that of the solid strata on each side of it. It is sometimes found filled up with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, gravel or sand; sometimes with a confused mass of different kinds of stone <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing edgeways, and at other times with a solid body of freestone, or even whinstone. When the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of no great width, as suppose two or three feet only, it is then usually found filled up with a confused mixture of the different matters which compose the adjoining strata, consolidated into one mass. If a dike <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tches north and south, and the same kinds of strata are found on the east side of the dike, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with respect to the horizon t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o or twenty fathoms lower than on the other side, it is then s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id to be a dip-dike or down-east dike of ten or twenty fathoms to the eastward. Or counting from the east side, it is said to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-dik<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of so many fathoms westward. If the strata on one side are not much higher or lower, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> respe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the horizontal line, than those on the other, but only broken <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> certain <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> then said to be dike of so many fathoms thic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the two side <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the fissure or dike, it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d nominated a clay-dike, stone-dike, &amp;c. — <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge of the keelmen, called dikes▪</P>
<P>A hitch is only a dike or fissure of a smaller <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by which the strata <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> separated from those on the other side above one fathom.</P>
<P>These hitches are denominated in the same manner as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> depress the strata. These are dikes (though not often n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled with spa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of iron, lead vitriol, or other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> known that all metallic veins are nothing else than what in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>▪</P>
<P>The strata are generally found lying upon each other in the same order on one side of the dike as on the other, as mentioned above, and nearly of the same thicknesses, appearing to have been originally a continua∣tion of the same regular strata, and the dike only a breach by some later accident, perpendicularly or ob∣liquely down through them, by which one part is removed to a small distance, and depressed to a lower situa∣tion than the other.</P>
<P>But this is not the only alteration made in the strata by dikes; for generally, to a considerable distance on each side of the dike, all the strata are in a kind of shattered condition, very tender, easily pervious to water, and debased greatly in their quality, and their inclination to the horizon often altered.</P>
<P>Troubles may be denominated dikes or the smallest degree; for they are not a real breach, but only an approach towards it which has not taken a full effect. The strata are generally altered by a trouble, from their regular site to a different position. When the regular course of the strata is nearly level, a trouble will cause a sudden and considerable ascent or descent: where they have in their regular situation a certain de∣gree of ascent or descent, a trouble either increaseth it, or alters it to a contrary position; and a trouble has these effects upon the strata in common with dikes, that it greatly debaseth them from their original quality; the partings are separated, the backs and cutters disjoined, and their regularity disordered. The original cubic and prismatic figures of which the strata were composed, are broken, and the dislocation filled with heterogeneous matter; and the whole strata are reduced to a foster and more friable state.</P>
<BIBL>ENCYCLOPAEDIA, ut supra.</BIBL></NOTE>, to some particular part of the horizon. If this inclination be to the eastward, it is called an east dip, and a west rise; and according to the point of the compass to which the dip inclines it is denominated, and the ascent or rise is to the contrary point.</P>
<P><PB N="680" REF="692"/>This inclination or dip of the strata is found to hold every where. In some places it varies very little from the level; in others very considerably; and in some so much as to be nearly in a perpendicular direction: but whatever degree of inclination the strata have to the horizon, if not interrupted by dikes, hitches, or troubles, they are always found to lie in the first regular manner mentioned. They generally continue upon one uniform dip until they are broken or disordered by a dike, hitch, or trouble, by which the dip is often altered, sometimes to a different part of the horizon, and often to an opposite point; so that on one side of a dike, hitch, or trouble, if the strata have an east dip<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><P>Wallis, in his History of Northumberland, tells us, that "by the best observations of the miners, the coal seams generally rise to the north-west, and dip to the south-east."</P>
<P>Dr. Stukeley, in his Itin. Curios. 1725, says, that "some of the coal-works here dip full east."—" It is plain," he adds, "south-east is the natural dip in general. Those at Whitehaven, inclining south-west, receive, I suppose, a counter bias, as being in the wslt side of the island."</P>
<P>In the same Itinerary he observes, "that the coal in this country, and which is universally diffused through it, dips many ways, as the falls of vallies or duct of rivers occasionally divert its primary bent; but the main dip of it is to the south-east. Sometimes there are fissures or interruptions of some consider∣able quantities, being coaled strata, stone and other materials, jumbled together: This proves that these has been such a partial disruption of the strata of the earth, as we all along suppose was effected by the De∣luge, but not such a hotch-potch or total mixture and confusion as others would pretend."</P>
<P>Pennant, in his Tour, vol. ii. p. 56, speaking of the mines at Whitehaven, says, "The beds of coal are nine or ten feet thick, and dip to the west one yard in eight. In various parts are great bars of stone, which cut off the coal; if they bend one way, they influence the coal to rise above one's head; if another, to sink beneath the feet—operations of Nature past my skill to unfold."</P></NOTE>, on the other side they may have an east rise, which is a west dip; and in general any considerable alteration in the dip is never met with, but what is occasioned by the cir∣cumstances last mentioned.</P>
<P>It is very observable, that in some places near Newcastle upon Tyne there are four different strata or seams of coals, one above another, at considerable distances.</P>
<P>The following occurs in the affidavits of viewers 1722, Sir Robert Raymond's Re∣ports, Walker manor, 1723.</P>
<P>"In Benwell, Elswick, and Fenham collieries, there have been before the working thereof certain seams of coals, called the upper main coal, the metal coal, the stone coal, and the lower main coal."</P>

<HEAD>OF GINS.</HEAD>
<P>GIN is said with great probability to be a corruption of "engine." See Skinner's Etymology. The glossary to G. Douglas's Virgil says, that the Scots use it in that sense. It occurs among the coal machines in Plott's Staffordshire. There is an engraving of a common coal gin in Emerson's Mechanics, and a description thereof at page 267. The roller is immediately over the shaft, and the track of the horses goes quite round the pit.</P>
<P>There is a sort of gins<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>Above ground there are two banksmen, who take off the corves at top, and empty, or, as the work∣men call it, "<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teem" them. They receive for wages 2½<ABBR>d.</ABBR> for every score of corves between them—1½<ABBR>d.</ABBR> is farther allowed for every said score for the banksmen's horse. The drivers of the horses that run in the gin have usually 10<ABBR>d.</ABBR> a day.</P>
<P>When the coals are brought to the pit bottom, the corves or baskets are then hooked on to a chain, and drawn up the pit by a rope to the surface, which is best effected by a machine called a gin, wrought by horses. There are other kinds of gins for drawing coals, some wrought by water, others by the vibrating lever ot a fire engine: but either of these last is only convenient in some particular situations, these wrought by horses being in most general use." Encyclopaedia, Edinburgh, in verbo "Coalery."</P>
<P>"At Walker Colliery," says Wallis in his History of Northumberland, vol. i. p. 128. "there are two ventilators workd with a machine by the help of the fire engine. This machine is also applied to turn a wheel for raising coals, bringing up a cort of twenty p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks an hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thoms in the space of a minute, the horses moving in a walk."—See the description and drawing of such a machine, &amp;c. by Feen Fitz∣gerald, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in the Philosophical Transactions, part ii. for the year 1758, p. 727.</P></NOTE> called "whim gins," and a kind known by the name of "macaroni gins." In a whim gin the ropes run upon two wheel pullies over the shaft. The roller is at some distance, and the circular track of the horses is not round the shaft. At Long Benton Colliery, as also at Willington, Walker, &amp;c. the coals are brought up by a gin wrought by a little steam engine<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In the Universal Magazine for February 1782, is given "An account of a new machine or sue engine, invented by Mr. Thomas Hunt of London, for draining mines and coa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-works, and at the same time raising the ore or coal from the bottom of the mine to the surface, without the assisance of horses, or of any additional fuel: with an exact representation of the same engraved on copper."—Two engines on this construction have lately been erected; the one at Killingworth\moor Colhery, belonging to John Pitt, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the other on the colhery near Walker, belonging to John Chapman, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> &amp;c of Newcastle. By this useful invention, a considerable number of horses, that were before employed in those cap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d collieries, are rendered unnecessary.

The steam engine-post lifts the water out of what is called "the sump," into a reservoir, so as to be above the water-wheel, which, instead of a horse or horses, turns the gin. A little runner or feeder to supply the reservoir with water, is necessary.</P>

An admirable and most forcible way to drive up water by fire, not by drawing or sucking it upwards, for that must be, as the philosopher calleth it, "intra sphaeram activitatis," which is but at such a distance. But this way hath no bounder, it the vessels be strong enough: for I have taken a piece of a whole cannon, whereof the end was burst, and filled it three quarters full of water, stopping and screwing up the broken end, as alls the touch-hole; and making a constant fire under it, within twenty-four hours it burst, and made a great crack: so that having a way to make my vessels, so that they are strengthened by the force within them, and the one to fill after the other. I have seen the water run like constant foun∣tain stream forty feet high: one vessel of water, rarefied by fire, driveth up forty of cold water. And a man that tends the work, is but to turn two cocks, that one vessel of water being consumed, another begins to force and refil with cold water; and so successively the fire being tended and kept constant, which the self-fame person may likewise abundantly perform in the interim between the necessity of turning the said cocks."

D. 1676. Lord Keeper Guildford, who was upon the northern circuit that year, thus describes them: "The manner of the carriage is by laying rails of timber from the colliery down to the river, exactly straight and parallel; and bulky carts are made with four rowlets, fitting these rails, whereby the carriage is so easy, that one horse will draw down four or five chaldron of coals, and is an immense benefit to the coal merchants."</P>
<P>The first waggons are said to have wanted the conveniencies of letting out at the bottom, having been emptied with shovels, like the present ballalst waggons. It ap∣pears by the old books of the Hostmen's Company, A. D. 1600, that the then coal

waines contained eight bowls of coals, and some scarce seven bowls. The present waggons contain more than twice that quantity.</P>
<P>In the London Magazine for March, 1764, there is a representation and descrip∣tion of a coal waggon, communicated to the Editors by a Gentleman, who dates from Chester-le-street, 21st of December, 1763, and signs himself</P>
