<P>ON this day, Schedoni was more com∣municative
than on the preceding one.
While they rode apart from the guide,
he conversed with Ellena on various
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
topics relative to herself, but without
once alluding to Vivaldi; and even con∣descended
to mention his design of dis∣posing
of her in a convent at some dis∣tance
from Naples, till it should be con∣venient
for him to acknowledge her for
his daughter. But the difficulty of find∣ing
a suitable situation embarrassed him,
and he was disconcerted by the aukward∣ness
of introducing her himself to stran∣gers,
whose curiosity would be heightened
by a sense of their interest.</P>
<P>These circumstances induced him the
more easily to attend to the distress of
Ellena, on her learning that she was
again to be placed at a distance from her
home, and among strangers; and the
more willingly to listen to the account
she gave of the convent of Santa Maria
della Pieta, and to her request of return∣ing
thither. But in whatever degree he
might be inclined to approve, he listened
without consenting, and Ellena had only
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
the consolation of perceiving that he was
not absolutely determined to adopt his
first plan.</P>
<P>Her thoughts were too deeply en∣gaged
upon her future prospects to per∣mit
leisure for present fears, or probably
she would have suffered some return of
those of yesterday, in traversing the lonely
plains and rude vallies, through which
the road lay. Schedoni was thankful to
the landlord, who had advised him to
keep the guide, the road being frequently
obscured amongst the wild heaths that
stretched around, and the eye often sweep∣ing
over long tracts of country, without
perceiving a village, or any human dwell∣ing.
During the whole morning, they
had not met one traveller, and they con∣tinued
to proceed beneath the heat of
noon, because Schedoni had been unable
to discover even a cottage, in which
shelter and repose might be obtained.</P>
<P>It was late in the day when the guide
pointed out the grey walls of an edifice,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
which crowned the acclivity they were
approaching. But this was so shrouded
among woods, that no feature of it could
be distinctly seen, and it did but slightly
awaken their hopes of approaching a con∣vent,
which might receive them with hos∣pitality.</P>
<P>The high banks overshadowed with
thickets, between which the road as∣cended,
soon excluded even a glimpse
of the walls; but, as the travellers turned
the next projection, they perceived a per∣son
on the summit of the road, crossing
as if towards some place of residence,
and concluded that the edifice they had
seen was behind the trees, among which
he had disappeared.</P>
<P>A few moments brought them to the
spot, where, retired at a short distance
among the woods that browed the hill,
they discovered the extensive remains of
what seemed to have been a villa, and
which, from the air of desolation it exhi∣bited,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Schedoni would have judged to be
wholly deserted, had he not already
seen a person enter. Wearied and ex∣hausted,
he determined to ascertain whe∣ther
any refreshment could be procured
from the inhabitants within, and the party
alighted before the portal of a deep and
broad avenue of arched stone, which
seemed to have been the grand approach
to the villa. The entrance was obstructed
by fallen fragments of columns, and by
the underwood that had taken root
amongst them. The travellers, however,
easily overcame these interruptions: but
as the avenue was of considerable extent,
and as its only light proceeded from
the portal, except what a few narrow
loops in the walls admitted, they soon
found themselves involved in an obscu∣rity
that rendered the way difficult, and
Schedoni endeavoured to make himself
heard by the person he had seen. The
effort was unsuccessful, but, as they pro∣ceeded,
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
a bend in the passage shewed a
distant glimmering of light, which served
to guide them to the opposite entrance,
where an arch opened immediately into a
court of the villa. Schedoni paused here
in disappointment, for every object seemed
to bear evidence of abandonment and de∣solation;
and he looked, almost hopelessly,
round the light colonnade which ran along
three sides of the court, and to the trees
that waved over the fourth, in search of
the person, who had been seen from the
road. No human figure stole upon the
vacancy; yet the apt fears of Ellena al∣most
imagined the form of Spalatro gliding
behind the columns, and she started as
the air shook over the wild plants that
wreathed them, before she discovered that
it was not the sound of steps. At the ex∣travagance
of her suspicions, however,
and the weakness of her terrors, she
blushed, and endeavoured to resist that
propensity to fear, which nerves long
pressed upon had occasioned in her mind.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Schedoni, meanwhile, stood in the court,
like the evil spirit of the place, examining
its desolation, and endeavouring to as∣certain
whether any person lurked in the
interior of the building. Several doorways
in the colonnade appeared to lead to cham∣bers
of the villa, and, after a short hesita∣tion,
Schedoni, having determined to
pursue his inquiry, entered one of them,
and passed through a marble hall to a
suite of rooms, whose condition told how
long it was since they had been inha∣bited.
The roofs had entirely vanished,
and even portions of the walls had fallen,
and lay in masses amongst the woods
without.</P>
<P>Perceiving that it was as useless as
difficult to proceed, the confessor re∣turned
to the court, where the shade of
the palmetos, at least, offered an hos∣pitable
shelter to the wearied travellers.
They reposed themselves beneath the bran∣ches,
on some fragments of a marble
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
fountain, whence the court opened to the
extensive landscape, now mellowed by
the evening beams, and partook of the
remains of a repast, which had been de∣posited
in the wallet of the guide.</P>
<P>“This place appears to have suffered
from an earthquake, rather than from
time,” said Schedoni, “for the walls,
though shattered, do not seem to have de∣cayed,
and much that has been strong lies
in ruin, while what is comparatively slight
remains uninjured; these are certainly
symptoms of partial shocks of the earth.
Do you know any thing of the history of
this place, friend?”</P>
<P>“Yes, Signor,” replied the guide.</P>
<P>“Relate it, then.”</P>
<P>“I shall never forget the earthquake
that destroyed it, Signor; for it was felt all
through the Garganus. I was then about
sixteen, and I remember, it was near an
hour before midnight that the great shock
was felt. The weather had been almost
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
stifling for several days, scar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly a breath
of air had stirred, and slight tremblings of
the ground were noticed by many people.
I had been out all day, cutting wood in
the forest with my father, and tired enough
we were, when—”</P>
<P>“This is the history of yourself,” said
Schedoni, interrupting him, “Who did
this place belong to?”</P>
<P>“Did any person suffer here?” said
Ellena.</P>
<P>“The Baróne di Cambrusca lived
here,” replied the guide.</P>
<P>“<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah! the Baróne!” repeated Schedoni,
and sunk into one of his customary fits of
abstraction.</P>
<P>“He was a Signor little loved in the
country,” continued the guide, “and
some people said it was a judgment upon
him for—”</P>
<P>“Was it not rather a judgment upon
the country,” interrupted the Confessor,
li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting up his head, and then sinking again
into silence.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
“I know not for that, Signor, but he
had committed crimes enough to make
one's hair stand on end. It was here that
he—”</P>
<P>“Fools are always wondering at the
actions of those above them,” said Sche∣doni,
testily; “Where is the Baróne
now?”</P>
<P>“I cannot tell, Signor, but most likely
where he deserves to be, for he has never
been heard of since the night of the earth∣quake,
and it is believed he was buried
under the ruins.”</P>
<P>“Did any other person suffer?” re∣peated
Ellena.</P>
<P>“You shall hear, Signora,” replied the
peasant, “I happen to know something
about the matter, because a cousin of our's
lived in the family at the time, and my
father has often told me all about it,
as well as of the late lord's goings-on.
It was near midnight when the great shock
came, and the family, thinking of nothing
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
at all, had supped, and been asleep some
time. Now it happened, that the Baróne's
chamber was in a tower of the old build∣ing,
at which people often wondered,
because, said they, why should he chuse
to sleep in the old part when there are so
many fine rooms in the new villa? but
so it was.”</P>
<P>“Come, dispatch your meal,” said
Schedoni, awaking from his deep musing,
“the sun is setting, and we have yet far
to go,”</P>
<P>“I will finish the meal and the story
together, Signor, with your leave,” replied
the guide. Schedoni did not notice what
he said, and, as the man was not for∣bidden,
he proceeded with his relation.</P>
<P>“Now it happened, that the Baróne's,
chamber was in that old tower,—if you
will look this way, Signora, you may see
what is left of it.”</P>
<P>Ellena turned her attention to where
the guide pointed, and perceived the shat∣tered
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
remains of a tower rising beyond
the arch, through which she had entered
the court.</P>
<P>“You see that corner of a windowcase,
left in the highest part of the wall, Sig∣nora,”
continued the guide, “just by that
tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of ash, that grows out of the stone.”</P>
<P>“I observe,” said Ellena.</P>
<P>“Well, that was one of the windows
of the very chamber, Signora, and you
see scarcely any thing else is left of it.
Yes, there is the door-ease, too, but the
door itself is gone; that little staircase,
which you see beyond it, led up to another
story, which nobody now would guess had
ever been; for roof, and flooring, and
all are fallen. I wonder how that little
staircase in the corner happened to hold so
fast!”</P>
<P>“Have you almost done?” inquired
Schedoni, who had not apparently at∣tended
to any thing the man said, and
now alluded to the refreshment he was
taking.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
“Yes, Signor, I have not a great deal
more to tell, of to eat either, for that
matter,” replied the guide; “but you
shall hear. Well, yonder was the very
chamber, Signora; at that door-ease,
which is still in the wall, the Baróne
came in; ah! he little thought, I warrant▪
that he should never more go out at it!
How long he had been, in the room I do
not know, nor whether he was asleep, or
awake, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or there is nobody that can tell;
but when the great shock came, it split
the old tower at once, before any other
part of the buildings. You see that heap
of ruins, yonder, on the ground, Signora,
there lie the remains of the chamber;
the Baróne, they say, was buried under
them!”</P>
<P>Ellena shuddered while she gazed upon
this destructive mass. A groan from
Schedoni startled her, and she turned
towards him, but, as he appeared shrouded
in meditation, she again directed her
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
attention to this awful memorial. As her
eye passed upon the neighbouring arch,
she was struck with the grandeur of its
proportions, and with its singular appear∣ance,
now that the evening rays glanced
upon the overhanging shrubs, and darted
a line of partial light athwart the avenue
beyond. But what was her emotion,
when she perceived a person gliding away
in the perspective of the avenue, and, as
he crossed where the gleam fell, distin∣guished
the figure and countenance of
Spala<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro! She bad scarcely power faintly
to exclaim, “Steps go there!” before he
had disappeared; and, when Schedoni
looked round, the vacuity and silence of
solitude every where prevailed.</P>
<P>Ellena now did not scruple positively to
affirm that she had seen Spalatro, and
Schedoni, fully sensible that, if her imagi∣nation
had not deluded her, the purpose
of his thus tracing their route must be
desperate, immediately rose, and, followed
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
by the peasant, passed into the avenue to
ascertain the truth, leaving Ellena alone
in the court. He had scarcely disap∣peared
before the danger of his adven∣turing
into that obscure passage, where an
assassin might strike unseen, forcibly oc∣curred
to Ellena, and she loudly conjured
him to return. She listened for his voice,
but heard only his retreating steps; when,
too anxious to remain where she was, she
hastened to the entrance of the avenue.
But all was now hushed; neither voice,
nor steps were distinguished. Awed by
the gloom of the place, she feared to ven∣ture
further, yet almost equally dreaded
to remain alone in any part of the ruin,
while a man so desperate as Spalatro was
hovering about it.</P>
<P>As she yet listened at the entrance of
the avenue, a faint cry, which seemed
to issue from the interior of the villa,
reached her. The first dreadful surmise
that struck Ellena was, that they were
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
murdering her father, who had proba∣bly
been decoyed, by another passage,
back into some chamber of the ruin;
when, instantly forgetting every fear
for herself, she hastened towards the
spot whence she judged the sound to
have issued. She entered the hall, which
Schedoni had noticed, and passed on
through a suite of apartments beyond.
Every thing here, however, was silent,
and the place apparently deserted. The
suite terminated in a passage, that seemed
to lead to a distant part of the villa, and
Ellena, after a momentary hesitation,
determined to follow it.</P>
<P>She made her way with difficulty be∣tween
the half-demolished walls, and was
obliged to attend so much to her steps,
that she scarcely noticed whither she was
going, till, the deepening shade of the
place recalling her attention, she per∣ceived
herself among the ruins of the
tower, whose history had been related
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
by the guide; and, on looking up,
observed she was at the foot of the
staircase, which still wound up the wall,
that had led to the chamber of the Ba∣róne.</P>
<P>At a moment less anxious, the cir∣cumstance
would have affected her;
but now, she could only repeat her calls
upon the name of Schedoni, and listen
for some signal that he was near. Still
receiving no answer, nor hearing any
further sound of distress, she began to
hope that her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears had deceived her,
and having ascertained that the passage
terminated here, she quitted the spot.</P>
<P>On regaining the first chamber, El∣lena
rested for a moment to recover
breath; and, while she leaned upon
what had once been a window, opening
to the court, she heard a distant report
of fire-arms. The sound swelled, and
seemed to revolve along the avenue
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which Schedoni had disappeared.
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
—Supposing that the combatants were
engaged at the farthest entrance, Ellena
was preparing to go thither, when a
sudden step moved near her, and, on
turning, she discovered, with a degree
of horror that almost deprived her of
recollection, Spalatro himself stealing
along the very chamber in which she
was.</P>
<P>That part of the room which she
stood in, fell into a kind of recess; and
whether it was this circumstance that
prevented him from immediately per∣ceiving
her, or that, his chief purpose
being directed against another object,
he did not chuse to pause here, he passed
on with skulking steps; and, before
Ellena had determined whither to go,
she observed him cross the court before
her, and enter the avenue. As he had
passed, he looked up at the window:
and it was certain he then saw her, for
he instantly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aultered, but in the next
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
moment proceeded swiftly, and disap∣peared
peared in the gloom.</P>
<P>It seemed that he had not yet en∣countered
Schedoni, but it also occurred
to Ellena, that he was gone into the
avenue for the purpose of waiting to
assassinate him in the darkness. While
she was meditating some means of
giving the Confessor a timely alarm of
his danger, she once more distinguished
his voice. It approached from the
avenue, and Ellena immediately calling
aloud that Spalatro was there, entreated
him to be on his guard. In the next
instant a pistol was fired there.</P>
<P>Among the voices that succeeded the
report, Ellena thought she distinguished
groans. Schedoni's voice was in the
next moment heard again, but it seemed
faint and low. The courage which she
had before exerted was now exhausted;
she remained fixed to the spot, unable
to encounter the dreadful spectacle that
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
probably awaited her in the avenue,
and almost sinking beneath the expec∣tation
of it.</P>
<P>All was now hushed; she listened for
Schedoni's voice, and even for a foot∣step
—in vain. To endure this state of
uncertainty much longer was scarcely
possible, and Ellena was endeavouring
to collect fortitude to meet a knowledge
of the worst, when suddenly a feeble
groaning was again heard. It seemed
near, and to be approaching still nearer.
At that moment, Ellena, on looking
towards the avenue, perceived a figure
covered with blood, pass into the court.
A film, which drew over her eyes, pre∣vented
her noticing farther. She tot∣tered
a few paces back, and caught at
the fragment of a pillar, by which she
supported herself. The weakness was
transient; immediate assistance appeared
necessary to the wounded person, and
pity soon predominating over horror,
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
she recalled her spirits, and hastened to
the court.</P>
<P>When, on reaching it, she looked
round in search of Schedoni, he was no
where to be seen; the court was again
solitary and silent, till she awakened all
its echoes with the name of <HI>father.</HI>
While she repeated her calls, she hastily
examined the colonnade, the separated
chamber which opened immediately from
it, and the shadowy ground beneath
the palmetos, but without discovering
any person.</P>
<P>As she turned towards the avenue,
however, a tract of blood on the ground
told her too certainly where the wounded
person had passed. It guided her to
the entrance of a narrow passage, that
seemingly led to the foot of the tower;
but here she hesitated, fearing to trust
the obscurity beyond. For the first
time, Ellena conjectured, that not
Schedoni, but Spalatro might be the
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
person she had seen, and that, though
he was wounded, vengeance might give
him strength to strike his stiletto at the
heart of whomsoever approached him,
while the duskiness of the place would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣the
deed.</P>
<P>She was yet at the entrance of the
passage, fearful to enter, and reluctant
to leave it, listening for a sound, and
still hearing at intervals, swelling though
feeble groans; when quick steps were
suddenly heard advancing up the grand
avenue, and presently her own name
was repeated loudly in the voice of
Schedoni. His manner was hurried as
he advanced to meet her, and he threw an
eager glance round the court. “We
must be gone,” said he, in a low tone,
and taking her arm within his. “Have
you seen any one pass?”</P>
<P>“I have seen a wounded man enter
the court,” replied Ellena, “and feared
he was yourself.”</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
“Where?—Which way did he go!”
inquired Schedoni, eagerly, while his
eyes glowed, and his countenance be∣came
fell.</P>
<P>Ellena, instantly comprehending his
motive for the question, would not ac∣knowledge
that she knew whither. Spa∣latro
had withdrawn; and, reminding
him of the danger of their situation,
she entreated that they might quit the
villa immediately.</P>
<P>“The sun is already set,” she added.
“I tremble at what may be the perils
of this place at such an obscure hour,
and even at what may be those of our
road at a later!”</P>
<P>“You are sure he was wounded?”
said the Confessor.</P>
<P>“Too sure,” replied Ellena, faintly.</P>
<P>“Too sure!” sternly exclaimed Sche∣doni.</P>
<P>“Let us depart, my father; O let us
go this instant!” repeated Ellena.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25"/>
“What is the meaning of all this!”
asked Schedoni, with anger. “You
cannot, surely, have the weakness to pity
this fellow!”</P>
<P>“It is terrible to see any one suffer,”
said Ellena. “Do not, by remaining
here, leave me a possibility of grieving for
you. What anguish it would occasion
you, to see me bleed; judge, then, what
must be mine, if you are wounded by the
dagger of an assassin!”</P>
<P>Schedoni stifled the groan which swelled
from his heart, and abruptly turned away.</P>
<P>“You trifle with me,” he said, in the
next moment: “you do not know that
the villain is wounded. I fired at him, it
is true, at the instant I saw him enter
the avenue, but he has escaped me.
What reason have you for your suppo∣sition?”</P>
<P>Ellena was going to point to the track
of blood on the ground, at a little dis∣tance,
but checked herself; considering
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
that this might guide him on to Spa∣latro,
and again she entreated they might
depart, adding, “O! spare yourself,
and him!”</P>
<P>“What! spare an assassin!” said Sche∣doni,
impatiently.</P>
<P>“An assassin! He <HI>has,</HI> then, attempted
your life?” exclaimed Ellena.</P>
<P>“Why no, not absolutely that,” said
Schedoni, recollecting himself, “but—
what does the fellow do here? Let me
pass, I will find him.”</P>
<P>Ellena still hung upon his garment,
while, with persuasive tenderness, she en∣deavoured
to awaken his humanity. “O!
if you had ever known what it was to
expect instant death,” she continued,
“you would pity this man now, as he,
perhaps, has sometimes pitied others! I
have known such suffering, my father,
and can, therefore, feel even for him!”</P>
<P>“Do you know for <HI>whom</HI> you are
pleading?” said the distracted Schedoni,
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
while every word she had uttered seemed
to have penetrated his heart. The surprize
which this question awakened in Ellena's
countenance, recalled him to a consci∣ousness
of his imprudence; he recollected
that Ellena did not certainly know the
office, with which Spalatro had been com∣missioned
against her: and when he con∣sidered
that this very Spalatro, whom
Ellena had with such simplicity supposed
to have, at some time, spared a life through
pity, bad in truth spared her own, and,
yet more, had been eventually a means
of preventing him from destroying his
own child, the Confessor turned in horror
from his design; all his passions changed,
and he abruptly quitted the court, nor
paused till he reached the farthest ex∣tremity
of the avenue, where the guide
was in waiting with the horses.</P>
<P>A recollection of the conduct of Spa∣latro
respecting Ellena had thus induced
Schedoni to spare him; but this was all;
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
it did not prevail with him to inquire
into the condition of this man, or to
mitigate his punishment; and, without
remorse, he now left him to his fate.</P>
<P>With Ellena it was otherwise; though
she was ignorant of the obligation she
owed him, she could not know that any
human being was left under such circum∣stances
of suffering and solitude, without
experiencing very painful emotion; but,
considering how expeditiously Spalatro
had been able to remove himself, she en∣deavoured
to hope that his wound was
not mortal.</P>
<P>The travellers, mounting their horses
in silence, left the ruin, and were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or
some time too much engaged by the
impression of the late occurrences, to
converse together. When, at length, El∣lena
inquired the particulars of what had
passed in the avenue, she understood that
Schedoni, on pursuing Spalatro, had seen
him there only for a moment. Spalatro
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
had escaped by some way unknown to
the Confessor, and had regained the in∣terior
of the ruin, while his pursuers
were yet following the avenue. The cry,
which Ellena had imagined to proceed
from the interior, was uttered, as it now
appeared, by the guide, who, in his
haste, had fallen over some fragments
of the wall that lay scattered in the
avenue: the first report of arms had
been from the trombone, which Schedoni
had discharged on reaching the portal;
and the last, when he fired a pistol, on
perceiving Spalatro passing from the court.</P>
<P>“We have had trouble enough in run∣ning
after this fellow,” said the guide,
“and could not catch him at last. It
is strange that, if he came to look for
us he should run away so when he
had found us! I do not think he meant
us any harm, after all, else he might have
done it easily enough in that dark passage;
instead whereof he only took to his heels!”</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30"/>
“Silence!” said Schedoni, “fewer
words, friend.”</P>
<P>“Well, Signor, he's peppered now,
however; so we need not be afraid;
his wings are clipped for one while, so
he cannot overtake us. We need not
be in such a hurry, Signor, we shall
get to the inn in good time yet. It is
upon a mountain yonder, whose top
you may see upon that red streak in
the west. He cannot come after us; I
myself saw his arm was wounded.”</P>
<P>“Did you so?” said Schedoni, sharply:
“and pray where was you when you
saw so much? It was more than I saw.”</P>
<P>“I was close at your heels, Signor,
when you fired the pistol.”</P>
<P>“I do not remember to have heard
you there,” observed the Confessor: “and
why did you not come forward, instead
of retreating? And where, also, did you
hide yourself while I was searching for
the fellow, instead of assisting me in the
pursuit?”</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31"/>
The guide gave no answer, and El∣lena,
who had been attentively observ∣ing
him during the whole of this con∣versation,
perceived that he was now
considerably embarrassed; so that her
former suspicions as to his integrity be∣gan
to revive, notwithstanding the se∣veral
circumstances, which had occurred
to render them improbable. There was,
however, at present no opportunity for
farther observation, Schedoni having,
contrary to the advice of the guide, im∣mediately
quickened his pace, and the
horses continuing on the full gallop, till
a steep ascent compelled them to relax
their speed.</P>
<P>Contrary to his usual habit, Schedoni
now, while they slowly ascended, ap∣peared
desirous of conversing with this
man, and asked him several questions
relative to the villa they had left; and,
whether it was that he really felt an in∣terest
on the subject, or that he wished
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
to discover if the man had deceived him
in the circumstances he had already nar∣rated,
from which he might form a
judgment as to his general character, he
pressed his inquiries with a patient mi∣nuteness,
that somewhat surprized Ellena.
During this conversation, the deep twi∣light
would no longer permit her to
notice the countenances of either Sche∣doni,
or the guide, but she gave much
attention to the changing tones of their
voices, as different circumstances and
emotions seemed to affect them. It is to
be observed, that during the whole of this
discourse, the guide rode at the side of
Schedoni.</P>
<P>While the Confessor appeared to be
musing uponsomething, which the peasant
had related respecting the Baróne di Cam∣brusca,
Ellena inquired as to the fate of
the other inhabitants of the villa.</P>
<P>“The falling of the old tower was
enough for them,” replied the guide;
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
“the crash waked them all directly, and
they had time to get out of the new
buildings, before the second and third
shocks laid them also in ruins. They
ran out into the woods for safety, and
found it too, for they happened to take a
different road from the earthquake. Not
a soul suffered, except the Baróne, and
he deserved it well enough. O! I could
tell such things that I have heard of
him!—”</P>
<P>“What became of the rest of the
family?” interrupted Schedoni.</P>
<P>“Why, Signor, they were scattered here
and there, and every where; and they
none of them ever returned to the old spot.
No! no! they had suffered enough there
already, and might have suffered to this
day, if the earthquake had not hap∣pened.”</P>
<P>“If it had <HI>not</HI> happened?” repeated
Ellena.</P>
<P>“Aye, Signora, for that put an end to
the Baróne. If those walls could but
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
speak they could tell strange things, for
they have looked upon sad doings: and
that chamber, which I shewed you, Sig∣nora,
nobody ever went into it but him∣self,
except the servant, to keep it in
order, and that he would scarcely suffer,
and always staid in the room the while.”</P>
<P>“He had probably treasure secreted
there,” said Ellena.</P>
<P>“No, Signora, no treasure! He had
always a lamp burning there; and some∣times
in the night he has been heard—
Once, indeed, his valet happened to—”</P>
<P>“Come on,” said Schedoni, inter∣rupting
him; “keep pace with me. What
idle dream are you relating now?”</P>
<P>“It is about the Baróne di Cambrusca,
Signor, him that you was asking me so
much about just now. I was saying what
strange ways he had▪ and how that, on
one stormy night in December, as my
cousin Francisco told my father, who told
me, and he lived in the family at the
time it happened—”</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35"/>
“What happened?” said Schedoni,
hastily.</P>
<P>“What I am going to tell, Signor.
My cousin lived there at the time; so,
however <HI>unbelievable</HI> it may seem, you
may depend upon it, it is all true. My
father knows I would not believe it my∣self
till—”</P>
<P>“Enough of this,” said Schedoni;
“no more. What family had this Ba∣róne
—had he a wife at the time of this
destructive shock?”</P>
<P>“Yes, truly, Signor, he had, as I was
going to tell, if you would but conde∣scend
to have patience.”</P>
<P>“The Baróne had more need of that,
friend; I have no wife.”—“The Baróne's
wife had most need of it, Signor, as you
shall hear. A good soul, they say, was
the Baronesfa! but luckily she died many
years before. He had a daughter, also,
and, young as she was, she had lived too
long, but for the earthquake which set her
free.”</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36"/>
“How far is it to the inn?” said the
Confessor, roughly.</P>
<P>“When we get to the top of this hill,
Signor, you will see it on the next, if
any light is stirring, for there will only
be the hollow between us. But do not
be alarmed, Signor, the fellow we left
cannot overtake us. Do you know much
about him, Signor?”</P>
<P>Schedoni inquired whether the trom∣bone
was charged; and, discovering that
it was not, ordered the man to load
immediately.</P>
<P>“Why, Signor, if you knew as much
of him as I do, you could not be more
afraid!” said the peasant, while he stopped
to obey the order.</P>
<P>“I understood that he was a stranger
to you!” observed the Confessor, with
surprize.</P>
<P>“Why, Signor, he is, and he is not;
I know more about him than he thinks
for.”</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37"/>
“You seem to know a vast deal too
much of other persons affairs,” said Sche∣doni,
in a tone that was meant to silence him.</P>
<P>“Why, that is just what he would
say, Signor; but bad deeds will out, whe∣ther
people like them to be known or not.
This man comes to our town sometimes
to market, and nobody knew where he
came from for a long while; so they set
themselves to work and found it out at
last.”</P>
<P>“We shall never reach the summit of
this hill,” said Schedoni, testily.</P>
<P>“And they found out, too, a great
many strange things about him,” con∣tinued
the guide.</P>
<P>Ellena, who had attended to this dis∣course
with a degree of curiosity that
was painful, now listened impatiently for
what might be farther mentioned concern∣ing
Spalatro, but without daring to in∣vite,
by a single question, any discovery
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
on a subject which appeared to be so inti∣mately
connected with Schedoni.</P>
<P>“It was many years ago,” rejoined the
guide, “that this man came to live in
that strange house on the sea-shore. It
had been shut up ever since—”</P>
<P>“What are you talking of now?” in∣terrupted
the Confessor.</P>
<P>“Why, Signor, you never will let me
tell you. You always snap me up so
short at the beginning, and then ask
—what am I talking about! I was going
to begin the story, and it is a pretty
long one. But first of all, Signor, who
do you suppose this man belonged to!
And what do you think the people de∣termined
to do, when the report was first
set a-going? only they could not be sure
it was true, and any body would be un∣willing
enough to believe such a shock∣ing—”</P>
<P>“I have no curiosity on the sub∣ject,”
replied the Confessor sternly inter∣rupting
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
him; “and desire to hear no more
concerning it.”</P>
<P>“I meant no harm, Signor,” said the
man; “I did not know it concerned
you.”</P>
<P>“And who says that it does concern,
me!”</P>
<P>“Nobody, Signor, only you seemed
to be in a bit of a passion, and so I
thought—But I meant no harm, Signor,
only as he happened to be your guide
part of the way, I guessed you might like
to know something of him.”</P>
<P>“All that I desire to know of my guide
is, that he does his duty” replied Sche∣doni,
“that he conducts me safely, and
understands when to be silent.”</P>
<P>To this the man replied nothing, but
slackened his pace, and slunk behind his
reprover.</P>
<P>The travellers reaching, soon after,
the summit of this long hill, looked out
for the inn of which they had been told;
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
but darkness now confounded every ob∣ject,
and no domestic light twinkling,
however distantly, through the gloom,
gave signal of security and comfort.
They descended dejectedly into the hollow
of the mountains, and found themselves
once more immerged in woods. Sche∣doni
again called the peasant to his side,
and bade him keep abreast of him, but
he did not discourse; and Ellena was
too thoughtful to attempt conversation.
The hints, which the guide had thrown
out respecting Spalatro, had increased her
curiosity on that subject; but the conduct
of Schedoni, his impatience, his embar∣rassment,
and the decisive manner in
which he had put an end to the talk of the
guide, excited a degree of surprize, that
bordered on astonishment. As she had,
however, no clue to lead her conjectures
to any point, she was utterly bewildered
in surmise, understanding only that Sche∣doni
had been much more deeply con∣nected
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
with Spalatro than she had hitherto
believed.</P>
<P>The travellers having descended into
the hollow, and commenced the ascent of
the opposite height, without discovering
any symptom of a neighbouring town,
began again to fear that their conductor
had deceived them. It was now so dark
that the road, though the soil was a lime∣stone,
could scarcely be discerned, the
woods on either side forming a “close
dungeon of innumerous boughs,” that
totally excluded the twilight of the stars.</P>
<P>While the Confessor was questioning
the man, with some severity, a faint
shouting was heard from a distance,
and he stopped the horses to listen from
what quarter it came.</P>
<P>“That comes the way we are going,
Signor,” said the guide.</P>
<P>“Hark!” exclaimed Schedoni, “those
are strains of revelry!”</P>
<P>A confused sound of voices, laughter,
and musical instruments, was heard,
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
and, as the air blew stronger, tambo∣rines
and flutes were distinguished.</P>
<P>“Oh! Oh! we are near the end of
our journey!” said the peasant; “all
this comes from the town we are going
to. But what makes them all so merry,
I wonder!”</P>
<P>Ellena, revived by this intelligence,
followed with alacrity the sudden speed
of the Confessor; and presently reach∣ing
a point of the mountain, where the
woods opened, a cluster of lights on
another summit, a little higher, more
certainly announced the town.</P>
<P>They soon after arrived at the ruin∣ous
gates, which had formerly led to a
place of some strength, and passed at
once from darkness and desolated walls,
into a market place, blazing with light
and resounding with the multitude.
Booths, fantastically hung with lamps,
and filled with merchandize of every
kind, disposed in the gayest order,
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
were spread on all sides, and peasants
in their holiday cloaths, and parties of
masks crowded every avenue. Here
was a band of musicians, and there a
group of dancers; on one spot the
<HI>outré</HI> humour of a zanni provoked the
never-failing laugh of an Italian rab∣ble,
in another the <HI>improvesatore,</HI> by
the pathos of his story, and the per∣suasive
sensibility of his strains, was
holding the attention of his auditors,
as in the hands of magic. Farther on
was a stage raised for a display of fire∣works,
and near this a theatre, where
a mimic opera, the “shadow of a
shade,” was exhibiting, whence the
roar of laughter, excited by the prin∣cipal
<HI>buffo</HI> within, mingled with the
heterogeneous voices of the venders of
ice, maccaroni, sherbet, and diavoloni,
without.</P>
<P>The Confessor looked upon this scene
with disappointment and ill-humour,
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
and bade the guide go before him, and
shew the way to the best inn; an of∣fice
which the latter undertook with
great glee, though he made his way
with difficulty. “To think I should
not know it was the time of the fair!”
said he, “though, to say truth, I ne∣ver
was at it but once in my life, so it
is not so surprizing, Signor.”</P>
<P>“Make way through the crowd,”
said Schedoni.</P>
<P>“After jogging on so long in the
dark, Signor, with nothing at all to be
seen,” continued the man, without at∣tending
to the direction, “then to
come, all of a sudden, to such a place
as this, why it is like coming out of
purgatory into paradise! Well! Sig∣nor,
you have forgot all your quanda∣ries
now; you think nothing now
about that old ruinous place where we
had such a race after the man, that
would not murder us; but that shot I
fired did his business.”</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45"/>
“You fired!” said Schedoni, aroused
by the assertion.</P>
<P>“Yes, Signor, as I was looking
over your shoulder; I should have
thought you must have heard it!”</P>
<P>“I should have thought so, too,
friend.”</P>
<P>“Aye, Signor, this fine place has
put all that out of your head, I war∣rant,
as well as what I said about that
same fellow; but, indeed, Signor, I
did not know he was related to you,
when I talked so of him. But, per∣haps,
for all that, you may not know
the piece of his story I was going to
tell you, when you cut me off so short,
though you are better acquainted with
one another than I guessed for; so,
when I come in from the fair, Signor,
if you please, I will tell it you; and it
is a pretty long history, for I happen
to know the whole of it; though,
where you cut me short, when you
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
was in one of those quandaries, was
only just at the beginning, but no
matter for that, I can begin it again,
for—”</P>
<P>“What is all this!” said Schedoni,
again recalled from one of the thought∣ful
moods in which he had so habitu∣ally
indulged, that even the bustle
around him had failed to interrupt the course
of his mind. He now bade the
peasant be silent; but the man was too
happy to be tractable, and proceeded
to express all he felt, as they advanced
slowly through the crowd. Every ob∣ject
here was to him new and delight∣ful;
and, nothing doubting that it must
be equally so to every other person,
he was continually pointing out to the
proud and gloomy Confessor the trivial
subjects of his own admiration. “See!
Signor, there is Punchinello, see! how
he eats the hot maccaroni! And look
there, Signor! there is a juggler! O!
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
good Signor, stop one minute, to look
at his tricks. See! he has turned a
monk into a devil already, in the twink∣ling
of an eye!”</P>
<P>“Silence! and proceed,” said Sche∣doni.</P>
<P>“That is what I say, Signor:—
silence! for the people make such a
noise that I cannot hear a word you
speak.—Silence, there!”</P>
<P>“Considering that you could not
hear, you have answered wonderfully
to the purpose,” said Ellena.</P>
<P>“Ah! Signora! is not this better than
those dark woods and hills? But what
have we here? Look, Signor, here is a
fine sight!”</P>
<P>The crowd, which was assembled round
a stage on which some persons grotesquely
dressed, were performing, now interrupt∣ing
all farther progress, the travellers were
compelled to stop at the foot of the plat∣form.
The people above were acting
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
what seemed to have been intended for a
tragedy, but what their strange gestures,
uncouth recitation, and incongruous coun∣tenances,
had transformed into a comedy.</P>
<P>Schedoni, thus obliged to pause, with∣drew
his attention from the scene; Ellena
consented to endure it, and the peasant,
with gaping mouth and staring eyes, stood
like a statue, yet not knowing whether he
ought to laugh or cry, till suddenly turn∣ing
round to the Confessor, whose horse
was of necessity close to his, he seized
his arm, and pointing to the stage, called
out, “Look! Signor, see! Signor, what
a scoundrel! what a villain! See! he has
murdered his own daughter!”</P>
<P>At these terrible words, the indignation
of Schedoni was done away by other emo∣tions;
he turned his eyes upon the stage,
and perceived that the actors were per∣forming
the story of Virginia. It was at
the moment when she was dying in the
arms of her father, who was holding up
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
the poniard, with which he had stabbed
her. The feelings of Schedoni, at this
instant, inflicted a punishment almost
worthy of the crime he had meditated.</P>
<P>Ellena, struck with the action, and
with the contrast which it seemed to
offer to what she had believed to have
been the late conduct of Schedoni to∣wards
herself, looked at him with most
expressive tenderness, and as his glance
met her's, she perceived, with surprize,
the changing emotions of his soul, and
the inexplicable character of his counte∣nance.
Stung to the heart, the Confessor
suriously spurred his horse, that he might
escape from the scene, but the poor ani∣mal
was too spiritless and jaded, to force
its way through the crowd; and the pea∣sant,
vexed at being hurried from a place
where, almost for the first time in his
life, he was suffering under the strange
delights of artificial grief, and half an∣gry,
to observe an animal, of which he
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
had the care, ill treated, loudly remon∣strated,
and seized the bridle of Sche∣doni,
who, still more incensed, was ap∣plying
the whip to the shoulders of the
guide, when the crowd suddenly fell back
and opened a way, through which the
travellers passed, and arrived, with little
further interruption, at the door of the
inn.</P>
<P>Schedoni was not in a humour which
rendered him fit to encounter difficulties,
and still less the vulgar squabbles of a
place already crowded with guests; yet
it was not without much opposition that
he at length obtained a lodging for the
night. The peasant was not less anxious
for the accommodation of his horses;
and, when Ellena heard him declare,
that the animal, which the Confessor
had so cruelly spurred, should have a
double feed, and a bed of straw as high
as his head, if he himself went without
one, she gave him, unnoticed by Sche∣doni,
the only ducat she had left.</P>

<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL>
<P>SCHEDONI passed the night without
sleep. The incident of the preceding
evening had not only renewed the agonies
of remorse, but excited those of pride
and apprehension. There was something
in the conduct of the peasant towards
him, which he could not clearly under∣stand,
though his suspicions were sufficient
to throw his mind into a state of the
utmost perturbation. Under an air of extreme
simplicity, this man had talked of
Spalatro, had discovered that he was ac∣quainted
with much of his history, and
had hinted that he knew by whom he had
been employed; yet at the fame time ap∣peared
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
unconscious, that Schedoni's was
the master-hand, which had directed the
principal actions of the ruffian. At
other times, his behaviour had seemed to
contradict the supposition of his igno∣rance
on this point; from some circum∣stances
he had mentioned, it appeared
impossible but that he must have known,
who Schedoni really was, and even his
own conduct had occasionally seemed to
acknowledge this, particularly when, be∣ing
interrupted in his history of Spalatro,
he attempted an apology, by saying, he
did not know it concerned Schedoni:
nor could the conscious Schedoni believe
that the very pointed manner, in which
the peasant had addressed him at the re∣presentation
of Virginia, was merely ac∣cidental.
He wished to dismiss the man
immediately, but it was first necessary to
ascertain what he knew concerning him,
and then to decide on the measures to be
taken. It was, however, a difficult mat∣er
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
to obtain this information, without ma∣nifesting
an anxiety, which might betray
him, if the guide had, at present, only a
general suspicion of the truth; and no
less difficult to determine how to proceed
towards him, if it should be evident that
his suspicions rested on Spalatro. To
take him forward to Naples, was to bring
an informer to his home; to suffer him
to return with his discovery, now that he
probably knew the place of Schedoni's
residence, was little less hazardous. His
death only could secure the secret.</P>
<P>After a night passed in the tumult of
such considerations, the Confessor sum∣moned
the peasant to his chamber, and,
with some short preface, told him he had
no further occasion for his services, add∣ing,
carelessly, that he advised him to be
on his guard as he re-passed the villa, lest
Spalatro, who might yet lurk there,
should revenge upon him the injury he
had received. “According to your ac∣count
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
of him, he is a very dangerous fel∣low,”
said Schedoni; “but your infor∣mation
is, perhaps, erroneous.”</P>
<P>The guide began, testily, to justify
himself for his assertions, and the Con∣fessor
then endeavoured to draw from him
what he knew on the subject. But, whe∣ther
the man was piqued by the treat∣ment
he had lately received, or had other
reasons for reserve, he did not, at first,
appear so willing to communicate as for∣merly.</P>
<P>“What you hinted of this man,”
said Schedoni, “has, in some degree, ex∣cited
my curiosity: I have now a few mo∣ments
of leisure, and you may relate, if
you will, something of the wonderful his∣tory
you talked of.”</P>
<P>“It is a long story, Signor, and you
would be tired before I got to the end of
it,” replied the peasant; “and, craving
your pardon, Signor, I don't much like
to be snapped up so!”</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55"/>
“Where did this man live?” said the
Confessor. “You mentioned something
of a house at the sea side.”</P>
<P>“Aye, Signor, there is a strange his∣tory
belonging to that house, too; but
this man, as I was saying, came there
all of a sudden, nobody knew how! and
the place had been shut up ever since the
Marchese—”</P>
<P>“The Marchese!” said Schedoni, cold∣ly,
“what Marchese, friend?”—“Why,
I mean the Baróne di Cambrusca, Signor,
to be sure, as I was going to have told
you, of my own accord, if you would
only have let me. Shut up ever since
the Baróne—I left off there, I think.”</P>
<P>“I understood that the Baróne was
dead!” observed the Confessor.</P>
<P>“Yes, Signor,” replied the peasant,
fixing his eyes on Schedoni; “but what
has his death to do with what I was
telling? This happened before he died.”</P>
<P>Schedoni, somewhat disconcerted by
this unexpected remark, forgot to re∣sent
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
the familiarity of it. “This man
then, this Spalatro, was connected with
the Baróne di Cambrusca?” said he.</P>
<P>“It. was pretty well guessed so, Sig∣nor.”</P>
<P>“How! no more than guessed?”</P>
<P>“No, Signor, and that was more
than enough for the Baróne's liking, I
warrant. He took too much care for
any thing certain to appear against him,
and he was wise so to do, for if it had
—it would have been worse for him.
But I was going to tell you the story,
Signor.”</P>
<P>“What reasons were there for be∣lieving
this was an agent of the Baróne
di Cambrusca, friend?”</P>
<P>“I thought you wished to hear the story,
Signor.”</P>
<P>“In good time; but first what were
your reasons?”</P>
<P>“One of them is enough, Signor,
and if you would only have let me; gone
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
straight on with the story, you would
have found it out by this time, Signor.”</P>
<P>Schedoni frowned, but did not other∣wise
reprove the impertinence of the
speech.</P>
<P>“It was reason enough, Signor, to
my mind,” continued the peasant, “that
it was such a crime as nobody but the
Baróne di Cambrusca could have com∣mitted;
there was nobody wicked enough,
in our parts, to have done it but him.
Why is not this <HI>reason</HI> enough, Signor?
What makes you look at me so? why
the Baróne himself could hardly have
looked worse, if I had told him as much!”</P>
<P>“Be less prolix,” said the Confessor,
in a restrained voice.</P>
<P>“Well then, Signor, to begin at the
beginning. It is a good many years ago
that Marco came first to our town. Now
the story goes, that one stormy night—”</P>
<P>“You may spare yourself the trouble
of relating the story,” said Schedoni,
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
abruptly, “Did you ever see the Ba∣róne
you was speaking of, friend?”</P>
<P>“Why did you bid me tell it, Sig∣nor,
since you know it already! I have
been here all this while, just a-going to
begin it, and all for nothing!”</P>
<P>“It is very surprising,” resumed the
artful Schedoni, without having noticed
what had been said, “that if this Spa∣latro
was known to be the villain you
say he is, not any step should have been
taken to bring him to justice! how hap∣pened
that? But, perhaps, all this story
was nothing more than a report.”</P>
<P>“Why, Signor, it was every body's
business, and nobody's, as one may say;
then, besides, nobody could prove what
they had heard, and though every body
believed the story just the same as if they
had seen the whole, yet that, they said,
would, not do in law, but they should
be made to prove it. Now, it is not one
time in ten that any thing can be proved,
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
Signor, as you well know, yet we none
of us believe it the less for that!”</P>
<P>“So, then, you would have had this
man punished for a murder, which, pro∣bably,
he never committed!” said the
Confessor.</P>
<P>“A murder!” repeated the peasant.</P>
<P>Schedoni was silent, but, in the next
instant, said, “Did you not say it was
a murder?”</P>
<P>“I have not told you so, Signor!</P>
<P>“What was the crime, then?” re∣sumed
Schedoni, after another momentary
pause, you said it was atrocious, and what
more so than—murder?” His lip quivered
as he pronounced the last word.</P>
<P>The peasant made no. reply, but re∣mained
with his eyes fixed upon the Con∣fessor,
and, at length, repeated, “Did I
say it was murder, Signor?”</P>
<P>“If it was not that, say what it was,”
demanded the Confessor, haughtily; “but
let it be in two words.”</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60"/>
“As if a story could be told in two
words, Signor!”</P>
<P>“Well, well, be brief.”</P>
<P>“How can I, Signor, when the story
is so long!”</P>
<P>“I will waste no more time,” said Sche∣doni,
going.</P>
<P>“Well, Signor, I will do my best
to make it short. It was one stormy night
in December, that Marco Torma had been
out fishing. Marco, Signor, was an old
man that lived in our town when I was a
boy; I can but just remember him, but
my father knew him well, and loved old
Marco, and used often to say—</P>
<P>“To the story!” said Schedoni.</P>
<P>“Why I am telling it, Signor, as
fast as I can. This old Marco did not
live in our town, at the time it happened,
but in some place, I have forgot the name
of it, near the sea shore. What can the
name be! it is something like—”</P>
<P>“Well, what happened to this old
dotard?”</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61"/>
“You are out there, Signor, he was no
old dotard; but you shall hear. At that
time, Signor, Marco lived in this place
that I have forgot the name of, and was
a fisherman, but better times turned up
afterwards, but that is neither here nor
there, Old Marco had been out fishing;
it was a stormy night, and he was glad
enough to get on shore, I warrant. It
was quite dark, as dark, Signor, I sup∣pose,
as it was last night, and he was
making the best of his way, Signor, with
some fish along the shore, but it being so
dark, he lost it notwithstanding. The
rain beat, and the wind blew, and he
wandered about a long while, and could
fee no light, nor hear any thing, but the
surge near him, which sometimes seemed
as if it was coming to wash him away.
He got as far off it as he could, but he
knew there were high rocks, over the
beach, and he was afraid he should
run his head against them, if he went
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
too far, I suppose. However, at last,
he went up close to them, and as he got
a little shelter, he resolved to try no fur∣ther
for the present. I tell it you, Sig∣nor,
just as my father told it me, and he
had it from the old man himself,”</P>
<P>“You need not be so particular,” re∣plied
the Confessor; “speak to the point.”</P>
<P>“Well, Signor, as old Marco lay snug
under the rocks, he thought he heard
somebody coming, and he lifted up his
head, I warrant, poor old soul! as if he
could have seen who it was; however, he
could hear, though it was so dark, and
he heard the steps coming on; but he said
nothing yet, meaning to let them, come
close up to him, before he discovered him∣self.
Presently he sees a little moving
light, and it comes nearer and nearer, till
it was just opposite to him, and then he
saw the shadow of a man on the ground,
and then spied the man himself, with a
dark lanthorn, passing along the beach.”</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63"/>
“Well, well, to the purpose,” said
Schedoni.</P>
<P>“Old Marco, Signor, my father says,
was never stout-hearted, and he took it
into his head this might be a robber, be∣cause
he had the lanthorn, though, for
that matter, he would have been glad
enough of a lanthorn himself, and so he
lay quiet. But, presently, he was in a
rare fright, for the man stopped to rest the
load he had upon his back, on a piece of
rock near him, and old Marco saw him
throw off a heavy sack, and heard him
breathe hard, as if he was hugely tired.
I tell it, Signer, just as my father does,”</P>
<P>“What was in the sack?” said Sche∣doni,
coolly.</P>
<P>“All in good time Signor;” perhaps
old Marco never sound out; but you shall
hear. He was afraid, when he saw the
sack, to stir a limb, for he thought it held
booty. But, presently, the man, without
saying a word, heaved it on his shoulders
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
again, and staggered away with it along
the beach, and Marco saw no more of
him.”</P>
<P>“Well! what has he to do with your
story, then?” said the Confessor, “Was
this Spalatro?”</P>
<P>“All in good time, Signer; you put
me out. When the storm was down, a
little, Marco crept out, and, thinking
there must be a village, or a. hamlet, or a
cottage, at no great distance, since this
man had passed, he thought he would try
a little further. He had better have staid
where he was, for he wandered about a
long while, and could see nothing, and
what was worse, the storm came on louder
than before and he had no rocks to shelter
him now. While he was in this quan∣dary,
he sees a light at a distance and
it came into, his head this might be the
lantern again, but be determined to go
on notwithstanding, for if it was, he
could stop short, and if it was not he
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
should get shelter, perhaps; so on he
went, and I suppose I should have done
the same, Signor.”</P>
<P>“Well! this history never will have an
end!” said Schedoni.</P>
<P>“Well! Signor, he had not gone far
when he sound out that it was no lantern,
but a light at a window. When he came
up to the house he knocked softly at the
door, but nobody came.”</P>
<P>“What house?” inquired the Confessor,
sharply.</P>
<P>“The rain beat hard, Signor, and I
warrant poor old Marco waited a long
time before he knocked again, for he was
main patient, Signor. O! how I have
seen him listen to a story, let it be ever so
long!”</P>
<P>“I have need of his patience!” said
Schedoni.</P>
<P>“When he knocked again, Signor,
the door gave way a little, and he sound
it was open, and so, as nobody came, he
thought fit to walk in of his own accord.”</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66"/>
“The dotard! what business had he to
be so curious?” exclaimed Schedoni.</P>
<P>“Curious! Signor, he only sought
shelter! He stumbled about in the dark,
for a good while, and could find nobody,
nor make nobody hear, but, at last, he
came to a room where there was some fire
not quite out, upon the hearth, and he
went up to it, to warm himself, till some∣body
should come.”</P>
<P>“What! was there nobody in the
house?” said the Confessor.</P>
<P>“You shall hear, Signor. He had not
been there, he said, no, he was sure, not
above two minutes, when he heard, a
strange sort of a noise in the very room
where he was, but the fire gave such a poor
light, he could not see whether any body
was there.”</P>
<P>“What was the noise?”</P>
<P>“You put me out, Signor. He said
he did not much like it, but what could
he do! So he stirred up the fire, and tried
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
to make it blaze a little, but it was as
dusky as ever; he could see nothing.
Presently, however, he heard somebody
coming, and saw a light, and then a man
coming towards the room where he was,
so he went up to him to ask shelter.”</P>
<P>“Who was this man?” said Schedoni.</P>
<P>“Ask shelter. He says the man, when
he came to the door of the room, turned
as white as a sheet, as well he might, to
see a stranger, to find a stranger there, at
that time of the night. I suppose I should
have done the fame myself. The man
did not seem very willing to let him slay,
but asked what he did there, and such
like; but the storm was very loud, and so
Marco did not let a little matter daunt
him, and, when he shewed the man
what fine fish he had in his basket, and
said he was welcome to it, he seemed more
willing.”</P>
<P>“Incredible!” exclaimed Schedoni,
“the blockhead!”</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68"/>
“He had wit enough for that matter,
Signor; Marco says he appeared to be
main hungry—”</P>
<P>“Is that any proof of his wit?” said the
Confessor, peevishly.</P>
<P>“You never will let me finish, Signor;
main hungry; for he put more wood on
the fire directly, to dress some of the fish.
While he was doing this, Marco says his
heart, somehow, misgave him, that this
was the man he saw on the beach, and he
looked at him pretty hard, till the other
asked him, crossly, what he stared at him
so for; but Marco took care not to tell.
While he was busy making ready the fish,
however, Marco had an opportunity of
eying him the more, and every time the
man looked round the room, which hap∣pened
to be pretty often, he had a notion
it was the same.”</P>
<P>“Well, and if it was the same,” said
Schedoni.</P>
<P>“But when Marco happened to spy the
sack, lying in a corner, he had no doubt
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
about the matter. He says his heart then
misgave him sadly, and he wished hlmself
safe out of the house, and determined, in
his own mind, to get away as soon as he
could, without letting the man suspect what
he thought of him. He now guessed,
too, what made the man look round the
room so often, and, though Marco thought
before it was to find out if he had
brought any body with him, he now be∣lieved
it was to see whether his treasure
was safe.”</P>
<P>“Aye, likely enough,” observed Schedoni.</P>
<P>“Well, old Marco sat not much at
his ease, while the fish was preparing,
and thought it was “out of the fryingpan
into the fire” with him; but what could
he do?”</P>
<P>“Why get up and walk away, to be
sure,” said the Confessor, “as I shall do,
if your story lasts much longer.”</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70"/>
“You shall hear, Signor; he would
have done so, if he had thought this man
would have let him, but—”</P>
<P>“Well, this man was Spalatro, I sup∣pose,”
said Schedoni, impatiently, “and
this was the house on the shore you for∣merly
mentioned.”</P>
<P>“How well you have guessed it,
Signor! though to say truth, I have been
expecting you to find it out for this half
hour.”</P>
<P>Schedoni did not like the significant
look, which the pcasant assumed while he
said this, but he bade him proceed.</P>
<P>“At first, Signor, Spalatro hardly spoke
a word, but he came to by degrees,
and by the time the fish was nearly
ready, he was talkative enough.”</P>
<P>Here the Confessor rose, with some emo∣tion,
and paced the room.</P>
<P>“Poor old Marco, Signor, began to
think better of him, and when he heard
the rain at the casements, he was loath to
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
think of stirring. Presently Spalatro went
out of the room for a plate to eat the fish
on.—”</P>
<P>“Out of the room?” said Schiedoni,
and checked his steps.</P>
<P>“Yes, Signor, but he took care to
carry the light with him. However,
Marco, who had a deal of curiosity
To—”</P>
<P>“Yes, he appears to have had a great
deal, indeed!” said the Confessor, and
turning away, renewed his pace.</P>
<P>“Nay, Signor, I am not come to that
yet, he has shewn none, yet;—a great
deal of curiosity to know what was in
the sack, before he consented to let him∣self
stay much longer, thought this a
good opportunity for looking, and as the
fire was now pretty bright, he determined
to see. He went up to the sack, there∣fore,
Signor, and tried to lift it, but it
was too heavy for him though it did not
seem full.”</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72"/>
Schedoni again checked his steps, and
stood fixed before the peasant.</P>
<P>“He raised it, however, a little, Signor,
but it fell from his hands, and with such
a heavy weight upon the floor, that he
was sure it held no common booty. Just
then, he says, he thought he heard Spala∣tro
coming, and the sound of the sack
was enough to have frightened him, and
so Marco quitted it; but he was mis∣taken,
and he went to it again. But you
don't seem to hear me, Signor, for you
look as you do when you are in those
quandaries, so busy a-thinking, and
I—”</P>
<P>“Proceed,” said Schedoni, sternly, and
renewed his steps, “I hear you.”</P>
<P>“Went to it again,”—resumed the
peasant, cautiously taking up the story at
the last words he had dropped. “He un∣tied
the stiring, Signor, that held the sack,
and opened the cloth a little way, but
think, Signor, what he must have thought,
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
when he felt—cold flesh! O, Signor!
and when he saw by the light of the fire,
the face of a corpse within! O, Signor!”—</P>
<P>The peasant, in the eagerness with
which he related this circumstance, had
followed Schedoni to the other end of
the chamber, and he now took hold of
his garment, as if to secure his attention to
the remainder of the story. The Con∣fessor,
however, continued his steps, and
the peasant kept pace with him, still
loosely holding his garment.</P>
<P>“Marco,” he resumed, “was so ter∣rified,
as my father says, that he hardly
knew where he was, and I warrant, if
one could have seen him, he looked as
white, Signor, as you do now.”</P>
<P>The Confessor abruptly withdrew his
garment from the peasant's grasp, and
said, in an inward voice, “If I am
shocked at the mere mention of such a
spectacle, no wonder he was, who be∣held
it!” After the pause of a moment,
he added,—“But what followed?”</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74"/>
“Marco says he had no power to tie
up the cloth again, Signor, and when he
came to his thoughts, his only fear was,
lest Spalatro should return, though he had
hardly been gone a minute, before he
could get out of the house, for he cared
nothing about the storm now. And sure
enough he heard him coming, but he
managed to get out of the room, into a
passage another way from that Spalatro
was in. And luckily, too, it was the same
passage he had come in by, and it led
him out of the house. He made no more
ado, but ran straight off, without stop∣ping
to chuse which way, and many perils
and dangers he got into among the woods,
that night, and—”</P>
<P>“How happened it, that this Spalatro
was not taken up, after this discovery!”
said Schedoni. “What was the con∣sequence
of it?”</P>
<P>“Why, Signor, old Marco had like to
have caught his death that night; what
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
with the wet, and what with the fright,
he was laid up with a fever, and was
light-headed, and raved of such strange
things, that people would not believe
any thing he said when he came to his
senses.”</P>
<P>“Aye,” said Schedoni, “the narrative
resembles a delirious dream, more than
a reality; I perfectly accord with them in
their opinion of this feverish old man.”</P>
<P>“But you shall hear, Signor; after a
while they began to think better of it,
and there was some stir made about it;
but what could poor folks do, for nothing
could be proved! The house was searched,
but the man was gone, and nothing
could be sound! From that time the place
was shut up; till many years after, this
Spalatro appeared, and old Marco then
said He was pretty sure he was the man,
but he could not swear it, and so nothing
could be done.”</P>
<P>“Then it appears, after all, that you
are not certain that this long history be∣longs
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
to this Spalatro!” said the Con∣fessor;
“nay, not even that the history
itself is any thing more than the vision of
a distempered brain!”</P>
<P>“I do not know, Signor, what you
may call certain; but I know what we all
believe. But the strangest part of the
story is to come yet, and that which no∣body
would believe, hardly, if—”</P>
<P>“I have heard enough,” said Sche∣doni,
“I will hear no more!”</P>
<P>“Well but, Signor, I have not told
you half yet; and I am sure when I heard
it myself, it so terrified me.”</P>
<P>“I have listened too long to this idle
history,” said the Confessor, “there seems
to be no rational foundation for it. Here
is what I owe you; you may depart.”</P>
<P>“Well, Signor, 'tis plain you know
the rest already, or you never would go
without it. But you don't know, per∣haps,
Signor, what an unaccountable—I
am sure it made my hair stand on end to
hear of it, what an unaccountable—”</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="77"/>
“I will hear no more of this absur∣dity,”
interrupted Schedoni, with stern∣ness.
“I reproach myself for having
listened so long to such a gossip's tale,
and have no further curiosity concerning
it. You may withdraw; and bid the host
attend me.”</P>
<P>“Well, Signor, if you are so easily
satisfied,” replied the peasant, with disap∣pointment,
“there is no more to be said,
but—”</P>
<P>“You may stay, however, while I
caution you,” said Schedoni, “how you
pass the villa, where this Spalatro may
yet linger, for, though I can only smile
at the story you have related—”</P>
<P>“Related, Signor! why I have not
told it half; and if you would only please
to be patient—”</P>
<P>“Though I can only smile at that
simple narrative,”—repeated Schedoni in
a louder tone.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78"/>
“Nay, Signor, for that matter, you can
srown at it too, as I can testify,” muttered
the guide.</P>
<P>“Listen to me!” said the Confessor, in
a yet more insisting voice. “I say, that
though I give no credit to your curious
history, I think this same Spalatro appears
to be a desperate fellow, and, therefore,
I would have you be on your guard. If
you see him, you may depend upon it,
that he will attempt your life in revenge
of the injury I have done him. I give
you, therefore, in addition to your trom∣bone,
this stiletto to defend you.”</P>
<P>Schedoni, while he spoke, took an in∣strument
from his bosom, but it was not
the one he usually wore, or, at least, that
he was seen to wear. He delivered it to
the peasant, who received it with a kind
of stupid surprise, and then gave him,
some directions as to the way in which it
should be managed.</P>
<P>“Why, Signor,” said the man, who
had listened with much attention, “I am
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
kindly obliged to you for thinking about
me, but is there any thing in this stiletto
different from others, that it is to be used
so?”</P>
<P>Schedoni looked gravely at the peasant
for an instant, and then replied, “Cer∣tainly
not, friend, I would only instruct
you to use it to the best advantage;—
farewell!”</P>
<P>“Thank you kindly, Signor, but—but
I think I have no need of it, my trombone
is enough for me.”</P>
<P>“This will defend you more adroitly,”
replied Schedoni, refusing to take back
the stiletto, “and moreover, while you
were loading the trombone, your adver∣sary
might use his poniard to advantage.
Keep it, therefore, friend; it will protect
you better than a dozen trombones. Put
it up.”</P>
<P>Perhaps it was Schedoni's particular
look, more than his argument, that con∣vinced
the guide of the value of his gift;
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
he received it submissively, though with a
stare of stupid surprise; probably it had
been better, if it had been suspicious sur∣prise.
He thanked Schedoni again, and
was leaving the room, when the Confessor
called out, “Send the landlord to me
immediately, I shall set off for Rome
without delay!”</P>
<P>“Yes, Signor,” replied the peasant,
“you are at the right place, the road parts
here; but I thought you was going for
Naples!”</P>
<P>“For Rome,” said Schedoni.</P>
<P>“For Rome, Signor! Well, I hope
you will get safe, Signor, with all my
heart!” said the guide, and quitted the
chamber.</P>
<P>While this dialogue had been passing
between Schedoni and the peasant, Ellena,
in solitude, was considering on the means
of prevailing with the Confessor to allow
her to return either to Altieri, or to the
neighbouring cloister of “<HI>Our Lady of
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
Pity,</HI>” instead of placing her at a distance
from Naples, till he should think proper
to acknowledge her. The plan, which he
had mentioned, seemed to her long-har∣rassed
mind to exile her forever from happi∣ness.
and all that was dear to her affections;
it appeared like a second banishment to
San S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efano. and every abbess, except
that of the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI> came to her
imagination in the portraiture of an in∣exorable
jailor. While this subject en∣gaged
her, she was summoned to attend
Schedoni, whom she found impatient to
enter the carriage, which at this town they
had been able to procure. Ellena, on
looking out for the guide, was informed
that he had already set off for his home,
a circumstance, for the suddenness of
which she knew not how to account.</P>
<P>The travellers immediately proceeded on
their journey; Schedoni, reflecting on the
late conversation, said little, and Ellena
read not in his countenance any thing that
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
might encourage her to introduce the
subject of her own intended solicitation.
Thus separately occupied, they advanced,
during some hours, on the road to Naples,
for thither Schedoni had designed to go,
notwithstanding his late assertion to the
guide, whom it appears, for whatever
reason, he was anxious to deceive, as to
the place of his actual residence.</P>
<P>They stopped to dine at a town of some
consideration, and, when Ellena heard
the Confessor inquire concerning the nu∣merous
convents it contained, she per∣ceived
that it was necessary for her no
longer to defer her petition. She there∣fore
represented immediately what must
be the forlornness of her state, and the
anxiety of her mind, if she were placed
at a distance from the scenes and the
people, which affection and early habit
seemed to have consecrated; especially at
this time, when her spirits had scarcely
recovered from the severe pressure of long-suffering,
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
and when to soothe and renovate
them, not only quiet, but the consciousness
of security, were necessary; a consciousness
which it was impossible, and especially so
after her late experience, that she could
acquire among strangers, till they should
cease to be such.</P>
<P>To these pleadings Schedoni thought∣fully
attended, but the darkness of his
aspect did not indicate that his com∣passion
was touched; and Ellena pro∣ceeded
to represent, secondly, that which,
had she been more artful, or less disdain∣ful
of cunning, she would have urged the
first. As it was, she had begun with the
mention of circumstances, which, though
the least likely to prevail with Schedoni,
she felt to be most important to herself;
and she concluded with representing that,
which was most interesting to him. Ellena
suggested, that her residence in the neigh∣bourhood
of Altieri might be so managed,
as that his secret would be as effectually
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
preserved, as if she were at an hundred
miles from Naples.</P>
<P>It may appear extraordinary, that a
man of Schedoni's habitual coolness, and
exact calculation, should have suffered
fear, on this occasion, to obscure his per∣ceptions;
and this instance strongly proved
the magnitude of the cause, which could
produce so powerful an effect. While he
now listened to Ellena, he began to per∣ceive
circumstances that had eluded his
own observation; and he, at length, ac∣knowledged,
that it might be safer to per∣mit
her to return to the Villa Altieri, and
that she should from thence go, as she had
formerly intended, to the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI>
than to place her in any convent, however
remote, where it would, be necessary for
himself to introduce her. His only re∣maining
objection to the neighbourhood
of Naples, now rested on the chance it
would offer the Marchesa di Vivaldi of dis∣covering
Ellena's abode, before he should
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
judge it convenient to disclose to her his
family; and his knowledge of the Mar∣chesa
justified his most horrible suspicion,
as to the consequence of such a premature
discovery.</P>
<P>Something, however, it appeared, must
be risked in any situation he might
chuse for Ellena; and her residence at
the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI> a large convent,
well secured, and where, as she had
been known to them from her infancy,
the abbess and the sisters might be sup∣posed
to be not indifferent concerning
her welfare, seemed to promise security
against any actual violence from the
malice of the Marchesa; against her
artful duplicity every place would be
almost equally insufficient. Here, as
Ellena would appear in the character she
had always been known in, no curiosity
could be excited, or suspicion awakened,
as to her family; and here, therefore,
Schedoni's secret would more probably be
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
preserved, than elsewhere. As this was,
after all, the predominant subject of his
anxiety, to which, however unnatural it
may seem, even the safety of Ellena was
secondary, he finally determined, that
she should return to the <HI>Santa della Pi∣eta;</HI>
and she thanked him almost with
tears, for a consent which she received
as a generous indulgence, but which was
in reality little more than an effect of
selfish apprehension.</P>
<P>The remainder of the journey, which
was of some days, passed without any
remarkable occurrence: Schedoni, with
only short intervals, was still enveloped,
in gloom and silence; and Ellena, with
thoughts engaged by the one subject of
her interest, the present situation and
circumstances of Vivaldi, willingly sub∣mitted
to this prolonged stillness.</P>
<P>As, at length, she drew near Naples,
her emotions became more various and
powerful; and, when she distinguished
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
the top of Vesuvius peering over every
intervening summit, she wept as her ima∣gination
charactered all the well-known
country it overlooked. But when, hav∣ing
reached an eminence, that scenery
was exhibited to her senses, when the Bay
of Naples, stretching into remotest distance,
was spread out before her; when every
mountain of that magnificent horizon,
which enclosed her native landscape, that
country which she believed Vivaldi to
inhabit, stood unfolded, how affecting,
how overwhelming were her sensations!
Every object seemed to speak of her
home, of Vivaldi, and of happiness that
was passed! and so exquisitely did regret
mingle with hope, the tender grief of
remembrance with the interest of expec∣tation,
that it were difficult to say which
prevailed.</P>
<P>Her expressive countenance disclosed to
the Confessor the course of her thoughts
and of her feelings, feelings which, while
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
he contemned, he believed he perfectly
comprehended, but of which, having
never in any degree experienced them, he
really understood nothing. The callous
Schedoni, by a mistake not uncommon,
especially to a mind of his character,
substituted words for truths; not only
confounding the limits of neighbouring
qualities, but mistaking their very prin∣ciples.
Incapable of perceiving their
nice distinctions, he called the persons
who saw them, merely fanciful; thus
making his very incapacity an argument
for his superior wisdom. And, while he
confounded delicacy of feeling with fa∣tuity
of mind, taste with caprice, and
imagination with error, he yielded, when
he most congratulated himself on his sa∣gacity,
to illusions not less egregious, be∣cause
they were less brilliant, than those
which are incident to sentiment and feel∣ing</P>
<P>The better to escape observation, Sche∣doni
had contrived not to reach Naples
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
till the close of evening, and it was en∣tirely
dark before the carriage stopped at
the gate of the Villa Altieri. Ellena, with
a mixture of melancholy and satisfaction,
viewed, once more, her long-deserted
home, and while she waited till a servant
should open the gate, remembered how
often she had thus waited when there was
a beloved friend within, to welcome her
with smiles, which were now gone for
ever. Beatrice, the old housekeeper, at
length, however, appeared, and received
her with an affection as sincere, if not as
strong, as that of the relative for whom
she mourned.</P>
<P>Here Schedoni alighted, and, having
dismissed the carriage, entered the house,
for the purpose of relinquishing also. his
disguise, and resuming his monk's habit.
Before he departed, Ellena ventured to
mention Vivaldi, and to express her wish
to hear of his exact situation; but,
though Schedoni was too well enabled to
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
inform her of it, the policy which had
hitherto kept him silent on this subject
still influenced him; and he replied only,
that if he should happen to learn the
circumstances of his condition, she should
not remain ignorant of them.</P>
<P>This assurance revived Ellena, for two
reasons; it afforded her a hope of relief
from her present uncertainty, and it also
seemed to express an approbation of the
object of her affection, such as the Con∣fessor
had never yet disclosed. Schedoni
added, that he should see her no more,
till he thought proper to acknowledge
her for his daughter; but that, if cir∣cumstances
made it necessary, he should,
in the mean time, write to her; and he
now gave her a direction by which to
address him under a fictitious name, and
at a place remote from his convent. El∣lena,
though assured of the necessity for
this conduct, could not yield to such dis∣guise,
without an aversion that was
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
strongly expressed in her manner, but of
which Schedoni took no notice. He bade
her, as she valued her existence, watch∣fully
to preserve the secret of her birth;
and to waste not a single day at Villa Al∣tieri,
but to retire to the <HI>Santa della Pieta;</HI>
and these injunctions were delivered in a
manner so solemn and energetic, as not
only deeply to impress upon her mind the
necessity of fulfilling them, but to excite
some degree of amazement.</P>
<P>After a short and general direction re∣specting
her further conduct, Schedoni
bade her farewell, and, privately quitting
the villa, in his ecclesiastical dress, re∣paired
to the Dominican convent, which
he entered as a brother returned from a
distant pilgrimage. He was received as
usual by the society, and found himself,
once more, the austere father Schedoni
of the Spirito Santo.</P>
<P>The cause of his first anxiety was the
necessity for justifying himself to the
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
Marchesa di Vivaldi, for ascertaining
how much he might venture to reveal of
the truth, and for estimating what would
be her decision, were she informed of the
whole. His second step would be to ob∣tain
the release of Vivaldi; and, as his
conduct in this instance would be regu∣lated,
in a great degree, by the result of
his conference with the Marchesa, it
would be only the second. However,
painful it must be to Schedoni to meet
her, now that he had discovered the
depth of the guilt, in which she would
have involved him, he determined to seek
this eventful conference on the following
morning: and he passed this night partly
in uneasy expectation of the approaching
day, but chiefly in inventing circum∣stances
and arranging arguments, that
might bear him triumphantly towards the
accomplishment of his grand design.</P>

<P>SCHEDONI, on his way to the Vivaldi
palace, again reviewed and arranged every
argument, or rather. specious circum∣stance,
which might induce the Marche∣sa's
consent to the nuptials he so much de∣sired;
His family was noble, though no
longer wealthy, and he believed that as
the seeming want of descent had hitherto
been the chief objection to Ellena, the
Marchesa might be prevailed with to
overlook the wreck of his fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94"/>
At the palace he was told, that the
Marchesa was at one of her villas on the
bay; and he was too anxious not to
follow her thither immediately. This de∣lightful
residence was situated on an airy
promontory, that overhung the water,
and was nearly embosomed among the
woods, that spread far along the heights,
and descended, with great pomp of foli∣age
and colouring, to the very margin of
the waves. It seemed scarcely possible
that misery could inhabit so enchanting
an abode; yet the Marchesa was wretched
amidst all these luxuries of nature and
art, which would have perfected the hap∣piness
of an innocent mind. Her heart
was possessed by evil passions, and all her
perceptions were distorted and discoloured
by them, which, like a dark magician,
had power to change the fairest scenes
into those of gloom and desolation.</P>
<P>The servants had orders to admit father
Schedoni at all times, and he was shewn
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
into a saloon, in which the Marchesa was
alone. Every object in this apartment
announced taste, and even magnificence.
The hangings were of purple and gold;
the vaulted cieling was designed by one
of the first painters of the Venetian
school; the marble statues that adorned
the recesses were not less exquisite, and
the whole symmetry and architecture, airy,
yet rich; gay, yet chastened; resembled
the palace of a fairy, and seemed to pos∣sess
almost equal fascinations. The lat∣tices
were thrown open, to admit the pro∣spect,
as well as the air loaded with fra∣grance
from an orangery, that spread before
them. Losty palms and plantains threw
their green and refreshing tint over the
windows, and on the lawn that sloped to
the edge of the precipice, a shadowy
perspective, beyond which appeared the
ample waters of the gulf, where the light
fails of feluccas, and the spreading canvas
of larger vessels, glided upon the scene
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
and passed away, as in a camera obscura.
Vesuvius and the city of Naples were seen
on the coast beyond,- with many a bay
and lofty cape of that long tract of bold
and gaily-coloured scenery, which ex∣tends
toward Cape Campanella, crowned
by fading ranges of mountains, lighted
up with, all the magic of Italian sunshine.
The Marchesa reclined on a sofa before
an open lattice; her eyes were fixed up∣on
the prospect without, but her attention
was wholly occupied by the visions that
evil passions painted to her imagination.
On her still beautiful features was the
languor of discontent and indisposition;
and, though her manners, like her dress,
displayed the elegant negligence of the
graces, they concealed the movements of
a careful, and even a tortured heart. On
perceiving Schedoni, a faint smile light∣ened
upon her countenance, and she held
forth her hand to him; at the touch of
which he shuddered.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="97"/>
“My good father, I rejoice to see
you,” said the Marchesa; “I have felt
the want of your conversation much,
and at this moment of indisposition espe∣cially.”</P>
<P>She waved the attendant to withdraw;
while Schedoni, stalking to a window,
could with difficulty conceal the pertur∣bation
with which he now, for the first
time, consciously beheld the willing de∣stroyer
of his child. Some farther com∣pliment
from the Marchesa recalled him;
he soon recovered all his address, and ap∣proaching
her, said,</P>
<P>“Daughter! you always send me
away a worse Dominican than I come;
I approach you with humility, but de∣part
elated with pride, and am obliged
to suffer much from self-infliction before
I can descend to my proper level.”</P>
<P>After some other flatteries had been
exchanged, a silence of several moments
followed, during which neither of the
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
parties seemed to have sufficient courage
to introduce the subjects that engaged
their thoughts, subjects upon which their
interests were now so directly and unex∣pectedly
opposite. Had Schedoni been
less occupied by his own feelings, he
might have perceived the extreme agita∣tion
of the Marchesa, the tremor of her
nerves, the faint flush that crossed her
cheek, the wanness that succeeded, the
languid movement of her eyes, and the
laborious sighs that interrupted her breath∣ing,
while she wished, yet dared not ask,
whether Ellena was no more, and averted
her regards from him, whom she almost
believed to be a murderer.</P>
<P>Schedoni, not less affected, though ap∣parently
tranquil, as sedulously avoided
the face of the Marchesa, whom he con∣sidered
with a degree of contempt almost
equal to his indignation: his feelings had
reversed, for the present, all his opinions
on the subject of their former arguments,
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
and had taught him, for once, to think
justly. Every moment of silence now
increased his embarrassment, and his re∣luctance
even to name Ellena. He
feared to tell that she lived, yet despised
himself for suffering such fear, and shud∣dered
at a recollection of the conduct,
which had made any assurance concerning
her. life necessary. The infinuations,
that he had discovered her family to be
such as would not degrade that of the
Marchesa, he knew not how to intro∣duce
with such delicacy of gradation as
might win upon the jealousy of her
pride, and soothe her disappointment; and
he was still meditating how he might
lead to this subject, when the Marchesa
herself broke the silence.</P>
<P>“Father” she said, with a sigh, “I
always look to you for consolation, and
am seldom disappointed. You are too
well acquainted with the anxiety which
has long oppressed me; may I understand
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
that the cause of it is removed?” She
paused, and then added, “May I hope
that my son will no longer be led from
the observance of his duty?”</P>
<P>Schedoni, with his eyes fixed on the
ground, remained silent, but, at length,
said, “The chief occasion of your anx∣iety
is certainly removed;”—and he was
again silent.</P>
<P>“How!” exclaimed she Marchesa,
with the quick-sightedness of suspicion,
while all her dissimulation yielded to the
urgency of her fear, “Have you failed?
Is she not dead?”</P>
<P>In the earnestness of the question, she
fixed her eyes on Schedoni's face, and,
perceiving there symptoms of extraordi∣nary
emotion, added, “Relieve me from
my apprehensions, good father, I en∣treat;
tell me that you have succeeded,
and that she has paid the debt of jus∣tice.”</P>
<P>Schedoni raised his eyes to the Mar∣chesa,
but instantly averted them; indigo∣nation
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
had lifted them, and disgust and
stifled horror turned them away. Though
very little of these feelings appeared, the
Marchesa perceived such expression as she
had never been accustomed to observe in
his countenance; and, her surprize and
impatience increasing, she once more re∣peated
the question, and with a yet more
decisive air than before.</P>
<P>“I have not failed in the grand ob∣jecct”
replied Schedoni: “Your son is
no longer in danger of forming a dis∣graceful
alliance.”</P>
<P>“In what, then, have you. failed?”
asked the Marchesa; “for I perceive
that you have not been completely suc∣cessful.”</P>
<P>“I ought not to say that I have failed
in any respect,” replied Schedoni, with
emotion, “since the honour of your
house is preserved, and—a life is
spared.”</P>
<P>His voice faultered as he pronounced
the last words, and he seemed to experi∣ence
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
again the horror of that moment,
when, with an uplifted poniard in his
grasp, he had discovered Ellena for his
daughter.</P>
<P>“Spared!” repeated the Marchesa,
doubtingly; “explain yourself, good fa∣ther!”</P>
<P>“She lives,” replied Schedoni; “but
you have nothing, therefore, to appre∣hend.”</P>
<P>The Marchesa, surprized no less by the
tone in which he spoke, than shocked at
the purport of his words, changed coun∣tenance,
while she said, impatiently—
“You speak in enigmas, father.”</P>
<P>“Lady! I speak plain truth—she
lives.”</P>
<P>“I understand that sufficiently,” said
the Marchesa; “but when you tell me,
I have nothing to apprehend—”</P>
<P>“I tell you truth, also,” rejoined the
Confessor; “and the benevolence of your
nature may be permitted to rejoice, for
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
justice no longer has forbade the exer∣cise
of mercy.”</P>
<P>“This is all very well in its place,”
said the Marchesa, betrayed by the vexa∣tion
she suffered; “such sentiments and
such compliments are like gala suits, to be
put on in fine weather. My day is
cloudy; let me have a little plain strong
sense: inform me of the circumstances
which have occasioned this change in the
course of your observations, and, good
father! be brief.”</P>
<P>Schedoni then unfolded, with his usual
art, such circumstances relative to the fa∣mily
of Ellena as he hoped would soften
the aversion of the Marchesa to the
connection, and incline her, in conside∣ration
of her son's happiness, finally to
approve it; with which disclosure he
mingled a plausible relation of the way,
in which the discovery had been made.</P>
<P>The Marchesa's patience would scarcely
await the conclusion of his narrative, or
<PB N="103" REF="104"/>
her disappointment submit to the curb of
discretion. When, at length, he had
finished his history, “Is it possible,”
said she, with fretful displeasure, “that
you have suffered yourself to be de∣ceived
by the plausibility of a girl, who
might have been expected to utter any
falshood, which should appear likely to
protect her! Has a man of your dis∣cernment
given faith to the idle and im∣probable
tale! Say, rather, father, that
your resolution failed in the critical mo∣ment,
and that you are now anxious to
form, excuses to yourself for a conduct so
pusillanimous.”</P>
<P>“I am not apt to give an easy faith to
appearances,” replied Schedoni, gravely,
“and still less, to shrink from the per∣formance
of any act, which. I judge to be
necessary and just. To the last intima∣tion,
I make no reply; it does not be∣come
my character to vindicate myself
from an implication, of falshood.”</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105"/>
The Marchesa, perceiving that her pas∣sion
had betrayed her into imprudence,
condescended to apologize for that which
she termed an effect of her extreme anx∣iety,
as to what might follow from an
act of such indiscreet indulgence; and
Schedoni as willingly accepted the apo∣logy,
each believing the assistance of the
other necessary to success.</P>
<P>Schedoni then informed her, that he
had better authority for what he had ad∣vanced
than the assertion of Ellena; and
he mentioned some circumstances, which
proved him to be more anxious for the
reputation than for the truth of his. word.
Believing that his origin was entirely un∣known
to the Marchesa, he ventured to
disclose some particulars of Ellena's fa∣mily,
without apprehending that it could
lead to a suspicion of his own.</P>
<P>“The Marchesa, though neither appeased
or convinced, commanded her feelings so
far as to appear tranquil, while the Con∣fessor
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
represented, with the most delicate
address, the unhappiness of her son, and
the satisfaction, which must finally result
to herself from an acquiescence with his
choice, since the object of it was known
to be worthy of his alliance. He added,
that, while he had believed the contrary,
he had proved himself as strenuous to
prevent, as he was now sincere in approv∣ing
their marriage; and concluded with
gently blaming her for suffering prejudice
and some remains, of resentment to ob∣scure
her excellent understanding. “Trust∣ing
to the natural clearness of your per∣ceptions,”
he added, “I doubt not that
when you have maturely considered the
subject, every, objection, will yield to a
consideration of your, son's happiness”</P>
<P>The earnestness, with which Schedoni
pleaded, for Vivaldi, excited some sur∣prize;
but the Marchesa, without conde∣scending
to reply either to his argument
or remonstrance, inquired whether El∣lena.
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
had a suspicion of the design, with
which she had been carried into the forests
of the Garganus, or concerning the iden∣tity
of her persecutor. Schedoni, imme∣diately
perceiving to what these questions
tended, replied, with the facility with
which he usually accommodated his con∣science
to his interest, that Ellena was to∣tally
ignorant as to who were her imme∣diate
persecutors, and equally unsuspi∣cious
of any other evil having been in∣tended
her, than that of a temporary con∣sinement.</P>
<P>The last assertion was admitted by the
Marchesa to be probable, till the bold∣ness
of the first made her doubt the truth
of each, and occasioned her new sur∣prize
and conjecture as to the motive;
which could induce Schedoni to venture
these untruths. She then inquired where
Ellena was now disposed of, but he had
too much prudence to disclose the place
of her; retreat, however plausible might
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
be the air with which the inquiry was
urged; and he endeavoured to call off
her attention to Vivaldi. The Confessor
did not, however, venture, at present, to
give a hint as to the pretended discovery
of his situation in the inquisition, but re∣served
to a more favourable opportunity,
such mention, together with the zealous,
offer, of his services to extricate the pri∣soner.
The Marchesa, believing that her
son was still engaged in pursuit of El∣lena,
made many inquiries concerning
him, but without expressing any solici∣tude
for his welfare; resentment appear∣ing
to be the only emotion. she retained
towards him. While Schedoni replied
with circumspection to her questions, he
urged inquiries of his own, as to the
manner in which the Marchesa endured
the long absence of Vivaldi; thus endea∣vouring
to ascertain how far he might
hereafter venture to appear in any efforts
for liberating him, and how shape his
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
conduct respecting Ellena. It seemcd
that the Marchese was not indifferent as
to his son's absence; and, though he had
at first believed the search for Ellena to
have occasioned it, other apprehensions
now disturbed him, and taught him the
feelings of a father. His numerous avo∣cations
and interests, however, seemed to
prevent such anxiety from preying upon
his mind; and, having dismissed persons
in search of Vivaldi, he passed his time
in the usual routine of company and the
court. Of the actual situation of his son
it was evident that neither he, nor the
Marchesa, had the least apprehension,
and this was a circumstance, which the
Confessor was very careful to ascertain.</P>
<P>Before he took, leave, he ventured to
renew the mention of Vivaldi's attach∣ment,
and gently to plead for him. The
Marchcsa, however, seemed inattentive
to what he represented, till, at length,
awaking form her reverie, she said—“Fa∣ther,
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
you have judged ill—,” and, be∣fore
she concluded the sentence, she re∣lapsed
again into thoughtful silence. Be∣lieving
that he anticipated her meaning,
Schedoni began to repeat his own justi∣fication
respecting his conduct towards
Ellena.</P>
<P>“You have judged erroneously, fa∣ther,”
resumed the Marchesa, with the
same considering air, “in placing the
girl in such a situation; my son cannot
fail to discover her there.”</P>
<P>“Or wherever she may be,” replied
the. Confessor, believing that he under∣stood
the Marchesa's aim. “It may not
he possible to conceal her long from his
search”</P>
<P>“The neighbourhood of Naples ought
at least to have been avoided,” observed;
the Marchesa.</P>
<P>Schedoni was silent, and she added, “So
near, also, to his own, residence! How
far is the <HI>Santa della Pieta</HI> from the Vi∣valdi
palace?”</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111"/>
Though Schedoni had thought that the
Marchesa, while displaying a pretended
knowledge of Ellena's retreat, was only
endeavouring to obtain a real one, this
mention of the place of her actual resi∣dence
shocked him; but he replied al∣most
immediately, “I am ignorant of
the distance, for, till now, I was unac∣quainted
that there is a convent of the
name you mention. It appears, how∣ever,
that this <HI>Santa della Pièta</HI> is the
place, of all other, which ought to have
been avoided. How could you suspect
me, lady, of imprudence thus extrava∣gant!”</P>
<P>While Schedoni spoke, the Marchesa.
regarded him attentively, and then re∣plied,
“I may be allowed, good father
to suspect your prudence in this instance,
since you have just given me so unequi∣vocal
a proof of it in another.”</P>
<P>She would then have changed the sub∣ject,
but Schedoni, believing this incli∣nation
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
to be the consequence of her having
assured herself, that she had actually dis∣covered
Ellena's asylum, and too reason∣ably
suspecting the dreadful use she de∣signed
to make of the discovery, endea∣voured
to unfettle her opinion, and mis∣lead
her as to the place of Ellena's abode.
He not only contradicted the fact of her
present residence at the <HI>Santa della Pièta,</HI>
but, without scruple, made a positive as∣sertion,
that, she was at a distance from
Naples, naming, at the same time, a sic∣titious
place, whose obscurity, he added,
would be the best protection from the
pursuit of Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Very, true, father,” observed the
Marchesa; “I believe that my son will
not readily discover the girl in the place
you have named.”</P>
<P>Whether the Marchesa believed Sche∣doni's
assertion or not, she expressed no
farther curiosity on the subject, and ap∣peared
considerably more tranquil than
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
before. She now chatted with ease on
general topics, while the Confessor dared
no more to urge the subject of his secret
wishes; and, having supported, for some
time, a conversation most uncongenial
with his temper, he took his leave, and
returned to Naples. On the way thither,
he reviewed, with exactness, the late be∣haviour
of the Marchesa, and the result
of this examination was a resolution—
never to renew the subject of their con∣versation,
but to solemnize, without her
consent, the nuptials of Vivaldi and El∣lena.</P>
<P>The Marchesa, meanwhile, on the
departure of Schedoni, remained in the
attitude in which he had left her, and
absorbed by the interest, which his visit
excited. The sudden change in his con∣duct
no less astonished and perplexed,
than disappointed her. She could not
explain it by the supposition of any prin∣ciple
or motive. Sometimes it occurred
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
to her, that Vivaldi had bribed him with
rich promises to promote the marriage,
which he contributed to thwart; but,
when she considered the high expecta∣tions
she had herself encouraged him to
cherish, the improbability of the conjec∣ture
was apparent. That Schedoni, from
whatever cause, was no longer to be
trusted in this business, was sufficiently
clear, but she endeavoured to console her∣self
with a hope that a more considential
person might yet be discovered. A part
of Schedoni's resolution she also adopted,
which was, never again to introduce the
subject of their late conversation. But,
while she should silently pursue her own
plans she determined to conduct her∣self
towards Schedoni in every other re∣spect,
as usual, not suffering him to sus∣pect
that she had withdrawn her consi∣dence,
but inducing him to believe that
she had relinquished all farther design
against Ellena.</P>

<L>Of rural life; or, snatch'd away by hope,</L>

<BIBL>THOMSON.</BIBL>
<P>ELLENA, obedient to the command of
Schedoni, withdrew from her home on
the day that followed her arrival there,
to the <HI>Santa della Piéta.</HI> The Superiour,
who had known her from her infancy,
and, from the acquaintance which such
long observation afforded, had both
esteemed and loved her, received Ellena
with a degree of satisfaction proportionate
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
to the concern she had suffered when in∣formed
of her disastrous removal from
the Villa Altieri.</P>
<P>Among the quiet groves of this con∣vent,
however, Ellena vainly endeavoured
to moderate her solicitude respecting the
situation of Vivaldi; for, now that she had
a respite from immediate calamity, she
thought with more intense anxiety as to
what might be his sufferings, and her fears
and impatience increased, as each day dis∣appointed
her expectation of intelligence
from Schedoni.</P>
<P>If the soothings of sympathy and the
delicate arts of benevolence could have
restored the serenity of her mind, Ellena
would now have been peaceful; for all
these were offered her by the abbess and
the sisters of the <HI>Santa della Piéta.</HI> They
were not acquainted with the cause of her
sorrow, but they perceived that she was
unhappy, and wished her to be otherwise.
The society of <HI>Our Lady of Pity,</HI> was
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
such as a convent does not often shroud;
to the wisdom and virtue of the Superiour,
the sisterhood was principally indebted for
the harmony and happiness which distin∣guished
them. This lady was a shining
example to governesses of religious houses,
and a striking instance of the influence,
which a virtuous mind may acquire over,
others, as well as of the extensive good
that it may thus diffuse. She was dignified
without haughtiness, religious without
bigotry, and mild, though decisive and
firm. She possessed penetration to dis∣cover
what was just, resolution to adhere
to it, and temper to practise it with gen∣tleness
and grace; so that even correction
from her, assumed the winning air of
courtesy: the person, whom she admo∣nished,
wept in sorrow for the offence,
instead of being secretly irritated by the
reproof, and loved her as a mother, rather
than feared her as a judge. Whatever
might be her failings, they were effectually
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
concealed by the general benevolence of
her heart, and the harmony of her mind;
a harmony, not the effect of torpid feel∣ings,
but the accomplishment of correct
and vigilant judgment. Her religion was
neither gloomy, nor bigotted; it was
the sentiment of a grateful heart offering
itself up to a Deity, who delights in the
happiness of his creatures; and she con∣formed
to the customs of the Roman
church, without supposing a faith in all of
them to be necessary to salvation. This
opinion, however, she was obliged to
conceal, left her very virtue should draw
upon her the punishment of a crime, from
some fierce ecclesiastics, who contradicted,
in their practice the very essential princi∣ples,
which the christianity they prosessed
would have taught them.</P>
<P>In her lectures to the nuns she seldom
touched upon points of faith, but ex∣plained
and enforced the moral duties,
particularly such as were most practicable
in the society to which she belonged; such
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
as tended to soften and harmonize the
affections, to impart that repose of mind,
which persuades to the practice of sisterly
kindness, universal charity, and the most
pure and elevated devotion. When she
spoke of religion, it appeared so interest∣ing,
so beautiful, that her attentive audi∣tors
revered and loved it as a friend, a re∣finer
of the heart, a sublime consoler;
and experienced somewhat of the meek.
and holy ardour, which may belong to
angelic natures.</P>
<P>The society appeared like a large family,
of which the lady abbess was the mother,
rather than an assemblage of strangers;
and particularly when gathered around
her, they listened to the evening sermen,
which she delivered with such affectionate
interest, such persuasive eloquence, and
sometimes with such pathetic energy, as
few hearts could resist.</P>
<P>She encouraged in her convent every
innocent and liberal pursuit, which might
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
sweeten the austerities of confinement, and
which were generally rendered instru∣mental
to charity. The <HI>Daughters of Pity</HI>
particularly excelled in music; not in those
difficulties of the art, which display florid
graces, and intricate execution, but in
such eloquence of found as steals upon
the heart, and awakens its sweetest and
best affections. It was probably the well-regulated
sensibility of their own minds,
that enabled these sisters to diffuse through
their strains a character of such finely∣tempered
taste, as drew crowds of visitors,
on every festival, to the church of the
<HI>Santa della Piéta.</HI></P>
<P>The local circumstances of this convent
were scarcely less agreeable than the har∣mony
of its society was interesting. These
extensive domains included olive-grounds,
vineyards, and some corn-land; a consi∣derable
tract was devoted to the pleasures
of the garden, whose groves supplied
walnuts, almonds, oranges, and citrons,
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
in abundance, and almost every kind of
fruit and flower, which this luxurious
climate nurtured. These gardens hung
upon the slope of a hill, about a mile
within the shore, and afforded extensive
views of the country round Naples, and
of the gulf. But from the terraces, which
extended along a semicircular range of
rocks, that rose over the convent, and
formed a part of the domain, the pro∣spects
were infinitely finer. They extended
on the south to the isle of Capraea, where
the gulf expands into the sea; in the
west, appeared the island of Ischia, dis∣tinguished
by the white pinnacles of the
losty mountain Epomeo; and near it Pro∣sida,
with its many-coloured cliffs, rose
out of the waves. Overlooking many
points towards Puzzuoli, the eye caught
beyond other promontories, and others
further still, to the north, a glimpse of
the sea, that bathes the now desolate shores
of Baia; with Capua, and all the towne
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
and villas, that speckle the garden-plains
between Caserta and Naples.</P>
<P>In the nearer scene were the rocky
heights of Pausilippo, and Naples itself,
with all its crowded suburbs ascending
among the hills, and mingling with vine∣yards
and overtopping cypress; the castle
of San Elmo, conspicuous on its rock,
overhanging the magnificent monastery of
the Chartreux; while in the scene below
appeared the <HI>Castel Nuovo,</HI> with its clus∣tered
towers, the long-extended Corso,
the mole, with its tall pharos, and the
harbour gay with painted shipping, and
full to the brim with the blue waters
of the bay. Beyond the hills of Naples,
the whole horizon to the north and east
was bounded by the mountains of the
Appenine, an amphitheatre proportioned
to the grandeur of the plain, which the
gulf spread out below.</P>
<P>These terraces, shaded with acacias
and plane-trees, were the favourite haunt
of Ellena. Between the opening branches,
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
she looked down upon Villa Altieri, which
brought to her remembrance the affect∣tionate
Bianchi, with all the sportive years
of her childhood; and where some of her
happiest hours had been passed in the
society of Vivaldi. Along the windings
of the coast, too, she could distinguish
many places rendered sacred by affection,
to which she had made excursions with
her lamented relative, and Vivaldi; and,
though sadness mingled with the recollec∣tions
a view of them restored, they were
precious to her heart. Here, alone and
unobserved, she frequently yielded to the
melancholy which she endeavoured to sup∣press
in society; and at other times tried
to deceive, with books and the pencil,
the lingering moments of uncertainty con∣cerning
the state of Vivaldi; for day after
day still elapsed without bringing any in∣telligence,
from Schedoni. Whenever the
late scenes connected with the discovery
of her family recurred to Ellena, she was
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
struck with almost as much amazement as
if she was gazing upon a vision, instead
of recalling realities. Contrasted with
the sober truth of her present life, the past
appeared like romance; and there were
moments when she shrunk from the rela∣tionship
of Schedoni with unconquerable
assright. The first emotions his appear∣ance
had excited were so opposite to those
of filial tenderness, that she perceived it
was now nearly impossible to love and revere
him as her father, and she endeavoured,
by dwelling upon all the obligations,
which she believed he had lately conferred
upon her, to repay him in gratitude, what
was withheld in affection.</P>
<P>In such melancholy considerations, she
often lingered under the shade of the
accacias, till the sun had sunk behind the
far distant promontory of Miseno, and the
last bell of vespers summoned her to the
convent below.</P>
<P>Among the nuns, Ellena had many
favourites, but not one that she admired
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
and loved equally with Olivia of San
Stesano, the remembrance of whom was
always accompanied with a fear left she
should have suffered from her generous
compassion, and a wish that she had taken
up her abode with the happy society of
the <HI>Daughters of Pity,</HI> instead of being
subjected to the tyranny of the abbess of
San Stefano. To Ellena, the magnificent
scenes of the <HI>Santa della Pièta</HI> seemed to
open a secure, and, perhaps, a last asylum;
for, in her present circumstances, she could
not avoid perceiving how menacing and va∣rious
were the objections to her marriage
with Vivaldi, even should Schedoni prove
propitious to it. The character of the Mar∣chesa
di Vivaldi, such as it stood unfolded
by the late occurrences, struck her with
dismay, for her designs appeared suffi∣ciently
atrocious, whether they had ex∣tended
to the utmost limit of Ellena's
suspicions, or had stopped where the af∣fected
charity of Schedoni had pointed
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
out. In either case, the pertinacity of her
aversion, and the vindictive violence of
her nature, were obvious.</P>
<P>In this view of her character, however, it
was not the inconvenience threatened to
those who might become connected with
her, that principally affected Ellena, but the
circumstance of such a woman being the
mother of Vivaldi; and, to alleviate so
afflicting a consideration, she endeavoured
to believe all the palliating suggestions of
Schedoni, respecting the Marchesa's late
intentions. But if Ellena wás grieved on
discovering crime in the character of Vival∣di's
parent, what would have been her
suffering, had she suspected the nature of
Schedoni?—what, if she had been told
that he was the adviser of the Marchesa's
plans?—if she had known that he had
been the partner of her intentional guilt?
From such suffering she was yet spared,
as well as from that, which a knowledge
of Vivaldi's present situation, and of the
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
result of Schedoni's efforts to procure a
release from the perils, among which he
had precipitated him, would have in∣flicted.
Had she known this, it is pro∣bable
that in the first despondency of her
mind, she would have relinquished what
is called the world, and sought a lasting
asylum with the society of the holy sisters.
Even as it was, she sometimes endeavoured
to look with resignation upon the events
which might render such a step desirable;
but it was an effort that seldom soothed
her even with a temporary self-delusion.
Should the veil, however, prove her final
refuge, it would be by her own choice;
for the lady abbess of the <HI>Santa della
Piéta</HI> employed no art to win a recluse,
nor suffered the nuns to seduce votaries to
the order.</P>

<BIBL>CARACTACUS.</BIBL>
<P>WHILE the late events had been passing
in the Garganus, and at Naples, Vivaldi
and his servant Paulo remained impri∣soned
in distinct chambers of the Inqui∣sition.
They were again separately in∣terrogated.
From the servant no informa∣tion
could be obtained; he asserted only his
master's innocence, without once remem∣bering
to mention his own; clamoured,
with more justness than prudence, against
the persons who had occasioned his arrest;
seriously endeavouring to convince the
inquisitors, that he himself had <HI>no other
motive</HI> in having demanded to be brought
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
to these prisons than that he might comfort
his master, he gravely remonstrated on
the injustice of separating them, adding,
that he was sure when they knew the
rights of the matter, they would order
him to be carried to the prison of Signor
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“I do assure your <HI>Serenissimo</HI> Illustris∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,”
continued Paulo, addressing the
chief inquisitor with profound gravity,
“that this is the last place I should have
thought of coming to, on any other ac∣count;
and if you will only condescend
to ask your officials, who took my master
up, they will tell you <HI>as good.</HI> They
knew well enough all along, what I
came here for, and if they had known it
would be all in vain, it would have been
but civil of them to have told me as
much, and not have brought me; for this
is the last place in the world I would
have come to, otherwise, of my own
accord.”</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="130"/>
Paulo was permitted to harangue in
his own way, because his examiners hoped
that his prolixity would be a means of
betraying circumstances connected with his
master. By this view, however, they were
misled, for Paulo, with all his simplicity
of heart, was both vigilant and shrewd in
Vivaldi's interest. But, when he per∣ceived
them really convinced, that his sole
motive for visiting the Inquisition was
that he might console his master, yet
still persisting in the resolution of se∣parately
confining him, his indignation
knew no bounds. He despised alike their
reprehension, their thundering menaces,
and their more artful exhibitions; told
them of all they had to expect both here
and hereafter, for their cruelty to his dear
master, and said they might do what they
would with him; he desied, them to make
him more miserable than he was.</P>
<P>It was not without difficulty that he
was removed from the chamber; where
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
he left his examiners in a state of astonish∣ment
at his rashness, and indignation of
his honesty, such as they had, probably,
never experienced before.</P>
<P>When Vivaldi was again called up to
the table of the Holy Office, he under∣went
a longer examination than on a for∣mer
occasion. Several inquisitors attended,
and every art was employed to induce him
to confess crimes, of which he was sus∣pected,
and to draw from him a discovery
of others, which might have eluded even
suspicion. Still the examiners cautiously
avoided informing him of the subject of the
accusation on which he had been arrested,
and it was, therefore, only on the former
assurances of the Benedictine, and the offi∣cials
in the chapel of San Sebastian, that
Vivaldi understood he was accused of hav∣ing
carried off a nun. His answers on the
present occasion were concise and firm,
and his whole deportment undaunted. He
felt less apprehension for himself, than
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
indignation of the general injustice and
cruelty, which the tribunal was permitted
to exercise upon others; and this virtuous
indignation gave a loftiness, a calm heroic
grandeur to his mind, which never, for a
moment, forsook him, except when he
conjectured what might be the sufferings
of Ellena. Then, his fortitude and mag∣nanimity
failed, and his tortured spirit rose
almost to frenzy.</P>
<P>On this, his second examination, he
was urged by the same dark questions,
and replied to them with the same open
sincerity, as during the first. Yet the
simplicity and energy of truth failed to
impress conviction on minds, which, no
longer possessing the virtue themselves,
were not competent to understand the
symptoms of it in others. Vivaldi was
again threatened with the torture, and
again dismissed to his prison.</P>
<P>On the way to this dreadful abode, a
person passed him in one of the avenues,
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
of whose air and figure he thought he had
some recollection; and, as the stranger
stalked away, he suddenly knew him to
be the prophetic monk, who had haunted
him among the ruins of Paluzzi. In the
first moment of surprize, Vivaldi lost his
presence of mind so far, that he made no
attempt to interrupt him. In the next in∣stant,
however, he paused and looked
back, with an intention of speaking; but
this mysterious person was already at the
extremity of the avenue. Vivaldi called,
and besought him to stop. Without either
speaking, or turning his head, however,
he immediately disappeared beyond a door
that opened at his approach. Vivaldi, on
attempting to take the way of the monk,
was withheld by his guards, and, when
he inquired who was the stranger he had
seen, the officials asked, in their turn,
what stranger he alluded to.</P>
<P>“He who has just passed us,” replied
Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="134"/>
The officials seemed surprized, “Your
spirits are disordered, Signor,” observed
one of them, “I saw no person pass!”</P>
<P>“He passed so closely,” said Vivaldi,
“that it was hardly possible you could
avoid feeing him!”</P>
<P>“I did not even hear a footstep!” added
the man.</P>
<P>“I do not recollect that I did,” an∣swered
Vivaldi, “but I saw his figure as
plainly as I now see your's; his black,
garments almost touched me! Was he an
inquisitor?”</P>
<P>The official appeared astonished; and,
whether his surprize was real, or affected
for the purpose of concealing his know∣ledge
of the person alluded to, his em∣barrassment
and awe seemed natural. Vi∣valdi
observed, with almost equal curiosity
and surprize, the fear which his face ex∣pressed; but perceived also, that it would
avail nothing to repeat his questions.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="135"/>
As they proceeded along the avenue, a
kind of half-stifled groan was sometimes
audible from a distance. “Whence come
those sounds?” said Vivaldi, “they strike
to my heart!”</P>
<P>“They should do so,” replied the
guard.</P>
<P>“Whence come they?” repeated Vi∣valdi,
more impatiently, and shuddering.</P>
<P>“From the place of torture,” said the official.</P>
<P>“O God! O God!” exclaimed Vivaldi,
with a deep groan.</P>
<P>He passed with hasty steps the door of
that terrible chamber, and the guard did
not attempt to stop him. The officials
had brought him, in obedience to the
customary orders they had received, within
hearing of those doleful founds, for the
purpose of impressing upon his mind the
horrors of the punishment, with which he
was threatened, and of inducing him to
confess without incurring them.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136"/>
On this same evening, Vivaldi was
visited, in his prison, by a man whom he
had never consciously seen before. He
appeared to be between forty and fifty;
was of a grave and observant physiognomy,
and of manners, which, though somewhat
austere, were not alarming. The account
he gave of himself and of his motive for
this visit, was curious. He said that
he also was a prisoner in the inquisition,
but, as the ground of accusation against
him was light, he had been favoured
so far as to be allowed some degree of
liberty within certain bounds; that, hav∣ing
heard of Vivaldi's situation, he had
asked and obtained leave to converse with
him, which he had done in compassion;
and with a desire of assuaging his suffer∣ings,
so far as an expression of sympathy
and commiseration might relieve them.</P>
<P>While he spoke, Vivaldi regarded him
with deep attention, and the improbability
that these pretensions should be true, did
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
not escape him; but the suspicion which
they occasioned he prudently concealed.
The stranger conversed on various sub∣jects.
Vivaldi's answers were cautious and
concise; but not even long pauses of
silence wearied the compassionate patience
of his visitor. Among other topics he,
at length, introduced that of religion.</P>
<P>“I have, myself, been accused of he∣resy,”
said he, “and know how to pity
others in the same situation.”</P>
<P>“It is of heresy, then, that I am ac∣cused!”
interrupted Vivaldi, “of heresy!”</P>
<P>“It availed me nothing that I asserted
my innocence,” continued the stranger,
without noticing Vivaldi's exclamation,
“I was condemned to the torture. My
sufferings were too terrible to be endured!
I confessed my offence—”</P>
<P>“Pardon me,” interrupted Vivaldi,
“but allow me to observe, that since
your sufferings were so severe, your's,
against whom the ground, of accusation
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
was light, what may be the punishment
of those, whose offences are more se∣rious?”</P>
<P>The stranger was somewhat embar∣rassed.
“My offence was slight,” he
continued, without giving a full an∣swer.</P>
<P>“Is it possible,” said Vivaldi, again in∣terrupting
him, “that heresy can be con∣sidered
as a slight offence before the tri∣bunal
of the Inquisition?”</P>
<P>“It was only of a slight degree of
heresy,” replied the visitor, reddening
with displeasure, “that I was suspected,
and—”</P>
<P>“Does then the Inquisition allow of de∣grees
in heresy?” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“I confessed my offence,” added the
stranger with a louder emphasis, and the
consequence of this confession was a re∣mission
of punishment. After a trifling
penance I shall be dismissed, and proba∣bly,
in a few days, leave the prison. Be∣fore
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
I left it, I was desirous of administer∣ing
some degree of consolation to a fellow
sufferer; if you have any friends whom
you with to inform of your situation, do
not fear to confide their names and your
message to me.”</P>
<P>The latter part of the speech was deli∣vered
in a low voice, as if the stranger
feared to be overheard. Vivaldi remained
silent, while he examined, with closer at∣tention,
the countenance of his visitor.
It was of the utmost importance to him,
that his family should be made acquainted
with his situation; yet he knew not ex∣actly
how to interpret, or to confide in
this offer. Vivaldi had heard that in∣formers
sometimes visited the prisoners,
and, under the affectation of kindness and
sympathy, drew from them a confession of
opinions, which were afterwards urged
against them; and obtained discoveries
relative to their connections and friends,
who were, by these insidious means, fre∣quently
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
involved in their destruction. Vi∣valdi,
conscious of his own innocence,
had, on his first examination, acquainted
the inquisitor with the names and residence
of his family; he had, therefore, nothing
new to apprehend from revealing them to
this stranger; but he perceived that if it
should be known he had attempted to con∣vey
a message, however concise and harm∣less,
the discovery would irritate the jea∣lous
inquisitors against him, and might be
urged as a new presumption of his guilt.
These considerations, together with the
distrust which the inconsistency of his
visitor's assertions, and the occasional em∣barrassment
of his manner, had awakened,
determined Vivaldi to resist the temptation
now offered to him; and the stranger,
having received his thanks, reluctantly
withdrew, observing, however, that should
any unforeseen circumstance detain him in
the Inquisition longer than he had reason
to expect, he should beg leave to pay him
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
another visit. In reply to this, Vivaldi
only bowed, but he remarked that the
stranger's countenance changed, and that
some dark brooding appeared to cloud his.
mind, as he quitted the chamber.</P>
<P>Several days elapsed, during which Vi∣valdi
heard no more of his new acquaint∣ance.
He was then summoned to another
examination, from which he was dismissed
as before; and some weeks of solitude and
of heavy uncertainty succeeded, after
which he was a fourth time called up to
the table of the Holy Office. It was then
surrounded by inquisitors, and a more
than usual solemnity appeared in the pro∣ceeding's.</P>
<P>As proofs of Vivaldi's innocence had
not been obtained, the suspicions of his
examiners, of course, were not removed;
and, as he persisted in denying the truth
of the charge which he understood would
be exhibited against him, and refused to
make any confession of crimes, it was or∣dered
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
that he should, within three hours,
be put to the <HI>question.</HI> Till then, Vivaldi
was once more dismissed to his prison
chamber. His resolution remained un∣shaken,
but he could not look, unmoved,
upon the horrors which might be preparing
for him. The interval of expeclation be∣tween
the sentence and the accomplish∣ment
of this preliminary punishment, was,
indeed, dreadful. The seeming ignominy
of his situation, and his ignorance as to the
degree of torture to be applied, overcame
the calmness he had before exhibited, and
as he paced his cell, cold damps, which
hung upon his forehead, betrayed the
agony of his mind. It was not long, how∣ever,
that he suffered from a sense of
ignominy; his better judgment shewed
him, that innocence cannot suffer disgrace
from any situation or circumstance, and he
once more resumed the courage and the
sirmness which belong to virtue.</P>
<P>It was about midnight, that Vivaldi
heard steps approaching, and a murmur
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
of voices at the door of his cell. He un∣derstood
these to be the persons come to
summon him to the torture. The door
was unbarred, and two men, habited in
black, appeared at it. Without speaking,
they advanced, and throwing over him a
singular kind of mantle, led him from the
chamber.</P>
<P>Along the galleries, and other avenues
through which they passed, not any person
was seen, and, by the prosound stillness
that reigned, it seemed as if death had al∣ready
anticipated his work in these regions
of horror, and had condemned, alike the
tortured and the torturer.</P>
<P>They descended to the large hall, where
Vivaldi had waited on the night of his
entrance, and thence through an avenue,
and down a long slight of steps, that led
to subterranean chambers. His conductors
did not utter a syllable during the whole
progress; Vivaldi knew too well that ques∣tions
would only subject him to greater se∣verity,
and he asked none.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144"/>
The doors, through which they passed,
regularly opened at the touch of an iron
rod, carried by one of the officials, and
without the appearance of any person.
The other man bore a torch, and the pas∣sages
were so dimly lighted, that the way
could scarcely have been found without
one. They crossed what seemed to be a
burial vault, but the extent and obscurity
of the place did not allow it to be ascer∣tained;
and, having reached an iron door,
they stopped. One of the officials struck
upon it three times with the rod, but it
did not open as the others had done.
While they waited, Vivaldi thought he
heard, from within, low intermitting
sounds, as of persons in their last extre∣mity,
but, though within, they appeared
to come from a distance. His whole
heart was chilled, not with fear, for at
that moment he did not remember him∣self,
but with horror.</P>
<P>Having waited a considerable time,
during which the official did not repeat
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
the signal, the door was partly opened by
a person whom Vivaldi could not distin∣guish
in the gloom beyond, and with
whom one of his conductors communi∣cated
by signs; after which the door was
closed.</P>
<P>Several minutes had elapsed, when tones
of deep voices aroused the attention of
Vivaldi. They were loud and hoarse, and
spoke in a language unknown to him.
At the sounds, the official immediately
extinguished his torch. The voices drew
nearer, and, the door again unfolding,
two figures stood before Vivaldi, which,
shewn by a glimmering light within, struck
him with astonishment and dismay. They
were cloathed, like his conductors, in
black, but in a different fashion, for their
habits were made close to the shape.
Their faces were entirely concealed be∣neath
a very peculiar kind of cowl, which
descended from the head to the feet; and
their eyes only were visible through small
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
openings contrived for the sight. It oc∣curred
to Vivaldi that these men were tor∣turers;
their appearance was worthy of
demons. Probably they were thus ha∣bited,
that the persons whom they afflict∣ed
might not know them; or, perhaps, it
was only for the purpose of striking terror
upon the minds of the accused, and thus
compelling them to confess without further
difficulty. Whatever motive might have
occasioned their horrific appearance, and
whatever was their office, Vivaldi was
delivered into their hands, and in the
same moment heard the iron door shut,
which enclosed him with them in a nar∣row
passage, gloomily lighted by a lamp
suspended from the arched roof. They
walked in silence on each side of their
prisoner, and came to a second door, which
admitted them instantly into another pas∣sage.
A third door, at a short distance,
admitted them to a third avenue, at the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endof which one of his mysterious guides
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
struck upon a gate, and they stopped.
The uncertain, sounds that Vivaldi had
sancied he heard, were now more audi∣ble,
and he distinguished, with inex∣pressible
horror, that they were uttered
by persons suffering.</P>
<P>The gate was, at length, opened by a
figure habited like his conductors, and
two other doors of iron, placed very near
each other, being also unlocked, Vivaldi
found himself in a spacious chamber, the
walls of which were hung with black,
duskily lighted by lamps that gleamed in
the lofty vault. Immediately on his en∣trance,
a strange found ran along the
walls, and echoed among other vaults,
that appeared, by the progress of the
sound, to extend far beyond this.</P>
<P>It was not immediately that Vivaldi
could sufficiently recollect himself to ob∣serve
any object before him; and, even
when he did so, the gloom of the place
prevented his ascertaining many appear∣ances.
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
Shadowy countenances and un∣certain
forms seemed to flit through the
dusk, and many instuments, the appli∣cation
of which he did not comprehend,
struck him with horrible suspicions. Still
he heard, at intervals, half-suppressed
groans, and was looking round to disco∣ver
the wretched people from whom they
were extorted, when a voice, from a re∣mote
part of the chamber, called on him
to advance.</P>
<P>The distance, and the obscurity of the
spot whence the voice issued, had prevent∣ed
Vivaldi from noticing any person there,
and he was now slowly obeying, when,
on a second summons, his conductors
seized his arms, and hurried him for∣ward.</P>
<P>In a remote part of this extensive
chamber, he perceived three persons seated
under a black canopy, on chairs raised
several steps from the floor, and who ap∣peared
to preside there in the office of ei∣ther
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
judges or examiners, or directors of
the punishments. Below, at a table, sat
a secretary, over whom was suspended the
only lamp that could enable him to com∣mit
to paper what should occur during the
examination. Vivaldi now understood that
the three persons who composed the tribu∣nal
were the vicar general, or grand in∣quisitor,
the advocate of the exchequer,
and an ordinary inquisitor, who was seat∣ed
between the other two, and who ap∣peared
more eagerly to engage in the du∣ties
of his cruel office. A portentous
obscurity enveloped alike their persons
and their proceedings.</P>
<P>At some distance from the tribunal
stood a large iron frame, which Vivaldi
conjectured to be the rack, and near it
another, resembling, in shape, a coffin,
but, happily, he could not distinguish
through the remote obscurity, any person
undergoing actual suffering. In the
vaults beyond, however, the diabolical
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
decrees of the inquisitors seemed to be
fulfilling; for, whenever a distant door
opened for a moment, sounds of lamen∣tation
issued forth, and men, whom he
judged to be familiars, habited like, those
who stood beside him, were seen passing
to and fro within.</P>
<P>Vivaldi almost believed himself in the
infernal regions; the dismal aspect of
this place, the horrible preparation for
punishment, and, above all, the disposi∣tion
and appearance of the persons that
were ready to inflict it, confirmed the re∣semblance.
That any human being should
willingly afflict a fellow being who had
never injured, or even offended him;
that, unswayed by passion, he should de∣liberately
become the means of torturing
him, appeared to Vivaldi nearly incredi∣ble!
But when he looked at the three
persons who composed the tribunal, and
considered that they had not only volun∣tarily
undertaken the cruel office they
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>
fulfilled, but had probably long regarded
it as the summit of their ambition, his
astonishment and indignation were un∣bounded.</P>
<P>The grand inquisitor, having again
called on Vivaldi by name, admonished
him to consefs the truth, and avoid the
suffering that awaited him.</P>
<P>As Vivaldi had on former examinations
spoken the truth, which was not believed,
he had no chance of escaping present
suffering, but by asserting falshood: in
doing so, to avoid such monstrous injus∣tice
and cruelty, he might, perhaps, have
been justified had it been certain that
such assertion could affect himself alone;
but since he knew that the consequence
must extend to others, and, above all,
believed that Ellena di Rosalba must be
involved in it, he did not hesitate for an
Instant to dare whatever torture his firm∣ness
might provoke. But even if mora∣lity
could have forgiven falshood in such
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
extraordinary circumstances as these, poli∣cy,
after all, would have forbidden it,
since a discovery of the artifice would
probably have led to the final destruction
of the accused person.</P>
<P>Of Ellena's situation he would now
have asked, however desperate the ques∣tion;
would again have asserted her inno∣cence,
and supplicated for compassion,
even to inquisitors, had he not perceived
that, in doing so, he should only furnish
them with a more exquisite means of
torturing him than any other they could
apply; for if, when all the terrors of his
soul concerning her were understood, they
should threaten to increase her sufferings,
as the punishment of what was termed
his obstinacy, they would, indeed, be∣come
the masters of his integrity, as well
as of his person.</P>
<P>The tribunal again, and repeatedly,
urged Vivaldi to consess himself guilty;
and the inquisitor, at length, concluded
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
with saying, that the judges were inno∣cent
of whatever consequence might en∣sue
from his obstinacy; so that, if he
expired beneath his sufferings, himself
only, not they, would have occasioned
his death.</P>
<P>“I am innocent of the charges which
I understand are urged against me,” said
Vivaldi, with solemnity; “I repeat, that
I am innocent! If, to escape the horrors
of these moments, I could be weak
enough to declare myself guilty, not all
your racks could alter truth, and make
me so, except in that assertion. The
consequence of your tortures, therefore,
be upon your own heads!”</P>
<P>While Vivaldi spoke, the vicar general
listened with attention, and, when he
had ceased to speak, appeared to medi∣tate;
but the inquisitor was irritated by
the boldness of his speech, instead of be∣ing
convinced by the justness of his re∣presentation;
and made a signal for the
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
officers to prepare for the <HI>question.</HI> While
they were obeying, Vivaldi observed, not∣withstanding
the agitation he suffered, a
person cross the chamber, whom he im∣mediately
knew to be the same that had
passed him in an avenue of the inquisi∣tion
on a former night, and whom he had
then fancied to be the mysterious stranger
of Paluzzi. Vivaldi now fixed his eyes
upon him, but his own peculiar situalion
prevented his feeling the interest he had
formerly suffered concerning him.</P>
<P>The figure, air, and stalk, of this per∣son
were so striking, and so strongly re∣sembled
those of the monk of Paluzzi,
that Vivaldi had no longer a doubt as to
their identity. He pointed him out to one
of the officials, and inquired who he was.
While he spoke, the stranger was passing
forward, and, before any reply was given,
a door leading to the farther vaults shut
him from view. Vivaldi, however, re∣peated
the inquiry, which the official ap∣peared
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
unable to answer, and a reproof
from the tribunal reminded him, that he
must not ask questions there. Vivaldi
observed that it was the grand inquisitor
who spoke, and that the manner of the
official immediately changed.</P>
<P>The familiars, who were the same that
had, conducted Vivaldi into the chamber,
having made ready the instrument of tor∣ture,
approached him, and, after taking
off his cloak and vest, bound him with
strong cords. They threw over his head
the customary black garment, which en∣tirely
enveloped his figure, and prevented
his observing what was farther preparing.
In this-state of expectation, he was again
interrogated by the inquisitor.</P>
<P>“Was you ever in the church of the
spirito Santo, at Naples?” said he.</P>
<P>“Yes,” replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Did you ever express there a: con∣tempt
for the Catholic faith?”</P>
<P>“Never,” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156"/>
“Neither by word or action?” conti∣nued
the inquisitor.</P>
<P>“Never, by either!”</P>
<P>“Recollect yourself,” added the in∣quisitor.
“Did you never insult there a
minister of our most holy church?”</P>
<P>Vivaldi was silent: he began to perceive
the real nature of the charge which was
to be urged against him, and that it was
too plausible to permit his escape from
the punishment, which is adjudged for he∣resy.
Questions so direct and minute had
never been put to him here on his for∣mer
examinations; they had been referved
for a moment when it was believed he
could not evade them; and the real charge
had been concealed from him, that he
might not be prepared to elude it.</P>
<P>“Answer!” repeated the inquisitor;—
“Did you ever insult a minister of the
Catholic faith, in the church of the Spi∣rito
Santo, at Naples?”</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="157"/>
“Did you not insult him while he was
performing an act of holy penance?” said
another voice.</P>
<P>Vivaldi started, for he instantly recol∣lected
the well-known tones of the monk
of Paluzzi. “Who asks the question?”
demanded Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“It is you who are to answer here,”
resumed the inquisitor. “Answer to
what I have required.”</P>
<P>“I have offended a minister of the
church,” replied Vivaldi, “but never
could intentionally insult our holy reli∣gion.
You are not acquainted, fathers,
with the injuries that provoked—”</P>
<P>“Enough!” interrupted the inquisi∣tor;
“speak to the question. Did you
not, by insult and menace, force a pious
brother to leave unperformed the act of
penance in which he had engaged him∣self?
Did you not compel him to quit
the church, and fly for refuge to his con∣vent?”</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158"/>
“No,” replied Vivaldi. “'Tis true,
he left the church, and that in conse∣quence
of my conduct there; but the
consequence was not necessary; if he had
only replied to my inquiry, or promised
to restore her of whom he had treache∣rously
robbed me, he might have re∣mained
quietly in the church till this
moment, had that depended upon my
forbearance.”</P>
<P>“What!” said the vicar-general,
“would you have compelled him to
speak, when he was engaged in silent pe∣nance?
You confess, that you occa∣sioned
him to leave the church. That is
enough.”</P>
<P>“Where did you first see Ellena di Ro∣salba?”
said the voice, which had spoken
once before.</P>
<P>“I demand again, who gives the
question,” answered Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Recollect yourself,” said the inquisi∣tor,
“a criminal cannot make a demand.”</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159"/>
“I do not perceive the connection be∣tween
your admonition and your asser∣tion,”
obsrved Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“You appear to be rather too much,
at your ease,” said the inquisitor. “An∣swer
to the question which was last put
to you, or the familiars shall do their
duty.”</P>
<P>“Let the same person ask it,” replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>The question was repeated in the for∣mer
voice.</P>
<P>“In the church of San Lorenzo, at
Naples,” said Vivaldi, with a heavy sigh,
“I first beheld Ellena di Rosalba.”</P>
<P>“Was she then professed?” asked the
vicar general.</P>
<P>“She never accepted the veil,” replied
Vivaldi, “nor ever intended to do so.”</P>
<P>“Where did the reside at that period?”</P>
<P>“She lived with a relative at Villa Al∣tieri,
and would yet reside there, had not
the machinations of a monk occasioned
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
her to be torn from her Home, and Con∣fined
in a convent, from which I had just
assisted to release her, when she was again
seized, and upon a charge most false
and cruel.—O reverend fathers! I con∣jure,
I supplicate—” Vivadi restrained
himself, for he was going to have be∣trayed,
to the mercy of inquisitors, all
the feelings of his heart.</P>
<P>“The name of the monk?” said the
stranger, earnestly.</P>
<P>“If I mistake not,” replied Vivaldi,
“you are already acquainted with it.
The monk is called father Schedoni. He
is of the Dominican convent of the Spi∣rito
Santo, in Naples, and the same who
accuses me of having insalted him in the
charch of that name.”</P>
<P>“How did you know him for your, ac∣cuser?”
asked the same voice.</P>
<P>“Because he is my only enemy,” re∣plied
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Your enemy!” observed the inquisi∣tor;
“a former deposition says, you were
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
unconscious of having one! You are in∣consistent
in your replies.”</P>
<P>“You were warned not to visit Villa
Altieri,” said the unknown person. “Why
did you not profit by the warning?”</P>
<P>“I was warned by yourself,” answered
Vivaldi. “Now I know you well.”</P>
<P>“By me!” said the stranger, in a so∣lemn
tone.</P>
<P>“By you!” repeated Vivaldi: “you
who also foretold the death of Signora
Bianchi; and you are that enemy—that
father Schedoni, by whom I am ac∣cused.”</P>
<P>“Whence come these questions?” de∣manded
the vicar general. “Who has
been authorised thus to interrogate the
prisoner?”</P>
<P>No reply was made. A busy hum of
voices from the tribunal succeeded the
silence. At length, the murmuring sub∣sided,
and the monk's voice was heard
again.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162"/>
“I will declare thus much,” it said,
addressing Vivaldi; “I am not father
Schedoni.”</P>
<P>The peculiar tone and emphasis, with
which this was delivered, more than the
assertion itself, persuaded Vivaldi that
the stanger spoke truth; and, though he
still recognized the voice of the monk of
Paluzzi, he did not know it to be that of
Schedoni. Vivaldi was astonished! He
would have torn the veil from his eyes,
and once more viewed this mysterious
stranger, had his hands been at liberty.
As it was, he could only conjure him to
reveal his name, and the motives for his
former conduct.</P>
<P>“Who is come amongst us?” said the
vicar general, in the voice of a person,
who means to inspire in others the awe
he himself suffers.</P>
<P>“Who is come amongst us?” he re∣peated,
in a louder tone. Still no an∣swer
was returned; but again a confused
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
murmur founded from the tribunal, and a
general consternation seemed to prevail.
No person spoke with sufficient pre-emi∣nence
to be understood by Vivaldi; some∣thing
extraordinary appeared to be passing,
and he awaited the issue with all the pa∣tience
he could command. Soon after he
heard doors opened, and the noise of per∣sons
quitting the chamber. A deep silence
followed; but he was certain that the
familiars were still beside him, waiting
to begin their work of torture.</P>
<P>After a considerable time had elapsed,
Vivaldi heard footsteps advancing, and a
Person give orders for his release, that
he might be carried back to his cell.</P>
<P>When the veil was removed from his
eyes, he perceived that the tribunal was
dissolved, and that the stranger was gone.
The lamps were dying away, and the
chamber appeared more gloomily terrific
than before.</P>
<P>The familiars conducted him to the spot
at which they had received him; whence
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
the officers who had led him thither,
guarded him to his prison. There, stretched
upon his bed of straw, in solitude and in
darkness, he had leisure enough to reflect
upon what had passed, and to recollect
with minute exactness every former cir∣cumstance
connected with the stranger.
By comparing those with the present, he
endeavoured to draw a more certain con∣clusion
as to the identity of this person,
and his motives for the very extraordinary
conduct he had pursued. The first ap∣pearance
of this stranger, among the ruins
of Paluzzi, when he had said that Vivaldi's
steps were watched, and had cautioned
him against returning to Villa Altieri,
was recalled to his mind. Vivaldi re-con∣sidered,
also, his second appearance on
the same spot, and his second warning;
the circumstances, which had attended his
own adventures within the fortress;—the
monk's prediction of Bianchi's death, and
his evil tidings respecting Ellena, at the
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
very hour when she had been seized and
carried from her home. The longer he
considered these several instances, as they
were now connected in his mind, with the
certainty of Schedoni's evil disposition
towards him, the more he was inclined to
believe, not withstanding the voice of
seeming truth which had just affirmed the
contrary, that the unknown person was
Schedoni himself, and that he had been
employed by the Marchesa, to prevent
Vivaldi's visits to Villa Altieri. Being
thus an agent in the events of which he
had warned Vivaldi, he was too well
enabled to predict them. Vivaldi paused
upon the remembrance of Signor Bianchi's
death; he considered the extraordinary
and dubious circumstances that had at∣tended
it, and shuddered as a new conjec∣ture
crossed his mind.—The thought was
too dreadful to be permitted, and he dis∣missed
it instantly.</P>
<P>Of the conversation, however, which he
had afterwards held with the Confessor in
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
the Marchesa's cabinet, he recollected
many particulars that served to renew his
doubts as to the identity of the stranger;
the behaviour of Schedoni when he was
obliquely challenged for the monk of
Paluzzi, still appeared that of a man un∣conscious
of disguise; and above all, Vi∣valid
was struck with the seeming candour
of his having pointed out a circumstance,
which removed the probability that the
stranger was a brother of the <HI>Santa del.
Pianto</HI></P>
<P>Some particulars, also, of the stran∣ger's
conduct did not agree with what
might have been expected from Sche∣doni,
even though the. Confessor had
really been Vivaldi's enemy; a circum∣stance
which the latter was no longer per∣mitted
to doubt. Nor did those particular
circumstanes accord, as he was inclined to
believe, with the manner of a being of
tins world; and, when Vivaldi considered
the suddenness and mystery, with which
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
the stranger had always appeared and re∣tired,
he felt disposed to adopt again one
of his earliest conjectures, which un∣doubtedly
the horrors of his present abode
disposed his imagination to admit, as
those of his former situation in the vaults
of Paluzzi, together with a youthful glow
of curiosity concerning the marvellous, had
before contributed to impress them upon
his mind.</P>
<P>He concluded his present reflections as
he bad began them—in doubt and per∣plexity;
but at length found a respite
from thought and from suffering in sleep.</P>
<P>Midnight had been passed in the vaults
of the Inquisition; but it was probably
not yet two o'clock, when he was imper∣fectly
awakened by a sound, which he
fancied proceeded from within his cham∣ber.
He raised himself to diseover what
had occasioned the noise; it was, how∣ever,
impossible to discern any object, for
all was dark, but he listened for a return
of the found. The wind only, was heard
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
moaning amongthe inner buildings of the
prison, and Vivaldi concluded, that his
dream had mocked him with a mimic
voice.</P>
<P>Satisfied with this conclusion, he again
laid his head on his pillow of straw, and
soon sunk into a slumber. The subject of
his waking thoughts still haunted his ima∣gination,
and the stranger, whose voice
he had this night recognized as that of the
monk, of Paluzzi, appeared before him.
Vivaldi, on perceiving the figure of this
Unknown, felt, perhaps, nearly the same
degrees of awe, curiosity, and impatience
that he would have suffered, had he beheld
the substance of this shadow. The monk,
whose face was still shrowded, he thought
advanced, till, having come within a few
paces of Vivaldi, he paused, and, lifting
the awful cowl that had hitherto concealed
him, disclosed—not the countenance of
Schedoni, but one which Vivaldi did not
recollect ever having seen before! It was
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
not less interesting to curiosity, than
striking to the feelings. Vivaldi at the
first glance shrunk back;—something of
that strange and indescribable air, which
we attach to the idea of a supernatural
being, prevailed over the features; and
the intense and fiery eyes resembled those
of an evil spirit, rather than of a human
character. He drew a poniard from be∣neath
a sold of his garment, and, as he
displayed it, pointed with a stern frown
to the spots which discoloured the blade;
Vivaldi perceived they were of blood!
He turned away his eyes in horror, and,
when he again looked round in his dream,
the figure was gone.</P>
<P>A groan awakened him, but what
were his feelings, when, on looking up,
he perceived the same figure standing
before him! It was not, however, imme∣diately
that he could convince himself the
appearance was more than the phantom
of his dream, strongly impressed upon an
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
alarmed fancy. The voice of the monk,
for his face was as usual concealed, re∣called
Vivaldi from his error; but his
emotion cannot easily be conceived, when
the stranger, slowly listing that mysterious
cowl, discovered to him the same awful
countenance, which had characterized the
vision in his slumber. Unable to inquire
the occasion of this appearance, Vivaldi
gazed in astonishment and terror, and did
not immediately observe, that, instead of
a dagger, the monk held a lamp, which
gleamed over every deep furrow of his
features, yet left their shadowdy markings
to hint the passions and the history of an
extraordinary life.</P>
<P>“You are spared for this night,” said
the stranger, “but for to-morrow”—he
paused.</P>
<P>“In the name of all that is most
sacred,” said Vivaldi, endeavouring to re∣collect
his thoughts, “who are you, and
what is your errand?”</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171"/>
“Ask no questions,” replied the monk,
solemnly;—“but answer <HI>me.</HI>”</P>
<P>Vivaldi was struck by the tone, with
which he said this, and dared not to urge
the inquiry at the present moment.</P>
<P>“How long have you known father
Schedoni?” continued the stranger,
“Where did you first meet?</P>
<P>“I have known him about a year, as
my mother's confessor,” replied Vivaldi.
“I first saw him in a corridor of the
Vivaldi palace; it was evening, and he
was returning from the Marchesa's closet.”</P>
<P>“Are you certain as to this?” said the
monk, with peculiar emphasis. “It is of
consequence that you should be so.”</P>
<P>“I am certain,” repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“It is strange,” observed the monk,
after a pause, “that a circumstance,
which must have appeared trivial to you
at the moment, should have left so strong
a mark on your memory! In two years we
have time to forget many things!” He
sighed as he spoke.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172"/>
“I remember the circumstance,” said
Vivaldi, “because I was struk with his
appearance; the evening was far ad∣vanced
—it was dusk, and he came upon
me suddenly. His voice startled me; as
he passed he said to himself—“It is for
vespers.” At the same time I heard the
bell of the Spirito Santo.”</P>
<P>“Do you know who he is?” said the
stranger, solemnly.</P>
<P>“I know only what he appears to be,”
replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Did you never hear any report of his
past life?”</P>
<P>“Never,” answered Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Never any thing extraordinary con∣cerning
him,” added the monk.</P>
<P>Vivaldi paused a moment; for he now
recollected the obscure and imperfect story,
which Paulo had related while they were
confined in the dungeon of Paluzzi, re∣specting
a confession made in the church
of the Black Penitents; but he could not
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
presume to affirm, that it concerned Sche∣doni.
He remembered also the monk's
garments, stained with blood, which he
had discovered in the vaults of that fort.
The conduct of the mysterious being,
who now stood before him, with many
other particulars of his own adventures
there, passed like a vision over his me∣mory.
His mind resembled the glass of a
magician, on which the apparitions of
long-buried events arise, and as they fleet
away, point portentously to shapes half∣hid
in the duskiness of futurity. An un∣usual
dread seized upon him; and a super∣stition,
such as he had never before ad∣mitted
in an equal degree, usurped his
judgment. He looked up to the shadowy
countenance of the stranger; and almost
believed he beheld an inhabitant of the
world of spirits.</P>
<P>The monk spoke again, repeating in a
severer tone, “Did you never hear any
thing extraordinary concerning father
Schedoni?”</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174"/>
“Is it reasonable,” said Vivaldi, recol∣lecting
his courage, “that I should an∣swer
the questions, the minute questions,
of a person who refuses to tell me even
his name?”</P>
<P>“My name is passed away—it is no
more remembered,” replied the stranger,
turning from Vivaldi,—“I leave you to
your fate.”</P>
<P>“What fate?” asked Vivaldi, “and
what is the purpose of this visit? I con∣jure
you, in the tremendous name of the
Inquisition, to say!”</P>
<P>“You will know full soon; have mercy
on yourself!”</P>
<P>“What fate?” repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Urge me no further,” said the
stranger; “but answer to” what I shall
demand. Schedoni—”</P>
<P>“I have told all that I certainly know
concerning him,” interrupted Vivaldi,
“the rest is only conjecture.”</P>
<P>“What is that conjecture? Does it re∣late
to a confession made in the church
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
of the Black Penitents of the Santa Ma∣ria
del Pianto?</P>
<P>“It does!” replied Vivaldi with sur∣prise.</P>
<P>“What was that confession”</P>
<P>“I know not,“answered Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Declare the truth,” said the stranger,
sternly.</P>
<P>“A confession,” replied Vivaldi, “is
sacred, and forever buried in the bosom of
the priest to whom it is made. How,
then, is it to be supposed, that I can be
acquainted with the subject of this?”</P>
<P>“Did you never hear, that father Sche∣doni
had been guilty of some great crimes,
which he endeavours to erase from his
conscience by the severity of penance?”</P>
<P>“Never!” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Did you never hear that he had a
wife—a brother?”</P>
<P>“Never!”</P>
<P>“Nor the means he used—no hint of—
murder, of—”</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176"/>
The stranger paused, as if he wished
Vivaldi to fill up his meaning, Vivaldi was
silent and aghast.</P>
<P>“You know nothing then, of Sche∣doni,”
resumed the monk after a deep
pause—” nothing of his past life?</P>
<P>“Nothing, except what I have men∣tioned,”
replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Then listen to what I shall unfold!”
continued the monk, with solemnity.
“To-morrow night you will be again
carried to the place of torture; you will
be taken to a chamber beyond that in
which you were this night. You will
there witness many extraordinary things,
of which you have not now any suspicion.
Be not dismayed; I shall be there, though,
perhaps, not visible.”</P>
<P>“Not visible!” exclaimed Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Interrupt me not, but listen.—When
you are asked of father Schedoni, say—
that he has lived for fifteen years in the
disguise of a monk, a member of the
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
Dominicans of the Spirito Santo, at Naples,
When you are asked who he is, reply—
Ferando Count di Bruno. You will be
asked the motive, for such disguise. In
reply to this, refer them to the <HI>Black
Penitents</HI> of the Santa Maria del Pianto,
near that city; bid the inquisitors summon
before their tribunal one father Ansaldo di
Rovalli, the grand penitentiary of the
society, and command him to divulge the
crimes confessed to him in the year 1752,
on the evening of the twenty-fourth of
April, which was then the vigil of Santo
Marco, in a confessional of the Santa
del Pianto.”</P>
<P>“It is probable he may have forgotten
such confession, at this distance of time,”
observed Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Fear not but he will remember,” re∣plied
the stranger.</P>
<P>“But will his conscience suffer him to
betray the secrets of a confession?” said
Viyaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178"/>
“The tribunal command, and his con∣science
is absolved,” answered the monk,
“He may not refuse to obey! You are
further to direct your examiners to sum∣mon
father Schedoni, to answer for the
crimes which Ansaldo shall reveal.”
The monk paused, and seemed waiting,
the reply of Vivaldi, who, after a mo∣mentary
consideration, said.</P>
<P>“How can I do all this, and upon the
instigation of a stranger! Neither con∣science
nor prudence will suffer me to as∣sert
what I cannot prove. It is true that I
have reason to believe Schedoni is my bit∣ter
enemy, but I will not be unjust even
to him. I have no proof that he is the
Count di Bruno, nor that he is the perpe∣trator
of the crimes you allude to, what∣ever
those may be; and I will not be made
an instrument to summon any man before
a tribunal, where innocence is no pro∣tection
from ignominy, and where suspi∣cion
alone may inflict death.”</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179"/>
“You doubt, then, the truth of what
I assert?” said the monk, in a haughty
tone.</P>
<P>“Can I believe that of which I have
no proof?” replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Yes, there are cases which do not ad∣mit
of proof; under your peculiar circum∣stances,
this is one of them; you can act
only upon assertion. I attest,” continued
the monk, raising his hollow voice to a
tone of singular solemnity, “I attest the
powers which are beyond this earth, to
witness to the truth of what I have deli∣vered!”</P>
<P>As the stranger uttered this adjuration,
Vivaldi observed, with emotion, the ex∣traordinary
expression of his eyes; Vival∣di's
presence of mind, however, did not
forsake him, and, in the next moment, he
said, “But who is he that thus attests? It
is upon the assertion of a stranger that I
am to rely, in defect of proof! It is a
stranger who calls upon me to bring so∣lemn
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
charges aganst a man, of whose,
guilt I know nothing!”</P>
<P>“You are not required to bring charges,
you are only to summon him who will.”</P>
<P>“I should still assist in bringing for∣ward
accusations, which may be founded
in error,” replied Vivaldi. “If you are
convinced of their truth, why do not you
summon Ansaldo yourself!”</P>
<P>“I shall do more,” said the monk.</P>
<P>“But why not summon also?” urged
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“I shall <HI>appear,</HI>” said the stranger, with
emphasis.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, though somewhat awed by the
manner, which accompanied these words,
still urged his inquiries, “As a witness?”
said he.</P>
<P>“Aye, as a dreadful witness!” replied
the monk.</P>
<P>“But may not a witness summon others
before the tribunal of the inquisition?”
continued Vivaldi, faulteringly.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181"/>
“He may,” said the stranger.</P>
<P>“Why then,” observed Vivaldi, “am
I, a stranger to you, called upon to do
that which you could perform yourself?”</P>
<P>“Ask no further,” said the monk,
“but answer, whether you will deliver
the summons?”</P>
<P>“The charges, which must follow,”
replied Vivaldi, “appear to be of a nature
too solemn to justify my promoting them.
I resign the task to you.”</P>
<P>“When <HI>I</HI> summon,” said the strangery
“<HI>you</HI> shall obey!”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, again awed by his manner,
again justified his refusal, and concluded
with repeating his surprize, that he should
be required to assist in this mysterious af∣fair,
“Since I neither know you, father,”
he added, “nor the Penitentiary Ansaldo,
whom you bid me admonish to appear.”</P>
<P>“You shall know me hereafter,” said
the stranger, frowningly; and he drew
from beneath his garment a dagger!</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182"/>
Vivaldi remembered his dream.</P>
<P>“Mark those spots,” said the monk.</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked, and beheld blood!</P>
<P>“This blood, added the stranger, point∣ing
to the blade, “would have saved
your's! Here is some print of truth! To∣morrow
night you will meet me in the
chambers of death!”</P>
<P>As he spoke, he turned away; and,
before Vivaldi had recovered from his
consternation, the light disappeared. Vi∣valdi
knew that the stranger had quitted
the prison, only by the silence which pre∣vailed
there.</P>
<P>He remained sunk in thought, till, at
the dawn of day, the man, on watch, un∣fastened
the door of his cell, and brought,
as usual, a jug of water, and some bread.
Vivaldi inquired the name of the stranger
who had visited him in the night. The
centinel looked surprized, and Vivaldi re∣peated
the question before he could obtain
an answer.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183"/>
“I have been on guard since the first
hour,” said the man, and no person, in
that time, has passed through this door!”</P>
<P>Vivaldi regarded the centinel with at∣tention,
while he made this assertion, and
did not perceive in his manner any consci∣ousness
of falshood; yet he knew, not how
to believe what he had affirmed.” Did
you hear no noise, either?” said Vivaldi.
“Has all been silent during the night?”</P>
<P>“I have heard only the bell of San Do∣minico
strike upon the hour,” replied the
man, “and the watch word of the centi∣nels.”</P>
<P>“This is incomprehensible!” exclaimed
Vivaldi, “What! no footsteps, no voice?”</P>
<P>The man smiled contemptuously.
“None, but of the centinels,” he replied.</P>
<P>“How can you be certain you heard
only the centinel's, friend?“added Vi∣valdi.</P>
<P>“They speak only to pass the watch
word, and the clash of their arms is heard
at the same time.”</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184"/>
“But their footsteps!—how are they
distinguished from those of other per∣sons?”</P>
<P>“By the heaviness of their tread; our
sandals are braced with iron. But why
these questions, Signor?”</P>
<P>“You have kept guard at the door of
this chamber?” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Yes, Signor.”</P>
<P>“And you have not once heard, during
the whole night, a voice from within it?”</P>
<P>“None, Signor.”</P>
<P>“Fear nothing from discovery, friend;
confess that you have slumbered.”</P>
<P>“I had a comrade,” replied the centi∣nel,
angrily, “has he, too, slumbered!
and if he had, how could admittance be
obtained without our keys?”</P>
<P>“And those might easily have been
procured, friend, if you were overcome
with sleep. You may rely upon my pro∣mise
of secrecy.”</P>
<P>“What!” said the man, “have I kept
guard For three years in the Inquisition, to
<PB N="184" REF="185"/>
be suspected, by a heretic, of neglecting
my duty?”</P>
<P>“If you were suspected by an heretic,”
replied Vivaldi, “you ought to console
yourself by recollecting that his opinions
are considered to be erroneous.”</P>
<P>“We were watchful every minute of
the night,” said the centinel, going.</P>
<P>“This is incomprehensible!” said Vi∣valdi,
“By what means could the stranger
have entered my prison?”</P>
<P>“Signor, you still dream!” replied the
centinel, pausing, “No person has been
here.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Still</HI> dream!” repeated Vivaldi, “how
do you know that I have dreamt at all?”
His mind deeply affected by the extra∣ordinary
circumstances of the dream, and
the yet more extraordinary incident that
had followed, Vivaldi gave a meaning to
the words of the centinel, which did not
belong to them.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="186"/>
“When people sleep, they are apt to
dream,” replied the man, dryly. “I sup∣posed
<HI>you</HI> had slept, Signor.”</P>
<P>“A person, habited like a monk, came
to me in the night, “resumed Vivaldi,
and he described the appearance of the
stranger. The centinel, while he listened,
became grave and thoughtful.</P>
<P>“Do you know any person resembling
the one I have mentioned,” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“No!” replied the guard.</P>
<P>“Though you have not seen him enter
my prison,” continued Vivaldi, “you may,
perhaps, recollect such a person, as an in∣habitant
of the Inquisition.”</P>
<P>“San Dominico forbid!”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, surprized at this exclamation,
inquired the reason for it.</P>
<P>“I know him not,” replied the centinel,
changing countenance, and he abruptly
left the prison. Whatever consideration
might occasion this sudden departure,
his assertion that he had been for three
<PB N="186" REF="187"/>
years a guard of the Inquisition could
scarcely be credited, since he had held
so long a dialogue with a prisoner, and
was, apparently, insensible of the dan∣ger
he incurred by so doing.</P>

<Q><L>—“Is it not dead midnight?</L>

<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL>
<P>AT about the same hour, as on the pre∣ceding
night, Vivaldi heard persons ap∣proaching
his prison, and, the door un∣folding,
his former conductors appeared.
They threw over him the same mantle as
before, and, in addition, a black veil,
that completely muffled his eyes; after
which, they led him from the chamber.
Vivaldi heard, the door shut, on his de∣parture,
and the centinels followed his
steps, as if their duty was finished, and
he was to return thither no more. At
this moment, he remembered the words
of the stranger when he had displayed the
<PB N="188" REF="189"/>
poniard, and Vivaldi apprehended the
worst, from having thwarted, the designs
of a person apparently so malignant: but
he exulted in the rectitude, which had pre∣served
him from debasement, and, with
the magnanimous enthusiasm of virtue,
he almost welcomed sufferings, which
would prove the firmness of his justice
towards an enemy; for he determined to
brave every thing, rather than impute to
Schedoni circumstances, the truth of
which he possessed no means of ascer∣taining.</P>
<P>While Vivaldi was conducted as on
the preceding night, through many pas∣sages,
he endeavoured to discover, by
their length, and the abruptness of their
turnings, whether they were the same he
bad traversed before. Suddenly, one of
his conductors cried “Steps!” It was
the first word Vivaldi had ever heard him
utter. He immediately perceived that the
ground sunk, and he began to descend;
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
as he did which, he tried to count the
number of the steps, that he might form
some judgment whether this was the flight
he had passed before. When he had
reached the bottom, he inclined to be∣lieve
that it was not so; and the care
which had been observed in blinding him,
seemed to indicate that he was going to
some new place.</P>
<P>He passed through several avenues, and
then ascended; soon after which, he again
descended a very long stair-case, such as
he had not any remembrance of, and they
passed over a considerable extent of level
ground. By the hollow sounds which
his steps returned, he judged that he was
walking over vaults. The footsteps of
the centinels who had followed from the
cell were no longer heard, and he seemed
to be left with his conductors only. A
second flight appeared to lead him into
Subterraneous vaults, fox he perceived the
air change, and felt a damp vapour wrap
<PB N="190" REF="191"/>
round him. The menace of the monk,
that he should meet him in the chambers
of death, frequently occurred to Vivaldi.</P>
<P>His conductors flopped in this vault,
and seemed to hold a consultation, but
they spoke in such low accents, that their
words were not distinguishable, except a
few unconnected ones, that hinted of
more than Vivaldi could comprehend.
He was, at length, again led forward;
and soon after, he heard the heavy grating
of hinges, and perceived that he was
passing through several doors, by the situ∣ation
of which Vivaldi judged they were
the same he had entered the night before,
and concluded, that he was going to the
hall of the tribunal.</P>
<P>His conductors stopped again, and
Vivaldi heard the iron rod strike three
times upon a door; immediately a strange
voice spoke from within, and the door
was unclosed. Vivaldi passed on, and
imagined that he was admitted into a spa∣cious
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>
vault; for the air was freer, and his
steps sounded to a distance.</P>
<P>Presently, a voice, as on the preceding
night, summoned him to come forward,
and Vivaldi understood that he was again
before the tribunal. It was the voice of
the inquisitor who had been his chief
examiner.</P>
<P>“You, Vincentio di Vivaldi,” it said,
“answer to your name, and to the ques∣tions
which shall be put to you, without
equivocation, on pain of the torture.”</P>
<P>As the monk had predicted, Vivaldi was
asked what he knew of father Schedoni,
and, when he replied, as he had formerly
done to his mysterious visitor, he was
told that he knew more than he acknow∣ledged.</P>
<P>“I <HI>know</HI> no more,” replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“You equivocate,” said the inquisitor.
“Declare what you have heard, and re∣member
that you formerly took an oath
to that purpose.”</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193"/>
Vivaldi was silent, till a tremendous
voice from the tribunal commanded him
to respect his oath.</P>
<P>“I do respect it,” said Vivaldi; “and
I conjure you to believe that I also re∣spect
truth, when I declare, that what I
am going to relate, is a report to which
I give no confidence, and concerning even
the probability of which I cannot produce
the smallest proof.”</P>
<P>“Respect truth!” said another voice
from the tribunal, and Vivaldi fancied he
distinguished the tones of the monk.
He paused a moment, and the exhorta∣tion
was repeated. Vivaldi then related
what the stranger had said concerning the
family of Schedoni, and the disguise
which the father had assumed in the con∣vent
of the Spirito Santo; but forbore
even to name the penitentiary Ansaldo,
and any circumstance connected with the
extraordinary confession. Vivaldi con∣cluded,
with again declaring, that he had
<PB N="193" REF="194"/>
had not sufficient authority to justify a be∣lief
in those reports.</P>
<P>“On what authority do you repeat
them?” said the vicar-general.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was silent.</P>
<P>“On what authority?” inquired the
inquifitor, sternly.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after a momentary hesitation,
said, “What I am about to declare, holy
fathers, is so extraordinary—”</P>
<P>“Tremble!” said a voice close to his
ear, which he instantly knew to be the
monk's, and the suddenness of which elec∣trified
him. He was unable to conclude
the sentence.</P>
<P>“What is your authority for the re∣ports?”
demanded the inquisiton.</P>
<P>“It is unknown, even to myself!”
answered Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Do not equivocqte!” said the vicar∣general.</P>
<P>“I solemnly protest,” rejoined Vi∣valdi,
“that I know not either the name
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
or the condition of my informer, and
that I never even beheld his face, till the
period when he spoke of father Schedoni.”</P>
<P>“Tremble!” repeated the same low,
but emphatic voice in his ear. Vivaldi
started, and turned involuntarily towards
the found, though his eyes could not as∣sist
his curiosity.</P>
<P>“You did well to say, that you had
something extraordinary to add,” ob∣served
the inquisitor. “'Tis evident,
also, that you expected something extra∣ordinary
from your judges, since you
supposed they would credit these asser∣tions”.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was too proud to attempt the jus∣tisying
himself against so gross an accu∣sation,
or to make any reply.</P>
<P>“Why do you not summon father Ansaldo?”
said the voice. “Remember
my words!”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, again awed by the voice, he∣sitated,
for an instant, how to act, and
in that instant his courage returned.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196"/>
“My informer stands beside me!” said
Vivaldi, boldly; “I know his voice!
Detain him; it is of consequence.”</P>
<P>“Whose voice?” demanded the inqui∣sitor.
“No person spoke but myself!”</P>
<P>“Whose voice?” said the vicar-gene∣ral.</P>
<P>“The voice was close beside me,” re∣plied
Vivaldi. “It spoke low, but I
knew it well.”</P>
<P>“This is either the cunning, or the
frenzy of despair!” observed the vicar∣general.</P>
<P>“Not any person is now beside you,
except the familiars,” said the inquisitor,
“and they wait to do their office, if you
shall resuse to answer the questions put
to you.”</P>
<P>“I persist in my assertion,” replied Vi∣valdi;
“and I supplicate that my eyes
may be unbound, that I may know my
enemy.”</P>
<P>The tribunal, after a long private con∣sultation,
granted the request; the veil
<PB N="196" REF="197"/>
was withdrawn, and Vivaldi, perceived
beside him—only the familiars! Their
faces, as is usual, were concealed. It
appeared that one of these torturers must
be the mysterious enemy, who pursued
him, if, indeed, that enemy was an in∣habitant
of the earth! and Vivaldi re∣quested
that they might be ordered to
uncover their features. He was sternly
rebuked for so presumptuous a requisition,
and reminded of the inviolable law and
faith, which the tribunal had pledged,
that persons appointed to their awful of∣fice
should never be exposed to the re∣venge
of the criminal, whom it might be
their duty to punish.</P>
<P>“Their duty!” exclaimed Vivaldi,
thrown from his guard by strong indigna∣tion.
“And is faith held sacred with de∣mons!”</P>
<P>Without awaiting the order of the tri∣bunal,
the familiars immediately covered
Vivaldi's face with the veil, and he felt
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
himself in their grasp. He endeavoured,
however, to disentangle his hands, and,
at length, shook these men from, their
hold, and again unveiled his eyes; but
the familiars were instantly ordered to re∣place
the veil.</P>
<P>The inquisitor bade Vivaldi to recollect
in whose presence he then was, and to
dread the punishment which his resistance
had incurred, and which would be in∣flicted
without delay, unless he could
give some instance, that might tend to
prove the truth of his late assertions.</P>
<P>“If you expect that I should say
more,” replied Vivaldi, “I claim, at
least, protection from the unbidden vio∣lence
of the men who guard me. If
they are suffered, at their pleasure, to
sport with the misery of their prisoner, I
will be inflexibly silent; and, since I must
suffer, it shall be according to the laws
of the tribunal.”</P>
<P>The vicar-general, or, as he is called,
the grand inquisitor, promised Vivaldi
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
the degree of protection he claimed, and
demanded, at the same time, what were
the words he had just heard.</P>
<P>Vivaldi considered, that, though jus∣tice
bade him avoid accusing an enemy
of suspicious circumstances, concerning
which he had no proof, yet, that neither
justice nor common sense required he
should make a sacrifice of himself to the
dilemma, in which he was placed: he,
therefore, without further scruple, ac∣knowledged,
that the voice had bidden him
require of the tribunal to summon one
father Ansaldo, the grand penitentiary
of the Santa del Pianto, near Naples,
and also father Schedoni, who was to an∣swer
to extraordinary charges, which
would be brought, against him by An∣saldo.
Vivaldi anxiously and repeatedly
declared, that he knew not the nature of
the charges, nor that any just grounds for
them existed.</P>
<P>These assertions seemed to throw the
tribunal into new perplexity. Vivaldi
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
heard their busy voices in low debate,
which continued for a considerable time.
In this interval, he had leisure to perceive
the many improbabilities that either of the
familiars should be the stranger who so my∣steriously
haunted him; and among these
was the circumstance of his having resided
so long at Naples.</P>
<P>The tribunal, after some time had
clapsed in consultation, proceeded on the
examination, and Vivaldi was asked what
he knew of father Ansaldo. He imme∣diately
replied, that Ansaldo was an utter
stranger to him, and that he was not even
acquainted with a single person residing in
the Santa del Pianto or who had any
knowledge of the penitentiary.</P>
<P>“How!” said the grand inquisitor.
“You forget that the person, who bade
you require of this tribunal to summon
Ansaldo, has knowledge of him.”</P>
<P>“Pardon me, I do not forget,” re∣plied
Vivaldi; “and I request it may be
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
remembered that I am not acquainted
with that person. If, therefore, he had
given me any account of Ansaldo, I could
not have relied upon its authenticity.”
Vivaldi again required of the tribunal to
understand that he did not summon An∣saldo,
or any other person, before them,
but had merely obeyed their command, to
repeat what the stranger had said.</P>
<P>The tribunal acknowledged the justness
of this injunction, and exculpated him from
any harm that should be the consequence
of the summons. But this assurance of safety
for himself was not sufficient to appease
Vivaldi, who was alarmed lest he should
be the means of bringing an innocent
person under suspicion. The grand in∣quisitor
again addressed him, after a gene∣ral
silence had been commanded in the
court.</P>
<P>“The account you have given of your
informer,” said he, “is so extraordinary,
that it would not deserve credit, but that
<PB N="201" REF="202"/>
you have discovered the utmost reluctance
to reveal the charges he gave you, from
which, it appears, that, on your part, at
least, the summons is not malicious. But
are you certain that you have not deluded
yourself, and that the voice beside you
was not an imaginary one, conjured up
by your agitated spirits?”</P>
<P>“I am certain,” replied Vivaldi, with
firmness.</P>
<P>“It is true,” resumed the grand inqui∣sitor,
“that several persons were near
you, when you exclaimed, that you heard
the voice of your informer; yet no person
heard it besides yourself!”</P>
<P>“Where are those persons now?” de∣manded
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“They, are dispersed; alarmed at your
accusation.”</P>
<P>“If you will summon them,” said Vi∣valdi,
“and order that my eyes may be
uncovered, I will point out to you, with∣out
hesitation, the person of my informer,
should he remain among, them.”</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203"/>
The tribunal commanded that they
should appear, but new difficulties arose.
It was not remembered of whom the
crowd consisted; a few individuals only
were recollected, and these were sum∣moned.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, in solemn expectation, heard
steps and the hum of voices gathering
round him, and impatiently awaited for
the words that would restore him to sight,
and, perhaps, release him from uncer∣tainty.
In a few moments, he heard the
command given; the veil was once more
removed from his eyes, and he was or∣dered
to point out the accuser. Vivaldi
threw an hasty glance upon the surround∣ing
strangers.</P>
<P>“The lights burn dimly,” said he, “I
cannot distinguish these faces.”</P>
<P>It was ordered that a lamp should be
lowered from the roof, and that the
strangers should arrange themselves on ei∣ther
side of Vivaldi. When this was done,
<PB N="203" REF="204"/>
and he glanced his eyes again upon the
crowd, “He is not here!” said Vivaldi;
“not one of these countenances resem∣bles
the monk of Paluzzi. Yet, stay;
who is he that stands in the shade behind
those persons on the left? Bid him lift
his cowl!”</P>
<P>The crowd fell back, and the person, to
whom Vivaldi had pointed, was left alone
within the circle.</P>
<P>“He is an officer of the Inquisition,”
said a man near Vivaldi, “and he may
not be compelled to discover his face, un∣less
by an express command from the tri∣bunal.”</P>
<P>“I call upon the tribunal to command
it!” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Who calls!” exclaimed a voice, and
Vivaldi recognized the tones of the monk,
but he knew not exactly, whence they,
came.</P>
<P>“I Vincentio di Vivaldi,” replied the
prisoner, “I claim the privilege that has
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
been awarded me, and bid you unveil
your countenance.”</P>
<P>There was a pause of silence in the
court, except that a dull murmur ran
through the tribunal. Meanwhile, the
figure within the circle stood motionless,
and remained veiled.</P>
<P>“Spare him,” said the man, who had
before addressed Vivaldi; “he has rea∣sons
for wishing to remain unknown,
which you cannot conjecture. He is an
officer of the Inquisition, and not the
person you apprehend.”</P>
<P>“Perhaps I <HI>can</HI> conjecture his rea∣sons,”
replied Vivaldi, who, raising his
voice, added, “I appeal to this tribunal,
and command you, who stand alone
within the circle, you in black garments,
to unveil your features!”</P>
<P>Immediately a loud voice issued from
the tribunal, and said,</P>
<P>“We command you, in the name of
the most holy Inquisition, to reveal your∣self!”</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206"/>
The stranger trembled, but, without pre∣suming
to hesitate, uplifted his cowl. Vi∣valdi's
eyes were eagerly fixed upon him;
but the action disclosed, not the counte∣nance
of the monk! but of an official
whom he recollected to have seen once
before, though exactly on what occasion
he did not now remember.</P>
<P>“This is not my informer!” said Vi∣valdi,
turning from him with deep disap∣pointment,
while the stranger dropped his
cowl, and the crowd closed upon him.
At the assertion of Vivaldi, the members
of the tribunal looked upon each other
doubtingly, and were silent, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill the
grand inquisitor, waving his hand, as if
to command attention, addressed Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“It appears, then, that you <HI>have</HI> for∣merly
seen the face of your informer!”</P>
<P>“I have already declared so,” replied
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>The grand inquisitor demanded when,
and where, he had seen it.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207"/>
“Last night, and in my prison,” an∣swered
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“In your prison!” said the ordinary
inquisitor, contemptuously, who had be∣fore
examined him, “and in your dreams,
too, no doubt!”</P>
<P>“In your prison!” exclaimed several
members of the lower tribunal.</P>
<P>“He dreams still!” observed an in∣quisitor.
“Holy fathers! he abuses your
patience, and the frenzy of terror has de∣luded
his credulity. We neglect the mo∣ments.”</P>
<P>“We must inquire further into this,”
said another inquisitor. “Here is some
deception. If you, Vincentio di Vivaldi,
have asserted a falshood—tremble!”</P>
<P>Whether Vivaldi's memory still vi∣brated
with the voice of the monk, or
that the tone in which this same word
was now pronounced did resemble it, he
almost started, when the inquisitor had
said <HI>tremble!</HI> and he demanded who spoke
then.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208"/>
“It is ourself,” answered the inquisitor.</P>
<P>After a short conversation among the
members of the tribunal, the grand inqui∣sitor
gave orders that the centinels, who
had watched on the preceding night at
the prison door of Vivaldi, should be
brought into the hall of justice. The
persons, who had been lately summoned
into the chamber, were now bidden to
withdraw, and all further examination
was suspended till the arrival of the centi∣nels;
Vivaldi heard only the low voices
of the inquisitors, as they conversed pri∣vately
together, and he remained silent,
thoughtful, and amazed.</P>
<P>When the centinels appeared, and
were asked who had entered the prison of
Vivaldi during the last night, they de∣clared,
without hesitation, or confusion,
that not any person had passed through
the door after the hour when the prisoner
had returned from examination, till the
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
following morning, when the guard had
carried in the usual allowance of bread
and water. In this assertion, they per∣sisted,
without the least equivocation,
notwithstanding which they were ordered
into confinement, till the affair should
be cleared up.</P>
<P>The doubts, however, which were ad∣mitted,
as to the integrity of these men,
did not contribute to dissipate those, which
had prevailed over the opposite side of
the question. On the contrary, the sus∣picions
of the tribunal, augmenting with
their perplexity, seemed to fluctuate
equally over every point of the subject
before them, till, instead of throwing
any light upon the truth, they only served
to involve the whole in deeper obscurity.
More doubtful than before of the honesty
of Vivaldi's extraordinary assertions, the
grand inquisitor informed him, that if,
after further inquiry into this affair, it
should appear he had been trifling with
<PB N="209" REF="210"/>
the credulity of his judges, he would be
severely punished for his audacity; but
that, on the other hand, should there
be reason to believe that the centinels
had failed in their duty, and that some
person had entered his prison during the
night, the tribunal would proceed in a
different manner.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, perceiving that, to be believed,
it was necessary he should be more cir∣cumstantial,
described, with exactness,
the person and appearance of the monk,
without, however, mentioning the po∣niard
which had been exhibited. A pro∣found
silence reigned in the chamber,
while he spoke; it seemed a silence not
merely of attention, but of astonishment.
Vivaldi himself was awed, and, when he
had concluded, almost expected to hear
the voice of the monk uttering defiance,
or threatening vengeance; but all re∣mained
hushed, till the inquisitor, who
had first examined him, said, in a solemn
tone,</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211"/>
“We have listened with attention to
what you have delivered, and will give
the case a full inquiry. Some points, on
which you have touched, excite our
amazement, and call for particular re∣gard.
Retire whence you came—and
sleep this night without fear:—<HI>you will
soon know more.”</HI></P>
<P>Vivaldi was immediately led from the
chamber, and, still blindfolded, re-con∣ducted
to the prison to which he had sup∣posed
it was designed he should return
no more. When the veil was with∣drawn,
he perceived that his guard was
changed.</P>
<P>Again left to the silence of his cell,
he reviewed all that had passed in
the chamber of justice; the questions
which had been put to him; the different
manners of the inquisitors; the occur∣rence
of the monk's voice; and the simi∣larity,
which he had fancied he perceived
between it and that of an inquisitor, when
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
the latter pronounced the word <HI>tremble;</HI>
but the consideration of all these circum∣stances
did not in any degree relieve him
from his perplexity. Sometimes he was
inclined to think that the monk was an
inquisitor, and the voice had more than
once appeared to proceed from the tribu∣nal;
but he remembered, also, that,
more than once, it had spoken close to
his ear, and he knew that a member of
this tribunal might not leave his station
during the examination of a prisoner,
and that, even if he had dared to do so,
his singular dress would have pointed
him out to notice, and consequently to
suspicion, at the moment when Vivaldi
had exclaimed, that he heard the voice
of his informer.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, however, could not avoid me∣ditating,
with surprize, on the last words
which the inquisitor, who had been his
chief examiner, had addressed to him,
when he was dismissed from before the
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
tribunal. These were the more surpriz∣ing,
because they were the first from him
that had in any degree indicated a wish to
console or quiet the alarm of the priso∣ner;
and Vivaldi even fancied that they
betrayed some fore-knowledge that he
would not be disturbed this night by the
presence of his awful visitor. He would
entirely have ceased to apprehend, though
not to expect, had he been allowed a
light, and any weapon of defence, if, in
truth, the stranger was of a nature to fear
a weapon; but, to be thus exposed to the
designs of a mysterious and powerful be∣ing,
whom he was conscious of having
offended, to sustain such a situation,
without suffering anxiety, required some∣what
more than courage, or less than
reason.</P>

<BIBL>CARACTACUS.</BIBL>
<P>IN consequence of what had transpired at
the last examination of Vivaldi, the grand
penitentiary Ansaldo, together with the
father Schedoni, were cited to appear be∣fore
the table of the holy office.</P>
<P>Schedoni was arrested on his way to
Rome, whither he was going privately to
make further efforts for the liberation of
Vivaldi, whose release he had found it
more difficult to effect, than his imprison∣ment;
the person upon whose assistance
the Confessor relied in the first instance,
having boasted of more influence than he
possessed, or perhaps thought it prudent
<PB N="214" REF="215"/>
to exert. Schedoni had been the more
anxious to procure an immediate release
for Vivaldi, lest a report of his situation
should reach his family, notwithstanding
the precautions, which are usually em∣ployed
to throw an impenetrable shrowd
over the prisoners of this dreadful tribu∣nal,
and bury them for ever from the
knowledge of their friends. Such prema∣ture
discovery of Vivaldi's circumstances,
Schedoni apprehended might include also
a discovery of the persecutor, and draw
down upon himself the abhorrence and
the vengeance of a family, whom it was
now, more than ever, his wish and his
interest to conciliate. It was still his in∣tention,
that the nuptials of Vivaldi and
Ellena should be privately solemnized
immediately on the release of the prisoner,
who, even if he had reason to suspect
Schedoni for his late persecutor, would
then be interested in concealing his suspi∣cions
for ever, and from whom therefore,
no evil was to be apprehended.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="216"/>
How little did Vivaldi foresee, that
in repeating to the tribunal the stran∣ger's
summons of father Schedoni, he
was deferring, or, perhaps, wholly pre∣venting
his own marriage with Ellena
di Rosalba! How little, also, did he
apprehend what would be the further
consequences of a disclosure, which the
peculiar circumstances of his situation
had hardly permitted him to withhold,
though, could he have understood the
probable event of it, he would have
braved all the terrors of the tribunal, and
death itself, rather than incur the remorse
of having promoted it.</P>
<P>The motive for his arrestation was
concealed from Schedoni, who had not
the remotest suspicion of its nature, but
attributed the arrest, to a discovery, which
the tribunal had made of his being the
accuser of Vivaldi. This disclosure he
attributed to his own imprudence, in
having stated, as an instance of Vivaldi's
<PB N="216" REF="217"/>
contempt for the Catholic faith, that he
had insulted a priest while doing penance
in the church of the Spirito Santo. But
by what art the tribunal had discovered
that he was the priest alluded to, and the
author of the accusation, Schedoni could
by no means conjecture. He was willing
to believe that this arrest was only for the
purpose of obtaining proof of Vivaldi's
guilt; and the Confessor knew that he
could so conduct himself in evidence, as
in all probability to exculpate the prisoner,
from whom, when he should explain him∣self,
no resentment on account of his for∣mer
conduct was to be apprehended. Yet
Schedoni was not perfectly at case; for it
was possible that a knowledge of Vivaldi's
situation, and of the author of it, had
reached his family, and had produced his
own arrest. On this head, however, his
fears were not powerful; since, the longer
he dwelt upon the subject, the more impro∣bable
it appeared that such a disclosure.
<PB N="217" REF="218"/>
at least so far as it related to himself, could
have been affected.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, from the night of his late exa∣mination,
was not called upon, till Sche∣doni
and father Ansaldo appeared together
in the hall of the tribunal. The two
latter had already been separately exa∣mined,
and Ansaldo had privately stated
the particulars of the confession he had
received on the vigil of the Santo Marco,
in the year 1752, for which disclosure he
had received formal absolution. What
had passed at that examination does not
appear, but on this his second interroga∣tion,
he was required to repeat the subject
and the circumstances of the confession.
This was probably with a view of obser∣ving
its effect upon Schedoni and on Vi∣valdi,
which would direct the opinion of
the tribunal as to the guilt of the Confessor,
and the veracity of the young prisoner.</P>
<P>On this night a very exact inquiry was
made, concerning every person, who had
<PB N="218" REF="219"/>
obtained admission into the hall of jus∣tice;
such officials as were not im∣mediately
necessary to assist in the cere∣monies
of the tribunal were excluded,
together with every other person belong∣ing
to the Inquisition not material to the
evidence, or to the judges. When this
scrutiny was over, the prisoners were
brought in, and their conductors ordered
to withdraw. A silence of some moments
prevailed in the hall; and, however dif∣ferent
might be the reflections of the
several prisoners, the degree of anxious
expectation was in each, probably, nearly
the same,</P>
<P>The grand-vicar having spoken a few
words in private to a person on his left
hand, an inquisitor rose.</P>
<P>“If any person in this court,” said he,
“is known by the name of father Sche∣doni,
belonging to the Dominican society
of the Spirito Santo at Naples, let him
appear!”</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220"/>
Schedoni answered to the summons.
He came forward with a firm step, and,
having crossed himself, and bowed to the
tribunal, awaited in silence its commands.</P>
<P>The penitentiary Ansaldo was next
called upon. Vivaldi observed that he
faultered as he advanced; and that his
obeisance to the tribunal was more pro∣found
than Schedoni's had been. Vivaldi
himself was then summoned; his air was
calm and dignified, and his countenance
expressed the solemn energy of his feelings,
but nothing of dejection.</P>
<P>Schedoni and Ansaldo were now, for
the first time, confronted. Whatever
might be the feelings of Schedoni on be∣holding
the penitentiary of the <HI>Santa del
Pianto,</HI> he effectually concealed them.</P>
<P>The grand-vicar himself opened the
examination, “You, father Schedoni, of
the Spirito Santo,” he said, “answer and
say, whether the person who now stands
before you, bearing the title of grand
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>
penitentiary of the order of the <HI>Black
Penitents,</HI> and presiding over the convent
of the <HI>Santa Maria del Pianto</HI> at Naples, is
known to you.</P>
<P>To this requisition Schedoni replied with
firmness in the negative.</P>
<P>“You have never, to your knowledge,
seen him before this hour?”</P>
<P>“Never!” said Schedoni.</P>
<P>“Let the oath be administered,” added
the grand-vicar. Schedoni having ac∣cepted
it; the same questions were put to
Ansaldo concerning the Confessor, when,
to the astonishment of Vivaldi and of the
greater part of the court, the penitentiary
denied all knowledge of Schedoni. His
negative was given, however, in a less
decisive manner than that of the Confessor,
and when the usual oath was offered,
Ansaldo declined to accept it.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was next called upon to identify
Schedoni▪ he declared, that the person
who was then pointed out to him, he had
<PB N="221" REF="222"/>
never known by any other denomination
than that of father Schedoni; and that he
had always understood him to be a monk
of the Spirito Santo; but Vivaldi was at
the same time careful to repeat, that he
knew nothing further relative to his life.</P>
<P>Schedoni was somewhat surprized at
this apparent candour of Vivaldi towards
him∣self, but accustomed to impute an evil
motive to all conduct, which he could not
clearly comprehend, he did not scruple to
believe, that some latent mischief was
directed against him in this seemingly
honest declaration.</P>
<P>After some further preliminary forms
had passed, Ansaldo was ordered to relate
the particulars of the confession, which
had been made to him on the eve of the
Santo Marco. It must be remembered,
that this was still what is called in the
Inquisition, a <HI>private</HI> examination.</P>
<P>After he had taken the customary oaths
to relate neither more nor less than the
<PB N="222" REF="223"/>
truth of what had passed before him, An∣saldo's
depositions were written down
nearly in the following words; to which
Vivaldi listened with almost trembling at∣tention,
for, besides the curiosity which
some previous circumstances had excited
respecting them, he believed that his own
fate in a great measure depended upon a
discovery of the fact to which they led.
What, if he had surmised how much! and
that the person, whom he had been in
some degree instrumental in citing before
this tremendous tribunal, was the father
of his Ellena di Rosalba!</P>
<P>Ansaldo, having again answered to his
name and titles, gave his deposition as
follows:</P>
<P>“It was on the eve of the twenty∣fifth
of April, and in the year 1752, that
as I sat, according to my custom, in the
confessional of San Marco, I was alarm∣ed
by deep groans, which came from the
box on my left hand.”</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224"/>
Vivaldi observed, that the date now
mentioned agreed with that recorded by
the stranger, and he was thus prepared
to believe what might follow, and to give
his confidence to this extraordinary and
unseen personage.</P>
<P>Ansaldo continued, “I was the more
alarmed by these sounds, because I had
not been prepared for them; I knew not
that any person was in the confessional,
nor had even observed any one pass along
the aisle—but the duskiness of the hour
may account for my having failed to do
so; it was after sun-set, and the tapers at
the shrine of San Antonio as yet burned
feebly in the twilight.”</P>
<P>“Be brief, holy father,” said the in∣quisitor
who had formerly been most ac∣tive
in examining Vivaldi; “speak closely
to the point.”</P>
<P>“The groans would sometimes cease,”
resumed Ansaldo, “and long pauses of
silence follow; they were those of a soul
<PB N="224" REF="225"/>
in agony, struggling with the consciousness
of guilt, yet wanting resolution to confess
it. I tried to encourage the penitent, and
held forth every hope of mercy and for∣giveness
which my duty would allow,
but for a considerable time without effect;—
the enormity of the sin seemed too big
for utterance, yet the penitent appeared
equally unable to endure the concealment
of it. His heart was bursting with the
secret, and required the comfort of ab∣solution,
even at the price of the severest
penance.”</P>
<P>“Facts!” said the inquisitor, “these
are are only surmises.”</P>
<P>“Facts will come full soon!” replied
Ansaldo, and bowed his head, “the men∣tion
of them will petrify you, holy fathers!
as they did me, though not for the same
reasons. While I endeavoured to encou∣rage
the penitent, and assured him, that
absolution should follow the acknowledg∣ment
of his crimes, however heinous those
<PB N="225" REF="226"/>
crimes might be, if accompanied by sin∣cere
repentance, he more than once began
his confession, and abruptly dropt it.
Once, indeed, he quitted the confessional;
his agitated spirit required liberty; and it
was then, as he walked with perturbed
steps along the aisle, that I first observed
his figure. He was in the habit of a white
friar, and, as nearly as I can recollect,
was about the stature of him, the father
Schedoni, who now stands before me.”</P>
<P>As Ansaldo delivered these words, the
attention of the whole tribunal was turned
upon Schedoni, who stood unmoved, and
with his eyes bent towards the ground.</P>
<P>“His face,” continued the penitentiary,
“I did not fee; he was, with good reason,
careful to conceal it; other resemblance,
therefore, than the stature, I cannot
point out between them. The voice, in∣deed,
the voice of the penitent, I think I
shall never forget; I should know it again
at any distance of time.”</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="227"/>
“Has it not struck your ear, since you
came within these walls?” said a member
of the tribunal.</P>
<P>“Of that hereafter,” observed the in∣quisitor, “you wander from the point,
father.”</P>
<P>The vicar-general remarked, that the
circumstances just related were important,
and ought not to be passed over as irrele∣vant.
The inquisitor submitted to this
opinion, but objected that they were not
pertinent to the moment; and Ansaldo
was again bidden to repeat what he had
heard at confession.</P>
<P>“When the stranger returned to the
steps of the confessional, he had acquired
sufficient resolution to go through with the
task he had imposed upon himself, and
a thrilling voice spoke through the grate
the facts I am about to relate.”</P>
<P>Father Ansaldo paused, and was some∣what
agitated; he seemed endeavouring
to recollect courage to go through with
<PB N="227" REF="228"/>
what he had begun. During this pause,
the silence of expectation rapt the court,
and the eyes of the tribunal were directed
alternately to Ansaldo and Schedoni, who
certainly required something more than
human firmness to support unmoved the
severe scrutiny, and the yet severer suspi∣cions,
to which he stood exposed. Whe∣ther,
however, it was the fortitude of
conscious innocence, or the hardihood of
atrocious vice, that protected the Confessor,
he certainly did not betray any emotion.
Vivaldi, who had unceasingly observed
him from the commencement of the de∣positions,
felt inclined to believe that he
was not the penitent described. Ansaldo,
having, at length, recollected himself,
proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>“I have been through life,” said the
penitent, “the slave of my passions, and
they have led me into horrible excesses. I
had once a brother!”—He stopped, and deep
groans again told the agony of his soul;
<PB N="228" REF="229"/>
at length, he added—“That brother
had a wife!—Now listen, father, and say,
whether guilt like mine may hope for ab∣solution!
She was beautiful—I loved her;
she was virtuous, and I despaired. You,
father,” he continued in a frightful tone,
'never knew the fury of despair! It
overcame or communicated its own force
to every other passion of my soul, and I
sought to release myself from its tortures
by any means. My brother died!'—The
penitent paused again,” continued Ansaldo,
“I trembled while I listened; my lips were
sealed. At length, I bade him proceed,
and he spoke as follows.—'My brother died
at a distance from home.'—Again the peni∣tent,
paused, and the silence continued so
long, that I thought it proper to inquire
of what disorder the brother had expired.
“Father, I was his murderer!” said the pe∣nitent
in a voice which I never can forget;
it sunk into my heart.”</P>
<P>Ansaldo appeared affected by the re∣membrance,
and was for a moment silent.
<PB N="229" REF="230"/>
At the last words Vivaldi had particularly
noticed Schedoni, that he might judge by
their effect upon him, whether he was
guilty; but he remained in his former atti∣tude,
and his eyes were still fixed upon the
ground.</P>
<P>“Proceed, father!” said the inquisitor,
“what was your reply to this confession?”</P>
<P>“I was silent,” said Ansaldo “but at
length I bade the penitent go on. “I con∣trived
said he, that my brother should die
at a distance from home, and I so con∣ducted
the affair, that his widow never
suspected the cause of his death. It was not
till long after the usual time of mourning
had expired, that I ventured to solicit her
hand: but she had not yet forgotten my
brother, and she rejected me. My passion
would no longer be trifled with. I caused
her to be carried from her house, and she
was afterwards willing to retrieve her
honour by the marriage vow. I had sa∣crificed
my conscience, without having
<PB N="230" REF="231"/>
sound happiness;—she did not even
condescend to conceal her disdain. Mor∣tified,
exasperated by her conduct, I be∣gun
to suspect that some other emotion
than resentment occasioned this disdain;
and last of all jealousy—jealousy came to
crown my mifery—to light up all my pas∣sions
into madness!'</P>
<P>“The penitent,” added Ansaldo, “ap∣peared
by the manner in which he uttered
this, to be nearly frantic at the moment,
and convulsive sobs soon stifled his words.
When he resumed his confession, he said,
'I soon sound an object for my jealousy.
Among the few persons, who visited us in
the retirement of our country residence,
was a gentleman, who, I fancied, loved
my wife; I fancied too, that, whenever he
appeared, an air of particular satisfaction
was visible on her countenance. She
seemed to have pleasure in conversing;
with, and shewing him distinction. I even
sometimes thought, she had pride in dis∣playing
<PB N="231" REF="232"/>
to me the preserence she enter∣tained
for him, and that an air of triumph,
and even of scorn, was addressed to me,
whenever she mentioned his name. Per∣haps,
I mistook resentment for love, and
she only wished to punish me, by exciting
my jealousy. Fatal error! she punished
herself also!”</P>
<P>“Be less circumstantial, father,” said
the inquisitor.</P>
<P>Ansaldo bowed his head, and continued.
“One evening,” continued the penitent,
'that I returned home unexpectedly, I was
told that a visitor was with my wife! As I
approached the apartment where they sat,
I heard the voice of Sacchi; it seemed
mournful and supplicating. I stopped to
listen, and distinguished enough to fire
me with vengeance. I restrained myself,
however, so far as to step softly to a lattice
that opened from the passage, and over∣looked
the apartment. The traitor was
on his knee before her. Whether she had
<PB N="232" REF="233"/>
heard my step, or observed my face,
through the high lattice, or that she re∣sented
his conduct, I know not, but she
rose immediately from her chair. I did
not pause to question her motive; but,
seizing my stiletto, I rushed into the
room, with intent to strike it to the vil∣lain's
heart. The supposed assassin of my
honour escaped into the garden, and was
heard of no more.'—But your wife? said
I. “Her bosom received the poniard!”
replied the penitent.”</P>
<P>Ansaldo's voice faultered, as he repeat∣ed
this part of the confession, and he was
utterly unable to proceed. The tribunal,
observing his condition, allowed him a
chair, and, after a struggle of some mo∣ments,
he added, “Think, holy fathers,
O think! what must have been my feel∣ings
at that instant! I was myself the lo∣ver
of the woman, whom he, confessed
himself to have murdered.”</P>
<P>“Was she innocent?” said a voice;
and Vivaldi, whose attention had latterly
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>
been fixed upon Ansaldo, now, on look∣ing,
at Schedoni, perceived that it was he
who had spoken. At the sound of his
voice, the penitentiary turned instantly
towards him. There was a pause of ge∣neral
silence, during which Ansaldo's eyes
were earnestly fixed upon the accused.
At length, he spoke, “She was inno∣cent!”
He replied, with solemn empha∣sis,
“She was most virtuous!”</P>
<P>Schedoni had shrunk back within him∣self;
he asked no further. A murmur
ran through the tribunal, which rose by
degrees, till it broke forth into audible
conversation; at length, the secretary was
directed to note the question of Sche∣doni.</P>
<P>“Was that the voice of the penitent,
which you have just heard?” demanded
the inquisitor of Ansaldo. “Remember,
you have said that you should know it
again!”</P>
<P>“I think it was,” replied Ansaldo:
“but I cannot swear to that.”</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235"/>
“What infirmity of judgment is this!”
said the same inquisitor, who himself was
seldom troubled with the modesty of
doubt, upon any subject. Ansaldo was
bidden to resume the narrative.</P>
<P>“On this discovery of the murderer,”
said the penitentiary, “I quitted the con∣fessional,
and my senses forsook me before
I could deliver orders for the detection of
the assassin. When I recovered, it was
too late; he had escaped! From that
hour to the present, I have never seen
him, nor dare I affirm that the person
now before me is he.”</P>
<P>The inquisitor was about to speak, but
the grand-vicar waved his hand, as a sig∣nal
for attention, and, addressing An∣saldo,
said, “Although you may be un∣acquainted
with Schedoni, the monk of
the Spirito Santo, reverend father, can
you not recollect the person of the Count
di Bruno, your former friend?”</P>
<P>Ansaldo again looked at Schedoni, with
a serutinizing eye; he fixed it long; but
<PB N="235" REF="236"/>
the countenance of Schedoni suffered no
change.</P>
<P>“No!” said the penitentiary, at length,
“I dare not take upon me to assert, that
this is the Count di Bruno. If it is he,
years have wrought deeply on his fea∣tures.
That the penitent was the Count
di Bruno I have proof; he mentioned my
name as his visitor, and particular cir∣cumstances
known only to the Count and
myself; but that father Schedoni was the
penitent, I repeat it, I dare not affirm.”</P>
<P>“But that dare I!” said another voice;
and Vivaldi, turning towards it, beheld
the mysterious stranger advancing, his
cowl now thrown back, and an air of
menace overspreading every terrific fea∣ture.
Schedoni, in the instant that he
perceived him, seemed agitated; his coun∣tenance,
for the first time, suffered some
change.</P>
<P>The tribunal was profoundly silent, but
surprize, and a kind of restless expecta∣tion,
<PB N="236" REF="237"/>
marked every brow. Vivaldi was
about to exclaim, “That is my infor∣mer!”
when the voice of the stranger
checked him.</P>
<P>“Dost thou know me?” said he,
sternly, to Schedoni, and his attitude be∣came
fixed.</P>
<P>Schedoni gave no reply</P>
<P>“Dost thou know me?” repeated his
accuser, in a steady solemn voice.</P>
<P>“Know thee!” uttered Schedoni,
faintly</P>
<P>“Dost thou know this?” cried the
stranger, raising his voice, as he drew
from his garment what appeared to be a
dagger. “Dost thou know these indeli∣ble
stains?” said he, lifting the poniard,
and, with an outstretched arm, pointing
it towards Schedoni.</P>
<P>The Confessor turned away his face;
it seemed as if his heart sickened.</P>
<P>“With this dagger was thy brother
slain!” said the terrible stranger. “Shall
I declare myself?”</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238"/>
Schedoni's courage forsook him, and
he sunk against a pillar of the hall for
support.</P>
<P>The consternation was how general;
the extraordinary appearance and conduct
of the stranger seemed to strike the greater
part of the tribunal, a tribunal of the in∣quisition
itself! with dismay. Several of
the members rose from their seats; others
called aloud for the officials, who kept
guard at the doors of the hall, and inqui∣red
who had admitted the stranger, while
the vicar-general and a few inquisitors
conversed privately together, during which
they frequently looked at the stranger and
at Schedoni, as if they were the subjects
of the discourse. Meanwhile the monk
remained with the dagger in his grasp,
and his eyes fixed on the Confessor, whose
face was still averted, and who yet sup∣ported
himself against the pillar.</P>
<P>At length, the vicar-general called up∣on
the members who had arisen to return
<PB N="238" REF="239"/>
to their seats, and ordered that the offi∣cials
should withdraw to their posts.</P>
<P>“Holy brethren!” said the vicar, “we
recommend to you, at this important hour,
silence and deliberation. Let the exami∣nation
of the accused proceed; and here∣after
let us inquire as to the admittance of
the accuser. For the present, suffer him
also to have hearing, and the father Sche∣doni
to reply.</P>
<P>“We suffer him!” answered the tri∣bunal,
and bowed their heads.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who, during the tumult, had
ineffectually endeavoured to make him∣self
heard, now profited by the pause
which followed the assent of the inquisi∣tors,
to claim attention: but the instant
he spoke several members impatiently
bade that the examination should pro∣ceed,
and the grand-vicar was again
obliged to command silence, before the
request of Vivaldi could be understood.
Permission to speak being granted him,
<PB N="239" REF="240"/>
“That person,” said he, pointing to the
stranger, “is the same who visited me in
my prison; and the dagger the same he
now displays! It was he, who com∣manded
me to summon the penitentiary
Ansaldo, and the father Schedoni. I have
acquitted myself, and have nothing fur∣ther
to do in this struggle.”</P>
<P>The tribunal was again agitated, and
the murmurs of private conversation again
prevailed. Meanwhile Schedoni appeared
to have recovered some degree of self-com∣mand;
he raised himself, and, bowing to
the tribunal, seemed preparing to speak;
but waited till the confusion of sound that
filled the hall should subside. At length
he could be heard, and, addressing the
tribunal, he said,</P>
<P>Holy fathers! the stranger who is
now before you is an impostor! I will
prove that my accuser was once my friend;
—you may perceive how much the dis∣covery
of his perfidy affects me. The
<PB N="240" REF="241"/>
charge he brings is most false and mali∣cious!”</P>
<P>“<HI>Once</HI> thy friend!” replied the stran∣ger,
with peculiar emphasis, “and what
has made me thy enemy! View these
spots,” he continued, pointing to the
blade of the poniard, “are they also
false and malicious? are they not, on the
contrary, reflected on thy conscience?”</P>
<P>“I know them not,” replied Schedoni,
“my conscience is unstained.”</P>
<P>“A brother's blood <HI>has</HI> stained it!”
said the stranger, in a hollow voice.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, whose attention was now fixed
upon Schedoni, observed a livid hue over∣spread
his complexion, and that his eyes
were averted from this extraordinary per∣son
with horror: the spectre of his de∣ceased
brother could scarcely have called
forth a stronger expression. It was not
immediately that he could command his
voice; when he could, he again appealed
to the tribunal.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="242"/>
“Holy fathers!” said he, “suffer me
to defend myself.”</P>
<P>“Holy fathers!” said the accuser, with
solemnity, “hear! hear what I shall un∣fold!”</P>
<P>Schedoni, who seemed to speak by a
strong effort only, again addressed the in∣quisitors;
“I will prove,” said he, “that
this evidence is not of a nature to be
trusted.”</P>
<P>“I will bring <HI>such</HI> proof to the con∣trary!”
said the monk. “And here,”
pointing to Ansaldo, “is sufficient testi∣mony
that the Count di Bruno did confess
himself guilty of murder.”</P>
<P>The court commanded silence, and
upon the appeal of the stranger to An∣saldo,
the penitentiary was asked whether
he knew him. He replied, that he did
not.</P>
<P>“Recollect yourself,” said the grand
inquisitor, “it is of the utmost conse∣quence
that you should be correct on this
point.”</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="243"/>
The penitentiary observed the stranger
with deep attention, and then repeated
his assertion.</P>
<P>“Have you never seen him before?”
said an inquisitor.</P>
<P>“Never, to my knowledge!” replied
Ansaldo.</P>
<P>The inquisitors looked upon each other
in silence.</P>
<P>“He speaks the truth,” said the stran∣ger.</P>
<P>This extraordinary fact did not fail to
strike the tribunal, and to astonish Vi∣valdi.
Since the accuser confirmed it,
Vivaldi was at a loss to understand the
means by which he could have become
acquainted with the guilt of Schedoni,
who, it was not to be supposed, would
have acknowledged crimes of such mag∣nitude
as those contained in the accusa∣tion,
to any person, except, indeed, to
his confessor, and this confessor, it ap∣peared,
was so far from having betrayed
<PB N="243" REF="244"/>
his trust to the accuser, that he did not
even know him Vivaldi was no less
perplexed as to what would be the nature
of the testimony, with which the accuser
designed to support his charges: but the
pause of general amazement, which had
permitted Vivaldi these considerations,
was now at an end; the tribunal resumed
the examination, and the grand inquisi∣tor
called aloud,</P>
<P>“You, Vincentio di Vivaldi, answer
with exactness to the questions that shall
be put to you.”</P>
<P>He was then asked some questions rela∣tive
to the person, who had visited him
in prison. In his answers, Vivaldi was
clear and concise, constantly affirming, that
the stranger was the same, who now ac∣cused
Schedoni.</P>
<P>When the accuser was interrogated, he
acknowledged, without hesitation, that
Vivaldi had spoken the truth. He was
then asked his motive for that extraordi∣nary
visit.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="245"/>
“It was,” replied the monk, “that a
murderer might be brought to justice.”</P>
<P>“This,” observed the grand inquisitor,
“might have been accomplished by fair
and open accusasion. If you had known
the charge to be just, it is probable that
you would have appealed directly to this
tribunal, instead of endeavouring insidi∣ously
to obtain an influence over the mind
of a prisoner, and urging him to become
the instrument of bringing the accused to
punishment.”</P>
<P>“Yet I have not shrunk from disco∣very,”
observed the stranger, calmly;
“I have voluntarily appeared.”</P>
<P>At these words, Schedoni seemed again
much agitated, and even drew his hood
over his eyes.</P>
<P>“That is just,” said the grand inquisi∣tor,
addressing the stranger: “but you
have neither declared your name, or
whence you come!”</P>
<P>To this remark the monk made no re∣ply;
but Schedoni, with reviving spirit,
<PB N="245" REF="246"/>
urged the circumstance, in evidence of the
malignity and falshood of the accuser.</P>
<P>“Wilt, thou compel me to reveal my
proof?” said the stranger: “Darest thou
to do so?”</P>
<P>“Why should I fear thee?” answered
Schedoni.</P>
<P>“Ask thy conscienee!” said the stran∣ger,
with a terrible frown.</P>
<P>The tribunal again suspended the exa∣mination,
and consulted in private toge∣ther.</P>
<P>To the last exhortation of the monk,
Schedoni was silent. Vivaldi observed,
that during this short dialogue, the Con∣fessor,
had never once turned his eyes to∣ward's
the stranger, but apparently avoid∣ed
him, as an object too affecting to be
looked upon. He judged, from this cir∣cumstance,
and from some other appear∣ances
in his conduct, that Schedoni was
guilty; yet the consciousness of guilt
alone did, not perfectly account, he
<PB N="246" REF="247"/>
thought, for the strong emotion, with
which he avoided the sight of his accu∣ser
—unless, indeed, he knew that accuser
to have been, not only an accomplice in
his crime, but the actual assassin. In this
case, it appeared natural even for the
stern and subtle Schedoni to betray his
horror, on beholding the person of the
murderer, with the very instrument of
crime in his grasp. On the other hand,
Vivaldi could not but perceive it to be
highly improbable, that the very man
who had really committed the deed should
come voluntarily into a court of justice,
for the purpose of accusing his employer;
that he should dare publicly to accuse
him, whose guilt, however enormous,
was not more so than his own.</P>
<P>The extraordinary manner, also, in
which the accuser had proceeded in the
commencement of the affair, engaged Vi∣valdi's
consideration; his apparent reluc∣tance
<PB N="247" REF="248"/>
to be seen in this process, and the
artful and mysterious plan, by which he
had caused Schedoni to be summoned be∣fore,
the, tribunal, and had endeavoured
that he should be there accused by An∣saldo,
indicated, at least to Vivaldi's, ap∣prehension,
the fearfulness of guilt, and,
still more, that malice, and a thirst of
vengeance, had instigated his conduct in
the prosecution. If the stranger had been
actuated only by a love of justice it ap∣peared
that he would not have proceeded
toward it in a way thus dark and circui∣tous,
but have sought it by the usual pro∣cess,
and have produced the proofs, which
he even now asserted he possessed, of
Schedoni's crimes. In addition to the
circumstances, which seemed to strengthen
a supposition of the guiltlessness of Sche∣doni,
was that of the accuser's avoiding
to acknowledge who he was, and whence
he came. But Vivaldi paused, again upon
this point; it appeared to be inexplicable,
<PB N="248" REF="249"/>
and he could not imagine why the accuser
had adopted a style of secrecy, which, if
he persisted in it, must probably defeat
the very purpose of the accusation; for
Vivaldi did not believe that the tribunal
would, condemn a prisoner upon the tes∣timony
of a person who, when called
upon, should publicly refuse to reveal
himself, even to them. Yet the accuser
must certainly have considered this cir∣cumstance
before he ventured into court;
notwithstanding which, he had appeared!</P>
<P>These reflections led Vivaldi to various
conjectures relative to the visit he had
himself received from the monk, the
dream that had preceded it, the extraor∣dinary
means by which he had obtained
admittance to the prison, the declaration
of the centinels, that not any person had
passed the door, and many other unac∣countable
particulars; and, while Vivaldi
now looked upon the wild physiognomy
of the stranger, he almost fancied, as he
<PB N="249" REF="250"/>
had formerly done, that he beheld some∣thing
hot of this earth.</P>
<P>“I have heard of the spirit of the
murdered,” said he, to himself—“rest∣less
for justice, becoming, visible in our
world—” But Vivaldi checked the im∣perfect
thought, and, though his imagi∣nation
inclined him to the marvellous, and
to admit ideas which, filling and expand∣ing
all the faculties of the soul, produce
feelings that partake of the sublime, he
now resisted the propensity, and dismissed,
as absurd, a supposition, which had begun
to thrill his every nerve with horror. He
awaited, however; the result of the exa∣mination,
and what might be the further
conduct of the stranger, with intense, ex∣pectation.</P>
<P>When the tribunal had, at length,
finally determined an the method of their
proceedings, Schedoni was first called
upon, and examined as to his knowledge
of the accuser. It was the same inquisi∣tor
<PB N="250" REF="251"/>
who had formerly interrogated Vi∣valdi,
that now spoke. “You, father
Schedoni, a monk of the Spirito Santo
convent, at Naples, otherwise Ferando
Count di Bruno, answer to the questions
which shall be put to you. Do you
know the name of this man who. now
appears as your accuser?”</P>
<P>“I answer not to the title of Count
di Bruno,” replied the Confessor, “but I
will declare that I know this man. His
name is Nicola di Zampari.”</P>
<P>“what is his condition?”</P>
<P>“He is a monk of the Dominican con∣vent
of the Spirito Santo,” replied Sche∣doni.
“Of his samily I know little.”</P>
<P>“Where have you seen him?”</P>
<P>“In the city of Naples, where he has
resided, during some years, beneath the
same roof with me, when I was of the
convent of San Angiolo, and since that
time, in the Spirito Santo.”</P>
<P>“You have been a resident at the San
Angiolo?” said the inquisitor.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="252"/>
“I have,” replied Schedoni; “and it
was there that we first lived together in
the confidence of friendship.”</P>
<P>“You now perceive how ill placed
was that confidence,” said the inquisitor,
“and repent, no doubt, of your impru∣dence?”</P>
<P>The wary Schedoni was not entrapped
by this observation.</P>
<P>“I must lament a discovery of ingra∣titude,”
he replied, calmly, “but the
subjects of my confidence were too pure
to give occasion for repentance.”</P>
<P>“This Nicola di Zampari was ungrate∣ful,
then? You had rendered, him ser∣vices?”
said the inquisitor.</P>
<P>“The cause of his enmity I can well
explain,” observed Schedoni, evading,
for the present, the question.</P>
<P>“Explain,” said the stranger, solemnly.</P>
<P>Schedoni hesitated; some sudden con∣sideration
seemed to occasion him per∣plexity.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="253"/>
“I call upon you, in the name of
your deceased brother,” said the accuser,
“to reveal the cause of my enmity!”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, struck by the tone in which
the stranger spoke this, turned his eyes
upon him, but knew not how to interpret
the emotion visible on his countenance.</P>
<P>The inquisitor commanded Schedoni to
explain himself; the latter could not im∣mediately
reply, but, when he recovered
a self-command, he added,</P>
<P>“I promised this accuser, this Nicola
di Zampari, to assist his pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erment, with
what little interest I possessed; it was but
little. Some succeeding circumstances
encouraged me to believe that I could
more than fulfil my promise. His hopes
were elevated, and, in the fulness of ex∣pectation
—he was disappointed, for I was
myself deceived, by the person in whom
I had trusted. To the disappointment of
a choleric man, I am to attribute this un∣just
accusation.”</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="254"/>
Schedoni paused, and an air of dissa∣tisfaction
and anxiety appeared upon his
features. His accuser remained silent,
but a malicious smile announced his
triumph.</P>
<P>“You must declare, also, the ser∣vices,”
said the inquisitor, “which me∣rited
the reward you promised.”</P>
<P>“Those services were inestimable to
me,” resumed Schedoni, after a momen∣tary
hesitation; “though they cost di
Zampari little: they were the consolations
of sympathy, the intelligence of friend∣ship,
which he administered, and which
gratitude told me never could be repaid.”</P>
<P>“Of sympathy! of friendship!” said
the grand-vicar. “Are we to believe
that a man, who brings false accusation of
so dreadful a nature as the one now be∣fore
us, is capable of bestowing the con∣solations
of sympathy, and of friendship?.
You must either acknowledge that ser∣vices
of a less disinterested nature won
<PB N="254" REF="255"/>
your promises of reward; or we must
conclude that your aceuser's charge is
just. Your assertions are inconsistent,
and your explanation too trivial, to de∣ceive
for a moment.”</P>
<P>“I have declared the truth,” said
Schedoni, haughtily.</P>
<P>“In which instance?” asked the in∣quisitor;
“for your, assertions contradict
each other!”</P>
<P>Schedoni was silent. Vivaldi could not
judge whether the pride which occasioned
his silence was that of innocence, or of
remorse.</P>
<P>“It appears, from your own testi∣mony,”
said the inquisitor, “that the in∣gratitude
was your's, not your accuser's,
since he consoled you with kindness,
which you have never returned him!—
Have you any thing further to say?”</P>
<P>Schedoni was still silent.</P>
<P>“This, then, is your only explana∣tion?”
added the Inquisitor.</P>

Schedoni, bowed his head, The inqui∣sitor
then, addressing the aecuser, de∣manded
what he had to reply.</P>
<P>“I have nothing to, reply,” said the
stranger, with malicious triumph; “the
accused has replied for me!”</P>
<P>“We are to conclude, then, that he
has spoken truth, when he asserted you
to be a monk of the Spirito Santo, at Na∣ples?”
said the inquisitor.</P>
<P>“You, holy father” said the stranger,
gravely, appealing to the inquisitor, “can,
answer for me, whether I am.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi listened with emotion.</P>
<P>The inquisitor rose from his chair, and
with solemnity replied, “I answer, then,
that you are not a monk of Naples.”</P>
<P>“By that reply,” said the vicar-gene∣ral,
in a low voice, to the inquisitor, “I
perceive you think father Schedoni is
guilty.”</P>
<P>The rejoinder of the inquisitor was de∣livered
in so low a tone, that Vivaldi
<PB N="256" REF="257"/>
could not understand it. He was per∣plexed
to interpret the answer given to the
appeal of the stranger. He thought that
the inquisitor would not have ventured an
assertion thus positive, if his opinion had
been drawn from inference only; and
that he should know the accuser, while
he was conducting himself towards him
as a stranger, amazed Vivaldi, no less
than if he had understood the character
of an inquisitor to be as artless as his
own. On the other hand, he had so
frequently seen the stranger at Paluzzi,
and in the habit of a monk, that he
could hardly question the assertion of
Schedoni, as to his identity.</P>
<P>The inquisitor, addressing Schedoni,
said, “Your evidence we know to be in
part erroneous; your accuser is not a
monk of Naples, but a servant of the
most holy Inquisition. Judging, from
this part of your evidence, we must sus∣pect
the whole.”</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="258"/>
“A servant of, the Inquisition!” ex∣claimed
Schedoni, with unaffected sur∣prize.
“Reverend father! your asser∣tion
astonishes me! You are deceived,
however strange it may appear, trust me,
you are deceived! You doubt the cre∣dit
of my word; I, therefore, will assert
no more. But inquire of Signor Vivaldi;
ask him, whether he has not often, and
lately, seen my accuser at Naples, and
in the habit of a monk.”</P>
<P>“I have seen, him at the ruins, of Pa∣luzzi,
near Naples, and in the ecclesias∣tical
dress,” replied. Vivaldi, without
waiting for the regular, question, “and
under circumstances no less extraordinary
than those which have attended him
here. But, in return for this frank ac∣knowledgment,
I require of you, father
Schedoni, to answer some questions which
I shall venture to suggest to the tribunal—
By what means were you informed, that I
have often seen the sranger at Paluzzi—
<PB N="258" REF="259"/>
and was you interested or not in his
mysterious conduct towards me there?”</P>
<P>To these questions, though formally
delivered from the tribunal, Schedoni
did not deign to reply.</P>
<P>“It appears, then,” said the vicar∣general,
“that the accuser and the ac∣cused
were once accomplices.”</P>
<P>The inquisitor objected, that this did
not certainly appear; and that, on the
contrary, Schedoni seemed to have given
his last questions in despair; an observa∣tion
which Vivaldi thought extraordinary
from an inquisitor.</P>
<P>“Be it <HI>accomplices,</HI> if it so please you,”
said Schedoni, bowing to the grand vi∣car,
without noticing the inquisitor:
“you may call us accomplices, but I
say, that we were <HI>friends.</HI> Since, it is
necessary to my own peace, that I should
more fully explain some circumstances
attending our intimacy, I will own that
my accuser was occasionally my agent,
<PB N="259" REF="260"/>
and assisted in preserving the dignity of an
illustrious family at Naples, the family of
the Vivaldi. And there, holy father,”
added Schedoni, pointing to Vincentio,
“is the son of that ancient house, for
whom I have attempted so much!”</P>
<P>Vivaldi was almost overwhelmed by
this confession of Schedoni, though he
had already suspected a part of the truth.
In the stranger he believed he saw the
slanderer of Ellena, the base instrument
of the Marchesa's policy, and of Schedo∣ni's
ambition; and the whole of his con∣duct
at Paluzzi, at least, seemed now in∣telligible.
In Schedoni he beheld his se∣cret
accuser, and the inexorable enemy
whom he believed to have occasioned the
imprisonment of Ellena, At this latter
consideration, al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> circumspection, all pru∣dence
forsook him: he declared, with
energy, that, from what Schedoni had
just acknowledged to be his conduct, he
knew him for his secret accuser, and the
<PB N="260" REF="261"/>
accuser, also, of Ellena di Rosalba; and
he called upon the tribunal to examine
into the Confessor's motives for the ac∣cusation,
and afterwards to give hear∣ing
to what be would himself unfold.</P>
<P>To this, the grand-vicar replied, that
Vivaldi's appeal would be taken into con∣sideration;
and he then ordered that the
present business should proceed.</P>
<P>The inquisitor, addressing Schedoni,
said, “The disinterested nature of your
friendship is now sufficiently explained,
and the degree of credit, which is due to
your late assertions understood. Of you
we ask no more, but turn to father Nicola
di Zampari, and demand what he has to
say in support of his accusation. What
are your proofs, Nicola di Zampari, that
he who calls himself father Schedoni is
Ferando Count di Bruno; and that he
has been guilty of murder, the murder
of his brother, and of his wife? Answer
to our charge!”</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262"/>
“To your first question,” said the
monk, “I reply that he has himself ac∣knowledged
to me, on an occasion, which
it is not necessary to mention, that he was
the Count di Bruno; to the last, I produce
the poniard which I received, with the
dying confession of the assassin whom he
employed.”</P>
<P>“Still, these are not proofs, but asser∣tions,”
observed the vicar-general, “and
the first forbids our confidence in the
second.—If, as you declare, Schedoni
himself acknowledged to you that he was
Count di Bruno, you must have been to
him the intimate friend he has declared
you were, or he would not have confided
to you a secret so dangerous to himself.
And, if you were that friend, what con∣fidence,
ought we to give to your assertions
respecting the dagger? since, whether
your accusations be true or felse, you
prove yourself guilty of treachery in bring∣ing
them forward at all.”</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263"/>
Vivaldi was surprized to hear such
candour from an inquisitor.</P>
<P>“Here is my proof,” said the stranger,
who now produced a paper, containing
what he asserted to be the dying confession
of the assassin. It was signed by a priest
of Rome, as well as by himself, and ap∣peared
from the date to have been given
only a very few weeks before. The priest,
he said, was living, and might be sum∣moned.
The tribunal issued an order for
the apprehension of this priest, and that
he should be brought to give evidence on
the following evening; after which, the
business of this night proceeded, without
further interruption, towards its conclusion.</P>
<P>The vicar-general spoke again, “Nicola
di Zampari, I call upon you to say, why,
if your proof of Schedoni's guilt is so clear,
as the confession of the assassin himself
must make it,—why you thought it ne∣cessary
to summon father Ansaldo to attest
the criminality of the Count di Bruno?
The dying confession of the assassin is cer∣tainly
<PB N="263" REF="264"/>
of more weight than any other
evidence.”</P>
<P>“I summoned the father Ansaldo,” re∣plied
the stranger, “as a means of proving
that Schedoni is the Count di Bruno. The
confession of the assassin sufficiently proves
the Count to have been the instigator of
the murder, but not that Schedoni is the
Count.”</P>
<P>“But that is more than I will engage
to prove,” replied Ansaldo, “I know it
was the Count di Bruno who confessed to
me, but I do not know that the father
Schedoni, who is now before me, was the
person who so confessed.”</P>
<P>“Conscientiously observed!” said the
vicar-general, interrupting the stranger,
who was about to reply, “but you, Nicola
di Zampari, have not on this head been
sufficiently explicit.—How do you know
that Schedoni is the penitent who confessed
to Ansaldb on the vigil of San Marco?”</P>
<P>“Reverend father, that is the point I
Was about to explain,” replied the monk,
<PB N="264" REF="265"/>
“I myself accompanied Schedoni, on
the eve of San Marco, to the church
of the <HI>Santa Maria del Pianto,</HI> at the
very hour when the confession is said to
have been made. Schedoni fold me he
was going to confession; and, when I
observed to him his unusual agitation, his
behaviour implied a consciousness of ex∣traordinary
guilt; he even betrayed it by
some words, which he dropt in the con∣fusion
of his mind. I parted with him at
the gates of the church. He was then of
an order of white friars, and habited as
father Ansaldo has described. Within a
few weeks after this confession, he left his
convent, for what reason I never could
learn, though I have often surmised it,
and came to reside at the Spirito Santo,
whither I also had removed.”</P>
<P>“Here is no proof,”said the vicar∣general,
“other friars of that order might
confess at the same hour, in the same
church.”</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="266"/>
“But here is strong presumption for
proof,” observed the inquisitor, “Holy
father, we must judge from probabilities,
as well as from proof.”</P>
<P>“But probabilities themselves,” replied
the vicar-general, “are strongly against
the evidence of a man, who would betray
another by means of words dropped in the
unguarded moments of powerful emotion.”</P>
<P>“Are these the sentiments of an inqui∣sitor!”
said Vivaldi to himself, “can such
glorious candour appear amidst the tribu∣nal
of an Inquisition!” Tears sell fast
on Vivaldi's cheek while lie gazed upon
this just judge, whose candour, had it
been exerted in his cause, could not have
excited more powerful sensations of esteem
and admiration. “An inquisitor!” he
repeated to himself, “an inquisitor!”</P>
<P>The inferior inquisitor, however, was
so far from possessing any congeniality of
character with his superior, that he was
evidently disappointed by the appearance
<PB N="266" REF="267"/>
of liberality, which the vicar-general dis∣covered,
and immediately said, “Has the
accuser any thing further to urge in evi∣dence,
that the father, Schedoni is the
penitent, who confessed to the penitentiary
Ansaldo?”</P>
<P>“I have,” replied the monk, with as∣perity.
“When I had lest Schedoni in
the church, I lingered without the walls
for his return, according to appointment.
But he appeared considerably sooner than
I expected, and in a state of disorder, such
as I had never, witnessed in him before.
In an instant he passed me, nor could my
voice arrest his progress. Confusion seem∣ed
to reign within the church and the
convent, and, when I would have enter∣ed,
for the purpose of inquiring the occa∣sion
of it, the gates were suddenly closed,
and all entrance forbidden. It has since
appeared, that the monks were then
searching for, the penitent. A rumour
afterwards reached me, that a confession
<PB N="267" REF="268"/>
had caused this disturbance; that the
father-confessor, who happened at that
time to be the grand penitentiary Ansaldo,
had left the chair in horror of what had been
divulged from the grate, and had judged
it necessary that a search should be made
for the penitent, who was a white, friar.
This report, reverend fathers, excited
general attention; with me it did more—
for I thought I knew the penitent. When
on the following day, I questioned Sche∣doni
as to his sudden departure from the
church of the Black Penitents, his answers
were dark, but emphatic, and he extorted
from me a promise, thoughtless that I was!
never to disclose his visit of the preceding
evening to the <HI>Santa del Pianto.</HI> I then
certainly discovered who was the penitent!”</P>
<P>“Did he, then, confess to you also?”
said the Vicar-general.</P>
<P>“No father. I understood him to
be the penitent to whom the report
alluded, but I had no suspicion of the
nature of his crimes, till the assassin
<PB N="268" REF="269"/>
began his confession, the conclusion of
which clearly explained the subject of
Schedoni's; it explained also his motive
for endeavouring ever after to attach me
to his interest.”</P>
<P>“You have now” said the vicar-general,
“you have now, confessed yourself a
member of the convent of the Spirito
Santo at Naples, and an intimate of the
father Schedoni; one whom for many
years he has endeavoured to attach to him.
Not an hour has passed since you denied
all this; the negative to the latter circum∣stance
was given, it is true, by implication
only; but to the first a direct and absolute
denial was pronounced!”</P>
<P>“I denied that I <HI>am</HI> a monk of Naples,”
replied the accuser, “and I appealed to
the Inquisitor for the truth of my denial.
He has said, that I am now a servant of the
most holy Inquisition.”</P>
<P>The Vicar-general, with some surprise,
looked at the inquisitor for explanation;
<PB N="269" REF="270"/>
other members of the tribunal did the
same; the rest appeared to understand
more than they had thought it necessary to
avow. The inquisitor, who had been
called upon, rose, and replied,</P>
<P>“Nicola di Zampari has spoken the
truth. It is not many weeks since he en∣tered
the holy office. A certificate from
his convent at Naples bears testimony to
the truth of what I advance, and procured
him admittance here.”</P>
<P>“It is extraordinary that you should
not have disclosed your knowledge of this
person before!” said the vicar∣general.</P>
<P>“Holy father, I had reasons,” replied
the inquisitor, “you will recollect that
the accused, was present, and you will un∣derstand
them.”</P>
<P>“I comprehend you,” said the Vicar∣general,
“but I do neither approve of,
nor perceive any necessity for your coun∣tenancing
the subterfuge of this Nicola di
Zampari, relative to his identity. But
more of this in private.”</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="271"/>
“I will explain alt there,” answered
the inquisitor.</P>
<P>“It appears then,” resumed the vicar-general,
speaking aloud, “that this Nicola
di Zampari was formerly the friend and
confidant of father Schedoni, whom he
now accuses. The accusation is evidently
malicious; whether it be also false, re∣mains
to be decided. A material question
naturally arises out of the subject—Why
was not the accusation brought forward
before this period?”</P>
<P>The monk's visage brightened with the
satisfaction of anticipated triumph, and he
immediately replied,</P>
<P>“Most holy father! as soon as I ascer∣tained
the crime, I prepared to prosecute
the perpetrator of it. A short period only
has elapsed since the assassin gave his con∣fession.
In this interval I discovered, in
these prisons, Signor Vivaldi, and imme∣diately
comprehended by whose means he
was confined. I knew enough both of
<PB N="271" REF="272"/>
the accuser and accused, to understand
which of these was innocent, and had
then a double motive for causing, Schedoni
to be summoned;—I wished equally to
deliver the innocent and punish, the cri∣minal.
The question as to the motive for
my becoming the enemy of him, who was
once my friend, is already answered;—
it was a sense of justice, not a suggestion
of malice.”</P>
<P>The grand-vicar smiled, but asked no fur∣ther;
and this long examination concluded
with committing Schedoni again into close
custody, till full evidence should be obtained
of his guilt, or his innocence should appear.
Respecting the manner of his wife's
death, there was” yet no other evidence
than that which was asserted to be his own
confession, which, though perhaps suffi∣cient
to condemn a criminal before the tri∣bunal
of the Inquisition, was not enough to
satisfy the present vicar-general, who gave
direction that means might be employed to∣wards
<PB N="272" REF="273"/>
obtaining proof of each article
of the accusation; in order that, should
Schedoni be acquitted of the charge of
having murdered his brother, documents
might appear for prosecuting him respect∣ing
the death of his wife.</P>
<P>Schedoni, when he withdrew from the
hall, bowed respectfully to the tribunal,
and whether, not with standing late appear∣ances,
he were innocent, or that subtlety
enabled him to reassume his usual address,
it is certain his manner no longer betrayed
any symptom of conscious guilt. His
countenance was firm and even tranquil,
and his air dignified. Vivaldi, who,
during the greater part of this examina∣tion,
had been convinced of his crimina∣lity,
now only doubted his innocence.
Vivaldi was himself reconducted to his prison,
and the sitting of the tribunal was
dissolved.</P>

<BIBL>COLLINS.</BIBL>
<P>WHEN the night of Schedoni's trial
arrived, Vivaldi was again summoned to the
hall of the tribunal. Every circumstance
was now arranged according to the full cere∣monies
of the place; the members of the
tribunal were more numerous than for∣merly
at the examinations; the chief in∣quisitors
wore habits of a fashion different
from those which▪ before distinguished
them, and their turbans, of a singular
form and larger size, seemed to give an
air of sterner ferocity to their features.
The hall, as usual, was hung with black,
And every person who appeared there,
<PB N="274" REF="275"/>
whether inquisitor, official, witness or
prisoner, was habited in the same dismal
hue, which, together with the kind of
light diffused through the chamber from
lamps hung high in the vaulted roof, and
from torches held by parties of officials
who kept watch at the several doors, and
in different parts of this immense hall,
gave a character of gloomy solemnity to
the assembly, which was almost horrific.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was situated in a place, whence
he beheld the whole of the tribunal, and
could distinguish whatever was: passing in
the hall. The countenance of every
member was now fully displayed to him
by the torchmen, who, arranged at the
steps of the platform on which the three
ehief inquisitors were elevated, extended
in a semicircle on either hand of the place
occupied by the inferior members. The
red glare, which the torches threw upon
the latter, certainly did not soften the ex∣pression
of faces, for the most part sculp∣tured
<PB N="275" REF="276"/>
by passions of dark malignity or
fiercer cruelty; and Vivaldi could not bear
even to examine them long.</P>
<P>Before the bar of the tribuna1, he dis∣tinguished
Schedoni, and little did he
suspect, that in him, a criminal brought
thither to answer for the guilt of murder—
the murder of a brother, and of a wife he
beheld the parent of Ellena di Rosalba!</P>
<P>Near Schedoni was seated the peniten∣tiary
Ansaldo; the Roman priest, who was
to be a principal witness, and father Nicola
di Zampari, upon whom Vivaldi could
not even, now look without experiencing
somewhat of the awe, which had prevail∣ed
over his mind when he was inclined to
consider the stranger rather as the vision
of another world, than as a being of this.
The same wild and indescribable character.
still distinguished his air, his every look
and movement, and Vivaldi could not
but believe that something in the highest
degree, extraordinary would yet be disco∣vered
concerning him.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="277"/>
The witnesses being called over, Vivaldi
understood that he was placed among
them, though he had only repeated the
words which father Nicola had spoken, and
which, since Nicola himself was present as
a witness against Schedoni, he did not
perceive could be in the least material
on the trial.</P>
<P>When Vivaldi had, in his turn, answer∣ed
to his name, a voice, bursting forth
from a distant part of the hall, exclaimed,
“It is my master! my <HI>dear</HI> maiser!” and
on directing his eyes whence it. came, he
perceived the faithful Paulo struggling
with his guard. Vivaldi called to him to
be patient, and to forbear resistance, an
exhortation, however, which served only
to increase the efforts of the servant for
liberty, and in the next instant he broke
from the grasp of the officials, and, dart∣ing
towards Vivaldi, fell at his feet, sob∣bing,
and clasping his knees, and exclaim∣ing,
“O my master! my master! have
I found you at last?”</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="278"/>
Vivaldi, as much affected by this meet∣ing
as Paulo, could not immediately speak.
He would, however, have raised and em∣braced
his affectionate servant, but Paulo,
still clinging to his knees and sobbing,
was so much agitated that he scarcely un∣derstood
any thing said to him, and to the
kind assurances and gentle remonstrances
of Vivaldi, constantly replied as if to the
officers, whom he fancied to be forcing
him away.</P>
<P>“Remember your situation, Paulo,” said
Vivaldi, “consider mine also, and be
governed by prudence.”</P>
<P>“You shall not force me hence!” cried
Paulo, “you can take my life only once;
if I must die, it shall be here.”</P>
<P>“Recollect yourself, Paulo, and be
composed. Your life, I trust is in no
danger.”</P>
<P>Paulo looked up; and again bursting
into, a passion of tears, repeated, “O! my
master! my master! Where have you been
<PB N="278" REF="279"/>
all this while? are you indeed alive? I
thought I never should see you again! I
have dreamt an hundred times that you
were dead and buried! and I wished to
be dead and buried with you. I thought
you was gone out of this world into the
next. I feared you was gone to heaven,
and so believed we should, never meet
again. But now, I see you once more,
and know that you live! O! my master!
my master!”</P>
<P>The officers who had followed Paulo,
now endeavouring to withdraw him, he
became more outrageous.</P>
<P>“Do your worst at once,” said he;
“but you shall find tough work of it, if
you try to force me from hence, so you
had better, be contented with killing me
here.”</P>
<P>The incensed officials were laying vio∣lent
hands upon him, when Vivaldi inter∣posed.
“I entreat, I supplicate you,”
said he, “that you will suffer him to re∣main
near me.”</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="280"/>
“It is impossible,” replied an officer,
“we dare not.”</P>
<P>“I will promise that he shall not even
speak to me, if you will only allow him to
be near,” added Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Not speak to you, master!” exclaim∣ed
Paulo, “but I will stay by you, and
speak to you as long as I like, till my last
gasp. Let them do their worst at once; I
defy them all, and all the. devils of in∣quisitors
at their heels. too, to force me
away. I can die but once, and they
ought to be satisfied with that,—so what
is there to be afraid of? Not speak!”</P>
<P>“He knows not what he says,” said
Vivaldi to the officials, while he endea∣voured
to silence Paulo with his hand,
“I am certain that he will submit to
whatever I shall require of him, and will
be entirely silent; or, if he does speak
now and then, it shall be only in a
whisper.”</P>
<P>“A whisper!” said an officer sneering∣ly,
“do you suppose Signor, that any
<PB N="280" REF="281"/>
person is suffered to speak in a whisper
here?”</P>
<P>“A whisper!” shouted Paulo, “I scorn
to speak in a whisper. I will speak so
loud, that every word I say shall ring in
the ears of all those old black devils on
the benches yonder; aye, and those on
that mountebank stage too, that sit there
looking so grim and angry as if they long∣ed
to tear us in pieces. They”—</P>
<P>“Silence,” said Vivaldi with emphasis,
“Paulo, I command you to be silent.”</P>
<P>“They shall know a bit of my mind,”
continued Paulo, without noticing Vivaldi,
“I will tell them what they have to ex∣pect
for all their cruel usage of my poor
master. Where do; they expect to go
when they die, I wonder? Though, for
that matter, they cannot go to a worse
place than they are in already, and I
suppose it is, knowing that, which makes
them not afraid of being ever so wicked:
They shall hear a little plain truth, for
<PB N="281" REF="282"/>
once in their lives, however, they shall
hear”—</P>
<P>During the whole of this harangue,
Vivaldi, alarmed for the consequence of
such imprudent, though honest indigna∣tion,
had been using all possible effort to
silence him, and was the more alarmed,
since the officials made no further attempt
to interrupt Paulo, a forbearance, which
Vivaldi attributed to malignity, and to a
wish that Paulo might be entrapped by
his own act. At length he made himself
heard.</P>
<P>“I <HI>entreat,</HI>” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>Paulo stopped for a moment.</P>
<P>“Paulo!” rejoined Vivaldi earnestly,
“do you love your master?”</P>
<P>“Love my master!” said Paulo re∣sentfully,
without allowing Vivaldi to
finish his sentence, “Have I not gone
through fire and water, for him? or, what
is as good, have I not put myself into the
Inquisition, and all on his account? and
<PB N="282" REF="283"/>
now to be asked, “Do I love my master!”
If you believe, Signor, that any thing else
made me come here, into these dismal
holes, you are quite entirely out; and
when they have made an end of me, as I
suppose they will do, before all is over,
you will, perhaps, think better of me than
to suspect that I came here for my own
pleasure.”</P>
<P>“All that may be as you say, Paulo,”
replied Vivaldi coldly, while he with dif∣ficulty
commanded his tears, “but your
immediate submission is the only con∣duct
that can convince me of the sincerity
of your professions. I <HI>entreat</HI> you to be
silent.”</P>
<P><HI>“Entreat</HI> me!” said Paulo, “O my
master! what have I done that it should
come to this? <HI>Entreat</HI> me!” he repeated,
sobbing.</P>
<P>“You will then give me this proof of
your attachment?” asked Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Do not use such a heart breaking
word again, master,” replied Paulo, while
<PB N="283" REF="284"/>
he dashed the tears from his cheek, “such
a heart breaking word, and I will do any
thing.”</P>
<P>“You submit to what I require then,
Paulo?”</P>
<P>“Aye, Signor, if—if it is even to kneel
at the feet of that devil of an inquisitor,
yonder.”</P>
<P>“I shall only require you to be silent,”
replied Vivaldi, “and you may then be
permitted to remain near me.”</P>
<P>“Well, Signor, well; I will do as
you bid me, then, and only just say”—</P>
<P>“Not a syllable! Paulo,” interrupted
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Only just say, master”—</P>
<P>“Not a word I entreat you!” added
Vivaldi, “or you will be removed imme∣diately.”</P>
<P>“His removal does not depend on that,”
said one of the officials, breaking from his
watchful silence, “he must go, and that
without more delay.”</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="285"/>
“What! after I have promised not to
open my lips!” said Paulo, “do you pre∣tend
to break your agreement?”</P>
<P>“There <HI>is</HI> no presence, and there <HI>was</HI>
no agreement,” replied the man sharply,
“so obey directly, or it will be the worse
for you.”</P>
<P>The officials were provoked, and Paulo
became still more enraged and clamorous,
till at length the uproar reached the
tribunal at the other end of the hall, and
silence having been commanded, an in∣quiry
was made into the cause of the con∣fusion.
The consequence of this was, an
order that Paulo should withdraw from
Vivaldi; but as at this moment he feared
no greater evil, he gave his refusal to the
tribunal with as little ceremony as he had
done before to the officials.</P>
<P>At length, after much difficulty, a sort
of compromise was made, and Paulo being
soothed by his master into some degree of
compliance, was suffered to remain with∣in
a short distance of him.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="286"/>
The business of the trial soon after
commenced. Ansaldo the penitentiary,
and father Nicola, appeared as witnesses,
as did, also, the Roman priest, who had
assisted, in taking the depositions of the
dying assassin, He had been privately
interrogated, and had given clear and sa∣tisfactory
evidence as to the truth of the
paper, produced by Nicola. Other wit∣nesses,
also had been subpoenaed, whom
Schedoni had no expectation of meet∣ing.</P>
<P>The deportment of the Confessor, on
first entering the hall, was collected and
firm; it remained unchanged when the
Roman priest was brought forward; but,
on the appearance of another witness,
his courage seemed to faulter. Before this
evidence was, however, called for, the
depositions of the assassin were publicly
read. They stated, with the closest con∣ciseness,
the chief facts, of which the
following is a somewhat more, dilated
narrative.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="287"/>
It appeared, that about the year 1742,
the late Count di Bruno had passed over
into Greece, a journey which his brother,
the present Confessor, having long ex∣pected,
had meditated to take advantage
of. Though a lawless passion had first
suggested to the dark mind of Schedoni
the atrocious act, which should destroy a
brother, many circumstances and conside∣rations
had conspired to urge him towards
its accomplishment. Among these was the
conduct of the late Count towards him∣self,
which, however reasonable, as it
had contradicted his own selfish gratifica∣tions,
and added strong reproof to op∣position,
had excited his most inveterate
hatred. Schedoni, who, as a younger
brother of his family, bore, at that time,
the title of Count di Marinella, had dis∣sipated
his small patrimony at a very early
age; but, though suffering might then
have taught him prudence, it had only
encouraged him in duplicity, and ren∣dered
<PB N="287" REF="288"/>
him more eager to seek a temporary
refuge in the same habits of extravagance
which had led to it. The Count di Bru∣no,
though his fortune was very limited,
had afforded frequent supplies to his bro∣ther;
till, finding that he was incorrigi∣ble,
and that the sums which he himself
spared with difficulty from his family were
lavished, without remorse, by Marinella,
instead of being applied, with economy,
to his support, he refused further aid than
was sufficient for his absolute necessi∣ties.</P>
<P>It would be difficult for a candid mind
to believe how a conduct so reasonable
could possibly excite hatred in any breast,
or that the power of selfishness could so
far warp any undesanding, as to induce
Marinella, whom we will, in future,
again call Schedoni, to look upon his
brother with detestation, because he had
refused to ruin himself that his kinsman
might revel! Yet it is certain that Sche∣doni,
<PB N="288" REF="289"/>
terming the necessary prudence of
di Bruno to be meanness and cold insensi∣bility
to the comfort of others, suffered
full as much resentment towards him from
system, as he did from passion, though
the meanness and the insensibility he ima∣gined
in his brother's character were not
only real traits in his own, but were dis∣playing
themselves in the very arguments
he urged against them.</P>
<P>The rancour thus excited was cherished
by innumerable circumstances, and ri∣pened
by envy, that meanest and most
malignant of the human passions; by
envy of di Bruno's blessings, of an un∣encumbered
estate, and of a beautiful
wife, he was tempted to perpetrate the
deed, which might transfer those blessings
to himself. Spalatro, whom he employed
to this purpose, was well known to him,
and he did not fear to confide the conduct
of the crime to this man, who was to
purchase a little habitation on the remote
<PB N="289" REF="290"/>
shore of the Adriatic, and, with a certain
stipend, to reside there. The ruinous
dwelling, to which Ellena had been car∣ried,
as its solitary situation suited Sche∣doni's
views, was taken for him.</P>
<P>Schedoni, who had good intelligence
of all di Bruno's movements, acquainted
Spalatro, from time to time, with his ex∣act
situation; and it was after di Bruno,
on his return, had crossed the Adriatic,
from Ragusi to Manfredonia, and was
entering upon the woods of the Garga∣nus,
that Spalatro, with his comrade,
overtook him. They fired at the Count
and his attendants, who were only a
valet, and a guide of the country; and,
concealed among the thickets, they se∣curely
repeated the attack. The shot did
not immediately succeed, and the Count,
looking round to discover his enemy, pre∣pared
to defend himself, but the firing was
so rapidly sustained, that, at length, both
di Bruno and his servant fell, covered
with wounds. The guide fled.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="291"/>
The unfortunate travellers were buried
by their assassins on the spot; but, whe∣ther
the suspicion which attends upon the
consciousness of guilt, prompted Spala∣tro
to guard against every possibility of
being betrayed by the accomplice of his
crime, or whatever was the motive, he
returned to the forest alone; and, shroud∣ed
by night, removed the bodies to a pit,
which he had prepared under the flooring
of the house where he lived; thus dis∣placing
all proof, should his accomplice
hereafter point out to justice the spot in
which he had assisted to deposit the man∣gled
remains of di Bruno.</P>
<P>Schedoni contrived a plausible history
of the shipwreck of his brother upon the
Adriatic, and of the loss of the whole
crew; and, as no persons but the assas∣sins
were acquainted with the real cause
of his death, the guide, who had fled,
and the people at the only town he had
passed through, since he landed, being ig∣norant
<PB N="291" REF="292"/>
even of the name of di Bruno,
there was not any circumstance to contra∣dict
the falshood. It was universally cre∣dited,
and even the widow of the Count
had, perhaps, never doubted its truth;
or if, after her compelled marriage with
Schedoni, his conduct did awaken a sus∣picion,
it was too vague to produce any
serious consequence.</P>
<P>During the reading of Spalatro's con∣fession,
and particularly at the conclusion
of it, the surprize and dismay of Sche∣doni
were too powerful for concealment;
and it was not the least considerable part
of his wonder, that Spalatro should have
come to Rome for the purpose of making
these depositions; but further considera∣tion
gave him a conjecture of the truth.</P>
<P>The account, which Spalatro had given
of his motive for this journey to the priest,
was, that, having lately understood Sche∣doni
to be resident at Rome, he had fol∣lowed
him thither, with an intention of
<PB N="292" REF="293"/>
relieving his conscience by an acknow∣lodgment
of his own crimes, and a dis∣closure
of Schedoni's. This, however,
was not exactly the fact. The design of
Spalatro was to extort money from the
guilty Confessor; a design, from, which
the latter believed he had protected him∣self,
as well as from every other evil con∣sequence,
when he misled his late ac∣complice,
respecting his place of resi∣dence;
little foreseeing that the very arti∣fice,
which should send this man in search
of him to Rome, instead of Naples,
would be the means of bringing his crimes
before the public.</P>
<P>Spalatro had followed the steps of Sche∣doni
as far as the town at which, he slept,
on the first night of his journey; and,
having there passed him, had reached the
villa di Cambrusca, when, perceiving the
Confessor approaching, he had taken
shelter from observation, within the ruin.
The motive, which before made him
<PB N="293" REF="294"/>
shrink from notice, had contributed, and
still did so, to a suspicion that he aimed at
the life of Schedoni, who, in wounding
him, believed he had saved himself from
an assassin. The wounds, however, of
Spalatro did not so much disable him,
but that he proceeded towards Rome from
the town whence the parting road had
conducted his master towards Naples.</P>
<P>The fatigue of a long journey, per∣formed
chiefly on foot, in Spalatro's
wounded condition, occasioned a fever,
that terminated together his journey and
his life; and in his last hours he had un∣burdened
his conscience by a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull confes∣sion
of his guilt. The priest, who, on
this occasion, had. been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent for, alarmed
by the importance of the confession, since
it implicated a living person, called in a
friend as witness to the depositions. This
witness was father Nicola, the former in∣timate
of Schedoni, and who was of a
character to rejoice in any discovery, which
<PB N="294" REF="295"/>
might punish a man from whose repeated
promises he had received only severe dis∣appointments.</P>
<P>Schedoni now perceived that all his de∣signs
against Spalatro had failed, and he
had meditated more than have yet been
fully disclosed. It may be remembered,
that on parting with the peasant, his con∣ductor,
the Confessor, gave him a stiletto
to defend him, as he said, from the at∣tack
of Spalatro, in case of encountering
him on the road. The point of this in∣strument
was tipped with poison; so
that a scratch from it was sufficient to in∣flict
death. Schedoni had for many years
secretly carried about him such an enve∣nomed
insirument, for reasons known
only to himself. He had hoped, that,
should the peasant meet Spalatro, and be
provoked to defend himself, this stiletto
would terminate the life of his accom∣plice,
and relieve him from all probabi∣lity
of discovery, since the other assassin,
<PB N="295" REF="296"/>
whom he employed, had been dead seve∣ral
years. The expedient failed in every
respect; the peasant did not even see
Spalatro; and, before he reached his
home, he luckily lost the fatal stiletto,
which, as he had discovered himself to be
acquainted with some circumstances con∣nected
with the crimes of Schedoni, the
Confessor would have wished him to keep,
from the chance, that he might some time
injure himself in ussing it. The poniard, as
he had no proper means of fastening it to
his dress, had fallen, and was carried
away by the torrent he was crossing at
that moment.</P>
<P>But, if Schedoni had been shocked by
the confession of the assassin, his dismay
was considerably greater, when a new
witness was brought forward, and he per∣ceived
an ancient domestic of his house.
This man identified Schedoni for Ferando
Count di Bruno, with whom he had lived
as a servant after the death of the Count
his brother. And not only did he bear
<PB N="296" REF="297"/>
testimony to the person of Schedoni, but
to the death of the Countess, his wife.
Giovanni declared himself to be one of
the domestics who had assisted in convey∣ing
her to her apartment, after she had
been struck by the poniard of Schedoni,
and who had afterwards attended her fu∣neral
in the church of the Santa del Mi∣racoli,
a convent near the late residence
of di Bruno. He further affirmed, that
the physicians had reported her death to
be in consequence of the wound she had
received, and he bore witness to the flight
of his master, previous to the death of
the Countess, and immediately upon the
assassination, and that he had never pub∣licly
appeared upon his estate fince that
period.</P>
<P>An inquisitor asked, whether any
measures had been taken by the relations
of the deceased lady, toward a prosecu∣tion
of the Count.</P>
<P>The witness replied, that a long search
had been made for the Count, for such a
<PB N="297" REF="298"/>
purpose, but that he had wholly eluded
discovery, and that, of course, no further
step had been taken in the affair. This
reply appeared to occasion dissatisfaction;
the tribunal was silent, and seemed to he∣sitate;
the vicar-general then addressed
the witness.</P>
<P>“How can you be certain that the per∣son
now before you, calling himself fa∣ther
Schedoni, is the Count di Bruno,
your former master, if you have never
seen him during the, long interval of
years you mention?”</P>
<P>Giovanni; without, hesitation, answer∣ed,
that, though years had worn the fea∣tures,
of the Count, he recollected them
the moment he beheld him; and not the
Count only, but the person of the peni∣tentiary
Ansaldo, whom he had seen a
frequent Visitor at the house of di Bruno,
though his, appearance, also, was consi∣derably
changed by time, and by the ec∣elesiastical
habit which he now wore.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="299"/>
The vicar-general seemed still to doubt
the evidence of this man, till Ansaldo
himself, on being called upon, remem∣bered
him to have been a servant of the
Count, though he could not identify the
Count himself.</P>
<P>The grand-inquisitor remarked, that it
was extraordinary he should recollect the
face of the servant, yet forget that of the
master, with whom he had lived in ha∣bits
of intimacy. To this Ansaldo re∣plied,
that the stronger passions of Sche∣doni,
together with his particular habits
of life, might reasonably be supposed to
have wrought a greater change upon the
features of the Count than the character
and circumstances of Giovanni's could
have effected on his.</P>
<P>Schedoni, not without reason, was
appalled, on the appearance of this ser∣vant,
whose further testimony gave such
clearness and force to some other parts of
the evidence, that the tribunal pro∣nounced
<PB N="299" REF="300"/>
sentence upon Schedoni, as the
murderer of the Count his brother; and
as this, the first charge, was sufficient for
his condemnation to death, they did not
proceed upon the second, that which re∣lated
to his wife.</P>
<P>The emotion betrayed by Schedoni, on
the appearance of the last witness, and
during the delivery of the evidence, disap∣peared
when his fate became certain;
and when the dreadful sentence of the
law was pronounced, it made no visible
impression on his mind. From that mo∣ment,
his firmness or his hardihood never
forsook him.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who witnessed this condemna∣tion,
appeared infinitely more affected by
it than himself, and, though in revealing
the circumstance of father Nicola's sum∣mons,
which, had eventually led to the
discovery of Schedoni's crimes, he had
not been left a choice in his conduct, he
felt, at this moment, as miserable as if
<PB N="300" REF="301"/>
he had actually borne witness against the
life of a fellow being: what, then, would
have been his feelings, had he been told
that this Schedoni, thus condemned, was
the father of Ellena di Rosalba! But,
whatever these might be, he was soon
condemned to experience them. One of
the most powerful of Schedoni's passions
appeared even in this last scene; and as
in quitting the tribunal, he passed near
Vivaldi, he uttered these few words—
“In me you have murdered the father of
Ellena di Rosalba!”</P>
<P>Not with any hope that the intercession
of Vivaldi, himself also a prisoner, could
in the least mitigate a sentence pro∣nounced
by the Inquisition, did he say
this, but for the purpose of revenging
himself for the evil, which Vivaldi's evi∣dence
had contributed to produce, and
inflicting the exquisite misery such infor∣mation
must give. The attempt suc∣ceded
too well.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="302"/>
At first, indeed, Vivaldi judged this
to be only the desperate assertion of a
man, who believed his last chance of es∣caping
the rigour of the law to rest with
him; and, at the mention of Ellena, for∣getting
every precaution, he loudly de∣manded
to know her situation. Sche∣doni,
throwing upon him an horrible
smile of triumph and derision, was pass∣ing
forward without replying, but Vi∣valdi,
unable to support this state of un∣certainty,
asked permission of the tribu∣nal
to converse, for a few moments, with
the prisoner; a request which was granted
with extreme reluctance; and only on
condition that the conversation should be
public.</P>
<P>To Vivaldi's questions, as to the situa∣tion
of Ellena, Schedoni only replied,
that she was his daughter, and the so∣lemnity,
which accompanied these repeated
assertions, though it failed to convince
Vivaldi of this truth, occasioned him
<PB N="302" REF="303"/>
agonizing doubt and apprehension; but
when the Consfessor, perceiving the po∣licy
of disclosing her place of residence
to Vivaldi, softened from his desire of
vengeance to secure the interest of his
family, and named the <HI>Santa della Piéta</HI> as
her present afylum, the joy of such in∣telligence
overcame, for a time, every
other consideration.</P>
<P>To this dialogue, however, the officials
put a speedy conclusion; Schedoni was
led back to his cell, and Vivaldi was soon
after ordered to his former close confine∣ment.</P>
<P>But Paulo became again outrageous,
when he was about to be separated from
his master, till the latter, having peti∣tioned
the tribunal, that his servant might
accompany him to his prison, and received
an absolute re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usal, endeavoured to calm
the violence of his despair. He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell at
his master's feet, and shed tears, but he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttered no further complaints. When he
<PB N="303" REF="304"/>
rose, he turned his eyes in silence upon
Vivaldi, and they seemed to say, “Dear
master! I shall never see you more!” and
with this sad expression, he continued to
gaze on him till he had left the hall.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, notwithstanding the various
subjecls of his distress, could not bear to
meet the piteous looks of this poor man,
and he withdrew his eyes; yet, at every
other step he took, they constantly return∣ed
to his faithful servant, till the doors
folded him from sight.</P>
<P>When he had quitted the hall, Vivaldi
pleaded, however hopelessly, to the offi∣cials,
in favour of Paulo, entreating that
they would speak to the persons, who kept
guard over him, and prevail with them to
shew him every allowable indulgence.</P>
<P>“No indulgence can be allowed him,”
replied one of the men, “except bread
and water, and the liberty of walking in
his cell.”</P>
<P>“No <HI>other I”</HI> said Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="305"/>
“None,” repeated the official. “This
prisoner has been near getting one of his
guards into a scrape already, for, somehow
or other, he so talked, him over, and won
upon him, (for he is but a young one here)
that the man let him have a light, and a
pen and ink; but, luckily, it was found
out, before any harm was done.”</P>
<P>“And what became of this honest
fellow?” inquired Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Honest! he was none so honest,
either, Signor, if he could; not mind his
duty.”</P>
<P>“Was he punished, then?”</P>
<P>“No, Signor,” replied the man,
pausing, and looking back upon the long∣avenue
they were passing, to inquire whe∣ther
he was observed to hold this conver∣sation
with a prisoner: “no, Signor, he
was a younker, so they let him off for
once, and seat him to guard a man, who
was not so full of his coaxing ways.”</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="306"/>
“Paulo made him merry, perhaps?”
asked Vivaldi. “What were the coaxing
ways you spoke of?”</P>
<P>“Merry, Signor! no! he made him
cry, and that was as bad.”</P>
<P>“Indeed!” said Vivaldi. “The man
must have been here, then, a very short
time.”</P>
<P>“Not more than a month, or so,
Signor.”</P>
<P>“But the coaxing ways you talked
of,” repeated Vivaldi, “what were, they?
—a ducat, or so?”</P>
<P>“A ducat!” exclaimed the man, “no I
not a <HI>Paolo!”</HI></P>
<P>“Are you <HI>sure</HI> of that?” cried Vi∣valdi,
shrewdly.</P>
<P>“Aye, sure enough, Signor. This
fellow is not worth a ducat in the
world!”</P>
<P>“But his master is, friend,” observed
Vivaldi, in a very low voice, while he
put some money into his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="307"/>
The officer made no answer but con∣cealed
the money, and nothing farther
was said.</P>
<P>Vivaldi had given this as a bribe, to
procure some kindness for his servant,
not from any consideration of himself,
for his own critical situation had ceased at
this time to be a subject of anxiety with
him. His mind was at present strangely
agitated between emotions the most op∣posite
in their nature, the joy which a
discovery of Ellena's safety inspired, and
the horrible suspicion that Schedoni's as∣surances
of relationship occasioned. That
his Ellena was the daughter of a mur∣derer,
that the father of Ellena should
be brought to ignominious death, and
that he himself, however unintentionally,
should have assisted to this event, were
considerations almost too horrible to be
sustained! Vivaldi sought refuge from
them in various conjectures as to the mo∣tive,
which might have induced Schedoni
<PB N="307" REF="308"/>
to assert a falshood in this instance;
but that of revenge alone appeared plau∣sible;
and even this surmise was weak∣ened,
when he considered that the
Confessor had assured him of Ellena's
safety, an assurance which, as Vivaldi
did not detect the selfish policy con∣nected
with it, he believed Schedoni
would not have given, had his gene∣ral
intent towards him been malicious.
But it was pessible, that this very in∣formation,
on which all his comfort re∣posed,
might be false, and had been
given only for the purpose of inflicting
the anguish a discovery of the truth mush
lead to! With an anxiety so intense,
as almost to overcome his faculty of
judging, he examined every minute pro∣bability
relative to this point, and con∣cluded
with believing that Schedoni had,
in this last instance, at least, spoken
honestly.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="309"/>
Whether he had done so in his first
assertion was a question, which had raised
in Vivaldi's mind a tempest of conjec∣ture
and of horror; for, while the sub∣ject
of it was too aftonishing to be fully
believed, it was, also, too dreadful, not
to be apprehended even as a possibility.</P>

<P>WHILE these events were passing in
the prisons of the Inquisition at Rome,
Ellena, in the sanctuary of <HI>Our Lady of
Pity,</HI> remained ignorant of Schedoni's ar∣rest,
and of Vivaldi's situation. She under∣stood
that the Confessor was preparing to
acknowledge her for his daughter, and
believed that she comprehended also the
motive for his absence; but, though he
had forbidden her to expect a visit from
him till his arrangement should be com∣pleted,
he had promised to write in the
mean time, and inform her of all the pre∣sent
<PB N="310" REF="311"/>
circumstances of Vivaldi; his unex∣pected
silence had excited, therefore, ap∣prehensions
as various, though not so ter∣rible,
as those which Vivaldi had suffered
for her; nor did the silence of Vivaldi
himself appear less extraordinary.</P>
<P>“His confinement must be severe in∣deed,”
said the afflicted Ellena, “since
he cannot relieve my anxiety by a single
line of intelligence. Or, perhaps, ha∣rassed
by unceasing opposition, he has
submitted to the command of his family,
and has consented to forget me. Ah!
why did I leave the opportunity for that
command to his family; why did I not
enforce it myself!”</P>
<P>Yet, while she uttered this self-reproach,
the tears she shed contradicted the pride
which had suggested it; and a conviction
lurking in her heart that Vivaldi could
not so resign her, soon dissipated those
tears. But other conjectures recalled
them; it was possible that he was ill—
that he was dead!</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="312"/>
In such vague and gloomy surmise her
days passed away; employment could no
longer withdraw her from herself, nor
music, even for a moment, charm away
the sense of sorrow; yet she regularly par∣took
of the various occupations of the
nuns; and was so far from permitting
herself to indulge in any useless expression
of anxiety, that she had never once dis∣closed
the sacred subject of it; so that,
though she could not assume an air of
cheerfulness, she never appeared otherwise
than tranquil. Her most soothing, yet
perhaps most melancholy hour, was when
about sun-set she could withdraw unno∣ticed,
to the terrace among the rocks,
that overlooked the convent, and formed
a part of its domain. There, alone and
relieved from all the ceremonial restraints
of the society, her very thoughts seemed
more at liberty. As, from beneath the
light foliage of the accacias, or the more
majestic shade of the plane-trees that waved
<PB N="312" REF="313"/>
their branches over the many-coloured
cliffs of this terrace, Ellena looked down,
upon the magnificent scenery of the bay,
it brought back to memory, in sad yet
pleasing detail, the many happy days she
had passed on those blue waters, or on
the shores, in the society of Vivaldi and
her departed relative Bianchi; and every
point of the prospect marked by such re∣membrance,
which the veiling distance
stole, was rescued by imagination, and
pictured by affection in tints more ani∣mated
than those of brightest nature.</P>
<P>One evening Ellena had lingered on
the terrace later than usual. She had
watched the rays retiring from the highest
points of the horizon, and the fading
imagery of the lower scene, till, the sun
having sunk into the waves, all colouring
was withdrawn, except an empurpling
and reposing hue, which overspread the
waters and the heavens, and blended in
soft confusion every feature of the land∣scape
<PB N="313" REF="314"/>
The roofs and slender spires of the
Santa della Pieta, with a single tower of
the church rising loftily over every other
part of the buildings that cornposed the
convent, were fading fast from the eye;
but the solemn tint that invested them
accorded so well with their style, that El∣lena
was unwilling to relinquish this in∣teresting
object. Suddenly she perceived
through the dubious light an unusual
number of moving figures in the court of
the great cloister, and listening, she fan∣cied
she could distinguish the murmuring
of many voices. The white drapery of
the nuns rendered them conspicuous as
they moved, but it was impossible to as∣certain
who were the individuals engaged
in this bustle. Presently the assemblage
dispersed; and Ellena, curious to un∣derstand
the occasion of what she had
observed, prepared to descend to the con∣vent.</P>
<P>She had left the terrace, and was about
to enter a long avenue of chesnuts that
<PB N="314" REF="315"/>
extended to a part of the convent, com∣municating
immediately with the great
court, when she heard approaching steps,
and; on turning into the walk, perceived
several persons advancing in the shady
distance. Among the voices, as they drew
nearer, she distinguished one whose inte∣resting
tone engaged all her attention,
and began also to awaken memory. She
listened, wondered, doubted, hoped, and
feared! It spoke again! Ellena thought
she could not be deceived in those tender
accents, so full of intelligence, so expressive
of sensibility and refinement. She proceed∣ed
with quicker steps, yet faltered, as she
drew near the group, and paused to dis∣cern
whether among them was any figure
that might accord with the voice and jus∣tify
her hopes.</P>
<P>The voice spoke again; it pronounced,
her name; pronounced it with the trem∣blings
of tenderness and impatience, and
Ellena scarcely dared to trust her senses,
<PB N="315" REF="316"/>
when she beheld Olivia, the nun of San
Stefano, in the cloisters of the Della
Pieta!</P>
<P>Ellena could find no words to express
her joy and surprise on beholding her pre∣server
in safety, and in these quiet groves;
but Olivia repaid all the affectionate ca∣resses
of her young friend, and, while she
promised to explain the circumstance that
had led to her present appearance here,
she, in her turn, made numerous inqui∣ries
relative to Ellena's adventures after
she had quitted San Stefano. They were
now, however, surrounded by too many au∣ditors
to allow of unreserved conversation;
Ellena, therefore, led the nun to her
apartment, and Olivia then explained her
reasons for having left the convent of San
Stefano, which were indeed sufficient to
justify, even with the most rigid devotee,
her conduct as to the change. This un∣fortunate
recluse, it appeared, persecuted
by the suspicions of the abbess, who un∣derstood
<PB N="316" REF="317"/>
that she had assisted in the li∣beration
of Ellena, had petitioned the
bishop of her diocese for leave to remove
to the Santa della Pieta. The abbese had
not proof to proceed formally against her,
as an accomplice in the escape of a novice,
for though Jeronimo could have supplied
the requisite evidence, he was too deeply
implicated in this adventure to do so with∣out
betraying his own conduct. From
his having withheld such proof, it appears,
however, that accident rather than design
had occasioned his failure on the evening
of Ellena's departure from the monastery.
But, though the abbess had not testimony
enough for legal punishment, she was
acquainted with circumstances sufficient
to justify suspicion, and had both the in∣clination
and the power to render Olivia
very miserable.</P>
<P>In her choice of the Santa della Pieta,
the nun was influenced by many conside∣rations,
some of which were the conse∣quence
<PB N="317" REF="318"/>
of conversations she had held with
Ellena respecting the state of that society.
Her design she had been unable to dis∣close
to her friend, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, by a discovery of
such correspondence, the abbess of San
Stefano should obtain grounds on which
to proceed against her. Even in her ap∣peal
to the bishop the utmost caution and
secrecy had been necessary, till the order
for her removal, procured not without
considerable delay and difficulty, arrived,
and when it came, the jealous anger of
the superior rendered an immediate depar∣ture
necessary.</P>
<P>Olivia, during many years, had been
unhappy in her local circumstances, but
it is probable she would have concluded
her days within the walls of San Stefano,
had not the aggravated oppression of the
abbess aroused her courage and activity,
and dissipated the despondency, with
which severe misfortune had obscured her
view.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="319"/>
Ellena was particular in her inquiries
whether any person of the monastery had
suffered for the affistance they had given
her; but learned that not one, except.
Olivia, had been suspected of befriending
her; and then understood, that the vene∣rable
friar, who had dared to unfasten
the gate which restored her with Vivaldi
to liberty, had not been involved by his
kindness.</P>
<P>“It is an embarrassing and rather an
unusual circumstance,” concluded Olivia,
“to change one's convent; but you per∣ceive
the strong reasons which determined
me upon a removal, I was, however, per∣haps,
the more impatient of severe treat∣ment,
since you, my sister, had described
to me the society of <HI>Our Lady of Pity,</HI> and
since I believed it possible that you might
form a part of it. When, on my arrival,
here, I learned that my wishes had not
deceived me on this point, I was impa∣tient
to see you once more, and as soon as
<PB N="319" REF="320"/>
the ceremonies attending an introduction
to the superior were over, I requested to
be conducted to you, and was in search of
you when we met in the avenue, It is un∣necessary
for me to insist upon the satis∣faction,
which this meeting gives me; but
you may not, perhaps, understand how
much the manners of our lady abbess, and
of the sisterhood in general, as far as a
first interview will allow me to judge of
them, have re-animated me, The gloom;
which has long hung over my prospects,
seems now to open, and a distant gleam
promises to light up the evening of my
stormy day.”</P>
<P>Olivia paused and appeared to recollect
herself; this was the first time she had
made so direct a reference to her own
missortunes; and, while Ellena silently
remarked it, and observed the dejection,
which was already stealing upon the ex∣pressive
countenance of the nun, she
wished, yet feared to lead her back towards
the subject of them.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="321"/>
Endeavouring to dismiss some painful
remembrance, and assuming a smile of
languid gaiety, Olivia said, “Now that
I have related the history of my removal,
and sufficiently indulged my egotism, will
you let me hear what adventures have be∣fallen
you, my young friend, since the
melancholy adieu you gave me in the
gardens of San Stefano.”</P>
<P>This was a task, to which Ellena's spi∣rits,
though revived by the presence of
Olivia, were still unequal. Over the
scenes of her past distress Time had not yet
drawn his shadowing veil; the colours
were all too fresh and garish for the meek
dejection of her eye, and the subject was
too intimately connected with that of her
present anxiety, to be reviewed without
very painful feelings. She therefore re∣quested
Olivia to spare her from a detail
of particulars, which she could not recol∣lect
but with extreme reluctance; and,
serupulously observing the injunction of
<PB N="321" REF="322"/>
Schedoni, she merely mentioned her se∣paration
from Vivaldi upon the banks of
the Celano, and that a variety of distress∣ing
circumstances had intervened before
she could regain the sanctuary of the della
Pieta.</P>
<P>Olivia understood too well the kind of
feelings, from which Ellena was desirous
of escaping, willingly to subject her to a
renewal of them; and felt too mach ge∣nerous
compassion for her sufferings not
to endeavour to foothe the sense of them
by an exertion of those delicate and name∣less
arts which, while they mock detec∣tion,
fascinate the weary spirit as by a
charm of magic!</P>
<P>The friends continued in conversation,
till a chime from a chapel of the convent
summoned them to the last vespers; and,
when the service had concluded, they se∣parated
for the night.</P>
<P>With the society of the Santa della
Pieta, Olivia had thus sound an asylum
<PB N="322" REF="323"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch as till lately she had never dared to
hope for; but, though she frequently ex∣pressed
her sense of this blessing, it was
seldom without tears; and Ellena ob∣served,
with some surprise and more dis∣appointment,
within a very few days after
her arrival, a cloud of melancholy spreading
again over her mind.</P>
<P>But a nearer interest soon withdrew
Ellena's attention from Olivia to fix it
upon Vivaldi; and, when she saw her in∣firm
old servant, Beatrice, enter a cham∣ber
of the convent, she anticipated that
the knowledge of some extraordinary, and
probably unhappy, event had brought her.
She knew too well the circumspection of
Schedoni to believe that Beatrice came
commissioned from him; and as the un∣certain
situation of Vivaldi was so con∣stantly
the subject of her anxiety, she im∣mediately
concluded that her servant came
to announce some evil relative to him.—
His indisposition, perhaps his actual con∣finement
<PB N="323" REF="324"/>
in the Inquisition, which lately
she had sometimes been inclined to think,
might not have been a mere menace to
Vivaldi, though it had proved to be no
more to herself—or possibly she came to
tell of his death—his death in those pri∣sons!
This last was a possibility that
almost incapacitated her for inquiring
what was the errand of Beatrice.</P>
<P>The old servant, trembling and wan,
either from the fatigue of her walk, or
from a consciousness of disastrous intelli∣gence,
seated herself without speaking,
and some moments elapsed before she
could be prevailed with to answer the re∣peated
inquiries of Ellena.</P>
<P>“O Signora!” said she, at length,
“you do not know what it is to walk up
hill such a long way, at my age! Well!
heaven protect you, I nope you never
will!”</P>
<P>“I perceive you bring ill news,” said
Ellena; “I am prepared for it, and you
need not fear to tell me all you know.”</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="325"/>
“Holy San Marco!” exclaimed Bea∣trice,
“if death be ill news, you have
guessed right, Signora, for I do bring
news of that, it is certain. How came
you, Lady, to know my errand? They
have been beforehand with me, I see,
though I have not walked so fast up hill
this many a day, as I have now, to tell
you what has happened.”</P>
<P>She stopped on observing the changing
countenance of Ellena, who tremulously
called upon her to explain what had hap∣pened
—who was dead; and entreated
her to relate the particulars as speedily as
possible.</P>
<P>“You said you was prepared, Sig∣nora,”
said Beatrice, “but your looks tell
another tale.”—</P>
<P>“What is the event you would dis∣close?”
said Ellena, almost breathless.
“When did it happen?—be brief.”</P>
<P>“I cannot tell exactly when it hap∣pened,
Signora, but it was an own ser∣vant
<PB N="325" REF="326"/>
of the Marchese's that I had it
from.”</P>
<P>“The Marchese's?” interrupted Ellena
in a faltering voice.</P>
<P>“Aye, Lady? you will say that is
pretty good authority.</P>
<P>“Death! and in the Marchese's fa∣mily!”
exclaimed Ellena.</P>
<P>“Yes, Signora, I had it from his own
servant. He was passing by the garden∣gate
just as I happened to be speaking to
the maccaroni-man.—But you are ill,
Lady!”—</P>
<P>“I am very well, if you will but pro∣ceed,”
replied Ellena, saintly, while her
eyes were fixed upon Beatrice, as if they
only had power to enforce her meaning.</P>
<P>““Well, dame,” he says to me, “I have
not seen you of a long time.” “No,” says
I, “that is a great grievance truly! for
old women now-a-days are not much
thought of; out of fight out of mind with
them, now-a-days!”—</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="327"/>
“I beseech you to the purpose,” inter∣rupted
Ellena. “Whose death did he
announce?” She had not courage to
pronounce Vivaldi's name.</P>
<P>“You shall hear, Signora. I saw he
looked in a sort of a bustle, so I asked him
how all did at the Palazzo: so he answers,
“Bad enough, Signora Beatrice, have not
you heard?” “Heard,” says I; “what should
I have heard?” “Why,” says he, “of what
has just happened in our family.”</P>
<P>“O heavens!” exclaimed Ellena, “he
is dead! Vivaldi is dead.”</P>
<P>“You shall hear, Signora,” continued
Beatrice.</P>
<P>“Be brief!” said Ellena, “answer me
simply yes or no.”</P>
<P>“I cannot, till I come to the right
place, Signora; if you will but have a
little patience, you shall hear all. But if
you fluster me so, you will put me quite
out.”</P>
<P>“Grant me patience!” said Ellena,
endeavouring to calm her spirits.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="328"/>
“With that, Signora, I asked him to
Walk in and rest himself, and tell me
all about it. He answered, he was
in a great hurry, and could not stay
a moment, and a great deal of that sort;
but I, knowing that whatever happened
in that family, Signora, was something
to you, would not let him go off so ea∣sily;
and so, when I asked him to refresh
himself with a glass of lemon-ice, he for∣got
all his business in a minute, and we
had a long chat.”</P>
<P>And Beatrice might now have conti∣nued
her circumlocution, perhaps as long as
she had pleated, for Ellena had lost all
power to urge inquiry, and was scarcely
sensible of what was said. She neither
spoke, nor shed a tear; the one image
that possessed her fancy, the image of
Vivaldi dead seemed to hold all her facul∣ties,
as by a spell.</P>
<P>“So when I asked him,” added Beatrice,
“again what had happened, he was ready
<PB N="328" REF="329"/>
enough to tell all about it. “It is near a
month ago” said he, “since she was first
taken; the Marchesa had been”—</P>
<P>“The Marchesa!” repeated Ellena,
with whom that one word had dissolved
the spell of terror—“the Marchesa!”</P>
<P>“Yes Signora, to be sure. Who else
did I say it was!”</P>
<P>“Go on, Beatrice; the Marchesa?”—</P>
<P>“What makes you look so glad all of
a sudden, Signora? I thought just now
you was very sorry about it. What! I
warrant you was thinking about my young
lord, Vivaldi.”</P>
<P>“Proceed,”said Ellena.</P>
<P>“Well!” added Beatrice, “It was
about a month ago that the Marchesa was
first taken, continued the varlet. “She
had seemed poorly a long time, but it was
from a <HI>conversazione</HI> at the di Voglio pa∣lazzo,
that she came home so ill. It is
supposed she had been long in a bad state
of health, but nobody thought her so near
<PB N="329" REF="330"/>
her end, till the doctors were called to∣gether;
and then matters looked very bad
indeed. They found out that she had
been dying, or as good, for many years,
though nobody else had suspected it, and
the Marchesa's own physician was blamed
for not finding it out before. But he,”
added the rogue, “had a regard for my
lady. He was very obstinate, too, for he
kept saying almost to the last, there was
no danger, when every body else saw how
it was going. The other doctors soon
made their words good, and my lady
died.”</P>
<P>“And her son”—said Ellena, “was he
with the Marchesa when she expired.”</P>
<P>“What, Signor Vivaldi, lady? No,
the Signor was not there.”</P>
<P>“That is very, extraordinary!” observed
Ellena with emotion. “Did the servant
mention him?”</P>
<P>“Yes, Signora; he said what a sad
thing it was that he should be out of the
<PB N="330" REF="331"/>
way at that time, and nobody know
where!”</P>
<P>“Are his family then ignorant where
he is?” asked Ellena, with increased emo∣tion.</P>
<P>“To be sure they are, lady, and have
been for these many weeks. They have
heard nothing at all of the Signor, or one
Paulo M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>drico, his servent, though the
Marchesa's people have been riding post
after them from one end of the kingdom
to the other all the time!”</P>
<P>Shocked with the conviction of a cir∣cumstance,
which, till lately she scarcely
believed was possible, the imprisonment
of Vivaldi in the Inquisition, Ellena lost
for a while all power of further inquiry;
but Beatrice proceeded.</P>
<P>“The Lady Marchesa seemed to lay
something much to heart, as the man told
me, and often inquired for Signor Vin∣centio.”</P>
<P>“The Marchesa you are sure then was
ignorant where he was?” said Ellena,
<PB N="331" REF="332"/>
with new astonishment and perplexity as
to the person who, after betraying him into
the Inquisition, could yet have suffered
her, though arrested at the same time, to
escape.</P>
<P>“Yes, Signora, for she wanted sadly
to see him. And when she was dying,
she sent for her Confessor, one father
Schedoni, I think they call him, and”—</P>
<P>“What of him? said Ellena incau∣tiously.</P>
<P>“Nothing, Signora, for he could not
be found.”</P>
<P>“Not be found!” repeated Ellena.</P>
<P>“No, Signora, not just then; he was
Confessor, I warrant, to other people be∣side
the Marchesa, and I dare say they had
sins enough to confess, so he could not
get away in a hurry.”</P>
<P>Ellena recollected herself sufficiently to
ask no further of Schedoni; and, when she
considered the probable cause of Vivaldi's
arrest, she was again consoled by a belief
<PB N="332" REF="333"/>
that he had not fallen into the power of
real officials, since the comrades of the
men who had arrested him, had proved
themselves otherwise; and she thought it
highly probable, that, while undiscovered
by his family, he had been, and was still
engaged in searching for the place of her
confinement.</P>
<P>“But I was saying,” proceeded Beatrice,
“what a bustle there was when my lady,
the Marchesa was dying. As this father
Schedoni was not to be found, another
Confessor was sent for, and shut up with
her for along while indeed! And then
my Lord Marchese was called in, and
there seemed to be a deal going forward,
for my Lord was heard every now and then
by the attendants in the anti-chamber,
talking loud, and” sometimes my Lady
Marchesa's voice was heard too, though
she was so ill! At last all was silent, and
after some time my Lord came put of the
room, and he seemed very much flustered;
<PB N="333" REF="334"/>
they say, that is, very angry and yet very
sorrowful. But the Confessor remained
with my Lady for a long while after; and,
when he departed, my Lady appeared
more unhappy than ever. “She lived all
that night and part of the next day, and
something seemed to lie very heavy at her
heart, for she sometimes wept, but oftener
groaned, and would look so, that it was
piteous to see her. She frequently asked
for the Marchese, and when he came, the
attendants were sent away, and they held
long conferences by themselves. The Con∣fessor
also was sent for again, just at the last,
and they were all shut up together. After
this, my Lady appeared more easy in her
mind, and not long after she died.”</P>
<P>Ellena, who had attended closely to
this little narrative, was prevented for the
present from asking the few questions
which it had suggested, by the entrance
of Olivia, who, on perceiving a stranger,
was retiring, but Ellena, not considering
<PB N="334" REF="335"/>
these inquiries as important, prevail∣ed
with the nun to take a chair
at the embroidery frame she had lately
quitted.</P>
<P>After conversing for a few moments
with Olivia, she returned to a considera∣tion
of her own interests. The absence
of Schedoni still appeared to her as some∣thing
more than accidental; and, though
she could not urge any inquiry with Bea∣trice,
concerning the monk of the Spirito
Santo, she ventured to ask whether she
had lately seen the stranger, who had re∣stored
her to Altieri, for Beatrice knew
him only in the character of Ellena's de∣liverer.</P>
<P>“No, Signora,” replied Beatrice rather
sharply, “I have never seen his face since
he attended you to the villa, though for
that matter, I did not see much of it there;
and then how he contrived to let himself out
of the house that night without my seeing
him, I cannot divine, though I have thought
<PB N="335" REF="336"/>
of it often enough since. I am sure he
need not to have been ashamed to have
shewn his face to me, for I should only
have blessed him for bringing you safe
home again!”</P>
<P>Ellena was somewhat surprized to find
that Beatrice had noticed a circumstance
apparently so trivial, and replied, that she
had herself opened the door for her pro∣tector.</P>
<P>While Beatrice spoke, Olivia raising
her eyes from the embroidery, had fixed
them upon the old servant, who respect∣fully
withdrew her's; but, when the nun
was again engaged on her work, she re∣sumed
her observation. Ellena fancied
she perceived, something extraordinary in
this mutual examination, although the
curiosity of strangers towards each other
might have accounted for it.</P>
<P>Beatrice then received directions from
Ellena as to some drawings, which she
wished to have sent to the convent, and
<PB N="336" REF="337"/>
when the servant spoke in reply, Olivia
again raised her eyes, and fixed them on
her face with intense curiosity.</P>
<P>“I certainly ought to know that voice,”
said the nun with great emotion, “though
I dare not judge from your features. Is
it,—can it be possible!—is it Beatrice
Olca, to whom I speak? So many years
have passed”—</P>
<P>Beatrice with equal surprize answered,
“It is, Signora; you are right in my
name. But, lady, who are you that
know me?”</P>
<P>While she earnestly regarded Olivia,
there was an expression of dismay in her
look, which increased Ellena's perplexity.
The nun's complexion varied every instant,
and her words failed when she attempted
to speak. Beatrice meanwhile exclaimed,
“My eyes deceive me! yet there is a
strange likeness. Santa della Pieta! how it
has fluttered me! my heart beats still—
you are so like her, lady, yet you are very
different too.”</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="338"/>
Olivia, whose regards were now entirely
fixed upon Ellena, said in a voice that
was scarcely, articulate, while her whole
frame seemed sinking beneath some irresis∣tible
feeling, “Tell me, Beatrice, I con∣jure
you, quickly say, who is this?”—
She pointed to Ellena, and the sentence
died on her lips.</P>
<P>Beatrice wholly occupied by interests
of her own, gave no reply, but exclaimed,
“It is in truth the Lady Olivia! It is
herself! In the name of all that is sacred,
how came you here? O! how glad you
must have been to find-one another out!”
She looked, still gasping with astonish∣ment,
at Olivia, while Ellena, unheard,
repeatedly inquired the meaning of her
words, and in the next moment found
herself pressed to the bosom of the nun,
who seemed better to have understood
them, and who weeping, trembling, and
almost fainting, held her there in silence.</P>
<P>Ellena, after some moments had thus
passed, requested an explanation of what
<PB N="338" REF="339"/>
she witnessed, and Beatrice at the same
time demanded the cause of all this emo∣tion.
“For can it be that you did not
know one another?” she added.</P>
<P>“What new discovery is this?” said
Ellena, fearfully to the nun. “It is but
lately that I have found my father! O tell
me by what tender name I am to call
you?”</P>
<P>“Your father!” exclaimed Olivia.</P>
<P>“Your father, lady!” echoed Beatrice.</P>
<P>Ellena, betrayed by strong emotion into
this premature mention of Schédoni, was
embarrassed and remained silent.</P>
<P>“No, my child!” said Olivia, soften∣ing
from amazement into tones of ineffable
sorrow, while she again pressed Ellena to
her heart—“No!—thy father is in the
grave!”</P>
<P>Ellena no longer returned her caresses;
surprize and doubt suspended every tender
emotion; she gazed upon Olivia with an
intenseness that partook of wildness. At
<PB N="339" REF="340"/>
length she said slowly—” It is my mother,
then, whom I see! When will these dis∣coveries
end!”</P>
<P>“It is your mother!” replied Olivia
solemnly, “a mother's blessing rests with
you!”</P>
<P>The nun endeavoured to soothe the
agitated spirits of Ellena, though she was
herself nearly overwhelmed by the various
and acute feelings this disclosure occa∣sioned.
For a considerable time they were
unable to speak but in short sentences of
affectionate exclamation, but joy was evi∣dently
a more predominant feeling with
the parent than with the child. When,
however, Ellena could weep, she became
more tranquil, and by degrees was sen∣sible
of a degree of happiness, such as she
had perhaps never experienced.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Beatrice seemed lost in
amazement mingled with fear. She ex∣pressed
no pleasure, notwithstanding the
the joy she witnessed, but was uniformly
grave and observant.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="341"/>
Olivia, when she recovered some degree
of composure, inquired for her sister
Bianchi. The silence and sudden dejec∣tion
of Ellena indicated the truth. On
this mention of her late mistress, Beatrice
recovered the use of speech.</P>
<P>“Alas! lady,” said the old servant,
“she is now where I believed you were!
and I should as soon have expected to see
my dear mistress here as yourself!”</P>
<P>Olivia, though affected by this intelli∣gence,
did not feel it with the acuteness she
would have done probably at any other
moment. After she had indulged her
tears, she added, that from the unusual
silence of Bianchi, she had suspected the
truth, and particularly since not any an∣swer
had been returned to the letter she
had sent to Altieri upon her arrival at the
Santa della Piéta.</P>
<P>“Alas!” said Beatrice, “I wonder
much my lady abbess failed to tell you
the sad news, for she knew it too well!—
<PB N="341" REF="342"/>
My dear mistress is buried in the church
here! as for the letter, I have brought it
with me for Signora Ellena to open.”</P>
<P>“The lady abbess is not informed of
our relationship,” replied Olivia, “and I
have particular reasons for wishing that at
present she should remain ignorant of it.
Even you, my Ellena, must appear only
as my friend, till some inquiries have been
made, which are essential to my peace.”</P>
<P>Olivia required an explanation of El∣lena's
late extraordinary assertion respect∣ing
her father, but this was a request
made with emotions very different from
those which hope or joy inspire. Ellena, be∣lieving
that the same circumstances which
had deceived herself during so many years,
as to his death, had also misled Olivia,
was not surprized at the incredulity her
mother had shewn, but she was conside∣rably
embarrassed how to answer her in∣quiries.
It was now too late to observe
the promise of secrecy extorted from her
<PB N="342" REF="343"/>
by Schedoni; the first moments of sur∣prize
had betrayed her: yet, while she
trembled further to transgress his injunc∣tion,
she perceived that a fall explanation
was now unavoidable. And, since Ellena
considered, that as Schedoni could not
have, foreseen her present peculiar situ∣tion,
his command had no reference to
her mother, her seruples on this head dis∣appeared.
When, therefore, Beatrice had
withdrawn, Ellena repeated her assertion,
that her father still lived; which, though
it increased the amazement of Olivia, did
not vanquish her incredulity. Olivia's
tears flowed fast, while in contra diction to
this assurance, she mentioned the year in
which the Count de Bruno died, with
some circumstances relative to his death;
which, however, as Ellena understood
that her mother had not witnessed it, she
still believed had not happened. To
confirm her late assertion, Ellena then
related a few particulars of her second
<PB N="343" REF="344"/>
interview with Schedoni, and as some
confirmation that he lived, offered to
produce the portrait, which he had claimed
as his own. Olivia, in great agitation,
requested to see the miniature, and Ellena
left the apartment in search of it.</P>
<P>Every moment of her absence was to
Olivia's expectation lengthened to an
hour; she paced the room; listened for a
footstep; endeavoured to tranquillize her
spirits, and still Ellena did not return.
Some strange mystery seemed to lurk in
the narrative she had just heard, which
she wished, yet dreaded to develope; and
when, at length, Ellena appeared with
the miniature, she took it in trembling
eagerness, and haying gazed upon it for
an instant, her Complexion faded and she
fainted.</P>
<P>Ellena had now no doubt respecting the
truth of Schedoni's declaration, and blam∣ed
herself for not having more gradually
prepared her mother for the knowledge of
<PB N="344" REF="345"/>
a circumstance, which she believed had
overwhelmed her with joy. The usual
applications, however, soon restored Oli∣via,
who, when she was again alone with
her daughter, desired to behold once
more the portrait. Ellena, attributing the
strong emotion, with which she still regard∣ed
it, to surprize, and fear lest she was ad∣mitting
a fallacious hope, endeavoured to
comfort her by renewed assurances, that
not only the Count di Bruno yet existed,
but that he lived at this very time in
Naples, and further, that he would pro∣bably
be in her presence within the hour,
“When I quitted the room for the minia∣ture,”
added Ellena, “I dispatched a
person with a note, requesting to see my
father immediately, being impatient to
realize the joy, which such a meeting be∣tween
my long lost parents must occasion.”</P>
<P>In this instance Ellena had certainly
suffered her generous sympathy to over∣come
her discretion, for, though the con∣tents
<PB N="345" REF="346"/>
of the note to Schedoni could not
positively have betrayed him, had he even
been in Naples at this time, her sending it
to the Spirito Santo, instead of the place
which he had appointed for his letters,
might have led to a premature inquiry re∣specting
herself.</P>
<P>While Ellena had acquainted Olivia
that Schedoni would probably be with
them soon, she watched eagerly for the
joyful surprize she expected would appear
on her countenance; how severe then
was her disappointment when only terror
and dismay were expressed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there! and,
when, in the next<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> moment her mother
uttered exclamations of distress and even
of despair!</P>
<P>“If he sees me,” said Olivia, “I am
irrecoverably lost! O! unhappy Ellena!
your precipitancy has destroyed me. The
original of this portrait is not the Count di
Bruno, <HI>my</HI> dear lord, nor your parent,
but his brother, the cruel husband”—</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="347"/>
Olivia left the sentence unfinished,
as if she was betraying more than was at
present discreet; but Ellena, whom asto∣nishment
had kept silent, now entreated
that she would explain her words, and
the cause of her distress.</P>
<P>“I know not,” said Olivia, “by what
means that portrait has been conveyed to
you; but it is the resemblance of the
Count Ferando di Bruno, the brother of
my lord, and my”—second husband she
should have said, but her lips refused to
honour him with the title.</P>
<P>She paused and was much affected, but
presently added—</P>
<P>“I cannot at present explain the subject
more fully, for it is to me a very distressing
one. Let me rather consider the means
of avoiding an interview with di Bruno,
and even of concealing, if possible, that
I exist.”</P>
<P>Olivia was, however, soothed when she
understood that Ellena had not named her
<PB N="347" REF="348"/>
in the note, but had merely desired to see
the Confessor upon a very particular oc∣casion.</P>
<P>While they were consulting upon the
excuse it would be necessary to form for
this imprudent summons, the messenger
returned with the note unopened, and
with information, that father Schedoni
was abroad on a pilgrimage, which was
the explanation the brothers of the Spirito
Santo chose to give of his absence; judg∣ing
it prudent, for the honour of their
convent, to conceal his real situation.</P>
<P>Olivia, thus released from her fears,
consented to explain some points of the
subject so interesting to Ellena; but it
was not till several days after this discovery,
that she could, sufficiently command her
spirits to relate the whole of her narrative.
The first part of it agreed perfectly with the
account delivered in the confession to the
penitentiary Ansaldo; that which follows
was known only to herself, her sister
<PB N="348" REF="349"/>
Bianchi, a physician, and one faithful
servant, who had been considerably en∣trusted
with the conduct of the plan.</P>
<P>It may be recollected that, Schedoni
left his house immediately after the
act, which was designed to be fatal to the
Countess his wife, and that she was car∣ried
senseless to her chamber. The
wound, as appears, was not mortal. But
the atrocity of the intent determined her
to seize the opportunity thus offered by
the absence of Schedoni, and her own
peculiar circumstances, to release herself
from his tyranny without having recourse
to a court of justice, which would have
covered with infamy the brother of
her first husband. She withdrew,
therefore, from his house for ever, and
with the assistance of the three persons
before-mentioned, retired to a remote part
of Italy, and sought refuge in the convent
of San Stesano, while at home the report of
her death was confirmed by a public funeral.
<PB N="349" REF="350"/>
Bianchi remained for some time after the
departure of Olivia, in her own residence
near the Villa di Bruno, having taken
under her immediate care the daughter of
the Countess and of the first Count di
Bruno, as well as ah infant daughter of
the second.</P>
<P>After some time had elapsed, Bianchi
withdrew with her young charge, but not
to the neighbourhood of San Stesano.
The indulgence of a mother's tenderness
was denied to Olivia, for Bianchi could
could not reside near the convent without
subjecting her to the hazard of a discovery,
since Schedoni, though he now believed
the report of her death, might be led to
doubt it, by the conduct of Bianchi,
whose steps would probably be observed
by him. She chose a residence, therefore,
at a distance from Olivia, though not yet at
Altieri. At this period, Ellena was not two
years old; the daughter of Schedoni was
scarcely as many months, and she died
<PB N="350" REF="351"/>
before the year concluded. It was this his
child, for whom the Confessor, who had
too well concealed himself to permit Bianchi
to acquaint him with her death, had mis∣taken
Ellena, and to which mistake his
own portrait, affirmed by Ellena to be
that of her father, had contributed. This
miniature she had found in the cabinet of
Bianchi after her aunt's decease, and, ob∣serving
it inscribed with the title of Count
di Bruno, she had worn it with a filial
fondness ever since that period.</P>
<P>Bianchi, when she had acquainted
Ellena with the secret of her birth, was
withheld, both by prudence and humanity,
from intrusting her with a knowledge that
her mother lived; but this, no doubt, was
the circumstance she appeared so anxious
to disclose on her death-bed, when the
suddenness of her disorder had deprived
her of the power. The abruptness ot
that event had thus contributed to keep
the mother and daughter unknown to
<PB N="351" REF="352"/>
each other, even when they afterwards
accidentally met, to which concealment
the name of Rosalba, given to Ellena
from her infancy by Bianchi, for the pur∣pose
of protecting her from discovery by
her uncle, had assisted. Beatrice, who
was not the domestic intrusted with the
escape of Olivia, had believed the report
of her death, and thus, though she knew
Ellena to be the daughter of the Countess
di Bruno, she could never have been a
means of discovering them to each other,
had it not happened that Olivia recognized
this ancient servant of Bianchi, while
Ellena was present.</P>
<P>When Bianchi came to reside in the
neighbourhood of Naples, she was unsus∣picious
that Schedoni, who had never
been heard of since the night of the assassination, inhabited there; and she so
seldom left her house, that it is not sur∣prizing
she should never happen to meet
him, at least consciously; for her veil,
<PB N="352" REF="353"/>
and the monk's cowl, might easily have
concealed them from each other if they
had met.</P>
<P>It appears to have been the intention of
Bianchi to disclose to Vivaldi the family of
Ellena, before their nuptials were solem∣nized;
since, on the evening of their last
conversation, she had declared, when her
spirits were exhausted by the exertion she
had made, that much remained for her to
say, which weakness obliged her to defer
till another opportunity. Her unexpected
death prevented any future meeting.
That she had not sooner intended to make
a communication, which might have re∣moved,
in a considerable degree, the ob∣jection
of the Vivaldi to a connection with
Ellena, appears extraordinary, till other
circumstances of her family, than that of
its nobility, are considered. Her present
indigence, and yet more, the guilt attach∣ed
to an individual of the di Bruno, it was
reasonable to suppose would operate as a
<PB N="353" REF="354"/>
full antidote to the allurement of rank,
however jealous of birth the Vivaldi had
proved themselves.</P>
<P>Ferando di Bruno had contrived, even
in the short interval between the death of
his brother and the supposed decease of
his wife, again to embarrass his affairs,
and soon after his flight, the income aris∣ing
from what remained of his landed
property had been seized upon by his
creditors, whether lawfully or not, he
was then in a situation which did not per∣mit
him to contest, and Ellena was thus
left wholly dependent upon her aunt.
The small fortune of Bianchi had been
diminished by the assistance she afforded
Olivia, for whose admittance into the
convent of San Stefano it had been neces∣sary
to advance a considerable sum; and
her original income was afterwards re∣duced
by the purchase of the villa Altieri.
This expenditure, however, was not an
imprudent one, since she preferred the
<PB N="354" REF="355"/>
comforts and independence of a pleasant
home, with industry, to the indulgence
of an indolence which must have confined
her to an inferior residence; and was
acquainted with the means of making this
industry profitable without being disho∣nourable.
She excelled in many elegant
and ingenious arts, and the productions
of her pencil and needle were privately
disposed of to the nuns of the Santa della
Pieta. When Ellena was of an age to
assist her, she resigned much of the em∣ployment
and the profit to her niece,
whose genius having unfolded itself, the
beauty of her designs and the elegance of
her execution, both in drawings and em∣broidery,
were so highly valued by the
purchasers at the grate of the convent, that
Bianchi committed to Ellena altogether
the exercise of her art.</P>
<P>Olivia meanwhile had dedicated her life
to devotion in the monastery of San Ste∣fano,
a choice which was willingly made
<PB N="355" REF="356"/>
while her mind was yet softened by grief
for the death of her first lord, and wearied
by the cruelty she had afterwards experi∣enced.
The first years of her retirement
were passed in tranquillity, except when the
remembrance of her child, whom she did
not dare to see at the convent, awakened
a parental pang. With Bianchi she,
however, corresponded as regularly as
opportunity would allow, and had at least
the consolation of knowing, that the ob∣ject
most dear to her lived, till, within a
short period of Ellena's arrival at the
very asylum chosen by her mother, her
apprehensions were in some degree excited
by the unusual silence of Bianchi.</P>
<P>When Olivia had first seen Ellena in
the chapel of San Stefano, she was struck
with a slight resemblance she bore to the
late Count di Bruno, and had frequently
afterwards examined her features with a
most painful curiosity; but, circumstanced
as she was, Olivia could not reasonably
<PB N="356" REF="357"/>
suspect the stranger to be her daughter.
Once, however, a sense of this possibility
so far overcame her judgment, as to
prompt an inquiry for the sirname of
Ellena; but the mention of Rosalba had
checked all further conjecture. What
would have been the feelings of the nun,
had she been told when her generous
compassion was assisting a stranger to
escape from oppression that she was pre∣serving
her own child! It may be worthy
of observation, that the virtues of Olivia,
exerted in a general cause, had thus led
her unconsciously to the happiness of
saving her daughter; while the vices of
Schedoni had as unconsciously urged him
nearly to destroy his niece, and had always
been preventing, by the means they
prompted him to employ, the success of
his constant aim.</P>

<L>Pallid to thought and ghastly!”</L></Q>
<BIBL>YOUNG.</BIBL>
<P>THE Marchesa di Vivaldi, of whose
death Beatrice had given an imperfect
account, struck with remorse of the crime
she had meditated against Ellena, and
with terror of the punishment due to it,
had sent, when on her death-bed, for a
Confessor, to whom she uhburthened her
conscience, and from whom she hoped
to receive, in return, an alleviation of
her despair. This Confessor was a man
of good sense and humanity; and, when
he fully understood the story of Vivaldi
and Ellena di Rosalba, he declared, that
<PB N="358" REF="359"/>
her only hope of forgiveness, both for
the crime she had meditated, and the un∣deserved
sufferings she had occasioned,
rested upon her willingness to make those
now happy, whom she had formerly ren∣dered
miserable. Her conscience had al∣ready
given her the same lesson; and,
now that she was sinking to that grave
which levels all distinctions, and had
her just fear of retribution no longer op∣posed
by her pride, she became as anxious
to promote the marriage of Vivaldi with
Ellena as she had ever been to prevent it.
She sent, therefore, for the Marchese;
and, having made an avowal of the arts
she had practised against the peace and
reputation of Ellena, without, however,
confessing the full extent of her intended
crimes, she made it her last request, that
he would consent to the happiness of
his son.</P>
<P>The Marchese, however, shocked as
he was at this discovery of the duplicity
<PB N="359" REF="360"/>
and cruelty of his wife, had neither her
terror of the future, or remorse for the
past, to overcome his objection to the
rank of Ellena; and he resisted all
her importunity, till the anguish of her
last hours overcame every consideration
but that of affording her relief; he then
gave a solemn promise, in the presence
of the Confessor, that he would no lon∣ger
oppose the marriage of Vivaldi and
Ellena, should the former persist in his
attachment to her. This promise was
sufficient for the Marchesa, and she died
with some degree of resignation. It did
not, however, appear probable, that the
Marchese would soon be called upon to
fulfil the engagements, into which he had
so unwillingly entered, every inquiry after
Vivaldi having been hitherto ineffectual.</P>
<P>During the progress of this fruitless
search for his son, and while the Mar∣chese
was almost lamenting him as dead,
the inhabitants of the Vivaldi palace
<PB N="360" REF="361"/>
were, one night, aroused from sleep by a
violent knocking at the great gate of the
court. The noise was so loud and inces∣sant,
that, before the porter could obey
the summons, the Marchese, whose apart∣ment
looked upon the court, was alarm∣ed,
and sent an attendant from his anti∣room,
to inquire the occasion of it.</P>
<P>Presently a voice was heard from the
first anti-chamber, exclaiming, “I must
see my Lord Marchese directly; he will
not be angry to be waked, when he
knows all about it;” and, before the
Marchese could order that no person, on
whatever pretence, should be admitted,
Paulo, haggard, ragged, and covered with
dirt, was in the chamber. His wan and
affrighted countenance, his disordered
dress, and his very attitude, as on enter∣ing
he half turned to look back upon
the anti-rooms, like one, who, just es∣caped
from bondage, listens to the fan∣cied
sounds of pursuit, were altogether
<PB N="361" REF="362"/>
so suiking and terrific, that the Marchese,
anticipating some dreadful news of Vi∣valdi,
had scarcely power to inquire for
him. Paulo, however, rendered ques∣tions
unnecessary; for, without any cir∣cumlocution,
or preface, he immedi∣ately
informed the Marchese, that the
Signor, his dear master, was in the pri∣sons
of the Inquisition, at Rome, if, in∣deed,
they had not put an end to him be∣fore
that time.”</P>
<P>“Yes, my Lord,” said Paulo, “I am
just got out myself, for they would not
let me be with the Signor, so it was of
no use to stay there any longer. Yet it
was a hard matter with me to go away,
and leave my deaf master within those
disinal walls; and nothing should have
persuaded me to do so, but that I hoped,
when your Lordship knew where the Sig∣nor
was, you might be able to get him
out. But there is not a minute to be lost,
my Lord, for when once a gentleman has
<PB N="362" REF="363"/>
got within the claws of those inquisitors,
there is no knowing how soon they may
take it in their heads to tear him in
pieces. Shall I order horses for Rome,
my Lord? I am ready to set off again
directly.”</P>
<P>The suddenness of such intelligence,
concerning an only son, might have agi∣tated
stronger nerves than those of the
Marchese, and so much was he shocked
by it, that he could not immediately de∣termine
how to proceed, or give any
answer to Paulo's repeated questions.
When, however, he became sufficiently
recollected to make further inquiry into
the situation of Vivaldi, he perceived the
necessity of an immediate journey; but
first it would be prudent to consult with
some friends, whose connections at Rome
might be a means of greatly facilitating
the important purpose, which led him
thither, and this could not be done till
the following morning. Yet, he gave
orders, that preparation should be made
<PB N="363" REF="364"/>
for his setting out at a moment's notice;
and, having listened to as full an account
as Paulo could give of the past and pre∣sent
circumstances of Vivaldi, he dis∣missed
him to repose for the remainder of
the night.</P>
<P>Paulo, however, though much in want
of rest, was in too great an agitation of
spirits either to seek or to find it; and the
fear he had indicated, on entering the
Marchese's apartment, proceeded from
the hurry of his mind, rather than from
any positive apprehension of new evil.
For his liberty he was indebted to the
young centinel, who had on a former oc∣casion
been removed from the door of
his prison, but who, by means of the
guard, to whom Vivaldi had given mo∣ney,
as he returned one night from the
tribunal, had since been able to commu∣nicate
with him. This man, of a na∣ture
too humane for his situation, was
become wretched in it, and he deter∣mined
<PB N="364" REF="365"/>
to escape from his office before
the expiration of the time, for which he
had been engaged. He thought that to
be a guard over prisoners was nearly as
miserable as being a prisoner himself. “I
see no difference between them,” said he,
“except that the prisoner watches on one
side of the door, and the centinel on the
other.”</P>
<P>With the resolution to release himself,
he conferred with Paulo, whose good na∣ture
and feeling heart, among so many
people of a contrary character, had won
his confidence and affection, and he laid
his plan of escape so well, that it was on
the point of succeeding, when Paulo's
obstinacy in attempting an impossibility
had nearly counteracted the whole. It
went to his heart, he said, to leave his
master in prison, while he himself was
to march off in safety, and he would
run the risk of his neck, rather than
have such a deed upon his head. He
<PB N="365" REF="366"/>
proposed, therefore, as Vivaldi's guards
were of too ferocious a nature to be tam∣pered
with, to scale a wall of the court
into which a grate of Vivaldi's dungeon
looked. But had this lofty wall been
practicable, the grate was not; and the
attempt had nearly cost Paulo not only his
liberty, but his life.</P>
<P>When, at length, he had made his
way through the perilous avenues of the
prison, and was fairly beyond the walls,
he could hardly be prevailed upon by his
companion to leave them. For near an
hour, he wandered under their shade,
weeping and exclaiming, and calling up∣on
his dear master, at the evident hazard
of being retaken; and probably would
have remained there much longer, had
not the dawn of morning rendered his
companion desperate. Just, however, as
the man was forcing him away, Paulo
fancied he distinguished, by the strength∣ening
light, the roof of that par∣ticular
<PB N="366" REF="367"/>
building, in whose dungeon his
master was confined, and the appearance
of Vivaldi himself could scarcely have
occasioned a more sudden burst of joy;
succeeded by one of grief. “It is the
roof, it is the very roof!” exclaimed
Paulo, vaulting from the ground, and
clapping his hands; “it is the roof, the
roof! O, my master, my master! the
roof, the roof!” He continued alter∣nately
to exclaim, “My master! the
roof! my master! the roof!” till his
companion began to fear he was frantic,
while tears streamed down his cheeks,
and every look and gesture expressed the
most extravagant and whimsical union of
joy and sorrow. At length, the absolute
terror of discovery compelled his compa∣nion
to force him from the spot; when,
having lost sight of the building which
inclosed Vivaldi, he set off for Naples
with a speed that defied all interruption,
and arrived there in the condition, which
<PB N="367" REF="368"/>
has been mentioned, having taken no
sleep, and scarcely any sustenance, since
he left the Inquisition. Yet though in this
exhausted state, the spirit of his affection
remained unbroken, and, when, on the
following morning, the Marchese quit∣ted
Naples, neither his weariness, nor
the imminent danger, to which this jour∣ney
must expose him, could prevent his
attending him to Rome.</P>
<P>The rank of the Marchese, and the
influence he was known to possess at
the court of Naples, were circumstances
that promised to have weight with the
Holy Office, and to procure Vivaldi a
speedy release; but yet more than these,
were the high connections which the
Count di Maro, the friend of the
Marchese, had in the church of Rome.</P>
<P>The applications, however, which were
made to the inquisitors, were not so soon
replied to as the wishes of the Marchese
had expected, and he had been above a
<PB N="368" REF="369"/>
fortnight in that city, before he was even
permitted to visit his son. In this inter∣view,
affection predominated on both
sides over all remembrance of the past.
The condition of Vivaldi, his saded ap∣pearance,
to which the wounds he had
received at Celano, and from which he was
scarcely recovered, had contributed; and
his situation in a melancholy and terrible
prison, were circumstances that awakened
all the tenderness of the father; his errors
were forgiven, and the Marchese felt dis∣posed
to consent to all that might restore him
to happiness, could he but be restored to
liberty.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, when informed of his mother's
death, shed bitter tears of sorrow and re∣morse,
for having occasioned her so much
uneasiness. The unreasonableness of her
claims was forgotten, and her faults were
extenuated; happily, indeed, for his
peace, the extent of her criminal designs
he had never understood; and when he
<PB N="369" REF="370"/>
learned that her dying request had been
intended to promote his happiness, the
cruel consciousness of having interrupted
her's, occasioned him severe anguish, and
he was obliged to recollect her former
conduct towards Ellena at San Stefano,
before he could become reconciled to
himself.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<Q>“Your's in the ranks of death.”</Q>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL>
<P>NEAR three weeks had elapsed since
the Marchese's arrival at Rome, and not
any decisive answer was returned by the
Inquisition to his application, when he
and Vivaldi received at the same time a
summons to attend father Schedoni in his
dungeon. To meet the man who had
occasioned so much suffering to his fami∣ly,
was extremely painful to the Mar∣chese,
but he was not allowed to refuse
the interview; and at the hour appointed
he called at the chamber of Vivaldi;
and, followed by two officials, they passed
on together to that of Schedoni.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="372"/>
While they waited at the door of the
prison-room, till the numerous bars and
locks were unfastened, the agitation, which
Vivaldi had suffered, on receiving the
summons, returned with redoubled force,
now that he was about to behold, once
more, that wretched man, who had an∣nounced
himself to be the parent of El∣lena
di Rosalba. The Marchese suffered
emotions of a different nature, and with
his reluctance to see Schedoni, was min∣gled
a degree of curiosity as to the event,
which had occasioned this summons.</P>
<P>The door being thrown open, the offi∣cials
entered first, and the Marchese and
Vivaldi, on following, disvovered the
Confessor lying on a mattress. He did
not rise to receive them, but, as he lifted
his head, and bowed it in obeisance, his
countenance, upon which the little light
admitted through the triple grate of his
dungeon gleamed, seemed more than
usually ghastly; his eyes were hollow,
<PB N="372" REF="373"/>
and his shrunk features appeared as if
death had already touched them. Vi∣valdi,
on perceiving him, groaned and
averted his face; but, soon recovering a
command of himself, he approached the
mattress.</P>
<P>The Marchese, suppressing every ex∣pression
of resentment towards an enemy,
who was reduced to this deplorable con∣dition,
inquired what he had to commu∣nicate.</P>
<P>“Where is father Nicola?” said Sche∣doni
to an official, without attending to the
question: “I do not see him here. Is he
gone so soon, and without having heard
the purport of my summons? Let him be
called.”</P>
<P>The official spoke to a centinel, who
immediately left the chamber.</P>
<P>“Who are these that surround me?”
said Schedoni. “Who is he that stands
at the foot of the bed?” While he spoke
he bent his eyes on Vivaldi, who rested
<PB N="373" REF="374"/>
in deep dejection there, and was lost in
thought, till, aroused by Schedoni's voice,
he replied,</P>
<P>“It is I, Vincentio di Vivaldi; I obey
your requisition, and inquire the purpose
of it?”</P>
<P>The Marchese repeated the demand.
Schedoni appeared to meditate; some∣times
he fixed his eyes upon Vivaldi, for
an instant, and when he withdrew them,
he seemed to sink into deeper thoughtful∣ness.
As he raised them once again, they
assumed a singular expression of wildness,
and then settling, as if on vacancy, a
sudden glare shot from them, while he
said—“Who is he, that glides there in
the dusk?”</P>
<P>His eyes were directed beyond Vival∣di,
who, on turning, perceived the monk,
father Nicola, passing behind him.</P>
<P>“I am here,” said Nicola: “what do
you require of me?”</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="375"/>
“That you will bear testimony to the
truth of what I shall declare,” replied
Schedoni.</P>
<P>Nicola, and an inquisitor who had ac∣companied
him, immediately arranged
themselves on one side of the bed, while
the Marchese stationed himself on the
other. Vivaldi remained at its foot.</P>
<P>Schedoni, after a pause, began: “That
which I have to make known relates to
the cabal formerly carried on by him, the
father Nicola, and myself, against the
peace of an innocent young woman,
whom, at my instigation, he has basely
traduced.”</P>
<P>At these words, Nicola attempted to
interrupt the Conseffor, but Vivaldi re∣strained
him.</P>
<P>“Ellena di Rosalba is known to you?”
continued Schedoni, addressing the Mar∣chese.</P>
<P>Vivaldi's countenance changed at this
abrupt mention of Ellena, but he re∣mained
silent.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="376"/>
“I have heard of her,” replied the
Marchese, coldly.</P>
<P>“And you have heard falsely of her,”
rejoined Schedoni. “Lift your eyes, my
lord Marchese, and say, do you not re∣collect
that face?” pointing to Nicola.</P>
<P>The Marchese regarded the monk at∣tentively,
“It is a face not easily to be
forgotten,” he replied; “I remember to
have seen it more than once.”</P>
<P>“Where have you seen him, my
Lord?”</P>
<P>“In my own palace, at Naples; and
you yourself introduced him to me
there.”</P>
<P>“I did,” replied Schedoni.</P>
<P>“Why, then, do you now accuse him
of falshood,” observed the Marchese,
“since you acknowledge yourself to
have been the instigator of his con∣duct?”</P>
<P>“O heavens!” said Vivaldi, “this
monk, then, this father Nicola, is, as I
<PB N="376" REF="377"/>
suspected, the slanderer of Ellena di
Ro∣salba!”</P>
<P>“Most, true,” rejoined Schedoni;
“and it is for the purpose of vindicate∣ing—”</P>
<P>“And you acknowledge yourself to be
the author of those infamous slanders!”
passionately interrupted Vivaldi;—“you,
who but lately declared yourself to be
her father!”</P>
<P>In the instant, that Vivaldi had uttered
this, he became sensible of his indiscre∣tion,
for till now he had avoided inform∣ing
the Marchese, that Ellena had been
declared the daughter of Schedoni. This
abrupt disclosure, and at such a moment,
he immediately, perceived might be fatal
to his hopes, and that the Marchese
would not consider the promise he had
given to his dying wife, however solemn,
as binding, under circumstances so pecu∣liar
and unforeseen as the present. The
astonishment of the Marchese, upon this
<PB N="377" REF="378"/>
discovery, cannot easily he imagined;
he looked at his son for an explanation of
what he had heard, and then with in∣crcased
detestation at the Confessor; but
Vivaldi was not in a state of mind to
give any explanation at this moment,
and he requested his father to suspend
even his conjectures till he could converse
with him alone.</P>
<P>The Marchese desisted for the present
from further inquiry, but it was obvious
that his opinion and his resolution, re∣speting
the marriage of Vivaldi, was al∣ready
formed.</P>
<P>“You, then, are the author of those
slanders!” repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Hear me!” cried Schedoni, in a
voice which the strength of his spirit
contending with the feebleness of his
condition, rendered hollow and terrible
—“Hear me!”</P>
<P>He stopped, unable to recover im∣mediately
from the effect of the exer∣tion
<PB N="378" REF="379"/>
he had made. At length, he re∣sumed,</P>
<P>“I have declared, and I continue to
declare, that Ellena di Rosalba, as she
has been named for the purpose, I, con∣jecture,
of concealing her from an un∣worthy
father, is my daughter!”</P>
<P>Vivaldi groaned in the excess of his
despair, but made no further attempt to
interrupt Schedoni. The Marchese was
not equally passive. “And was it to lis∣ten
to a vindication of your daughter,”
said he, “that have been summoned
hither? But let this Signora Rosalba, be
who she may, of what importance can it
be to me whether she is innocent or other∣wise.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, with the utmost difficulty,
forbore to express the feelings, which
this sentence excited. It appeared to re∣call
all the spirit of Schedoni. “She is
the daughter of a noble house,” said the
Confessor, haughtily, while he half raised
<PB N="379" REF="380"/>
himself from his mattress. “In me you
behold the last of the Counts di Bru∣no.”</P>
<P>The Marchese smiled contemptuously.</P>
<P>Schedoni proceeded; “I call upon
you, Nicola di Zampari, who have de∣clared
yourself, on a late occasion, so
strenuous for justice, I call upon you now
to do justice in this instance, and to ac∣knowledge,
before tnese witnesses, that
Ellena Rosalba is innocent of every cir∣cumstance
of misconduct, which you have
formerly related to the Marchese di Vi∣valid!”</P>
<P>“Villain! do you hesitate,” said Vi∣valdi
to Nicola, “to retract the cruel
slanders which you have thrown upon her
name, and which have been the means of
destroying her peace, perhaps fop ever?
Do you persist—”</P>
<P>The Marchese interrupted his son:—</P>
<P>“Let me put an end to the difficulty, by
concluding the interview; I perceive
that my presence has been required
<PB N="380" REF="381"/>
for a purpose that does not concern
me.”</P>
<P>Before the Confessor could reply, the
Marchese had turned from him to quit
the chamber; but the vehemence of Vi∣valdi's
distress prevailed with him to
pause, and thus allowed him to under∣stand
from Schedoni, that the justification,
of the innocent Ellena, though it had
been mentioned first, as being the object nearest
to his heart, was not the only one
that had urged him to require this meet∣ing.</P>
<P>“If you consent,” added Schedoni,
“to listen to the vindication of my child,
you shall afterwards perceive, Signor,
that I, fallen though I am, have still been
desirous of counteracting, as far as re∣mains
for me, the evil I have occasioned.
You shall acknowledge, that what I then
make known is of the utmost conse∣quence
to the repose of the Marchese di
Vivaldi, high in influence, and haughty
in prosperity as he now appears.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="382"/>
The latter part of this assurance threat∣ened
to overcome the effect of the first;
the pride of the Marchese swelled high;
he took some steps towards the door, but
then stopped, and, conjecturing that the
subject, to which Schedoni alluded, con∣cerned
the liberation of his son, he con∣sented
to attend to what Nicola should
disclose.</P>
<P>This monk, meanwhile, had been ba∣lancing
the necessity for acknowledging
himself a slanderer, against the possibi∣lity
of avoiding it; and it was the reso∣lute
manner of Vivaldi, who appeared
to have no doubt as to his guilt in this
instance, that made him apprehend the
consequence of persisting in falshood,
not either remorse of conscience, or the
appeal of Schedoni. He ackcnowledged
then, after considerable circumlocution,
in which he contrived to desend himself,
by throwing all the odium of the original
design upon the Confessor that he had
<PB N="382" REF="383"/>
been prevailed upon by his arts to impose
on the credulity of the Marchese, respect∣ing
the conduct of Ellena di Rosalba.
This avowal was made upon oath, and
Schedoni, by the questions he put to him,
was careful it should be so full and cir∣cumstantial
that even the most prejudiced
hearer must have been convinced of its
truth; while the most unfeeling must
have yielded for once to indignation
against the asperser, and pity of the
aspersed. Its effect upon the present au∣ditors
was various. The Marchese had
listened to the whole explanation with an
unmoved countenance, but with profound
attention. Vivaldi had remained in a
fixed attitude, with eyes bent on father
Nicola, in such eager and stern regard,
as seemed to search into his very soul;
and, when the monk concluded, a smile
of triumphant joy lighted up his features,
as he looked upon the Marchese, and
claimed acknowledgment of his con∣viction,
<PB N="383" REF="384"/>
that Ellena had been calumniated.
The cold glance, which the Marchese
returned, struck the impassioned and ge∣nerous
Vivaldi to the heart, who perceived
that he was not only totally indifferent as
to the injustice, which an innocent and
helpless young woman had suffered, but
fancied that he was unwilling to admit the
truth, which his judgment would no
longer allow him to reject.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, appeared almost
to writhe under the agony, which his mind
inflicted upon him, and it was only by
strong effort, that he sustained his spirit so
far as to go through with the interroga∣tions
he had judged it necessary to put
to Nicola. When the subject was finish∣ed,
he sunk back on his pillow, and, clos∣ing
his eyes, a hue so pallid, succeeded by
one so livid, overspread his features, that
Vivaldi for an instant believed he was dy∣ing;
and in this supposition he was not
singular for even an official was touched
<PB N="384" REF="385"/>
with the Confessor's condition, and had
advanced to assist him, when he unclosed
his eyes, and seemed to revive.</P>
<P>The Marchese, without muting any
comment upon the avowal of father Ni∣cola,
demanded, on its conclusion, the
disclosure, which Schedoni had asserted to
be intimately connected with his peace;
and the latter now inquired of a person∣near
him, whether a secretary bf the In∣quisition
was in the chamber, who he had
requested might attend, to take a formal
deposition of what he should declare.
He was answered, that such an one was
already in waiting. He then asked, what
other persons were in the room, adding,
that he should require inquisitorial wit∣nesses
to his deposition; and was answer∣ed,
that an inquisitor and two officials
were present, and that their evidence was
more than sufficient for his purpose.</P>
<P>A lamp was then called for by the se∣cretary;
but, as that could not imme∣diately
<PB N="385" REF="386"/>
be procured, the torch of one of
the centinels, who watched in the dark
avenue without, was brought in its stead,
and this discovered to Schedoni the va∣rious
figures assembled in his dusky cham∣ber,
and to them the emaciated form and
ghastly visage of the Confessor. As Vi∣valdi
now beheld him by the stronger
light of the torch, he again fancied that
death was in his aspect.</P>
<P>Every person was now ready for the
declaration of Schedoni; but he himself
seemed not fully prepared. He remained
for some moments reclining on his pillow
in silence, with his eyes shut, while the
changes in his features indicated the strong
emotion of his mind. Then, as if by a
violent effort, he half raised himself, and
made an ample confession of the arts he
had practised against Vivaldi. He de∣clared
himself to be the anonymous ac∣cuser,
who had caused him to be arrested
by the Holy Office, and that the charge
<PB N="386" REF="387"/>
of heresy, which he had brought against
him, was false and malicious.</P>
<P>At the moment when Vivaldi received
this confirmation of his suspicions, as to
the identity of his accuser, he discovered
more fully that the charge was not what
had been stated to him at the chapel of
San Sebastian, in which Ellena was im∣plicated;
and he demanded an explana∣tion
of this circumstance. Schedoni ac∣knowledged,
that the persons, who had
there arrested him, were not officers of the
Inquisition, and that the instrument of
arrest, containing the charge of elope∣ment
with a nun, was forged by himself,
for the purpose of empowering the ruf∣fians
to carry off Ellena, without opposi∣tion
from the inhabitants of the convent,
in which the was then lodged.</P>
<P>To Vivaldi's inquiry, why it had been
thought necessary to employ stratagem in
the removal of Ellena, since, if Schedoni
had only claimed her for his daughter, he
<PB N="387" REF="388"/>
might have removed her without any, the
Confessor replied, that he was then igno∣rant
of the relationship which existed be∣tween
them. Bu to the further inquiries,
with what design, and whither Ellena
had been removed, and the means by
which he had discovered her to be his
daughter, Schedoni was silent; and he
sunk back, overwhelmed by the recollect∣tions
they awakened.</P>
<P>The depositions of Schedoni having
been taken down by the secretary, were
formally signed by the inquisitor and the
officials present; and Vivaldi thus saw his
innocence vindicated by the very man who
had thrown him among the perils of the
Inquisition. But the near prospect of
release now before him failed to affect
him with joy, while he understood that
Ellena was the daughter of Schedoni, the
child of a murderer, whom he himself
had been in some degree instrumental in
bringing to a dreadful and ignominious
<PB N="388" REF="389"/>
death. Still, however, willing to hope,
that Schedoni had not spoken the truth
concerning his relationship to Ellena, he
claimed, in consideration of the affection
he had so long cherished for her, a full
explanation of the circumstances connect∣ed
with the discovery of her family.</P>
<P>At this public avowal of his attach∣ment,
a haughty impatience appeared on
the countenance of the Marchese, who
forbade him to make further inquiry on
the subject, and was immediately retiring
from the chamber.</P>
<P>“My presence is no longer necessary,”
he added: “the prisoner has concluded
the only detail which I could be interested
to hear from him; and, in consideration of
the confession he has made as to the in∣nocence
of my son, I pardon him the suf∣fering,
which his false charge has occa∣sioned
to me and my family. The paper
containing his depostions is given to your
responsibility, holy father,” addressing
<PB N="389" REF="390"/>
the inquisitor; “and you are required
to lay it upon the table of the Holy Of∣fice,
that the innocence of Vincentio di
Vivaldi may appear, and that he may be
released from these prisons without further
delay. But first, I demand a copy of
those declarations, and that the copy also
shall be signed by the present witnesses.”</P>
<P>The secretary was now bidden to copy
them, and, while the Marchese waited to
receive the paper, (for he would not leave
the chamber till he had secured it) Vi∣valdi
was urging his claim for an expla∣nation
respecting the family of Ellena,
with unconquerable perseverance. Sche∣doni,
no longer permitted to eyade the
inquiry, could not, however, give a cir∣cumstantial
explanation, without partly
disclosing, also, the fatal designs which
had been meditated by him and the late
Marchesa di Vivaldi, of whose death he
was ignorant; he related, therefore, lit∣tle
more respecting Ellens than that a
<PB N="390" REF="391"/>
portrait, which she wore as being her fa∣ther's,
had first led to the discovery of her
family.</P>
<P>While the Confessor had been giving
this brief explanation, Nicola, who was
somewhat withdrawn from the circle, stood
gazing at him with the malignity of a
demon. His glowing eyes just appeared
under the edge of his cowl, while, rolled
up in his dark drapery, the lower features
of his face were muffled; but the inter∣mediate
part of his countenance, recei∣ving
the full glare of the torch, displayed
all its speaking and terrific lines. Vivaldi,
as his eye glanced upon him, saw again
the very monk of Paluzzi, and he thought
he beheld also a man capable of the very
crimes of which he had accused Schedoni.
At this instant, he remembered the dread∣ful
garment that had been discovered in a
dungeon of the fortress; and, yet more,
he remembered the extraordinary circum∣stances
attending the death of Bianchi,
<PB N="391" REF="392"/>
together with the immediate knowledge
which the monk had displayed of that
event. Vivaldi's suspicions respecting the
cause of her death being thus revived, he
determined to obtain, if possible, either a re∣lief
from, or a confirmation of them; and
he solemnly called upon Schedoni, who,
ready condemned to die, had no longer
any thing to fear from a disclosure of the
truth, whatever it might be, to declare
all that he knew on the subject. As he
did so, he looked at Nicola, to observe
the effect of this demand, whose counte∣nance
was, however, so much shrouded,
that little of its expression could be seen;
but Vivaldi remarked, that, while he had
spoken, the monk drew his garment closer
over the lower part of his face, and that
he had immediately turned his eyes from
him upon the Confessor.</P>
<P>With most solemn protestations, Sche∣doni
declared himself to be both innocent
and ignorant of the cause of Bianchi's
death.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="393"/>
Vivaldi then demanded by what means
his agent, Nicola, had obtained such im∣mediate
information, as the warning he
had delivered at Paluzzi proved him to
have, of an event, in which it appeared
that he could be so little interested; and
why that warning had been given.</P>
<P>Nicola did not attempt to anticipate the
reply of Schedoni, who, after a momen∣tary
silence, said, “That warning, young
man, was given to deter you from visit∣ing
Altieri, as was every circumstance of
advice or intelligence, which you received
beneath the arch of Paluzzi.”</P>
<P>“Father,” replied Vivaldi, “you have
never loved, or you would have spared your∣self
the practice of artifices so ineffectual
to mislead or to conquer a lover. Did you
believe that an anonymous adviser could
have more influence with me than my
affection, or that I could could be terri∣fied
by such stratagems into a renuncia∣tion
of its object?”</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="394"/>
“I believed,” rejoined the Confessor,
“that the disinterested advice of a stran∣ger
might have some weight with you;
but I trusted more to the impression of
awe, which the conduct and seeming fore-knowledge
of that stranger were adapted
to inspire in a mind like your's; and I
thus endeavoured to avail myself of your
prevailing weakness.”</P>
<P>“And, what do you term my prevail∣ing
weakness,” said Vivaldi, blushing.</P>
<P>A susceptibility which renders you
especially liable to superstition,” replied
Schedoni.</P>
<P>“What! does a monk, call superstition
a weakness!” rejoined Vivaldi. “But
grant he does, on what occasion have I
betrayed such weakness?”</P>
<P>“Have you forgotten a conversation
which It once held with you on invisible
spirits?” said Schedoni.</P>
<P>As he asked this, Vivaldi was struck
with the tone of his voice; he thought it
<PB N="394" REF="395"/>
was different from what he had remem∣bered
ever to have heard from him; and
he looked at Schedoni more intently, that
he might be certain it was he who had
spoken. The Confessor's eyes were fixed
upon him, and he repeated slowly in the
same tone, “Have you forgotten?”</P>
<P>“I have not forgotten the conversation
to which you allude,” replied Vivaldi,
“and I do not recollect that I then dis∣closed
any opinion that may justify your
assertion.”</P>
<P>“The opinions you avowed were ra∣tional,”
said Schedoni, “but the ardour
of your imagination was apparent, and
what ardent imagination ever was con∣tented
to trust to plain reasoning, or to
the evidence of the senses? It may not
willingly confine itself to the dull truths
of this earth, but, eager to expand its
faculties, to fill its capacity, and to expe∣rience
its own peculiar delights, soars
after new wonders into a world of its
own!”</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="396"/>
Vivaldi blushed at this reproof, now
conscious of its justness; and was surprised
that Schedoni should so well have under∣stood
the nature of his mind, while he
himself, with whom conjecture had never
assumed the stability of opinion, on the
subject to which the Confessor alluded,
had been ignorant even of its propensi∣ties.</P>
<P>“I acknowledge the truth of your re∣mark,”
said Vivaldi, “as far as it con∣cerns
myself. I have, however, inquiries
to make on a point less abstracted, and
towards explaining which the evidence
of my senses themselves have done little.
To whom belonged the bloody garments
I found in the dungeon of Paluzzi, and
what became of the person to whom they
had pertained.?”</P>
<P>Consternation appeared for an instant
on the features of Schedoni. “What, gar∣ments?”
said he.</P>
<P>“They appeared to be those of a per∣son
who had died by violence,” replied
<PB N="396" REF="397"/>
valdi, “and they were discovered in a
place frequented by your avowed agent,
Nicola, the monk.”</P>
<P>As he concluded the sentence, Vivaldi
looked at Nicola, upon whom the atten∣tion
of every person present was now di∣rected.</P>
<P>“They were my own,” said this
monk.</P>
<P>“Your own! and in that condition!”
exclaimed Vivaldi. “They were covered
with gore!”</P>
<P>“They were my own,” repeated Ni∣cola.
“For their condition, I have to
thank you,—the wound your pistol gave
me occasioned it.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi was astonished by this apparent
subterfuge. “I had no pistol,” he re∣joined,
“my sword was my only wea∣pon!”</P>
<P>“Pause a moment,” said the monk.</P>
<P>“I repeat that I had no fire-arms,”
replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="398"/>
“I appeal to father Schedoni,” rejoned
Nicola, “whether I was not wounded by
a pistol shot.”</P>
<P>“To me you have no longer any right
of appeal,” said Schedoni. “Why should
I save you from suspicions, that may bring
you to a state like this, to which you have
reduced me!”</P>
<P>“Your crimes have reduced you to it,”
replied Nicola, “I have only done my
duty, and that which another person
could have effected without my aid—the
priest to whom Spalatro made his last
confession.”</P>
<P>“It is, however, a duty of such a
kind,” observed Vivaldi, “as I would not
willingly have upon my conscience. You
have betrayed the life of your former
friend, and have compelled me to assist in
the destruction of a fellow being.”</P>
<P>“You, like me, have assisted to de∣stroy
a destroyer,” replied the monk.
“He has taken life, and deserves, there∣fore,
<PB N="398" REF="399"/>
to lose it. If, however, it will af∣ford
you consolation to know that you
have not materially assisted in his destruc∣tion,
I will hereafter give you proof for
this assurance. There were other means
of shewing that Schedoni was the Count
di Bruno, than the testimony of Ansaldo,
though I was ignorant of them when I
bade you summon the penitentiary.”</P>
<P>“If you had sooner avowed this,” said
Vivaldi, the assertion would have been
more plausible. Now, I can only under∣stand
that it is designed to win my silence,
and prevent my retorting upon you your
own maxim—that he who has taken the
life of another, deserves to lose his own.—
To whom did those bloody garments be∣long?”.</P>
<P>“To myself, I repeat,” replied Ni∣cola,
“Shedoni can bear testimony that
I received at Paluzzi a pistol wound.”</P>
<P>“Impossible,” said Vivaldi, “I was
armed only with my sword!”</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="400"/>
“You had a companion,” observed the
monk, “had hot he fire-arms?”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after a momentary considera∣tion,
recollected that Paulo had pistols,
and that he had fired one beneath the
arch of Paluzzi; on the first alarm occa∣sioned
by the stranger's Voice. He im∣mediately
acknowledged the recollection,
“But I heard no groan, no symptom of
distress!” he added. “Besides, the gar∣ments
were at a considerable distance from
the spot where the pistol was fired! How
could a person, so severely wounded as
those garments indicated, have silently
withdrawn to a remote dungeon, or, hav∣ing
done so, is it probable he would have
thrown aside his dress!”</P>
<P>“All that is nevertheless true,” re∣plied
Nicola. “My resolution enabled me
to stifle the expression of my anguish; I
withdrew; to the interior of the ruin, to
escape from you, but you pursued me even
to the dungeon, where I threw off my discoloured
<PB N="400" REF="401"/>
coloured vestments, in which I dared not
return to my convent, and departed by a
way which all your ingenuity failed to dis∣cover.
The people who were already in the
fort, for the purpose of assisting to confine
you and your servant during the night on
which Signora Rosalba was taken from
Altieri, procured me another habit, and
relief for my wound. But, though I was
unseen by you during the night, I was
not entirely unheard, for my groans
reached you more than once from an ad∣joining
chamber, and my companions
were entertained with the alarm which
your servant testified.—Are you now con∣vinced?”</P>
<P>The groans were clearly remembered
by Vivaldi, and many other circumstances
of Nicola's narration accorded so well
with others, which he recollected to have
occurred on the night alluded to, that he
had no longer a doubt of its veracity.
The suddenness of Bianchi's death, how∣ever,
<PB N="401" REF="402"/>
still occasioned him sufpicions as to
its cause; yet Schedoni had declared not
only that he was innocent, but ignorant
of this, cause, which it appeared from his
unwillingness to give testimony in favour
of his agent, he would not have affirmed,
had he been conscious that the monk was
in any degree guilty in this instance. That
Nicola could, have no inducement for at∣tempting
the life of Bianchi other than a
reward offered him by Schedoni, was
clear; and Vivaldi;, after more fully con∣sidering
these circumstances, became con∣vinced
that her death was in consequence
of some incident of natural decay.</P>
<P>While this conversation was passing,
the Marchese, impatient to put a conclu∣sion
to it, and to leave the chamber, re∣peatedly
urged the secretary to dispatch;
and, while he now earnestly renewed his
request, another voice answered for the
secretary, that he had nearly concluded.
Vivaldi thought that he had heard the
<PB N="402" REF="403"/>
voice on some former occasion, and on
turning his eyes upon the person who had
spoken, discovered the stranger to be the
same who had first visited him in prison.
Perceiving by his dress, that he was an
officer, of the Inquisition; Vivaldi now
understood too well the purport of his
former visit, and that he had come with a
design to betray him by affected sympathy
into a confession of some heretical opinions.
Similar instances of treachery Vivaldi had
heard were frequently practised upon ac∣cused
persons, but he had never fully be∣lieved
such cruelty possible till now, that
it had been attempted towards himself.</P>
<P>The visit of this person bringing to his
recollection the subsequent one he had
received from Nicola, Vivaldi inquired
whether the centinels had really admitted
him to his cell, or he had entered it by
other means; a question to which the
monk was silent, but the smile on his fea∣tures,
if so strange an expression deserved
<PB N="403" REF="404"/>
to be called a smile, seemed to reply, “Do
you believe that I, a Servant of the In∣quisition,
will betray its secrets?”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, however, urged the inquiry,
for he wished to know whether the guard,
who appeared to be faithful to their office,
had escaped the punishment that was
threatened.</P>
<P>“They were honest,” replied Nicola,
“seek no further.”</P>
<P>“Are the tribunal convinced of their
integrity?”</P>
<P>Nicola smiled again in derision, and
replied, “They never doubted it.”</P>
<P>“How!” said Vivaldi, “Why were
these men put under arrest, if their faith∣fulness
was not even suspected?”</P>
<P>“Be satisfied with the knowledge,
which experience has given you of the
secrets of the Inquisition,” replied Nicola
solemnly, “seek to know no more!”</P>
<P>“It has terrible secrets!” said Schedoni,
who had been long silent. “Know,
<PB N="404" REF="405"/>
young man, that almost every cell of every
prisoner has a concealed entrance, by
which the ministers of death may pass un∣noticed
to their victims. This Nicola is
now one of those dreadful summoners, and
is acquainted with all the secret avenues,
that lead to murder.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi shrunk from Nicola in horror,
and Schedoni paused; but while he had
spoken, Vivaldi had again noticed the
extraordinary change in his voice, and
shuddered at its sound no less than at the
information it had given. Nicola was
silent; but his terrible eyes were fixed in
vengeance on Schedoni.</P>
<P>“His office has been short,” resumed
the Confessor, turning his heavy eyes
upon Nicola, “and his task is almost
done!” As he pronounced the last words
his voice faltered, but they were heard by,
the monk, who drawing nearer to the bed,
demanded an explanation of them. A
ghastly smile triumphed in the features of
<PB N="405" REF="406"/>
Schedoni; “Fear not but that an expla∣nation
will come full soon,” said he.</P>
<P>Nicola, fixed himself before the Con∣fessor,
and bent his brows upon him as if
he would have searched into his very soul.
When Vivaldi again looked at Schedoni,
he was shocked on observing the sudden
alteration in his countenance, yet still a
faint smile of triumph lingered there. But,
while Vivaldi gazed, the features suddenly
became agitated; in the next instant his
whole frame was convulsed, and, heavy
groans laboured from his breast. Schedoni
was now evidently dying.</P>
<P>The horror of Vivaldi, and of the Mar∣chese,
who endeavoured to leave the
chamber, was equalled only by the gene∣ral
confusion that reigned there; every
person present seemed to feel at least a
momentary compassion, except Nicola,
who stood unmoved beside Schedoni, and
looked stedfastly upon his pangs, while a
smile of derision marked his countenance.
As Vivaldi observed, with detestation,
<PB N="406" REF="407"/>
this expression, a flight spasm darted over
Nicola's face, and his muscles also seemed
to labour with sudden contraction; but
the affection was transient, and vanished
as abruptly as it had appeared. The monk,
however, turned from the miserable spec∣tacle
before him, and as he turned he
caught involuntarily at the arm of a person
near him, and leaned on his shoulder for
support. His manner appeared to betray
that he had not been permitted to triumph
in the sufferings of his enemy, without
participating at least in their horror.</P>
<P>Schedoni's struggles now began to
abate, and in a short time he lay motion∣less.
When he unclosed his eyes, death
was in them. He was yet nearly insen∣sible;
but presently a faint gleam of re∣collection
shot from them, and gradually
lighting them up, the character of his
soul appeared there; the expression was
indeed feeble, but it was true. He moved
his lips as if he would have spoken, and
looked languidly round the chamber,
<PB N="407" REF="408"/>
seemingly in search of some person. At
length, he uttered a found, but he had not
yet sufficient command of his muscles, to
modulate that sound into a word, till by
repeated efforts the name of Nicola be∣came
intelligible. At the call, the monk
raised his head from the shoulder of the
person on whom he had reelined, and
turning round, Schedoni, as was evident
from, the sudden change of expression in
his countenance, discovered him; his eyes,
as they settled on Nicola seemed to recol∣lect
all their wonted fire, and the malig∣nant
triumph, lately so prevalent in his
physiognomy, again appeared as in the
next moment, he pointed to him. His
glance seemed suddenly impowered with
the destructive fascination attributed to
that of the basilisk, for while it now met
Nicola's, that monk seemed as if trans∣fixed
to the spot, and unable to withdraw
his eyes from the glare of Schedoni's; in
their expression he read the dreadful sen∣tence
of his fate, the triumph of revenge
<PB N="408" REF="409"/>
and cunning. Struck with this terrible con∣viction
a pallid hue overspread his face; at
the same time an involuntary motion con∣vulsed
his features, cold trembling seized
upon his frame, and, uttering a deep groan,
he fell back, and was caught in the arms
of the people near him. At the instant of
his fall, Schedoni uttered a found, so
strange and horrible, so convulsed, yet so
loud, so exulting, yet so unlike any hu∣man
voice, that every person in the cham∣ber,
except those who were assisting
Nicola, struck with irresistible terror, en∣deavoured
to make their way out of it.
This, however, was impracticable, for
the door was fastened, until a physician,
who had been sent for, should arrive, and
some investigation could be made into this
mysterious affair. The consternation of
the Marchese and of Vivaldi, compelled
to witness this scene of horror, cannot
easily be imagined.</P>
<P>Schedoni, having uttered that demo∣niacal
found of exultation, was not per∣mitted
<PB N="409" REF="410"/>
to repeat it, for the pangs he had
lately suffered returned upon him, and
he was again in strong convulsions, when
the physician entered the chamber. The
moment he beheld Schedoni, he declared
him to be poisoned; and he pronounced
a similar opinion on father Nicola; affirm∣ing,
also, that the drug, as appeared from
the violence of the effect, was of too subtle
and inveterate a nature to allow of anti∣dote.
He was, however, willing to adm∣inister
the medicine usual in such
cases.</P>
<P>While he was giving orders to an at∣tendant,
with respect to this, the violence
of Schedoni's convulsions once more re∣laxed;
but Nicola appeared in the last
extremity. His sufferings were incessant,
his senses never for a moment returned,
and he expired, before the medicine,
which had been sent for, could be brought.
When it came, however, it was admini∣stered
with some success to Schedoni, who
<PB N="410" REF="411"/>
recovered not only his recollection, but
his voice; and the first word he uttered
was, as formerly, the name of Nicola.</P>
<P>“Does he live?” added the Confessor
with the utmost difficulty, and after a long
pause. The persons around him were
silent, but the truth, which this silence
indicated, seemed to revive him.</P>
<P>The inquistor, who had attended, per∣ceiving
that Schedoni had recovered the
use of his intellects, now judged it pru∣dent
to ask some questions relative to his
present condition, and to the cause of
Nicola's death.</P>
<P>“Poison,” replied Schedoni readily.</P>
<P>“By whom administered?” said the
inquisitor, “consider that, while you an∣swer,
you are on your death-bed.”</P>
<P>“I have no wish to conceal the truth,”
rejoined Schedoni, “nor the satisfaction”
—he was obliged to pause, but presently
added, “I have destroyed him, who
would have destroyed me, and—and I
have escaped an ignominious death.”</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="412"/>
He paused again; it was with difficulty
that he had said thus much, and he was now
overcome by the exertion he had made.
The secretary, who had not been permitted
to leave the chamber, was ordered to note
Schedoni's words.</P>
<P>“You avow then,” continued the in∣quisitor,
“that the poison was admini∣stered,
both in the case of father Nicola
and in your own, by yourself?”</P>
<P>Schedoni could not immediately reply;
but when he did, he said, “I avow it.”</P>
<P>He was asked by what means he had
contrived to procure the poison, and was
bidden to name his accomplice.</P>
<P>“I had no accomplice,” replied Sche∣doni.</P>
<P>“How did you procure the poison, then?”</P>
<P>Schedoni, slowly and with difficulty,
replied, “It was concealed in my vest.”</P>
<P>“Consider that you are dying,” said
the inquisitor, “and confess the truth.
<PB N="412" REF="413"/>
We cannot believe what you have last
asserted. It is improbable that you should
have had an opportunity of providing
yourself with poison after your arrest, and
equally improbable that you should have
thought such provision necessary before
that period. Confess who is your ac∣complice.”</P>
<P>This accusation of falshood recalled
the spirit of Schedoni, which, contending
with, and conquering, for a moment, cor∣poreal
suffering, he said in a firmer tone,
“It was the poison, in which I dip my
poniard, the better to defend me.”</P>
<P>The inquisitor smiled in contempt of
this explanation, and Schedoni, observing
him, desired a particular part of his vest
might be examined, where would be
sound some remains of the drug concealed
as he had affirmed. He was indulged in
his request, and the poison was discovered
within a broad hem of his garment.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="414"/>
Still it was inconceivable how he had
contrived to administer it to Nicola, who,
though he had been for some time alone
with him on this day, would scarcely have
so far confided in an enemy, as to have
accepted any sceming sustenance that
might have been offered by him. The
inquisitor, still anxious to discover an
accomplice, asked Schedoni who had
assisted to administer the drug to Nicola,
but the Confessor was no longer in a
condition to reply. Life was now sink∣ing
apace; the gleam of spirit and of
character that had returned to his eyes,
was departed, and left them haggard and
fixed; and presently a livid corse was all
that remained of the once terrible Sche∣doni!</P>
<P>While this awful event had been ac∣complishing,
the Marchese, suffering
under the utmost perturbation, had
withdrawn to the distant grate of the
dungeon, where he conversed with an
<PB N="414" REF="415"/>
official as to what might be the probable
consequence of his present situation to
himself; but Vivaldi, in an agony of
horror, had been calling incessantly for
the medicine, which might possibly afford
some relief to the anguish he witnessed;
and when it was brought, he had assisted to
support the suffers.</P>
<P>At length, now that the worst was
over, and when the several witnesses had
signed to the last avowal of Schedoni,
every person in the chamber was suffered
to depart; and Vivaldi was re-conducted
to his prison, accompanied by the Mar∣chese,
where he was to remain till the
decision of the holy office respecting his
innocence, as asserted by the deposition of
Schedoni should be known. He was
too much affected by the late scene to
give the Marchese any explanation at
present, respecting the family of Ellena
di Rosalba, and the Marchese, having re∣mained
for some time with his son, with∣drew
to the residence of his friend.</P>

<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL>
<P>In consequence of the dying consession of
Schedoni, an order was sent from the
holy office for the release of Vivaldi, with∣in
a few days after the death of the Confessor;
and the Marchese conducted his
son from the prisons of the Inquisition to
the mansion of his friend the Count di
Maro, with whom he had resided since
his arrival at Rome.</P>
<P>While they were receiving the ceremo∣nious
congratulations of the Count, and
of some nobles assembled to welcome the
emancipated prisoner, a loud voice was
heard from the anti-chamber exclaiming,
“Let me pass! It is my masler, let me
<PB N="416" REF="417"/>
pass! May all those who attempt to stop
me, be sent to the Inquisition themselves!”</P>
<P>In the next instant Paulo burst into the
saloon, followed by a group of lacqueys,
who, however, paused at the door, fear∣ful
of the displeasure of their lord, yet
scarcely able to stisle a laugh; while Paulo,
springing forward, had nearly overset
some of the company, who happened at
that moment to be bowing with pro∣found
joy to Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“It is my master! it is my dear master!”
cried Paulo, and, sending off a nobleman
with each elbow, as he made his way be∣tween
them, he hugged Vivaldi in his
arms, repeating, “O, my matter! my
matter!” till a passion of joy and affection
overcame his voice, and he fell at his
master's feet and wept.</P>
<P>This was a moment of finer joy to
Vivaldi, than he had known since his
meeting with his father, and he was too
much interested by his faithful servant, to
<PB N="417" REF="418"/>
have leisure to apologize to the astonished
company for his rudeness. While the
lacqueys were repairing the mischief Paulo
had occasioned, were picking up the rol∣ling
snuff-boxes he had jerked, away in
his passage, and wiping the snuff from the
soiled clothes, Vivaldi was participating in
all the delight, and returning all the affect∣tion
of his servant, and was so wholly occu∣pied
by these pleasurable feelings as scarce∣ly
to be sensible that any persons besides
themselves were in the room. The Mar∣chese,
meanwhile was making a thousand
apologies for the disasters Paulo had occa∣sioned;
was alternately calling upon him
to recollect in whose presence he was,
and to quit the apartment immediately;
explaining to the company that he had
not seen Vivaldi since they were together
in the Inquisition, and remarking pro∣foundly,
that he was much attached to
his master. But Paulo, insensible to the
<PB N="418" REF="419"/>
repeated commands of the Marchese, and
to the endeavours of Vivaldi to raise him,
was still pouring forth his whole heart
at his master's feet. “Ah! my Signor,”
said he, “if you could but know how
miserable I was when I got out of the
Inquisition!”—</P>
<P>“He raves!” observed the Count to
the Marchese, “you perceive that joy has
rendered him delirious!”</P>
<P>“How I wandered about the walls
half the night, and what it cost me to
leave them! But when I lost fight of
them, Signor, O! San Dominico! I
thought my heart would have broke. I
tad a great mind to have gone back again
and given myself up; and, perhaps, I
should too, if it had not been for my
friend, the centinel, who escaped with
me, and I would not do him an injury,
poor fellow! for he meant nothing but
kindness when he let me out. And sure
<PB N="419" REF="420"/>
enough, as it has proved, it was all for
the best, for now I am here, too, Signor,
as well as you; and can tell you all I felt
when I believed I should never see you
again.”</P>
<P>The contrast of his present joy to
his remembered grief again brought
tears into Paulo's eyes; he smiled and
wept, and sobbed and laughed with
such rapid transition, that Vivaldi began
to be alarmed for him; when, suddenly
becoming calm, he looked up in his
master's face and said gravely, but with
eagerness, “Pray Signor, was not the
roof of your little prison peaked, and was
there not a little turret stuck up at one
corner of it? and was there not a battle∣ment
round the turret? and was there
not”—Vivaldi, after regarding him for
a moment, replied smilingly, “Why
truly, my good Paulo, my dungeon was
so far from, the roof, that I never had an
opportunity of observing it.”</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="421"/>
“That is very true, Signor,” replied
Paulo, “very true indeed; but I did not
happen to think of that. I am certain,
though, it was as I say, and I was sure of
it at the time. O Signor! I thought that
roof would have broke my heart, O how
I did look at it! and now to think that I
am here, with my dear master once
again!”</P>
<P>As Paulo concluded, his tears and sobs re∣turned
with more violence than before; and
Vivaldi, who could not perceive any neces∣sery
connection between this mention of the
roof of his late prison, and the joy his ser∣vant
expressed on seeing him again, began to
fear that his senses were bewildered, and
desired an explanation of his words,
Paulo's account, rude and simple as it
was, soon discovered to him the relation
of these apparently heterogeneous circum∣stances
to each other; when Vivaldi,
overcome by this new instance of the
power of Paulo's affection, embraced him
<PB N="421" REF="422"/>
with his whole heart, and, compelling,
him to rise, presented him to the assembly
as his faithful friend, and chief deliverer.</P>
<P>The Marchese, affected by the scene he
had witnessed, and with the truth of
Vivaldi's words, condescended to give
Paulo a hearty shake by the hand, and to
thank him warmly for the bravery and
fidelity he had displayed in his master's
interest. “I never can fully reward your
attachment, added the Marchese, “but
what remains for me to do, shall be done.
From this moment I make you indepen∣dent,
and promise, in the presence of this
noble company, to give you a thousand
sequins, as some acknowledgement of
your services.”</P>
<P>Paulo did not express all the gratitude
for this gift which the Marchese expected.
He stammered, and bowed and blushed,
and at length burst into tears; and when
Vivaldi inquired what distressed him, he
replied, “Why, Signor, of what use are
<PB N="422" REF="423"/>
the thousand sequins to me, if I am to be
independent! what use if I am not to stay
with you?”</P>
<P>Vivaldi cordially allured Paulo, that
he should always remain with him, and
that he should consider it as his duty to
render his future life happy. “You shall
henceforth,” added Vivaldi, “be placed
at the head of my houshold; the manage∣ment
of my servants, and the whole con∣duct
of my domestic concerns shall be
committed to you, as a proof of my entire
confidence in your integrity and attach∣ment;
and because this is a situation
which will allow you to be always near
me.”</P>
<P>“Thank you, my Signor,” replied
Paulo, in a voice rendered almost inarti∣culate
by his gratitude, “Thank you with
my whole heart! if I stay with you, that
is enough for me, I ask no more. But I
hope my Lord Marchese will not think
me ungrateful for refusing to accept of the
<PB N="423" REF="424"/>
thousand sequins he was so kind as to
offer me, if I would but be independent,
for I thank him as much as if I had re∣ceived
them, and a great deal more too.”</P>
<P>The Marchese, smiling at Paulo's mis∣take,
rejoined, “As I do not perceive, my
good friend, how your remaining with
your master can be a circumstance to
disqualify you from accepting a thousand
sequins, I command you, on pain of my
displeasure, to receive them; and when∣ever
you marry, I shall expect that you
will shew your obedience to me again, by
accepting another thousand from me with,
your wife, as her dower.”</P>
<P>“This is too much, Signor,” said
Paulo sobbing—“too much to be borne!”
and ran out of the saloon. But amidst
the murmur of applause which his con∣duct
drew from the noble spectators, for
Paulo's warm heart had subdued even the
coldness of their pride, a convulsive sound
from the anti-chamber betrayed the excess
<PB N="424" REF="425"/>
of emotion, which he had thus abruptly
withdrawn himself to conceal.</P>
<P>In a few hours, the Marchese and Vi∣valdi
took leave of their friends, and set
out for Naples, where they arrived, with∣out
any interruption, on the fourth day.
But it was a melancholy journey to Vi∣valdi,
notwithstanding the joy of his late
escape; for the Marchese, having intro∣duced
the mention of his attachment to
Ellena di Rosalba, informed him, that,
under the present unforeseen circum∣stances,
he could not consider his late
engagement to the Marchesa on that sub∣ject
as binding, and that Vivaldi must
relinquish. Ellena, if it should appear that
she really was the daughter of the late
Schedoni.</P>
<P>Immediately on his arrival at Naples,
however, Vivaldi, with a degree of im∣patience,
to which his utmost speed was
inadequate, and with a revived joy so
powerful as to overcome every fear, and
<PB N="425" REF="426"/>
every melancholy consideration, which
the late conversation with his father had
occasioned, hastened to the <HI>Santa della
Piéta.</HI></P>
<P>Ellena heard his voice from the grate,
inquiring for her of a nun, who was
in the parlour, and in the next instant
they beheld each other yet once again.</P>
<P>In such a meeting, after the long un∣certainty
and terror, which each had suf∣fered
for the fate of the other, and the
dangers and hardships they had really in∣curred,
joy was exalted almost to agony.
Ellena wept, and some minutes passed
before she could answer to Vivaldi's few
words of tender exclamation: it was long
ere she was tranquil enough to observe
the alteration, which severe confinement
had given to his appearance. The ani∣mated
expression of his countenance was
unchanged; yet, when the first glow of
joy had faded from it, and Ellena had
<PB N="426" REF="427"/>
leisure to observe its wanness, she under∣stood,
too certainly, that he had been a
prisoner in the Inquisition.</P>
<P>During this interview, he related, at
Ellena's request, the particulars of his
adventures, since he had been separated
from her in the chapel of San Sebastian;
but, when he came to that part of the
narration where it was necessary to men∣tion
Schedoni, he paused in unconquer∣able
embarrassment and a distress not
unmingled with horror. Vivaldi could
scarcely endure even to hint to Ellena any
part of the unjust conduct, which the
Confessor had practised towards him, yet
it was impossible to conclude his ac∣count,
without expressing much more than
hints; nor could he bear to afflict her
with a knowledge of the death of him
who he believed to be her parent, how∣ever
the dreadful circumstances of that
event might be concealed. His embar∣rassment
became obvious, and was still
increased by Ellena's inquiries.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="428"/>
At length, as an introduction to the
information it was necessary to give, and
to the fuller explanation he wished to
receive upon a subject, which, though it
was the one that pressed most anxiously
upon his mind, he had not yet dared to
mention, Vivaldi ventured to declare his
knowledge of her having discovered her
parent to be living. The satisfaction im∣mediately
apparent upon Ellena's coun∣tenance
heightened his distress, and his
reluctance to proceed; believing, as he
did, that the event he had to communicate
must change her gladness to grief.”</P>
<P>“Ellena, however, upon this mention of
a topic so interesting to them both, pro∣ceeded
to express the happiness she had re∣ceived
from the discovery of a parent, whose
virtues had even won her affection long be∣fore
she understood her own interest in them.
It was with some difficulty, that Vivaldi
could conceal his surprize at such an
avowal of prepossession; the manners of
<PB N="428" REF="429"/>
Schedoni, of whom he believed her to
speak, having certainly never been adapt∣ed
to inspire tenderness. But his surprize
soon changed its object, when Olivia,
who had heard that a stranger was at the
grate, entered the parlour, and was an∣nounced
as the mother of Ellena di Ro∣salba.</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi left the convent, a full
explanation, as to family, was given on
both sides, when he had the insinite joy
of learning, that Ellena was not the
daughter of Schedoni; and Olivia had
the satisfaction to know that she had no
future evil to apprehend from him who
had hitherto been her worst enemy. The
manner of his death, however, with all
the circumstances of his character, as un∣folded
by his late trial, Vivaldi was care∣ful
to conceal.</P>
<P>When Ellena had withdrawn from the
room, Vivaldi made a full acknowledg∣ment
to Olivia of his long attachment to
<PB N="429" REF="430"/>
her daughter, and supplicated for her
consent to their marriage. To this ap∣plication,
however, Olivia replied, that,
though she had long been no stranger to
their mutual affection, or to the several
circumstances which had both proved its
durability, and tried their fortitude, she
never could consent that her daughter
should become a member of any family,
whose principal was either insensible of
her value, or unwilling to acknowledge
it; and that in this instance it would be
necessary to Vivaldi's success, not only
that he, but that his father should be a
suitor; on which condition only, she al∣lowed
him to hope for her acquies∣cence.</P>
<P>Such a stipulation scarcely chilled the
hopes of Vivaldi, now that Ellena was
proved to be the daughter not of the
murderer Schedoni, but of a Count di
Bruno, who had been no less respectable
in character than, in rank; and he had
<PB N="430" REF="431"/>
little doubt that his father would consent
to fulfil the promise he had given to the
dying Marchesa.</P>
<P>In this belief he was not mistaken.
The Marchese, having attended to Vi∣valdi's
account of Ellena's family, pro∣mised,
that if it should appear there was
no second mistake on the subject, he
would not longer oppose the wishes of
his son.</P>
<P>The Marchese immediately caused a
private inquiry to be made as to the iden∣tity
of Olivia, the present Countess di
Bruno; and, though this was not pur∣sued
without difficulty, the physician, who
had assisted in the plan of her escape from
the cruelty of Ferando di Bruno, and
who was living, as well as Beatrice, who
clearly remembered the sister of her late
mistress, at length rendered Olivia's iden∣tity
unquestionable. Now, therefore, that
the Marchese's every doubt was removed,
he paid a visit to the <HI>Santa della Piéta,</HI>
<PB N="431" REF="432"/>
and solicited, in due form, Olivia's con∣sent
to the nuptials of Vivaldi with El∣lena;
which she granted him with an
entire satisfaction. In this interview, the
Marchese was so much fascinated by the
manners of the Countess, and pleased
with the delicacy and sweetness, which ap∣peared
in those of Ellena, that his con∣sent
was no longer a constrained one, and
he willingly relinquished the views of su∣perior
rank and fortune, which he had for∣merly
looked to for his son, for those of
virtue and permanent happiness that
were now unfolded to him.</P>
<P>On the twentieth of May, the day on
which Ellena completed her eighteenth
year, her nuptials with Vivaldi were so∣lemnized
in the church of the <HI>Santa Ma∣ria
della Piéta,</HI> in the presence of the
Marchese and of the Countess di Bruno.
As Ellena advanced through the church,
she recollected, when on a former occa∣sion
<PB N="432" REF="433"/>
she had met Vivaldi at the altar, and,
the scenes of San Sebastian rising to her
memory, the happy character of those,
which her present situation opposed to
them, drew tears of tender joy and gra∣titude
to her eyes. Then, irresolute, de∣solate,
surrounded by strangers, and en∣snared
by enemies, she had believed she
saw Vivaldi for the last time; now, sup∣ported
by the presence of a beloved pa∣rent,
and by the willing approbation of
the person, who had hitherto so strenu∣ously
opposed her, they were met to part
no more; and, as a recollection of the
moment when she had been carried from
the chapel glanced upon, her mind, that
moment when she had called upon him
for succour, supplicated even to hear his
voice once more, and when a blank
silence, which, as she believed, was that
of death, had succeeded; as the anguish
of that moment was now remembered,
<PB N="433" REF="434"/>
Ellena became more than ever sensible of
the happiness of the present.</P>
<P>Olivia, in thus relinquishing her daugh∣ter
so soon after she had found her, suf∣fered
some pain, but she was consoled by
the fair prospect of happiness, that open∣ed
to Ellena, arid cheered, by consider∣ing,
that, though she relinquished, she
should not lose her, since the vicinity
of Vivaldi's residence to <HI>La Piéta,</HI> would
permit a frequent intercourse with the
convent.</P>
<P>As a testimony of singular esteem,
Paulo was permitted to be present at the
marriage of his master, when, as perched
in a high gallery of the church, he looked
down upon the ceremony, and witnessed
the delight in Vivaldi's countenance, the
satisfaction in that of my “old Lord
Marchese,” the pensive happiness in the
Countess di Bruno's, and the tender com∣placency
of Ellena's, which her veil,
<PB N="434" REF="435"/>
partly undrawn, allowed him to observe,
he could scarcely refrain from expressing
the joy he felt, and shouting aloud, “<HI>O!
giorno felíce! O! giorno felíce!</HI>”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">O happy day! O happy day!</NOTE></P>

<P>The fête which, some time after the
nuptials, was given by the Marchese, in
celebration of them, was held at a de∣lightful
villa, belonging to Vivaldi, a few
miles distant from Naples, upon the bor∣der
of the gulf, and on the opposite shore
to that which had been the frequent abode
of the Marchesa. The beauty of its situ∣ation
and its interior elegance induced
Vivaldi and Ellena to select it as their
chief residence. It was, in truth, a scene
of fairy-land. The pleasure-grounds ex∣tended
<PB N="436" REF="437"/>
over a valley, which opened to the
bay, and the house stood at the entrance
of this valley, upon a gentle stope that
margined the water, and commanded
the whole extent of its luxuriant shores,
from the lofty cape of Miseno to the
bold mountains of the south, which,
stretching across the distance, appeared
to rise out of the sea, and divided the
gulf of Naples from that of Salerno.</P>
<P>The marble porticoes and arcades of the
villa were shadowed by groves of the beau∣tiful
magnolia flowering ash, cedrati, ca∣mellias,
and majestic palms; and the cool
and airy halls, opening on two opposite
sides to a colonade, admitted beyond the
rich soliage all the seas and shores of
Naples, from the west; and to the east,
views of the valley of the domain, with∣drawing
among winding hills wooded to
their summits, except where cliffs of va∣rious-coloured
granites, yellow, green,
<PB N="437" REF="438"/>
and purple, lifted their tall heads, and
threw gay gleams of light amidst the
umbrageous landscape.</P>
<P>The style of the gardens, where lawns
and groves, and woods varied the undu∣lating
surface, was, that of England, and
of the present day, rather than of Italy;
except “Where a long alley peeping
on the main,” exhibited such gigantic
loftiness of shade, and grandeur of per∣spective,
as characterize the Italian
taste.</P>
<P>On this jubilee, every avenue and
grove, and pavilion was richly illumi∣nated.
The villa itself, where each airy
hall and arcade was resplendent with
lights, and lavishly decorated with flow∣ers
and the most beautiful shrubs, whose
buds seemed to pour all Arabia's perfumes
upon the air, this villa resembled a fabric
called up by enchantment, rather than a
structure of human art.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="439"/>
The dresses of the higher rank of visi∣tors
were as splendid as the scenery, of
which Ellena was, in every respect, the
queen. But this entertainment was not
given to persons of distinction only, for
both Vivaldi and Ellena had wished that
all the tenants of the domain should par∣take
of it, and share the abundant hap∣piness
which themselves possessed; so that
the grounds, which were extensive enough
to accommodate each rank, were relin∣quished
to a general gaiety. Paulo, was,
on this occasion, a sort of master of the
revels; and, surrounded by a party of his
own particular associates, danced once
more, as he had so often wished, upon
the moon-light shore of Naples.</P>
<P>As Vivaldi and Ellena were palling the
spot, which Paulo had chosen for the scene
of his festivity, they paused to observe
his strange capers and extravagant gesticu∣lation,
as he mingled in the dance, while
every now-and-then he shouted forth,
<PB N="439" REF="440"/>
though half breathless with the heartiness
of the exercise, “<HI>O! giorno felíce! O!
giorno felíce!</HI>”</P>
<P>On perceiving Vivaldi, and the smiles
with which he and Ellena regarded him,
he quitted his sports, and advancing,
“Ah! my dear master,” said he, “do
you remember the night, when we were
travelling on the banks of the Celano,
before that diabolical accident happened
in the chapel of San Sebastian; don't
you remember how those people, who
were tripping it away so joyously, by
moonlight, reminded me of Naples and
the many merry dances I had footed on
the beach here?”</P>
<P>“I remember it well,” replied Vi∣valdi.</P>
<P>“Ah! Signor <HI>mio,</HI> you said at the
time, that you hoped we should soon be
here, and that then I should frisk it away
with as glad a heart as the best of them.
The first part of your hope, my dear
<PB N="440" REF="441"/>
master, you was out in, for, as it hap∣pened,
we had to go through purgatory
before we could reach paradise; but the
second part is come at last;—for here I
am, sure enough! dancing by moonlight,
in my own dear bay of Naples, with my
own dear master and mistress, in safety, and
as happy <HI>almost</HI> as myself; and with that
old mountain yonder, Vesuvius, which I,
forsooth! thought I was never to see
again, spouting up fire, just as it used
to do before we got ourselves put into the
Inquisition! O! who could have fore∣seen
all this! <HI>O! giorno felice! O!
giorno felíce!</HI>”</P>
<P>“I rejoice in your happiness, my good
Paulo,” said Vivaldi, “almost as much
as in my own; though I do not entirely
agree with you as to the comparative
proportion of each.”</P>
<P>“Paulo!” said Ellena, “I am in∣debted
to you beyond any ability to re∣pay;
<PB N="441" REF="442"/>
for to your intrepid affection your
master owes his present safety. I will not
attempt to thank you for your attach∣ment
to him; my care of your welfare shall
prove how well I know it; but I wish to
give to all your friends this acknowledg∣ment
of your worth, and of my sense of
it.”</P>
<P>Paulo bowed, and stammered, and
writhed and blushed, and was unable to
reply; till, at length, giving a sudden
and lofty spring from the ground, the
emotion which had nearly stifled him
burst forth in words, and “<HI>O! giorno
felíce! O! giorno felíce!</HI>” flew from
his
lips with the force of an electric shock.
They communicated his enthusiasm to
the whole company, the words passed
like lightning from one individual to ano∣ther,
till Vivaldi and Ellena withdrew
amidst a choral shout, and all the woods
and strands of Naples re-echoed with—
“<HI>O! giorno felíce! O! giorno felíce!</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="443"/>
“You see,” said Paulo, when they had
departed, and he came to himself again,
“You see how people get through their
misfortunes, if they have but a heart to
bear up against them, and do nothing
that can lie on their conscience after∣wards;
and how suddenly one comes to
be happy, just when one is beginning to
think one never is to be happy again!
Who would have guessed that my dear
master and I, when we were clapped up
in that diabolical place, the Inquisition,
should ever come out again into this
world! Who would have guessed when
we were taken before those old devils of
Inquisitors, sitting there all of a row in a
place under ground, hung with black,
and nothing but torches all around, and
faces grinning at us, that looked as black
as the gentry aforesaid; and when I was
not so much as suffered to open my mouth,
no! they would not let me open my mouth
to my master!—who, I say, would have
<PB N="443" REF="444"/>
guessed we should ever be let loose again!
who would have thought we should ever
know what it is to be happy! Yet here we
are all abroad once more! All at liberty!
And may run, if we will, straight forward,
from one end of the earth to the other,
and back again without being stopped!
May fly in the sea, or swim in the sky,
or tumble over head and heels into the
moon! For remember, my good friends,
we have no lead in our consciences to
keep us down!”</P>
<P>“You mean swim in the sea, and fly
in the sky, I suppose,” observed a grave
personage near him, “but as for tumbling
over head and heels into the moon! I
don't know what you mean by that!”</P>
<P>“Pshaw!” replied Paulo, “who can
stop, at such a time as this, to think
about what he means! I wish that all
those, who on this night are not merry
enough to speak before they think, may
ever after be grave enough to think before
<PB N="444" REF="445"/>
they speak! But you, none of you, no!
not one of you! I warrant, ever saw the
roof of a prison, when your master hap∣pened
to be below in the dungeon, nor
know what it is to be forced to run away,
and leave him behind to die by himself.
Poor souls! But no matter for that, you
can be tolerably happy, perhaps, notwith∣standing;
but as for guessing how happy
I am, or knowing any thing about the
matter.—O! it's quite beyond what
you can understand. <HI>O! giorno felice!
O! giorno felice!</HI>” repeated Paulo, as he
bounded forward to mingle in the dance,
and “<HI>O! giorno felice!</HI>” was again
shouted in chorus by his joyful compa∣nions.</P>
