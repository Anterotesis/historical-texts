<HEAD>A VIEW OF THE Several Interests of <HI>Europe,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Death of the Emperor of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> had it happen'd at any other time than this, had, perhaps, been an Event of as little Consequence to <HI>Europe,</HI> as any thing of that Nature could have been; and yet at this time, it comes attended with so many unusual Circumstances, that the Death of no Prince in Christendom could have the like.</P>
<P>The Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> is in it self a vast unwieldy Body, under perhaps as good an Oe∣conomy as a Body made up of so many Members can be, but at the same time that Oeconomy has not in the best manner been made Practicabl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: witness in particular, the fruitless endeavours of the Dyet of the Empire, to oblige the Re∣spective Members to furnish their Quota of Troops to the Army, or of Money to the Mili∣tary Chest of the Empire; of the Deficiency of which, we have had sad Experience in this pre∣sent War; when, had the Empire exerted it self in
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
due proportion, one part to the other, and ac∣cording to the decrees of the Dyet; the <HI>French</HI> Power had, long before now, sunk under the Superior Forces of the Confederates.</P>
<P>As the Empire has been thus, by its own Weight and Bulk, render'd unactive, so have the Emperors themselves, <HI>of late years especially;</HI> whether by the Embarrassment of their Affairs, the various and too great pressures of the War on every side, which they have now for near Thirty Years been oppressed with, or from meer Confusion of Councils, we will not deter∣mine; but that they have been so, is apparent. It is true, the Emperor <HI>Leopold,</HI> Father of the late <HI>Joseph,</HI> and also the late Emperor, had in sundry cases wonderful Successes; such as a Series of Victory against the <HI>Turks;</HI> and after, against the Elector of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> pushing the <HI>French</HI> out of <HI>Italy;</HI> the Conquest of <HI>Naples;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>But how did every War first Distress them? from which Distress they behooved to be always Rescued and Delivered, by the assistance of o∣thers; as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and Elector of <HI>Saxony;</HI> from the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Marl-borough;</HI> and the like. Twice we see the Emper∣or frighted from <HI>Vienna;</HI> once by the <HI>Turk,</HI> and once by the <HI>Bavarian:</HI> The <HI>Hungarians</HI> often Insulted him at the very Gates of his Capital City; and the <HI>Swede</HI> frightned him into a Re∣stitution of the Protestant Churches of <HI>Silesia,</HI> and sending Count <HI>Zober, as we may say,</HI> with a Halter about his Neck to submit to the Mercy of the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Had it been at any other time than this, if Five or Six Emperors had Dyed, it had made no alteration in the Publick Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> at all; an Instance of which we have in the Death of the Emperor <HI>Leopold,</HI> when there was no∣thing at all to do, but for his Son to step into the Imperial Throne; who was before, in a manner, Coadjutor, or Declar'd apparent Suc∣cessor, by being Chosen King of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>But now the Case is quite altred, and the Death of the Emperor seems to give a shock to all <HI>Europe.</HI> The Princes stand at Gaze and Look∣ing upon one another, as if saying to one ano∣ther, <HI>What will become of us now?</HI> All the con∣certed Measures, whether of War or Confede∣racy, are at a full stop; the Engagements between Princes, Nations, and States, are broken and dissolved by this Accident; and all the Mea∣sures, whether of War, Peace, or Confedera∣cy, will suffer some Change about it.</P>
<P>In order to come at a view of the several In∣terests of <HI>Europe,</HI> in this important Conjuncture, it may not be Unprofitable for us, to enquire how far the several Princes and States of the World are concern'd and affected in this sud∣den stroak, and what may probably be the re∣sult of their said Concern in the Process of this Summers Conduct. In the view of which, their several true Interests will appear, and so need but a very short summing up into Generals at the end.</P>
<P>To do this, it is necessary to lay down the present Circumstances of the Family of the De∣ceas'd, as Head of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and as Emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
As to his Family, we are to suppose him Dead without Children, that it without Sons, and his Titles, Honours, Kingdoms and Estates, descend directly to his Brother <HI>Charles,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> now proclaim'd King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Fighting for the Possession of it in <HI>Catalognia.</HI> By the Death of the Emperor, and as Head of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> this Prince (the Daugh∣ters not Inheriting) becomes King of <HI>Hun∣garia, Bohemia, Croatia, Dalmatia,</HI> and <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> Prince of <HI>Transilvania,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> Duke of <HI>Stiria, Carinthia, Silesia, Carniola,</HI> Mar∣quis of <HI>Moravia,</HI> Count <HI>de Tyrol;</HI> these are those we call the Hereditary Countries, not mention∣ing lesser Principalities, noted in the Maps of <HI>Germany</HI> thus, <HI>Au Maison de Austriche,</HI> especially in the Circle of <HI>Swabia.</HI></P>
<P>By the Death of this Prince as Emperor, <HI>Charles</HI> comes into no accession, but that of the Kingdom or Electorate of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> by which he has a Voice in the College of Electors; but by this he stands fair to be chosen Emperor.</P>
<P>As then to the Empire, this Prince leaves the Imperial Throne in various Embarrassments, Wars, Alliances and Engagements, which one way or other respect indeed the whole Christian World.</P>
<P N="1">1. The whole Empire falls under this Gene∣ral Embarrassment, That there being no King of the <HI>Romans</HI> Elected, there is no immediate Successor to enter upon the Imperial Admini∣stration; nor can there be any Management of the Imperial Affairs, but as by the Golden Bull, or Constitution of the Empire Directed by the Arbishop of <HI>Mentz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
This immediately produces this unhappy Consequence, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That it Embroils all <HI>Germany</HI> in Factions and Parties in order to a new Election. A thing so unexpected, so un∣foreseen, so unthought of, that it is hard to Guess who shall be a Candidate for such an ex∣traordinary Advancement: None of the Electors themselves seem Capable.</P>
<P>To explain this, and that we may be under∣stood as we go along, we mean by Capable, ei∣ther they are in Circumstances which render them unfit for the Empire, or the Empire unfit for them; either their Circumstances are such as that the Electors can by no means think of Choosing them, or in Circumstances, that if they did Choose them, they would by no means accept of it. <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>PRUSSIA, or BRANDENBURGH, is a Protestant, and newly Erected into a King, and it is not a very wide Conjecture to say he would not accept it, having a Powerful and Commanding Interest in that part of <HI>Europe,</HI> yet such an Interfering Interest on many ac∣counts with the Imperial Affairs, that as it would not be his Interest to accept the Imperial Dignity, so neither could it be the Interest of any of the other Electors to Choose him, and this on many Accounts too great, and too many to enter upon here.</P>
<P>SAXONY has accepted another Crown, and could not be chosen Emperor without ef∣fectually either Relinquishing the Crown of <HI>Poland</HI> a second time, or Embroiling the whole Empire in a Bloody and Fatal War with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> a thing at such a time as this not to be thought on, without hazarding the very Impe∣rial
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
Crown it self, while so many other Wars at once oppress or threaten it.</P>
<P>BAVARIA is an Exile, and has none to recommend him, is under the Ban, Declar'd a Rebbel to the Empire, his Electorate seized up∣on, and the upper <HI>Palatinate,</HI> part of it actually given to, and vested in the Elector <HI>Palatine.</HI></P>
<P>HANNOVER has accepted the Succession of <HI>Britain,</HI> which he would be Distracted if he should quit for two Empires.</P>
<P>The next are the Ecclesiastick Electors, and they cannot be Emperors by the Con∣stitution. The only Prince left is King <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the Elector Palatine, and the Con∣sequences of these being chosen, shall be con∣sidred by themselves.</P>
<P N="2">2. As Emperor, the Throne, or Imperial Crown, is left in these Embarrassments.</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> A Fierce and Bloody War with the Male∣contents in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> Subject to the Emperor as King of <HI>Hungary;</HI> a War, which as their King was Emperor, the whole Imperial Power was embark'd in against them; but if their So∣vereign should come to be only Head of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> it may be doubtful how well he would be able to deal with them, as they may be back'd with <HI>Swedish, Turkish,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Assistance.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> A League Offensive and Defensive with <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> against the <HI>Turks;</HI> which League, in case the <HI>Turks</HI> should Invade <HI>Poland,</HI> as there is very little Reason to hope they will not, must necessarily Involve the Empire in a terrible War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and this at a time, when the Empire it self is Embroil'd on every
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
side: In <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> with the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Poles;</HI> in <HI>Bavaria,</HI> with the Exil'd Elector, who eagerly waits an opportunity to return, and his Subjects, as eagerly an opportunity to receive him: In <HI>Italy,</HI> with King <HI>Philip,</HI> who being possest of <HI>Sicily,</HI> lies at the Door of <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> ready to enter when the <HI>Neopolitans,</HI> al∣ready Malecontents enough at the <HI>German</HI> Go∣vernment, shall give them the least opportunity.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> A Cruel and Expensive War against <HI>France</HI> in General, in Conjunction with the Confederates, <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> with the other Members of the Grand Alliance.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> The Affair of King <HI>Charles</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> which tho' it is true, that it is indeed a branch of the same War, yet has particularly lain hard upon the Emperor to support, as being so much for the Particular Interests of the Imperial House; and which way however it may now go, cannot be abandon'd, without giving up entire∣ly the Confederates, and breaking in upon the Grand Alliance above-named.</P>
<P>It is not so much the design of this Tract, to draw a Scheme of the present Interests of the Empire as it is to examine how the Interest of the respective Powers in <HI>Europe</HI> stand as to a new Election, and this we concieve to be the great present concern, not of this Nation only, but of all the Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> and what our Eyes at this time are generally upon.</P>
<P>There is no question but <HI>Charles,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> and now called King of <HI>Spain,</HI> is next Heir to all the Hereditary Dominions of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> the Emperor having left no Male-Issue.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
There is no question, But, had the Arch-Duke <HI>Charles</HI> not been declar'd King of <HI>Spain,</HI> he would at this time have been Unanimously elected King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and declared Em∣peror.</P>
<P>But the question properly before us, <HI>is this,</HI> Whether shall the King of <HI>Spain</HI> content him∣self with the Hereditary Dominions of <HI>Au∣stria,</HI> taking his Hazard with the Confederates for the Recovery of the Monarchy of <HI>Spain,</HI> and so decline the Imperial Dignity? or de∣clining his pursuit of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, as attended with great Hazard, Expence, Diffi∣culty and Uncertainty, Shall he immediately apply himself to Cultivate his Interest in the Colledge of Electors, in order to obtain the Imperial Dignity?</P>
<P>OR, Taking <HI>Spain</HI> to be his Hereditary Right, which now no doubt it is, <HI>tho' before it was not,</HI> shall endeavour to be Chosen Emperor, and keep his hold of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy at the same time? As to what the King of <HI>Spain</HI> will resolve in this Case, no Man can determine, we are very well aware, that Princes, like other Men, never think they have too much; never give up any thing they can lay hold on; or part with any thing they can keep: And no doubt but King <HI>Charles</HI> may be very willing to be Emperor and King of <HI>Spain</HI> too, of which we shall come to speak by it self.</P>
<P>But as to the first Choice, if we might speak for King <HI>Charles,</HI> there seems to be no Compa∣rison in the Choice; but that if he can obtain to be Chosen Emperor, and enjoy all the Heredi∣tary Dominions of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> it seems much better to him, than the Uncertain
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Game of a War, which yet he knows not how it shall end We need spend no time in making the Comparison between the Circumstances of the two Dominions, they are both vastly great, however we shall in brief sum up the Account of both:</P>
<P>The Imperial Dignities Superiour, <HI>that is first allow'd,</HI> however I shall rate that at but very little, being of no Weight in the Wealth or Power of the Prince.</P>
<P>The Influence, Power, and Advantages, in, over, and from the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> are in∣finitely more to the Empire than to <HI>Spain;</HI> nor is there any Comparison between the figure a King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and an Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> makes in the World: The former is unable to stand upon his own Legs against the meanest of the Capital Powers of <HI>Europe;</HI> the latter's able to Defend it self against the most Powerful, and has, on several occasions, by its own meer Strength, carried on the Greatest Wars in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Native strength of the Empire is, with∣out Comparison, more than Ten-fold superior to that of <HI>Spain,</HI> if we take it as it now stands: The Emperor, at the time of his Death, main∣tain'd out of his own Treasury above 200000 Men, besides the Troops of the Circles, which they call the Army of the Empire, the Charge of which is what they call the <HI>Roman Months,</HI> Levied by Quota upon the Princes of the Em∣pire, and besides the Armies which the several Electors are able, and are oblig'd to bring into the Field, when the whole is in Danger. Were the Troubles of <HI>Hungaria</HI> appeased, and the
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
whole Strength of that Kingdom united, the Emperor has been able to raise very great Forces in that Kingdom, and in <HI>Transylvania;</HI> and in the late War against the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Emperor had above 80000 <HI>Hungarians, Tran∣sylvanians</HI> and <HI>Croatians</HI> in his Army.</P>
<P>The weakness of <HI>Spain,</HI> especially at this time, either in Money or in Troops, is such; that tho' the Dominions are vastly large, and speaking of the <HI>Spanish Indies,</HI> they may be said to have more Money than all the World, yet they make no Figure, can raise no Men, can do nothing in the World Comparatively to make a Monarch Great, or themselves Regarded.</P>
<P>We might mention the Difference of the Peo∣ple as to the Soldierly part of things, the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> and <HI>Hungarians</HI> are Warlike, Bold, Da∣ring, Enterprising and Hardy, and make as good Soldiers as any in the World; the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> Proud, Slothful, Effeminate, Cowardly and unfit for War; in short, good for nothing: Nor can the King of <HI>Spain</HI> Raise an Army in any of his Dominions, that when they are Rais'd and Arm'd, may be depended upon.</P>
<P>It is indeed true, that, were a Politic Active Prince upon the <HI>Spanish</HI> Throne, that were to regulate the Oeconomy of that vast Monarchy, that could bring their Trade to a New Model, Encourage Manufactures and Industry, and set the Inhabitants to Improve themselves; that the Immense Treasure they possess might not necessary flow from them to other Countries for the Manufactures and Labour of Nations re∣mote to them; that could bring the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
to Arts, Sciences, Industry and War, they would recover themselves, and be the Greatest Nation in the World: But this must be the Work of Time, perhaps of Ages, and no Prince can expect to bring them to it in his Reign.</P>
<P>For these Reasons it cannot be doubted, but that King <HI>Charles</HI> will, upon the first News of the Death of the Emperor, make the best of his way to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to take possession of the Hereditary Dominions of his Brother, and to make his Interest Good, in order to be Elected Emperor.</P>
<P>We shall next suppose the Case either way:</P>
<P>1<HI>st,</HI> Suppose he fails in the latter, and is not chosen Emperor, but the Choice falls upon some other Prince.</P>
<P>If this happens, the first thing to be said is, That New Emperor comes to the Imperial Dignity in a weak Divided Posture, uncapable to support the Figure in the present War which the last Emperors have made; because the He∣reditary Dominions of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> shall be then in another Hand, from which He∣reditary Dominions, the main Strength both in Men and Money which the last Emperor car∣ried on the War with are derived. Let us see how this respects the present Confederacy.</P>
<P>It is the Empire then only, and not the Em∣peror, which will be the Member of the Confe∣deracy, and the House of <HI>Austria</HI> remains no more a branch of the Alliance. It is true, we have complain'd that the Emperor did nothing, and the Emperor did not do his part, and the
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Empire Gain'd by the War, and the like: But when you come to Distinguish between the Em∣peror and the Empire, you will find then that indeed the Emperor, not the Empire, has done all. Have we not, <HI>we mean the Confederates now Eugag'd in the War against</HI> France, 18000 Impe∣rial Troops in <HI>Flanders,</HI> 8000 upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> 12000 in <HI>Piemont,</HI> 12000 in <HI>Bavaria,</HI> 10000 in <HI>Millain, Mantua,</HI> and the other Fiefs in <HI>Italy,</HI> 8000 in <HI>Naples,</HI> and 16000, including these now sending in <HI>Spain;</HI> all these are acting against <HI>France,</HI> or keeping possession of those Countries, which, if they were not there, would soon fall into the Power of the <HI>French:</HI> And of these Troops not one Regiment are maintain'd by the Empire, but by the Emperor in his Here∣ditary Capacity. The Empire maintains in∣deed the Garrisons of <HI>Landau, Philipsburgh, Friburgh,</HI> and the Forest Towns, with the For∣tifications upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Neckar.</HI> The Empire sends the Circular Troops little Quo∣ta's and Parties of Men which compose the Army upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and were we to trust to them, it would soon appear what would be the fate of the Confederacy. From whence this Consequence may be drawn,</P>
<P>That it is the manifest Interest of the Confe∣deracy, that the Imperial Crown should be continued in the House of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>This will best be Demonstrated, by suppo∣sing any other Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> Elected to the Imperial Throne.</P>
<P>The Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> is the Man we might pre∣sume to stand fairest for it, and this Prince has in∣deed some Dominions of his own in the Empire, as the <HI>Electorate,</HI> the <HI>Ʋpper Palatinate,</HI> with the
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Dutchy of <HI>Juliers</HI> and <HI>Berg;</HI> out of all which the utmost Strength he can Raise and Maintain, and that but for a while, might be about 28 or 30000 Men, to speak with the most.</P>
<P>Will this be an equivalent to the House of <HI>Austria?</HI> will this carry on the War in <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emont, Italy,</HI> and the <HI>Rhine?</HI> will this be able to sup∣port the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lliance, and the Degree of it, which the Emperor hath always been Rated at?</P>
<P>It is true, that if this were pushed, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> being then possest of the Dominions of <HI>Austria,</HI> might apply the whole strength there∣of to support his Pretentions to <HI>Spain;</HI> But we must then ask, Suppose a War with the <HI>Turks</HI> fall upon him? the House of <HI>Austria</HI> is indeed Potent, but was never able to stand against the <HI>Turks</HI> without the Assistance of the Empire, which, by this War with <HI>France,</HI> is render'd unable, not to Assist only, but even to Defend her self.</P>
<P>Besides, the Elector Palatine is already a Member of the Confederacy, and all the Power of his Dominions is exerted in the War already, we have 12000 of his Men in the Army in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> 8000 in the Garrisons and Army on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> 6000 in <HI>Spain,</HI> so that his Hereditary Power would be no addition to the Confedera∣cy, to make up the loss of the House of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>The next Prince that had any view this way, is King <HI>Augustus</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and it is true, he is a powerful Prince, whether we reckon his Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> or no; and perhaps more Powerful without, than with the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> as things now stand; because, were he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be chosen Emperor without the Kingdom of <HI>Pland,</HI> he would immediately come into good
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
Terms with the <HI>Swede;</HI> who upon Replacing King <HI>Stanislaus,</HI> would, no doubt, give King <HI>Augustus</HI> very good Conditions of Peace, and back his Pretentions to the Empire. But as it is, in League with the <HI>Czaar,</HI> and in Possession of <HI>Poland,</HI> none of the Princes of the Empire can be thought to be willing to make him Em∣peror,</P>
<P N="1">1. Because he is certain to bring the whole Empire into a broil, with, not the <HI>Turks</HI> only, but <HI>the Swedes,</HI> a Nation always terrible to the Empire.</P>
<P N="2">2. Because the Accession of <HI>Poland,</HI> with his Confederacy with the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> is so powerful an Article, as may in time, after Peace may be made with <HI>Sweden,</HI> make him too strong for the rest of the Princes, and give them just ap∣prehensions of his being too great for the Com∣mon Tranquility of the Empire.</P>
<P>We see then no Prince in the World, Ca∣pable of supporting that Figure which the Em∣perors have done in the present Confederacy, <HI>but a Prince of the House of</HI> Austria; and if the Intrest of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Family is abstract∣ed from the Imperial Throne, the <HI>French</HI> pre∣sently break in at the Gap so made, or the weight of the War must double upon the Con∣federates, in support of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> and the War, both in <HI>Italy,</HI> on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and it <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>It then follows most Naturally, to enquire what must be done with the Affair of <HI>Spain,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the present King of <HI>Spain</HI> Succeeds his Brother in the Empire.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
All the World will readily allow, that to place the House of <HI>Austria</HI> in the Imperial Throne, and give him <HI>Spain</HI> too, is just setting up the Exorbitant Power we have been so long a pulling down. The greatness of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> has been as fatal to <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and indeed much more, than that of the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> and cost much more Blood and Treasure to pull down: Witness the Forty years War between the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and the <HI>Holland∣er;</HI> Witness the Civil Wars in <HI>France;</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Armada against <HI>England;</HI> and the Wars in <HI>Germany,</HI> under <HI>Gustavus Adolphus;</HI> in the Histories of all which, it will appear, That the greatness of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> was a Terror to <HI>Europe,</HI> from the days of the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V, which was in the Year 1519. to the Peace of <HI>Munster,</HI> Anno. 1648; and that this Greatness began, in the joyning the Impe∣rial and <HI>Spanish</HI> Crowns together, and from no other Original is manifest.</P>
<P><HI>It was the Memory of this Exorbitance, that made the late King</HI> William <HI>say to Sir</HI> William Temple <HI>when the Treaty of</HI> Nimeguen <HI>was on Foot,</HI> That if they endeavour'd to push the <HI>French</HI> beyond the Treaty of the Pyrenees, he should, from that time, become as much a <HI>French-man,</HI> as he was then a <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>Those People then who are for Uniting again the Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> and the Imperial Crown, in the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> would do well to look back upon the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Vth, Em∣peror, and his Successors; let them view his Power Conjunctly, and that of his Successors Separately, and see what Spoil was made in the World, what Convulsions <HI>Europe</HI> felt, what
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
Struggles they made to pull down that Power, and to prevent its Over-running <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V, possess'd at the same time all <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> together with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions in <HI>America,</HI> whole and Undisturbed; he had the whole Empire of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> all the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> including the United Provinces or what we call the States General, for the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were then no separate Na∣tion; He possest all the Hereditary Countries of <HI>Austria</HI> except <HI>Hungary;</HI> He was twice en∣tirely Master of all <HI>Italy;</HI> had all the Islands of the Mediterranean in his Hands, on this side the <HI>Adriatick Gulph,</HI> or <HI>Ionian Sea;</HI> He had large Possessions on the Coast of <HI>Africk;</HI> had the Kingdom of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and the City of <HI>Tripoly</HI> in his Hands; He had <HI>Rome</HI> in Possession, and the Pope and King of <HI>France</HI> in Prison; in short, he may be said to have Commanded Half the World.</P>
<P>At his Death he divided this vast extent of Government between two, <HI>viz.</HI> his Son <HI>Philip,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Firdinand;</HI> and either of these grew so great, tho' in their separated Capacity, that they grew terrible to the World.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> had <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Indies, Portugal,</HI> and the <HI>Brasils,</HI> the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Millan,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch Comte,</HI> and the Island-Kingdoms of the Mediterranean; such as <HI>Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Majorca</HI> and <HI>Mi∣norca:</HI> With these he grew so monstrous Great, that he Invaded and Landed in <HI>Ireland;</HI> push'd at the Possession of <HI>France</HI> in the Affair of the <HI>Holy League;</HI> had a Garrison in the City of <HI>Paris;</HI> and prepar'd his <HI>Invincible Armada</HI> for the Conquest of <HI>England;</HI> and as light as we
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
make of it now, <HI>But for God and the Dutch,</HI> he had carried his point.</P>
<P>This raised <HI>Europe</HI> upon him, as the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Exorbitance has done now upon <HI>France;</HI> and in that War the <HI>Dutch</HI> Revolted, his Navy was overthrown, <HI>France</HI> rescued her self from him, <HI>Portugal</HI> recover'd her Independent Con∣dition, and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Greatness fell into con∣temptible Indolence and Incapacity, as we see them at this time.</P>
<P>The other Branch in the Emperor descending by Succession to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> II. came to such a height, that the Empire became Chain'd to his Sword, the Liberties of <HI>Germany</HI> sunk under the Terrour of General <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Army; till the Uni∣versal Ruin of the Protestant Interest being at the Door, and the Sack of the City of <HI>Magde∣burgh</HI> making them desperate, the famous <HI>Con∣clusions of Leipsick</HI> were made; the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was Invited over, and the Great Battle of <HI>Leip∣sick</HI> fought, where the Imperial Army, <HI>Invincible till then,</HI> was entirely overthrown; and that War was afterwards carried on with incredible Suc∣cess, till the Liberties of <HI>Germany</HI> were entirely restored by the Treaty of <HI>Munster, Anno</HI> 1648.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness Cost an Immense profusion of Blood and Treasure, and 130 Years War to pull it down; in which, if we may be∣lieve the Histories of those Times, above Six Millions of People perish'd, and <HI>Philip</HI> II. of <HI>Spain</HI> said himself, the War with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> only, Cost him 368 Millions of Ducats.</P>
<P>If <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> if the Great Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> if <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France,</HI> if Queen <HI>Eli∣sabeth</HI> of <HI>England</HI> were to rise from their Graves, and see the Men of this Age, the Polititians of
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
these Times, going about to restore this <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness again, by a New Conjunction of the Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> with the Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> to one <HI>Austrian</HI> Head, they would certainly say the People of <HI>Europe</HI> were Blind or Mad. Those People that would have this wild step taken, would do well in the next place to ex∣amine who they will lose by it, and what Power will immediately go over to <HI>France,</HI> or to any body, to oppose it.</P>
<P>And first let them tell us what the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> will say to it: It is not for an Author in Print to tell the World positively what a So∣vereign Prince will, or will not do: But tho' we mean so perhaps most directly, we shall put it into other Terms thus; Suppose it a Privy Councellor of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> giving his Opinion to his Master in Words like these:</P>
<P>Sir, Your Royal Highness's Dominions being seated as it were in the Center, between three mighty Powers or Potentates, <HI>viz. Spain, France,</HI> and the <HI>Empire,</HI> your Safety consists meerly in the Antipathies of those three Powers, and the Impossibility of their being separately wil∣ling that any one of them should possess your Country, which by the addition of such Strength, would give a great s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>periority to that Side that possess'd it, over both the other.</P>
<P>Your Country being without Comparison, Inferiour to any one of the three, and border∣ing upon the Dominions of them all, nothing is more Essential to your Highnesses Interest, than to keep up the said Antipathies, and prevent
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
the Conjunction of any two of the said Powers into one, for that by Consequence those two so joyned, over-powering the third, will Destroy you.</P>
<P>Wherefore if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> should offer to be Elected Emperor, without relinquishing his Claim to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, your Royal Highness ought immediately to joyn all your Power with some other; whether <HI>France,</HI> or any else to prevent it.</P>
<P>Nor let any Man think the D—of <HI>S—y</HI> so blind to his own safety, as not to listen to such Advice as this, or rather so blind as not to see without any body's Advice, that this is his true Interest, and the only way to prevent his Destruction.</P>
<P>Come we next to the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> of whom we have an Account already, That the <HI>French</HI> have set on Foot a Negotiation to Unite them in a League against the Encroachments of the House of <HI>Austria.</HI> The mighty Power of the Emperor, and the probability there has been of that Power being doubled, by the set∣ting up King <HI>Charles</HI> on the Throne of <HI>Spain,</HI> has stirr'd up the Inclination of those Princes to form such a League; and nothing but the fear of that Power, and the apprehensions they have, least <HI>France</HI> may not be able to protect them in their new Engagements, has prevent∣ed the Execution of it.</P>
<P>But shall we think that upon such a Con∣juncture as this, if King <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> should attempt to Unite the <HI>Spanish</HI> and Imperial Crown again in one Head, the Reasons which moved before, will not double in their Strength,
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
especially while the fears that prevented the finishing that Design shall justly vanish by the Death of the Emperor, and the first Difficulties that appear in settling so great an Event?</P>
<P>Let us Examine the present State of <HI>Italy</HI> a little, with respect to their Affection to the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness:</P>
<P N="1">1. The Pope, he is Exasperated to the highest Degree by the Insults of the <HI>Germans</HI> in many respects; their Seizing of <HI>Commacchio,</HI> Raising Infinite Contributions, Pillaging and Plunder∣ing on the Ecclesiastick Territories and the Lands of the Church; falling upon him by force of Arms, and obliging his Holiness to Disburse large Sums to Disband his Forces, and pay the <HI>Germans</HI> Quarters by the Ruin of his Subjects of the <HI>Bolognese</HI> and <HI>Ferrarese,</HI> without any Sa∣tisfaction; the City of <HI>Cammachio</HI> being not yet restored to him, but the Pretensions of the Duke of <HI>Modena</HI> Privately supported against him, as a pretence to keep a long possession, and at last to draw a great Sum of Money out of his Hands.</P>
<P>Besides these things, the Pope has receiv'd Infinite Mortifications, as in the Marching of Count <HI>Thaun</HI> the Emperor's General with the Imperial Army to the Conquest of <HI>Naples:</HI> Not thro' the Territories of the Church only, but even into the Gates of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> with∣out asking the Pope leave; the Ravages and Disorders of the <HI>Germans</HI> in their March; the Contributions and the Quartering of Soldiers in the Ecclesiastick State, and the haughty Car∣riage of the Imperial Minister the Marquis <HI>de Prie,</HI> in the several Treaties for the Accomo∣dation of those Grievances.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22"/>
These and many more, added to the Native Inclinations of the Pope to the Interest of the Most Christian King, in all the Debates between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> have been Morti∣fications sufficient, to make his Holyness glad of any occasion to cast off the <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Austrian</HI> Yoke; but much more, when it shall appear that the doubling the Power of that Yoke is Transacting as above, by Joyning the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy to the Emperor in one Head.</P>
<P>The Great Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> has been under like Dissatisfactions as the Pope, tho' not so much provoked; and the Payment of 50000 Pistoles every year Contribution to the <HI>Germans,</HI> has been always protested against by his Highness, as an Injustice, and which he submitted to, meer∣ly by the Violence and Power of the Imperial Armies, not with any sence of its being a Legal Demand. And the said Duke, having all along been a Neuteral Prince, will, it's to be fear'd, come into such Measures as may prevent his be∣ing oblig'd to quit his most advantageous Neu∣trality, by which his Port of <HI>Leghorn</HI> enjoys more Trade at this time than the City of <HI>Venice,</HI> and more by Ten times than ever it did before.</P>
<P>The <HI>Genoese</HI> are in the same Grievance, of whom, tho' no part of their Territory lyes in the Seat of the War, yet 40000 Pistoles have been Annually extorted, for Contributions to the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can it but be feared, that all the rest of the Petty Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> will take just Umbrage at a Conjunction of Power, which as it is now, is formidable to them; but as it will be then, may effectually devour them; especi∣ally since <HI>France,</HI> which was, in former times, the
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
only defence against the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness, shall be so reduc'd, as to be in no Capacity to Relieve them in such Distress.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Calabria,</HI> are, on the other hand, a living and visible Motive to their Apprehensions, whose Groans under the <HI>German</HI> Government, are so loud, that the Viceroy expecting every hour they should rise in Arms, is Night and Day watching and guard∣ing against the Surprize.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>S—y</HI> comes in again to the number of these; who, notwithstanding the great and faithful Services done to the Com∣mon Cause and the mighty Losses suffer'd in the Ravaging his Country Demolishing his For∣tresses, <HI>(viz.) errue, Verciel, Montmellian</HI> and o∣thers, with the Siege of his Capital of <HI>Turin,</HI> yet has, in Three years solicitation, not been able to obtain the Investiture of the little Country of <HI>Vigevano, about as big as the County of Middle∣sex,</HI> tho' the Agreement of giving it up to him, past at <HI>Milan,</HI> upon his Second Alliance.</P>
<P>The Republic of <HI>Venice,</HI> Politic and Wary, have hither to kept themselves out of the Broil; but should they see this step going to be taken, they are too Penetrating not to know, they shall be no longer in a Condition to refuse the Imperialists passage thro' the <HI>Veronese,</HI> or to maintain their Neutrality; they cannot so early forget, how the <HI>Spanish</HI> General <HI>Cordonaa,</HI> Ravaged their whole Dominions on the <HI>Terrae Firma,</HI> Cannonaded <HI>Venice</HI> it self from the Main Land, and Beat <HI>Seignior Bartholomew Alvi∣ano</HI> at the Great Battle of <HI>Vineenza.</HI> These therefore will certainly joyn in opposing the Conjunction.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
Thus <HI>France</HI> gains the D—of <HI>S</HI>—, Re-enters <HI>Italy,</HI> brings all the Princes into a League, which this year he has been disappoint∣ed in, and of which the <HI>French</HI> will be Garran∣tees; and all the work on that Side, may be to be done over again.</P>
<P>Come we next to the Elector <HI>Palatine:</HI> He is Uncle to the late Emperor by the Mother's Side, being the Empress <HI>Dowager</HI>'s Own Bro∣ther, and the only Prince, in the Temporal Election, who is in any probable Posture of putting in for the Imperial Crown; and as he may seem to Rival his Nephew King <HI>Charles,</HI> so, we may be assur'd, should he do so, he will take all those for his Enemies that shall Oppose him. The Power of this Prince, it is confess'd, is not Great; but as he may expect in such a Case, to add the Electorate of <HI>Bavaria</HI> to himself upon such an Advancement, it will considerably add to him, and it cannot be doubted but he would be very well supported on this side: But should the Pretensions of his Nephew King <HI>Charles</HI> be push'd on, and at the same time the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> be reserv'd to him also, this Prince, might be found among the number of those that would Oppose, as adding a Power to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> which none of the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> ever can desire to see them a Se∣cond time possest of.</P>
<P>We might here also enquire, what the Princes of the House of <HI>Saxony</HI> and of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> would think to be their Interest in such a Case as this? and if we may suppose they will Judge, by what their Ancestors felt under the Exorbi∣tant Greatness of the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> From which, had they not been deliver'd by the
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
Great <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> there had by this time been no such thing as an Election of an Emperor to be made. If they may, <HI>We say,</HI> be suppos'd to make a Judgment by the Antient Miseries of their Country, they will, One and All, Oppose the making any Man Emperor, who shall so much as make a pretence to the Monar∣chy of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus in a brief manner related some∣thing of the Interest of the Respective Princes and Powers concern'd in the Affair of the Empire; we come to enquire a little, what it can be reasonable to suppose is the Interest of King <HI>Charles</HI> himself? and in what man∣ner he ought, to act upon this Juncture? We have not yet toucht at what the <HI>English, Dutch, French</HI> or <HI>Swedes,</HI> may have in view re∣lating to this matter; We shall come to it of Course, when We shall consider the Interest of the Confederacy in General, as it stands now involved in a Bloody War against <HI>French</HI> Power, and may be Influenc'd by the Election, one way or other, of an Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> which indeed will not be a little.</P>
<P>But before we come to this, it seems proper to enquire a little, what the King of <HI>Spain</HI> will or will not do in this nice Conjuncture: By what he will do, is not to be understood, as if we pre∣tended to foretell what Measures he will take, or to be of his Council; But rather, as in the Head before is exprest, what he shou'd do, what, as things appear, and as the World now stands, complexly consider'd, it is his Interest to do, and what he ought to do for his own Advan∣tage, and the Peace of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
We do confess it seems a difficult thing to Determine on the side of King <HI>Charles,</HI> because of the uncertain Circumstances of his Affairs at this time; for if he relinquishes his preten∣sions to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy▪ in order to be chosen Emperor, and should fail of that also, then he loses by the Choice, and must sit down by his Hereditary Dominions; in which if he should have the <HI>Turks</HI> and Malecontents of <HI>Hungary</HI> to deal with all, his Hereditary Do∣minions being Frontiers to the Empire; he may be ill'able to defend himself without the Assist∣ance of the Emperor that shall be Elected, which Emperor, if he (K. <HI>Charles)</HI> has first opposed in his Election, maybe little enclin'd to assist him, and perhaps willing enough to see his Power lessened.</P>
<P>On the other hand, It seems hard to expect of him, that he should relinquish his Claim or Pretensions to the Empire, the peaceable pos∣session of which would place him in so great a figure in the World, and the War being happily ended, would render him the first Soveraign in <HI>Europe,</HI> and, in some respects, the most powerful. Neither do we undertake to determine which, or how many of the Hereditary Dominions of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> descends to K. <HI>Charles</HI> by the Emperor's Death, the two Arch-Dutchesses, Daughters to his Majesty, being alive; but for Ar∣gument sake will suppose them all to be his own.</P>
<P>And here I think this Prince may reflect with some regret upon the obstinacy of some of his Friends in the World, who would not consent to Peace, upon the least dismembring of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy; which if it had been done, he had now been settled in that part, and left free to push his Fortunes for the Empire, on the foot of his <HI>Austrian</HI> Interest.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>
But this is past, we come now to enquire what is the present Interest of King <HI>Charles</HI> III And this is to be consider'd in General, and in Particular.</P>
<P>In General▪ and abstracted from his Allies, it is no doubt his Interest to be both Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as it is all Mens Interest to make themselves as Rich, as Great, and as Powerful as they can; and yet even in General, it is his Interest not so to Grasp at All, as to Lose All. And therefore to descend to Particulars:</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> There is no doubt it is the Interest of King <HI>Charles</HI> to post away to <HI>Vienna</HI> with all speed, and to use all his Interest, and all his Friends, to be Chosen Emperor; no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is there any great question of his obtaining the Choice, as the Affairs of <HI>Germany</HI> now stand; no Prince pretending to it, being of equal Power to De∣fend and Support the Empire in its present Embarrassment, as a Prince of the House of <HI>Austria:</HI> So that not only his own Interest, but the Interest of all the Electors, and the Interest of the Allies too, <HI>of which I shall speak by it self,</HI> seem to concurr in offering to him the Imperial Dignity. As to his own Interest, it is founded upon several just Considerations:</P>
<P N="1">1. Safety, which is the great natural Princi∣ple Imprinted in the Minds of all Men; and the saf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y of his whole Estate, the safety of his Hereditary Countries, the safety of all his real Possessions depend upon his being Elected Em∣peror; without which <HI>Hungary,</HI> already torn to pieces by Civil Distractions, and lying open to a new War threatned from the <HI>Turk,</HI> will certainly be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st: Nor, after such a loss, could the other Provinces of <HI>Austria, Moravia, Sty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia</HI> and <HI>Croatia,</HI> Defend themselves.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="27" REF="28"/>
2. Honour and Soveraignity; the Dignity of Emperor, being far S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>periour, when annex'd to the Hereditary Dom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nions of <HI>Austria,</HI> to any other pretensions he can have in the World.</P>
<P N="3">3. Advantage, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Power, Riches, and the Greatest Inheritance of Property of any Station a Prince of his Rank can receive in the World. <HI>But on the other hand</HI></P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> As it is his Interest to obtain the Em∣pire▪ so it is undoubtedly his Interest to give a General Satisfaction to the Allies, who have hitherto so Generously Supported him, and without whose Concurrence he would find his Claim to the Empire very Difficult, and per∣haps Impracticable: This will lead us to Consider what is the Interest of the Allies at this juncture, with relation to the Empire; But before we proceed to that Enquiry, this of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Interest may be Consider'd a little farther; By Giving Satisfaction to the Allies, may be understood Concerting with them the Terms of his Advancement; such as the Deter∣mining the Succession to the Monarchy of <HI>Spain:</HI> The Terms of a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> when any subsequent Treaty shall be set on Foot, in which Case the Imperial Councils have not always been the most Complying: The Satisfying such Claims as any of the Allies may have depending in the Imperial Court, and which have with so much Difficulty hitherto been Sollicited; such as the Demands of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to <HI>Vige∣vano,</HI> &amp;c. the Dispute with the Pope about re∣storing <HI>Commachio:</HI> The Elector <HI>Palatine</HI>'s re∣maining Claims in the <HI>Ʋpper Palatinate:</HI> The Quiet of the Protestants in <HI>Silesia:</HI> the admit∣ting of a Guarrantee to the Conclusion of the
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
Treaty with the Malecontents in <HI>Hungaria:</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>It needs not that we look back to Consider how great an Obstruction these things remaining unsettled have been to the Affairs of the War: How long the refusing to the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> the Investiture, or Possession of the <HI>Ʋpper Pala∣tinate, tho' it was the Inheritance of his Ancestors, and unjustly given away to the Duke of Bavaria,</HI> retarded the March of his Troops to the Assist∣ance of the Allies; and kept 22000 Men out of the Army: How long the refusing to accept the Guarrantee of the Confederates in the Treaty with the Malecontents in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> has kept the War on Foot there, Diverting above 30000 Imperial Troops from the present War; which had they been employ'd on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> had long before now reduc'd the King of <HI>France</HI> to Terms of Peace: How long a most ridicu∣lous Nicety, at least we think so, about the In∣vesting the D—of <HI>S</HI>—in the Fief of <HI>Vigevano,</HI> has sav'd <HI>Dauphine</HI> and <HI>Provence,</HI> by Dissatisfying and Cooling that Prince in the Prosecution of the War, and so Disgusting him, as that he hath declin'd now for two Campaigns to take the field in Person, or push the <HI>French</HI> in such a manner, as it is not doubted he had otherwise done.</P>
<P>These are things, which as they are of Infi∣nite Concern to the Interest of the Confedera∣cy, so it cannot be doubted but King <HI>Charles,</HI> when he remembers the great Obligations he is already, and may hereafter be under to the Al∣lies, will think himself bound in Gratitude to Consider, and to Remove the Difficulties which <HI>Europe</HI> has so long labour'd under on that ac∣count.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30"/>
Besides, as these are some of the things, in which we say the House of <HI>Austria</HI> has not al∣ways seen their own Interest any more than that of its Allies, having not given such heed to the Remonstrances of the Confederates as it were to have been wish'd, or as some think, was due to the Respect they, <HI>the Allies,</HI> shew'd, and the sincere aim they always appeared to have for the Imperial Interest; so the present Prince its hop'd, having been among those that has in part Suffer'd under the ill Consequence of those Mea∣sures, may be brought to be the more sensible of the Mistake, and in time to take a differing Course more to the Advantage of Himself, as well as of his Friends; and in this hope, we fully Acquiesce in his approaching Advancement to the Imperial Dignity.</P>
<P>But the main thing in which we say it is his Interest to give Satisfaction to the Confede∣rates, is, in his consenting to a new Concert of Measures; for the present claim to the Crown of <HI>Spain; whether,</HI> to remain in himself with such Restrictions and Appointments as shall be concerted by the General Consent, and as may make <HI>Europe</HI> easie; or to Relinquish and Demit the same in favour of such other Branch of his House, as shall be by the same general Consent agreed and concerted.</P>
<P>And this indeed is the main thing, whether it respect his own Interest, or that of the Confederates in general. <HI>First,</HI> As it respects his own Interest; since, let the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> concert their measures ever so well, and con∣curr ever so heartily in his advancement to the Imperial Crown, we may venture to say, with a small share of Prophesy, That many other
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
Princes and Powers, now Zealous for the Con∣federacy, will not easily come into it, but may oppose it with all their Power, and perhaps, for∣sake their Engagement with us in the Common Cause▪ if they find it insisted on.</P>
<P>We need not repeat the Names and Interest of these: The Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> have a more than ordinary Concern in this, with all the Protestant Electors, and Princes of <HI>Germany;</HI> and if the Elector of <HI>Hanover</HI> comes into Measures, we must believe he rather acts in Complaisance to the mea∣sures of the Maritime Powers, than by the Dictates of his <HI>German</HI> Interest, or of his Judgment.</P>
<P>We come next, to the Interest of the Con∣federates in this great turn of Affairs; it is a great Point, and requires to be considred many ways.</P>
<P>1<HI>st. Complexly</HI> or as a Confederacy, and here we may examine how the Interest of the Grand Alliance stands, <HI>as such.</HI></P>
<P>As the Grand Alliance is only a Concert of Measures among the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> the principle part of those Princes being United in One Body, to carry on a War for the main∣taining the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and reducing the Exorbitant Power of <HI>France;</HI> become by his Innumerable Accession, a Terror to his Neighbour, and Dangerous to the whole Body. Take them thus Complexly, and form'd into a Body for these ends: There is no question but it is their Interest, to have the House of <HI>Austria</HI> possess at this time, both <HI>Spain,</HI> the Empire, and all the Dominions that attend them both.</P>
<P>Yet this is not their Interest immediately, as a Confederacy, on account of the Family of
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
<HI>Austria</HI> only, any more than to any other Prince equally steddy to the Confederacy; so much as it is so, on the account that no other Prince can be suppos'd to rise to that Degree, without some Intrigue, Difficulty, Opposition, and per∣haps, breaking the Interest that is now so well United.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly. Separately,</HI> Considering the Respective Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> as Members of the Grand Alliance, their Interests perhaps may all be brought to a Center in the Election of King <HI>Charles</HI> to the Empire; but Consider them apart, we shall find few, if any of them, willing to have the Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> added to the Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> in one and the same Soveraign. This then is the present Enquiry before us, <HI>viz.</HI> How stands the several Princes Confederated together in this War, Affected to this new Step, and what is their Interest, as it respects the advancement of this Prince to the Imperial Throne? We mean their Interest in their sepa∣rate Capacity.</P>
<P>We have touch'd already at the Greatness of the House <HI>Austria,</HI> and the Rise, Progress, and Ex∣orbitance of it, and need not repeat it; we men∣tion it only to distinguish in our Arguing, why these or those, are of this or that Opinion. And <HI>First,</HI> It is impossible the Protestant Prin∣ces of <HI>Germany,</HI> if their Eyes are open, can be for such a monstrous encrease to the Power of the House of <HI>Austria: Consider'd, as before, out of the present Confederacy.</HI></P>
<P>We hinted at this before; we do not speak it Reflecting upon the present King <HI>Charles,</HI> but when a Prince may come to the Throne, who knows not JOSEPH, or when this Prince
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
may forget that ever he knew JOSEPH, for Ingratitude hath generally a very bad Memory; when such a thing happens, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssistance given, the Support afforded, the Powers lent to ad∣vance the House of <HI>Austria</HI> to the Throne, may be soon forgotten and laid asleep: For this Reason we say, they cannot consent to such a Monstrous encrease of Power; and all People will allow it a good Reason to Act by, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The probabillity of Posterity sinking under the Power they Unwarily Raise up. The Protestant Prin∣ces of <HI>Germany</HI> are not Distinguish'd from the rest in this Case, only that we think, they have more especial Reason to remember what they felt under the Exorbitance of that very Fami∣ly we now speak of.</P>
<P>The Princes and States of <HI>Italy</HI> are next, these indeed were not so irrecoverably In∣volv'd or Swallow'd up in the Interest and Power of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness, because they had the Assistance of the <HI>French,</HI> in the Struggles they made to Deliver themselves; the Power of <HI>France</HI> having three or four times Possest and Re-possest the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> and Twice the Kingdom of <HI>Naples:</HI> Yet in the Interval of this Assistance, and particularly when <HI>Francis</HI> I. King of <HI>France,</HI> was Prisoner to the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. at the Battle of <HI>Pavia,</HI> then we find <HI>Rome</HI> Besieg'd and Taken by Assault; <HI>Genoa</HI> Storm'd, and given to the Plunder of the Imperial Soldiers; <HI>Millain</HI> Desolated by the Plague brought thi∣ther by the <HI>Germans,</HI> and Reduc'd Twice to ex∣tremity of Famine; <HI>Naples</HI> miserably Harrasd with Sieges and Assaults; and in short, <HI>Italy</HI> in General Overwhelm'd by the <HI>Austrian</HI> Great∣ness, and never obtaining any Relaxation of
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
its Miseries, but by the Assistance of the <HI>French,</HI> who in their turn, made the same Havock of their Liberties and their Country, and made them pay dear for the Deliverance they brought them.</P>
<P>No Man can think the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes can acquiesce at the Conjunction of <HI>Spain</HI> to the Im∣perial Power; and we name it again, <HI>having spoken of this in the first part of this Tract,</HI> upon this account: We are told that the <HI>French,</HI> had already been attempting to concert a League, or private Confederacy between the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> in order to preserve their Liberties from Subjection to the growing Power of the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> which League, they say, was in a fair way of being brought to Perfection, but has been undermin'd and render'd abortive, by the Imperial Councils on that side: But if this attempt of Joyning the Empire and <HI>Spain</HI> should be made, the <HI>French</HI> have such an unan∣swerable Argument to use to the <HI>Venetian,</HI> the Pope, and the Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> who were the Three Powers suppos'd to form that League, that it is to be fear'd they may, with more ease, bring such a League to pass at this time than ever.</P>
<P>We come next to consider the Interest on this side, such as of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> the Two Powers, on whom we may, without assuming say, the weight of the present War, and the Pro∣testant Interest of <HI>Europe</HI> depends. It is true, that these Powers are not so immediately con∣cern'd in the Opressions which may happen from the Exorbitant Power of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and this makes some People among us think little of the Danger, it being at a great distance, not of place only, but remote in time
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
also; for the People of this Age, are remark able for their being more than ever regardless of things to come, yet we are not unconcern'd in it, and therefore ought to be very wary how we assist in laying the Foundation of such a Power, as we may one day be very forward to pull down again.</P>
<P>I know some People pish at this thought, and tell us, The Scene of <HI>Europe</HI> is now Chang'd: that we are not in such Danger of the House of <HI>Austria</HI> as we were then; that the powerful Figure the King of <HI>France</HI> makes in the World is a sufficient Ballance to it all; and, that tho' it were so, our Affairs stand so now, that we cannot help it, we must run the venture.</P>
<P>To this we may answer however, that we ought to be very wary of erecting such a Power in <HI>Europe,</HI> as may one day be too Great for those that set it up to pull down; That there are some Considerations to be thought of in this Case. Such as these:</P>
<P N="1">1. That a time may come, and has been long wished for in <HI>Europe</HI> by the Popish Powers, when a War of Religion shall be set on Foot in Christendom; and that if the Empire and <HI>Spain</HI> comes to be united in one head, whenever Po∣pish Zeal should prompt them to Unite with <HI>France,</HI> to extirpate the <HI>Northern Heresy</HI> as it is called, we should find the Protestant Interest so weakned by this Conjunction, that we should be ill able to maintain our ground against such an United Force.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>England</HI> perhaps as little dreamt of the Danger from the great encrease of <HI>French</HI> Power, when our Shipwrights, and Moulds of our Men of War, Docks, Yards, &amp;c. were lent to the
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
King of <HI>France,</HI> as we may think of the encrease of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatness in Uniting <HI>Spain</HI> and the Empire. I have heard Wise Polititians Quarrel, both the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> for what they have done this way to the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> and tell us, that one time or other, he may bring his Naval Power to be a Terror to us all. King <HI>Charles</HI> II. however some Peo∣ple may Reflect upon his Memory, could never be such an Enemy to his Country, as to Design that <HI>France</HI> should, by his means, beat us at Sea, and cost us Twenty Five Years War to Re∣duce. No Wise Nation will ever build up a Power on purpose to pull down again, or lay a Foundation, that others may build upon with∣out their leave, and be too strong for them to dissolve.</P>
<P N="3">3. The view of such a Conjunction may, and 'tis more than probable will, break off some considerable Branches from the general Confe∣deracy, which may have its immediate ill Con∣sequences, and Weaken, instead of Strength∣ning the Hands of the Allies, in the pursuit of the Common Cause against the Exorbitant Power of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In all the Councils of this Age, and espe∣cially of this War, it has been a Fundamental Article, That no such Conjunction could be Convenient, or for the Interest or Peace of <HI>Europe;</HI> and the Treaty of Partition is Particu∣larly a Proof of this, in the Ninth Article of which, it is Resolv'd by the King of <HI>France,</HI> the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> as a Fundamental of <HI>Europe</HI>'s Peace, absolutely necessary to Posterity, and to prevent the breaking out of new Contests among the Princes
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
and Powers concern'd, <HI>That no Conjunctions of Kingdoms should be form'd:</HI> And to this end it is expresly Stipulated, That if such or such Prin∣ces should die without Issue, to whom such or such Successions are Limited and Determin'd, then to descen'd to the Heirs <HI>So</HI> and <HI>So;</HI> But with this Reserve, that the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> should never devolve to the same Person that was Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> on one hand, or King of <HI>France</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>From all these things it seems very plain, that whatsoever the present Circumstances of the Confederacy may make reasonable to yield to, in order to carry the main Point of Reducing the King of <HI>France,</HI> yet that it can by no means be for the Interest, either of <HI>Europe</HI> in general, the Confederacy in particular, or of the Protestant part of it in especial manner, to joyn the vast extended Dominions of <HI>Spain</HI> and the Empire, in one Branch of the House of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>To make this out, let us take a short view of the immense Greatness of that House if so United, and what trifling Obstructions there will be then in the way, to prevent their finish∣ing by Conquest, such a Figure, as the Christian World must some time or other sink under.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the VIth, would then be Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Mexico;</HI> King of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> King of <HI>Croatia,</HI> King of <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> King of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> King of <HI>Naples,</HI> King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> King of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> King of <HI>Mayorca</HI> and <HI>Minorea;</HI> Prince of <HI>Transilvania;</HI> Arch duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> Duke of Upper and Lower <HI>Silesia,</HI> Duke of
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
<HI>Stiria, Carinthia,</HI> and <HI>Carniola,</HI> Duke of <HI>Millan,</HI> Marquis of <HI>Moravia,</HI> and Count of <HI>Tirol;</HI> be∣sides Duke, Earl, Lord, and actual Possessor of all the <HI>Spanish</HI> Provinces in the <HI>Netherlands;</HI> besides very great Possessions and Powerful Estates in the Empire, particularly in the Cir∣cles of <HI>Swabia</HI> and <HI>Franconia:</HI> And besides this, Infinite and Unbounded Kingdoms, and Do∣minions in <HI>America,</HI> much more than all his Dominions in <HI>Europe</HI> put together; which are an Inexhaustible Fund of Wealth, in Silver, Gold and Jewels, by which he is enabled to Sup∣port and Defend all the Rest.</P>
<P>Now let any Man that can weigh the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> in a just Ballance, tell us what Power in this part of the World, can be set against such a Complicated Fund of Power as this, espe∣cially if that Power comes once into a true me∣thod of Management, such as other States and Kingdoms of <HI>Europe</HI> are at this time Govern'd by.</P>
<P>To obstruct the Conjunction of these Domi∣nions what is there to be named? A few Prin∣ces in <HI>Italy</HI> are the only things worth naming; and the <HI>French</HI> being by this War wholly ex∣cluded <HI>Italy,</HI> How easie is it for the Em∣peror, under shelter of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> to Crush them all? These Princes are, the Pope, the Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Mantua, Modena, Parma,</HI> and <HI>Mi∣randola.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Millan</HI> is his own already, <HI>Mantua</HI> is in his hands by Conquest, <HI>Mirandola</HI> by Sequestration, <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Parma</HI> are not a Morsel, <HI>Tuscany</HI> as little; as to the Pope he may let him remain, for he is then no better than a Royal Prisoner.
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
The <HI>Venetian</HI> we need not name, for they lye out of the way, the Emperor may remove them from the <HI>Terra-sirma</HI> when he pleases: No Power in <HI>Europe</HI> can rescue them.</P>
<P>Thus whole <HI>Italy</HI> may become one Province, fall into the Power, and be added to the Hereditary Dominions of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and all the foundation of Resistance, by reason of <HI>France</HI> being already disabled, will be taken away.</P>
<P>These things seem to be so self-evident, that they leave no more room for any Dispute; and the absolute Necessity of preventing such an Ex∣orbitance of Power cannot but be Convincing to the Reason of every Reader; nor, with humble submission, can it be thought, that the present Circumstances of the Confederacy can make a thing so necessary now, that all the future Con∣sequences of so mighty a Conjunction of Power should be of no Force in our Consultations? The present Confederacy is pretended, to be, and was really Form'd to secure Posterity from the Encroachments of Exorbitancy in any Power, as well as in the King of <HI>France;</HI> and tho' the <HI>French</HI> Greatness is the more immediate Con∣cern of the Grand Alliance, yet the future safe∣ty of <HI>Europe</HI> being the main end, our Eye is to be upon every thing that may render our Po∣sterity unsafe, otherwise the main End of the said Grand Alliance is not pursued and pre∣served.</P>
<P>What else is become of that mighty Word, so popular in the last Reign, which so many talk'd of, and so few understood, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the BALLANCE OF POWER? This <HI>Ballance of Power</HI> has been the Subject of our Specula∣tions;
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
<HI>for this,</HI> Barriers and Restitutions were insisted on in the Treaty of <HI>Reswick; for this,</HI> the several Partitions of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy were Treated of, and this alone made those Partitions seem just. On what account else, could <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> Share and Divide in the World the Possessions of another Nation? Tell <HI>France</HI> what she should be satisfied with; what the Arch-Duke <HI>Charles</HI> should take, and what leave; and prescribe to Posterity, That no Prince for the future should be Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or King of <HI>France</HI> and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> at the same time.</P>
<P>Upon this Notion of the <HI>Ballance of Power,</HI> such steps as these have been taken; the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was to be Transplanted from his Dominions in <HI>Germany</HI> to the Dutchy of <HI>Millan,</HI> and placed to Govern a People whose Language he did not understand; and upon this Notion, this or that Kingdom or Province, was to be appointed this Prince, and this to another, not as the Claim of the Persons Directed, but as the Square of Dominion, the Safety of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Ballance of Power made it necessary.</P>
<P>And is all this Necessity sunk? Is all the mighty Force of the Great Rule, which Guided the Nations before, lost at once? Is there no more need of a Ballance of Power in <HI>Europe?</HI> This seems unaccountably strange, and must be the effect of want of Consideration to the high∣est Degree, in the Politicians of this Day; and should the Notion prevail, it will without doubt, furnish the King of <HI>France</HI> with Argu∣ments too powerful for some Princes in the World to resist; by which, if he should bring them over to espouse his Interest, it may give
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
us a Shock at last in our Designs, and bid fair for undoing what has cost <HI>Europe</HI> so much Blood and Treasure to bring thus far on.</P>
<P>We come now to Consider what Medium may be found out, to settle this Affair to the General Satisfaction of <HI>Europe,</HI> so as to remove the Jealousies of our Friends, take away the Advantages of our Enemies, their opportunity of Dividing us, or being able to render the Confederates, especially those in <HI>Italy,</HI> suspected to one another.</P>
<P>It does not belong to a Common observor to prescribe Methods in things of this moment, nor can it in the compass of these Sheets be expect∣ed, that the Scheme of Accomodating so great a matter should be Drawn at full length; But something may be done as an Essay, for wiser and more penetrating Heads to work upon.</P>
<P>The first Project we meet with of this kind, is to make the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> immediately upon the Advancement of the present King <HI>Charles</HI> III. to the Imperial Dig∣nity.</P>
<P>Let us Consider the Proposal it self first, and then in all its Circumstances.</P>
<P N="1">1. They tell us this is Consider'd in the Grand Alliance, and that it has been Determin'd al∣ready, that in such Case the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> shall be Declar'd King of <HI>Spain;</HI> but in this Article, they do not say one word of what Title, Claim, or Pretence the said Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> makes to this Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> or upon what Foot it stands; if we say the Confederates by meer Concert, and of their own Authority, as Allies, shall undertake to say who shall, or who shall
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
not enjoy such a Crown, we shall then make the Confederates Administrators of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mo∣narchy, and place the Right of Succession in them, which we do not find in the least that they pretend to: It may be true, that the Con∣federates may Concern themselves in the Nega∣tive, for preventing the Union of such and such Dominions in one Head; but to form Titles, or give Kingdoms to such or such Princes, whe∣ther they Derive to those Crowns by Legal Descent or no, is not (according to the General notion of things) in the Power of the Confede∣rates.</P>
<P>Besides, this would be to Recognize the Le∣gallity of a Gift, which is the Title King <HI>Philip</HI> Claims by, and indeed was the Grand Objection against King <HI>Charles</HI> the Third's Title, so long as the Emperor, his Brother, was alive: This we find honestly stated, and boldly too, the Times Cosider'd, by a known Author in this Town, in these Words, or in Words to this Effect:</P>
<P><Q>“”There is no doubt, says he, that the Right of the Succession to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> is in the August House of <HI>Austria;</HI></Q> But if it be a right <HI>Jure Devoluto,</HI> as it is apparent to be, then it only Descends to the Heir, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Eldest Son; and this gives the Title to the Emperor and his Heir Male: From whom it is not in the Power of the Emperor himself, by any Deed, Gift, or Convention, to Alienate that Suc∣cession. If his Imperial Majesty will not take upon him the Administration, his Children, Male or Female, have the Right; and we do not find, but <HI>Spain</HI> may be Govern'd by a Queen, as was apparent in the Reign of <HI>Isabella,</HI> Queen
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
of <HI>Castile,</HI> and <HI>Joanna,</HI> Widow of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> Mother of <HI>Charles</HI> the Vth, and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> I.</P>
<P>But if the Emperor for Reasons of State, and in Compliance with the Allies, did not think fit to take the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> to him∣self, it does not appear that his Imperial Ma∣jesty had any legal Authority to give the same to his Brother King <HI>Ch</HI>—III, which had been a manifest Disinheriting his own Sons if he had or should have any, as was not at all improbable. But if we are oppos'd here, and told, that he had a legal Authority to make a deed of Gift of the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> cutting off the Entail from his own Postery, then have we been doing wrong in this whole War; and Injuring <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Anjou</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who Claims by the same Title of Gift, had that Gift prior to King <HI>Ch</HI>—, and thereby had the Entail cut off from King <HI>Ch</HI>—, his Gift coming from the Rightful Possessor.</P>
<P>If then King <HI>Charles</HI> II. had no Right at his Death, to will or give the Crown in bar of the Rightful Heirs, who were the House of <HI>Austria;</HI> neither could the Emperor <HI>Joseph,</HI> give from Himself and his Heirs, the same Crown to his Younger Brother, cutting off thereby the En∣tail from his own Children: But on the other hand, If the Emperor had a Rightful Authori∣ty to give, as above, the Crown to his Younger Brother <HI>Ch</HI>—III. himself then alive, and likely to have Children; by the same Parity of Reason King <HI>Ch</HI>—II. of <HI>Spain,</HI> had a Right∣ful Authority to make a Will, and give the Crown to <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Anjou,</HI> in bar of the Claim of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> or any Body else.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44"/>
The matter standing thus, and these Argu∣ments suppos'd to be good, we may say without Offence, that King <HI>Ch</HI>—III. had really no just Claim to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> before, his Elder Brother being then alive.</P>
<P>But if we allow, That the Crown ought to descend Lineally, and cannot by any of the Rightful Heirs be given away, by this we in∣deed are now upon a right foot, That <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Anjou</HI> has no Legal Claim, and the Title and Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> is Legally and Lineally De∣scended to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> whose Head, and Rightful Possessor, is now <HI>Ch</HI>—III. King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>From this Principle however, this Inconve∣nience follows, That no Man can appoint the Succession of <HI>Spain</HI> from King <HI>Ch</HI>—III. nei∣ther can he demit the said Crown in favour of any other, thereby cutting off his own Children or other Heirs, whether Born or to be Born.</P>
<P>By this Doctrine he must be both King and Emperor; but because the World is not at pre∣sent so Nice, and these things may or may not be admitted, we shall put it both ways; and state such Mediums, as that the Powers now to be Establish'd, may not be made a Terror to <HI>Europe,</HI> one way or other: And this is upon the foot of a <HI>Partition,</HI> for it can be no other way.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Son of the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> be declared King of <HI>Spain</HI> to Him and his Heirs, with all the Dominions thereof, except as hereafter, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> or <HI>Spanish-Netherlands,</HI> to be se∣questred to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> as an everlast∣ing Barrier between them; and <HI>France, Dunkirk,</HI> and <HI>Newport</HI> only excepted, to be Restor'd to <HI>England:</HI> On Condition nevertheless that he
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
Marry the late Emperor's Eldest Daughte</P>
<P>The Dutchy of <HI>Millain,</HI> to be added by <HI>Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to the Principality of <HI>Piemont,</HI> and the Dutchie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Mantua</HI> and <HI>Mirandola,</HI> now under seque stration to the Emperor, to be added by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Empire; and these all, <HI>(viz.) Savoy, Piemont Nice, Finall, Montferat, Millain, Mantua,</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣randola,</HI> erected into one Kingdom of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and given to the present Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> with the Title of King, in Reward of his Faithful Servi∣ces to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> and to descend to his other Heirs, and in Default of such Heir, to Prince <HI>Eugeniu.</HI> This would be a Power∣ful Barrier, to keep both the <HI>French</HI> and Im∣perialists always asunder, and both at a distance from the rest of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Legallity of these things, and the custom of giving Kingdoms is exploded, as indeed seems most Reasonable; then a second Alotment may be thus, <HI>viz.</HI> to make King <HI>Charles</HI> both Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as by Title and E∣lection he is like to be; but then to separate their several Dominions, so as that they may not be able to act in Concert to the Terror of <HI>Europe,</HI> as in former Times. <HI>This may be as follows, viz.</HI></P>
<P>That the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> be made King of <HI>Lumbardy as aforesaid,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> Here∣ditary Governor of the <HI>Spanish Low-Countries,</HI> the Royalty of them to remain to the States General.</P>
<P>This making the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> King, and adding those Dominions abovemention'd, has this Effect: That standing between the Domi∣nions of <HI>Spain</HI> and the Empire, it prevents the aforesaid Fatal Conjunction of Power, which
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
<HI>Europe</HI> so much Fears, and has formerly so much Suffer'd under, and is a Kind of Ballance or Umpire between them.</P>
<P>Also if, upon any Future Treaty with <HI>France,</HI> any part of <HI>Italy, Naples,</HI> or <HI>Scicily,</HI> should be Conceded to the said <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Anjou,</HI> the same <HI>Lombardy,</HI> which would then be a very Powerful Kingdom, would be an effectual Barrier both to one and the other, to keep those Powerful Princes of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> or <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> from making <HI>Italy</HI> the Scene of Blood, and the Theater of their Ambition, as in former days it has have been.</P>
<P>These are some Mediums which may be offer'd for the Stating this Difficult matter, and pre∣venting the Evil that <HI>Europe</HI> may have Reason to apprehend from this unexpected Death of the Emperor; as well from the Advantages <HI>France</HI> may take of this general Disorder of <HI>Europe</HI> on this occasion, as of the Injury a too great Accumulation of Power to the House of <HI>Austria</HI> may bring upon us in Ages to come. And that this may not seem too great an Arro∣gance in a private Person, the Author takes leave to Note, that these Schemes are drawn from, and with very little difference, are a faithful Abstract of those Original Drafts, from which the late <HI>Treaty of Partition,</HI> which he had the Honour to see form'd, was after many Consultations and Alterations Conclu∣ded; and which he has still by him to produce.</P>
