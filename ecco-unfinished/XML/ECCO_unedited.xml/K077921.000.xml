<P>THE Author deems it improper to disperse this little local pamphlet by way of presents in order to enlist a party in its favour. He passes it to the public through the common channel of a Bookseller's shop, wishing it only to obtain that notice from the Subscribers to the York Lunatic Asylum which the arguments it contains may deserve.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL not pretend that my motive for giving the subject of this pamphlet so minute an investigation is absolutely dis∣interested; yet I can safely affirm, that if a cause much more laudable were not inti∣mately connected with it, and ultimately dependent upon it, I should never have undertaken so unpleasing a task.</P>
<P>The truth, so far as respects myself, is briefly this:—About six years ago, in order to prevent an Orphan Youth, who had shewn manifest signs of Lunacy, from coming on his parish, which I suspected would neither be willing nor compellable to take such care of him as his deplorable case required, and having, as his malady was recent, some hopes of cure, I sent him to the York Lunatic Asylum. Since that time it has cost me, for his maintenance only, exclusive of his apparel, the sum of above one hundred and twenty pounds. I do not mention this as a charge that would have been exorbitant in a place not originally founded on a chari∣table principle, or greater than I might have
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
incurred by placing him in a private mad∣house, but only as an expence which, I believe, few persons would willingly put themselves to for an individual unconnect∣ed with them by any other tye than that of general humanity; and which, there∣fore, if they had born it for so long a time, and in the end perceived it must yearly encrease, they would surely take any jus∣tifiable means in their power either to lessen in future, or finally to extinguish.</P>
<P>The Orphan in question is in the strict∣est sense of the term a <HI>Lunatic Parish Pau∣per</HI>, withheld hitherto from receiving pay from his Parish only by my interference: Were my assistance, therefore, withdrawn, if not otherwise provided for, he must be re∣turned to the Parish to which he belongs. <Q>Now as it will be fully proved in the fol∣lowing pages, that a weekly payment of eight shillings does and must operate to the utter exclusion of Parish Paupers from the Asylum, a plan which sets out with recom∣mending “that at <HI>no time</HI> the payments ”from the Parish Poor should be reduced" demands, surely, a more pointed animad∣version than I have given it:</Q></P>
<P>For, on a supposition that this unhappy youth should be returned to his parish, the probability is, that they will never be willing to maintain him as I now do, but
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
will instantly try a cheaper experiment: they will take him home to see how he will there behave himself, and, on the very first sign of dangerous phrensy which he may shew, condemn him to a chain in some miserable hut for the remainder of his days, which, from his present strength of constitution, may, perhaps, be prolonged to half a century.</P>
<P>What impresses this fear on my own mind, is a trial which I was advised to make of the state of his intellect, about a year after he had been in the Asylum: I was then told that he was so far recovered that he might be trusted in a country village without a special keeper, where air and working exer∣cise might compleat his cure. With this hope I removed him into a private fami∣ly near York, where, though for a few weeks he behaved himself quietly and coolly, yet in the end, his insanity return∣ing, he was near killing a young child, to whom he had before shewn great tender∣ness and affection. This, as may easily be supposed, determined me to order him immediately back to the Hospital, where he has since remained; and where, though his weekly pay has been lowered from eight to six shillings, yet I think it necessary to aver that it has been lowered without any solicitation on my part, because I have
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
never wished that any partial diminution should be made in my favour; it having been long my settled opinion, <Q>“That as the charitable fund increased, all Poor Patients <HI>of every denomination</HI> should be <HI>equally</HI> relieved by it, in that general proportion which the finances of the ”charity would bear:</Q> To support this principle and another, which like it has the appearance of an axiom, viz. <Q>“That the <HI>original intention</HI> of the subscribers to any charitable institution <HI>ought reli∣giously ”to be adhered to,</HI> are the two capital points aimed at in this publication:</Q> In which, I trust, I have opposed very dif∣ferent principles, in the way of fair and liberal controversy. I am aware that the formal mode of propositions which I have adopted may lay me under the imputation of being prolix and tedious, yet I shall chearfully submit to any thing that may lower my reputation as a Writer, if, as a Man, I prove myself to be, in discussing this subject, a Friend to the Poor and to him that has no Helper.</P>

<PB REF="7"/>
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>TO relieve Lunatic Parish Paupers was a primary intention of the nobility, gentry, and others; and one of their principal motives for entering into a subscription for erecting a Lunatic Asylum at York.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The proof of this proposition will readily result from the very words of the advertise∣ment which first called a meeting for the above Purpose: It is dated York, August 7, 1772; and begins thus: <Q>“Sensible of the deplorable situation of many poor Lunatics, in this ex∣tensive county, who have no other support but what a needy parent can bestow, or a thrifty parish-officer provide, we do, there∣fore, recommend to the public in general, a subscription towards erecting a public Edifice ”for the reception of such unhappy people.</Q></P>
<P>After the gentlemen had met, a second paper was published, entitled <HI>Reasons for the establishing a Lunatic Hospital</HI>, dated the 25th of the same month and year. In which the above reason was still more forcibly expressed, and placed at the head of seven others, in these words: <Q>“1st. It is well known that no particular provision is made by law for Lunatics; the common Parish Work-Houses, and Houses of Correction, being no ways proper for their
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
reception, either in point of accommoda∣tion, ”attendance, or medical assistance.</Q> It is unnecessary to make any farther observations on these two fundamental and declaratory rea∣sons for the establishment of an hospital, than that they were immediately taken from those which the gentlemen of Manchester had before adopted on a similar occasion, though only in part;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The Manchester Account humanely urges an additional rea∣son, that “of desiring to prevent them from continuing public ”spectacles of the deepest misery:</Q> <Q>And also declares “that the Physicians of the Infirmary, and the Surgeons when necessary, ”have generously offered to give their attendance CRATIS.</Q></NOTE> and that they fully establish the truth of this first proposition.</P>
<P>Yet, lest I should be suspected of withholding any other reason from the eye of the public, at present, which was held out to them at the first, I am ready here to state the only two <HI>reasons</HI> which can, in any sort, be put in competition with those which I have adduced: <Q>These then are the 6th and 8th in that paper, the former of which declares “that many families (in no mean cir∣cumstances) through the heavy expence at∣tending the support of one object of this sort, have themselves become the object of charitable relief, and, thereby, doubled the load and loss ”to the public; and the latter, that “the last, but not the least consideration with the pro∣moters of this design is, the assistance that may be given to many persons of <HI>mode∣rate circumstances</HI>, who, labouring under the misfortune of an unsound mind, have no place to retire to but a private madhouse, where their cure stands a great chance of being protracted for the benefit of the
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
mercenary keeper, if ever to be accomplished under the care of one who can lay so small a claim to medical abilities. Those persons or their relations, it is to be hoped, would gladly give the preference to an Asylum under the direction of men of principles and honour, where the patients might expect to meet with the most humane and disinterested treatment; and where they might have a chance of being restored to their health and ”friends, without impairing their fortunes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>These also were copied from the Manchester account, but in that was added, “that in these cases, a moderate fee was to be taken by the trustees for their subsistence, and physician ”for his advice.</Q> This omission, however, was made up for, in a third publication, in a manner, which the person who drew it up might imagine the public would, at the time, think even more disinterested, viz. <Q>“And here it will be proper to remark, that no attending physician or surgeon will receive either see or reward, as long as the hospital continues to receive only paupers or persons in low and indigent circumstances, agreeable to the ORI∣GINAL ”DESIGN of this charity.</Q></P>
<P>The publication, whence this paragraph is taken, is intitled, <HI>An earnest Application to the Humane Public, concerning the present State of the Asylum, erected near York for the Reception of Lu∣natics</HI>. It is dated May 3, 1777, at a time when the building was finished and sitted up to receive patients. <Q>It recapitulates all the former reasons, and declares the intention of the charity to be that “of alleviating the distresses of Lunatics, as well as to remove a
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
heavy and expensive burthen from their ”parishes or families.</Q> <Q>From all this, and from the words of the late Lord Archbishop of York, who first opened the subscription for erecting a suitable building for the reception of Lunatics, “being either PARISH POOR or be∣longing ”to distressed and indigent families," I may, I think, safely affirm, that this proposition is demonstrated.</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The original Intention of the subscribers to that charity, as already specified, is a laudable one.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>This has so glaringly the appearance of an axiom, that I am afraid the generality of my readers will pass it over as an unquestionable truth, and not trouble themselves to read what I have to urge in its proof, which I much wish them to do, because much has previously been written to make it appear absurd. Amongst other things it has been declared <Q>“That to reduce the payments made by parishes, for their insane poor, would open a door for all the idiots, bedridden, diseased, and incurable ”mad paupers in the kingdom.</Q> <Q>It has been also said, that, by so doing, “the house would be immediately filled with the lowest and ”meanest of the poor.</Q> It is, therefore, ab∣solutely incumbent on me, in this place, to vin∣dicate, for the credit of myself, and the rest of my
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
original subscribing brethren, that motive which induced us to subscribe to this charity, and to deny that persons of middling rank and in low circumstances were those for whom the Asy∣lum was PRINCIPALLY intended, however its government may have been hitherto, or may be in future planned. We were all taught to believe, and I may surely answer for one, that all Lunatic Paupers, as being afflicted with this deplorable malady in common, were all equally objects of our benevolence; and the form of the insti∣tution, as already exhibited, intimates no dif∣ference among them. <HI>See Prop.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>But my present business is with <HI>Parish Luna∣tics</HI>, and my present proof must refer only to their separate case; which was humanely con∣sidered, as has been shewn already, to be most truely deplorable, because, 1st. There was no specific law for them; 2d. No other support than what a thrifty parish-officer could pro∣vide; 3d. No better place (supposing the of∣ficer not thrifty) than a common Workhouse or House of Correction; no proper means of accommodation, attendance, or medical assist∣ance; and that, therefore, an hospital found∣ed with a view to supply these wants, would be the best means of relieving these peculi∣arly pitiable objects.</P>
<P>I beg pardon for this tedious recapitulation, which I use only for the sake of pressing the motive home to the peculiar case of these identical paupers. Unless, therefore, some other mode of relief for them can be point∣ed out, as good or better than that of an hospital, I hold the <HI>laudable</HI> intention of the subscribers to be fully proved.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>To relieve parishes from the heavy and ex∣pensive burthen of maintaining their own <HI>Lu∣natic</HI> Poor is defensible.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The incapacity of Parishes to relieve their Lunatic Poor having been thus proved, this seems also to require little discussion; and I shall only remark upon it, That on the sup∣position that a gentleman who originally sub∣scribed to this charity, might have put the case of the Lunatics themselves entirely out of his consideration, and, having landed property, thought he did well in promoting a subscrip∣tion for an hospital, which might be a means of lowering the poor rates of that parish where this property lay, he cannot be arraigned of a want of prudence, or even of generosity, in so doing. For the expence of maintaining a Parish Lunatic, must frequently, if not constantly, be much greater than that of maintaining an idiot, bedridden, diseased, or incurable parish pauper, not afflicted with this additional malady: Such as, perhaps, the building of a particular cell, the constant attendance of a keeper, &amp;c. &amp;c. all which being to be provided in a better manner, and at a smaller expence in an hospital, particularly supported for that purpose, might induce the gentleman, with great propriety, to subscribe to such charity, though he had no farther motives for doing so than those which I have supposed: <Q>And, if he really had no other than these, which have been in∣sinuated
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
to be so selfish “as that the charitable ”spirit of a man must revolt at them, yet, he will, perhaps, be the first to condemn, and with justice too, the proceedings of any indi∣vidual, or body of men, who, acting under the shadow of a committee or general meeting, may promote, or even connive at, proceedings which tend to make the purpose for which he originally subscribed to the charity inefficaci∣ous.</Q> And, if such a man be the first, the rest of the subscribers ought, in justice, to join him in condemning any person or persons whatever, who have prevented his charity from going in the channel, in which, in the first reason given for founding the hospital, he was assured it should go, whatever might be his motive for subscribing to it. He paid, indeed, his money for the relief of his parish, and not for the re∣lief of their Lunatic Pauper, but, knowing that the Lunatic must be relieved, the peculiar parish burthens, incurred in the case of Lunatic Paupers, led him to do it; and those expensive burthens justify him in so doing. I am ready to admit that this reason is not so laudable as that before mentioned: Yet it is a reason which generally operates with the Subscribers to Coun∣ty Infirmaries, especially when they live near to the city or town where such Infirmary is situa∣ted; and I never have heard it called blameable. Parishes also, in a body, by their Overseers, Friendly Societies, and Townships are frequent∣ly subscribers to such institutions. A consider∣ation, this, which I would wish the Reader to keep in view, as it tends to shew, that none of these charitable foundations have ever thought of adopting that distinction, which the York
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
Lunatic Asylum has, relative to parochial and other poor patients. Though not so laudable, therefore, his action is at the least defensible.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The opinion that <HI>Lunatic Parish Paupers</HI> are <HI>LESS</HI> the object of the public charity of an Asylum than any other Lunatic Paupers, is fallacious.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>This being the proposition to support which the former were chiefly adduced and proved, it may be necessary to enlarge somewhat more upon it.</P>
<P>There is no fallacy so difficult of detection as that which has interwoven itself, for a length of time, with a generally received truth. Yet, like ivy, misseltoe, or any other <HI>parasitical</HI> plant, as the botanists call them, if it can be lopped off from the stem it creeps about or roots itself in, that stem will be likely to thrive the better for the separation. I shall proceed, therefore, here to separate this opinion from that truth with which it has been entangled, and prove it fallacious in the following man∣ner:</P>
<P>The inefficacy of attempting to relieve com∣mon Parish Paupers, either by bequest or other similar gifts, I admit in general as a truth.</P>
<P>The inefficacy of attempting a like relief to Lunatic Parish Paupers, I deny as a falshood.</P>
<P>The reason why I admit the first as a <HI>general</HI> truth is, that to relieve the common Parish Pau∣pers,
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
is to relieve the more opulent men of the parish, and to reduce their poor rates without essentially assisting the indigent individuals themselves.</P>
<P>The reason why I deny the second as a fals∣hood, is that the first, second, and even third Propositions prove the deplorable state of the Lunatic poor of a parish to be very dissimilar to the other, and that, therefore, the inefficacy of attempting to relieve them is a falshood, which, though interwoven with a truth, ought to be carefully separated from it. The defenders of this fallacy may, if they please, accept of the fol∣lowing syllogism for their defence till they can frame a better:
<Q><L>To relieve Parish Paupers is to relieve Parishes:</L>
<L>But Parish Paupers may be Lunatics:</L>
<L>Therefore, to relieve Lunatic Parish Paupers, is to relieve Parishes.</L></Q></P>
<P>To which I will only oppose the authority of the original institution, which says, that Parish Paupers who are Lunatics ought to be relieved, because a thrifty parish-officer cannot relieve them properly;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See first advertisement in the first Proposition.</NOTE> and that in as much as there is no better receptacle for them than a Parish Workhouse or House of Correction, where their treatment must necessarily be improper, an Hospital shall therefore be built by subscription, for the reception of such unhappy people. Is this then no relief to Lunatic Parish Paupers, or in relieving them, is it only a relief to their re∣spective Parishes?</P>
<P>On thus confronting the arguments, the ab∣surdity of affirming that to relieve Parish Pau∣pers is <HI>universally</HI> to relieve Parishes <HI>only</HI> will
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
clearly appear. But as the defender or abettors of this error, will not easily be put to silence by confutation, it will be replied to me, that, if you have proved Lunatic Parish Paupers proper objects of this charity, you have not proved them to be more so than persons of low and indigent circumstances.</P>
<P>My first answer to this is, that the Proposi∣tion does not go so far.</P>
<P>My second, that, if it did, it would be capable of proof; and this, from the much worse situa∣tion of a Lunatic Parish Pauper than that of a common Lunatic, which is already proved;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proposition 1 and 2.</NOTE> for is not such a deplorable object likely to be taken more tender care of by a needy parent than a thrifty parish-officer? Are not even the poorest cottages more likely to afford him a quiet residence than a public Workhouse or House of Correction? Where Lunacy is con∣cerned, it is the case of the individual Lunatic, and not of the parish-officer or parent, that is the object of the charity.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Proposition 2.</NOTE> Let the parish or parent be unable to maintain him, the one for want of proper accommodation, the other for want of pecuniary assistance; is he less a Lunatic on either supposition? <Q>Am I asked then “are persons in low and indigent circum∣stances, who have a Lunatic to maintain, not to be preferred in this charity before parishes ”in the same situation?</Q> I answer, No! be∣cause the care that parishes can give to such an object is as inadequate to his accommodation, maintenance and cure, as the care of relations, indigent and in low circumstances.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Proposition 1, or rather the original advertisement, where Lunatics, as Lunatics, whether they receive pay from the parish or not, are stated as they should be in a state of equality.</NOTE> Were
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
Parishes under a legal necessity to relieve their Lunatic Paupers to the extent of their wants, to afford them medical assistance, and other suitable accommodations, in this case the re∣verse might possibly be the truth; but at pre∣sent, unless their Lunacy extend to outrage and danger, their Parishes are under no obliga∣tion to maintain them but as ordinary Paupers. Surely I am now released from the trouble of using more words to prove this Proposition true.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Government of the Asylum has hitherto proceeded on that principle or opinion which has just now been proved fallacious.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I should have thought it necessary to have had recourse to the books of the Asylum, and to have taken extracts from them, in order to establish this fact, if the Physician to that Hospital had not laid me under a particular obligation to him for saving me the trouble, by his having printed a plan for the future management or it, and accompanied that plan with farther observations; by which means he has furnished me with documents, amply suf∣ficient for my present purpose.</P>
<P><Q>In the plan he has declared himself con∣vinced, “that, <HI>at no time</HI>, the payments from
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
the Parish Poor should be reduced, as under such an alteration the house would be imme∣diately, and most pressingly, filled with the lowest and meanest of the poor, to the exclu∣sion of those of a middling rank and in low circumstances, for whom the Asylum was <HI>principally constructed</HI>, and its government ”planned.</Q> And again, <Q>“This <HI>I</HI> have <HI>ever</HI> considered as the spirit of the institution, and <HI>I</HI> have invariably conducted it upon that ”plan.</Q> He has next used the terms of per∣sons of <HI>superior</HI> condition, and of <HI>affluent</HI> cir∣cumstances, which are not to be found in any of the reasons first given for promoting the original subscription, no other denomination of patients being there to be found save that of <HI>parish</HI> Lunatics, <HI>poor</HI> Lunatics, and Lunatics <HI>in low, middling</HI>, or <HI>moderate</HI> circumstances.</P>
<P><Q>In the subsequent letter, written in farther explanation of this plan, he has said what al∣ready has been quoted,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Proposition 2.</NOTE> and has added “that to persons in low circumstances or in a mid∣dling rank of life the York Asylum has been ”a charity indeed! whence I might infer, that to Parish Lunatics it has been no charity in∣deed! but I withhold the inference:</Q> My pre∣sent business being only to prove that he has made a distinction which the original intention of the institution will not justify.</P>
<P><Q>Again, he has said, “the charitable spirit of a ”man revolts when those sufferers" (viz. per∣sons in low and indigent circumstances) “are to have their expences increased, because ”parishes are to be relieved.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Lastly, he has condescended to admit, “that
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
should the fund of the Asylum increase much beyond its expenditure, then let parishes be re∣lieved; but, till then, let the real poor experi∣ence ”the full effect of this charity.</Q> From hence I might also infer, that the Parish Lunatic is not a real pauper, but though the term is thus shifted from <HI>him</HI> to the <HI>parish</HI>, yet the reader will now of himself readily set that matter right; and to draw inferences, I have already said, would be here out of place.</P>
<P>These quotations being in his own identical words, and fully expressive of his own meaning, it would be very disingenuous to suppose that he intended, by them, to contradict that opinion, on which the Government of the Asylum has hitherto proceeded, and on which he wishes it still to proceed. He certainly did not mean it. That opinion has, by the former Proposition, been proved to be fallacious. He speaks the sense of the Government of the Asylum. This truth, therefore, is proved without the ne∣cessity of having recourse to the orders, &amp;c. in∣serted in the Hospital books.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The present weekly payment required of Parishes for their respective Lunatic Poor has hitherto operated, and, if not lessened, must for ever operate, to the exclusion of those miserable objects from the common benefit intended them by the original institution of the charity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>It has already been more than sufficiently
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
proved, that Lunatic Parish Paupers were the primary object of the charity:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Proposition 1, 2.</NOTE> It has also been shewn, with the same force of argu∣ment, that they were at least equal, if not greater, objects of it than any other insane per∣sons,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Proposition 4.</NOTE> and that to relieve Parishes from the great burthen of maintaining them, was a mo∣tive, in itself, defensible.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Proposition 3.</NOTE> Now if the expence to Parishes, on sending their insane poor to this Hospital, may, in many cases, exceed the ex∣pence of maintaining a common pauper of sane mind at home, (however diseased in body) in a twofold or threefold proportion, is it likely that a thrifty parish officer should ever volun∣tarily expend such an additional sum? Will he not rather defer advancing it to the last possible moment? And having no proper means of ac∣commodation, attendance, or medical assistance, may he not protract his stay in the Workhouse till that dreadful disorder has, by time, increased so as to become incurable; which, if properly attended to at its first symptoms, might, perhaps, have been perfectly cured.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It is my own opinion, that <HI>recent</HI> Lunacy stands most in need of medical assistance, and that it is very seldom cured by such assistance when it is <HI>confirmed</HI> or <HI>of long duration;</HI> but this I humbly submit to the better judgment of the faculty.</NOTE> But break we off from this hypothetical, yet surely probable mode of reasoning, and let us confirm the truth of the Proposition by the following short matter of fact, viz. That at this present moment, after a series of ten years, during which time the Asylum has opened its arms to embrace every insane person <HI>in the kingdom</HI>, there are now only
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
<HI>five</HI> confessedly Parish Paupers on the <HI>Calendar:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It may be here necessary to observe, that an advertisement was inserted in the York Courant, dated Sept. 12, 1772, directed “to all the Constables, Churchwardens, and Overseers of the ”Poor, <HI>within the county or precinct of York,</HI> and requesting “some one of them to transmit on or before the 9th of the fol∣lowing November, an account of the number of persons who by Lunacy or otherwise were then furiously mad within, be∣longing to, claiming settlement in, or becoming chargeable to, their respective Townships, Parishes, &amp;c. &amp;c. and proper ob∣jects ”to be sent to an Hospital, if erected and endowed.</Q> <Q>The purpose of making and publishing this request is in the same ad∣vertisement declared to be “in order to form a better judgment of the real utility of such a charity in this county, or <HI>spacious∣ness</HI> ”of such an edifice, if necessary to be erected.</Q> <Q>By a subse∣quent advertisement, dated Nov. 9, 1772, it appears that “the number of Lunatics returned in the county of York, exceeded ”what was imagined.</Q> <Q>If, therefore, the number of Parish Lu∣natics within the County only, was at that time so great as to exceed expectation, what shall we say to the subsequent manage∣ment of the Hospital, when “confined to no district and extend∣ing ”its arms to every quarter of his Majesty's dominions," <HI>five</HI> individuals only of this description at the present time reap any benefit from a Charity originally so well intended.</Q></NOTE> A name which, when given to such a list, has certainly peculiar propriety with respect to those culprits, who stand convicted of the unpardonable crime of being Parish Lunatics, who rob the low and indigent of their more material relief, and are themselves the lowest and meanest mad paupers in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Were the books of the Asylum examined, and the whole number of names of persons un∣der this predicament, who have been admitted from the beginning, ascertained, this argument might, perhaps, be strengthened by it; but I think it strong enough to support itself. But when we are told, that lowering the terms of admission would serve to introduce the lowest and meanest of the poor, it will follow, that the present weekly payments are exacted with a view to their exclusion, which is the point to be proved.</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>To enable Parishes, by Gift or Contribution, to pay more than the Law will oblige them to, or the Justices of the Peace, at their discretion, will levy upon them, is no fraud.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I use the word fraud here, because it has been in my hearing, used on this very question: But lest my veracity should be doubted on the point, I will only reason upon it as I did in the third Proposition, and prove such assistance defensible. And, to do so, I will put the follow∣ing case: A is a parish Lunatic, whom B, the 'Squire of the Parish, thinks might be cured, or, if a dangerous Lunatic, ought to be confined; C C, the Overseers of the Poor, do not chuse to be at the expence of sending him to the Asylum; B offers to assist them, either out of his own purse, or by raising a contribution among his neighbours, on condition they shall pay two or three shillings weekly to the Asy∣lum, and that the remaining weekly expence shall be defrayed in the manner above specified. In this case A is taken out of the Workhouse, and sent to the Asylum, C C are no further burthened with him than they would be if the Lunatic were only a common pauper. Must I, after this, prove B either not fraudulent, or not defensible?</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In whatever case it can be discovered that either Parish Lunatic Paupers, or those in low and indigent circumstances are maintained in the Asylum, either by individuals in good circum∣stances or by charitable contributions, the weekly pay of these Patients, though under different de∣nominations, ought to be precisely the same.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>It has been said on the opposite side of this question, <Q>“Let not parishes be relieved till those who are real poor experience the full effects ”of this charity:</Q> But it has been shewn in the foregoing case, that parishes may be assisted to relieve their paupers, without specifically being relieved themselves, as an aggregate body of men. So far, therefore, as an individual or a contribution relieves the Lunatic, he is to be considered as not belonging to the parish, but only as a low and indigent Lunatic person.</P>
<P>But, let it also be considered, that there may be a case or cases, in which a person in this latter predicament, who has never received pay from any Parish, may be sent to the Asylum with assistance, exactly like that of the Parish Lunatic, are they not then to be considered in similar circumstances, except indeed that the parish in the one case, pays its legal quota towards his maintenance? But is this a difference wor∣thy of consideration? Let those who think so, re∣turn back to the 3d Proposition: To prove this
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
still more fully, I will produce the following fact:</P>
<P>It was said in a late vindication of the plan before quoted, that the wife of a poor Curate stands now on the Asylum books, at the weekly pay of four shillings. My reflection on first reading this, was, that I would wish it were less, and I have since found that some other persons have not only reflected, but acted on that reflection. I meant to have done so too, but first thought it prudent to send to Mr. Eastburn the Secretary, to know the name and circum∣stances of this poor Curate. The name was given me, and for the circumstances I was re∣ferred to a very respectable Clergyman in York, by whom the payments for the patient in question, were regularly and quarterly paid. He gave me an excellent character of the hus∣band, but could not as a certainty tell me, whe∣ther he was in any manner assisted on this oc∣casion. As that was the principal point to which my enquiries tended, I desired him to write to him for the purpose. He did so immediately, and from his answer which I have lately seen, and which in the plainest and simplest manner exhibits his poverty, gratitude, good sense, and humanity, I learn that he has been for <HI>the most part</HI>, assisted by the gentlemen, &amp;c. of his neigh∣bourhood, in Hampshire; that of their cha∣rity he has now ten pounds in bank, for the maintenance of his wife, and that having some expectation next summer of possessing a lit∣tle estate of about 20l. per annum, he hopes to be able to bear the expence himself; he re∣turns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Proposition.</NOTE>
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
his sincerest thanks to the <HI>Governors</HI> of the Asylum, for the indulgence <HI>they</HI> have shewn him, in taking off another weekly shilling in <HI>their</HI> last quarterly bill, which I find is dated York, January 14, 1788, just nine days after the Physician had made this charitable indulgence of the Governors, for the support of his own cause, first public. An anecdote which to the attentive reader, may perhaps seem somewhat remarkable.</P>
<P>But to apply this case to the proof of the Pro∣position, which can only be done by comparison, I allow it to be truly pitiable, and whether by contribution, or otherwise, worthy of relief; but is that of the Parish Lunatic less so? the Curate's wife and this other person are both Lunatics; neither of them can be supported but by greater benevolence than the parish will shew or the Curate can provide, and both are actually sup∣ported for the most part by such benevolence. The persons who contribute are in affluent cir∣cumstances, both in the real, and the supposed case, neither the Curate or the Parish are so burthened as to exclude the patients:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My Orphan Lunatic, mentioned in the preface, is a case strictly similar.</NOTE> The weekly pay, therefore, of these differently de∣nominated Lunatics, ought to be precisely the same.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It may possibly be objected, that the state of the Parish Lu∣natic is preferable to that of the Individual in low and indigent Circumstances, inasmuch as the parish is compelled by law to contribute to his <HI>maintenance</HI>, though not in such a manner as to secure the benefit of attendance and medical assistance suitable to his peculiarly unhappy situation; whereas the individual may find it difficult, if not impossible, to raise a weekly sum equal to what is allowed by the parish officer, and, consequently, require a greater contribution from the truly humane than the former: To which I answer, that although it possibly may be true in some sew instances, yet it is not sufficient to establish of itself a general rule; but I wish the reader to have recourse to what was admit∣ted as a general truth in Proposition 4, and he will there find, that the prospect of the <HI>Parish</HI> Pauper, merely as such, receiving additional contributions, is very small indeed, when compared with that of the individual unrelieved by any Parish.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="26"/>Having now brought my proofs to such a point as determines the distinction that has been made between Lunatic Parish Paupers and other Lu∣natic Poor, to be worse than nugatory, because subversive of the original intention of the cha∣rity, I might here drop the pen, which has done all that I pledged myself to the public it should do; especially as I am even now not without some glimpse of hope, that, if the Governors (who, it is said, at the next general meeting, are to determine on this important matter) do me the honour to give what I have already written, a previous reading, they will not, as matter of mere compliment afford the Physician's projected Plan, so far at least as Parish Lunatics are concerned in it, their hearty sanc∣tion. Yet, as I am well aware that many specious arguments have been, and may be again brought forward to vindicate the measure; I have, in my own mind, weighed their nature and tendency, and think they may all be re∣duced to three kinds: 1. Arguments drawn from Precedent—2dly, From Necessity—3dly, From Expediency. Of these such as have hither∣to occurred to me, or seem likely hereafter to occur, I shall here take notice of in their order,
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
and this to avoid all future trouble of replica∣tion and rejoinder.</P>
<P N="1">1. As an argument from Precedent, it has been said in a newspaper paragraph, <Q>“A cor∣respondent, who has lately visited St. Luke's Hospital in London, informs us, that no Patients are there kept longer than one year; after which, if not cured, they are either turned out, or put upon the incurable fund, at five shillings per week, where they are kept during life. By a late regulation of that charity, parish poor are not permitted to re∣ceive, as formerly, the benefit of the incurable fund, it being now the intention of the Governors to bestow it only upon those who are in low circumstances, and who pay for themselves. Our correspondent calls this a ”<HI>sensible</HI> and humane alteration.</Q></P>
<P>Here, then, we see the present government of St. Luke's Hospital produced as an argument against what, it was suspected might be said, ought to be the government of the York Lunatic Hospital. But to give any rational efficacy to this and every other argument of the kind, it must be first shewn, that the institutions intend∣ed to be brought into competition are precisely similar; and even if this can be done, what will be the result? Will any of the foregoing Pro∣positions be the less true, because any other Hospi∣tal or Hospitals have acted on different princi∣ples? And, in saying this, I do not think that I impeach the sagacity by which any of these Hospitals is governed. I can easily conceive, though I cannot point them out, many discri∣minations that may arise from situation, insti∣tution, finances, and even charter. All that I pretend to know is, the original institution of
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
the York Hospital, founded by subscription; to that only my reasonings are meant to apply, and I am convinced, that no arguments, drawn from the precedents of other Hospitals, can in any sort affect their application. Were a thousand, therefore, to be produced, instead of this single one, I should dismiss them all in the large, as foreign to the question.</P>
<P N="2">2. But arguments drawn from Necessity re∣quire a different treatment, and shall have a more minute consideration. They must, how∣ever, on this subject, necessarily have their foundation on one, ever to be condemned, Error <HI>in principio</HI>, I mean that inordinate Waste of the Public Money, which was incurred by the purchase of the ground, and that still more enormous expence of the Edifice itself, in which splendour and ostentation were aimed at, where convenience and privacy ought only to have been consulted; and a mansion, which, out of compassion to the unhappy inmates and their friends, ought to have been veiled by a per∣petual shade, was taught to perk itself up with all the effrontery of the villa of a Nabob.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The situation chosen was still more objectionable than any other of those original errors. Ground, I am well informed, might have been purchased, which lay conveniently near the County Infirmary, at a much cheaper rate than was given for that on which the Lunatic Asylum now stan ds. Proximity of place was surely devoutly to be wished, with regard to the two buildings; when Physicians and Surgeons (I write, according to the original notion, in the plural number) who had, from the first opening of the Infirmary, attended there <HI>gratis</HI>, might reasonably be expected to give the Lunatic Hospital the same gratuitous at∣tention: The present great and inconvenient distance of the Hospitals must ever be some obstacle to this, and, we know, it was particularly so at the first; for when the present Physician took it under his immediate direction, he found it convenient to withdraw his medical assistance from the Infirmary, by which that charity sustained a loss which it has still to deplore.</NOTE> For
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
this goodly purpose the original subscription, which was no less than 5690l. was so far exhaust∣ed, that the fund was not then able to finish and furnish the house within, which it had made so unnecessarily pompous without. This, how∣ever, supplies Necessity with her first argument, and affords her premises on which she may argue very justly, that it was impossible, under such circumstances, for the Governors to admit any, even the poorest patients, without a week∣ly payment, which might sufficiently maintain them. To this the subscribers silently assented, and however indignant many of them might just∣ly have been at the wretched waste of their sub∣scription money, yet, finding the evil without im∣mediate redress, they waited patiently till fresh contributions should come in, either by legacy or donation, which might furnish such a fund as would make the building not, what it was now, a place of Lodging and Boarding, but an <HI>Hospital</HI> in the just and usual sense of the term; an Hospital, so far as its circumstances would ad∣mit, such as the County Infirmary had for years been, where patients were, except a small de∣posit in case of burial, admitted <HI>gratis</HI>, and where Physicians and Surgeons also attended <HI>gratis</HI>. Nor was the press idle in flattering them into such a future hope, though at the same time it tacitly (if the press can ever be said to do any∣thing tacitly) laid a foundation for that very different Thing from an Hospital, to which the building was, when matters were ripe for it, in∣tended to be metamorphosed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Proposition 1.</NOTE> For this purpose it was said in the account published May 1777, as a matter proper to remark, <Q>“That no Physi∣cian or Surgeon will receive either see or re∣ward,
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
as long as the Hospital continues to re∣ceive only Paupers or persons in low and in∣digent circumstances, <HI>agreeab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> to the original ”design of this charity.</Q> Here a foundation was laid for receiving fees and rewards when the Hospital should receive affluent patients, <HI>not agreeable</HI> to the original design of this charity. But to return from what, however pertinent, may perhaps be deemed a digression, I answer this palmary argument, drawn from Necessity in the following manner.</P>
<P>I allow it to be very true that the Hospital could not admit patients at the time specified without making them pay not only for their board, lodging, and washing, but even for their very medicines. Yet does it, or can it from hence follow, that they must continue such payment for ever? <Q>No surely, says Necessity, it is not meant that they should; for, Parish Pau∣“pers only excepted, Persons of indigent cir∣cumstances have found the Asylum a charity ”indeed!</Q> Their pay has been in some cases greatly lowered; three, even so low as four shillings per week: But to lower them much more will be impracticable, because this cha∣rity is an establishment without a fund.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the original account of the Asylum for last year, pub∣lished January 1, 1788, which calls that charity expressly <Q>“An ”Establishment <HI>without a Fund.</HI></Q></NOTE> <Q>Here Necessity starts a new argument, which I should be at a loss to answer, did not the paper from which I collect it, inform me, that the Friends of the patients “pay a weekly sum suitable to their abilities, by which means the in∣digent are relieved at the expence of the ”affluent.</Q> Are they so? What, then, can this superabundant expence of the affluent be deem∣ed
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
other than a fund (a precarious one indeed!) for the relief of the indigent? Yet precarious as it may be, it is even now deemed sufficient (if only those reasonable fees which the Physician has been requested to receive, be added to it) not only to pay two annual salaries, amounting in the whole to three hundred pounds, but also suf∣ficient to relieve all indigent paupers, that are at present, or may in future become objects of the charity, Parish Lunatics always only ex∣cepted. How different from this doctrine is that which was held out only five years ago in an advertisement prefixed to a sermon preached for the benefit of the charity, by a relation of the Physician's, and who can hardly be sup∣posed to have written it himself, or have print∣ed it without the Physician's immediate appro∣bation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A sermon preached in 1782, at St. Michael Le Belfrey, by the Rev. Mr. Dealtry.</NOTE> <Q>In this we find it declared, “that the York Lunatic Asylum was erected with a view ”to discourage the lower kind of madhouses.</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">And yet, when to discourage the lower kind of Private Madhouses was here declared to be the purpose of this institu∣tion, it may not be amiss to note, that only two years after, about the end of 1784, a certain person, by name Matthew Wilcoxon, was discharged the house, in which he had for about eight years been a most useful servant. This respectable old man had, for many years before, been in that way of business; he had seen much of the practice of Bethlehem Hospital, had acted under Dr. Monro, and was possest of many of his prescriptions, and for his com∣petent skill, at least in common cases, and still more for his great care and humanity, was patronized by Dr. Dealtry himself, who constantly recommended him, when lunatic cases came before him, even to persons of condition. When the Asy∣lum was nearly finished, this man was consulted concerning it, and, after rectifying many mistakes in the building, brought his own patients into it, and, relinquishing his own private house, became principal manager, keeper, nay, and apothecary too (at least occasionally) for the small annual salary of 40l. Yet, at or about this very time, he was dismissed; and how dismissed? With a pension of 20l. per annum for life, and with leave to take with him such of his own patients as then remained in the house. He is now in his 77th year, but in the full vigor of all his faculties, and except a natural diminution of bodily strength, as competent to super∣intend such an Hospital as ever. He still, in the suburbs of York, keeps a few patients, as many as his neat but small cottage will permit him to keep, and in the greatest order and decency. Many remarks might be made on this anecdote, but I only pro∣pose this single question: Was his dismission the best way of dis∣couraging Private Madhouses?</NOTE>

(For to rival the higher was then, though per∣haps in contemplation, not ripe for avowal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was not till the year 1784 that this avowal was made, and then in terms properly cautious. In the order itself, persons of <HI>better</HI> condition were put in opposition to persons of low con∣dition; when in fact the door was opened to real affluent patients, which as the Physician remarks, was a humane though not quite equitable idea, because for a whole year after such a change, no fees could as of right be taken from persons of this description; this matter was however adjusted at the next General Meeting, since which sees and funds may, if they please, play into one anothers hands, and equity and humanity overlook the game.</NOTE>) <Q>It is further said, “that the present expence to each patient is eight shillings per week, but as soon as a <HI>fund</HI> can be raised by the liberality ”of the public, the payment will be lowered.</Q> It is plain, from hence, that a fund was at least to be hoped for at that period; and it is plain, on the very principles of the Physician's plan, that such a fund is now actually obtained. A fund, from whatever source it arises, is still a fund; and that, surely, which can afford to pay three hundred pounds in salaries, to two per∣sons only, cannot be deemed inconsiderable. But to extinguish this objection at once: The Physician himself has repeatedly called this iden∣tical source a fund.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>“In return for the abolition of sees, I advised, that the pay∣ment of the affluent patients should be increased for the bene∣fit of the general <HI>fund</HI>—and from the fund thus constituted, I recommended an equitable and determinate fum. to be given ”to the Physician for his care and attention.</Q> See Dr. H.'s letter to the Governors of the Lunatic Asylum, Jan. 5, 1788.</NOTE> The fact is, that this charity (supposing it to be at first established without a
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
fund, which is contrary to what the original subscribers expected it would be, who surely did not subscribe for a mere building) has now in possession three different funds; one consist∣ing of money funded; another of the joint do∣nations of the late Dowager Lady Gower, and Mrs. Bourchier;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>Some of my readers, particularly those who have studied the Physician's plan, may blame me for not having more minutely inquired into the nature of the Dowager Lady Gower's donation, especially as in one of the annual accounts, it is said, that it went "towards defraying the expences of the house," while the Phy∣sician's Letter asserts, that, with Mrs. Bourchier's, it was to be ap∣plied “to the benefit of those patients who do not receive any ”Parish relief.</Q> These two accounts of the matter are certainly widely different, but as they could not be reconciled without having recourse to the books of the Asylum, and as the way of argument, which I had prescribed to myself, had more to do with the natural reason of things, than any particular deviation from such reason, I content myself with saying on that subject, by way of argument <HI>a priori</HI>, drawn from her Ladyship's uncommon sagacity and penetration, that it was impossible, had the original institution of the Hospital been fully stated to her, she could have excluded Parish Lunatic Paupers from an equal share of her be∣nevolence. Endued with a strength of understanding beyond the majority of her own or the other sex, and with a liberality of sen∣timent, resulting from that understanding, this excellent woman despised every thing that was trivial or partial in the distribution of that great charitable sum which devolved to her from her ances∣tor. This I say from personal conviction, for as she, for many years, honoured me with her friendship, so let me boast, that she made me, not unfrequently, her almoner; knowing, therefore, by this means, how coolly she deliberated, before she dispensed her bounty, I can pronounce, to a certainty, that imperfect information, and that alone could ever have turned her charity from the right channel; of misapprehension, her supreme judgment rendered her incapable. This true eulogium of the late Lady Gow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, I could wish might be circulated beyond the limits of so local a publication as the present, from the very nature of its subject, must unquestionably be.</NOTE> and a third arising from the fees and weekly payments of the affluent already specified, besides what is in Bankers hands for additional buildings. As to the incorporation and future direction of these three funds, are they not written in the plan and letters of the Phy∣sician? to which I refer such of my readers as
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
may be endued with a capacity to comprehend them. For myself, I only pretend to know, that, however they may be hereafter <HI>incor∣porated</HI>, their first immediate direction should be towards the general decrease of the present weekly pay of <HI>every</HI> poor patient in the Hospi∣tal. Such pitiful and partial lowering of cer∣tain individuals, as has hitherto taken place, and of which instances have been produced, will never vindicate the measure either of fees or salaries. The pay of the Parish Lunatics in par∣ticular ought to be so far lessened, that parishes may be prompted to send in their Lunatics as a matter of choice; for, without this, as there unfortunately subsists no law to compel them, it is evident they will never send them in that early stage of the disease, when alone a cure can reasonably be expected. <Q>In one word, making use of a sensible expression of the Trustees of the Manchester Infirmary, it is, with me, a matter of <HI>no</HI> doubt, “whether an Hospital may de∣serve that name, into which none can be ad∣mitted without paying, in some measure, for ”their maintenance.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of the Manchester Lunatic Hospitali 1771, page 8.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Turning now from the argument of Necessity, I proceed to consider some of the pleas of Expe∣diency. <Q>The following comes clearly under this description, “that to reduce the payment made by the parishes for their insane poor would open a door for the entrance of all the idiots, bedridden, diseased, and incurable mad pau∣pers ”in the kingdom.</Q> It is, therefore, if true, certainly inexpedient that such a door should be opened. This argument, though before occasionally quoted, shall now be more minute∣ly
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
considered; and as different descriptions of persons are here enumerated, I shall consider each in their order.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Idiots</HI>, as they are not mentioned as one of the original objects of this charity, may, for that very reason, be excluded from it. I have been told, indeed, that the expediency of their admission has been occasionally debated; but I enter not into such debate. I only intimate, as my own private sentiment, that could these very pitiable objects receive the benefit of this, or any other charitable place of reception, I would gladly, either by annual subscription or otherwise, contribute towards their mainte∣nance, in order that they might be removed from the public eye, and prevented from continuing spectacles of the deepest misery. The public spirited Dean of St. Patrick's, we know founded an Hospital, for fools as well as mad, which has lasted more than ten years thrice told without any deviation from its pri∣mary institution: And were any additional building to the York Asylum projected for the separate reception of Idiots, I am perswaded it would meet the wishes, and receive the dona∣tions of many benevolent Christians. For, tired as many of them may be, of contributing to some public charities on account of their ma∣nifold perversions, yet they would reflect that a charity of this kind is less likely to be per∣verted (in certain respects) than any other. For, as in the case of Idiots, medical assistance cannot possibly be much wanted, fees and salaries to Physicians and Apothecaries can never be obtruded.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of <HI>Bedridden</HI> Parish Lunatics, I cannot suspect that many of them would be forced up∣on
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
the Asylum, because the very term implies— that they have lost either the power of motion, entirely, or so nearly, as to be no very dangerous or improper inmates of a common Workhouse. But suppose the contrary, a single resolution, or order of the general meeting, provided it does not counteract the original intention, would effectually preclude even an attempt to send them from neighbouring parishes; and is it to be be∣lieved, that the expence of their journey would not of itself deter those at a greater distance from making so unprofitable an attempt?</P>
<P N="3">3. But where <HI>disease</HI>, either acute or chroni∣cal, is superadded to so deplorable a malady as Lunacy, I must own I look upon this as a reason <HI>a fortiori</HI> for the admission of such peculiarly unhappy objects into every Lunatic Hospital: Nor can there be any conceivable reason against it, except in a case where that Hospital may be under the sole direction of a Physician incapable of curing any other disease but Lunacy.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let me now consider the last species of these desperate invaders—the <HI>Incurable</HI> Mad Paupers. Here as the epithet <HI>Mad</HI> seems to be put emphatically, I am at a loss to determine its precise signification. If it means incurable Lunacy without intervals, I have only to sup∣pose, that persons of superior condition, as well as absolute parish paupers, may be afflicted with the very same state of phrenzy, and therefore, in justice, they ought both to be excluded equal∣ly, which, I fear, may hereafter tend to make the newly invented fund still more precarious.</P>
<P>But, says Expediency, it is from the num∣bers, not the species of Lunatics, coming from all parts of the kingdom that this danger is to be apprehended. My answer to this will be
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
given merely by repeating what I have already said in the case of Bedridden Patients. An or∣der, as exigency may prompt, from the gene∣ral meeting will effectually prevent this. Or∣ders of this kind have already done matters full as peremptory and absolute: They have, contrary to the intent of the original subscri∣bers, opened the arms of the Hospital to em∣brace more than the county of York, even every Lunatic in his Majesty's dominions;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>In the year 1777, at a general meeting of the subscribers, it was, for the first time, resolved, that patients from other parts of the kingdom should be admissible into the Hospital; this per∣mission, however, was not without its limitations, for the order is “that the Asylum be deemed <HI>An Establishment for the County of York</HI>, with liberty to the Governors to admit patients from ”other counties or places, <HI>on extraordinary occasions.</HI></Q> A ma∣nifest preference is here reserved to this county—Notwithstand∣ing which, the Parish Lunatics of the county of York are now obliged to surrender <HI>their establishm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt</HI>, and give way to Luna∣tics in low, and perhaps in affluent, circumstances. It may not be amiss in this place to observe, that so soon as this <HI>limited</HI> order was made, the liberality of the Asylum in opening its arms to re∣ceive all the Lunatics in the British Empire was constantly boasted in every annual account of the State of the Hospital; but it has never till now been questioned whether these <HI>metaphorical</HI> arms must not of necessity be confined within those <HI>unmetaphorical</HI> and solid out walls of brick, which include the apartments within them. Will these dilate themselves for a purpose of such magnitude? In other Hospitals, when all the apartments are filled, it is the usual, and, indeed, necessary practice to refuse new inmates till vacan∣cies happen; and if the county of York be able to fill them with its own Lunatics, the occasion must be very extraordinary, indeed, which should take from it the preference which this or∣der gives.</NOTE> they have requested the Physician to take fees, before the weekly payment of the poorer patients were uniformly and effectually lowered;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I presume to notice this, although the signature of an Arch∣bishop is affixed to the order to which I allude. Yet when I consider that his Grace was not promoted to the see of York till five years after the first proposals for erecting the Hospital issued, it is probable, that, when he signed that order, he might not have had so perfect a conception of the original institution of the charity, as I flatter myself he will have, if he does me the honour to glance his eye over these few Pages.</NOTE> nay, they
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
have appointed one Physician in exclusion of all others, without ever condescending to en∣quire whether the rest of the York practising Physicians would, as they have long done at the County Infirmary, attend the Asylum <HI>gratis</HI>.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is only an inference from the state of the Hospital, and the claim of a salary to <HI>the</HI> Physician, whom we must, therefore, suppose to have some unpublished appointment in his hands, for otherwise it is not to be imagined that he would in his plan assume this exclusive character. <Q>In March, 1774, the general meeting appointed a committee, to consist of subscribers of 20l. “together ”with the practising Physicians in York, and to that very meeting a scheme, for the Conduct of the Hospital, was returned under the signatures of Dr. Hunter, Dr. Swainston, Dr. Withers, and the late Dr. Wallis:</Q> Salaries are there recommended, under the name of Wages to the Servants of the Hospital; and for the house Apothecary, on a supposition of fifty-four patients at 6s. per week, the annual sum of 50l. is deemed sufficient, but no syllable appears respecting <HI>the</HI> Physician's Wages, nor have we been able since to find any authorized dismissal of the other prac∣tising Physicians from their gratuitous attendance upon the un∣happy inmates of this <HI>quondam</HI> charity.</NOTE> This, surely, is sufficient to satisfy Expediency on this plea.</P>
<P>But she will not be satisfied so easily; she has a certain argument still in reserve, which I will venture to bring forward; but without chusing to confute it: <Q>It is this, “the too ge∣neral admittance of the meanest of mankind will be the strongest obstacle to the frequent admittance of persons of superior condition, from whom only the fund for salaries is to be ”expected.</Q> People of superior condition, when sane, we know, are not very fond of mixing with their inferiors—insanity, indeed, may possibly take away the power of making the distinction; but putting themselves out of the question, their friends and relations, who must also be supposed persons of superior con∣dition, will probably have an equal reluctancy. And, I own, since I first became acquainted
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
with the change made in 1774, tending to the admission of affluent patients, I have fre∣quently thought that the name of Asylum came too near to the idea of an Hospital, to make it well relished by persons of superior condition, and, therefore, have thought that now it ought to have a new appellative, and be denominated
<Q>THE LUNATIC HOTEL;</Q>
which would effectually remove all prejudices of that kind: Yet I humbly submit the idea to those whom it may most concern. For my∣self, I am perfectly convinced, that unless this argument be permitted to operate in its full extent, and to the utter exclusion of Parish Paupers, no certain salary <HI>in perpetuo</HI> can be secured to the Physician's successors, for whom and for whom solely, I am convinced he has relinquished his fees for one whole year, and thrown them into the general fund, by way of Experiment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fees from the poor are disavowed, and there is no ground to believe the Governors ever meant the Physician to have them; from whom, then, are they to arise? from the rich inmates of an Hospital! If, therefore, from these, fees are to arise, it is a private matter between the Physician and the friends of the rich, and should not be transferred to the trust, which ought not, surely, to incumber itself with any such trans∣fer.</NOTE> I have it in doubt, I must own, whether an experiment of one year, or even of ten, may be so decisive in this point, as to afford sufficient <HI>data</HI> for the governors to found a resolution upon which is to operate so long as the building is inhabited: So long, indeed, as a Physician of superior eminence in his profes∣sion (as at present) attends Lunatics of superior condition, I have not a fear of its success; but a successor not possessing that superior skill, may
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
cause a decrease in the number of affluent pa∣tients; and when I further consider that this successor, on account of that considerable salary annexed to his office, cannot be nominated with∣out a previous election, it is to be suspected, that the ideas of Whig and Tory, or some similar party distinctions at the time, may operate more on the minds of the electors with respect to the qualifications of the several candidates than medical skill and antimaniacal science. The consequence then, must certainly be, that, af∣fluent patients becoming less numerous, the fund, in a few years, will become too small to pay even the Apothecary's pension, much less that of the Physician. If, then, that Physician be not either able or willing to make a sacrifice of his salary, the poorer species of Lunatics (if, at the time, any should be found in the Place) must be lost to all medical assistance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>On this account, I am inclined to agree in opinion with one of Dr. Hunter's respectable correspondents “that instead of the intended new erection, and in lieu of salary for the Physician, ”a small house (I would rather have it a large one) “should be built for the reception of a few patients of better condition. This to be at the disposal of the Physician, he paying a rent ”for it, and finding his own servants and all family expences.</Q> (See Dr. Hunter's second Letter, second edition folio, for it is not in the first, which was published in the newspapers) and I am the more inclined to favour this ingenious idea, because it is the quickest way of building a private Madhouse, with money that apparently belongs to nobody, and which, to the amount of 1176l. 18s. 11½d. lies now in the Banker's hands. But my chief partiality to this scheme is, that it will prevent the Asylum from changing its name, and be itself, with still more propriety, called the LUNATIC HOTEL FOR PERSONS OF CONDI∣TION <HI>only</HI>.</NOTE></P>
<P>Having now considered all the principal pleas that either have been, or may probably be urged by Necessity or Expediency, in order to defend that great deviation from the original design of the Hospital, which has, by degrees,
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
taken place in its conduct, I will conclude in the following hypothetical manner.</P>
<P>Suppose then, my impartial and unprejudiced reader! that when that original advertisement was drawn up, which has been quoted in my first Proposition, one in the following terms had been published in its stead.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="advertisement">
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Sensible that persons in affluent circumstances and of superior condition might keep their relations or friends, who have the misfortune to be disordered in their senses, at a much cheaper rate than they can now do in any place of private confinement in the king∣dom; we, the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy of the county of York, propose to enter into a voluntary sub∣scription towards erecting a very elegant building for that purpose, and to furnish and fit up the same in the most commodious manner, not only for themselves, but their servants, where, under the care of an experienced salaried Physician, a man of principles and honour they will be sure of the best medical assistance, and the most polite and humane treatment, suitable to their rank and condition. And we further propose, that after the ground is bought and the building erected, the residue of the subscription money shall be vested in the public funds for the purpose of repairing, refur∣nishing, and adding more commodious buildings in ad∣dition to the same, as affluent patients may encrease, or other exigencies require: And we hereby assure the public, that this, our voluntary generosity, does not mean to confine itself to the county (however exten∣sive) to which we belong, but will extend itself to every quarter of his Majesty's dominions. It is, there∣fore, earnestly requested, that such Yorkshire Noble∣men, &amp;c. as are desirous of promoting an institution so highly beneficial to the affluent, though unhappy part
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
of the nation, would meet at the Castle of York, on Friday in the Race Week, Aug. <HI>1772</HI>, to consider of proper means for putting the same in execution, and of opening a subscription for so laudable a purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Had this advertisement, I say, appeared in∣stead of that which did then appear, is it likely (let me ask my reader) that the sum of two thousand five hundred pounds would have been immediately subscribed, or that, in the space of five years more, it would have been augmented to five thousand six hundred and ninety? I per∣ceive myself answered by a short negative. The subscription, I agree with him, must have pro∣ceeded but slowly: Let us consider, therefore, whether another advertisement like the follow∣ing might not have helped it forward.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="advertisement">
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>To add to our generosity the stimulant of a proper degree of charity, we, the aforesaid Nobility and Gentry, finding that certain futile objections were made to our former advertisement, which rather im∣peded our generous and disinterested design, do now further propose, that persons of moderate condition and midling fortunes may also be admitted as patients with those in affluent circumstances, provided that they also pay such reasonable fees to the Physician, and such weekly pay for board &amp;c. &amp;c. as their several circumstances may permit: Nay, we even condescend to admit into it low and indigent persons, (provided they come not under the denomination of Parish Paupers) and this at the small sum of eight shillings per week, which also may be lowered at the discretion of the Physician and Governors, or of the Physician only, in cases which he may judge most for the good of the charity: But because Parish Paupers are confessedly the meanest of mankind, and as the intended building will be constructed chiefly for the
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
accommodation of persons of superior condition, it is obvious that these Mad Paupers must be excluded, by putting their terms of admission so high as effectually to bar their ingress to the Asylum.</P>
<P><HI>Whether even this more enlarged plan would have so far forwarded the subscription, as even to have raised money sufficient to buy the ground for the building to stand upon, I suspect, will be almost universally doubted. Why then (says my reader, now, perhaps, become indig∣nant) fabricate two such improbable advertise∣ments? My answer is, that, however improba∣ble, or even absurd they may appear, the latter advertisement gives a very precise idea of what the Government of the Asylum NOW IS, even before the Physician's projected plan of salary takes place; how far the former delineates what it will THEN BE I leave to future investigators to determine.</HI></P>
