<BYLINE>SPOKEN BY MR. PALMER.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>A FARMER late, (so country records say)</L>
<L>From the next market homewards took his way;</L>
<L>When as the bleak unshelter'd heath he cross'd,</L>
<L>Fast bound by winter in obdurate frost,</L>
<L>The driving snow-storm smote him in his course,</L>
<L>High blow'd the North, and rag'd in all its force;</L>
<L>Slow-pac'd and full of years, th' unequal strife</L>
<L>Long time he held, and struggled hard for life;</L>
<L>Vanquish'd at length, benumb'd in every part,</L>
<L>The very life-blood curdling at his heart,</L>
<L>Torpid he stood, in frozen fetters bound,</L>
<L>Doz'd, reel'd and dropt expiring to the ground.</L>
<L>Haply his dog, by wondrous instinct fraught</L>
<L>With all the reas'ning attributes of thought,</L>
<L>Saw his sad state, and to his dying breast</L>
<L>Close cowr'ing, his devoted body press'd;</L>
<L>Then howl'd amain for help, till passing near,</L>
<L>Some charitable rustic lent an ear,</L>
<L>Rais'd him from earth, recall'd his flitting breath,</L>
<L>And snatch'd him from the icy arms of death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when the chilling blast of secret woe</L>
<L>Checks the soul's genial current in it's slow—</L>
<L>When death-like lethargy arrests the mind,</L>
<L>Till man forgets all feeling for his kind,</L>
<L>To his cold heart the friendly Muse can giv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>Warmth and a pulse that forces him to live;</L>
<L>By the sweet magic of her scene beguile,</L>
<L>And bend his rigid muscles to a smile,</L>
<L>Shake his stern breast with sympathetic fears,</L>
<L>And make his frozen eye-lids melt in tears,</L>
<L>Pursuing still her life-restoring plan,</L>
<L>Till he perceives and owns himself a man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Warm'd with these hopes, this night we make appeal</L>
<L>To British hearts—for they are hearts that feel.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WEAZEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>WAS ever gentle traveller, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince the days of Ro∣binson Crusoe, so put to his shifts, as I Timothy Weazel, Attorney at law? I have lost my guide, my guide has lost himself, and my horse has ab∣sconded, with bridle, saddle, and all his shoes, save one he left behind him in a slough. I saw a fellow setting springs for woodcocks, and show'd him sig∣nals of distress; but the carle ran off at the sight of me, and vanish'd like a Jack O'lantern. If I under∣stood the language of birds, there is not one within call to answer to a question; the creatures have got wings, and are too wise to stay in such a place.—Hold, hold! I see a hut, or a hovel, or a Laplan∣der's lodge, behind these trees; and here comes one hobbling upon two shanks and a crutch, a proper sample of the soil she withers in—Holloa! Dame,
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
do you hear? Give me a word with you, if your senses can afford it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Dame <HI>DUNCKLEY</HI> enters.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you have with me? What is your business here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your'e right, it must be business; no∣body would come here for pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor is this a house of call for tra∣vellers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can believe, if you are the re∣presentative of it; that is, as I may say, <HI>luce cla∣rius.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no such person here, so you may go your ways, before my master sends you packing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a master, have you? Call him out then, and let him direct me in my road to Roderick Penruddock, Esquire, and I'll reward him for his pains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll reward my master! Saucy com∣panion! If Roderick Penruddock is the gentleman you want, you need not go any further—there he lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you lie, I believe. Penruddock in that cottage!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? Will you face me out, who have liv'd with him these twenty years? And what if it be but a cottage? Content is every thing; my good master is not proud.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Melancholy, I shou'd think, if a con∣stant memorandum of mortality can make him so.—He was cross'd in love in his younger days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I know nothink of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say you was in the fault of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a man of few words, to be sure; but then he has a world of learning in his head; everlastingly at his books.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he at 'em now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deep, not to be approach'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And alone?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure: I never disturb him in his hours of study; at every other time he's kind and gentle as the dew of heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What am I to do then, who have come some hundred miles upon his business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ev'n what you please, Sir. I'm sure it is no business of mine, and I'll have nothing to do with it. <STAGE>[Steps aside.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if he will not welcome the good news I bring him, he must be a philosopher indeed. I'll begin my approaches cautiously, however—the door is fast—I'll touch it tenderly.—Within there! Who's at home?—Silence and famine, I shou'd guess, for nothing stirs.</P>

<P>Not yet? This will never do. Good fortune may be warranted to rap a little louder.—What, hoa! Within, I say!—Will nobody hear me?</P>

<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear you. What is it you want?</P>

<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your leave, I want a few words with you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Send 'em in at the window then, and the fewer the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I bring you news out of Cornwall; news of great consequence.</P>

<P>Who are you, and what are you?</P>

<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a surly humor; here's a pretty freak of Fortune, to pile bags of money on the back o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an ass, who only kicks against the burthen; I warrant, if the sky rain'd gold, this churl would not hold out his dish to catch it; but we shall soon see what stuff his philosophy is made of; good chance
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
if I don't shake his metaphysics out of him ere long. O ho! I've bol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed him, however.—Zooks! What a heathen philosopher it is.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>PENRUDDOCK <HI>appears.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Mr. Attorney, what have you to say, for thus disturbing my whole family? What have I done, or the poor cat, my peaceable com∣panion, that thus the boisterous knuckles of the law shou'd mar our meditations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sir, I was compell'd to make some little noise; your castle is but small—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Its big enough for my ambition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And passing solitary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you had suffer'd it to be silent too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>In saith, Sir, if I knew how to be heard without a sound, I would gratify your wish; but if your silence suffers by my news, I hope your happi∣ness will not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happiness! What's that? I am content, I enjoy tranquillity; Heaven be thank'd, I have nothing to do with happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you are beyond me, Sir. If an humble fortune and this poor cottage give you con∣tent, perhaps great riches and a splendid house wou'd not add to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain your meaning, friend: I don't understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>In plain words, then, you are to know, that your rich relation, Sir George Penruddock, is deceas'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dead!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Desunct; gone to his ancestors; whipp'd away by the sudden stroke of an apoplexy; this mo∣ment here, Heaven knows where the next: Death will do it when he likes, and how he likes; I need not remind you, Sir, who are so learned a philoso∣pher, how frail the tenure of mortality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not, indeed: If Sir George thought as seriously of death before it happened, it
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
may have been well for him; but his thoughts, I fear, were otherwise employed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I much doubt if he ever thought at all; he was a fine gentleman, and liv'd freely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>No wonder then he died suddenly—but how does this apply to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No otherwise than as you are the heir of every thing he possess'd: I have the will in safe keeping about me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have patience; this is somewhat sudden; I am unprepar'd for such an event; 'twas never in my contemplation: I was in no habits with Sir George, never courted him, never corresponded with him; the small annuity, 'tis true, on which I have subsisted, was charg'd on his estate, and re∣gularly paid, but here he never came; man cou'd not be more opposite to man; he worshipp'd For∣tune, I despis'd her; I studied closely, he gam'd in∣cessantly—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And won abundantly—if money be your passion, you'll find plenty of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shou'd I do with money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Money indeed!—why money is—in short, what is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not health methinks, not life—for he that had it, died.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you that have it, live—and is there nothing that can tempt you? Recollect—books—money will buy books; nay more, it will buy those who write them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>'T will purchase panegyrics, odes, and dedications—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't gainsay it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>House, table, equipage, attendants—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have all those: what else?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir, you surely can't forget there are such things in this world as beauty, love, irre∣sistible woman—</P>
<STAGE>[Dame <HI>DUNCKLEY</HI> crosses the stage.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I keep a woman; she visits me every
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
day, makes my bed, sweeps my house, cooks my dinner, and is seventy years of age—yet I resist her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could say something to that, but I am afraid it will offend you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say on boldly; never fear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Sir, I find you of a very different temper from what I expected: I should doubt if your philosophy has made you insensible; I am sure it has not made you proud.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am as proud in my nature as any man ought to be, but surely as humble as any man can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suffer me then to ask you if there is not a certain lady living, Arabella Woodville by name, whom you once thought irresistible, and who even now perhaps might put your philosophy to a harder trial than the old dame of seventy, who does the drudgery of your cottage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who told you this? how came you thus to strike upon a name, that twenty years of solitude have not effac'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I wou'd prepare you for a task, that with the fortune you inherit must devolve upon you. The interests of this lady, perhaps even her existence, are now in your hands. When I shall deliver the deeds bequeath'd to you by your cousin, I shall arm you with the means of extinguishing the wretched Woodville at a blow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it you tell me? Have a care how you reverse my nature with a word. Wood∣ville in my power! Woodville at my mercy! If there's a man on earth, that can inspire me with revenge, it is that treacherous, base, deceitful rival. I was in his power, for I lov'd him—he betray'd me; I was at his mercy, for I trusted him—he de∣stroy'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weazel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now then you'll own that money can give something, for it gives revenge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come on; my mind is made up to this fortune; to the extremest atom I'll exact it all: the
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
miser's passion seizes on my heart, and money, which I held as dirt, is now my deity.</P>

<P>Harry Woodville, are you in your senses to act in this manner?</P>

<P>Are you not out of yours, to come thus far to ask me such a question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I am, but there's no reasoning about friendship; when I see a fellow, whom I love, throw away his happiness, game away his fortune, and then run from the ruin he has made, I have a foolish nature about me, that in spite of all his phrenzy will run after him; and tho' he may break loose from all the world beside, damn me if he shall shake off me, tho' he had twenty pistols in his reach, and I not one in mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your friendship, Mr. Sydenham, is not wanted at this moment, and give me leave to say it is unwelcome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely; I care little about the wel∣come that you give me, as I am not quite sure you are the man I was in search of: my friend was a gentleman, tho' an unwise one; he would hear rea∣son, though he was unapt to follow it; above all things he was not that frantic desperado, as to turn his pistol either against his servant or himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, my pistol is put up—now what have you to say to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know if I shall say any thing to you; certainly nothing to sooth you. It is not because a man has pistols in his pocket, that he is formidable, or that I should flatter him: every fellow, that has not spirit to face misfortune, may be his own assassin; every wretch, who has lost all feelings of humanity, may commit a murder on his fellow-creature.</P>

<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>Return to your afflicted wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can never do; my home is horri∣ble, nor am I in possession of a home; Penrud∣dock's myrmidons are in my house; besides, there's worse than that, my son is come to England, Henry will be upon me, and to meet his gallant injur'd presence would be worse than death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you had reflected on that horror, whilst there was time to have prevented it.—If fathers, whilst their sons are bleeding in their coun∣try's battles, will hurl the fatal dice and stake their fortunes on the cast, alas for their posterity!</P>

<SP>

<P>Why urge that dreadful truth? You have no son, you are no gamester.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>

<P>I'll tell you that at once—Sir George Penruddock, my chief creditor, is dead; he has be∣queath'd his fortune to his cousin Roderick of that name.

<P>This Roderick and I were school-fellows, studied together at the university, travell'd together thro' most parts of Europe; and were inseparable friends, till by evil chance, we became rivals in love: I obtain'd Mrs. Woodville's hand, and marri∣ed her; he was excluded, and renounced society: This man, the bitterest enemy I have, is now the master of my fate.</P>

<P>I much doubt if any thing can be fair, when one party has just gained a fortune, and the other lost one: however, if you mean it shou'd be fair, take me with you; whether you shake hands or exchange shots, I will see justice done on both sides; for I will be bold to ave<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, there never yet was an affair, in which I had the honour to be either principal or second, where equity was not as strictly administer'd, as if my Lord Chancellor had decreed it from the bench.</P>

<P>This property's immense. Woodville's proud house is mine; now that false friend is punish'd; all those scenes of gay prosperity, with which he caught the vain weak heart of Arabella, are suddenly re∣versed, and just retaliation, not less terrible because so tardy, surprizes him at last. Farewell, my cot∣tage! scene of my past content, I thank thee: pos∣sessing nought but thee, I have not envied palaces; possest of them, I have forsaken thee; such is man's fickle nature, in solitude a philosopher, wise in ad∣versity, and only patient under injuries till opportu¦nity occurs to him of revenging them.</P>

<P>I am Penruddock.</P>
</SP>

<P>I wish I had—You have left some tra∣ces

of it in my memory, Mr. Woodville; and no∣thing is more opposite to my desires than to revive them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>That this would be my greeting I expect∣ed; for tho' I ever knew you to be just, yet, in our earliest years, I thought I cou'd discover dawnings of a relentless nature. If twenty years of calm re∣flection have passed away without assuaging your de∣termin'd animosity, an opportunity is now before you of hatching that revenge which you have brood∣ed on so long.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop, if you please—I am no party in this conference, but as a common friend to every thing that wears the face of man: I can perceive you have been wrong'd, in time long past, by this gentleman; so have I, recently and deeply wrong'd, inasmuch as he has abus'd my friendship, by ruining himself in defiance of my better counsel—What then? he is sorry for it, and I forgive him; he is in misery, and I pity him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, at your remonstrance I will stay; only be pleas'd to let me know for whose sake I submit myself to Mr. Woodville's conversa∣tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a very idle fellow, Sir; Sydenham my name; one that has thrown away much good will upon his friends, without once practising your happy art of being unmov'd by their misfor∣tunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph!—Mr. Woodville will pro∣ceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you, Mr. Penruddock, can find no mo∣tive to forgive the wrongs I did you in the matter of my marriage, I shall suggest none, neither will I offer at one word in mitigation of those wrongs; they were as great as you believe them; greater, perhaps, than you are perfectly apprized of. In the first glow of your resentment you demanded sa∣tisfaction; in justice, I must own that your appeal
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
was warranted, but I was then a happy man, with beauty in my arms, and fortune at my feet, and I evaded it. Now if your heat is not cool'd, and you still thirst for revenge, lo! I am ready; I have arms for both, fit to decide our quarrel, and an honorable friend competent to adjust it.</P>

<P>Give me the pistol: place your man where you like; this is my ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop, Sir, the forms of honor are not yet compleat—Mr. Woodville, if I rightly understood you, you have an alternative to propose: if that be so, state it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have little disposition to bear any trifling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I to trifle; therefore no more of it! A woman's mediation can be of no avail: however, Mr. Sydenham, if I fall, give this to the survivor.</P>
<STAGE>[Presents a pacquet.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! Mrs. Woodville's hand!—this must not be rejected: an angel's mediation claims respect, and he must read it, or make his passage thro' my body, ere he shall approach you.—Woodville, dis∣arm yourself <STAGE>(takes his pistol.)</STAGE>—Mr. Penruddock, this pacquet is address'd to you; take it; but first, if you please, give me your weapon, as he has done.—Now I maintain an armed neutrality.</P>

<STAGE><HI>[PENRUDDOCK</HI> withdraws aside, opens the pacquet, peruses it awhile, and then retires into his Cottage; whilst this is passing, <HI>SY∣DENHAM</HI> speaks as follows.</STAGE>

<P>It staggers him—he pauses; yet I per∣ceive no change—he flies however, and we keep the field.—Do you know the purport of that paper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing of its purport but by con∣jecture; 'twas written by Arabella since she heard of his access<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on to the fortune of Sir George, and
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
probably contains a strong appeal to his feelings, founded upon past connections; I have reason to believe it chiefly points at my son, who has so long been a prisoner in France, and now at last has got his liberty upon exchange; but I dare say this churl is steel'd against humanity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what to think of him; that man's soul has no flow; impenetrable frost locks up its current: therefore be prepar'd.—And now, Harry, if you have any thing upon your mind to encharge me with, avail yourself of the moment, and impart it to me; the issue of these rencontres is uncertain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! I have been so improvident a hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣band, that I dare hardly send my last farewell to my much-injur'd wife; so unjust a father, that I have scarce presumption to bequeath a blessing to my son. In temporal affairs I am so totally undone, and life is now so perfectly a blank, that he who takes it from me, takes what I am tired of; and I solemnly conjure my family never to stir the question of my death, nor prosecute the author of it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEMPEST.</SPEAKER>
<P>GO your ways, vanish out of my sight, for a graceless young hussey.—You know I love you, Emily, you know I do, dear as the eyes in my head, better than the heart in my body, and there∣fore you baffle and bamboozle and make a bump∣kin of me; that's what you do: you see I am a damn'd fond forgiving old fool, and you impose upon my good-nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No very hard task, I shou'd hope. Only call upon you now and then for a few grains of cha∣ritable patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Grains of charitable nonsense, grains of hypocritical impertinence: what business have you to make any calls upon me that you know▪ I can't answer? I have no such thing as patience about me, no such dull mechanical property belonging to me; never had, never will have, never wish to have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, let it pass then; but you must own it's a little unreasonable to expect that I shou'd abound in that article, of which you my fa∣ther do not possess a single atom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all unreasonable, for your mother was a miracle of patience; I am sure I put it very sufficiently to the trial: why I took her with no other view but as we take a diet-drink in the spring, to sweeten the juices. Tempest, the son of Lord Hurricane, was never born to be calm; 'sblood and fire! I have never been in smooth water since first I was launch'd upon the surface of the globe. I was a younger son, and kick'd into the world with∣out
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
a sixpence; my father gave me no education, taught me nothing, kept me in ignorance, and buf∣feted me every day for being a dunce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was hard indeed, to give so little and demand so much—but some fathers are quite out of the way of reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a wipe at me, I suppose, but no matter—First I was turn'd into the army, there I got broken bones and empty pockets; then I was banished to the coast of Africa, to govern the sa∣vages of Senegambia; there I made a few blunders in colour, by taking whites for blacks and blacks for whites; but before my enemies could get hold of me, Death laid hands upon them, and I triumphed over their malice by the mortality of the climate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, you have been toss'd and tumbled about in this rough world pretty hand∣somely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, so handsomely that I will take care you shan't be toss'd and tumbled about, till you have a good pilot on board, and a safe harbour un∣der your lee, to lay up in for life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's as much as to say I shall embark with Sir David Daw, and lay up in his fusty old castle on the banks of the Wye, in Monmouthshire, to wit. A preciou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pilot I shall have, and a fa∣mous voyage we shall make of it!—Helm a-wea∣ther! cries he, and bear away for the coast of Wales—Helm a-lee! say I, and set all sails for the port of London. He is for steering West, I am for steering East; so between us we run wild out of the track, and make a wreck of ship and cargo in the scuffle for command.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk nonsense, Emily, you gabble without wit or wisdom. Sir David Daw is a very respectable gentleman in his own county.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he is a very silly gentleman for coming out of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has a noble property, a capital estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thanks to his ancestors!—he'll never mend it by discovery of the longitude.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Emily, Emily, do you think I have no eyes? what do you take me for—a mole, a bat, a beetle, not to see where your perverse affections point? You are never out of Mrs. Woodville's house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can that be a wonder, when persecution drives me out of your doors, and pity draws me into her's? Here I am baited by the silliest animal Folly ever lent her name to, there I am recreated by the gentlest being Heaven ever formed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, whilst you are talking thus of the mother, I know to a certainty it is the son you are thinking of; and positively, Emily, you must banish Henry Woodville from your thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I must lose the faculty of thinking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't tell me of your faculties, mine will never consent to marry you to a ruin'd man—Sir David is no gamester—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor the son of a gamester.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor the son of any thing, I shou'd think, that Nature ever own'd; for he is so far from being in the likeness of a man, that it wou'd be libelling a monkey to mistake them for each other.</P>

<P>Hold your tongue. I never said Sir Da∣vid was a wit.</P>

<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if he had wit, what wou'd you do with it? Who wou'd put a naked sword in the hands of a child? I like him the better for his be∣ing without it; I have none myself; I had sooner mess with the savages in Africa than be shut into a room with a company of wits.

<P>So they can but hop into your good graces, I care not.</P>

<P>Right, my gallant heart, that's the way to treat her—Emily is for ever giggling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir D. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is not singular in that: go where I will, they giggle; that is rather daunting, you must think. Amongst our Monmouthshire lasses who but I? Not that I am conscious of more wit than my neighbours, but my jokes always tell; they do so titter when I am in my merry vein, and the servants grin, and the tenants roar, and then my poor dear mother taps me on the cheek, and calls me her dainty David.—Oh! we are so merry in the castle.</P>

<SP>

<P>Agamemnon! Why in the character of Agamemnon, I wou'd fain know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he was a warrior like you, and a governor; but principally because, if I remember his history—he sacrific'd his daughter.</P>

<P>Heh! how! there I'm thrown out: that is a history I know nothing of.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir D. D.</SPEAKER>

<P>For him (to own the truth to you) I have very little compassion; some old habits of good fel∣lowship perhaps I can't quite shake off; but a gamester is in nature such a fool, in character so lit∣tle of a gentleman, and by profession so very close approaching towards a highwayman, that I am asham'd of his acquaintance; yet, for my dear Mrs. Woodville's sake, for my brave Henry's sake, and through them, by implication, for my sweet Emi∣ly's, I have shelter'd that poor worthless desperado in my lodgings; which is a secret you must keep close and inviolable as your own purity.</P>

<P>Doubt me not, for I can well suppose the consequences would be fatal. In one word, is there any hope for him?</P>

<P>Is he a madman, as they report of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Syden.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can't tell; for so many people are mad, who yet have senses enough to conceal it, that he may be so without my discovering it. He is as sullen as a bear, and inveterate against Woodville to thè length of any species of revenge.</P>

<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>You strike upon a motive, that may drive me upon wondrous self-denials. If my beloved Mrs. Woodville falls, if my dear gallant Henry is beaten down and crush'd by poverty and distress, at any sacrifice I'll raise them up.</P>

<P>So! I am in London once more.—From solitude and silence how sudden is the transition to crowded streets, where all without is noise, and all within me anarchy and tumult! Thoughts uncollected, jarring resolutions, avarice, revenge, ambition, all the turbid passions arming, like soldiers rous'd from sleep, to rush into the battle. Pity I have none; my heart is chang'd: I stopt in a by-place to re∣consider Mrs. Woodville's interceding letter; a nak∣ed, shivering wretch approach'd and begg'd my cha∣rity: she was importunate, and I with a remorse∣less frown bade her begone.—"Alas!" she cried, <Q>“if I had look'd you in the face I might have seen there was no hope for me.”</Q> I have the mark of Cain, the stamp of cruelty imprinted on my forehead.—She cut me to the heart; I wou'd have call'd her back and aton'd, but sullenness or pride forbade it.

<P>Here, then, was the residence of my once-be∣loved Arabella; here she reign'd, here she revell'd; and here, perhaps, in a desponding moment, she wrote that melancholy appeal, which wrung the weapon from my hand, when rais'd against her husband's life. I'll read it once again; the scene conspires, a sympathetic gloom comes over me; and solitude, the friend of meditation, prompts me to review it:—<Q>“By the death of Sir George Pen∣ruddock you will find us your debtors in no less a sum than all that we possess; if you are extreme, we are undone: my husband, who expects no mercy, flies from me in despair, and in his fate mine is involv'd: if then you find an orphan in the world, whose parents cou'd not move your pity, you may think revenge has done enough, and take my Henry into your protection—”</Q></P>

<P>What now? stop there, and let me only dwell upon those objects that delight, altho' they may delude: joy at the best is fugitive; paint hope in brilliant hues, and it is joy: the picture fades in∣deed, and its warm tints fly off, but whilst they fly, they charm, and memory feasts upon them, even when they are vanish'd.</P>

<P>I spoke, as men are apt to speak, what I believ'd upon report.—If you mean only to retort the words on me as their retailer, you still leave the original authority in force; but if you can refute that, you at once vindicate your own character from aspersion, and bring me to shame for my cre∣dulity and levity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I remember right, you quoted your own father as the authority, on which you rested: of him, therefore, in the first place, I will speak; of myself in the last.—Your father and myself were intimates through all that happy age, when nature wears no mask: our boyish sports, our college stu∣dies, our travelling excursions, united us in friend∣ship—This may be tedious talk, and yet I study to be brief, for my own sake as well as yours.</P>

<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
at this distant period I can't name without emoti∣ons that unman and shake my foolish heart—there∣fore no more of her. Your father was our mutual confidant, pass'd and repass'd between us on affairs of trust and secrecy, whilst I was busied in pro∣viding for our marriage settlement: I struggled against difficulties, that tortur'd my impatience, and at length overcame them. In that interval a villain had belied my character, poison'd her cre∣dulous mind, and by the display of a superior for∣tune, prevail'd upon her parents to revoke their pro∣mises to me, and marry her to him.—What did this wretch deserve?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Death from your hands, and infamy from all the world.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll answer that hereafter; and by the ho∣nour of a soldier, I will answer it as truth and jus∣tice shall exact of me?

<P>What but to think how glorious an op∣portunity he let slip of rescuing the brave lad from disappointment, and defeating that rich blockhead of a baronet, that dunder-headed Daw, who waits to snap her up; was'nt that enough to do it? Zooks! had I swallow'd Hecla, I cou'd not have fum'd more furiously.</P>

<P>No; but I understood it well enough without his giving—I saw it in his looks; if you would paint a head of Caius Marius in his prison, he was the very model for it: It chill'd benevolence to look upon him; Spitzbergen cou'd not freeze me more effectually than his marble face.</P>

<P>I'm weary, sick, discomfited. This world and I must part once more. That it has virtues, I will not deny; but they lie buried in a tide of vanities, like grains of gold in sand wash'd down by moun∣tain torrents: I cannot wait the sifting—Syden∣ham has a heart—what then? his zeal, like a rich cordial drank to intoxication, loses its sweet nature, and becomes pernicious by abuse.—Henry is young; and, like the promise of a forward spring, flatters our hopes of harvest; 'twere hard to let him wither in the bud: he too is thoughtless, rash, impetuous—but he's a soldier and a lover; with them I sym∣pathize—besides, his mother's in his face.</P>

<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall know all.—My father at first sight shrunk from me, conscious and abash'd; I urg'd your charge upon him strongly, perhaps (for I was gall'd with many griefs) more strongly than became me: my high tone offended him, and he re∣fused to answer; a second time I urg'd the same de∣mand; my mother instantly replied, that your ap∣peal was true—you had been grossly wrong'd.—Her candour drew forth his confession, qualified with this excuse, that he had tender'd satisfaction; hinting withal, that had the affair taken place, he wou'd not have return'd your fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is enough, I am satisfied; you know me now to have been an injur'd man, betray'd by him I trusted, wounded in the tenderest part, and robb'd of all I held most dear: if, therefore, I am become <HI>savage, insensible,</HI> and all that you once thought me, I have some natural plea; and, should you find me a hard creditor to one that was so false a friend, what can you say?</P>

<P>He has undone his family, lost great sums by play, and chiesly, as I find, to Sir George Penruddock, who supplied him also with loans till his estate was mortgag'd to its value, his town∣house seiz'd, and bond debts hanging over him, that put his person at my mercy—If revenge were my object, these are tempting opportunities for in∣dulging it; if avarice were my passion, here are ample means for gratifying it.—What have you now to offer on your father's part?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are not as totally revers'd in nature as you are rais'd in fortune, I shall not repent of having hazarded a step so humbling to my sex, so agonizing to my feelings; for I am sure it was not in your heart, when I partook of it, to treat a guiltless woman with contempt, or wreak unmanly vengeance on your worst of enemies, when fallen at your feet.—Shall I proceed, or pause? Give me the sign; I urge you not to answer.—Ah, Sir! you are greatly agitated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am indeed; yet if I can resolve to turn aside my eyes from the still lovely ruin of your face, I may find powers to hear you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Years upon years have pass'd since I have heard that voice, yet in my dreams those tones have visited me; I have wak'd, and cried—<Q>“Speak to me, Arabella, Oh! speak again!”</Q>—'Twas fan∣cy, 'twas illusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me retire; I cannot bear to hurt you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do not leave me: Did you know what struggles I have surmounted, you wou'd say I perform wonders.—I cou'd not write to you, judge what it is to see you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought that these emotions had sub∣sided,
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
and that solitude and study had made you a philosopher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see what a philosopher I am. You never knew me rightly; I had a heart for friendship and love; I was betray'd by one, and ruin'd in the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been deeply injur'd, I must own: I too have been to blame, but I was young and credulous, and caught with glittering snares.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, snares they have been; fatal ones, alas!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have liv'd in dissipation, you in calm retirement: how peacefully your hours have pass'd, how unquietly mine! One only solace cheer'd my sad heart—my Henry, my son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I've seen him; I've convers'd with him: he spoke unguardedly, but disappointment sours the mind; he treated me unjustly—but he resembles you, and I forgave him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you say that, you speak of what I was, not what I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are much chang'd, much faded; but I have your picture fresh and fair as the first bloom of youth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>My picture! how did you possess yourself of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a most foul and infamous piece of knavery; a treacherous friend defrauded me of the substance, and left me nothing but the shadow to contemplate: but memory was faithful; it has cheer'd me in my solitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are thus retentive of affection, I must suppose you are no less so of resentment; why then shou'd I repeat my sorrows? You know them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know them; I have felt them; I have redress'd them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Redress'd them! What is it I hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I have done, I have done; I cannot talk of benefits, nor will I hear acknowledge∣ments.

You wou'd have sunk—I cou'd not chuse but save you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll not oppress you with those fulsome thanks that pall the generous ear; I will congratu∣late you rather on those exquisite sensations, which must far outvalue any price you can have paid for them; I'll say to you in truth, that till this moment I had almost lost remembrance of your person; doubt on my part, and reserve on your's, had wrapt a mist about you—now mercy beams, the cloud disperses, and I behold and acknowledge Penruddock once again.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>HENRY</HI> enters to them.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must forgive me. Tho' your ser∣vants were drawn up to oppose my entrance, I broke through all their files, forc'd on by gratitude that nothing cou'd withstand, till I beheld my be∣nefactor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not much of a benefactor; I have only restor'd to you what my conscience could not keep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the name of goodness, what is it you have done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but wanted stomach for a banquet where your son was serv'd up;—in plainer words, prefer'd my own cottage to his country house: Henry wanted a wife, a wife wanted a set∣tlement, and I stood in need of neither.—I hope you and Tempest are agreed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>A word from your lawyer silenc'd all objections—If I have not felt the vicissitudes of sor∣tune, who has?—from the depth of despair, lifted on the instant to the summit of felicity.—Oh! my dear mother, help me to some words that may ex∣press my gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, she is mute by compromise: when I am quietly retiring from the stage of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain world, call me not back to lose the little grace that I have gain'd; I would not be made a spectacle in my decline and do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you again sequester yourself, and renounce the society even of your most grateful friends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I have yet perus'd but half the history of man; the pages are alternate, dark and bright; I have read the former only: let Henry's virtue stand the test, and I have all the pleasurable study still to come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how shall I abide the trial, if you only furnish the temptation, and withhold the pre∣cept that shou'd teach me to resist it? What if my virtue be hard press'd; where but to your cottage shou'd I resort for armor to defend it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can you want of me? Go to your mother, drink at the fountain's head; look back upon your father, mark how the stream is sullied. Thus arm'd on each hand, I may say to you, in the words of Cato—</P>

<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have broke through all forms, worthy Sir, in bringing you a saucy girl, who will fancy she is privileg'd to pay her court to every generous character, that does honor to humanity, and is bountiful to her friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess to you, Mr. Tempest, I was ambitious to behold your fair daughter, but did not presume to expect the visit shou'd spring with her.—I hope, Madam, there is something here present more amusing to your eye-sight than a crabbed old clown, who happens to have a little more kindness at his heart than he carries in his countenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>True generosity is above grimace; It is not always that the eye which pities, is accom∣panied by the hand that bestows: some there are, who c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> smile without friendship, and weep with∣out charity.</P>

<P>My father lives in it; I should be loth to say I had a preference for any other.</P>

<P>I suppose, Mr. Tempest, you are one of the vainest men in England.</P>

<P>One of the happiest I am, and of your making; for Henry Woodville ever had my warmest wishes.</P>

<P>And I hope your lovely daughter meets those wishes with all dutiful compliance?</P>

<P>Now, my Henry, you are without comparison the happiest, or without pity, the most miserable of mankind; here if you fail in merit, you offend beyond the reach of mercy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam: but the sons of Cor∣nelia did not disgrace their mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>There again! that's something out of a book, like Emily's Agam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mnon, and if it was trea∣son I could not find it out.—But come, Henry! here, in the presence of your benefactor, I bestow upon you all I am worth—a virtuous daughter, the only joy and blessing of my life: money I have none, for I did not understand the arts of government▪ and when Emily is gone from me, I am without resources; for I cannot, like Mr. Penruddock, take shelter with the sciences; and as for the arts, damn me if I believe I have genius enough to aspire to the composition of a cabbage-net.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! my dear father, let me conjure you to believe that those resources which my duty, my affection have hitherto supplied, shall be doubled to you in future, when I have so kind a partner in that pleasing task.</P>

<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you are not welcome to me, I must cease to be worthy of my Emily—If books do not serve for a resource, and antient history is

too remote, we can find heroes in modern times; and you shall fight over your battles as often as you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very pleasant, I confess, for there I can come on a little; but then I grow warm with the subject, and Emily snubs me for swearing; which you know, Mr. Penruddock, every soldier is privileg'd to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Sydenham, I cannot allow you to call that language foolish, which springs from a heart that runs over with benevolence: as well you may blaspheme the bounty of the Nile, because it breaks loose from its channel, and overflows its banks.</P>

<P>Thank you, my dear Sir, thank you heartily; I have been as sour as crab-juice with the malice of mankind, now I am all oil and ho∣ney, and shall slip through the rest of my days in harmony and good-humor.—Ah!

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir D. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm not pleas'd at all, Governor Tem∣pest, and therefore it matters little what I say: I call'd at your door, and was directed to you hither, so I made free to step in: and now, to say truth, I don't care how soon I step out, for my chaise is in waiting, and I am equipt, as you see, for my pe∣remptory departure.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us part friends however; if you can charge me fairly, do so! I'll not flinch.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir D. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but you'll fly out, and that's worse.</P>
</SP>

<P>Not I: carry no grievances with you into Wales; I'll be calm as water, say what you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir D. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! then I can say enough.—Did you not consent to my proposing for your daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Temp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I did consent, I don't deny it; and if Emily had not objected to your proposals, I should not have quarrel'd with your property; but I'm not such a Blue-beard to deliver my daughter bound hands and feet into your castle. If you had not the gift of recommending yourself, am I to blame for that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir D. D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am I? Miss Emily can witness I took due pains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes; and let not my obstinacy dis∣courage you, for be assur'd that half those pains, bestow'd upon a heart less constant to it's first at∣tachment, and more regardful of it's worldly inte∣rests, will command success, whenever you think fit to repeat the experiment.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Penrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Woodville, your husband and I have concurr'd in opinion that the only way of ad∣justing such differences as subsisted between us, is by consigning them at once to oblivion, trusting that you and Henry also will do the same by those er∣rors, which now are fortunately heal'd, and can ne∣ver be repeated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humbled as I am in conscience, and over∣whelm'd by generosity, I am ill able to find words for what, in circumstances like mine, I ought to say to each here present in particular, and all in general. Wherever I direct my eyes, they are saluted with a countenance, which, tho' entitled to reproach me, seems to hold forth promises of pardon: but per∣haps, even from guilt like mine, some good may be extracted; and my son, when he shall be blest with a wife, lovely and virtuous as his mother, will re∣collect the follies of his father, and avoid his fate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nrud.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here we conclude.—We all have cause of thankfulness, but I the most; for I've escap'd the perils of prosperity: the sudden onset stagger'd me; but temperate recollection, and the warning calls of some here present, taught me to know, that the true use of riches is to share them with the worthy; and the sole remedy for injuries, to forgive them.</P>
