<HEAD>TO Mr. <HI>DENNIS</HI>, and Mr. <HI>GILDON</HI>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>A</HI> Generous Nature suffers no Misfortune else, with such severe <HI>Reluctance,</HI> as arises from an Obligation to pursue the little Arts of <HI>Flattery,</HI> which <HI>Custom,</HI> now-adays, has render'd <HI>neces∣sary,</HI> in Addresses to the <HI>Powerful</HI>.</P>
<P>I, therefore, who have no Relish for <HI>Ambition;</HI> who neither court, nor <HI>wou'd</HI> enjoy, the Pomp of Grandeur; and who, amidst the gaudiest Attributes of Power, see nothing, worth my <HI>Envy,</HI> or my <HI>Wishes,</HI> but the still-neglected Means of making <HI>Merit,</HI> happy, and distinguishable; I, who have no Views, in Writings of this Nature, but the Pleasure they afford me, can, with ease, pass by the Great in <HI>Title,</HI> and address my Application to the Great in <HI>Knowledge:</HI> Men, who, through the Gloom of Fortune's <HI>Shade,</HI> shine out, to the impartial Eye, with native Lustre.</P>
<P>I chuse out <HI>you,</HI> among the Kindred of the Muses, as you are their <HI>genuine</HI> Offspring: Men, who wou'd teach the World the Force of <HI>Reason;</HI> and give <HI>Pleasure,</HI> only to insinuate <HI>Instruction</HI>: Who wou'd support the Antient Dignity of your Profession; and behold, with <HI>Scorn,</HI> the <HI>Prostitution</HI> of an Art, design'd for <HI>Great,</HI> and <HI>Godlike</HI> Ʋses.</P>
<P>To know you for severe, and watchful <HI>Criticks,</HI> does not fright <HI>me</HI> from acknowledging your Worth. I see, and own, the Great, the Noble <HI>Usefulness</HI> of your Profession. Why has not the <HI>blind</HI> Goddess thrown your <HI>Lots,</HI> as high, above the <HI>Grovellers</HI> of <HI>Par∣nassus,</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
as we confess your <HI>Understandings?</HI> In spite of all the little, empty Differences, Forms, and Circumstances, of <HI>Condition,</HI> I look, with Pleasure, over Crouds of <HI>Titles,</HI> up to your Perfections; and behold you plac'd, even <HI>now,</HI> where length of <HI>Time,</HI> and just <HI>Posterity,</HI> shall fix your <HI>Memories</HI>.</P>
<P>You therefore, who are able to do Justice, both ways, who can distinguish <HI>Excellencies,</HI> and detect <HI>Absurdity;</HI> You best <HI>deserve</HI> the Labour of the <HI>Muses:</HI> And, to <HI>you,</HI> and <HI>not</HI> your <HI>Patrons,</HI> I ascri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e this Tragedy.</P>
<P>There is, I find, a great Misfortune, which attends the Repre∣sentation of a Play, whose <HI>Plot</HI> has any just Connexion, or <HI>Depen∣dency</HI> of <HI>Scene</HI>. Our general Audiences consist of Men, whose Heads are bent a very different Way from what is necessary for a <HI>Taste</HI> of <HI>Poetry</HI>. And, being never <HI>moved</HI> by the affected, vi∣cious, and unnatural <HI>Tone</HI> of <HI>Voice,</HI> so common, on our Stages; They sink insensibly, from that <HI>Attention,</HI> into which <HI>judicious</HI> Actors forcibly attract us; And, by that Means, lose the <HI>Thread</HI> of the Design: and, consequently, all the <HI>Relish</HI> of the Entertain∣ment.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, that, without Attention, 'tis impossible for any Play to <HI>strike</HI>. Now, where it does not <HI>strike,</HI> 'tis as impos∣sible to <HI>please</HI>: And, if it does not <HI>please,</HI> it never can <HI>instruct</HI>. So, here, we find the very <HI>End</HI> of all <HI>Dramatic</HI> Poetry <HI>destroyed,</HI> by that one fundamental <HI>Evil</HI> of a Players <HI>Ignorance</HI>. I might, more justly, call it <HI>Obstinacy</HI>. They cannot, if they think at all, but know what is <HI>Natural,</HI> from what is <HI>Monstrous</HI>: But they are so accustom'd to a horrible, <HI>Theatric,</HI> way of speaking, that, ex∣cept in Mr. <HI>Booth,</HI> who is, indeed, a just and excellent Trage∣dian, you shall never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear so much as an Endeavour, at those thril∣ling <HI>Breaks,</HI> and <HI>Changes</HI> of the <HI>Voice;</HI> the only possible Ex∣pression of our Passions, in their Variations and Degrees, and, which so sensibly alarm the Soul, and challenge the <HI>Attention</HI> of an Audience. If <HI>Grief,</HI> which claims a <HI>low,</HI> and <HI>broken</HI> Voice, is
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
utter'd in the Thunder of a <HI>Rant,</HI> what Mark has <HI>Rage</HI> to be di∣stinguished by? Our Actors shou'd industriously forget <HI>themselves,</HI> and the <HI>Spectators;</HI> and put on the <HI>Nature,</HI> with the <HI>Dress,</HI> of every Character they represent. They shou'd not <HI>act,</HI> but really <HI>be,</HI> the <HI>happy,</HI> or the <HI>wretched,</HI> which we are to think 'em.</P>
<P>You will say, a <HI>perfect Actor</HI> is a Wonder, we must rather <HI>wish,</HI> than <HI>hope</HI> for: But, to shew, by what we <HI>have,</HI> what 'tis, we shou'd <HI>desire,</HI> he must, at once, be furnished, with the several Ex∣cellences following. The Face, and Stature, and no more, of Mr. <HI>Leigh,</HI> at the <HI>New</HI> House. The genteel Turn, and Softness of Address, of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> together with his brisk, and lively Spirit. The Majesty of Mr. <HI>Keene</HI>. The Assurance of Mr. <HI>Cib∣ber</HI>. And, to crown all these, Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s sweet <HI>Voice,</HI> just <HI>Accent,</HI> and <HI>Solemnity</HI> of Ʋtterance: And add to <HI>all,</HI> a Frequen∣cy, and Aptness, of expressive <HI>Gesture</HI>: with a Visage, capable of putting on at Will, the Lines, and Marks of every Passion.</P>
<P>As I am writing to such perfect Judges of the <HI>Drama,</HI> I look upon my self oblig'd to tell you, that I have endeavour'd to observe the <HI>Rules,</HI> with all the necessary <HI>strictness</HI>. And yet, at the same Time, indulge the Common Taste, for <HI>Fullness</HI> of <HI>Design;</HI> and <HI>Business,</HI> as our Players call it.</P>
<P>This <HI>New</HI> Essay to reconcile the <HI>Antient,</HI> and the <HI>Modern</HI> Plans of Tragedy (the first Endeavour of the Kind) may, possibly de∣serve Improvement, from some future Imitator. Tho' I wou'd not, with the famous Mr. <HI>Bays,</HI> affirm the <HI>End,</HI> and sole Design of Tragic Writing, to be, as he expresses it, to <HI>Elevate</HI> and <HI>Surprize,</HI> yet I will offer it to your Decision, whether <HI>Admiration,</HI> tho' most pro∣perly the Business of the <HI>Epic</HI> Poem, may not merit to be added as a <HI>Third Requisite,</HI> to the Present <HI>Movers</HI> of the Tragic Muse, which, speaking strictly, stands confin'd to Terror, and Compassion.</P>
<P>I wou'd not, here, he understood to mean, that <HI>barren</HI> Kind of <HI>Admiration,</HI> which arises from Perplexity of <HI>Plot,</HI> producd from
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
huddled Heaps of Incidents, not naturally <HI>bringing on,</HI> and <HI>fol∣lowing</HI> each other; but that juster Passion, which we feel, from a Reflection on the strange <HI>Degrees,</HI> and various <HI>Means,</HI> whereby the <HI>Vices</HI> we correct in Tragedy, <HI>draw down</HI> upon a guilty Head, the very Ills, and Miseries, they were committed to <HI>avoid</HI>.</P>
<P>As this new Specimen of Tragedy is built, perhaps, upon the most Variety of Turns, and has a deeper and a more surprizing Plot, than any Play which has been publish'd, that I know of, in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue; and yet is written with a strict Observance of <HI>Dramatic Rule:</HI> And since it will appear, that notwithstanding this Respect which I have paid the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Poetry,</HI> I have found room for <HI>Topical</HI> Reflection, large <HI>Description, Love, War, Show,</HI> and <HI>Passion:</HI> So I would, at least, propose it to the Enemies of <HI>Criti∣cism,</HI> as a Proof (however otherwise imperfect) that <HI>Order</HI> does not, as they frequently object, confine the Ranges of a Poet's Fancy: But may, on the contrary, collect, make apt, and add to the delight of all those scatter'd <HI>random Beauties,</HI> which our <HI>Tragic Libertines</HI> have been so fond of.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moral</HI> I sate down to write upon was, to expose the dange∣rous Consequences of our giving way to <HI>Rage,</HI> and Rashness of Deter∣mination: Teaching, thence, how necessary 'tis, to hold a steddy Rein upon our Passions; and consent to no <HI>first Ill,</HI> tho' with intent to guard against a threatening <HI>Greater</HI>.</P>
<P>That I might be at Liberty to form the proper <HI>Incidents</HI> with less Confinment to my Fancy, I resolved to chuse no noted Character of <HI>History</HI>. Our distance <HI>from,</HI> and dark Ideas <HI>of,</HI> the <HI>Chinese</HI> Nation, and her Borders, tempted me to fix my Scene in so <HI>remote</HI> a Situation. The <HI>Fable</HI> is fictitious; and the Characters are all imaginary, even to the very Names, excepting only <HI>Uncham,</HI> com∣mon to the Emperors of <HI>China,</HI> as at <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Caesars</HI>. The <HI>Manners,</HI> and the <HI>Sentiments,</HI> are <HI>proper,</HI> because <HI>necessary</HI> to produce the several <HI>Ends,</HI> which form the Business of each Character. The <HI>Language</HI> is not labour'd, nor too low,: But such as I conceive
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
might reasonably be expected, from the Persons we suppose to <HI>utter</HI> it. The common <HI>Tinsel</HI>-Ware, of <HI>Simile</HI> and <HI>Metaphor,</HI> I have little dealt in, unless when I attempt <HI>Description:</HI> There, you know, they are not only <HI>natural,</HI> but <HI>requisite</HI>. As to the Descrip∣tions themselves, tho' very frequent in this Tragedy, you will not think they are too many, if you find, they are well touch'd, and in∣troduced so <HI>aptly,</HI> as to be <HI>necessary,</HI> as well as <HI>ornamental,</HI> to the Business of the Play.</P>
<P>The <HI>Decoration,</HI> which, however slighted, or ill-understood, among us, is a <HI>fifth Essential:</HI> And without it, 'tis impossible but that the finest Tragedy must be <HI>maim'd,</HI> and strain on <HI>Probability,</HI> to this I paid a very great regard, in the Contrivance of the Play: And all the <HI>Dresses</HI> and the <HI>Scenes,</HI> were <HI>new:</HI> And such, who saw 'em, in the Representation, will confess them <HI>not unpleasing,</HI> and extreme∣ly differing from any thing which has been lately seen upon the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Stages.</P>
<P>The <HI>Unities</HI> I have preserv'd unbroken, every where. The <HI>Action</HI> you will find is <HI>single</HI> and <HI>entire</HI>. The <HI>Place</HI> confin'd to <HI>one</HI> Town only; And the <HI>Time</HI> within the compass of a <HI>natural Day,</HI> even at the utmost.</P>
<P>I will enlarge on nothing further, but to wish, That as on <HI>Tues∣day next,</HI> the <HI>6</HI>th of <HI>March,</HI> they act <HI>this Tragedy</HI> for Mrs. <HI>Ro∣ger</HI>'s <HI>Benefit;</HI> who does so well and so agreeably perform a chief Part in it; the <HI>Readers</HI> of <HI>both Sexes,</HI> into whose Hands, before that Day, the Play shall fall, would give themselves the Pleasure to ob∣serve, with what a graceful Easiness she enters into the true <HI>mean∣ing</HI> of her Character; and pay her the <HI>Applauses,</HI> which her great Experience of the Stage, and artful Application to its Business, so justly merit, from a knowing Audience.</P>

<L>The Time will come, says he, when my <HI>Orontes</HI></L>

<L>Wise Sir, it is. The Emperor receiv'd,</L>

<L>My Lord, I am well vers'd in all that Tale,</L>

<L>Of our Great Monarch: and continued lov'd,</L>
<L>'Till, having borne the Princes, first <HI>Omalco</HI>,</L>

<L>Ay! but the Cause? Why made he that rash Vow?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sizang.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Our Monarch, in his youth, was apt to dream,</L>
<L>And, oft, his Dreams were fatal: Thrice, one Night,</L>
<L>His Sleep was broke, with the repeated Vision</L>
<L>Of hoary <HI>Charilac</HI>, the God of Groves;</L>
<L>Three Times the Emp'ror kneeling, ask'd, what Fate</L>
<L>His Reign shou'd end in? And, as oft, distinctly,</L>
<L>The visionary God, thus answer'd loud:</L>
<L>"Curs'd for thy Crimes, <HI>Caimantha</HI> bears a Son,</L>
<L>"Whose prosp'rous Virtue shall attain thy Crown,</L>
<L>"And give thee Death, deserv'd by bloody Deeds.</L>

<L>Yet, so much it mov'd him,</L>

<L>And made that solemn Vow; I told but now,</L>
<L>At large, what follow'd: By a dead-born Daughter,</L>
<L>Which made the Ill he fear'd impossible,</L>
<L>'Twas hop'd, his Mind wou'd strait recover Ease;</L>
<L>But Fate refus'd it; and, from that curs'd Dream,</L>
<L><HI>Caimantha</HI> lost his Love; and grew more hated,</L>

<L>Bound towards this dismal Isle, with sev'n Attendants,</L>
<L>A small, but faithful Train: A prosp'rous Gale</L>
<L>Swell'd our spread Sails; and, right afore the Wind,</L>
<L>We plow'd the foamy Billows: 'Till, one Night,</L>
<L>Sailing by Moon-light, close along the Shoar</L>
<L>Of huge <HI>Sumatra</HI>'s high, and rocky Coast;</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="39"/>Far, in the East of Heav'n, appear'd a Cloud,</L>

<L>Dreadful, it spread; and darken'd all the Sky.</L>
<L>A rattling Show'r pour'd heavily upon us;</L>
<L>And the Sea swell'd, with angry Jealousy,</L>
<L>As if another Sea were emptying on him.</L>
<L>Still, as the Rain increas'd, so rose the Wind;</L>

<L>When, by a sudden Glare of crooked Lightning,</L>
<L>Which, with a swift, a momentary Flash,</L>
<L>Darted Distinction through the horrid Gloom;</L>
<L>I saw the Empress grasp the tott'ring Mast;</L>

<L>Were coming in a <HI>Body,</HI> all about ye,</L>
<L>Plainly to let you know—</L>

<L>Which is, in downright <HI>English,</HI> you're <HI>unkind;</HI></L>

<L><PB REF="80"/>Because, of late, your Practice seems to own,</L>
<L>You like <HI>That</HI> best, which you have <HI>longest known;</HI></L>
