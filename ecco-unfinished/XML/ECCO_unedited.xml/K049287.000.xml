<HEAD>To Dr. * * *</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE our last conversation, I have been endea∣vouring
to collect and digest my thoughts, touching
the external use of Mineral Waters, as comprehended in
the three several articles of <HI>Pumping, Bathing,</HI> and <HI>Fo∣mentation;</HI>
but in the course of my reflections, I fine the
subject cannot be properly discussed within the limits of a
small occasional Pamphlet; and, with regard to a com∣pleat
syst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, I have neither time nor opportunity to con∣firm
by experiments, the particular notions I entertain
concerning the efficacy of those Waters: Nevertheless, I
shall, in compliance with your request, commit to the Pub∣lic,
these opinions, singular as they are, with the reasons
on which they are built, in hope that they will prove ser∣viceable
hints to those who are better qualified than my∣self,
for prosecuting useful inquiries in the medical world.
True it is the <HI>Thermae</HI> and <HI>Acidulae,</HI> or hot and cold Mi∣neral
Springs, have been investigated by so many different
pens, and produced such a variety of opinions among
physicians and chemists, that there is very little encou∣ragement
for any man to commence author on the same
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
branch of natural knowledge, because he must run a very
great risque of seeing his sentiments neglected among the
number of those vague <HI>Hypotheses</HI> which are looked upon
as the children of idle imagination.</P>
<P>One writer denies that the Water in the generality of
Hot Wells, is impregnated with <HI>Sulphur;</HI> while another
affirms, that, without <HI>Sulphur,</HI> no such natural Hot Wa∣ters
can exist. Yet, both these authors quote experiments
to vouch for the truth of their different asseverations;
one asserting, that although he had immersed silver in ma∣ny
of the most noted <HI>Thermae</HI> on the continent of <HI>Europe,</HI>
he could not perceive the colour of the metal changed;
neither could he procure any real brimstone by evaporat∣ing
the Water; nor would the residue, when mixed with
Salt of <HI>Tartar,</HI> produce the <HI>Hepar Sulphuris.</HI> But, in
opposition to this Doctrine, there are so many concurring
observations, that it is amazing to see it maintained by an
author of <HI>Hoffman</HI>'s reputation; for, besides the Hot
Baths of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> described in the Philoso∣phical
Transactions, and the Spaw at <HI>Harrigate,</HI> in which
Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI> found actual brimstone floating in flakes; <HI>Hoff∣man</HI>
himself owns that the Waters at <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI>
which are better known than any other in <HI>Europe,</HI> abound
with this Mineral in such quantities, that whole pounds of
the flowers of <HI>Sulphur</HI> are found sticking to the stones
that line the fountain-head of the Springs.</P>
<P>Nor are the opinions of chemists less contradictory in
their <HI>Analysations</HI> of cold <HI>chalybeate</HI> Waters. Some of that
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
class say, they contain an <HI>Acid,</HI> whence their Name <HI>Aci∣dulae;</HI>
while others (and among the rest, <HI>Hoffman,</HI>)
deny the <HI>Acid:</HI> Nay, he pretends to have found a manifest
<HI>alkaline Salt,</HI> and upon this Proof, erects a theory of their
operation on the human viscera, when drank in large quan∣tities:
but this <HI>Alkali</HI> is, by Dr. <HI>Short</HI> explained into a se∣diment
of <HI>calcareous Earth,</HI> and a portion of common salt.
<HI>Hoffman</HI> likewise denies the existence of fixed or real <HI>Vi∣triol</HI>
in these Waters, though he allows they are impreg∣nated
with a <HI>vitriolic Acid;</HI> but <HI>Short</HI> justly blames him
for making such a distinction without a real difference;
and Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI> hints a method for obtaining from them a
solid <HI>Vitriol.</HI></P>
<P>Such diversity of opinions, among those who have laid
themselves out for <HI>analysing</HI> Mineral Waters, cannot fail to
perplex and embarrass people who attempt to reason upon
the use of them, without having had the advantage of see∣ing
their effects, in a long course of practice, by which
alone their Medicinal Virtues are to be ascertained.</P>
<P>For my own part, without having recourse to the
assistance of a <HI>Spiritus Rector,</HI> an <HI>Acidum vagum,</HI> or
subtile <HI>elastic Spirit,</HI> universal cause and fountain of all
particular <HI>Spirits,</HI> whether in the mineral, vegetable or
animal world—I say, without the interposition of any
such unintelligible influence, I can easily conceive how
extraordinary cures may be performed by the mechanical
effects of simple <HI>Water</HI> upon the human Body; and I
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly believe that in the use of <HI>bathing</HI> and <HI>pumping, that</HI>
Efficacy is often ascribed to the <HI>mineral Particles,</HI>
which properly belongs to the <HI>Element</HI> itself, exclusive of
any foreign assistance.—<HI>Hoffman</HI> indeed, acknowledges
that the energy of mineral waters, both in preventing
and curing Diseases, is in a great measure, owing to the
Water itself; though he alledges the other principles serve
to stimulate and quicken its operation.</P>
<P><HI>Pure Water</HI> is certainly of all others, the most salutary
beverage, as being the best fitted to mix with all the
animal juices, assist the different secretions of the human
body, and prevent that Rigidity and <HI>Coalescence</HI> of the
vessels, which are the immediate causes of old age; and
while it thus acts as an universal <HI>Deobstruent,</HI> by di∣luting
the Fluids; instead of <HI>abrading,</HI> or offending the
solids, it clears them from all <HI>extrane<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> adhesions, and
manifestly contributes to the preservation of their due
tone and flexibility. These admirable qualities inherent
in simple Water, are clearly evinced by the uninterrupt∣ed
health, good spirits, and <HI>Longaevity</HI> of those who use
nothing else for their ordinary drink; and many in∣stances
might be given of acute and ardent Fevers cured
by plentiful draughts of warm water; as well as of <HI>chro∣nical</HI>
Distempers that have yielded to a regular course of
drinking cold, Spring-water at the Fountain-head. But,
such an enquiry does not fall within my design, which
was that of considering the Fluid in its external appli∣cation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
I have known the most sordid and inveterate <HI>scrophu∣lous</HI>
and <HI>scorbutic</HI> ulcers cured by the <HI>aspersion</HI> of common
Well-water, which to the taste and smell, exhibited no
signs of mineral impregnation; but, at first, derived its
reputation from the superstition of the people, by whom,
in times of ignorance, it had been dedicated to one of the
legendary saints of the Roman kalendar. Such cures are
undoubtedly performed by the coldness, pressure, and
moisture of those waters: the first communicates a spring
to the decayed or diseased solids, by which the vessels are
enabled to propel their contents, and renew the circula∣tion,
which had been impeded; the pressure supports the
weakened sides of the capillaries or fine lymphatics against
the increased momentum of the juices thus again set in
motion, helping, at the same time, to restrain the <HI>fun∣gous</HI>
excrescences, in determining that praeternatural <HI>In∣crementum</HI>
in a lateral direction▪ by which a re-union of
the fibres is effected; and the moisture deterges the ulcer,
by washing away the <HI>acrid</HI> matter, which would other∣wise
<HI>corrode</HI> the parts, and consequently obstruct the cure.</P>
<P>Surgeons in general, are, in my opinion, too neglect∣ful
in making due compression, in sores over-run with
<HI>Fungus,</HI> or circumscribed with <HI>Callus.</HI> In these cases, the
tone of the solids is always debilitated or lost; and when
the excrescences regerminated (as it were) under the knife,
and sprung up, in spite of all the <HI>Catheretics</HI> and even
<HI>Caustics</HI> that could be used, I have known them subdued
by moderate compression, and a kindly digestion obtain∣ed.
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
In all wounds also, that happen in parts of a loose
or membranous texture, and are become <HI>fistulous,</HI> from
the nature of their situation, such as those in the <HI>Urethra,</HI>
or in the cheek, when the salival duct is divided, it will
be almost impossible to effect the cure, without a particu∣lar
attention to this circumstance of pressure, which, if
properly conducted, will seldom or never fail.</P>
<P>The efficacy of the <HI>Cold Bath,</HI> tho' unimpregnated with
mineral principles, is so well known in <HI>hypochondriac</HI> Dis∣orders,
in diseases of the lax fibre, and partial weaknesses,
when the <HI>Viscera</HI> are not unsound, that there is scarce a
Physician, Surgeon, or Apothecary, who has not oppor∣tunities
of seeing it every day. Those, therefore, who
want further information on this head, I refer to the writ∣ings
of <HI>Floyer</HI> and <HI>Baynard;</HI> together with a very inge∣nious
essay written in Italian by <HI>Antonio Cocchi,</HI> and print∣ed
at <HI>Rome</HI> in the year 1738, in a collection intituled▪
<HI>Saggi di dissertazioni accademiche, pubblicamente lette
nella nob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le accademia Etrusca dell' antichissima Città di
Cortona.</HI> Tomo II.</P>
<P>The author of this dissertation, which is the tenth as it
stands in the volume, justifies the external use of cold
Water, from the practice of the Antients; and, in the
course of his disquisitions, forms a very plausible conjec∣ture,
touching the distemper of <HI>Augustus,</HI> which was
cured by the celebrated <HI>Antonius Musa.</HI> He refutes the
opinion of those who supposed the Emperor's disease was
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
a gout, by mistaking the word <HI>Arteria</HI> for <HI>Articulare;</HI>
and brings very good reasons for believing that it was a
<HI>Tabes pituitaria,</HI> seated in the glands of the Palate, Fau∣ces,
and <HI>Asperia Arteria:</HI> Accordingly, <HI>Musa</HI> prescribed
cool gargles, and ordered cold Water to be thrown up∣on
his body. But I shall now proceed to consider the
effects of simple Water, in the article of Pumping; a me∣thod
of application, in which it will undoubtedly act with
great and surprising energy, upon the nerves and fibres of
the human body.</P>
<P>The learned and judicious Commentator upon <HI>Boer∣haave</HI>'s
Aphorisms, says, he has sometimes cured chro∣nical
Tumours about the knee, that resisted almost every
other remedy, by letting warm Water fall from an high
place, <HI>guttatim,</HI> or drop by drop, upon the part: if
therefore warm water descending with such an incon∣siderable
<HI>Momentum,</HI> and in so small a Volume, will
prove efficacious in removing one of the most unyield∣ing
of all Tumours; what may not be expected from
the descent of a full Stream that covers at once, the part
affected? It may be supposed, indeed, that a succession
of single Drops falling upon different parts of the Tu∣mour,
may produce a gentle undulation in the diseased
vessels, by which the obstructed Matter is <HI>comminuted,</HI>
put in motion and expelled; whereas, a large sheet of
Water, that covers the whole surface of the diseased part,
presses equally on every point of it; so that the obstruct∣ed
matter cannot move to any one place of the Tu∣mour,
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
where there is less resistance than in any other;
but, if the Pump be of a moderate diameter, and the
Stream properly managed and played upon the part, the
resistance may be varied to much better effect, than we
can hope from such a trifling distillation of one single
Drop succeeding another; and warm Water pumped
upon any diseased part, not only acts by pressure, but
has other effects in common with cold Water applied in
the same manner, a practice which I will venture to re∣commend
as a very powerful and salutary method of ap∣plication.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hipp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rates,</HI> in his Chapter <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, expresly says, That swellings in the joints, together with gouty pains in the feet, are ex∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uated and eased by a plentiful affusion of cold Water. And the same method of practice was adopted by <HI>Celsus,</HI> who, in treating of arthritical pains, observes, That if they are attended with tumour and heat, refrigerants are proper; and therefore orders the parts affected to be plunged and even de∣tained in the coldest Water, tho' not for any length of time; nor would he have this practised every day, lest the tendons should be contracted, and grow stiff. We are also informed by <HI>Aetius,</HI> that <HI>Archigenes</HI> recommended the same remedy, on the same occasions.</NOTE></P>
<P>If a white swelling of the Joint, or contraction of the
<HI>Flexor Tendons</HI> of the knee, be subjected to a temporary
cascade of cold Water, the part affected, instead of sus∣taining
a continued and equal pressure, as would be the
case, were it immersed in the Bath, undergoes a succes∣sion
of impulses from the falling stream, infinitely more
delicate and effectual than any kind of dry <HI>Friction;</HI> for
while the obstructed and stagnating Fluids are (as it were)
driven from the places of their confinement, by the re∣peated
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
strokes of the Water, the momentary interval be∣twixt
every shock, gives more play to the elastic sides
of the small vessels, and creates an <HI>oscillatory</HI> Motion,
which helps to divide the preternatural <HI>Moleculae</HI> of the
impacted juices, thereby rendring them more fit for the
purposes of minute circulation; at the same time, the
sudden dash of a cold fluid, acts as a <HI>Stimulus,</HI> upon
the relaxed or obstructed Tubes which assist in the
general <HI>Nisus,</HI> by a succession of extraordinary contrac∣tions.</P>
<P>What passes within the obstructed vessel, when the
stagnating fluid is propelled, hath been curiously describ∣ed
by <HI>Leeuwenhoeck,</HI> who, in the membranous expansion
that serves instead of a wing to a bat, observed, by the
help of his glasses, the first tendency to <HI>Resolution</HI> in the
blood which had been totally congealed by cold: at first,
he could perceive no motion either in the arteries or veins,
until the animal reviving by degrees, he beheld an oblong
mass of concreted blood, which filled the whole cavity of
the artery, begin to move backwards and forwards in the
vessel, which, by its successive contractions, gradually dis∣solved
the <HI>Coagulum,</HI> so as to render the whole fit for cir∣culation.
Here, indeed, the obstruction was thawed by
the revival of natural heat, and the motion first began in
the fluid; but, in Pumping, the <HI>Resolution</HI> is immediately
owing to the contraction of the vessel, occasioned by the
effects of the Water upon the nervous system.—Perhaps,
too, the imagination is concerned, being acted upon by a
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
certain timidity of expectation between every stroke of the
falling fluid.—That fancy operates with great power up∣on
the human body, is so evident in all <HI>hypochondriac</HI> and
<HI>hysteric</HI> disorders, that it would be idle and superfluous to
call in the evidence of facts in support of a truth so well
known.</P>
<P>Excess of passion hath often proved fatal both to men
and women, and the common symptoms of fear indicate a
total contraction of the animal machine: the blood is
driven from the cheeks, and surface of the body, to∣wards
the head, heart, and other internal parts, whence
palpitations, throbbings in the arteries of the brain, and
a general constriction of the whole fibrile system.—<HI>Van
Swieten</HI> relates the case of a woman in good health, who,
from a sudden fright, was seized with a tumour in one of
her breasts, which, in spite of the most skilful treatment,
hardened into a confirmed <HI>Schirrus:</HI> it is a constant ob∣servation,
that, when soldiers march to battle, there is a∣mong
them a remarkable evacuation by stool; and I know
an instance of a woman, who, being apprehended on a
criminal accusation, was so terrified when the officers of
justice appeared, that her urine and <HI>Faeces</HI> were expelled
with incredible force.</P>
<P>The cure of <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> by the application of the hand of a
person who hath been hanged, can be accounted for no
other way but from the coldness of the cadaver, the friction
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
of the member, and the power of imagination. Neither
is this to be reckoned among those idle remedies that owe
their credit to the superstitious fables of old women: I
knew a young gentleman of good sense, who had a large
<HI>strumous</HI> swelling upon one side of his neck, and submit∣ted
it to this application, which, (he owned) had a re∣markable
effect upon his spirits, from that natural antipa∣thy
which almost every body has to the touch of a corpse:
for some days, his imagination dwelt upon the experi∣ment
with a kind of horror that seemed to thrill, in re∣peated
vibrations, from the part, which began to put on
a more inflammatory appearance, and, I make no doubt,
would have been altogether dissolved by frequent repetition
of the same medicine, which, (however) he refused to un∣dergo.—</P>
<P>It was, doubtless, from such effects of fancy, that our
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings, of old, derived their power of healing <HI>scrophulous</HI>
distempers by the touch; a poor diseased wretch, of low
station, and weak intellects, prepossessed with the super∣stitious
notion of a delegated power from Heaven, and
struck with the <HI>Apparatus,</HI> as well as with the sublime
rank of the <HI>Operator,</HI> acting in the double capacity of a∣postle
and king, could not fail to be extremely affected
through the whole system of the nerves, and suffer such
agitations in the blood and spirits, as might work great
changes in the constitution: yet these effects would vary
according to the different dispositions of different patients,
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
and their various situations in life.—But to return from
this digression, <HI>Pumping</HI> is attended with another conse∣quence,
which, in all probability, adds to its salutary ef∣fect:
the Water, in its fall, is broke into very minute par∣ticles,
by the resistance of the air, as well as by its dashing
against the diseased limb, and the cistern or pavement
that receives it; so that the atmosphere is loaded with a
kind of mist, which being kept in motion by the <HI>Pump∣ing,</HI>
may act by way of <HI>Fomentation</HI> upon the part affect∣ed.
True it is, the coldness of the fluid seems to contra∣dict
this supposition, because it is the known property of
cold to contract the pores of the skin, consequently, to
refuse admission to those floating corpuscles: but Water,
suspended in separate globules, has not that aggregate cold∣ness
which we find in a collected mass; therefore we are
not to suppose the <HI>vasa inhiantia</HI> on the surface of the bo∣dy
altogether shut: and it is well known that the parti∣cles
of cold Water are more penetrating, because they are
more contracted than those of hot Water: <HI>for fire with
all its force, however applied and continued to Water, can
never divide its compenont particles, or make them smaller;
but, on the contrary, will enlarge their bulk, and strongly
agitate them, one among another; and Water rendered as
cold as possible, may pass through pores which it could not
enter while hot.</HI>—At any rate such an agitated mist will
produce an undulation in the air, which operating upon
the surface of the body, will assist and promote a brisk
circulation in the blood and animal juices.—In the neigh∣bourhood
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
of every <HI>Cataract,</HI> or <HI>Cascade,</HI> whether natural,
or artificial, there is, (if I may be allowed the expression,)
a cold, vapour Bath of this kind, which might be con∣verted
to useful purposes, could the agitated steam be col∣lected
in a proper receiver, without destroying its motion,
and directed in full Stream to the part affected, whether
<HI>Ecchymosis,</HI> indolent Tumor, or contracted Tendon.—We
known from <HI>Hydraulics,</HI> that such a steam is obtained, and
might be easily and commodiously conveyed by a tube three
hundred feet high, through which Water precipitated would
be so broke and attenuated by the resistance of the air,
and the sides of the pipe, as to issue at the lower end in
form of a thick mist: but this would not be the case, if
the descent was less than three hundred feet; and there∣fore,
the expedient is not likely to be tried.</P>
<P>Having thus singified my opinion touching the use of
common Water in the <HI>cold Bath,</HI> and in <HI>Pumping;</HI> I shall
now communicate my sentiments of the <HI>warm Bath,</HI> and
<HI>hot Fomentation,</HI> which, when properly used, are certain∣ly
very effectual remedies in many disorders of the human
frame, even when the Water is free from all mineral im∣pregnation.</P>
<P>Warm Water is of all fluids the most mild and inoffen∣sive;
insomuch, that, when applied to parts of the most
exquisite feeling, it gives no pain; on the contrary, in
ulcerated Cancer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when the nerves are corroded, laid
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
bare, and smart with every other application, this alone
mitigates the t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rture.</P>
<P>It is not my province to expatiate upon the virtues of
this element when used internally; I shall, therefore, li∣mit
my observations to the outward use of it, in the differ∣ent
forms of <HI>Pedil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>viam, Semicupium, universal Bath,</HI> and
<HI>Fomentation.</HI> Bathing the feet in warm Water, is known
to be an efficacious remedy in the <HI>Head-ach, Vertigo,
c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nvu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sive Asthma, dry Cough, hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>hyste∣rical
Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orders, Palpitations of the Heart, Obstructions
of the M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nses,</HI> and all cases, where it is necessary to make
a revulsion from the head, and to invite the juices down∣wards:
nay even in <HI>ardent inflammatory Fevers,</HI> I have
known it used to great advantage, for taking off the
tension and rigidity of the skin, assuaging the extreme
drought, and procuring sleep to the restless patient: Yet
this practice is condemned by a great many ingenious
Physicians, who affirm, that the heat, by rarifying the
blood increases the fever; and that the pressure of the
Water upon the extremities, being eight hundred times
greater than that of Air, must of consequence drive the
contained fluids towards the head and heart with a most
dangerous impetuosity: but, the resistance of the fluids
is an over-match for this pressure, great as it is; for it
will be found that the feet, even while immersed in the
Bath, are considerably swelled beyond their natural di∣mensions;
and this must be entirely owing to a relaxa∣tion
of the vessels; or at least, to their distension from
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
an extraordinary <HI>Impetus</HI> of their contents.—After all,
it is a question with me, whether the vapour of the <HI>Pe∣diluvium,</HI>
may not contribute to its good effects, by act∣ing
as a <HI>Fomentation,</HI> upon the parts of the body con∣tiguous
to the Bath; for I have frequently observed
that the suppleness and moisture of the skin, that ma∣nifest
a restored perspiration, begin to be perceivable
upon the legs and thighs of the patient, who has had
recourse to this expedient.</P>
<P>The <HI>Semicupium</HI> has the advantage over the <HI>Pedilu∣vium,</HI>
in many diseases of the <HI>Viscera:</HI> In <HI>Cholic Pains,</HI>
and <HI>spasmodic Contractions</HI> of the intestinal canals, and in
violent constrictions of the tender membranous tubes,
(such as the <HI>Ductus Cysticus, Ureters</HI> and <HI>Urethra</HI>) when
they are blocked up and irritated by rough and angular
concretions.</P>
<P>But the most effectual use of the warm Bath, is sup∣posed
to be that wherein the whole body is immersed: In∣deed,
the warm Bath is so well understood in its Ano∣dyne
capacity, that every body (almost) after the fatigue
of a journey, or other hard exercise, has recourse to the
Bagnio for refreshment: and so agreeable is the opera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
of this medicine, that in ancient times, as well as in
these days, it has been considered as a point of luxury
and pleasure; witness those magnificent Baths of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
described by <HI>Pli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, Vitruvius,</HI> and other eminent
writers of antiquity: together with the constant practice
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
of many modern voluptuaries.—Nothing, surely, yields
a more easy sensation than that which we feel in a Bath
of pure, simple Water moderately warm: that expansion
of nervous <HI>Fibrillae</HI> stretched to almost every point in the
surface of the body, is, as it were, unbended into a plea∣sing
state of relaxation; and a charming indolence or
<HI>Languor</HI> steals upon the spirits.</P>
<P>The warm Bath conduces to the restoration of health,
by rendring the rigid fibres more pliable and supple; by
washing away those unctuous and <HI>acrid</HI> impurities, which
are apt to obstruct the pores, corrode the nerves and dis∣order
the perspiration; by enlarging the openings of the
cuticular strainer, and inviting the fluids towards the sur∣face;
by reviving the natural heat, and causing an <HI>Oscil∣latory</HI>
motion, which will restore to parts that are cold,
insensible and contracted, their former warmth, functions
and flexibility: and in a languid circulation, proceeding
from a <HI>Viscidity</HI> of the juices, the warm Bath will be
serviceable by encreasing the velocity of the blood,
which is agitated and attenuated by the rarefaction of the
heat within, and the pressure of the Water without the
vessels.</P>
<P>From these effects of the warm Bath, it must be sa∣lutary
in <HI>paralytic Disorders, contracted Sinews, spasmodic
Affections</HI> of the <HI>Nerves, hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>hysterical
Cases,</HI> Obstructions of the <HI>Menses, Haemorrhoids</HI> and <HI>Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>piration;</HI>
the Scurvy, venereal Distemper, and all diseases,
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
the causes of which are to be discharged through the
<HI>Emunctories</HI> of the skin; accordingly there is often an a∣mazing
quantity of foul humours, expelled into the <HI>Bath</HI>
from this outlet. In the <HI>German</HI> Miscellanies, we read
of a woman afflicted with a pain in her loins, who after
having tried other remedies in vain, found nothing gave
her so much relief as warm Bathing, upon the use of
which, a gross, <HI>unctuous</HI> matter was found floating upon
the water, and might have been taken off with a spoon.
There is likewise another history of an <HI>hypochondriacal</HI>
man, who upon using the warm <HI>Bath,</HI> found also such a
scum, which grew every day more and more <HI>corrosive,</HI>
and smelled so foetid, that they were obliged to infuse
fresh herbs to correct the noisome stench, as well as the
<HI>Acrimony</HI> of the water, which even affected the hand
of the rubber; and this <HI>Excretion</HI> continued until the
patient was quite recovered. Indeed, (as Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI>
observes) such an <HI>unctuous</HI> matter is observable in
the <HI>Baths</HI> at Bagnios, after they have been used by
persons apparently in health.—Among the Ancients, this
remedy was always applied to those who were bit by a
mad dog, even after they were seized with the <HI>Hydro∣phobia;</HI>
and <HI>Hoffman,</HI> from the information of a phy∣sician
of <HI>Duderstad,</HI> gives an account of a mad wolf,
that coming out of the woods, bit several persons, who
died of the bite; till at length, by the advice of an ordi∣nary
man, some others who had met with the same mis∣fortune,
had recourse to the use of a moderately hot
Bath; having first taken a dose of <HI>Theriaca Veneta,</HI> and
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>Dog-R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se;</HI> and by these means repeat∣ed
every day, were delivered from the terrible conse∣quences
of the poison. It must be owned, however, that
in these cases, part of the credit of the cure, was due
to the <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngia Cynorr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odi,</HI> which is a very powerful <HI>Diu∣retick,</HI>
and of such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficacy in a great many distempers,
as to have obtained in <HI>Sicily,</HI> the epither of <HI>Sanatados</HI>
or <HI>All-h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al.</HI>—And here it will not be unseasonable to
observe the difference of practice among the ancients, as
well as moderns, in treating patients bit by a mad dog,
with regard to the article of Bathing.—<HI>Celsus</HI> says, that
some practitioners of his time, ordered the patient imme∣diately
into the warm <HI>Bath,</HI> that he might sweat plenti∣fully,
while his strength was sufficient to undergo that
evacuation, and that the poison might have an opportu∣nity
to distil from the open wound; then he was re∣galed
with a good quantity of Sheer wine, which they
considered as an antidote to all poisons; and by this me∣thod
repeated for three days, he was supposed to be out
of all danger: but <HI>Celsus</HI> himself orders the wound to be
<HI>cupped,</HI> then <HI>cauterized</HI> or seared (if the part is not ner∣vous
or tendinous) and afterwards treated as a common
<HI>Burn.</HI>—In the <HI>Hydr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phobia,</HI> which he looks upon as a
very dangerous symptom, he says, the only remedy is to
plunge the patient unawares into a fish-pond, and duck
him in it several times, so as that he shall be compelled
to swallow a great quantity of the Water; by which his
thirst may be quenched, and his abhorrence of the fluid
at the same time removed.—Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> practice of almost drown∣ing
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
the patient, Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> observes, was revived in the begin∣ing
of the last century; and though he thinks such seve∣rity
altogether unreasonable, he prescribes the cold <HI>Bath</HI>
to be used for a considerable length of time, from the ac∣cident
of the bite; and ascribes its efficacy to the pressure
of the Water upon the surface of the body, and the con∣striction
the cold makes upon the fibres of the skin and
the small tubes; whereby the distension of the vessels by
the fermenting humours is repressed; and a flux of urine
promoted for so many days, that all danger of the ner∣vous
fever, the consequent of the instilled poison, is quite
over. He likewise, in this case, condemns the use of the
Warm <HI>Bath,</HI> as productive of an inflammatory heat, which
occasions a dangerous distension of the vessels. But how
shall we reconcile this opinion with that of the accurate,
the experienced <HI>Hoffman,</HI> who pronounces the use of the
Cold Bath, precarious and uncertain, and recommends
Warm Bathing as serviceable in bringing the subtile Ve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m
to the surface of the body, where it finds a free exit?
I believe both the one and the other may be successfully
used on this occasion, under proper cautions and restric∣tions.
Warm Bathing, in the beginning, will relax the
fibres, widen the strainer of the skin, quicken the circula∣tion,
and promote the secretions of urine and sweat, by
which the <HI>Virus</HI> may be discharged before it has had time
to produce any dangerous distension of the vessels; and
even after the <HI>Hydrophobia</HI> hath begun to rage it may be
serviceable in relaxing and removing that convulsive con∣striction
of the nerves, which prevails in divers parts of
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
the body, and is the immediate cause of that direful sym∣ptom;
while, at the same time, it may sollicit a critical
evacuation from the skin, or some other emunctory of the
body, without distending the vessels beyond a possibility
of retrieving their tone.—On the other hand, a sudden
immersion into Cold water communicates a spring to the
whole nervous system, by which the solids are strengthen∣ed,
contracted, and stimulated, to propell the juices with
additional force, the velocity of the blood is increased;
consequently all the secretions are augmented, and a glow∣ing
warmth being generated on the surface of the skin, is
commonly followed by a profuse sweat: thus the vessels
are supported against the rarefaction supposed to be pro∣duced
by the <HI>Virus,</HI> which may likewise be expelled a∣mong
the promoted secretions of the body: but I am far
from thinking it unnecessary to harrass and affright the
patient in the Cold <HI>Bath:</HI> for, if the intention is to induce
a strong contraction in the solids, nothing more effectually
accomplishes that aim, than such treatment as inspires the
passions of anger and fear. There is upon record, a fa∣mous
instance of a lady of very high rank, who was cured
of the <HI>Palsy</HI> by an affront and mortification purposely of∣fered
to her pride, whereby she was seized with a fever of
indignation.—I have known a gentleman who was <HI>para∣lytic</HI>
to a deplorable degree, enraged to a perfect use of all
his limbs, while his anger predominated: I have seen per∣sons
under the influence of a <HI>Pannic,</HI> ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt their muscles
in an incredible manner; and in some parts of this island
it hath been a common practice in the <HI>Mania</HI> and bite of
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
the mad dog, to reinforce the power of the Cold <HI>Bath,</HI>
by shutting up the patient alone, and properly secured, in a
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>litary church, where his fancy might be haunted all
night long, with images of superstitious terror.</P>
<P>But, to return to Warm Bathing: the use of it is in no∣thing
more successful, than in <HI>maniac</HI> disorders, whether
of the melancholy or frantic species: both these are owing
to a disordered circulation in the brain, occasioned by a
thick foul viscosity in the juices, which, by a nervous con∣strict<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on
of the lower parts, are forcibly driven upwards,
yielding an impure and interrupted secretion of the animal
spirits, and disturbing their containing vessels, so as to cre∣ate
various <HI>Chimaeras</HI> in the imagination. In this case,
the Warm Bath is eminently serviceable, by <HI>softening,
suppling, and relaxing the nervous parts, opening by its
warmth and moisture, the cold and hardened skin, and thus
deriving the course of the blood upon the habit of the body,
and giving it a free and general circulation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hoffman,</HI> who is very full in the praises of this reme∣dy,
observes, that, in cases of madness, he had prescribed
it with surprising success, after <HI>Bleeaing, nitrous</HI> and <HI>dilut∣ing</HI>
medicines; and wonders, that a practice so much de∣pended
upon by the ancients, should be almost entirely
neglected by the physicians of these days. <HI>Hippocrates,
Galen, Celsus, and the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thodists, held the use of Bathing
in great esteem for the cure o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vers, especially of the in∣termitting
kind; and this chi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fly in the interval between
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fits, or when the fit is going off; or even in the
beginning of an ardent fever.</HI> In this last circumstance
it is administred to this day by the <HI>Negroes</HI> in the
West-Indies, the <HI>Bath</HI> being medicated with emollient
herbs, which enrich the Water with a mucilage that adds
to its softening and relaxing virtues. By these means a
vent is often procured for the obstructed perspiration, be∣fore
the heat occasioned by its detention hath increased so
as to produce a total putrefaction of the juices.</P>
<P>Besides these uses of the Warm Bath, it is of great service
in promoting delivery, by relaxing the parts in those wo∣men
who are turned of thirty before the first child; and
in such as are naturally contracted in consequence of a ri∣gid
fibre, and robust constitution, which is the case with
all those healthy young women, of a florid complexion,
who live in the country, and are used to hard exercise;
insomuch that a country practitioner told me, he found
great difficulty in delivering his patients, until he had re∣course
to the Warm <HI>Bath,</HI> for relaxing and rendering the
parts more dilatable.</P>
<P>Having considered these effects of the Warm Bath, con∣sisting
of pure Water only. I am inclined to believe, that
the Mineral Principles in Hot Springs, have often, in the
cure of patients by Bathing, usurped that praise and repu∣tation
which was really due to the simple element; and
that the external use of common Water, properly warmed,
would have the same, or nearly the same, effect in the
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
gout, which an ingenious physician attributes to the <HI>sapo∣nac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous</HI>
and <HI>sulp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urcous Parti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les</HI> with which the Waters
of <HI>Bath</HI> are impregnated—That a <HI>Pedduvium</HI> made of
good soft Water warmed, is of service in solliciting the
gouty matter to the extremities, is an incontestible truth;
and, doubtless, the operation of its heat upon the contain∣ed
fluids, may produce such a gentle fever as will be suffi∣cient
to <HI>grind</HI> that matter small enough to circulate thro'
the finer passages, in order to be discharged by sweat,
urine, or stool.—</P>
<P>Howsoever minute and volatile those Mineral Particles
may be, I very much question, whether they will find easy
admission into the blood, by the small <HI>inbaling</HI> vessels of
the skin, while they are confined in a ponderous fluid, that
surrounds the surface of the body, and by a considerable pres∣sure,
<HI>quaquaversum,</HI> blocks up the very pores through which
only they can enter; and such obstruction may be increased
by the astringency which those Minerals impart to the Waters
of the Bath: so that, instead of opening, softening, relaxing,
and purifying, they will, (exclusive of their additional weight
and pressure, which are greater in these than in common
Water,) be apt to contract the pores, crisp up the fibres,
harden the surface of the skin, and leave upon it a sort of
mineral crust, which may corrode, and hurt, the tender,
nervous papillae, produce a disagreeable itching and heat,
and totally disorder the perspiration. As to the volatile
parts in which the chief virtues reside, they are continu∣ally
flying off in a perpendicular direction; so that they
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
can have little effect upon the body <HI>immersed.</HI>—This
supposition is partly confirmed by experiment: for there
are many hot sulphureous Wells upon the continent, in
which a piece of silver being <HI>immersed,</HI> will receive no
stain; whereas, when suspended over the steam of the
same Waters, it soon acquires a fine yellow colour. Mr.
<HI>Boyle,</HI> in his history of air, says he found a certain metal
more suddenly and evidently affected, by being sustained
in the air, over the fumes of a <HI>menstruum,</HI> than it was
when totally covered by the <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstruum</HI> itself: and it is
commonly observed, that in a moist air, occasioned by a
plentiful evaporation, iron guns will contract rust in a
shorter time, and much larger quantity, than if they were
actually sunk in sea Water.—These observations, though
they do not altogether disprove the common notions of a
Mineral Hot <HI>Bath,</HI> at least invalidate its supposed effects;
and plainly demonstrate, that the subtile and volatile
parts are more efficaciously communicated in <HI>Vapour</HI> or
<HI>Fomentation,</HI> which is the method of using the Waters,
which we now come to consider.</P>
<P>The ancients used the <HI>Vapour Bath</HI> composed of natu∣ral
Hot Steams, which, rising from the earth, were received
under a proper Arch, or Hot-house: but this was solely with
a view to procure sweat; for which purpose they also had
recourse to a dry heat, such as Hot Sand, Horse Dung,
Stove Rooms, and artificial Bagnios; together with the
method of <HI>insolation,</HI> in which the patient was exposed to
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
the sun-beams, that they might exhale the peccant hu∣mours
in some chronical distempers.</P>
<P><HI>Fomentation</HI> is so frequently used, and so well under∣stood,
in all external inslammations, that it would be su∣perfluous
to describe either the manner of applying <HI>Stu∣pes,</HI>
or the common disorders in which they are benefi∣cial.
They have often stopt the progress of a <HI>Gangrenc,</HI>
discussed the <HI>ven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>real Phimosis,</HI> and <HI>Hernia humoralis,</HI>
and allayed the pain, and removed the tension of the <HI>Ery∣sipelas:</HI>
the Vapour of hot Water, breathing through the
pores of a bladder, hath assuaged the torture of the <HI>pleu∣ritic
Stitch,</HI> and even dissolved its cause; and the <HI>Angina</HI>
is often cured by the steam of this fluid, received into the
mouth, through a <HI>Funnel,</HI> or the spout of a tea-kettle,
under the cover of a blanket, which, by detaining the <HI>Ef∣fluvia,</HI>
encourages a total <HI>Diaphoresis</HI> of the head: nay,
in <HI>strumous</HI> swellings of the neck, <HI>Van Swieten</HI> observes,
that all other <HI>discutients</HI> will be of little service, unless the
parts affected be frequently <HI>somented</HI> with the vapour of
hot Water; and he relates the case of a stiff joint from the
<HI>Induration</HI> of the ligaments, which, in two months, per∣fectly
recovered its motion and <HI>Flexibility,</HI> by being ex∣posed
to the steam of hot Water, for an hour every day.</P>
<P>That this <HI>Vapour</HI> is a most powerful dissolvent, is in∣disputably
proved from its effects in <HI>Papin's Digestor,</HI>
which are so violent as, in a few minutes, to reduce the
hardest bone into the consistence of a jelly: nor is the effi∣cacy
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
of this <HI>Vapour</HI> upon the human body, to be wonder∣ed
at, when we consider into what minute particles that
fluid is divisible, and what millions of <HI>inhaling Vessels</HI>
gape upon the surface of the skin: for, according to <HI>Leeu∣wenb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>'s
computation, upwards of one hundred thousand
of them may be covered with one grain of sand.</P>
<P>The steam of hot Water therefore, not only relaxes the
sides of the obstructed vessels, so as to allow the humours
to pass, but, also acts as a <HI>diluent,</HI> after having insinuated
itself into the circulation: for, with respect to the <HI>fluids</HI>
of the human body, nothing is so powerful in <HI>diluting</HI> and
<HI>atte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uating,</HI> as Water, which, in the language of the <HI>A∣depts,</HI>
being changed by the <HI>Seminale Principium,</HI> is the
universal <HI>Cement</HI> of all things, and that, into which, by the
efforts of nature and of art, all things may be resolved:
but, over and above these effects, the <HI>Vapour,</HI> in relaxing
the vessels, lessens their resistance, by which means, the
circulating juices flow thither with increased <HI>Momentum,</HI>
and sweep before them all remains of the obstructed mat∣ter;
accordingly, we see the part begin to swell and red∣den,
in the same manner as when cupping-glasses are ap∣plied,
in order to make a <HI>Revulsion,</HI> by removing the pres∣sure
of the <HI>Atmosphere.</HI></P>
<P>Although such benefits are obtained from the <HI>Vapour</HI>
of simple hot Water; we know how to reinforce its vir∣tues,
so as to render it much more efficacious; and readi∣ly
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
allow, that, in this form, the hot mineral Springs are
applied to great advantage.</P>
<P>The steam of common Water is enriched by the infusi∣on
of vegetables, as well as by the solution of salts: for all
the fine, <HI>aromatic</HI> particles of vegetables are <HI>volatile,</HI> and
continually flying off; consequently adapted for entering
the smallest order of vessels, along with the <HI>Vapours</HI> in
which they rise; and this is eminently the case with all
<HI>acid</HI> and <HI>urinous</HI> salts.—The air is always impregnated
with the finer parts, and native spirit of those vegetables
that grow upon the surface of the earth: thus, while we
sail along the coasts of those countries that abound with
<HI>aromatic</HI> plants and trees, we are regaled with their <HI>odori∣ferous
exhalations,</HI> even at a great distance from the shore.
Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> from the report of an ingenious physician, in∣forms
us, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> having destroyed almost all the
cloye-trees that grew upon the island <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnate,</HI> with a view
to enhance the value of their spice, such a change in the
temper of the air immediately ensued, as plainly proved,
that the <HI>aromatic Fragrance,</HI> exhaled from the blossoms
of those trees, had corrected the natural unwholesomness
of the clime, for the whole island became very unhealthy;
a circumstance (as the physician imagined) owing to the
<HI>corrosive</HI> steams of a <HI>Vulcano,</HI> the ill effects of which had
been prevented by the spicy <HI>Effluvia</HI> of the trees.—The
<HI>Volatility</HI> of many salts is perfectly well known: that there
are numberless <HI>saline Corpuscles</HI> floating in the air, is
proved by a thousand different experiments: the <HI>Vehicle</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
of all these is Water; and many more which the sun
hath not power to raise, may be driven upwards by the
hot steam of that fluid.—The <HI>attenuating</HI> qualities of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>Sea S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le,</HI> are remarkable in their ef∣fects
upon the human body: by an excessive use of the
last, the blood is sometimes so dissolved as to burst from
the vessels in dangerous <HI>Haemorrhages;</HI> and a solution of
<HI>Sal Amm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niacus</HI> in Water, externally applied to a contu∣sion,
will surprizingly dissolve the <HI>coagulated</HI> blood.</P>
<P>Minerals are also <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by chemical operations.
Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> says, he had once in his possession, a spirit pro∣cured
by a combination of salts with <HI>metallic</HI> bodies, so
volati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that it would all fly away in the open air, without
being heated, and so corrosive as to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rode</HI> the glass stopple
of the <HI>Vial</HI> in which it was contained—What is effected
by Art, is sometimes performed by Nature, in the bowels
of the earth.—The effects of subterraneous fire are mani∣fest
in the eruptions of every <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lcano;</HI> in <HI>Earthquakes,

the ancients, <HI>Mephi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s:</HI> but, in nothing are they more
conspicuous, than in those <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmae,</HI> or hot Springs, which
now claim my observation.</P>
<P>There is in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Waters, for the most
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which is not easily re∣tained

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the very instant of drinking.
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
Though this very subtile spirit is, in part, dissipated by the
heat of the <HI>Thermae,</HI> yet the <HI>Vapour</HI> of those hot Waters is
certainly impregnated with <HI>sulphurcous</HI> particles, or a <HI>volatile
Vitri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of Iron,</HI> which cannot fail to operate powerfully
on the surface of the human body, and introduce them∣selves
within the laws of circulation, not only by the pores
of the skin, but also by the <HI>Saliva</HI> and <HI>Respiration.</HI> The
air contiguous to the bathing places at <HI>Bath,</HI> in <HI>Somerset∣shire,</HI>
is surcharged with <HI>Sulphur</HI> to such a degree, as to
be very offensive to tender lungs; and those <HI>Vertigos</HI> and
<HI>Palpitations</HI> with which some of the Bathers are seized,
may be partly owing to the <HI>Mineral Effluvia</HI> operating
upon the nervous membrane of the nose, as well as to the
heat and pressure upon the parts that are immersed.</P>
<P>By this time, you will have perceived the whole of my
opinion, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ching the external use of mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eral Waters, whe∣ther
<HI>Acidulae,</HI> or <HI>Thermae:</HI> that, in point of Bathing, they
are not preferable, not even equal to pure simple element,
except in those cases, where their <HI>styptic</HI> or <HI>astringent</HI> qua∣lity
may be of service, namely in some particular kinds of
ulcers, and <HI>oedematous</HI> swellings; and that, in general, the
most effectual way of applying them externally is in form
of <HI>Vapour,</HI> whether conveyed to one particular part, or
extended to the whole surface of the skin: yet this method,
so safe and salutary, approved by every physician of can∣dour,
learning, and experience, hath never been practised
at <HI>Bath,</HI> which is the great hospital of the nation, frequent∣ed
by almost all the valetudinarians whose lives are of any
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
consequence to the commonwealth. This defect, together
with the inconveniences and danger that attend those who
bathe in this place, must occur at once to a judicious ob∣server:
nevertheless, they have been overlooked with the
most supercilious and willful neglect by the Corporation,
which has even rejected the earnest and repeated remon∣strances
of those who have tasked their ingenuity to con∣trive
schemes for rendering their Waters more safe and ser∣viceable.—The
same indolence, or indifference, prevails
among the managers and directors of their hospital: for,
although, in the plan which was handed about to sollicit
subscriptions, they observed, that, by the execution of it,
many parishes would be cased of the burthen of their poor
cripples; that the knowledge and use of the Bath Waters
would be greatly improved, to the benefit of all succeed∣ing
generations; and that the hospital would, in a few
years, furnish more histories of cases that might be de∣pended
upon, than could possibly occur in private prac∣tice,
during a whole age; the public hath not, as yet,
been favoured with the history of one cure performed un∣der
the auspices of that charity. Dr. <HI>Summers,</HI> physician
in that place, hath indeed, of late, published an accurate
account of the success of Warm B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thing in paralytic dis∣orders,
and, from the books of the hospital, favoured us
with a list of all the paralytic patients who have received
benefit from the use of the Bath. So far the public is ob∣liged
to that gentleman: but, as he himself justly observes,
the same public <HI>hath a right to be informed how far their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> intentions have been answered; and what good their
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
Benevolence has produced:</HI> and this information can only
be conveyed in a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccinct detail of all the cases in which
the Warm Bath has proved serviceable or deterimental.
Many people were induced to contribute largely, by these
arguments which were equally solid and specious: from
the regularity of patients in an hospital, they hoped to see
the uses and virtues of the Waters ascertained; and did not
doubt that their success upon such as were restricted to the
most exact regimen, under the immediate eye and direc∣tion
of physicians, would encourage others to imitate the
same regularity, and, of consequence, bring a greater con∣course
of people to <HI>Bath.</HI>—A satisfaction of this kind, is
what the public, in general, has reason to expect, and every
subscriber, in particular, a right to demand; and that the
world hath been hitherto disappointed on this score, must
be owing to a shameful laziness in those who belong to the
hospital, in a medical capacity; or to a reserve in the di∣rectors,
which is equally unaccountable and unjust, and
very ill becomes the trustees of a voluntary subscription.</P>
<P>In the progress of may inquiries, touching the external
use of the Bath Waters, I understood that the physicians
and surgeons residing at that place, had presented a me∣morial
to the mayor, and corporation, desiring they would
petition the parliament, to enable them to make several
alterations in the Baths, which are necessary for the good
of the public. To this memorial they received an an∣swer,
importing that they would by no means apply to
parliament, but, so far as their own power extended, do
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
every thing for the advantage and improvement of the
Baths; and they desired that those necessary alterations
should be specified. Accordingly, the gentlemen of the
faculty held another consultation, at which Mr. <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land,</HI>
Surgeon, presented a plan for that purpose, which was
read, and referred to the report of a committee appointed
to examine the particulars of it, with more attention. De∣sirous
of knowing the nature of these proposed alterations,
I addressed myself to that gentleman, whom I found to
be of a very communicative disposition; he not only fa∣voured
me with a copy of his plan, which, for the satis∣faction
of the public, shall (by his permission) be printed
as an appendix to this essay, but, also, communicated to
me, the remarks he had made on the Bath, and a very
ingenious apparatus he had contrived, for some complaints
peculiar to the fair sex, as well as for sweating any parti∣cular
part of the body, with the steam or vapour of those
Waters. This was a piece of satisfaction he had never re∣fused
to any person of the least consideration, whether a
foreigner, or of our own country. The machinery, to∣gether
with the former proposals he had offered to the
same intent, had been approved of by most of the learned
men in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Bath,</HI> and presented to His late Roy∣al
Highness the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> by whose command they
were sent to Mr. <HI>Nash,</HI> with a desire that he would lay
them before the corporation, in his name—Yet, notwith∣standing
such powerful recommendation, the plan was ne∣ver
executed: on the contrary, a most rancourous spirit
of opposition was raised against the author, whose reputa∣tion
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
with the public could not fail to excite the malevo∣lence
of some narrow-minded people of the profession,
who had acquired plentiful fortunes by their practice,
without having made one improvement for the benefit of
their own patients, or the advantage of mankind: no
wonder, then, that they should take umbrage at Mr. <HI>Cle∣land</HI>'s
presuming to contrive methods for making the Wa∣ters
more safe and effectual, and endeavour to prevent the
success of his plan. The cruel treatment he underwent
upon that occasion, compelled him to appeal to the pub∣lic,
and the whole contest betwixt him and his adversaries
appeared in print; when he was allowed, by every unpre∣judiced
person, to have greatly the advantage in the dis∣pute.
At last, his enemies had recourse to the pen of an
author as notorious for the servile homage he yields to his
patrons, as for the insolence and scurrility with which he
treats all the world besides. True to these principles, this
champion published an anonymous letter to Mr. <HI>Cleland,</HI>
wherein, after a chain of false reasoning, twanged off in all
the arrogance of expression, some aukward attempts to iro∣nical
humour, and the most abusive low sarcasms, levelled
at a lady of distinction, and, indeed, at a whole nation,
on her account, he takes it for granted, that he has fully
proved the truth of his unjust allegations. This author
must have entertained a very contemptible idea of the un∣derstanding
and judgment of the public, if he hoped to
impose upon them by such an effusion of idle sophistry, in
the course of which, he is even driven to the subterfuge of
making false quotations: but his talents, as a commen∣tator,
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
are so well understood, and so justly celebrated, that
he had nothing further to fear for his reputation on that
score.</P>
<P>That the reader may distinctly perceive the necessity of
reforming those Baths, I shall here enumerate the incon∣veniencies
that attend the present method of using the Wa∣ters
externally; the knowledge of which, I, in a great
measure, owe to the information of Mr. <HI>Cleland.</HI></P>
<P>Diseased persons of all ages, sexes, and conditions, are
promiscuously admitted into an open Bath, which affords
little or no shelter from the inclemencies of the weather,
such as wind, rain, hail, and snow: for, by the peculiar
sagacity of the learned in that place, the bathing time is
limited to the most severe season of the year. This being
the case, it may be reasonably supposed, that many of the
fair sex are withheld by modesty from going into the Bath,
where they must not only mingle with male patients, to
whose persons and complaints they are utter strangers;
but, likewise, be exposed in a very mortifying point of
view, to the eyes of all the company, in the Pump-room,
as well as to those of the footmen and common people,
whose curiosity leads them to look over the walls of the
Bath: some may be apprehensive of being tainted with in∣fectious
distempers; or disgusted with the nauseating ap∣pearances
of the filth, which, being washed from the bo∣dies
of the patients, is left sticking to the sides of the
place.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37"/>
Although the king's and queen's Baths have been known
to contain five-and-forty patients at one time, the number
of guides does not exceed half a dozen of each sex; so
that if any of those Bathers who are unattended should be
seized with a sudden <HI>Vertigo,</HI> fit, or other accident, they
might lose their lives for want of proper assistance. But,
granting no such accident should happen, some of them,
on retiring from the Bath, must, from this defect in point
of attendance, remain in the wet bathing dress, until their
constitutions are greatly endangered. This inconvenience
is rendered more grievous by the nature of that dress,
which, being made of canvas, grows cold and clammy in
a moment, and clings to the surface of the body with a
most hazardous adhesion. If they should escape the con∣sequences
of both these risques, they may still be subject to
another, in being obliged to wait in a cold slip for their
respective chairs, which cannot always be brought to them
in proper time, because the passage is frequently blocked
up. After all, they are carried to their lodgings, while
their pores are open from the effects of the Bath, in paul∣try
chairs made of slight cross bars of wood, fastened to∣gether
with girth web, covered with bays, and, for the
most part, destitute of lining: these machines, by standing
in the street till called for, are often rendered so damp by
the weather, that the Bathers cannot use them without
imminent hazard of their lives.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38"/>
The slips, or places for undressing, are not only too few
in number, but, also, cold, damp, uncomfortable, and al∣together
improper for the use to which they are put; and,
lastly, the fine volatile parts of the Mineral are suffered to
evaporate, without being converted to any medical use.</P>
<P>From these considerations it plainly appears, that those
patients who are deprived of the use of their limbs, and in∣capable
of helping themselves, must be subject to great in∣convenience
and danger; and that, in all probability, many
persons of a delicate frame, and timorous disposition, are
altogether deterred from that way of using the Waters;
for these evils are not frivolous, or chimerical: every day
are heard complaints of the bad effects of Bathing; and if
these are minutely inquired into, they will be found (for
the most part) to proceed, not from the Water itself, but
from the inconveniencies attending the manner of Bathing.
I myself, who have had very little opportunity of seeing the
immediate consequences of the Bath, could produce seve∣ral
instances in which the patient's lungs were dangerous∣ly
affected by Cold, caught either in the Bath, in dres∣ing,
or in waiting for a chair.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cleland,</HI> urged by these considerations, formed an
easy and rational plan for rendering the Baths more safe
and commodious; and, as I have already observed, con∣trived
an apparatus for confining the vapour, and directing
it in full steam to any part of the body, as the exigency of
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
the case might require; a method of application which is,
of all others, undoubtedly, the most effectual, in the ex∣ternal
use of medicated Waters. He invented a close
warm chair, for conveying the patients to and from the
Bath, which hath since been imitated by the governors of
the hospital, as well as by many of the chairmen who ply
in the streets; and he proposed that a Bagnio should be
erected with proper conveniencies for Cupping, Sweating,
Bathing, Pumping, and Fomentation, and supplied by a
pipe from the kitchen or reservoir of the king's Bath. Such
an improvement would afford a safe, easy, and agreeable
accommodation to any of the royal family, who may, (as
heretofore) have occasion for the Waters; as well as to the
nobility and gentry, and those who want to refresh them∣selves
after the fatigue of a journey. People of remark∣able
delicacy, either in sentiment, or constitution, might
here receive the benefit of the Waters, in the most effectu∣al
manner, and avoid all the dangerous and disagreeable
circumstances of bathing in the open air: for it would be
an easy matter to temper the fluid to such a degree of
Warmth or Heat as might be necessary to the case of eve∣ry
particular patient; whereas, at present, all the Bathers
are obliged to undergo the same degree of heat, tho' the
various nature of their complaints, and constitutions, may
require a very essential difference.</P>
<P>Though the interest of the corporation was evidently
connected with the execution of this scheme, in order to
leave them absolutely without excuse, Mr. <HI>Cleland</HI> offered
to erect such a Bagnio at his own expence, and pay yearly
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
into the chamber of <HI>Bath,</HI> a reasonable consideration for
the use of their Water; or, if they would be at the charge
of building one according to his plan, to take a long lease
of it, at a certain yearly rent; to discover all his contri∣vances
for topical Fomentation; and to exert himself, to
the best of his power, for the advantage of the place.</P>
<P>These proposals, disinterested, just, and reasonable as
they are, which contain the most plain, easy, and effectu∣al
remedies for those evils and defects that are the continual
subject of complaint, have been, hitherto, neglected by the
very people who would reap the immediate advantage of
the proposed alterations; and Mr. <HI>Cleland,</HI> who must have
been at a considerable expence of money, time, and appli∣cation,
in bringing his schemes and machinery to per∣fection,
will, in all likelihood, see his designs for the pub∣lic
good still defeated by the same mean, selfish, and ma∣licious
arts, which have thwarted him so long; unless they
are overbalanced by the interposition of that authority
which hath power to examine and remove every thing
that appears an obstruction to a national advantage.</P>
<P>Narrow minds will ever have narrow views. The cor∣poration
of <HI>Bath</HI> seems to have forgot that the ease and
plenty they now enjoy, and to which their fathers were
strangers, are owing to their Waters; and that an im∣provement
upon their Baths, would, by bringing a greater
concourse of company to their town, perpetuate these
blessings to them and their posterity. How little is to be
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
expected from them, in this particular, might have been
guessed by their conduct to Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> the architect, to
whose extraordinary genius they are indebted for a great
part of the trade and beauty of the place: yet they have
industriously opposed his best designs, which, had they
been executed, would have rendered <HI>Bath,</HI> in point of e∣legant
architecture, the admiration of the whole World.
It is, therefore, to be hoped, there are still some among
us, whose exalted station, superior sense, and public spirit,
will be sufficient to interest the legislature in an affair
which is truly national, that the public may no longer suf∣fer
from the private claims, sordid passions, or selfish
views of any particular set of men. Those salutary Springs
are the gift of heaven, of such consequence to the health
of individuals, as to claim the particular protection of the
public; and <HI>Bath,</HI> under proper auspices, would soon ri∣val
the <HI>Baiae</HI> of the ancients; for it might easily be brought
to excell as much in beauty and convenience, as in the
salubrious efficacy of its Waters. In an age like this,
when such sums are expended by private persons, upon
works of magnificence and decoration; when such con∣siderable
aids are granted for the utility and encourage∣ment
of commerce; and our administration seems so well
disposed to consult, and promote, the wellfare of the
commonwealth; we have reason to believe, that some at∣tention
will be paid to those fountains flowing with health,
which, at a very moderate expence, might be so improved
as to become the greatest boast, ornament, and blessing of
these kingdoms.—But, if our expectations from the le∣gislature
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
should be disappointed, and the Corporation o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Bath</HI> still turn a deaf ear to the proposals which have been
made; the proprietors of other Baths, either in this, or in
any other country, will probably take the hints which they
have rejected, and then they may chance to see their
Springs deserted, and their town utterly impoverished and
ruined. This is far from being a vain apprehension; in
as much as some ingenious physicians from <HI>Portugal</HI> have
obtained models of Mr <HI>Cleland</HI>'s apparatus, and copies of
his plan, with a view to carry it into execution at the <HI>Cal∣das</HI>
near <HI>Lisbon;</HI> and I make no doubt that the people of
<HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> and the proprietors of the famous Hot
Wells in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> will seize
the first opportunity of improving those Waters, from
which they derive such advantage, in the concourse of
strangers which they draw together.</P>
<P>Indeed, Mr. <HI>Cleland</HI> seems to have waved all conside∣rations
of private emolument, in consenting that his own
name should not appear in the plan, but that it should be
offered as the joint opinion of all the physicians and sur∣geons
of <HI>Bath:</HI> but, in all probability, they are determin∣ed
to reject every thing that is known to come from his
quarter, how much soever it may tend to their own ho∣nour,
or the good of their fellow-creatures; for I am in∣formed
by a particular friend who lately came from that
place, that since his last scheme was presented, the physi∣cians
have come to a resolution to exclude all surgeons
from their consultations on this subject. This must be an
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
arrow directly levelled at him, (as it does not appear that
any other of his profession has proposed any thing worthy of
public notice) and justifies the old observation, that an in∣jured
person will never be forgiven by those who have done
him wrong. Nay, so industrious are his adversaries in the
prosecution of their enmity, that all methods, even the
lowest arts, are practised to prepossess the minds of stran∣gers
against him, by a most malicious misrepresentation of
his character; though, to those who will give themselves
the trouble of inquiring into the truth of facts, he will (I
am confident) appear to be a man of good morals, and
uncommon ability.</P>

<PB N="44" REF="44"/>
<HEAD>REGULATIONS proposed to the Mayor and
Corporation of BATH.</HEAD>
<P>I. THAT the king and queen's Bath be used
three days a week for ladies, and three days for
men, alternately.</P>
<P>II. That the Cross, and Hot Bath, be used three days
for ladies, and three days for men, alternately, differing
from those in the king and queen's Bath.</P>
<P>III. That no holidays be allowed as to bathing, except
<HI>Sundays.</HI></P>
<P>IV. That all female guides shall assist in either Baths,
those days on which the ladies bathe; and the men guides
do the same, those days on which the men bathe.</P>
<P>V. That a table of fees be established by the Mayor
and Corporation, to direct strangers in paying the serjeants,
guides, clothwomen, pumpers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>VI. That no serjeant, guide, clothwoman, pumper,
&amp;c. shall presume to take, or demand, from any stranger,
or other persons, more than is specified in the said table
of fees, under such penalty as the Mayor shall think fit.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="45"/>
VII. That a convenient number of close chairs be
appointed to attend every morning at the Baths, that all
strangers may know where to send for them; and that the
chairmen, so attending, be under the direction of the ser∣jeants;
the next chair to succeed, as at the Rooms, which
will prevent many complaints, and remedy a real grievance.</P>
<P>VIII. As it has been customary for strangers and
others, to give gratuities, over and above their stated fees,
to the serjeants, guides, clothwomen, pumpers, &amp;c. let it
be ordered for the future, that all moneys be paid into a
proper person's hands, at the appointment of the Mayor,
or to the master of the pump-room for the time being;
and that a register be kept of all such persons names, and
sums of money, paid to the said person so appointed; and
twice a year, or at the end of each season, this money shall
be divided in such proportion, to all the serjeants, guides,
men and women, clothwomen, and pumpers, &amp;c. as the
Mayor shall direct.</P>
<P>IX. It is proposed to have two chairs, constantly to
attend at the Mayor's door, or where he shall please to ap∣point
them, every night, from twelve o'clock 'till day-light,
for the conveniency of all strangers, physicians, sur∣geons,
men-midwives, apothecaries, and others; that the
chairmen shall take their turns, and in consideration of
their attendance, all persons using these chairs, shall pay
double fare from and after twelve o'clock, till day-light,
or what the Mayor shall direct.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="46"/>
X. Whereas, frequently, and almost daily, com∣plaints
have been made by many indisposed people, who
are obliged to keep their beds, and are deprived of rest by
the continual noise of ringing and tolling of bells, it is to
be hoped, when this is represented to the Mayor and Cor∣poration,
that they, together with the Rector of <HI>Bath,</HI> will
think of some shorter method to give the proper notices,
that the weak, and sick in bed, may not be disturbed.</P>
<P>XI. As no Bath Water is to be had after eleven
at night, the Pumps being all locked up at that hour, it is
proposed, that for the future, the common Pump near the
king's Bath, and that belonging to the Hot Bath, shall be
left open till one o'clock in the morning, for the conveni∣ency
of all strangers, and others, who are ordered to drink,
and bathe, before they go to bed; that the cocks of the
different Pumps shall be set so high, as that a pail may be
filled under each; and that a direction shall be stuck up
in the pump-room, giving notice where the pumper may
be found, for the benefit of those who want Water in the
night.</P>

<HEAD>The following PROPOSALS were presented by Mr. Cleland,
at a Meeting of the Physicians and Surgeons, assembled,
to consider of the improvements necessary to be made in
the Hot Baths.</HEAD>
<P>WE, the physicians, and surgeons, of <HI>Bath,</HI> beg leave to repre∣sent
to the Mayor and Corporation, that great advantages will
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the public, and to the city of <HI>Bath</HI> in particular, by having
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and queen's Bath altered, and made more convenient, and a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> erected, with sundry more improvements for the good of all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall come here for the benefit of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, it is proposed to have a house fitted up as near the king's Bath
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for all topical applications, and other conveniencies; the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rooms of which are to consist of a well-formed Hot Room in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to be always kept in order with proper fires, &amp;c. also with a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the reservoir in the king's Bath, to supply it, at all times,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hot Water, where any persons that require it may be cupp'd, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; on each side of this Hot Room, to have a bathing room;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for gentlemen, and the other for ladies, to communicate with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into the Hot Room. In each of these bathing rooms must be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> three cisterns, with curtains round each; one of these cisterns
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the in, either sitting, or standing; the other two for bathing, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
or half lying. In each of these cisterns must be placed three
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one from the reservoir in the king's Bath, to supply the same
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hot Water to bathe in, as also to pump upon any part affected:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pumps to be work'd on the outside of the bathing rooms. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cock serves to convey the steam, or vapour, of the Bath Waters
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a vapour Bath confined in a boiler, to be supplied from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
by means of a Pump, which must deliver only into this boiler,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which there is no outlets, but through the tubes, with valves, or
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-cocks, to regulate the natural or artificial heat of the Waters and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conveyed by them into these cisterns. The third cock into
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cisterns, is from a Cold Bath kept always ready for those that are
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cold Bathing, in a cistern made for that purpose, and will serve

or bleed, that the patients may stay to repose themselves, and
until it shall be proper for them to be carried to their lodgings▪</P>
<P>The alterations proposed to be made in the king and queen
are these:</P>
<P>First, to stop up the nitches, and take away the rails; the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
wall of the king's Bath should be raised so high, as to screen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
in the Bath, from those without it; that the east, west, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
walls should be rebuilt in the same form; that a portico should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣scribed
round this cistern, for shelter to the Bathers; that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Bath should be removed so far to the eastward, as to answer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
middle of the king's Bath; that four slips should be made in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
cistern, with dressing-rooms, and antichambers to them; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
pumps should be fixt in the dressing-rooms, for the use of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
should be pump'd without going into the Bath; that four <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
pumps should be fixt in the king's<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bath, out of the draught of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of wind that could happen from the buildings, for the use of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

as is proposed in the queen's.</P>
<P>These last alterations, which, together with the sudatory, and<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
