<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD>To the Right Honourable
RALPH
Earl of MOUNTAGUE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER>My LORD,</OPENER>
<P>WHether the World will arraign me of Vanity, or not, that
I have presum'd to Dedicate this Comedy to Your Lord∣ship,
I am yet in Doubt: Tho' it may be it is some de∣gree
of Vanity even to doubt of it. One who has at any time had
the Honour of Your Lordship's Conversation, cannot be suppos'd
to think very meanly of that which he would prefer to your Pe∣rusal:
Yet it were to incur the Imputation of too much Sufficien∣cy,
to pretend to such a Merit as might abide the Test of Your
Lordship's Censure.</P>
<P>Whatever Value may be wanting to this Play while yet it is mine,
will be sufficiently made up to it, when it is once become Your
Lordship's; and it is my Security, that I cannot have over rated
it more by my Dedication, than Your Lordship will dignifie it by
Your Patronage.</P>
<P>That it succeeded on the Stage, was almost beyond my Expe∣ctation;
for but little of it was prepar'd for that general Tast▪
which seems now to be predominant in the Pallats of our Audience.</P>
<P>Those Characters which are meant to be ridicul'd in most of
our Comedi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, are of Fools so gross, that in my humble Opinion,
they should rather disturb than divert the well-natur'd and reflect∣ing
Part of an Audience; they are rather Objects of Charity th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
Contempt; and instead of moving our Mirth, they ought very
often to excite our Compassion.</P>
<P>This Reflection mov'd me to design some Characters, which
should appear ridiculous not so much thro' a natural Folly (which
is incorrigible, and therefore not proper for the Stage) as thro'
an affected Wit; a Wit, which at the same time that it is affected,
<PB REF="3"/>
is also false. As there is some Difficulty in the Formation of a
Character of this Nature, so there is some Hazard which attends
the Progress of its Success, upon the Stage: For many come to a
Play, so over-charg'd with Criticism, that they very often let fly
their Censure, when through their Rashness they have mistaken
their Aim. This I had occasion lately to observe: For this Play
had been acted two or three Days, before some of these hasty
Judges cou'd find the leisure to distinguish betwixt the Character
of a <HI>Witwoud</HI> and a <HI>Truewit.</HI></P>
<P>I must b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g Your Lordship's Pardon for this Digression from the
true Course of this Epistle; but that it may not seem altogether
impertinent, I beg, that I may plead the Occasion of it, in part
of that Excuse of which I stand in need, for recommending this
Comedy to Your Protection. It is only by the Countenance of
Your Lordship, and the <HI>Few</HI> so qualify'd, that such who write
with Care and Pains can hope to be distinguish'd: For the Prosti∣tuted
Name of <HI>Poet</HI> promis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uously levels all that bear it.</P>
<P><HI>Terence,</HI> the most correct Writer in the World, had a <HI>Scipio</HI> and
a <HI>Lelius</HI> if not to assist him, at least to support him in his Repu∣tation:
And notwithstanding his extraordinary Merit, it may be,
their Countenance was not more than nec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssary.</P>
<P>The Purity of his Stile, the Delicacy of his Turns, and the Just∣ness
of his Characters, were all of them Beauties, which the grea∣ter
Part of his Audience were incapable of Tasting: Some of the
coursest Strokes of <HI>Plautus,</HI> so severely censur'd by <HI>Horace,</HI> were
more likely to affect the Multitude; such, who come with expe∣ctation
to laugh out the last Act of a Play, and are better enter∣tain'd
with two or three unseasonable Jests, than with the artful
Solution of the <HI>Fable.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Terence</HI> excell'd in his Performances, so had he great Ad∣vantages
to encourage his Undertakings; for he built most on the
Foundations of <HI>Menander:</HI> His Plots were generally modell'd,
and his Characters ready drawn to his Hand. He copied <HI>Menan∣der;</HI>
and <HI>Menander</HI> had no less Light in the Formation of his
Characters, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the Observations of <HI>Theophrastus,</HI> of whom he
was a Disciple; and <HI>Theophrastus</HI> it is known was not only the
Disciple, but the immediate Successor of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> the first and
greatest Judge of Poetry. These were great Models to design by;
and the further Advantage which <HI>Terence</HI> possess'd, towards giving
his Plays the due Ornaments of Purity of Stile, and Justness of
Manners, was not less considerable, from the Freedom of Con∣versation,
which was permitted him with <HI>Lelius</HI> and <HI>Scipio,</HI> two
<PB REF="4"/>
of the greatest and most polite Men of his Age. And indeed, the
Privilege of such a Conversation, is the only certain Means of at∣taining
to the Perfection of Dialogue.</P>
<P>If it has happen'd in any Part of this Comedy, that I have gain'd
a Turn of Stile, or Expression more Correct, or at least more Cor∣rigible
than in those which I have formerly written, I must, with
equal Pride an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gratitude, ascribe it to the Honour of Your
Lordship's admitting me into Your Conversation, and that of a
Society where every body else was so well worthy of You, in
Your Retirement last Summer from the Town: For it was imme∣diately
after, that this Comedy was written. If I have fail'd in
my Performance, it is only to be regretted, where there were so
many, not inferior either to a <HI>Scipio</HI> or a <HI>Lelius,</HI> that there shou'd
be one wanting equal to the Capacity of a <HI>Terence.</HI>
If I am not mistaken, Poetry is almost the only Art, which has
not yet laid Claim to Your Lordship's Patronage. Architecture,
and Painting, to the great Honour of our Country, have flourish'd
under Your Influence and Protection. In the mean time, Poetry,
the eldest Sister of all Arts, and Parent of most, seems to have re∣sign'd
her Birth-right, by having neglected to pay her Duty to
Your Lordship; and by permitting others of a later Extraction,
to prepossess that Place in Your Esteem, to which none can pre∣tend
a better Title. Poetry, in its Nature, is sacred to the Good
and Great; the Relation between them is reciprocal, and they are
ever propitious to it. It is the Privilege of Poetry to address to
them, and it is their Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rogative alone to give it Protection.</P>
<P>This receiv'd Maxim, is a general Apology for all Writers who
Consecrate their Labours to great Men: But I could wish at this
time, that this Address were exempted from the common Pretence
of all Dedications; and that as I can distinguish Your Lordship
even among the most Deserving, so this Offering might become
remarkable by some particular Instance of Respect, which shou'd
assure Your Lordship, that I am, with all due sense of Your ex∣tream
Worthiness and Humanity,</P>
<CLOSER>My LORD,
Tour Lordship's most Obedient
and most Oblig'd Humble Servant,
<SIGNED>Will. Congreve,</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,
Spoken by Mrs. Bracegirdle.</HEAD>
<L>After our <HI>Epilogue</HI> this Crowd dismisses,</L>
<L>I'm thinking how this Play'll be pull'd to Pieces.</L>
<L>But pray consider, e'er you doom its Fall,</L>
<L>How hard a thing 'twould be, to please you all.</L>
<L>There are some Criticks so with Spleen diseas'd,</L>
<L>They scarcely come inclining to be Pleas'd:</L>
<L>And sure he must have more than mortal Skill,</L>
<L>Who pleases any one against his Will.</L>
<L>Then, all bad Poets we are sure are Foes,</L>
<L>And how their Number's swell'd the Town well knows:</L>
<L>In shoals, I've mark'd 'em judging in the Pit;</L>
<L>Tho' they're on no Pretence for Judgment fit</L>
<L>But that they have been Damn'd for Want of Wit.</L>
<L>Since when, they by their own Offences taught</L>
<L>Set up for Spies on Plays, and finding Fault.</L>
<L>Others there are whose Malice we'd prevent;</L>
<L>Such, who watch Plays, with scurrilous Intent</L>
<L>To mark out who by Characters are meant.</L>
<L>And tho' no perfect Likeness they can trace;</L>
<L>yet each pretends to know the <HI>Copy'd Face.</HI></L>
<L>These, with false Glosses feed their own Ill-nature,</L>
<L>And turn to <HI>Libel;</HI> what was meant a Satire.</L>
<L>May such malicious Fops this Fortune find,</L>
<L>To think themselves alone the <HI>Fools</HI> design'd:</L>
<L>If any are so arrogantly Vain,</L>
<L>To think they singly can support a Scene,</L>
<L>And furnish <HI>Fool</HI> enough to entertain.</L>
<L>For well the Learn'd and the Judicious know,</L>
<L>That Satire scorns to stoop so meanly low,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s any <HI>one abstracted Fop</HI> to show.</L>
<L>For, as when Painters form a matchless Face,</L>
<L>They from each Fair One catch some diff'rent Grace▪</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shining Features in one Portrait blend,</L>
<L>To which no single Beauty must pretend:</L>
<L>So Poets oft, do in one Piece expose</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elles Assembles of <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>que<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and <HI>Beaux.</HI></L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,
Spoken by Mr. Betterton.</HEAD>
<L>OF those jew Fools, who with ill Stars are curs'd,</L>
<L>Sure scribbing Fools, call'd Poets, fare the worst.</L>
<L>For they're a sort of Fools which <HI>Fortune</HI> makes,</L>
<L>And after she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as made '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Fools, for sakes.</L>
<L>With Nature's Oafs 'tis quite a diff'rent Case,</L>
<L>For <HI>Fortune</HI> favours all her <HI>Idiot-Race:</HI></L>
<L>In her own Nest the <HI>Cuckow-Eggs</HI> we find,</L>
<L>O'er which she broods to hatch the <HI>Changling-Kind.</HI></L>
<L>No Portion for her own she has to spare,</L>
<L>So much she doats on her adopted Care.</L>
<L>Poets are Bubbles, by the Town drawn in,</L>
<L>Suffer'd at first some trifling Stakes to win:</L>
<L>But what unequal Hazards do they run!</L>
<L>Each time they write, they venture all they've won:</L>
<L>The 'Squire that's butter'd still, is sure to be undone.</L>
<L>This Author, heretofore, has found your Favour,</L>
<L>But pleads no Merit from his past Behaviour.</L>
<L>To build on that might prove a vain Presumption,</L>
<L>Should <HI>Grants</HI> to Poets made, admit Resumption:</L>
<L>And in <HI>Parnassus</HI> he must lose his Seat,</L>
<L>If that be found a forfeited Estate.</L>
<L>He owns, with Toil, be wrought the following Scenes,</L>
<L>But if they're naught ne'er spare him for his Pains:</L>
<L>Damn him the mare; have no Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>seration</L>
<L>For Dulness on mature Deliberation.</L>
<L>He swears he'll not resent one hiss'd-off Scene,</L>
<L>Nor, like those peevish Wits, his Play maintain,</L>
<L>Who, to asert their Sense, your Taste arraign.</L>
<L>Some Plot we think he has, and some new Thought;</L>
<L>Some Humour too, no Farce; but that's a Fault.</L>
<L>Satire, he thinks, you aught not to expect,</L>
<L>For so Reform'd a Town, who dares Correct?</L>
<L>To Please, this time, has been his sole Pretence,</L>
<L>He'll not instruct, l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st it should give Offence.</L>
<L>Should he by chance a Knave or Fool expose,</L>
<L>That hurts none here, sure here are none of those.</L>
<L>In short, our Play, shall (with your leave to shew it)</L>
<L>Give you one Instance of a Passive Poet.</L>
<L>Who to your Judgments yields all Resignation;</L>
<L>So Save or Damn, after your own Discretion.</L>

<P>No, I'll give you your Revenge another time, when you
are not so indifferent; you are thinking of something else now,
and play too negligently; the Coldness of a losing Gamester lessens
the Pleasure of the Winner: I'd no more play with a Man that

<P><HI>Witwoud</HI> and <HI>Petulant;</HI> and what was worse, her Aunt,

<P>O there it is then—She has a lasting Passion for

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and Mrs. <HI>Marwood</HI> and Three or Four more, whom
I never saw before; seeing me, they all put on their grave Faces,
whisper'd one another; then complain'd aloud of the Vapours,
and after fell into a profound Silence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>They had a mind to be rid of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>For which Reason I resolv'd not to stir. At last the good
old Lady broke thro' her painful Taciturnity, with an Invective
against long Visits. I would not have understood her, but <HI>Mil∣lamant</HI>
joining in the Argument, I rose and with a constrain'd
Smile told her, I thought nothing was so easie as to know when
a Visit began to be troublesome; she reden'd and I withdrew,
without expecting her Reply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were to blame to resent what she spoke only in Com∣pliance
with her Aunt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is more Mistress of her self, than to be under the
necessity of such a Resignation.</P>

<P>What? tho' half her Fortune depends upon her Mar∣rying
with my Lady's Approbation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was then in such a Humour, that I shou'd have been
better pleas'd if she had been less discreet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I remember, I wonder not they were weary of you;
last Night was one of their Cabal-Nights; they have 'em three
times a Week, and meet by turns, at one another's Apartments,
where they come together like the Coroner's Inquest, to sit upon
the murder'd Reputations of the Week. You and I are excluded;
and it was once propos'd that all the Male Sex shou'd be excepted;
but some body mov'd that to avoid Scandal there might be one
Man of the Community; upon which Motion <HI>Witwoud</HI> and <HI>'Pe∣lant</HI>
were enroll'd Members.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who may have been the Foundress of this Sect?
My Lady <HI>Wishfort,</HI> I warrant, who publishes her Detestation
of Mankind; and full of the Vigour of Fifty five, declares for

no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Discovery of your sham Addresses to her, to con∣ceal
your Love to her Neice, has provok'd this Separation: Had
you dissembl'd better, Things might have continu'd in the State
of Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did as much as Man cou'd, with any reasonable Con∣science;
I proceeded to the very last Act of Flattery with her, and
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
was guilty of a Song in her Commendation: Nay, I got a Friend
to put her into a Lampoon, and complement her with the Impu∣tation
of an Affair with a young Fellow, which I carry'd so far,
that I told her the malicious Town took notice that she was grown
fat of a sudden; and when she lay in of a Dropsie, persuaded her
she was reported to be in Labour. The Devil's in't, if an old Wo∣man
is to be flatter'd further, unless a Man shou'd endeavour
downright personally to debauch her; and that my Virtue forbad
me. But for the Discovery of this Amour, I am indebted to your
Friend, or your Wife's Friend, Mrs. <HI>Marwood.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>What should provoke her to be your Enemy, without
she has made you Advances, which you have flighted? Women

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was always civil to me, till of late; I confess I am
not one of those Coxcombs who are apt to interpret a Woman's
good Manners to her Prejudice; and think that she who does not
refuse '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m ev'ry thing, can refuse 'em nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a gallant Man, <HI>Mirabell,</HI> and tho' you may
have Cruelty enough, not to satisfie a Lady's longing; you have
too much Generosity, not to be tender of her Honour. Yet you
speak with an Indifference which seems to be affected; and con∣fesses
you are conscious of a Negligence.</P>

<P>Joy of your Success, <HI>Mirabell;</HI> you look pleas'd.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; I have been engag'd in a Matter of some sort of
Mirth, which is not yet ripe for Discovery. I am glad this is
not a Cabal-Night. I wonder, <HI>Fainall,</HI> that you who are Mar∣ried,
and of Consequence should be discreet, will suffer your Wife
to be of such a Party.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I am not Jealous. Besides, most who are engag'd
are Women and Relations; and for the Men, they are of a Kind
too Contemptible to give Scandal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of another Opinion. The greater the Coxcomb,
always the more the Scandal: For a Woman who is not a Fool,
can have but one Reason for associating with a Man that is.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>And for a disc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rning Man, somewhat too passionate a
Lover; for I like her with all her Faults; nay, like her for her
Faults. Her Follies are so natural, or so artful that they become
her; and those Affectations which in another Woman wou'd be o∣dious,
serve but to make her more agreeable. I'll tell thee, <HI>Fain∣all,</HI>
she once us'd me with that Insolence, that in Revenge I took
her to pieces; sifted her and separated her Failings; I study'd 'em,
and got 'em by Rote. The Catalogue was so large, that I was
not without Hopes, one Day or other to hate her heartily: To
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
which end I so us'd my self to think of 'em, that at length, con∣trary
to my Design and Expectation, they gave me ev'ry Hour
less and less Disturbance; 'till in a few Days it became habitual
to me, to remember 'em without being displeas'd. They are now

<P>Yes; he is half Brother to this <HI>Witwoud</HI> by a former

his due; he has something of good Nature, and does not always
want Wit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not always; but as often as his Memory fails him, and
his common Place of Comparisons. He is a Fool with a good
Memory, and some few Scraps of other Folks Wit. He is one
whose Conversation can never be approv'd, yet it is now and
then to be endur'd. He has indeed one good Quality, he is not
Exceptious; for he so passionately affects the Reputation of un∣derstanding
Raillery; that he will construe an Affront into a Jest;
and call downright Rudeness and ill Language, Satire and Fire.</P>

<P>We staid pretty late there last Night; and heard something

is between him and the best part of his Estate; <HI>Mirabell</HI> and he
are at some Distance, as my Lady <HI>Wishort</HI> has been told; and
you know she hates <HI>Mirabell,</HI> worse than a Quaker hates a Par∣rot
or than a Fishmonger hates a hard Frost. Whether this
Uncle has seen Mrs. <HI>Millamant</HI> or not, I cannot say; but there
were Items of such a Treaty being in Embrio; and if it shou'd
come to Life, poor <HI>Mirabell</HI> wou'd be in some sort unfortunately

<HEAD>ACT II. SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>St. <HI>James's Park.</HI>
Enter Mrs. <HI>Fainall</HI> and Mrs. Marwood.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, dear <HI>Marwood,</HI> if we will be happy,
we must find the Means in our selves, and a∣mong
our selves. Men are ever in Extreams, either do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting or
averse. While they are Lovers, if they have Fire and Sense, their
Jealousies are insupportable: And when they cease to Love, (we
ought to think at least) they loath; they look upon us with Hor∣ror
and Distaste; they meet us like the Ghosts of what we were,
and as such fly from us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, 'tis an unhappy Circumstance of Life, that
Love shou'd ever die before us; and that the Man so often shou'd
out-live the Lover. But say what you will, 'tis better to be left,
than never to have been lov'd. To pass our Youth in dull In∣difference,
to refuse the Sweets of Life because they once must
leave us; is as preposterous, as to wish to have been born Old,
because we one Day must be Old. For my part, my Youth may
wear and waste, but it shall never rust in my Possession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it seems you dissemble an Aversion to Man∣kind,
only in compliance with my Mother's Humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. To be free; I have no Taste of those
insipid dry Discourses, with which our Sex of force must enter∣tain
themselves, apart from Men. We may affect Endearments
to each other, profess eternal Friendships, and seem to dote like
Lovers; but 'tis not in our Natures long to persevere. Love will
resume his Empire in our Breasts, and every Heart, or soon or
late, receive and readmit him as its lawful Tyrant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, how have I been deceiv'd! Why you
prosess a Libertine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You fee my Friendship by my Freedom. Come,
be as sincere, acknowledge that your Sentiments agree with mine.</P>
</SP>

<P>Is it possible? Dost thou hate those Vipers Men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>There spoke the Spirit of an <HI>Amazon,</HI> a <HI>Penthesilea</HI></P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith by Marrying; if I cou'd but find one that
lov'd me very well, and would be throughly sensible of ill Usage;
I think I shou'd do my self the Violence of undergoing the Cere∣mony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would not make him a Cuckold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but I'd make him believe I did, and that's as
bad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why had not you as good do it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>O if he shou'd ever discover it, he wou'd then
know the worst; and be out of his Pain; but I wou'd have him
ever to continue upon the Rack of Fear and Jealousie.</P>

<P>I never lov'd him; he is, and always was insuffe∣rably
proud.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

Come, you both love him; and both have equally dissembl'd your

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mar.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not—'Twas for my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase to oversee and wilfully
neglect the gross Advances made him by my Wife; that by per∣mitting

incens'd beyond all Means of Reconcilement: <HI>Millamant</HI> had for∣feited

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do we daily commit disagreeable and dangerous A∣ctions?
To save that Idol Reputation. If the Familiarities of our
Loves had produc'd that Consequence, of which you were ap∣prehensive,
where could you have fix'd a Father's Name with Cre∣dit,
but on a Husband? I knew <HI>Fainall</HI> to be a Man lavish of his
Morals, an interested and professing Freind, a false and a design∣ing
Lover; yet one whose Wit and outward fair Behaviour, have
gain'd a Reputation with the Town, enough to make that Wo∣man
stand excus'd, who has suffer'd her sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be won by his Ad∣dresses.
A better Man ought not to have been sacrific'd to the
Occasion; a worse had not answer'd to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Purpose. When you
are weary of him, you know your Remedy.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Waitwell</HI> and <HI>Foible.</HI> I wou'd not tempt my Servant

<P>Well, I have an Opinion of your Succ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss; for I

<P>You would affect a Cruelty which is not in your Na∣ture;
your true Vanity is in the Power of pleasing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Milla.</SPEAKER>
<P>O I ask your Pardon for that—Ones Cruelty is ones
Power, and when one parts with ones Cruclty, one parts with
ones Power; and when one has parted with that, I fancy one's
Old and Ugly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, suffer your Cruelty to ruin the Object of your
Power, to destroy your Lover—And then how vain, how lost
a Thing you'll be! Nay, 'tis true: You are no longer handsome
when you've lost your Lover; your Beauty dies upon the Instant:
For Beauty is the Lover's Gift; 'tis he bestows your Charms—
Your Glass is all a Cheat. The Ugly and the Old, whom the
Looking-glass mortifies, yet after Commendation can be flatter'd
by it, and discover Beauties in it: For that reflects our Praises,
rather than your Face.</P>

Beauty the Lover's Gift—Lord, what is a Lover, that
it can give? Why one makes Lovers as fast as one pleases, and
they live as long as one pleases, and they die as soon as one
pleases: And then if one pleases one makes more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wit.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very pretty. Why you make no more of making of
Lovers, Madam, than of making so many Card-matches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Milla.</SPEAKER>
<P>One no more owes ones Beauty to a Lover, than ones
Wit to an Eccho: They can but reflect what we look and say;
vain empty Things if we are silent or unseen, and want a Being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, to those two vain empty Things, you owe two
the greatest Pleasures of your Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Milla.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>To your Lover you owe the Pleasure of hearing your

talk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But I know a Lady that loves talking so incessantly, she
won't give an Eccho fair play; she has that everlasting Rotation

<P>Why faith I'm thinking of it.—Let me see—I am
marry'd already; so that's over,—My Wife has plaid the Jade
with me—Well, that's over too—I never lov'd her, or if
I had, why that wou'd have been over too by this time—
Jealous of her I cannot be, for I am certain; so there's an end of
Jealousie. Weary of her, I am, and shall be—No, there's
no end of that; No, no, that were too much to hope. Thus
far concerning my Repose. Now for my Reputation,—As
to my own, I marry'd not for it; so that's out of the Question.
—And as to my Part in my Wife's—Why she had part∣ed
with hers before; so bringing none to me, she can take none
from me; 'tis against all rule of Play, that I should lose to one,

<P>Jealous, no,—by this Kiss—let Husbands be Jealous;
but let the Lover still believe. Or if he doubt, let it be only to
endear his Pleasure, and prepare the Joy that follows, when he
proves his Mistress true, but let Husbands Doubts convert to
endless Jealousie; or if they have Belief, let it corrupt to Super∣stition
and blind Credulity. I am single; and will herd no more

He cou'd not have bedded your Ladiship; for if he had

Mrs. Mar. Nay, Madam, I advise nothing, I only lay before
you, as a Friend, the Inconveniencies which perhaps you have
overseen. Here comes Mr. <HI>Fainall.</HI> If he will be satisfy'd to
huddle up all in Silence, I shall be glad. You must think I would
rather Congratulate than Condolc with you.
Enter <HI>Fainall.</HI>
Lady. Ay, ay, I do not doubt it, dear Marwood: No, no, I
do not doubt it.
Fain. Well, Madam; I have suffer'd my self to be overcome
by the Importunity of this Lady your Friend, and am content
you shall enjoy your own proper Estate during Life; on Condi∣tion
you oblige your self never to Marry, under such Penalty as
I think convenient.
Lady. Never to Marry?
Fain. No more Sir Rowlands,—the next Imposture may not
be so timely detected.
Mrs. Mar. That Condition, I dare answer, my Lady will con∣sent
to, without Diffculty; she has already but too much expe∣rienc'd
the Persidiousness of Men. Besides, Madam, when we
retire to our Pastoral Solitude we shall bid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u to all other
Thoughts.
Lady. Ay, that's true; but in Case of Necessity; as of Health,
of some such Emergency—
Fain. O, if you are prescrib'd Marriage, you shall be consi∣der'd;
I will only reserve to my self the Power to chuse for you.
If your Physick be wholsome, it matters not who is your Apo∣thecary.
Next, my Wife shall settle on me the Remainder of
her Fortune, not made over already; and for her Maintenance
depend entirely on my Discretion.
Lady. This is most inhumanly Savage; exceeding the Barbari∣ty
of a Muscovite Husband.
Fain. I learn'd it from his <HI>Czarisb</HI> Majesty's Retinue, in a
Winter Evening's Conference over Brandy and Pepper, amongst
other Secrets of Matrimony and Policy, as they are at present pra∣ctis'd
in the Northern Hemisphere. But this must be agreed unto,
and that positively. Lastly, I will be endow;d in right of my Wife,
with that Six Thousand Pound, which is the Moiety of Mrs. <HI>Mil∣lamant</HI>'s

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Mr. <HI>Mirabell,</HI> you have kept your Promise—and I must
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
perform mine-First I pardon for your sake Sir <HI>Rowland</HI> there and
<HI>Foible,</HI>—The next thing is to break the Matter to my Nephew
and how to do that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>For that, Madam, give your self no Trouble,—let me
have your Consent—Sir <HI>Willfull</HI> is my Friend; he has had Compassi∣on

for our Service, and now designs to prosecute his Travels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sheart, Aunt, I have no mind to marry. My Cousin's a
sine Lady, and the Gentleman loves her and she loves him, and they
deserve one another; my Resolution is to see Foreign Parts—I have set
on't—and when I'm set on't, I must do't. And if these two Gentle∣men
wou'd travel too, I think they may be spar'd.</P>

<P>For my part, I say little—I think things are best off or

<P>I gad I understand nothing of the matter,—I'm in a Maze

<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Sir, take her, and with her all the Joy I can give you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Milla.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why does not the Man take me? Wou'd you have me give
my self to you over again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and over and over again; [<HI>Kisses her Hand.</HI>] I would
have you as often as possibly I can. Well, Heav'n grant I Love you
not too well, that's all my Fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sheart you'll have him time enough to toy after you're
marry'd; or if you will toy now, let us have a Dance in the mean
time, that we who are not Lovers may have some other Employment,
besides looking on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart. dear Sir <HI>Willfull;</HI> what shall we do for
Musick?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I am a Person I can hold out no longer;—I have wasted
my Spirits so to Day already, that I am ready to sink under the Fa∣tigue;
and I cannot but have some Fears upon me yet, that my Son
<HI>Fainall</HI> will pursue some desperate Course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, disquiet not your self on that account; to my know∣ledge
his Circumstances are such, he must of Force comply. For my
part I will contribute all that in me lyes to a reunion: In the mean
time, Madam, [<HI>To Mrs.</HI> Fain.] let me before these Witnesses restore
to you this Deed of Trust; it may be a Means, well manag'd, to make
you live easily together.</P>
<L>From hence let those be warn'd, who mean to wed;</L>
<L>Left mutual Falshood stain the Bridal-Bed:</L>
<L>For each Deceiver to his Cost may find,</L>
<L>That Marriage Frauds too oft are paid in kind.</L>
