<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N the first <HI>Setting out</HI> depends the <HI>Fate of the Journey</HI>; and therefore to obviate a Prejudice, which might easily happen, it is fit we shou'd give all our Rea∣dears <HI>one Caution</HI>, by way of Introduction.</P>
<P>We easily foresee, that it will be impossible for the Subjects we have chosen in this our First Book, to be equally pleasing to every Taste: Neither indeed cou'd any <HI>other</HI> have been so, which we might have pitch'd on in their stead. For it shou'd be consider'd, that the <HI>Interests</HI> and <HI>Inclinations</HI> of Men, are as various as their <HI>Faces</HI>; and that nothing was
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
ever so happily struck, but that <HI>some</HI> have dislik'd it.</P>
<P>Yet it were an Imprudence for a Man to conclude, that because the Essays we <HI>begin with</HI>, may happen to differ from his Relish, or be <HI>out of his way</HI>, that therefore <HI>the Rest</HI> will <HI>continue</HI> to be so. Our Work must con∣sist of a never ending <HI>Variety:</HI> And besides, that a little Patience will certainly produce something fit for his Purpose, his Friends may be <HI>pleas'd</HI> in the Interim, and his Family <HI>in∣structed</HI> by Subjects, which are ever so wide from his own way of thinking.</P>
<P>There is more in this Caution than a Man at first View perhaps wou'd imagine; and to fix it the stronger in our Readers Opinion, we shall tell a <HI>true Story</HI>, not at all from our Purpose, and leave the <HI>Application</HI> to every Man's Judgment.</P>
<P>When Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> was Governor of <HI>Brazile</HI> for the <HI>Dutch</HI>, and encourag'd the falling into Sugar Plantations, an Inhabitant of the Colony was presented with a Book, which had been taken in a Prize, and con∣tain'd an Account of some Progress in Experi∣mental Philosophy, by a Professor of that Science in the University of <HI>Salamanca</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5"/>The Planter, not accustom'd to read or con∣sider such Variety of Matter, and meeting, at his first looking into the Treatise, with a long Dissertation on the Nature of <HI>Colours</HI>, concluded the Subject to be <HI>out of his Way</HI>, and threw aside the Book, with the Negligence usual on such an Occasion.</P>
<P>It happened, a Year or Two after, that as this Planter was busied in his Sugar House, he was dangerously <HI>Scalded</HI> by the <HI>Boiling over</HI> of the <HI>Liquor</HI>, which kill'd a poor <HI>Ne∣gro</HI> outright, and from which he <HI>himself</HI> found it difficult to recover, after tedious and painful Confinement to his Chamber.</P>
<P>He was sitting one Day, as he began to be on the mending Hand, and took Notice, that a Lap-Dog in the Room was more busy than ordinary in <HI>scraping</HI> and struggling with his Feet, to get something out from under a Ca∣binet. His Wife rose to see what it was, and drew out <HI>the Book above-mentioned</HI>, cover'd over with Dust; having fallen by chance, and lain there forgotten and unenquir'd after.</P>
<P>The Planter, now, in more Composure of Mind than was usual, through his long want of Company, bethought himself that he wou'd dip here and there in the Book, and endea∣vour some Diversion from <HI>that Entertainment</HI>,
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
for want of a <HI>Better</HI>. Accordingly, he open'd it at random, and the first Page he fix'd on, began in this manner.—<HI>From the foregoing Considerations it is easy to assign a good Rea∣son for a very odd Effect, which the Planters of Sugar observe in their Boilers, into which, if they throw but a small piece of Butter, not much bigger than a Nutmeg, it infallibly keeps <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn the Liquor, which otherwise is often apt to boil</HI> over <HI>with a most sudden and dangerous Violence</HI>.</P>
<P>It is easy to imagine he was <HI>startled</HI>, to light unexpectedly on a Hint, which con∣cern'd him so <HI>nearly</HI>: He concluded however, that it was an improbable Fancy, and not worth believing; but his Wife, of a <HI>Nature</HI> more <HI>curious</HI> and <HI>inquisitive</HI>, gave Orders to their Overseer, for <HI>trying</HI> the <HI>Experiment</HI>, and found, to her Amazement, that upon throwing in the Butter, when the Liquor was just in its Fury of rising, it <HI>fell flat in a Mo∣ment</HI>, and continued to boil with a miraculous <HI>Calmness</HI>.</P>
<P>In short, this poor Secret has, from that time to this, maintain'd its Reputation. It has gradually spread through the Sugar Plan∣tations of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America</HI>, and is practis'd at this very Day by our <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Barbadoes</HI>, with never-failing Effect. But the Planters <HI>past Smart</HI> was <HI>renew'd</HI>, and made <HI>sharper</HI>, by
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Reflection on the Misery he had suffer'd through his <HI>want of Curiosity</HI>; since he had certainly found out the Secret <HI>before</HI>, and thereby <HI>prevented</HI> his <HI>Misfortune</HI>, if he had not too rashly rejected the <HI>Whole</HI>, because <HI>Part</HI> of the Book was not writ <HI>to his Relish</HI>.</P>
<P>The Reader will presently see, what a <HI>Use</HI> we propose he shou'd make of the foregoing Example: Which having recommended once more to his <HI>serious Reflection</HI>, we go on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Business; and begin the Design with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> following Matter, in Respect to the Ladies.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has long been a Notion receiv'd as a Certainty, that they cannot make fine <HI>China Ware</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, or indeed in any other Countrey of the World, but in that part of the <HI>Indies</HI>, from whence it is brought us: And to back this Opinion with some Shew of <HI>Reason</HI>, we are told, that the <HI>Chi∣nese themselves</HI> cannot make it, but of <HI>one</HI> kind of Earth only; and that <HI>even the proper Earth</HI> is unfit for the purpose, till it has lain for an Age or two <HI>buried</HI>; and that, as it draws nearer to its <HI>Pitch</HI> of <HI>Perfection</HI>, it Yearly <HI>increases in Value</HI>, and is left as a Legacy from Father to Son, till it reaches its <HI>Period</HI>.</P>
<P>We shall prove this Report to be nothing but Amusement, by instructing the most ordinary <HI>Pot∣ter</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, to make as fine <HI>China</HI> as ever was sold by the <HI>East-India Company</HI>; and that with such Ease, that it may be afforded almost as cheap as the commonest Earthen Ware. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we will <HI>begin</HI> the <HI>Essay</HI>, for the Satisfaction of Persons, whose Curiosity leads them to enquire after Things they are yet unacquainted withal, with a true Informati∣on
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<HI>what Earth it is</HI> they make use of among the <HI>Chinese</HI>, and <HI>bow</HI> they <HI>prepare it</HI> for this brittle Manufacture.</P>
<P>The Earth is a kind of <HI>Tobacco-Pipe Clay</HI>, per∣haps somewhat fitter than ours, by the Sun's nearer Influence. When they first dig it up, they expose it a while to the Air, and then work it with Shovels, and much treading of their Feet; after which they form it in <HI>Molds</HI>, as we do <HI>Bricks</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, but <HI>smaller</HI>, and bake it in Ovens, with a violent Heat from Furnaces below them.</P>
<P>These bak'd Cakes of Earth they <HI>grind down to Powder</HI> in Mills made on purpose: When the Powder is as <HI>fine</HI> as it can be made by that Process, they have recourse to the <HI>following Contrivance</HI>, to make it <HI>still finer</HI>.</P>
<P>They throw it into Cisterns of <HI>Water</HI>, and stir it about without ceasing, for an Hour or more: After which they let it stand just so long, as till the Surface is free from the <HI>Motion</HI> which their <HI>stir∣ring</HI> had given it, and then let it out at a Tap near the Bottom. By which means, the <HI>heaviest</HI> Parti∣cles, sinking naturally down, the <HI>fine</HI> undistin∣guishable <HI>Atoms</HI>, which <HI>float</HI> in the Body of the Water, and colour it like Milk, are <HI>drawn off with it</HI>, into another large Vessel.</P>
<P>In this second Vessel, the Water is suffer'd to <HI>stand</HI> for a Week or Ten Days; in which time there is <HI>settled to the Bottom</HI>, a very considerable Quan∣tity of a <HI>Milk white soft Substance</HI>, of an inex∣pressible <HI>Fineness</HI>; which when they have obtain'd, by <HI>drawing off the Water</HI>, they <HI>work</HI>, and <HI>make
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
up</HI>, as our <HI>Potters</HI> do <HI>Clay</HI>, but with a great deal more Neatness and Nicety.</P>
<P>Their Cups being <HI>shap'd</HI>, and <HI>rough-made</HI>, they let stand till half dry; and then with an Instru∣ment of Copper, by rubbing them over, inside and out, they <HI>polish</HI> and <HI>smooth</HI> them to their Fancy, and replace them to dry, till they are fit to be <HI>glaz'd</HI>.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Glazing</HI>, they grind down that <HI>snow-white Enamel</HI>, which is commonly made by our <HI>Jewellers</HI> and <HI>others</HI>; and having purify'd it with <HI>Aqua Fortis</HI>, they prepare it by <HI>grinding</HI> on a Pain∣ters Marble with a little <HI>Gum-water</HI>, and so <HI>Glaze</HI> the <HI>China</HI>, and set it to <HI>Bake</HI> in the Ovens above∣mentioned, where the Fire must be strong enough to make it red hot; and be suffer'd to go out, of it self, that the <HI>China</HI> may cool by <HI>degrees</HI>, which were otherwise in danger of <HI>breaking</HI>.</P>
<P>The next Thing they do, is to <HI>Paint</HI> the Out∣sides of the Ware, as we see it brought over. The Painting it self is no otherwise different from <HI>Limning in General</HI>, than in the way of <HI>preparing the Colours</HI>, which being form'd of the <HI>variously-tinctur'd</HI> Enamels, are dry'd in by Fire, in little Furnaces for the Purpose: But the manner of Paint∣ing on Enamel in all kind of Colours, being <HI>com∣mon in England</HI>, it is needless to teach its Par∣ticulars.</P>
<P>When the Dishes are <HI>Painted</HI> to the Fancy of the Workman, they are <HI>once more</HI> put into the Furnace, to <HI>Bake in</HI> the Colours; after which there remains no more Work, and the <HI>China</HI> is fit for the Market.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12"/>The foregoing Description contains the <HI>whole Chinese Practice</HI> in making this valuable Ware, from the first to the last; whence it plainly ap∣pears, that as we have <HI>Potters, Enamellers</HI>, and <HI>Pointers</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, who can work in their Arts as well as the People of any other Nation what∣ever, there is nothing we can <HI>want</HI> for the <HI>making of China</HI> in its utmost Perfection, but the <HI>Earth</HI> 'tis compos'd of.</P>
<P>We have not, as yet, had a proper Opportunity, to <HI>make the Experiment</HI>; but we firmly <HI>believe</HI>, our <HI>Tobacco-Pipe Clay</HI>, bak'd over and over, and often <HI>refin'd</HI> by the Process before-mention'd, might be <HI>capable of doing it:</HI> And we are the rather in∣clin'd to propose it, from an Observation, which all Men may, every Day make, that the <HI>Clay</HI> of which <HI>Tobacco-Pipes</HI> are <HI>made</HI>, can, by no means, compare with the Clearness and Whiteness of the <HI>Pipes themselves</HI>; and yet those white Pipes attain that Improvement by <HI>one Single Baking</HI>.</P>
<P>But leaving the uncertain Effect of this <HI>Conjecture</HI> to the Trial of the Curious, we give you the fol∣lowing, as a <HI>try'd</HI> and <HI>infallible</HI> Method.</P>
<P>Let any good Workman in the Potters Profes∣sion, who would benefit himself by this Art, em∣ploy some poor People to buy up the <HI>old broken China</HI>, which every House can afford him. This Ware he must <HI>grind in a Mill</HI>, with a flat Stone and Runner. The Mill is a <HI>common one</HI>, and every-where to be met with. The Powder, when it comes from the Mill, must be further reduced
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
and <HI>refin'd</HI> by the Assistance of <HI>Water</HI>, in the manner which was just now describ'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>gross Parts</HI>, which <HI>settle</HI>, and <HI>lie in the Bottom</HI>, and are not drawn off with the Water, may be <HI>dry'd</HI>, and ground over again with new Ware, so that nothing is lost in this Practice. But the fine Stuff, or Substance, which will be got from the <HI>Settling</HI> of the <HI>Water</HI>, when let stand in the Second Vessel, must be mix'd with the Fourth Part of its Weight, of <HI>Quick-Lime</HI>, dissolv'd in <HI>Gum-Water</HI>.</P>
<P>The Quick-Lime here meant, must be <HI>diffe∣rent</HI> from the <HI>common Sort</HI>, and is made in a Fur∣nace, of what Size you please, by no other La∣bour, or Charge, than <HI>burning clean Oyster-shells</HI>, as they do <HI>Chalk</HI>, in <HI>Lime-Kilns</HI>. Of this Composi∣tion, must the Dishes be made; and being after∣wards <HI>Bak'd, Glaz'd</HI>, and <HI>Painted</HI>, in all which there is nothing <HI>uncommon</HI>, or <HI>difficult</HI>, you have <HI>China-Ware</HI> perfect, and finish'd, as that from the <HI>Indies:</HI> For indeed it is the same, both in <HI>Figure</HI> and <HI>Substance</HI>.</P>
<P>We have done with this Part of the Subject: And if any should object, that <HI>none but a Potter can be∣nefit by it</HI>; they are answer'd, We began our Essays with a Caution to our Readers, that they shou'd not expect to be <HI>all pleas'd at once</HI>. Though, be∣sides the great <HI>general Profit</HI> of such an Improve∣ment in the Nation, the Purses of <HI>most Men</HI> will be sensibly serv'd, by reducing the present extra∣vagant Rates of this Fashionable Furniture, and making some kind of <HI>Amends</HI> for its <HI>Brittleness</HI>,
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
by giving a <HI>Value</HI>, even <HI>after 'tis broke</HI>, to that which is <HI>now</HI>, but <HI>unprofitable Rubbish</HI>.</P>
<P>We are sure no Objection can reasonably lie against putting in Practice so gainful, as well as so useful a Manufacture; unless it shall be thought a sufficient Obstruction, that when the Improvement is generally fallen into, the <HI>Matter</HI> it self, upon which it depends, will <HI>fail them in Time</HI>, because 'tis impossible (when the first Stock is consum'd) to be furnish'd with <HI>broken China</HI>, in Quantities proportion'd to the Call there will be for it.</P>
<P>We answer to this; 'twill be long before any such Want can take Place; and the <HI>first Underta∣kers</HI> will sufficiently benefit themselves in the Interim.</P>
<P>Neither is there any Reason to doubt, if our Hint of <HI>refining Tobacco-Pipe Clay</HI>, shou'd not an∣swer our Hopes; but that when the making of <HI>China</HI> shall be common in <HI>England</HI>, the inquisitive Genius of our People, push'd on to due Search by a Prospect of <HI>Profit</HI>, will discover, in some Part or other of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>, as fine, and as capable <HI>Earths</HI>, as those of the <HI>Indies</HI>. And to shew the Distrusters, that this Expectation is no way <HI>Chi∣merical</HI>, we will tell them a Story, that may <HI>en∣courage</HI> such Endeavours.</P>
<P>In the Heat of the Second <HI>Dutch</HI> War, a Ship of that Country was wreck'd in a Storm on the Coast of <HI>Norfolk</HI>; one poor Sailor was all who escap'd of the Crew, and he made hard Shift to reach Land on a Piece of the Wreck.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15"/>Half dead with <HI>Cold</HI>, and the <HI>Fatigue of his De∣liverance</HI>; he crept to the House of a Neigh∣bouring Farmer; who, believing it unlawful to shelter an Enemy, wou'd by no means be tempted to give him Admission; so that driven to Extre∣mity, unknown, and helpless, he had no View before him, but to wander up and down, in hopes he might light accidentally on some more <HI>Hospi∣table Dwelling</HI>.</P>
<P>In a Lane which he pass'd through, he saw an <HI>old Coat</HI> hung over a Gate; he look'd every way round him to discover the <HI>Owner</HI>, but not seeing any Body near him, and the Evening coming on, he bethought himself that it might be of Use to put on that Coat, while he threw off his wet Cloaths to <HI>dry</HI>; so he took it from the Gate, and withdrew towards a <HI>Copse</HI>, not far distant.</P>
<P>The Owner of the Coat was a <HI>Ditcher</HI>, then at work pretty near; he saw the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sailor from an opposite Hedge, coming over the Field, and thinking he had <HI>stolen</HI> the Coat, he surpriz'd him on a sudden, and taking it from him, examin'd him, in a Language he understood not the Mean∣ing of, <HI>Who he was</HI>, and by what Means he <HI>came thither</HI> in so wet a Condition.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, for whom the Ditcher was at Work, had formerly been a <HI>Merchant</HI>, and spent much of his Youth with the <HI>Hollanders</HI>: He was walking at that Time in the <HI>Copse</HI>, and being disturbed at the indistinct Sound of a Jargon, half <HI>Dutch</HI> half <HI>English</HI>, came our to the Field, and <HI>unriddled the Matter</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="16" MS="y"/>He took Pity on the Misery of a Stranger, brought him home to his House, and refresh'd him with <HI>Sleep</HI>, and a <HI>warm Sute of Cloaths</HI>, and under∣took to sollicit the Means of his <HI>Return</HI> to his Country.</P>
<P>The Merit of his Charity was overtaken in the Act, by a <HI>Reward</HI> as unexpected as the <HI>Accident</HI>. The Gentleman had at this Time employ'd a great Number of Workmen, in <HI>draining</HI> a large Track of <HI>Meadow</HI>, and finding in Discourse, that his <HI>Dutch Guest</HI> had some Skill in Business of that Nature, he took him out with him one Morning, and de∣sir'd his Advice, in removing some Difficulties, which his Drainers had met with.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Dutchman</HI> came into the Field, he stopp'd short with <HI>Surprize</HI>, at a Bank of <HI>Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Earth</HI>, which had been cast up by the Diggers: The Gentleman demanded the Cause of his ex∣amining that Clay with such <HI>Earnestness</HI>; and was answer'd, that it was sold in his Country at extravagant Rates, to the Makers of <HI>Delf Ware</HI>, and fine Earthen Vessels, being brought down the <HI>Rhine</HI>, out of some Place in <HI>Germany</HI>, and very much coveted in all Parts of <HI>Holland</HI>.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, to make the best Use of this Hint, upon Conclusion of the Peace, which hap∣pen'd soon after, sent over a <HI>Sample</HI>, and finding the Sailor's Account to be <HI>true</HI>▪ he open'd the <HI>Vein</HI>, and dug up such a Quantity, as brought him in a Profit of <HI>Ten Thousand pounds</HI> in Lighte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Months Time: But the St<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck was <HI>exhausted</HI> and he never could find any more in his Lands, thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="17" REF="17" MS="y"/>
he diligently and frequently made it his En∣deavour.</P>
<P>We hope the <HI>Example of this Story</HI> may have Power to influence the <HI>Curiosity</HI> of our <HI>Gentlemen:</HI> And the rather, because there are many Estates, now in <HI>Mortgage</HI> for above half their Value, whose <HI>unfortunate Owners</HI> walk every Day over Treasure enough to make them easy for ever, without knowing, or thinking of any such Matter.</P>
<P>To assist so desirable a Change, we will teach an infallible, easy, and cheap way, to discover what different Bottoms lie under all Lands; By which Means the Owner may often find out <HI>Marl, Chalk, Fullers-Earth, Tobacco-Pipe-Clay</HI>, Yellow <HI>Oker</HI>, or Red; <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Coal</HI>, or <HI>Quarries</HI> of <HI>Stone</HI>; any one of which may, in some Parts of the Kingdom, where they are <HI>wanted</HI>, be of Ten Times more Value, than the Estate, which conceals them.</P>
<P>You must order a Smith to make Six Iron <HI>Augers</HI>, or <HI>Borers</HI>, with each a cross Handle: They must be very <HI>strong made</HI>, and of a Thick∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oportion'd to their Use.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is not among the many <HI>Com∣plaints</HI> in this City, any one that is <HI>juster</HI>, or more <HI>common</HI>, than that of the great <HI>Price of Coals in the Winter</HI>; by which means it sometimes has happen'd, that many <HI>Poor People</HI> have been nigh starv'd to Death, and Persons of <HI>moderate Sub∣stance</HI> considerably Inconvenienc'd.</P>
<P>We believe we shall do an <HI>Universal good Work</HI>, if we point out some Means for an <HI>Ease to this Burthen</HI>. And the rather, since there is not a Family in <HI>London</HI>, but may, with no further Trouble than the Labour of a Servant, conti∣nually furnish themselves with large Coal for Firing, as useful as <HI>Scotch-Coal</HI>, at a Third Part of the Charge they are now at for common <HI>Sea-Coal</HI>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Expence</HI>, which is necessary for beginning this Work, is very <HI>inconsiderable</HI>, in Comparison with the <HI>Benefit</HI>, and is but for <HI>once</HI>. After which the Materials are serviceable for ever, and require no Additional Charges. But People, who
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
can't well afford to lay out the Money, how little soever, they may without it perform all the La∣bour <HI>by Hand</HI>, and that with much Ease, in Re∣gard they consume a <HI>less Quantity</HI> of Fuel.</P>
<P>But they, who are <HI>able</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> to be at the above-meant Expence, must give Orders to some <HI>Iron-Millmaker</HI>, to furnish them with a Mill some∣what <HI>bigger</HI>, and <HI>stronger</HI> than a <HI>Malt-Mill</HI>, but of the same kind of <HI>Make</HI>, with a Hopper upon it, which will hold a good deal more than a Bushel; the Figure of which you may see in the Cut.</P>
<P>This Mill should be plac'd in some Corner of the Coal-Cellar, and the Coals, which are laid in for the Use of the Family, may be just a <HI>Fourth Part</HI> of the Quantity, which they formerly burnt. And whereas it is usual at present, for People to chuse out the <HI>largest</HI>, and most <HI>lumpy Coal</HI> they can get; the fittest for their Purpose in this <HI>new Im∣provement</HI>, will be the <HI>smallest</HI>, and most <HI>broken</HI>, even, if possible, the very <HI>Sifting</HI> of the Wharfin∣gers Coal-Heaps.</P>
<P>The Coal, when laid into the Cellar, must▪ as Leisure and Opportunity offer, be <HI>ground down in the Mill</HI>, by the Labour of some Servant, or a Workman, who may be hir'd for the Purpose. The Mill must be <HI>set</HI> so, as to grind very <HI>fine</HI>; for the smaller the Powder, the fitter for the Business. And if any Coals are too big for the Teeth of the Mill, 'twill be easy for the Workman to <HI>break them</HI> with a Mallet, and thereby reduce them to a Size more convenient.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22"/>While the Coal is thus Grinding, and laid up in a Readiness in one Corner of the Cellar, some Lightermen, Ballastmen, or Bargemen, must be agreed with for a Quantity of that <HI>black Owsy Mud</HI>, which is common on both Sides the <HI>Thames</HI>, from Low-Water-Mark to the Banks of the River, and which may also be met with in all <HI>Ponds, Canals</HI>, and the <HI>Ditches</HI> of <HI>Gardiners, Whitsers</HI>, and <HI>Marsh-Lands</HI>, which abound beyond Number in the <HI>flat</HI> Grounds below Bridge.</P>
<P>It is to be noted, that, for the better Conve∣niency of <HI>Carriage</HI>, the Owse may be thrown up to <HI>dry</HI> in round Heaps, above Highwater-Mark, by which Means, when the <HI>Lighters</HI> deliver it to <HI>Carmen</HI>, they may bring it <HI>in Sacks</HI>, or <HI>without</HI>, at their Pleasure.</P>
<P>When the Owse and the Coal are both ready in the Cellar, the Workman must <HI>mix</HI> them as follows: To every Shovel-full of the Powder of <HI>Coal</HI>, he must throw in Three Shovels full of <HI>Owse</HI>, and work, beat, and mingle them together, till he has got a large Heap in the middle of the Cellar. He must then make a Hollow in the Top of the Heap, and pour in a Quantity of Wa∣ter, just enough to give <HI>Moistness</HI> and <HI>Consistence</HI> to the Mixture; after which, he must <HI>back, beat</HI> and <HI>labour it together</HI> with the Edges, and Back of a Spade, till 'tis thoroughly prepared, and will <HI>cut close</HI> like Wax.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23"/>He must then, with his Hands, make it up into <HI>Balls</HI>, about the Size of a <HI>large Cannon Bullet</HI>, and lay them to <HI>Dry</HI>, in the manner of <HI>Pyramids</HI>, that the Air passing easily through the Hollows, be∣tween Ball and Ball, may <HI>harden</HI> and fit them for the Use, they are made for.</P>
<P>For the better <HI>comprehending</HI> all this, we have represented the several Parts of the Work in a Cut, Number 2.</P>
<P>We have narrowly search'd, by Experience, into the Charges, and the Benefits of this new Fuel: The Expence in the <HI>whole</HI>, brings the <HI>Culm-Balls</HI>, when fit for the Fire, to less than <HI>Four Pence per Bushel</HI>, supposing the <HI>Coals</HI> to be furnish'd at the <HI>best Hand</HI>, and in the <HI>Summer Season</HI>; and yet, for <HI>Pleasure</HI>, for <HI>Heat</HI>, for <HI>long Burning</HI>, and <HI>Cleanliness, One</HI> Bushel of <HI>this</HI> is worth <HI>Two</HI> of Sea-Coal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Figure</HI> of a <HI>Fire</HI> made of <HI>Culm-Balls</HI>, is exactly what you see it in the <HI>Cut</HI>. The Owse is so <HI>Fat</HI>, and so <HI>naturally Combustible</HI>, that 'tis im∣possible for any Thing to burn with so <HI>striking</HI> a <HI>Liveliness</HI>; it throws out a forcible, glowing, and regular Heat; it continues to burn from Six to Eight Hours, with scarce any visible Lessening: And it neither <HI>falls out</HI> through the Grate, like small Dusty Coals, nor makes any foul <HI>Smoak</HI>, or heavy dark <HI>Ashes</HI>, but goes off, to the last, with a clear sprightly <HI>Brightness</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>Every Thing, we know, is a <HI>Difficulty</HI> to the Doubtful. And we are sensible (though nothing can be more Plain and Practicable) that <HI>most pri∣vate Families</HI> will be backward in <HI>changing</HI> a Method, made easy, and establish'd by <HI>Custom:</HI> We therefore, in a more particular manner, re∣commend this Improvement to <HI>Wharf-Men</HI>; and those who <HI>sell Coals:</HI> They have very convenient <HI>Situations</HI> for the Business; for the <HI>Owse</HI>, here re∣quir'd, lies every where round them, and they may not only draw an unthought-of <HI>Profit</HI> to <HI>themselves</HI> from the Practice, but be also a Means of great <HI>Service</HI> to the <HI>Poor</HI>, and a <HI>Pleasure</HI> to <HI>all Men</HI>.</P>
<P>If ever the Use of this <HI>new</HI> Sort of <HI>Fuel</HI> shou'd gain Ground, and grow <HI>general</HI>, the City of <HI>London</HI> has, in its Neighbourhood, an inexhau∣stible <HI>Magazine</HI> of the <HI>Owse</HI> we have been speak∣ing of, which was occasion'd by the great <HI>Breach at Dagenham</HI>, which has, many Years, <HI>drown'd</HI> a large Parcel of <HI>Land</HI>▪ insomuch, that at present there are Twelve Hundred Acres overflow'd every Tide, and all cover'd high with a new Surface of <HI>Owse</HI>, whose extraordinary Fertility has shot up a Forest of <HI>Reeds, Flags</HI>, and <HI>Rushes</HI>, of a mon∣strous Height: And the Roots are so thick, and deep in the Earth, that for Eight or Ten Inches, the <HI>Top</HI> being <HI>pair'd away</HI>, and cut <HI>into Squares</HI>, of the Shape and Size of <HI>half a Brick</HI>, wou'd be∣come, when grown <HI>dry</HI>, the best <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in the World, <HI>without Mixture</HI>, being <HI>half Wood</HI>, and <HI>half Turf</HI>; and as any Man, by <HI>Computation</HI>, will presently see, (supposing the Earth to be pair'd

but Six Inches down, which is not half what it has <HI>gain'd</HI> since the <HI>Breach</HI>,) the Fuel so obtain'd upon every Acre, would be more than <HI>Ten Thou∣sand Bushels</HI>; which, at Three Pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel, were a Profit of above <HI>a Hundred Pound from each Acre</HI>, and the <HI>Land</HI> all the while <HI>not da∣mag'd</HI> to the Value of a <HI>Farthing</HI>; so that a very odd <HI>Paradox</HI> might arise from the Accident, <HI>that the Owners of this Land might make far greater Profit by it, in its present ruin'd Condition, than they cou'd have reap'd, when it was at its best common Value</HI>.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY III.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING <HI>touch'd</HI> an Occasional Pro∣spect in the <HI>Close</HI> of the foregoing <HI>Essay</HI>, concerning a probable Profit to be made of the overflow'd Marsh-Lands at <HI>Dagenham</HI>, we shall, in what fol∣lows, propose a new, easy, and very cheap Method for <HI>shutting up that Breach</HI>; and not only that, but all others, which already <HI>are made</HI>, or which here∣after <HI>may happen</HI>, whether by Force of the <HI>Sea</HI>, or of <HI>Rivers</HI>.</P>
<P>We particularly aim this Discourse as a <HI>Hint</HI>, which may do Service to a worthy and ingenious Gentleman, who has, for some Time, been engag'd in a Work of this Nature at the Place above∣mention'd; it being conceiv'd, upon rational Grounds, that this very Breach, when <HI>at worst</HI>, might have been <HI>stopt</HI> by such Measures, as we shall <HI>lay down</HI>, for less than a <HI>Tenth Part</HI> of the Charge, which it has occasion'd in vain, even be∣fore it was undertaken by the present Adventurer, whose Experience, and former Successes in Works of this kind, give us hopes it will <HI>now</HI> be accom∣plish'd.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28"/>About Eight Years ago, in the Night, by the force of a violent Wind, a High Tide bore too hard upon the Banks; and the <HI>Marsh Wall</HI>, as they call it, which is the <HI>River Bank, giving way</HI>, the Wa∣ter <HI>flow'd through</HI>, and came over the Pastures.</P>
<P>The Neglect of this Breach, or the too weak and slow Progress, which was <HI>then</HI> made against it, gave the River a Power to enlarge its Invasions, till at last they became <HI>irresistible</HI>; and opening a Passage of a Hundred Yards wide, the Tide rushes through it with a Swiftness and Violence, which cannot be so much as imagin'd, but by seeing it. And the numberless <HI>Fluxes</HI> and <HI>Refluxes</HI> having <HI>worn away the Bottom</HI> to a very great depth, the Endeavours of several Gentlemen, at prodigious Expences, were too weak to withstand its <HI>over∣bearing</HI>: For the <HI>Piles</HI>, or huge Trees, with sharp Iron-shod Points, which they caus'd to be <HI>driven down</HI>, being <HI>sapp'd</HI> and <HI>undermin'd</HI>, by the <HI>letting in</HI> of the Waters at their Bottom, were <HI>born up</HI> on a sudden, and the <HI>Chalk-stones, Bags of Earth</HI>, and <HI>Bank Rubbish</HI> they supported, were of course <HI>wash'd away</HI> by the Deluge.</P>
<P>The Point to be gain'd, for effectually <HI>Inning</HI> this terrible Breach, is, to close up the Throat of its Channel with a Bank of such Strength and So∣lidity, as to bear all the Force of the Stream, while 'tis <HI>Raising</HI>, and the great Weight of Water, which will assault, and lie against it, when 'tis <HI>Raised</HI>.</P>
<P>To which End, the Reader may be pleased to take notice, that the natural Soil of the Place is an excellent <HI>Clay</HI>, and if a <HI>Brick-work</HI> were erected
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
<HI>on each side the Breach</HI>, they might make <HI>large strong Bricks</HI> of a new kind, on purpose, <HI>in Moulds of Two Foot Square</HI>, or more, with <HI>Holes</HI> here and there left <HI>through them</HI> in their forming, which would make them <HI>dry easily</HI>.</P>
<P>Such large Bricks as these are <HI>common</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI>, and frequently us'd in the <HI>Walls</HI> of their <HI>Castles</HI>. They deliver them at the Makers for about <HI>Five Pound the Thousand</HI>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Largeness</HI> of these Bricks, when made at the Breach, will be no way a <HI>hinderance to their Burning</HI>; for not only the <HI>Quantity</HI> of Fuel is pro∣portion'd to their <HI>size</HI>, but the <HI>Holes</HI>, which pass through them, by admitting the Heat, make their Hardening as easy, as if they were smaller: And it is to be observ'd, that the purpose, for which we are making these Bricks, will require no Nicety of <HI>Colour</HI>; and they may therefore be burnt without Trouble, or Caution.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Earth</HI> for the Bricks is the <HI>Product</HI> of the <HI>Place</HI>, so also may be the <HI>Fuel</HI> for their <HI>Burn∣ing</HI>: The huge Reeds abounding, as we mention'd before, over all the drown'd Land, being <HI>cut up and dry'd</HI>, is the finest and properest Matter, which cou'd be wish'd for the purpose, and especially, as it may be assisted by the tough stringy Substance, than which the whole World cannot yield a more excellent Fuel.</P>
<P>Thus, without the Expence, or the Trouble of Carriage, is provided what store can be wanted of these new Materials, and it only remains to disco∣ver their <HI>Uses</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30"/>In proportion to the Strength and Depth of the Water, must the <HI>Breadth</HI> of a <HI>Bank</HI> be design'd; In the Case we are speaking of, <HI>a Hundred Foot broad</HI> shall be pitched on as a Standard, and (<HI>the Place for the Bank being chosen, and mark'd out)</HI> exactly in the midst of the space 'tis to rise in, must be laid, as may be seen in the Cut, a strong <HI>Float</HI>, Floar'd with Deal, and built upon small Boats, or <HI>Pontons</HI>, and of Length enough to reach quite cross the Breach, kept exact to its Place, between <HI>Piles on each Shore</HI>, or by any <HI>other</HI> Means they like better, and easily <HI>rising</HI> and <HI>sinking</HI> with the <HI>Flood</HI> or the <HI>Ebb</HI>: The <HI>Breadth</HI> of the Float may be Fifteen or Twenty Foot over.</P>
<P>The Brick-kilns on either side the Breach, must, as you may see in the Cut, stand close to the Edge of the Chanel, for the more swift and easy Convey∣ance of the <HI>Breach-stones</HI>, as we will call them, to the Place of their Service on the Float-Bridge, which may be done in <HI>Wheelbarrows</HI>, as in the Cut, or by any other readier Method.</P>
<P>There must be several Workmen continually em∣ploy'd in <HI>carrying the Breach-stones</HI>, and others, who <HI>apply them to their Use</HI>, which last need not be more than <HI>Twenty</HI>; that is, one Man to every five Yards of the Length of the Float, supposing the Breach to be <HI>a Hundred Yards over</HI>.</P>
<P>These Twenty Men, standing every one in his proper place upon the Float, will have nothing to do, but to take up the Breach-stones, which are brought to them by the other Labourers, and roll
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
them gently over the side of the Float <HI>down into the Water</HI>.</P>
<P>Their great <HI>Weight</HI>, for they are, as was said be∣fore, exact Squares of two Foot every way, which is <HI>Eight Foot solid</HI>, will, in spite of the Rapidity, and Depth of the Stream, carry them <HI>down</HI>, with very little sloping, <HI>to the Bottom of the Channel</HI>; and when they are <HI>there</HI>, the same weight will be sure to keep them <HI>steddy</HI>; and <HI>other Breach-stones</HI> falling presently after them, will lie either <HI>near</HI>, or <HI>upon them</HI>, and so as the <HI>Number, let fall</HI>, grows <HI>greater</HI>, the <HI>Ridge</HI>, they will make, becomes <HI>higher</HI>, and consequently <HI>weaker</HI>; and the Force of the Stream, gaining Power enough to <HI>overturn</HI> it, will do service to the Work: For the Stones, which are so overthrown by the Current, must fall some∣times to the Right, and sometimes to the Left, and they will by that means <HI>always cover new Ground</HI>, within the compass of the design'd Bank, and so <HI>by widening the Work</HI>, afford a Foundation for a Superstructure of the same kind, which by be∣coming <HI>still broader and broader</HI>, will at last be too strong for the whole Force of the Current.</P>
<P>It must be noted, that as these Breach-stones will fall and fix themselves, some upon their <HI>Points</HI>, others upon their <HI>Flats</HI>, and some again upon their <HI>Edges</HI>; so they will naturally leave large <HI>Hollows</HI>, and considerable Vacancies between Stone and Stone, of various Forms and Sizes: And, as the <HI>Stream</HI> in this, and all other Breaches, runs extreamly <HI>thick</HI>, and <HI>muddy</HI>, all these hollow Places will be filled by the <HI>gradual Settlings</HI> of the <HI>Mud within them</HI>; by which means the Bricks will be <HI>fix'd strongly</HI> in
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
their several Positions, and all <HI>join'd together</HI>, as a Wall is with Mortar.</P>
<P>This Use of the thick muddy Water will be much help'd and forwarded, if with constant Re∣gard to the Current of the Tide, a <HI>Liter</HI> lies at Anchor, as in the Cut, at a reasonable distance from the Work, and several Men are employ'd on Board her, two or three times a Day, to stir and rake up the Bottom with long Iron-pointed Poles, that so the Water, being <HI>troubled</HI> more than ordinary, may convey among the Work a greater Quantity of the desir'd <HI>muddy Settlement</HI>.</P>
<P>It is plain, that in an Attempt of this kind there cou'd be scarce a <HI>Possibility</HI> of <HI>Miscarriage</HI>▪ for every <HI>Overthrow</HI> of the <HI>Bank</HI>, the <HI>Ruin</HI> of all <HI>common</HI> Works of this Nature, wou'd be an infal∣lible means of <HI>increasing its Strength</HI>, till having attain'd the Breadth of about <HI>Eighty</HI>, or a <HI>Hundred Foot</HI>, it wou'd be <HI>afterwards</HI> impossible for any Force of Water to destroy, or weaken it.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the <HI>swelling</HI> and <HI>beating</HI> of the River against it, would become of <HI>Service</HI> to the Work, when 'twas finish'd, because every Tide wou'd of course leave a <HI>New Coat of Mud</HI> upon the Slope, as we observe on the steep shelving Shores of almost all great Rivers.</P>
<P>The Work it self may, after it is once begun, be carry'd on without Intermission, till compleated, Day or Night, Summer or Winter, High-water or Low, being equally fit for this Business: And a sufficient Quantity of the square Bricks being first provided, we conceive that in three Weeks, or a
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
Month at farthest, <HI>Dagenham Breach</HI> might be <HI>se∣curely shut up</HI> by this easy method.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Charge</HI>, it will be necessary that we say a word or two on that Head, for the Satisfacti∣on of some Readers, who are not accustom'd to <HI>Computations</HI> of this kind, and possibly may <HI>over∣rate</HI> it in their Random Conceptions.</P>
<P>The Reader may please to remember, what we declar'd in the foregoing Parts of this Essay, that in <HI>Italy</HI>, such Bricks, or larger, are us'd in the Walls of their Castles, and Under-ground Build∣ings, such as <HI>Arches</HI> and <HI>Foundations</HI>; and that the Price at the Makers is after the Rate of <HI>Five Pound a Thousand</HI>; and certainly that will be more than they can fairly be reckon'd at in our Case, when we consider that <HI>Clay</HI> for their <HI>Making</HI>, and <HI>Fuel</HI> for their <HI>Burning</HI>, the Two dearest Articles, are <HI>here</HI> to be had on the <HI>Spot</HI>, and that <HI>Gratis</HI>, which in <HI>Italy</HI> is very much otherwise.</P>
<P>If then we allow, that the Price of our Bricks will be <HI>Five Pounds per Thousand</HI>, it only remains to compute, <HI>how many</HI> the Work will require, and what Number of <HI>Workmen</HI>.</P>
<P>And because we will be sure not to <HI>under-reckon</HI> the Charge, we will imagine the Bank to be built like a <HI>Wall</HI>, close cemented together, and as wide at the Top as the Bottom; whereas on the contra∣ry, such Banks are <HI>sloping both ways</HI>, and much <HI>narrowest upward</HI>; and the Breach-stones <HI>not close join'd</HI>, but kept <HI>wide</HI> by a very considerable Quan∣tity of fat Earth between them. However, a Wall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndred Foot long, One Hundred Foot
<PB N="32" REF="34" MS="y"/>
broad, and Fifty Foot high, (much more than is necessary) will take up in the whole, <HI>One Hundred</HI> and <HI>Eighty Seven Thousand Five Hundred</HI> such Bricks, which at Five Pounds <HI>per Thousand</HI>, will amount to <HI>Nine Hundred Thirty Seven Pounds Ten Shillings</HI>▪ for the Bricks, which will be necessary.</P>
<P>If it were possible (which it is not) to find a whole <HI>Months Employment</HI> for a <HI>Hundred</HI> Day-Labourers, in filling up the Breach with these Bricks, when prepar'd, their <HI>Wages</HI>, at the highest Rates usually given, wou'd fall under <HI>Two Hun∣dred Pounds</HI>; and if, for the <HI>Float</HI>, and the ne∣cessary Hire of <HI>Lighters</HI>, and <HI>Boats</HI>, and such <HI>other Expences, Three Hundred Pound more</HI> be thrown into the Reckoning, it appears by as Rational a Guess, as can be given, that this Breach might be Inn'd with Security, and lasting Solidity, for a less Sum than <HI>Fifteen Hundred Pounds</HI>; and we are much misinform'd, if <HI>already</HI> there has not been laid out upon it <HI>above as many Thousands</HI>, without taking into the Account the Expence of the present Undertaker.</P>
<P>Having talk'd in this Essay of the <HI>Brickmakers</HI> Art, we will embrace the Occasion to give a pro∣fitable Hint to the <HI>Masons</HI>, and <HI>Bricklayers</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>London</HI>, which may also be of considerable Plea∣sure, and Service to all Gentlemen, or others, who concern themselves with <HI>Building</HI>.</P>
<P>There is nothing more Graceful <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which, of late, has got Ground; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Corners, and Window-work of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Houses with <HI>Stone-work:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Method would soon be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not, that the great <HI>Price</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="33" REF="35" MS="y"/>
the <HI>Trouble</HI> of their <HI>bringing to London</HI>, and their <HI>Hewing</HI>, and <HI>Squaring</HI> when here, were a Charge beyond most Mens good Liking, or Capacity.</P>
<P>But this Objection will no longer have Force, if we put our Town Builders in Mind of a way to procure <HI>Artificial Stonework</HI>, as cheap as their Bricks, and of much more Whiteness, and Beau∣ty, than the best Stone now us'd in our Build∣ings.</P>
<P>This is easily done by preparing <HI>white Clay</HI>, as the <HI>Pipemakers</HI> do, and then <HI>casting it in Moulds</HI>, of what Bigness they please, either Square, or of any other Figure they fancy: After which they must <HI>Bake</HI> them to the requisite Hardness, and they will be <HI>glossy, white, strong</HI>, and <HI>durable</HI>, and not only lighter than Stone in the Handling, but immediately ready for <HI>laying together</HI>, without any Trouble of <HI>Cutting</HI>, or <HI>Polishing</HI>.</P>
<P>By the same way may be imitated <HI>Plain Stone Pillars</HI>, or <HI>Fluted</HI>, of any <HI>Bigness</HI>, or <HI>Order</HI>; and if a <HI>Hollow</HI> be left through the <HI>Middle</HI> in their <HI>Making</HI>, they will <HI>dry</HI> with much Ease, and be found of no small Advantage in Building. The Practice may be also apply'd to the Moulding of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth Stones</HI>, and <HI>Chimney-Pieces:</HI> And, if in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> white Clay, they would mingle a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ariety of <HI>Colours</HI>, such as <HI>Yellow</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Spanish Brown</HI>, common <HI>Indigo</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in strong <HI>Lye</HI>, and scatter here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> small <HI>Filings</HI> of <HI>Brass</HI> and <HI>White</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> conceive what a Beauti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> would imitate. But <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to <HI>ram</HI> the <HI>Clay</HI> very
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
<HI>hard</HI> down into the Moulds they would form it in, because, upon that, depends chiefly the Polish, and smooth shining Surface of the Com∣position.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bricklayers</HI>, by causing their Bricks to be made, in like Manner, in <HI>Moulds</HI>, form'd with all the Embelishments us'd in their <HI>finest Work∣manship</HI>, would save themselves the Labour and Charge of Cementing together huge <HI>Lumps</HI> of <HI>Brickwork</HI>, on Purpose that they may afterwards be able to <HI>cut</HI>, and <HI>carve out</HI> the Forms, which they might as easily by this Means <HI>have them cast in at first</HI>.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Makers</HI> of <HI>Bricks</HI> will doubtless be un∣willing to go <HI>out of their Road</HI>; and may offer, by way of <HI>Objection</HI>, That it will be impossible to <HI>burn</HI> any Bricks to Perfection, which are made of such Thickness, and Substance, as will be requir'd to some kind of Mouldwork.</P>
<P>Experience is the fairest Confuter of Difficulties: And in Answer to any such Objections as these, we need only observe, That Sir <HI>John Winter</HI> did, long since, make Trial, and <HI>demonstrate</HI>, that 'tis <HI>easy</HI> to <HI>burn</HI> Bricks of any Thickness, or Form; as was plain from the huge <HI>Earthen Backs</HI>, and <HI>Fire-Hearths</HI>, which have been publickly seen And as for the <HI>Strength</HI>, and <HI>Duration</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch Works, it may plainly be <HI>affirm'd</HI>, from the Pra∣ctice now frequent in <HI>England</HI>, of carrying <HI>Water</HI> a great way under Ground, in Pipes made of Earth, and well <HI>luted</HI> at the Joints; which are found to resist all Extremities of Weather; and
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
though infinitely <HI>cheaper</HI>, are as Lasting and Ser∣viceable as <HI>Leaden</HI>, or <HI>Timber</HI> ones.</P>
<P>We may add to these Proofs, the <HI>Barnstaple Ovens</HI> of <HI>Devonshire</HI>, which are now made, and us'd in <HI>some other Counties</HI>; and being first form'd of common <HI>Potters Clay</HI>, in <HI>one entire Piece</HI>, are not only cleaner, and cheaper than any other Ovens, but bake with more <HI>Evenness</HI>, and <HI>Certainty</HI>, and consume <HI>not a Fourth of the Fuel</HI>, which is wasted in those of the ordinary Fashion in <HI>London</HI>, and <HI>elsewhere</HI>.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>UR Publishing the useful Instru∣ction, which composes this <HI>Essay</HI>, was owing entirely to a very <HI>odd Accident</HI>, which will be told you in the Sequel, and which, besides the <HI>particular</HI> Benefit, may afford us the Ad∣vantage of this <HI>General</HI> Application, That <HI>the Negligence of Men is so great, and universal, that CHANCE has a visible Hand in the Discovery of every Thing Useful, or Ornamental to Life</HI>.</P>
<P>Nor will it be an unpleasant Amusement, to produce a most famous <HI>Example</HI> in the following Story.</P>
<P><HI>Gonsalvo Peralta</HI>, an old <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchant, who resided in one of the Cities of <HI>Peru</HI>, was equally remarkable for his <HI>Wealth</HI>, and his <HI>Ava∣rice:</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
His natural Disposition to heap up his Stores, made him rigidly watchful over the Labours of his <HI>Negroes</HI>, and frequently induc'd him to <HI>punish</HI> them with a barbarous Severity.</P>
<P>One among these black Sufferers, who was either less able to <HI>bear</HI> than the rest, or more apt to <HI>provoke</HI>, ran away from his Master's Plan∣tation, and rambled, Day and Night, through the Woods, and wild Coverts of that thin-Peopled Country, under constant, and ter∣rible Apprehensions to be met, or overtaken by the <HI>Guards</HI> of <HI>Light-Horse</HI>, who are sent out to <HI>Patrole</HI> up and down, upon all such Occasions.</P>
<P>He imagin'd one Day, that he heard at a Di∣stance the <HI>Approaches of Horsemen</HI>, and in order to avoid them, thought it safest to <HI>climb up</HI> a Mountain, on whose <HI>Side</HI> he was travelling, and which <HI>rose</HI> from that Place with a <HI>horrible Steep∣ness:</HI> Accordingly, with infinite Difficulty, he was got to a very considerable Height, when taking hold accidentally of a thick, stubby <HI>Branch</HI>, which hung over a Rock, with Design, by its Assistance, to help himself higher, the Tree, by his Weight, was drawn out by the Roots, and together with the <HI>Negro</HI>, roll'd down with much Swiftness to the bottom of the Mountain.</P>
<P>The poor Wretch lay long without Motion, or Sense, (the Effect of his Fright, and some
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
dangerous Bruises,) but when he came to him∣self, he found his Hand <HI>clos'd on the Branch</HI>, which had occasion'd his Tumble, and per∣ceiv'd at its Root a considerable Quantity of <HI>rich Silver Oar</HI>, which lay entangled with the Fibres.</P>
<P>He bethought himself, on a little Reflection, that this lucky Discovery of a Mine of that Metal, which his Master was so fond of, would procure him his <HI>Liberty</HI>, or soften at least the <HI>Severity</HI> of his <HI>Usage:</HI> With this View he <HI>went back</HI>, and giving full <HI>Information</HI> of the Acci∣dent, proper Searches were made; and to this <HI>small Beginning</HI>, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions owe all the Wealth, which abounds inexhausta∣bly in the famous, and so much envy'd <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Potosi</HI>.</P>
<P>We have shorten'd the Circumstances of the <HI>foregoing</HI> Relation, that we might not detain you too long from <HI>another</HI>, out of which, as we hinted before, we have taken Occasion to form the Essay we are about to present you.</P>
<P>Toward the End of that unseasonable <HI>Au∣tumn</HI>, which happen'd last Year but one, the Wife of a Farmer, in that Part of <HI>Kent</HI> call'd the <HI>Wild</HI>, gather'd <HI>in</HI> a great Quantity of <HI>Green un∣ripe Grapes</HI>, which the Sun had not Power to bring to Maturity, with Design to make <HI>Ver∣juice</HI>; and to that End she press'd, and prepar'd them, as is usual in making that Liquor; but whether the <HI>Vine</HI> was of a particular <HI>Species</HI>, or
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
the Grapes were grown <HI>riper</HI> than she thought them, or to what <HI>other</HI> Cause it was owing, is unknown: But when, after some Months <HI>lying by</HI>, she came to open her Vessel, and examine its Condition, the <HI>Verjuice</HI> she expected, was an excellent <HI>Wine</HI>, of a high sprightly Relish, sparkling briskly in the Glass, and as clear as Rock-Water.</P>
<P>This <HI>perfect</HI>, however <HI>unexpected</HI> Operation of <HI>Nature her self</HI>, gave some Gentlemen of our Society, a convincing Demonstration of what they had long believ'd possible, That <HI>England</HI> wants <HI>Wine of her own</HI>, not through any <HI>Defect</HI> in her <HI>Climate</HI>, but the Omission of due <HI>Industry</HI> in her negligent <HI>Natives</HI>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vintners</HI>, and <HI>Winecoopers</HI>, will have Reason to thank us, if we furnish their Cellars without paying <HI>Custom</HI>. And the Owners of <HI>Lands</HI>, which are fit for this Purpose, will not scruple a Bumper of their <HI>First-born</HI> new Pro∣duct, to the Health of our Society, if in the Course of this Essay, we make undeniable the following Particulars: That this <HI>fortunate Island</HI> is fitter than most Parts of <HI>France</HI>, for the Pro∣pagation of <HI>Vineyards:</HI> That, till about <HI>Six Hun∣dred Years since</HI>, it was as common to make <HI>Wine</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, as it is now to make <HI>Malt:</HI> By what means it happen'd, that the <HI>Planting of Vineyards</HI> became <HI>discontinued</HI>: And how it may easily be <HI>restored</HI> to the general Practice, so that <HI>Wine</HI> may be afforded as <HI>cheap</HI>, as our <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is at present.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="43"/>In the first Place, 'tis true, that <HI>some Parts of France</HI>, such as <HI>Orleans, Provence</HI>, and <HI>Lan∣guedoc</HI>, (which are famous for <HI>Wines</HI>,) are seated much nearer the Sun, and are fitter in other Respects, than most Parts of this <HI>Island</HI>. But again, there are some of the finest <HI>French Wines</HI>, which grow about <HI>Paris, Beauvais, Diep, Arles</HI>, and <HI>Ruille:</HI> And several of these Places (as may be seen in the <HI>Maps</HI>) are as <HI>Nor∣therly</HI> Seated, as the Latitudes of some Parts of <HI>England</HI>, particularly the <HI>South-West of Devon∣shire</HI>, about <HI>Dartmouth</HI>, and more especially the Islands of <HI>Guernsey</HI>, and <HI>Jersey</HI>. We need not mention some Tracks of the <HI>Rhine</HI>, the <HI>Mo∣selle</HI>, and other Rivers in <HI>Germany</HI>, so famous for the <HI>Old Hock</HI>, and <HI>Rhenish</HI>, which are none of the worst Wines we deal in. It is plain, then, it is not our <HI>Distance from the Sun</HI>, which occasions this Deficiency: Let us see, if we owe it to our <HI>Air</HI>, or our <HI>Weather</HI>.</P>
<P>In both these Particulars we shall find an Ad∣vantage in our <HI>Favour:</HI> The Severity of the Winters in <HI>France</HI>, nay, in <HI>Italy it self</HI>, must be own'd to be visibly <HI>greater</HI> than in <HI>England</HI>, and their Frosts are so lasting, and so nipping, that 'tis no <HI>rare</HI> Misfortune, to find their <HI>Vine∣yards</HI> destroy'd by that Means, very forward in <HI>April</HI>. On the contrary, <HI>our Winters</HI> are <HI>mild</HI>, and our <HI>Frosts</HI> much <HI>less piercing</HI>; which Bene∣fits we owe to the <HI>Grossness</HI> of our <HI>Air</HI>, and our <HI>Neighbourhood</HI> to the <HI>Ocean</HI>: Neither are we subject to those strange Storms of <HI>Hail</HI> in
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
the <HI>Summer</HI>, which are common in all the <HI>hot</HI> Countries of <HI>Europe</HI>; and sweeping, with a kind of Pestilential Sulphur, over great Tracks of Land, destroy all the Grapes in their Journey: We are liable, 'tis true, to a good deal more <HI>Rain</HI> than the <HI>Continent</HI>, and superfluous <HI>Moi∣sture</HI> must be own'd a great Enemy to <HI>Vine∣yards:</HI> But that Inconvenience may not only be <HI>avoided</HI> by the <HI>Manner of our Planting</HI>, but is infinitely more than <HI>atton'd for</HI> by our various Advantages.</P>
<P>Thus 'tis visible, that as to our Latitude, and the Temperature of our <HI>Climate</HI>, we are no way behind-hand with some of those Countries, from whom we supinely content our selves to be furnish'd with Wines, at what Rates they think fit to impose. But it is a <HI>remarkable Flaw</HI> in the <HI>Genius</HI> of our <HI>Nation</HI>, to distrust new Im∣provements, and believe nothing <HI>easy to be done</HI>, which is <HI>not done already</HI>; though perhaps 'tis a <HI>general Error</HI>, and infects <HI>Foreign</HI> Countries with an equal Stupidity. And our honest <HI>Un∣believers</HI> may keep themselves in Countenance, by remembring the Story of the <HI>Old Roman Sol∣diers</HI>, who were sent, as a Colony, to govern <HI>Alsatia</HI>, a most <HI>Fertile</HI>, and <HI>Southerly</HI> Province of <HI>Germany</HI>. These merry <HI>old Topers</HI> had a No∣tion, by some Means put into their Heads, that no <HI>Vines</HI> could grow in a Climate so <HI>cold</HI>, as that they were going to, and therefore they <HI>Muti∣ny'd</HI> against their <HI>Commanders</HI>, who, with no small Difficulty, brought them to believe, it was <HI>possible</HI> to cultivate <HI>Vineyards</HI> in <HI>Alsatia</HI>, as well as in <HI>Italy</HI>. But Experience convinc'd them as
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
soon as they <HI>try'd</HI>; and from that Time to this, the best Vines in <HI>Europe</HI> abound in that Coun∣try; from whence they have spread many Hun∣dred Miles more to the <HI>Northward</HI>. A Man might pleasantly argue from hence, that the <HI>Germans</HI>, and <HI>Italians</HI>, ow'd much of their Va∣lour to the good <HI>Wine</HI>, they drank of; which we offer as a Hint, to be made use of on Occasion, when it shall be objected to some honest Soldier over his Cups, that an <HI>English-Man can't fight with∣out Beef in his Belly</HI>.</P>
<P>But seriously to return to our Subject: Other Nations take Advantage to expose us unjustly, and ground their Reflections on our own Mis∣representation of our Country's Fertility: What fairer Example of this can be given, than a silly Observation we meet with in a <HI>French</HI> Book, Entituled, <HI>The Political Treasure</HI>; so notoriously false, that 'twere downright ridi∣culous to go about to confute it? <HI>It is true</HI>, says this Author, <HI>that their Island of</HI> Eng∣land <HI>abounds with good store of BUTTER, HARD CHEESE</HI>, and <HI>BLACK CAT∣TLE; nor do they (being Peopled but thinly) find any want of BREAD-CORN among them: But were they to endeavour to propagate the Conveniences and Superflu∣ities of</HI> FRANCE, <HI>they are modest enough to CONFESS, 'twou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be labouring in vain: And this, among their other Misfortunes, is a remarkable Deficiency, That HOPS can by no Art whatever be brought to grow with them</HI>. It is no wonder, that the <HI>French</HI> think our Country incapable of <HI>Vineyards</HI>, if
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
they will not allow the Poor <HI>Hop</HI> to find Nou∣rishment among us.</P>
<P>But now, from the <HI>Reason</HI> we will come to the <HI>Fact</HI>, and prove, That, in old Time, Vineyards <HI>actually did</HI> thrive in <HI>England</HI>. To this Day there remains, in all Parts of this Nation, the old Name of <HI>Vineyard</HI> to pieces of Land, which have never in the Memory of Man been employ'd to that Use; whence 'tis natural to argue, that they formerly <HI>were</HI> what they now bear the Name of. This, however, will pass for no more than a Pre∣sumptive Evidence; and the Laws of our Coun∣trey require clear and <HI>positive Proof</HI>, before Judg∣ment.</P>
<P>The learned Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> quotes several Instan∣stances, to prove that many Hundred Years since, it was common for <HI>Vineyards to flourish in</HI> England. The famous old Record, call'd <HI>Dooms-day Book</HI>, which is a kind of General Survey of Church Lands, and their Product, abounds in remarkable Proofs of the Matter before us; and mentions, particularly, how many Acres of <HI>Vines</HI> grew at <HI>Ely</HI> in <HI>Cambridgshire</HI>, and <HI>Leigh</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Essex</HI>; which are both so near <HI>London</HI>, that we chose those two Places in Preference to others Further, <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury</HI>, who liv'd before the Conquest, in describing the Blessings of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>, takes occasion to mention the <HI>Wine</HI>, that was every where made in his Time, with this Extraordinary <HI>Encomium</HI>, That it was <HI>equal</HI> to the <HI>French Wine</HI>, in every Thing to be <HI>lik'd</HI>, and infinitely <HI>exceeded</HI> it in this one Particu∣lar,
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
that it was not so subject to an <HI>unpleasant Tartness</HI>.</P>
<P>This may serve to convince the most diffident, that <HI>once we had Wine made among us</HI>: It remains to give a Guess at the Cause, <HI>why it was not con∣tinued to our Time</HI>. And this appears easy from <HI>Circumstances</HI> to be met with in our <HI>History</HI>; and the <HI>Consequences</HI>, which may be reasona∣bly subjoin'd, as the Natural <HI>Effects</HI> of such <HI>Causes</HI>.</P>
<P>When <HI>William the Conqueror</HI>, by his Acquisiti∣on of <HI>England</HI>, annex'd to its Dominions the Duke∣dom of <HI>Normandy</HI>, and its spacious Dependancies, it is reasonable to believe, that Himself, and his Successors, did, by all means, endeavour to esta∣blish a good Correspondence, and mutual Affecti∣on between his <HI>New</HI> People and his <HI>Old</HI>. The most effectual way to do this, was, by some means or other, to make <HI>England</HI> beholden to his Native Dominions, for a yearly Supply of some Product we wou'd <HI>least Care to want</HI>: Our Ancestors are recorded for a <HI>fam'd Hospitality:</HI> The want of good <HI>Wine</HI>, that Support of good <HI>Humour</HI>, cou'd never be brook'd by Men so dispos'd; wherefore it was but to <HI>find some Pretence for destroying the Vineyards of</HI> England; and it was a Conse∣quence that the Merchants of <HI>Gascoign</HI>, and other <HI>French</HI> Provinces, might pour in upon us a yearly Inundation of <HI>Wine</HI>, to supply the De∣mands which the <HI>Law</HI> made it <HI>penal</HI> to furnish <HI>at Home</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>Pretences cou'd never be wanting, to make this go down with the Multitude, as a <HI>National Bene∣fit</HI>; the <HI>Encouragement of Trade</HI>; the <HI>Increase of Navigation</HI>; the greater <HI>Aptness of Soil</HI> in those Countries, and the <HI>Witchcraft</HI> of <HI>Novelty</HI>: All these, and a great many more such Inducements, were sufficient to quiet the Clamour of the Peo∣ple, who were most <HI>immediately Sufferers</HI>, by the Destruction of their Vineyards: And the discon∣tinuance of Planting them, being once grown a <HI>Custom</HI>, Length of Time, wearing out the Remem∣brance of the <HI>Truth</HI>, the Distinction is not easily made between not being <HI>able</HI>, and not being <HI>suf∣fer'd</HI>.</P>
<P>There is nothing <HI>surprizing</HI>, or <HI>improbable</HI> in this Imagination; and it is not yet out of some Peoples Remembrance, when a <HI>Step very like it</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken, and the Growth of <HI>Tobacco</HI> in <HI>England</HI> was put down by Act of Parliament, for Advance∣ment of <HI>Trade</HI>, and Encouragement of <HI>Virginia</HI>; tho' many of our Countries, and <HI>Gloucestershire</HI> in particular, did not only produce Tobacco more pleasant, and fit for our Constitutions, but by that means made more Profit of their Lands, beyond all Comparison, than by any other Use they cou'd put them to.</P>
<P>Now if, hereafter, by some unforeseen Accident, the <HI>Records</HI> shou'd be <HI>lost</HI>, which give Light to this Matter, it is not unlikely, but <HI>Five or Six Hundred Years hence</HI>, when <HI>Virginia</HI> may possibly, by the Chances of Time, be under a distinct Juris∣diction,
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
it will generally be believ'd, that the <HI>Cli∣mate of</HI> England <HI>is unfit for Tobacco</HI>, and that <HI>there∣fore</HI> they are forc'd, at such a yearly Expence, to be supply'd from <HI>America</HI>.</P>
<P>But whatever may be thought of the <HI>Vineyards of old</HI>, the Matter in Hand will be out of Dispute, if the Reader informs himself, which he easily may, That even <HI>at this very time there are Vine∣yards in</HI> England, from whence has been made most agreeable <HI>Wine</HI>, in Quantity sufficient to furnish a great deal to the <HI>Vintners</HI> of <HI>London</HI>: As a Proof of which Fact, we need only men∣tion Sir <HI>William Basset</HI>'s known <HI>Vineyard</HI> near the <HI>Bath</HI>, Mr. <HI>Howard</HI>'s by <HI>Darking</HI> in <HI>Surry</HI>, and that of Sir <HI>John Mordaunt</HI> of <HI>Blackheath</HI> near <HI>London</HI>.</P>
<P>But tho' these, and some others, do often <HI>hit well</HI>, they are many times observ'd, and especi∣ally in unseasonable Years, to <HI>deceive</HI> very much the <HI>Expectation</HI> of their <HI>Owners</HI>; which Disappoint∣ments arise from <HI>two</HI> Principal <HI>Causes</HI>; their not chusing <HI>Grapes</HI> the most <HI>fit</HI> for our Climate, and their Planting the <HI>Vines</HI> in a <HI>manner as im∣proper</HI>.</P>
<P>If any Man therefore wou'd <HI>successfully</HI> nou∣rish a Vineyard, he need only give himself the Trouble of <HI>observing</HI> the Directions which fol∣low.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50" MS="y"/>The <HI>Situation</HI> shou'd face the <HI>South-East</HI>, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>South-West</HI>; the <HI>Soil</HI> shou'd be <HI>Gravelly, Light, Sandy</HI>, or <HI>Stony</HI>; the Side of a <HI>Hill</HI> should be cho∣sen, if possible, but <HI>plain</HI> Ground, in <HI>our</HI> way, will be almost as serviceable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grapes</HI>, which are <HI>proper for England</HI>, are such as are <HI>earliest</HI> ripe, most naturally <HI>hardy</HI>, and have small jagged Leaves, which <HI>shade</HI> not too much, but let in the <HI>Sun</HI> with a double Re∣freshment; such as these are the <HI>Canada Grape</HI>, the <HI>Vine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI>; the small <HI>Muscadel</HI>, and above all, that sort which abounds in the Vine∣yards, which lie every where round the City of <HI>Paris</HI>, from whence we may be furnish'd with well rooted Setts for about <HI>Six-Pence the Hun∣dred</HI>, not reckoning in the Charge of <HI>bringing them over</HI>.</P>
<P>But we wou'd recommend, instead of these <HI>small Setts</HI>, which are commonly bought, the Use of large full grown Roots, which are yearly cut up and thrown away about <HI>Paris</HI>, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng their Vineyards: For these may not only <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he had at as reasonable a Price as the other bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being pack'd up in Boxes, with Earth thrown between them, will come over without mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pence▪ since <HI>four Hundred</HI> such Roots are sufficient to plant a whole <HI>Acre</HI>; but will also shoot strongly, and bear Fruit the <HI>first Summer</HI>▪ whereas on the contrary, the <HI>small Setts</HI>, which are <HI>commonly planted</HI>, bear nothing at all in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee Years</HI>, and even <HI>then</HI> produce <HI>sparingly</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51"/>These Roots must be planted in long shal∣low Trenches, at the distance of Ten Foot one from the other; and the most flourishing Branches, as they rise, must be suffer'd to run, like our Peaches and Apricots, on the most Sun∣ny side of a low slight Wall, about Three Foot in Heighth, till they meet one another; after which, all superfluous Shoots must be kept down by Pruning; and if the Top of the Walls were made to <HI>hang over</HI>, by being built about Three Inches broader than the rest, they wou'd afford an infallible Security against all the <HI>Blasts</HI>, and ill Accidents, which frequently ruin an <HI>un∣guarded</HI> Vineyard.</P>
<P>The Walls will by no means be so expensive as may be thought, because they are built of the <HI>Pebbles, Flints</HI>, and rough <HI>Stones</HI>, which are eve∣ry <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere found <HI>upon the Spot</HI>, in Lands pro∣per for <HI>Vine-bearing</HI>, and plaister'd together with common <HI>Clay</HI> and Water: They must be built about Eight or Ten Foot from each other, so as one may not suffer by the Shadow of its Neighbour. They shou'd stand in such man∣ner, that the <HI>Allies</HI> between them may be open all Day to the <HI>Course of the Sun</HI>, and by that means the Vines will be also defended by the Walls at their Backs, from all noxious <HI>Winds</HI>, which might otherwise injure them: The Al∣lies should be cover'd, till within a Foot of the Vines, with a smooth <HI>Coat</HI> of <HI>Gravel</HI>, or <HI>Sand</HI>, or <HI>hard Stones</HI>, roll'd in, and kept free on the Surface from Grass, Weeds, or any
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
Growth whatever: All which is presented to the Eye, as correctly as cou'd be <HI>drawn</HI>, in the Cut which is prefix'd to this <HI>Essay</HI>.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Vines</HI>, being shelter'd from <HI>Winds</HI>, kept warm from all <HI>Frosts</HI>, not suffer'd to <HI>wast</HI> themselves by unprofitable shooting, but kept <HI>low</HI>, and within the full Influence of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s strong <HI>Reflection</HI> from the <HI>Walls</HI>, and the <HI>Al∣lies</HI>, will be Proof against any of the ordina∣ry Accidents, and Annually produce you a plen∣tiful Vintage, before the short Days, and lost Vigor of the Sun, can discourage them in ri∣pening.</P>
<P>It may possibly be a <HI>Spur</HI> to the <HI>Undertaking</HI>, if besides the great <HI>Pleasure</HI>, which wou'd fol∣low this Improvement, we observe what a <HI>Pro∣fit</HI> woud, as surely, attend it. To which End we need only relate, what is known for a Truth in all Parts of <HI>France</HI>, and most other Coun∣tries, that <HI>Sixteen Hogsheads of Wine</HI> is the com∣mon Increase, which, one Time with another, they expect from an <HI>Acre</HI>.</P>
<P>If, notwithstanding, these Cautions, it shou'd sometimes so happen, that by unseasonable, or extraordinary <HI>Wetness</HI>, or <HI>Coldness</HI> of <HI>Summers</HI>, the Grapes shou'd not <HI>Ripen</HI> so kindly, as they ought; the <HI>Germans</HI> have a Practice, which be∣ing, in such Case, made use of, were an easy and infallible <HI>Remedy</HI> against it. They have <HI>Stoves</HI> in their <HI>Cellars</HI>, which they always keep <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot by large Fires within them; and, by that
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
means, diffusing an equal and powerful <HI>Warmth</HI> among all their Vessels; their Wines, when they chance to be made of <HI>Green Grapes</HI>, work more kindly than ordinary; and, by an Artifi∣cial <HI>Digestion</HI>, throw <HI>off</HI>, and <HI>divest</HI> themselves of the <HI>Rawness</HI>. Other Nations produce the <HI>same End</HI> by a <HI>Means</HI> somewhat <HI>different</HI>; for they <HI>boil up</HI> their <HI>Must</HI>, or New Wine, till, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsiderable Evaporation of the watry Part, the Remainder assumes a new Colour, and becomes better body'd, and of admirable Relish.</P>
