<P>IN every society, whether of men or of the lower animals, viólence formed tyrants, mild authority constitutes kings. The lion and the tiger on the earth, the eagle and vulture in the
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
air, reign amidst the horrors of war, extend their domination by cruelty and the abuse of force. While the Swan upholds his stately empire on the water in gentleness and peace. Endowed with strength and vigour, and courage, but restrained by a sense of moderation and justice, he knows to fight and conquer, yet never urges an attack. Pacific king of the water-birds, he braves the tyrants of the air: he expects the eagle, without provoking and without fearing the rencounter. He repels his assaults, opposes to his talons the resistance of his feathers and the rapid strokes of a vigorous wing, which serves him as an <HI>aegis</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld and Aldrovandus.</NOTE>; and often does victory crown his exertions <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Animal,</HI> lib. ix. 2 and 16.</NOTE>. This is his only formidable enemy; all the other rave∣nous birds respect him; and he is at peace with all nature <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Illic innocui latè pascuntur olores.</HI> Ovid. <HI>Amor.</HI> 2. <HI>Eleg.</HI> 6.</NOTE>. He lives rather the friend than the monarch amidst the numerous tribes of aquatic birds, which all submit to his law. He is only the chief, the principal inhabitant of a peaceful republic <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The ancients believed that the Swans spared not only the birds but even the fishes; which Hesiod indicates in his Shield of Hercules, by representing fishes swimming at eàse beside the Swan.</NOTE>; nor have its citizens aught
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
to fear from a master who exacts no more than he grants, and whose sole wish is to enjoy tran∣quillity and freedom.</P>
<P>The graces of figure, the beauty of shape, correspond in the Swan to the mildness of his disposition: he pleases every eye; he decorates, embellishes every place that he frequents; he is beloved, extolled, admired <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Interest," says M. Baillon, <Q>“which has disposed man to subdue the quadrupeds and tame the birds, has had no part in the domestication of the Swan. Its beauty, and the elegance of its form, have engaged him to bring it to his habitation, merely to decorate it. It has always had more attention paid it than its fellow subjects; it has never been kept captive; it has been des∣tined to adorn the pieces of water in his gardens, and there per∣mitted to enjoy all the sweets of liberty.... The abundance and the choice of food have augmented the bulk of the tame swan; but its form has lost none of its elegance; it has preserved the same graces and the same freedom in all its motions; its majestic port is ever-admired; I doubt even whether all these qualities are found to equal extent in the wild bird.”</Q> <HI>Note communicated by M. Baillon, king's councellor and bailiff of Waben, at Montreuil-sur∣mer.</HI></NOTE>; and no species more deserves our applause. On none has na∣ture ever diffused so much of those noble and gentle graces, which recal the image of her most charming productions: elegant fashion of body; roundness of form; softness of outline <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mollior &amp; cygni plumis Galatea.</HI> Ovid. <HI>Metam.</HI> 13.</NOTE>; white∣ness resplendent and pure <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>White as a Swan.</HI> This proverb has obtained in all nations; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> was the expression of the Greeks, according to Sui∣das.<HI>—Galatea candidior cygnis,</HI> says Virgil.—In the language of the Syrians the name of white, and that of the Swan, were the same. <HI>Guillem. Pastregius. Lib. de orig. rerum.</HI></NOTE>; motions full of
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
flexibility and expression; attitudes, sometimes animated, sometimes gently languishing:—All the features and actions of the Swan breathe the voluptuousness, the enchantment which wrap our soul at the sight of grace and beauty; all de∣clare it, paint it, the bird of love <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Horace yokes the Swans to the car of Venus:

<P>Carm. lib. iii.</P></NOTE>; all jus∣tify the ingenious and sprightly mythology, that this delightful bird was the father of the most beautiful of women <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Helen, born of Leda and the Swan, whose form Jupiter is said by the ancients to have assumed: Euripides, to paint the beauty of Helen, and to allude, at the same time, to her birth, stiles her <HI>(Orest.</HI> act. v.) by the epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>with aspect lovely as the wings of the Swan.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The noble ease and freedom of its motions on the water bespeak it not only the first of the winged sailors, but the finest model presented by nature for the art of navigation <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">No figure was more frequent on the ships of the ancients than that of the Swan; it appeared on the prow, and the mariners es∣teemed it of good omen.</NOTE>. Its raised neck, and its round swelling breast exhibit the prow of a ship cleaving the waves; its broad stomach represents the keel; its body, pressed down before, rises behind into the stern; the tail is a genuine rudder; its feet are broad oars; and its wings, half opened to the wind, and
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
gently inflated, are the sails which impel the ani∣mated machine <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Finely described by our sublime poet, Milton:
<Q><L>"The swan with arched neck</L>
<L>"Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows</L>
<L>"Her state with oary feet."</L></Q>
<P><HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> Book vii.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Proud of his superiority, and emulous of dis∣tinction, the Swan seems forward to unveil his beauties; seeks to charm the spectators, and to command their applause. And the sight indeed captivates the eye, whether we behold the wing∣ed fleet at a distance gliding through the water, or view one, invited by signals <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Swan swims with much grace and rapidity when he chooses; he comes to those who call him. <HI>Salerne.</HI> The same au∣thor says, that this call is the word <HI>godard.</HI> According to Frisch, he answers to the name <HI>Frank.</HI></NOTE>, approach the shore, and display his elegance and grace by a thousand soft, sweet, undulating motions <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the endowments bestowed by nature, the Swan joins the possession of liberty. He is none of those slaves which we can constrain or imprison <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">A Swan confined in the court-yard is always melancholy; the gravel hurts his feet; he makes every effort to escape, which he would certainly effect, were not his wings clipt at each moult. <Q>“I have seen one, says M. Baillon, which lived in this condition three years; it was restless and dejected, always lean and silent, insomuch that its voice was never heard; it was plentifully fed however with bread, bran, oats, crabs, and fish; it flew away when its wings were neglected to be clipt.”</Q></NOTE>. Even on our artificial lakes, he retains so much of the spirit of independence as to exclude every idea of servitude and capti∣vity
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tame Swan likes freedom, and will not be confined. <HI>Salerne.</HI></NOTE>. He roves at will on the water, lands on the shore, wanders to a distance, or shelters himself under the brink; lurks among the rushes, or retires to the remotest inlets: then, leaving so∣litude, he returns to society and to the enjoy∣ment which he receives by approaching man; provided we are hospitable and friendly, not harsh and tyrannical.</P>
<P>Among our ancestors, too simple or too wise to fill their gardens with the frigid beauties of art, instead of the lively beauties of nature, the Swans formed the ornament of every piece of water <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This taste was not unknown to the ancients; the tyrant Gelo constructed at Agrigentum a pool for feeding Swans. <HI>Aldro∣vandus.</HI></NOTE>. They cheared the gloomy ditches round castles <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>, they decorated most of the ri∣vers <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">According to Volaterran, there were no less than four thou∣sand on the Thames.</NOTE>, and even that of the capital <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>: and one of our most feeling and amiable princes <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Francis I.</NOTE> took pleasure in stocking the basins of his royal mansions with these beautiful birds. We may at present enjoy the same spectacle on the fine waters of Chantilly, where the Swans are the chief ornament of that truly delicious place, of which every thing bespeaks the noble taste of its owner.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13"/>
The Swan swims so fast, that a man, walking with hasty strides along the banks, can hardly keep pace with it. What Albin says of this bird "that it swims well, walks ill, and flies in|"differently," is true only of the flight of the Swan degraded by domestication; for when free, and especially when wild, it flies very loftily and vigorously. Hesiod gives it the epithet of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> that flies to the clouds.</NOTE>: Homer classes it with the great migratory birds, the cranes and the geese <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Iliad ii.</NOTE>; and Plutarch attributes to two Swans what Pindar sung of two eagles, that Jupiter dispatched them from the opposite extremities of the world, to discover the middle by their meet∣ing.</P>
<P>The Swan, superior in every respect to the goose, which lives only on herbs and grain, pro∣cures itself a rarer and more delicate food <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Swan lives on grain and fish, particularly eels; it swal∣lows also frogs, leeches, and water slugs; it digests as quickly as the duck, and eats largely. <HI>M. Baillon.</HI></NOTE>. It continually practises wiles to ensnare and catch fish: it assumes a thousand different attitudes, and draws every possible advantage from its dexterity and strength. It evades or even resists its enemies: an old Swan fears not in the water the strongest dog: a stroke of its wing could break a man's leg, so violent it is, and so sudden. Nor does the Swan dread any ambush or any
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
foe; for its courage equals its address and its force <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Swan, says the same observer, is perpetually contriving to ensnare fish, which are its favourite food.... It can avoid the blows which its enemies aim at it. If a ravenous bird threatens the young, the parents will defend them intrepidly; they range round them, and the plunderer dares not to approach: if dogs assail them, they go before and make an attack. The Swan dives and escapes if the force of its enemy prove superior to the resistance which it can make. The Swans are seldom ever surprized by foxes and wolves, but in the darkness of night and during sleep.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The wild Swans fly in great flocks, and the tame Swans likewise walk and swim in com∣pany <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>lib.</HI> viii. 12.</NOTE>. Every thing marks their social in∣stinct; and that instinct, the sweetest in nature, bespeaks innocent manners, peaceful habits, and that delicate and sensible disposition which seems to bestow on the actions that flow from it, the merit of moral qualities <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aelian.—Aristotle.—Bartholin.</NOTE>. And the Swan pro∣longs its placid, joyous existence to extreme age <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Aristotle.—Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. All observers ascribe to it prodigious longevity: some represent it as even passing the term of three centuries; which must cer∣tainly be an exaggeration. But Willughby saw a goose, which was proved to have lived an hundred years; and he concludes from analogy that the period of the Swan must extend farther; both because it is larger, and because its eggs require longer time to hatch: for incubation in
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
birds corresponds to gestation in quadrupeds, and bears some relation, perhaps, to the body's growth, which is proportional to the duration of life. The Swan requires two years to attain its full size, which is a very considerable time; since, in birds, the development is much quicker than in quadrupeds.</P>
<P>The female Swan fits six weeks at least <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>; she begins to lay in the month of February; and, as with the goose, there is a day's interval be∣tween the dropping of each egg. She has from five to eight, and commonly six or seven <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Five or six. <HI>Willughby.—</HI>Seven at most. <HI>Schwenckfeld.—</HI>Two or three; sometimes six. <HI>Salerne.</HI></NOTE>; they are white and oblong, covered with a thick shell, and are of a very considerable size. The nest is placed sometimes on a bed of dry herbs on the bank <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>; sometimes on a heap of broken reeds, heaped and even floating on the water <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Frisch.</NOTE>. The amorous pair lavish the sweetest caresses, and seem in their pleasures to seek all the gradations of voluptuousness. They begin by entwining their necks; thus they breathe the intoxication of a long embrace <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tempore libidinis blandientes inter se mas &amp; foemina, alternatim cum suis collis inflectunt, velut amplexandi gratiâ; nec mora, ubi coierint, mas conscius laesam a se foeminam fugit; illa impatiens fugientem inse∣quitur. Nec diutina noxa quin reconcilientur; foemina tandem maris persecutione relictâ, post coitum frequenti caudae motu &amp; rostri, aquis se mergens, purificat.</HI> Johnston.</NOTE>; they communicate the fire
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
which kindles in their veins; and after the male has fully indulged his appetite, the female still burns; she pursues, excites him anew, and then leaves him, with regret, to wash in the water, and quench her remaining ardor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence the opinion of its pretended modesty, which, according to Albertus, is such, that it will not eat after the moments of frui∣tion till it has washed itself. Dr. Bartholin, improving on this idea, asserts, that, to cool its ardour, it eats nettles;—a receipt which would seem as proper for a doctor as for a Swan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fruits of these rapturous loves are ten∣derly cherished and fostered. The mother ga∣thers, night and day, the young under her wings, and the father is ready to defend them with in∣trepidity against every assailant <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Morin's <HI>Dissertation on the song of the Swan—</HI>and Albertus.</NOTE>. But his cou∣rage, on such occasions, bears no comparison to the fury with which he attacks a rival that in∣trudes on the possession of his beloved object <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Charente has its source in two springs, the one called <HI>Cha∣rannat,</HI> and the other, the wonderful abyss, <HI>Louvre;</HI> which, joining their streams, give existence and name to the Charente: these afford a retreat to an innumerable multitude of Swans, the most amiable, the most beautiful, the most familiar of all the river birds: it is true, they are choleric and desperate when provoked, which has been wit∣nessed in a house adjoining to the said Louvre. Two Swans having attacked each other so furiously as almost to kill each other, four others of their companions hastened to the spot, and, as if they had been human beings, endeavoured to separate them, and to conciliate them into concord and mutual friendship; indeed, this deserved more the name of prodigy than any other appellation. But if one treat them with gentleness, and coax and praise them a little, they will shew themselves mild and peaceful, and take pleasure in seeing the face of man. <HI>Cosmographie du Levant, par André Thevet; Lyons,</HI> 1554, <HI>pp.</HI> 189 and 190.</NOTE>. He then forgets his mildness, becomes ferocious,
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
and fights with obstinate rancour; and a whole day is often insufficient to terminate the quarrel. They begin with striking violently their wings, then join close, and persist till commonly one of them is killed; for they strive to stifle each other by locking the neck, and forcibly holding the head under water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We certisy all these facts as eye-witnesses. <HI>M. Morin.</HI></NOTE>. It was probably these com∣bats that made the ancients imagine that the Swans devoured one another <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>lib.</HI> ix. 1.—Aelian was still worse informed, when he said the Swan sometimes kills its young. These false ideas rested less perhaps on facts in natural history, than on mythological tradi∣tions. Indeed, all the <HI>Cycnuses</HI> in fable were exceeding wicked personages:<HI>—Cycnus,</HI> the son of Mars, was killed by Hercules, be∣cause he was a robber: <HI>Cycnus,</HI> the son of Neptune, having stabbed Philonome his mother, was killed by Achilles; and lastly, the beau∣tiful <HI>Cycnus,</HI> friend of Phaeton and son of Apollo, was, like him, cruel and inhuman.</NOTE>, Nothing is wider of the truth; only in this, as in other cases, fu∣rious passions originate from a passion the most delicious; and it is love that begets war <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Frisch asserts that the older Swans are the most vicious, and harrass the younger; and that, to secure tranquillity in the hatches, the number of these old males should be diminished.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At every other time, their habits are peaceful, and all their sentiments are dictated by love. As attentive to neatness as they are addicted to plea∣sure, they are assiduous each day in the care of their person: they arrange their plumage, they clean and smooth it; they take water in their bill, and sprinkle in on their back and wings with an attention that implies the desire of pleasing,
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
and which can only be repaid by the conscious∣ness of being loved. The only time when the female neglects her attire, is that of incubation: her maternal solicitude then entirely occupies her thoughts, and hardly does she spare a few moments for the relief and support of na∣ture.</P>
<P>The cygnets are hatched very ugly, and co∣vered only with a gray or yellowish down, like goslings. Their feathers do not sprout till a few weeks after, and are still of the same colour. This unsightly plumage changes after the first moult, in the month of September: then they assume many white feathers, and others rather flaxen than gray, especially on the breast and the back. This laced plumage drops at the second moult, and it is not till eighteen months, or even two years, that these birds are invested with their robe of pure and spotless white; nor before that age can they have young.</P>
<P>The cygnets follow their mother the first summer, but they are compelled to leave her in the month of November, being chased away by the adult males, who wish to enjoy entirely the company of the females. These young birds, exiled from their family, unite in one body, and never separate till they pair.</P>

The natives set great value on the feathers of Swans; they form them into dia∣dems for their chiefs, and into caps, and twist the little feathers, as the wig-makers do hair, into cloaks for their women of rank.

species <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby and Ray.</NOTE>. The wild Swan is smaller; its plu∣mage is more inclined to gray than white <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>N.

But the intensity of colour, and even the caruncle or wattle on the front, are to be re∣garded as less the characters of nature, than the tokens and impressions of domestication. The Swans are subject to variations in the colours of their plumage and of their bill, as well as other tame birds; and Dr. Plott <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">British Zoology.<HI>—N. B.</HI> We may also mention the Swan which Redi saw in the parks of the Grand Duke, which had the feathers of the head and neck tipt with a yellow or orange tinge; a peculiarity which may explain the epithet <HI>purpurei,</HI> applied by Ho∣race to the Swans. (The expression is "purpureis ales oloribus." <HI>Carm. lib.</HI> iv. <HI>Od.</HI> 1. But it is to be observed, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, among the Greeks, and <HI>purpureus</HI> among the Latins, signified originally any pure virgin colour, and was afterwards appropriated to purple. <Q>Thus Virgil has “purpureo narcisso, purpureo capillo, purpureum ver, purpureum lumen, purpureum mare.”</Q><HI>—T.</HI></NOTE> mentions a tame Swan, whose bill was red. Besides, the differ∣ence in the colour of the plumage is not so great as would at first appear; we have seen tame Swans hatched gray, and continue long of that cast. This colour subsists still longer in the wild ones, and yet they grow white through age: for Edwards observed, that, in the hard winter of 1740, many wild Swans were seen in the neigh∣bourhood
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
of London, entirely white. The tame Swan must therefore be regarded as a breed de∣rived anciently and originally from the wild spe∣cies. Klein, Frisch, and Linnaeus have formed the same opinion; though Willughby and Ray pretend the contrary.</P>
<P>Belon reckons the Swan to be the largest of the aquatic birds; which is true, excepting, however, that the pelican has a much greater alar extent, that the albatross is as bulky, and that the flamingo is taller on its legs. The tame Swans are invariably somewhat thicker and larger than the wild sort: some of them weigh twenty-five pounds, and measure, from the bill to the tail, four feet and a half; the breadth of the wings eight feet. The female is, in every dimension, rather smaller than the male.</P>
<P>The bill usually exceeds two inches in length, and, in the tame kind, has above its base a fleshy tubercle, inflated and prominent, which gives a sort of expression: this tubercle is covered with a black skin; and the sides of the face, under the eyes, are covered with a skin of the same colour. In cygnets of the domestic breed, the bill is of a leaden cast, and afterwards becomes yellow or white, with the point black. In the wild kind, the bill is entirely black, with a yellow mem∣brane on the front: its form seems to be copied in the two most numerous families of the pal∣mipede birds, the geese and ducks. In all of these the bill is flat, thick, indented at the edges,
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
rounded into a blunt tip <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tenet os sine acumine rostrum.</HI> Ovid.</NOTE>, and terminated on the upper mandible by a nail of horny substance.</P>
<P>In all the species of this numerous tribe, there is, under the outer feathers, a thick down, which prevents the water from penetrating to the body. In the Swan this down is exceedingly fine and soft, and perfectly white: it is worked into muffs and furs, that are equally delicate and warm.</P>
<P>The flesh of the Swan is black and hard; and the magnificence, rather than the excellence of the dish, might recommend it in the Roman entertainments <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Athenaeus.—The Romans fattened it as they did the goose, having put out its eyes, or shut it up in a dark prison.

<P>Though the Swan is a silent bird, its vocal organs have the same structure as in the most loquacious of the water fowl. The <HI>trachea ar∣teria</HI> descends into the <HI>sternum,</HI> makes a bend <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">According to Willughby, this conformation is peculiar to the wild Swan, and is not the same in the tame Swan; which seems to give occasion to the difference which we shall remark between their cries.

Swans, almost mute, like ours in the domestic state, could not be those melodious birds which they have celebrated and extolled. But the wild Swan appears to have better preserved its prero∣gatives; and with the sentiment of entire liberty, it has also the tones. The bursts of its voice form a sort of modulated song <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Abbe Arnaud, whose genius is formed to revive the pre∣cious remains of elegant and learned antiquity, has obligingly con∣curred with us in verifying and appreciating what the ancients have said on the song of the Swan. Two wild Swans which have settled on the magnificent pools of Chantilly, seem to have offered them∣selves for this interesting observation. The Abbe Arnaud has gone so far as to mark their song, or rather their harmonious cries; and he writes us in the following terms: <Q>“One can hardly say that the Swans of Chantilly sing, they cry; but their cries are truly and con∣stantly modulated; their voice is not sweet; on the contrary, it is shrill, piercing, and rather disagreeable; I could compare it to no∣thing better than the sound of a clarionet, winded by a person un∣acquainted with the instrument. Almost all the melodious birds answer to the song of man, and especially to the sound of instru∣ments: I played long on the violin beside our Swans, on all the tones and chords; I even struck unison to their own accents, without their seeming to pay the smallest attention: but if a goose be thrown into the bason where they swim with their young, the male, after emitting some hollow sounds, rushes impetuously upon the goose, and, seizing it by the neck, he plunges the head repeat∣edly under water, striking it at the same time with his wings; it would be all over with the goose, if it were not rescued: the Swan, with his wings expanded, his neck stretched, and his head erect, comes to place himself opposite to his female, and ut∣ters a cry, to which the female replies by another, which is lower by half a tone. The voice of the male passes from A <HI>(la)</HI> to B flat <HI>(si bemol);</HI> that of the female, from G sharp <HI>(sol dièse)</HI> to A. The first note is short and transient, and has the effect of that which our musicians call <HI>sensible;</HI> so that it is not detached from the second, but seems to <HI>slip</HI> into it. Observe that, fortunately for the ear, they do not both sing at once; in fact, if while the male sounded B flat, the female struck A, or if the male uttered A, while the fe∣male gave G sharp, there would result the harshest and most in∣supportable of discords. We may add, that this dialogue is sub∣jected to a constant and regular rhythm, with the measure of two times. The inspector assured me that, during their amours, these birds have a cry still sharper, but much more agreeable.”</Q>—We shall add an interesting observation which was communicated to us after the first pages of this article were printed. <Q>“There is a sea∣son when the Swans assemble together, and form a sort of common∣wealth; it is during severe colds. When the frost threatens to usurp their domain, they congregate and dash the water with all the extent of their wings, making a noise which is heard very far, and which, whether in the day or the night, is louder in propor∣tion as it freezes more intensely. Their efforts are so effectual, that there are few instances of a flock of Swans having quitted the water in the longest frosts, though a single Swan, which has strayed from the general body, has sometimes been arrested by the ice in the middle of the canals.”</Q> <HI>Extract of a note drawn up by M. Grouvelle, military secretary to his serene highness the prince of Conde.</HI></NOTE>; yet the shrill
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
and scarce diversified notes of its loud, clarion sounds, differ widely from the tender melody, the sweet and brilliant variety of our chanting birds.</P>
<P>But it was not enough that the Swan sung admirably; the ancients ascribed to it a prophetic spirit. It alone, of animated beings, which all shudder at the prospect of destruction, chanted in the moment of its agony, and, with harmoni∣ous sounds, prepared to breathe the last sigh. When about to expire, they said, and to bid a sad and tender adieu to life, the Swan poured forth those accents so sweet, so affecting, and which, like a gentle and doleful murmur, with
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
a voice low <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Parvus cycni canor.</HI> Lucret. <HI>lib.</HI> iv.</NOTE>, plaintive, and melancholy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Olorum morte narratur flebilis cantus.</HI> Plin.</NOTE>, formed its funereal song <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">According to Pythagoras, it was the song of exultation upon the immediate prospect of passing into a happier state.</NOTE>.

And well may we excuse such fables; they were amiable and affecting; they were worth many dull, insipid truths; they were sweet emblems to feeling minds. The Swan, doubtless, chants not its approaching end; but, in speaking of the last flight, the expiring effort of a fine genius, we shall ever, with tender me∣lancholy, recal the classical and pathetic expres∣sion, <HI>It is the song of the Swan!</HI></P>

<P>IN every genus, the primary species have borne off all the eulogies, and have left to the sub∣ordinate species only the scorn arising from the comparison. The Goose is in the same predi∣cament with regard to the swan, as the ass when viewed beside the horse; neither of them is esti∣mated
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
at its true value. The first step of infe∣riority, appearing a real degradation, and re∣calling, at the same time, the idea of a more perfect model, exhibits, instead of the absolute qualities of the secondary species, only an unfa∣vourable contrast with the primary. Laying aside, then, for a moment, the too noble image of the swan, we shall find, that, among the in∣habitants of our court-yards, the Goose holds a distinguished rank. Its corpulence, its erect car∣riage, its grave demeanour, its clean glossy plu∣mage, and its social disposition, which renders it susceptible of a strong attachment and a durable gratitude; finally, its vigilance, celebrated in high antiquity: all concur to recommend the Goose as one of the most engaging, and even of the most useful, of our domestic birds. For, besides the excellence of its flesh and of its fat, with which no bird is more abundantly provided, the Goose furnishes the delicate down for the beds of the luxurious, and the quill, the instru∣ment of our thoughts, which now writes its eulogy.</P>
<P>The Goose may be maintained at no great expence, and reared with moderate attention <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>. It is reconciled to the ordinary life of poultry, and suffers itself to be inclosed with them in the same court <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; though that mode of existence,
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
and especially that constraint, is little suited to its nature: for to raise numerous flocks of large Geese, it is requisite that they be kept near pools or streams, surrounded with spacious margins, with grassy patches or waste grounds, where they may feed and sport at liberty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anser nec sine herbâ, nec sine aquâ facile sustinetur.</HI> Pallad.</NOTE>. They are not permitted to enter meadows, because their dung burns up the good herbage, and because they dig into the soil with their bill. For the same rea∣son, they are carefully removed from green corn, and are not permitted to range the fields till after harvest.</P>
<P>Though the Geese can feed on grass and most herbs, they prefer trefoil, fenugreek, vetches, succory, and especially lettuce, which is the greatest regale of the little goslings <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lactuca mollissimum olus libentissime ab illis appetitur &amp; pullis uti∣lissima esca. Ceterum vicia, trifolium, foenum graecum, &amp; agrestis in∣tiba illis conseratur.</HI> Columella.</NOTE>. We should carefully extirpate from their walk, hen∣bane, hemlock, and nettles <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>, whose stings are very pernicious to the young birds. Pliny as∣serts, perhaps on slight foundation, that the Geese eat iron-wort for a purge.</P>
<P>The domestication of the Goose is neither so ancient nor so complete as that of the hen. The latter lays at all seasons, more in summer, less in winter; but the former are unproductive in the winter, and seldom have eggs before the month
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
of March. Yet such as are well fed begin to lay in February, and those which are more spar∣ingly kept, often defer till April. The white, the gray, the yellow, and the black sorts, follow that rule; only the white ones seem to be more delicate, and are really more difficult to rear. None of them ever makes its nest in our court-yards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They sink into straw, there to lay, and the better to conceal the eggs; they have preserved this habit of the wild Geese, which pro∣bably penetrate into the thickest rushes and marsh-plants, to hatch; and in places where the tame ones enjoy almost entire freedom, they gather some materials on which they deposit their eggs. <Q>“In the island of St. Domingo," says M. Baillon, "where many of the inhabitants have tame Geese like ours, they lay in the savan∣nas, near the brooks and trenches; they form the bed with some dry herbs, the stalks of maize or of millet: the females are less prolific there than in France, their greatest laying not exceeding seven or eight eggs.”</Q></NOTE>; they lay only every two days, but al∣ways in the same place. If their eggs be re∣moved, they make a second and a third deposit, and even a fourth in warm countries <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. It is, no doubt, by reason of these successive layings, that Salerne says they continue till June. But if the eggs be constantly withdrawn, the Goose will still persist to lay, till at last she wastes away and dies. For the eggs, particularly those of the first laying, amount to a large number; at least seven, and commonly ten, twelve, or fif∣teen, and even sixteen, according to Pliny <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.</HI> v. 55.</NOTE>. Such may be the case in Italy; but in the inte∣rior
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
provinces of France, as in Burgundy and Champagne, the greatest nests contain but twelve eggs. Aristotle observes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.</HI> vi. 12.</NOTE>, that often young Geese, like pullets, lay addle eggs before having intercourse with the male. This fact is appli∣cable to all birds.</P>
<P>But if the domestication of the Goose is more modern than that of the hen, it seems to have been more ancient than that of the duck, whose original features are less changed, so that the interval is greater between the wild and the tame Goose, than between those two breeds of ducks. The tame Goose is larger than the wild, the parts of its body are more extended and more pliant, its wings are neither so strong nor so stiff, the whole colour of its plumage is changed, and it retains scarce any trace of its primitive condition; it seems to have even for∣gotten the sweets of its ancient freedom, at least it seeks not, like the duck, to recover them. Servitude appears to have enfeebled it; it no longer has strength to accompany or follow the flight of its savage brethren, who, proud of their force, neglect and even despise it <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>"I have enquired," says M. Baillon, “of many fowlers who kill wild Geese every year, but I could never meet with one who had seen the tame birds among the wild, or who had killed hy∣brids.

That a flock of tame Geese prosper and in∣crease by a quick multiplication, it is requisite, says Columella <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Re Rust.</HI> lib. viii. 13.</NOTE>, that the number of the fe∣males be triple that of the males. Aldrovandus allows six geese to one gander; and it is usual in our provinces to admit twelve, and even twenty. These birds prepare for the congress of love by first sporting in the water. They come out to copulate, and continue longer united and in closer embrace than most others; for the act is not a simple compression, but a real intromission, the male being provided with the proper organ <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Animal. lib.</HI> iii.</NOTE>; and hence the ancients con∣secrated the Goose to Priapus.</P>
<P>The male shares with the female only the pleasures of love; he devolves on her the whole care of incubation <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>. She covers constantly and assiduously, and would even neglect to eat and drink, were not food placed near the nest <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. Economists advise, however, to entrust the in∣cubation and rearing of the goslings to a hen; so that the Goose may have a second and even a third hatch. The last one is left to the proper mother; and she can hatch ten or twelve eggs, whereas a hen cannot succeed with more than five. It would be curious to know whether, as
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
Columella asserts, the Goose, wiser than the hen, will cover no eggs but her own.</P>
<P>Thirty days are required for incubation, as in most of the large birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>Hist. Animal. lib.</HI> vi. 6.</NOTE>; unless, as Pliny re∣marks, the weather be very hot, and then it succeeds in twenty-five days <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.</HI> x. 59.</NOTE>. During the sitting, a vessel filled with grain, and another with water, are placed at some distance from the eggs, which the Goose never quits but to take a little food. It has been remarked, that she seldom ever lays on two consecutive days, and that there is always an interval of at least twenty-four hours, and sometimes of two or three days, between the exclusion of each egg.</P>
<P>The callow goslings are fed first with the re∣fuse of the mill, or with rich bran kneaded with hashed succory or lettuce. This is the receipt of Columella, who recommends besides to fill the young ones bellies before they are suffered to follow their mother to the pasture-ground; for otherwise, if they are tormented with hun∣ger, they will set obstinately on the stalks of herbs and little roots, and in straining to tear them up, will dislocate or break their neck <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Saturetur pullus antequam ducatur in pascuum; si enim fame premitur, cum pervenerit in pascuum, fruticibus aut solidioribus herbis obluctatur ita pertinaciter, ut collum abrumpat.</HI> Columella.</NOTE>. Our common practice in Burgundy is to feed the newly hatched goslings with hashed chervil;
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
eight days after we add a little bran, slightly moistened: and care is taken to separate the parents when the provisions are served, for they would scarcely, it is said, leave any thing to their brood. They afterwards have oats given them; and as soon as they can easily fol∣low their mother, they are conducted to the green-sward near the water.</P>
<P>Monstrous births are perhaps more common in Geese than in other domestic birds. Aldro∣vandus has caused to be engraved two of these monsters; the one has two bodies joined to a single head, the other has two heads and four legs proceeding from the same body. The excessive corpulence to which the Goose is naturally in∣clined, and which we seek to promote, must produce in its constitution alterations sufficient to affect its generative powers. In general, very fat animals are little prolific; for the over proportion of adipose substance changes the quality of the seminal fluid, and even that of the blood. When the head of an extremely fat Goose is cut off, nothing but a white liquor flows, and, upon opening it, not a drop of red blood can be seen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collect. Academ. <HI>part. etrang. tom.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 146.</NOTE>. In such cases the liver, from the obstruction occasioned by the grossness, swells to a prodigious size; nay, in a fatted Goose, the liver is often more bulky than all the other bowels together <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aspice quam tumeat magno jecur ansere majus.</HI> Martial.</NOTE>. These fat livers, on which
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
our gluttons set so high value, agreed also with the taste of the Roman Apiciuses. Pliny deems it an important question, to know what citizen invented that dish <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nostri sapientiores anseris jecoris bonitatem novere; fartilibus in magnam amplitudinem crescit, exemptum quoque lacte augetur; nec sine causâ in quaestione est qui primus, tantum bonum invenerit, Scipio Me∣tellus vir consularis an M.

They fed the Goose with figs, to make the flesh more exquisite <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pinguibus aut ficis pastum jecur anseris albi.</HI> Horace.</NOTE>; and they had discovered that it fattens much quicker in a narrow, dark place <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Columella.</NOTE>.

See Aldrovandus, <HI>lib.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 133.</NOTE>. Usually and more humanely we are contented with shutting them up for a month; and a bushel of oats is sufficient to make a Goose very fat. It is easy to know, by a very manifest external sign, when we should discontinue the feeding, and when the bird has received its due fat; for under each wing there is then a very dis∣tinct pellet of fat. It has been remarked, that the Geese bred near the margin of water are less expensive to maintain, lay earlier, and fatten more easily, than others.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="41"/>
Goose-fat was much esteemed by the an∣cients for topical applications, and as a cosmetic. They recommended it for rendering firm wo∣men's breasts after delivery, and for preserving the skin fresh and sleek. That prepared at Comagene, with a mixture of aromatics, was boasted as a medicine. Aldrovandus gives a list of recipes, where this fat enters as a specific in all diseases of the <HI>matrix;</HI> and Willughby asserts that goose-dung is the most certain remedy for the jaundice. The flesh itself is not very salubrious; it is heavy, and difficult to digest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galen.</NOTE>: yet was the Goose the chief dish at the suppers of our ancestors; and not till after the introduction of the turkey from America, did the Goose, in our court-yards and in our kitchens, hold only the second place <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Salerne and Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The most valuable article furnished by the Goose, is its down: this is plucked more than once a-year. As soon as the goslings are grown stout and well feathered, and the quills of the wing begin to cross on the tail, which happens at the age of seven weeks or two months, they are stript under the belly, under the wings, and on the neck. Their first fea∣thers are therefore plucked in the end of May, or the beginning of June: and five or six weeks after, that is, in the course of July, there is a
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
second plucking; and again a third in the be∣ginning of September. During all that time, they are lean, their nourishment being diverted to the growth of the new feathers. But if they be left to recover their plumage early in autumn, or even at the close of summer, they will soon gain flesh, and afterwards grow fat, and against the middle of winter they will be very good for eating. The breeders are not plucked till a month or five weeks after incubation; but the ganders and geese which do not hatch may be stript twice or thrice annually. In cold countries, the down is richer and finer. The estimation in which the Romans held that brought from Germany, was more than once the cause of the soldiers neglecting their posts in that country; for whole cohorts dispersed in pursuit of Geese <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plumae e Germaniâ laudatissimae ... pretium plumae in libràs denarii quini ... &amp; inde crimina plerumque auxiliorum praefectis, a vigili statione ad haec aucupia dimissis cohortibus totis.</HI> Plin. <HI>lib.</HI> x. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that of tame Geese the great quills of the wings drop almost in a cluster in one night. They seem then bashful and timorous: they fly from a person's approach. Forty days are required for the protrusion of the new feathers; and at this time they continually essay their vigour and flap their wings.</P>

Anisson Duperon, and the scene of this faithful and unshaken friendship. <Q>“Emmanuel was asked how the white gander called <HI>Jacquot</HI> was tamed with him. It is proper to observe that there were two ganders, a gray and a white, with three females: these two males were perpetually contending for the company of these three dames; when one or the other prevailed, he assumed the direction of them, and hindered the other from approaching. He who was master during the night, would not yield in the morning; and the two gallants fought so furiously, that it was necessary to run and part them. It happened one day, that, being drawn tothe bottom of the gar∣den by their cries, I found them with their necks entwined, strik∣ing their wings with rapidity and astonishing force; the three fe∣males turned round, as wishing to separate them, but without effect; at last the white gander was worsted, overthrown, and mal∣treated by the other: I parted them, happily for the white one, which would have lost his life. Then the gray gander set a screaming and gabbling and clapping his wings, and ran to join his mistresses, giving each a noisy salute, to which the three dames replied, ranging themselves at the same time round him. Mean∣while poor <HI>Jacquot</HI> was in a pitiable case, and retiring, sadly he vented at a distance his doleful cries: it was several days before he recovered from his dejection, during which time I had occa∣sion to pass through the court where he stayed; I saw him always thrust out from society, and each time I passed he came gabbling to me, no doubt to thank me for the succour which I had given him on his defeat. One day he approached so near me, showing so much friendship, that I could not help caressing him by strok∣ing with my hand his back and neck, to which he seemed so sen∣sible as to follow me into the entrance of the court. Next day as I again passed, he ran to me, and I gave him the same caresses, with which he could not be surfeited; but he seemed by his ges∣tures to desire that I should lead him to his dear mates; I accord∣ingly did lead him to their quarter, and upon his arrival he be∣gan his vociferations, and directly addressed the three dames, who failed not to answer him. Immediately the gray victor sprung upon <HI>Jacquot,</HI> I left them for a moment; he was always the stronger; I took part with my <HI>Jacquot,</HI> who was under; I set him over his rival, he was thrown under; I set him up again: in this way they fought eleven minutes, and by the assistance which I gave, he obtained the advantage over the gray gander, and got possession of the three dames. When my friend <HI>Jacquot</HI> saw him∣self master, he would not venture to leave his females, and there∣fore no longer came to me when I passed; he only gave me at a distance many tokens of friendship, shouting and clapping his wings, but would not quit his prey, for fear that another should take possession. Things went on in this way till the breeding season, and he never gabbled to me but at a distance: when his females however began to sit, he left them and redoubled his friendship to me. One day having followed me as far as the ice∣house at the top of the park, the place where I must necessarily part with him in pursuing my way to the Wood of Orangis, at half a league's distance, I shut him in the park: he no sooner saw himself separated from me than he vented strange cries. How∣ever I went on my road, and I was about a third advanced, when the noise of a heavy flight made me turn round my head; I saw my <HI>Jacquot</HI> four paces from me: he followed me all the road, partly on foot, partly on wing, getting before me and stopping at the cross paths, to see what way I should take. Our expedi∣tion lasted from ten o'clock in the morning till eight in the even∣ing, and yet my companion followed me through all the wind∣ings of the wood, without seeming to be tired. After this he fol∣lowed and attended me every where, so as to become trouble∣some, I not being able to go to any place without his tracing my steps, so that one day he came to find me in the church: another time, as he was passing by the rector's window, he heard me talk∣ing in the room; and as he found the door open, he entered, climbed up the stairs, and marching in, he gave a loud burst of” joy, to the no small affright of the rector.</Q></P> <P><Q>“I am sorry, in relating such pleasing traits of my good and faithful friend <HI>Jacquot,</HI> when I think that it was myself that first dissolved the sweet friendship: but it was necessary that I should separate him by force; poor <HI>Jacquot</HI> fancied himself as free in the best apartments as in his own, and after several accidents of that kind, he was shut up, and I saw him no more. His inquietude lasted above a year, and he died from vexation; he was become as dry as a bit of wood, as I am told; for I would not see him, and his death was concealed from me more than two months after the event. Were I to recount all the friendly incidents between me and poor <HI>Jacquot,</HI> I should not, in four days, have done writ∣ing: he died in the third year of the reign of friendship, aged seven years and two months.”</Q></P></NOTE>, The fact was communicated to me by
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
a man of veracity and information, to whom I am partly indebted for the care and attention
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
which I have experienced at the royal press in printing my works. We have also received from St. Domingo an account pretty similar, and which shows that, in certain circumstances, the Goose appears capable of a very lively and strong personal attachment, and even of a sort of pas∣sionate friendship, which wastes and destroys it, when removed from the object of its affection.</P>
<P>As early as the time of Columella, the do∣mestic Geese were distinguished into two kinds; that with the white, and that with the variegated
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
plumage, the former more anciently do∣mesticated than the latter. The freckled Geese, according to Varro, were not so prolific as the white ones <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Re Rusticâ, <HI>lib.</HI> viii. 13.</NOTE>, which the farmer was advised by them to keep, as being also the largest <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. Belon agrees entirely with the ancient writers on rural oeconomy: but Gesner, who was almost his contemporary, asserts, that in Germany the gray sort are, for good reasons, preferred, being har∣dier and not less prolific; and Aldrovandus con∣firms the remark for Italy. It would seem as if the most ancient breed were emasculated by long domestication; and indeed the gray or variegated Geese are now inferior neither in size, nor in fecundity, to the white ones.</P>
<P>Aristotle, speaking of two breeds or species of Geese, a greater and a lesser, which are grega∣rious, seems by the latter to mean the wild Goose <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.</HI> viii. 15.</NOTE>. And Pliny treats particularly of this under its name <HI>Anser ferus.</HI> In fact, the Geese form two great tribes; of which the one, long since domesticated, is attached to our dwellings, and multiplies and varies in our hands; the other, much more numerous, has escaped from us, and remains wild and savage: for the whole difference results from the slavery of man on the one hand, and from the liberty of nature on the
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>. The wild Goose is lean, and slenderer than the tame one: and the same may be ob∣served of several breeds, according as they ap∣proach the primitive stem, as between the com∣mon and the stock pigeons. The wild Goose has also its back brownish-gray, its belly whit∣ish, and all its body clouded with rusty-white, and the tip of each feather fringed with the same. In the domestic Goose, this rusty colour has varied, has assumed shades of brown or of white, has even disappeared entirely in the white sort <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>. Some have a tuft on the head. But these changes are inconsiderable, if compared with those which the hen, the pigeon, and many other species, have undergone in the do∣mestic state. The Goose and the other water fowls which we have tamed, are much less re∣moved from the wild state, and much less sub∣dued or enslaved, than the gallinaceous, which seem to be the native citizens of our court-yard. In countries where multitudes of Geese are raised, the whole attention needed, during the summer months, consists in calling them and conducting them to the farm, where they have convenient and undisturbed retreats for nestling and educat∣ing their young; and these advantages, together with the asylum and food afforded them in winter, attach them to the abode, and restrain them from deserting. The rest of their time is
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
spent beside the brooks and pools, where they play and rest on the banks. In a mode of life so nearly approaching to the liberty of nature, they resume almost all its advantages, strength of constitution, thickness and elegance of plu∣mage, vigour and extent of flight <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scaliger.</NOTE>. In some regions even, where man, less civilized, that is less tyrannical, allows the animals still to enjoy freedom, there are Geese really wild the whole summer, which become domestic in the winter. We have learnt this fact from Dr. Sanchez, and we shall here give the in∣teresting account which he communicated.</P>
<P><Q>"I set out from Azof," says that learned physician, “in autumn 1736. Being sick, and afraid of falling into the hands of the Cu∣ban Tartars, I resolved to walk, following the course of the Don, and to sleep every night in the villages of the Cossacs, who are subject to the Russian dominion. In the first evenings of my journey, I remarked a great number of Geese in the air, which alighted and dispersed through the hamlets. The third day especially, I saw such a mul∣titude at sun-set, that I enquired of the Cossacs, among whom I lodged that night, whether they were tame Geese; and if they came from a distance, as their lofty flight seemed to indicate. Surprized at my igno∣rance,
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
they replied that these birds came from the remote northern lakes; and that every year, on the breaking up of the ice, in the months of March and April, six or seven pairs of Geese leave each hut of the village, which all take flight in a body, and return not till the beginning of winter, as it is reckoned in Russia, that is, at the first snow; that these flocks arrive then, increased sometimes an hundred-fold, and dividing themselves, each little party seeks, with its new progeny, the houses where they lived the preceding winter. I had constantly that spectacle every evening, for three weeks: the air was filled with infinite multitudes of Geese, which dispersed in bands: the girls and women, at the doors of their huts, look∣ing at the flight, were calling out, 'There go my Geese,' 'There go the Geese of such a one:' and each of the bands alighted in the court where they had spent the preceding winter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants make a slaughter among these Geese while their feathers are in down; they cut them in two and dry them; the down, famous for its goodness, is the subject of a great trade; the dry flesh is carried to the Ukraine, where the Cossacs barter it for spirituous liquors and some clothes. <HI>Extract from the same nar∣ration of Dr. Sanchez.</HI></NOTE>. I continued to see these birds till I reached Nova-Pauluska, where the winter was already intense.”</Q></P>
<P>It is probably from some such relations that the wild Geese which visit us in winter are
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
supposed to be domestic in other countries. But this notion is, as we learn from Belon, devoid of foundation; for the wild Geese are of all birds, perhaps, the most completely savage; and be∣sides, winter, the season of their arrival, is the very time they should be tame.</P>
<P>In France, the wild Geese pass in October or the first days of November <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is in the month of November, M. Hebert writes me, that the first wild Geese are seen in Brie, and they continue to pass in that province till the hard frosts set in, so that their passage lasts nearly two months. The troops of these Geese are from ten or twelve to twenty or thirty, and never more than fifty: they alight in the plains sown with corn, and do so much injury that attentive husbandmen set children to watch their fields, and to frighten away the Geese by their shouts. It is in wet weather that they occasion the most havoc, because they tear up the wheat as they pasture on it; whereas in frost they only crop it, and leave the rest of the plant rooted in the soil.</NOTE>. Winter, which then begins its reign in the north, determines their migration: and, what is remarkable, the domestic Geese, at this same time, shew by their inquietude, their frequent and long flights, a si∣milar desire to journey <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">My neighbour at Mirande keeps a flock of Geese, which he every year reduces to fifteen, by selling a part of the old ones, and preserving a part of the young. This is the third year that I have remarked that during the month of October these birds betray a sort of restlessness, which I look upon as the remnant of their dispo∣sition to migrate. Every day, about four o'clock in the afternoon, these Geese take wing, pass over my gardens, and make a circuit round the plain in their flight, and return not to their roost till night: they call each other by a cry, which I distinctly recognized to be that which the wild Geese repeat in their passage, to collect and unite their numbers. The month of October has been so mild this year, that the grass has shot up in the pasture-grounds; indepen∣dently of this abundance of food, the proprietor of this flock gives them grain every evening this season, lest he should lose a few of them. Last year one strayed away, and was more than two months after found at three leagues distance. After the end of October, or the first days of November, these Geese resume their tranquillity.—I conclude from this observation, that the most ancient domesti∣cation (since that of the Geese in this country, where there are no wild ones, must have taken place in remotest antiquity) never en∣tirely effaces this character imprinted by nature, this innate desire to migrate. The tame Goose, degraded and incumbered, attempts a passage, exercises itself every day; and, though abundantly pro∣vided and wanting for nothing, I could warrant, that if wild ones passed at this season, they would always lead off some, and that no∣thing but example and a little courage are needed to make them desert: I doubt not, that if the same observations were made in the provinces where many Geese are fed, we should find that some are lost every year, and this in the month of October. I know not, however, if all the Geese reared in court-yards shew these marks of inquietude; but it must be considered that these are almost con∣fined within walls, and never pasture or enjoy the view of the hori∣zon; they are slaves which have lost every idea of their ancient liberty. <HI>Observation communicated by M. Hebert.</HI></NOTE>, the evident remains of original instinct.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="53"/>
The flight of the wild Geese is always very elevated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“It is only in foggy weather that the wild Geese fly so near the ground that they can be shot.”</Q> <HI>Idem.</HI></P></NOTE>; their motion is smooth, accompanied with no noise or rustling, and the play of the wings, in striking the air, seems never to exceed one or two inches. The regularity and conduct with which they are marshalled, implies a sort of intelligence superior to that of other birds, which migrate in confused and disorderly flocks. The arrangement observed by the Geese seems dictated by a geometrical instinct: it is at once calculated to preserve the ranks free and entire,
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
to break the resistance of the air, and to lessen the exertion and fatigue of the squadron. They form two oblique lines, like the letter V; or, if their number be small, they form only one line: generally they amount to forty or fifty, and each keeps its rank with admirable exactness.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rzaczynski.</NOTE>. Several of these small bodies, or secon∣dary flocks, unite again, and form larger squa∣drons, amounting to four or five hundred; which we sometimes see alight in our fields, where they are very destructive <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus mentions Holland in particular as suffering by the visits of wild Geese.</NOTE>, pasturing on the green corn, which they scrape from under the snow. Fortunately, the Geese are very un∣steady and roving, remain a short while in one place, and seldom return to the same district. They spend the whole day on the ground, among the cultivated fields or meadows; but retire every evening to the rivers or large pools. There they pass the whole night, but arrive not till sun-set, and some after twilight: each party is received by loud acclamations, to which it replies; so that, at eight or nine o'clock, and the darkest nights, they make such noisy and multiplied clamours, that we should suppose them to be as∣sembled by thousands.</P>
<P>The wild Geese might, at this season, be said to be birds of the plain rather than birds of the water; since they never resort to the streams and pools but at night. Their habits are the reverse of those of the ducks, which leave the water at that time, and disperse to feed in the meadows, and do not return before the Geese repair to their diurnal haunts. On their arrival
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
in the spring, the wild Geese scarce stop with us, and very few are then seen in the air: it is pro∣bable that they depart and return by different routes.</P>
<P>As the wild Geese so frequently shift their place, and as they have an acute ear, and are mistrustful and circumspect, they are difficult to catch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>"It is almost impossible," says M. Hebert, “to shoot them on their arrival, because they fly too high, and begin not to de∣scend till they are over water. I have tried," he adds, with little success, to surprize them at day-break; I passed the night in the fields; the boat was got ready in the evening, we stepped into it long before day, and we advanced; concealed by the dusk, a great way upon the water, and as far as the last of the reeds: however, we were too far from the flock to fire upon them; and these shy birds rose all of them, and to such a height, that in passing over our heads they were beyond the reach of our shot. All these Geese thus assembled had set off together, and were waiting full day, had they not been disturbed; then they separated and dispersed in divisions, and perhaps in the same or∣der in which they had collected in the preceding evening.”</Q></P></NOTE>, and elude most kinds of snares. That which Aldrovandus describes, is perhaps the surest and the best contrived. <Q>“When the fields," says he, "are kept dry by the frost, a proper place is chosen for spreading a long net, fastened and stretched with cords, so so that it may quickly drop: it is nearly like a lark's net, but extends over a longer space, which must be covered with dust. A few tame Geese are set beside it, to serve as calls. It is requisite that all these preparations be made in the evening, and that the net be not afterwards touched; for if in the morning the
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
Geese perceive the dew or rime brushed, they will grow suspicious. They come to the cackling of the calls, and after long circuits, and many windings in the air, they alight: the fowler, concealed in a ditch at fifty paces distance, pulls the cord, and takes the whole flock, or part of it, under his net.”</Q></P>
<P>Our fowlers employ all their stratagems to surprize the wild Geese. If the ground be co∣vered with snow, they throw a white shirt over their clothes. At other times, they disguise themselves with branches and leaves, so as to appear a walking bush. They even cover them∣selves with a cow's skin, and advance on all∣four, holding their gun under them: and, with all these wiles, they often cannot approach the Geese, even during the night. It is said, that one always stands sentinel, with its neck ex∣tended and its head raised, and which, on the least symptom of danger, sounds alarm to the flock. But as they cannot suddenly mount, but run three or four paces clapping their wings, the fowler has time to fire on them.</P>
<P>The wild Geese do not remain with us the whole winter, unless the season is mild; for in severe winters, when the rivers and pools are frozen, they advance farther south, whence some return about the end of March, in their progress to the northern countries. They frequent, then, the hot and even the temperate climates in the

The feathers form a considerable branch of trade; those from Somersetshire are esteemed the best, and those from Ireland are reckoned the worst.—The following is an extract
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
from Mr. Pennant's first tour in Scotland: <Q>“The fens near Revesby Abby (in Lincolnshire) eight miles beyond Horncastle, are of vast extent; but serve for little other purpose than the rearing great numbers of Geese, which are the wealth of the fenmen. During the breeding season, these birds are lodged in the same houses with the inhabitants, and even in their very bed-chambers: in every apartment are three rows of coarse wicker pens placed one above another; each bird has its separate lodge divided from the other, which it keeps possession of during the time of sitting. A person, called a <HI>Gozzard,</HI> (goose-herd) attends the flock, and twice a-day drives the whole to water; then brings them back to their habitations, helping those that live in the upper stories” to their nests, without ever misplacing a single bird.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Geese are plucked five times a-year; the first plucking is at Lady-day, for feathers and quills; and the same is renewed for feathers only, four times between that and Michaelmas. The old Geese submit quietly to the operation, but the young ones are very noisy and unruly. I once saw this performed, and ob∣served that the goslings of six weeks old were not spared; for their tails were plucked, as I was told, to habituate them early to what they were to come to.

It is improperly called the <HI>bus∣tard.</HI> Its tall legs are requisite for wading through the large herbs, and its long neck is useful for descrying danger. Its pace is nim∣ble, as is its flight; and it has not the disa∣greeable cackle of its family.

Their flesh, which is salubrious, nutritive, and well tasted, became our principal food, and was seldom out of our reach. Besides those bred on the island, the winds in autumn bring large flocks, no doubt from some desert

country, for sportsmen easily distinguish these new-comers by their indifference at the sight of men. Two or three other kinds of Geese, which we found in these same islands, were not so much sought after, because they con∣tract an oily taste by feeding on fish <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>"The form of the latter," adds M. de Bougainville, “is less elegant than that of the first species; there is one which rises with difficulty above the water; this is noisy: the colours of their plumage are seldom other than white, black, fulvous, and cinereous. All these species, as well as the swans, have under their feathers a very thick white or gray down.”</Q></P></NOTE>.”</Q></P>
<P>We term this species the <HI>Goose of the Malouine islands,</HI> because in these islands it was first found by our French navigators; for the same Geese seem to be met with in Christmas Sound, upon Tierra del Fuego, in Shag Island, and on other islands near Staten Land: at least Captain Cook seems, on this head, to refer to Bou∣gainville's description, when he says, <Q>“The Geese seem to be very well described un∣der the name of <HI>bustards.</HI> They are much smaller than our English tame geese, but eat as well as any I ever tasted. They have short black bills, and yellow legs. The gander is all white; the female is spotted black and white, or gray, with a large white spot on each wing." And a few pages before he gives a fuller description, in the following terms: These birds appeared remarkable for the dif∣ference of colour between the male and the
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
female. The male was something less than an ordinary tame goose, and perfectly white: the female, on the contrary, was black, with white bars across, the head gray; some feathers green, and others white. This difference seems to be fortunate; for the female being obliged to lead her young, the dark colour of her plumage conceals her better from the falcons and other birds of prey.”</Q> These three de∣scriptions seem to belong to the same species, and differ not essentially from each other. These Geese afforded Captain Cook's crew as accept∣able repasts as those at the Falkland islands did the French <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“As soon as we got under the island, we found plenty of shags in the cliffs; but without staying to spend our time and shot upon these, we proceeded on, and presently found sport enough: for, on the south side of the island, were abundance of geese. It happened to be the moulting season; and most of them were on shore for that purpose, and could not fly. There being a great surf, we found great difficulty in landing, and very bad climbing over the rocks when we were landed; so that hundreds of the Geese escaped us, some into the sea, and others up into the island. We, however, by one means or other, got sixty-two, with which we returned on board, all heartily tired; but the acquisition we had made overbalanced every other consideration, and we sat down with a good appetite to supper on part of what the preceding day had produced.”</Q> <HI>Cook's second Voyage,</HI> vol. ii. p. 182.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>THIS also is a large and beautiful species, which is remarkable by a great fleshy ex∣crescence of a comb-shape above the bill, and by the reflections of gold and bronze, glistening like burnished steel, with which its mantle shines on a black ground: the head, and the upper half of the neck, are speckled with black amidst the white, by means of little reflected feathers, that seem buckled on the back of the neck: all the fore side of the body is white, tinged with gray on the flanks. This Goose appears to have a thinner body and a slenderer neck than the common wild goose, though it is at least as large. It was sent to us from the coast of Co∣romandel: and perhaps the crested goose of Madagascar, mentioned by the navigators Renne∣fort and Flaccourt, under the name of <HI>rassangue,</HI> is only the same bird; which we recognize also with all its characters in the <HI>ipecati-apoa</HI> of the

<P>A WHITE cravat, wrapped about its black neck, distinguishes sufficiently this Goose, which is also one of those peculiar to the north∣ern parts of the new world, where at least it derives its origin. It is something larger than our domestic Goose, and has its neck and its body rather longer and more slender; its head and neck are black or blackish, which dark co∣lour sets off the white cravat that covers the throat. The prevailing cast of its plumage is dull brown, and sometimes gray. This Goose is known in France by the name of the <HI>Canada Goose:</HI> it has even multiplied under domestica∣tion, and occurs in several of our provinces. Within these few years, many hundreds inha∣bited the great canal at Versailles, where they lived familiarly with the swans; they were oftener on the grassy margins than in the water. There is at present a great number of them on the magnificent pools that decorate the charm∣ing
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
gardens of Chantilly. They have also mul∣tiplied in Germany and in England. This beautiful species may be viewed as forming the intermediate gradation between the swan and the Goose.</P>
<P>These Cravated Geese migrate southwards in America, for they appear during winter in Ca∣rolina; and Edwards relates, that in the spring they pass in flocks to Canada, and thence return to Hudson's Bay, and the other more northern parts of America. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the <HI>Anas Canadensis:</HI> <Q>“It is cine∣reous; its head and neck are black; its cheeks and throat white.”</Q> It breeds in Hudson's Bay, and lays six or seven eggs.—I must beg leave to subjoin the following extract from Mr. Pennant, to whose ingenious and accurate works I have so often been indebted.</P>
<P><Q>“The English of Hudson's Bay depend greatly on Geese, of these and other kinds, for their support; and, in favourable years, kill three or four thousand, which they salt and barrel. Their arrival is impatiently attended; it is the harbinger of the spring, and the month named by the Indians <HI>the goose moon.</HI> ... They prefer islands to the continent, as further from the haunts of men.... The English send out their servants, as well as the Indians, to shoot these birds on their passage. It is in vain to pursue them; they therefore form a row of huts made of boughs, at musquet∣shot distance from each other, and place them in a line across the vast marshes of the country. Each hovel, or as they are called, <HI>stand,</HI> is occupied by only a single person: these attend the flight of the birds, and on their approach mimic their cackle so well, that the Geese will answer, and wheel and come nearer the stand. The sportsman keeps motionless, and on his knees, with his gun cocked the whole time, and never fires till he has seen the eyes of the Geese. He fires as they are going from him, then picks up another gun that lies by him, and discharges that. The Geese which he has killed he sets up on sticks as if alive, to de∣coy others; he also makes artificial birds for the same purpose. In a good day (for they fly in very uncertain and unequal num∣bers) a single Indian will kill two hundred. Notwithstanding every species of Goose has a different call, yet the Indians are” admirable in their imitation of every one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The vernal flight of the Geese lasts from April to the middle of May. Their first appearance coincides with the thawing of the swamps, when they are very lean. The autumnal, or the season of their return with their young, is from the middle of August to the middle of October. Those which are taken in the latter season, when the frosts usually begin, are preserved in their feathers, and left to be frozen for the fresh provisions of the winter stock. The feathers constitute an article of commerce, and are sent to England.”</Q> <HI>Arctic Zoology,</HI> vol. ii. 545.</P></NOTE></P>

BESIDES these ten species of Geese, we find mention made by travellers of some others, which belong perhaps to the preceding.</P>

<P N="5">5.

<P>THE name <HI>Cravant</HI> is, according to Gesner, no other than <HI>Grau-ent,</HI> which, in Ger∣man, signifies <HI>gray-duck.</HI> In fact, the colour of this bird is brown-gray or blackish, and pretty uniform over its whole plumage; but its port and figure approach nearer to the goose than to the duck. It has the high head and all the other proportions of the goose, on a smaller model, and with a thinner body. Its bill is rather narrow, and pretty short; its head is small, and its neck long and slender: these two parts, and also the top of the breast, are of a blackish brown, except a very narrow white band, which forms a half-collar under the throat; a charac∣ter which leads Belon to find a name relating to this bird in Aristophanes. All the quills of the wings and of the tail, and also the upper coverts of the latter, are likewise of a blackish
<PB N="77" REF="88"/>
brown; but the lateral feathers, and all those of the upper surface of the tail, are white. The plumage of the body is cinereous gray on the back, on the flanks, and above the wings; but it is dapple gray under the belly, where most of the feathers are edged with whitish; the iris of the eye is brownish yellow; the legs and the membranes which connect the toes, are blackish, and also the bill, in which large nos∣trils are perforated and exposed.</P>
<P>The Brent has long been confounded with the bernacle. Willughby owns, that he once supposed they were only the male and female <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frisch says, that the Brent is called <HI>baumgans,</HI> or tree-goose, because it builds its nest in trees, which is altogether improbable: it is more likely that this name was borrowed from the bernacle, which was fabled to owe its birth to rotten wood.</NOTE>, but afterwards perceived distinctly, from many characters, that these birds really formed two different species. Belon stiles the Brent (or <HI>Cravant) the collared sea duck;</HI> and, in another place, he calls the bernacle, the <HI>cravant</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus is much more mistaken when he takes the bird described by Gesner, under the name of <HI>pica marina,</HI> for the Brent or collared goose: this sea-pie of Gesner is the guillemot; and this mistake of so learned a naturalist as Aldrovandus, shows that de∣scriptions in natural history, if ever so little faulty or confused, are of small service in giving a clear idea of the object meant to be re∣presented.</NOTE>; and the people on the French coasts make the same mistake <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“The Brent or nun-goose is very common on this coast (of Croisic) where great flocks are seen; the people call it <HI>bernacle,</HI> and I believed it to be the same till I saw one.”</Q> <HI>Note communi∣cated by M. de Querhoënt.</HI></P></NOTE>. The great resemblance in the plu∣mage
<PB N="78" REF="89"/>
and shape of the body, which obtains in these two birds, has given occasion to the con∣fusion: yet the bernacle is jet black, while the Brent is only dark brown; and besides, the latter frequents the coasts of temperate coun∣tries only, while the bernacle appears only in the most northern countries. And that circum∣stance alone convinces us that they are really two distinct and separate species.</P>
<P>The cry of the Brent is a dull, hollow sound, which we have often heard, and which we may denote by <HI>ouan, ouan;</HI> it is a sort of hoarse bark, which the bird frequently utters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. de Querhoënt.</NOTE>.

<P>The Brent can live in the domestic state <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“A gentleman of this neighbourhood (at Croisic) has pre∣served one in his court-yard two years: the first spring it was very sick at the time of laying; it died the second, leaving one egg.”</Q> <HI>Idem.</HI></P></NOTE>. We have kept one several months. Its food was grain, bran, or soaked bread. It constantly showed a timid, shy disposition, and avoided all familiarity; and though shut up in a garden with sheldrakes, it always lived apart from them: it was even so cowardly, that a garganey, which had before lodged with it, made it run. It was observed to eat as much, perhaps even more, in the night than in the day. It was fond of bathing, and it shook its wings

upon coming out of the water. Yet fresh wa∣ter is not its native element <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; for all those which are seen on our coasts, arrive from the sea.—I shall here insert some observations on this bird, which were communicated to us by M. Baillon.</P>
<P><Q>“The Brents were hardly known on the coasts of Picardy before the winter of 1740. The north wind then brought a prodigious number of them; the sea was covered with them: all the marshes being frozen, they spread over the land, and committed great destruction among the tender corn, which was not sheltered by the snow; they devoured the shoots to the very roots. The country peo∣ple, whose fields were exposed to this devasta∣tion, declared a general war against these birds. They approached the Brents very near the first days, and killed many with sticks and stones. But they seemed as it were to rise again; for new flocks continued to pour in from the sea, and to destroy what plants the frost had spared.”</Q>.......</P>
<P><Q>“Others appeared in 1765, and the sea∣shore was covered with them. But the north wind, which had brought them, ceasing to blow, they did not disperse in the fields, but” departed a few days after.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Since that time, they have been seen every
<PB N="80" REF="91"/>
winter when the north winds blow constantly twelve or fifteen days. Many appeared in the beginning of 1776; but the ground being covered with snow, most of them remained on the sea; and the rest, which had entered the rivers, or spread on the banks, a short distance from the coast, were compelled to return by the ice floated in the streams or heaped up by the tide. As they were hunted, they grew shy, and they are now sprung at as great dis∣tance as other game. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Brent Goose, <HI>Anas-Beriticla:</HI> <Q>“It is brown; its head, its neck, and its breast, black; a white col∣lar.”</Q> The name <HI>Brent</HI> or <HI>Brand</HI> seems to be derived from the Saxon <HI>Brennen,</HI> to burn, and thence transferred to signify marking or stamping of any kind; in the present case it refers to the white spot imprinted on each side of the neck, which is black.</NOTE>”</Q></P>

There is a small island in Lancashire called the <HI>Pile of Foulders,</HI> wherein are found broken pieces of old and bruised ships, some whereof have been cast thither by shipwracke, and also the trunks and bodies with the branches of old and rotten trees, cast up there likewise; whereon is found a certain spume or froth that in time breedeth unto certain shels, in shape like those of the Muskle, but sharper pointed, and of a whitish colour, wherein is contained a thing in form like a lace of silke finely woven as it were together, of a whitish colour; one end whereof is fastened unto the inside of the shell, even as the fish of Oisters and Muskles are; the other end is made fast unto the belly of a rude masse or lumpe, which in time commeth to the shape and form of a bird: when it is perfectly formed, the shell gapeth open, and the first thing that appeareth is the foresaid lace or string; next come the legs of the bird hanging out, and as it groweth greater it openeth the shell by degrees, till at length it has all come forth, and hangeth only by the bill: in short space after it cometh to full maturitie, and falleth into the sea, where it gather∣eth feathers, and groweth to a fowle bigger than a Mallard and lesser than a Goose, having black legs, and bill or beake, and fea∣thers black and white, spotted in such manner as our Mag-Pie, called in some places <HI>Pie-Annet,</HI> which the people of Lancashire call by no other name than tree-goose; which place aforesaid, and all those places adjoyning, do so much abound therewith, that one of the best is bought for three-pence.

But even of our ancient naturalists many re∣jected these fables: Belon, always sober and ju∣dicious, laughs at them; nor have Clusius, Deu∣singius, Albertus Magnus believed report. Bar∣tholin discovered that these goose-bearing conchs contained only a shell-fish of a particular kind: and from the descriptions given of them by

Wormius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The goose-bearing shell is triangular, small, externally white∣blue, glistening, light, compressed, an inch in length and in breadth; when ripe, it consists of four valves, sometimes more, of which the two anterior are thrice as large as the two posterior, which adhere to them as appendices, very thin round a thicker part, by which they cling concealed to the sea-weed; when opened, they show rudiments of a little bird, and the feathers pretty distinct. <HI>Wor∣mius in Musaeo, lib.</HI> iii. 7.</NOTE>, Lobel <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We had shells with a rough thickish pedicle broken off from the bottom of an old ship; they are small, whitish without, glisten∣ing, light, have the thinness of egg-shells, fragile, and bivalve.

We need not remark the absurdity of such a notion: Aeneas Sylvius relates, that chancing to be in Scotland, he inquired particularly for the place of the wonderful metamorphosis of the Barnacle, but was referred to the remote He∣brides and Orknies; and he adds pleasantly, that, as he sought to advance, the miracle retired from him.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="99"/>
As the Barnacles breed in the distant parts of the north, no person for a long time had ob∣served their birth, or even seen their nests; and the Dutch, in a voyage which extended to the eightieth degree of latitude, were the first who discovered these <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“On the west side of Greenland, was a great winding and a flat shore resembling an island; we there found many eggs of <HI>Barnicles</HI> (which the Dutch call <HI>ratgansen);</HI> we found also some of them hatching, which, on being driven away, cried <HI>rot, rot, rot,</HI> (hence their name); one we killed with a stone, we cooked” it, and ate it with sixty eggs which we had carried to the ship.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“These geese or Barnicles were real geese, called <HI>rotgansen,</HI> which come every year in great numbers about Wierengen in Holland, and it was hitherto unknown where they laid their eggs and reared their young; and hence it has happened that no au∣thors have scrupled to write that they are bred on the trees in Scotland...Nor need we wonder that hitherto the retreats where these birds hatch, were unknown, since no person has ever reached the eightieth degree of latitude, much less seen the birds sitting on their eggs.”</Q> <HI>Trois navigations faites par les Hollandois au Sep∣tentrion, par Gerard de Vora; Paris,</HI> 1599, <HI>pp.</HI> 112 and 113.</P></NOTE>.

<P>The Barnacle is certainly of the family of the geese; and Aldrovandus justly blames Gesner for ranging it with the ducks. In fact, it is rather smaller and lighter, it has a slenderer neck, a shorter bill, and legs proportionally taller than the Goose. But it has its figure, its port, and all its shapes; its plumage is agreeably broken with large white and black spaces; and hence Belon has stiled it the <HI>nun (nonnette,</HI> ou <HI>reli∣gieuse).</HI> Its face is white, and two small black streaks join the eyes with the nostrils; a black <HI>domino</HI> covers the neck, and falls with a round edge on the top of the back, and of the breast; all the mantle is richly waved with gray and black, with a white fringe, and all the under side of the body is of a fine clouded white.</P>

<P>IT is this bird that furnishes the soft, warm, light down which bears its name. The Eider is a species of goose, which inhabits the north∣ern seas, and descends no lower than the coasts of Scotland.</P>
<P>It is nearly as large as a goose: the principal colours of the male are white and black; and,
<PB REF="103"/>
<FIGURE>

<PB N="91" REF="104"/>
different from the usual disposition, the former covers the back, and the latter the belly; and the same obscure black appears on the top of the head, and on the quills of the tail and of the wings, except the feathers next the body, which are white. Below the nape of the neck there is a broad greenish plate; and the white of the breast is washed with a brick or wine tint. The female is not so large as the male, and all its plumage is uniformly tinged with rusty and blackish, in transverse and waving lines, on a brown gray ground. In both sexes, we perceive scallops traced by little close feathers like velvet, which extend from the front on both sides of the bill, and almost under the nostrils.</P>
<P>The Eider down is highly esteemed; and even on the spot, in Norway and Iceland, it sells very dear <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan.</NOTE>. This substance is so elastic and so light, that two or three pounds of it, though pressed into a ball that may be held in the hand, will so swell as to fill and distend the foot-cover∣ing of a large bed.</P>
<P>The best down, which is called <HI>live down (duvet vif)</HI> is what the Eider pulls to line her nest, and which is gathered in the nest itself: for, besides the reluctance to kill so useful a bird <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Pontoppidan says even, that in Norway it is prohibited to kill it for the down: "With the more reason," he adds, <Q>“since the fea∣thers of the dead bird are fat, subject to rot, and far from being so light as what the female plucks, to form a bed for its young.”</Q></P></NOTE>,
<PB N="92" REF="105"/>
the down taken from the dead body is inferior; either because the down is in full perfection at the breeding season, or because the bird plucks only the finest and most delicate, that which covers the stomach and belly.</P>
<P>Care must be taken not to seek and gather the down in the nests, till after some days of dry weather; nor must the birds be driven hastily from their nests, for in the fright they drop their excrements, with which the down is often fouled <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Natural History of the Eider, by Martin Thrane Brunnich, <HI>art.</HI> 41.</NOTE>. To clear it of the dung, the feathers are spread upon a sieve of stretched cords, which are beat with a stick; so that the heavy clots fall through, and the light down jumps off.</P>
<P>The eggs are five or six in number <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>"It is not uncommon," says Van Troil, “to find more, even ten and upwards, in the same nest occupied by two females, which live together in perfect concord.”</Q> <HI>Letters on Iceland.</HI></P></NOTE>, of a deep green, and very good to eat <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Anderson pretends, that to have a number of these, a stick of a foot in height is planted in the nest, and that the bird continues to lay till the heap of eggs rises to the point of this stick, in order that she may sit to cover them. But were it as true as it is impro∣bable, that the Icelanders employed this barbarous artifice, they would ill understand their true interest, to destroy a bird so pro∣cious to them, since, worn out with excessive laying, it generally expires.</P></NOTE>. If they be stolen, the female strips her plumage again to make a second hatch, which is smaller than the first. If the nest be again plundered, as the female can furnish no more down, the male lends his aid, and plucks the feathers from his
<PB N="93" REF="106"/>
breast; which is the reason that the lining of the third nest is whiter than that of the first. But before we seize the spoils, we must now wait till the mother has hatched her eggs, which at most are only two or three, perhaps but one: for if her hopes of progeny are dashed a third time, she will for ever abandon the place; but if she be permitted to rear her family, she will re∣turn the following year, and bring with her the young Eiders.</P>
<P>In Norway and Iceland, the districts to which the Eiders habitually resort to build their nest, are a species of property which is carefully pre∣served, and transmitted by inheritance. There are spots that contain many hundred of these nests; and we may judge, from the high price of down, what profit the proprietor must draw <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To take an Eider's nest on another's lands, is reputed theft in Iceland. <HI>Van Troil.</HI></NOTE>. The Icelanders are at the utmost pains to invite the Eiders, each into his own estate; and when they perceive that these birds begin to haunt some of the islets which maintain herds, they soon remove the cattle and dogs to the main land, and procure the Eiders an undis∣turbed retreat <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brunnich, § 48.</NOTE>. These people have even formed, by art and persevering labour, many small islands by disjoining from the continent several promontories that stretch into the sea. It is in these retreats of solitude and tranquillity
<PB N="94" REF="107"/>
that the Eiders love to settle; though they are not averse to nestle near habitations, if no∣thing molest them, and if the dogs and cattle be removed. <Q>"A person," says Horrebow, “as I myself have witnessed, may walk among these birds while they are sitting, and not scare them; he may even take eggs, and yet they will renew their laying as often as three times.”</Q></P>
<P>All the down that can be collected is sold annually to Danish or Dutch merchants <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“A female in her nest gives commonly half a pound of down, which is reduced to one half in cleaning... The cleaned down is valued by the Icelanders at forty-five <HI>fish</HI> (of which forty-eight make a rix-dollar) the pound; the raw down at sixteen fish... The Icelandic company sold, in 1750, down amounting in value to 3757 rix-dollars (about 850l. sterling), besides what was sent directly to Gluckstad.”</Q> <HI>Van Troil.</HI></P></NOTE>, who come to buy it at Drontheim, and other parts of Norway and Iceland. Little or none of it is left in the country <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. des Voy. <HI>tom.</HI> xviii. <HI>p.</HI> 21.</NOTE>. In that rough climate, the robust hunter, covered with bear's skin, en∣joys, in his solitary hut, a peaceful, perhaps a profound sleep; while, in polished nations, the man of ambition, stretched on a bed of Eider down, and under a gilded roof, idly seeks to pro∣cure the sweets of repose.</P>
<P>We shall here add some facts relating to the Eider, extracted from a small work of M. Brun∣nich, written in Danish, and translated into Ger∣man, from which we directed a French version to be made.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="108"/>
In the breeding season, some male Eiders are seen flying single: The Norwegians call them <HI>gield-fugl, gield-aee</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">i. e. <HI>Free bird; free Eider.—T.</HI></NOTE>; they are such as have not obtained mates, and have been worsted in the struggles for the possession of the females, which are fewer in this species than the males. Yet they sooner arrive at maturity, so that the old males and the young females pair together, and hence their first hatch is smaller than the subse∣quent.</P>
<P>At the time of pairing, the male continually screams <HI>ha, ho,</HI> with a raucous and moaning voice; that of the female resembles the cry of a common duck. The first object of these birds is to place their nest under shelter of some stones or bushes, and particularly of junipers. Both male and female labour in concert; and the latter pulls the down from her breast, and heaps it, so as to form quite round the nest a thick puffed roll, which she presses on the eggs, when she goes in quest of food: for the male assists not in covering, but keeps watch in the vicinity, and gives notice if an enemy appears; the female then conceals her head, and if the danger is ur∣gent, she flies to her mate, who treats her harshly, it is said, if any accident happen to the brood. The ravens suck the eggs, and kill the young; the mother therefore hastens to remove them from the nest, and a few hours after they are hatched,
<PB N="96" REF="109"/>
she takes them on her back, and, with an easy flight, transports them to the sea.</P>
<P>The male now leaves her, and neither of them returns more to land. Several hatches unite at sea, and form flocks of twenty or thirty with their mothers, which lead them, and conti∣nually dash the water, to bring up, with the mud and sediment, insects and small shell-fish for such of the young as are too weak to dive themselves. This happens from the month of July, or even June; and the Greenlanders reckon the time of summer by the age of the young Eiders.</P>
<P>It is not until the third year that the male ac∣quires regular and distinct colours: those of the female are much sooner unfolded; and in every respect the growth of the male is more rapid than that of the female. Both of them are at first co∣vered or clothed with a blackish down.</P>
<P>The Eider dives very deep after fish, and feeds also on muscles and other shell-fish, and seems very keen upon the garbage which the fishermen throw out of their barks. These birds remain on the sea the whole winter, even near Green∣land, seeking the parts of the coast most clear of ice, and returning to land only in the evening, or previous to a storm, which their flight to the coast during the day, it is said, infallibly fore∣bodes.</P>
<P>Though the Eiders journey, and not only shift from one place to another, but venture so far on sea, that they have been supposed to pass
<PB N="97" REF="110"/>
from Greenland to America <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brunnich.</NOTE>; yet they cannot properly be said to be birds of passage, since they never leave the frozen climates, which their close down so well fits them to bear. They can procure subsistence wherever the sea is open: they advance from the coast of Greenland to the island of Disco, but no farther; because, beyond it, the sea is covered with ice <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anderson.</NOTE>; it appears even that they resort thither less than formerly <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Greenlanders say, that formerly they filled in a very lit∣tle time a boat with Eider's eggs, in the islands round Ball River, and that they could not walk without treading on the eggs; but this plenty begins to diminish, though still astonishing. <HI>Idem.</HI></NOTE>. Yet they are found at Spitzbergen; for the Eider is the same with the <HI>mountain duck</HI> of Martens, though he himself mistook it <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">The mountain duck is a kind of a wild duck, or rather of a wild goose, as large as a middling goose; its plumage is mottled with different colours, and very beautiful; that of the male is marked with black and white, and the female has its feathers of the same colour with that of a partridge...They make their nests in low places with their own feathers, which they pluck from under their belly, and which they mix with moss; but these are not the same with what is called the <HI>Eider down</HI> (in this Martens is mistaken, since every circumstance of his description characterizes the Eider.) We found in their nests sometimes two, sometimes three, and even four eggs, of a pale green, and somewhat larger than those of our ducks. Our sailors, boring both ends, took out the white and yolk, and threaded them. The vessels which had arrived before us at Spitz∣bergen, had taken numbers of these birds. The first days they were not at all shy, but in time they grew so cautions, that one could hardly approach so near them as to take a proper aim. It was in the south haven, and on the 18th of June, that we first killed one. <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ueil des Voyages du Nord, tom.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 98.</NOTE>.

The natives of the country report, that this goose is found in the first island Kurilski, but is ne∣ver seen on the continent. <HI>Krascheninicoff.</HI></NOTE>. In our seas, the most southern parts which these birds visit, are the islands Kerago and Kona, near the coasts of Scotland; Bornholm, Christiansoë, and the pro∣vince of Gothland in Sweden <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brunnich.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the Eider, <HI>Anas Mollissima:</HI> <Q>“Its bill is cylindrical; its cere cleft behind, and wrinkled.”</Q> The male is twice as large as a common tame duck; the female weighs three pounds and an half. The Eiders occur in the northern parts of both continents: in Greenland they build their nests among the grass, and in Sweden among the juniper bufhes. They dive to great depths for their food, which consists of various sorts of shell-fish: the Greenlanders pursue them, and dart them as they rise fatigued. Their flesh is good, and their skin is esteemed an excellent inner gar∣ment. The most southern retreats of these birds are the western isles of Scotland, Inch-colm in the Firth of Forth, and the Farn isles on the Northumbrian coasts. On the latter Mr. Pennant landed, 15th July 1769; and we shall borrow the following extract from his nar∣rative.—<Q>“We found the female Eider ducks at that time sitting: the lower part of their nests was made of sea plants; the upper part was formed of the down which they pull off their own breasts, in which the eggs were surrounded, and warmly bedded: in some were three, in others five eggs, of a large size, and pale olive co∣lour, as smooth and glossy as if varnished over. The nests were built on the beach, among the loose pebbles not far from the wa∣ter. The ducks sit very close, nor will they rise till you almost tread on them. The drakes separate themselves during the breed∣ing season. We robbed a few of their nests of the down, and after carefully separating it from the tang, found that the down weigh∣ed only three quarters of an ounce, but was so elastic as to fill the crown of the largest hat. The people of this country call these St. Cuthbert's ducks, from the saint of the islands.”</Q></P> <P><HI>A Tour in Scotland,</HI> 8vo. <HI>pp.</HI> 35 and 36.</P>
<P>It appears from this extract, that the quantity of down which lines the Eider's nests, is much smaller on the Farn isles than in Iceland; a proof that these birds accommodate themselves according to situ∣ation and climate.</P></NOTE></P>

to glide through the ocean or plunge under its billows, the aquatic birds seemed destined by nature to live for ever remote from our soci∣ety, and from the limits of our dominion.</P>
<P>Their only tie to the land is the necessity of depositing the fruit of their loves. By availing ourselves of that necessity, and of the feeling which so powerfully animates all creatures, we have enslaved them without imposing constraint; and by their fondness to their offspring we have attached them to our abodes.</P>
<P>Eggs, taken from the reeds and rushes amidst water, and set under an adopted mother, first produced, in our farm-yards, wild, shy, fugitive birds, perpetually roving and unsettled, and im∣patient to regain the abodes of liberty. But after they had tasted the pleasures of love in the domestic asylum, the same fowls, and more espe∣cially their descendants, grew gentler and more tractable, and, under our care and protection, bred the tame sorts: for it is a general remark, that, till animals propagate in the domestic state, some individuals may be enslaved, but the spe∣cies will preserve their independence. If, in spite of their irksome bondage, the passion, which unites the sexes, kindles and dilates, it will sweeten their condition, and impart all the charms of freedom: they forget, they relinquish the pre∣rogatives of the savage state: and the scene of their first pleasures, of their early loves, that scene, so dear to every feeling creature, becomes
<PB N="102" REF="118"/>
their favourite abode. The education of the fa∣mily farther augments this attachment, and, at the same time, communicates it to the young, which, being citizens by birth of the residence adopted by their parents, never seek to change it. They know not other situations, and they contract a warm predilection for the place of their nativity; a passion felt even by slaves.</P>
<P>Yet have we subjugated only a small portion of the whole species, particularly in those birds which nature, bestowing a double privilege, has destined to rove in the air and on the sea. Some, indeed, have become our captives, but the bulk of them have eluded our attempts, and will for even preserve their independence.</P>
<P>The species of the Duck and that of the goose, are thus divided into two great tribes; of which the one, long since tamed, propagates in our court-yards, forming one of the most useful and most numerous families of our poul∣try; and the other, no doubt still more exten∣sive, constantly avoids us, and lives on the water, only visiting us in winter, and retiring in the spring, to breed in the distant, sequestered re∣gions of the north.</P>
<P>It is about the 15th of October that the Ducks begin to appear in France <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At least in our northern provinces; their appearance is later in the southern countries: at Malta, for example, as we are assured by the Commander Desmazy, they are not seen till November.</NOTE>. At first, their flocks are small and unfrequent; but these
<PB N="103" REF="119"/>
are succeeded in November by more numerous bodies. These birds are distinguished by the oblique lines and regular triangles which they form in the air. After they have all arrived from the northern countries, they are seen continually flying from one pool or river to another. Now is the time when the fowlers make great cap∣tures, by watching in the day, by lying in am∣bush at night, or by employing different snares or large nets. But all these methods of surpriz∣ing or decoying, must be dextrously managed, since Ducks are exceedingly mistrustful. They never alight till after making several wheels round the spot; as if their intention were to sur∣vey it, and discover whether an enemy lurked in it. And when they settle, they take every pre∣caution: they bend their flight, and dart ob∣liquely on the surface of the water, which they raze and skim; then they swim at large, keeping always at a distance from the banks. At the same time, some of them watch for the public safety, and give alarm when they apprehend danger; insomuch that the sportsman is often deceived, and sees them rise before he can fire. Yet if he judges himself sufficiently near, he need not be precipitate; for as the wild Duck springs vertically <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, it does not get so soon out of reach as a bird that shoots directly onwards,
<PB N="104" REF="120"/>
and it allows as much time for taking aim when flushed at the distance of sixty paces, as a par∣tridge at that of thirty.</P>

Hebert.</HI></NOTE>, and fires on them with advan∣tage. He knows the arrival of these birds by the rustling of their wings <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I shall here describe a method of fowling, of which I was both a spectator and an actor: it was in a plain between Laon and Rheims that a man, and we may easily judge that he was not the richest in the country, had taken his station in the middle of a meadow; there, wrapped in an old mantle, with no other shelter than a hur∣dle of hazel branches, which screened him from the wind, he wait∣ed patiently till some flock of wild Ducks should pass within his reach; he was sitting on a cage of ozier, divided into three com∣partments, and filled with tame drakes; his post was in the neigh∣bourhood of a river, which winded in this meadow, and at a place where its banks rose seven or eight feet; to one of the banks of this river he had built a hut of reeds, like a sentry-box, perforated with loop-holes, which he could open or shut at pleasure, to spy his prey and take his aim: if he saw a flock of wild Ducks in the air (and they often passed, because at this season of sport they were fired at on all sides in the marshes) he let loose two or three of his tame drakes, which took flight and alighted within thirty paces of the sentry-box, where he had scattered some grains of oats, which these drakes gathered greedily, for they were kept hungry; there were also some female Ducks fastened to some poles stuck into the banks, and laid close on the surface of the water, so that these Ducks could not come to the brink, but were obliged to call upon the tame drakes. The wild ones, after several turns in the air, stooped down∣wards and followed the tame drakes, or, if they lingered too long, the person dispatched a second flight of drakes, and even a third, and then ran from his observatory to his hut without being perceiv∣ed; all the banks were strewed with branches of trees and with reeds; he opened that loop-hole which answered best, observed the favourable moment when he could fire without killing his calls, and as he pointed on the surface of the water, almost horizontally, and saw the Ducks heads, he killed sometimes five or six at a shot. <HI>Extract of a Memoir of M. Hebert.</HI></NOTE>, and he
<PB N="105" REF="121"/>
makes haste to kill the first comers; for in this late season the night creeps fast on, and as the Ducks alight only in the dusk, the time is pre∣cious. But a greater capture may be made by spreading a net over the surface of the water, and leading the drag into the hut; in this way the whole flock of wild ducks decoyed by the domestic calls will be taken. This sport re∣quires a stock of patience; and the fowler, mo∣tionless and half-frozen, is more likely to catch cold than game. But the pleasure usually pre∣dominates, hope urges him to renew his appli∣cation;—and the same night, that blowing his fingers, he swears never to return to his frozen
<PB N="106" REF="122"/>
post, he lays projects for the succeeding even∣ing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We owe to M. Bailion the idea and the detail of this sort of sport; for which we thank him, and which we shall give in his own words:</P>
<P><Q>“A considerable number of wild Ducks is taken every winter in our marshes near the sea; the contrivance employed to decoy them into the nets is very ingenious; it manifestly proves the dis∣position” of these birds to society.</Q> It is this:—</P>
<P><Q>“They choose in the marshes a flat covered with about two feet of water, which they consine with a slight bank; the larg∣est and remetest hedges and trees are the best: on the edge they form an earthen hut well lined with clay at the bottom, and co∣vered with sods laid on plashed branches; there the fowler sits,” and his head overtops the hut.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“They stretch in the water, nets like those for larks, furnished with two strong iron bars, which hold them down on the mud;” the extending cords are fixed in the hut.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The fowler fastens several Ducks before the nets; and those of the wild breed, and procured from eggs gathered in the spring, are the best: the drakes, with which they are paired in October,” are shut up in a corner of the lodge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The attentive fowler surveys the horizon on all sides, especially towards the north; as soon as he perceives a flock of wild Ducks. he takes one of the drakes, and throws it into the air: this bird flies instantly to the rest and joins them; the females, over which it passes, scream and call; if it delays too long to return, a second is dispatched, and often a third; the redoubled cries of the fe∣males bring them back, the wild ones follow, and alight with them; the form of the hut sometimes disquiets them, but they in∣stantly gain confidence when they see their betrayers swim se∣curely to the females, which are between the hut and the nets: they continue to advance, and the fowler attends the favourable” instant, and sometimes takes a dozen or more at a single draw.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I have always remarked, that the Ducks trained to this sport seldom came within the inclosure of the net, but flew over it, and” knew the spot, though nothing appeared out of the water.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“All the marsh birds, such as the whistlers, the shovelers, the teals, the pochards, &amp;c. come to the call of the Ducks, or follow” the betrayers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“This sport is practised only in moon-light; the most favour∣able time is the rising of that luminary, and an hour before day∣break. It is unprofitable, except in northerly or north-easterly winds, because the Ducks then journey, or are in motion to con∣gregate. I have seen to the amount of an hundred taken by the same nets in one night. A man of weak constitution, or sensible to cold, could not support the hardships inseparable from this sort of fowling: he must remain motionless, and often drenched” the whole night in the middle of the marshes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I have often seen the wild Ducks descend to the call of the fe∣males of their own kind, how elevated soever they might be in the air; the betrayers flew sometimes with them more than a quarter of an hour; each of the fowlers over whom the flock passes, dispatches others to them; they disperse, and each band of traitors leads off a detachment; that of the fowlers which have” wild females is constantly the largest.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“In general ducking is a seducing but laborious sport: a per∣son must brave the rigour of the weather, which, at that season, is often severe, his feet soaked in the water, and his toes chilled with the frost: he must patiently wait at night in the hut, or walk out before day on the brooks and the rivulets. I remember to have gone a-ducking every day for a month together, when the weather was excessively cold, yet resolving with myself that each excursion should be my last; and to crown my hardships, I had the mortification to see my excellent dog drowned, which was caught among the ice. I speak as an old sportsman, recounting my feats.”</Q> <HI>Extract from the excellent Memoir which M. Hebert has obligingly written for us on Ducks.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="123"/>
In Lorraine, on the pools which border on the Sarre, Ducks are caught with a net stretch∣ed vertically, and like the draw-net used for woodcocks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Lottinger.</NOTE>. In many other places, the fowler sitting in a boat, covered with boughs and reeds, approaches slowly the Ducks that are dispersed on the water, which he collects together by
<PB N="108" REF="124"/>
setting a little dog after them: the fear of an enemy prompts them to assemble, and they gra∣dually join. They may be fired at, one by one, as they come near; and to prevent noise, a sort of trunk-guns are used, or a discharge may be made on the whole flock with a large blun∣derbuss, which scatters the shot, and which will kill or wound a good number; but no more than one fire can be given, for those which escape know ever after the boat, and carefully avoid it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ducks have a sort of memory, which recognizes the snare that they have once escaped. At Nantua, on the edge of a lake, a hut was constructed with branches of fir and with snow; and to make the Ducks to approach it, they are pursued at a distance by two boats; this plan succeeded eight or ten days, after which it was impossible to make them return. <HI>M. Hebert.</HI></NOTE>. This very amusing sport is called <HI>the frolic (badinage).</HI></P>
<P>The wild Ducks are also caught with hooks baited with <HI>calves lights,</HI> and fastened to floating hoops. Indeed the fowling for Ducks is every where <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Navarette makes the Chinese practise the same stratagem for catching Ducks, that Peter Martyr describes as an invention of the Indians at Cuba, who swimming on their lakes, he says, with their head only out of the water, and covered by a calibash, catch the geese by the feet.</NOTE> one of the chief sports of autumn <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>The method of ducking used by the Kamtschadales is thus de∣scribed: <Q>“Autumn is the season of the great ducking at Kamtschatka; they go to the places covered with lakes, or full of rivers and inter∣sected by woods; they clear the avenues across these woods from one lake to another, they stretch between the two, nets supported by high poles, and which can be let down by slipping cords, of which they hold the ends; at evening these nets being raised as high as the Ducks flight, these birds shoot across in multitudes, and with such force, that they sometimes break through the bar∣rier,” but are oftener caught.</Q></P>

<P><PB N="109" REF="125"/>
Of all the provinces in France, Picardy is that wherein the breeding of tame Ducks is most attended to, and the catching of the wild ones the most profitable; insomuch, that it brings a pretty considerable revenue to that country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“A good part of the wild Ducks, and other birds of the same kind, which supply the markets of Paris, is brought from Picardy. The quantity caught each winter in the two passages, is astonish∣ing. This sport begins in the Laonois, a few leagues from Laon: from thence to the sea there is a continued chain of marshes or of meadow, that are overflowed in the winter, the extent scarcely less than thirty leagues: when the rivers Oise and Serre swell over their banks, their waters unite, and cover all the interjacent coun∣try. The river Somme likewise spreads over an immense country in its inundations. The fowling for Ducks constitutes therefore a branch of trade in Picardy: I have been assured that it was farmed at thirty thousand livres (about £. 1,250.) on the single pool of St. Lambert, near La Fere; it is true that this pool is seven or eight leagues in compass, and perhaps the right of fish∣ing was included. When I resided in that province, there were barks freighted from ten to fifty crowns, according to the advan∣tageousness of their situation; and I am besides assured that there were some of these duck-boats furnished with nets to the value” of three thousand livres (£. 125.)</Q></P> <P><Q>“Viewing these vast marshes from the neighbouring heights, I perceived that great glades were formed, by cutting the rushes between two waters with a bill or hook; these glades are nearly of a triangular shape, and it is in the corners that the nets are set; they seemed to be a sort of large weel-nets, that would sink on letting go the counterpoise which keeps them on the surface of the water; I am at least certain, that the Ducks are drowned in them: often have I seen thirties of them spread on the moss, to dry in the sun, in order to prevent, I was told, the flesh from contracting a musty smell from the wet feathers; I then learnt that they drowned the Ducks in the nets; they added, that they employed little tawny dogs, much like foxes, to collect them and drive them into the nets: the Ducks collect round a fox, from a sort of antipathy, as they do about an owl or any other call-bird; these little dogs are trained to lead them whither they have been taught.”</Q> <HI>Extract of the Memoir communicated by M. Hebert.</HI></P></NOTE>. It is conducted on an extensive
<PB N="110" REF="126"/>
plan in the inlets or little creeks, disposed by nature or cut artificially along the margins of lakes, and into the thick clusters of reeds. But no where is this species of ducking carried on with greater preparation, or more agreeable suc∣cess, than on the beautiful pool of Arminvilliers in Brie. I shall here give the description which was sent to us by M. Rey, secretary to his grace the duke of Penthievre.</P>
<P><Q>“On one side of this pool, shaded with reeds and skirted by a small wood, the water forms a deep creek in the grove, a sort of little shel∣tered haven, where perpetual calm prevails. From this haven canals are cut into the heart of the wood, not in straight lines, but in twist∣ed arches: these, called <HI>horns,</HI> are pretty broad and deep at their mouth, but gradually con∣tract both in breadth and depth as they extend
<PB N="111" REF="127"/>
and wind among the trees, and at last draw to” a dry point.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The canal, from its origin to near its mid∣dle, is covered with a cradle-net, at first pretty wide and high, which narrows and descends as the canal contracts, and terminates at its” point in a weel, which shuts like a purse.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Such is the great snare fitted and prepared for the numerous flocks of Ducks, mixed with pochards, golden-eyes, and teals, which come to alight on this pool in the middle of Octo∣ber. But to draw them to the creek and the fatal <HI>horns,</HI> required some subtle contrivance; and this contrivance has been long concerted” and practised.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“In the midst of the grove and of the canals, dwells the Ducker, who thrice every day goes from his little house to scatter the grain, on which he feeds the whole year above an hun∣dred Ducks, half tame, half wild, that, swim∣ming constantly in the pool, never fail, at the accustomed hour, and at the sound of a whistle, to rise and fly vigorously to the inlet, and wind” up the canals where their food waits them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“These are the <HI>traitors,</HI> as the Ducker calls them, which mingling on the pool with the wild flocks, lead them to the inlet, and thence decoy them into the <HI>horns;</HI> while, concealed behind a row of reed-hurdles, the Ducker pro∣ceeds throwing grain before them, and entices them under the mouth of the cradle-nets;
<PB N="112" REF="128"/>
then showing himself through the intervals of the hurdles, disposed obliquely, and to conceal him from the Ducks that advance, but disclose him to the sight of such as have got before, which in their trepidation rush headlong into the labyrinth, and drive pellmel into the weel. The half tame ones seldom enter; they are used to the diversion, and return again to repeat the decoy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby describes exactly the same mode of ducking as practised in the countres of Lincoln and Norfolk in England, and where they take, he says, four thousand Ducks probably in the course of the winter. He says also, that to collect them, a tawny dog is used: moreover, a great number of Ducks must breed in those fenny countries, since, according to his account, the greatest cap∣ture is made when the Ducks are in moult, at which time the boats have only to push them forward into the nets stretched on the pools. [An ample description of the method of catching Ducks in the Lincolnshire fens, may be seen in the British Zoology.—T.]</NOTE>.”</Q></P>
<P>In the autumnal passage, the wild ducks roam at large on the lakes, and remote from the shores; and there they spend a great part of the day resting themselves, or sleeping. <Q>“I have observed them," says M. Baillon, "with a perspective glass on our largest pools, which sometimes appear entirely covered with them. Their heads lay motionless under their wings, till they all took flight half an hour after sun∣set.”</Q></P>
<P>In fact, the Ducks show more activity in the night than in the day: they feed, they journey, they arrive and depart chiefly in the evening
<PB N="113" REF="129"/>
and in the night; and most of those which are seen in broad day have been forced to fly by sportsmen or birds of prey. In the night, the rustling of their wings marks their course. The clapping of their wings is the most noisy at their rising; and hence Varro gives the Duck the epithet <HI>Quassagipenna.</HI></P>
<P>As long as the season continues mild, the aquatic insects and small fish, the frogs which have not yet crept under the mud, the seeds of the bull-rush, the water lentil, and some other bog plants, afford abundant subsistence to the Ducks. But towards the end of December or the beginning of January, if the great pieces of standing water are frozen, they remove to run∣ning rivers, and afterwards resort to the edge of woods to gather acorns, and sometimes even they alight among the fields sown with corn; and if the frost last eight or ten days, they dis∣appear, and return not till the thaws in the month of February: at that time, they are seen to arrive in the evening with the south winds, but in smaller numbers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“The difference is great between those which arrive and those which retire; I have been able to make the comparison in Brie for six or seven years; perhaps not the half re-pass, and yet their number keeps up, and every year as many return.”</Q> <HI>M. Hebert.</HI></P></NOTE>, their flocks being probably thinned by the losses sustained during the winter <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“It has often come into my head to compare the population of the wild Ducks with that of the rooks, the crows, &amp;c. Of these one would be tempted to think that more retire than arrive, and that, because they retire in flocks. They are never killed, they have very few enemies, and they take the surest precautions for their safety. The rigours of our winters cannot affect their temperament, which is adapted to cold; in the end, the earth must be covered with them. Yet their multitude, though it might seem to be innumerable, is fixed; which proves, I think, that they are not, as usually believed, favoured with a longer life than other birds, and if they make only one annual hatch, as I” am well assured, their population cannot be immense.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I suppose that the wild Duck lays fifteen or sixteen eggs, and hatches them: allowing one half for accidents, addle eggs, &amp;c. I would reckon the multiplication at eight young to each pair. Supposing the destruction during winter to reduce this again to an half, the species might still, we see, maintain its numbers. More than the half are killed in Picardy, but very few in Brie and in Bresse, where there are many pools. When I limit each hatch to eight young, I make but a moderate allowance; the marsh buzzard destroys many, as I am certain; and the fox, it is said, concerts his measures so well as always to catch a few.”</Q> <HI>M. Hebert.</HI></P></NOTE>. Their social instinct seemse
<PB N="114" REF="130"/>
to be impaired by the diminution of their num∣bers; and they no longer keep company with each other. They pass dispersed, fly in the night-time, lurk among the rushes during the day. They halt no longer in a place than a contrary wind constrains them. They seem al∣ready to join in pairs, and they hasten to the northern countries, where they breed and spend the summer.</P>
<P>In that season, they may be said to cover all the lakes and all the rivers of Siberia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the plain of Mangasea, on the Jenisea, there are innumer∣able flocks of geese and Ducks of different kinds. <HI>Gmelin.—</HI>The Barabin Tartars live on milk, fish, ... game, and especially the Ducks and the divers, which abound in this district. <HI>Idem.</HI></NOTE> and

Hoegstroem, "these birds seem disposed, if not to drive away the men, at least to fill up their place: for as soon as the Lap∣landers go in the spring to the mountains, the flocks of wild Ducks fly to the western sea; and when the Laplanders descend again in au∣tumn to inhabit the plain, these birds have already retired.”</Q> Many other travellers give the same account <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">In the northern lakes, the Ducks are so numerous as to seem to cover almost the whole water; they are seldom disturbed by the fowler, as the sport is much more abundant in the wood than on the water. <HI>Olaus Magnus.</HI></NOTE>: <Q>"I do not believe," says Regnard, “that there is a country in the world more abounding with Ducks, teals, and other water fowls, than Lapland. The rivers are all covered with them; ... and in the month of May their nests are in such plenty, that the desert seems filled with them.”</Q> Yet some pairs of these birds, which circumstances have
<PB N="116" REF="132"/>
prevented from joining the bulk of the species, remain in our temperate countries, and breed in our marshes. It is only on these stragglers that observations could be made with regard to the peculiarities in the amours of these birds, and the attention they bestow on rearing their young in the wild state.</P>
<P>After the first gentle airs, towards the end of February, the males begin to court the females, and sometimes fight with each other through rivalship. The pairing lasts about three weeks. The male seems diligent in seeking out a pro∣per place for the depositing the fruits of their loves: he points it out to the female, who con∣sents, and takes possession. The spot is gene∣rally a thick tuft of rushes, raised and insulated in the middle of the marsh. The female pierces this tuft, deepens it, and moulds it into the shape of a nest, by pressing down the rushes which in∣cumber it. But though the wild Ducks, like other water-fowls, prefer the vicinity of water for breeding <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristotle, <HI>lib.</HI> vi. 7.</NOTE>, yet some nests are found pretty remote, among heaths, or in the cultivated fields on the cocks of straw gathered by the labourer, or even in the forests on mutilated oaks, and in old forsaken nests <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The wild Duck is very cunning; she does not always make her nest by the edge of water, nor even on the ground; they are often found in the middle of heaths, at the distance of a quarter of a league from the water: they have been known to lay in the nests of magpies and crows, on very lofty trees. <HI>Salerne.</HI></NOTE>. Each nest contains
<PB N="117" REF="133"/>
usually from ten to fifteen eggs, and sometimes eighteen: their albumen is greenish, and their yolk red <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>. It is remarked that the old Ducks lay more, and begin earlier, than the young ones.</P>
<P>Every time the female rises from her eggs, even for a short interval, she covers them with the down that she pulls from her body to clothe her nest. She never descends upon them from the wing, but alights an hundred paces beyond the spot, and walks to it warily, observing whe∣ther any foes be nigh; but when once she is seated on the eggs, the approach even of a man will not flush her.</P>
<P>The male seems to take no share in covering the eggs; only he keeps at a short distance, and accompanies the female when she goes in search of food, and protects her from the importunities of other males. The incubation lasts thirty days: all the young are hatched in one day; and on the succeeding the mother descends from the nest, and calls them to the water. Timorous or chilly, they hesitate to enter, and some even re∣tire; but the boldest plunges after its mother, and the rest soon follow. When they have once quitted their nest, they return no more. If it is situated far from the water, or too elevated, the father <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">According to M. Hebert.</NOTE> and the mother <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">According to M. Lottinger.</NOTE> take them in the bill,
<PB N="118" REF="134"/>
and transport them one after another <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was known to Belon.</NOTE>. In the evening, the mother gathers them together, and withdraws them among the reeds, where she che∣rishes them under her wings during the night. All day they watch, on the surface of the water and on the grassy mead, for gnats, which are their first food.

<P>Nature, while she early invigorates the muscles necessary for swimming, seems to neglect for some time the formation, or at least the growth of their wings: these continue near six weeks short and mishapen. The duckling has acquired half its size, is feathered under the belly and along the back, before the quills of the wings begin to appear; and it can hardly attempt to fly till three months. In this state it is called <HI>hallebran</HI> in French, a name derived apparently from the German <HI>halber-ente,</HI> or half-duck <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This appellation was given as early as the time of Aldro∣vandus.</NOTE>: and as these <HI>hallebrans</HI> are unable to fly, they afford an easy and successful sport on the pools and marshes that are stocked with them <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“I shall here describe what a gentleman of my acquaintance practised on a marsh, between Laon and Notre Dame de Liesse.

<P>In all countries, men have been solicitous to domesticate, to appropriate a species so useful as that of our Duck <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; and not only has it become common, but foreign kinds, originally equally wild, have been multiplied, and have produced new tame breeds. For example, that of the Muscovy Duck, from the double profit of its plumage and its flesh, and from the facility of raising it, has grown one of the most useful fowls, and one the most diffused in the new world.</P>
<P>To rear Ducks with profit, and form nume∣rous and prosperous flocks, they require, like the geese, a place near water, and where spacious open banks and turfy strands afford them room to feed, rest, and play. Not but Ducks are often seen confined and kept dry within the inclosure of a court-yard; but this mode of life is not congenial to their nature; they gene∣rally pine and degenerate in that state of capti∣vity;
<PB N="123" REF="139"/>
their feathers rumple and rot; their feet are hurt on the gravel; their bill shivers with frequent rubbing, all is spoiled and injured, be∣cause all is constrained; and Ducks thus raised can neither yield so good a down, nor propagate so strong a race as those which enjoy a part of their native liberty, and live in their proper ele∣ment. If the place does not naturally afford any current or sheet of water, a pond ought to be dug, in which the ducks may dabble, swim, wash, and dive, exercises absolutely necessary to their vigour, and even their health. The an∣cients, who bestowed more attention than we on the interesting objects of rural oeconomy, and of a country life, those Romans, who with the same hands held the plough <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gaudebat terra vomere laureato &amp; triumphali Aratore.</HI> Plin.</NOTE> and bore the laurels of victory, have on this head, as on many others, left us useful instructions.</P>

The water must not be infested with leeches, for these would fix on the feet of the ducklings, and occasion their death.

In all situa∣tions, whether on the banks of a stream or on the margin of stagnant water, baskets must be placed at intervals with covered tops, and con∣taining a commodious apartment that may invite these birds to nestle. The female lays every two days, and has ten, twelve, or fifteen eggs; she will even produce thirty or forty, if she be abundantly fed, and the eggs repeatedly removed. She is of an ardent nature, and the male is jealous. He usually appropriates two or three females, which he leads, protects, and fecundates. When the Drake is unprovided with these mistresses, his

Their natural voracity displays itself
<PB N="126" REF="142"/>
almost at their birth; young or old they are ne∣ver sated; they swallow whatever they meet with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>, whatever is offered; they crop grass, ga∣ther seeds, gobble insects, and catch small fish, their body plunged perpendicularly, and only their tail out of the water; they support them∣selves in this forced attitude more than half a minute, by continually striking with their feet.</P>
<P>They acquire in six months their full size, and all their colours. The Drake is distin∣guished by a small curl of feathers that rises on the rump <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus and Belon.</NOTE>: his head, too, is glossed with a rich emerald green, and his wing decorated with a brilliant spangle. On the middle of the neck there is a white half collar; the fine purple brown of the breast, and the colours on other parts of the body, are disposed in pleasing gra∣dations, and upon the whole form a beautiful plumage.</P>
<P>Yet we must observe, that these choice co∣lours never shew all their vivacity but in the males of the wild kind: they are always duller and more indistinct in the tame Ducks, as the shape is also heavier and less elegant; so that an eye a little accustomed may distinguish between them. In that kind of fowling where tame Ducks search the wild ones, and bring them within aim of the fowler, it is customary to pay the Ducker a price agreed on for each tame Duck killed by
<PB N="127" REF="143"/>
mistake. But the experienced fowler seldom errs, though the tame Ducks are chosen of the same colour with the wild ones: for not only are the tints more vivid in these, but their feathers are smoother and closer, their neck slenderer, their head finer, the lineaments more delicately traced, and all their motions display the ease, strength, and dignity, which freedom inspires. <Q>“When I viewed this picture from my sentry-box,”</Q> says M. Hebert, ingeniously, <Q>“I fancied a skil∣ful painter had delineated the wild Ducks, while the tame Ducks seemed the production of his scholars.”</Q> The young ones hatched in the house from wild Ducks' eggs, before they discover their fine colours, are already distin∣guished by their stature and their elegance of form. Nay, the difference is much more per∣ceptible when the wild Duck is brought to our table: its stomach is always rounded, whilst it forms a sensible angle in the tame Duck, which last is surcharged with fat, while the flesh of the former is delicate and juicy. Purveyors know them easily by the legs, of which the scales are finer, equal, and glossy; by the mem∣branes, which are thinner; by the nails, which are sharper and more shining; and by the thighs, which are more slender than in the tame Duck.</P>
<P>The male, in all the water-fowl with a broad bill and palmated feet, is always larger than the female <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon had before made this observation.</NOTE>; contrary to what obtains among the
<PB N="128" REF="144"/>
birds of prey. In the Ducks and teals also, the males are robed with the richest colours, while the females are only of an uniform brown or gray <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards makes this observation.</NOTE>; and this difference, which is very con∣stant in the wild kinds, remains impressed on the tame breeds, as far at least as the variations and alterations of colour, occasioned by crossing the wild and the tame, have permitted <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>It has been remarked, that in flocks of wild Ducks, there are some different from the rest, and which resemble the tame ones in the shape of their body and the colours of their plumage: this bas∣tard breed proceed from those which the inhabitants near marshes raise every year in great numbers, and of which they always leave a certain proportion on the marshes; their method of rearing them is equally simple and curious.</P>
<P><Q>"The females," says M. Baillon, “are set to hatch in the houses; every place agrees with them, for they are much attached to their eggs; they are allowed twenty-five a-piece: some eggs are also hatched by turkies and hens, and the young immediately distri∣buted” to the Ducks.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“On the morning after the birth, each inhabitant marks his own; one cuts the first nail of the right foot, another, the second, ano∣ther bores a hole in such a part of the skin of the foot, &amp;c. Every person retains his mark; it is perpetuated in his family, and known” by the whole village.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“As soon as the ducklings are marked, they are carried with their mothers to the marsh; there they rear themselves, and with∣out trouble; it is only necessary to drive away the ravenous birds, particularly the buzzards, which destroy many. There are per∣sons who thus put seven or eight hundred in the water every” year.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“At the end of May and later, the inhabitants assemble to take them again with nets; each knows his own; poulterers come from a distance to buy them: a certain number are always preserved in the marsh, both to serve in winter as a call to the wild ones, and to multiply the species in the spring following; each person habituates them to return to his house; they are attracted by” throwing barley to them, of which they are very fond.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Many of these desert during the rains of October and Novem∣ber, and mix with the wild ones which arrive at this season; they pair, and this union produces the bastards, which are distinguish∣able” both by their form and by their plumage...</Q></P>
<P><Q>“These bastards have usually their bill longer, their head and neck thicker than the wild ones, but slenderer than the tame;” they are usually stouter, as it happens when breeds are crossed...</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I have frequently seen Ducks perfectly white pass with flocks of wild ones; these are probably the deserters... It is not how∣ever impossible but this bird may assume the white colour in the north; yet I doubt this, because it is migratory: it might turn white during the winter, if it remain always, or for a great length of time... but it departs every year at the beginning of autumn, and advancing into the temperate regions, in proportion as the cold is felt, it flies from the cause which whitens other birds: the more severe the winter, the more numerous are their migrations. We saw white Ducks in 1765 and 1775, but they were only as” one among a thousand.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is possible that this colour may be the effect of degeneration, as in other animals; for I have seen several white Ducks that were impotent: the white females, more common than the males, are commonly smaller, weaker, and sometimes less prolific than the rest. I have had two barren Ducks in my court-yard, which were extremely white, and their eyes red.”</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="145"/>
In fact, like all the other tame birds, the Ducks have undergone the effects of domestica∣tion. The colours of their plumage have been diluted, and sometimes even entirely effaced or changed. Some are more or less white, brown, black or mixed; others have assumed ornaments foreign to the species; such as the crested breed; another, still more deformed by domestication, has its bill twisted and bent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<PB N="130" REF="146"/>
constitution is altered, and betrays all the marks of degeneracy; they are feeble, indolent, inclined to excessive fat, and the young delicate and difficult to raise. Frisch, who makes this observation, says also, that the white Ducks are constantly smaller and weaker than the other sorts. He adds, that when the breed is crossed between in∣dividuals of different colours, the young generally resemble the father in the tints of the head, back, and tail; which happens also in the mix∣ture of a foreign Drake with the common Duck. With respect to Belon's opinion, that the wild kind contains a greater and a smaller breed, I can find no proof of it; and most probably he was led into that notion by the comparison of indi∣viduals of different ages.</P>
<P>Not but the wild kind exhibits some varieties, merely accidental, or derived perhaps from their intercourse on the pools with the tame fort. In fact, Frisch observes, that both intermingle and pair; M. Hebert remarks, that he often found in the same flock of Ducks reared near great pools some young which resemble the wild, have a savage, independent instinct, and fly away in the autumn. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“In the last place, I remarked two of this sort in my court-yard, fed with others of the same age: I told the servants, and gave orders that they should clip the wings; they neglected to do this, and on a fine day they disappeared, after residing two months in this little court, where they wanted nothing, and where they could see neither the fields nor the horizon.”</Q> <HI>Sequel of the notes communicated by M.

<P>All of them, wild as well as tame, are subject to an almost sudden moulting, in which their great feathers drop in a few days, and often in a single night <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">According to M.

males after pairing, and to the females after hatching; it appears to be occasioned by the waste of strength in the amours, and in the lay∣ing and incubation. <Q>“I have often observed at the time of moulting," says M. Baillon, that they were restless for some days previous, and seemed to be tormented with great itch∣ings. They concealed themselves to cast their feathers. Next day and the following ones these birds were dispirited and bashful: they seemed conscious of their feebleness, dared not to spread their wings, and when pursued they seemed to have forgotten the use of them. This time of dejection lasted thirty days for the Ducks, and forty for the barnacles and geese. Their cheerfulness was restored with their feathers, and then they bathed much, and began to flutter. More than once I lost them for not having noticed the time when they essayed to fly: they disappeared during the night: I heard them attempting the mo∣ment before; but I avoided appearing, because they would all have taken flight.”</Q></P>
<P>The interior organization of the Ducks and geese exhibits some peculiarities. The <HI>trachea arteria,</HI> before it divides to enter the lungs, di∣lates

<P>The bill of the Duck, like that of the swan, and of the several kinds of geese, is broad, thick, in sented at the edges, clothed within with a sort of fleshy palate, filled with a thick tongue, and terminated at its point by a horny nail, of a harder substance than the rest of the bill. The tail in all these birds is very short, the legs placed much back, and almost concealed in the abdo∣men. From this position of the legs, proceeds the difficulty of walking and of keeping their equilibrium on land, which occasions aukward motions, a tottering step, a heavy air which passes for stupidity, whereas the facility of their evolutions in the water evinces the force, the delicacy, and even the subtlety of their in∣stinct <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“We had a very tame ferret, which, for its gentleness, was caressed by all our ladies; it was most of its time on their knees. One day when we were in the saloon, a servant entered, holding in his hand a tame Duck, which he let loose on the floor; the ferret immediately darted after the Duck, which no sooner per∣ceived it, than he squatted his whole length; the ferret fell upon him, and sought to bite his neck and head; in an instant the Duck stretched out his body, and feigned death; the ferret then smelled the bird from the head to the feet, and perceiving no signs of life, it left the body, and returned to us: the Duck now see∣ing his enemy retire, rose gently on his toes, seeking to get upon his feet; but the ferret, surprized at this resurrection, ran and threw him down, and did the same a third time. Several days in succession we amused ourselves by repeating this little spectacle; I cannot sufficiently express the sort of intelligence perceived in the conduct of the Duck; scarcely had he extended his head and his neck on the floor, and had got rid of the ferret, than he began to trail his head in such manner as to be able to examine the pro∣ceedings of his enemy; then he raised his head gently and repeat∣edly, took to his feet and fled swiftly; the ferret returned to the charge, and the Duck played again the same trick.”</Q> <HI>Extract of a letter written from Coulomiers, by M.

the fore side of the neck is mixed with some white feathers. Willughby says, that he saw one entirely white; yet as Belon has remarked, the fact is, that sometimes the male, as well as the female, is entirely white, or more or less variegated with white: and this change of the colours into white is pretty frequent in the do∣mesticated breeds. The character, however, that distinguishes the Musk Duck is a broad piece of naked skin, red, and sprinkled with <HI>papillae,</HI> which covers the cheeks, extends be∣hind the eyes, and swells on the root of the bill into a red caruncle, which Belon compares to a cherry. On the back of the head of the male hangs a bunch of feathers shaped like a crest; this is wanting in the female <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>, which is also rather smaller, and has not the tubercle on the bill.

<PB N="140" REF="159"/>
given occasion to its appellation in France, the <HI>Indian Duck.</HI> Yet we are uncertain from what country this bird was introduced among us, since it is not a native of the north <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE>, and the name of <HI>Muscovy Duck</HI> is erroneous.

<P>According to Piso, this large Duck fattens equally well, whether confined to our farm-yards, or permitted to enjoy freedom on the rivers. It is also recommended by its great fertility; the female lays many eggs, and can hatch at almost every time of the year <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; the male is very ardent

As it whistles on wing, and very frequently, it is often heard and discovered at a great distance. It flies usually in the evening, or even the night. It has a sprightlier air than the other ducks; it is very nimble, and perpetually in motion. It is smaller than the common duck, and nearly equal to the shoveler.

Baillon, the females are somewhat smaller than the males, and continue always gray <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“The female is clouded with cinereous, except the breast and the belly, which are white; it has no spot on the wings.”</Q> <HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI></P></NOTE>, and do not, like the females of the shovelers, assume, as they grow old, the colours of the males. This ob∣server, equally accurate and attentive, and at the same time very judicious, has communicated to us more facts relating to the water-fowls than are to be found in all the professed naturalists: he has discovered, from a series of observations, that the Wigeon, the pintail, the gadwall, and the shoveler, are hatched gray, and retain that colour till the month of February; so that, at first, the males cannot be distinguished from the females, but in the beginning of March their feathers colour, and nature bestows on them the powers and ornaments suited to the season of love; she afterwards disrobes them of their ap∣parel about the end of July: the males retain little or nothing of their handsome colours;

gray and dark feathers succeed to those with which they were decorated; their voice dies away and is lost like that of the females, and half the year all seem condemned to silence and insensibility.</P>
<P>It is in this dismal state that these birds com∣mence, in the month of November, their dis∣tant voyage, and many are caught in this first passage. It is then scarce possible to distinguish the old from the young, especially those of the pintails; the gray garb being more complete in that species than in others.</P>
<P>When all these birds return into the north, about the end of February or the beginning of March, they are decorated with their finest colours, and are incessantly heard to whistle or scream. The adults now pair, and none remain in our marshes but a few shovelers, which can be ob∣served to lay and hatch.</P>
<P>The Wigeons fly and swim always in bodies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld and Klein.</NOTE>. Every winter a few companies pass in most of our provinces, even those the most distant from the sea, such as Lorraine <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Observations of M.

Hebert.</HI></P></NOTE>; but they
<PB N="146" REF="166"/>
pass in much greater numbers on our coasts, particularly those of Picardy.</P>
<P><Q>"The north and north-east winds," says M. Baillon, “bring to us Wigeons in great flocks. They spread on our marshes, where one part of them spend the winter, another advances” farther south.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“These birds fly very well during the night, unless it is quite dark. They seek the same pasture as the wild ducks, and like these feed on the seeds of rushes and other herbs, insects, snails, frogs, and worms. The more violent the wind, the greater the number of these ducks that are seen roving. They keep at a good distance from the sea and the mouths of rivers, notwithstanding the rigour of the wea∣ther,” and they are very patient of cold.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“They retire regularly about the end of March with the south winds: none remain here: I think they advance to the north, hav∣ing never seen their eggs or nests. I may observe, however, that these birds are hatched gray, and that prior to the moulting there is no difference, with respect to plumage, between the males and the females: for often on their first arrival I found young ones almost gray, and only half covered with the feathers cha∣racteristic” of their sex.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"The Wigeon," adds M. Baillon, “is easily reconciled to domestication; it eats readily bread, and barley, and fattens when so fed;
<PB N="147" REF="167"/>
it requires much water, in which it incessantly frolics by night as by day. I have had them several times in my yard, and was always de∣lighted with their sprightliness.”</Q></P>
<P>The species of the Wigeon or whistling duck occurs in America as well as in Europe. We have received several specimens from Louisiana under the name of <HI>jensen duck</HI> and <HI>gray duck</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have received from Louisiana a duck which the French set∣tled in that country call the <HI>gray duck;</HI> it corresponds to the Euro∣pean duck which M. Brisson denominates <HI>the whistler duck.</HI> Be∣tween the gray duck of Louisiana and the whistler duck of Europe, there are some slight differences; yet not sufficient to discriminate their species: the gray duck is rather larger; it has along the neck on each side a greenish stripe wanting in the whistling duck of Eu∣rope: the plumage is the same in both, except a few strokes or shades which may vary in different individuals: but the form of the bill, its colour, the colour of the legs, the shape of the tail, which is pointed, the whole habit of body, and much the greatest part of the plumage, are similar in the gray duck of Louisiana, and in the whistling duck of Europe. I believe, therefore, that I may very safely refer them to the same species. <HI>Extract of the notes communi∣cated by Dr. Mauduit.</HI></NOTE>.

climate; yet we dare not pronounce whether the whistling duck and the <HI>vingeon</HI> be the same species. Our doubts with respect to this and other subjects would have been cleared up, had not the war, among other losses which it has occasioned to natural history, deprived us of a series of coloured drawings of St. Domingo birds, made on that island with the utmost care by the Chevalier Deshayes, correspondent of the king's cabinet. Fortunately a duplicate of the papers of that observer, as ingenious as he is laborious, have come into my hands: and we cannot do better than give an extract, but with∣out venturing to decide whether this bird is precisely the whistling duck.</P>
<P><Q>“The <HI>gingeon,</HI> which at Martinico is termed the <HI>vingeon,</HI> says the Chevalier Deshayes, is a particular kind of duck, which is not dis∣posed to make distant voyages like the wild duck, but usually limits its excursions to the passing from one pool or marsh to another, or to make depredations of some field of rice near their haunts. It sometimes perches on trees; but, as far as I could observe, this hap∣pened only in the rainy season, when its ordi∣nary retreat during the day was so deluged, that no aquatic plant appeared to conceal or shelter it, or when the extreme heat obliged it to seek the cool shade amidst the thick fo∣liage.”</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="149" REF="169"/>
“One might be tempted to take the <HI>vingeon</HI> for a nocturnal bird, for it is seldom seen in the day; but as soon as the sun is set, it rises from among the flags and reeds, and makes for the open sides of the pools, where it dabbles and pastures like other ducks. It would be difficult to say how it is employed through the day: we can hardly observe it without being perceived. But we may pre∣sume that, though it lurks among the reeds, it does not pass its time in slumber. We may draw this inference from tame <HI>vingeons,</HI> which, like other fowls, seek not to sleep in” the day-time, till after they are sated.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The <HI>gingeons</HI> fly in flocks like the ducks, even in the love season. This instinct, which prompts them to associate, seems to be pro∣duced by fear; and it is said, that like the geese, they always plant a sentinel, when en∣gaged in search of food. If the guard per∣ceives any motion, he gives notice by a parti∣cular cry, resembling a cadence or rather a hoarse bleating; instantly the <HI>gingeons</HI> desist from their gobbling, raise their heads, and look with a steady, earnest aspect: if the noise ceases, they resume their feeding; but if the signal is redoubled, and announces real danger, the alarm is communicated by a shrill, pierc∣ing cry, they all mount and follow the senti∣nel,” who first takes flight.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="150" REF="170"/>
“The <HI>gingeon</HI> is a noisy bird: when a flock is feeding, a continual murmuring is heard, like a low smothered laugh. This gabbling betrays them, and directs the fowler. Even when they fly, there is always some one of the body which whistles; and as soon as they have alighted on the water, their chuckling is re∣newed.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“They lay in January; and in March the young are seen. Their nests are nothing re∣markable, except that they contain many eggs. The negroes are very expert at finding these nests, and the eggs hatch well if placed under sitting hens. In this way tame <HI>gin∣geons</HI> are obtained; but it would be a world of difficulty to domesticate such as are taken a few days after their birth: for already they have contracted the wild, shy temper of their parents; while those hatched under hens re∣ceive a part of the social familiar disposition. The young <HI>gingeons</HI> have more agility and vivacity than ducklings: at first they are covered with a brown down; they grow very fast, and in six weeks they attain their full size, and the feathers of the wings begin to” sprout</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“One could not believe to what lengths the wild Wigeons carry the paternal affection. M. le Gardeur, lately member of the Chamber of Agriculture at St. Domingo, and who joins to a very accomplished mind much knowledge in Natural His∣tory, assured me, that he saw them dart with the utmost rancour, pecking a negro who sought to plunder their brood; they an∣noyed him so much as to retard the taking of the young, which in the mean time escaped and concealed themselves as much as was possible.”</Q> <HI>Sequel of the Memoir of the Chevalier Deshayes.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q><PB N="151" REF="171"/>
“Thus, with very little pains, we may pro∣cure tame <HI>gingeons;</HI> but, if we may judge from almost all that have, we can scarcely ex∣pect that they will multiply in the domestic state; yet I know some tame <HI>gingeons</HI> which” have laid, covered, and hatched.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It would be an extremely valuable acquisi∣tion to obtain a domestic breed of these birds; because their flesh is excellent, and especially that of such as have been tamed, not having the marsh taste of the wild ones. And ano∣ther reason for reducing this species to domes∣tication, would be the advantage in extin∣guishing, or at least of weakening, those in the wild state; for they often desolate our crops, and seldom do the fields of rice, near pools, escape their ravages. In such situations, the sportsman waits for them in the evening by moon-light: they are also caught with nooses,” and hooks baited with earth-worms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The <HI>gingeons</HI> feed not only upon rice, but on all other grain usually given to fowls; such as maize and different kinds of millet. They also crop grass, and catch small fish and” crabs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Their cry is a real whistle, which may be
<PB N="152" REF="172"/>
imitated-so exactly with the mouth, as to de∣coy the flocks when they pass. The sports∣men fail not to counterfeit this whistle, which runs rapidly over all the notes of the octave, from the base to the treble, resting on the last” note, which is prolonged.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The <HI>gingeon</HI> carries its tail low, and bent to the ground, like the pintado; but on enter∣ing the water, it raises its tail. Its back is higher and more arched than that of the duck: its legs are much longer in proportion: its eye is livelier, and its tread firmer: it has a better carriage, and holds its head high like the goose. These characters, together with its habit of perching upon trees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To this species we ought probably to refer the <HI>branch duck,</HI> which occurs in many narratives. <Q>“There are no less than twenty∣two kinds of ducks in Canada, of which the most beautiful and the best are called <HI>branch duck,</HI> because they perch on branches of trees; their plumage is variegated with much brilliancy.”</Q> <HI>Hist.

<P><Q>The <HI>gingcons,"</HI> M.

<PB N="153" REF="173"/>
grain which is thrown to them, or the pool in which they dabble. It must be owned, that the disposition of the <HI>gingeon</HI> is mischievous and quarrelsome; but as its force equals not its strength, we cannot but wish, though it should disturb the peace of the court-yard, to propagate in the domestic state this species of duck,” so superior in quality to all the rest.</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Wigeon, <HI>Anas Penelope:</HI> <Q>“Its tail is somewhat sharp; its vent black; its head brown; its front white; its back waved with cinereous.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>THIS whistling duck has a crest, and is as large as the wild duck; all its head is clothed with fine rufous feathers, delicate and silky, raised on the front and the crown of the head in a hairy tuft, resembling the

<P>IT is probable that this species, as well as the preceding ones, has received the name of <HI>Whistler</HI> from the whistling of its voice or of its
<PB N="155" REF="175"/>
wings. To the appellation given by Edwards of <HI>red-billed,</HI> we add the circumstance that it has <HI>yellow nostrils,</HI> to distinguish it from the forego∣ing species, whose bill is also red. This Whistler is tall, but not larger than a coot. Though it has not vivid or brilliant colours, it is a very beautiful bird of its kind: a chesnut brown spread on the back is clouded with flame-colour or deep orange; the lower part of the neck has the same tint, which melts into gray on the breast; the coverts of the wings are washed with rusty on the shoulders, next assume an ash hue, then a pure white; its quills are blackish brown, and the primaries are marked on the middle of their outer surface with white; the belly and tail are black; the head is covered with a rusty cap, which stretches with a long blackish track to the top of the neck; all the circumference of the face and neck is clothed with gray feathers.</P>
<P>This species is found in North America, ac∣cording to Brisson; yet we received it from Cayenne. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Anas Autumnalis:</HI> <Q>“It is gray; its wing-quills, its tail, and its belly, are black; there is a fulvous and white spangle on the wings.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>WE adopt the name given by Edwards, as more precise than any indication drawn from climate. The legs and neck appear pro∣portionally longer than in the other ducks: its bill is black or blackish; its plumage is brown, clouded with rusty waves; its neck is speckled with little white streaks; the front, and the sides of the head behind the eyes, are tinged with ru∣fous; and the black feathers on the top of the head recline like a crest.</P>
<P>According to Sir Hans Sloane, this duck, which is seen frequently in Jamaica, perches and makes a sort of whistling.

<P>THIS is not so large as the wild duck; its head is finely speckled or dotted with dark brown and white, and the blackish tint predo∣minates on the top of the head and the upper side of the neck; the breast is richly festooned or scaled, and the back and the flanks are all vermiculated with these two colours; on the wing there are three spots or bars, the one white, the other black, and the third of a fine reddish chesnut. M. Baillon has observed, that of all the ducks, the Gadwall preserves the longest the fine colours of its plumage, but at last, like the others, it assumes a gray garb after the love season. The cry of this duck resembles much that of the wild duck; nor is it more raucous or louder, though Gesner seems to have meant to characterize it by applying the epithet <HI>strepera;</HI> which has been adopted by ornithologists.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="179"/>
The Gadwall is as alert in diving as in swim∣ming, and it escapes a shot by plunging under water; it seems timorous, and flies little during the day; it lurks squatted among the rushes, and seeks not its food except early in the morning or in the evening, and even a good while after night has come on. They are then heard flying in company with the whistlers, and, like these, are caught by the decoy of tame ducks. <Q>“The Gadwalls," says M. Baillon, "arrive on our coasts of Picardy in the month of November, with the north-east winds; and when these winds blow some days, they pass on without halting. About the end of February, with the first south winds, they are seen repassing on their” return to the north.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The male is always larger and more beau∣tiful than the female; like the male pochards and whistlers, it has the under side of the tail black, which part of the plumage is in the” females constantly gray.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The females bear great resemblance in all these species; yet some practice will enable us to distinguish them. The female Gadwalls become of an intense rufous as they grow” old.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The bill of this bird is black; its legs are of a pale clay-yellow, with black membranes, and the under side of each joint of the toes is also black. The male measures twenty inches from the bill to the tail, and nineteen inches
<PB N="159" REF="180"/>
to the extremity of the nails; its alar extent is thirty inches. The female differs only fif∣teen” lines in all the dimensions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"I fed in my court several months," conti∣nues Baillon, “two Gadwalls, male and female: they would eat no grain, but subsisted on bran and soaked bread. I had also wild ducks which refused grain, and others which lived on barley from the first days of their confine∣ment. This difference, I imagine, is owing to the nature of the places where these birds were bred: those which come from the de∣sert marshes of the north must be unac∣quainted with barley and wheat, and therefore it is not surprising that they should reject such food: those, on the contrary, which were hatched in cultivated countries, are led in the night into the corn-fields by their parents; they are thus accustomed to live on grain, and readily recognize it in the farm-yard; while the others will often die of want, though the rest of the poultry, picking up the seeds before them, might instruct them in the use of this food.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Gadwall, <HI>Anas Strepera:</HI> <Q>“It has on its wing a speckle of rufous, of black, and of white.”</Q></NOTE></P>

It is rather smaller than the wild duck; its plumage is rich in colours, and seems to merit the epi∣thet <HI>very beautiful,</HI> which Ray bestows on it. The head and the upper half of the neck are of a fine green; the coverts of the wing, near the shoulder, are of a pale blue, the following are white, and the last form on the wing a bronze green spangle: the same colours mark, though more faintly, the wing of the female, which has besides only the dull colours of a

<PB N="161" REF="183"/>
white gray, and rusty, mailed and festooned with blackish; the breast and the under side of the neck of the male are white, and all the under sur∣face of the body is of a fine rufous; yet sometimes the belly is white. M. Baillon assures us, that the old Shovelers retain sometimes their beautiful co∣lours, and that tinged feathers grow at the same time with the gray, which cover them every year after the love season: and he observes justly, that this singularity of the Shovelers and gadwalls may mislead nomenclators with respect to the number of the species of these birds. He says also, that aged females, which he saw, had, like the males, colours on their wings, but that, during their first year, they were entirely gray. Their head retains always its colour. We shall here also give the excellent remarks which he has obligingly communicated on the Shoveler in particular.</P>
<P><Q>"The form of the bill of this beautiful bird," says M. Baillon, “denotes its manner of living; its two broad mandibles have edges fur∣nished with a sort of indenting or fringe, that allows only the dirt to escape, but holds the worms, the slender insects, and the crusta∣ceous animals, which it searches among the mud by the margin of water: it has no other food <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We must add flies, which it catches alertly as it flutters on the water; whence the name <HI>Anas Muscaria,</HI> which Gesner has given to it.</NOTE>. I have several times opened them at
<PB N="162" REF="184"/>
the end of winter and during frost; I found no herbage in their stomach, though the want of insects must have obliged them to recur to that species of food. They are found then near springs only: they grow very lean: they recruit again in the spring, by eating” frogs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Shoveler dabbles incessantly, chiefly in the morning and evening, and even very late at night: I think that it sees in the dusk. It is savage and gloomy: it can scarce be reconciled to domestication: it constantly rejects bread and grain. I had a great num∣ber, which died after having been long fed by cramming into the bill, without ever learning to eat by themselves. I have at present two in my garden, which I have fed in that way more than a fortnight. They are now living on bread and shrimps: they sleep almost the whole day, and lie squat by the box-borders: in the evening, they run about a great deal, and they bathe repeatedly in the night. It is a pity that so beautiful a bird has not the cheer∣fulness of the garganey or sheldrake, and cannot become an inhabitant of our court-yards.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Shovelers arrive in our districts about the month of February. They disperse in the marshes, and a part of them hatch there every year. I presume that the rest advance towards the south, because these birds become rare here
<PB N="163" REF="185"/>
after the first northerly winds that blow in March. Those which are bred in the coun∣try, depart about the month of September: it is very uncommon that any are seen in the winter, and I thence conjecture that they” avoid the approach of cold <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However, they are seen in Scania and Gothland, according to Linnaeus,</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“They nestle here in the same places with the summer teals; they choose, like these, large tufts of rushes in spots almost inaccessi∣ble, and they arrange their nest after the same fashion. The female lays ten or twelve eggs, of a somewhat pale rufous: she covers them twenty-eight or thirty days, as sportsmen have told me; but I am myself inclined to think, that the incubation lasts only twenty-four or twenty-five days, since these birds hold a middle rank between the ducks and” the garganeys, with respect to size.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The young are hatched with a gray spotted down, like the ducklings, and are extremely ugly. Their bill is then almost as broad as their body, whose weight seems to oppress them: they almost constantly rest on their breast. They run and swim as soon as they burst from the shell. Their parents lead them, and appear attached to them; they incessantly guard against the ravenous birds: on the least apprehension of danger, the family squat among the grass, and the parents throw them∣selves
<PB N="164" REF="186"/>
”into the water, and plunge over head.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The young Shovelers become first gray like the females: the first moulting gives them their fine feathers, but they turn bright not until the second.”</Q></P>
<P>With respect to the colour of the bill, obser∣vers are not agreed. Ray says, that it is quite black; Gesner, as cited by Aldrovandus, asserts, that the upper mandible is yellow; Aldrovandus makes it to be brown: all that we can infer is, that the colour of the bill varies from age or other circumstances.</P>
<P>Schwenckfeld compares the clapping of the Shoveler's wings to the clattering of castanets; and M. Hebert told us, that he could not better compare its cry, than to the creaking of a hand∣rattle, turned round with little shakes. It is likely that Schwenckfeld mistook its voice for the noise of its flight. The Shoveler is the best and most delicate of the ducks; it grows very fat in winter; its flesh is tender and juicy; this is said to be always red, though well dressed, and that the bird has hence received the name of <HI>rouge,</HI> particularly in Picardy, where many are killed in the long chain of marshes that extend from the vicinity of Soissons to the sea.</P>
<P>Brisson, following the other ornithologists, gives a variety of the Shoveler; but the only difference is, that its belly, instead of being chest∣nut rufous, is white.</P>

<P>THIS is excellent game, and a very beautiful bird.

<PB REF="189"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE PIN TAIL WIGEON.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="167" REF="190"/>
snowy-white; on the sides of the neck are two white bars like ribbands, which readily distin∣guish it, though at a distance. The proportions of its body are longer and more taper than in any other species of duck; the neck is remarkably long, and very slender; the head is small and chesnut-colour; the tail is black and white, and terminates in two narrow filaments, which might be compared to those of the swallow; it is not carried horizontally but half-cocked. Its flesh is in every respect preferable to that of the wild duck; it is not so black, and the thigh, which in the wild duck is commonly hard and tendinous, is as tender as the wing in the Pintail.</P>
<P><Q>"The Pintail," M. Hebert tells us, “is seen in Brie during both passages: it lives on the large pools: its cry is heard pretty far off, <HI>hi zouë zouë;</HI> the first syllable is a sharp whistle, the second a murmur, deeper, and less sono∣rous.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>"The Pintail," adds this excellent observer, “seems to form the shade between the ducks and the garganyes, and, in many respects, it approaches the latter: the distribution of its colours resembles more that in the garganey, and it has also the bill of that bird.”</Q></P>
<P>The female differs from the male as much as the wild duck differs from the drake. Like the male, it has its tail long and pointed, and might otherwise be confounded with the wild duck; but the length of its tail is sufficient alone to
<PB N="168" REF="191"/>
distinguish it from all the other ducks. The two filaments which project from the tail, have given occasion to the German name, <HI>pheasant∣duck,</HI> and the English, <HI>sea-pheasant,</HI> which are very improperly applied. The appellation of <HI>winter-duck,</HI> which it receives in the north, seems to prove that it bears the most intense cold; and, in fact, Linnaeus assures us that it is seen in Sweden in the depth of winter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fauna Suecica.</NOTE>.

<P>THIS Duck is very different from the pre∣ceding in its plumage, and has no resem∣blance to it, except in the long shafts that pro∣ject from its tail.</P>
<P>The coloured figure of Edwards represents those parts brown, which in the duck called <HI>Miclon</HI> are black in our <HI>Planches Enluminées;</HI> yet we may perceive that both these birds are the same, by the two long shafts which project from the tail, and by the fine disposition of the colours: white covers the head and the neck as far as the top of the breast and back; there is only a band of orange fulvous, which descends from the eyes on both sides of the neck; the belly, and also two bunches of long, narrow fea∣thers, lying between the back and the wing, are of the same white with the head and the neck; the rest of the plumage is black as well as the bill; the legs are of a blackish red, and a small edging of membrane may be observed running
<PB N="170" REF="193"/>
along the margin of the inner toe, and below the little hind-toe: the length of the two shafts of the tail increases the total bulk of this duck; yet it is scarce equal to a common duck.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards suspects, with every probability, that his <HI>long-tailed duck from Hudson's Bay</HI> is the female of this.

<P>WE are convinced that the <HI>fox-goose</HI> of the ancients (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>vulpanser)</HI> is the same with the Sheldrake. Belon has hesitated and even varied about the application of these names: in <HI>his observations,</HI> he refers them to the goosander, and in his book <HI>of the nature of birds,</HI> he appropriates them to the barnacle. But we may easily ascertain, from one of those natural properties which are more decisive than all the conjectures of erudition, that these names apply solely to the Sheldrake; for it is the only bird which resembles the fox in a singular cir∣cumstance, that of lodging in a hole: it usually invades and possesses itself of the rabbits' bur∣rows, and there it lays and breeds.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="196"/>
Aelian ascribes also to the <HI>vulpanser</HI> the in∣stinct of presenting itself, like the partridge, be∣fore the feet of the sportsman, to avert the dan∣ger from its young. This was the general opinion of the ancients; since the Egyptians, who ranked this bird among the sacred animals, figured it, in their hieroglyphics, as the emblem of the generous tenderness of a mother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Pieri, in Orum, <HI>lib.</HI> xx.</NOTE>. In fact, it will be seen from our observations, that the Sheldrake exhibits precisely the same marks of maternal affection.</P>
<P>The appellations bestowed on this bird in the north, that of <HI>fox-goose,</HI> or rather <HI>fox-duck</HI> in Germany, that of <HI>mountain-duck</HI> in Saxony, and that of <HI>burrow-duck</HI> in England, mark, equally with the ancient names, its singular habit of living in burrows the whole time of its incuba∣tion. These appellations are even more accu∣rate; since the Sheldrake belongs to the genus of ducks, not to that of geese. It is rather larger than the common duck, and its legs are somewhat taller; but in other respects, in its figure, its port, and its structure, it preserves the resemblance. It differs from the duck, only because its bill is more raised, and the colours of its plumage more vivid and beautiful, and appear more brilliant at a distance. Its fine plumage is broken into large spaces of three colours, white, black, and cinnamon-yellow;
<PB N="173" REF="197"/>

Every spring, some flocks arrive on those of Picardy, where one of
<PB N="175" REF="199"/>
our best correspondents, M. Baillon, has studied the natural habits of these birds, and made the following observations; which we are happy to publish.</P>
<P><Q>"The spring," says M. Baillon, “brings to us the Sheldrakes, but always in small num∣ber. As soon as they arrive, they spread among the sand plains near the sea: each pair wanders among the warrens, which are there interspersed, and seek a burrow among those of the rabbits. They seem very nice in choosing this sort of lodgement, for they enter an hundred before they find one to suit them. It is remarked, that they never fix on a bur∣row but such as sinks more than a fathom and a half deep, and runs with an ascent into ridges or hillocks, its mouth opening to the south, and visible from the top of some dis∣tant” sand-bank.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The rabbits give place to these new guests,” and enter no more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Sheldrakes make no nest in these holes. The female lays her first eggs on the naked sand, and after she has extruded her comple∣ment, which is ten or twelve for young birds, and twelve or fourteen for old ones, she wraps them in a very thin down, which she plucks from her own body.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“During the whole time of incubation, which is thirty days, the male remains con∣stantly on the sand-bank, and only leaves it
<PB N="176" REF="200"/>
twice or thrice a-day, to procure subsistence on the sea. In the morning and evening, the female quits her eggs, to provide also for her wants: then the male enters. the burrow, especially in the morning; and on the female's” arrival, he returns to his sand bank.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“If in the spring we see a Sheldrake thus on watch, we may be sure to find the nest; we have only to wait till the hour when it goes into the burrow. But if it perceive itself to be discovered, it flies away in the opposite direction, and expects its female at sea. In their-return they hover long over the warren,” till the danger is removed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The day after the young are hatched, the parents conduct them to the sea, and usually adjust matters so that they arrive when the tide is full. By this management, their pro∣geny sooner reach the water; and from that moment they appear no more on land. It is difficult to conceive how these birds can, the first days after their birth, preserve themselves in an element, whose furious waves so often” destroy the adults of all kinds.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“If a fowler meet the little family on their journey, the parents fly away: the mother, however, affects to reel and fall an hundred paces off; she trails on her belly and strikes the earth with her wings, and by this trick she draws the fowler after her. The brood remain motionless till the return of the pa∣rents,
<PB N="177" REF="201"/>
and if a person lights on them, he may” take them all; nor will any try to escape.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I have witnessed all these facts: I have fre∣quently taken, and seen taken, the eggs from the Sheldrake's nest. We dug in the sand, following the burrow to its end: there we found the mother sitting on her eggs; we car∣ried them, with their downy coat, in a thick woollen cloth, and set them under a duck. The adopted mother rears the foreign brood with much care, provided none of her own eggs are left with her. The young Sheldrakes have at first their back white and black, and their belly very white. But they soon lose this livery, and become gray: then the bill and the legs are blue; about the month of Sep∣tember they begin to assume their beautiful feathers; but it is not before the second year that their colours gain all their lustre.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I have reason to think, that the male is not completely grown and fit for propagating before this second year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“The life of the Sheldrake, which is pretty long▪ seems to confirm the conjecture concerning its slow growth: last winter I had one that died eleven years old; it would have lived longer, but it became very mischievous, and domineered over all the inha∣bitants of the court-yard, except a musk duck, stronger than itself, with which it fought incessantly: we thought to preserve the weaker by shutting it up; but it died a short time after, ra∣ther from the languor of its confinement than from old age.”</Q> <HI>Note of M. Baillon.</HI></P></NOTE>; for it is not till then that the blood-coloured tubercle ap∣pears,
<PB N="178" REF="202"/>
which decorates their bill in the sea∣son of love, and at other times is obliterated: this new sort of production seems to have” some sympathy with the parts of generation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The wild Sheldrake lives on sea-worms, on sand-hoppers innumerable, and, no doubt, on fish-fry, and on little shell-fish, which are thrown up by the waves, and float on the froth. The raised form of its bill gives it great ad∣vantage in gathering these different substances, by skimming, so to say, the surface of the” water, much more lightly than the duck.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The young Sheldrakes reared under a duck are soon reconciled to the domestic state, and live in court-yards like the ducks. They are fed with crumbs of bread and with grain. The wild Sheldrakes are never seen assembled in flocks, like the ducks, the teals, and the wi∣geons. The male and female never part; they are observed constantly together, either on the sea or the sands: they rest satisfied with each other's company; and in pairing they seem to tie an indissoluble knot <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“Domestication, which softens the natural disposition, at the same time corrupts it: I saw in my court-yard a male Sheldrake pair two years successively with a light-coloured duck, and yet be∣stow always the same caresses on his own female; he was then six year old. This intercourse produced hybrids, which had nothing of the Sheldrake but the cry, the bill, and the legs; their colours were those of the duck; the only difference was, that a yellow tint appeared under the tail. I have kept three years a female of these hybrids; it has never listened to the addresses either of the drakes or of the Sheldrakes.”</Q> <HI>Note of M. Baillon.</HI></P></NOTE>. The
<PB N="179" REF="203"/>
male appears prone to jealousy; and yet, not∣withstanding the ardour of these birds in love, I have never been able to obtain one hatch from any female: one alone laid a few eggs by chance, and they were addle. They are com∣monly of a very light flaxen colour, without any spots; they are as large as ducks eggs,” but rounder.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Sheldrake is subject to a singular disor∣der: the lustre of its feathers tarnishes, they become dirty and oily, and the bird dies, after languishing near a month. Being curious to learn the cause of this malady, I opened seve∣ral, and found the blood melted down, and the principal bowels choaked with a reddish lymph, viscous and foetid. I attribute the dis∣ease to the want of sea-salt, which I believe to be necessary to these birds, at least from time to time, to divide by its points the red particles of the blood, and to preserve the union with the <HI>serum,</HI> by dissolving the vis∣cous humours, whch the seeds that support them in the court-yards accumulate in the intestines.”</Q></P>
<P>These observations, detailed by M. Baillon, leave very little to be added to the history of the Sheldrakes. We reared a pair of them under our eyes; they seemed not to have a wild dispo∣sition; they readily allowed themselves to be caught; they were kept in a garden, where they had liberty during the day; and when they were
<PB N="180" REF="204"/>
taken and held in the hand, they made scarce any efforts to escape: they ate bread, bran, corn, and even the leaves of plants and shrubs; their ordinary cry was much like that of a duck, but was less extended and much less frequent, for they were very seldom heard: they had also a second cry, <HI>uute, uute,</HI> which they utter when caught suddenly, and which seemed to be only the expression of fear: they bathed very often, especially in mild weather, and before rain; they swam rocking on the water, and when they reached the land, they stood on their feet, clapt their wings, and shook themselves like ducks; they also frequently preened their plumage with the bill. Thus the Sheldrakes, which resemble much the ducks in the shape of their body, re∣semble them also by their natural habits, only they are nimbler in their motions, and discover more cheerfulness and vivacity: they have be∣sides over all the ducks, even the most beauti∣ful, a privilege of nature, which belongs to them alone; that is, they retain constantly, and at all seasons, the charming colours of their plumage. As they are not difficult to tame, and as their rich garb is conspicuous at a distance, and has a very fine effect on pieces of water, it is to be wished that we could obtain a domestic breed of these birds: but their temper and constitution seem to fix them on the sea, and to repel them from fresh pools; the experiment could there∣fore
<PB N="181" REF="205"/>
be made only on lands situated very near salt water. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Sheldrake, <HI>Anas Tadorna:</HI> <Q>“Its bill is flat; its front compressed; its head greenish-black; its body variegated with white.”</Q> These birds remain in England the whole year: they lay fifteen or sixteen eggs, which are white and roundish: their flesh is very rank.—Mr. Pennant writes the name <HI>Shieldrake;</HI> and perhaps the form of its bill might suggest a <HI>shield.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>THE Pochard is stiled by Belon <HI>the rufous∣headed duck.</HI> In fact, its head, and part of its neck, is of a rufous brown, or chesnut; that colour cut round at the bottom of the neck, is succeeded by black or blackish brown, which is likewise cut round on the breast and the top of
<PB N="182" REF="206"/>
the back: the wing is gray, tinged with blackish, and without any spangle; but the back and the sides are prettily worked with a very fine fringe, which runs transversely in little black zigzags on a ground of pearl-gray. According to Schwenckfeld, the head of the female is not ru∣fous like that of the male, and has only some rusty spots.</P>
<P>The Pochard is as large as the sheldrake, but is more unwieldy; its round shape gives it a heavy air; it walks with difficulty and ungracefully, and is obliged from time to time to flap its wings, in order to preserve its equilibrium on land.</P>
<P>Its cry resembles more the hollow hiss of a large serpent than the voice of a bird. Its bill, broad and scooped, is very proper for dabbling in the mud, like the shovelers and the morillons, to search for worms, small fish, and crustaceous ani∣mals. Two male Pochards, which M. Baillon kept a winter in his court-yard, remained almost constantly in the water; they were very strong and courageous on that element, and would suf∣fer none of the other ducks to approach them, but drove them away with their bill. These, however, in their turn, beat them when they came on land, and the Pochards could then make no defence, but escaped to the water. Though they were tame, and even grown familiar, they could not be long preserved, because they could not walk without hurting their feet; the gravel of the garden-walks were as pernicious as the pave∣ment
<PB N="183" REF="207"/>
of the court; and, notwithstanding the care which M. Baillon took of these two Pochards, they lived not more than six weeks in their captivity.</P>
<P><Q>"I believe," says this good observer, “that these birds belong to the north. Mine conti∣nued in the water during the night, even when the frost was intense; they also agitated it, to prevent its freezing round them.”</Q></P>
<P>The Pochards, he adds, as well as the shovelers and the golden-eyes, eat much, and digest as quickly as the duck. They lived at first only on soaked bread, afterwards they ate dry, but swallowed it in that state with difficulty. I could never habituate them to grain. The shovelers alone seem fond of the seeds of the bulrush.</P>
<P>M. Hebert, who, as an attentive and even ingenious sportsman, has found other pleasures in fowling than that of killing, has made on these birds, as on many others, interesting obser∣vations. <Q>"It is the species of the Pochard," says he, “which, next to that of the wild duck, appears to me the most numerous in the coun∣tries where I have gone a-fowling. They ar∣rive with us in Brie about the end of Octo∣ber, in flocks from twenty to forty. Their flight is more rapid than that of the duck, and the noise made by their wings is quite different. The troop forms a close body in the air, but not disposed like the wild ducks in triangles. On their arrival, they are rest∣less;
<PB N="184" REF="208"/>
they alight on the large pools, and, the instant after, they rise, make several wheels in the air; a second time they alight, but their stay is equally short; they disappear, and re∣turn in an hour, and yet do not settle. When I killed one, it was always by chance, and with very coarse shot, and when they whirled in the air. They were all remarkable for a large rufous head, whence they are called” <HI>rougeot</HI> in Burgundy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is not easy to get near them on the large pools; they alight not on the brooks in frosty weather, nor on the little pools in autumn; and many of them cannot be killed, except on the <HI>duckeries</HI> of Picardy. However, they are pretty common in Burgundy, and at Dijon they are seen in the cooks shops almost the whole year. I killed one in Brie in the month of July, when the weather was ex∣tremely hot: it flushed at the side of a pool, in the middle of a wood, and in a very soli∣tary spot: it was attended by another, which made me think that they were paired, and that some couples of this species breed in France on the large marshes.”</Q></P>
<P>We shall add, that this species has penetrated into distant countries, for we received from Louisiana a Pochard exactly like what is found in France; and besides the same bird may be re∣cognized in the <HI>quapacheanauhtli</HI> of Fernandez, which Brisson has, for that reason, called the

<P>THIS beautiful bird, for our knowledge of which we are indebted to M.

<P>THE Golden Eye is a little duck whose plu∣mage is black and white, and its head re∣markable for two white spots placed at the cor∣ners
<PB N="187" REF="211"/>
of the bill, which at a distance appear like two eyes, situated near the other two, in the black hood glossed with green, which covers the head and the top of the neck. Hence the Ita∣lian name <HI>Quattr'Occhi,</HI> or <HI>four eyes.</HI> The En∣glish have termed it <HI>Golden Eye,</HI> because its iris is of a golden-yellow. Its tail and back are black, as well as the great quills of the wing, of which most of the coverts are white: the lower part of the neck, with all the fore side of the body, is of a fine white: the legs are very short, and the membranes which connect the toes extend to the tips of the nails, and are there fastened.</P>
<P>The female is rather smaller than the male, and differs entirely in its colours, which, as ge∣nerally observed in all the ducks, are duller and paler in the females: those of the female Golden Eye are gray or brownish, which in the male are black; and those white gray, which in the other are of a fine white: nor has she the green reflection on the head, or the white spot at the corner of the bill <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The flight of the Golden Eye, though pretty low, is very stiff, and makes the air to whistle <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>.
<PB N="188" REF="212"/>
It does not scream in taking wing, and seems not so shy as the other ducks. Small flocks of Golden Eyes are seen on our pools during the whole winter; but they disappear in the spring, and no doubt go to nestle in the north; at least, Linnaeus says, in the <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> that this duck is seen in summer in Sweden, and in that season, which is also that of breeding, it lives in the hollows of trees.</P>
<P>M. Baillon, who tried to keep some Golden Eyes in the domestic state, has just communi∣cated the following observations.</P>
<P><Q>"These birds," says he, “lost much flesh in a short time, and hurt themselves under the feet when I allowed them to walk at liberty. They lay for the most part on their belly; but if other birds attacked them, they made a stout defence: I can even say, that I have seen few birds so rancorous. Two males which I had last winter, tore my hand with their bill, as often as I laid hold of them. I kept them in a large ozier cage, that they might be habitu∣ated to captivity, and might see the other fowls rambling about the court. But they betrayed in their prison only the marks of impatience and rage, and darted against the bars at the other birds which approached. I succeeded, with much difficulty, in teaching them to eat bread, but they constantly refused” every sort of grain.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="189" REF="213"/>
"The Golden Eye," adds this attentive ob∣server, “like the pochard and the morillon, walks under constraint and difficulty, with effort, and seeming pain. Yet these birds come from time to time on shore, but only to remain there in tranquillity and repose, standing or lying on the strand, and to enjoy a pleasure which is peculiar to themselves. Land-birds feel the necessity of bathing at inrervals, whe∣ther to clean their plumage of the dust which insinuates into it, or to give dilatation to their body, which facilitates their motions; and they announce, by their chearfulness on quitting the water, the agreeable sensation which they feel. In the aquatic birds, on the contrary, in those which remain long in the water, their feathers become through time penetrated and mois∣tened, and permit the humidity to steal insensi∣bly to the skin: then they have occasion for an air bath to dry and contract their relaxed limbs; they come, for this purpose, on shore, and the sprightliness of their eyes, and the slow balancing of their head, express their agreeable sensation. But the Golden Eyes, and likewise the pochards and the morillons, are satisfied with that gratifi∣cation; they never willingly come to land, and especially avoid walking on it, which seems to cause extreme fatigue: in fact, accustomed as they are to move in the water by short darts, produced by the brisk and sudden motion of
<PB N="190" REF="214"/>
their feet, they bring this habit with them on land, and walk by springs, striking the ground so forcibly with their broad feet, that their pace is attended with the same noise as the clapping of hands; they use their wings to preserve the equilibrium, which they lose every minute; and if they be hastened, they make a bound, throwing their legs back, and fall on their breast: their feet also are torn and cut in a short time by rubbing on the gravel. It appears, therefore, that these birds, destined solely for the water, can never augment the colonies planted in our court-yards.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Golden Eye, <HI>Anas Clangula:</HI> <Q>“It is variegated with black and white; its head violet and swelled; a black spot on the corner of the mouth.”</Q> Linnaeus says, that it dives excellently for fish and shell-fish, that it eats frogs voraciously, that it often builds its nest in trees with grass, and lays from seven to ten white eggs, and that its flesh is agreeable.—This bird visits the meres of Shropshire in winter.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE Morillon is a handsome little duck, which, when seen at rest, exhibits these colours; a broad blue bill, a large black <HI>domino,</HI> a mantle of the same, and white on the stomach, the belly, and the top of the shoulders: this white is free and unadulterated, and all the black is shining, and heightened with fine purple and greenish-red reflections; the feathers on the back of the head rise into a bunch: often the lower part of the black domino on the breast is waved with white: and, in this species, as in others of the genus of ducks, the colours are liable to certain variations, but which are only indivi∣dual <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the Morillon flies, its wing appears striped with white: this effect is produced by seven feathers, which are partly of that colour <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>.

<P>M. Baillon has communicated his observations on this species in the state of domestication. <Q>"The colour of the Morillon," he says, “its manner of balancing its head as it walks, and of holding its head almost erect, give it an air the more singular, as the beautiful light-blue of its bill, applied always on its breast, and its large brilliant eyes, are strongly contrasted with” the black of its plumage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is pretty chearful, and dabbles like the duck whole hours. I easily tamed several in

my court: they became so tame in a short time, that they entered the kitchen and the rooms: they were heard before they could be seen, because of the noise made at each step, clapping their broad feet on the ground and the floor. They were never seen to take any unnecessary perambulations; which proves what I have before said, that this species walks only when urged by its wants. Their feet were indeed soon peeled on pavement; yet they grew lean very slowly, and might have lived a long time, had not the other fowls tormented” them.</Q></P>

<P>AFTER what we have said of the diversity that prevails in the plumage of the Moril∣lons, we are much inclined to refer to the same accidental causes the difference of bulk which has made the little Morillon be reckoned a dis∣tinct and separate species.

<PB N="195" REF="220"/>
our doubts, which we believe to be not ill-found∣ed. Belon even, whom the rest have followed, and who was the first author of this distinction, seems to furnish a proof against his own opi∣nion: <Q>for after having said of his <HI>little diver,</HI> which is our little Morillon, that “it is an hand∣some tight bird, round and short, its eyes so yellow and shining, that they are brighter than polished iron,”</Q> and that with a plumage similar to that of the Morillon, it has likewise a white line across the wing; <Q>he adds, “that it is far from being a true Morillon, for it has a tuft on the back of the head like the goosander and the pelican, while the Morillon has none.”</Q> But Belon is here mistaken, and this character of the tuft is another reason that this bird should be classed with the true Morillon.</P>

We have sufficiently refuted these fables, with which natural history is here, as in other parts, too much tinctured. The Scoters lay, nestle, and hatch, like other birds. They prefer for their habitation the most north∣ern countries, whence they descend in great numbers along the coasts of Scotland and Eng∣land, and arrive on the coasts of France in win∣ter, to afford a very indifferent sort of game, but which is eagerly expected by our monks and nuns, who, being entirely denied the use of flesh, and restricted to fish, are indulged with these birds, from a notion that their blood is as cold as that of fish: but in fact their blood is just as warm as that of other aquatic birds; though
<PB REF="222"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE SCOTER DUCK.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="197" REF="223"/>
indeed the black, dry, and hard flesh of the Scoter may be deemed a diet of mortification.</P>
<P>The plumage of the Scoter is black: it is nearly as large as the common duck, but it is shorter and more compact. Ray observes, that the tip of the upper mandible is not terminated by a horny nail, as in all the other species of this genus: in the male, the base of that part, near the head, is considerably swelled, and exhibits two tubercles of a yellow colour; the eye-lids are of the same colour; the toes are very long, and the tongue is very large; the <HI>trachea</HI> has no labyrinth, and the <HI>caeca</HI> are very short in comparison of those of the other ducks.</P>
<P>M. Baillon, that intelligent and laborious ob∣server, whom I have so often had occasion to cite on the subject of water-fowl, has sent me the following observations:</P>
<P><Q>“The north and north-west winds bring along our coasts of Picardy, from the month of November to that of March, prodigious flocks of Scoters: the sea, so to speak, is co∣vered with them. They are seen flying in∣cessantly from place to place, and by thou∣sands: they appear and disappear on the wa∣ter every minute: as soon as a Scoter dives, the whole troop imitates it, and emerges again a few moments after. When the south and south-east winds blow, about the month of March, they are driven from our coasts, and” entirely disappear.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="198" REF="224"/>
“The favourite food of the Scoters is a kind of bivalve shell, smooth and whitish, four lines broad and about ten long, which are found clustered in many deep shoals: there are pretty extensive banks of them, which are left bare by the ebb tide. When the fisher∣men remark that the Scoters dive for the <HI>vaineaus</HI> (the term which they apply to these shells) they spread their nets horizontally but very loose, above these shell-fish, and two or three feet at most from the sand; a few hours after, the tide flowing in covers the nets, and the Scoters following the reflux two or three hundred paces from the beach, the first that perceives a <HI>vaineau</HI> dives, and all the rest, co∣pying the example, entangle themselves among the floating meshes, or if some, more shy, go a little aside and pass under the nets, they rise after having fed, and soon inwrap themselves like the rest: they are all drowned, and when the sea has retreated, the fishermen go to dis∣engage them from the nets, on which they are suspended by the head, the wings, or the” feet.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I have several times seen this sort of fish∣ing: a net of an hundred yards long and three yards broad caught sometimes twenty or thirty dozen in a single tide; but to balance this good fortune, the nets are often streched twenty times without catching one; and at
<PB N="199" REF="225"/>
times they are carried away or rent by por∣poises” or sturgeons.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I never saw any Scoters fly any where but above the sea, and I have always remarked that their flight was low and gentle, and of small compass: they scarce ever rise, and while on wing their feet often drag in the water. It is probable that the Scoters are as prolific as the ducks, for the number which arrives every year is prodigious; and notwith∣standing the multitudes that are caught, they seem not to diminish.”</Q></P>
<P>Having enquired of M. Baillon his opinion with regard to the distinction between the male and female of this species, and to the gray Scoters or <HI>grisettes,</HI> which some have said to be females; he gave me this answer:</P>
<P><Q>“The <HI>grisette</HI> is certainly a Scoter, and has exactly the figure. These <HI>grisettes</HI> are always seen in company with the other Scoters; they feed on the same shell-fish, swallow them en∣tire, and digest them in the same manner. They are caught in the same nets, and they fly as badly and in the same way, and this is peculiar to these birds, which have the bones of the wings more turned backwards than the ducks, and the cavities, in which the two thigh-bones are sunk, very near each other; a structure which gives them great facility in swimming, and makes them at the same time very aukward in walking: and surely no spe∣cies
<PB N="200" REF="226"/>
of ducks has the thighs placed in this manner. Lastly, the taste of their flesh is the” same.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I opened three of these <HI>grisettes</HI> in winter,” and they were found to be females.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“On the other hand, the number of gray Sco∣ters is much inferior to that of the black; often not ten occur among an hundred of the others, caught in the same net. How could” the females be so few in this species?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I freely own that I have not sought suffi∣ciently to distinguish the males from the fe∣males. I stuffed a great number; I chose the blackest and the largest, and they were all found to be males, except the <HI>grisettes.</HI> I be∣lieve, however, that the females are somewhat smaller, and not so black, or at least they have not that velvet surface which makes the black of the male plumage so deep.”</Q></P>
<P>It appears to us from this detail, that as the female Scoters are not quite so black as the males, and more inclined to gray, the <HI>grisettes,</HI> or the Scoters which verge on gray, are too few to re∣present all the females of the species, and are in fact the younger females, which require time to assume all the black of their plumage.</P>
<P>After this first answer, M. Baillon sent us also the following notes, which are all interesting. <Q>"I have had," says he, “this year, 1781, for several months in my court, a black Scoter.
<PB N="201" REF="227"/>
I fed it with soaked bread and shell-fish. It” was become very familiar.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I believed till then that the Scoters could not walk, and that their conformation deprived them of that power. I was the more per∣suaded, as I had several times, in storms, ga∣thered, on the sea-shore, Scoters, penguins, and puffins alive, which could drag themselves along only by help of their wings. But these birds had, no doubt, been much beaten by the waves; and that circumstance, which I had overlooked, confirmed me in my error. I was surprized to remark, that the Scoter walks well, and faster even than the pochard; it balances itself in the same manner at each step, holding its body almost erect, and strik∣ing the ground with each foot alternately and with force; its pace is slow; if pressed, it tumbles, because the efforts which it makes destroys its equilibrium: it is indefatigable in the water; it runs on the waves like a petrel, and as nimbly; but, on land, the celerity of its motions are of no avail; mine seemed” quite out of its natural element.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Indeed, it had a very aukward air; each movement gave its body fatiguing jogs; it walked only from necessity: it usually lay down or stood straight like a stake, its bill leaning on its stomach: it always seemed to be melancholy: I never once saw it bathe joyous, like the other water-fowls, with which
<PB N="202" REF="228"/>
my court is filled; it never entered the shal∣low trough which is placed level with the surface of the ground, but to eat the bread which I threw to it: when it had eaten and drank it remained motionless; sometimes it dived to the bottom, to gather the crumbs which fell down; if any bird came into the wa∣ter and approached it, the Scoter endeavoured to drive away the intruder; if this made any opposition or resistance, it dived, and after making two or three turns at the bottom of the trough, it flew out of the water, making a sort of whistling, very soft and clear, like the first tone of a German flute: this is the only cry I ever knew it make, which it repeated as” often as a person approached it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Being desirous to know if the bird could continue long under water, I held it down by force; it made considerable efforts after two or three minutes, and seemed to suffer much; it bounded up as quick as a cork. I believe it could remain longer, because it descends often to the depth of thirty feet in the sea to” gather the oblong bivalves on which it feeds.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“These shell-fish are whitish, four or five lines broad, and near an inch long. It does not amuse itself like the sea-pie in opening them, the shape of its bill not being, as in that bird, adapted for the purpose: it swallows them whole, and digests them in a few hours. I gave sometimes more than twenty to a single
<PB N="203" REF="229"/>
Scoter; and it received them till its <HI>oesophagus</HI> was filled up to the bill: then its excrements were white. They assumed a green tinge when the bird was fed with bread, but were always liquid. I never saw it eat herbs or the seeds of plants, like the wild ducks, the teals, the wigeons, and others of this genus: the sea is its only element. It flies as ill as it walks: I have often amused myself in viewing thro' a spy-glass the numerous flocks on the sea; I never saw them rise and fly to any distance; they fluttered incessantly above the surface of” the water.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The feathers of this bird are so smooth and close, that the bird, on coming out of the wa∣ter,” can shake itself dry.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The same cause which proved fatal to so many other birds in my court, occasioned also the death of my Scoter. The soft and tender skin of its feet were perpetually bruised by the gravel; a <HI>callus</HI> formed on each joint of the toes; in time they were worn to such a de∣gree, that the nerves were disclosed; it durst no longer walk, or go to the water, each step increasing its wounds: I put it in my garden on the grass under a cage, but it would not eat; and it died in my court a few days after.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Scoter or Black Diver, <HI>Anas Nigra:</HI> "Its body is entirely black."

<P>AMONG the great number of Scoters which come in winter on the coasts of Picardy, some are remarked much larger than the rest, and therefore called the <HI>Double Scoters.</HI> Besides this difference of size, they have a white spot on the side of the eye, and a white bar on the wing; while the plumage of the others is entirely black.

with little blackish lines on a gray ground, and are prettily striped at the tips with black and white, of which the streaks are dis∣played alternately, and seem to vary according to the motion of the bird: the under side of the body is pearly white-gray; a small white collar rises into a chin-piece below the bill, and sends off a scallop below the eye, on which another long streak of the same colour passes like a long eye-lid; the upper side of the head is decorated with a superb tuft of long feathers, white, green, and violet, which fall back like hair, in bunches parted by smaller white bunches.

<P>WE prefer the appellation of <HI>Gray-headed Duck,</HI> given by Edwards, to that of <HI>Hud∣son's Bay Duck,</HI> employed by Brisson: in the first place, because there are many other Ducks in Hudson's Bay; and in the second place, because an epithet founded on a specific character is al∣ways preferable to one drawn from the country. This gray-headed Duck is hooded remarkably with a blueish cinereous cowl, falling in a square piece on the top of the neck, and parted by a double line of black points, like inverted com∣mas, and by two plates of pale green which cover the cheeks: the whole is intersected by five black mustachoes, three of which project to a point on the top of the bill, and two others ex∣tend behind under the corners: the throat, the breast, and the neck, are white; the back is blackish brown, with a purple reflection; the great quills of the wing are brown; the coverts are purple or deep violet, shining, and each fea∣ther terminated by a white point, of which the series forms a transverse line: there is also a
<PB N="214" REF="240"/>
large white spot on the small coverts of the wing, and another of a round form on each side of the tail; the belly is black; the bill is red, and its upper mandible is parted in to two brims, which swell, and, to use the words of Edwards, nearly resemble beans. It is the most singular part, he adds, of the conformation of this bird, which exceeds the size of a domestic duck. Yet we must observe, that <HI>the female collared duck from Newfoundland</HI> of our <HI>Planches Enluminées</HI> is much analogous to the gray-headed Duck of Edwards; the chief difference consists in this, that the tints of the back are blacker in the plate of that naturalist, and that the cheek is painted greenish. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the King Duck, <HI>Anas Spectabilis:</HI> <Q>“Its bill is compressed at the base; a black feathery keel; its head somewhat hoary.”</Q> This bird is very common in Greenland and affords the natives much down.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The WHITE-FACED DUCK.</HEAD>
<P>THE first peculiarity that strikes us in this bird is, that its face is entirely white, con∣trasted by a black veil that covers the head, and, including the fore side and the top of the neck, falls behind: the wing and tail are blackish;
<PB N="215" REF="241"/>
the rest of the plumage is finely interwoven with waves and festoons of blackish, rusty and rufous, of which the tint, deeper on the back, runs into a brick red colour on the breast and the lower part of the neck. This Duck, which is found at Maragnon, is larger and more cor∣pulent than our wild duck.</P>

<P><HI>MARECA</HI> is, according to Piso, the ge∣neric name of the Ducks in Brazil; and Marcgrave applies it to two species, which seem not far removed from each other; and for this reason we place them together, distinguishing them however by the names of <HI>Marec</HI> and <HI>Ma∣reca.</HI> The first, says this naturalist, is a duck of small size, with a brown bill, and a red or orange spot on each corner; the throat and the cheeks are white, the tail gray, the wing deco∣rated with a green spangle and a black border. Catesby, who has described the same bird at
<PB N="216" REF="242"/>
Bahama, says, that this spangle on the wing is edged with yellow; but the name of <HI>Bahama duck,</HI> used by Brisson, is the less founded, as Catesby expressly remarks, that it appears there very seldom, having never seen any except the subject which he describes.</P>
<P>The Mareca, Marcgrave's second species, is of the same size with the other, and its bill and tail are black; a spangle shines with green and blue on the wing, on a brown ground; a spot of yellowish white is placed, as in the other, between the corner of the bill and the eye; the legs are vermilion, which, even after cooking, tinges with a fine red. The flesh of this last is, he adds, somewhat bitter; that of the former is excellent, yet the savages seldom eat it, fearing, they say, that feeding on an animal that appears unwieldy, they should become themselves less fit for running <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coreal, <HI>Voyage aux Indes Orientales, Paris,</HI> 1722.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Mareca Duck, <HI>Anas Brasiliensis:</HI> <Q>“It is brown, below glossy cinereous; an ochry-white spot between the bill and the eyes; its chin white; its tail wedge-shaped and black.”</Q>—Specific character of the Ilathera Duck, <HI>Anas Baha∣mensis:</HI> <Q>“It is gray; its bill lead-coloured; a fulvous spot on its side, a green and yellow spot on its wings.”</Q> It perches on trees, and does not migrate into the north.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The SARCELLES.</HEAD>
<P>THE form which nature has the most shaded, varied, and multiplied in the water-fowls, is that of the duck. After the great number of species in that <HI>genus</HI> which we have enumerat∣ed, comes a subordinate <HI>genus,</HI> almost as exten∣sive as the primary one, and which seems to present the same subjects on a smaller scale. This secondary kind is that of the <HI>Sarcelles,</HI> which we cannot better paint in general terms than by saying, that they are ducks much smaller than the others. But the analogy obtains not only in their natural habits, their structure, and the proportions of their form <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>; but also in the disposition of their plumage, and even in the great difference of colour that takes place be∣tween the males and the females.</P>
<P>The Sarcelles were often served up at the Roman tables <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>: they were so much esteemed, that pains was taken to rear them, like ducks, in the domestic state <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nam clausae pascuntur, Anates, Querquedulae, Boschides, Phalo∣rides, similesque volucres quae stagna &amp; paludes rimantur.</HI> Columella, <HI>de Re Rustica.</HI></NOTE>.

The fore side of the body presents a beautiful breast-plate woven with black or gray, and, as it were, mailed with little truncated squares, inclosed in larger, and all disposed with so much neatness and elegance, that the most charming effect is produced. The sides of the neck and the cheeks, as far as under the eyes, are worked with small streaks of white, vermiculat∣ed on a rufous ground: the upper side of the head is black, and also the throat; but a long white streak, extending from over the eye, falls below the nape: long feathers, drawn to a point, cover the shoulders, and recline on the wing in white and black stripes; the coverts which rest on the wings are decorated with a little green spangle: the flanks and the rump exhibit hatches of blackish-gray on white-gray, and are speckled as agreeably as the rest of the body.</P>
<P>The attire of the female is much simpler: clothed entirely with gray and dun-gray, it hardly shows some traces of waves or festoons

<P>In the pairing season, the male utters a cry like that of the rail; yet the female seldom makes her nest in our provinces <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Salerne says, that he never saw its nest in that part of the Orleanois where he observed.</NOTE>, and almost all these birds leave us before the 15th or 20th of April <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As the Sarcelle seldom appears but in winter, Schwenckfeld thence derives its name: <HI>Querquedula, quoniam querquero, id est fri∣gido &amp; hyemali tempore, maximè apparet.</HI> [Varro says, that it is a sort of diminutive from the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifies <HI>a weaver's shuttle;</HI> on account either of its rapid flight or its whistling voice.<HI>—T.]</HI></NOTE>. They fly in bands in the time of their migra∣tions, without preserving, like the ducks, any regular order: they take their flight from above the water, and proceed with great rapidity.
<PB N="221" REF="249"/>
They do not often bathe, but find their proper food on the surface of the lakes, or near the margin: flies, and the seeds of aquatic plants, are what they prefer.</P>
<P>Gesner found in their stomach little stones mixed with these aliments; and Frisch, who kept two months a couple of these birds taken young, has given us the following detail of their mode of living in this sort of incipient domesti∣cation: <Q>"I presented first to these Sarcelles," he says, “different seeds, and they would touch none; but scarce had I set beside their water∣trough a bason, filled with millet, than they both ran to it. At every bill-full which they took, each went to the water, and they car∣ried as much of it in a short time as com∣pletely to soak the millet. Yet the grain was not moistened sufficiently to their mind, and I saw my Sarcelles busy themselves in carry∣ing millet and water to the ground of their pen, which was of clay, and when the bottom was softened and tempered enough, they began to dabble, and made a pretty deep cavity, in which they ate their millet mixed with earth. I put them in a room, and they carried, in the same way, though to little purpose, the millet and water to the deal-floor. I led them on the grass, and they seemed to do nothing but dig for seeds, without eating the blades, or even earth-worms. They pursued flies and snapped them like ducks. When I delayed
<PB N="222" REF="250"/>
to give them their accustomed food, they called for it with a feeble hoarse cry, <HI>quoak,</HI> repeated every minute. In the evening they lay in the corners, and even during the day, when a person went near them, they hid them∣selves in the narrowest holes. They lived thus till the approach of winter; but when the se∣vere cold set in, they died suddenly.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Garganey, <HI>Anas Querquedula:</HI> <Q>“It has a green spot on the wings, and a white line above the” eyes.</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>THIS Sarcelle is smaller than the first, and differs besides by the colours of its head, which is rufous, and striped with a broad streak
<PB N="223" REF="251"/>
of green edged with white, that extends from the eyes to the occiput: the rest of the plumage is pretty much like that of the common sarcelle or garganey, except that its breast is not richly mailed, but only speckled.</P>
<P>This little Sarcelle breeds on our pools, and continues in the country the whole year. It conceals its nest among the large bulrushes, and builds it with their stalks, their pith, and with a heap of feathers: this nest, constructed with much care, is pretty wide, and rests on the sur∣face of the water, so as to rise and fall with it. The eggs amount to ten or twelve, and are about the size of a pigeon's; they are dirty white, with hazel-spots. The females take the whole ma∣nagement of the incubation; the males seem to leave them and associate together during that time, but in autumn they return to their fami∣lies. The teals are seen on the pools in clusters of ten or twelve; and in winter they resort to the rivers and unfrozen springs; there they live on cresses and wild chervil. On pools they eat the rush-seeds, and catch small fish.</P>
<P>They fly very swiftly; their cry is a sort of whistle, <HI>vouire, vouire,</HI> which is heard on the pools as early as the month of March. Hebert assures us, that this little Sarcelle is as common in Brie as the other is rare, and that great num∣bers are killed in that province. According to Rzaczynski, they are caught in Poland by means
<PB N="224" REF="252"/>
of nets stretched from one tree to another; the Teals throw themselves into these nets as they rise from the pools about the dusk of the even∣ing.</P>
<P>Ray, from the name, <HI>the Common Teal,</HI> which he bestows on our little Sarcelle, seems not to have known the common Sarcelle: Belon, on the contrary, was acquainted with no other; and though he applies to it indiscriminately the two Greek names <HI>boscas</HI> and <HI>phascas,</HI> the latter seems to have referred peculiarly to the little Sarcelle; for Athenaeus says, that the <HI>phascas</HI> is larger than the little <HI>colymbis,</HI> which is the little grebe. This species has obtained a communication with the new world by way of the north; since it is evi∣dently the <HI>pepatzca</HI> of Fernandez, and several that we have received from Louisiana differ not from those of Europe. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Common Teal, <HI>Anas Crecca:</HI> <Q>“It has a green spangle on the wings, and a white line above and below the eyes.”</Q> It is found as far north as Greenland, where it lays from thirteen to nineteen eggs.

<P>WE should have classed this species with the preceding, if Ray, who appears to have examined both, had not separated them; and we can only copy his account of the bird. <Q>“It is," says he, "somewhat smaller than the com∣mon teal, and is, without exception, the least of the whole genus; its bill is black; all its mantle brown cinereous, with the tips of the feathers white on the back; on the wing is a bar about the breadth of a finger, black, with reflections of emerald-green, and edged with white; all the fore side of the body is white washed with yellowish, spotted with black on the breast and the lower belly; the tail is pointed; the legs are blueish, and their webs black.”</Q></P>
<P>M. Baillon has sent me some notes on a <HI>Summer Sarcelle,</HI> by which he means the little
<PB N="226" REF="254"/>
Sarcelle of the preceding article, and not the Summer Teal described by Ray; but we cannot forbear inserting his observations, which are im∣portant.</P>
<P><Q>“We here (at <HI>Montreuil-sur-mer)</HI> call the Summer Sarcelle <HI>criquard</HI> or <HI>criquet;</HI> this bird is well made, and has much grace; its form is rounder than that of the com∣mon sarcelle or garganey; it is also more decorated, its colours are more varied and better contrasted; it has sometimes little blue feathers, which are not seen but when the wings are opened. Few water-birds are so chearful and sprightly as this Sarcelle; it is almost continually in motion, and bathes in∣cessantly: it is very easily tamed; I kept some several years in my court, and I still” have two which are very familiar.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“These handsome Sarcelles join to all their qualities an extreme gentleness. I never saw them fight either among themselves or with other birds: they make no defence even when attacked. As delicate as they are gentle, the least accident hurts them; the agitation into which they are thrown if chased by a dog, is sufficient to occasion their death: when they cannot escape by the aid of their wings, they remain extended on the spot, exhausted and expiring. Their food is bread, barley, wheat, and bran: they also catch flies, earth-worms,” slugs, and insects.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="227" REF="255"/>
“They arrive on our marshes that lie near the coast, about the first days of March: I believe that the south wind brings them. They do not keep in flocks, like the other Sarcelles and the whistlers. They are seen roving on all sides, and they pair soon after their arrival. In April they seek, in slimy spots scarce ac∣cessible, large tufts of rushes, or herbs, very close, and somewhat raised above the level of the marsh. They obtain a lodgment by re∣moving the stalks that encumber them, and by continual treading they form a little cavity, four or five inches in diameter, of which they line the bottom with dry herbs: the top is well covered by the thickness of rushes, and the entrance is hid by the stalks which were laid there; this entrance, for the most part, faces the south. The female deposits from ten to fourteen eggs of a white somewhat tar∣nished, and almost as large as pullets' eggs. I discovered that the time of incubation is, as in” hens, from twenty-one to twenty-three days.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The young are hatched covered with down, like the ducklings: they are very alert, and, a few days after birth, they are conducted by their parents to the water. They seek worms under the grass and in the mud. If any rave∣nous bird chance to pass, the mother makes a saint cry, and the whole family squats, and re∣mains motionless till another cry recalls them” to their activity.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="228" REF="256"/>
“Their first feathers are gray, like those of the females. It is then very difficult to dis∣tinguish the fexes, nor is the difficulty remov∣ed till the love-season; for it is a fact peculiar to this bird, which I have frequently had an opportunity of verifying, and which I shall here relate:—I commonly procured these Sar∣celles about the beginning of March; at that time the males were arrayed in their most beautiful feathers; the season of moulting ar∣rived, they became as gray as the females, and continued in that state till the month of Ja∣nuary; in the space of a month their feathers assumed another tinge. The present year I have again admired this change; the male which I have now is as beautiful as it can be, and I saw it as gray as the female. It would seem that nature has attired it for the season” of love.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“This bird is not a native of the northern countries; it is sensible to cold. Those which I had retired regularly to sleep in the hen-house, and kept themselves in the sun or near the kitchen-fire. They all died of accidents, most of them from the pecks which they re∣ceived from stronger birds. However, I have reason to believe that they do not live long, since their full growth is completed in two months, or thereabout.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the Summer Teal, <HI>Anas Circia:</HI> <Q>“The spangle on its wing is of a various colour; there is a white line above the eye-brows; its bill and legs are cinereous.”</Q> This Teal inhabits the lakes and rivers of Europe, and the Caspian sea.

<P>THIS beautiful Teal is very remarkable for the richness and the singularity of its plu∣mage: it is painted with the most vivid colours, and adorned on the head with a magnificent green and purple bunch, which extends beyond the nape; the neck and the sides of the face are enriched with narrow and pointed feathers of an orange red; the throat is white, and also the part above the eyes; the breast is of a purple or wine rufous; the flanks are pleasantly worked with little black fringes, and the quills of the wings are elegantly bordered with white streaks: to these beauties, add a remarkable singularity, that two feathers, one on each side, between those of the wing next the body, have on the outside of their shaft webs of an uncommon length, of a beautiful orange rufous, fringed with white and black on the edge, which form, as it

were, two fans or two broad papilionaceous wings raised on the back: these two singular feathers distinguish sufficiently this Sarcelle from all the others, besides the beautiful crest which usually floats on its head, but which it can erect.

<P>THIS Sarcelle, which is somewhat smaller than the garganey, has all its plumage of an uniform white gray on the fore side of the body, of the neck and of the head; only it is slightly spotted with blackish behind the eyes, and also on the throat and the sides of the breast: all the mantle, with the upper surface of the head and of the neck, is of a dull blackish, without any reflections.</P>

<P>THOUGH the Cayenne Sarcelle represented in our <HI>Planches Enluminées</HI> is smaller-sized than Catesby's <HI>Blue-winged Teal,</HI> the great re∣semblance in their colours induces us to regard them as the same species; and we are much in∣clined to class both with the preceding, and have therefore adopted a similar name.

<P>THIS species of Sarcelle, which is a native of Guiana, is distinguished from all the others by the tail-feathers, which are longer, and terminated by a little stiff filament like a spine, formed by the point of the shaft, produced a line or two beyond the webs of these feathers, which are blackish brown. The plumage of the body is unvaried, consisting of waves or blackish spots, deeper on the upper surface, lighter on the under, and festooned with white-gray in a rusty or yellowish ground: the top the head is blackish, and two streaks of the same colour, parted by two white streaks, pass, the one as high as the eye, the other lower on the cheek; the quills of the wing are also blackish.

<HEAD>SPECIES WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE DUCKS AND SARCELLES.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the description and history of the species well known and discriminated, it remains to indicate those to which the following accounts seem to refer; in order that observers and travellers may discover to what preceding species each belongs; or, if different, to delineate the new species.</P>
<P N="1">I. We must mention the ducks commonly called <HI>four wings,</HI> of which the Collection of the Academy speaks in these terms. <Q>“About 1680, appeared in the Boulonois a kind of ducks, which had their wings turned differently from others, the great feathers parting from the body and projecting out: which has occasioned the people to say, and believe, that they have four wings.”</Q> <HI>(Collect. Acad. Part. Etr. tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 304). We conceive that this character might be accidental, from the bare comparison of the preceding passage with the following. <Q>“M. l'Abbé Nollet saw in Italy a flock of geese, among which were many that seemed to have four wings: but this appearance, which took place only when the bird flew, was caused by the inversion of the last portion of the wing, which kept the great feathers elevated instead of lying flat along the body. These ducks
<PB N="245" REF="274"/>
came from the same hatch with the rest which carried their wings as usual; and neither of their parents had its pinions folded back.”</Q> <HI>Histoire de l' Academie,</HI> 1750, <HI>p.</HI> 7.</P>
<P>Thus these ducks, like the four-winged geese, must not be considered as peculiar species, but as accidental and even individual varieties, which may occur in any kind of birds.</P>
<P N="2">II. The duck, or rather the very little teal, mentioned by Rzaczynski in the following pas∣sage: <HI>Lithuania Polesia alit anates innumeras, inter quas...sunt...in cavis arborum natae, molem sturni non excedentes (Hist. p.</HI> 269.) [Polish Li∣thuania maintains ducks innumerable, among which...are...that breed in the hollows of trees, and exceed not the bulk of a stare.] If this au∣thor is accurate with regard to the size, which he makes to be so diminutive, we must confess that the species is unknown to us.</P>
<P N="3">III. The white-headed Barbary duck of Dr. Shaw, which is not the same with the musk duck, but ought rather to be classed with the Sarcelles, since it is only, he says, of the <HI>size of the lapwing:</HI> it has a broad, thick, blue bill; its head entirely white, and its body flame-co∣loured.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The <HI>anas platyrinchos</HI> of the same author, who calls it the <HI>Barbary pelican,</HI> improperly, since nothing can be further from a pelican than a duck. This is smaller than the preceding: its legs are red; its bill flat, broad, black, and indented; its
<PB N="246" REF="275"/>
breast, belly, and head are flame-coloured; its back is of a deeper cast; and there are spots on the wing, a blue, a white, and a green.</P>
<P N="5">V. The species which this traveller, with equal inaccuracy, denominates <HI>the little-billed Barbary pelican.</HI> <Q>"It is," says he, “somewhat larger than the preceding; its neck is reddish, and its head is adorned with a little tuft of tawny feathers; its bill is entirely white, and its back variegated with a number of white and black stripes; the feathers of the tail are pointed, and the wings are each marked with two contiguous spots, the one black and the other white; the extremity of the bill is black, and the legs are of a deeper blue than those of the lapwing.”</Q> This species appears to us much a-kin to the foregoing.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The <HI>turpan,</HI> or <HI>tourpan,</HI> a Siberian duck, found by Gmelin in the vicinity of Selinginski, of which he has given an account too short for recognizing the bird <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“In the neighbourhood of Selinginsk, we found a small lake, whose sides were covered with swans, <HI>geese,</HI> tourpans, and snipes: I cannot express the satisfaction which the sight of these birds be∣gat; their song, inspired by nature, was as pleasing as the imita∣tion with instruments would be disagreeable. The tones of the tourpans resemble much those of an hautbois; and, in this concert of birds, they performed nearly the part of the bass. This bird is a kind of duck; its plumage is fox-red, except the tail and the wings, which have a great mixture of black.”</Q> <HI>Gmelin.</HI></P></NOTE>. It appears, however, that this same duck is found in Kamtschatka, and is even common to Ochotsk, where, at the mouth of the river Ochotska, multitudes are
<PB N="247" REF="276"/>
caught in boats, as described by Kracheninikoff. We shall remark, with regard to this traveller, that he mentions his meeting with eleven spe∣cies of ducks and sarcelles at Kamtschatka; in which we can only ascertain the turpan, and the long-tailed duck of Newfoundland: the nine re∣maining are called, according to him, <HI>selosni, tchirki, krohali, gogoli, lutki, tcherneti, pulonosi, suasi, and the mountain duck.</HI> <Q>"The four first," says he, “pass the winter near fountains; the rest arrive in spring, and retire in autumn, like the geese.”</Q> We may presume, that many of these species might be referred to those which we have described, had this observer told us any thing more than their names.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The little duck of the Philippines, called at Luçon the <HI>saloyazir,</HI> and which, accor∣ding to Camel, being not larger than the hand, should be regarded as a sarcelle.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The <HI>woures-feique,</HI> or <HI>hatchet-bird</HI> of Madagascar, a sort of duck, so called by the islanders, says Francis Cauche, because it has on its front an excrescence of black flesh, which is round, and extends, bending back a little on their bill, like their hatchets. This traveller adds, that this species is of the size of our gos∣lings, and of the plumage of our ducks. We will add, that it is perhaps only a variety <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Flacourt names three or four kinds of teals, or <HI>sivire,</HI> which, he says, occur in Madagascar:<HI>—Tahie;</HI> its cry seems to articulate this name; its wings, its bill, and its legs, are red: <HI>Halive,</HI> has its bill and legs red: <HI>Hach,</HI> has its plumage gray, and its wings striped with green and white: <HI>Tatach,</HI> is a kind of halive, but smaller.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="248" REF="277"/>
IX. The two species of ducks, and the two sarcelles, seen by Bougainville at the Malouine or Falkland Islands, of which he says, that the first differ not much from those of our countries, adding, however, that he killed some which were entirely black, and others entirely white. <Q>With regard to the sarcelles, "the one," says he, “is of <HI>the size of the duck,</HI> with its bill blue; the other is much smaller, and of the latter are some whose ventral feathers are <HI>tinged with carnation.”</HI></Q> These birds are very plentiful in these islands, and are well tasted.</P>
<P N="10">X. The ducks of the Straits of Magellan <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“The ducks (at Magellan's Straits) are considerably dif∣ferent from ours, and much inferior; they are pretty numerous, and possess a particular district in the island, upon the lofty rocks, out of the reach of musket-shot. I never in my life saw so much art and industry in animals void of reason; they are so arranged on the heights, that the greatest geometer could not distribute the space to better advantage; all the districts are divided by little paths, no broader than to allow a bird to walk; the ground on which the nests are placed is smoothed, as if it were levelled by the hand of man; the nests are formed of kneaded earth, and seem as if they were cast upon the same mould; the ducks carry water in their bill, with which they make a mortar of clay, and fashion it into a round shape, as well as with a pair of compasses; the bottom is a foot broad, the mouth eight inches wide, and of an equal height; they are all alike with respect to form and pro∣portions: these nests serve them more than a year, and their eggs are hatched, I believe, in the sun. We could not find, in the whole place, a single stalk of grass, or straw, or feathers, or birds' dung; the whole was as clean and neat, both in the nests and the paths, as if it had been newly washed and swept.”</Q> <HI>Hist. des Naviga∣tions aux Terres Australes, tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 243.</P></NOTE>,
<PB N="249" REF="278"/>
which, according to some navigators, construct their nests after a singular fashion, with kneaded mud, and plastered with the utmost neatness; if this account be true, which from several cir∣cumstances seems suspicious, and little to be de∣pended on.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The <HI>painted duck</HI> of New Zealand, so named in Captain Cook's Second Voyage, and thus described: <Q>“The largest is as big as a Muscovy duck, with a very beautiful varie∣gated plumage, on which account we called it the painted duck; both male and female have a large white spot on each wing; the head and neck of the latter is white, but all the other feathers, as well as those on the head and neck of the drake, are of a dark variegated colour.”</Q> <HI>Vol.</HI> i. <HI>pp.</HI> 96 &amp; 97.</P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>The soft-billed whistling duck,</HI> otherwise called the <HI>blue-gray duck</HI> of New Zealand; re∣markable for this property, that its bill is soft and almost cartilaginous, insomuch that it can∣not subsist but by gathering, or so to speak, by sucking the worms which the tide leaves on the beach.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The red-combed duck, also of New Zealand, which was found only on the river at the bottom of Dusky Bay: this duck, which is only a little larger than the sarcelle, is of a very glossy dark gray on the upper side of the back, and of a deep gray soot-colour on the belly; the
<PB N="250" REF="279"/>
bill and the legs are lead-coloured; it has a golden iris, and a red crest on its head.</P>

<HEAD>The PETRELS.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Procellariae</HI> of Linnaeus.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF all the marine birds, those which the most constantly live on the great seas, are the Petrels; the most strangers to the land, the most adventurous in roving on the vast ocean: they commit themselves with equal confidence and audacity to the rolling billows, the impetuous winds, and seem to brave the fury of the tem∣pests. In the remotest portions of the globe, in every zone which navigators have visited, these birds seemed to expect their arrival, and even to have stretched beyond them into more distant and more stormy latitudes. Every where they have been seen to sport with security, and even gaiety, on that element, so terrible in its fury, which unnerves the most intrepid man: as if nature meant to demonstrate, that the instincts and faculties which she has allotted to the inferior creatures, excel the combined powers of our rea∣son and our art.</P>
<P>Furnished with long wings, accommodated with palmated feet, the Petrels add to the ease and nimbleness of flying, and to the facility of
<PB N="253" REF="282"/>
swimming, the singular power of running and walking on the water, razing the waves in a ra∣pid passage, their body being supported horizon∣tally, and balanced by the wings, and their feet striking alternately and precipitately on the sur∣face. Hence is derived the English name <HI>Petrel,</HI> or <HI>Peterel,</HI> which alludes to St. Peter's walking on the sea.</P>
<P>The species of the Petrels are numerous: they have all large and strong wings; yet they rise not to a great height, and commonly they raze the water in their flight. They have three toes con∣nected by a membrane; their two lateral toes have a ledge on their outer part; their fourth toe is only a little spur that rises immediately from the heel, without joint or phalanx <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby calls this spur, <HI>a little hind-roe,</HI> not imagining that it proceeds immediately from the heel.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bill, like that of the albatross, is articu∣lated, and seems composed of four pieces, two of which, as if they were added portions, form the extremities of the mandibles. There are also, along the upper mandible, near the head, two little tubes or flat rolls, in which the nostrils are perforated. From its general conformation, the bill would seem to be that of a ravenous bird, for it is thick, sharp, and hooked at its extremity: but this figure of the bill is not ex∣actly the same in all the Petrels, and the differ∣ence is even such as to afford a character for the subdivision of the genus. In fact, the point of the
<PB N="254" REF="283"/>
upper mandible alone is in many species bent into a hook; the point of the lower, on the con∣trary, is channelled and truncated like a spoon.—These species are the simple Petrels. In others, the points of both mandibles are sharp, reflected, and form together the hook. This difference of character has been remarked by Brisson; and we think that it ought not to be omitted or rejected, as done by Forster.—We shall denominate these species <HI>puffin-petrels.</HI></P>
<P>All these birds, the puffins as well as the Pe∣trels, seem to have the same instinct and common habits in hatching. They inhabit the land only during that time, which is pretty short; and, as if they were sensible of the incongruity of that residence, they hide or rather bury themselves in holes under the rocks by the sea-shore. From the bottom of these holes is heard their disagree∣able voice, which would generally be taken for the croaking of a reptile <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Petrels bury themselves by thousands in holes under ground; there they rear their young, and lodge every night. <HI>Forster's Observations.—</HI>The woods (at New Zealand) resound with the noise of the Petrels, concealed in holes under ground, which croak like frogs, or cluck like hens. It would seem that all the Petrels make their nests usually in subterraneous cavities; for we saw the blue kind in such lodgments at, Dusky Bay. <HI>Idem.</HI></NOTE>. They lay few eggs: they feed and fatten their young by disgorging into their bill the half-digested, oily substance of fish, which are their chief and almost only support. But they have a singular property, of which persons who seek their nests ought to be
<PB N="255" REF="284"/>
well aware: when attacked, they, whether from fear, or the hope of defending themselves, dis∣charge the oil with which their stomach is filled; they spout it in the face of the fowler; and as their nests are usually lodged on rocky shores, in the clifts of lofty precipices, igno∣rance of this fact has cost some observers their lives <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the General Advertiser, for June 1761, is the following re∣markable account from the Isle of Mull: <Q>“A gentleman of the name of Campbell, being fowling among the rocks, and having mounted a ladder to take some birds out of their holes, was so surprized, by one of this species spurting a quantity of oil in his face, that he quitted his hold, fell down, and perished.”</Q>—Smith, in his History of Kerry, mentions the same property of the stormy petrel.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Forster remarks, that Linnaeus knew little of the Petrels, since he reckons only <HI>six species;</HI> whereas Forster discovered himself <HI>twelve new species</HI> in the South Sea. It is to be wished, that this learned voyager would describe all these spe∣cies: mean while, we can only give those which we know from other sources.</P>

<P>THIS Petrel inhabits the northern seas. Clu∣sius compares its size to that of a middling hen: Rolandson Martin, a Swedish observer, says that it is equal in bulk to a crow. The first of these authors finds a resemblance in its port and figure to a falcon: indeed its bill, strongly jointed and much hooked, is formed for rapine; the hook of the upper mandible, and the truncated channel which terminates the under, are of a yellowish colour; and the rest of the bill, with the two tubulated nostrils, are blackish in the dead subject which we describe; but we are assured that the bill is entirely red as well as the legs in the living bird: the plumage of the body is a cinereous white; the mantle is blue cine∣reous, and the quills of the wing are of a deeper blue, and almost black: the feathers are very close and full, clothed below with a thick and fine down, with which the skin of the body is completely invested.</P>
<P><PB REF="286"/>

<P><PB N="257" REF="287"/>
Observers agree to give this Petrel the name of <HI>haff-hert</HI> or <HI>hav-hest,</HI> that is, sea-horse; <Q>“be∣cause," says Pontoppidan, "it utters a sound like the neighing of a horse, and the noise which it makes in swimming is like the trot of that animal.”</Q> But it is difficult to conceive how a bird swimming can occasion a noise like a horse's trot. Was not the name imposed be∣cause of the Petrel's running on the water? The same author adds, that these birds invariably fol∣low the boats employed in fishing for sea-dogs, in expectation of the entrails that are thrown out. He says, that they fasten so keenly on the dead whales, or such as are wounded and risen to the surface, that the fishermen knock them down with sticks, and yet cannot disperse the rest of the flock. Hence Rolandson Martin ap∣plies to them the name <HI>mallemucke;</HI> which, as we have formerly remarked, belongs properly to a gull.</P>
<P>These cinereous petrels are found from the sixty∣second degree of north latitude to the eightieth. They fly among the ice of those regions, and when they are seen on the main, making towards land for shelter, it is, as in the <HI>tempest-bird</HI> or <HI>little petrel,</HI> a sign to navigators of an approaching storm. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the Fulmar, <HI>Procellaria Glacialis:</HI> <Q>“It is whitish, and its back somewhat hoary.”</Q> This bird inhabits the island of St. Kilda, on the west of Scotland, the whole year, except during the months of September and October. It breeds about the middle of June, laying but a single egg, which is large, white, and very brittle. The islanders feed on its flesh, stuff their beds with its down, and chear their tedious winter-nights with lamps supplied with its oil.</P>

<P>THE plumage of this Petrel, marked with white and black, regularly intersected and checkered, has procured it the name <HI>damier (chess-board)</HI> from our navigators.

<P>The Checker has its bill and legs black; the outer toe is composed of four joints, the middle one of three, and the inner of two only; instead of a little toe it has a pointed spur, hard, a line and a half long, and the point turned outwards; the bill has over it the two little tubes or rolls in which the nostrils are perforated; the point of the upper mandible is curved, that of the lower is channeled, and, as it were, truncated: this character places the Checker among the fa∣mily of Petrels, and excludes it from that of the puffins. The upper side of its head is black, the great quills of its wings are of the same co∣lour, with white spots; the tail is fringed with white and black, and when spread it <HI>resembles,</HI> says Frezier, <HI>a mourning scarf;</HI> its belly is white, and its mantle is regularly interspersed with black and white spots.

The wings are also bordered entirely round with a slender black edging, which gradually becomes more dilute, and approaches to a dull gray on the back of the bird: the inner edge of the wings, and the back itself, from the head to the end of the tail, are enamelled with an infinite number of handsome round spots, white and black, of the size of a half-penny; the belly, the thighs, the flanks, and the under surface of the wings, are light gray. <HI>Dampier.</HI></NOTE>.

Admiral Anson sought for them unsuccessfully at the island of Juan Fernandez; yet he perceived many of their holes, and he concluded that the wild dogs which were spread through this island had chased them away or destroyed them. But in another season he might have there found these birds, supposing that the time he before made the search was not that of their hatching; for, as we have already said, they never reside on land, except when detained by incubation, but spend their days in open sea, resting on the water in calm, and even dwelling on it when it rolls in commotion; they seat themselves in the hollow between two waves,

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS Petrel resembles the Checker, except the colour of its plumage, of which the spots, instead of black, are brown on a white ground. The denomination of Antarctic Petrel, given to it by Captain Cook, seems to suit it perfectly, since it occurs only in the highest southern latitudes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 62° 10′ south latitude, and 172° longitude, we saw the first island of ice, and at the same time we perceived-an Antarctic Pe∣trel, some gray albatrosses, pintadoes, and blue petrels. <HI>Cook.—</HI>In latitude 66°, Captain Cook saw some Antarctic Petrels in the air.—In 67° 8′, he was visited by a small number of Antarctic Pe∣trels.</NOTE>; while many species of Pe∣trels, common in the lower latitudes, particularly that of the black checker, appear not in those dismal regions.</P>
<P>In the second voyage of that great navigator, he gives the following account of this new spe∣cies
<PB N="265" REF="296"/>
of Petrels. <Q>“In 67° 15′ south latitude, we saw numbers of whales playing about the islands of ice. Two days after, we remarked many flocks of <HI>pintados,</HI> brown and white, which I called <HI>Antarctic Petrels,</HI> because they seemed peculiar to those regions. They are in every respect shaped like the <HI>pintadoes,</HI> from which they differ only in colour; the head and the fore side of their body are brown, and the hind part of their back, their tail, and the extremities of their wings, are white.”</Q> In another part, he says, <Q>“While we were collecting ice, we caught two <HI>Antarctic Petrels,</HI> and upon exa∣mining them, we were still disposed to believe that they belonged to the family of the Pe∣trels. They are nearly of the size of a large pigeon; the feathers of the head, the back, and a part of the upper side of the wings, are of a light brown; the belly, and the under side of the wings, are white; the feathers of the tail are white also, but brown at the tips. I remarked that these birds had more plumage than those we had seen; so careful is nature to accommodate the cloathing to the climate. We found these Petrels among the snow.”</Q></P>
<P>Yet these Petrels, so common among the floating islands of ice, disappear, as well as all the other birds, when the firm ice is approach∣ed, whose formidable bed extends very far into the polar regions of the southern continent. Of this fact we are informed by that great

navigator, the first and the last perhaps of mortals, that has dared to visit the frozen bar∣riers which nature gradually forms and en∣larges in proportion as our globe cools. <Q>“Af∣ter our arrival amidst the ice, he says, no Antarctic Petrel any more called our atten∣tion.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Procellaria Antarctica:</HI> <Q>“It is brown; below blueish white; its tail white tipt with black; its legs lead-coloured.”</Q></NOTE></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS Petrel is very justly denominated the <HI>Snowy Petrel,</HI> not only on account of the whiteness of its plumage, but because it is al∣ways met with in the vicinity of the frozen re∣gions, and announces to the navigator in the South Sea his approach to the ice-islands. Cap∣tain Cook, when he first saw them at a distance, termed them <HI>white birds</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“At noon we were in the latitude of 51° 50′ south, and longi∣tude 21° 3′ east, where we saw some white birds about the size of pigeons, with blackish bills and feet. I never saw any such be∣fore; and Mr. Forster had no knowledge of them. I believe them to be of the Peterel tribe, and natives of these icy seas. At this time we passed between two ice islands, which lay at a little distance from each other.”</Q> <HI>Cook's second Voyage, vol.</HI> i. <HI>pp.</HI> 22 <HI>and</HI> 23.</P></NOTE>; but afterwards he
<PB N="267" REF="298"/>
discovered from the structure of their bill that they belonged to the genus of Petrels. They are as large as a pigeon; their bill is blueish∣black; their legs are blue, and their plumage seems to be entirely white.</P>
<P><Q>“When we approached a broad ridge of solid ice,”</Q> says Forster, the learned and laborious companion of the illustrious Cook, <Q>“we ob∣served at the horizon, what the Greenland∣men call an <HI>ice-twinkle;</HI> insomuch that, from the appearance of this phaenomenon, we were sure of meeting ice at a few leagues distance. Then it was that we commonly saw flights of White Petrels of the size of pigeons, which we called <HI>Snowy Petrels,</HI> and which are the fore-runners of the ice.”</Q></P>
<P>These White Petrels, intermingled with the antarctic petrels, seem to have constantly ac∣companied these adventurous navigators in all their traverses amidst the islands of ice, as far as the vicinity of the immense <HI>glaciere</HI> of the south∣ern pole.

<P>THE Blue Petrel, so called because its plumage is blue gray, as well as its bill and legs, occurs only in the South Seas, from the twenty∣eighth to the thirtieth degree of latitude, and thence towards the pole. Captain Cook was accompanied from the Cape of Good Hope as far as the forty-first degree by flocks of these Blue Petrels, and flocks of Checkers, whose num∣bers the rough sea and boisterous winds seem to augment. He again saw the Blue Petrels in the fifty-fifth degree to the fifty-eighth; and, no doubt, they inhabit all the intermediate points of these southern latitudes.</P>
<P>It is remarked as a peculiarity in these Blue Petrels, that their bill is exceeding broad, and their tongue very thick: they are somewhat larger than the snowy petrels <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Blue Petrel has nearly the size of a little pigeon. <HI>Cook.</HI></NOTE>. In the blue
<PB N="269" REF="300"/>
gray tint that covers the upper side of the body, we perceive a deeper band, cutting transversely the wings and the lower part of the back: the end of the tail is also of the same deep blue or blackish cast: the belly and the under side of the wings are of a blueish-white. Their plu∣mage is thick and abundant. <Q>“The Blue Pe∣trels, which are seen in this immense sea,”</Q> (between America and New Zealand) says Mr. Forster, <Q>“are no less provided against the cold than the penguins. Two feathers, instead of one, grow from each root; they are laid one upon another, and form a very warm covering. As they are continually in the air, their wings are very strong and long. We found them between New Zealand and America, more than seven hundred leagues from land; a space which it would be impossible for them to tra∣verse, were not their bones and muscles prodi∣giously firm, and were they not aided by long wings.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>"These sailor-birds," continues Mr. Forster, “live perhaps a considerable time without food.... Our experience demonstrates and corro∣borates in some respects this supposition: when we wounded some of these Petrels, they in∣stantly discharged a quantity of viscous ali∣ments, newly digested, which the others swal∣lowed with an avidity that betrayed a long fasting. It is probable, that in those frozen seas there are many species of <HI>mollusca,</HI> which
<PB N="270" REF="301"/>
rise to the surface in fine weather, and serve to support these birds.”</Q></P>
<P>The same observer again found these Petrels in vast numbers assembled to nestle in New Zealand. <Q>“Some were flying, others were in the middle of the woods, under the roots of trees, in the crevices of rocks where they could not be caught, but where they undoubtedly hatch their young. The noise which they made resembled the croaking of frogs. None appeared in the day, but they flew much dur∣ing the night.”</Q></P>
<P>These Blue Petrels were of the broad-billed species which we have just described; but Cap∣tain Cook seems to point out another in the following passage: <Q>“We killed Petrels; many were of the blue kind, but they had not a broad bill, as those of which I have spoken above; and the end of their tail was tinged with white, instead of deep blue. Our natu∣ralists could not agree, whether this form of the bill, and this shade of colour, distinguished only the male from the female <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"We were in the fifty-eighth degree of south latitude." <HI>Cook.</HI></NOTE>.”</Q> It is not probable that such a difference in the fashion of the bill could take place between the male and female of the same species; and it would seem, that we ought to admit two species of Blue Pe∣trels, the first with a broad bill, and the second with a narrow bill, and the tip of the tail white.</P>

A circumstance
<PB N="272" REF="303"/>
which the more assimilates it to the Petrels, is, that it seldom appears near vessels but on the approach of stormy weather. This is related in the <HI>Histoire Generale des Voyages:</HI> some descrip∣tive details are there added, which appear how∣ever too uncertain to be adopted, and which we shall therefore be contented to throw into a note <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pilots in the South Sea have long remarked, that a day or two before a north-wind blows, a sort of birds, which they see at no other time, then advance to the coast, and hover about ves∣sels: they are called <HI>quebranthuessos</HI> (that is, <HI>bone-breakers);</HI> and they are observed to alight and float on the waves beside the ship till the weather calms.

This bird is somewhat larger than a duck; its neck is thick, short, and a little curved; its head large, its bill broad, and not long; its tail small, its back raised, its wings spacious, its thighs small: some have the plumage whitish, in others it is spotted with dull brown; in others the whole craw, the inner part of the wings, the lower part of the neck, and the whole of the head, are perfectly white; but the back, and the upper part of the wings and of the neck, are brown verging on black; hence they are called <HI>lomos-prietos</HI> (blackish-backs): they are reckoned the surest forerunners of foul weather. <HI>Hist.

<P>THE character of the branch of <HI>Puffins</HI> in the genus of Petrels consists, as we have said, in both mandibles being hooked and bent down∣wards; a structure undoubtedly of very little ad∣vantage to the bird, and which, in the use of its bill and in the act of seizing, allows the upper mandible to exert small force on the reflected part of the lower. The nostrils are of a tubu∣lated form, as in all the Petrels; the structure of its feet with the spur at the heel, as well as the general shape of its body, are the same. It is fifteen inches long; its breast and belly are white; a gray tint is spread over the whole
<PB N="274" REF="305"/>
upper side of the body, pretty clear on the head, and which becomes deeper and blueish on the wings and the tail, in such manner however that each feather appears fringed or festooned with a lighter tint.</P>
<P>These birds reside in our seas, and seem to have their rendezvous in the Scilly islands, but more especially on the Calf of Man: they re∣sort there in multitudes during the spring, and begin by making war on the rabbits, the only inhabitants of that rock; they drive these from their burrows, of which they take possession. They lay two eggs, one of which, it is said, usually never hatches: but Willughby posi∣tively asserts, that they have only a single egg. As soon as the chick is hatched, the mother leaves it early in the morning, and returns not till evening. During the night she feeds it, disgorging at intervals the substance of the fish which she caught in the course of the day at sea. The aliment, half digested in her stomach, turns into a sort of oil, which she gives to her young one. This nourishment makes it ex∣tremely fat; and, at this time, some fowlers land on the rocky islet, where they lodge in huts, and catch multitudes of the young birds in their burrows. But to render this game pa∣latable, it must be cured with salt, in order to temper in part the rankness of its excessive fat. Willughby, from whom we borrow these facts, adds, that as the fowlers have a custom of cut∣ting
<PB N="275" REF="306"/>
away a foot from each of these birds, for the sake of reckoning the number caught, the people entertain a notion that they are hatched with a single foot.</P>
<P>Klein pretends, that the name <HI>Puffin</HI> or <HI>Pupin</HI> is formed from the cry of the bird. He re∣marks, that this species has its times of appear∣ance and disappearance; which must indeed be the case with birds that never come on land but to nestle, and that dwell on the sea sometimes in one latitude, sometimes in another, always at∣tending the shoals of little migratory fish, or their collections of spawn, on both which they feed.</P>
<P>Though the observations above related were all made in the northern sea, it appears that this species is not exclusively attached to that part of our globe. It is common on all seas, for it is the same with the <HI>Jamaica shear-water</HI> of Brown, and the <HI>artenna</HI> of Aldrovandus. In short, it seems to frequent equally the different portions of the ocean, and even to advance into the Me∣diterranean, as far as the Gulf of Venice and the <HI>Tremiti</HI> isles, anciently called <HI>the isles of Diomede.</HI> All that Aldrovandus says, whether of the figure or of the natural habits of his <HI>ar∣tenna,</HI> corresponds with those of the shear-water. He assures us, that the cry of these birds resem∣bles exactly the wailing of a new-born infant. Finally, he is disposed to believe that they are
<PB N="276" REF="307"/>
<HI>the birds of Diomede</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Ovid, speaking of these birds of Diomede, says:
<Q><L>Si volucrum quae sit dubiarum forma requiris,</L>
<L>Ut non cygnorum, sic albis proxima cygnis.</L></Q></P>
<P>This does not come very near to the Petrel; but poetry and mythology are here so blended, that we cannot expect to find exact traces of nature. Linnaeus was not very happy in applying his erudition, when he gave the name of <HI>Diomedea</HI> to the albatross; since this large bird occurs only in the seas of the east and south, and was therefore unknown to the Greeks.</P></NOTE>, famous in antiquity from an affecting fable. It was of those Greeks, who, with their valiant leader, pursued by the wrath of the gods, were found in those islands meta∣morphosed into birds, which still retaining some∣thing human, and a tender remembrance of their ancient country, flocked to the shore when the Greeks disembarked, and seemed, by their ten∣der accents, to express their melancholy regret. But this interesting mythology, whose fictions, too much censured by persons of cold temper, diffused to the apprehension of sensible minds so much grace, life, and charms in nature, appears really to allude, in this instance, to a point in natural history, and to have been imagined from the moaning voice of these birds. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Shear-water, <HI>Procellaria Puffinus:</HI> "Its body is black above, and white below; its legs are refous."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>EIGHTH SPECIES.</HEAD>
<P>FULMAR is the name which this bird has at the island of St. Kilda. It seems to us a species closely related to the preceding; the only difference being this, that the plumage of the under side of the body is white-gray in the Ful∣mar, and blueish-gray in the shear-water.</P>
<P><Q>"The Fulmar," says Dr. Martin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage to St. Kilda, <HI>London,</HI> 1698, <HI>p.</HI> 55.</NOTE>, “feeds on the back of living whales; its spur serves to hold it firm on their slippery skin, without which precaution they would be blown off by the wind, always violent in those stormy seas, ...

<P>THOUGH the epithet <HI>stormy</HI> is applicable more or less to all the Petrels, yet navi∣gators have agreed to appropriate it to this spe∣cies. The Stormy Petrel is the last in the order of size, not exceeding that of a finch; whence it has sometimes received its name. It is the smallest of all the palmipede birds; and one might be surprised that so little a bird should expose itself on the ocean at an immense distance from land. But amidst its audacity, it still seems conscious of its weakness, and it is the first that seeks shelter from the impending storm.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="313"/>
By force of instinct, it perceives those indications which escape our senses; and its motions and its approach warn the sailors to be prepared for the tempest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clusius.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When, in calm weather, these little Petrels are seen to flock behind a vessel, flying on the wake, and sheltering themselves under the stern, the mariners hasten to furl the sails, and prepare for the storm, which infallibly comes on a few hours after <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">More than six hours before the storm, it foresees its ap∣proach, and hastens to shelter itself beside the vessels which it des∣cries at sea. <HI>Linnaeus, in the Stockholm Memoirs.—</HI>On the 14th of May, between the island of Corsica and that of Monte Christo, we saw behind the vessel a flock of <HI>Petrels,</HI> known by the name of <HI>Storm-birds.</HI> When these birds arrived, it was three o'clock in the afternoon; the weather was fine, the wind south-east, and almost calm: but at seven o'clock the wind turned into the south-west with much violence, the sky thickened and grew stormy, the night was very dark, and repeated flashes of lightning augmented the horror, the sea swelled prodigiously, and we were obliged to pass the whole night under a reefed main-sail. <HI>Extract from the Journal of a Navigator.—</HI>It would seem that many navigators apply the name of <HI>alcyon</HI> to the Stormy Petrel, or some other species, which follows their vessels, but is very different from the kingfisher, or the alcyon of the ancients.</NOTE>. Thus, the appearance of these birds at sea is at once dismal and salutary; and nature would seem to have dispersed them over the wide ocean to convey the friendly intelli∣gence. The species of the Stormy Petrel is uni∣versally diffused: <Q>"It is found," says Forster, “equally in the northern and the southern seas, and almost in all latitudes.”</Q> Many sailors have
<PB N="281" REF="314"/>
averred, that they met with these birds in every track of their voyages <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These birds fly on all the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, and are seen on the shores of America, as well as those of Europe, several hundred leagues from land; sea-faring people generally reckon their appearance as the prognostic of a storm. <HI>Catesby.—</HI>I have seen many of these birds together in the broadest and most northern parts of the German Ocean, when they must have been upwards of a thousand English miles from land. <HI>Edwards.</HI></NOTE>. But they have not on that account been the easier to catch; they have long even escaped the search of observers, because, when shot, they were almost always lost in the eddy of the ship's wake, which swallowed up their little body <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>"One of these birds," says Linnaeus, “was fired at on wing, but missed; yet it was not intimidated by the report; and perceiv∣ing the wad, it alighted, mistaking it for food, and was caught by the hand.”</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Stormy Petrel flies with amazing swift∣ness by means of its long wings, which are pretty much like those of the swallow <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>. It can rest amidst the tumbling billows; it shelters it∣self in the hollow between two high waves, where it remains a few seconds, though the swell rolls on with extreme rapidity. In these watery undulating furrows it runs, like the lark in the furrows of ploughed land, it supports and moves itself not by flying but by running, in which, balanced on its wings, it with astonish∣ing swiftness razes and strikes the surface of the water with its feet <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>“You would say it was Pegasus, if you saw it running like light∣ning on the water.”</Q> <HI>Clusius.—</HI>Though their feet are formed for swimming, they are also calculated for running; indeed they most commonly use them in the latter, for they are seen very often run∣ning swiftly on the surface of the waves, when thrown into the great∣est commotion. <HI>Catesby.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="315"/>
The colour of the plumage of this bird is a blackish brown or a smoky black, with purple reflections on the fore side of the neck, and on the coverts of the wings, and other blueish re∣flections on their great quills: the rump is white; the point of its folded and crossed wings pro∣jects beyond the tall; its legs are pretty tall, and, like the other Petrels, it has a spur instead of a hind toe; and as the two mandibles are bent downwards, it belongs to the family of <HI>Puffins.</HI></P>
<P>It appears that there is a variety in this spe∣cies: the little Petrel of Kamtschatka has the tips of its wings white <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>procellariae,</HI> or the birds that foretell storms, are about the bulk of a swallow; they are entirely black, except the wings, whose tips are white. <HI>History of Kamtschatka.</HI></NOTE>; that of the Italian seas, which Salerne describes minutely, and at the same time discriminates from the stormy Petrel <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>"It is not," says he, “larger than the <HI>sea-finch;</HI> its head is al∣most wholly blue, as well as its craw and its sides, with reflections of violet and of black; the upper side of its neck is green and purple, changing like that of the pigeon; the top of its wings and its rump are speckled with white; all the rest is black; it has a very quick, confident look. This bird seems to be a stranger to land, at least no person can say that he ever saw it on the coast: its presence is a sure sign of an approaching storm, though the sky, the air, and the sea, betray no indication of it, but are calm and serene: at this time they do not fly one by one, but they all direct their flight to some vessel which they descry from a distance, and at which they meet.”</Q> <HI>Salerne.</HI></P></NOTE>, is, according to that ornithologist,
<PB N="283" REF="316"/>
tinged with blue, violet, and purple. But we think that these colours are nothing else than the reflections with which the dull ground of its plumage is glossed. And with respect to the white or whitish feathers on the coverts of the wing, which Linnaeus mentions in his description of the little Swedish Petrel, which is the same with ours, the difference arises undoubtedly from the age. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Stormy Petrel, <HI>Procellaria Pelagica:</HI> "It is black; its rump white." Its length is six inches; its alar extent thirteen. This bird is particularly frequent on the Atlantic Ocean: it is silent in the day, and clamorous during the night. The sailors call it the <HI>Witch.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>To this little Petrel we shall refer the <HI>rotje</HI> of Greenland and Spitzbergen, which the Dutch navigators speak of; for though their accounts are in some respects incongruous, they are suffi∣cient to shew the identity of the <HI>rotje</HI> and our Stormy Petrel. <Q>"The <HI>rotje,"</HI> according to these voyagers, “has a hooked bill...it has only three toes, which are connected by a mem∣brane...it is almost black over all the body, except on the belly, which is white; some also have their wings spotted with black and white....In other respects, it much resembles a swal∣low.”</Q> Anderson says, that <HI>rojet</HI> signifies <HI>little rat,</HI> and that <Q>“this bird has, in fact, the black colour, the diminutive size, and the cry of a rat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They cry <HI>rottet, tet, tet, tet, tet,</HI> at first very high, and af∣terwards lowering the tone gradually; perhaps this cry has occa∣sioned their receiving the name of <HI>rotje:</HI> they make more noise than any other bird, because their voice is shriller and more piercing. They build their nests with moss, and some on the mountains, where we killed a great number of the young ones with sticks: they feed on certain gray worms resembling crabs...they also eat red shrimps and lobsters. We killed some of these birds, for the first time, on the ice, on the 29th of May; but afterwards we took many at Spitzber∣gen. These birds are very good to eat, and the best next to those which are called <HI>strand copers runers</HI> (shore-runners); they are fleshy and fat. <HI>Recueil des Voyages du Nord; Rouen,</HI> 1716, <HI>tom.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 93.</NOTE>.”</Q> It
<PB N="284" REF="317"/>
seems that these birds never come ashore in Spitzbergen and Greenland, but to breed their young: they place their nest, like all the Petrels, in narrow deep holes, under the ruins of fallen rocks, on the coasts, and close on the water's edge. As soon as the young are able to come out of the nest, the parents accompany them, and slip out of their holes into the sea, and return not to land.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>little diving Petrel</HI> of Cook and Forster, we should have also given it the same arrangement, had not these voyagers indi∣cated, by that epithet, a habit which we know not in our Stormy Petrel, that of diving <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Queen Charlotte's Sound (at New Zealand), we saw great flocks of little diving Petrels <HI>(procellaria tridactyla)</HI> flying or sit∣ting on the surface of the sea, or swimming under water to a consi∣derable distance with astonishing agility.

About this time we saw a few small divers (as we called them) of the Peterel tribe, which we judged to be such as are usually seen near land, especially in the bays and on the coast of New Zealand. I cannot tell what to think of these birds. Had there been none of them, I should have been ready enough to believe that we were, at this time, not very far from land; as I never saw one so far from land before. Pro∣bably these few had been drawn thus far by some shoal of fish; for such were certainly about us, by the vast number of blue Peterels, albatrosses, and such other birds as are usually seen in the great ocean: all, or most of them, left us before night. <HI>Cook's Second Voyage, vol.</HI> i. <HI>pp.</HI> 260 &amp; 261.</P>

Finally, we shall refer, not indeed to the Stormy Petrel, but to the tribe of Petrels in ge∣neral, the species hinted at in the following no∣tices.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Petrel, which Captain Carteret's sailors called <HI>Mother Carey's Chicken,</HI> <Q>“which ap∣peared," he says, "to walk on the water, and of which we saw many from the time we cleared the Straits of Magellan, along the coasts of Chili <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is also the same probably which Wafer mentions in the fol∣lowing terms. <Q>“The gray birds (of the island of Juan Fernandez) are nearly of the bulk of a small pullet, and make holes in the ground like rabbits; in these they lodge night and day; they go a-fishing.”</Q></NOTE>.”</Q> This Petrel is probably one of these which we have described; perhaps the <HI>quebranta∣huessos,</HI> called <HI>Mother Carey</HI> by Cook's people <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Our author's conjecture is right; it is the giant Petrel.<HI>—T.</HI></NOTE>.—A word on the size of this bird would have decided the question.</P>

II. The <HI>devil birds</HI> of Father Labat, of which we can hardly determine the species, notwith∣standing all that this prolix author speaks of it. We shall give his account, much abridged. <Q>The devils, or <HI>diablotins,</HI> begin," says he, “to appear at Guadaloupe and St. Domingo about the end of the month of September. They are then found two and two in each hole. They disappear in November, and appear again in March; at which time the mother is found in her hole with two young ones, which are covered with a thick and yellow down, and are lumps of fat: they are now called <HI>cottons.</HI> They are able to fly, and they depart about the end of May. During this month many are caught, and the negroes live on nothing else.... The great sulphur mountain <HI>(soufrière)</HI> in Guadaloupe is all bored, like a warren, with the holes which these devils excavate: but as they select the steepest parts, it is very dan∣gerous to catch them ... All the night we spent on that mountain, we heard the great noise made by them going out and in, and call∣ing and answering each other ... By our mutual assistance, dragging each other with cords, we reached places stocked with these birds. In three hours our four negroes took thirty-eight devils out of their burrows, and I seventeen ... A young devil newly roasted is a delicious food ... The old devil is nearly of the size of a pullet ready to lay; its plumage is black;
<PB N="287" REF="320"/>
its wings are broad and strong; its legs are pretty short; its toes are furnished with stout and long claws; the bill is hard, and very hooked, pointed, and an inch and an half long; it has large eyes level with its head, which serve admirably for seeing in the night, but are so useless during the day, that it cannot bear the light, or discern objects; insomuch, that if it be overtaken by day, while out of its retreat, it dashes against every thing it meets, and at last tumbles to the ground ... and hence it never goes to sea but in the night.”</Q></P>
<P>What Father Dutertre says of the <HI>devil-bird</HI> does not assist us to discover this. He speaks only from the reports of fowlers; and all that we can infer from the natural habits of the bird is, that it is a Petrel.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Alma de Maestro</HI> of the Spaniards, which appears to be a Petrel, and might even be referred to the checker, if the account given of it were a little more precise, and did not be∣gin with an error, by applying the name <HI>pardela,</HI> which constantly applies to the checker, to two Petrels, a gray and a black, with which it does not correspond <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the passage from Chili to Peru, at a great distance from land, we saw birds remarkable for roving on the ocean; they are called <HI>pardelas:</HI> they are nearly of the size of a pigeon; their body is long, their neck very short, their tail in proportion, their wings long and thin. They are distinguished into two kinds, the one gray, the other black; and their only difference consists in the colour. We saw also, but at a less distance on sea, another bird, which the Spaniards call <HI>Alma de Maestro,</HI> black and white; it has a long tail, and is not so common as the pardelas; it seldom appears but in rough weather, and hence its name. <HI>Run of the Frigates le Veles &amp; la Rosa from Callao to Juan Fernandez; Hist.

This bird swims and dives swiftly, and easily eludes ambushes: it is seen on the sea <HI>near the mouths of rivers.”</HI></Q> This last circumstance, were it constant, would incline us to doubt whether this bird belonged to the Petrels, which all affect to live remote from the shores.</P>

It never has been seen in the seas of the northern hemisphere, no more than the manchots, and some others which seem to be attached to that portion of our globe, where they can scarce be disturbed by man, and where they have long remained unknown.

The ground of its plumage is a dun white on the mantle, with little black hatches on the back and on the wings, where these hatches multiply and thicken into speckles: a part of the great quills of the wing, and the extremity of the tail, are black: the head is thick, and of a round form: the bill is of a structure similar to that of the bill of the frigat, the booby, and the cormorant; it is composed in the same manner of several pieces that seem articulated and joined by futures, with a hook superadded, and the end of the lower part hollowed with a channel, and, as it were, trun∣cated; this very large and strong bill resembles that of the petrels, in the remarkable property that its nostrils are open in shape of little rolls or sheaths, laid near the root of the bill in a groove which, on each side, runs the whole length; it is yellowish white, at least in the dead bird: the legs, which are thick and stout, have only three toes connected by a broad membrane, that edges also the outside of each exterior toe: the length of the body is near three feet; the alar extent at

<P>With this force of body, and these arms, the Albatross might seem to be a warrior bird.

It is not confined to the antarctic seas; numbers resort every summer to the northern shores in quest of the shoals of salmon, and it is so voracious as sometimes to be taken while it dozes surfeited on the water. It brays like an ass. The flesh of these birds is tough and dry; but the Kamtschadales seek them for the sake of their entrails, which they blow and use as buoys for their nets: their method is to fasten a cord to a large hook baited with a whole fish, which the Albatrosses greedily seize. The bones of the wing serve these people for tobacco-pipes. Such as frequent the seas near the tropics subsist chiefly on flying-fish. Those of the southern hemisphere repair to the shore in the month of October, and build their nest with sedges, like a rick three feet high, leav∣ing a small hole in the top for receiving their egg, which is four inches and a half long, white, with dull spots near the large end. They are much annoyed with hawks.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE bill is the principal organ of birds, the instrument by which their powers and fa∣culties are exercised; it serves as a mouth, as a hand, as an arm. It is that part of their body whose structure the most determines their in∣stincts, and directs their habits of life: and if the winged tribes disperse through the air, on the sea, and on the land, if they engage in an endless variety of pursuits, it is because nature has bestowed on their bill an infinite diversity of form. A sharp, lacerating hook arms the head of the fierce birds of prey; their appetite for flesh and their thirst for blood, joined to the

means of satisfying these, precipitate them from their towering heights upon all other birds, and even upon all the weak and timorous animals, which are equally their victims. A bill shaped like a broad and flat spoon, induces another genus of birds to gather their subsistence at the bot∣tom of the water: while a conical bill, short and truncated, enables the gallinaceous kind to pick up the seeds on the ground, disposes them to assemble round us, and seems to invite them to receive their food from our hands. A bill, fa∣shioned like a slender pliant probe, which length∣ens out the face of the curlews, of the wood∣cock, of the snipe, and of most other waders, constrains them to inhabit marshy grounds, there to dig in the soft mud and the wet slime. The sharp taper form of the woodpecker's bill con∣demns it to bore the bark of trees. And finally, the little awl-shaped bill of most of the field-birds permits them only to catch gnats and other mi∣nute insects, and forbids every other sort of food. Thus the different form of the bill mo∣difies the instincts, and gives rise to most of the habits of birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is proper to put the reader on his guard against this spe∣cious sort of declamation, in which the materialists have so much indulged. If an animal were directed by its organization to fol∣low its particular mode of life, it must be supposed to make trial of every possible situation, and to adopt that which, on due expe∣rience, is found to be the best suited to its nature. But this hypo∣thesis is completely absurd. Prior to all reflection, instinct leads irresistibly to a certain course of action, to which the corporeal structure is in general admirably adapted.<HI>—T.</HI></NOTE>; and this structure varies infi∣nitely,

not only by shades, as in all Nature's productions, but even by steps, and sudden leaps. The enormous size of the bill of the toucan, the monstrous swelling of that of the calao, the de∣formity of that of the flamingo, the strange shape of the bill of the spoonbill, the reversed arch of that of the avoset, &amp;c. demonstrate sufficiently that all the possible figures have been traced, and every form moulded. That for completing this series nothing may be imagined wanting, the extreme of all the fashions is exhibited in the vertical blade of the Puffin's bill. It exactly resembles two very short blades of a knife ap∣plied one against the other by the edge: the tip is red, and channelled transversely with three or four little furrows, while the space near the head is smooth and tinged with blue. The two man∣dibles being joined, are almost as high as they are long, and form a triangle very nearly isoceles: the circuit of the upper mandible is edged near the head, and as it were hemmed with a ledge of a membranous or callous substance, inter∣spersed with little holes, and whose expansion forms a rose on each corner of the bill <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>M. Geoffroy de Valognes, who appears to me to be a good observer, has been so obliging as to send me the following note on the subject of the Puffin:</P>
<P><Q>"I received," says he, “a Puffin that had been taken the be∣ginning of this month (of May) in its passage on our coasts; this bird was viewed with astonishment, even by persons who oftenest frequent the sea-shore; which makes me think that it is a stranger” to this country.</Q></P> <P><Q>“The position of the legs of the Puffin near the anus leads me to presume that it walks with difficulty, and that it is more form∣ed for swimming on the water: cinereous, black, and white, are sensibly contrasted on its plumage; the first of these colours marks the cheeks, the sides of the head, the under part of the throat, where it takes a deeper shade; the second prevails on the head, the neck, the back, the wings, the tail, and extends to the throat, where it forms a broad collar, that divides at this place the gray from the pure white, which alone appears on the under side of the body, where the feathers conceal from view a thick gray down which clothes the belly: the black on the upper side of the head grows a little dilute near the origin of the neck, on the quills of the wings, and at the termination of the feathers which cover the back; on the tip of the wings there is a white border,” which is not very apparent unless they are spread.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The bill is longer than it is broad, if we measure from its origin; its form is almost triangular, the two mandibles are move∣able; the iron-gray, which partly paints it, is separated as it were by a white semi-circle from a bright red that covers the point, and completes the decoration: the upper mandible pre∣sents four streaks, the lower three, which correspond to the three last of the upper; all these streaks form a sort of semi-circles: the upper mandible has at its base a little roll, on which there are small holes disposed regularly; from some of these holes very small feathers grow; the nostrils are placed on the edges of the upper mandible, and extend three lines in the length of the bill: I perceived on the palate of the bird several rows of fleshly points directed towards the opening of the throat, of which the transpa∣rent and glossy extremity seemed to be somewhat harder than the rest; the eyes, edged with vermillion, have this peculiarity, that they occupy the centre of a gray triangular excrescence: the legs are short, and of a bright orange like the feet; the nails are black and shining, that of the hind toe is the longest and broadest.”</Q><HI>Ex∣tract of a letter from M.

<HEAD>The PENGUINS and the MAN∣CHOTS; <HI>or,</HI> The BIRDS WITHOUT WINGS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is difficult to separate in imagination the idea of bird from that of wings: yet is the faculty of flying not essential to the feathered race. Some quadrupeds are provided with wings, and some birds are destitute of them. A wing∣less bird would seem a monster produced by the neglect or oversight of nature; but what is ap∣parently a derangement, an interruption of her plan, does really fill up the order of succession, and connects the chain of existence. As she has deprived the quadruped of feet, she has also de∣prived the bird of wings; and it is remarkable that the same defect begins with the land birds, and ends in the water fowl. The ostrich may be said to have no wings, the cassowary is abso∣lutely destitute of them; it is covered with hair instead of feathers. These two great birds seem in many respects to approach the land animals; while the Penguins and Manchots appear to form the shade between birds and fish. Instead of wings they have little pinions, which might be said to be covered with scales rather than fea∣thers,
<PB N="315" REF="351"/>
and which serve as fins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They seem to form a middle species between the birds and the fishes; for the feathers, especially those of their wings, differ little from scales, and these wings, or rather pinions, must be re∣garded as fins. <HI>Cook.—</HI>The wings of these animals are without fea∣thers, and serve only as fins; they live most of their time in the water. <HI>De Gennes.—</HI>These stumps serve as fins when they are in the water. <HI>Dampier.</HI></NOTE>; their body is large, compact, and cylindrical, behind which are attached two broad oars, rather than two legs: the impossibility of advancing far into the land, the fatigue even of remaining there, other∣wise than by lying; the necessity, the habit of being almost always at sea, their whole oeco∣nomy of life, mark the analogy between the aquatic animals and these shapeless birds, stran∣gers to the regions of air, and almost equally exiled from those of the land.</P>
<P>Thus between each of the great families, be∣tween the quadrupeds, the birds, and the fishes, nature has placed connecting links that bind together the whole: she has sent forth the bat to flutter among the birds, while she has impri∣soned the armadillo in a crustaceous shell. She has moulded the whale-kind after the quadru∣ped, whose form she has only truncated in the walrus: the seal, from the land, the place of his birth, plunges into the flood, and joins the ceta∣ceous herd, to demonstrate the universal consan∣guinity of all the generations that spring from the bosom of the common mother: finally, she
<PB N="316" REF="352"/>
has produced birds partaking of the instincts and oeconomy of fishes. Such are the two fa∣milies of Penguins and Manchots, which ought however to be distinguished, as they are actually in nature, not only by conformation, but by dif∣ference of climates.</P>
<P>The name of Penguin has been given indis∣criminately to all the species of these two fami∣lies, which has introduced confusion. We may see in Ray's Synopsis what difficulties ornitho∣logists have met with to accommodate the cha∣racters ascribed by Clusius to his Magellanic Penguins, with the characters observed in the arctic Penguins. Edwards is the first who re∣conciled these contradictions: he justly remarks, that far from thinking, with Willughby, that the northern Penguin was the same species as the southern, one should rather be disposed to range them in two different classes; the latter having four toes, and the former having the traces only of the hind toe, and <HI>having its wings covered with nothing that can be called feathers;</HI> whereas the northern Penguin has very small wings, covered with real feathers.</P>
<P>To these differences we shall add another, still more essential, that, in the species of the north, the bill is furrowed with channels on the sides, and raised with a vertical blade; while, in those of the south, it is cylindrical and pointed. Thus all the <HI>Penguins</HI> of the southern voyages
<PB N="317" REF="353"/>
are <HI>Manchots</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Manchot,</HI> in French, signifies <HI>maimed.</HI> I have, for the sake of perspicuity, adopted the term.<HI>—T.</HI></NOTE>, which are distinguished from the real arctic <HI>Penguins,</HI> by essential differences in the structure, as well as by the distance of the climates.</P>
<P>We proceed to prove this position by a com∣parison of the relations of voyagers, and by an examination of the passages in which our Man∣chots are mentioned under the name of <HI>Penguins.</HI> All the navigators of the South Sea, from Nar∣borough to Admiral Anson, Commodore Byron, M. de Bougainville, Messieurs Cook and Forster, agree in ascribing to these Manchots the same characters, and all different from those of the arctic Penguins <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The most singular birds that are seen on the coast of Patago∣nia have, instead of wings, two stumps, which can be of no service but in swimming; their bill is <HI>straight</HI> like that of an <HI>albatross</HI> (which points out the elongated cylindrical form). <HI>Anson.—</HI>The Penguin, instead of wings, has two flat stumps, like the fins of fish; and its plumage is only a kind of short down...its neck is thick, its head and bill <HI>like that of a crow,</HI> except that the point turns a little downwards. <HI>Narborough.—</HI>In this country (Lobos-del-mar, in the Pacific Ocean) there are many birds, such as <HI>boobies,</HI> but especially Penguins, of which I have seen prodigious numbers in all the South Seas, on the coast of the country lately discovered, and at the Cape of Good Hope. The Penguin is a sea-bird, about as large as a duck, having its feet shaped the same, but its <HI>bill point∣ed;</HI> they do not fly, having stumps rather than wings. <HI>Dampier.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>"The genus of the <HI>Penguins</HI> (Manchots)" says Forster, “have been improperly confounded with that of the <HI>diomedea</HI> (albatross) and that of the <HI>phaëton</HI> (tropic bird). Though the
<PB N="318" REF="354"/>
thickness of the bill varies, it has the same character in all (cylindrical and pointed); ex∣cept that in some species the end of the lower mandible is truncated: their nostrils are always linear slits, which again proves them to be distinguished from the <HI>albatrosses:</HI> they all have exactly the same form of feet (three toes before, without any trace of a hind toe): the stumps of the wings are spread into fins by a membrane, and covered with plumules laid so near each other as to resemble scales; this character, as well as the shape of their bill and feet, discriminates them from the <HI>alcae</HI> (the auks or true penguins) which are unable to fly, not because their wings absolutely want feathers, but because these feathers are too short.”</Q></P>
<P>It is the Manchot, therefore, that we may par∣ticularly stile the <HI>wingless bird;</HI> and at first sight we might also call it the <HI>featherless bird.</HI> In fact, not only the hanging pinions seem covered with scales, but all the body is invested with a compressed down, exhibiting all the appearance of a thick, shaved beard, sprouting in short pen∣cils of little glossy tubes, and which form a coat of mail impenetrable by water.</P>
<P>Yet, on a close inspection, we perceive in these <HI>plumules,</HI> and even in the scales of the pinions, the structure of a feather, that is, a shaft and webs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE>. Wherefore Feuillée has reason to find
<PB N="319" REF="355"/>
fault with Frezier, for asserting, without modi∣fication, that <Q>“the Manchots were covered with hair exactly like that of sea wolves.”</Q></P>
<P>On the contrary, the northern Penguin is clothed with real feathers, short indeed, espe∣cially on the wings, but which present unequi∣vocally the appearance of feathers, and not that of hair, or down, or scales.</P>
<P>Here then is a distinction well established, and founded on essential differences in the exterior conformation of the bill, and in the plumage. The <HI>Penguins</HI> also inhabit the most northern seas, and advance only a short way into the tem∣perate zone: but the <HI>Manchots</HI> fill the vast Pa∣cific, and occur in most of the islets that are scattered through that immense ocean; they occupy, as their last asylum, the formidable range of ice, which incrusts the whole region of the south pole, and advances as far as the sixtieth and fiftieth degrees of latitude.</P>
<P><Q>"The body of the Penguins (Manchots)" says Forster, “is entirely covered with oblong <HI>plumules,</HI> thick, hard, and shining... laid as near each other as the scales of fish... this cuirass is necessary to them, as well as the thickness of fat with which they are lined, and enables them to resist the cold; for they live continually in the sea, and are confined espe∣cially to the frigid and temperate zones, at least I have never known them between the tropics.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="356"/>
According to this observer, and the illustrious Captain Cook, amidst the southern ice, where they penetrated with more intrepidity, and far∣ther than any navigator before them, Manchots were every where found, and the more nume∣rous, the higher the latitude and the colder the climate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Penguins</HI> seen in latitude 51° 50′ south. <HI>Cook.—</HI>In the latitude of 55° 16′ south, we saw many whales, <HI>Penguins,</HI> and some of the white birds. <HI>Id. vol.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 26.—In 55° 31′ south latitude, we saw some <HI>Penguins.

<P>When the shoals of ice on which the Man∣chots settle are drifted, they remain on them, and are thus transported to immense distance from land <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We found <HI>Penguins,</HI> petrels, and albatrosses, six or seven hun∣dred leagues in the middle of the South Sea.</NOTE>. <Q>"We saw," says Captain Cook, “on the summit of the ice island, which passed near us, eighty-six <HI>Penguins</HI> (Manchots).

<PB N="322" REF="358"/>
of the proximity of land, unless in latitudes where there is no floating ice.</P>

The element of the water agrees better than that of the land with their dispositions and their structure: on shore their pace is slow and heavy; as their legs are short and placed quite behind their belly, they are obliged to maintain an erect posture, and their large body extends in the same perpendi∣cular with their neck and head; <Q>“in this atti∣tude," says Sir John Narborough, "they would be taken at a distance for young chil∣dren with white bibs <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They walked erect, letting their sins hang like arms; so that at a distance they might be taken for pygmies. <HI>Dampier.</HI></NOTE>.”</Q></P>

<P>Though the Manchots lay but two eggs, or three at most, or even only one <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Forster.</NOTE>, yet as they are never disturbed on the desert lands where they assemble, and of which they are the sole and peaceful possessors, they are very numerous. <Q>"We went ashore on an island <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In sight of Port Desire, on the coast of Patagonia.</NOTE>," says Narbo∣rough, “where we caught three hundred <HI>Pen∣guins</HI> (Manchots) in the space of a quarter of an hour. We could as easily have taken three thousand, had the boat been capable of holding them. We drove them before us in flocks, and knocked them on the head with a stick.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>"These <HI>Penguins,</HI> (Manchots)" says Wood, “which are improperly ranked among the birds, since they have neither feathers nor wings, hatch their eggs, as I have been assured, about the end of September or the beginning of October; in that season, as many might be taken as would victual a fleet.... On our return to Port Desire, we ga∣thered about an hundred thousand of these
<PB N="324" REF="360"/>
eggs, some of which were kept on board near four months without spoiling.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>"On the 15th of January," says the com∣piler of the Voyages to the South Sea, “the vessel bore towards the <HI>great isle of Penguins,</HI> for the purpose of catching these birds. In fact, we found there such prodigious numbers, that they might have supplied five-and-twenty ships, and we took nine hundred in two hours.”</Q></P>

The taking of them afforded much diversion; indeed nothing could be more amusing, whether pursuing them, intercepting them as they want to gain their burrows, when they often tumble in to the holes, or surrounding them and knocking them on the head with sticks, for blows on the rest of the body will not kill them, and besides will blemish the flesh, which is to be preserved salted....

They come on shore to pass the night and to breed; the impossibility of their flying, and the difficulty of their running, expose them to the mercy of those who chance to land on their retreats, and they are run down; the defect of their structure, which incapacitates them from avoiding their enemies, has made them be regarded as stupid creatures, in∣attentive even to self-preservation: they are never found in places inhabited, and they never can; for, being incapable of resistance or escape, they must quickly disappear, wherever destructive man shall fix his abode, who permits nothing to subsist that he can ex∣tirpate.”</Q></NOTE>. But these
<PB N="328" REF="364"/>
places excepted, we may say with Forster, that in general the tropic is the limit which the Man∣chots have seldom passed, and that the bulk of them affect the high and cold latitudes of the South Sea.</P>
<P>The true Penguins also, those of the north, seem to prefer the icy sea, though they sometimes descend as far as the Isle of Wight to breed: however, the Feroe Islands and the coasts of Nor∣way, seem to be their native territory in the an∣cient continent; and Greenland, Labrador, and Newfoundland, that in the new. Like the Man∣chots, they are entirely destitute of the power of flying, having only small ends of wings, covered indeed with feathers, but these so short as to be fit only for fluttering.</P>
<P>The Penguins, like the Manchots, remain almost constantly on sea, and seldom come to land but to nestle or rest; they lie squat, it being equally painful for them to walk or to stand erect, though their legs are rather taller, and placed not quite so much behind the body as in the Man∣chots.</P>
<P>In fine, the analogy in their instinct, their mode of life, and their mutilated truncated shape,
<PB N="329" REF="365"/>
is such between these two families, notwithstand∣ing the characteristic differences which discrimi∣nate them, that in producing them nature seems evidently to have banished to the extremities of the globe these extremes of the feathered kind; in the same manner as she has banished to those retreats the great amphibious animals, the ex∣tremes of the quadrupeds, the seals and the wal∣russes; unfinished, mutilated forms, incapable of figuring in the animated scene among the more perfect models, and exiled into the remote con∣fines of the world.</P>

<P>THOUGH this first Penguin is furnished with wings of some length, and with several little feathers, we are assured that it cannot fly, nor even rise from the water <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE>. The head, the neck, and the whole of the upper side of the body, are black; but the under side, which is immersed in the water when it swims, is entirely white. A little streak of white runs from the bill to the eye, and a similar streak crosses the wing ob∣liquely.</P>
<P>We have said that the feet of the Penguin has only three toes, and that this conformation, as

well as that of the bill, distinguishes it very ma∣nifestly from the Manchot. The bill of this first Penguin is black, sharp at the edges, very flat on the sides, which are channelled with three furrows, of which the middle one is white: just at its aperture, and under the down that covers the base of the bill, the nostrils appear in long slits. The female wants the little white streak between the bill and the eye, but its throat is white.</P>
<P><Q>"This Penguin," says Edwards, “occurs equally in the northern parts of America and of Europe. It comes to breed on the Feroe Islands <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoierus.</NOTE>, along the west of England <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>, and on the Isle of Wight <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE>, where it augments the multitude of sea-fowl that inhabit the great rocks, called <HI>the Needles.”</HI></Q> We are assured, that it lays only one egg <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE>, which is very large in proportion to the size of the bird <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is still uncertain in what asylum the Pen∣guins, especially the present, pass the winter <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>. As they cannot hold out on the sea in the depth of that season, and never appear then on shore, nor retire to southern climates, Edwards supposes that they pass the winter in the caverns of rocks, which open under water, but rise internally as much above the level of the flood as to admit a recess, where the Penguins remain torpid, and live upon their abundant fat.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="370"/>
We should add, from Pontoppidan, some par∣ticulars concerning this species; that it is a great catcher of herrings, that it bites hooks baited with these fish, &amp;c. if the account given by that writer did not betray the same inconsistencies that appear in his other narrations; for instance, he says, <Q>“that when these birds issue from the caverns where they shelter themselves and nestle, they darken the sun by their number, and make with their wings a noise like that of a tempest.”</Q> This assertion applies not to the Penguins, which at most can only flutter.</P>
<P>We recognize the Penguin in the <HI>esarokitsok,</HI> or <HI>little wing</HI> of the Greenlanders; <Q>“a kind of diver," says the narrator, "which has wings at most only half a foot long, and so scantily feathered that it cannot fly; its legs too are placed so far back, that one cannot conceive how it is able to stand erect and walk.”</Q> In fact, the erect attitude is painful to the Penguin; its pace is heavy and sluggish, and its ordinary posture is that of swimming or floating on the water, or lying stretched on the rocks or on the ice. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Auk, <HI>Alca Torda:</HI> <Q>“Its bill is marked with four furrows, a white line on either side between the bill and the eyes.”</Q> The length is eighteen inches; the alar ex∣tent twenty-seven; the weight twenty-three ounces.

<P>WILLUGHBY says, that the size of this Penguin approaches that of the goose. He must mean the height of its head, and not the bulk of its body, which is much more slender than in the goose. The head, the neck, and the whole mantle, are of a fine black, with little short feathers, soft and glossy like sattin: a great oval white spot appears between the bill and the eye, and the margin of this spot rises like a rim on each side of the top of the head, which is very flat: the bill, which, according to Edwards' comparison, resembles the end of a broad cutlass, has its sides flat and hollowed with notches: the greatest feathers of the wings exceed not three inches in length. We may easily judge, that
<PB N="334" REF="373"/>

<PB N="336" REF="375"/>
rate its bill is different from that of the Penguin. The place, too, where Belon observed it, the Cre∣tan Sea, throws in our way an additional doubt; since the Penquins never advance to the Medi∣terranean, and are all represented as peculiar to the northern seas. In short, if we durst in this instance suspect the accuracy of an observer so well-informed, and so uniformly exact as Belon, we should infer, notwithstanding what he says concerning the structure of the feet of his Cre∣tan <HI>uttamaria,</HI> that it belongs rather to some species of diver or grebe, than to the family of Penguins. However, we cannot but transcribe the relation by our old and learned naturalist, who is the original author from whom Dapper and Aldrovandus have drawn their account of this bird.</P>
<P><Q>"There is," says he, “in Crete, a particular sort of Sea-Diver, swimming beneath the sur∣face, different from the cormorant and the other divers called <HI>mergi,</HI> and which I con∣ceive to be what Aristotle has termed <HI>aethia.</HI> The inhabitants on the Cretan shore call it <HI>uuttamaria</HI> and <HI>calicatczu.</HI> It is of the size of a garganey, white below the belly, and black over the whole upper side of the body. It has no spur behind, and it is likewise the only one of all the flat-footed birds which has that pro∣perty: its bill is very sharp at the edges, black above, white below; hollow, and as it were flat, and covered with down a good way
<PB N="337" REF="376"/>
forward... which is occasioned by a tuft of feathers that grows upon something over the bill joining the head, raised like a half walnut ...The top of the head is broad, but the tail is so short, that it seems like a point; it is en∣tirely covered with fine down, which adheres so close to the skin, that it might justly be looked upon as hair, and seems as delicate as velvet; insomuch that when flayed the skin is found to be very thick, and, if curried, it re∣sembles the skin of some land animal.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Black-billed Auk, <HI>Alca Pica:</HI> <Q>“Its bill is smooth and compressed; all the under side of the body, and the tips of the posterior wing-quills, are white; its legs red.”</Q> Its length is eighteen inches and a half; its weight eighteen ounces. This species is very common in Greenland, where they breed on the cliffs. They feed on marine infects, and grow very fat. In win∣ter they pass the day in the bays, but in the evening retire to the sea. The Greenlanders eat their flesh half putrid, suck their raw fat, and clothe themselves with their skins.

<P>CLUSIUS seems to attribute the discovery of the Manchots to the Dutch, who performed in 1598 a voyage to the South Sea. <Q>“These navigators," says he, "having touched at cer∣tain islands near Port Desire, found them full of a kind of unknown birds, which had come there to nestle: they called these birds <HI>pin∣guins,</HI> on account of their fatness <HI>(pinguedo)</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This derivation is adopted by Dr. Grew; and Messrs. Pennant and Latham have gone so far, to favour that conjecture, as to alter the usual spelling into pinguin. But is it in the smallest degree pro∣bable, that illiterate sailors would think of bestowing a Latin name on a new object? And even admitting this, they would have called the bird <HI>pingued,</HI> not <HI>pinguin,</HI> surely, far less <HI>penguin,</HI> which is how∣ever the original orthography. A word of a similar sound signifies <HI>white head</HI> in Welch; and some authors have alledged this acciden∣tal coincidence as a further proof that a colony was carried from Wales to America. To this opinion Butler alludes in his Hudibras:</P>
<Q>"British Indians named from penguins."</Q>
<P>—But it appears that, in the northern languages, the great auk has the name of penguin, which the Dutch must have learnt in their frequent voyages to the Whale-fishery; when they met with a simi∣lar bird, therefore, on the coast of Patagonia, they would naturally bestow upon it the same appellation.<HI>—T.</HI></P></NOTE>,
<PB N="339" REF="378"/>
and named these islands <HI>the islands of pin∣guins.”</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>These singular birds," adds Clusius, “have no wings, but in their stead two membranes that hang on each side like little arms; their neck is thick and short; their skin is hard and thick like hog's leather. They were found three or four in a hole: the young ones weighed ten or twelve pounds, but the adults reached to sixteen pounds, and, in general, they were of the bulk of the goose.”</Q></P>
<P>From these proportions, it is easy to recognize the Manchot represented in the <HI>Planches Enlu∣minées</HI> under the name of <HI>the Manchot of the Ma∣louine islands,</HI> and which occurs not only in the whole of the Straits of Magellan and the adja∣cent islands, but also at New Holland, from whence it has stretched to New Guinea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sonneart.</NOTE>. It is indeed the largest of the Manchots; and the individual which we directed to be engraved, was twenty-three inches high: they attain to a much greater size; for Forster found several that mea∣sured thirty-nine inches, and weighed thirty pounds <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Forster.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>“Divers flocks of these penguins, the largest I ever saw, wandered on the coast (of New Georgia): their belly was of an enormous bulk, and covered with a large quantity of fat; they have on each side of the head a spot of bright yellow or orange-colour, edged with black; all
<PB N="340" REF="379"/>
the back is of a blackish gray; the belly, the under side of the pinions, and the fore part of the body, are white. They were so stupid that they made no effort to escape, and we knocked them down with sticks... These are, I think, what the English have termed at the Falkland Islands, <HI>yellow penguins</HI> or <HI>king penguins.”</HI></Q></P>
<P>This description of Forster agrees exactly with our Great Manchot, observing only, that a bluish tint is spread on its cinereous mantle, and that the yellow of its throat is rather lemon or straw-colour than orange. The French, indeed, found it in the Falkland or Malouine Islands; and Bougainville speaks of it in the following terms. <Q>“It loves solitude and sequestered re∣treats: its bill is longer and more slender than in the other kinds of Manchots, and its back is of a lighter blue; its belly is of a dazzling whiteness; a jonquil tippet, which rising from the head intersects these white and blue (gray-blue) spaces, and terminates on the stomach, gives it a great air of magnificence: when it screams it stretches out its neck... We hoped to be able to carry it to Europe: at first it grew so tame as to distinguish and follow the person who had the charge of feeding it; and it ate indifferently bread, flesh, or fish. But this diet was not sufficient; it absorbed its fat, became excessively emaciated, and died.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Patagonian Penguin, <HI>Aptenodytes Patachonica:</HI> "Its bill and legs are black; a gold spot on the ears." This is rather a scarce species. They lay in the end of September or the beginning of October.

<P>OF all the characters which might be em∣ployed to denominate this second species of Manchot, we have pitched on the size as the most constant and discriminating. It is what Edwards calls <HI>the black-footed penguin;</HI> but the feet of the great Manchot are black likewise. It appears in the <HI>Planches Enluminées</HI> under the name of <HI>the Manchot of the Cape of Good Hope,</HI> or of <HI>the Hottentots.</HI> But the species occurs in other places beside the Cape, and is met with also on the South Seas. We had thought of calling it <HI>the collared Manchot;</HI> and in fact the black mantle of the back encircles the fore part
<PB N="342" REF="381"/>
of the neck by a collar, and sends off upon the sides two long bands after the manner of a sca∣pulary: but this livery appears not to be con∣stant except in the male, and the female has scarce some obscure trace of a collar. In both, the bill is coloured near the tip by a little yellow band, which perhaps depends on the age. So that we can denominate it only from its size, which is about the average in this genus, seldom ever exceeding a foot and an half.</P>
<P>All the upper surface of the body is slaty, that is of a blackish ash-colour; and the fore part, with the sides of the body, are of a fine white, except the collar and the scapulary; the end of the lower mandible seems a little truncated, and the fourth toe, though free and not attached to the membrane, is turned more before than be∣hind; the pinion is all flat, and looks as if co∣vered with a shagreen, the pencils of feathers which clothe it are so little, stiff, and pressed, the largest of these plumules is not half an inch long, and according to Edwards' remark, above an hundred may be counted in the first row of the wing.</P>
<P>These Manchots are very numerous at the Cape of Good Hope <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There were at the Cape of Good Hope birds called <HI>penguins</HI> in great numbers, which are as large as a pretty small <HI>goose;</HI> their body is covered with small feathers; their wings are like those of a duck after the feathers are plucked: they cannot fly, but they swim very well, and dive still better; they are frightened at the sight of men, and endeavour to escape, but they may be easily caught by running: each female lays two eggs as large as those of a goose; they make their nest among the brambles, scraping in the sand and forming a hole, in which they lurk so close, that, in passing along, one can hardly perceive them; they bite very strong when they are near a person who is off his guard;—they are spotted with black and white. <HI>Recueil des Voyages qui ont servi à l'etablissement de la Compagnie des Indes Orientales, tom.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 581; <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> 1702.—The birds which are the most frequent in this bay (of Saldana) are the <HI>penguins;</HI> they do not fly, and their wings assist them only in swimming; they swim as fast in the sea as other birds fly in the air, <HI>Flaccourt.—</HI>We called a little island, which is four leagues beyond the Cape of Good Hope, <HI>the island of birds,</HI> on account of the great number and different species that were on it; there are <HI>penguins</HI> differing only from those which occur in the Straits of Magellan, in that their bill is straight like that of a <HI>heron,</HI> and not bent back as in the others; they are about the size of a goose, weighing six∣teen pounds; their back is covered with black feathers; their belly with white; their neck is short and thick, with a white collar; their skin is very thick, and they have small pinions like leather, which hang as small arms covered with small stiff feathers, white, and in∣termixed with black, which serve them to swim and not to fly; they seldom come on shore, unless it be to lay their eggs and hatch; their tail is short, their feet black and flat; they conceal themselves in holes which they make on the brink of the sea, never more than two at once; they lay on the ground, and hatch only two eggs, which are about the bulk of those of turkies. <HI>Cauche.—</HI>At Aguada de San Bras, twenty-five leagues from the Cape, is a small island or a great rock, where is a multitude of birds called <HI>penguins,</HI> about the size of a gosling; they have no wings, or at least these are so small and so short, as to resemble more the shaggy skin of a beast than wings; but instead of wings, they have a feathered fin with which they swim; they suffer themselves to be taken without mak∣ing an effort to escape, a proof that they see few men or none at all; when one is killed, the skin is found to be so hard that a sabre can scarce cut any part but the head. There were also on this, rock many sea-dogs, which made resistance to the sailors: we kill∣ed some of them, but neither the dogs nor the birds were good to eat. <HI>Recueil des Voyages qui ont servi à l'etablissement de la Com∣pagnie, tom.</HI> i. <HI>pp.</HI> 213 &amp; 214.</NOTE>, and in the adjacent la∣titudes.
<PB N="343" REF="382"/>
The Viscount de Querhoënt observed them off the Cape, and communicated to me
<PB N="344" REF="383"/>
the following note: <Q>“The penguins (Manchots) of the Cape are black and white, and of the bulk of a duck; their eggs are white, two at each hatch, and they defend their brood cou∣rageously: they nestle on the islets along the coast; and an observer of credit assured me, that in one of these was a raised knoll, which these birds preferred, though more than half a league from the sea. As they walk slowly, he thinks it impossible that they should every day resort to the sea for food. He took some therefore to try how long they could live without sustenance; he kept them a fortnight without any thing to eat or drink, and at the end of that time they were still alive, and so stout, that they bit keenly.”</Q></P>
<P>M. de Pages, in the manuscript relation of his voyage towards the South Pole, agrees with respect to these facts. <Q>“The size of the Cape Manchots," says he, "is equal to that of our largest ducks: they have two oblong cravats of a black colour, the one on the stomach, the other on the neck. We found commonly in the nest two eggs or two young ones, laid head to tail, the one always a fourth at least bigger than the other. The adults were as easy to take as the young: they could walk
<PB N="345" REF="384"/>
only slowly, and sought to lie among the rocks.”</Q></P>
<P>This voyager adds a curious fact, that the Manchots use their pinions from time to time as fore-feet, and then they go faster, walking as it were on four. But in all probability this is a sort of tumbling, and not a real walk.</P>
<P>This middle species seems to be the second of those described by Bougainville at the Ma∣louine islands; for he says, that it is the same with that of Admiral Anson <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the east coast of Patagonia, we found immense troops of seals, and a great variety of sea-fowl, of which the most singular were the <HI>penguins;</HI> they are of the size and nearly of the figure of a goose; but instead of wings they have two stumps, which are of no use to them but in swimming; when they stand or walk, they hold their body erect, and not in a situation nearly horizontal like the other birds. This peculiarity joined to their having a white belly, suggested to Sir John Narborough the whimsical idea of com∣paring them to children standing with white bibs. <HI>Anson.</HI></NOTE>, which is also that of Narborough: but from the weight and colours which Narborough ascribes to his pen∣guin, we may regard it as the same with the spe∣cies in question <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It weighs about eight pounds; its head and back are black, its neck and belly white, and the rest of its body blackish; its legs are as short as those of a goose; when there are many in flocks, and seen at a distance, one would suppose them to be children dressed in white; it bites very hard, but is not at all shy, for they came in whole flocks about our boats, where we easily killed them one after another, striking them on the head. <HI>Narborough.</HI></NOTE>. It seems also to be that which Forster describes as the most common in the Straits of Magellan, and which he says is of the bulk of a little goose, and stiled by the English at the Falkland Islands the <HI>jumping Jack.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="385"/>
Forster observed these Manchots at Staten∣land, where he had a little adventure with them: <Q>"They were," says he, “in a profound sleep, for Dr. Sparrmann lighted on one, which he rolled several yards without waking it: to rouse them from their slumber, we were ob∣liged to jog them repeatedly. At length they rose in flocks, and when they saw that we surrounded them, they took courage, darted with violence upon us, and bit our legs and our clothes. After leaving a great number apparently dead on the field of battle, we chased the rest, but the first started suddenly, and paced gravely behind us.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Cape Penguin, <HI>Aptenodytes De∣mersa:</HI> <Q>“Its bill and legs are black; its eye-brows, and the bar on its breast, are white.”</Q></NOTE></P>

<P>THIS Manchot is scarcely a foot and half high from the bill to the feet, and nearly as much when, its head and body extended, it sits
<PB N="347" REF="386"/>
on its rump, which is necessarily its posture on land: its bill is red, and so is its iris, over the eye there passes a white line tinged with yellow, which dilates and expands behind into two little tufts of bristled filaments, that rise from both sides of the top of the head; this part is black, or of a very deep blackish ash-colour, as well as the throat, the face, the upper side of the neck, of the back, and of the pinions; all the fore side of the body is of a snowy white.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Planches Enluminées</HI> this bird is indi∣cated under the name of <HI>Siberian Manchot:</HI> we no longer retain that denomination, since nature seems to have marked the great division of the northern penguins and the southern Manchots; and as M. Bougainville has discovered it on the <HI>Terra Magellanica,</HI> we suspect that it is not found in Siberia, but only in the islands of the South Sea, where the same navigator has de∣scribed them under the name of <HI>hopping penguin.</HI> <Q>"The third species of these half birds," says he, “lives in families like the second, on the high rocks where they lay. The characters which distinguish these from the two others are their smallness, their fulvous colour, a tuft of gold∣coloured feathers shorter than those of the <HI>egrets,</HI> and which they erect when angry; and lastly, other little feathers of the same colour, which serve as eye-brows. They are called <HI>hopping penguins:</HI> in fact, they move by leaps
<PB N="348" REF="387"/>
and springs. This species has more liveliness in its mien than the two others.”</Q></P>
<P>It is, in all probability, the same crested and red-billed Hopping Manchot that Captain Cook alludes to in the following passage: <Q>“Hi∣therto (in lat. 53° 57′ south) we had continu∣ally round the ship a great number of <HI>penguins,</HI> which seemed to be different from those we saw near the ice; they were smaller, with reddish bills and brown heads. The meeting with such a multitude of these birds gave me some hope of finding land.”</Q> And in another place ... <Q>“On the 2d of December, lat. 48° 23′ south, long. 179° 16′, we observed several red∣billed penguins which continued with us next day.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Crested Penguin, <HI>Aptenodytes Chrysocome:</HI> <Q>“Its bill is rusous-brown; its legs yellowish; the crest on its front deep black and erect, a deflected tuft from the ear of a sulphur-colour.”</Q> Its length is twenty-three inches.

<P><HI>Catarractes.</HI> Briss.</P>
<P><HI>The Red-footed Penguin.</HI> Edw. and Lath.</P></Q>
<P>THE bill of the Manchots usually terminates in a point. In this species the extremity of the lower mandible is truncated. This cha∣racter seemed sufficient to Brisson for constitut∣ing a distinct genus under the denomination of <HI>gorfou,</HI> of which he was completely master ac∣cording to the hypothetical and systematical or∣der of his divisions: but it was not a matter equally arbitrary to apply to the same Manchot the name of <HI>Catarractes</HI> or <HI>Catarracta,</HI> by which Aristotle denoted an aquatic bird of prey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Anim.</HI> lib. ix. 12.</NOTE>, which was certainly not a Manchot, with which Aris∣totle must have been totally unacquainted.</P>
<P>However, Edwards, to whom we owe our knowledge of this species, applies to it this pas∣sage of Sir Thomas Roe, in his voyage to In∣dia: <Q>“On the isle of Penguins (at the Cape of
<PB N="350" REF="389"/>
Good Hope) is a sort of fowl of that name that goes upright; his wings without feathers, hanging down like sleeves faced with white; they do not fly, but walk in companies, keep∣ing regularly their own quarters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Churchill's Coll. of Voyages, <HI>vol.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 767.</NOTE>.”</Q></P>
<P>Yet Edwards does not inform us if this Man∣chot be an inhabitant of the Cape, rather than of the Straits of Magellan. It was, he says, <HI>as large as a goose;</HI> its bill was open as far as the eyes, and red, as well as the feet; the face was of a dull brown; all the fore side of the body was white; the hind part of the head, the top of the neck, and the back, were of a dull purple, and covered with very little feathers stiff and close: <Q>"These feathers," adds Edwards, “resemble more the scales of a serpent than feathers; the wings," he continues, "are small and flat like brown plates, and covered with feathers so lit∣tle and so stiff, that at some distance they might be taken for shagreen: there is no ap∣pearance of tail, but some short and black bristles at the rump.”</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Red-footed Penguin, <HI>Aptenodytes Catarractes:</HI> "Its bill and legs are red; its head brown."—Our reader will find a full and distinct description of the penguins, with an excellent figure, by Mr. Pennant, in the Philosophical Trans∣actions for 1768.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="390"/>
SUCH are the four species of Manchots which we could exhibit as known and well described. If this genus is more numerous, as Forster seems to insinuate, each new species will naturally as∣sume its place. Meanwhile we shall remark some that are mentioned, though imperfectly and confusedly, in the following notes:</P>
<P N="1">I. <Q>"Of the Maldive isles," says one of our old voyagers, “a prodigious number are uninha∣bited ... and others covered with large crabs, and a croud of birds called <HI>pingui,</HI> which lay and breed in these retreats. Their multitude is so astonishing, that one cannot any where set a foot without trampling on their eggs and young, or the birds themselves. The islanders will not eat them, though they are very palatable, <HI>and are of the size of pigeons,</HI> with a white and black plumage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de François Pyrard de Laval; <HI>Paris,</HI> 1619, <HI>tom.</HI> i.</NOTE>.”</Q></P>
<P>We are unacquainted with this species of Manchot as small as a pigeon, and yet a similar small species of wingless bird, under the name of <HI>calcamar,</HI> occurs on the coast of Brazil. <Q>“The calcamar is of the bulk of a pigeon; its wings are of no assistance to it in flying, but it swims very nimbly: it never leaves the water; the
<PB N="352" REF="391"/>
Brazilians assert even that it there deposits its eggs, but do not explain how it could hatch them on the water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Gen. des Voy. <HI>tom.</HI> xiv. <HI>p.</HI> 303.</NOTE>.”</Q></P>
<P N="2">II. <Q>The <HI>aponars</HI> or <HI>aponats</HI> of Thevet <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Singularités de la France Antarctique, par André Thevet; <HI>Paris,</HI> 1558, <HI>p.</HI> 40.</NOTE>, "which," says he, “have little wings, by which reason they cannot fly; their belly is white, their back black, their bill similar to that of a cormorant or a raven, and when they cry, it is like the grunting of hogs.”</Q> These are in all probability Manchots. Thevet found them on the island of Ascension: but under the name of <HI>aponar,</HI> he makes the same confusion with what has happened under that of penguin; for he speaks of <HI>aponars which ships meet with in sailing from France to Canada.</HI> These last are penguins.</P>
<P N="3">III. The bird bird of the South Seas, which Cap∣tain Wallis's people, and afterwards Captain Cook's, called the <HI>race-horse,</HI> because it ran on the water very swiftly, striking the surface with its feet and wings, which are too small for its flying. This bird seems from these charac∣ters to be a Manchot; yet Forster denominates it the <HI>logger-head duck</HI> in the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. lxvi. Part 1. He thus speaks: <Q>“It resembled a duck, except in the extreme shortness of its wings, and in its bulk, which
<PB N="353" REF="392"/>
is that of a goose; its plumage was gray, with a few white feathers; its bill and legs yellow, and two large scaly bumps of the same colour at the joint of each wing. Our sailors called it race-horse, on account of its swiftness; but in the Falkland Islands the English have given it the name of <HI>logger-head duck.”</HI></Q></P>
<P N="4">IV. Lastly, according to other voyagers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anson and Wager.</NOTE> there is found on the islands of the Chilian coast, beyond Chiloë, and towards the Straits of Ma∣gellan, a <Q>“species of goose which does not fly, but runs on the water as nimbly as others fly. This bird has a very fine down, which the American women spin, and make it into co∣verlets, which they sell to the Spaniards.”</Q> If these particulars are to be depended on, they in∣dicate a species between the large feathered birds and the Manchots with scaly feathers, which bear little resemblance to down, and seem not capable of being spun.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES AND HINTS OF CERTAIN SPECIES OF BIRDS THAT ARE UNCERTAIN OR UNKNOWN.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the pains that we have taken, through the whole of this Work, to discuss, elucidate, and refer to their true objects the imperfect or obscure indications of voyagers or naturalists, on different species, real or nomi∣nal, of birds; notwithstanding the extent and even the success of our researches, we must con∣fess, that there still remains a certain number of species which we cannot recognize with cer∣tainty, because they are mentioned under un∣known names, or exhibited with obscure or vague features, which quadrate not exactly with any real object. These names and these features, however confused, we here collect, not only to omit nothing material, but to prevent these du∣bious hints from being admitted as certain; and, above all, to set observers in the way of verify∣ing or elucidating them.</P>
<P>In this summary survey we shall follow the order of the work, beginning with the Land Birds, passing to the Waders, and concluding with the Water Fowl.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>great bird</HI> at Port Desire, on Magel∣lan's Land, which is undoubtedly a bird of prey,
<PB N="355" REF="394"/>
and seems, from the statement of Commodore Byron, to be a <HI>vultur.</HI> <Q>"The head," says he, “resembled that of an eagle, except that it had a comb upon it; round the neck there was a white ruff, exactly resembling a lady's tippet; the feathers on the back were as black as jet, and as bright as the finest polish could render that mineral; the legs were remarkably strong and large; the talons were like those of an ea∣gle, except that they were not so sharp; and the wings, when they were extended, mea∣sured, from point to point, no less than twelve feet.”</Q></P>
<P N="2">II. The bird of New Caledonia, mentioned in Captain Cook's second voyage, as <HI>a species of raven;</HI> though he says at the same time, that <HI>it is only half as large as the raven, and its feathers shaded with blue.</HI> This new-discovered island has presented but few birds, and among these <HI>beautiful turtles, and several unknown small birds.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>avis venatica</HI> of Belon, the only one perhaps which that judicious naturalist has not discriminated by his numerous observations. <Q>“We saw also (near Gaza) a bird which, in our opinion, excels all the rest by the charms of its song; and we think it was denominated by the ancients <HI>avis venatica.</HI> It is somewhat larger than a stare; its plumage is white below the belly, cinereous on the back, as in the <HI>molliceps</HI> or grosbeak: the tail is black, and
<PB N="356" REF="395"/>
extends beyond the wings, as in the magpie; it flies like the green woodpecker.”</Q></P>
<P>From the size, the colours, and the name <HI>avis venatica (hunting bird)</HI> we might take this bird to be a species of shrike; but <HI>a pleasant warble</HI> is no attribute of this mischievous and cruel species.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <Q>The <HI>sea-sparrow,</HI> “which the inhabitants of Newfoundland call the <HI>ice-bird,</HI> because it lives constantly among the ice; it is not larger than a thrush; it resembles the sparrow by its bill, and its plumage is black and white.”</Q></P>
<P><HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom.</HI> xix. <HI>p.</HI> 46.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the name of <HI>sea-sparrow,</HI> the form of its bill indicates it to be a land bird, and it seems to be a-kin to the snow bunting.</P>
<P N="5">V. The little <HI>yellow-bird,</HI> so called at the Cape of Good Hope, and which Captain Cook found in New Georgia. It is perhaps known to or∣nithologists, but not under that name. With respect to the <HI>little birds with handsome plumage,</HI> which this same navigator found at Tanna, one of the New Hebrides, we readily agree with him in opinion, that in land so remote and uncon∣nected they are absolutely new species.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The bird which the naturalists that ac∣companied Captain Cook in his first voyage denominated <HI>motacilla velificans,</HI> who saw it alight on the ship's rigging at sea, ten leagues
<PB N="357" REF="396"/>
from Cape Finisterre. We should certainly have found it to be a shepherdess, had not Lin∣naeus, whose nomenclature they follow, applied the term <HI>motacilla,</HI> as generic, to all birds that wag their tail.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The <HI>occolin</HI> of Fernandez, which should have ranged among the woodpeckers; for he expressly says, that <HI>it is a woodpecker of the size of a stare, its plumage agreeably variegated with black and yellow.</HI> Fernandez, <HI>Hist, Avi. Nov. Hisp.</HI> ccii. 54.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The birds seen by Dampier at Ceram, and which, from the form and bulk of their bill, seem to be <HI>calaos.</HI> He describes them as follows: <Q>“Their body was black, and their tail white; they were as large as a crow; their neck was pretty long, and saffron-coloured; their bill was like a ram's horn; their legs were short and strong; their feet resembled those of a pigeon, and their wings were of an ordinary size, though they made great noise in flying: they feed on wild berries, and perch upon the largest trees. Dampier found their flesh so good, that he seemed to regret his not having seen these birds except at Ceram and New Guinea.”</Q> <HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 244.</P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>The hoitzitzillin of Tepuscullula</HI> of Fer∣nandez, and the <HI>nexhoitzillin</HI> of the same au∣thor, which must be colibris; living, he says,
<PB N="358" REF="397"/>
on the honey of flowers, which they suck with their little curved bill, almost as long as their body; and with its brilliant feathers skilful hands form precious little pictures. Fernandez, clxxiv, p. 47. &amp; lxxxii. 31.</P>
<P>With respect to the <HI>hoitzitzil-papalotl</HI> of this Spanish naturalist, though he compares it to the <HI>hoitzitzillin,</HI> he says expressly that it is a sort of butterfly.</P>
<P N="10">X. The <HI>quauchichil,</HI> or <HI>little red-headed bird,</HI> also of Fernandez, cliv. p. 21. It is only some∣thing larger, he says, than the <HI>hoitzitzillin,</HI> and yet appears not to be a colibri or fly-bird, <HI>for it occurs likewise in cold countries, and lives and sings in the cage.</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. The half-aquatic bird, described by Fors∣ter, and which he says is of <HI>a new genus:</HI> <Q>“This bird, which we met with in our excursion, was of the size of a pigeon, and perfectly white; it belongs to the class of aquatic birds that <HI>wade;</HI> its feet are semi-palmated, and its eyes, and the base of its bill, are encircled with lit∣tle glands or warts: it exhaled so insupport∣able a smell, that we could not eat its flesh, though at that time we were not easily disgusted with the most unpalatable food.”</Q> (It was at Statenland). <HI>Forster's Voyage.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. The <HI>corbijeau</HI> of Page Dupratz <HI>(His∣tory of Louisiana, tom.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 128) which is no∣thing
<PB N="359" REF="398"/>
but the <HI>curlew;</HI> and we here insert the name to complete the whole system of the de∣nominations relative to this bird, and to orni∣thology in general.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The <HI>chochopitli</HI> of Fernandez, <HI>a bird,</HI> says this naturalist, <HI>of the kind of what the Spa∣niards call chorlito</HI> (which is the curlew). It seems to be <HI>the white and brown great curlew of Cayenne.</HI> This bird, Fernandez adds, is migra∣tory on the lake of Mexico, and its flesh has a disagreeable fishy taste.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. The <HI>ayaca,</HI> which, both from the simi∣larity of its name to <HI>ayaia,</HI> applied to the spoon∣bill in Brazil, and from the resemblance of its characters, except the alterations which objects always undergo in passing through the hands of the compilers of voyages, appears to be a spoon∣bill. <Q>“This Brazilian bird <HI>(ayaca)</HI> is remark∣ably diligent in catching little fish; it never darts without effect upon the water: it is of the bulk of a magpie; its plumage is white marked with red spots, and the bill is shaped like a spoon.”</Q> <HI>Hist.

<PB N="360" REF="399"/>
But, according to the remark of Adanson, it is ra∣ther a species of heron or of bittern; since <HI>it has a very long neck, which it often folds, bringing it between its shoulders.</HI> It is somewhat smaller than the wild duck; its bill is three inches long, pointed, and sharp; the ground of its plumage is white spotted with brown, browner above, and whiter below the body; the wings are of a bright and reddish fulvous, with the point black. According to Fernandez, we may tame this bird, feeding it with fish, and even flesh; and, what is not very consistent with its raucous voice, <HI>its song,</HI> he says, <HI>is not disagreeable. (Fer∣nandez, vol.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 16.) It is the same with the <HI>avis aquatica raucum sonans</HI> of Nieremberg, <HI>lib.</HI> x. 236.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The <HI>atototl,</HI> a little bird, likewise of the Mexican lake, of the form and size of a sparrow, with the plumage white on the under side of the body, varied above with white, ful∣vous, and black; which nestles in the rushes, and which from morning to evening emits a feeble cry, like the shrill squeak of a rat: its flesh is eaten. <HI>Fernandez, cap.</HI> viii. <HI>p.</HI> 15.</P>
<P>It is hard to say whether this <HI>atototl</HI> is really a shore-bird, or only an inhabitant of marshes, like the reed thrush or the sedge warbler. At any rate, it is very different from another <HI>ato∣totl,</HI> given by Faber, at the end of Hernandez' work, <HI>(p.</HI> 672.) and which is the <HI>alcatraz,</HI> or <HI>Mexican pelican.</HI></P>

XVII. <Q>The <HI>mentavaza</HI> of Madagascar, “a bird with a hooked bill, as large as a par∣tridge, which haunts the sea-shore.”</Q> The voyager Flaccourt says nothing more of it. <HI>Voy. à Madagascar, Paris,</HI> 1661, <HI>p.</HI> 165.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. The <HI>chungar</HI> of the Turks, and the <HI>kratzhot</HI> of the Russians, of which we can only transcribe the relation given by the historian of the voyages, without adopting his conjectures. <Q>"The plains of Tartary," says he, “produce numerous birds of rare beauty: that described in Abulghazi-Khan, is seemingly a species of heron, which frequents the part of the Mo∣gul's dominions which borders on China; it is entirely white, except the bill, the wings, and the tail, which are of a beautiful red; its flesh is delicate, and tastes like that of the hazel grous.”</Q> But as the author says that it is very rare, we may suppose it to be the bittern, which is in fact very rare in Russia, Siberia, and Great Tartary, but which occurs some∣times in the territories of the Mogul, near China, and which is almost always white, Abulghazi-Khan says, that its eyes, its legs, and its bill, are red; and he adds, that the head is of the same colour. He tells us, that this bird is named <HI>chungar</HI> in the Turkish language, and <HI>kratzhot</HI> in the Russian; which has led the Eng∣lish translator to conjecture that it is the same with that denominated <HI>chon-kui,</HI> in the history of Timur-Bek, and which was presented to Gengis-Khan
<PB N="362" REF="401"/>
by the ambassador of Kadjak <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Petit de la Croix remarks in the same place, that the <HI>chon-kui</HI> is a bird of prey, which is presented to the king of the country, decked with many precious stones, as a mark of homage; and that the Russians, as well as the Tartars of the Crimea, are bound by their treaties with the Ottomans to send one every year to the Porte, decorated with a certain number of diamonds.</NOTE>. <HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom.</HI> vi. <HI>p.</HI> 604.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. <Q>The <HI>obeitsok,</HI> or, the <HI>short-tongue,</HI> which is said “to be a sea-fowl of Greenland, which having scarce any tongue, preserves an eternal silence, but in compensation, it has a long bill and leg, so that it might be called the sea stork. This gluttonous bird devours an incredible number of fish, which it brings up from the depth of twenty or thirty fathoms, and which it swallows whole, though they be very large. It can be killed only when en∣gaged fishing, for it has large eyes, protu∣berant, and very vivid, crowned with a yellow and red circle.”</Q><HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom.</HI> xix. <HI>p.</HI> 45.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The <HI>tornoviarsuk</HI> of the same frozen seas of Greenland, which is a maritime bird of the size of a pigeon, and approaching the genus of the duck. It is difficult to determine the family of this bird, of which Egede says nothing more. <HI>Dict. Groënl. Hafniae,</HI> 1750.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. Besides the birds of Poland known to naturalists, and enumerated by Rzaczynski, there are some <Q>“which he knows only by the vulgar
<PB N="363" REF="402"/>
name, and which he refers to no species.”</Q> Three of these particularly seem, from their natural habits, to belong to the tribe of cloven∣footed water fowl.</P>
<P><Q>The <HI>derkacz</HI> “so called from its cry, <HI>der, der,</HI> frequently repeated. It inhabits the low and wet meadows; it approaches the size of the partridge; its legs are tall, and its bill long.”</Q> (This may be a rail).</P>
<P>The <HI>haystra,</HI> which is pretty large, of a dark brown colour, with a thick and long bill: it fishes in rivers, like the heron, and nestles on trees.</P>
<P>The third is the <HI>krzyczka,</HI> which lays spotted eggs in the rushes among bogs.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. The <HI>arau</HI> or <HI>kara</HI> of the northern seas; <Q>“it is a bird larger than a duck; its eggs are very good to eat, and its skin serves for furs: its head, neck, and back, are black; its belly blue; its bill long, <HI>straight,</HI> black, and <HI>pointed.”</HI></Q><HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom.</HI> xix. <HI>p.</HI> 270. From these characters the <HI>arau</HI> or <HI>kara</HI> must be a species of diver.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. The <HI>John-van-Ghent</HI> or <HI>John-de-Gand,</HI> of the Dutch navigators at Spitzbergen <HI>(Recueil des Voyages du Nord, tom.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 110). which, they say, is at least as large as a stork, and has the same figure; its feathers are white and black; it cuts the air without almost stir∣ring its wings; and as soon as it approaches the
<PB N="364" REF="403"/>
ice, it turns back again: it is a sort of bird cal∣culated for falconry; it darts suddenly, and from a great height, upon the water, which makes us presume that it has a very quick sight. The same birds are seen in the Spanish sea, and almost through the whole of the north sea, but chiefly near the herring fisheries.</P>
<P>This <HI>John-de-Gand</HI> seems to be the great mew or great gull, which we denominated the <HI>black mantle.</HI></P>
<P N="24">XXIV. The <HI>hav-sule,</HI> "which the Scots," says Pontoppidan, "call the <HI>gentleman;"</HI> which appears to us a species of mew or gull, per∣haps the <HI>ratzher</HI> or <HI>counsellor</HI> of the Dutch. We shall transcribe what Pontoppidan relates on this subject, though we can repose little con∣fidence in the Norwegian bishop, ever near the marvellous in his anecdotes, and far from accu∣racy in his descriptions: <Q>"This bird," says he, “serves as a sign to the herring-fishers; it ap∣pears in Norway about the end of January, when the herrings begin to enter the gulfs, and it follows them at the distance of a league from the coast. It is so greedy of this fish, that the people need only lay herrings on the edge of their boats to catch the <HI>gentlemen.</HI> This bird resembles a goose; its head and neck are like those of the stork, the bill shorter and thicker; the feathers of the back, and of the under side of the wings, are light white; it has a red crest; its head is greenish and
<PB N="365" REF="404"/>
black; its neck and breast are white.”</Q> <HI>Hist. Nat. de Norwege, par Pontoppidan; Journal Etranger, Fevrier,</HI> 1757.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. The <HI>pipelines,</HI> of which I find the name in Frezier, and <HI>which bear a resemblance,</HI> he says, <HI>to the sea-bird mauve:</HI> The mauve is the same with the mew or maw; but what he adds, <HI>that they are very well tasted,</HI> agrees not with mews, which are very bad meat.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. The <HI>margaux,</HI> of which the name used among sailors seems to denote a booby or cormorant, or perhaps both the one and the other. <Q>“The wind not being fair for coming out of Saldana Bay," says Flaccourt, we sent twice to the islet of <HI>Margaux,</HI> and each trip the boat was filled with these birds and their eggs. These birds, which are as large as a goose, are there so numerous, that, walking on shore, one cannot avoid trampling on them. When they struggle to take wing, they entangle one another. They are knocked down with a stick as they rise in the air.”</Q> <HI>Voy. a Madagascar, par Flaccourt; Paris,</HI> 1661, <HI>p.</HI> 250.</P>
<P><Q>"There were at the same <HI>island"</HI> (that <HI>of birds,</HI> near the Cape of Good Hope) says Francis Cauche, <HI>“margots,</HI> bigger than a gosling, with gray feathers, the bill hooked at the point like a hawk's; the foot small and flat, with a pellicle between the toes. They rest on the
<PB N="366" REF="405"/>
sea; they have broad wings; they make their nests in the middle of the island, among herbs, and never lay more than two eggs.”</Q> <HI>Voy. à Madagascar; Paris,</HI> 1651, <HI>p.</HI> 135.</P>
<P><Q>"In a district of the <HI>isle" (of birds,</HI> on the tract to Canada), says Sagar Theodat, “were birds living separate from one another, and very difficult to catch, for they bit like dogs; they are called <HI>margaux.”</HI> </Q><HI>Voy. au Pays des Hurons; Paris,</HI> 1632, <HI>p.</HI> 37.</P>
<P>From these circumstances we are disposed to take the <HI>margau</HI> for the shag or little cormorant, which we have described.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. These same shags appear to us to have been mentioned by several voyagers, under the name of <HI>alcatraz</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Histoire des Incas; <HI>Paris,</HI> 1744, <HI>tom.</HI> ii. <HI>p.</HI> 277.—Voyage de Coreal; <HI>Paris,</HI> 1722, <HI>tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 345.—Hist. Gen. des Voy. <HI>tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 448, <HI>&amp; tom.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 533. In the latter place it is said, that during the night the alcatraz fly as high as possible, and then, putting their head under the one wing, they support themselves some time with the other, till their body approaching the water, they resume their flight to the heavens; thus repeating frequently the same action, they may be said to sleep flying. It is scarce necessary to add, that the whole of this relation is a fable.</NOTE>, very different from the true and great alcatraz of Mexico, which is the pelican. <HI>(See the article of the pelican).</HI></P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. The <HI>fauchets,</HI> which we shall refer to the family of sea-swallows. <Q>“The commo∣tion of the elements (in a great storm),”</Q> says Forster, <Q>“never drove these birds from us; at times, a black <HI>fauchet</HI> fluttered on the agitated
<PB N="367" REF="406"/>
surface of the sea, and broke the force of the waves, by exposing itself to their action. The aspect was then threatening and terrible.”</Q> <HI>(Cook's Second Voyage.)—</HI><Q>“We perceived the high grounds (or the west entrance to the Straits of Magellan) drifted and covered with snow almost to the water's edge; but great flocks of <HI>fauchets</HI> made us hope to find re∣freshments, if we could meet with a haven.”</Q> <HI>Idem.—</HI>Fauchets, in 27° 4′ lat. south, and 103° 56′ long. west, about the first of March. <HI>Idem</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bird here alluded to is the shearwater or puffin, <HI>Procellaria Puffinus,</HI> described in the body of the work. The French transla∣tor renders <HI>shearwater</HI> by the word <HI>fauchet. T.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. The <HI>backer</HI> or <HI>pecker,</HI> of the inha∣bitants of Oëland and Gothland, which we re∣cognize more certainly to be a sea-swallow, from the particulars we learn of its instinct. <Q>“If any person goes to the place where these birds nestle, they fly round his head, and seem disposed to peck or bite him; at the same time they emit a cry, <HI>tirr, tirr,</HI> repeated in∣cessantly. The backer comes every year to Oëland, there passes the summer, and leaves that country in autumn: its nest costs it less trouble than that of the ordinary swallows; it lays two eggs, and drops them on the flat ground in the first place it meets; yet it never deposits them among tall herbs; if it lays on a sandy plain, it only excavates a little shallow
<PB N="368" REF="407"/>
hole; its eggs are of the size of pigeons', gray∣ish, and spotted with black: this bird sits four weeks; if little hens' eggs be placed un∣der her, she will hatch them in three weeks; and <HI>the chickens thus hatched are very mis∣chievous, especially the males.</HI> In the strongest wind, it can hold itself motionless in the air; and when it marks its prey, it descends swifter than an arrow, and accelerates or retards its force, according to the depth it sees the fish to be at in the water; sometimes it only dips its bill, and sometimes it plunges till the points of its wings only, and a part of its tail, appear above the surface: its plumage is gray; all the upper half of its head is pitch-black; its bill and legs are fire-coloured; its tail is like that of the swallow. When plucked it is hardly so large as a thrush.”</Q> <HI>Description of a water-fowl of the isle of Oëland; Journal Etranger, Fevrier,</HI> 1758.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. The <HI>vourousambé</HI> of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> or <HI>gri∣set,</HI> of the voyager Flaccourt <HI>(p.</HI> 165), is proba∣bly also a sea-swallow.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. The <HI>ferret</HI> of the islands Rodrigue and Maurice, which Leguat mentions in two places of his voyages. <Q>"These birds," says he, “are of the bulk and nearly of the figure of a pigeon: their general resort in the evening, was to a small islet entirely naked. We found their eggs lying on the sand, and quite near
<PB N="369" REF="408"/>
each other; yet they have only a single egg at each hatch...We carried off three or four dozens of young, and as they were very fat, we had them roasted: we found they had nearly the taste of the snipe, but we were hurt by them, and never afterwards were tempted to taste them...Having returned some days after to the island, we sound that the <HI>ferrets</HI> had forsaken their eggs and their young in the whole of the district which we had visited...The goodness of the eggs made amends for the bad quality of the flesh of the young. During our stay we ate many thou∣sands of these eggs: they are spotted like those of a pigeon.”</Q> <HI>Voyage de François Le∣guat; Amsterdam,</HI> 1708, <HI>tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 104, <HI>and tom.</HI> ii. <HI>pp.</HI> 43 &amp; 44.</P>
<P>These <HI>ferrets</HI> appear to be sea-swallows; and it would be doubly interesting to know the spe∣cies, on account of the goodness of their eggs, and of the bad quality of their flesh.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. The <HI>collier (charbonnier),</HI> so called by Bougainville, and which, from the first cha∣racters, we might take for a sea-swallow, but in the last ones, if they be exact, it seems to differ. <Q>"The <HI>collier,"</HI> says Bougainville, “is of the size of a pigeon; its plumage is of a deep gray, and the upper side of the head white encircled with a gray cord, more inclined to black than the rest of the body; the bill is slender, two inches long, and a little curved at the end; the eyes are bright, the toes yellow, resem∣bling
<PB N="370" REF="409"/>
those of ducks; the tail is abundantly furnished with feathers, rounded at the end; the wings are much cut out, and each of about eight or nine inches extent. The following days we saw many of these birds (it was in the month of January, and before his arrival at the river de la Plata).”</Q> <HI>Voyage autour du Monde, tom.</HI> i. <HI>pp.</HI> 22 &amp; 23.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. The <HI>velvet sleeves, mangas de ve∣lado,</HI> of the Portugueze, which, according to the dimensions and the characters that some give, seem to be pelicans, and, according to other notices, present more analogy to the cormorant. It is in the creek at the Cape of Good Hope, that these birds are found. They owe their name to the resemblance of their plumage to velvet <HI>(Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 248), or to their tips being velvet black <HI>(Tachard, p.</HI> 58.), and that in flying their wings appear to fold like the arm. <HI>(Hist. des Voy. ibid.)</HI> According to some, they are all white, except the end of the wing, which is black; they are as large as the swan, or, more exactly, as the goose <HI>(Merolla, in the Hist. Gen. des Voyages, tom.</HI> iv. <HI>p.</HI> 534); according to others, they are blackish above and white below. <HI>(Tachard.)</HI></P>
<P>M. de Querhoënt says, that they fly heavily, and scarcely ever leave the deep water; he be∣lieves them to be of the same genus with the <HI>margaux d'Ouessan. (Remarks made on board his Majesty's ship Victory, by the Viscount de Quer∣hoënt);</HI>
<PB N="371" REF="410"/>
but these margaux, as we have said, must be cormorants.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. <Q>The <HI>stariki</HI> and <HI>gloupichi</HI> of Steller, "which," he says, “are reckoned unlucky birds at sea; their belly is white, and the rest of their plumage is of a black, sometimes verging on blue: there are some entirely black, with a vermilion bill, and a white crest on the” head.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The last, which derive their name from their stupidity, are as large as a river-swallow. The islands, or the rocks, situated in the strait which separates Kamtschatka from America, are all covered with them. It is said, that they are black as painters' umber, with white spots over their whole body: the Kamtscha∣dales, to catch them, have only to sit near their retreat, clothed in a <HI>pelisse</HI> with hanging sleeves: when these birds come in the evening to their holes, they creep into the pelisse of” the hunter, who takes them without trouble.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"In the species of <HI>starikis</HI> and <HI>gloupichis,"</HI> adds Steller, “they reckon the <HI>kaiover</HI> or <HI>kaior,</HI> which is said to be very cunning: it is a black bird, with red bill and toes: the Cossacks call it <HI>iswoschiki,</HI> because it whistles like horse∣drivers.”</Q> <HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom.</HI> xix. <HI>p.</HI> 271.</P>
<P>Neither these characters nor these peculiari∣ties, of which a part savours of fable, are suffi∣cient to discriminate these birds.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. The <HI>tavon</HI> of the Philippines, of which the name <HI>tavon</HI> signifies, it is said, to
<PB N="372" REF="411"/>
<HI>cover with earth,</HI> because this bird lays a great number of eggs, and deposits them in the sand, with which it covers them. Its description and history, of which Gemelli Carreri was the first author <HI>(Voyage autour du Monde; Paris,</HI> 1719, <HI>tom.</HI> v. <HI>p.</HI> 286) are filled with so many incon∣gruities, that we cannot admit it into the text, but throw it into a note <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of many singular birds on these islands, the most wonderful by its properties is the <HI>tavon.</HI> It is a sea-fowl, black, and smaller than a hen, but its legs and neck pretty long; it lays its eggs on sandy ground, and these are nearly as large as those of a goose: what is most surprizing, after the young are hatched, the yolk is still found without any of the white ... the young are roasted before they are covered with feathers, and they are as good as the best pigeons. The Spaniards often eat, from the same dish, the young and the yolk of the egg; but what follows merits much more admiration: the female gathers her eggs, to the number of forty or fifty, into a small ditch, which she covers with sand, and of which the heat of the sun makes a sort of furrace: at length, when the brood have strength to shake off the shell, and open the sand to come out, she perches on the neighbouring trees; she makes several circuits round the nest, screaming with all her might, and the young, rouzed by this sound, make such motions and efforts, as to burst through every obstacle, and find their way to her. The tavons make their nests in the months of March, April and May, the time when, the sea being more placid, the waves do not rise so high as to hurt them: the sailors seek eagerly for these nests along the beach; when they find the sand thrown up, they open the spot with a stick, and take out the eggs and the young, which are equally prized. <HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom.</HI> x. <HI>p.</HI> 411.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. The <HI>parginia,</HI> a name which the Portugueze, according to Koempfer, give to a kind of bird which the Japanese call <HI>kanjemon:</HI> it is found in an island on the track from Siam to Manilla. The eggs of these birds are almost
<PB N="373" REF="412"/>
as large as hens' eggs. They are found the whole year in that island, and they proved a great resource for the subsistence of the crew in this traveller's ship. <HI>Koempfer, Hist. Nat. du Japon, tom.</HI> i. <HI>pp.</HI> 9 <HI>&amp;</HI> 10. It is obvious that this cursory mention will not ascertain the <HI>par∣ginia</HI> of the Portugueze.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. The <HI>misago</HI> or <HI>bisago,</HI> which the same Koempfer compares to a hawk <HI>(tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 113). It is scarce more recognizable than the preceding; however, we think that it should be ranged among the aquatic birds, since it feeds on fish. <Q>"The <HI>misago,"</HI> says he, “lives prin∣cipally upon fish; it makes a hole in some rock on the coasts, and there lays its prey or its provisions, which, it is remarked, preserve as well as the pickled fish, <HI>altiar;</HI> and for this reason it is called <HI>bisagonohusi,</HI> or <HI>altiar</HI> of Bisago: it tastes extremely salt, and sells very dear. Those who discover this kind of larder, may draw great profit from its store, provided they do not rob it completely at once.”</Q></P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. Finally, the <HI>azores,</HI> of which we have only this notice. <Q>“The name <HI>Azores</HI> was given to the islands, on account of the great number of birds of this kind that were seen or discovered on them.”</Q> <HI>Hist. Gen. des Voy. tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 12.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, 1.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OF SYSTEMS IN ORNITHOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>THE most valuable work transmitted from the ancients on the subject of Ornitho∣logy, is contained in Aristotle's History of Ani∣mals. That great and universal genius, assisted by the liberality of his pupil Alexander the Great, conducted the vast undertaking with ad∣mirable success. He possessed the rare faculty of acute perception; and the happy flexibility of the Greek language enabled him to mark with precision the distinguishing features of animals. Yet that philosopher affects a dry and concise stile, that frequently borders on ob∣scurity; nor is he always at sufficient pains to discuss and reject popular notions. The natural History of Pliny is a compilation which oftener displays the taste and elegance of its author than his critical discernment. Hesiod, Aelian, Co∣lumella, Aulus Gellius, and other writers, have left us some hints respecting the oeconomy of animals. The Christian fathers indulged much in turgid figurative language, and occasionally
<PB N="378" REF="416"/>
drew their comparisons from the current opi∣nions in natural history. But the sun of sci∣ence was now set, and that dismal night suc∣ceeded, which overspread the nations of Eu∣rope. After the lapse of twelve centuries, a ray of light burst in upon the Christian world; and men of the greatest abilities laboured with enthusiasm to restore the noble remains of anti∣quity. The commentators on the treatises of natural history were not in general so well qualified for acquitting themselves with credit: yet in that line of criticism, Turner, and the ce∣lebrated Joseph Scaliger, deserve applause. At this period, America had been discovered and explored, settlements formed along the coast of Africa, and an extensive intercourse established with India. From these countries were im∣ported birds of singular forms and wonderful beauty, which, while they increased the subjects of Ornithology, incited powerfully to the study of it. Prompted by a love of science, the learn∣ed and sagacious Belon travelled into Greece, and Egypt, and Asia Minor. Upon his return to France, he published his observations; but his History of Birds was not given to the world till the year after his death, in 1555. Gesner com∣posed, in 1557, a Treatise on the Birds found in Switzerland. Various other productions ap∣peared; and from all these sources, Aldrovandus, with industry and erudition, but with little taste or judgment, compiled his voluminous History
<PB N="379" REF="417"/>
of Birds, in 1599. Marcgrave's account of the birds discovered in Brazil, was published 1648. Mr. Ray, with the assistance of his friend, Francis Willugh by, Esquire, wrote a System of Ornithology in 1667, though it was not printed till 1678; a work of considerable merit. Bar∣rere published his System in 1745; Klein, in 1750; Moehring, in 1753; and Brisson, in 1760. Linnaeus attempted a classification of birds in his <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> in 1746, which he improved in his <HI>Systema Naturae,</HI> in 1758; but it has been greatly altered and enlarged in the subsequent editions. One of the neatest systems of Ornithology was composed in our own lan∣guage, by the ingenious Thomas Pennant, Es∣quire, in 1772, and published in 1781. He contents himself, however, with the outlines. We proceed to give an abstract of his method.</P>
<P>Mr. Pennant distinguishes birds into the Land Birds and the Water Fowl. The first Division comprehends six Orders. These are:</P>
<P N="1">I. The RAPACIOUS. Including three Ge∣nera:—The Vulture, the Falcon, and the Owl.</P>
<P N="2">II. The PIES. Including twenty-six Ge∣nera:—The Shrike, the Parrot, the Toucan, the Motmot, the Hornbill, the Beef-eater, the Ani, the Wattle,
<PB N="380" REF="418"/>
the Crow, the Roller, the Oriole, the Grakle, the Paradise, the Curucui, the Barbet, the Cuckoo, the Wry∣neck, the Woodpecker, the Jacamar, the Kingsfisher, the Nuthatch, the Tody, the Bee-eater, the Hoopoe, the Creeper, the Honeysucker.</P>

They inhabit the new world, and, ex∣cept two species that migrate to the north, they are all confined to South America. Their bill and feet are feeble, their nostrils minute; their tongue darts out: they have ten tail-feathers, which are bespangled with the most glowing colours: they are forward and quarrelsome; fly very swift; feed hovering upon their wings, and suck the nectar from the flowers. The whirring of their wings is louder than the notes of their voice: they are gregarious; build an elegant hemispherical nest of the woolly sub∣stance of plants, and lay two white eggs, about the size of peas, upon which the male and fe∣male sit by turns: the young ones are attacked by spiders.</P>

<P>This genus consists of twenty-eight species, which are subdivided into those with <HI>three toes,</HI> corresponding to the guillemots; those with <HI>four toes</HI> and <HI>palmated,</HI> corresponding to the divers; those with <HI>four toes</HI> and <HI>lobed,</HI> corresponding to the grebes. The birds of this genus cannot walk, but they run very swiftly on the water, and swim and dive with the utmost agility: their skin is adhesive, and their tail short. The <HI>guillemots</HI> live generally at sea; have a slender tongue, of the size of their bill, which is flat, and covered at its base with short feathers; their upper man∣dible
<PB N="402" REF="440"/>
somewhat bent at the tip: their flesh is commonly strigy, and their eggs nauseating; they keep together in flocks, and lay on the bare rocks. The <HI>divers</HI> in the northern climates in∣habit also the lakes: their bill is strong, not so sharp, cylindrical; the margin of the mandibles bent inwards, the upper mandible exceeding the under; the nostrils parted by little membranes; the tongue long, sharp, serrated on both sides at the root; the legs small and flattened; they have black stripes on their thighs, and twenty tail∣quills. They are monogamous; lay their eggs on the turf; fly difficultly, and pass the time of incubation in fresh water. The <HI>grebes</HI> have no tail; their bill is strong; their straps bald; their tongue slightly cleft at the tip; their body squat, and thickly clothed with soft shining feathers: their wings are short, their legs compressed. They inhabit chiefly the lakes of the south of Europe, and are subject to much variety of colour.</P>

<DIV3>
<P>IN his late work, the <HI>Index Ornithologicus,</HI> Mr. Latham has, upon the whole, closely fol∣lowed Linnaeus and Gmelin: I shall only mark the instances where he has ventured to differ from them.</P>
<P>In the land-birds he has added two new Or∣ders, the <HI>Columbae,</HI> and the <HI>Struthiones;</HI> in the water-fowl, he has rejected the Order of the <HI>Anseres,</HI> and revived the old division into the <HI>Pinnatipedes</HI> and the <HI>Palmipedes.</HI> So that he follows Mr. Pennant in admitting nine Orders: He thus delineates these:—</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="421" REF="461"/>
<HEAD>COLUMBAE.</HEAD>
<P>BILL somewhat straight, swelling at the base.</P>
<P>FEET ambulatory, short, the nails simple.</P>
<P>FOOD from grain, feeds, and fruits, by swallowing.</P>
<P>NEST artless, in trees and holes; two eggs; the young feed from the mother's craw. Monegamous.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>STRUTHIONES.</HEAD>
<P>BODY vast, ponderous, hardly eatable.</P>
<P>WINGS small, useless for flying, or wanting.</P>
<P>FEET cursory, strong, with various toes.</P>
<P>FOOD grain and vegetables.</P>
<P>NEST on the ground. Monogamous.</P>
<P>The Order of the <HI>Columbae</HI> contains only the pigeons: that of the <HI>Struthiones</HI> comprehends the ostrich, the cassowary, the dodo, and the touyou.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>PINNATIPEDES.</HEAD>
<P>BILL, BODY, and FOOD, as in the GRALLAE of Lin∣naeus.</P>
<P>FEET wading, thighs half naked, toes cleft, pinnated their whole length.</P>
<P>NEST large, formed of leaves and grass, in marshes. Mo∣nogamous.</P>
<P>This Order contains the phalaropes, the coots, and the grebes.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<P>PALMIPEDES, admit of a sub-division:</P>
<DIV5 N="1">
<HEAD>1. Those with long feet.</HEAD>
<P>BODY somewhat depressed, conical, the flesh of the young birds well-tasted.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="462"/>
FEET very long, wading, greatest part of the thighs naked, toes semi-palmated by a membrane.</P>
<P>FOOD in the water, from small fish and various insects.</P>
<P>NEST on land. Monogamous.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="2">
<HEAD>2. Those with short feet.</HEAD>
<P>BILL smooth, covered with an epidermis, enlarged at the tip.</P>
<P>FEET fitted for swimming, the toes palmated with a mem∣brane, the legs compressed and short.</P>
<P>BODY fat; the skin adhesive, the feathers valuable: rankish.</P>
<P>NEST oftenest on land. The mother seldom feeds the young. Generally polygamous.</P>
<P>The first sub-division includes the avosets, the courier, and the flamingos. The second sub∣division comprehends the albatrosses, the auks, the guillemots, the divers, the skimmer, the terns, the gulls, the petrels, the merganser, the swans and geese, ducks and teals, &amp;c. the pen∣guins, the pelicans, including the cormorant, the shags, the boobies, and the gannets, the tropic-birds, and the darter.</P>
<P>Mr. Latham has also made several alterations in the Genera. He has removed the genus <HI>Lanius</HI> from the order of the ACCIPITRES to that of the PICAE: and in this order he has also erected the motmot, <HI>Galbula,</HI> into a genus under the name <HI>Momotus,</HI> and the jacamar under that; and he has added the <HI>Scythrops,</HI> a bird lately brought from Botany Bay: it is thus charac∣terized: <HI>Bill</HI> large, convex, knife-shaped, hooked
<PB N="423" REF="463"/>
at the tip; <HI>nostrils</HI> rounded, naked, placed at the base of the bill; <HI>tongue</HI> cartilaginous, bifid at the tip; <HI>feet</HI> scansory. It is about the size of a raven, being twenty-seven inches long.—He has changed the name <HI>Glaucopis</HI> of a new genus into <HI>Callaeas.</HI></P>
<P>In the order of the PASSERES, he has split the numerous genus <HI>Motacilla</HI> into two, the <HI>Mo∣ticilla</HI> and the <HI>Sylvia;</HI> the former containing only the wagtails, and the latter comprehending the nightingale, the warblers, the chats, and the wrens. The genus <HI>Sylvia</HI> is thus characterized: <HI>Bill</HI> awl-shaped, straight, slender, the mandibles somewhat equal; <HI>nostrils</HI> ovalish, rather depress∣ed; <HI>outer toe</HI> connected to the mid-one at the base; <HI>tail</HI> middling-sized.</P>

<HEAD>BIRDS omitted by the COMTE DE BUFFON, or since discovered.</HEAD>
<P>THE late voyages round the world, the expe∣ditions to New South Wales, and the jour∣nies performed by Gmelin, Pallas, and Jacquin, have introduced several new species of birds, which require to be particularly noticed. Ca∣binets of Natural History furnish single speci∣mens of many others, which, though reckoned distinct species by systematic writers, are proba∣bly varieties only. The bare mention of these will suffice; or at most, some general hint of their peculiarities.—In forming this catalogue, I have followed the arrangement of Mr. Latham.</P>

<P>THE manners of the Wood Ibis, <HI>Tantalus Loculator,</HI> are well described by Mr. Bar∣tram:—<Q>“This solitary bird does not associate in flocks, but is generally seen alone; com∣monly near the banks of great rivers, in vast marshes or meadows, especially such as are caused by inundations; and also in the vast deserted rice plantations: he stands alone on the topmost limb of tall dead cypress trees; his neck contracted or drawn in upon his shoulders, and beak resting like a long scythe upon his breast: in this pensive posture and solitary situation, it looks extremely grave, sorrowful, and melancholy, as if in the deep∣est thought.”</Q> <HI>Travels in North and South Ca∣rolina, Georgia, &amp;c. p.</HI> 148.</P>
<P>THE King of the Vultures, <HI>Vultur Papa,</HI> is found also in the southern states of America. The Creek Indians, who inhabit the back coun∣try adjoining to Georgia and South Carolina,

employ the tail-feathers for constructing their royal standard. These birds seldom appear, ex∣cept when the deserts are on fire, in which case they gather from all quarters to feast on the ferpents, frogs, and lizards that are roasted in the hot embers.</P>
