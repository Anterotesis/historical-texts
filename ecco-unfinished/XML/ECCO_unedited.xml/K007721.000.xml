<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AGRICULTURE and GARDENING, though of such
great utility in producing the nutriment of mankind,
continue to be only Arts, consisting of numerous
detached facts and vague opinions, without a true
theory to connect them, or to appreciate their ana∣logy;
at a time when many parts of knowledge of
much inferior consequence have been nicely arrang∣ed,
and digested into Sciences.</P>
<P>Our imperfect acquaintance with the physiology
and economy of vegetation is the principal cause of
the great immaturity of our knowledge of Agricul∣ture,
and Gardening. I shall therefore first attempt
a theory of vegetation, deduced principally from the
experiments of Hales, Grew, Malpighi, Bonnet, Du
Hamel, Buffon, Spallanzani, Priestley, and the Phi∣losophers
of the Linnaean School, with a few obser∣vations
and opinions of my own; some of which have
in part already appeared in Zoonomia, and in the
notes to the Botanic Garden, but are here corrected
and enlarged. To the former of which works I
hope this may be esteemed a supplement, as it is pro∣perly
a continuation of the subject.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
My inducement to commence this work, after it
was suggested to me by the letters of Sir John Sin∣clair,
was a belief, that the experiments and obser∣vations
already made on the growth of plants, with
the modern improvements in chemistry, were suffi∣ciently
numerous and accurate for the establishment
of a true theory of vegetation; so much wanted to
connect the various facts in the memory, to appre∣ciate
their value, and to compare them with each
other; and finally to direct the prosecution of future
experiments to useful purposes.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE BUDS OF VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<Q>1. Vegetables are inferior animals. A bud torn from a tree will
grow; vines and hawthorns so planted. Many kinds of fruit
ingrafted on one tree. 2. The bark and branches of hollow
trees remain alive. Caudex of herbaceous plants. Caudex of
buds. 3. Which descending, form a new bark over the old one.
These bark vessels occasionally inosculate. Upper lip of wounds
of the bark grows downwards. 4. Flower-buds are indivi∣dual
beings; do not so certainly grow by inoculation as leaf-buds;
are biennial plants like leaf-buds, but die in autumn without en∣larging
the size of the tree by their progeny. 5. In what vege∣tables
differ from animals; they have not muscles of locomotion;
nor organs of digestion. 6. In what they resemble animals.
They have absorbent, umbilical, placental, and pulmonary ves∣sels,
arteries, glands, organs of reproduction, with muscles,
nerves, and brain. 7. Progress of a young bud, and of a seed.
The plumula, radicle, and caudex of a bud. 8. Buds and seeds
are biennial beings. How they differ. The disunion of the pith
distinguishes buds from each other, and thus evinces their indi∣viduality.</Q>
<P>1. WE have so accustomed ourselves to consider life and ir∣ritability
to be associated with palpable warmth and visible motion,
that we find a renitency in ourselves to ascribe them to the com∣paratively
cold and motionless fibres of plants. But to reason
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
rightly on many vegetable phenomena we shall find it necessary
first to shew, that vegetables are in reality an inferior order of
animals.</P>
<P>If a bud be torn from the branch of a tree, or cut out and
planted in the earth with a glass cup inverted over it, to pre∣vent
the exhalation from being at first greater than its power of
absorption; or if it be inserted into the bark of another tree, it
will grow, and become a plant in every respect like its parent.
This evinces that every bud of a tree is an individual vegetable
being; and that a tree therefore is a family or swarm of indi∣vidual
plants, like the polypus, with its young growing out of
its fides, or like the branching cells of the coral-insect.</P>
<P>The present most approved method of propagating vines in
hot-houses consists in cutting off a single eye of a vine-stalk with
about an inch of the stem above the eye, and two or three inches
below it; and setting this aslant in the bark-bed with the eye
about an inch or less beneath the surface, pointing upwards; and
I have seen a quickset or hawthorn hedge, cretaegus, propagated
in the same manner by planting twigs in the ground with one bud
only above the soil.</P>
<P>Mr. Barns in a treatise on Propagating Fruit-trees (1759, Bald∣win,
London) asserts, that he cut a branch into as many pieces,
as there were buds or leaves upon it; and wiping the two
wounded ends dry, he quickly applied to each a cement pre∣viously
warmed, which consisted chiefly of pitch, and planted them
in the earth with unfailing success. The use of this cement I
suspect to consist in its preventing the bud from bleeding to death,
though the author ascribes it to its antiseptic quality. And
lastly, in the inoculation and ingrafting of fruit-trees, five or six
different kinds of pears are frequently seen on the branches of
one tree, which could not then properly be termed an individual
being.</P>
<P>2. When old oaks, or willows, lose by decay almost all their
solid internal wood, it frequently happens, that a part of the
shell of the stem continues to flourish with a few healthy
branches. Whence it appears, that no part of the tree is alive
but the buds, and the bark, and the root fibres; that the bark
is only an intertexture of the caudexes of the numerous buds,
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
as they pass down to shoot their radicles into the earth; and
that the solid timber of a tree ceases to be alive; and is then
only of service to support the numerous family of buds in the air
above the herbaceous vegetables in their vicinity.</P>
<P>A bud of a tree therefore, like a vegetable arising from a
seed, consists of three parts; the plumula or leaf, the radicle or
root-fibres, and the part which joins these two together; which
is called the caudex by Linneus when applied to intire plants;
and may, therefore, be termed caudex gemmae when applied
to buds.</P>
<P>In herbaceous plants the caudex is generally a broad flat cir∣cular
plate, from which the leaf-stem ascends into the air, and
the radicles or root-fibres descend into the earth. Thus the
caudex of a plant of wheat lies between the stem and the ra∣dicles,
at the basis of the lowermost leaf, and occasionally pro∣duces
new stems and new radicles from its sides. Thus the
caudex of the tulip lies beneath the principal bulb, and gene∣rates
new smaller bulbs in the bosom of each bulb-leaf, besides
one principal or central bulb; the caudex of orchis, and of
some ranunculuses, lies above their bulbous roots; whereas the
caudexes of the buds of trees constitute the longitudinal filaments
of the bark, reaching from the plumula or apex of the bud on
the branch to the base of it, or its root-fibres beneath the soil.</P>
<P>Nor is this elongation of the caudexes of the buds of trees
unanalogous to what happens to some herbaceous plants, as in
wheat; when the grain is buried two or three inches beneath the
soil, an elongation of the caudex occurs almost up to the surface,
where another set of fibrous roots are protruded, and the up-right
stem commences. The same happens to tulip-roots when
planted too deep in the earth, as I have witnessed, and I sup∣pose
to those of many other vegetables.</P>
<P>This caudex of the buds of trees not only descends as above
described, but also ascends from each bud to that above it; as on
the long shoots of vines, willows, and briars; in this respect re∣sembling
the wires of strawberries and other creeping plants.
Thus the caudex of perennial herbaceous plants consists of a
broad plate, buried beneath the soil to protect it from the frost;
while the caudex of buds of trees consists of a long vascular cord
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
extending from the bud on the branch to the radicle beneath the
earth, and endures the winter frosts without injury.</P>
<P>3. These buds are properly biennial plants, as they are gene∣rated
in one summer, and in the next either produce seeds and
die, or produce other buds, whose caudexes form a new bark
over the former one, that of the last year first becoming a softer
or more porous wood, called alburnum, or sap-wood, and gra∣dually
hardening into solid timber, which ceases to possess vege∣table
life.</P>
<P>These long caudexes of the individual buds of trees, which
constitute their bark, are well seen in the cloth made from the
mulberry-bark brought from Otaheite. On inspecting this cloth
the long fibres are seen in some places to adhere, where it is pro∣bable
they occasionally inosculate, like some of the vessels in ani∣mal
bodies; because when some buds are cut off, the neighbour∣ing
ones flourish with greater vigour, being supplied with more
of the nutritious juices.</P>
<P>This informs us why the upper lip of an horizontal wound
made in the bark of a tree grows downwards with so much
greater expedition than the under one grows upwards to meet it;
as the descending caudexes of the individual buds are supplied
directly with nutriment from the vegetable arteries after the oxy∣genation
of the blood in their leaves; whereas the under lip of the
wound is nourished only by the lateral or inosculating vessels,
which supplies us with another argument against the individuality
of trees, and in favour of that of buds.</P>
<P>4. The buds producing flowers are each an individual being
as well as the leaf-buds above described, though they are pro∣bably
not so easily capable of transplantation into the bark of
other trees by inoculation; as, I believe, it is from the mistake
of the gardeners in choosing flower-buds instead of leaf-buds to
inoculate with, that so many buds die in this mode of propaga∣tion.
Nor does the existence of many male and female parts
in one flower destroy its individuality any more than the number
of paps of a sow or bitch, or the number of their cotyledons,
each of which during gestation belongs to a separate fetus.</P>
<P>The flower-buds as well as the leaf-buds are properly biennial
plants, as they are produced in the summer of one year, and
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
perish in the autumn of the next; but as the new buds gene∣rated
by leaf-buds continue to adhere to the parent, they are
furnished with their numerous caudexes, which form a new bark
over the old one, whereas the flower-buds generate seeds, which
when mature fall upon the ground, and thus they die in the au∣tumn
without increasing the size of the parent-tree by the adhe∣sion
of their progeny like the leaf-buds.</P>
<P>5. These buds of plants, which are each an individual vege∣table
being, in many circumstances resemble individual animals;
but as animal bodies are detached from the earth, and move from
place to place in search of food, and take that food at consider∣able
intervals of time, and prepare it for their nourishment within
their own bodies, after it is taken; it is evident, that they must
require many organs and powers, which are not necessary to a
stationary bud. As vegetables are immoveably fixed to the soil,
from whence they draw their aliment ready prepared, and this
uniformly, and not at returning intervals; it follows, that in ex∣amining
their anatomy we are not to look for muscles of loco∣motion,
as legs and arms; nor for organs to receive and prepare
their aliment as a mouth, throat, stomach, and bowels, by which
contrivances animals are enabled to live many hours without new
supplies of food from without.</P>
<P>6. The parts, which we may expect to find in the anatomy
of vegetables, which correspond to those in the animal economy,
are first a three-fold system of absorbent vessels, one branch of
which is designed to imbibe the nutritious moisture of the earth,
as the lacteals imbibe the chyle from the stomach and intestines
of animals; another to imbibe the water of the atmosphere,
opening its mouths on the cuticle of the leaves and branches,
like the cutaneous lymphatic vessels of animals; and a third to
imbibe the secreted fluids from the internal cavities of the vege∣table
system, like the cellular lymphatics of animals.</P>
<P>Secondly, in the vegetable fetus, as in feeds or buds, another
system of absorbent vessels is to be expected, which may be termed
umbilical vessels, as described in Sect. III. of this work, which
supply nutriment to the new bud or seed, similar to that of the
albumen of the egg, or the liquor amnii of the uterus; and
also another system of arterial vessels, which may be termed pla∣cental
ones, corresponding with those of the animal fetus in the
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
egg or in the womb, which supply the blood of the embryon with
due oxygenation before its nativity.</P>
<P>Thirdly, a pulmonary system correspondent to the lungs of
aerial animals, or to the gills of aquatic ones, by which the fluid
absorbed by the lacteals and lymphatics may be exposed to the
influence of the air. This is done by the leaves of plants, or the
petals of flowers; those in the air resembling lungs, and those
in the water resembling gills.</P>
<P>Fourthly, an arterial system to convey the fluid thus elaborated
to the various glands of the vegetable for the purposes of its
growth, nutrition, and secretions; and a system of veins to bring
back a part of the blood not thus expended.</P>
<P>Fifthly, the various glands which separate from the vegetable
blood the honey, wax, gum, resin, starch, sugar, essential oil,
and other secretions.</P>
<P>Sixthly, the organs adapted to the lateral or viviparous gene∣ration
of plants by buds, or to their sexual or oviparous propaga∣tion
by seeds.</P>
<P>Seventhly, longitudinal muscles to turn their leaves to the
light, and to expand or close their petals or their calyxes; and
vascular muscles to perform the absorption and circulation of
their fluids, with their attendant nerves, and a brain, or common
sensorium, belonging to each individual seed or bud; to each
of which we shall appropriate an explanatory section.</P>
<P>7. An embryon bud, therefore whether it be a leaf-bud or a
flower-bud, is the viviparous offspring of an adult leaf-bud, and
is as individual as a seed, which is its oviparous offspring. It
consists, first, of a central organization or caudex like the cor∣culum
of a seed, which contains the rudiments of arteries, veins,
absorbent vessels and glands, with an internal pith or brain.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is furnished with a system of umbilical vessels,
which are inserted into the alburnum or sap-wood of the tree,
or form a part of it, and descending into the earth supply it in
the early spring with its first nutrition, like the seminal roots, so
called, which pass from the corculum of the seed, and are spread
on the cotyledons, as seen in the garden bean, represented in
Plate I. Fig. 1. which is taken from Dr. Grew's Anatomy of
Plants.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13"/>
Thirdly, this umbilical system probably contains also what
may be termed a placental artery, terminating on the coats of the
lateral air-vessels, which penetrate the bark of trees horizontally,
for the purpose of oxygenating the blood of the vegetable fetus,
like those distributed from the umbilical vessels of the chick on
the air-bag at the broad end of the egg. See Sect. II. 4. and
III. 1—4.</P>
<P>Fourthly, it contains the rudiments of organs adapted to la∣teral
generation or the production of new buds; or to sexual pro∣pagation,
and the consequent production of seeds.</P>
<P>In the early spring the umbilical, vessels supply the embryon
buds of trees with sap-juice, which is then seen to exsude from
wounds of the alburnum, as in the vine, vitis; the birch, betula;
and the maple, acer; which I suppose to become oxygenated in
the circulation of the vegetable fetus by the horizontal air-vessels
of the bark.</P>
<P>As the season advances, the leaf-bud puts forth a plumula,
like a seed, which stimulated by the oxygen of the atmosphere
rises upwards into leaves to acquire its adapted pabulum, which
leaves constitute its lungs; it also protrudes from its long caudex,
which forms the new bark over the old one, a radicle, which
stimulated by moisture passes downwards, and descends into the
earth to acquire its adapted pabulum; and it thus becomes an
adult vegetable being with the power of producing new buds.</P>
<P>The flower-bud under similar circumstances puts forth its
bractes, or floral leaves, which serve the office of lungs to the
pericarp and calyx; and expands its petals, which serve the of∣fice
of lungs to the anthers, and stigmas, which are the sexual
organs of reproduction, and which die and fall off, when the
seed is impregnated; and thus, like the leaf-bud, it becomes an
adult vegetable being with the power of producing seeds.</P>
<P>8. As the flower-bud produces many seeds during the summer,
so the leaf-bud produces many budlets during the summer, as may
be seen in the long shoots of the vine and willow, vitis et salix.
In this climate both the buds and seeds are properly biennial ve∣getables;
that is, they are produced in one summer and perish in
the next. But the seed differs from the bud in this circumstance,
that it drops on the earth, and is thus separated from its dead
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
parent in the autumn; whereas the bud continues to adhere to
its dead parent, and grows over it as it advances.</P>
<P>Now as the internal pith of a bud appears to contain or pro∣duce
the living principle, like the brain and medulla oblongata,
or spinal marrow of animals, we have from hence a certain cri∣terion
to distinguish one bud from another, or the parent bud from
the numerous budlets, which are its offspring, as <HI>there is no com∣munication
of the internal pith between them.</HI></P>
<P>This observation was made by slitting the young branches of
horse-chesnut, aesculus hippocastanum; of ash, fraxinus; of
willow, salix; and of elder, sambucus nigra; and I plainly dis∣cerned
that there existed no communication of pith between the
lateral budlets and their parent shoots, or between the central
larger budlet at the summit of the branch, and its parent shoot.
This also afforded me one reason to conclude that the different
joints of wheat, triticum, of southistle, sonchus, and of teasel,
dypsacus, are different buds growing on each other, those at the
summit only producing seeds; because there is a division which
separates the pith contained in each joint of their hollow stems, as
is further explained in Sect. IX. 2. 4. and 3. 1. and which per∣fectly
evinces the individuality of buds.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE ABSORBENT VESSELS OF VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<Q>1. Roots, leaves, bark, sap-wood, shewn to absorb by not moisten∣ing
them, by placing them in water. 2. Absorbent vessels co∣loured
by a decoction of madder, by dilute ink. They form a ring
in the sap-wood beneath the bark, with a ring of arteries exte∣rior
to them. 3. Absorbents erroneously believed to be air-vessels,
are visibly full of sap-juice in a vine-stalk. Vegetable vessels
have rigid sides, which do not collapse, and hence become full of
air when cut; not so in animal vessels. 4. Some horizontal
vessels in trees are truly air-vessels for the embryon bud, like, the
air in the broad end of the egg. 5. Absorbent vessels consist of
long cylinders; air will pass through them either way in the dead
vegetable; are not respiratory organs, as they exist in the roots of
trees. May receive air dissolved in water. 6. Absorbent vessels
act either direct or retrogade. A forked branch in water. An
inverted tree. A suspended tree. So in the operation of an
emetic, and in ruminating cows. 7. They consist of a spiral
line without valves; and by its vermicular contraction forcibly
carry on their contained fluids either way. 8. Those of the root
act occasionally in winter; but vines in hot-houses must have
their roots guarded from frost in spring. Accumulated ice destroys
trees in spring. 9. They sometimes absorb poisonous fluids, as
spirit of wine, solution of arsenic, vitriolic acid; roots said to
creep aside from bad soil erroneous. 10. Absorbents of trees like
the receptacle of chyle.</Q>
<P>1. THE existence of that branch of the absorbent vessels of
vegetables, which resembles the lacteals of animal bodies, and
imbibes their nutriment from the moist earth, is evinced by their
growth, so long as moisture is applied to their roots, and their
quickly withering when it is withdrawn.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16"/>
Besides these absorbents in the roots of plants there are others,
which open their mouths on the external surfaces of the bark and
leaves to absorb the moisture of the atmosphere, resembling the
cutaneous lymphatics of animal bodies; the existence of these
is shewn, because a leaf plucked off and laid with its under side
on water will not wither so soon as if left in the dry air. The
same if the bark alone of a branch, which is separated from a
tree, be kept moist with water.</P>
<P>A third branch of absorbent vessels opens its mouths on the
internal surfaces of the cells and cavities of the vegetable system
to absorb the secreted fluids, after they have performed their
adapted offices, similar to the cellular lymphatics of animal bo∣dies,
as may be shewn by moistening the alburnum or sap-wood,
and the internal surface of the bark of a branch detached from a
tree, which will not then so soon wither as if left in the dry air
unmoistened.</P>
<P>Another means of demonstrating the absorbent powers of the
parts of vegetables is by inserting them into glass tubes, or into
tall narrow vessels filled with water, and observing how much▪
more rapidly the surface of the water subsides than in similar ves∣sels
by evaporation alone.</P>
<P>2. By the following experiment these vegetable absorbent ves∣sels
were made agreeably visible by a common magnifying glass,
I placed in the summer of 1781 some twigs of a fig-tree with
leaves on them, about an inch deep in a decoction of madder
(Rubia tinct), and others in a decoction of logwood (haema∣toxylum
campechense), along with some sprigs cut off from a
plant of picris. These plants were chosen because their blood is
white. After some hours, and on the next day, on taking out
either of these, and cutting off from its bottom about an eighth
of an inch of the stalk, an internal circle of red points appeared,
which I believed to be the ends of absorbent vessels coloured red
with the decoction, and which probably existed in the newly
formed alburnum, or sap-wood, while an external ring of arte∣ries
was seen to bleed out hastily a milky juice, and at once
evinced both the absorbent and arterial system.</P>
<P>Many similar experiments were made by M. Bonnet, by
placing parts of the stem or roots of various vegetables, as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
kidney-beans, peach-tree, and elder, in dilute ink; in all these
the vessels of the bark were uncoloured, and those of the pith;
but those beneath the bark, which he terms▪ woody, were co∣loured
black, which I suppose to have been the circle of absor∣bent
vessels above mentioned. Usage de Feuilles, Plate XXIX.</P>
<P>3. These absorbent vessels have been called bronchia by Mal∣pighi
and Grew, and some other philosophers, and erroneously
thought to be air-vessels; in the same manner as the arteries of
the human body were supposed to convey air by the antients, till
the great Harvey by more exact experiments and juster reasoning
evinced, that they were blood-vessels. This opinion has been
so far credited because air is seen to issue from wood, whether it
be green or dry, if it be covered with water, and placed in the
exhausted receiver of an air-pump; and these vessels have there∣fore
been supposed to constitute a vegetable respiratory organ;
but it will be shewn hereafter, that the leaves of plants are their
genuine lungs, and that the absorbent vessels and arteries become
accidentally filled with air in the dead parts of vegetables.</P>
<P>For as the vessels of vegetables are very minute, and have
rigid coats, their sides do not collapse when they are cut or
broken, as their juices flow out or exhale; they must therefore
receive air into them. This may be readily seen by inspecting
with a common lens the end of a vine-stalk two or three years
old, when cut off horizontally. At first the vessels, which are
seen between the partitions radiated from the center, appear full
of juice; but in a minute or less this juice either passes on,
or exhales; and the vessels appear empty, that is filled with air.
This experiment I have twenty times repeated with uniform suc∣cess,
and it is so easily made by hastily applying a common lens
after the division of a vine-stalk, that I think there can be no
error in it; and it is wonderful that these vessels, which are
found in the alburnum, and consist of a spiral line, whether they
may properly be called absorbent or umbilical vessels, or consist
of both, should ever have been supposed to be air-vessels.</P>
<P>There is nevertheless an experiment by Dr. Hales, which
would at first view countenance the assertion, that vegetables ab∣sorb
air. He cemented the lower end of a small twig of a tree
with leaves on it into a glass tube about four inches long, and set
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
the other end of the tube an inch deep in water, and observed in
a little time that the water rose an inch in the tube; but this must
happen from the vegetable vessels emptying themselves by the
ascent of their juices and having rigid coats, and therefore not
contracting, a portion of the air was forced into them by the
pressure of the atmosphere, as in the above observation on the
vine-branch cut horizontally.</P>
<P>This reception of air does not happen to the vessels of animal
bodies, when they are emptied of their blood, owing to the less
rigidity of their coats; whence the weight of the atmospheric
air presses their sides together, and closes the vessel, instead of
passing into it. In the same manner no air would pass into the
vessels of the lungs of animals in respiration, unless the pres∣sure
of the atmosphere on their sides was prevented by the action
of the muscles, which enlarge the cavity of the thorax by eleva∣ting
the ribs.</P>
<P>4. There are nevertheless certain horizontal vessels of large di∣ameter,
which pass through the bark of trees to the alburnum,
which probably contain air, as they are apparently empty, I be∣lieve,
in the living vegetable; for the bark of trees consists of
longitudinal fibres, which are joined together, and appear to inos∣culate
at certain distances, and recede from each other between
those distances like the meshes of a net, in which spaces several
horizontal apertures are seen to penetrate through the bark to the
alburnum, according to Malpighi, who has given a figure of
them, which is copied in Plate I. Fig. 2. of this work. Very
fine horizontal perforations through the bark of trees are also
mentioned by Duhamel, which he believes to be perspiratory or
excretory organs, but adds, that there are others of much larger
diameter, some round and some oval, and which in the birch-tree
stand prominent, and pierce the cuticle, or exterior bark.
Physique des arbres, T. 1. Tab. III. Fig. 8. and 11.</P>
<P>These vessels probably contain air during the living state of the
tree, as they pierce the external bark, which frequently consists
of many doubles, like a roll of linen cloth; as a new cuticle is
annually produced beneath the old one, like a new scarf-skin be∣neath
a blister in animal bodies; and the old one sometimes con∣tinues,
and sometimes peels off like the cuticle of a serpent, as
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
is seen on the trunks of many cherry-trees and birches. These
vessels, when contracted in dry timber, appear like horizontal
insertions in many planed boards, in which the spiral absorbent
vessels become by their contraction the longitudinal fibres, as
appears in the figure of a walking cane given by Dr. Grew,
Tab. XX.</P>
<P>These horizontal vessels I suppose to contain air inclosed in a
thin moist membrane, which may serve the purpose of oxyge∣nating
the fluid in the extremities of some fine arteries of the em∣bryon
buds, in the same manner as the air at the broad end of
the egg is believed to oxygenate the fluids in the terminations of
the placental vessels of the embryon chick, as further noticed in
Sect. III. 2. 6. and III. 1. 4.</P>
<P>5. The absorbent vessels of trees in passing down their trunks
consist of long hollow cylinders, whose sides I believe to be
composed of a spiral line, and are of such large diameters in
some vegetables as to be visible to the naked eye, when they be∣come
dry and empty, as in cane. Air will rapidly pass through
these vessels in either direction, as may be seen in lighting a cane
some inches long at either end, and drawing the smoke through
the pores of it into the mouth, as through a tobacco-pipe. Dr.
Hales readily passed both air and water through a recent vegeta∣ble
stick both upwards and downwards, by setting one end of it
in a cup of water in the receiver of an air-pump, and exhaust∣ing
the air, Veg. Stat. p. 154; whence he concludes with Grew,
that these are air-vessels or lungs for the purpose of respiration,
and that they receive atmospheric air in their natural state.</P>
<P>There is one objection to their use as air-vessels, which is,
that they have no communication with the horizontal air-vessels
above described; for by blowing forcibly through a piece of dry
cane immersed deep in water, no air is seen to bubble out of the
sides, but only from the bottom of it. It may indeed be
supposed, that the longitudinal cavities in dry cane may not
consist of the absorbent vessels above described, but of the
interstices between them, as the coats of those absorbent vessels
consisting a spiral line, may be thought to close up by their ver∣micular
contraction; and their interstices, of vegetable cel-
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
consisting of vegetable cellular membrane, may be supposed, when
dry, to become the tubes in cane. But in this case the longi∣tudinal
canals in dry cane would not be circular cylinders, whereas
they are so represented in a figure of a piece of cane much mag∣nified
by Dr. Grew, Tab. XX. who has in the same figure
given the mouths of horizontal air-vessels of circular form
and larger diameter.</P>
<P>But there is another insuperable objection to this idea of their,
use, which is, that these vessels equally exist in the roots of
plants, as in their trunks; and according to Malpighi; with
larger diameters; and probably terminate externally only in the
roots; and, as they are there not exposed to the atmosphere,
they cannot serve the purpose of respiration; air nevertheless in
its combined state, or even as dissolved in water, may be absorbed
by these vessels; and may appear, when the pressure of the at∣mosphere
is removed in the exhausted receiver; or when expanded
by heat, as is seen in the froth at one end of a green stick, when
the other end is burning in the fire.</P>
<P>6. These vegetable absorbents differ from those of animals in
the facility, with which they carry their fluids either way; for a
forked branch of a tree, torn from its trunk, and having one of
its forks with the leaves on it inverted in a vessel of water, will
continue for several days unwithered, nearly as well as if the
whole had been placed upright in the water. A willow rod on the
same account will grow almost equally well, whether the
apex or base of it be set in the ground; and Dr. Bradley, I
think, mentions a young gooseberry-tree having been taken up,
and replanted with its branches in the earth, and its roots in the
air; and that the branches put forth root-fibres, and the roots
put forth leaf-buds. There is likewise a curious experiment by
Dr. Hales, who attached the eastern branch of a young tree
to its neighbour by inarching, and its western branch to another
of its neighbours in the same manner; and after they were united,
he cut the stem of the middle tree from its root, and thus left it
hanging in the air by its two inarched arms, where it flourished
with considerable vigour.</P>
<P>This power of carrying their fluid contents in a retrograde di∣rection
is also possessed in some degree by the absorbents of ani∣mals,
particularly in their diseased state, and even in the opera∣tion
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
of an emetic, as shewn in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. 29;
and is visible in the oesophagus or throat of cows, who convey
their food first downwards, and afterward upwards by a direct
and retrograde motion of the annular cartilages, which compose
the gullet for the purpose of rumination.</P>
<P>7. The structure of these large vegetable absorbents, erro∣neously
called air-vessels, probably consists of a spiral line, and
not of a vessel interrupted with valves, and differs in this con∣struction
from animal lymphatics; for first, on breaking almost
any tender vegetable, as a last year's sprig of a rose-tree, or the
middle rib of a vine leaf, and gradually extending some of the
fibres, which adhere the longest, this spiral structure becomes
visible even to the naked eye, and distinctly so by the use of a
common lens, as is delineated in Duhamel's Phisique des arbres,
T. 1. Tab. II. Fig. 17, 18, 19, and in Plate LI. and LII. of
Grew's Anatomy of Plants (fol. edit.), and by this easy expe∣riment
both that absorbent system, which imbibes nourishment
from the earth, and brings it to the caudex of each bud; and
that which imbibes moisture from the air, and a part of the per∣spirable
matter on the surface of the leaf, and brings it to the
caudex of each bud, are agreeably demonstrated. See Plate II.
Fig. 1. And that these vessels of large diameter, with their
sides consisting of a spiral line, are not arteries or veins, is
evinced by inspecting a stem of euphorbia, spurge; or the stalk
of a fig-leaf, ficus, immediately on dividing them, as the
milky juice oozes from a ring of vessels exterior to those large
absorbents.</P>
<P>Secondly, that these vessels are not furnished with frequent
valves is countenanced by the experiments before mentioned in
No. 5 of this section, one of which consisted of lighting a piece
of cane, and drawing the smoke through it, as through a to∣bacco-pipe,
in either direction; and the other in placing a bit of
recent twig with one end of it in a cup of water in the receiver
of an air-pump, and causing both air and water to pass through it
in either direction.</P>
<P>If the minuter branches of vegetable absorbents be of a similar
structure, it is easy to conceive how a vermicular or peristaltic
motion of the vessel, beginning at the lowest part of it, each
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
spiral ring successively contracting itself, <HI>till it fills up the tube,</HI>
must forcibly push forward its contents without the aid of valves;
and if this vermicular motion should begin at the upper end of the
vessel it must with equal facility carry its contained fluid in a re∣trograde
or contrary direction.</P>
<P>8. As the absorbent vessels in the roots of plants are protected
from the frost in some degree by the earth which covers them;
they seem at all times to be sufficiently alive to drink up and push
forwards their adapted fluid, since if a branch of a tree is brought
into a warm room, it will in general pullulate in the winter, as
soon as the vessels of the upper part of the branch are rendered
sufficiently irritable by warmth to act in concert with the absor∣bents
of the root. Nevertheless, in severe frosts it is necessary to
guard all the parts of the stem which is exposed to the open air,
as is experienced in the vines brought through holes into hot∣houses,
otherwise after the buds are put out a severe frost so af∣fects
the stems on the outside of the house as to destroy all the
fruit of the year. Kenedy on Gardening, Vol. I. p. 270.
And it is observed in Mr. A. Aikin's Natural History of the
Year, that much ice was carried from the streets in London in
1794, and piled round some elm trees in Moorfields, many of
which were destroyed in the ensuing spring by the slow melting
of it.</P>
<P>9. The absorbent vessels of vegetables, like those of animal
bodies, are liable to err in the selection of their proper aliment,
and hence they sometimes drink up poisonous fluids, to the de∣triment
or destruction of the plant. Dr. Hales put the end of
a branch of an apple-tree, part of which was previously cut off,
into a quart of rectified spirit of wine and camphor, which quan∣tity
the stem imbibed in three hours, which killed one half of
the tree. Veg. Stat. p. 43. Some years ago I sprinkled on
some branches of a wall-tree a very slight solution of arsenic,
with intent to destroy insects; but it at the same time destroyed
the branches it was thrown upon. And I was informed by Mr.
Wedgewood, that the fruit-trees planted in his garden near
Newcastle in Staffordshire, which consisted of an acid clay be∣neath
the factitious soil, became unhealthy as soon as their roots
penetrated the clay; and on infpection it appeared, that the small
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
fibres of the roots, which had thus penetrated the clay, were
dead and decayed, probably corroded by the vitriolic acid of the
clay, beneath which is a bed of coals.</P>
<P>It is, however, asserted by M. Buffon, that the roots of many
plants will creep aside to avoid bad earth, or to approach good.
Hist. Nat. Vol. III. But this is perhaps better accounted for
by supposing, that the roots put out no absorbent vessels, where
they are not stimulated by proper juices; and that an elongation
roots in consequence only succeeds, when they find proper nu∣triment.</P>
<P>10. These long and large cylindrical absorbent vessels, which
pass from the roots of trees up to the summit of the caudex of
each bud at the foot-stalk of the leaf, I suppose to be analogous
to the receptacle of the chyle of animals, as the small absorbent
branches of the roots probably unite beneath the soil into those
large vessels, which are so easily visible; hence the caudex of
each bud consists of an elongation of absorbent vessels, and of
arteries and veins reaching from the union of the root-branches
to the foot-stalk of each leaf, and the plumula of the bud in its
bosom, as described in Sect. I. 7.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE UMBILICAL VESSELS OF SEEDS AND BUDS.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>I. 1. Seeds</HI> are a sexual offspring like eggs. Some seeds and eggs
contain two kinds of nourishment. Other seeds and spawn of
fish contain but one kind of nourishment. 2. Air-bag in eggs,
and in some fruits; not in seeds, nor in spawn. 3. Vessels im∣properly
called umbilical; those properly called umbilical consist of
absorbents, and a placental artery and vein. Seed embryon and
chick begin their growth by the action of their absorbents. 4. Se∣minal
roots of Grew, and chorion of the chick of Malpighi,
are respiratory organs. 5. In what the chick differs from the
seed-embryon. Nothing is found in seeds similar to the yolk of
the egg. II. 1. Buds and bulbs are a paternal offspring; ex∣actly
resemble their parents. 2. Have umbilical vessels, in which
the sap-juice rises in the spring. Why the bark is then easily sepa∣rated
from the alburnum. 3. Sugar in the sap-juice exists in
the alburnum, and in roots. Dry rot of timber owing to fer∣mentation.
Why lower branches first pullulate. 4. Sap ascends
not by capillary attraction, but by the irritative motions of absor∣bent
vessels. Instances of vegetable irritability. Absorbent ves∣sels
sometimes act as capillary syphons, and as capillary tubes.
5. Umbilical vessels coalesce. Why trees do not bleed in summer.
6. Umbilical vessels of buds like those of seeds. Possess air-ves∣sels
like those of the chick. Buds, like eggs, separate from the
parent; their umbilical vessels improperly called placental ones, as
they convey nutriment; hence plants become dwarfs if the cotyle∣dons
of the seed are destroyed. Birch-trees die if smeared with
oil or pitch. 7. Reservoir of nutriment in the alburnum of trees,
and in the roots of biennial plants. Experiment of boiling the al∣burnum
and fermenting the liquor. As buds are formed at mid∣summer,
they may then be transplanted by inoculation, but in the
spring must be ingrafted, and grow by incsculation of vessels, like
inflamed parts of animals. 8. A pause in vegetation at midsummer.

New umbilical vessels act in autumn, and the bark sep∣arates

occasionally both in ever-green trees and deciduous ones, and af∣ter

absorbents seen in a vine-stalk, the latter exterior to the former.
Exist in the alburnum.</Q>
<P>I. 1. THE seeds of vegetables are a sexual offspring corres∣ponding
with the eggs of animals, and contain, like them, not
only the rudiment of the new organization, but also a quantity
of aliment laid up for its early nourishment.</P>
<P>The eggs of birds contain two kinds of albumen, or white,
one less viscid than the other, which is first consumed, and the
yolk or vitellum, which is drawn up into the bowels of the chick,
at its exclusion from the shell, and serves it for nourishment a day
or two, till it can learn to select and digest grains or insects. In
like manner many seeds are furnished with two kinds of nou∣rishment,
the mucilaginous or oily meal of the seed-lobes, and
the saccharine or acescent pulp of the fruit, as in pears, plums,
cucumbers, which supply nutriment to the embryon plant, till it
is able to strike into the earth sufficient roots for the purpose of
absorbing its nutritious juices.</P>
<P>The spawn of fish, and of frogs, and of insects, as of snails
and bees, which are almost as innumerable as the seeds of plants,
and are in the same manner excited into life by the warmth of
the sun, are analogous to those seeds, I believe, which are not
surrounded with fruit, and which contain but one kind of nou∣rishment
for the embryon plant, as grains of corn, and legumes;
but perhaps these have not yet been sufficiently attended to by
philosophers.</P>
<P>These eggs of animals and seeds of vegetables are produced
by the congress of male and female organs; the former supply∣ing
the speck of animation or cicatricula in the egg, and the cor∣culum
or heart in the seed; and the latter producing the nidus,
or nest for its reception, and the nutritive material for its first
support. Thus the eggs of fowls are formed long before they
are impregnated, and are sometimes laid in their unimpregnated
state; and the seeds of legumes are visible many days before the
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
flower opens, and in consequence before they are impregnated,
as observed by Spallanzani.</P>
<P>2. The eggs of birds contain a bag of air at their broad end
for the purpose of oxygenating the blood of the chick. In this
one circumstance the seeds of plants seem to differ from the eggs
of birds, as they contain no air-bag, though it is probable they
may agree with the spawn of fish, which I suppose possess no in∣cluded
air. When the seeds fall on the ground in their natural
state of growth, or are buried an inch or two beneath the soil,
which has recently been turned over, and thus contains much
air in its interstices, their coats do not continue dry like the
shells of eggs during incubation, but immediately become moist
membranes, like the external membrane of the spawn of fish im∣mersed
in water, and in consequence can admit the oxygenation
of the air through them to an adapted set of arteries on their
internal surface, according to the curious observations of Dr.
Priestley on the oxygenation of the blood by the air through
the moist membranes of the lungs.</P>
<P>It should be here observed, that many seeds, before they fall
on the moist earth, are included in a bag of air, as those of the
staphylea, bladder-nut; of the physalis alhekengi, winter-cherry;
of colutea, bladder-senna; in the pods of peas and beans; in
the cells surrounding the seeds of apples and pears; and in the
receptacle of ketmia, which probably serves to oxygerate the
blood of the infant seed, which in these plants may thus be of
forwardes growth, before it is shed upon the soil.</P>
<P>3. There exists a series of glands, and their ducts, impro∣perly
called umbilical vessels by some writers, which supplies the
seed with nourishment from the parent plant, so long as it ad∣heres
to the ovarium of its mother, as the vessels by which a pea
adheres to the pod, in which it is included; in fruits and nuts,
where the kernel is covered with a stone or shell, a long cord of
vessels passes into the bottom of the stone or shell, and rising to
the top bends round the lobes of the kernel, and is inserted
near or into the corculum or heart of the seed, where the living
principle resides, and affords not only present nutrition to the
vegetable embryon, but also secretes the farinaceous or oily ma∣terials
for its future nourishment, which constitute the cotyledons
of the seed.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="27"/>
But the vessels, which may be properly called umbilical, pass
from the heart or corculum of the seed, which is the living em∣bryon
of the future plant, into the seed-lobes commonly called
cotyledons, and imbibe from thence a solution of the farinaceous
or oily matter there deposited for the nutriment of the new vege∣table.
These vessels are delineated in their magnified appearance
by Dr. Grew, Plate LXXIX. fol. edition, and are by him
termed seminal roots. See Plate I. Fig. 1.</P>
<P>These umbilical vessels probably consist of a system of absor∣bents,
which supply nutriment to the embryon plant from the
cotyledons of the seed, and also of a system of placental arteries
and veins spread on the humid membrane, which covers the co∣tyledons,
and is moistened by its contact with the earth, for the
purpose of oxygenating the vegetable blood. This idea is coun∣tenanced
by many plants bringing up their cotyledons, or seed-lobes,
out of the ground into the air, which are then converted
into leaves, and perform the office of lungs, after they have given
up beneath the soil the nutriment, which they previously con∣tained,
as in the young kidney-bean, phaseolus; so the white
corol of the helleborus niger, christmas rose, is changed into a
green calyx by loosing one system of arteries after the impregna∣tion
of the seeds.</P>
<P>The seed-embryon therefore resembles the chick in the egg,
first as when vivisied by the influence of external warmth they
both begin their growth by the absorbent system of vessels being
stimulated into action by their adapted nutriment; and the fluids
thus pushed forwards stimulate into action the other parts of the
system, consisting at first principally of arteries and glands.</P>
<P>Secondly, they seem to resemble each other in their possessing
each of them an absorbent system of vessels, which imbibe the
nutritious matters laid up for them in the albumen or white of
the egg, and in the cotyledons or lobes of the seed; and also of
a placental system of arteries for the purpose of oxygenating their
fluids, as described above in the seed, and which appears in the
egg to be spread on a membrane, which covers the white, as is
shewn in the plates of Malpighi, and called by him the chorion,
and exposes the blood of the chick to the oxygen of the air
contained at the broad end of the egg through a moist membrane.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="28"/>
4. The use of the large apparent artery spread on the coty∣ledons
of a germinating seed of a garden-bean, called seminal
roots by Grew, as shewn in Plate I. Fig. 1, and that spread on
the chorion of the chick in the egg, so called by Malpighi, and
shewn in Tom. II. Fig. 54, and by Fabricius ab Aquapendente,
Tab. I. Fig. 13, which must be an artery as it carries red blood,
are believed to be respiratory organs, like the placental vessels of
the fetus of viviparous animals, because the cotyledons of some
seeds rise out of the ground, and become leaves, after the nutri∣ment
they contained is expended, and are then called seminal
leaves, as in the kidney-bean, phaseolus; and because those
which do not rise out of the ground perish beneath the soil, as
soon as the young plant gains it leaves, which are its aerial respi∣ratory
organ.</P>
<P>Secondly, the chorion of the chick consists of a membrane
including the white, or albumen, and is not only in contact with
the air-bag at the broad end of the egg, which, as the chick ad∣vances,
covers more than half of the internal surface of the shell,
but also with the membrane which lines all the other part of the
shell, as appears in Plate III. which is copied from Malpighi:
yet this extensive chorion, with the numerous arteries and veins
which are spread upon its surface, is not drawn up into the body
of the chick like the yolk and its including membrane, but pe∣rishes
at the nativity of the chick like the placental vessels of the
fetus of viviparous animals; or sometimes, I suppose, before its
nativity, as the chick perforates the air-bag, and is heard to chirp,
before it is excluded from the shell.</P>
<P>Hence it would appear, that both the artery attending the se∣minal
roots abovementioned, and this artery on the chorion of
the chick, must perform some more important office than to sup∣ply
nourishment to the coats of the absorbent vessels, which im∣bibe
the mucilage of the seed, or the white of the egg, and which
absorbents must themselves possess their proper vasa vasorum.
And what more important office can they have than that of
oxygenating the blood of the vegetable or animal embryon? And
this becomes more probable as they both perish at its nativity like
the placenta and cotyledons of viviparous animals.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="29"/>
5. As the incubation of the chick advances, it differs from
the seed-embryon in the production of intestines, with a stomach,
on the internal surfaces of which the mouths of the absorbents
now terminate; and lastly in the production of a mouth and
throat to receive and swallow the remainder of the albumen, in
which it swims; whereas the seed-embryon shoots down new
roots into the earth with an absorbent system to acquire its nu∣triment,
as that from the cotyledons of the seed becomes ex∣hausted.
See Sect. VII. 1, 2.</P>
<P>Nor is there any thing similar to the yolk of the egg found in
the seeds of vegetables, which is drawn up into the intestines of
the young chick about the time of its exclusion from the shell to
serve it with nutriment for a day or two, till it can learn of its
parent by imitation to select and swallow its adapted food. Nor
is the fetus of viviparous animals furnished with any thing similar
to the yolk of oviparous ones, as they have milk ready prepared
for their first nutriment in the breast of the mother.</P>
<P>As soon as the new foliage of the plant rising out of the ground
becomes expanded, and the root descending penetrates the earth
with its fibrous ramifications, the umbilical systems of vessels
cease to act, both the absorbents, which previously supplied the
young embryon with nutriment from the cotyledons, and also
the placental artery, which was spread on the exterior mem∣brane
of the cotyledons for the purpose of oxygenation. These
vessels now either coalesce and decay beneath the soil, or wither
and fall off, when raised above it in the form of seed-leaves.</P>
<P>II. 1. The seeds of plants are thus a sexual or amatorial pro∣geny,
produced principally by the male part of the flower, and
received into a proper nidus, and supplied with nutriment by
the female part of it, and which can thus claim both a father and
a mother. But the buds of vegetables are a linear progeny,
produced and nourished by a father alone, to whom they adhere,
not falling off like the seeds, as is farther treated of in Zoono∣mia,
Vol. 1. Sect. XXXIX. II. 2. and in Sect. VII. I. 3. of
this work. For in this most simple kind of vegetable reproduc∣tion,
by the buds of trees, and by the bulbs of some plants, and
by the wires of others, which are their viviparous progeny, the
caudex of the leaf is the parent of the bud or bulb, or wire,
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
which rises in its bosom, according to the observation of Lin∣neus.</P>
<P>This linear or paternal progeny of vegetables in buds or bulbs,
or wires, is attended with a very curious circumstance, which is
that they exactly resemble their parents, when they are arrived
at their maturity, as shewn in Sect. VII. 1. 3. as is observed in
grafting fruit-trees, and in propagating flower-roots, or strawber∣ries,
or potatoes, by their wires or roots; whereas the seminal
offspring of plants, as it derives its form in part from the mother
as well as father, is liable to perpetual variation, both which
events are employed to great advantage by skilful gardeners.</P>
<P>2. As the embryons in the buds are the viviparous offspring of
vegetables, it becomes necessary, as they have no mouths, that
they should be furnished like the embryons in the seeds with um∣biblical
vessels to supply them with nourishment, till they acquire
roots with another set of absorbent vessels to imbibe moisture
from the earth, and leaves to aft like lungs for the purpose of
oxygenating their blood.</P>
<P>These umbilical vessels, which supply the buds of plants with
nourishment in the early spring, and unfold their foliage, have
been much attended to by Dr. Hales and Dr. Walker (Edinb.
Phil. Transact. Vol. I.) The former observed, that the sap
from the stump of a vine, which he had cut off in the beginning
of April, arose twenty-one feet high in glass tubes affixed to it
for that purpose, but which in a few weeks ceased to bleed. Dr.
Walker also marked the progress of the ascending sap in various
branches of trees, and observed, that in cold weather it stopped
many hours in a day, as well as in the night, and found like-wise
as soon as the leaves became expanded, that the wounded
trees ceased to bleed.</P>
<P>The vessels, which convey the sap-juice with such amazing
force, are situated in or compose the alburnum, or sap-wood, of
the trunk or root of the tree; nor is it surprizing, that some of
it when pressed by so high a column should exsude into the cells
between the alburnum and bark, as in these cells much sap-juice
was observed by Dr. Walker, and this accounts for the great ease
with which the barks of willows and of oaks are separated in the
spring from their wood. The absorbent mouths of these sap-ves∣sels
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
open externally in the moist earth on the roots of trees, and
also into the air on their trunks; and thus mix the aqueous fluids,
which they thus imbibe with the saccharine and mucilaginous mate∣rials
deposited previously in the alburnum of these roots and trunks.</P>
<P>3. This ascending sap-juice during the spring season is in some
trees so sweet, that it is used in making wine, as that of the
birch-tree in this country; and sugar is procured in such quantity
from a maple in Pensylvania, that from each tree five or six
pounds of good sugar have been made annually without destroy∣ing
it. Rush, on Sugar Maple. Philips, London. This sugar
is deposited I believe in the sap-wood of the trunk and roots of
trees, as in the manna-ash, and is dissolved in the spring by the
moisture, which is drank up by the absorbents from the earth
and atmosphere, and forcibly carried on to expand the buds. Its
existence in the sap-wood as well as in the roots is shewn from the
pullulation of oak-trees, which have been stripped of their bark,
and also from the expansion of the eyes of a vine-shoot, when it is
cut from the tree, and planted in the, earth, as described in Sect.
XV. 1. 3.</P>
<P>This suggests to us the reason why the wood of trees is so much
sooner subject to decay, when they are felled in the vernal months;
because the sugar, which the sap-wood then contains, soon
runs into fermentation, and produces what is called the dry-rot;
whence the custom has prevailed of debarking oaks in the spring
and felling them in the autumn; and it is probable that the wood
of all other trees would last much longer, if it was thus ma∣naged,
as the growth of the new leaves would exhaust the sugar
of the sap-wood.</P>
<P>Sweet juices for a similar purpose of expanding the buds of
herbaceous plants are deposited during the autumn in their roots,
as in turnep, beet, tragapogon; or in the knots or joints of the
stem, as in grasses, and the sugar-cane; which like the farina and
oil in seeds, and the dulcet mucilage of fruits, and the honey of
flowers, were designed for the food of the young progeny of
plants, but become the sustenance of mankind!</P>
<P>As the saccharine matter which is thus deposited in the roots,
or in the alburnum, or in the joints of plants, must be diluted by
the moisture absorbed from the earth by their roots, we understand,
why the leaves of the lower branches of trees are first expanded,
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
as seen distinctly in the hawthorn hedges in April, as these must
first receive the ascending sap-juice, as was observed by Dr.
Walker in his account of the maple.</P>
<P>4. The force of the rising sap from a vine-stump in the bleed∣ing
season, as discovered by Dr. Hales, is at some times equal to
the whole pressure of the atmosphere, which is about fourteen
pounds on a square inch of surface. This great power in raising
the sap he ascribes to capillary attraction, and to the variations of
heat daring the day and night. In regard to capillary attraction,
however high it may raise a fluid in very small tubes, it can not
make it flow over them, as the sap-juice did in Dr. Hales's vine∣stump;
nor can it raise a fluid quite to a level with the upper
rim of a glass tube, as the fluid is there more attracted down∣wards
by the glass besides its gravity, and is left in consequence
with a concave surface.</P>
<P>The means by which vegetable absorbent vessels in their
living state imbibe the fluids of the earth and atmosphere, and
carry them forwards with so much force, must be similar to those,
with which animal absorbent vessels perform the same office;
that is by their mouths being excited into action by the stimulus
of the fluids, which they absorb.</P>
<P>This circumstance is confirmed by the evident proofs of the
irritability of plants in various other instances, as the closing and
opening of the petals and calyxes of flowers by light and dark∣nese,
warmth and cold, dryness and moisture, and by the mo∣tions
of the leaves of mimosa, or sensitive plant, and of dionoea
muscipula, by any mechanical stimulus. To this might be added
a variety of instances of the irritability of vegetables to the sti∣mulus
of heat, being increased after a previous exposure to cold,
exactly in the same manner as happens to animal bodies, which
are enumerated in a note in the Botanic Garden, Vol. I. Canto
I. l. 322, whence the reciprocal times of the acting and the
ceasing to act of these vernal vegetable absorbents, which are
here termed umbilical vessels, in the experiments both of Dr.
Hales and Dr. Walker, may be readily explained by their
having been benumbed by the cold, or excited into action by the
warmth of the air or earth. See Sect. XIII. 2. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="33"/>
From one experiment nevertheless of Dr. Walker's these
vessels occasionally act as capillary syphons, because when he
bent down a branch much lower than its origin from the tree,
and cut off the end of it in the bleeding season, the sap flowed
from the extremity of this branch so bent down, when some
wounds two or three feet lower than the origin of this branch
did not bleed. This may be accounted for from the ascent of
the fluid in these vessels being at this time principally owing to
the action of their absorbent mouths, and to their consisting of
long cylinders with minute diameters and rigid coats, like those
which are visible to the eye in dry cane, through which smoke
will pals in either direction, and which at this early season may
not be excited into vegetable action; there is nevertheless a power
of absorption existing in any part of them in the warmer season,
because a branch or flower-stalk cut from the root, and set in a
glass of water, will drink up a considerable quantity of it. There
is also a situation-in their diseased or dead state, where they ap∣pear
to act for some years alike capillary tubes, as in the decortica∣part
of a pear-tree, describbed in Sect. XV. 2, 3.</P>
<P>5. During the great action of these umbilical absorbent ves∣sels
the buds become expanded, that is the young vegetable
beings put forth leaves, which are their lungs, and consist of a
pulmonary artery, vein, and absorbents, and also acquire a new
bark over that of the branches, trunk, and roots, of the last year,
which consists of aortal arteries, veins, and absorbents, and new
radicles, which terminate in the soil. At this time the umbilical
vessels, which existed in the alburnum, or sap-wood, cease to
act, and coalesce into more solid wood, perhaps simply by the
contraction of the spiral fibre, of which they are composed; and
the swarm of new vegetables, which constitute a tree, are now
nourished by their proper lacteal and lymphatic systems.</P>
<P>A curious circumstance now occurs, which is that wherever
a tree is now wounded, no moisture appears. On the contrary,
the wound from Dr. Hales's experiments is in a strongly absorb∣ing
state, insomuch that on applying water to wounds made in
the summer season, it was found to be drank up with great force,
as was ingeniously shewn by mercurial syphons contrived to resist
its absorption.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="34"/>
This evinces, that though during the bleeding season in the
vernal months the sap-juice is imbibed by the umbilical absorbents,
and carried upwards probably by the annular contraction of the
spiral fibres, which I believe compose these absorbent vessels, in
such quantities as to bleed wherever the alburnum is exposed or
wounded, yet that afterwards the exhalation by the numerous
leaves becomes so great, that the actions of the new radical and
lateral absorbents do not supply a fluid so fast, as it could other∣wise
be expended in the growth of the plant, or dissipated into
the air; and as the vessels, which pass down the trunks of trees,
inosculate in variety of places, as is seen in the cloth made at
Otaheite from the bark of a mulberry-tree, when a wound is
made through some of these vessels, the fluid, which might
otherwise ooze out, is carried away laterally by those in their
vicinity; and as the vessels of vegetables are rigid, and do not
collapse when wounded like those of animals; and as the circu∣lation
in them is comparatively slow, but little of their contained
fluids are poured out of them when wounded in the summer
months.</P>
<P>6. From all these observations it finally appears, that the um∣bilical
vessels of each bud are similar to those of a seed, which
are called by Dr. Grew seminal roots, and that like the umbilical
cords, which form the wires of strawberries above ground, and
of potatoes under ground, they supply the new vegetable with
nutriment, till the leaves are expanded in the air, and new roots
are pushed out and penetrate the earth.</P>
<P>There is also a curious analogy between these umbilical ves∣sels
of buds, which exist in the alburnum of trees, and those
belonging to the chick in the egg, which consists in their both
possessing certain air-vessels; those of trees pass horizontally
from the bark to the alburnum, and that of the egg exists at the
broad end of it. Thus it is probable, that the fluid in the fine
extremities of the new vessels of the embryon bud becomes oxy∣genated
by these horizontal air-vessels, in the same manner as the
fluid in the terminations of the arteries on the chorion of the
chick is believed to become oxygenated by the air contained
at the broad end of the egg, as alluded to in Sect. II. 4. and
III. 1. 4.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="35"/>
A circumstance, in which the bud may be conceived to differ
from the egg, consists in the separation of the egg from its parent,
as soon as the fetus has acquired a certain maturity, along with
its umbilical vessels, and its reservoir of nutriment. But in ve∣getables
something similar occurs, for the parent bud is separated
by death in the autumn from its embryon offspring; the leaf
falls off, which was the lungs of the parent bud, and the vessels
of its caudex, which formed the bark, coalesce into alburnum,
or sap-wood, surrounding the umbilical vessels of the new bud;
which thus may be said to loose its parent like the egg, but re∣tains
its umbilical vessels, and a reservoir of nutriment, which
exists in the sap-wood, and also another system of vessels, which
constitute the new bark of the tree, consisting of the interwoven
caudexes of each individual new bud.</P>
<P>But as the umbilical vessels of plants above described, which
constitute the alburnum of the trunks of trees, and the seminal
roots, so called, of the growing seed, convey nutriment to the
embryon bud, or to the rising plumula, as well as oxygenation,
they are not similar in that respect to the placenta of the animal
fetus, and were improperly called placental vessels in the notes to
the Botanic Garden, as the placenta of the animal fetus is shewn
in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXXVIII. to be an organ of res∣piration
only, like the gills of fish, and not an organ for nu∣trition.</P>
<P>Hence when the cotyledons of seeds are cut away from the
rising plume, the plant becomes a dwarf for want of nutriment;
and the wounding or exposing the alburnum of bleeding trees, as
of the birch or maple, in the vernal months to obtain the sap-juice
retards the expansion of the new buds, and the conse∣quent
growth of the tree. Hence also it appears, why smear∣ing
the bark of a tree with pitch, or oil, or paint, is liable to
destroy the new buds, and consequently the tree, by stopping up
their spiracula; and why covering an egg with grease or varnish
is said to prevent the production of a chicken, by preventing a
change of air at the broad end of it.</P>
<P>7. We may conclude that the umbilical vessels of the new bud
are formed along with a reservoir of nutritious aliment about
midsummer in the bark, which constitutes the long caudex of
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
the parent bud, in the same manner as a reservoir of nutritious
matter is formed in the root or broad caudex of the turnep or
onion, for the nourishment of the rising stem. And that these
umbilical vessels of the embryon bud, and the reservoir of nutri-ment
laid up for it, which is secreted by the glands of the parent
bud, and now intermixed with the present bark of the tree, be∣come
gradually changed into alburnum, or sap-wood, as the sea∣son
advances, in part even before the end of summer, and en∣tirely
during the winter months.</P>
<P>That the alburnum of trees, which exists beneath the bark
both of the trunk and roots of them, contains the nutritious
matter deposited by the mature leaves or parent buds for the use of
the embryon buds, appears not only from the saccharine liquor,
which oozes from the wounds made in the vernal months
through the bark into the alburnum of the birch and maple,
betula et acer; but also from the following experiment, which
was conducted in the winter before the vernal sap-juice rises.</P>
<P>Part of a branch of an oak-tree, in January was cut off, and
divided carefully into three parts, the bark, the alburnum, and
the heart. These were shaved or rasped, and separately boiled
for a time in water, and then set in a warm room to ferment;
and it was seen that the decoction of the alburnum or sap-wood
passed into rapid fermentation, and became at length acetous,
but not either of the other, which evinces the existence both of
sugar and mucilage in the alburnum during the winter months;
since a modern French chemist has shewn by experiments, that
sugar alone will not pass into the vinous fermentation, but that a
mixture of mucilage is also required; and from this experi∣ment
it may be concluded, that in years of scarcity the sap-wood
of those trees, which are not acrid to the taste, might afford nu∣triment
by the preparation of being rasped to powder, and made
into bread by a mixture of flour, or by extracting their sugar and
mucilage by boiling in water, as mentioned in Zoonomia, Part
III. Article I. 2, 3. 6.</P>
<P>Now as the embryon buds of deciduous trees of this climate
are formed about midsummer, secreted by the generative glands
in the caudex of the parent leaf-bud, and are supplied with due
nourishment from the same source, not having yet shot out radi∣cles
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
of their own from the lower end of their long caudexes into
the earth, they may be readily transplanted at this season from
one tree to another by inoculation, or into different parts of the
same tree; as the new caudex of the young bud of one tree will
readily unite with the new caudex of that of another tree, and
as they can be removed entire during the early state of their
growth along with a part of the bark only, as scarcely any al∣burnum
is yet formed beneath the bark of the young twig, from
whence the bud is cut or torn.</P>
<P>But after their greater maturity, so that many buds exist on one
twig, or scion, and are already furnished with radicles passing
down into the ground, as in the ensuing spring, it becomes ne∣cessary
to ingraft them by cutting off a part of the alburnum, as
well as of the bark of the new bud; and to apply these in con∣tact
with the bark and alburnum of another tree, to which they
may grow by inosculation of vessels; whence it appears why bud∣ding
or inoculation must be performed soon after midsummer, and
ingrafting in the early spring, as in the former the buds continue
to grow by the junction of the caudex or bark vessels alone with
those of the tree into which they are inserted, and in the latter
by the inosculation of their vessels with those of the bark and
alburnum of the tree to which they are applied and bound.</P>
<P>The inosculation of the vessels of a bud cut out of one tree and
inserted into the bark and alburnum of another, as in the in∣graftment
of scions, is exactly resembled by a similar operation
on animal bodies, when a tooth is taken from one person and
inserted into the head of another, and where two inflamed parts
grow together. Thus an experienced anatomist is said to have
cut the two spurs from a young cock, and applied them to the
opposite sides of his comb, which was previously excoriated,
where they continued to grow and appeared like horns; and Ta∣licotius,
whose book lies by me, seriously asserts, that he suc∣ceded
in making artificial noses from a part of the skin of the
arm of his patients, and has published prints of the manner of
the operation, so ridiculed by the author of Hudibras. Chei∣rurgia
Casparis Talicotii.</P>
<P>The growth of an inoculated bud on the bark of another tree,
where the upper part of the caudex of the inoculated bud joins
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
with the lower part of the caudex of another bud belonging to
the stock, is still more nicely resembled by the union of the head
and tail part of two different polypi in the experiment of Blu∣menbach
mentioned in Sect. VII. 3. 2. of this work.</P>
<P>8. As the leaves of trees become expanded, the sap-juice
above described ceases to flow, and the bark of the tree then ad∣heres
to the alburnum. Afterwards from the middle of June to
the middle of August, as Dr. Bradley has observed, there seems
to be a pause in vegetation; at which time the new buds in the
bosom of each leaf seem to be generated, and the bark, which
during the two preceding months adhered to the wood, now ea∣sily
separates, as in the spring, according to the observation of
Du Hamel, Vol. II. 261; and vegetation, which appeared to
languish during the heats of midsummer, acquires new vigour at
the approach of autumn like that of spring.</P>
<P>This circumstance, which seems to have puzzled many natu∣ralists,
is to be explained from the action of the umbilical ves∣sels
of the new buds, which begin to enlarge as soon as they are
formed, and in this climate have their progress stopped by the
cold during the winter, and the moisture which exsudes from
the sides of these vessels, and is extravasated between the albur∣num
and the bark, causes an easy separation of them from each
other.</P>
<P>From the new flow of sap in these vessels about midsummer,
being probably in part conveyed to the leaves by the retrograde
action of their lymphatics in very hot weather, the honey-dew
seems to originate either as an exsudation from the leaf, or from
the vessels being punctured by the aphis, which drinks the vege∣table
chyle in such great quantity that it passes through the insect
almost unchanged; see Sect. XIV. 1. 7. and 3. 2; and thus
causes the suffusion of honey on the leaves below them for a time
in the heat of summer.</P>
<P>Add to this that M. Du Hamel, by nicely measuring some
buds, found that they were gradually enlarged at some times
daring the winter, and concludes from thence that the sap-juice,
which nourishes them, continues to flow, though slowly, in the
milder parts of the winter days, Vol. II. p. 262; and adds, that
is must rise continually during the winter months in ever-green
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
trees, otherwise their foliage would wither; and also in deci∣duous
trees, because the branch of an ever-green tree will grow
on a deciduous tree, and not lose its leaves in the winter, as the
lauro-cerasus on a cherry-tree, and an ever-green oak on a com∣mon
oak.</P>
<P>It must nevertheless be observed, that as the umbilical vessels
are a part of the new bud, as the lacteals and other absorbents
are a part of the chick or fetus, the perpetual action of these
umbilical vessels must depend on the bud to which they belong,
in the caudex of which, between the plumula and radicle, the
brain or common sensorium, and the consequent vital energy,
are believed to reside; and that whether an ingraftment exists
between the bud and the umbilical absorbent vessels or not. But
as in those animals which have a very small portion of brain in
the head compared with that in the spine of the back, as in eels,
snakes, worms, butterflies, if the head be cut off, the other parts
will continue to live with great activity for hours, and even
days; so it happens to these umbilical absorbent vessels, which in
vine-stumps, and many herbaceous plants, will continue to pour
out the sap-juice in great force and great quantity for many days
after the exsection of the whole upper part of the plant.</P>
<P>The continuance of the motion of these umbilical vessels con∣sisting
of a spiral line, which are believed to be air vessels by many
authors, is mentioned by Malpighi; who asserts, that when he
examined them in the winter, he could often observe them for
some time to continue their vermicular motion so as to astonish
him. See Duhamel. Phys. des arb. Vol. I. p. 43.</P>
<P>9. The umbilical vessels of this section like the absorbents of
the preceding one, both which are believed to consist of a spiral
line, as shewn in Sect. II. 7. may be readily seen in cutting a
vine-stalk horizontally, as they at first appear full of fluid; but
in a very little time, as the fluid exhales or becomes effused, a
circular area of round holes appears to pass longitudinally interior
in respect to the bark; which I suppose to consist both of the
umbilical vessels, which bleed during the vernal months, and of
the other radical, cellular, and cutaneous absorbents; the latter
of which I suspect to be exterior to the former, and to reside
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
between the bark and the umbilical vessels, though both of them
are believed to constitute the alburnum of the plant.</P>
<P>From many ingenious observations on vegetables monsieur de
la Baisse draws the following conclusions, which are assented to
by M. Bonnet, and which I shall here transcribe, as they so ac∣curately
coincide with the theory above delivered, and as they
were deduced from different experiments, are a confirmation of
it. He says, “that the vessels destined to convey nourishment
to plants, are neither in the pith, nor in the bark, nor between
the bark and the wood; but in the ligneous substance itself; or,
to speak more accurately, that those vessels are themselves the
woody fibres included between the pith and the bark of plants,
which have their origin in the roots, and extend themselves to
every part of the plant.” Bonnet usage des feuilles, p. 275.</P>

<P>I. 1. THERE have been various opinions concerning the use
of the leaves of plants in the vegetable economy. Some have
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
contended, that they are perspiratory organs. This does not ap∣pear
probable from an experiment of Dr. Hales, Veg. Stat. p.
30. He found, by cutting off branches of trees with apples on
them, and taking off the leaves, that an apple exhaled about as
much as two leaves, the surfaces of which were nearly equal to
that of the apple; whence it would appear that apples have as
good a claim to be termed perspiratory organs as leaves.</P>
<P>Others have believed them the excretory organs of excrement∣titious
juices; but as the vapour exhaled from vegetables has no
taste, this idea is no more probable than the other. Add to this,
that in moist weather they do not appear to perspire or exhale at
all, as shewn by some statical experiments of Dr. Hales, like
those of Sanctorius on the perspiration of the human body; which
perspiration has also been supposed to be an excrement, which
is shewn to be an erroneous opinion; and that its design is simply to
preserve the skin supple, like the tears diffused on the eye-ball to
preserve its transparency, as explained in Zoonomia, Vol. II.
Class I. 1, 2, 14.</P>
<P>Others have believed that vegetables absorb much nutriment
by their leaves, and quote an experiment of Dr. Priestley's, who
found plants placed in water under glasses grew much faster,
when the air, in which they grew, was occasionally impregnated
with putrid exhalations. But there is another experiment of
Dr. Priestley's, which should be mentioned, and that is that he
agitated one part of a vessel of water beneath a glass filled with
putrid exhalation, and the whole of the water presently became
very fetid. Hence we may conclude, that in the first case the
water, in which the vegetable grew, absorbed the putrid exhala∣tions
from the air over it, and that these were again absorbed
from the water by the roots of vegetables, which correspond
to the lacteals of the stomach and intestines of animals; and that
they thus received nourishment from the putrid vapours, and not
by their leaves, which we shall endeavour to shew to be simply
respiratory organs.</P>
<P>Other philosophers have conceived, that the leaves of plants
acquire electricity from the air. In answer to these it may be
observed, that no electricity is shew by experiments to descend
through the stems of trees, except in thunder storms: and that
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
if the final cause of vegetable leaves had been to conduct elec∣tricity
from the air, they ought to have been gilded leaves
with metallic stems.</P>
<P>Others again have supposed that the leaves of plants acquire a
phlogistic material from the sun's light, whence it was believed
that on this account they turn their upper surfaces to the sun. But
though light is more or less attracted by all opake bodies, yet if
the final cause of vegetable leaves had been to absorb light, they
ought to have been black and not green; as by Dr. Franklin's
experiment, who laid shreds of various colours on snow in the
sun-shine, the black sunk much deeper than any other colour, and
consequently absorbed much more light. The use of light in
vegetable respiration will be treated, of in Sect. XIII.</P>
<P>2. The air of our atmosphere has been shewn by the experi∣ments
of Priestley, Cavendish, and Lavoisier, to consist of twen∣ty-seven
parts of respirable air, called oxygene gas, with seventy-three
parts of unrespirable air, termed azotic, gas, which are
mixed together, not chemically combined; whereas water con∣sists
of eighty-five hundreth parts of oxygen to fifteen of hydro∣gen,
which exist in their state of combination, and are not there∣fore
fit for respiration. But in water a considerable quantity of
common air is also dissolved which escapes on boiling; and even
pure vital air was discovered in the water of some springs by sir
Benj. Thomson, when it was exposed to the sun's light. Philo∣soph.
Transact. The former of these fluids is thus adapted to the
respiration of aerial animals, and the latter to that of aquatic
ones; and the analogy between the aerial and aquatic leaves of
vegetables and the lungs and gills of animals embraces so many
circumstances, that we can scarcely withhold our assent to their
performing similar offices.</P>
<P>The internal surface of the air-vessels of the lungs of men are
said to be equal to the external surface of the whole body, or
about fifteen square feet. On this surface the blood is exposed
to the influence of the respired air, through the medium of a
thin moist pellicle. By this exposure to the air it has its colour

so necessary to the existence of life, that we can live

<P><PB N="38" REF="44"/>
In aquatic animals, as fish, the blood is exposed to the air,
which is diffused in the water by the gills; the surface of which
is probably greater in proportion to the external surface of their
bodies, than that of the air-vessels of the lungs of aerial animals
to their external surfaces. Through these gills, or aquatic lungs,
a current of water is made perpetually to pass by the gaping of
the fish, as it moves, like the air in respiration; and from this
water it is probable the same material is acquired by the gills of
fish as from the air by the lungs of aerial animals.</P>
<P>3. The great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rface of the leaves compared to that of the
trunk and branches of trees is such, that it would seem to be an
organ well adapted for the purpose of exposing the vegetable
juices to the influence of the air. This however we shall see
afterwards is probably performed only by their upper surfaces,
which are exposed to the light as well as air, and on that ac∣count
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quire greater oxygenation, as will be shewn hereafter:
yet even in this case the upper surfaces of the leaves must bear a
greater proportion to the surface of the bark of the tree than that
of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he air-cells of the lungs of animals to their external surfaces.</P>
<P>Aerial or aquatic animals, by their muscular exertions, produce
a current of air or water reciprocally to and from their lungs,
and can occasionally change the place, where they respire, when
the air or water becomes vitiated. But as vegetables have but
little muscular power to move their leaves, except in a few in∣stances;
and as the air or water is frequently nearly stationary,
where they exist, it seems to have been necessary to expose their
fluids to the air or water on a greater expanse of surface than in
the lungs or gills of animals, which well accounts for the exube∣rant
extent of their foliage.</P>
<P>In the lungs of animals the blood, after having been exposed
to the air in the extremities of the pulmonary artery, is changed
in colour from deep red to bright scarlet, and is then collected
and returned by the pulmonary vein. So in the leaves of plants
the vegetable blood is rendered yellow in some plants, as in ce∣landine,
chelidonium; white in others, as in fig-leaves, ficus;
and in spurge, euphorbia; and red in others, as in red beets,
beta. And the structure of the leaf, as consisting of arteries
and veins to expose the vegetable blood to the influence of the
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
air, and to return it to the caudex of the bud at the foot-stalk
of the leaf, beautifully became visible by the following expe∣riment.</P>
<P>A stalk with the leaves and seed-vessels of large spurge (eu∣phorbia
helioscopia) in June 1791, had been several days placed
in a decoction of madder, (rubia tincto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia) so that the lower
part of the stem and two of the inferior le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves were immersed in
it. After having washed the immersed leaves in much clean
water, I could readily discern the colour of the madder passing
along the middle rib of each leaf. This red artery was beaut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fully
visible both in the under and upper surfa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the leaf;
but on the upper side many red branches were se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n going from
it to the extremities of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e leaf, which on the other side were
not visible except by looking through it against the light. On
this under side a system of branching vessels carrying a pale
milky fluid, were seen coming from the extremities of the leaf,
and covering the whole underside of it, and joining int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> two
large veins, one on each side of the red artery in the middle rib
of the leaf, and along with it descending to the foot-stalk or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣tiole.
On slitting one of these leaves with scissars, and having▪
a common magnifying lens ready, the milky blood was seen
oozing out of the returning vein on each side of the red artery
in the middle rib, but none of the red fluid from the artery.</P>
<P>All these appearances were more easily seen in a leaf of picris
treated in the same manner; for in this milky plant the stems and
middle-rib of the leaves are sometimes naturally coloured reddish,
and hence the colour of the madder seemed to pass further into
the ramisications of their leaf-arteries, and was there beautifully
visible with the returning branches of milky veins on each side.</P>
<P>In a plant which was sent to me under the name of senecio
bicolor, but which I have not yet seen in flower, the upper sur∣face
of the leaf is green like most other leaves, but during the
vernal months the under surface is of a deep red, whence I con∣clude
that the vegetable blood acquires the red colour in the ter∣minations
of the pulmonary artery in the upper surfaces of the
leaves, which becomes visible as it passes in the large veins on the
inferior surface. In the same manner the red colour of the blood
<PB N="40" REF="46"/>
is most visible in the large veins beneath the leaf of the red
veined dock, rumex sanguirea.</P>
<P>4. From these experiments the upper surface of the leaf ap∣peared
to be the immediate organ of respiration, because the co∣loured
fluid was carried to the extremities of the leaf by vessels
most conspicuous on the upper surface, and there changed into a
milky fluid which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e blood of the plant, and then returned by
concomitant veins a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the under surface, which were seen to ooze
when divided wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scissars, and which in picris particularly ren∣dered
the under surface of the leaves greatly whiter than the up∣per
one.</P>
<P>As the up<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er surface of leaves constitutes the organ of respi∣ration,
on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich the vegetable blood is exposed in the termina∣tions
of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eries beneath a thin moist pellicl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the action of the
atmosph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, these surfaces in many plants strongly repel moisture,
as cab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge-leaves, whence the particles of rain lying over their
surfa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces without touching them, as observed by Mr. Melville,
(Fsays Literary and Philos. Edinb.) have the appearance of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bules of quick-silver. And hence leaves laid with their up∣per
surfaces on water wither as soon as in the dry air, but con∣tinue
green many days if placed with their under surfaces on
water, as appears in the experiment of monsieur Bonnet, (Usage
des Feuilles); hence some aquatic plants, as the water-lily
(nymphaea) have the lower sides of their leaves floating on the
water, while the upper surfaces remain dry in the air.</P>
<P>This repulsion of the upper surfaces of the leaves of aerial
plants to water bears some analogy to the renitency of the lariynx
to the admission of water into the lungs of animals; for if a sin∣gle
drop accidentally falls into the windpipe, a convulsive cough
is induced till it is regurgitated. For the same reason several plants
close together the upper surfaces of their leaves when it rains, in
the same manner as in their sleep during the night, as mimosa,
the sensitive plant, and the young shoots of chick-weed, alsine;
and of kidney-bean, phaseolus.</P>
<P>As those insects which have many spiracula, or breathing
apertures, as wasps and flies, are immediately suffocated by
pouring oil upon them, in the year 1783 I carefully covered with
oil the surfaces of several leaves of phlomis, of Portugal laurel,
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
and balsams; and though it would not regularly adhere, I found
them all die in a day or two, which shews another similitude be∣tween
the lungs of animals and the leaves of vegetables.</P>
<P>There is an ingenious experiment of M. Bonnet, (Usage des
fseuilles) which shews that the upper surfaces of leaves exhale
much less than their under surfaces. He put the stalks of many
leaves fresh plucked from trees or herbaceous plants into glass
tubes filled with water; of these he covered with oil or varnish
the upper surface of many leaves, and the under surface of many
others, and uniformly observed by the water sinking in the tubes
that the upper surfaces exhaled much less than half the quantity
exhaled by the under surfaces, which shews them to be organs
designed for different purposes.</P>
<P>II. 1. There exists a strict analogy between the leaves of aqua∣tic
plants, which are constantly immersed beneath the water, and
the gills of aquatic animals, which, consists in the largeness of
their surface, owing to their hair-like subdivisions, and to their
being terminated with innumerable points. The gills of fish con∣sist
of many folds of blood-vessels lying over each other, each re∣sembling
a fringe, or the downy part on one side of a feather at∣tached
to the middle rib of it, by which means they expose a
greater surface of blood to the water than is exposed to the air by
the internal membranes of the air-cells of the lungs of other ani∣mals;
and undoubtedly for this final cause, because water con∣tains
less oxygen in its uncombined state, which is the material
necessary to life, than air, though much more of it in its com∣bined
state, as water consists of eighty-five parts of oxygen to fif∣teen
parts of hydrogen; but it is the uncombined oxygen only
dissolved in heat, and diffused in water, which can serve the pur∣pose
of animal or vegetable respiration.</P>
<P>The apparatus for this purpose, according to Duverney's Ana∣tomy
of a Carp, is truly curious. He found 4386 bones in the
gills, which had sixty-nine muscles to give them their due motions.
See Bomare's Dictionnai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e raisoneé, Art Poisson. And Mon∣ro
observed by the numerous divisions and folds of the membrane
of the gills, that their surface in a large skate was nearly equal
to the surface of the human body. Physiol. of Fish, p. 15. He
adds that in the whole gills there exist 144,000 subdivisions or
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
folds, and that the whole extent of this membrane may be seen
by a microscope to be covered with a network of exceedingly
minute vessels.</P>
<P>2. In this respect the gills of fish are resembled by the suba∣quatic
leaves of plants, which are slit into long wires terminated
in points, as in traps, oenanthe, hottonia, the water-violet, and
the water-ranuncules. This last plant, and some others, have
frequently some leaves erect in the air, and others immersed in
water, arising from the same stem; and it is curious to observe
that the aerial leaves are nearly entire, or divided only into a
few lobes; vnilst the aquatic leaves are slit into innumerable
branches lik<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a fringe, and have thus their surfaces wonderfully
enlarged for the purpose of acquiring uncombined oxygen from
the air, which is diffused in the water, and which abounds so
much less there than in the atmosphere; for the same purpose
the plants on the summits of high mountains, where the air is so
much rarer, and consequently abounds less with oxygen, have
their leaves much more divided than in the plains, as pimpinella,
petroselinum, and others, that they may expose a more extensive
surface of vessels to the influence of the thinner atmosphere.</P>
<P>3. This great enlargement of the surface by so minute a divi∣sion
does not however seem to be the only use of this uniform
structure of gills and aquatic leaves; but there is another very
important one, which hath hitherto I believe escaped the notice
of philosophers; and that is that points and edges contribute
much to the separation of the air, which is mechanically mixed
or chemically dissolved in water, as appears on immersing a dry
hairy leaf into water fresh from a pump, on which innumerable
globules of air, like quick-silver, appear on almost every point.
Nor is it improbable that points immersed in water may in a
bright day contribute to decompose it, or certainly to set at liberty
its superabundant oxygene, as occurs in the perspiration of leaves
when exposed to the sunshine, and to the green matter in the
experiments of Dr. Priestley, which is probably owing to the
fine points of both of them; and lastly, when points of silk are
immersed in spring water, which is frequently hyperoxygenated, as
in the experiments of Count Rumford, related in the Philos.
Transact. See Sect. XIII. I. 5.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="49"/>
III. 1. The <HI>root-leaves</HI> of many perennial plants, which do not
produce flowers in the first year from the seed, are different from
those of future years, as in the rheum palmatum, palmated rhu∣barb,
the leaves are small and nearly circular, and not divided into
fingers till the second year; and in tulip the leaf the first year
from the seed is small like a blade of grass rising from a diminu∣tive
bulb. In other perennial plants the root-leaf is undivided,
but at the same time larger than those on the rising stem, as in
geum, averns; in senecio aureus, and the campanula rotundiso∣lia,
so named from the round form of the root-leaf, which is
also much broader than those on the stem, as well as undivided.
The root-leaves of many biennial, and of some annual plants,
are likewise larger, as well as of a different form from those on
the rising flower-stem, as in turneps and carrots. And lastly, the
root-leaves of some plants, which rise immediately from seeds,
consist of the cotyledons of the seed, and are thus different from
the leaves above them.</P>
<P>2. In respect to the root-leaves of palmated rhubarb and of tu∣lips,
when these plants are raised immediately from seed, as these
first plants are not designed to generate flowers and consequent
seeds, but to produce simply another plant like a leaf-bud of a
tree, less oxygenation seems to have been necessary, and the
leaves therefore require less surface, and are in consequence un∣divided.
In respect to the root-leaves of geum, and of campa∣nula
rotundifolia, which are larger than their stem-leaves, it is
probable that they lay up a reservoir of nutritious matter for the
rising stem, like those of turneps and carrots, and thus require
greater oxygenation, and in consequence a greater surface.</P>
<P>3. Another difference of root-leaves from those of the stem in
annual plants often consists in the latter being properly bractes or
floral-leaves, which will be spoken of below, while the root-leaf
resembles those belonging to the leaf-buds of trees. Thus in the
rising stem of wheat the root-leaf produces the first joint above
the soil, and the second and third leaf produce joint above joint,
which are each a separate bud rising on that below it, as is seen
by the division of the pith or hollow part of one joint from ano∣ther,
and at length die uppermost leaf is a bracte or floral-leaf
belonging to the ear.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50"/>
4. And lastly, the seed-leaves which rise out of the ground
with the first joint of the flower-stem, as in kidney bean, phase∣olus,
as they consist of the placental artery, which was spread on
the cotyledons of the seed, and, now rising out of the earth,
when the nutritive part has been dissolved in the terrein moisture
and absorbed, they serve the office of an aerial pulmonary organ,
or lungs, which before served that of an aquatic one, or gills;
but wither and fall off as the true leaves become expanded.</P>
<P>IV. 1. The common foliage of deciduous plants constitutes
the organ of respiration already spoken of, which belongs to the
leaf-buds during the summer months, and drops off in the autumn,
when those buds perish by the cold, or by the natural termination
of their existence. But there is another kind of foliage dissimilar
to the former, consisting of bractes or floral-leaves, which supply
an organ of respiration to the calyx and pericarp of the flower-bud.
These frequently differ in size, form, and colour from the
other leaves of the plant, and are situated on the flower-stalk
often so near the fructification as to be confounded with the
calyx. In some plants there are two sets of floral-leaves, or
bractes, one at the foot of the umbel, and another beneath each
distinct floret of it; and in others they appear in a tuft above the
flower, as well as on the stalk beneath it, as in fritillaria impe∣rialis,
crown imperial; and in others they are so small as to be
termed stipulae or props.</P>
<P>All these kinds of bractes, or floral-leaves, serve the office of
lungs for the purpose of exposing the vegetable blood to the in∣fluence
of the air, and of preparing it for the secretion, or produc∣tion
and nourishment of the vegetable uterus, or pericarp, and of
the seeds produced and retained in it, frequently before their im∣pregnation,
and always after it.</P>
<P>2. It must be observed that in many plants these floral-leaves,
or bractes do not appear till after the corol and nectaries, with
the anthers and stigmas, drop off; that is, not till after the seed
is impregnated, as in colchicum autumnale, crocus, hamam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lis,
and in some fruit-trees. The production of the vegetable uterus,
or pericarp, with the unimpregnated seeds included in it, is in
these plants accomplished or evolved, like the bractes themselves
with the corol and sexual organs, by the sap-juice, forced up in the
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
umbilical vessels from some previously prepared reservoir, without
the necessity of any exposition to the air in leaves or lungs, which
are not yet formed, though it may acquire oxygenation in the fine
arteries of the embryon buds, which are supposed to surround the
horizontal air-vessels observed in the bark of trees.</P>
<P>As soon as the seeds become impregnated, the corol and nec∣taries
with the sexual organs fall off, and the pericarp and its con∣tained
seeds are then nourished by the blood, which is aerated
or oxygenated in the bractes, or floral-leaves. Thus the flower
of the colchicum appears in autumn without any green leaves, and
the pericarp with its impregnated seeds rises out of the ground
in the ensuing spring on a stem surrounded with bractes, and with
other green leaves below them, which produce new bulbs in
their bosoms.</P>
<P>The blood, which thus supplies nutriment to the pericarp and
its included seeds, does not seem to require so much oxygena∣tion
as that which supplies nutriment to the embryon buds;
whence the floral leaves are in general much less than the root-leaves
in many plants, and than the common green leaves of al∣most
all vegetables. And in the plant mentioned in No. I. 3.
of this section, under the name of senecio bicolor, the under
surfaces of the stem-leaves near the expected flower ceased to be
red like those of the radical leaves, which seemed to shew that
the vegetable blood was in them less oxygenated.</P>
<P>Whence it may be believed that less irritability may be necessary
for the growth of the seed than of the embryon bud, as the
former does not yet perhaps possess so much vegetable life as the
latter. And lastly, that as the anthers and stigma require greater
irritability, and some sensibility, it was necessary a second time
to oxygenate the blood which supplies them with nutriment in the
corols of the flowers. See Sect. VII. 2. 4.</P>
<P>3. Recapitulation of the arguments tending to shew that the
leaves of vegetables are their lungs. 1. They consist of an artery,
which carries the sap to the extreme surface of the upper side of the
leaf, and there exposes it under a thin moist pellicle to the
action of the air; and of veins, which there collect and return
it to the foot-stalk of the leaf, like the pulmonary system of ani∣mals.
2. In this organ the pellucid sap is changed to a coloured
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
blood, like the chyle in passing through the lungs of animals.
3. The leaves of aquatic plants are furnished with a larger surface,
and with points like the gills of aquatic animals. 4. The up∣per
sides of aerial leaves repel moisture, like the larynx of ani∣mals.
5. Leaves are killed by smearing them with oil, which in
the same manner destroys insects by stopping their spiracula, or
the air-holes to their lungs. 6. Leaves have muscles appro∣priated
to turn them to the light, which is necessary to their res∣piration,
as will be shewn in the Section on Light. 7. To this
may be added an experiment of Mr. Papin related by M. Duha∣mel.
He put an intire plant into the exhausted receiver of an air-pump,
and it soon perished; but on keeping the whole plant in
this vacuum except the leaves, which were exposed to the air, it
continued to live a long time, which he adds is a proof that
the leaves are the organs of respiration. Physic des arbres, V.
I. p. 169.</P>
<P>V. 1. The organs of respiration already described consist of
the green leaves belonging to leaf-buds, and of the bractes belong∣ing
to flower-buds. But there is another pulmonary system to∣tally
independent of the green foliage, which belongs to the
sexual or amatorial parts of the fructification only, I mean the
corol or petals. In this there is an artery belonging to each
petal, which conveys the vegetable blood to its extremities, ex∣posing
it to the light and air under a delicate moist membrane
covering the internal surface of the petal, where it often changes
its colour, as is beautifully seen in some party-coloured poppies,
though it is probable that some of the irridescent colours of
flowers may be owing to the different degrees of tenuity of the
exterior membrane of the petal refracting the light like soap∣bubbles.</P>
<P>The vegetable blood is then collected at the extremities of the
corol-arteries, and returned by correspondent veins exactly as
in the green foliage, for the sustenance of the anthers and stig∣mas,
and for the important secretions of honey, wax, essentail
oil, and the prolific dust of the anthers, and thus constitutes a
pulmonary organ, as is shewn by the following analogies.</P>
<P>2. First, the vascular structure of the corol, as above described,
and which is visible to the naked eye; and its exposing the ve∣getable
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
juices to the air and light during the day evinces that it
is a pulmonary organ.</P>
<P>Secondly, as the glands which produce the prolific dust of the
anthers, the honey, wax, and frequently some odoriferous es∣sentail
oil, are generally attached to the corol, and always fall off
and perish with it, it is evident that the blood is elaborated or
oxygenated in this pulmonary system for the purpose of these im∣portent
secretions.</P>
<P>Thirdly, many flowers, as the colchicum and hamamelis,
arise naked in autumn, no green leaves appearing till the ensuing
spring; and many others put forth their flowers, and complete
their impregnation early in the spring, before the green foliage
or bractes appear, as mezereon, and some fruit-trees, which
shews that these corols are the lungs belonging to these parts of
the fructification.</P>
<P>Fourthly, this organ does not seem to have been necessary for
the defence of the stamens and pistils, since the calyx of many
flowers, as tragopogon, performs this office; and in many flowers
these petals themselves are so tender as to require being shut up
in the calyx during the night. For what other use then can such
an apparatus of vessels be designed?</P>
<P>Fifthly, in the helleborus niger, Christmas-rose, after the seeds
are grown to a certain size, the nectaries, and stamens, and stig∣mas,
drop off, and the beautiful large white petals change their
colour to a deep green, and gradually thus become a calyx, in∣closing
and defending the ripening seeds; hence it would seem that
the white vessels of the corol served the office of exposing the
blood to the action of the air, for the purposes of separating or
producing the honey, wax, and prolific dust; and when these
were no longer wanted, that these vessels coalesced, like the
umbilical vessels of animals after their birth, and thus ceased to
perform that office, and lost at the same time their white colour.
Why should they lose their white colour unless they at the same
time lost some other property besides that of defending the seed-vessel,
which they still continue to defend?</P>
<P>Sixthly, neither the common green leaves nor the bractes are
necessary to the progress of the carol, and stamens, and stigma,
or to the secretion of honey, after the last year's leaves are fallen
off, as is evinced by the flowers of colchicum in the autumn, and
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
of crocus in the spring, in both which the seeds rise out of the
earth with their common leaves and bractes so long after the dis∣appearance
of the flower. In deciduous plants the common
green leaves serve as lungs in the summer and autumn to each in∣dividual
bud, which then produces the new buds in its bosom,
which are either leaf-buds or flower-buds. In the ensuing spring
the new common leaves are the respiratory organ belonging to
the leaf-buds, and the bractes are the respiratory organ to the
pericarp, and its included seeds before or after impregnation;
and the corols, as soon as expanded, become the lungs to the
amatorial parts of the fructification, and require neither the green
leaves nor bractes.</P>
<P>3. Hence the vine bears fruit at one joint without leaves, and
leaves at the other joint without fruit. Hence the flower of the
colchicum rises out of the ground without bractes or other green
leaves, and flourishes till the seed is impregnated; and the brac∣tes,
which rise out of the ground on the stem in the following
spring, are lungs to give maturity to the pericarp and seed; and the
other green leaves are for the purpose of producing new bulbs
round the old one, but can have nothing to do with the corol, an∣thers,
stigmas, and nectaries, which have long since fallen off,
and perished. And lastly, when currant or gooseberry trees lose
their common green leaves, and their bractes, by the depreda∣tion
of insects; the new leaf-buds become small and weak, but the
corol, anthers, stigmas, and nectaries, continue to flourish, and the
fruit becomes impregnated, though it is less sweet and of less size
from the pericarp and included seed wanting their due nutrition
by the bractes before or after impregnation.</P>
<P>4. It hence appears that the flower-bud, after the corol, sta∣mens,
stigmas, and nectaries fall off, becomes simply a vegetable
uterus, for the purpose of supplying the growing embryons with
nourishment, and possesses a system of absorbent vessels, which
brings the sap-juice to the foot-stalk of the fruit, and which there
changes into a pulmonary artery, which constitutes the bractes
or floral-leaves, and exposes the acquired juices to the oxygena∣tion
of the air, and converts them into vegetable blood. This
blood is collected again by the veins of the bractes, and con∣veyed
by an adapted or aortal artery for the various secretions
of saccharine, farinaceous, or acescent materials, for the nourish-ment
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
of its included embryons, or the construction of the fruit
and seed-lobes.</P>
<P>At the same time, as perhaps all the vessels of trees inos∣culate,
the fruit may become sweeter and larger when the green
leaves as well as the bractes continue on the tree; but the corols
with the stamens, stigmas, and nectaries, (the succeeding fruit not
considered) suffer, I believe no injury, when the green leaves and
even the bractes are taken off, as by the depredations of insects.
Some florists have observed this circumstance, and affirm that in
many plants when the leaves are pulled off, the flowers become
stronger from their then producing no bulbs, as in tulips and hya∣cinths.
The inosculation of vegetable vessels is evinced by the
increased growth of one bud, when others in its vicinity are cut
away.</P>
<P>5. The sleep of plants has been much spoken of by Linneus
and others, but there is a wonderful circumstance occurs in it,
which has not been noticed; which is, that it seems to resemble
the torpor of winter-sleeping insects and other animals, as many
plants do not appear to respire during this part of their existence;
for some vegetables close together the upper surfaces of their
leaves, both during their sleep and in rainy weather, as mimosa,
sensitive-plant; phaseolus, kidney-bean; and the terminal shoots
of alsine, chickweed. Many other plants close their petals and
calyxes during their sleep as well as in rain, as convolvulus; and
some even in the bright day-light, as tragopogon; and yet all these
plants are believed by gardeners to grow, when young, faster in the night.</P>
<P>We must observe, that this sleep of plants, though it may re∣semble
the torpor of winter-sleeping animals, is not to be con∣founded
with the state of deciduous plants in the winter, as that
consists in the death of the last year's bud, and the embryon con∣dition
of the new buds. It would hence appear, that perpetual
respiration is less necessary to the vegetable than to the animal
world; and that as less is wasted during the inactive state of sleep,
it is possible that young plants may increase in weight, or grow
faster, during this state of inactivity, as animals are observed to
respire less frequently during their sleep, and yet are believed
when young to grow faster during their hours of rest than of ex∣ercise.
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
So both in the experiments of Dr. Hales and Dr. Walker on
plants during the bleeding season, the ascent of the sap-juice not
only stopped during the night, but sometimes became retrograde,
which might nevertheless be ascribed to the torpor of the absor∣bent
system induced by cold, as well as that of sleep.</P>
<P>6. We may draw this general result, that the common leaves
of trees are the lungs of the individual vegetable beings, which
form during the summer new buds in their bosoms, whether leaf-buds
or flower-buds, and which in respect to the deciduous trees
of this climate perish in autumn; while the new buds remain to
expand in the ensuing spring. Secondly, that the bractes, or
floral-leaves, are the lungs of the pericarp or uterus, and to the
growing seeds which it contains, as the bractes on the stem of the
crown-unpenal, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> imperialis, and the tuft above its
flowers. And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the corol or petals are the lungs be∣longing
to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and stigmas, which are the sexual or ama∣torial
parts of the plant, and to the neactries for the secretion of
honey, and to the other glands which affords essential oil and
wax.</P>
<P>Lastly, the stamina and stigma with the petals and nectary,
which constitute the vegetable males, and the amatorial part of
the female, as they in some plants appear before the green leaves
or bractes, as in colchicum and mezereon, and in all plants fall off
when the female uterus is impregnated, would appear to be
distinct beings, totally different both from the leaf-buds, which produce
a viviparous progeny; and also from the bractes with
the calyx and pericarp, which constitute the vegetable uterus.</P>
<P>They must at first receive nutriment from the vernal sap-juice,
like the expanding foliage of the leaf-buds, or the bractes of the
flower-buds. But when the corol becomes expanded, and con∣stitutes
a new pulmonary organ, the vegetable juices are exposed
to the air in the extremities of its fine arteries beneath a moist
pellicle for the purpose of greater oxygenation, and for the im∣portent
secretion of honey; and then the anthers and stigmas are
supplied with this more nutritious food, which they absorb from
its receptacle, the nectary, after it has there been exposed to the
air, and are thus furnished with greater irritability, and with the
necessary amatorial sensibility, and live like bees and butterflies on
that nutritious fluid. See Sect. VII. II. 4.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE AORTAL ARTERIES AND VEINS OF VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<Q>1. Aortal arteries in vegetables have correspondent veins. Shewn
by experiment on picris, tragopogon, and euphorbia. Seen in the
calyx of flowers. Circulation shewn by ingrafting striped-passion-flower,
and jasmine, and hardier scions on cankered stems, from
fruit-grafts on bad stocks degenerating. 2. Vegetable circulation
performed without a heart, as in the aorta and liver of fish.
3. Force of the mouths of absorbents greater than that of the heart
in producing circulation. Why there is no pulsation in the vena
portarum. Circulation in the veins of animals produced by ab∣sorption.
Very small resistance in the capillaries and glands.
Wounds in trees strongly absorb fluids except in the bleeding season.
4. Vegetable vessels too minute to carry red blood, hence not easily
injected with coloured fluids. Charcoal injected with quicksilver,
or melted wax. 5. Recapitulation. Circulation performed by
irritability of the vessels, and by the great power of absorption,
and the action of the sides of vessels consisting of a spiral line.
6. Vessels unite at the lower and upper caudex gemmae. Absor∣bents
and umbilical vessels consist of a spiral line. Experiment by
placing euphorbium first in a decoction of galls, and then in a solution
of green vitriol. Junction of great vein, absorbent trunk, and pul∣monary
artery in the upper caudex gemmae. Embryon bud seen in
contact with the pith. Experiments with charcoal injected with
white paint, suet; wax, and quicksilver.</Q>
<P>1. THE two principal arteries in animal bodies are the pulmo∣nary
artery and the aorta. The former receives the blood from
the right cavity of the heart, and dispersing it round all the air-cells
which terminate the bronchia, or air-pipes of the lungs, ex∣poses
it to the influence of the atmosphere through the thin moist
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
membrane, which lines them. This we have shewn in Sect. IV.
I. 3. to be resembled in its office by the vegetable arteries, which
carry their blood up the foot-stalks of the leaves, and expose it
on the upper surface of them to the influence of the air through
a thin moist pellicle, where it changes its colour, and returns by
correspondent veins like the blood of animals.</P>
<P>The aortal arteries of the more perfect animals receive the
blood from the left cavity of the heart, after it has been exposed
to the influence of the air in the lungs, and disperse it by numer∣ous
ramifications over the whole body for the purposes of secre∣tion
and nutrition. In less perfect animals the aorta itself has a
pulsation, and carries forward the blood without the assistance of
a heart, as may be seen in the back of a full-grown silk-worm by
the naked eye, and very distinctly by the use of a common lens.
After the blood has passed the various glands and capillaries, it
is received by another system of vessels, the veins, which consti∣tute
a kind of reservoir for the quantity of blood, that remains un∣expended
by the secretions, excretions, nutrition, and growth of
the animal; by these it is again carried to the right cavity of the
heart, and again exposed in the lungs to the influence of the air.</P>
<P>In a similar manner the branching veins, which bring the blood
from the leaves of plants, after it has been exposed to the in∣fluence
of the air, unite at the foot-stalk of each leaf into more or
fewer trunks, as may be seen in tearing off the foot-stalk
of a leaf of a chesnut-tree from the stem; and there without the interpo∣sition
of a heart, like the circulation in the aorta of fish, and that
in the livers of red-blooded animals, these venous trunks take
the office of arteries, and disperse the blood downwards along the
bark to the roots, and to every other part of the vegetable sys∣tem,
performing the various purposes of secretion, excretion, and
nutrition, as was shewn in the experiment of placing a fig-leaf in
a decoction of madder, described in Sect. IV. 1. 3. of this
work.</P>
<P>But as vegetables drink up their adapted nourishment perpe∣tually
from the moist earth, and in consequence must be supposed
to take up no more than their perpetual waste may require, I
formerly believed, that this reservoir, or venous system, was not
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
necessary in vegetables; and that therefore probably it did not
exist. I was induced to adopt this idea from having observed in
cutting asunder a stem of large spurge, euphorbia helioscopia; in
which the rising sap could not be mistaken for the milky blood;
that much more of the vegetable blood flowed from the upper part of the
plant than from the lower part of it; and I therefore
suspected, that there was no returning veins correspondent to the
descending aortal arteries. But first; this must necessarily occur
from the veins returning from the root effusing their blood flower
than the arteries of the upper part of the plant. And secondly,
if there were no returning veins from the lower part of the plant,
there ought to have been no effusion of blood from it. I have
since observed on cutting asunder a large plant of pieris, and
also a large plant of tragopogon scorzonera, and instantly inspect∣ing
them with a common lens; that two concentric circles of
vessels were visible, which oozed a milky juice; the internal cir∣cle
of the upper division of the two plants, and the external one
of the lower division, appeared to bleed more copiously, and in
quicker streams, than the external circle of the upper division,
and the internal one of the lower division; whence I concluded,
that the vessels of the internal circles were arteries, and those of
the external ones veins; and that the arteries of the upper part
of the plant, which arise from the upper part of the caudex of
each individual bud, were thus seen to pour out more blood, and
in a quicker stream, than the veins of the lower part of the plant,
as they return from the roots.</P>
<P>Add to this, that as the pulmonary arteries in the green leaves
of plants, and in their petals, have correspondent veins visible to
the eye; and that these are also seen in the calyxes of some
flowers, which from their other evident uses can not be esteemed
pulmonary organs; There is the strictest analogy to believe, that
the aortal arteries of the bark of the trunk and roots have also
their correspondent veins.</P>
<P>Nevertheless to evince that the vessels returning from the roots
of plants, which oozed out a milky juice, were in reality not
absorbent vessels, I cut off the stem of a large spurge plant, eu∣phorbia
helioscopia, about a foot and half from the ground, and
bent it down into a cup of a decoction of madder, rubia tinctoria,
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
in which it was confined two or three minutes, and wiping the
end clean I presently cut off about an eighth of an inch of it with
a sharp penknife, and observed with a common lens the large ab∣sorbent
vessels to be coloured with the madder, while the veins
continued to effuse a little white blood; and thus demonstrated
both the existence of absorbent vessels and returning veins. See
Sect II. 2.</P>
<P>At the same time the upper part of the plant had also its stem
set in the decoction of madder, and after two or three minutes
on cutting off about the eighth of an inch of it, or simply by
wiping the extremity, the large absorbent vessels were seen by the
naked eye to be coloured with the madder, and the arteries con∣tinued
to effuse a large quantity of milky blood. The same ex∣periments
were tried on a plant of tragopogon with the same
event.</P>
<P>It should be here observed, that the decoction of madder
should be fresh made, as otherwise the colouring matter is liable
to form itself into molecules, too large to be imbibed by any other
vessels but the trunks of the absorbents, which may be said to re∣semble
the receptaculum chyli of animals, as they pass from the
lower extremity of the caudex of each bud to the upper one.</P>
<P>A proof of the circulation of the juices of plants has been de∣duced
from the comunication of white spots from a grafted scion
to the whole of the tree in which it was ingrafted. Mr. Fair-child
budded a passion-tree, whose leaves were spotted with yellow,
into one which bears long fruit. The buds did not take, ne∣vertheless
in a fortnight yellow spots began to shew themselves
about three feet above the inoculation; and in a short time af∣terwards
yellow spots appeared on a shoot, which came out of the
ground from another part of the plant. Bradley on Gardening,
Vol. II. p. 129.</P>
<P>And Mr. Lawrence observes, that the yellow striped jassamine
has afforded a demonstration of the circulation of the juices in a
tree; he inoculated in August the buds of striped jassamine-trees into
the branches of plain ones; and asserts, that he has several
times experienced, that if the bud lives but two or three months,
it will communicate its virtue or disease to the whole circumfluent
sap, and the tree will become entirely striped. Art of Garden∣ing,
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
p. 66. These are both of them important facts, as they
are related from respectable authorities.</P>
<P>And I think I have myself observed in two pear-trees about
twenty years old, whose branches were much injured by canker,
that on ingrafting hardier pear-scions on their summits, they be∣came
healthier trees, which can only he explained from a better
sanguisication produced in the leaves of the new buds.</P>
<P>It has also been observed by an ingenious, lady, that though
fruit-trees ingrafted on various kinds of stocks are supposed to bear
similar fruit, yet that this is not accurately so; as on some
stocks she has known the ingrafted scions of apple-trees to suffer
considerable change for the worse compared with the fruit of the
parent-tree; whereas those scions, which can he made to grow
by striking roots into the earth, she believes to suffer no deteriora∣tion.
If this really occurs, it should be in a very slight degree,
as the fruit is formed by the action of secretion, and depends on
the glands of the part more than on any slight change of the ve∣getable
blood, from which the secretion is selected or produced.
Nevertheless if the fact be ascertained, it confirms the
truth of the existence of a vegetable circulation.</P>
<P>2. The circulation of the vegetable juices in the leaves of
plants, and in their trunks and roots, is performed without a
heart, and is very similar to that in the aorta of fish. In fish the
blood, after having passed through their gills, does not return to
the heart, as from the lungs, of air-breathing animals; but the
pulmonary vein, taking the structure of an artery, after having
received the blood from the gills, which there gains a more florid
colour, distributes it to the other parts of their bodies. A similar
structure obtains in the livers of fish, as well as in those; of air-breathing
animals; the blood is collected from the mesentery and
intestines by the branches of their proper veins, which unite on their
entrance into the liver, branch out again, and assume the
office of an artery, under the name of vena portarum, distri∣buting
the blood through that large viscus for the purpose of the
secretion of biie; whence we see in these animals two circula∣tions
independent of the power of the heart. First, that which
begins in the mesentery and intestines, and passes through the
liver; and secondly, that beginning at the termination of the
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
veins of the gills, and passing through the other parts of the
body; both which circulations are carried on by the action of
those respective arteries and veins. Monro's Physiology of Fish,
p. 19.</P>
<P>The course of the fluids in the leaves, and in the trunks and
roots of vegetables, is performed in a similar manner. First,
the absorbent vessels of the roots, of the internal cells, and of
the external bark, with the venous blood returning from those
parts, unite at the foot-stalk of the leaf, and then, like the vena
portarum, an artery commences without the intervention of a
heart, and receiving the sap and venous blood spreads it in nu∣merous
ramifications on the upper surface of the leaf; here it
changes its colour, and becomes vegetable blood; and is again
collected by a pulmonary vein, and returns on the under surface
of the leaf. This vein, like that which receives the blood from
the gills of fish, assumes the office of an artery, which corres∣ponds
with the aorta of animals, and branching again disperses
the blood upward to the plumula or summit of the bud, from its
caudex at the foot-stalk of the leaf, and downward along the
bark of the trunk to the roots; where it is received by a vein cor∣responding
to the vena cava of animals, after having expended what
was required for the secretions, excretions, and nutrition, and re∣turns
to the caudex of the bud, and to the foot-stalk of the leaf.</P>
<P>3. The power, which produces a circulation without a heart
in vegetables, acts with an astonishing force. In some of the
experiments of Dr. Hales, who fixed glass tubes to vine-stumps
in the spring, the sap-juice rose above thirty feet; and in some
trees must probably arise still higher in the vernal months before
the leaves are expended; and this either solely by the activity
of the absorbent mouths of these vessels, or assisted by the vermi∣cular
action of their sides, which appear to consist of a spiral line,
as described in Sect. II. 7. of this work.</P>
<P>When the sap-juice rifes thirty-five feet high, which is about
the weight of the atmosphere, the column presses about fourteen
pounds on every square inch. Now if the area of the mouth of
an absorbent vessel be only one ten thousandth part of the area of
a square inch, the ten thousandth part of fourteen pounds is the
whole that counteracts the efforts of each absorbent mouth; and
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
as the vessels of vegetables appear to have both very minute dia∣meters,
and very rigid sides, they are thence prevented from
aneurism or rupture by the pressure of so high a column of sap-juice.</P>
<P>The same philosopher, by fixing glass tubes to the arteries of
horses, as near the heart as was practicable, found the blood in
them to rise only nine or ten feet; whence it appears, that a cir∣culation
of blood may be carried on more forcibly by the action of the mouths
of absorbent vessels, than by the apparently more
violent exertions of the heart, the power of which was calcu∣lated
by Borelli and others to be so enormously great as to equal
the pressure of some thousand pounds, as the counter pressure of
the moving blood acts on so large a surface as that of the whole
internal sides of the heart.</P>
<P>But as a column of blood nine feet high presses with less than one
third of the weight of the atmosphere, or about four pounds on
every square inch of surface; and as the internal surface of
the left cavity of the heart of a horse may not exceed thirty
square inches, its whole power does not overcome the resistance
of more than 120 pounds.</P>
<P>Hence it becomes intelligible, how the circulation of the
blood in the vena portarum of the liver is performed without any
apparent pulsation, or contraction of its sides like an artery,
which some have indeed supposed it to possess, but simply by the
force of absorption exerted by the mouths of the veins, which
supply it with blood.</P>
<P>Secondly, how the circulation of the blood in the bodies of
fish, except in their gills, is carried on through their system with∣out
the action of the heart. And thirdly, how the blood in the
vena cava of the human body, as well as the fluids imbibed by
the lacteals and lymphatics are carried forwards to the heart by
the power alone of their absorbent mouths, which drink up their
blood from the capillaries, or their other fluids from the surfaces
or cavities of the body. And lastly, how the whole circulation
in vegetables is performed in very minute vessels without valves,
and without a heart, solely by the power of absorption, circum∣stances
which have long perplexed the physiology both of the
animal and vegetable kingdoms.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="64"/>
Another circumstance attending the circulation of the juices
in vegetables, as well as the circulation of the blood in animal
bodies, has not been sufficiently attended to: and that is, that
the resistance to the passage of these fluids from the terminations
of the arteries in what are termed capillaries, to the beginnings of
the veins and through the glands of various kinds, is much less
than is generally imagined, as we see with what great force the
mouths of both the vegetable and animal absorbents imbibe their
fluids; and that the beginnings of the veins and the mouths of
the lacteals and lymphatics, and probably those belonging to every
kind of gland, possess this great power of absorption. And that
on this account, when wounds are made in trees in the summer
months, when the umbilical sap-vessels of the root have ceased
to act, such wounds powerfully absorb any fluid, whether salu∣tary
or poisonous, which is applied to them, which does not
occur during the bleeding season, as the sap-juice from the dis∣severed
vessels of the alburnum supplies a greater quantity of fluid
than the other parts of the wound can imbibe.</P>
<P>4. The red particles of blood have been said by Lewenhook
and others, who have inspected them in microscopes, to be of
the same size in all creatures. Hence nature has formed no very
small animals with a general circulation of warm red blood; the
mouse and humming bird are perhaps the least. When it was ne∣cessary
to form the vessels much more minute, a diluter kind of
yellow or milky blood, or one nearly transparent, constitutes the
greatest part of the vital fluid, as in insects of various kinds, and
in the white muscles of fish; whence arose a difficulty to the ana∣tomist
of visibly injecting these smaller series of vessels as they
are too minute to convey almost any coloured particles.</P>
<P>In the vegetable world the finer systems of their vessels have
still greater tenuity, and hence evade our eyes and microscopes;
and as their coats possess at the same time a greater rigidity, they
are in general on that account also incapable of receiving coloured
injections, which has rendered the anatomy of plants so much
more difficult to investigate than that of animals, and must apo∣logise
for the impersections of this part of the work, but affords
to argument against the existence of a vegetable circulation.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="65"/>
It is probable that by immersing charcoal, nicely made by slow
calcination, in quicksilver, or even in melted coloured wax, as it
so greedily absorbs almost all fluids, when recently taken from the
fire, or cooled without the contact of air, we might produce
beautiful vegetable preparations, and give more accurate light into
the anatomy of plants. But the column of quicksilver employed
to push forwards the injection should not be too high, lest it
should rupture the vessels it ought only to fill, as I suppose has
sometimes happened in thus injecting the glands or capillaries of
animal bodies.</P>
<P>5. Recapitulation. We may finally conclude, that the circu∣lation
of vegetables is performed like that of animals by the irri∣tability
of their vessels to the stimulus of the fluids, which they
absorb and protrude; that is, that the extremities of the branch∣ing
veins of the leaves forcibly absorb the vegetable blood from
the extremities of their arteries, which correspond with the pul∣monary
arteries of animals; and that it is thus pushed on to the
foot-stalk of the leaf, where the veins unite, and branching out
again take the office of an artery, like the aorta in fish, without
perceptible pulsation. The blood in this artery is pushed forwards
by that behind it, the motion of which was given by the power
of absorption in the pulmonary vein, till it arrives an the extre∣mities
of these aortal branches, and is there again forcibly ab∣sorbed
by the terminations of the correspondent veins, and again
pushed forwards to the caudex gemmae, and to the foot-stalk of
the leaf, like the blood in the vena cava of animals.</P>
<P>A part of this blood is at the same time forcibly selected and
absorbed by the various glands for the purposes of the necessary
secretions, excretions, or nutrition; and the sap-juice or chyle and
the water, which is acquired by the absorbent vessels that
correspond to the lacteal and lymphatic vessels of animals, is car∣ried,
as well as the remainder of the blood, to the foot-stalk of
the leaf. Here these absorbent vessels are believed to push their
contents into the veins correspondent to the vena cava of ani∣mals,
and which now uniting without the intervention of a heart,
assume the name and office of the pulmonary arteries; and
branching out upon the leaf expose the returning blood and new
sap-juice to the influence of the air. And finally, all this is ac∣complished
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
by the power of absorption, as in the aortal arteries,
and vena portarum, of fish, which is excited into action by the
irritability of the mouths of these vessels to the stimulus of the
fluids, which they absorb.</P>
<P>2d. A circulation of vegetable juices, in every respect similar to
that in the common leaves above described, exists in the bractes or
floral-leaves, except that the leaves of the leaf-bud prepare
their juices for the production and nourishment of other buds in
their bosoms; but these bractes, which are the lungs of the fruc∣tification,
prepare their juices for the nourishment of the peri∣carp
and its included seeds, but not for that of the corol with
its anthers and stigmas, as these in many flowers exist before
the production of the floral-leaves, as in colchicum and hama∣melis.</P>
<P>3d. Another circulation of vegetable juices exists in the sexual
parts of flowers, including the nectaries and corols. In the co∣rols
the vegetable blood is exposed to the influence of the air, and
prepared for the secretion of honey, which is the food or support
of the anthers and stigmas as treated of in the section IV. V. 1.
and in Section VII. 4. In these the progression and circulation
of the fluids must be caused by the power of absorption, which
we have shewn to be a greater force than that of the heart of
animals.</P>
<P>4th. The progress of the fluids imbibed by vegetable lacteals
from the earth, and by their lymphatics from the air, and from
the surfaces of their internal cells, is evidently began and carried
on by the power of absorption of their terminating mouths, and
the annular contraction of their spiral fibres.</P>
<P>5th. And lastly, the wonderful force with which the sap-juice
is drank up and protruded in the umbilical vessels, which expands
and nourishes the buds of trees, and which forms the wires of
strawberries above ground, and those of potatoes under ground,
with the great variety of bulbs and root-scions, is to be ascribed
to this single principle of absorption. Except that some of these
long cylindric vessels are evidently composed of a spiral line,
as mentioned in Sect. II. 7. and which may by the annular con∣traction
of this spiral line carry the fluids they have absorbed
with great force either in a forward or retrograde direction.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="67"/>
6. Finally I conclude, that the branching absorbents of the
roots unite at the lower caudex of each bud, before it rises out
of the earth, and forms a large trunk, which passes up the albur∣num
of the tree to the upper caudex of the bud at the foot-stalk
of the leaf, and may be compared to the receptaculum
chyli of animals extended to so great a length; and that it
there joins the great returning vein, which also is composed
of the branching veins of the roots uniting at the lower caudex
of the bud, and ascending terminates at the upper caudex of
it, where it becomes again branched, and forms the pulmonary
artery.</P>
<P>The aorta or great artery descends, I suppose, along with the
great vein, or vena cava above mentioned; and branching in the
roots below, and on all other parts of the individual leaf-bud,
performs the offices of secretion and nutrition. The pulmonary
arteries and veins belong to the leaf; the former exposes the
blood to the atmosphere beneath a thin moist pellicle, whence
it becomes oxygenated, and probably acquires some warmth,
and phosphoric acid, and the spirit of vegetable life. The
latter collects the aerated blood by its branches, and con∣veys
it to the upper caudex of the bud, at the foot-stalk of
the leaf, where it becomes the aorta or great artery above-mentioned.</P>
<P>The sides of the long absorbent trunks, or receptacles of
chyle, which rise from the lower caudex and terminate in the
upper caudex of each bud, as well as the long trunks of the um∣bilical
vessels described in Sect. III. evidently consist of a spiral
line, as well as those trunks of absorbents, which imbibe aqueous
fluids from the air, and a part of their perspirable matter on the
surfaces of the leaves. But whether the pulmonary and aortal
arteries or great veins consist of a smilar structure is not yet as∣certained.</P>
<P>I shall here relate the following experiments, which were
made a few days ago, to confirm or confute the ideas above de∣livered.</P>
<P>Some stems of large spurge, euphorbia, were set upright in a
decoction of oak-galls, and others in a solution of green vitriol.
On the next day these were reciprocally removed from the one
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
to the other, as by this management I supposed that the black
molecules would be produced in the vessels of the plants, and
would thence appear higher in those vessels than if the black mole∣cules
had been formed by a mixture of the two fluids previous to
their absorption.</P>
<P>On cutting these horizontally slice after slice with a sharp
knife, and inspecting them with a common lens, the milky blood
was seen to ooze as before described, from an external ring of the
bark; and an interior ring of coloured points was agreeably
visible many inches up the stem; but on slicing the stem from be∣low
up to the insertion of the leaves and buds in their bosoms, I
persuaded myself that I could perceive the coloured absorbents
of the stem enlarged at the part where each with the attendant
vein changes into a pulmonary artery, and passes into the leaf,
forming three or more of the ribs of it, and thus constituting the
upper part of the caudex gemmae.</P>
<P>Another circumstance was beautifully visible, which was, that
the coloured cylinder of absorbent vessels had evidently separated
to allow the new bud to apply its interior termination to the pith;
which probably, when it was secreted by the glands of the
caudex of the parent bud, found in this situation a proper nidus,
and due nutriment for its embryon state, as in the uterus of the
female.</P>
<P>Some other kinds of experiments I directed with design to
shew the part of the lower caudex of each bud, where the branch∣ing
absorbents and veins of the root unite each into one trunk,
before they ascend along the bole of the tree; and also to shew,
as in the above experiment, the upper caudex of each bud,
where the veins are joined by the absorbents, and become the
pulmonary arteries of each leaf, but did not succeed quite to my
wish, though what I could observe seemed to confirm the above theory.
I had not leisure to repeat the experiments with suffi∣cient
attention, but shall here in few words describe the manner
of making them, hoping some one may be induced to prosecute
them with success, and to inject vegetable vessels, as the anato∣mists
do those of animals.</P>
<P>A part of a leaf-stalk, and the joint to which it adhered, with
about half an inch of the stem above and below the joint, were
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
cut off from some last year's twigs, and also the caudex of some
herbaceous plants. These were covered with sand in a crucible
placed on the fire, till they were red hot, so that the vegetable
joints were become charcoal. They were then taken out of the
sand, and some immersed in melted suet, others in melted bees-wax,
others in white paint, and one or two in an amalgama of
quicksilver and zinc, which happened to be prepared for the pur∣poses
of electricity. When they were cold, on slicing them,
some horizontally, and others vertically, I persuaded myself that
the blood-vessels above mentioned, as well as the pulmonary vein
and aortal artery, were visible in the two extremitiés of the long
caudex of the bud, as well as the long trunks of the arteries,
veins, and absorbents, which constitute the middle part of it.</P>

<P>I. 1. THE structure of the glands of animals has not been yet
fully ascertained. They consist of vessels so minute as to exclude
all coloured injections, except quicksilver; and the terminations
of these vessels are so tender, that the necessary weight of the
quicksilver is liable to break them, and thus misinform the ob∣serve,
as mentioned in Sect. V. 4. Little more is therefore
known of them than their effect, which is, that they secrete,
that is separate or produce, some, fluid from the blood; as bile,
saliva, urine, milk.</P>
<P>The vessels of vegetables being still more minute, and more ri∣gid,
the structure of their glands is still further removed from our
discovery. Their effects are however as evident as those of the
glands of animals in the secretion or production of various fluids,
which become solid, as their aqueous parts are absorbed or ex∣haled,
as mucilage, starch, oil, sugar, honey, wax, turpentines,
essential oils, aromatics, bitters, narcetics, acrids, acids, and
a variety of other materials, which fill our barns and granaries,
and crowd the shops of the druggist.</P>
<P>2. There can be no doubt from what has been already said of
the circulation of vegetable juices, but that their various secretions
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
must be effected in a similar manner to that in animal bodies,
which is believed to be performed by the mouth of each gland
being irritated into action by the stimulus of the blood, which is
brought to it, and that by a kind of appetite it drinks up a part
of the blood, and converts it to the fluid, which it secretes,
which then becomes more or less solid, as its aqueous parts are
absorbed or exhaled.</P>
<P>II. 1. Mucilage is found in all parts of plants, as being an es∣sential
constituent of vegetable as of animal bodies; so when an
extract is made by boiling plants in water, the mucilage makes
the greatest part of this extract. The mucilage called gum ara∣bic
is obtained from mimosa nilotica, gum tragacanth exsudes from
astragalus tragacantha, as a similar gum exsudes from our cherry
and plumb-trees; sagoe is the pith of the lycas circinalis; and
salep is the root of the orchis dried in an oven.</P>
<P>This mucilage seems to serve as nourishment to the plant; first,
because it is found in all vegetable as well as animal materials, as
they decompose in dunghills; secondly, because it forwards the
growth of vegetables, when spread upon land; thirdly, because
those trees which bleed much gum, are weakened and frequently
die; and lastly, because it is evidently laid up in the roots and
seeds of various vegetables for the nourishment of the young
plants. But in these it seems to undergo a change either in part
chemical, or wholly by the digestive organs of the embryon
plant, and is converted into sugar as in the transmutation of
barley into malt; and as appears from the sweet taste of onions
and potatoes, when boiled after they have germinated; and as
sugar abounds in the vernal sap-juice of trees in such quantity as
to be capable of fermentation.</P>
<P>III. 1. Starch is another kind of mucilage, which differs from
those above mentioned in its property of not dissolving in cold
water, and can hence be easily separated from them. If eight
pounds of good raw potatoes be grated by means of a bread-grater
into cold water; and, after well agitating the mixture,
the starch be suffered to subside; and this starch be then mixed
with eight other pounds of boiled potatoes, as good bread may
be made as from the best wheat flour; as is affirmed by Mons.
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
Parmentier. From this it appears, that the quantity of starch
in potatoes and in wheat produces the principal difference of
their respective flours. See Zoonomia, P. III. Article I. 2. 3. 4.</P>
<P>2. There is reason to believe that the mucilage during the
growth of the plant is converted into starch; and that this pro∣cess
continues in grain some time after it is carried into the barn
or granary, which occasions old wheat to produce better flour
for the baker; and old oats and old beans are universally be∣lieved
to give more nourishment to horses. I shall here add a
conjecture, that I suppose the use of alum in making bread con∣sists
in its coagulating the mucilage, and perhaps thus contribu∣ting
to convert it into starch; for the bakers mix it principally
with new wheat; and affirm, that it makes the flour of new
wheat equal to old.</P>
<P>Where much alum is mixed with bread, it may be distingushed
by the eye by a curious circumstance, which is, that where two
loaves have stuck together in the oven, they break from each
other with a much smoother surface, where they had adhered,
than those loaves do which do not contain alum.</P>
<P>Add to this, that alum is also used by the London bakers for
the purpose of clearing the river water, with which they are sup∣plied,
which is frequently muddy; and also for instantaneously
destroying the volatile alkali, which is said to exist in some
London wells owing to the vicinity of dunghills. These pur∣poses
it probably fulfils by coagulating the mucilage, which
may occasionally be mixed with the water and support the
mud in it; or by uniting with the calcareous earth, or
with the volatile alkali which it may contain, and depositing the
new-formed gypsum, or its own argillaceous base, the descent of
which may carry down other impurities along with it, in the
same manner as some muddy wines have been rendered fine, not
by filtering them through sand, as then the mud retained on the
surface of the sand soon prevents the descent of the wine through
it, but by passing clean sand in showers by means of a riddle
through the wine. Alum is said to be used by the Chinese for
the purpose of cleaning the water of some stagnant reservoirs;
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
and when used in small quantity may in all these respects be rather
salutary than injurious to the bread of London.</P>
<P>Alum is said also to be used in the manufactory of hair-powder,
which should consist of starch without mucilage, that the hair
may not be glued together by the perspirable matter of the head,
or by an accidental shower. Whether it has the property of
converting mucilage into starch might be easily ascertained by ex∣periment,
by washing in cold water alone one parcel of wheat
flour, and washing a similar parcel in a solution of alum in water.</P>
<P>3. Another conjecture I shall introduce here is, that it is pro∣bable
that the action of frost also may tend to coagulate mucilage,
or convert it into starch; for in the colder parts of Britain it is
said, that the corn never ripens till they have frosty nights; and
I well remember many years ago having observed, that some
book-binder's paste made by boiling wheat-flour and water, after
it had been frozen, ceased to cohere on being pressed together,
like the crumbs of some bread; and I have been told by some
housewives that their pancakes become much lighter if snow be
mixed with the flour instead of water. See Sect. XVI. 3. 2.</P>
<P>4. Now as starch is not soluble in cold water, the bitter and
acrid particles of plants may be washed from it along with the
mucilage; whence in times of scarcity this nourishing part of ve∣getables
may be obtained by elutriation from poisonous plants; on
this circumstance principally depends the wholesomeness of the
bread made from the cassava, the acrid and poisonous particles
being previously washed away along with the mucilage. Mons.
Parmentier found the starch from the root of the white bryony
to contain no acrimony, and to be a wholesome article of food.</P>
<P>IV. 1. Many seeds contain much oil mixed with their muci∣lage,
or starch; as nuts, almonds, flax-seed, rape-seed. Some
of these contain also a bitter or narcotic material, as bitter al∣monds,
apricot kernels, acorns, horse-chesnuts; which, as it
adheres to the mucilage, may be separated from the oil; as in
expressing the oil from bitter almonds, which is as good as from
sweet ones. And it is probable by grating to powder, and
washing in cold water, the kernels of acorns, and horse-chesnuts,
or simply by pressure, that a wholesome starch, or oil, might be
procured. It is probable also that the roots of fern treated in
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
this manner would afford good nourishment, as these are said
to be eaten by the inhabitants of New Zealand, and have been
used in this country in times of great scarcity. And that the
roots of nymphaea, water-lily, might be thus made into wholesome
bread, (which are said to have been eaten in Egypt by
Herodotus) and the roots of many other water-plants,
which might thus become articles of subaquatic agriculture, which is
an art much wanted in this country. See Sect. XI. 2. 5. and
XVII. 2. 3.</P>
<P>V. 1. The digestive power of animals seems to be princi∣pally
exerted in converting their food into sugar; since the
chyle of all animals resembles milk, which contains much sugar,
and thence spontaneously runs into fermentation, which termi∣nates
in the production of acid, as in butter-milk. In Siberia
the natives distil a spirituous and intoxicating liquor from milk
thus fermented. Gmelin. In the diabetes there is reason to
believe, that the chyle passes off into the bladder without being
previously mixed with the blood; and there is a curious history
of a patient in the infirmary at Stafford, who laboured under a
diabetes, he eat and drank thrice as much as most moderate
men, and from sixteen to eighteen ounces, and even twenty
ounces of coarse sugar was extracted for some time daily from
his urine. Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXIX. 4.</P>
<P>2. In like manner the digestive powers of the young vegeta∣ble,
with the chemical agents of heat and moisture, convert the
starch or mucilage of the root or seed into sugar for its own nou∣rishment;
or they obtain sugar ready prepared for them from
some roots, as the beet-root; from many fruits, as grapes, pears,
peaches; from the milk of cocoa-nuts, and from the sap-juice
of the sugar-maple, birch, and many other trees. And thus it
appears probable, that sugar is the principal nutriment of both
animal and vegetable beings. That it is the most nutritive part
of vegetable substances is evinced by the well ascertained fact,
that the slaves in Jamaica grow fat in the sugar-harvest, though
they endure at that time much more labour.</P>
<P>Yet there is an idle notion propagated amongst the people
that sugar is unwholesome; it is indeed probable, that the most
nourishing materials may be taken more easily to excess, but not
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
that it is therefore in general unwholesome; at the same time it
is probable, that some fruits preserved in syrup, or sweet-meats,
may contribute to destroy the teeth; since, if the sugar should become
in a state of decomposition, and the saccharine acid
should abound, it will dissolve calcareous earth with greater
avidity than any other acid.</P>
<P>3. In many plants sugar is found ready prepared, as above
mentioned; thus in the beet-root, the crystals of it may be dif∣cerned
by a microscope; and may be extracted from the muci∣laginous
matter of the root by dissolving it in rectified spirit of
wine; which will unite with sugar but not with mucilage. In
the joints of grass and of corn it may be discovered by the taste.
In the manna-ash, fraxinus ornus, the same saccharine matter
is produced along with the essential salt of the plant, which is
purgative; and in the sugar-cane it abounds in such large quan∣tity
as to contribute much to the nourishment of mankind.
And,—and what?—Great God of Justice! grant, that it may
soon be cultivated only by the hands of freedom, and may
thence give happiness to the labourer, as well as to the merchant
and consumer.</P>
<P>4. Another source of sugar in vegetables is in the fruit, which
in many plants changes from an austere acid to a saccharine acid,
as in gooseberries, apples, oranges. This change continues
to proceed after the pears and apples, or oranges, are taken from
the tree into our storehouses, but the fruit in this situation con∣tinues
to ripen by a vegetable process, as it can not be said to be
dead, because it does not yet undergo fermentation or putrefac∣tion,
or other chemical dissolution; and though its progress in
ripening may be forwarded by warmth, yet it must still be as∣cribed
to a vegetable process; as the plants themselves grow
quicker when exposed to additional heat.</P>
<P>5. But there are other means of increasing or hastening the
saccharine process in austere vegetable fruits, as by bruising
them, or by baking them, both which must destroy the life of
the fruit; thus when apples are bruised for the purpose of mak∣ing
cyder, they become sweeter even in the act of bruising them;
and many pears change from an austere to a sweet juice simply
by the heat of baking; and it is probable that malt acquires a
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
great a part, though not the whole of its saccharine matter, in
the act of drying. This chemical production or increase of
sugar in vegetable jucices is worth being further inquired into;
since if sugar could be made from its elements without the assis∣tance
of vegetation, such abundant food might be supplied as
might tenfold increase the number of mankind!</P>
<P>It is a curious circumstance not yet sufficiently understood,
that not only starch appears to be convertible into sugar by the
vegetable process of digestion, as in the germination of farinace∣ous
seeds; but that sugar is capable of being converted into
starch, as appears in the ripening process of some pears, which
first contain a sweet-juice, and afterwards become mealy.</P>
<P>The use of this saccharine matter of the fruit or sap-juice in
the vegetable economy is for the purpose of supplying the young
seed or bud with nourishment to enable it the better to strike
its roots into the earth, and to elevate its leaves into the air, and
thus by its quicker growth to rival its neighbours in their con∣tentions
for air, and light, and moisture, which are necessary
for its existence.</P>
<P>VI. 1. The production of honey is perhaps one of the most
important vegetable secretions, except that of the prolific farina
from the anthers; and of the favilla, or new embryon, in the
axilla of the leaf. The glands for this purpose, or certainly
the reservoirs, which contain the honey after it is secreted, are
in many flowers visible to the naked eye; as in crown-impe∣rial,
fritillaria imperialis; in monkshood, aconitum napellus;
hellebore; ranunculus. It is nevertheless probable, that this
reservoir of honey is frequently placed at a distance from the
gland, which secretes it, for the purpose of preserving it from
insects and from rain, which is often effected both by a very
complicated apparatus, and by an acrid or poisonous juice, as
in the aconites and the hellebores above mentioned.</P>
<P>As the nectary, or honey-gland, always falls off along with
the corol, and anthers, and stigmas; these appear to be parts
or appendages to each other. The vegetable blood is exposed
to the air in the corol, and thus is oxygenated or prepared for
the secretion of this important fluid; which I suppose is again
reabsorbed, and supplies nourishment to the anthers and stigmas.
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
Some acrid juices, and odorous particles, are at the same time
secreted from the blood thus oxygenated in the corol; which
seem designed as one kind of defence against the depredations
of insects on this important reservoir of honey</P>
<P>2. The universality of the production of honey in the vege∣table
world, and the very complicated apparatus, which nature
has constructed in many flowers, as well as the acrid or dele∣terious
juices she has furnished those flowers with, as in the
aconite, to protect this honey from rain, and from the depre∣dations
of insects, seem to imply, that this fluid is of very great
importance in the vegetable economy; and also that it was
necessary to expose it to the open air previous to its reabsorp∣tion
into the vegetable vessels.</P>
<P>In the animal system the lacrymal gland separates its fluid,
into the open air for the purpose of moistening the eye; of this
fluid the part which does not exhale, is absorbed by the puncta
lacrymalia, and carried into the nostrils; but, as this is not a
nutritive fluid, the analogy goes no further than its secretion
into the open air, and its reabsorption into the system. The
perspirable matter is another material secreted by animal glands
into the external air, and is in part reabsorbed, and in part exhaled.
And every other secreted fluid in the animal body
is in part absorbed again into the system, even those which are
esteemed excrementitious, is the urine; and others are proba∣bly
entirely reabsorbed, as the bile, saliva, and gastric juice.</P>
<P>That the honey is a nutritious fluid, perhaps the most so of
any vegetable production, appears from its great similarity to
sugar, and from its affording sustenance to such numbers of in∣sects,
which live upon it solely during summer, and lay it up
for their winter provision. These proofs of its nutritive nature
evince the necessity of its reabsorption into the vegetable system
for some useful purpose.</P>
<P>3. It is probable, that the depredations of insects on this
nutritious fluid must be injurious to the products of vegetation;
and would be much more so, but that the plants have either
acquired means to defend their honey in part, or have learned
to make more, than is absolutely necessary for their own econo∣my.
Thus in silene, catch-fly, and in drosera, sun-dew, it is
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
defended by a viscid juice from the attack of insects; in helle∣bore,
and in aconite, it is defended by the difficult passage to it,
and by the acrid juice of the plant, if insects should endeavour
to creep into the nectary, or pierce it with their proboscis; and in
polygonum melampyrum, buck-wheat, and in cacalia suaveolens,
alpine colts-foot, there seems to be a superabundant quantity of
honey secreted, as those flowers are perpetually loaded with bees
and butterflies, insomuch that at Kempton-land in Germany,
Mr. Worlidge says, in his Mysteries of Husbandry, Ch. IX. 3.
that he saw forty great bee-hives filled with honey to the amount
of seventy pounds in each in one fortnight by their being placed
near a large field of buck-wheat in flower; and I well remember
being myself astonished at seeing the number of bees on a field of
buck-wheat in Shropshire, as well as on a plant of cacalia sua∣veolens
in my garden; from which the scent of honey could be
perceived at many feet distance from the flower.</P>
<P>In the same manner the honey-dew on trees is very injurious
to them; in which disease the nutritive fluid, the vegetable sap-juice,
seems to be exsuded by a retrograde motion of the cuta∣neous
lymphatics, as in the sweating sickness of the last century,
or is devoured by insects, which pierce the lymphatic vessels of
the leaves at midsummer, feed on the vegetable chyle, and void
it almost unchanged. See Sect. III. II. 8. and XIV. I. 7.</P>
<P>To prevent the depredation of insects on honey a wealthy man
in Italy is said to have poisoned his neighbour's bees, perhaps by
mixing arsenic with honey, against which there is a flowery de∣clamation
in Quintillian, No. XIII. This mixture of honey
and arsenic may be used with effect to poison flies, which some∣times
abound in pernicious multitudes; for the flies which fre∣quent
our houses are liable to great thirst, as is seen by their
drinking any fluid, which is diffused on a table; whence if a slight
solution of arsenic, with a little sugar, be put thinly on a plate or
two, and set on chimney-pieces or windows, the flies will ea∣gerly
drink it, and perish almost instantly. It is probable that
wasps might be thus destroyed in hot houses, if a little honey was
added to attract them by its odour.</P>
<P>As the use of the wax is to preserve the dust of the anthers
from moisture, which would prematurely burst them, the bees,
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
which collect this for the construction of the combs or cells, and
collect the farina also probably for bee-bread for their larvae or
maggots, must on both these accounts also injure the vegetation of
a country, where they too much abound.</P>
<P>4. It is not easy to conjecture, why it was necessary, that this
secretion of honey should be exposed to the open air in the nec∣tary
or honey-cup; for which purpose so great an apparatus for
its defence from insects and from showers became necessary.
This difficulty increases, when we recollect, that the sugar in the
joints of grass, in the sugar-cane; and in the roots of beets, and
in ripe fruits, is produced without exposure to the air. But on
supposition of its supplying nutriment to the anthers and stigmas,
it may thus acquire greater oxygenation for the purpose of pro∣ducing
the greater powers of amatorial sensibility, as mentioned
in Sect. IV. 5. 6. and probably in this circumstance alone differs
from sugar.</P>
<P>From this provision of honey for the male and female parts of
flowers, and from the provisions of sugar, starch and mucilage, in
the fruits, seeds, roots, and albarnum of plants, laid up for
the nutriment of the young progeny; not only a very numerous
class of insects, but a great part of the larger animals, procure
their food. Surely this must be called a wise provision of the
Author of nature, as by these means innumerable animals enjoy
life and pleasure without producing pain to others; for the em∣bryons
in these buds, seeds, or eggs, as well as the nutriment
laid up for them, are not yet endued with sensitive life. There
is another source of nutriment provided for young animals, which
still further evinces the benevolence of the Author of nature;
and that is the milk furnished by the mother to her offspring;
by this beautiful contrivance the mother acquires pleasure in
parting with a nutritious fluid; and the offspring in receiving it!</P>
<P>VII. 1. The wax is another vegetable secretion produced with
the fecundating dust on the anthers of flowers, which in wet
seasons it preserves from rain, to which it is impenetrable; for the
farina, or fecundating dust of plants; is liable to swell if exposed
to much moisture, and to burst its shell; and it either then be∣comes
inert and ineffectual, or i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> washed away. Whence Mr.
Wahlborn observes, that as wheat, rye, and many of the grasses,
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>
and plantain, lift up their anthers on long filaments; and thus ex∣pose
the enclosed fecundating dust to be washed away by the rains;
a scarcity of corn is produced in wet summers; hence the neces∣sity
of a careful choice of seed-wheat; as that, which had not
received the dust of the anthers, will not grow, though it may
appear well to the eye.</P>
<P>2. A substance similar to this is said to be collected from exten∣sive
underwoods of the cistus labdaniferus in some eastern coun∣tries
by this singular contrivance; long leathern thongs are tied
to poles, and drawn over the flowers of these shrubs about noon,
which thus collect the wax or resin with part of the anther-dust,
which adheres to the leathern thongs, and is occasionally
scraped off for use. Thus in some degree the depredation of the
bee is imitated, except that she loads her thighs only with the
anther-dust, which according to Mr. John Hunter constitutes the
bee-bread found in hives for the support of the larva or bee-mag∣got;
and that she swallows the wax for the construction of her
combs, as well as the honey for her winter provender; and thus
every way injures the fecundity of flowers.</P>
<P>3. A wax in America is obtained from the myrica cerifera,
candle-berry myrtle, the berries of which are boiled in water, and
the wax separates. The seeds of the croton febiferum are lodged
in a kind of tallow; in both these plants the wax or tallow pro∣bably
serves the purpose of preserving the immature seeds from
moisture; or like the oil found in flax-seed, rape-seed, and in
many kernels, they may constitute in part the nourishment of the
new plant.</P>
<P>It must nevertheless be observed, that Mr. Sparman suspects,
that the green wax-like substance on the berries of the myrica ce∣rifera
is deposited by insects. Voyage to the Cape, V. I. p. 145.
And Du Halde describes a white wax made by insects in great
quantity round the branches of a tree in China, which is called
Tong-t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in. Descript. of China, V. I. p. 230. And lastly, sir
G. Staunton mentions a white wax on a plant in Cochin-China,
which he believes to be strewed on the plant in the form of white
powder, which has this singular property, that one part of this
white powder mixed with three parts of olive oil made hot, gave
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
it when cold the consistence of bee's-wax. Embassy to China,
Vol I. p. 354.</P>
<P>VIII. 1. Turpentines or balsams, resins, and essential oils, are
analogous to the vegetable secretions last mentioned, in their
being inadmissible with water. Those vegetables, which contain
in their vessels the least water, bear cold climates the best; be∣cause
when water is frozen, it occupies more space than before;
and hence bursts the bottles which contain it; in the same manner
when any succulent vegetable is frozen, its vessels become burst or
bruised by the expansion of the ice, and the plant is destroyed; on
this account those parts of plants, which are the most juicy, as
the last shoots ofvines, are soonest destroyed in winter. Hence
many of the evergreen trees of this climate are replete with tur∣pentine
or resin, which by occupying the place of so much water,
contributes to their hardiness. There is also a partial secretion
of balsam or turpentine in many deciduous plants for the purpose
of defending their buds during the winter, both from frost and
from wet, which is repelled by their balsamic varnish, as on the
buds of the populus tacamahacca.</P>
<P>2. The balsams and resins of the shops are either extracted
from the wood by fire, or exsude from wounds of the tree; thus
what is called Venice turpentine is obtained from the larch by
wounding the bark about two foot from the ground, and catch∣ing
it as it exsudes. Sandarach is procured from common juniper,
and incense from another juniper; and there is reason to believe
that bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>men or petroleum, with jet, amber, and all the fossile
coal in the world, owes its inflammable part to the recrements of
destroyed forests of terebinthisate vegetables, so important to the
present race of mankind has been this vegetable secretion!</P>
<P>3. The essential oils are sometimes raised by distillation from
balsams or resins, as oil of turpentine; but are chiefly extracted
from flowers; where their office has been to prevent the depre∣dations
of insects; though many of them are so agreeable to the
human sense of smell, when these essential oils are dissolved or
mixed with water in distillation, they have been called the spiri∣tus
rector of the plant, and constitute the odour of it, whether,
aromatic or fetid.</P>
<P>Some of these essential oils possess the most poisonous qualities,
as those of lauro-cerasus, and of tobacco; and are used by Indian
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>
nations for the purpose of poisoning their weapons, which they
cover like a varnish. And hence some of the resinous woods are
said never to be devoured by insects, as the unperishable chests
of cypress, in which the Egyptian mummies have been preserved
for so many ages, and the cedar in which black lead is inclosed
for pencils.</P>
<P>The acrid poison of the large euphorbium of Africa exists in
the oil of that plant; as M. Vaillant observes, that the natives
sometimes poison the waters with slicing this plant into them, and
that the poisonous oil swims upon the surface, and may thus be
avoided by a careful drinker. This in a country where water is
scarce, and generally in stagnant pools, may be readily effected;
as a few spoonfuls of oil will cover a large sheet of water, as it be∣comes
diffused upon it without friction, as mentioned in Botanic
Garden, Vol. I. Addition. Note XXIX.</P>
<P>4. Some of the essential olis are so inflammable as to burst into a
vehement flame on being mixed with nitrous acid, as oil of cloves;
and even the small quantity diffused in the air round the dictam∣nus
fraxinella will take fire on a still evening at the approach of
a lighted candle.</P>
<P>5. With these should be arranged the elastic resin called Caout∣chouc,
which is said to exsude from a tree in Guaiana, called Ia∣tropha
elastica, by M. de la Borde, physician at Cayenne. A
similar elastic resin is said to be obtained from a plant in Mada∣gascar,
called Finguere, a kind of wild fig-tree, according to
Abbe Rochon; and the bird-lime extracted from the bark of
the hollies of our climate seems to be a similar material; as like
the caoutchouc it becomes soft by heat, and is impenetrable by
water, but soluble in ether. Another elastic substance, which
is insoluble in water, is procured from wheat by long mastication,
or by agitating the flour of it in water; which has been said to
approach to animal matter, and is believed to be the most nutri∣tious
part of that aliment, and was once much talked of, or sold
under the name of alimentary powder for the nourishment of
marching armies.</P>
<P>IX. 1. The bitter, narcotic, and acrid juices of plants are
secreted by their glands for the defence of the vegetable from the
depredation of insects and of larger animals. Opium is found
in the leaf, stalk, and head of the poppy but not in the seeds.
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
A similar narcotic quality exists in the leaf and stem of hyoscy∣amus,
hen-bane, but not in the seeds. An acrid juice exists in
busks of walnuts, and in the pellicle, or skin of the kernel; but
not in the lobes, or nutritious part of it. These seem to have
been excluded from the seed, lest they might have been injurious
to the tender organs of digestion of the embryon plant. In some
seeds, however there is a bitter quality, but which refuses to mix
with the oleagenous part; as the oil expressed from bitter almonds
is as tasteless as that from the sweet almonds.</P>
<P>2. Other vegetables possess glands adapted to the secretion of
various fluids more or less aromatic, acrid, or astringent; as the
herb of water-cress, the root of horse-radish, the seeds of mustard,
the flowers of roses, the fruit of quince and the bark of oak.
To these should be added those which have emetic and cathartic
qualities and other vegetable preparations, which are used in the
arts of dying, tanning, varnishing; and which supply the shops of
the druggist with medicines and with poisons. All which dele∣terious
juices seem to have been produced for the protection of
the plant against its enemies, as appears by the number of poisonous
vegetables, which are seen in all our hedge-bottoms and commons,
as hyoscyamus, cynoglossum, jacobaea, and common nettles;
which neither insects nor quadrupeds devour, and which are
therefore of no known use but to themselves; and possess a safer
armour in this panapoly of poison, than the thorns of hollies,
briars and gooseberries.</P>
<P>3. As the bitter, narcotic, acrid, and terebinthinate, as well
as the farinaceous, oily, and saccharine matters, are secreted in
summer from the vegetable blood, and reserved for the nutrition
and defence of the new buds and bulbs, they are in this climate
generally found more concentrated in the hybernaculum, or win∣ter-lodge
of plants, before the new sap is raised by the umbilical
or absorbent vessels in the spring. Hence roots and barks, as
well as fruits and seeds, are best collected in autumn, or in winter,
for the purposes of medicine or of other arts.</P>
<P>Thus the bark of oaks should be taken off for the use of the
tanner in the winter, or in early spring, before the leaves pullu∣late,
as then a great part of its astringent or bitter juices is reab∣sorbed,
and carried to the new foliage along with the saccharine
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
sap-juice, which has been deposited in the cells of the alburnum
or sap-wood. But as the barks of trees become looser, and much
more easily detached from the wood, when the sap-juice rises in
the spring, this is the best time for debarking them; but the naked
bole and branches should stand till autumn, till the saccharine
matter collected in the alburnum has been expended in unfolding
the new leaves; otherwise it will soon ferment and putrefy; and
the sap-wood will thus quickly decay by what is termed the dry-rot
of timber, as mentioned in Sect. III. 2. 3.</P>
<P>X. 1. The acids produced by vegetable secretion have of late
been much subjected to chemical inquiry, and have been found to
be so numerous, that they have been named from the vegetables,
or parts of vegetables, from which they have been extracted;
as the gallic acid, malic acid, oxalic acid. Many unripe fruits
contain an austere acid, which is gradually converted into sugar
by vegetable or chemical processes for the nutriment of their seeds,
as described in No. V. 4. of this section. In other plants it ex∣ists
in the foot-stalks of the leaves, as in rheum, rhubarb; or in
the leaves themselves, as in oxalis, sorrel; in these situations also
I suppose it is screted both for the defence of those plants from
the depredation of insects and of larger animals; and also for the
purpose of its being converted into a saccharine juice by the di∣gestion
of the young bud in the bosom of the leaf.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE ORGANS OF REPRODUCTION OF VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<Q>The theory of Linneus for vegetable reproduction too mechanical,
and without analogy. Every new fluid is secreted by glands, as
the liquor amnii and albumen ovi. So also is the favilla vitae, or
living entity. <HI>I. 1. Lateral progeny.</HI> The new bud is secret∣ed
in the axilla of the leaf, and requires no female apparatus. It
adheres to its parent not by inosculation of vessels, but resembles
the chick in the egg. 2. Difference of the chick and fetus. Their
nutriment and oxygenation. The embryon may be seen in the
buds of horse-chesnut. It is a paternal progeny. 3. This late∣ral
offspring resembles the parent. Not universally so. More
perfect than seeds. Buds of dioecious plants bear similar sexes.
The lateral progeny degenerates from hereditary diseases. Whence
curled potatoes, blighted strawberries, bears fruit at the same
time, and of the same kind. Plants live longer if prevented from
flowering. Art of producing double hyacinths, ranunculus, tu∣lips.
4. Lateral progeny of corallines and sea-anemonies.
Polypi are all males. Wires of knot grass like the joints of the
tape-worm, which are all males. 5. Aphis, viviparous and
oviparous like vegetable generation. 6. Vessels of the bud and
leaf do not inosculate. Viviparous, oviparous, and paternal
generation. 7. Leaves on twigs like the progeny of volvox.
But in same twigs the pith is divided, and the buds successive.
Hermaphrodite generation. Buds from every part of the caudex.
Those from below the graft are like the stock. Find numerous
uteri tike eggs and spawn. Paternal generation preceded sexual
generation. The last more excellent. <HI>II. 1. Sexual progeny.</HI>
Seeds before impregnation. Eggs before impregnation. Seed-embryon
suspended by opposite points like the cicatricula of the egg.
2. Seed-bud and flower. Stamens and stigmas. Males bend
to females, and females to males. Style of spartium bends round
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
like a French horn. Onanism of epilobium. Male flowers of
vallisneria swim to the females. Flowers with long filaments
injured by rain. Sub-marine plants project a liquor. 3. The
petals are respiratory organs. 4. Honey is the food of the an∣thers
and stigma; which like butterflies propagate and die.
5. Seeds are formed and nourished by the umbilical vessels pre∣vious
to fecundation, or by the bractes or floral leaves. Disper∣sion
of seeds by plumes, by hooks, by twisted awns. Creep on
the ground. Hygrometer of a geranium seed. 6. Sexual ge∣neration
the chef d'oeuvre of nature. Produces variety of species.
Mixed breed of cabbage. Mixed breed of beans. An apple
sour on one side. Vegetable mules. 7. Animal mules. They
externally resemble the male, internally the female. Mule from
the horse and female ass. From the mare and male ass. From
Spanish rams and Swedish ewes, and the contrary. From the
goat of Angora. Ram without horns. 8. How to improve
the varieties of fruits and flowers, and produce new ones. Many
plants were originally mules, and many animals. How to pro∣duce
new animal monsters, both quadrupeds and fish, by the
method of Spallanzani. Mules more frequent in antient times.
<HI>III. Vegetable generation.</HI> 1. A triple tree by ingraft∣ment.
The caudex of each bud is triple. Lateral or paternal
mules. Conferva fontinalis splits. 2. The lateral propagation
of the polypus. The hydra stentorea splits. Two halves of
different polypi unite. So the vegetable filaments or caudexes in
ingrafted trees. 3. Triple lateral mule. Each part of the
triple caudex is produced from that in its vicinity, not from the
plumula of the bud. 4. Worms multiplied by dividing them. So
the caudexes of the buds of trees. 5. The parts of the long
caudexes of trees are secreted from the adjoining parts of the
parent caudexes, and combine beneath the cuticle of the tree. Every
part of a compound caudex can produce a new bud, resem∣bling
the part of the compound stock, where it rises. Lateral
mules consist of parts from three or four parents. Could there
be a threefold sexual mule? 6. Power of attraction. Apti∣tude
to be attracted. Chemical combinations by single at∣traction.
By double affinity. 7. Union of animated bo∣dies
with inanimate matter, as in swallowing food. In ab∣sorption
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
by the lacteals. Vitality of the blood. Fibrils with nu∣tritive
appetencies. Molecules with nutritive propensities. 8.
Fibrils with formative appetencies, and molecules with formative
propensities secreted beneath the cuticle of trees, and coalesce.
Hunger and love, thirst, suckling children, they reciprocally sti∣mulate
and embrace each other. 9. Great secret of nature.
Formative or nutritive particles in the blood more than necessary.
Secreted by numerous glands. Arranged under the cuticle of
trees. Acquire new appetencies, and produce new parts. 10.
In sexual generation they are secreted by two glands only. Those
of the anther and pericarp unite in the matrix. 11. Without
formative molecules as well as formative fibrils there could be no
mules, or any resemblance to the mother. The new doctrine of
threefold vegetable mules applied to animal generation. 12. Con∣clusion.</Q>
<P>THE theory of Linneus in respect of the reproduction of ve∣getables
maintains, that the internal medullary part must be
joined with the external or cortical part of the plant for the
purpose of producing a new one. If the medulla be so vigorous
as to burst through its containing vessels, and thus mix with
the cortical part, a bud is produced either on the branches or
roots of vegetables; otherwise the medulla is extended, till it
terminates in the pistillum, or female part of the flower; and
the cortical part is likewise elongated, till it terminates in the
anthers, or male part of the flower; and then the fecundating
dust from the latter being joined to the prolific juices of the
former, produces the seeds or new plants; at the same time the
inner rind is extended into the corol or petal, and the outer
bark into the calyx.</P>
<P>After the seeds are thus produced, the parent bud dies; and
in this respect the buds bear a very great analogy to those an∣nual
insects, which change from their caterpillar or larva-forms,
putting forth painted wings and organs of reproduction, and
after deposing their eggs cease to exist. See the account of
the vegetable kingdom by Linneus, prefixed to the system of
vegetables translated by a botanical society at Lichfield, Leigh
and Sotheby, London.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="89"/>
However simple and ingenious the first part of this theory
may appear, in which the medulla is supposed to extend itself,
till it bursts the inclosing or cortical part, and joining with that
produces a new bud; yet it seems too mechanical for a living
organized system; and so totally different from any thing we
know of sexual production either in animals or flowers, as not
readily to satisfy a reasoning mind.</P>
<P>Every new fluid or solid produced in the organic system of
vegetable or animal bodies is secreted from their blood, as the
various fluids of bile, saliva, tears, in animals; and those of
gum, resin, sugar, in vegetables. Amongst these are the juices
which constitute the nutritious fluid of the amnios in the ute∣rus
of viviparous animals, or that of the albumen of the egg in
oviparous ones. And lastly, the flavilla vitae, the new spark of
being, or living entity, is also secreted from the blood of male
animals by adapted glands to be received into a proper nidus,
and nourished by the female.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>I. LATERAL PROGENY.</HEAD>
<P>1. As the leaf with its petiole, or foot-stalk, and its caudex
down the bark of a tree, with its radicle beneath, constitutes
an individual plant; and the bud in its bosom succeeds, and is
evidently produced by it; it may be concluded from the strongest
analogy that this new progeny is secreted from a gland or glands
of the parent; and that, as it adheres to the parent, it requires
no female apparatus for its reception, nourishment, or oxyge∣nation.</P>
<P>I was formerly induced to believe, that there was a commu∣nication
of blood, or inosculation of vessels between the parent
leaf, and the new bud in its bosom, as expressed in Zoonomia
Sect XXXIX. 2. 2. and that this constituted the difference
between paternal gestation and maternal gestation. But that
the vessels between the new bud and the parent leaf-bud do
not inosculate may be well seen by taking away the bark of the
foot-stalk of a leaf, and of the new bud in its bosom; as the re∣mains
of the arteries of the late leaf, as well as the rudiment of
the new bud, are seen to terminate in the alburnum, or to pe∣netrate
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
the pith, but without any apparent communication; and
I therefore suspect, that the embryon bud is not served with
vegetable blood from the vessels of the parent, but that it ac∣quires
both nutriment and oxygenation much in the same man∣ner
as the chick in the egg. See Sect. III. 1. 5.</P>
<P>2. The condition of the chick in the egg differs from that
of the fetus in the womb of viviparous animals in the whole of
its nutriment being at first provided for it, which consists of the
albumen, or white of the egg, which is contained in cells, and
is of different degrees of consistency, that which is most fluid
being first consumed; whereas the liquor amnii, or nutriment of
the fetus in utero, is gradually secreted by adapted glands from
the blood of the mother, as it is wanted.</P>
<P>Another difference between the condition of the chick and
of the fetus consists in the manner, by which their blood acquires
its necessary oxygenation. In the fetus this is done by means
of the placental vessels, whose extremities are inserted into the
blood-vessels of the uterus, and receive oxygen through their
moist membranes from the passing currents of the mother's
blood, as described in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXXVIII.
Whereas in the egg after a few days a incubation a membrane
is seen, which includes the albumen, and spreads the extremi∣ties
of its fine blood-vessels on the moist membrane, which co∣vers
the air at the broad end of the egg; which air is occasion∣ally
renewed, as would appear by its being seen so easily to pass
through the shell, when an egg is covered with water in the
exhausted receiver of an air-pump.</P>
<P>The condition of the embryon bud, when the parent leaf-bud
dies, I conceive to be similar to that of the chick in the egg,
when that is separated from its parent. Each of them has at
his time a reservoir of nutriment provided for it; that of the
chick consists of the albumen, or white of the egg above men∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned;
and that of the bud consists of mucilage and sugar, which
ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deposited in the alburnum or sap-wood, or in the roots of
the plant. And secondly, I conceive that the extremities of
a fine system of vessels belonging to the bud may terminate on
the moist membrane, which covers the horizontal air-vessels
as described in Sect. III. 2. 6. as those on the chorion of the
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
chick terminate on the air-bag of the egg, and thus acquire the
necessary oxygenation of their vegetable blood.</P>
<P>This analogy between the vegetable and animal fetus in re∣spect
to their production, nourishment, and oxygenation, is as
forcible in so obscure a subject, as it is curious; and may in large
buds, as of the horse-chesnut, be almost seen by the naked eye.
If with a penknife the remaining rudiment of the last year's leaf,
and of the new bud in its bosom, be cut away slice by slice,
the seven ribs of the last year's leaf will be seen to have arisen
from the pith in seven distinct points, making a curve; and the
new bud to have been produced in their center, and to have
pierced the alburnum and bark, and grown without the assist∣ance
of a mother.</P>
<P>And lastly, by in part cutting, and in part tearing, the pith
and alburnum from the bottom of a new leaf-stalk of horse-ches∣nut
about the middle of May, an oval prominence may be seen
in the internal part of the leaf-stalk, which fills up a space
between the vessels of the bottom of the leaf-stalk and those of
the new bud, and seems to connect them by its extremities, and
to press on the pith beneath it. From this apparent gland I
conjecture that the now living fibres, or animalcules, are pro∣bably
secreted, which form the new bud adhering to the pith,
and nourished by the parent leaf; that thus a paternal progeny
is produced without the assistance of a mother.</P>
<P>3. This paternal offspring of vegetables in their buds and
bulbs is attended with a very curious circumstance; and that is,
that they exactly resemble their parents, as is observable in graft∣ing
fruit-trees, and in propagating flower-roots; whereas the
seminal offspring of plants, being generated by two parents, and
certainly supplied with nutriment by the mother, is liable to
perpetual variation. This also in the vegetable class dioecia,
where the male flowers are produced on one tree, and the fe∣males
on another, the buds of the male-trees uniformly produce
either male flowers, or other buds similar to themselves; and
the buds of the female trees either produce female flowers, or
other buds similar to themselves; whereas the seeds of these
trees produce either male or female plants. See Sect. III. 2. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="92"/>
This similarity of buds and bulbs to their parents is to be
understood only to exist after the maturity of the plant, that is
after it has produced a sexual offspring in flowers and seeds;
for a bulb, as of a tulip, and a bud of a fruit-tree, when first
raised from their seeds, are very small, but produce one or more
improved bulbs, or improved buds annually, for some years;
which differ from their parent bulbs or buds in the size, form,
and colour of their leaves, till it arrives at its maturity, or ac∣quires
the power of generating a sexual progeny; from whence
it appears, that the leaf-buds of those trees, and the leaf-bulbs
of those roots, which have acquired their puberty, if it may be
so called; that is, their power of generating flowers, are a more
perfect progeny than the seeds of those plants, as these latter,
when separated from their parent either by transplantation or by
ingrafting, can immediately produce seeds, or a sexual progeny;
but the buds from many seeds are some years before they can
produce seeds. The same is probably true of many annual or
biennial plants, as of wheat; which produce many successive
buds upon each other previous to the flower-bud, as appears by
the joints of the stem; all which may be considered as individual
plants growing on each other like the annual succession of the
buds of trees.</P>
<P>Another curious occurrence in this lateral production of vege∣tables
by their buds has been lately published by Mr. Knight
in the Phil. Trans. for the year 1795, who observes that those
apple-trees, which have been continually propagated for above
a century by ingrafting, are now become so diseased by canker,
or otherwise, that though the fruit continues of the same flavour,
the trees are not worth propagating; as these grafts, though
transplanted into other trees, he esteems to be still an elonga∣tion
of the original tree, and must feel the effect of age like the
tree they were taken from. If this idea should prove true on
further examination, there is reason to suspect the same may
occur in the too long propagation of plants from bulbs and wires,
as potatoes and strawberries, which may have occasioned the
curled tops of potatoes, and the black blight in the flowers of
the hautbois strawberry, which some have ascribed to its only
bearing male flowers; the cure of which must arise from our
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
applying to other varieties more lately derived from a seminal
offspring.</P>
<P>This degeneracy of trees or perennial herbaceous plants pro∣pagated
by buds or root-scions is not I think to be ascribed sim∣ply
to the age of the original seedling-tree, because each suc∣cessive
generation of buds or bulbs are as distinct from the parent
as the generation by seeds. But as the lateral progeny of ve∣getables
have no source of improvement after they have arrived
at their maturity, but are liable like other plants and animals to
injuries from food and climate, which injuries produce here∣ditary
diseases, it is to this circumstance that their degeneracy
ought rather to be ascribed; whereas the sexual progeny of
vegetables are liable to improvement by the intermixture of the
individuals of the same, or even of different species to counter∣act
the effects of hereditary diseases.</P>
<P>Another curious similarity which buds bear to their parent
tree is also observed by Mr. Knight, Phil. Trans. for 1795,
Part II. p. 292. “Cuttings from seedling apple-trees of two
years old were inserted on stocks of twenty years old,” and in
a bearing state; but these have now been grafted nine years; and,
though they have been frequently transplanted to check their
growth, they have not yet produced a single blossom. I have
since grafted some very old trees with cuttings from seedling
apple-trees of five years old. Their growth has been extremely
rapid, and there appears no probability that their time of pro∣ducing
fruit will be accelerated, or that their health will be in∣jured
by the great age of the stocks. A seedling apple-tree
usually bears fruit in thirteen or fourteen years; and I therefore
conclude, that I have to wait for a blossom, till the trees from
which the grafts were taken, attain that age; though I have
reason to believe from the form of their buds that they will be
extremely prolific. Every cutting therefore taken from the
apple, and probably from every other tree, will be affected by
the state of the parent stock. If that be too young to produce
fruit, it will grow with vigour, but will not blossom; and if it
be too old, it will immediately produce fruit, but will never
make a healthy tree, and consequently never answer the inten∣tion
of the planter.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="94"/>
“The durability of the apple and pear I have long suspected
to be different in different varieties; but that none of either
would vegetate with vigour much, if at all, beyond the life of
the parent stock, provided that died from mere old age. The
oak is much more long-lived in the north of Europe than with
us, though the timber is less durable; the climate of this coun∣try,
being colder than its native one, may in the same way add
to the durability of the elm; which may possibly be further in∣creased
by its not producing seeds in this climate; as the life of
many annuals may be increased to twice its natural period, if not
more, by preventing their seeding.”</P>
<P>It is observed above, that the first bulb of a tulip raised from
seed produces a more perfect bulb annually for five or six years,
and perhaps more than one less perfect ones, before it acquires the
power of generating seeds. Now when this period arrives, if
the seed-stem be pinched off, I suppose that the next year's bulb
or bulbs will become more vigorous or luxuriant, and if this be
continued for three or four years I suspect the double flowers,
which are perhaps owing to a more luxuriant growth, may be
formed; and that in this, with superfluous nourishment by ma∣nure,
warmth and moisture, consists the art of obtaining hyacinths,
ranunculus, and sometimes tulips with such wonderful multiplica∣tion
of petals or nectaries. See Sect. XIX. 3. 1.</P>
<P>4. The analogy which exists between this lateral production
of vegetables and that of some tribes of insects, is worth
investigation. 1. This paternal or lateral generation of plants,
which constitutes the buds on the stems of trees, and the scions
on their roots, which continue to adhere to them, are so far re∣sembled
by the branching insects, which form the corals or co∣rallines;
and by many other sea-animals, as the sea anemonies,
which are said to adhere to the shores, or submarine earth, by one
extremity, while they pullulate, or spread out by the other into
living ramifications of unmeasurable lengths.</P>
<P>Those who have attended to the habits of the polypus, which
is found in the stagnant water of our ditches in July, affirm, that
the young ones branch out from the side of the parent like the
buds of trees; and after a time separate themselves from them.
This is so analogous to the manner in which the buds of trees
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
appear to be produced, that these polypi may be considered as
all male animals, producing embryons, which require no mother
to supply them with a nidus, or with nutriment and oxygenation.</P>
<P>Secondly, this paternal or lateral vegetable progeny is beauti∣fully
seen in the wires of knot-grass, polygonum aviculare; and
in those of strawberries, fragaria vesca; and in the roots of po∣tatoes.
The lateral generation of these plants by wires, while
each new plant is thus chained to its parent, and continues to
put forth another and another, as the wire creeps onward on or
beneath the ground, is exactly resembled by the tape-worm, or
taenia, so often found in the bowels, stretching itself in a chain
quite from the stomach to the rectum. Linneus asserts, “that
it grows old at one extremity, while it continues to generate
young ones at the other, proceeding ad infinitum, like a root of
grass. The separate joints are called gourd-worms, and propa∣gate
new joints like the parent without end, each joint being fur∣nished
with its proper mouth and organs of digestion.” Systema
Naturae, vermes, tenia: In this animal there evidently appears a
power of reproduction without any maternal apparatus for the
purpose of supplying nutriment and oxygenation to the embryon,
as it remains attached to its father till its maturity, and in this
respect exactly resembles the lateral generation of vegetables.</P>
<P>5. This subject of the lateral production of vegetables from
male parents without the intervention of a female is further re∣sembled
by the innumerable progeny of the aphis, which rises
from an egg in the spring, as a vegetable rises from a seed, and
produces a viviparous offspring for many generations like the suc∣cessive
buds of a seedling apple-tree, or of a seedling tulip; and
then it generates both males and females, which copulate and de∣posit
eggs, like the anthers and stigmas of flowers, and their con∣sequent
seeds; which at length appear on seedling apple-trees and
on seedling tulips; as is further spoken of in Sect. IX. 2. 7. and
XIV. 1. 6.</P>
<P>6. Whence I conclude, that in sexual viviparous generation
the new entity, or embryon, is secreted by the male, and received
into a nidus prepared for it by the female, and nourished by fluids,
secreted into the uterus, as they are required, which is probably
owing to the stimulus of the fetus against the sides of it; that in
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
sexual oviparous generation a reservoir of nutriment is prepared,
and inclosed in the egg previous to the reception of the embryon,
which is secreted by the mule, and deposited in this reservoir of
autriment; because the fetus in these animals is to be separated
from the parent before its due maturity; and the egg, in which it
is inclosed, may be considered as an uterus, or womb, separated
from the mother. And lastly, that in paternal or male generation
the new entity, or embryon, is as certainly secreted from a gland
of the male, but probably remains in an adapted reservoir belonging
to this gland, correspondent to the vesic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lae seminales of most vivi∣parous
animals, and that here it exists like the cicatricula in the
egg, and has a reservoir of nutriment prepared for it like that in
the egg to support it; when the paternal leaf-bud by its death is se∣parated
from it in the autumn, as the egg is separated from its
living mother.</P>
<P>7. The production of buds in the axilla of every leaf may thus
be easily conceived, as the new buds are furnished with their
caudexes or bark-filaments over those of their dead parents, which
shoot out root-fibres beneath in the ensuing spring, and that I
suppose both in deciduous plants and in evergreens; as in the
latter also I believe the parent leaf-bud annually falls off, though
not by the immediate influence of the cold of autumn. But how
long a twig or scion of leaves, as in the vine or willow, succeed
each other, some producing embryon buds in their bosoms before
others become expanded, is not easy to understand; but the em∣bryons
of all these new leaves, though not of the buds in their
bosoms, probably existed in the paternal womb, though in differ∣ent
degrees of maturity, which accords with the observations of
some naturalists on the successive generations of the volvox globa∣tor,
which Linneus asserts to be diaphanous, and that it carries
within itself sons and grandsons to the fifth generation, but which
are probably living fetuses produced by the father, of different
degrees of maturity, and to be detruded at different periods of
time like the unimpregnated eggs of various sizes, which are found
in poultry. See Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXXIX. 2. and
Linn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i System. Naturae. Vermes. Volvox.</P>
<P>In some trees however, as in the vine, vitis, and in many her∣baceous
plants, as in wheat, southistle, teasel, triticum, sonchus,
dypfacus, each successive joint of the plant is evidently an indivi∣dual
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
vegetable being; because the pith, which constitutes the
brain or spinal marrow of each individual, terminates at every
joint by a division, as spoken of in Sect. I. 8. whence in these
vegetables every successive joint appears to be produced by that
beneath it; whereas where there is no division of the pith, the
twig seems to be simply an elongation of the caudex of the leaf-bud,
like the wires of strawberries and other creeping plants.</P>
<P>It should nevertheless be added, that there are many herma∣phrodite
insects, as shell-snails and dew-worms, which contain both
male and female organs of generation; and as they are perpetually
seen to copulate with each other, it is believed, that they can not
impregnate themselves. Now it may be conceived, that the buds
of trees possess both male and female organs of generation, and
that they can impregnate themselves, and that thus the new buds
might be termed an hermaphrodite offspring rather than a paternal
one. This would however produce a confusion of terms, as the
eggs of snails and of worms, as mentioned above, are properly an
hermaphrodite offspring.</P>
<P>Another circumstance occurs in this paternal generation, which
differs from that of those hermaphrodite insects above alluded to,
which is, that though in vegetables the new embryon is gene∣rally
produced in the bosom of the leaf-stalk, which is believed
to be its parent; yet new buds are occasionally protruded from
almost any part of the bark, when the summit of a branch is taken
off, or the side branches of a tree, so as to admit light and air,
and a supply of more nutriment; whence it would seem, that
though hermaphrodite insects possess but one male and one fe∣male
apparatus for the production and reception of the new en∣tity
or embryon, yet that in paternal generation the prolific fluid
is occasionally secreted in any part of the caudex of each indivi∣dual
bud from its summit on the branch of a tree to its termina∣tion
in the root; and that wherever a proper nidus can be found,
which is supplied with nutriment, and exposed to light and air,
that there the new embryon can adhere and grow; although this
occurs most conveniently, and thence most frequently, in the
bosom of the leaf-stalk, where the prolific fluid is probably first
secreted, and the nutriment most copiously supplied from the ve∣getable
blood newly oxygenated in the leaf. In this I suppose
to consist the great difference between paternal and sexual genera∣tion;
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
and that this mode of reproduction forms an exception to
the general axiom of the great Harvey, “all things from eggs.”</P>
<P>The existence of a power of generation in every part of the
caudex of a vegetable bud from the summit to the root is not
only shewn by the new buds, which grow on the trunks of trees,
which were felled in the spring, but also from a curious circum∣stance
which occurs in ingrafted trees; which is, that whenever
after many years any new buds or scions grow from the stock be∣neath
the graft, it is always similar to the parent stock, and not
to the ingrafted scion; which shews, that this new bud was ge∣nerated
in the old stock, and not that it was owing to an absorp∣tion
and deposition of a prolific fluid secreted in any part of the
ingrafted head. It must however be remembered, that the cau∣dex
of each bud extends from the leaf-stalk to the root, whether
it be a simple caudex as in a seedling tree, or a compound one
as in a grafted tree; and that the generation of new buds in pe∣rennial
herbaceous plants exists in every part of the broad cau∣dex
on the root, as it does here in every part of the long caudex
on the trunk. Nothing known in the animal world resembles
this universality of the generative faculty throughout almost the
whole of an individual vegetable being, except the number of
new polypi said to arise at the same time from different parts of
the same individual animal.</P>
<P>Wherever the new vegetable embryons are secreted, they also
find a situation or uterus, where they can adhere and be nourished
to almost any number; which however is not unsupported by some
analogy even in viviparous animals; as there have been many in∣stances
of extra-uterine fetuses, which have attached or inserted
their vessels into the peritoneum, or on the viscera of the mother,
in the same manner as they naturally attach or insert them into the
sides of the true uterus. And in respect to the number of uteri
produced we may recollect the number of eggs, and of fish-spawn,
or frog-spawn, or of seeds, which may all be termed so many dis∣tinct
uteri, as they contain every thing, which is found in the
uteri of viviparous animals.</P>
<P>The aphis, and probably many other insects, possess both the
solitary and sexual mode of propagation, as is possessed by most
vegetables; but the polypus and tenia, and hydra stentorea, and
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
volvox, appear only to be reproduced by the solitary or lateral
generation; and it is probable that the truffle amongst vegetables,
and some sub-marine plants, and others of the class cryptogomia,
whose seeds have not been yet discovered, may still be only pro∣pagated
by the lateral mode of reproduction, as is well observed
in an ingenious work by a lady of very accurate botanic knowledge,
called “Botanic Dialogues, designed for the use of schools,”
one volume octavo, Johnson, London; but which may be strongly
recommended to the adult in botany as containing much useful
information agreeably imparted.</P>
<P>This curious subject of lateral or solitary generation is well
worthy more accurate investigation, as it is the simplest, and was
probably the first mode of reproduction which existed; and if
any accurate knowledge can ever be acquired of animal genera∣tion
it will possibly occur from a more nice attention to the pro∣duction
of the buds and bulbs of vegetables! which is further
spoken of in Sect. IX. 2 and 3. And at the same time it must
be observed, that the sexual reproduction is the chef d'ouvre, the
master-piece of nature, as by the paternal or lateral reproduction
the same species only are propagated ad infinitum; whereas by
the sexual mode of reproduction a countless variety of animals
are introduced into the world, and much pleasure is afforded to
those which already exist in it.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>II. SEXUAL PROGENY.</HEAD>
<P>1. We come now to the seminal mode of the production of ve∣getables,
which originates from the congress of the male and fe∣male
parts of flowers, and may be therefore termed the sexual or
amatorial progeny of vegetation.</P>
<P>From the accurate experiments and observations of Spallanzani
it appears, that in the Spartium Junceum, rush-broom, the very
minute seeds were discerned in the pod at least twenty days before
the flower is in full bloom; that is, twenty days before fecunda∣tion.
At this time also the powder of the anthers was visi∣ble,
but glued fast to their summits. The seeds however at this
time, and for ten days after the blossom had fallen off, appeared
to consist of a gelatinous substance. On the eleventh day after
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
the falling of the blossom the seeds became heart shaped, with
the basis attached by an appendage to the pod, and a white point
at the apex; this white point was on pressure found to be a cavity
including a drop of liquor.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fifth day the cavity, which at first appeared at
the apex, was much enlarged, and still full of liquor; it also
contained a very small semi-transparent body of a yellowish colour,
gelatinous, and fixed by its two opposite ends to the sides of the
cavity.</P>
<P>In a month the seed was much enlarged, and its shape changed
from a heart to a kidney; the little body contained in the cavity
was increased in busk, and was less transparent, and gelatinous,
but there yet appeared no organization.</P>
<P>On the fortieth day the cavity now grown larger was quite filled
with the body, which was covered with a thin membrane; after
this membrane was removed, the body appeared of a bright green,
and was easily divided by the point of a needle into two portions,
which manifestly formed the two lobes; and within these attached
to the lower part the exceedingly small plantule was easily per∣ceived.</P>
<P>The foregoing observations evince, 1. That the seeds exist in
the ovarium many days before fecundation. 2. That they remain
for some time solid, and then a cavity containing a liquid is
formed in them. 3. That after fecundation a body begins to ap∣pear
within the cavity fixed by two points to the sides, which in
process of time proves to be two lobes containing a planticle. 4.
That the ripe seed consists of two lobes adhering to a planticle, and
surrounded by a thin membrane, which is itself covered with a
husk or cuticle. Spallanzani's Dissertations, Vol. II. p. 253.</P>
<P>The analogy between seeds and eggs has long been observed,
and is confirmed by the mode of their production. The egg is
known to be formed within the hen long before its impregnation.
C. F. Wolf asserts, that the yolk of the egg is nourished by the
vessels of the mother, and that it has from those its arterial and
venous branches; but that after impregnation these vessels gra∣dually
become impervious and obliterated; and that new ones
are produced from the fetus, and dispersed into the yolk. Haller's
Physiol. Tom. VIII. p. 94. The young seed after fecundation
I suppose is nourished in a similar manner from the gelatinous
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
liquor, which is previously deposited for that purpose; the uterus
of the plant producing or secreting it into a reservoir or amnios,
in which the embryon is lodged; and that the young embryon
is furnished with vessels to absorb a part of it, as in the very
early state of the embryon in the egg.</P>
<P>Another curious analogy seems to exist between the embryon
of the seed and of the egg in their mode of suspension. The
cicatricula of the egg rests on the yolk, which is suspended by
two points, called chalazae, somewhat above its center of
gravity; whence, however the egg is moved, this embryon is
always kept upwards, probably the better to receive the warmth
of the mother during incubation. The seed embryon seems to
be supported in the same manner by the above relation of Spal∣lanzani
by two points, and may thus receive a greater warmth
from the summer sun.</P>
<P>2. The seeds are thus produced in their unimpregnated state in
the vegetable uterus, and nourished by the flower-bud, which
was formed in the deciduous trees of this climate during the
preceding summer, and which now puts forth the bractes, or
floral-leaves, for the oxygenation of its blood; and protrudes
its roots and absorbents into the ground from the lower part of
its caudex, for the purpose of acquiring nourishment; and on
the summit of this sexual apparatus are at the same time pro∣duced
the corol and nectaries of the flower, with the stamens, and
stigmas, which are evidently designed to give fecundation to
the vegetable seeds, or eggs, previously deposited in the peri∣carp
or uterus; because, as soon as these are impregnated, the
corol and nectaries, with the stamens, and stigmas, fall off and
disappear.</P>
<P>The anthers have been proved by many experiments to be
necessary to the fecundation of the vegetable seeds by the farina,
or dust, which they disperse, and which adheres to the moist
stigma on the summit of the style or pericarp. The amatorial
attachment between these stigmas and the anthers on the sum∣mits
of the stamens has attracted the notice of all botanists. In
many flowers the anthers or males bend into contact with the
stigmas or females, as in kalmia, fritillaria persica,
parnassia, cactus, and cistus. In the kalmia the ten stamens lie round
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
the pistil, like the radii of a wheel, and each anther is conceal∣ed
in a nich of the corol to protect it from cold and moisture;
these anthers rise separately from their niches, and approach the
stigma of the pistil for a time, and then recede to their former
situations. In <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fritillaria persica the six stamens are of equal
lengths, and the anthers lie at a distance from the pistil; of
these three alternate ones approach first, and surround the fe∣male;
and when these decline, the other three approach; and
in parnassia the males alternately approach and recede from the
female; and lastly in the most beautiful flowers of cactus gran∣diflorus;
and of cistus labdaniferous, where the males are very
numerous, some of them are perpetually bent into contact with
the female; and as they recede, others advance.</P>
<P>In other flowers the females bend into contact with the males,
as in nigella, epilobium, spartium, collinsonia. In nigella, devil
in the bush, the females are very tall compared to the males,
and bending down over them in a circle, give the flower some
resemblance to a regal crown. The female of the epilobium
angustifolium, willow-herb, bends down amongst the males for
several days, and becomes upright again when impregnated. In the spartium scoparium, common broom, the males or stamens
are in two sets, one set rising a quarter of an inch above the
other. The upper set does not arrive at their maturity so soon
as the lower; and the stigma, or head of the female, is pro∣duced
amongst the upper or immature set. But as soon as the
pistil grows tall enough to burst open the keel-leaf, or head of
the flower, it bends itself round in an instant like a French
horn, and inserts its head, or stigma, amongst the lower or ma∣ture
set of males. The pistil or female then continues to grow
in length; and in a few days the stigma arrives again amongst
the upper set, by the time they become mature. This wonder∣ful
contrivance is readily seen by opening the keel-leaf of the
flowers of broom before they burst spontaneously. And lastly,
in the collinsonia the two males widely diverging from each
other, the female bends herself into contact first with one of
them; and after a day or two leaves this, and applies herself
to the other; the anther of which was not mature so soon as
the former. See Sect. VIII. 8. of this work.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="103"/>
Dr. Peschier of Geneva thinks, he has discountenanced this
idea of amatorial sensibility of vegetables by two experiments,
which are related in Journal de Physique de Lametherie, T. II.
p. 343. One of these consisted of his tying down the stigma
of epilobium angustifolium, and yet in due time the anthers
burst and shed their pollen, and thus committed a kind of vege∣table
Onanism; and also that he castrated the stamens of this
flower, and yet the stigma opened and arose, as if the anthers
had been present. The other experiment consisted in his con∣fining
a branch of barbery, berberis, in a glass, and subjecting
the stamina of the flowers to the vapour of nitrous acid, which
by this stimulus arose from their petals to the stigma, and after
a few minutes again retired to their petals. Both these experi∣ments
rather seem to confirm than to enfeeble the analogy be∣tween
plants and animals; as the amatorial motions of these
flowers were thus produced by internal or external stimuli, as in
the healthy or diseased states of animals.</P>
<P>Another mode, in which the prolific dust is dispersed, is by
the bursting of the anther, and its consequent diffusion in air,
either so as to make a cloud near the females, which exist in
the same flower, or on the same plant, which is the most usual
manner; or by its being carried by the winds to a greater di∣stance,
as in the flowers of the class monoecia, or one house. So
in urtica, nettle, the male flowers are separate from the female,
and the anthers are seen in fair weather to burst with force,
and to discharge their dust, which hovers about the plant like a
cloud.</P>
<P>In plants of the class dioecia, or two houses, the fecundating
farina is carried to the distance of many miles by the winds, as
has been proved by the impregnation of some female date trees,
which were at a great distance from the male ones. And the
male flowers themselves of vallisneria are carried many miles
down the rivers, which it inhabits, to the female ones. This
plant has its roots at the bottom of the Rhone; the flowers of
the female plant float on the surface of the water, and are fur∣nished
with an elastic spiral stalk, which extends or contracts,
as the water rises and falls. The flowers of the male plant are
produced under water, and as soon as their farina, or dust, is
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
mature, they detach themselves from the plant, and rise to the
surface, continue to flourish, and are wafted by the air, or
borne by the currents, to the female flowers. In this resem∣bling
those tribes of insects, where the males at certain seasons
acquire wings, but not the females, as ants, coccus, lampyris,
phalaena, brumata, lichanella. See vallisneria in the Families
of plants, translated from Linneus. Johnson, London.</P>
<P>The plants, which grow in the air, are frequently injured
in wet seasons by the moisture occasioning the cells of the an∣thers,
which contain the fecundating farina, to burst, and to
shed it on the ground. To which a scarcity of the quantity of
wheat, or an imperfection of its fecundating quality, and the
ustilago, or smut, have rationally been ascribed, as its anthers
are exposed on long filaments to the weather. On this account
many flowers close their corols before rain, and the aquatic
plants of rivers perform their impregnations in the air. But M.
Bonnet remarks another method of the dispersion of the fecun∣dating
influence of some marine plants, in which the male organ
does not project a fine powder, but a liquor, which forms a
perceptible cloud in the water; and adds, that the male sala∣mander
darts his semen into the water, where it forms a whitish
cloud, which is afterwards received by the swollen anus of the
female, and she becomes impregnated. Nor is this vegetable
impregnation in water unanalogous to other animal impregna∣tions,
as the spawn of frogs and of fish is delivered from the fe∣male
before it is fecundated; and its fecundation is seen to suc∣ceed
in water; and Spallanzani found, that the seminal fluid
even of dogs, as well as of frogs, retained its prolific quality
when diluted with much water. Bonnet's Oeuvres Philos. in a
letter to Spallanzani.</P>
<P>3. The other parts, which rise on the edge of the pericarp,
and expand themselves before the impregnation of the seed, are
the corol and nectaries. The former of these has been shewn
to be a respiratory organ for the purpose of oxygenating the
blood to a greater degree than in the green foliage, as it is there
exposed to the air beneath a finer pellicle, and acquires variety
of colours. See Sect. IV. 5. 1. to which may be added, that
as the corol in helleborus niger, Christmas rose, changes after
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
the fecundation of the seed into a calyx, losing its white colour,
and becoming green. So in many flowers the calyx falls off
along with the corol; in these it should be esteemed a part of
or appendage to the corol; whereas those calyxes, which are
permanent after the corol falls off, are properly parts of the
pericarp or vegetable uterus.</P>
<P>4. The nectary, or honey-cup, is evidently an appendage to
the corol, and is the reservoir of the honey, which is secreted
by an appropriate gland from the blood after its oxygenation in
the corol, as mentioned in Sect. IV. 5. 5. and is absorbed for
nutriment by the sexual parts of the flower. This purpose
however has as yet escaped the researches of philosophical bo∣tanists.
M. Pontedera believes it designed to lubricate the
vegetable uterus. (Antholog. p. 49.) Others have supposed,
that the honey, when reabsorbed, might serve the purpose of
the liquor amnii, or white of an egg, as a nutriment for the
young embryon, or fecundated seed, in its early state of exist∣ence.
But as the nectary is found equally general in male
flowers as in female ones, and as the young embryon, or seed,
grows before the petals and nectary are expanded, and after
they fall off; these seem to be insurmountable objections to both
the above-mentioned opinions.</P>
<P>In many tribes of insects, as the silk-worm, and perhaps in
all the moths aud butterflies, the male and female parents die,
as soon as the eggs are impregnated and excluded, the eggs re∣maining
to be perfected and hatched at some future time. The
same thing happens to the male and female parts of flowers;
the anthers and filaments, which constitute the male parts of the
flower, and the stigma and style, which constitute the sensitive
or amatorial organ of the female part of the flower, fall off and
die, as soon as the seeds are impregnated, and along with these
the petals and nectary. Now the moths and butterflies above
mentioned, as soon as they acquire the passion and the appara∣tus
for the reproduction of their species, lose the power of feed∣ing
upon leaves, as they did before, and become nourished by
what?—by honey alone.</P>
<P>Hence we acquire a strong analogy for the use of the nectary,
or secretion of honey, in the vegetable economy; which is, that
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
the male parts of flowers, and the female parts, as soon as they
leave their fetus-state, expanding their petals, (which constitute
their lungs) become sensible to the passion, and gain the apparatus,
for the reproduction of their species; and are fed and nou∣rished
with honey like the insects above described; and that
hence the nectary begins its office of producing honey, and dies
or ceases to produce honey, at the same time with the birth and
death of the anthers and the stigmas; which, whether existing
in the same or in different flowers, are separate and distinct ani∣mated
beings.</P>
<P>Previous to this time the anthers with their filaments, and
the stigmas with their styles, are in their fetus-state sustained in
some plants by their umbilical vessels, like the unexpanded leaf-buds,
as in colchicum autumnale, and daphne mezereon; and in
other plants by the bractes, or floral-leaves, as in rhubarb, which
are expanded long before the opening of the flower; the seeds
at the same time existing in the vegetable womb yet unimpreg∣nated,
and the dust yet unripe in the cells of the anthers. After
this period the petals become expanded, which have been shewn
to constitute the lungs of the flower; the umbilical vessels, which
before nourished the anthers and the stigmas, coalesce, or cease
to nourish them; and they acquire blood more oxygenated by
the air, obtain the passion and power of reproduction, are sensi∣ble
to heat, and light, and moisture, and to mechanic stimulus,
and become in reality insects fed with honey; similar in every
respect except that all of them yet known but the male flowers
of vallisneria, continue attached to the plant, on which they are
produced.</P>
<P>So water insects, as the gnat, and amphibious animals, as
the tad-pole, acquire new aerial lungs, when they leave their
infant state for that of puberty. And the numerous tribes of
caterpillars are fed upon the common juices of vegetables found
in their leaves, till they acquire the organs of reproduction; and
then they feed on honey, all I believe except the silk-worm,
which in this country takes no nourishment after it becomes a
butterfly. And the larva or maggot of the bee, according to
the observations of Mr. Hunter, is fed with raw vegetable mat∣ter,
called bee-bread, which is collected from the anthers of
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
flowers, and laid up in cells for that purpose, till the maggot
becomes a winged bee, acquires greater sensibility, and is fed
with honey. Phil. Trans. 1792.</P>
<P>Lastly, though the filaments and style, as well as the corolla
and nectary, belonging to the sexual organs of vegetables; yet
it is the anthers alone of the stamina, and stigmas alone of the
pistilla, which possess the power, and I suppose the passion of
reproduction, as appears from the mutilated filaments of many
flowers, as of curcuma, of linum or flax of this country, of
gratiola, and hemlock-leaved geranium, which have half their
stamina unterminated by anthers, and in consequence produce
no prolific farina. And secondly, from the florets, which form
the rays of the flowers of the order frustraneous polygamy of
the class syngenesia, as the sun-flower, which are furnished with
a style only, and no stigma, and are thence barren. There is
also a style without a stigma in the whole order of dioecia gynan∣dria,
the male flowers of which are thence barren, and shews
the necessity of the existence of the stigma to the fecundation of
the vegetable uterus, probably owing to its amatorial action in
conveying the living principle to the included seeds like the
fallopian tubes of the animal womb.</P>
<P>5. The seeds are produced in the pericarp, and at first ac∣quire
nutriment by the umbilical vessels previous to their fecun∣dation,
like the unexpanded leaf-buds; and then by the caudex
down the bark with its radicles, which is oxygenated by the
bractes, or floral-leaves, as soon as these are expanded, they
afterwards become in one day impregnated in some flowers, as
in the oenothera, cactus grandiflorus, and cistus; and the co∣rol
or petals, with the stamens and stigmas, and nectaries, wither
and fall off. In other flowers many days elapse before the
various cells of seeds are fecundated, and these more animated
parts of sexual reproduction perish. But in all cases the seeds
remain in the pericarp or uterus after fecundation as before it,
except in those plants, which are called proliferous, as the poly∣gonum
viviparum, and magical onions, which immediately be∣gin
to vegetate; in all other plants the seed either sleeps till the
ensuing spring, as in the colchicum and hamamelis; or they
continue to grow to maturity, and to be nourished in the peri∣carp
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
by the blood of the parent flower-bud, which is oxygenated
in the bractes or floral-leaves, till they become perfected like
eggs, and fall on the ground, or are otherwise dispersed, for the
purpose of taking root in the earth.</P>
<P>Whence it appears, that in the sexual reproduction of vegeta∣bles
the amatorial organ is distinct from the uterus, as is probably
the case in animals; which in female quadrupeds would seem to
sleep after impregnation during the time of gestation and lacte∣scence,
and afterwards to revive; whereas this amatorial organ
in vegetable flowers perishes, when the uterus is impregnated,
along with the male organs, neither of which are any longer of
use in these annual beings.</P>
<P>The various methods, which nature has employed for the dis∣persion
of seeds, are worth the attention of the farmer and gar∣dener,
both for the purpose of preventing the growth of noxious
seeds, and of collecting the profitable ones. The pericarp of
some plants bursts with sudden violence, when the seed is mature,
and disperses it to considerable distance; as that of wood-sorrel,
oxalis acetocalla; and of impatiens, touch me not. The seeds
of many plants of the class syngenesia are furnished with a plume,
by which admirable mechanism they are disseminated by the
winds far from their parent stem, and look like a shuttlecock, as
they fly. Other seeds are disseminated by animals; of these
some attach themselves to their hair or feathers by a gluten, as
misletoe; others by hooks, as clivers, galium aperine; burdock,
arctium lappa; hound's-tongue, cynoglossum. Others are swal∣lowed
whole for the sake of the fruit, and voided uninjured, as
the hawthorn, crataegus juniper and some grasses. And the
seeds of aquatic plants, and of those which grow on the banks
of rivers, are carried many miles by the currents into which they
fall.</P>
<P>Other seeds are separated from each other, and dispersed by
the twisting of the awn at the summit of them, when moistened
by rain, as a black oat, avena fatua, with hairy awns which seems
to crawl like an insect when moistened; geranium also, and
barley; and as this happens in wet weather, the moist ground
is then fit to receive and nourish them. The awns of the gera∣nium
have been used as hygrometers by sticking the base of the
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
seed into a cork for a pedestal, and marking divisions on a paper
circle beneath it; and the awn of barley is furnished with stiff
points, which, like the teeth of a saw, are all turned towards one
end of it; as this long awn lies upon the ground, it extends it∣self
in the moist air of night, and pushes forward the barley-corn,
which it adheres to; in the day it shortens as it dries;
and as these points prevent it from receding, it draws up its
pointed end; and thus, creeping like a worm, will travel many
feet from the parent stem; and may thus be used as a travelling
hygrometer, when laid on a cloth on the floor like the automa∣ton
of Mr. Edgeworth, described in Botanic Garden, article
Impatiens, Vol. II.</P>
<P>6. The formation of the organs for sexual generation, in con∣tradistinction
to those for lateral generation, in vegetables, and in
some animals, as the polypus, the taenia, and the volvox, seems
the chef d'oeuvre, the master-piece of nature, as appears from
many flying insects, as moths and butterflies, which seem to un∣dergo
a general change of their forms solely for the purpose of
sexual reproduction; and in all other animals these organs are
not complete till the maturity of the cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ature; whereas the lateral
generation commences with the infancy of the germ or bud, as
on the roots of young herbs, and on the stems of infant trees.</P>
<P>There seems nevertheless to be one circumstance, in which the
solitary generation of the buds of plants, when the plants are
at their maturity, is superior to the sexual generation by seeds.
This consists in the progeny of the former being more perfect
than that of the latter, in respect to the power of the reproduction
of their species. Thus in many plants, as in tulips and ap∣ple-trees,
the young vegetable from the seed produces other bulbs,
or buds, for some years, which seem annually to improve till at
length they acquire a puberty, if it may be so called, and be∣come
furnished with sexual organs for the purpose of seminal re∣production;
whereas the leaf-buds, or leaf-bulbs, of the apple-tree
and tulip during their first years produce other leaf-buds, or
leaf-bulbs, rather more perfect than their parents; and when these
bulbs, and buds, arrive at their puberty, or maturity, so as to
be capable of sexual generation, their new bulbs and new buds
also, if taken from their dying parents, and transplanted or in∣grafted,
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
or left adhering to them, are immediately capable of
producing flowers, and a consequent seminal progeny.</P>
<P>As the progeny by lateral generation so exactly resembles the
parent stock, it follows, that though any new variety, or improve∣ment,
may be thus continued for a century or two, as in grafted
fruit-trees, yet that no new variety or improvement can be ob∣tained
by this mode of generation; though some hereditary dis∣eases,
as the canker, are believed to arise in ingrafted trees which
have long been propagated by lateral generation as explained in
No. 1. 3. of this Section.</P>
<P>But from the sexual, or amatorial, generation of plants new
varieties, or improvements, are frequently obtained; as many of
the young plants from seeds are dissimilar to the parent, and some
of them superior to the parent in the qualities we wish to possess;
which is another proof that the anthers and stigmas of plants are
animated beings, different from the green foliage of the tree on
which they grow; as they produce varieties in the form of their
offspring like sexual animals, which buds do not.</P>
<P>Besides the production of different, and sometimes more excel∣lent,
varieties in the species of vegetables from seeds, another ad∣vantage
occurs from sexual generation, which is the production of
new species of plants, or mules, by shedding the fecundating dust
of some flowers on the stigmas of others of a different species,
though generally of the same genus.</P>
<P>A mule cabbage is described in the Bath Agriculture, Vol I.
Art. 4, which is said to fatten a beast six weeks sooner than tur∣neps.
It is there said, “that the sort of cabbage principally
raised is the tallow-loaf or drum-head cabbage; but it being too
tender to bear sharp frost, I planted some of this sort and the
common purple-cabbage used for pickling, (it being the hardiest I
am acquainted with) alternately; and when the seed-pods were
perfectly formed, I cut down the purple, and left the other for
seed. This had the desired effect, and produced a mixt stock of
a deep green colour with purple veins, retaining the size of the
drum head, and acquiring the hardiness of the purple.”</P>
<P>In another curious paper of the Bath Society, Vol. V. p. 38,
Mr. Wimpey relates, that he planted a field with garden-beans
in rows about three feet asunder in the following order, mazagan,
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
white-blossom, long-podded, Sandwich-toker, and Windsor-beans.
The mazagan and white-blossom were threshed first,
when to his great surprise he found many new species of beans;
those from the mazagan were mottled black and white; the white-blossoms
were brown and yellow instead of their natural black;
and they were both much larger than usual. See Sect. XVI. 4.
of this work.</P>
<P>There is an apple described in Bradley's work, which is said
to have one side of it a sweet fruit, which boils soft, and the
other side a sour fruit which boils hard. This Mr. Bradley so
long ago as the year 1721 ingeniously ascribes to the farina of one
of these apples impregnating the other; which would seem the
more probable, if we consider, that each division of an apple is a
separate womb, and may therefore have a separate impregnation,
like puppies of different kinds in one litter. The same is said to
have occurred in oranges and lemons, and grapes of different co∣lours.</P>
<P>Vegetable mules are said to be numerous, and, like the mules
of the animal kingdom, not always to continue their species by
seed. There is an account of a curious mule from the antirrhinum
linaria, toad-flax, in the Amoenit. Academ. V. I. No. 3. and
many hybrid plants, are described in No. 32. The urtica alienata
is an evergreen plant; which appears to be a nettle from the male
flowers, and a pellitory (parietaria) from the female ones and the
fruit, and is hence between both. Murray, Syst. Veg. Amongst
the English indigenous plants, the veronica hybryda, mule speed-well,
is supposed to have originated from the officinal one, and
the spiked one; and the Sibthorpia Europaea to have for its pa∣rents
the golden saxifrage and marsh pennywort. Pulteney's
View of Linneus, p. 253.</P>
<P>There is another vegetable fact published by M. Koelruter,
which he calls “a complete metamorphosis of one natural species
of plants into another;” which shews, that in seeds as well as in
buds, the embryon proceeds from the male parent, though the
form of the subsequent mature plant is in part dependent on the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emale. M. Koelruter impregnated a stigma of the nicotiana
rustica with the farina of the nicotiana paniculata, and obtained
prolific seeds from it. With the plants, which sprung from these
seeds, he repeated the experiment, impregnating their pistilla with
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
the farina of the nicotiana paniculata. As the mule plants, which
he thus produced, were prolific, he continued to impregnate
them for many generations with the farina of the nicotiana pani∣culata,
and they became more and more like the male parent,
till he at length obtained six plants in every respect perfectly
similar to the nicotiana paniculata, and in no respect resembling
their female parent the nicotiana rustica. Blumenback on Gene∣ration.</P>
<P>Mr. Graberg, Mr. Schreber, and Mr. Ramstrom, seem of opi∣nion,
that the internal structure or parts of fructification in mule
plants resemble the female parent; but that the habit or external
structure resembles the male parent. See treatises under the
above names in Vol. VI. Amoenit. Academic.</P>
<P>7. Something similar to this seems to obtain in mixing the
breeds of the same species of animals, and in animal mules, which
may be worth the attention of the grazier. The mule produced
from a horse and a she ass resembles the horse externally with his
ears, mane, and tail; but with the nature, or manners of an ass.
But the hinnus, or creature produced from a male ass and a
mare, resembles the father externally in stature, ash-colour, and
the black cross on his shoulders, but with the nature or manners
of a horse. The breed from Spanish rams and Swedish ewes re∣sembled
the Spanish sheep in wool, stature, and external form;
but was as hardy as the Swedish sheep; and the contrary oc∣curred
in the breeds which were produced from Swedish rams
and Spanish ewes. The offspring from the male goat of Angora
and the Swedish female goat had long soft camel's hair; but that
from the male Swedish goat, and the female one of Angora, had
no improvement of their wool. An English ram without horns,
and a Swedish horned ewe, produced sheep without horns.
Amoen. Acad. Vol. VI. p. 13.</P>
<P>8. From these circumstances it appears, that not only new varie∣ties
may be procured from the seminal offspring of plants;
where those from the lateral offspring become diseased by age, as
the cankered apple-grafts, and perhaps the curled potatoes, and
barren strawberries; but that more curious or useful fruits or
flowers may be obtained by shedding the farina of some valuable
plant on the stigma of another variety of the same species, as of
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
two different but equally excellent apple-trees, or tulip-flowers,
hyacinths, anemonies, and geraniums. And thirdly, that mules
may be produced by a mixture of different species of plants, and
perhaps of different genera; as of pines and melons; grapes and
gooseberries; oranges and apples; apricots and nectarines; nuts
and acorns; which may be afterwards propagated by the lateral
progeny, if not by the seminal one.</P>
<P>The facility of generating vegetable mules seems forcibly to
have struck the great Linneus; who in the preface to his natural
orders of plants at the end of his Genera Plantarum thinks, that
about sixty vegetables were at first created corresponding with his
natural orders. That a mixture of these orders amongst them∣selves
produced the genera; that a mixture of the genera amongst
themselves produced the species; and that a mixture of the spe∣cies
produced the varieties, which he believes to accord with the
general progress of nature <HI>“from simpler things to the more com∣pound.”</HI></P>
<P>In the same manner it may be supposed, that many of the
present species of animals were originally mules produced by a
mixture of animals of different genera; and that all such mules,
as had perfect organs of reproduction, continued their species.
But as these organs seem to be the chef d'oeuvre of nature, as
above remarked, they often become imperfect in the generation
of mules, and the species then becomes extinct; as it could not
be propagated by sexual generation, it is possible, that many new
kinds of mules, which might be useful for labour, or by their
milk or wool, or for food, might still be produced by the method
of Spallanzani; who diluted the seminal fluid of a dog with much
warm water, and by injecting it fecundated a bitch, and produced
puppies like the dog.</P>
<P>Thus new animal combinations might possibly be generated
numerous as the fabled monsters of antiquity; as between the
ram and the female goat; the stag and the cow; the horse and
the doe; the bull and the mare; boar and bitch; dog and sow.
And secondly, as Spallanzani diluted the seminal fluid of a male
frog with water, and fecundated some female spawn with it, and
produced perfect tadpoles, there is reason to conclude, that new
combinations of fish might thus be generated, and people our
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
rivers with aquatic monsters. And lastly, that it is not impossi∣ble,
as some philosopher has already supposed, if Spallanzani
should continue his experiments, that some beautiful productions
might be generated between the vegetable and animal kingdoms,
like the eastern fable of the rose and nightingale, and which might
be propagated by lateral or paternal though not by sexual or se∣minal
generation.</P>
<P>The classic reader will here be reminded of the metamorpho∣ses
of Ovid, of gods turned into bulls and swans, men into frogs
and partridges, ladies into trees and flowers, of sphinxes, griffins,
dragons, mermaids, centaurs, and minataurs; Pasiphae and her
bull; Leda and her swan; Arethusa and her fish-god Alpheus,
and conclude that mules in early times were more frequent than
at present, which occasioned the poets and the priests of antiquity
to invent so many fabulous monsters, and impose them on the
credulity of mankind.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>III. VEGETABLE GENERATION.</HEAD>
<P>1. The intelligent reader is become, I hope, by this time so
much interested in the further investigation of the circum∣stances
attending the lateral and sexual generation of vegetables,
that he will not be displeased with the continuance of the sub∣ject
for a few more pages, so agreeable from its novelty, and so
important from its future application to animal reproduction.</P>
<P>If a scion of a nonpareil apple be ingrafted on a crab-stock,
and a golden pippin be ingrafted on the nonpareil, what happens?
The ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dex of the bud of the golden pippin consists of its proper
absorbent vessels, arteries, and veins, till it reaches down to the
the nonpareil-stock; and then the continuation of its caudex
downwards consists of vessels similar to those of the nonpariel;
when its caudex descends still lower, it consists of vessels similar
to those of the crab-stock.</P>
<P>The truth of this is shewn by two circumstances; first, because
the lower parts of this compound tree will occasionally put forth
buds similar to the original stock. And secondly, because in
some ingrafted trees, where a quick-growing scion has been in∣serted
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
into a stock of slower growth, as is often seen in old cher∣ry-trees,
the upper part of the trunk of the tree has become of
almost double the diameter of the lower part; both which occur∣rences
shew, that the lower part of the trunk of the tree continues
to be of the same kind, though it must have been so repeatedly
covered over with new circles of wood, bark and cuticle.</P>
<P>Now as the caudex of each bud, which passes the whole length
of the trunk of the tree, and forms a communication from the
upper part, or plumula, to the lower part, or radicle, must consist
in these doubly ingrafted trees of three different kinds of cau∣dexes,
resembling those of the different stocks or scions; we ac∣quire
a knowledge of what may be termed a lateral or paternal
mule, in contradistinction to a sexual mule. For as in these trees
thus combined by ingraftment every bud has the upper parts of
its caudex that of a golden pippin, the middle part of it that of a
nonpareil, of the lower part of it that of a crab; if these cau∣dexes,
which constitute the filaments of the bark, could be sepa∣rated
entire from the tree with their plumules and radicles, they
would exhibit so many lateral or paternal mules, consisting of the
connected parts of their three parents; the plumula belonging to
the upper parent, and the radicle to the lower one, and the
triple caudex to them all.</P>
<P>A separation of these buds from the parent plant is said to
have been observed by Mr. Blumenback in the conferva fonti∣nalis,
a vegetable which consists of small short slender threads,
which grow in our fountains, and fix their roots in the mud.
He observed by magnifying glasses, that the extremities of the
threads swell, and form small tubera, or heads, which gradual∣ly
separate from the parent threads, attach themselves to the
ground, and become perfect vegetables; the whole progress of
their formation can be observed in forty-eight hours. Observa∣tions
on plants, by Von Uslar, Creech, Edinb.</P>
<P>2. The lateral propagation of the polypus found in our ditches
in July, but more particularly that of the hydra stentorea, is
wonderfully analogous to the above idea of the lateral genera∣tion
of vegetables. The hydra stentorea, according to the ac∣count
of monsieur Trembley, multiplies itself by splitting length-wise;
and in twenty-four hours these divisions, which adhere
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
to a common pedicle, resplit, and form four distinct animals.
These four in an equal time split again, and thus double their
number daily, till they acquire a figure somewhat resembling a
nosegay. The young animals afterwards separate from the
parent, attach themselves to aquatic plants, and give rise to
new colonies.</P>
<P>Another curious animal fact is related by Blumenback in his
treatise on generation, concerning the fresh water polypus. He
cut two of them in half, which were of different colours, and
applying the upper-part of one to the lower part of the other,
by means of a glass tube, and retaining them thus for some time
in contact with each other, the two divided extremities united,
and became one animal.</P>
<P>The attentive reader has already anticipated me in applying
these wonderful modes of lateral animal reproduction and con∣junction
to the lateral propagation and ingraftment of vegetables.
The junction of the head-part of one polypus to the tail-part of
another is exactly represented by the ingraftment of a scion on
the stock of another tree. The plumula, or apex of each bud,
with the upper part of its caudex, joins to the long caudex of
the stock, which passing down the trunk terminates in the ra∣dicles
of it. And if this compound vegetable could be separated
longitudinally from the other long filaments of the bark in its
vicinity, like the fibres of the bark of the mulberry-tree prepared
at Otaheite, or as the bark of hemp and flax are prepared in
this country, as the young ones of the hydra stentorea separate
from their parents, it might claim the name of a lateral or pa∣ternal
mule, as above mentioned.</P>
<P>3. It hence appears, that every new bud of a tree, where two
scions have been inserted over each other on a stock, if it could
be separated from the plume to the radicle, must consist of three
different kinds of caudex, and might therefore be called a triple
lateral mule. And that hence it follows, that every part of
this new triple caudex, must have been separated or secreted
laterally from the adjoining part of the trunk of the tree; and
that it could not be formed, as I formerly believed, from the
roots of the plume of the bud descending from the upper part
of the caudex of it to the earth. A circumstance of great im∣portance
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>
in the investigation of the curious subject of the lateral
generation of vegetables, and of insects.</P>
<P>One might hence suspect, that if Blumenback had attended
to the propagation of the polypus, which he had composed of
two half polypi, that the young progeny might have possessed
two colours resembling the compound parent, like the different
caudexes of ingrafted trees; an experiment well worthy repeat∣ed
observation.</P>
<P>4. Another animal fact ought also to be here mentioned, that
many insects, as common earth-worms as well as the polypus,
are said to possess so much life throughout a great part of their
system, that they may be cut into two or more pieces without
destroying them, as each piece will acquire a new head, or a
new tail, or both; and the insect will thus become multiplied.
How exactly this is resembled by the long caudex of the buds
of trees, which possess such vegetable life from one extremity
to the other, that when the head or plume is lopped of, it can
produce a new plume; and when the lower part is cut off, it
can produce new radicles; and may be thus wonderfully mul∣tiplied.</P>
<P>5. Hence we acquire some new and important ideas concern∣ing
the lateral generation of vegetables, and which may pro∣bably
contribute to elucidate their sexual generation. These
are, first, that the parts of the long caudex of each new bud
of an ingrafted tree, and consequently of all trees, are separated
or secreted from the correspondent or adjoining parts of the
long caudex of the last year's bud, which was its parent; and
not that it consists of the roots of each new bud shot down from
the plumula or apex of it, as I formerly supposed; and that
those various molecules, or fibrils, secreted from the caudex of
the last year's buds, adjoin and grow together beneath the cu∣ticle
of the trunk of the tree, the upper ones forming the plumula
of the new bud, which is its leaf or lungs, to acquire oxygen
from the atmosphere; and the lower ones forming the radicles
of it, which are absorbent vessels to acquire nutriment from the
earth.</P>
<P>Secondly, that every part of the caudex of an ingrafted tree,
and consequently of all trees, can generate or produce a new
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
bud, when the upper part of it is strangulated with a wire or
cut off, or otherwise when it is supplied more abundantly with
nutriment, ventilation, and light. And that each of these new
buds thus produced resembles that part of the stock in compound
trees, where it arises. Thus in the triple tree above mentioned
a bud from the upper part of the long caudexes, which form
the filaments of the bark, would become a golden pippin branch;
a bud from the middle part of them would become a nonpareil
branch; and a bud from the lower part a crab branch.</P>
<P>Thirdly, another wonderful property of this lateral mule
progeny of trees compounded by ingraftment consists in this,
that the new mule may consist of parts from three, or
four, or many parents, when so many different scions are ingrafted on
each other; whence a question may arise, whether a mixture
of two kinds of anther-dust previous to its application to the
stigma of flowers might not produce a threefold mule, partaking
of the likeness of both the males?</P>
<P>6. On this nice subject of reproduction so far removed from
common apprehension the patient reader will excuse a more pro∣lix
investigation. The attraction of all matter to the centres of
the planets, or of the sun, is termed gravitation; that of par∣ticular
bodies to each others it generally called chemical affinity;
to which the attractions belonging to electricity and magnetism
appear to be allied.</P>
<P>In these latter kinds of attraction two circumstances seem to
be required; first, the power to attract possessed by one of the
bodies, and secondly, the aptitude to be attracted possessed by
the other. Thus when a magnet attracts iron, it may be said
to possess a specific tendency to unite with the iron; and the
iron may be said to possess a specific aptitude to be united with
the magnet. The former appears to reside in the magnet, be∣cause
it can be deprived of its attractive power, which can also
be restored to it; and the iron appears to possess a specific ap∣titude
to be united with the magnet, because no other metal will
approach it. In the same manner a rubbed stick of sealing-wax
may be said to possess a specific tendency to unite with a light
straw, but not with a glass bead. Here the straw seems to
possess a specific aptitude to unite with the rubbed sealing-wax,
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
because many other bodies refuse to do so, as glass, silk, air;
and lastly, the specific attraction of the rubbed sealing-wax can
be withdrawn or restored; to which may be added, that some
chemical combinations may arise from the single attraction of
one body, and the aptitude to be attracted of another; or they
may be owing to reciprocal attractions of the two bodies, as in
what is termed by the chemists double affinity, which is known
to be so powerful as to separate those bodies, which are held
together by the single attraction probably of one of them to
the other, which other possesses only an aptitude to be at∣tracted
by the former.</P>
<P>7. The above account of the tendencies to union by unorga∣nized
or inanimate matter is not given as a philosophical ana∣logy,
but to facilitate our conception of the adjunctions or con∣cretions
observable in organized or animated bodies, which con∣stitute
their formation, their nutrition, and their growth. These
may be divided into two kinds; first the junction or union of
animated bodies with inanimate matter, as when fruit or flesh
is swallowed into the stomach, and becomes absorbed by the
lacteals; and the second, where living particles coalesce or
concrete together, as in the formation, nutrition, or conjunc∣tion
of the parts of living animals.</P>
<P>In respect to the former, the animal parts, as the nostrils
and palate, possess an appetency, when stimulated by the scent
and flavour of agreeable food, to unite themselves with it; and
the inanimate material possesses an aptitude to be thus united
with the animal organ. The same occurs when the food is
swallowed into the stomach; the mouths of the lacteal vessels
being agreeably stimulated possess an appetency to absorb the
particles of the digesting mass, which is in a situation of under∣going
chemical changes, and possesses at some period of them
an aptitude to be united with the mouths of the absorbent lac∣teals.</P>
<P>But when these absorbed particles of inanimate matter have
been circulated in the blood, they seem gradually to obtain a
kind of vitality; whence Mr. John Hunter, and I believe some
ancient philosophers, and the divine Moses, asserted, that the
blood is alive; that is, that it possesses some degree of organi∣zation,
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
or other properties different from those of inanimate
matter, which are not producible by any chemical process, and
which cease to exist along with the life of the animal. Hence
for the purpose of nutrition there is reason to suspect, that two
circumstances are necessary, both dependent upon life, and con∣sequent
activity; these are first an appetency of the fibrils of
the fixed organization, which wants nutrition; and secondly,
a propensity of the fluid molecules existing in the blood,
or secreted from it, to unite with the organ now stimulated into
action. So that nutrition may be said to be affected by the
embrace or cohesion of the fibrils, which possess nutritive appe∣tencies
with the molecules, which possess nutritive propensi∣ties.</P>
<P>8. If the philosopher, who thinks on this subject, should not
be inclined to believe that the whole of the blood is alive; he
can not easily deny life to that part of it which is secreted by
the organs of generation, and conveys vitality to the new em∣bryon,
which it produces. Hence though in the prosess of
nutrition the activity of two kinds of fibrils or molecules may be
suspected, yet in the process of the generation of a new vegeta∣ble
or animal, there seems great reason to believe, that both the
combining and combined particles are endued with vitality;
that is, with some degree of organization or other properties not
existing in inanimate matter, which we beg leave to denominate
fibrils with formative appetencies, and molecules with formative
propensities, as the former may seem to possess a greater degree
of organization than the latter.</P>
<P>And thus it appears, that though nutrition may be conceived
to be produced by the animated fibrils of an organized part being
stimulated into action by inanimate molecules, which they then
embrace, and may thus be popularly compared to the simple at∣tractions
of chemistry; yet that in the production of a new
embryon, whether vegetable or animal, both the fibrils with
formative appetencies, and the molecules with formative propen∣sities,
reciprocally stimulate and embrace each other, and in∣stantly
coalesce, and may thus popularly be compared to the
double affinities of chemistry. But there are animal facts,
which resemble both these, and are thence more philosophi∣cally
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>
analogous to them; and these are the two great supports of animated nature, the passions of hunger and of love. In the
former the appetency resides only in the stomach, or perhaps in
the cardia ventriculi, but the object consists of inanimate matter;
in the latter reciprocal appetencies and propensities exist in the
male and female, which mutually excite them to embrace each
other. Two other animal facts are equally analogous; the thirst, which resides at the upper end of the esophagus, and
though it possesses appetency itself, its object is inanimate mat∣ter;
but in lactescent females, when they give suck to their young, there exists a reciprocal appetency in the mother to part
with her milk, and in the young offspring to receive it.</P>
<P>This then finally I conceive to be the manner of the produc∣tion
of the lateral progeny of vegetables. The long caudex of an existing bud of
a tree, which constitutes a single filament of
the present bark, is furnished with glands numerous as the per∣spirative
or mucous glands of animal bodies; and that these are
of two kinds, the one secreting from the vegetable blood the
fibrils with formative appetencies, correspondent to the mascu∣line
secretion of animals; and the other secreting from the vege∣table
blood the molecules with formative propensities, corre∣spondent
to the feminine secretion of animals; and then that
both these kinds of formative particles are deposited beneath the
cuticle of the bark along the whole course of it, and nearly at the same time by the sympathy of the secreting organs, and instantly embrace and coalesce, forming a new caudex along the
side of its parent with vegetable life, and with the additional powers of nutrition, and of growth.</P>
<P>9. This then is the great secret of nature; more living par∣ticles
are produced by the powers of vitality in the fabrication
of the vegetable blood, than are necessary for nutrition or re∣storation
of decomposing organs. These are secreted, and de∣truded
externally, and produce by their combination a new vital
organization beneath the cuticles of trees over the old one.
These new combinations of vital fibrils and molecules acquire
new appetencies, or fabricate molecules with new propensities,
and thus possess the power of forming the leaf or lungs at one
extremity of the new caudex; and the radicles, or absorbent
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>
vessels at the other end; and some of them, as in the central
buds which terminate the branches, finally form the sexual organs of reproduction, which constitute the flower.</P>
<P>That new organizations of the growing system acquire new appetencies appears from the production of the passion for gene∣ration,
as soon as the adapted organs are complete; and from
the desire of lactescent females to suckle their offspring, and also
from the variation of the palate, or desire for particular kinds
of food, as we advance in life, as from milk to flesh. Thus as
a popular allusion, and not as a philosophical analogy, we may
again be allowed to apply to the combinations of chemistry;
where two different kinds of particles unite, as acids and alka∣lies,
a third something is produced, which possesses attractions
dissimilar to those of either of them; and that new organizations
form new molecules appears from the secretions of the seminal
and uterine glands, when they have acquired their maturity;
and from the breasts of lactescent females.</P>
<P>10. In the lateral propagation of vegetable buds as the super∣fluous
fibrils or molecules, which were fabricated in the blood,
or detached from living organs, and possess nutritive or forma∣tive
appetencies and propensities, and which were more abund∣ant
than were required for the nutrition of the parent vegetable
bud, when it had obtained its full growth, were secreted by in∣numerable
glands on the various parts of its surface beneath the
general cuticle of the tree, and there embracing and coalescing,
form a new embryon caudex, which gradually produces a new
plumula and radicles. And as the different parts of the new
caudex of a compound tree resemble the parts of the parent cau∣dex,
to which it adheres, it was shewn, beyond all doubt, that
different fibrils or molecules were detached from different parts
of the parent caudex to form the filial one.</P>
<P>So in the sexual propagation of vegetables the superfluous liv∣ing
fibrils, or molecules, floating in the blood, appear to be
secreted from it by two kinds of glands only; those which con∣stitute
the anthers, and those which constitute the pericarp of
flowers. By the former I suppose the fibrils, with formative
appetencies and with nutritive appetencies, to be secreted; and
by the latter the molecules, with formative and with nutritive
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>
propensities. Afterwards that these fibrils with formative and
nutritive appetencies, become mixed in the pericarp or uterus
of the flower, with the correspondent molecules with formative and nutritive propensities; and that a new embryon is instantly
produced by their reciprocal embrace and coalescence. And
that parts of this new organization afterwards acquire new ap∣petencies,
and form molecules with new propensities, and thus
gradually produce other parts of the growing seed, which do not
at first appear, as the plumula, radicles, cuticle, and the glands
of reproduction in the pericarp and anthers, which correspond
in the animal fetus to the lungs, intestines, cuticle, and the
organs, which distinguish the sexes.</P>
<P>11. From this new doctrine of a threefold vegetable mule by
lateral propagation, as the new bud on the summit of a tree,
which has had two scions ingrafted on it one above another, in
which it is incontestibly shewn, that different fibrils, or mole¦cules,
are detached from different parts of the parent cau∣dex
to form the filial one, which adheres to it; and that it then
acquires the power of producing new radicles, or a new plu∣mula;
we may safely conclude, as it is deducible from the
strongest analogy, that in the production of sexual mules, whe∣ther
vegetable or animal, some parts of the new embryon were
produced by, or detached from, similar parts of the parent,
which they resemble. And that as these fibrils, or molecules,
floated in the circulating blood of their parents, they were col∣lected
separately by appropriated glands of the male or female;
and that finally, on their mixture in the matrix the new em∣bryon
was immediately generated, resembling in some parts the
form of the father, and in other parts the form of the mother,
according to the quantity or activity of the fibrils or molecules
at the time of their conjunction.</P>
<P>And lastly, that various parts of the new organizations after∣wards
acquired new appetencies, and formed molecules with
new propensities, and thus gradually produced other parts of the
growing fetus, as the skin, nails, hair, and the organs which distinguish the sexes.</P>
<P>If the molecules secreted by the female organ into the pericarp
of flowers, or into the ovary of animals, were supposed to con∣sist
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
of only unorganized or inanimate particles; and the fibrils
secreted by the male organ only to possess formative appetencies
to select and combine with them; the new embryon must pro∣bably
hare always resembled the father, and no mules could
have had existence.</P>
<P>But by the theory above delivered it appears, that the new
offspring, both in vegetable and animal reproduction, whether
it be a mule or not, must sometimes more resemble the male
parent, and sometimes the female one, and sometimes appear to
be a combination of them both, as the epigram of Martial:
<Q><L>Dum dubitat natura gravis puerum faceretne puellam.</L>
<L>Factus es, O pulcher, pene puella, puer.</L></Q></P>
<P>12. The certain proof above given, that some parts of the
triple caudex of the new bud of a tree, which has been com∣pounded
by ingraftment, are formed from similar parts of the
triple caudex of the parent bud, carries us one step further back
into the mysterious process of reproduction, and somewhat coun∣tenances
the ingenious conjectures of monsieur Buffon. And
the analogy here observed, that as in chemical union there must
be some particles of inanimate matter with attractions, and others
with aptitudes to be attracted; so in the conjunctions of animat∣ed
particles in the nutrition or formation of organized beings,
there must exist fibrils or molecules with formative or nutritive
appetencies, and others with formative or nutritive aptitudes or
propensities, one of which may be secreted by the male, and the
other by the female parent, may facilitate our reasoning upon
this dark subject, which will be resumed and enlarged upon in
the next edition of Zoonomia, in the section on generation.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">I. THE MUSCLES, NERVES, AND BRAIN OF VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<Q>1. Vegetable muscles evinced by their closing their corols, and calyxes,
and moving their leaves in consequence of stimulus. Hence also
vegetable nerves both of sense and motion. When one part of a
leaf of mimosa is touched the whole leaf falls. Hence also a ve∣getable
brain or common sensorium. 2. Their irritability shewn
by the absorption, and circulation of their fluids. By electric
shocks. By the ascent of sap-juice. 3. Their sensibility shewn
by the collaps of mimosa. By closing their petals from defect of
stimulus, as in darkness and cold. By the males and females
bending to each other. 4. Their volition shewn from hedysarum
gyrans. From polymorpha marchantia. From tendrils of vines.
From their sleep. 5. Their associations of motion shewn by their
closing their petals, performing absorption and circulation of fluids.
Their acquired habits. Grains and roots from the south vege∣tate
sooner. Apple-trees. Sensitive plant. Barberry. 6. Ve∣getables
possess a sense of heat, of light, and of moisture, and
consequently possess a brain or common sensorium. 7. They possess
a sense of touch and a common sensorium. 8. How do the anthers
and stigmas find each other? by a sense of smell. Adultery of
collinsonia. 9. From their absorptions, secretions, senses, love and
sleep, they must possess a brain. Does this reside in the pith of
each individual bud?</Q>
<P>1. THE various motions of peculiar parts of vegetables evince
the existence of muscles and nerves in those parts, such as the
closing of their petals, and calyxes, at the approach of night, or
in cold or wet weather; though the fibres and nerves, which
constitute these muscles, are too fine for anatomical demon∣stration.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="126"/>
Some vegetables fold the older leaves over the new buds at the extremity of their stalks during the night, as alsine, chick-weed;
others, as the mimosa, sensitive plant, fold the upper or
polished sides of their leaves together during their sleep. The
hedysarum gyrans whirls its leaves in various directions, when
the air is still, by an apparently voluntary effort, probably for the
purpose of respiration. The dionoea muscipula, Venus's fly-trap,
closes its leaves from the stimulus of insects, which crawl upon
them, and pierces them with its prickles. And the apocynum
androsemifolium contracts its petals or nectaries round the pro∣boscis
of the flies, which stimulate it, and holds them till they
die, or till the sleep of the plant releases them by the relaxation
of its muscular action.</P>
<P>From these circumstances it appears, that there are not only
muscles about the moving foot-stalks or claws of the leaves and
petals above mentioned; but that these muscles must be endued
with nerves of sense as well as of motion. Now, as when one part
of a leaf of mimosa is touched, the whole leaf falls, it follows,
that there must be a common sensorium, or brain, where the
nerves communicate, belonging to this one leaf-bud. To evince
this further another leaf-let was slit with sharp scissars, and some
seconds of time elapsed, before the plant seemed sensible of the
injury; and then the whole plant collapsed as far as the principal
stem. Afterwards a small drop of oil of vitriol was put on
the
bud in the bosom of a leaf of another sensitive plant; and, after
about half a minute, when the brain of this bud could be sup∣posed
to be destroyed, the whole leaf fell, and rose no more.
If the individual buds of plants possess muscles and nerves with a
brain, or common sensorium; the following questions conse∣quently
occur, and should be answered in the affirmative. Have
vegetable buds irritability? have they sensation? have they voli∣tion?
Have they associations of motions? I am persuaded they
possess them all, though in a much inferior degree even than the
cold blooded animals.</P>
<P>2. The irritability of vegetable fibres is demonstrated by the
absorption and circulation of their fluids in their roots, leaves, and
petals; which can not be explained by any mechanic law, and
exactly corresponds with the absorption of the aliment, and the
circulation of the blood in animals; which Physiologists have
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
demonstrated to depend on the muscular motions of the vessels
themselves, which possess irritability, and are excited into action
by the stimulus of the fluids, which they acquire or contain.</P>
<P>The irritability of vegetable vessels is shewn by a curious ex∣periment
of Von Uslar, who passed strong electric shocks through
a plant of euphorbia, so as to destroy the life of the plant; and
he then observed on cutting off a branch, that it did not bleed;
though a similar branch cut off before the death of the plant ef∣fused
much milky juice; whence he justly concludes, that the
electric percussion had destroyed the irritability of the plant.</P>
<P>Mr. Cavallo asserts in his Treatise on Electricity, that he
found by repeated experiments, that the plant balsam (impatiens)
was destroyed by less quantities of electricity than any other ve∣getables,
which he subjected to it; and that on examining the
plant afterwards no injury on the external or internal parts of it
could be discovered; whence it may be concluded that the irri∣tability
simply, and not the organization of the plant, was de∣stroyed
by the unnatural quantity of stimulus. He adds, that
not only shocks from so small a coated surface as six or eight
square inches, but even strong sparks from a large conductor
destroyed these plants, which sometimes recovered in a day or
two, but not frequently. See Sect. XIII. 3. and Sect. XIV. 2.
3. of this work.</P>
<P>The ascent of the sap-juice during the vernal months in the
experiments both of Hales and Walker, being retarded or quite
stopped during the cold parts of the day, and in the night; and
on the north side of the tree in cool days, when it continued to
flow on the south side, can only be ascribed to the irritability of
the vegetable vessels being decreased by the deficient stimulus of
heat. See this subject further treated of in Sect. XIV. 1. 10. of
this work.</P>
<P>3. The sensibility of fibres is distinguished from their irritability
by the pain or pleasure, which precedes or attends any animal ac∣tion;
and therefore supposes the existence of a common senso∣rium;
now when one division of a leaf of mimosa is injured by a
wound or touch, in a short time the whole leaf closes, which is
owing to the actions of the distant muscles about the footstalks
of the subdivisions of the leaf. Does not this prove, that there
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
is a brain or common sensorium, where the nerves communicate in some part of this bud or leaf, as the injury of one distant part
of it thus affects the whole? or in other words, that the disagree∣able
sensation is propagated from a part to the whole, and causes
the actions of some distant muscles, in the same manner as I
draw away my hand when my finger is hurt?</P>
<P>There are muscles placed about the foot-stalks of the leaves or
leaflets of many plants, for the purpose of closing their upper
surfaces together, or of bending them down so as to shoot off
the showers or dew-drops, as in sensitive plant, mimosa; kidney-bean,
phaseolus; and many trees. The claws of the petals, or
of the divisions of the calyx of many flowers, are furnished in
a similar manner with muscles, which are exerted to open or close
the corol and calyx of the flower, as in tragopogon, anemone.
This action of opening and closing the leaves or flowers do
not appear to be produced simply by irritation on the muscles
themselves, but by the connexion of those muscles with a sen∣sitive
sensorium, or brain, existing in each individual bud or
flower, 1st. Because many flowers close from defect of stimulus,
not by the excess of it, as by darkness, which is the absence of
the stimulus of light; or by cold, which is the absence of the
stimulus of heat. Now the defect of heat, like the absence of
food, or of drink, affects our senses with pain, which had been
previously accustomed to a greater quantity of them, and a cu∣taneous
shivering may be excited in consequence of the pain; but
a muscle cannot be said to be stimulated into action by a defect of
stimulus though some modern writers on medicine have called
cold a stimulus to animal fibres, which it always renders torpid or
inactive; a theory derived from Galen, and which must have
originated in his total ignorance of chemistry and natural philo∣sophy.</P>
<P>In some flowers the males bend into contact with the females,
as in cistus, kalmia, fritillaria persica, lithrum salicaria; in others
the female bends to the males, as in collinsonia, gloriosa,
genista,
epilobium; which shews a sensibility to the passion of reproduc∣tion.
In <HI>irritation</HI> the stimulated muscles only are brought into
action, without being perceived by the other parts of the system;
but in <HI>sensation</HI> the whole system is affected by means of the brain
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
or common sensorium, and thence very distant muscles are brought
into action to acquire an agreeable object, or to repel or with∣draw
from a disagreeable one. See Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect.
XIII. 2.</P>
<P>4. That plants possess in some degree the power of volition
would appear first from the hedysarum gyrans, which moves its
leaves in circular directions when the air is too still. Secondly,
from the marchantia polymorpha, in which some yellow wool
advances from the flower bearing anthers, while it drops its dust
like atoms. Murray's System of Vegetables. Thirdly, from
the tendrils of vines, and the stems of other climbing vegetables,
which continue to move round, till they find something to ad∣here
to, or till they have rolled themselves up in a spiral line like
a cork screw. And lastly, from the efforts of almost all plants
to turn the upper surface of their leaves, or their flowers, to the light.</P>
<P>But there is an indubitable proof of plants possessing some de∣gree
of voluntarity, and that is deduced from their sleep. In
animal bodies sleep consists in a suspension or temporary abolition
of voluntary power; the organs of sense being at the same time
closed, or by some other means rendered unfit for the perception
of external bodies. Now the sleep of plants is proved by the
hanging down or closing of the leaves of many plants, and of
shutting the petals and calyxes of many flowers in the dark, and
their again opening or expanding them in the light, or at certain
hours of the day.</P>
<P>5. In respect to vegetables acquiring associations of motion, or
habits of action, the former is seen in the absorptions and circula∣tions
of their fluids, and in the various movements above de∣scribed;
which whirl their leaves or tendrils, and close or open
their corols and calyxes, which could not be performed without
the synchronous and associated actions of many muscles; as in
the absorptions and circulations of animal bodies, and the move∣ments
of their limbs.</P>
<P>Other acquired habits of vegetable actions appear from the
grains and roots brought from more southern latitudes, which
germinate here sooner than those which are brought from more
northern ones, owing to their acquired habits. Fordyce on
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>
Agriculture. And from the apple trees sent from hence to
New York, which blossomed for a few years too early for the
climate, and bore no fruit; but afterwards learnt to accommodate
themselves to their new situation. Travels in New York by
Professor Kalm.</P>
<P>The divisions of the leaves of the sensitive plant have been
accustomed to contract at the same time from the absence of
light; hence if by any other circumstance, as a slight stroke or
injury, one division is irritated into contraction; the neighbour∣ing
ones contract also, from their motions being associated with
those of the irritated part. So the various stamina of the bar∣berry
have been accustomed to contract together in the evening;
and thence, if you stimulate one of them with a pin, according
to the experiment of Dr. Smith, they all contract from their acquired associations.</P>
<P>6. This leads us to a curious inquiry whether vegetables pos∣sess
any organs of sense? Certain it is, that they possess a sense of
heat and cold, another of moisture and dryness, and another
of light and darkness; for they close their petals occasionally
from the presence of cold, moisture, or darkness. And it has
been already shewn, that these actions cannot be performed sim∣ply
from irritation, because cold and darkness are defective quan∣tities
of our usual stimuli; and that on that account sensation or
volition are employed; and in consequence a sensorium or union
of the nerves must exist. So when we go into the light, we
contract the iris, not from any stimulus of the light on the fine
muscles of the iris, but from its motions being associated with the
sensation of too much light on the retina, which could not take
place without a sensorium or center of union of the nerves of the
iris with those of vision.</P>
<P>7. Besides these organs of sense, which distinguish cold, mois∣ture,
and darkness, the leaves of mimosa, and of dionaea, and
of drosera, and the stamens of many flowers, as of the barberry,
and of the numerous class of syngenesia, are sensible to mechanic
impact; that is, they possess a sense of touch; and as many of
their distant muscles are in consequence excited into action,
this also evinces, that they possess a common sensorium, by
which this sensation is communicated to the whole, and volition
occasionally exerted.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="131"/>
8. Lastly, in many flowers the anthers when mature approach
the stigma, in others the female organ approaches to the male. I
ask, by what means are the anthers in many flowers, and stigmas
in other flowers, directed to find their paramours? Is this cu∣rious
kind of storge produced by mechanic attraction, or by the
sensation of love? The latter opinion is supported by the
strongest analogy, because a reproduction of the species is the con∣sequence;
and then another organ of sense must be wanted to di∣rect
these vegetable amourettes to find each other; one probably
analogous to our sense of smell which in the animal world di∣rects
the new-born infant to its source of nourishment; and in
some animals directs the male to the female; and they may
thus possess a faculty of perceiving as well as of producing
odours.</P>
<P>A most curious example of the existence of some kind of
sense which may direct the pistils, or female parts of the flowers
of collinsonia, which way to bend for the purpose of finding the
mature males is related in Botanic Garden, Vol. I. Canto IV.
l. 460, where some of the pistils mistake the males, or stamens,
of the neighbouring flowers for their own husbands; and bend∣ing
into contact with them become guilty of adultery. See Sect.
VII. 2. 2. of this work.</P>
<P>9. Thus, besides a kind of taste or appetency at the extremi∣ties
of their roots, similar to that of the extremities of our lac∣teal
vessels, for the purpose of selecting their proper food; and
besides different kinds of irritability or appetency residing in the
various glands, which separate honey, wax, resin, and other
juices from their blood; vegetable life seems to possess an organ
of sense to distinguish the variations of heat, another to distin∣guish
the varying degrees of moisture, another of light, another
of touch, and probably another analogous to our sense of smell.
To these must be added the indubitable evidence of their passion
of love, and of their necessity to sleep; and I think we may truly
conclude, that they are furnished with a brain or common senso∣rium
belonging to each bud.</P>
<P>But whether this brain, or common sensorium, resides in the
medulla, or pith, which occupies the central parts of every bud
and leaf, like the spinal marrow of animals, has not yet been
<PB N="126" REF="132"/>
certainly determined. By this medulla is meant only the pith of
each individual bud, not that which is seen in the center of a
tree, which like the wood which surrounds it, has long ceased to
have vegetable life.</P>
<P>The pith, or medulla of each bud, is supposed by its elasticity
to push out the central part of the bud; as the vesicular produc∣tions
on the inside of young quills are supposed to push forwards
their early growth, and in some birds are said by Mr. Hunter to
receive air from the lungs. It is more probable that this pith, or
medulla oblongata of plants, supplies the spirit of vegetation,
since it exists in all buds in their most early state, and does not
communicate from one bud to another, and thus distinguish them
from each other, and evinces their individuality. See Sect. I.

<P>I. 1. HAVING treated of the physiology, we now step for∣wards
to consider the economy of vegetation, as far as it may
serve the purposes of agriculture and gardening.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="135"/>
After the production of the seed, or vegetable egg in the pe∣ricarp
of flowers, and its ensuing impregnation by the farina of
the anthers shed upon the stigma, a coagulated point appears
on the seed-lobes according to the observations of Spallanzani,
like the cicatricula on the yolk of the egg.</P>
<P>The seed continues to grow in the pericarp sustained by
adapted secretions from the vegetable blood, which is previously
oxygenated in the bractes or floral leaves of many plants; in
others the seed is itself inclosed in an air-vessel probably for that
purpose, as in staphylea, bladder-nut, and tagetes, African mary-gold.
At the same time a reservoir of nutriment is secreted,
and deposited in the seed-lobes or cotyledons, which are single
ones in the seeds of palms, grasses, and lilies; though twofold
in those of most other herbs and trees; whence the strictest ana∣logy
exists between seeds and eggs.</P>
<P>2. In some seeds, when they leave the vegetable uterus, this
embryon is much more mature than in others. In the seeds
of
the nymphaea nelumbo the leaves of the future plant were seen
so distinctly by Mr. Ferber, that he found out by them to what
plant the seeds belonged. The same in the seeds of the tulip-tree,
liriodendron tulipiferum. Amaen. Acad. V. VI. No. 120.
And Mr. Baker asserts, that on dissecting a seed of trembling
grass, he discovered by the microscope a perfect plant with roots
sending forth two branches, from each of which several leaves
or blades of grass proceeded. Microsc. Vol. I. p. 252. While
in other seeds the corculum, or heart only of the seed, is dis∣tinctly
visible, as in the kernel of the walnut, and the seed of
the garden-bean. So in the animal kingdom the young of some
birds are much more mature at their birth than those of others.
The chickens of pheasants, quails, and partridges, can use their
eyes, run after their mothers, and peck their food, almost as
soon as they leave their shell; but those of the linnet, thrush,
and blackbird, continue many days totally blind, and can only
open their callow mouths for the offered morsel.</P>
<P>3. When the seed falls naturally upon the earth, or is buried
artificially in shallow trenches beneath the soil, the first three
things necessary to its growth are heat, water, and air. Heat
is the general cause of fluidity, without which no motion can
<PB N="130" REF="136"/>
exist; water is the menstruum, in which the nutriment of vege∣table
and animal bodies is conveyed to their various organs; and
the oxygen of the atmosphere is believed to afford the principle
of excitability so perpetually necessary to all organic life; and
which renders the living fibres both of the vegetable and animal
world obedient to the stimuli, which are naturally applied to
them.</P>
<P>Whence we may in some measure comprehend a difficult
question; why the plume of a seed sowed upon, or in the earth,
should ascend, and the root descend, which has been ascribed to
a mysterious instinct; the plumula is stimulated by the air into
action, and elongates itself, where it is thus most excited; and
the radicle is stimulated by moisture, and elongates itself thus,
where it is most excited, whence one of them grows upwards
in quest of its adapted object, and the other downward.</P>
<P>The first source of nutriment supplied to the seminal embryon,
after it falls from the parent plant, exists in the seed-lobes, or
cotyledons, which either remain beneath the earth, and are
permeated by the umbilical vessels of the embryon plant, which
absorb the mucilaginous, farinaceous, or oily matter deposited
in them, as in the bean, pisum; or the seed-lobes rise up into
the air along with the young plant, as in the kidney-bean, pha∣seolus,
become seed-leaves, and serve both as a nutritive and
respiratory organ. These cotyledons or seed-lobes generally
contain mucilage, as in quince-seed; or starch, as in wheat;
or oil, as in line-seed. Some of these nutritive materials are
probably absorbed unchanged, or dissolved only by the moisture
of the earth; others are converted into sugar partly by a che∣mical
process, and partly by the digestive powers of the young
plant, as appears in the process of germinating barley, and con∣verting
it into malt; these reservoirs of nutriment are hence per∣fectly
analogous to the white of the egg, a part of which is pro∣bably
absorbed unchanged by the lymphatics of the young em∣bryon,
and a part of it converted into a sweet chyle for the
nourishment of the chick, when it has acquired a stomach.</P>
<P>If the seed be deprived of these cotyledons, soon after the
root appears, it will continue to grow, but with less vigour, and
is said to produce a dwarf plant from three to nine times less than
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
the parent. Hence the seeds of plants, which are liable to pro∣duce
too vigorous roots, and thence have not time to ripen their
fruits in the short summers of this climate, or which fill our hot-beds
with too luxuriant foilage, as melons, and cucumbers,
should in this climate be kept three or four years; by which
part of the mucilaginous, or farinaceous, or oily matter of the
cotyledons becomes injured or decayed, and the new plant grows
less luxuriantly.</P>
<P>Another source of nutriment for the seminal embryon of
many plants exists in the fruit, which envelopes the stone or
seed-vessel, after the growing fetus has burst its confinement,
and so far resembles the yolk of the egg, which becomes a nu∣triment
so the chick, after it has consumed the white, and elop∣ed
from its shell.</P>
<P>When mature fruit, as an apple or a cucumber, falls upon
the ground, it supplies, as it ripens or decays, a second source
of nourishment, which enables the inclosed seeds to shoot their
roots into the earth, and to elevate their stems with greater
vigour. Hence fruits generally contain a saccharine matter, or
juices capable of being converted into sugar, either by a spon∣taneous
chemical process, as in baking four apples; or by a
vegetable process, as in those sour pears, which continue to ripen
for many months, both before and after they are plucked from
the tree, as long as life remains in them; that is, till they fer∣ment
or putrify; and lastly, by the digestive power of the
young embryon, as above mentioned.</P>
<P>If the seed be deprived of the fruit, it will indeed vegetate,
but with less vigour. Hence those seeds which are liable to
produce too vigorous shoots for this climate, as the seeds of
melons and cucumbers, should be washed clean from their pulp,
before they are hoarded, and preserved three or four years be∣fore
they are sown in hot-beds. But those seeds, which are
sown late in the season for the purpose of producing winter fod∣der,
as the seeds of turneps, should be collected and preserved
with every possible advantage; and on this account new seed is
much to be preferred to that which has been long kept.</P>
<P>4. Many seeds when mature are dispersed far from the parent
tree, for the purpose of their growth, by various contrivances,
<PB N="132" REF="138"/>
as mentioned in Sect. VII. 2. 5. Some of these are surround∣ed
with hard shells, which are impenetrable by insects, as they
lie on the earth to take root, as peaches, nectarines, nuts, cocoa∣nuts.
Other seeds are furnished with an acrid covering to pre∣vent
the depredation of insects, as the peel of oranges and le∣mons,
the outward husk and inward rind of walnuts, and of
cashew-nuts, and the skin of mustard-seed, and rape-seed; other
seeds for the same purpose abound with bitter or narcotic juices,
as the horse-chesnut, acorn, apricot, cherry, many of which
supply materials to the shops of medicine, and may supply nutri∣ment
in times of scarcity; as the starch, which they contain,
may be procured by grating them into cold-water, and washing
away the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucilage, and the poisonous material, which adheres
to it, or which is soluble in water.</P>
<P>5. The plumula of the seed, or embryon plant, absorbs the
nutriment laid up for it in the seed-lobes by vessels, which per∣meate
them for that purpose, and have been termed umbilical
vessels; and afterwards shoots its roots down into the fruit, or
into the earth, in search of other nourishment; and expands its
leaves in the air as an organ of respiration.</P>
<P>Those plants, which are usually termed annuals, produce
their flowers and die in the same year in which their seeds are
sown; as barley, oats, and a variety of garden flowers. These
nevertheless in accurate language should be termed biennials,
because the seed in this climate is produced in one summer; and
the embryon plant becomes mature in the next; as the seed is
generally preserved in our granaries, or seed-boxes, and not
committed to the ground till the ensuing spring; for many of
these vegetables are not natives of this climate, and would perish
if the seeds were sown in autumn, when it is naturally scattered
on the earth.</P>
<P>Those which are usually termed biennial plants, differ from
the former, first in the time of sowing the seed, which is gene∣rally
in the early autumn, as soon as it is ripe, as of turneps,
carrots, wheat; and thus these produce their flowers in the se∣cond
year after the seed is sown, which has given them the
name of biennials. Many of these plants, perhaps all of them,
lay up a reservoir of nutritious matter during the summer or au∣tumn
<PB N="133" REF="139"/>
in their roots. This nutriment is secreted from the vege∣table
blood, which is previously oxygenated for that purpose in
the large leaves, which generally surround the caudex of the
plant, as in turneps and carrots. These leaves survive the winter
in many plants, which the more succulent stems probably would
not; and the nutriment deposited in the root is expended in the
growth of the stem and the production of seed in the ensuing
spring. As in these vegetables one of our summers is too short
for their growth from the seed to the fructification; and it is for
this reservoir of nutriment that these plants are generally culti∣vated.</P>
<P>But those plants, which are termed perennial, when first rais∣ed
from seed, are many of them some years before they produce
flowers. Some of them form bulbous roots, as the tulip, hya∣cinth,
onion, which are three or four years before they flower,
during which time I believe all the bulbs die annually, producing
one larger than that of the preceding year, and perhaps some
smaller ones, all which annually increase in size till they flower.
The same occurs in potatoe-roots raised from seed, which do
not flower as I am informed till the third year, and then only
those which seemed of stronger or forwarder growth.</P>
<P>Other perennial plants have palmated or branching roots; in
some of these, as in seedling apple-trees, the flower is said not
to appear till ten or twelve years after the seed is sown; the
buds nevertheless annually dying and producing other buds over
them, perhaps more perfect ones, as they acquire after a few
years the power of producing sexual organs, and in consequence
a seminal progeny. In these perennial herbaceous plants and
trees a magazine of nutriment is provided in their roots or sap∣wood,
to supply the new buds, which are to grow in the ensuing spring.</P>
<P>Whence it appears, that all the vegetables of this climate may
be termed biennial plants; as the seeds of some, and the buds or
bulbs of others, are produced in one summer, and flourish and
die in the next; those which are called annuals or biennials
leaving behind them a future progeny of seeds only; those,
which are termed perennial herbaceous plants, leaving behind
them the first year or two a progeny of bulbs or root-buds only,
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>
and afterwards a progeny of seeds also; while the perennial
arborescent vegetables leave behind them a progeny of buds
only for several successive years, and afterwards a progeny of
both buds and seeds.</P>
<P>Thus the bulb from a tulip-seed produces a more perfect bulb
annually, till it flowers, I believe, on the fifth year. It then
produces a flower, and also one perfect bulb, which flowers the
next year; and some other less perfect bulbs, which are suc∣ceeded
by more perfect ones annually, till they also flower.
Whence I conclude, that no tulip bulb flowers till the fourth
or fifth generation.</P>
<P>It is probable, that a similar circumstance occurs in other
vegetables, as in apple-trees; and that the buds of these do not
produce sexual organs, and a consequent feminal progeny, till
the twelfth or fourteenth generation of the bud from the seed;
each of those buds nevertheless producing one principal bud an∣nually
more perfect than itself, and many lateral buds less per∣fect
than itself; that is, at a greater distance from that state of
maturity which enables it to form a flower. This art of distin∣guishing
the greater or less maturity of buds is a matter of great
importance in the management of fruit-trees, as in many of them
the central bud becomes a spur one year, and flowers the next;
and the lateral buds one or two years afterwards, as will be
mentioned in Sect. XV. on the production of fruit.</P>
<P>6. In wheat there exists about the caudex a reservoir of nu∣tritious
juices deposited in the autumn for the purpose of raising
the stem in the ensuing spring like that of turneps and carrots;
but which is attended with other circumstances peculiar I sup∣pose
to the grasses, and other plants, which possess only one
cotyledon or seed-lobe. The early leaf, which surrounds the
first joint of the stem, withers, as the spring advances; in which
joint it had previously deposited a saccharine juice, and proba∣bly
some new embryon buds were at the same time generated
in the caudex; for through this withered leaf, which surrounds
the first joint of the stem within the earth, a circular set of new
stems issue adhering to it, and a circle of roots below them
adhering to the caudex or base of it. These new buds rise into
air, and shoot their roots into the earth; and in this manner
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
many stems are produced in the spring from one seed sowed in
the autumn preceding; though in some kinds of wheat the
whole process of the seed rising from earth, and producing other
stems round the principle one, and of ripening its seeds, may be
performed in one summer even in this northern climate.</P>
<P>Another peculiarity attends the growth of wheat and other
grasses; the leaf, which surrounds and strengthens the stem by
its foot-stalk, deposits at every lower joint a saccharine matter
for the purpose of nourishing the ascending part of the young
stem; and in the uppermost joint, I suppose, to serve instead
of honey for the stamens and stigmas, as their flowers have no
visible nectary; and as the scales of the flower may with good
reason be esteemed a calyx rather than a corol, according to the
opinion of Mr. Milne; as these scales attend the seed-vessel to
its maturity, which die corol does not. Milne's Botanical
Dict. Art. Gramina.</P>
<P>Owing to this secretion of saccharine matter at the foot-stalk
of every leaf, and its collection round the joints of grasses, it
happens that when these joints are surrounded with moist earth,
and are placed but a certain depth from the air, that new buds
will put forth round these joints, and strike their roots into the
soil. Whence the agrarian husbandman may derive great ad∣vantage
from transplanting his wheat, after it has produced a cir∣cle
of new stems from the first joint of the straw; for if he then
parts and replants then an inch or two deeper in the ground, so
as to cover the first joint of each of these additional stems, he
may multiply every one of them four or six times, and thus ob∣tain
twenty or thirty stems from one original seed. See No. III.
1. and 7. of this section.</P>
<P>II. 1. Other vegetable embryons are produced in the buds
on the stems or branches of trees, which may be termed the
viviparous progeny of plants, in contradistinction to those from
seeds, which may be termed their oviparous progeny. These
buds are either leaf-buds or flower-buds, or both in one cover∣ing;
the bud is termed hybernaculum, or winter-cradle, of the
embryon shoot, and is covered with scales, and often with a
resinous varnish, as in tacamahacca, to protect it from the cold
<PB N="136" REF="142"/>
and moisture of the ensuing winter, and from the depredation of insects.</P>
<P>These by inoculation or ingrafting on other stems of trees,
or by being planted in the earth, become plants exactly similar
to their parents. A small glass inverted over these buds, when
set in the earth, contributes to insure their growth by preventing
too great an exhalation; otherwise they are liable to perspire
more than they can absorb, before they have acquired roots;
this the gardeners call piping a slip, or a cutting, of a plant.
In this situation a greater heat may be given them, as in hot-houses,
without increasing their quantity of perspiration, which
ceases as soon as the air in the glass is saturated with moisture;
and the increase of heat much contributes to the protrusion of their
roots and new buds, as they can at the same time bear to be
supplied with a greater quantity of moisture.</P>
<P>Every bud of most of the deciduous trees of this climate may
therefore be considered as an individual biennial plant, as dis∣tinctly
so as a seed; that is, the bud like a seed is formed in
one summer, grows to maturity in the next, and then dies. In
some trees nevertheless of this climate, as the mock orange,
philadelphus, acacia, viburnum; and in the evergreen shrubs or
trees, as holly, laurel, vinca, heath, and rue; and in all those
herbs commonly called annuals; and in most of the trees of
warmer climates; the buds appear to be formed in the vernal
months, and to arrive at their maturity d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring the same year; and may therefore properly be called annual plants.</P>
<P>2. The bud of these herbs, which are commonly called an∣nuals,
rises in the bosom of a leaf; and, as it adheres to its pa∣rent,
requires no female apparatus to nourish it, but gradually
strikes down roots from its caudex into the ground, which cau∣dex
forms a part of the bark of the increasing plant. This
occurs in those herbaceous vegetables, which have just risen
from seeds; the buds of which are properly individual annual
plants, which grow to maturity adhering to the parent, and do
not therefore resemble a seed or egg, as there is no reservoir of
nutriment laid up for them.</P>
<P>This circumstance also happens, I suppose, to the evergreen
shrubs and trees of this climate, as to heath, rue, box, pine,
<PB N="137" REF="143"/>
laurel; for in these vegetables, as the leaf does not die in the
autumn, it continues to oxygenate the blood, and to supply
nourishment to the bud in its bosom during the fine days of
winter, and in the spring, and survives till near midsummer;
that is, till the new bud has expanded a leaf of its own. Whence
I suppose these evergreens lay up in summer no store of nutri∣ment
in their roots or alburnum for the sustenance of their en∣suing
vernal buds; and have thence probably no bleeding season
like deciduous trees.</P>
<P>But the embryon in a bud of a deciduous plant leaves in the
spring of the year its winter cradle, or hybernaculum, like the
embryon in a seed, or a chick in the egg; and like these the
young plants of different vegetables have previously arrived at
different states of maturity. Thus Mr. Ferber asserts, that he
was delighted in observing in the buds of hepatica, and pedicu∣laris
hirsuta, yet lying in the earth, and in the gems of the shrub
daphne mezereon, and at the base of osmunda lunaria a perfect
plant of the futute year discernible in all its parts; thus also in
horse-chesnut the leaves, and in cornel-tree the flowers, are each
distinctly visible during the winter in their respective buds. Amoen.
Acad. Vol. VI. No. CXX. Milne's Dict. Art. Gemma.</P>
<P>While in buds of many other trees, and probably in all the
more backward buds, which are formed late in the summer on
the lower parts of branches, and much deprived of light and
air, the embryon is not so forward as to be easily discernible;
and in those shrubs or trees, which are deciduous in this climate,
and yet have no apparent buds in winter, as the philadelphus,
mock orange, viburnum, and many shrubs. I suspect there is
nevertheless an embryon secreted from the blood at the foot-stalk
of each leaf, though it is not so forward as to protrude
through the bark, and produce a prominent bud, or hyberna∣culum.
The same I suspect to occur in respect to trees, which
lose their leaves in winter, in warmer climates, in which they
are said not to produce autumnal buds; as I can not conceive
by what means fresh leaf-buds can be generated in the spring,
when the leaves, which constitute the lungs of the mature living
part of the tree, are dead; and the whole of that mature living
part, or last year's bud, consequently dead along with them.
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
But if the caudex of the new bud be generated without the plu∣mula,
or visible bud, it can certainly produce a plumula for it∣self
in the ensuing spring, as is seen by the production of new
buds, when a branch is cut off, round the remaining trunk, as
is done frequently to the stems of willows.</P>
<P>In similar manner the viviparous offspring of different animals
arrive at different states of perfection before they are born, as
calves and foals can stand erect in an hour, and quickly learn to
use their eyes, and to run after their mothers; while the blind
puppy, and kitten, and the downless rabbit, are long before they
can leave the nest which the parent has provided for them.</P>
<P>4. The presence of the pith or medulla is of great importance
to the growth of the new bud, as may be observed by gradually
slicing a shoot of a horse-chesnut in autumn, or in the early
spring. The rudiments of the seven separate ribs of the late
parent-leaf, and the central pith of the bud in its bosom, are
seen to arise or terminate near the pith of the parent shoot,
where the embryon plumula is probably secreted by a gland at
the bottom of the parent leaf-stalk, finds there its first reception
and nourishment, and is gradually protruded and elongated by
the pith, which exists in its center, as the bud proceeds, and
thus constitutes the ascending caudex or uterus of the new bud;
which is resembled by the wires of strawberries, and other creep∣ing
vegetables; whereas the descending caudexes of the new
buds, which form the filaments of the bark of trees, are secreted
from the various parts of the old bark in their vicinity; all
which probably occur at the same time by sympathy, as shewn
in Sect. VII.</P>
<P>The pith thus appears to be the first or most essential rudiment
of the new plant, like the brain or spinal marrow, medulla ob∣longata,
which is the first visible part of the figure, I believe,
of every animal fetus, from the tadpole to mankind.</P>
<P>In those plants which have hollow stems, this central cavity,
though not filled with the pith or medulla, appears to be lined
with it; as in picris and tragopogon; in the former the stem is
not only lined with the pith, but wherever a new bud is generated
on the summit of the ascending stem, or in the bosom of a leaf,
a membranous diaphragm divides the cavity, and is covered with
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
this medullary substance, which division thus distinguishes one
bud from another; and in slicing away the part of the stem of
tragopogon, where the new lateral bud adheres, the medulla or
pith in the center of the bud is seen to commence near that
membrane which lines the stem, and to pass through the circle
of arterial, venal, and absorbent vessels, which constitute the
ascending caudex, or uterus, of the new bud, while the descend∣ing
caudex of it is secreted from the various parts of the older
bark in its vicinity.</P>
<P>Something similar to this mode of the production of the buds
of trees had not escaped the ingenious Mr. Bradley, who asserts,
“that buds have their first rise in the pith; they are there fram∣ed,
and furnished with every part of vegetation, and forced
for∣wards
to meet the air through the tender bark, and would drop on the ground,
if they were not restrained by vessels, which
serve as roots to nourish them; and thus as a seed takes root in
the earth, a bud takes root in the tree; but with this difference,
that the seed has lobes to supply it with nourishment, till it can
select juices from the earth; but the bud has no occasion for
lobes, because it takes root immediately in the body of the tree,
where the proper juices are already prepared for it.” Discourses
on Growth of Plants, 1727, p. 56.</P>
<P>5. As the seed was nourished in the pericarp by an adapted
secretion from the vegetable blood oxygenated in the bractes or
floral-leaves; and as a reservoir of nutriment was also prepared
for it afterwards in the seed-lobes and fruit: so the bud is at
first nourished in the bosom of its parent-leaf by an adapted se∣cretion
from the vegetable blood; and continues to be so nou∣rished in
annual herbs and evergreen trees, till it protrudes and
expands its own leaf; but if it be a bud of a deciduous plant,
which must lose its parent-leaf in winter, a reservoir of nutri∣ment
is prepared for it in the roots of some plants, as in carrots,
turneps, liquorice, fern; and probably both in the roots and
alburnum, or sap-wood, of trees.</P>
<P>Thus in the spring the umbilical vessels belonging to each indi∣vidual
biennial plant, or bud of a tree, absorb moisture from the
earth, and propel it upwards through the roots and alburnum,
where it is mixed with a nutritious material, and carried up∣wards
in some trees with a power equal to the pressure of the at∣mosphere,
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
as in the vine, vitis; the birch, betula; and the ma∣ple,
acer, which at that season bleed at every wound, as treated of in Sect. III.</P>
<P>6. At this time the buds begin to swell, and to shoot roots
downwards from their caudexes into the earth; the intertex∣ture
of these caudexes constitutes a new bark over the old one,
consisting of arteries, veins, and absorbents, as described in
Sect. I. 3. Each bud then also puts forth a leaf, which is a res∣piratory
organ, and resembles in many respects the lungs of ani∣mals,
as described in Sect IV. but differs from them in this cir∣cumstance,
that the leaf requires light as well as air for the pur∣pose
of perfect respiration, as will be treated of in the Section on Light.</P>
<P>Each embryon of a leaf-bud is thus furnished with its proper
respiratory organ; and as many new embryons were generated
during the summer in each leaf-bud, they now pullulate in succes∣sion;
each of which has like the first its appropriate leaf, which,
as they successively advance, compose the annual shoots or sprigs
of trees; which in some plants become of great length, as in
vines, and willows, consisting of twenty or thirty new
leaves.
Hence if the first set of leaves be destroyed by vernal frosts, as
frequently happens to ash-trees, fraxinus, and to the weeping
willow, salix babylonica; or by the depredation of insects,
which often injures our fruit-trees; and perpetually occurs in
this climate to the spindle-tree, euonymus; and in Italy to the
white mulberry-tree, which has its first leaves plucked off for the
food of silk-worms, and to the tea-tree in China; a second set
of leaves succeeds, which belong to the second embryons of the
same bud.</P>
<P>But when the bractes or floral-leaves are destroyed by insects,
as sometimes happens to currant-trees, and apple-trees; the fruit
in the pericarp does not perish, like the first embryon of the leaf-bud
above mentioned; because it is still supplied by the absorbent
system of the caudex and roots of the flower-bud, which compose
a part of the bark, and pass into the ground; but the fruit be∣comes
sour and less perfect from the want of a due oxygenation
of the juices, from which it is secreted; though its glands may
probably also receive some oxygenated blood by the inosculation
of the vessels of different buds, whether flower-buds or leaf-buds,
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
with each other in the bark, on supposition that they are
not all of them totally destroyed.</P>
<P>7. In the axilla of each leaf is generally produced about mid-summer
either a new leaf-bud or a flower-bud; if it be a leaf-bud,
it becomes a branch the next year, producing many other leaves,
and many other buds; if it be a flower-bud, the growth ceases,
terminating in the seed. During the greater vigour of the plant
the leaf-buds are solely or principally produced, as in young
healthy trees, but when the vessels of the bark become further
elongated, as the plant grows taller, the nutritive juices are less
copiously supplied, or the buds are become more mature, and
the production of flower-buds succeeds as in Mr. Walker's ex∣periments
the sap of the birch-tree in the spring was two or three
weeks later in ascending to the top of a high tree, than to the
lower branches. Edinb. Transact. Vol. I.</P>
<P>Hence it happens, that the grafts from strong seedling apple-trees
do not bear fruit, till they are twelve or twenty years old;
while the grafts from old weak trees will bear copiously in two
or three years, and hence very vigorous trees, as pears, produce
fruit only at their extremities; but if you decorticate about an
inch of a branch of a vigorous pear-tree, and thus weaken it;
that branch will flower, and bear fruit at every bud like trees of
less vigour.</P>
<P>It should be here observed, that the words strength and weak∣ness,
when applied to the growth of vegetables, are in reality
metaphorical terms; or express the effect or consequence of their
producing leaf-buds or flower-buds, rather than the cause of it,
whereas it is the facility with which the long caudexes of the new
buds, which form the new filaments of bark, can be generated,
which increases the number of leaf-buds, and gives the tree a luxuriant or vigorous appearance; and the difficulty of gene∣rating
these new caudexes which increases the flower-buds, and
thus gives a less vigorous appearance to the tree.</P>
<P>The generation of buds seems to require a less perfect appara∣tus
than the generation of seeds; as that of buds always precedes
that of seeds, both in trees and herbs; and because the cater∣pillar
is converted into a butterfly solely for the purpose of semi∣nal
propagation; whereas the polypus can only propagate la∣terally,
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
or by buds. Hence the age of the plant is another ne∣cessary
circumstance to the production of flowers, fruit, and seeds,
as appears in tulips, and hyacinths, as well as in apple-trees and
pear-trees.</P>
<P>8. About midsummer the new buds are formed; but it is be∣lieved
by some of the Linnean school, that these buds may in
their early state be either converted into flower-buds or leaf-buds,
according to the vigour of the vegetating branch. Thus if the
upper part of a branch be cut away, the buds near the extremity
of the remaining stem, having a greater proportional supply of
nutriment, and possessing a greater facility of producing their
new caudexes along the bark, will become leaf-buds; which
might otherwise have been flower-buds; and on the contrary, if
a vigorous branch of a wall-tree, which was expected to bear
only leaf-buds, be bent down to the horizon or lower, it will
bear flower-buds with weaker leaf-buds, as is much exemplified
by Mr. Hitt in his Treatise on Fruit Trees.</P>
<P>The theory of this curious vegetable fact has been esteemed
difficult, but receives great light from the foregoing account of
the individuality of buds. Both the flower-buds and leaf-buds
die in the autumn; but the leaf-buds, as they advance, produce
during the summer other leaf-buds or flower-buds in the axilla of
every leaf; which new buds require new caudexes extending
down the bark, and thus thicken as well as elongate the branch;
whereas the flower-buds shed their seed, when they perish in the
autumn, and thus require no place on the bark for new caudexes.
Hence when the summit of a branch is lopped off, the buds near
the extremity of the remaining stem produce new leaf-buds with
greater facility, as there is more room for their new caudexes to
be generated along the descending bark. But if a vigorous
branch be bent down to the horizon, or below it, the bark is
compressed beneath the curve, and extended above it, and thus
the production of new caudexes along the bark is impeded, and
in consequence less leaf-buds and more flower-buds will be gene∣rated,
or the former converted into the latter; which require no
new caudexes. And on this circumstance principally depends
the management of wall-fruit trees, and of espalliers.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="149"/>
For the purpose of thus converting leaf-buds into flower-buds
Mr. Whitmill advised to bind some of the most vigorous shoots
with strong wire, and even some of the large roots; and Mr.
Warner cuts, what he calls, a wild-worm about the body of the
tree; or scores the bark quite to the wood like a screw with a
sharp knife. Bradley on Gardening, Vol. II. p. 155. Mr.
Fitzgerald produced flowers and fruit on standards and wall-trees
by cutting off a cylinder of the bark, three or four inches long,
and replacing it with proper bandage, (Philos. Trans. Ann.
1761) as described in Sect. XV. 1. 3. of this work. M. Buffon
produced the same effect by a straight bandage put round a
branch, Act Paris, Ann, Ann. 1738; and concludes that an
ingrafted branch bears better from its vessels being compressed by
the callus produced, where the grafted scion joins the stock.</P>
<P>It is customary to debark oak-trees in the spring, which are
intended to be felled in the ensuing autumn; because the bark
comes off easier at this season, and the sap-wood, or alburnum, is
believed to become more durable, if the trees remain till the
end of summer from their expending their saccharine sap-juice in
the ensuing foliage, and thus being less liable to ferment and pu∣trify.
The trees thus stripped of their bark put forth shoots as
usual with acorns on, the sixth, seventh, and eighth joint, like
vines; but in the branches I examined the joints of the debarked
trees were much shorter than those of other oak-trees; the acorns
were more numerous; and no new buds were produced above
the joints which bore acorns. From hence it appears that the
branches of debarked oak-trees produce fewer leaf-buds, and
more flower-buds; which must be owing to the impossibility of
their producing new caudexes down the naked branches and
stem for the embryon progeny of leaf-buds.</P>
<P>The pullulation of leaves on debarked oaks demonstrates, that
the reservoirs of nutriment deposited in the preceding summer for
the use of the vernal buds must be in this alburnum; and that it
is this saccharine matter which induces the alburnum to ferment
and rot sooner than the internal wood. Thus Dr. Walker
found on nice inspection the sap-juice to flow from the ligneous
circles of the alburnum as well as between them, when a fresh
piece was cut off from a cicatrized part, and also between the
<PB N="144" REF="150"/>
wood and the bark. Edinb. Transact. Vol. I. He also ob∣served
that oak, ash, elm, aspen, hazel, and hawthorn, do not
bleed; and that the birch, plane, and maple bleed the most,
and that the grey willow, salix caprea, does not bleed, but the
sap-juice rises visibly between the wood and the bark, so as to
make the bark separate easily from the wood. From all these
facts it may be inferred, that the saccharine matter, which is dis∣solved
in the sap-juice, is deposited in the autumn in the roots of
some trees, and in the alburnum of others, or in both; as
manna is found in the wood of the manna-ash; and sugar in the
joints of many grasses and of the sugar-cane, and in the roots of
liquorice, beets, and many other herbaceous vegetables.</P>
<P>9. About Midsummer, after the new buds appear in the bosom
of every leaf, many authors have remarked that there seems to
be a kind of pause in vegetation for about a fortnight, which
they have ascribed to different causes. At this time I suspect the
reservoir of nourishment for the new buds is forming about the
roots or in the alburnum of the tree; and that the caudexes and
umbilical vessels of the new buds are also at this time forming
down the bark, and terminate in those nutritious reservoirs
in the
roots or new alburnum like the umbilical vessels called seminal
roots, which are visible in many seeds.</P>
<P>That this system of umbilical vessels is possessed of a great
power of absorption in the roots of trees is certain from the
force, with which the sap-juice was propelled upward from a
vine-stump in Dr. Hales' experiment. That the sap-juice thus
propelled upward nourishes or expands the leaf of each new
bud appears from the experiments of Dr. Walker; as the leaves
began to unfold at the same height, as the wounded wood began
to bleed, and that these vessels pass through or constitute the sap∣wood
is evinced by the growth of the buds on oak-trees, after
the bark is almost totally taken off.</P>
<P>The roots of trees are at this time protruded with greater vi∣gour,
as observed by the ingenious Mr. Bradley, who on that
account prefers the midsummer season for transplanting trees, if
they are not to be removed to any great distance; and adds,
that the new shoots in the following spring will put forth with
much greater force, and the tree will thence be almost a year
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
forwarder in its growth, than if it remains untransplanted till the
winter. Discourses on Earth and Water. This seems to be
owing to the destruction of much of the nutritious matter depo∣sited
in the roots for the use of the new buds, which is torn off
in transplanting, and which can only be replaced about Midsum∣mer
or soon after.</P>
<P>Mr. Bradley further adds, that when trees are thus trans∣planted
at Midsummer, no part of the top or branches, or foliage,
should at that time be cut off; which well accords with the
theory above delivered; as it is from the vegetable blood, which
is oxygenated by its exposure to the air through the thin
moist pellicle on the upper smooth surfaces of these leaves,
that the nutriment for the expansion of the buds in the succeed∣ing
spring is secreted or produced; and hence if these leaves are
prematurely destroyed, the vernal growth of the buds must re∣ceive
injury; as the reservoir of future nutriment for them will
be less in quantity; but if some of the branches are lopped
during the winter, the remainder will protrude more vigorous
shoots, as their share of the reserved nutriment will be greater.</P>
<P>10. The umbilical vessels of the new buds of deciduous trees,
which are analogous to those which permeate the lobes of the
seed, are extended downward in the bark about midsummer, and
terminate in certain reservoirs of nutriment, which are at this
time secreted from the vegetable blood oxygenated in the leaves.
This bark now consists of an intertexture of the caudexes of
the present leaves, which were buds in the last summer, and are
now adult vegetable beings; and of the embryon caudexes of
the new buds; and of the umbilical vessels of the new buds; it
will become alburnum or sap-wood during the autumn or ensuing
spring, and will be gradually covered over with a new bark con∣sisting
of the mature caudexes of the new buds, while that, which
was the alburnum in the preceding spring, will become a circle
of lifeless timber, interior to the circle of alburnum.</P>
<P>The vessels of this new bark, though they consist of the cau∣dexes
of the individual adult leaves, and the umbilical vessels of
the individual young buds, evidently inosculate; because, when
some buds are rubbed off or destroyed, those in their vicinity
grow with greater vigour; as the daily experience of pruning all
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>
kinds of trees evinces. The facility with which the ruptured
vessels of vegetables inosculate into each other, or grow together,
corresponds with that of animal vessels in their inflamed state.
Thus a bud taken from one tree, and inserted into any part of
the bark of another tree of the same genus, or ingrafted on it,
presently receives nutriment, and grows to it by the reciprocal
inosculation of the wounded vessels, in the same manner as a
transplanted tooth; or as the fingers are liable to grow together
after having been excoriated by a burn; or as the inflamed lungs
and pleura are liable to adhere, and intermix their blood-vessels.
See Sect. III. 2. 7.</P>
<P>During the winter, when the leaves die and fall off, the arte∣rial
and venous systems, which belonged to them, and which
composed the greatest part of the bark, seem to lose their vege∣table
life at the same time, and to coalesce, and form the albur∣num,
or sap-wood; but the umbilical vessels belonging to the new buds, which are intermixed with this alburnum, remain alive;
aad at the returning spring act with astonishing vigour; as de∣scribed
in Sect. III. 2. 2.</P>
<P>As the spring advances, the umbilical vessels after having drank
up the reservoirs of nutriment, which were deposited about the
roots, and having thus nourished and expanded the new leaves,
cease to act; and the alburnum gradually changes into hard
wood, called the heart of the tree; which no longer possesses
vegetative life; and is now only useful to elevate and sustain aloft
the swarm of biennial plants, which cover it; and was probably
originally produced for this purpose in the contest of all vegetables
for light and air.</P>
<P>This inert or lifeless state of the central parts of trees, called
the heart-wood, is evident from those old oaks and willows,
which have lost their internal hard wood, and are become quite
hollow, consisting only of their bark and alburnum, and yet are
furnished with many healthy branches. But the umbilical vessels
of the alburnum possess the properties of capillary tubes, or of a
sponge, after they are extinct, and cease to act as umbilical ves∣sels;
and thus may occasionally attract moisture, or suffer it to
pass through them mechanically; whilst the new bark, which
consists of an intertexture of the caudexes of each bud with their
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>
radicles, may occasionally absorb this moisture from the capillary
vessels of the alburnum, which may be compared to the upper
stratum of the soil attracting by capillary power the moisture
from the soil immediately beneath it, which may exhale into the
atmosphere, or be imbibed by the roots of vegetables by the su∣perior
living power of their absorbent mouths.</P>
<P>That the vessels of the alburnum in their living state possess
the property of conveying the sap-juice, which is propelled up∣wards
in the early spring by the absorbent terminations of the
roots, is visible in decorticated oaks; the branches of which ex∣pand
their buds, like those of the birch and vine in the bleeding
season. That the vessels of the alburnum in their living state oc∣casionally
act as capillary syphons, through which the sap-juice is
first pushed upwards by the absorbent extremities of the roots,
and afterwards returns downwards partly by its gravitation in
branches bent below the horizon, appears from an experiment of
Dr. Walker, mentioned in Sect. III. 2. 4.</P>
<P>Lastly, that the vessels of the alburnum after their vegetable
life is extinct, possess a power of capillary attraction of the sap-juice,
or of permitting it to pass through them occasionally, ap∣pears
from the following experiments. First, a branch of a
young apple-tree was so cankered, that the bark for about an
inch quite round it was totally destroyed. To prevent the albur∣num
from becoming too dry by exhalation, this decayed part
was covered with thick white paint; in a few days the painting
was repeated, and this three or four times, so as to produce a
thick coat of paint over the decayed part, or naked alburnum,
extending to the ascending and descending lips of the wound;
this was in spring, and the branch blossomed and ripened several
apples.</P>
<P>In a garden in Lichfield about four years ago a complete cy∣linder
of bark about an inch long was cut from a branch of a
pear-tree nailed against a wall; the circumcised part is now not
more than half the diameter of the same branch above and below
it; yet this branch has been full of fruit every year since, when
the other branches of the tree have borne only sparingly. I lately
observed, that the leaves of this wounded branch were smaller
and paler, and the fruit less in size, and ripened a fortnight
<PB N="148" REF="154"/>
sooner, than on the other parts of the tree. Another branch
of the same tree has a part of the bark taken off about an inch
long, but not quite all round it, with much the same effect.</P>
<P>The existence of capillary tubes in dead sap-wood is visible
in a piece of dry cane, which permit water or smoke to pass
through them; and in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump
both water and quicksilver may be made readily to pass through
pieces of the dry alburnum of wood by the pressure of the at∣mosphere.</P>
<P>11. The flower-buds of many trees arise immediately from
the last year's terminal shoots, or spurs, either accompanied with
leaf-buds, or separately, as in apple and pear-trees. Other flower-buds
arise from the shoots as the present year alternately with
leaf-buds, as those of vines, and form the third or fourth buds of
the new shoots. They differ from leaf-buds in this circum∣stance,
that they perish when their seeds are ripe, without pro∣ducing
any addition or increase to the tree; whereas when the
leaf-buds perish in the autumn, their caudexes, the intertexture
of which constitutes the bark of the tree, gradually become
converted into alburnum, or sap-wood; over which the new
leaf-buds shoot forth their caudexes and radicles, or insert them
into it, and gradually fabricate the new bark and root-fibres.</P>
<P>It was before mentioned, that it is believed by some disciples
of the Linnean school, that about Midsummer leaf-buds may be
changed into flower-buds, or flower-buds into leaf-buds; and
that even after the vegetable embryons are generated. And that
this may be effected by weakening or strengthening the growth of
the last year's buds, which secrete these new ones from the vege∣table
blood, and nourish them in their infant state. Thus if
some inches of the extremity of a branch be lopped off at Mid-summer,
as is sometimes done by unskilful gardeners, the re∣maining
few buds will become more vigorous, and consequently
produce leaf-buds instead of flower-buds; or perhaps the em∣bryons
already formed may be converted from one kind to the
other. The contrary may occur, if a vigorous branch of a
wall-tree be bent down beneath the horizon, or so much as to
impede the generation of new caudexes; or if the leaf of the
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
parent-bud be taken off, soon after the plumula or apex of the
new bud is generated; and thus the new caudex along the bark
may be prevented by deficiency of nutriment.</P>
<P>The probability of this idea of transmuting flower-buds and
leaf-buds into each other is confirmed by the curious conversion
of the parts of the flowers of some vegetable monsters into green
leaves; if they be too well nourished, after they are so far ad∣vanced
as to be unchangeable into leaf-buds. Thus in the plan∣tago,
rosea, rose-plantain, the divisions of the spike become won∣derfully
enlarged, and are converted into leaves; the chaffy
scales of the calyx in xeranthenum, everlasting, and in a spe∣cies
of dianthus, pink, and the glume of some alpine grasses,
and the scales in the ament of the salix rosea, rose willow, grow
into leaves, and produce other kinds of vegetable monsters.</P>
<P>Add to this, that the petals of the helleborus niger, or
christmas-rose, are beautifully white till the seed is impregnated;
and then they change into green leaves, forming a calyx. And
lastly, in other flowers a bud or bulb succeeds the impregnation
instead of a seed, as in polygonum viviparum, viviparous bistort;
and in allium magicum, magical onion; the same occurs in many
of the alpine grasses, and in the festuca dumetorum, fescue grass;
all which are in some degree analogous to the supposed conversion
of early flower-buds into leaf-buds; for in these magical onions,
and other bulbiferous flowers, the bractes or floral-leaves, which
at first secrete nourishment for the pericarp and seeds of the plant,
assume a new office, and secrete a magazine of nourishment for
the new bulb, as appears in the concentric fleshy membranes, which surround the new summit-bulbs of the allium magicum, and the cloves of garlic.</P>
<P>12. The central part of an adult bud therefore consists first
of a conjunction of the blood-vessels from above and below,
which exists in the caudex of the bud between the beginning of
the leaf-vessels and the beginning of the root-vessels; the circula∣tion
resembling that of many insects, of fish and in the livers of
quadrupeds, as shewn in Sect. V. 2. Secondly, there is probably
at the same place a conjunction of the absorbent vessels correspondent
to the receptaculum chyli of animals. Thirdly, there
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>
exists in each bud an organ of reproduction, which in a leaf-bud
produces the lateral or paternal offspring, and in a flower-bud
the seminal or amatorial one. Fourthly, a center of ner∣vous
influence, as a brain, or spinal marrow, or common senso∣rium,
exists in each bud; and probably resides near this junction
of the blood-vessels of the leaf and root, and of the absorbent
system, along with the organ of reproduction in the caudex
gemmae.</P>
<P>III. 1. THE BULBOUS ROOTS of some perennial herbace∣ous
plants, and the root-scions of other perennial herbaceous
plants, are similar in this respect, which distinguishes them from
buds; that they are generated on the broad caudex of the plant
within the ground, or in contact with it, and immediately shoot
down their new roots into the earth. Whereas buds are formed
above the soil on the long caudexes, which constitute the fila∣ments
of the bark of trees, and shoot down new roots into the
earth from the lower end of these elongated caudexes.</P>
<P>Bulbs have not improperly been called subterraneous buds;
and like them they may be divided into leaf-bulbs and flower-bulbs.
When a tulip-seed is sown, it produces a small plant
the first summer, which in the autumn dies, and leaves in its
place one or more bulbs. These are leaf-bulbs, which in the
ensuing spring rise into stronger plants than those of the first
year, but no flowers are yet generated; in the autumn these
perish like the former, and leave in their places other leaf-bulbs
stronger, or more perfect, than their preceding parents. This
succession of leaf-bulbs continues for four or five years, till at
length the bulb acquires a greater perfection or maturity, necess∣ay
for seminal generation, and produces in its place a large
flower-bulb in the centre with several small leaf-bulbs around it.</P>
<P>This successive formation of leaf-bulbs in bulbous rooted plants
previous to the formation of a flower-bulb is curiously analogous
to the production of leaf-buds, on many trees for several years
before the production of flower-buds; thus the apple-trees, pyrus
malus, which are raised from seeds, generate only leaf-buds for
ten or twelve years, and afterwards annually generate both
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
flower-buds and leaf-buds. From whence it would seem, that that
the adherent lateral or paternal progeny is the most simple,
and easiest, and consequently the first mode of reproduction; and
that the amatorial or seminal progeny is on this account not ge∣nerated
till the maturer age or more perfect state of the parent-bud.</P>
<P>A still more curious analogy to this circumstance of a succes∣sion
of leaf-buds and leaf-bulbs preceding the formation of flower-buds
and flower-bulbs exists in the growth of wheat, triticum,
and other grasses; but with this difference, that a succession of
leaf-buds, as of two, or three, or four, are produced in the
same year previous to the flower-bud. At the first joint of the
stem of wheat, on or within the surface of the earth, a leaf is
produced; from which rises the principal or central-bud, and
around it many new buds, which strike their roots into the soil.
After this central bud, and those around it, have arisen six or
eight inches, a new leaf and a new leaf-bud rises on each of
them, producing a second joint of the stem; and lastly, a flower-bud
is generated at the summit, which are all evidently distinct
vegetable beings, as there is a division across the stem at each
joint, which shews there is no connexion of the pith, or brain, or spinal marrow, between the lower and upper joints, as men∣tioned
in Sect. I. 8.</P>
<P>That a new bud thus constitutes each joint of the stem of
wheat, and other grasses, is further evinced; first, by the exist∣ence
of a leaf at each joint without a lateral bud in its axilla,
as occurs in other vegetables. Secondly, because for the nou∣rishment
of this new leaf-bud a reservoir of sweet-juice is pre∣pared
in the new joint; as in the bulbs of many plants. And
thirdly, because the lower leaf dies, and the sweet juice is ab∣sorbed,
as the upper leaf becomes vegete. Hence we acquire
the knowledge of the use of this reservoir of sugar in the vegeta∣ble
economy, which supplies so much agreeable and salutary
nourishment to mankind from the cultivation of the sugar-cane.
See No. 1. 6. and No. 3. 7. of this Section.</P>
<P>The analogy between the buds of plants and the adherent
lateral progeny of some insects, as of the polypus, and tenia,
or tape-worm, and volvox, was mentioned in Sect. VII. 1. 4.
<PB N="152" REF="158"/>
But the circumstance of the successive production of leaf-buds
and leaf-bulbs previous to the production of flower-buds or
flower-bulbs is wonderfully analogous to the generation of the
aphis, which rising from an egg in the spring after casting its
skin once or twice produces a living progeny without amatorial
copulation; and this offspring produces others by this solitary
propagation till the tenth generation; then a sexual progeny of
males and females is produced, and eggs are laid in the autumn
from their amatorial intercourse. Encycloped. Britan. Amoeni∣tat.
Academ. Vol. VII. by A. T. Bladh. See Sect. XIV. 3. 2.
Thus this insect from the egg requires to be reproduced many
times by solitary propagation before it becomes sufficiently per∣fect
to generate a sexual offspring like the buds and bulbs from
seeds above mentioned. And it is probable, that the polypus
of our stagnant waters, which produces a lateral offspring in the
summer, I suppose by solitary propagation, may produce males
and females, and generate eggs in consequence in the autumn
for their reproduction in the ensuing spring.</P>
<P>To this may be added the great change, which many insects
and even larger animals undergo either in strength or form, be∣fore
they acquire the power of seminal reproduction. As the
silk-worm changes into a butterfly apparently for the purpose of
generation only, as it then performs this office and dies. Other
caterpillars change their form likewise into butterflies, and at
the same time change their kind of food, which was the green
foliage of vegetables before this transformation; but now con∣sists
solely of honey. And lastly, the gnat and musqueto
change at the same time both their forms, their food, and their
element; and thus acquire higher animation apparently for the
purpose of sexual reproduction.</P>
<P>2. The manner of the production of herbaceous plants from
their various perennial roots wants further investigation, as their
analogy is not yet clearly ascertained. I this autumn dissected
two large roots of the onion or leek kind, which were in full
flower; the stem of each of them was embraced by the cylindri∣cal
pedicles of six or seven concentric leaves; but the stem it∣self
arose from the center between three large new bulbs in one
of them, and between two in the other. All of which grew
<PB N="153" REF="159"/>
from the same caudex, but the central flower-stem was wrapped
at its bottom in one membrane only, which separated it from
the new bulbs in its vicinity.</P>
<P>A large root of a young onion, which grew form seed sown in
the spring, was at the same time dissected by stripping off the
eaves, and their fleshy bases, one after another, till two buds
were visible in the center of the fleshy bases of the concentric
leaves, which formed the bulb. These two bulbs were evidently
formed and nourished on the caudex by the stem, and its six
or seven concentric cylindrical leaves; and will, I suppose, se∣parate
in the spring, as they rise up, and produce each of them
a flower with two or three new bulbs at the base of it, as de∣scribed
in the above paragraph.</P>
<P>Or from the different size and apparent greater maturity of
the central bulb, and the secondary bulb being between the in∣nermost
and the second circular fleshy membrane, I suppose in
these roots of onion, like the tulip-roots before spoken of, that
the central bulb, alone may produce a flower in the next sum∣mer;
and that the lateral bulb or bulbs will produce only stronger
and more mature leaf-bulbs, which will in the succeeding sum∣mer
bear a flower or sexual progeny.</P>
<P>The caudex, or central part of the bulb, from which the
root-fibres descend, and the leaves ascend, lies above the knot
in the orchis morio; and the parent-root shrivels up and dies,
as the young one increases. The flower of this plant does not
ripen its seeds in this climate; it might be otherwise worth cul∣tivation
for the use of the new roots; which when scalded and
peeled, are said to be the salep of the shops. It is asserted by
one of the Linnean school in the Amoen. Academ. that if the
new root be pinched off, the seeds on the old one will ripen, and become prolific.</P>
<P>In the tulip the caudex lies below the bulb, from whence
proceed the fibrous roots and the new bulbs; the root after it
has flowered dies like the orchis root; for the stem of the last
year's tulip lies on the outside, and not in the center of the new
bulb. In the tulip-root, dissected in the early spring, just before
it begins to shoot, a perfect flower is seen in its center; and
between the first and second coat the large next year's bulb is, I
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
believe, produced; between the second and third coat, and be∣tween
this and the fourth coat, and perhaps further, other less
and less bulbs are visible, all adjoining to the caudex at the bot∣tom
of the mother bulb; and which I am told, require as many
years, before they will flower, as the number of the coats with
which they are covered; and that the same different states of
maturity probably obtain in the buds round the shoots of many
fruit-trees, the central one of which will produce flowers the
next year as on the spurs of apple-trees; while those beneath
it require more or fewer years, before they become sufficiently
mature to produce organs of sexual generation; an important
secret in the management of fruit-trees.</P>
<P>The hyacinth-root differs from the tulip-root; for, as I am
informed, the stem of the last year's flower is always found in
the center of the root, as in the onions above described; and
that the new off-sets arise from the caudex below this bulb, and
not between any of the concentric coats of it, except the two
external ones. On this account the central part is liable by
its decay to destroy the flower-bud, if not taken out of the earth,
when the leaves die; and hence some florists believe, that these
roots perish naturally in five or seven years, after they have
flowered, but that the tulip-root never dies from age.</P>
<P>In a few roots of hyacinths, which I this day examined, Sep∣tember
1, the stem of one, which had apparently flowered in
the summer, was perfectly decayed in the center of many new
bulbs. In another bulb of less size and compass, which I sup∣posed
had not borne a flower, I found a central flower-bud in∣closed
in many concentric fleshy bases of former leaves, like an
onion in the autumn, which had been sown in the preceding
spring. And concluded from hence, that the hyacinth-root
dies annually or biennially like the onion, leaving behind it a
succession of leaf-bulbs or of flower bulbs.</P>
<P>The caudex and claw-like roots of the ranunculus cultivated
by florists dies I believe annually, after having put forth a circle
of new claws from the upper part of it round the bottom of the
perishing flower-stem. Hence the claws of the old root, which
became shrivelled, as the flower advanced, in the autumn disap∣pear;
and the decayed part of the old caudex is seen beneath
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
the new claw-like roots, which I suppose has given occasion to
some inaccurate observers to believe, that the old stem in this
and some other perennial herbaceous plants was drawn down∣wards
by the new root-fibres; while the bulbs of the iris have
been supposed to have been pushed upwards, like the lamb-like
barometz, by the resistance of the soil to the elongation of the
root-fibres; which last seems to be a much more probable idea
than the former.</P>
<P>From these observations it appears, that the concentric leaves,
which incircle the stems of bulb-rooted plants, are the lungs to
the caudex, as one or more leaves are to the bud of a tree; and
that the caudex with these leaves, and the root-fibres, const∣itute
a vegetable being; which produces a viviparous progeny of new
leaf-bulbs, or a seminiferous progeny in flower-bulbs, with
a magazine of nutriment in the fleshy base of each leaf; and that
the tulip produces only leaf-bulbs for four or five years from the seed,
and then but one flower-bulb with many leaf-bulbs annually.
But that the onion-kind, allium, generates two or three
flower-bulbs in the first summer from the seed; which produce
flowers and other leaf-bulbs in the second summer from the seed.
And lastly, that it is probable, that all bulbous roots, like the
buds of deciduous trees, and perhaps of evergreen ones also, are
properly speaking biennial plants, as they rise in one summer
and perish in the next.</P>
<P>3. In tulip-roots, which have been planted too deep in the
earth, and in onion-roots, a vegetable cord, or process, is some∣times
seen about an inch long to arise from the caudex beneath the bases
of the cylindrical leaves, and to form a new bulb.
Similar to this appears the natural growth of the roots of potatoes;
a spermatic cord arises from the old root, after the leaves
are expanded in the air, to oxygenate the vegetable blood, and
a new tuberous or bulbous root is thus generated.</P>
<P>This mode of producing distant roots is exactly resembled
above ground by the wires of strawberries; which may be called
spermatic cords, which deposit a new vegetable being on the
earth, and support it like a bud on a tree, till it can strike roots
into the soil, and elevate leaves into the air. The final cause of
the length of these subterraneous and aerial spermatic cords is
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
evidently the design of placing their roots at a convenient distance
from their parent plants; that they may not incommode each
other, but may both of them more readily acquire nutritious
juices from the earth, and the ventilation and sunshine of the
atmosphere.</P>
<P>These embryon vegetables in the various bulbous and tuberous
roots are in very different states of maturity, as in the buds of
different trees; thus in the potatoe the corculum or plumula of
the new plant only is visible, surrounded with a farinaceous nu∣triment,
as in many seeds; whereas in the tulip and hyacinth the flower of
the succeeding year is discernible, as in the bud of
the horse-chesnut.</P>
<P>As the ripening of the seed of some bulbous-rooted plants
is forwarded by destroying the new bulbs, as in orchis; and the
flowering bulbs of other plants are made stronger by raising them
out of the earth, and taking away the leaf-bulbs, which surround
them on the same caudex; as in the customary management of
tulip-roots, and hyacinth-roots by the florists; I was led to
suspect, that pinching off the flowers of potatoes two or three
times might increase the size or quantity of the roots; as the
nourishment derived from the vegetable blood to the flowers and
seeds might thus be directed to enlarge the roots, and thus lay
up more nutriment for the future plants. This idea I mentioned
to an ingenious Lady, who acquainted me a few months after∣wards,
that on a few roots she had made this experiment with
apparent advantage.</P>
<P>4. The bulbous and tuberous roots of plants are a lateral or
paternal progeny like the buds of trees, and therefore exactly
resemble the parent plant, as mentioned in Sect. III. 2. 1. and
on this account may be liable to be affected by hereditary
diseases, and thus to become unhealthy; whence the canker is
supposed to arise in those apple-trees, which have for a century
or two been propagated by grafting; and the curled leaf in
potatoes, which have been too long propagated by their bulbs;
and the barrenness of hautbois strawberries, which have too
long been propagated by wires; all which diseases are believed
not to happen in these plants, if they have recently been raised
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
from seed, but want further observations to authenticate the
facts.</P>
<P>But there exists a set of bulbs, which seem to be formed by
amatorial or seminal generation, and not by the lateral or pater∣nal
generation, and would therefore seem to be a viviparous
sexual progeny. These are produced on the flower-stem in the
place of seeds; and in process of time fall off, and take root in
the earth, as is agreeably seen in the polygonum viviparum, vivi∣parous
bistort, and the magical onion, allium magicum, and the
leeke allium sativum. A curious question here occurs, whether
the plants from these bulbs are liable exactly to resemble their
parents? and whether they would be liable to hereditary diseases
from a long cultivation of them in succession, as is supposed to
happen to those mentioned above?</P>
<P>Though a perfect flower precedes the product of some sum∣mit-bulbs,
as I believe in the lower part of the spike of the
polygonum viviparum; yet I suspect, that the summit-bulbs of
allium magicum, are exactly similar to the bulbs, which are
produced at their roots; because on cutting one of them
horizontally into two hemispheres this morning, September 10,
observed three young bulbs inclosed in the concentric fleshy
membranes of the summit-bulb in the following manner; five
thick fleshy concentric coats of the general summit-bulb being
taken away, there appeared one single naked small bulb; and
one the sixth coat being removed, two other bulbs became visi∣ble,
which were included in it. Whence it seems, that these
stem-bulbs are as forward as those of the root, and probably are
in every respect similar; and that the bractes or floral-leaves,
which in seed-bearing plants secrete or prepare a nourishment for
the seed, and pericarp of the flower, acquire in these bulbiferous
onions and leeks a new office, and prepare a magazine of nourishment
in the concentric membranes, which surround their summit-bulbs;
and these may be esteemed therefore a sexual
viviparous progeny of vegetables, as buds are a lateral viviparous
progeny.</P>
<P>5. The roots of trees so resemble their branches, that subterra∣neous
buds are frequently produced upon them, which resemble
the parent-tree. The bark of the root likewise so resembles the
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
bark of the branches, that it is not uncommon to ingraft with
success on roots taken out of the earth and replanted; as the
robinia on the root of the acacia, and any other apples on the
roots or the suckers of bur-apples or of codlings; which may be
done earlier in the vernal months, as being less liable to injury
from frosty nights; and it is probable, that budding or inocu∣lating
may be performed in the same manner on the roots at
midsummer, as on the branches.</P>
<P>The roots of those plants, which are otherwise not easily
propagated, will shoot up buds, if a part of them next to the
plant be half cut through, or raised out of the ground, and ex∣posed
to the air; as in pyramidal campanula and geranium
lobatum; and after a time the root may be separated from the
stock, and many new plants may be this way produced.</P>
<P>These root-buds, or suckers, are generally produced near the
trunk of the tree, before the root descends much beneath the
soil; but in some trees, as the elm, ulmus. and acer, maple,
whose roots spread far horizontally, and near the surface of the
earth, they are generated at a great distance from the parent
tree; because the new scion can thus soon acquire the influence
of the atmosphere on its expanding foliage. These root-scions
from apple-trees are frequently used in vegetable nurseries for the
purpose of ingrafting upon, and are termed paradise-stocks by
some gardeners; but are not liable to the canker like the grafts
from those old apple-trees, which have been in fashion above
a century; as these root-scions resemble the trunk of the tree,
which produces them, not the ingrafted head of it; and thus
may not have been many years from the state of a seedling ve∣getable.</P>
<P>Similar to these root-scions of trees it is probable, that the
root-buds of perennial herbaceous plants are produced; which
have divaricated, or fibrous-roots, and whose summits perish in
the winter. For many years the root thickens by an annual
new bark being induced over the old one, exactly as in the trunks
and roots of trees.</P>
<P>As these roots increase in size, the central part, I suppose,
changes like the internal wood of a tree, and ceases to possess
vegetable life; and in process as time is liable to decay. On
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
this account these perennial roots are not so valuable for the pur∣poses
of medicine or diet, or mechanic arts, either before or after
they have passed a determinate age; as the bark of the root
changes annually into a kind of alburnum, and then into a kind
of wood, and lastly, is liable to decay, as occurs in the roots of
rheum palmatum, when they are seven or more years old. See
Sect. XVII. 2. 1. This decay of the central part of the root,
which happens annually to some plants, and is surrounded with
new buds and their root-fibres, exhibits the appearance of the
lower end of the root having been chopped, or bitten off, to some
fanciful botanists; as in plantago major, and valerian; and has
hence given to scabiosa succisa the name of devil's-bit, morsus
diaboli.</P>
<P>6. The bulbs already mentioned, as those of tulips, hyacinths,
and onions, are properly the winter-cradles, or hybernacula, of
the young plants, whether in their leaf-bulb or flower-bulb state;
and are furnished with a magazine or reservoir of nourishment
for the growing embryons, as appears in the squil, scilla maritima,
which vegetates from this source of nutriment in the druggists
shops. But there are other roots termed tuberous roots, as of
turnep and carrot, which consist solely of a large reservoir of nu∣triment
for the growth and nourishment of the rising stem and fu∣ure
seeds; whether these are produced in the same year, as oc∣curs,
when the seeds are sown early in the spring; or when their
vegetation is stopped by the cold of winter, and proceeds again
in the ensuing spring; as generally occurs to our turneps, the
roots of which I am well informed may be much enlarged by
transplantation. See Sect. XII. 6.</P>
<P>In these plants the leaves, by exposing the vegetable blood to
the influence of the air, prepare it for the secretion of nutriment
in their knobby roots; in the same manner as nourishment is pro∣duced
and reserved in the concentric fleshy bases of the leaves of
onions; and in these plants, as in the onion kind, the leaves,
which surround the base of the new stems, wither and die; as
the new buds, or bulbs put forth leaves of their own for the pur∣pose
of oxygenating their blood. Thus it appears, that the
stem and flower of the onion, or carrot, or turnep, is a new plant,
not arising immediately from the seed which was sown, but from
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
the leaf-root or leaf-knob, if it may be so called, which pre∣ceded
the production of the flower-bud, or flower-stem, exactly
as the flower or ear of wheat, which was shewn in Sect. IX. 3. 1.
to have three or four successive leaf-buds preceding the flower-bud.</P>
<P>From these observations may we conclude, that no flower-bud
or flower-bulb is ever produced from a seed, without the pre∣vious
interposition of one or more leaf-buds or leaf-bulbs? and
that those flower-buds or flower-bulbs are either produced in one
generation after sowing the seed, as the flower-bulbs of onions,
which are generated and nourished at the bases of the concentric
cylindrical leaves of the preceding leaf-plant, which arose from the seed;
or as the stems and flower-buds of the carrot and
turnep, which are generated and nourished at the base of the
concentric leaves of the preceding leaf-plant. Or secondly,
that they are produced in one summer, though after several ge∣nerations
from the seed; as the three or four joints of the stem
of wheat, and other grasses, which are generated and nourished
in succession in the bosoms of four or five cylindrical leaves, one
at each joint; which also probably obtains in all other vegetables,
which are supported by hollow stems divided by joints, and fur∣nished
with leaves at these stem-joints with or without branches,
as tragopogon or picris. In these plants, where there are no
branches, there is simply a new central bud; and two or more
lateral new buds beside the central one, where there are
branches.</P>
<P>Or lastly, where the leaf-buds or leaf-bulbs, which are pro∣duced
from seeds, succeed each other for some years, before they
arrive at sufficient maturity to produce sexual organs, or gene∣rate
a flower, as in the bulbs of tulips, and hyacinths, and the
buds of trees. Whence we at length acquire a distinct idea,
why seedling apple-trees are ten or twelve years before they bear fruit;
though the buds or shoots taken from a tree, which already
has born fruit, and ingrafted even on a young seedling-tree,
shall produce flowers in the first or second year; as these buds have
already acquired that state of perfection or maturity, which
is necessary to the production of sexual or seminal generation:
and as it therefore possesses the age of puberty, or the maturity
<PB N="161" REF="167"/>
of the tree; we may suspect, that it will sooner acquire the here∣ditary
diseases consequent to too long unmixed successive genera∣tions,
a piece of very important knowledge to the planters of
orchards; which they owe to the observation of Mr. Knight, as
mentioned in Sect. VII. 1. 3.</P>
<P>Hence in many plants produced from seeds, perhaps in all,
one or more leaf-buds precede the flower bud; and I suppose
generally, if not always, a magazine of aliment is formed at
the bases of the leaves, or in the roots, for the nutriment of
the succeeding leaf-bud or flower-bud of which it is the parent.</P>
<P>Thus in the carrot and turnep the first leaves constitute the
lungs of the new vegetable being, which generates the succeeding
flower-stem, and secretes or deposits for it a magazine of ali∣ment,
which forms the tuberous root: and then this first plant
from the seed and its leaves or lungs perish; arid the root gra∣dually
shrivels up, as it is absorbed by the new flower-stem. In
many plants these first or root-leaves differ in form from those of
the succeeding stem, as in palmated rhubarb, and in campanula
rotundifolia, which is so called from the round form of the leaves
of this first leaf-bud, or root-plant, which precedes the flower-stem.</P>
<P>7. One great advantage of Mr. Tull's horse-hoeing husbandry,
in which the earth near the rows of wheat is alternately turned
from and to them during the vernal months, has been supposed
to arise from some fibres of the roots being thus cut off, and new
stems shooting up at the ends of those which remain; but the
real cause of the production of the new stems is from the accu∣mulation
of earth above the first joint of the young wheat-plant;
from which the new buds spring out, generated and nourished by
the caudex of the leaf, which surrounds that joint, and which af∣terwards
withers; this important circumstance is shewn by the
annexed delineation of a transplanted wheat-plant.</P>
<P>The plant of wheat was taken from a corn-field in the spring,
and then consisted first of the root immediately proceeding from
the seed <HI>a,</HI> which has been called the seminal root; and secondly,
of the root, which was then near the surface of the ground <HI>b,</HI>
which has been called the coronal root, was furnished with <HI>a</HI>
stem and leaf, <HI>c, d,</HI> and with a secondary stem, or root-scion,
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
<HI>e, f.</HI> This wheat-plant consisting of only two stems was re∣planted
in my garden, and purposely buried so deep as to cover
the two or three first joints of both the stems beneath the soil;
that is as high as the letter <HI>f,</HI> where the secondary stem was
purposely cut off.</P>
<P>On taking up this plant with some others on September 24,
it had assumed the form here delineated. The primary stem,
<HI>c, g,</HI> had shot out no new roots from the joint <HI>g,</HI> which I suppose
to have happened from its being too far advanced when re∣planted;
as many other stems of other wheat-plants, which had
not been obtruncated, had nevertheless put forth one or more
lateral stems or root-scions at the second or third joints, which
on transplantation had been covered with the soil.</P>
<P>But the obtruncated stem, <HI>e, f,</HI> had generated a new root-scion
at <HI>h,</HI> like the first shoot from the seed at <HI>a;</HI> which had pro∣duced
other new stems as it approached nearer the surface of the
earth at <HI>i;</HI> and as these advanced into the air, and formed their
leaves, other new root-scions were generated at <HI>k</HI> and <HI>l.</HI>
Whence it appears, that by decapitation, and a deeper immer∣sion
in the ground, a secondary stem in this plant became mul∣tiplied
into five; all which produced perfect ears of corn; and
in other roots, which I had planted in a similar manner, the
increase was much greater: and especially where one or more
of the primary or secondary stems had been decapitated.</P>
<P>If a grain of wheat be dropped on the surface of the earth,
and suffered to shoot down its roots, and to raise its stem, which
is the process of nature, I suppose but one stem would be pro∣duced;
as the first knot or joint of it would not be covered with
earth, and could not therefore shoot down new roots; which are
necessary in these plants to the production of new stems which are
not branches but suckers or root-scions.</P>
<P>But if the grain be buried an inch deep in the earth, a shoot
rises from the roots, which issue from the seed, which is an
elongation of the caudex, and puts forth a leaf in contact with
the surface of the earth; this leaf and stem constitute the pri∣mary
plant and generate new buds, which put forth new roots
descending into the earth; and thus three or four or more suck∣ers,
or new plants, arise round the original one, which was con∣tained
in the seed: hence the appearance of two roots, which
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
some authors have named the seminal and coronal roots. The
ingenious Mr. Tull seems himself to have been aware of this cir∣cumstance,
as he says in his Husbandry, “Late planted wheat
sends out no root above the grain before spring, but is nourished
all winter by a single thread proceeding from the grain up to the
surface.”</P>
<P>This explains the prodigious multiplication of the stems of
wheat, which may be produced by transplanting it three or four
times in the summer, autumn, and ensuing spring; for if it be
so managed, that a second joint of each young stem be buried
in the soil, or brought even into contact with it, so that new
roots may strike down into the earth; the caudex of the leaf,
which surrounds this joint will generate many new buds, which
will thus become suckers, or root scions, and rival their parent;
and may be again transplanted or earthed up three or four times
with wonderful increase. Mr. Charles Miller of Cambridge
sowed some wheat on the second of June 1766, and on the
eighth of August one plant was taken up and separated into
eighteen parts and replanted; these plants were again taken up
and divided between the middle of September and the middle of
October, and again planted separately to stand the winter, and
this second division produced sixty-seven plants. They were
again taken up, and divided between the middle of March and
the middle of April, and produced five hundred plants. The
number of ears thus produced from one grain of wheat was
21109, which measured three pecks and three quarters of corn,
weighed forty-seven pounds seven ounces, and were estimated at
576840 grains! Philos. Trans. Vol. LVIII. p. 203. See Sect.
XII. 6.</P>
<P>Nor is this unsupported by the analogy of other vegetables,
in which new roots are liable to shoot in great abundance from
their joints either alone or along with new buds, if a proper de∣gree
of moisture is presented to them. Thus if the stem of a
potatoe be laid down upon the earth, and covered with soil over
the first joint, a new series of roots will be protruded from that
joint; and afterwards another series of roots from the second
joint, if managed in the same manner; and it is asserted that
this will occur even if the potatoe stems are taken out of the
<PB N="164" REF="170"/>
ground, when they are six or eight inches high, and deprived of
all their young roots, and transplanted, so as to cover one or
two joints, and that a great crop has been thus produced.</P>
<P>The rapid growth of some grasses, and of some species of the
convolvulus, and of colt's-foot, is well known, and very trou∣blesome
in many situations. Of these very minute parts of the
jointed root, when cut from the parent, elongate themselves,
and shoot up new plants. From the very numerous divisions of
the wheat-root described by Mr. Miller, it may be suspected that
something similar to this must have happened, which further
observations must determine.</P>
<P>Vines also are thus liable to shoot out roots at their joints, and
fig-trees when covered only with a shred of cloth in nailing
them to a wall, if it be accidentally kept moist. And there is
an apple-tree, which is called a burr-apple, because it puts out
roundish protuberances or excrescences of the bark like a burr,
which if the branch be bent down, or even torn off, and set in the
moist earth, will immediately strike out roots, as I am told,
and become a tree similar to the parent.</P>
<P>In the same manner I have been informed that if a circular
ring of the bark be cut off from many trees and shrubs, which
are otherwise difficult to propagate, and earth be put round the branch thus decorticated a few inches above and below the
wounded part, by means of a garden-pot previously broken lon∣gitudinally,
and bound together round the branch, that roots
will shoot from the upper lip of the wound; and in a little time
the branch may be safely cut off below the garden-pot, and plant∣ed
with success.</P>
<P>When a few inches of the end of a branch are cut off in the
spring, as is common in pruning wall-trees, new buds are pro∣duced
near the extremity, which remains; or those, which did
exist, grow with greater vigour; as they obtain some of that
nourishment, which should have supported the buds, which
were cut off. The same occurs in respect to the suckers or
root-scions of those trees, which produce them, as of elm-trees,
and of some apple-trees; if many of the branches be cut away,
the suckers or root-scions become more numerous, or more vigorous.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="171"/>
This explains the use of a practice among many farmers of
eating down a forward crop of wheat in the spring with sheep.
In this case the central or upright stem of the wheat is decapi∣tated,
and many lateral ones, or root-scions, as above describ∣ed,
become generated, or grow with greater vigour; acquiring
additional nourishment from the joint, which was to have been
expended in the growth of the central stem; and which appears
so distinctly in the preceding figure of a transplanted wheat-plant,
which nevertheless in crops, which are not too forward, may
be very injurious, as spoken of in Sect. XVI. 2. 3.</P>
<P>Thus the figure above alluded to explains four important cir∣cumstances
in the cultivation of grains, that of earthing up the
rows in spring by Mr. Tull's horse-hoe; that of eating down
the first stems of forward crops by sheep; that of transplanting
the roots deeper in the soil; and that of sowing the seed an
inch or two beneath the surface. For an account of the drill
husbandry now practised by Mr. Coke of Holkham in Norfolk,
see Sect. XVI. 2. 2.</P>

<P><PB N="169" REF="175"/>
I. 1. The various substances, which constitute animal bodies,
or which are found in the cavities of them, are composed from
simpler elements by the processes of digestion, and sanguification,
and sccretion; for it is well known, that even milk, which so
much resembles the chyle of animals, is not absorbed by the
lacteals without its being previously coagulated, and again dis∣solved
in the stomach by the power of digestion.</P>
<P>Hence it happens, that the chyle of all animals, and from
every kind of food which they take into their stomachs, is very
similar; and like milk consists of water, sugar, mucilage, and
oil; the last of which not being soluble in water, but only mis∣cible
with it, gives it its opaque white colour.</P>
<P>But though the chyle from different kinds of aliment is so
similar, and all the various constituent parts of animal bodies are
ultimately produced from the chyle by sanguification and secre∣tion,
yet it happens, that some kinds of aliment possess a greater
quantity of these particles, which make chyle, than other kinds
of aliment. Such materials for instance as already contain much
sugar, mucilage, and oil, as the flesh of dead animals, or the
fruits and seeds of vegetables.</P>
<P>Besides the water, sugar, mucilage, and oil, which exist in
chyle, there may be other materials, which are invisible from
their perfect solution in water, either alone or when converted
into acids by the addition of oxygen; as carbon, phosphorus,
calcareous earth, marine and ammoniacal salts; though it is
more probable, that the two last are formed and secreted by
animal processes, as well as selected by their absorbent roots, as
they are more compounded bodies than the former.</P>
<P>Similar to this chyle of animals the sap-juice, which is ab∣sorbed
from the earth by the roots of plants, constitutes their
nourishment, and consists of water, sugar, and mucilage, with
other transparent solutions, as of carbon, phosphorus, and cal∣careous
earth. And though it has been proved by the experi∣ments
of some philosophers, that vegetables can extract or com∣pose
all these substances from air and water alone; yet some ma∣terials
contribute more to the production of this vegetable-chyle
or sap-juice than others, such as the recrements of dead vegeta∣ble
and animal substances.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="176"/>
2. If any one should ask, what is the food of animals? I
should answer, that in the most early state of animal life the em∣bryon
lives on a mucilaginous fluid, with which it is surrounded,
whether in the egg or womb; that in its infant state the young
animal is sustained by milk, which its stomach converts into
chyle.</P>
<P>In their adult state animals are sustained by other vegetable or
animal substances taken into their stomachs, which are there
converted into chyle partly by a chemical, and partly by an ani∣mal
process; as by a mixture of gastric juice with water and
heat, some of these recrements of organic nature are decom∣posed,
either into their simpler component parts, or sometimes
even into their elements; while other parts of them are only
rendered soluble or miscible with water; and are then drank up
by the absorbents of the stomach and intestines.</P>
<P>In this process of digestion much sugar is produced, which is
probably immediately selected and drank up by the numerous
months of the lacteals, or lymphatics; to which it is presented
by the vermicular or peristaltic motions of the stomach and in∣testines.
And as this ready selection and absorption of the sugar,
as soon as it is formed, prevents it from passing into the vinous
or acetous fermentation; it is probable that from the want of
such a means of separating saccharine matter, as soon as it is
formed, chemistry has not yet been able to produce sugar from
its elements without the assistance of animal digestion, or vege∣table
germination; as further spoken of in No. 8. 1. of this section.</P>
<P>In this process of digestion, I believe, a great part of the
water, sugar, mucilage, and oil, which exist in vegetable and
animal recrements, are not decomposed into their elements, but
absorbed by being soluble or miscible with water; the carbon,
and the phospborus and the hydrogen, are also I suppose dissolved
in the other fluids by means of oxygen, and form a part of the
chyle, without their being converted into gasses; for when this
happens to any excess in respect to carbon, it escapes from the
stomach in eructations; and the same occurs to the inflammable
air or hydrogen, if a part of the water becomes decomposed in
the intestines, which if it be not absorbed by its solution in other
<PB N="171" REF="177"/>
fluids, but acquires a gasseous state, is liable to escape below;
though both these gasses seem occasionally to revert to a fluid
state from their aerial one in the stomach or intestines, and to
be then absorbable by the lacteals or lymphatics.</P>
<P>3. What then is the food of vegetables? the embryon plant
in the seed or fruit is surrounded with saccharine, mucilaginous
and oily materials, like the animal fetus in the egg or uterus,
which it absorbs, and converts it into nutriment; while the em∣bryon
buds of deciduous trees, which is another infantine state
of vegetables, are supplied with a saccharine and mucilaginous
juice prepared for them at the time of their production, and de∣posited
in the roots or sap-wood, of their parent-trees; as in the
vine, maple, and birch; which saccharine matter is soluble and
miscible with the water of the surrounding earth in the subse∣quent
spring, and is forcibly absorbed by their root-vessels, and
expands their nascent foliage.</P>
<P>In their infantine state therefore there is a wonderful analogy
between plants and animals; and it is particularly curious to ob∣serve
in the process of converting barley into malt by the germi∣nation
of the seed, that the meal of the barley is in part con∣verted
into sugar by the digestion of the young plant exactly as
in the animal stomach. The wonderful effect of vegetable di∣gestion
in producing sugar may be deduced from the great pro∣duct
of the sugar-cane, and of the maple-tree in America, men∣tioned
in Sect. III. 2. 3. and the wonderful effect of animal
digestion in producing sugar appears in patients, who labour
under diabetes. A man in the infirmary of Stafford, who
drank daily an immoderate quantity of beer, and who eat above
twice the quantity of food that those in health consume, voided
sixteen or eighteen pounds of water daily, from each pound of
which above an ounce of coarse sugar was extracted by evapo∣ration.
Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXIX. 4. 9.</P>
<P>4. We now come to consider the food of adult plants; and
in this consists the great and essential difference between the nu∣tritive
processes of animals and vegetables. The former are pos∣sessed
of a stomach, by which they can in a few hours decom∣pose
the tender parts of vegetable and animal substances by a
chemical process within themselves, conducted in the heat of
<PB N="172" REF="178"/>
ninety-eight degrees, with a due quantity of water, and a per∣petual
agitation of the ingredients; which both mixes them,
and applies them to the mouths of the absorbent vessels, which
surround them. Whereas a vegetable being having no stomach
is necessitated to wait for the spontaneous decomposition of
animal or vegetable recrements; which is indeed continually going
on in those soils, and climates, and in those seasons of the
year, which are most friendly to vegetation; but is in other situ∣ations,
and in other seasons, a slow process in a degree of heat
often as low as forty of Farenheit, (in which the reindeer
moss, moschus, rangiferinus, vegetates beneath the snow in Siberia,)
and often without an adapted quantity of water to give a due
fluidity, or any mechanical locomotion to present them to the
absorbent mouths of their roots; or in still worse situations
adult vegetables are necessitated still more slowly to acquire or
produce their nutritive juices from the simpler elements of air and
water, with perhaps the solutions of carbonic acid and calcareous
earth, and perhaps of some other matters, with which one or
more of them abound.</P>
<P>But M. Hassenfratz found, that the vegetation of those plants
was imperfect, which had not been suffered to grow in contact
with the earth; as they never arrived at such maturity as to pro∣duce
fruit; and were found on analysis to contain a less portion
of carbon, than other plants of the same kind. The experi∣ments
were tried on hyacinths, kidney-beans, and cresses.</P>
<P>Hence the other great difference, which exists between these
two extensive kingdoms of nature, is, that the larger and
warmer blooded animals certainly, and I suppose all the tribes of
insects, and of colder blooded creatures also, can not exist long
on air and water alone, except in their state of hibernal torpor.
The nearest approach to this is however seen in some fevers,
where water alone has been taken for a week or two, and yet the
patient has recovered; and there is a well attested account of a
numerous caravan, which having lost their rout, or their provi∣sions,
are affirmed to have lived some weeks on gum arabic and
water alone.</P>
<P>Vegetables on the contrary, as above mentioned, can exist,
though in a feebler state, on water and air alone, with the car∣bonic
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>
acid, and perhaps other invisible solvends, which those ele∣ments
unavoidably contain. This I suppose to be owing to the
low degree of heat, which they produce internally, and to the
slow circulation of their blood; from both which circumstances
less nutriment is expended, as by animals which sleep in winter.</P>
<P>For the purpose of supplying adult vegetables with nourish∣ment,
we should first consider what kinds of matter are most pre∣valent
or most necessary in their composition. Secondly, what
of these substances they can absorb without previous decomposi∣tion.
Lastly, how to expedite the decomposition of vegetable
and animal substances on or in the soil, like the digestive pro∣cesses
in the stomachs of animals; we may thus become ac∣quainted
with the sources and the management of manures.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>II. AIR.</HEAD>
<P>1. Oxygen combined with heat constitutes that part of the at∣mosphere,
which is perpetually necessary to animal and vegetable
respiration; and a greater part of that water, which forms a
principal portion of their organization; a few words may be
therefore premised on these most important discoveries of mo∣dern
chemistry.</P>
<P>This vital air, called oxygen gas, constitutes twenty-seven
hundredth parts of the atmosphere; it is indispensably necessary
to the existence of life, and of combustion, and forms the prin∣cipal
part of all acids; whence its name. The other seventy-three
hundredth parts of the atmosphere consist of azote, which
takes its name from its inutility to life in animal respiration; it
is also called nitrogen, because it constitutes the basis of nitre.</P>
<P>Oxygen gas consists of oxygen and heat; and when it unites
with such bodies, as are capable of uniting with it, the heat
is set at liberty, as in respiration and in combustion; in both which
processes an acid is produced by the combination of oxygen with
some inflammable base. Hence vital air consists of oxygen dis∣solved
in the fluid matter of heat; but there is also another fluid,
which seems to be combined with this solution of oxygen in heat,
and that is light. For when oxygen becomes combined with
charcoal or with sulphur, or with phosphorus, both heat or
light are set at liberty from these new combinations of oxygen;
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
which thus produce the carbonic, sulphuric, and phosphoric
acids.</P>
<P>When these new combinations of oxygen are performed very
slowly, the light is sometimes not visible, as in the heating of
a dunghill; in which process the oxygen in the cells or cavities
of the hot-bed unites slowly with the carbon and phosphorus of
the decomposing vegetable and animal matters; but though
much heat is given out, no light is seen. While on the con∣trary
from rotten wood alone, or putrescent fish, when exposed
to the atmosphere, much light is emitted, but not much sensible
heat, owing perhaps simply to the combustion of the phosphorus,
which they contain.</P>
<P>2. The products of these combinations of oxygen with other
bodies may all of them be termed acids; though in some the
heat or light set at liberty converts these acid productions into
gasses, as oxygen and charcoal form carbonic acid gas; and in
others it converts the new product into steam, which is conden∣sible
by cold, as the sulphuric acid from the combination of
oxygen and sulphur; and the phosphoric acid from oxygen and
phosphorus.</P>
<P>3. Other combinations of oxygen with heavier substances are
produced in the atmosphere without the separation of either
sensible heat, or visible light; as the union of oxygen with me∣tallic
bodies, as with that of manganese, with zinc, lead, iron,
as in common ore of manganese, in lapis calaminaris, white
calciform lead-ore, and the red ochre of iron; which have not
obtained the name of acids, but are termed oxydes of those
minerals.</P>
<P>4. Now it happens, that none of these bases, which can
combine with oxygen alone, are soluble in water, and there∣fore
can not be imbibed by the absorbent vessels of vegetable
roots, until they become acids; and are perhaps then all of
them in greater or less quantities soluble in water; and are
thence capable of being drank up by the absorbent vessels of
vegetable roots, and constitute a part of the food of plants.</P>
<P>5. When vegetable substances are decomposed by fermenta∣tion,
there is a quick union of oxygen and carbon; and this
carbonic acid gas, called formerly fixed air, rises up in vapour,
<PB N="175" REF="181"/>
and flies away. But where this process goes on more slowly,
as in a dung-hill lately turned over, or in black garden mould
lately turned over, and thus exposed to the air; much of which
remains in the cells or cavities of the hotbed, or border; this
carbonic acid is slowly produced, and is absorbed by vegetable
roots, I suppose in its fluid state, or dissolved in water, before
it acquires so much heat as to rise in the atmosphere in the form
of gas.</P>
<P>This carbonic gas in its fluid state, or dissolved in water, not
in its aerial or gasseous state, is the principal food of plants;
as appears, because their solid fibres consist principally of car∣bon,
and their fluids of water.</P>
<P>6. Next to carbonic acid the aqueous acid, if it may be so
called, or water, seems to afford the principal food of vegeta∣bles;
as water consists of oxygen and hydrogen, it is properly
an acid, like all other combinations of oxygen; and when ab∣sorbed
by vegetable roots becomes in part decomposed in the
circulation or secretion of their juices; the oxygen disappears,
or contributes to form the vegetable acids; and the hydrogen
produces ammonia by its union with azote; which may con∣tribute
to vegetable nutriment by its mixture with oils, and thus
producing soaps, which become diffusable in water; and also
by decomposing insoluble saline earths, as gypsum, or metallic
salts, as vitriol of iron, and thus producing more soluble or
innocuous salts. And which lastly forms a part of the various
vegetable productions of sugar, honey, wax, resin, and other
secretions.</P>
<P>7. There is a curious evolution of oxygen attends the per∣spiration
of the leaves of plants, which is not known to attend
that of animal lungs; and that is, that when vegetable leaves
are exposed to the sun's light, they seem to give up oxygen
gas; but in the dark they give up carbonic acid gas, like the
breath of animals. It is probable that animal lungs might do
the same, if they were exposed to the light; as perhaps might
be subjected to experiment in the gills of fish, or by breathing
through a tube into water in the sunshine.</P>
<P>In respiration as well as in combustion some light may possibly
be given out as well as some heat from the combination of oxy∣gen,
<PB N="176" REF="182"/>
with some phlogistic base, as carbon or phosphorus:
whence the production of carbonic and phosphoric acids in both
animal and vegetable respiration. In most animals this quantity
of light is probably too small to be perceived, if their bodies
were transparent; but in the glow-worm of this country, and
in the more luminous fire flies of the tropical climates, I suspect
the light to be emitted from their lungs in the act of respiration,
which is a slow combustion.</P>
<P>8. Besides the use of oxygen in the respiration of vegetables,
when applied to their leaves, as it is mixed in the atmosphere;
it is believed by many to contribute much to their growth and
nourishment in its combined state, when absorbed by their roots;
and that by the decomposition of water in the vegetable sys∣em,
when the hydrogen unites with carbon and produces oil,
the oxygen becomes superfluous, and is in part exhaled, as
further spoken of in Sect XIII. 1. 2. Hence also some cal∣ciform
ores, or metallic oxydes, as raddle, and calamine, and
burnt clay, are supposed to be useful as manures, because they
contain much oxygen, as mentioned in No. 7. 1. of this
Section.</P>
<P>Mr. Humboldt asserts, that on putting cresses, lepidium, sa∣tivum,
into oxygenated muriatic acid gas mixed with water,
they produced germs in six hours; while those in common water
were thirty-six hours before they produced germs. Jacquin at
Vienna put many old seeds, which had been in vain tried if
they would vegetate, into such a solution of oxygenated muria∣tic
acid, and found great numbers of them quickly to vegetate,
Journal de Physique, 1798. See Sect. XIV. 2. 5.</P>
<P>In the experiments of sir Francis Ford many plants, which
were sprinkled with water previously impregnated with oxygen
gas, are said to have grown more vigorously, and to have dis∣played
more beautiful tints, than those nourished with common water.
Other experiments are said to have been made by in∣verted
bottles filled with oxygen gas, and burying their open
mouths beneath the soil near the roots of vegetables, which are
said to have grown more healthy and beautiful, as the oxygen
became absorbed, and was succeeded by air like the com∣mon
atmosphere. Philos. Magaz. 1798, p. 224. Further ex∣periments
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>
are required on this subject, since the fluids of vege∣tables
would in general appear to be hyperoxygenated from the
oxygen emitted from the perspiration of their leaves in the sun∣shine,
and which is believed to arise from the decomposition of
water in their arteries or glands.</P>
<P>9. We now come to the other ingredient, which constitutes
a much greater part of the atmosphere than the oxygen, and
this is the azote, or nitrogen; which also seems much to con∣tribute
to the food or sustenance of vegetables; for though azote,
or nitrogen, enters into animal bodies in much greater quanti∣ties
perhaps than into vegetables, so as to constitute according
to some chemical philosophers the principal difference between
these two great classes of organized nature; yet it enters also
into the vegetable system, and is given out by their putrefaction;
and also when lime is applied to moist vegetables it disengages
from them both hydrogen and azote forming volatile alkali,
as asserted in the ingenious work of Lord Dundonald on the
Connection of Agriculture with Chemistry.</P>
<P>The azote of the atmosphere, when air is confined in the in∣terstices
of the soil newly turned over by the plough or spade
contributes to the production of the nitrous acid by its union
with the oxygen of the atmosphere, with which it was before
only diffused, or with the much greater source of oxygen from
the decomposing water of the soil. At the same time another
part of the abundant azote combines with the hydrogen of the
decomposing water of the soil, and produces ammonia or vola∣tile
alkali; which contributes to the growth of vegetables many
ways, as already described in No. 2. 6. of this Section.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>III. WATER.</HEAD>
<P>1. The necessity of much water in the progress of vegetation
appears from the great quantity, which exists naturally in all
parts of plants; insomuch that many roots, as squill and rhu∣barb,
are known to lose about six parts out of seven of their
original weight simply by drying them before the fire; which
quantity of moisture nevertheless does dot exhale in the com∣mon
heat of the atmosphere during the life of the root; as is
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>
seen in the growth of squills in the shops of the druggists, and of
onions on the floors of our store-rooms.</P>
<P>2. A second necessity of much water in the economy of ve∣getation
may be deduced from the great perspiration of plants,
which appears from the experiments of Hales and others; who
like Sanctorius have estimated the quantity of their perspiration
from their daily loss of weight; which however is not an accu∣rate
conclusion either in respect to plants or animals, as they
both absorb moisture from the atmosphere, as well as perspire
it.</P>
<P>This great perspiration of vegetables, like that from the skin
and lungs of animals, does not appear to consist of excrementi∣tious
matter, because it has in general no putrescent smell or
taste; but seems to be secreted first for the purpose of keeping
the external surface of the leaves from becoming dry, which
would prevent the oxygen of the atmosphere from entering into
the vegetable blood through them; since according to the expe∣riments
of Dr. Priestley on animal membranes the oxygen will
only pass through them, when they are moist. A second use of
this great perspiration is to keep the bark supple by its mois∣ture,
and thus to prevent its being cracked by the motion of the
branches in the wind. And though a great part of this perspi∣rable
matter is probably absorbed, as on the skins of animals;
yet as it exists on so large a surface of leaves and twigs, much
of it must necessarily evaporate on dry and windy days.</P>
<P>3. One of the great discoveries of modern chemistry is the
decomposition of water, which is shown both by analysis and
synthesis to consist of eighty-five hundredth parts of oxygen,
and fifteen of hydrogen. Hence a third great use of water in
the vegetable economy is probably owing to its ready decompo∣sition
by their organ of digestion, sanguification, and secretion.
This is evinced first by the great quantity of hydrogen, which
exists in the composition of many of their inflammable parts.
And secondly, from the curious circumstances, which was first
discovered by the ingenious Dr. Priestley, that the water, which,
they perspire, is hyperoxygenated; and in consequence always
ready to part with its superabundance of oxygen, when exposed
to the sun's light; from whence it may be concluded, that part
<PB N="179" REF="185"/>
of the hydrogen, which was previously an ingredient of this
water, had been separated from it, and used in the vegetable
economy, as is further treated of in Section XIII. 1. 2.</P>
<P>Add to this, that from the decomposition of water, when
confined in contact with the air beneath the soil, the nitrous
acid seems to be produced and ammonia, both which are be∣lieved
useful to vegetation, as mentioned in No. 2. 6. of this
Section.</P>
<P>4. Besides the peculiar uses of a great quantity of water, as
above described, the more common uses of it both to vegetable
and animal life, along with the matter of heat, are to produce
or preserve a due suppleness or lubricity of the solids, and a due
degree of fluidity of the liquids, which they contain or circulate.
And lastly, for the purpose of dissolving or diffusing in it other
solid or fluid substances, and thus rendering them capable of ab∣sorption,
circulation, and secretion.</P>
<P>5. The due irrigation of the soil is much attended to in drier
and warmer countries, as in Italy, Egypt, and some parts of
China; where numerous canals, and aqueducts, have been dug
through hills, and carried over vallies, for the purpose of water∣ing
the soil; and even in this colder and moister climate the
practice of flooding land is coming daily into greater repute.
For this occasional suffusion of water over land not only supplies
simple moisture for the purposes above mentioned in the drier
parts of the seasons, but brings along with it calcareous earth
and azotic air from the neighbouring springs, or other manures
from the rivers. Calcareous earth may be detected in the water
of all those springs which pass under or over strata of marle or
limestone, by dropping into them a solution of salt of tartar; or
of sugar of leadin water, or of soap in spirits of wine; and a por∣tion
of azotic gas was discovered in Bath-water by Dr. Priestley,
and in Buxton-water by Dr. Pierson. See Section XI. 3. 1.
Dr. Home thinks he discovered nitrat of lime in hard water,
and found by his experiments that it promoted the growth of
plants in a much greater degree than soft water.</P>
<P>6. Another demand for water in agriculture is to give a due
penetrability to the soil, which otherwise in most situations be∣comes
so hard as to stop the elongation of the tender roots of
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>
plants; but the cohesion of the soil may nevertheless be too
much diminished by great and perpetual moisture, so as not to
give sufficient firmness to the roots of trees. And besides this
too much as well as too little water may be supplied to the ge∣nerality
of vegetables, which grow upon the land; though there
are aquatic and amphibious plants as well as aquatic and amphi∣bious
animals, and which differ from each other as fish and
seals from quadrupeds.</P>
<P>Where land abounds too much with moisture, the art of
making subterraneous or superficial drains described in Sect.
XI. 1. must be had recourse to. But where these are not exe∣cuted,
in lands not very moist it is thought advantageous to sow
the crops early before the wet season, since corn will bear
much more moisture after it has shot from the seed, than the
seed will bear; as the seed is less tenacious of life, and in conse∣quence
more liable to putrify. The crops should likewise be
sown or planted thinner, and be reaped early in the season, as
the exclusion of the air by thick foliage, and the greater damp∣ness
of the autumn, are liable to generate mildew in moist situa∣tions.
Perhaps it should be added, that sowing early, and
the consequent reaping early, has so many advantages in all sea∣sons
on all lands, that it may in general be universally recom∣mended;
and that in wet lands it might be very advantageous
to cultivate crops by transplantation in the vernal months, hav∣ing
previously sowed the seed in drier or warmer situations.
See Sect. XVI. 8. 1.</P>
<P>7. Another injury in this climate occasioned by too great
a quantity of water arises from hasty showers; which wash off
much of the decomposing animal and vegetable recrements,
which are soluble or diffusible in water, and carry them down
the rivers into the sea. From the sides of hills this damage is
accomplished by small showers, on which account all sloping
grounds when applied to agriculture should be ploughed horizon∣tally,
as by the ridges and furrows thus produced the smaller
showers of rain will not pass so hastily off, as when they are
ploughed vertically.</P>
<P>A question here occurs, whether it be advantageous to plough
level plains into ridges and furrows? the Chinese are said never
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
to divide their fields into ridges and furrows, but to plant
their grain on an even surface. Embassy to China by sir G.
Staunton, Vol. III. p. 197, 8vo. edit. Some think it an
error to suppose, that any increase of crop can be thus obtained,
as no more plants can rise perpendicularly from the ground;
but in the ripening of grain the surface of air to which the
ears are exposed is also to be considered; which corresponds with
the surface of the ground; and is increased by its being laid in
hill and dale. But there is a serious objection to this mode of
ploughing in moist situations without sufficient declivity, as the
corn in the furrows appears weak and backward owing to the
rain lying on it too long; and also to the best part of shallow
soils being frequently taken from them to construct the ridges.
See Sect. XVI. 2. 2.</P>
<P>8. Add to this, that the evaporation of moisture from the
surface of the earth produces so much cold as to injure those
terrestrial plants, which are too long covered with it. On this
account those parts of wall-trees, which are sheltered from the
descending dews by a coping stone on the wall, are not so liable
to be injured by frosty nights on two accounts; both as they are
not made colder by the evaporation of the dew, and also have
less water to be congealed in their vessels, and by its expansion
to burst them.</P>
<P>9. Lastly, the foliage on buds of plants, which constitute one
part of their progeny, requires more moisture for its vigorous
growth, than their flowers or organs of sexual generation.
Hence in warm countries the rice-grounds are flooded only till
the season of flowering commences, and are laid dry again for
the purpose of maturating the seed; and in our climate conti∣nued
rains are liable not only to wash off the farina from the
bursting anthers, and thus prevent the impregnation of the
pistillum, but also to delay the ripening of the fruit or seeds
from the want of a due evaporation of their perspirable matter,
as well as from the less solar light in cloudy seasons; whence
in the north of Scotland the oats are said seldom to ripen till
the frost commences with the dry season, which accompanies it.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="188"/>
10. There are methods of procuring or preserving the salutary
moisture of the soil besides those of canals and aqueducts, which
should be here mentioned. These are by using as manures
such substances as perpetually attract moisture from the lower
part of the soil, or from the atmosphere; as quick-lime, and
vegetable and animal recrements in the act of putrefaction.</P>
<P>In hot-houses some have already employed steam as a means
both of giving warmth and moisture to the included plants, or
to the soil in which they grow; and a great variety of forcing
pumps have been constructed for the purpose of moistening the
foliage of wall-trees; but there is a hope from the present great
progress of chemical research, that a means may sometime be
discovered of precipitating the water of the atmosphere, which
the ingenious bishop Watson thinks always exists in it in such
quantity as, if it was suddenly precipitated, might again de∣luge
the world.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>IV. CARBON.</HEAD>
<P>1. When animal and vegetable bodies are burnt without the
access of air, that is, when their volatile parts are sublimed;
there remains a great quantity of charcoal, a much greater in
vegetable bodies than in animal ones; this is termed carbon by
the French school, when it is quite pure; and is now known
to be one of the most universal materials of nature. And as
vegetable bodies contain so much of it in their composition,
they may be supposed to absorb it entire, where they grow
vi∣gorously; especially as it is a simple material; but they may
possibly form it also occasionally from water and air within their
own vessels, when they are secluded from access to it exter∣nally.</P>
<P>The whole atmosphere contains always a quantity of it in
the form of carbonic acid, or fixed air; as is known by the
scum, which presently becomes visible on lime-water, when ex∣posed
to the air; and which consists of a reunion of the lime
with carbonic acid; which may therefore be said to encompass the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="189"/>
The simplicity of carbon, as an elementary substance, was
disputed by Dr. Austin, who believed he had decompounded it.
But Mr. Henry, by accurately repeating his experiments,
has shewn the fallacy or inconclusiveness of them. Philos.
Transact. 1797.</P>
<P>2. Another great reservoir of carbon exists in lime-stone in
the form of carbonic acid; which when a stronger acid is poured
on the calcareous earth becomes a gas, acquiring its necessary
addition of heat from that, which is given out in the combina∣tion
of the stronger acid with the lime. It also acquires its
necessary heat, when limestone is burnt, from the consuming
fuel, rises in the form of gas, and is dissipated in the air; and probably soon settles on the earth, as it cools, as it is ten times
heavier than the common atmosphere.</P>
<P>3. But the great source of carbon exists in the black earth,
which has lately been left by the decomposition of vegetable and
animal bodies; and is then in a state fit to combine with azote
or nitrogen, and with oxygen, when exposed to those two
gasses, as they exist in the atmosphere; and is thus adapted
either to promote the generation of nitrous acid, or to form car∣bonic
acid, and thus to assist vegetation.</P>
<P>Morasses consist principally of the carbonic recrements of
vegetable matter, which are gradually decomposed in great
length of time into clay, with argillaceous sand, such as is found
over coal-beds, and some calcareous earth, as in marle; and
lastly, with some iron, and fossile coal. These by elutriation are
separated from each other, and form the strata of coal countries.
In other places they remain intermixed, as they were probably
produced from the decomposition of vegetables and terrestrial
animals; and form what in books of practical agriculture is cal∣led
a <HI>loamy</HI> soil, consisting of carbonic matter, sand, and clay,
with a portion of iron.</P>
<P>It has always been observed, that this black garden mould,
or earth produced from, the recrements of vegetables, is capa∣ble
of absorbing a much greater quantity of putrid effluvia than
either air or water, and probably of combining with its ammo∣nia,
and producing a kind of hepar carbonis, and thus facilitat∣ing
vegetation. The practice of burying dead bodies so few feet
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
below the surface is a proof of this; as the putrid exhalations
from the carcass are retained, and do not penetrate to the sur∣face.
On the same account the air over new ploughed fields
has long been esteemed salutary to invalids, or convalescents,
as it probably purifies the supernatent atmosphere. But it was
not till lately known that carbon, or charcoal, absorbs with
such great avidity all putrid exhalations; if it has been recently
burnt, and has not been already saturated with them, insomuch
that putrid flesh is said to be much sweetened by being covered
a few inches with the powder of charcoal; or even by being
buried for a time in black garden mould; as putrid exhalations
consist chiefly of ammonia, hydrogen, and carbonic acid, and
are the immediate products of the dissolution of animal or vege∣table
bodies, they are believed much to contribute to vegetation;
as whatever materials have constituted an organic body, may
again after a certain degree of dissolution form a part of another
organic body. The hydrogen and azote produce ammonia,
which combining with carbon may form an hepar carbonis, and
by thus rendering carbon soluble in water may much contribute
to the growth of vegetables.</P>
<P>It has been said, that some morasses have prevented the ani∣mal
bodies, which have been buried in them, from putrefaction;
which may in part have been owing to the great attraction of the
carbon of the morass to putrid effluvia, and in part perhaps
to the vitriolic acid, which some morasses are said to contain.</P>
<P>4. Here occurs an important question, by what other means
is this solid carbon rendered fluid, so as to be capable of entering
the fine mouths of vegetable absorbents? The carbon, which
exists in the atmosphere, and in limestone, is united with oxy∣gen,
and thence becomes soluble or diffusible in water; and
may thus be absorbed by the living action of vegetable vessels;
or may be again combined by chemical attraction with the lime,
which has been deprived of it by calcination.</P>
<P>When mild calcareous earth, as limestone, chalk, marble,
has been deprived of its water and of its carbonic acid by calci∣nation,
it becomes lime. Afterwards when it is cold, if water
be sprinkled on it, a considerable heat is instantly perceived;
which is pressed out by the combination of a part of the water
<PB N="185" REF="191"/>
with the lime; as all bodies, when they change from a fluid
state to a solid one, give out the heat, which before kept them
fluid. At the same time another part of the water, which was
added, is raised into steam by the great heat given out as above
mentioned; and the expansion of this steam breaks the lime into
fine powder, which otherwise retains the form of the lumps of
limestone before calcination. But if too great a quantity of
cold water be suddenly added, no steam is raised; and the
lump of lime retains its form; whence it happens, that some
kinds of lime fall into finer powder, and are said to make better
mortar, if slaked with boiling water than with cold.</P>
<P>On this account the lime, which is designed to be spread on
land, should previously be laid on a heap, and either suffered to
become moist by the water of the atmosphere, or slaked by a
proper quantity of water; otherwise if it be spread on wet
ground, or when so spread is exposed to much rain, the heat
generated will be dissipated without breaking the lumps of lime into
powder; which will then gradually harden again into
limestone, disappoint the expectation of the agricultor, and
afflict him with the loss of much labour and expence.</P>
<P>When the powder of slaked lime mixed with sand and water
is spread on a wall, that part of the water which is not necessary
for its imperfect crystallization, evaporates into the air; and the
lime then gradually attracts the carbonic acid, which is diffused
in the atmosphere; but as I suppose this carbonic acid is dissolv∣ed
in the water, which is also diffused in the atmosphere; the lime
is perpetually moistened by this new acquisition of water from
the air; as that, which before adhered to it, and had parted
with its carbonic acid, evaporates. On which account new
built walls are months, and even years, in drying, as they con∣tinue
to attract water along with the carbonic acid from the air,
which stands upon them in drops, till the lime regains its origi∣nal
quantity of carbonic acid, and again hardens into stone, or
forms a spar by its more perfect or less disturbed crystalliza∣tion.</P>
<P>5. The earth I suppose acquires carbon, both in a manner
similar to the above by its attracting either the carbonic acid, or
the water in which it is diffused, from the atmosphere; and also
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
by the specific gravity of carbonic acid gas being ten times greater
than that of common air; whence there must be constantly a
reat sediment of it on the surface of the earth; which in its
state of solution in oxygen and water may be readily drank up
by the roots of vegetables.</P>
<P>6. Another means by which vegetables acquire carbon in
great quantity may be from limestone dissolved in water;
which though a slow process occurs in innumerable springs of
water, which pass through the calcareous or marly strata of the
earth; as those of Matlock and Bristol in passing through lime∣stone;
and those about Derby in passing through marl; and is
brought to the roots of vegetables by the showers, which fall on
soils, where marl, chalk, limestone, marble, alabaster, fluor,
exist; which includes almost the whole of this island. By this
solution of mild calcareous earth in water not only the carbon
in the form of carbonic acid not yet made into gas, but the lime
also, with which it is united, becomes absorbed into the vege∣table
system, and thus contributes to the nutriment of plants
both as so much calcareous earth, and as so much carbon.</P>
<P>7. Another mode by which vegetables acquire carbon, may
be by the union of this simple substance, with which all garden-mould
abounds, with pure calcareous earth into a kind of hepar,
analogous to the hepar of sulphur made with lime, which
abounds in some mineral waters. And this I suppose to be the
great use of lime in agriculture.</P>
<P>For the purpose of ascertaining the probability of this mode
of solution of carbon I made the following experiment. About
two ounces of lime in powder were mixed with about as much
charcoal in powder, put into a crucible, and covered with an
inch or two of filiceous sand. The crucible was kept red hot
for an hour or longer, and then suffered to cool. On the next day
water was poured on the lime and charcoal, which then stood a day or two in an open cup, and acquired a calcareous scum on its surface. And though it had not much taste, except of the
causticity of the lime, yet on dropping one drop of marine acid
into a tea-spoonful of the clear solution a strong smell like that
of hepar sulphuris was perceived, or like that of Harrogate
<PB N="187" REF="193"/>
water; which evinced, that the carbon was thus rendered so∣luble
in water.</P>
<P>Perhaps the sulphureous smell of Harrogate and Kedleston
waters, and other similar springs, may be owing to the union
of the alkali of decomposing marine salt with the carbon of the
earth, they run through? and this kind of water might thus
possibly be used as a profitable manure!</P>
<P>8. Another mode by which vegetable roots acquire carbon,
I suspect to be by their disuniting carbonic acid from limestone
in its fluid not its gasseous state; which the limestone again at∣tracts
from the atmosphere and consolidates, or from other
matters included in the soil. First, because lime is believed by
some agricultors, who much employ it, to do more service in
the second year than in the first; that is, in its mild state,
when it abounds with carbonic acid, than in its caustic state,
when it is deprived of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the use of burning lime seems hence to be sim∣ply
to reduce it to an impalpable powder, almost approaching
to fluidity; which must facilitate the application of the innu∣merable
extremities of vegetable fibres to this uncalculable in∣crease
of its surface; which may thence acquire by their absor∣bent
power the carbonic acid from these minute particles of
lime, as fast as they can recover it by chemical attraction from
the air, or water, or from other inanimate substances in their
vicinity.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the hyper-oxygenation of the perspirable matter of
plants, which thence gives up oxygen gas in the sunshine, would
induce us to believe, that a great part of the carbon, which fur∣nishes
so principal a part of vegetable nutriment, was received
by their roots in the form of carbonic acid; and that it becomes
in part decomposed in their circulation, giving up its oxygen;
which thus abounds in the secreted fluids of vegetables from this
source, as well as from decomposed water.</P>
<P>9. Another way by which carbon is received into the vege∣table
system is by its existence in sugar and in mucilage; both
which are taken up undecompounded, as appears by their pre∣sence
in the vernal sap-juice, which is obtained from the maple
<PB N="188" REF="194"/>
and the birch; which like the chyle of animals, is absorbed in
its undecompounded state.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>V. PHOSPHORUS.</HEAD>
<P>1. Another material which exists, I believe, universally in
vegetables, and has not yet been sufficiently attended to, is
phosphorus. This like the carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and
sulphur, is probably a simple substance; as our present chemistry
has not yet certainly analysed any of them; and therefore I
suppose it is taken up intire by the absorbent vessels of vegetables,
when it can be met with in a state of solution; though it may
also be occasionally formed and secreted by them; and may
hence be registered among the articles of their food or suste∣nance.</P>
<P>When wood is decomposed by putrefaction in a certain de∣gree
of warmth and moisture, it is often seen to emit much light
in dark evenings, when recently broken and exposed to the
oxygen of the atmosphere, so as to alarm benighted passengers;
which is undoubtedly owing to the phosphorus, which it contains
and which is at this time converted into phosphoric acid. Such
a light frequently is seen on putrescent veal, when kept in a cer∣tain
degree of warmth and moisture; and on the sea-weed plac∣ed
on the oysters packed in barrels, and sent into the country;
and in the streets of Edinburgh where the heads of the fish
called whitings or haddies are frequently thrown out by the peo∣ple,
I have on a dark night easily seen the hour by holding one
of them to my watch.</P>
<P>2. The existence of phosphorus in vegetables was detected
by Margraaf; who found, that many vegetable matters, parti∣cularly
farinaceous grains, contain enough of the phosphoric acid to
produce phosphorus, when they are exposed to great
heat in close vessels. Macquer's Chemical Dictionary translated
by Mr. Keir, Vol. II. p. 535, Art. Phosphorus. Phos∣phorus
has been detected in gum arabic, sugar, honey, flour,
and in every kind of vegetable or animal substance by the
process of making the phosphorus of Homberg. And the existence of
phosphorus in greater quantity in all the parts and recrements
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
of animals, as in their flesh, dung, urine, and bone-ashes, and
most copiously in the two latter, is evinced in the fabrication of
Kunke's phosphorus. Whence its universal existence is disco∣vered
in these two great kingdoms of nature. See the above
Dict. Art. Pyrophorus.</P>
<P>The most easy process for producing Homberg's phosphorus
consists in mixing three parts of alum with one of sugar, which
are to be exposed to a great heat in a covered crucible, till a
bluish flame has appeared for some time. It must then be suffer∣ed
to cool a little, and be put into a dry hot bottle, and closely
stopped from the air. A drachm of this powder will after∣wards,
when poured from the bottle into the open air on paper,
quickly kindle, become red like burning coals, and burn the
paper, which it lies upon.</P>
<P>Hence we may conclude, that vegetable bodies, as well as
animal ones, contain acid of phosphorus; and that in this expe∣riment
the acid of the alum takes the fixed alkaline salt from the
vegetable ashes, and the calcareous earth, if such there be, and
that the carbon unites with the oxygen of the phosphoric acid;
and the vegetable phosphorus is left mingled with the earth of
alum; exactly in the same manner as the animal phosphorus is
obtained from the ashes of bones, or the salt of urine, by calcin∣ing
them in close vessels with charcoal.</P>
<P>3. An important question now occurs; if this simple mate∣rial
of phosphorus be not generally made in the vessels of vege∣tables,
whence do they acquire it? They may probably obtain
it in considerable quantity from the recrements of decaying ve∣getable
and animal bodies; as it appears in rotten wood, and in
putrefying fish, and exists in such large quantities in bone-ashes,
and in the salt of urine. But I suppose there is another great
source of phosphorus, I mean in calcareous earth, which also
has been of animal origin in the early ages of the world.</P>
<P>If an oyster-shell be calcined for about half an hour in a com∣mon
fire, and is then kept from the air in a cold place; when
it is afterwards exposed for a while to the sunshine, and brought
into a dark room, it will appear luminous like the calcined Bo∣lognian
stone; which is owing to the phosphoric acid thus de∣prived
of its oxygen by the carbon of the fire-coals, and inter∣mingled
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
with the pure calcareous earth or lime of the shell; and
which again combining with the oxygen of the air, both light
and heat are emitted in the reproduction of phosphoric acid.
See Wison on Phosphoric, Dodsley, London, 1795.</P>
<P>The Bolognian stone is a selenite or gypsum, which consists
of vitriolic acid and calcareous earth, and I susose of acid of
phosphorus; since on mixing the powder of this stone with gum
arabic, and calcining it some time, a kind of phosphorus is
produced similar to the above, owing I suppose to the carbon of
the fire coals, or of the gum arabic, carrying off the oxygen
from the phosphoric acid; which previously existed both in the
calcareous earth of the selenite, and in the ashes of the gum
arabic.</P>
<P>Mr. Canton, in the Philos. Transact. Vol. LVIII p. 337,
published his making a pyrophorus by calcining oyster-shells,
and then mixing them reduced to powder with sulphur,
and recalcining them in close vessels. This powder after being
exposed to light, or heated by other means, became luminous
in the dark for many minutes. By this process the acid of phos∣phorus
existing in the animal shell had been decomposed by the
red hot sulphur having robbed it of its oxygen; and thus the
phosphorus remained united with the calcareous earth.</P>
<P>M. Du Fay, in a memoir published in the year 1730, asserts
from experiments, that all calcareous stones, whether they con∣tain
vitriolic acid or not, are capable of becoming luminous by
calcination; with this difference only, that the pure calcareous
stones require a stronger or repeated calcination; whereas those,
which contain an acid, as selenites, or gypsum, become phos∣phoric
by slighter calcination. M. Margraaf also asserts, that
all kinds of calcareous stones may by calcination be rendered
phosphoric; but thinks, that the pure ones should be previously
saturated with an acid. Keir's Dict. Art. Phosphorus. And
lastly, some kinds of fluor, which is known to consist of calca∣reous
earth and the fluor-acid, emit phosphoric light on being
heated slowly, but lose it, when much ignited. (Kirwan's Mi∣neralogy.)
This material might probably as well as gypsum be∣come
useful in agriculture.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="197"/>
4. These experiments, which shew that all common calca∣reous
stones, which contain only carbonic acid, were render∣ed
phosphoric by calcination; but that those which did contain
a fixed acid, as gypsum, and fluor, were rendered phosphoric
with less difficulty, acquaint us first with perhaps one very
important use of lime in agriculture. Secondly, with that also
of gypsum, or alabaster, which has lately been used in Ame∣rica
and in Germany without previous calcination; but which
might probably be more successful after calcination. And
And thirdly, with the probable use of fluor spar in its recent
or calcined state. As there is reason to believe, that the vege∣table
system may absorb phosphorus from any of these materials;
which phosphorus may originally have been of animal origin, as
well as that which exists in feces and urine. And lastly, the
use of recent shells or bones ground into powder, or of bone-ashes,
spread on land may be deduced; as they consist almost
entirely of phosphorus and calcareous earth.</P>
<P>5. In the conversion of shells into limestone there seems to have been
either simply an additional quantity of carbonic acid
attracted from the air or from water during the procession of
ages, and added to the calcareous earth, or also a diminution
of the phosphoric acid. But an union of phosphoric acid only
with lime has lately been found to compose whole mountains in
Spain, which is mentioned by Fourcroy, and is now termed
phosphate of lime, resembling bone-ashes. And M. Brumaire
lately received from Spain a yellowish translucent stone, called
chrysolite by the jewellers, which he found to contain nearly
equal parts of phosphoric acid and calcareous earth, and to be
spar or crystallization of the phosphate of lime. And as the
limestone at Breedon has Iately been discovered to contain equal
parts of magnesia and lime, we may hope by greater attention to
discover a mountain of phosphate of lime in our own country.
See Nicholson's Journal 1798, p. 414.</P>
<P>From hence it would appear, that the immense quantities of
limestone in the world, which was originally formed from the
shells of submarine animals, has during the long lapse of time
lost more or less of its original phosphoric acid, and acquired
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
more or less carbonic acid. The carbon dissolved in the atmos∣phere
or in the ocean having thus slowly decomposed the phos∣phoric
acid in the elaboratory of nature without great heat, as it
does in our crucibles in a short time by the assistance of great
heat.</P>
<P>It is probable that much phosphorus may be consumed in our
inartificial mode of burning lime, which might be preserved by
calcining limestone in close vessels, and thus detaching the car∣bonic
acid without admitting the aerial oxygen to the phospho∣rus;
but the advantage to agriculture of such a process can only
be determined by experiment.</P>
<P>There are many instances given by Mr. Anderson, and by
Lord Kaims, of soils which are said to have been for ages un∣commonly
fertile without addition of manures or culture. These
are plains near the shore in the county of Caithness, and in the
Hebrides, and are said to consist almost entirely of shells broken
into very small particles, without almost any mixture of other
soil. See Encyclop. Britan. Art. Agricult. Now the soil of
an extensive country called Lincoln Heath I observed some
years ago to consist in a great degree of powdered limestone,
which like the Ketton limestone appeared in small rounded par∣ticles,
which I suppose had in remote times been dissolved in
water, and again precipitated; which shews a probable differ∣ence
between this lime and recent shells in respect to their anti∣quity,
and consequently that the former must contain much of
the original phosphoric acid, and the latter only carbonic acid.
And as Lincoln Heath was then esteemed a very unproductive
soil, there is reason to infer that the phosphoric acid in recent
shells is of greatly more service to agriculture than the carbonic
acid of alluvial limestone, or than calcined lime alone.</P>
<P>Hence it is probable, that a greater quantity of phosphoric
acid may exist in some marles than in others, as well as in
some limestones; thus the appearance of recent shells exists in the
lime near Loughborough in Leicestershire, in the road to Not∣tingham,
and in some marles called shell-marl; which must
therefore probably contain much more phosphoric acid, so as
almost to resemble the bones of animals; and may thus be more
friendly to vegetation. A piece of land is mentioned by Mr.
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>
Anderson, that, after a thick Coat of marle laid on it, bore crops
for thirty years without additional improvement, and I think it
was called shell-marle. See Encyclop. Britan. Agricult.</P>
<P>6. A medical philosopher, M. Bonhomme, has endeavoured
shew, that the hardness of animal bones depends on the quantity
of phosphoric acid united to calcareous earth, which they con∣tain;
and that the rickets, a disease in which the bones become
too soft, is solely owing to the want of it, or to the existence of
the vegetable acid instead of it. Annales de Chemie, Vol.
XVII. May we not conclude, that the presence of phospho∣ric
acid in the vegetable system must be of importance; because it
so universally exists in them, and may probably give firmness to
liqueos as well as to osseous fibres? To which may be added,
that M. Fourcroy believes, that the ashes of burnt vegetables,
which have been supposed to consist of earth or clay, when the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixed alkali is washed from them, are principally calcareous
phosphorus, like those of animal bones. The same is asserted
by Lord Dundonald in his Connection of Agriculture and
Chemistry, p. 25, who calls the insoluble part of vegetable
ashes a phosphat of lime. This subject is worthy further investi∣gation.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>VI. LIME.</HEAD>
<P>Many of the principal uses of calcareous earth in promoting
the growth of vegetables have been already mentioned in this
section, which we shall recapitulate with additions.</P>
<P>1. One great use of calcareous earth I suspect to consist in its
uniting with the carbon of the soil in its pure or caustic state, or
with that of vegetable or animal recrements during some part of
the process of putrefaction; and thus rendering it soluble in
water by forming an hepar carbonis, somewhat like an hepar sul∣phuris
produced by lime and sulphur, as mentioned in No. 4. 7.
of this Sect.; by which process I suppose the carbon is rendered
capable of being absorbed by the lacteal vessels of vegetable
roots.</P>
<P>The black liquor, which flows from dunghills, is probably a
fluid of this kind; but I mean to speak hypothetically, as I have
not verified it by experiment; and the carbon may be simply sup∣ported
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
in the water say mucilage, like the coffee drank at our
tea-tables; or may be converted into an hepar carbonis by its
union with the fixed alkali of decaying vegetable matter, or by
the volatile alkali, which accompanies some stages of putrefaction.
See No. 10. 3. of this Section.</P>
<P>2. A second mode of its serving the purposes of vegetation I
believe to be by its union with carbonic acid, and rendering it
thus soluble in water in its fluid state instead of its being ex∣panded
into a gas; and that thus a great quantity of carbon
may be drank up by vegetable absorbent vessels.</P>
<P>In the practice newly introduced of watering lands by de∣riving
streams over them for many weeks together, I am informed▪
that water from springs is generally more effectual in promoting
vegetation than that from rivers; which though it may in part
be owing to the azotic gaz, or nitrogen, contained in some
springs, as those of Buxton and of Bath, according to the ana∣lysis
of Dr. Priestley, and of Dr. Pearson; yet I suppose it to
be principally owing to the calcareous earth, which abounds in
all springs, which pass over marly soils, or through calcareous
strata; and which does not exist in rivers, as the salts washed in∣to
rivers from the soil all seem to decompose each other, except
the marine salt, and some magnesian salt, which are carried down
into the ocean. The calcareous earth likewise which is washed
into rivers, enters into new combinations, as into gypsum, or
perhaps into siliceo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s sand, and subsides. These solutions of
calcareous earth in those waters, which are termed hard waters,
and which incrust the sides of our tea-kettles, may possibly also
contribute to the nutriment of animals, as mentioned in Zoono∣mia,
Part III. Article I. 2. 4. 2.</P>
<P>3. A third mode, by which lime promotes vegetation, I sup∣pose
may be ascribed to its containing phosphorus; which by its
union with it may be converted into an hepar, and thus rendered
soluble in water, without its becoming an acid by the addition of
oxygen. Phosphorus is probably as necessary an ingredient in vegetable
as in animal bodies; which appears by the phosphoric
light visible on rotten wood during some stages of putrefaction;
in which I suppose the phosphorus is set at liberty from the cal∣careous
earth, or from the fixed alkali, or from the carbon of
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
the decomposing wood, and acquires oxygen from the atmos∣phere;
and both warmth and light are emitted during their
union. But phosphorus may perhaps more frequently exist in
the form of phosphoric acid in vegetables, and may thus be rea∣dily
united with their calcareous earth, as mentioned in No. 5. 6.
of this Section, and may be separated from its acid by the
carbon of the vegetable during calcination, and also during pu∣trefaction,
which may be considered as a slow combustion.</P>
<P>The existence of a solution of phosphoric acid and calcareous
earth in the vessels of animals is proved by the annual renova∣tion
of the shells of crab-sish, and by the fabrication of the egg-shells
in female birds; and is occasionally secreted, where it ce∣ments
the wounds made on snail-shells; or where it joins the
present year's growth of a snail-shell to the part, where a mem∣braneous
cover had been attached for the protection of the animal
during its state of hibernation. And lastly, it is evident from
the growth of the bones of quadrupeds, and from the deposition
of callus to join them where they have been broken.</P>
<P>4. Lime in its pure state is soluble in about 600 times its
weight of water; and by a greater quantity of carbonic acid
than is necessary for its crystallization, it is soluble in water in
much greater quantities, as appears by the calcareous deposition
of the water at Matlock; and may I suppose supply a nutritious
substance by uniting with mucilage or oil, either in the earth at
the roots of vegetables, or on the surface of the soil, which may
be gradually washed down to them.</P>
<P>If a solution of soap be poured into lime-water, the oil of the
soap combines with the calcareous earth, and the caustic alkali is
set at liberty, according to the experiments of Mr. Bertholet;
(see Nicholson's Journal, Vol. I. p. 170,) who concludes, that
oil has a stronger affinity to calcareous earth than it has to fixed
alkali. At the same time it appeared, that a solution of the
mild or effervescent fixed alkali poured on this calcareous soap
would decompose it by twofold elective attraction; as the car∣bonic
acid of the mild fixed alkali unites with the calcareous
earth of the calcareous soap, and the oil unites with the pure or
caustic alkali.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="202"/>
Many arguments may be adduced to shew, that calcareous
earth either alone, or in some of the states of combination above
mentioned, may contribute to the nourishment both of animals
and vegetables. First, because calcareous earth constitutes a
considerable part of them, and must therefore either be received
from without, or formed by them, or both. Secondly, because
from the analogy of all organic life, whatever has composed a part
of a vegetable or animal, may again after its chemical solution
become a part of another vegetable or animal; such is the gene∣ral
transmigration of matter!</P>
<P>5. There are other uses of lime in agriculture, which may not
be ascribed to it as a nutritive food for vegetables, but from its
producing some chemical or mechanical effects upon the soil, or
upon other manures with which it is mixed; as first, from its
destoying in a short time the cohesion of dead vegetable fibres,
and thus reducing them to earth; which otherwise is effected by
a slow process, either by the consumption of insects, or by a gra∣dual
putrefaction. This is said to be performed both by mild
and by caustic calcareous earth, as in the experiments both of
Pringle and Macbride. It is said that unburnt calcareous earth
forwards the putrefaction of a mixture of animal and vegetable
matter. But that pure lime, though it seemed to prevent putre∣faction,
destroyed or dissolved the texture of the flesh. Thus I
am informed, that a mixture of lime with oak-bark, after the
tanner has extracted from it whatever is soluble in water, will
in two or three months reduce it to a fine black earth; which
if only laid in heaps, would require as many years to effect by
its own spontaneous fermentation or putrefaction. This effect of
lime must be particularly advantageous to newly enclosed com∣mons
when first broken up.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis, in the papers of the Society of Arts, Vol. XVI.
p. 122, asserts, that on a common, which had been previously
covered with heath, but was otherwise very barren, the effect of
lime was very advantageous for about ten years, during which
time the vegetable roots might be supposed to have been dissolved
and expended; but that a second liming he observed produced
no good effect. It is probable the good effect might not be so
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>
great, but I should doubt she circumstance of its producing no
good effect at all.</P>
<P>Mr. Browne of Derby has also an ingenious paper in the
transactions of the Society of Arts, in which he asserts, that
recent vegetables, as clover, laid on heaps and stratified with
fresh lime, are quickly decomposed, even in a few days. The
heat occasioned by the moisture of the vegetables uniting with
the lime I suppose quickens the fermentation of the vegetable
juices, and produces charcoal in consequence of combustion,
similar to that frequently produced in new haystacks, which if
air be admitted burst into flame.</P>
<P>Secondly, lime for many months continues to attract mois∣ture
from the air or earth; which it deprives I suppose of car∣bonic
acid, and then suffers it to exhale again, as is seen on the
plastered walls of new houses. On this account it must be ad∣vantageous
when mixed with dry or sandy soils, as it attracts
moisture from the air above, or the earth beneath; and this
moisture is then absorbed by the lymphatics of the roots of ve∣getables.</P>
<P>Thirdly, by mixing lime with clays it is believed to make them
less cohesive; and thus to admit of their being more easily pene∣trated
by vegetable fibres.</P>
<P>Fourthly, a mixture of lime with clay destroy its superabun∣dancy
of acid, if such exists; and by uniting with it converts it
into gypsum, or alabaster.</P>
<P>Fifthly, when lime is mixed with a compost of soil and ma∣nure,
which is in the state of generating nitrous acid, it arrests
the acid as it forms, and produces a calcareous nitre, and thus
prevents both its exhalation and its easy elutriation.</P>
<P>And lastly, fresh lime destroys worms, snails, and other in∣sects,
with which it happens to come in contact, and with which
almost every soil abounds.</P>
<P>6. The various properties of lime above described account for
the great uses of it on almost all lands; except perhaps some of
those which already abound with calcareous earth.</P>
<P>On riding from Beckingham to Sleaford, and from thence to
Lincoln, I was informed by three or four farmers, that lime had
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
been tried, but was believed to be of no service in that country.
Nor was I surprized at this observation, as I had seen fragments
of alluvial limestone thrown out of every ditch on the road,
which was of a loose texture, consisting of calcareous sand, like
the Ketton limestone, rounded by friction, before it was con∣solidated
into a mass, the upper surface of which was broken
into fragments when it was raised from the sea by subterraneous
fires, or by its cooling from a hot state or its drying from a
moist one.</P>
<P>Thus, as I had ridden over one single alluvial limestone above
ten miles broad and above twenty long, the broken surface of
which appeared in the bottom of almost every ditch, I concluded,
that the soil must be calcareous earth mixed only with some ani∣mal
and vegetable recrements, and that an addition of pure lime
could probably not be of much advantage to the vegetables it
supported. And the same I suppose must occur in those situa∣tions,
where the surface of the soil consists almost totally of
chalk, which is another kind of alluvial limestone; that is,
which has been dissolved in water in the early ages of the world,
and again deposited.</P>
<P>Yet even in some soils, which abound in calcareous earth,
lime is esteemed to be of service; which may be owing both to
its caustic quality, and to its being so finely pulverized. For a
part of the water, which combines with it after calcination, gives
out so much heat as to convert another part of it into steam;
which breaks the calcined lime-lumps into a most subtile and im∣palpable
powder, approaching even to fluidity, as mentioned in
No. 4. 4. of this Section.</P>
<P>In the parish of Hartington in Derbyshire there is a stratum
of hard limestone, or marble, as I am informed, immediately
beneath a shallow soil, and which in many places peeps through
it; yet on some of this land an ingenious active agricultor has
laid lime on the grass in great quantity with prodigious advan∣tage;
and that he continues annually to improve by this means a
considerable extent of land.</P>
<P>The difference between the hard limestone of this part of
Derbyshire, and the soft sand-formed limestone about Lincoln
Heath and Sleaford, may render the incumbent soil to be more
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
or less mixed with calcareous earth; or they may abound more
or less with phosphoric acid, as mentioned in No. 5. 5. of this
Section. But it may have happened, that some prejudices of
the farmers, who gave me the information, might have led them
to condemn the use of lime about Sleaford and Lincoln; and I
should again recommend it to their serious attention.</P>
<P>Another improper situation for the use of lime is said to be on
those lands, which are too wet, and which therefore should be
previously drained; otherwise the lime is said to coalesce into a
kind of mortar, and become so hard, that the tender plumula of
growing seeds, or the fine extremities of their roots, can not
easily penetrate it. This may occur more certainly in that kind
of lime, which contains manganese, and is therefore capable of
setting under water, as, I suppose, the barrow lime of Leicester∣shire,
and agnes lime near Ashbourn in Derbyshire.</P>
<P>7. The great and general advantage of lime in all soils and all
situations, except some of those which are already replete with
calcareous earth, or are too moist, can only be understood from
the idea already mentioned of its supplying actual nutrition to
vegetables; and this seems more probable, as it contributes so
much to the melioration of the crops, as well as to their increase
in quantity. Wheat from land well limed is believed by farmers,
millers, and bakers, to be, as they suppose, thinner skinned;
that is, it turns out more and better flour; which I suppose is
owing its containing more starch and less mucilage.</P>
<P>Hence we perceive another very important use of lime in cul∣tivation
of land may be owing to its forwarding the conversion of
mucilage into starch, that is to its forwarding the ripening of the
seed; which is a matter of great consequence in this climate of
short and cold summers. See Sect. VI. 3. and XVI. 3.</P>
<P>In respect to grass-ground I am informed, that if a spadeful
of lime be thrown on a tussock, which horses or cattle have re∣fused
to eat for years, they will for many succeeding seasons
eat it quite close to the ground; which is owing, I suspect, to
the grass containing more sugar in its joints; or to the less acid∣ity
of all its juices.</P>
<P>8. There are not only some other bodies, which possess a cal∣careous
base, besides the common limestone, as gypsum, fluor,
<PB N="200" REF="206"/>
bone-ashes, and perhaps vegetable ashes; but there are others
which are occasionally united with carbonic acid, and may be de∣tached
from it by calcination, as the aerated barytes and magne∣sia.
The last in its calcined state may possibly be as useful in agri∣culture
as the lime of calcareous earth, with which I believe it
is frequently mixed. For Mr. Tennant assured me a few days
ago, that he had analysed the limestone of Breedon in Leicester∣shire,
and found it to contain nearly as much magnesia as cal∣careous
earth, besides some manganese; which is nevertheless a
lime much esteemed in this country both for architecture and agri∣culture.
As magnesia exists in sea-water, and in salt springs, it
may render these waters useful as a manure as well as the ma∣rine
salt, which they contain. As steatites or soap-stone con∣sists
principally of magnesia, perhaps this limestone of Breedon
may be worth the attention of the porcelain manufactory.</P>
<P>This magnesian lime of Breedon is further worthy attention in
the cultivation of land, and particularly where a soil abounds
with vitriol of iron, or where it abounds with gypsum, as about
Chelaston on the banks of the Derwent, and from Nottingham
to Newark on the banks of the Trent, as the magnesian earth
would unite with the vitriolic acid, and leave an ochre of iron
in one case, and lime in the other; at the same time a soluble
salt, called Epsom salt, would be formed, which, according to
the experiments of Dr. Home, promotes rapid vegetation. To
sow a few pecks of gypsum reduced to powder on grass land, as
is done in America; and then to sow upon this twice or thrice
as much Breedon lime, might be an experiment which might
be advantageous in the part of Derbyshire next to Leicester∣shire,
where both of them are to be obtained at no great ex∣pence.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>VII. CLAY, METALLIC OXYDES, NITRE, SEA-SALT.</HEAD>
<P>1. The too great adhesion of the particles of argillaceous
earth or clay renders it in its pure state unfit for vegetation; as
the tender fibrils of roots can with difficulty penetrate it, whence
it becomes much improved for the purposes of agriculture, when
it is mixed with calcareous earth and with siliceous sand, as
in marle.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="207"/>
It is commonly believed that lumps of clay become meliorated
by being exposed to frost in its moist state, which by expanding
the water, which it contains, by converting it into ice is sup∣posed
to leave the particles of the clay further from each other.
This however seems in general to be a mistaken idea, since if the
act of freezing be not very suddenly performed, a contrary effect
seems to occur, as noticed by Mr. Kirwan; who observes,
“that clay in its usual state of dryness can absorb two and a
half times its weight of water without suffering any to drop out,
and retains it in the open air more pertinaciously than other
earths; but that in a freezing cold clay contracts more than
other earths squeezing out its water, and thus parting with more
of it than other earths.” Mineralogy, Vol. I. p. 9.</P>
<P>This curious circumstance, that water, as it crystallizes, de∣trudes
the clay, which is diffused in it, corresponds with other
facts of congelation. Thus when wine, or vinegar, or common
salt and water, or a solution of blue vitriol in water, are ex∣posed
to frosty air; the alcohol, the acetuous acid, the marine
salt, and the calx of copper, are all of them detruded from the
aqueous crystals, and retreat to the central part of the fluid, or
to that last frozen, or into numerous cells surrounded with par∣titions
of ice, as I have frequently observed; whence it appears,
that wet clay is in general rendered more solid and tenacious by
being frozen, as well as when it is dried, and its moisture ex∣haled
by too warm a sun; and by both those circumstances be∣comes
less adapted to the purposes of agriculture.</P>
<P>2. In most clays a kind of effervescence occurs, after they
are turned over, and thrown on heaps, and thus acquire air
into their intestines, which renders them much fitter for the pur∣poses
of vitrification; and thus forwards the processes of the
brick-kiln and pottery. This greater facility to vitrify is proba∣bly
effected by the union of oxygen with the iron, which most
clays contain; as oxydes of lead and manganese are used in the
more perfect vitrifications.</P>
<P>The calciform ores, or oxydes, of iron, manganese, and zinc,
are frequently found near the surface of the earth, where they
have been united with oxygen by the passing currents of the at∣mosphere;
and have been supposed to have originated from the
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
decomposition of vegetables and animal bodies, as mentioned in
Botanic Garden, Vol. I. additional note 18. Iron has been
detected in all vegetable and animal matters, manganese in some
of them; and, if we possessed a test for discovering such minute
particles of zinc, as the magnet discovers of iron, it is probable,
that zinc also would be detected in the vegetables, which grow
over its beds.</P>
<P>As some philosophers have lately contended for the great uti∣lity
of oxygen in vegetation, as Humboldt and Von Uslar;
who affirm from their experiments, that hyper-oxygenated mu∣riatic
acid used in small quantities promotes both the growth and
irritability of plants; there is reason to suspect, that the calci∣form
ores of iron, manganese, and zinc, as well as minium,
and other calces or oxydes of metals made by fire, and even
burnt clays, when strewed on the ground, may contribute to ve∣getation
by their parting with their abundant oxygen in a fluid
not in a gasseous form; which uniting with carbon, or phospho∣rus,
or nitrogen, without emitting perceptible heat or light,
might supply nutritious fluids to the roots of vegetables; further
experiments are wanted on this subject. But I am well informed,
that a red ochre of iron, called raddle, has been used on some
lands with advantage in the north of Staffordshire; and should
recommend a trial of manganese in nose counties, where it
abounds, as near Kingsbury, and near Atherstone in Warwick∣shire;
and a trial of lapis calaminaris, where it abounds, as near
Matlock in Derbyshire; and even of the calciform ore of lead,
which is found in Anglesey, and on the top of some other lead
mines.</P>
<P>M. Humboldt asserts, that he mixed many seeds into a kind of
paste with the black oxyde of manganese, and poured over it the
muriatic acid diluted with water, in the proportion of about six
of water to one of acid; and that much oxygen was thus disen∣gaged,
and occasioned quick vegetation. Journal de Physique,
1798. See No. 2. 8. of this Section.</P>
<P>3. When clays are turned up with the spade, as is usual
in preparing them for the brick-kiln, a kind of effervescence
occurs, as mentioned above; which is probably owing to the
escape of the azote of the air imprisoned in the interstices,
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
as the oxygen unites with some metallic particles in the
clay; or to steam raised from the water in the clay by the heat
set at liberty from the combination of the oxygen and the iron.
This union of oxygen with iron is curiously almost visible in
many granates or porphyries; which I have seen thinly scattered
in large nodules near Cannock in Staffordshire, in the road from
Lichfield to Shrewsbury; and on breaking them have observed
no appearance of iron on the newly divided surfaces; but which
in a few days acquired an ochery appearance on them, which pe∣netrated
nearly half an inch. This can not but be ascribed to
the oxygen of the atmosphere having united with the iron in
these stones, which by their smell, when breathed upon, contain
indurated clay, and having converted into an oxyde either the
clay itself, or some metallic particles included in it.</P>
<P>There is nevertheless an exhalation from clay, and perhaps
from most soils, when they have been previously dried, and then
sprinkled with water, as after a shower in summer, which has
been supposed to be salubrious to invalids and convalescents. This
remarkably occurs when dry clay is breathed upon even in its most
indurated state as in granites and porphyries, by which criterion
these stones are immediately distinguished from the siliceous and
calcareous ones. This I imagine is produced by the heat set at
liberty by the combination of dry clay and water, like that pro∣duced
in so much greater degree by the combination of lime and
water; and that this heat raises a part of the acquired moisture
into steam, in which are dissolved the odorous particles; both
which probably cause the quick vegetation on clayey soils after
the showers in summer.</P>
<P>When marl, which consists of clay, calcareous earth, and
sand, which are frequently coloured red by iron, or blue pro∣bably
by manganese, is exposed in small lumps to the atmos∣phere;
it is liable to crumble into powder, which I suppose to
arise from a similar circumstance; that the oxygen of the at∣mosphere
uniting with the clay, or the metallic particles it
possesses, lets at liberty the same gas, or steam, which is seen
to rise from clay, when thrown on heaps for the brick-kiln or
pottery; which breaks the lumps into powder, as the lumps of
lime are broken into powder by the steam, which is generated
<PB N="204" REF="210"/>
when water is thrown on them, by the heat set at liberty by
the combination of the lime and water.</P>
<P>This union of oxygen with the clay, or with the metallic
particles mingled with it, I suppose to be much facilitated by
exposing it to a red heat, as in burning bricks; while a greater
heat may unite so much oxygen with it as to turn it into glass.
Exactly such a process occurs in the production of minium; a
certain quantity of heat with the contact of air combines so
much oxygen with the melted lead, as to form an oxyde; a
greater quantity of heat converts it into glass.</P>
<P>4. When clay is united with so much oxygen by fire as to
form a soft or imperfect brick, it possesses the power of promot∣ing
the generation of the nitrous acid in certain situations;
which is frequently seen like an efflorescence on mouldering
walls, having become by the addition of lime a calcareous nitre.
The use of these soft bricks in the production of nitre is well
known in Paris, where the rubbish of old houses is regularly
purchased for that purpose; which before the revolution was a
royal manufacture.</P>
<P>As these soft efflorescent bricks from old houses are known
powerfully to promote vegetation, when pulverized and mixed
with the soil; at the same time that they are capable of pro∣ducing
the nitrous acid; I imagine, that the use of paring and
burning the turf of some newly enclosed commons depends on
this circumstance. That is, that the heat emitted from the
burning vegetable fibres unites oxygen with the clay; which
latter forms more than half of the slices of turf, as they are dug
from the ground. In other respects the paring and burning of
grass grounds would certainly be a wasteful procedure; as much
carbon is converted into carbonic acid, and dispersed along with
the uninflamed smoke or soot, and nothing left but the vegeta∣ble
ashes. From these considerations it would probably be
worthy experiment in farms, where coal and clay abound, to
burn the latter to a certain degree; which might supply an ex∣haustless
source of profitable manure.</P>
<P>5. I have suspected also, that this calcined clay, as it exists
in soft bricks, has a power of decomposing marine salt, as I
once observed in a cellar, where beef had been long salted on
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>
one side of a nine-inch wall, the wooden salting-tub for which
was attached to it; that a great efflorescence appeared on the
other side of the wall, which I believed to be fossile alkali or
natron. If this idea be just, the soft bricks from old buildings,
or clays so far purposely burnt, may in this manner be service∣able
to vegetation, by separating the fossile alkali from the sea-salt,
which is washed from decomposing animal and vegetable
substances; which by converting carbon into an hepar carbonis,
as lime is supposed to do in No. 6. 1. of this section, might
render it soluble in water, and capable of being absorbed by the
lymphatic vessels of the roots of plants.</P>
<P>If clay calcined to a certain degree, and thus united with
oxygen, possesses the power of decomposing marine salt, there
is reason to believe, when it is more slowly united with oxygen
by its exposure to the atmosphere by the spade or plough, that
it may possess the same property; and that this may have given
rise to the very contradictory reports concerning the use of sea-salt
in agriculture; as it may probably be of great advantage to
clayey soils, but perhaps not so to other soils. See Sect. XIV.
2. 8.</P>
<P>6. Another saline body, which readily unites with argilla∣ceous
earth in the fire, is salt of urine, commonly called micro∣cosmic
salt, which acts as a flux dissolving clay with consider∣able
effervescence. Kirwan's Mineralogy, Vol. I. p. 9. This
microcosmic salt consists of phosphoric acid united with an am∣monical,
or with a calcareous base; and must in the latter case
resemble the phosphat of lime, of which there are whole moun∣tains
discovered in Spain, as mentioned in No. 5. 5. of this
section; and of which many may probably be discovered in our
own country. Now as the same combinations of matter, which
are quickly formed by the heat of the chemist's furnaces, are
often performed, though more slowly, in the elaboratory of
nature; it is probable, that if this calcareous phosphorus could
be procured in this country, reduced to powder and spread on
our clay lands, that it might more than any other calcareous
matter render them friendly to vegetation, like the ashes of
burnt bones; which experiment alone can determine.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="212"/>
7. As clay is less adapted to the growth of the roots of
plants by the too great cohesion of its particles, this may be in
some degree corrected by frequently exposing it to air imprison∣ed
in its interstices, as by turning it over by the plough or spade.
Another method is by planting on it such vegetables first as are
known to grow well in clay, as beans, and as their roots are
afterwards left in the clay, they not only thus form tubes in it,
so as to render the mass less cohesive; but add to it so much
carbon, and thus rather enrich than impoverish it. Add to this
that the lower leaves of the dense foliage of these vigorous vege∣tables
are believed to give out much carbonic acid by their respi∣ration
in the shade similar to the respiration of animals; which
perpetually sinking down upon the surface of the soil is believed
to supply it with carbon; and thus also to render it more nutri∣tive
to other vegetables, which may afterwards grow upon it.</P>
<P>Lord Kaimes, who allows that clay, if it be moistened after
it has been pulverized, becomes on drying as indurated and
cohesive as before, asserts, that this does not happen, if it be
moistened with the fluid, which escapes from dunghills; which
may be owing both to the carbon, and to the fixed vegetable
alkali, which that fluid contains. And also adds, that lime
will prevent the cohesion or induration of clay, and therefore
greatly improves argillaceous soils for all the purposes of agri∣culture.</P>
<P>8. When clay abounds with vitriolic acid so as to be con∣verted
into alnm, it becomes very unfriendly to vegetation. In
this state it is believed much to counteract the process of putre∣faction
in animal bodies, as is said to have happened in some
burying grounds. This it may effect by uniting with the ammo∣nia
generated by putrefaction the moment it is formed, or by
preventing its production; as when the salt of Neville Holt
water in Leicestershire, which I suppose is alum, is mixed with
very putrid blood, as I once witnessed, the putrid fcent was
instantly destroyed, as I suppose the argillaceous earth was pre∣cipitated.</P>
<P>Where this acid or aluminous clay abounds, it is believed to
check the vegetation of trees as well as of herbaceous plants by
eroding the fine extremities of their roots, as mentioned in
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>
Sect. II. 9. which is perhaps best to be remedied in gardens by
wood-ashes or soap-suds, and in larger fields by mixing lime, or
chalk in powder, or the sweepings from roads, which are re∣paired
by limestone, with these aluminous clays. Or lastly,
where it can be procured, by mixing with them such lime as
that of Breedon in Leicestershire, which consists of equal parts
of magnesia and calcareous earth, which would thus fabricate
what has been termed Epsom salt, which is said to be friendly
to vegetation.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>VIII. MANURES BY SPONTANEOUS DECOMPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>We shall now consider more generally the decomposition of
organized matter, which vegetable and animal bodies sponta∣neously
undergo, when they cease to live. The processes of
this decomposition have commonly been divided into the vinous,
acetous, and putrefactive fermentations; which have been sup∣posed
uniformly to succeed each other. But it is more proba∣ble,
that different kinds or parts of dead organized matter may
be subject to many different kinds of chemical changes, and that
these may vary with the degrees of heat, and the quantity of
water, and of air, with which they are surrounded.</P>
<P>1. In the stomachs of animals saccharine process precedes
the vinous fermentation; which last only occurs, when the ani∣mal
power of digestion or absorption is for a time suspended.
A similar process occurs in the germination of vegetable roots,
whereby meal is converted into sugar, as in the malt-house;
and in the gradual ripening of apples and pears, after they
are plucked from the tree; but all these may be said to be
still alive; and this change of meal or of mucilage into sugar
may thus be esteemed a vegetable rather than a chemical pro∣cess.</P>
<P>The art of cookery, by exposing vegetable and animal sub∣stances
to heat, has contributed to increase the quantity of the
food of mankind by converting the acerb juices of some fruits
into sugar, as in the baking of unripe pears, and the bruising of
unripe apples; in both which situations the life of the vegetable
is destroyed, and the conversion of the harsh juice into a sweet
<PB N="208" REF="214"/>
one must be performed by a chemical process; and not by a
vegetable one only, as the germination of barley in making malt
has generally been supposed.</P>
<P>Some large round austere pears were yesterday, November
20, shewn me after having been nine hours in the oven behind
a kitchen fire covered some inches with water in a steam-pot.
On tasting them they were sweet, and soft, and appeared to
have had at least the heat of boiling water. They were replac∣ed
in the oven, and kept in it twelve hours longer; and then
became nearly as sweet as syrup or treacle; which might in
part have been occasioned by the evaporation of half the water.
From this curious circumstance there seems reason to conclude,
that in a degree of heat about that of boiling water the saccha∣rine
process may succeed; and at the same time that the process
of fermentation may be prevented from existing; which I hope
may induce some chemical philosopher to investigate by experi∣ments
this curious and important subject.</P>
<P>Some circumstances, which seem to injure the life of several
fruits, seem to forward the saccharine process of their juices.
Thus if some kinds of pears are gathered a week before they
would ripen on the tree, and are laid on a heap and covered,
their juice becomes sweet many days sooner. The taking off a
circular piece of the bark from a branch of a pear-tree causes
the fruit of that branch to ripen sooner by a fortnight, as I
have more than once observed. The wounds made in apples
by insects occasion those apples to ripen sooner; caprification,
or the piercing of figs, in the island of Malta, is said to ripen
them sooner; and I am well informed, that when bunches of
grapes in this country have acquired their expected size, that
if the stalk of each bunch be cut half through, they will sooner
ripen.</P>
<P>The germinating barley in the malt-house I believe acquire
not half its sweetness, till the life of the seed is destroyed; and
the saccharine process then continued or advanced by the heat
in drying it; though I have lately been informed that some
grains of malt will vegetate after having been dried in the usual
manner, which however may have been owing to their not hav¦ing
been previously suffered perfectly to germinate. Thus in
<PB N="209" REF="215"/>
animal digestion the sugar produced in the stomach is absorbed
by the lacteals, as fast as it is made; otherwise it ferments and
produces flatulency; so in the germination of barley in the malt-house
so long as the new plant lives, the sugar I suppose is ab∣sorbed,
as fast as it is made; but that which we use in making
beer is the sugar produced by a chemical process after the death
of the young plant, or which is made more expeditiously than
the plant can absorb it.</P>
<P>It is probable this saccharine process, which obtains in new
hay-stacks too hastily; and which by immediately running into
fermentation produces so much heat as to set them on fire. The
greatest part of the grain, or seeds, or roots, used in the dis∣tilleries,
as wheat, canary seed, potatoes, are not I believe
previously subjected to germination; but are in part by a che∣mical
process converted into sugar, and immediately, subjected
to vinous fermentation. And it is probable, a process may
sometime be discovered of producing sugar from starch or meal;
and of separating it from them for domestic purposes by alcohol;
which dissolves sugar but not mucilage; or by other means.</P>
<P>This then may be termed the saccharine fermentation, and
may exist I suppose beneath or upon the earth in the beginning
of some spontaneous vegetable decompositions, previous to the
vinous fermentation; and may supply thus a very nutritive ma∣terial
to vegetation; similar to that which the embryon plants in
the seeds of many fruit-trees acquire from their fruits; and to
that, which the embryons in many farinaceous seeds acquire
from the spontaneous change of the meal in their cotyledons;
though perhaps in less quantity and purity.</P>
<P>2. A secondary process to this I suppose to be the vinous
fermentation, in which much carbon becomes united to oxygen;
and probably at the very instant of their combination, while
they are yet in the form of a liquid, and not of a gas, they be∣come
absorbed by the roots of plants. The heat, which is
perceived in the hotbeds, which are used for the growth of
cucumbers and melona, is produced by this union of oxygen and
carbon, or by the generation of some other acids, as of phos∣phorus,
or nitre.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="216"/>
That this heat is owing to the atmospheric air combining with
some inflammable base, and producing acidity of some kind,
appears from the following experiment. A few years ago, a
gardener told me that a hot-bed, which he had made of tan∣ner's
bark with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome horse dung and straw, was become too cold
for the growth of his pots of cucumbers. He was desired simply
to turn over the bed, and shake every part of it in the air with
his fork, as he lightly replaced it. This was complied with,
and in a few days I observed by touching a stick, which had
for some hours been inserted into it, that it had acquired the
usual heat of a hot-bed.</P>
<P>This addition of heat was doubtless acquired from the air,
which was recently included in the interstices of the bed by its
being turned over, broken into small pieces, and exposed to the
atmosphere; whence new acids seem to have been generated,
and carbon, and perhaps phosphorus and nitrogen, rendered
soluble in water. Great heat is produced from the union of
oxygen with those bases of acidity, which in large stacks of
new hay is often known to excite real combustion; the violent
fermentation of which may be partly owing to the sugar which
is deposited in the joints of grass before the seeds are ripe for
their nourishment, and partly to a chemical production of sugar,
as above described.</P>
<P>3. In the putrefactive process carbon is not only converted
into carbonic acid, as above related; but there appears to be a
decomposition of water, as is known by the smell of hydroge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and it is probable, this inflammable body may unite with car∣bon,
as in hydrocarbonate gas, and thus render them both so∣luble
in water, and absorbable by the vessels of vegetable roots,
without their passing into an acid or gasseous form, and may
much contribute to the nutriment of vegetables.</P>
<P>4. There also appears at the end of the putrefactive proc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s
to be a junction of azote with oxygen producing the acid of
nitre, which probably may contribute much to promote vegeta∣tion.
This appears from the mode of procuring that acid in
France and Prussia, and which might be successfully practised
under every shed in our own farm-yards; as it consists i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a
due mixture of vegetable and animal recrements with soil, fre∣quently
<PB N="211" REF="217"/>
turned over to expose it to the air, while it is defended
by a shed from the sunshine and rain; which is thus at the same
time adapted to produce the quickest vegetation, and to gene∣rate
the nitrous acid.</P>
<P>The oxygen, which composes nitrous acid, is believed to
adhere more weakly to its base the azote, than in the composi∣tion
of other acids. On this account it so readily explodes by
its junction with carbon in a given degree of heat. This loose
adherence of the oxygen in nitrous acid, like that of hyper-oxy∣genated
marine acid, and of the oxygen in the ore of manganese,
and of some other metallic oxydes, may adapt them to promote
vegetation by their more readily parting with this material so
essential in the composition of plants.</P>
<P>5. From the above observations it appears, that when the
soil is turned over by the spade or plough, and thus acquires
atmospheric air in its interstices, and in consequence becomes
warm by the production of new acids, that the seeds or plants
should be inserted as soon as convenient, for the purpose of
their receiving the most salutary effect of those operations.
Nor should this be observed only in black garden mould, or
well manured glebes, where carbon or phosphorus may be sup∣posed
to abound, and a proper disposition for the production of
the nitrous acid, but in those clays also which are pure enough
for the brick-kiln or the pottery.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>IX. MANURES BY CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>The use of fire and water contributes to increase the nourish∣ment
of mankind by rendering many vegetable materials inno∣cuous,
and others digestable in the animal stomach; and seems
particularly efficacious in promoting the saccharine process, and
in producing mucilage from gristles, horn, hair, and perhaps
even from bones by means of Papin's digester. Whether this
art could be advantageously used for the purpose of rendering
manures capable of being absorbed by vegetable roots in a state
of less decomposition, than by the slow process of putrefaction,
is a question of curiosity and utility.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="218"/>
Sugar and mucilage are certainly absorbed by vegetables
without their being resolved into the elements, from which they
were composed; as appears in the sap-juice which flows from
the wounds of birch and maple trees in the vernal months;
which I am informed will pass into fermentation and produce
wine; a process which some modern chemist affirms cannot be
effected by sugar alone without the addition of mucilage. The
absorption of mucilage seems to occur in the germination of
many seeds, as of barley; a part of the meal of the cotyledon is
evidently converted into sugar, but another part of it is probably
absorbed in the form of mucilage; some of which oozes on
breaking the plumula; and in the growth of those seeds, which
contain oil, as in almond, hemp, rape, and line-seed, it is pro∣bable,
a part of the undecomposed oil may be absorbed by the
umbilical vessels of the embryons in those seeds.</P>
<P>It hence seems credible, that by the use of heat and water
the art of cookery might furnish mucilage, sugar, and oil, from
vegetable or animal materials; which might be converted into
sap-juice or chyle, without their being previously reduced into
their elements; and might thus facilitate the more luxuriant
growth of plants, as they contribute more to fatten animals,
than materials of less combination.</P>
<P>2. To this might be added, that the putrefactive process may
be forwarded by heat in some materials by destroying the life of
the material; as in roasting apples and pears, and in killing the
roots of potatoes, or the seeds of corn, Thus Mr. D—,
a friend of mine, had twenty strikes of potatoes, which he
wished to dry on a malt-kiln, hoping to render them more like
the meal of wheat, and better to preserve them during the sum∣mer-months.
Whether they were sufficiently dried he did not
attend to; but they were carried into a granary, and laid on
heaps; and in a week or two became so putrid, that the smell
was insufferable, his swine refused to eat them, and he was
obliged to add them to the manure of the dunghill.</P>
<P>That potatoes, which have undergone a certain degree of heat,
contribute more to fatten all kinds of animals, arises from the
acrimony of their rinds being destroyed, and from their austere
juices being converted into mucilage, and perhaps a part of their
<PB N="213" REF="219"/>
mucilage into starch, and are hence ready for the saccharine and
oily processes of animal digestion. A very convenient method
of exposing them to steam is described in a late ingenious publi∣cation
of the Agricultural Society. A small boiler is set in
brick work under a shed, so that the flame of wood or coal may
pass spirally round it. It should be covered with a double lid
of tin or wood to prevent much heat from escaping; and may
have a sand-joint to keep the steam in, or a little moist clay, or
even a wet flannel put circularly round the cover may answer
this purpose.</P>
<P>Near this furnace is to be fixed a large barrel on one of its
ends, with a cover on the other end; which may be occasionally
opened to admit potatoes, and closed again so as to confine the
steam, which is to be derived into it from the boiler by a double
pipe one within the other, of tin or wood, about two inches
in diameter. By these means a large quantity of potatoes may
be rendered much more nutritive to animals, and I suppose to
vegetables (if they were used as manure), as they may thus
probably be absorbed by their lacteals or lymphatics without
being so much decomposed as by the putrefactive process; and
thus produce nutriment in less time, and by less labour of di∣gestion.</P>
<P>If the steam could be made hotter than boiling water, which
possibly may in the vessel above described, if the water in it
rises but a few inches, and the steam after it is produced; is
heated above 212 degrees by the sides of the boiler above the
water, round which the flame plays spirally, the steam thus
made hotter might probably render the potatoes more mucila∣ginous
or more starchy.</P>
<P>3. A still more effectual method of dissolving hard vegetable
and animal substances, and rendering them nutritive, might be
by digesting them for some time in water raised to a much greater
heat than that of boiling. This is to be done in a close vessel,
called Papin's digester; in which it is said, that the confined
water may be made red hot; and will then dissolve hair, horns,
hoofs, bones, tortoise-shell, and all animal, and perhaps many
vegetable matters; which might thus facilitate their decompo∣sition
<PB N="214" REF="220"/>
for the purposes of manures, or for the nutriment of many
animals; and might even contribute to the food of mankind in
times of scarcity. This vessel should be made of iron, and
should have an oval opening at top, with an oval lid of iron
larger than the aperture. This lid should be slipped in end∣ways,
when the vessel is filled, and then turned, and raised by
a screw above it into contact with the under edges of the aper∣ture.
There should also be a small tube or hole covered with
a weighted valve to prevent the danger of bursting the digester.</P>
<P>4. Other materials might be rendered more easily digestible,
and thence more nutritive to animals, and perhaps to plants, by
mechanic trituration as well as by cookery; if the labour and
expence were not too great; as the grinding of grasses, straws,
and farinaceous seeds into powder between mill-stones; which
have been called the artificial teeth of society. It is probable,
that some soft kinds of wood ground into powder, and espe∣cially
when they have undergone a kind of fermentation, and
become of looser texture, or boiled to destroy their acrimony,
might be rendered useful food for swine or horses, and even for
mankind in times of famine.</P>
<P>Nor is it improbable, that hay, which has been kept in stacks,
so as to undergo the saccharine process, may be so managed by
grinding and by fermentation with yeast like bread, as to serve
in part for the sustenance of mankind in times of great scarcity.
Dr. Priestley gave to a cow for some time a strong infusion of
hay in large quantity for her drink, and found, that she pro∣duced
during this treatment above double the quantity of milk.
Hence if bread cannot be made from ground hay, there is great
reason to suspect that a nutritive beverage may be thus prepared
either in its saccharine state, or fermented into a kind of beer.</P>
<P>It may be here observed, that it is believed by some, that
feeding horses with ground corn, as with the flour of beans or
oats, does not strengthen them nearly so much as by giving them
the same quantity of oats or beans whole. Parkinson, Exper.
Farmer, Vol. I. p. 227. It is asserted also that soup, with the
flesh-meat boiled down into a fluid mass, will give much less
strength to a man, than he would acquire by eating the solid meat,
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>
of which the soup was made. The reason of both these seems
to arise from the saliva being well mixed with the masticated
food, and in greater quantity; which therefore becomes more
animalized aliment, than that dissolved in water alone, and is
more easily converted into nutriment.</P>
<P>In times of great scarcity there are other vegetables, which
though not in common use, would most probably afford whole∣some
nourishment, either by boiling them, or drying and grind∣ing
them, or by both those processes in succession. Of these are
perhaps the tops and the bark of all those vegetables which are
armed with thorns or prickles, as gooseberry-trees, holly, gorse,
and perhaps hawthorn. The inner bark of the elm-tree makes
a kind of gruel. And the roots of fern, and probably very
many other roots, as of grass and of clover, taken up in winter,
might yield nourishment either by boiling or baking, and sepa∣rating
the fibres from the pulp by beating them; or by getting
only the starch from those which possess an acrid mucilage, as
the white briony.</P>
<P>The grinding of bones to powder has already been applied to
agriculture, and the chopping of woollen rags; and I suppose
the trituration of alabaster, and of chalk, and of soft bricks,
and probably of iron ochres, manganese, and calamy, might
well repay the labour; after a few experiments had been insti∣tuted
to determine the quantity, which should be strewed on
different soils.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>X. MANURES BY INSECT PROPAGATION.</HEAD>
<P>1. That the continual growth and decay of animal and vege∣table
nature increases the quantity of such matter, as is fit for
the reproduction of organized bodies, is evinced by the increas∣ing
fertility of cultivated countries; since even in these a great
quantity of the annual recrements of decomposed animals and
vegetables are washed by rains from the soil, and carried down
the rivers into the ocean; and in many situations of soil in
Africa and America, which have been but lately cultivated,
there exists a wonderful fertility from the aggregate remains of
vegetable and animal bodies; which have for uncounted ages
<PB N="216" REF="222"/>
arisen and perished there; and which have either left morasses,
where they could not part with their superabundant water; or
a fertile earth, such as in our gardens and church-yards, where
the declination of the ground was more favourable.</P>
<P>Some countries on the contrary once highly cultivated and
very populous are in process of time become deserts of sand;
as many parts of Syria, and the districts about Palmira, and
Balbec. This has probably been owing to the want of the ne∣cessary
moisture in those warm and sandy regions; which was
formerly supplied by artificial derivations of water; but which
ceased, after their inhabitants were destroyed by war and ty∣ranny;
and secondly, to the rapid streams occasionally poured
over them by the monsoon floods; similar to those which im∣poverish
Abyssinia and Nubia, while they fertilize the flat and
showerless provinces of Egypt.</P>
<P>We might add, that all calcareous strata are now believed to
have been produced by shells deposited by aquatic animals in the
early ages of the world; and that the materials, which constitute
the strata above them, have afterwards been formed by the re∣crements
of terrestrial animal and vegetable bodies. Whence it
may be concluded, that vegetables and animals during their
growth increase the quantity of matter fit for the more nutritive
food of organized bodies, or of that which is less decompound∣ed;
while they must at the same time occasionally form or ela∣borate
a part of the materials, of which they consist, from the
simple elements of hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus,
sulphur, and oxygen; into which modern chemistry has resolv∣ed
them by analysis.</P>
<P>And lastly, that vegetables can acquire nutrition from water
and air alone with the carbonic acid, which floats in them, ap∣pears
by the experiments of those philosophers, who have nicely
enclosed the roots of some plants in pots, and moistened them
with distilled water; and from hence we learn an essential dis∣tinction
between vegetable and animal nature; the former can
elaborate the two universal elements of water and air into nutri∣tive
juices, whereas the latter is necessitated to seek more com∣pound
nutriment, and to live upon the vegetables, which have
produced it.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="223"/>
2. One method therefore of increasing manures may be by
repeatedly propagating and destroying vegetable crops; as by
raising those of quick growth, and ploughing them again into
the soild uring their saccharine and mucilaginous state, before
they ripen their seeds; as of vetches, and buck-wheat; vicia
and polygonum; and thus producing a succession of crops by
the partial decomposition of the preceding ones. And it is
probable that this process might be much improved by strewing
lime over the recent vegetables, at the time of ploughing them
in, as is shewn in No. 6. 5. of this Section.</P>
<P>3. Another mode by which vegetable matter may be decom∣posed
in the summer months, and at the same time the quantity
of manure increased, is by the depredation of insects, as is seen in
wood, which is so far decomposing as to become tender, and
is then consumed by various kinds of insects, whether it be bu∣ried
beneath the soil, or exposed to the air. And I suspect, that
the excrement and the bodies of such insects would supply more
nutriment to vegetable roots, than if the vegetable recrements
were left to their spontaneous or chemical dissolution; as I
suppose the bitter excrementitious powder in a filbert, and the
well fed maggot, before it erodes its way out, would fertilize
more barren soil than an emulsion of the kernel.</P>
<P>An ingenious observer of nature conveyed water on a dung∣hill
in the summer months in such quantity, as to make a kind
of semi-fluid chaos, for the purpose of animating the whole
mass. It became full of insects, and was used in the autumn
as manure, and he believed with much greater powers, than it
would have otherwise possessed.</P>
<P>Hence in the summer months a manure-heap may be advan∣tageously
supplied with water for the purpose of encouraging the
propagation and nourishment of myriads of insects; but in the
winter season it should not be exposed to much moisture: or
that which drains from it should be derived spontaneously on
lower grounds, or conveyed to higher ones by pumps or water
carts; as it probably consists of a solution of carbon by means of
vegetable alkali; or of a mixture of it in water by mucilage;
and is thought to fertilize the ground more than the other
parts of the manure heap. In the transactions of some provin∣cial
<PB N="218" REF="224"/>
Society there is an account of much fixed vegetable alkali
having been obtained from the evaporation of the water, which
oozed from dunghills; and Mr. Rouelle has observed, that
fixed alkali dissolves a considerable quantity of charcoal by fu∣sion.
Fourcroy's Elem. of Chemist. Vol. IV. p. 125.</P>
<P>4. Another great source of insect-manure may be obtained
from the myriads of small fish, by those who live near the ocean;
which by mixing them with soil so as to make what it termed
a compost, will much add to the fertility of the land, on which
it is afterwards spread, more so perhaps than any other material
except the flesh of land-animals. In china it is said that the
spawn of fish in the proper season is brought to market, and
purchased for the purpose of peopling the floods on their rice
grounds with fish, part of which becomes large enough to be
fried and eaten by the land cultivator; and the rest serves the
purpose of fertilizing the soil, when the floods are drawn off,
by their death and consequent decomposition.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>XI. PRESERVATION OF MANURES.</HEAD>
<P>1. The fertility of all countries depends on the saving and
using those kinds of matter, which are fit for the reproduction
of organized bodies. There is a proverb in China, that for
this purpose a wise man saves even the parings of his nails, and
the clippings of his hair.</P>
<P>One great waste of manure in this country, and in most
others, is from the frequent rains washing down the diffusible
and soluble parts of the soil into the muddy rivers; so that every
flood from sudden showers carries into the sea many thousand
pounds worth of the matter of fertility; and thus diminishes so
much the food of terrestrial animals, however it may add to the
sustenance of marine ones. The Delta of Egypt, and a district
in South America near the foot of the Andes mentioned by
Ulloa, are said by the situation of the surrounding country to
be free from rain, though they have frequent dews; and to this
circumstance they may in part owe their increasing fertility.</P>
<P>In this country the snow-floods, which occur after a conti∣nued
frost, are less injurious than those from rains; as the
<PB N="219" REF="225"/>
streams of water from the upper surface of the dissolving ice
flows over the under surface of it not yet dissolved; and the soil
is not agitated as in rain by the percussion of the descending
drops; insomuch that in snow-floods the rivers are scarcely
muddy; whence these floods may be readily distinguished from
land-floods by the eye, and are much less injurious.</P>
<P>Great attention should therefore be shewn to the preventing
small showers from washing away the soluble parts of good soil.
For this purpose all hills should be ploughed horizontally, and
not in ascending and descending furrows. Descending plains
of grass-ground might also be laid with horizontal ridges and
depressions; by which management showers will lie a few hours
in the horizontal furrows or depressions, and either exhale or
soak into the ground; and in very wet seasons these may easily
by the spade be opened into each other, if the water is found
to lie too long upon them, so as to produce too much cold by
its evaporation, or too great softness by its absorption into the
soil.</P>
<P>2. Secondly, The manures of towns and cities, which are all
now left buried in deep wells, or carried away by soughs into
the rivers, should be removed by a police, which is said to
exist in China; and carried out of towns at stated intervals of
time for the purposes of agriculture; which might be performed
in the night, as is done in Edinburgh; or by means of large
basons or reservoirs at the extremities of the common shores, or
soughs for the reception of the manure, before it is washed into
rivers. See Embassy to China by sir G. Staunton, Vol. III.
p. 308, 8vo. edit.</P>
<P>It has been believed by some writers in the American Medi∣cal
Repository, that the pestilential fever, which has of late in∣fested
that country, was in part produced or propagated by the
filth of the streets of New York. Dr. S. L. Mitchill adds to his
chemical remarks on manures, “it must be welcome intelli∣gence,
that the collected mass of nuisance, which we are now
with such happy success engaged in removing from the city of
New York, is convertible by the powers of vegetation from
poison to wholesome articles of food; and thus the purity and
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>
healthiness of the towns may contribute to the thriftiness and
wealth of the surrounding country. Medical Journal, No. I.</P>
<P>3. Thirdly, there should be no burial places in churches or
in church-yards, where the monuments of departed sinners
shoulder God's altar, pollute his holy places with dead men's
bones, and produce by putrid exhalations contagious diseases
among those who frequent his worship. But proper burial
grounds should be consecrated out of towns, and divided into
two compartments, the earth from one of which, saturated with
animal decomposition, should be taken away once in ten or
twenty years, for the purposes of agriculture; and sand or clay,
or less fertile soil, brought into its place.</P>
<P>A great rise of the soil, from the remains of the bodies en∣tombed
in it, is seen round the churches of almost all populous
towns; so as to have rendered it necessary to descend by seve∣ral
steps into those churches, which were originally built so as
to require steps to ascend into them; as may frequently be seen
by the base of the architecture. Nor would the removal of this
earth, if the few bones, which might be found, were again bu∣ried
for a further decomposition, be likely to shock the relations
of the deceased; as the superstition concerning the earth, from
which we rose, and into which we return, has gradually vanish∣ed
before the light of reason; as occured about thirty years ago
in removing much rich earth from the close of the cathedral at
Lichfield, and more lately in changing a burying ground at
Shrewsbury; both which were executed without superstitious
terror, or popular commotion.</P>
<P>4. Fourthly, a great waste of the materials of fertility occurs
in all countries, and cannot easily be avoided, in the consump∣tion
by fire of so much wood instead of coal. Whence the
mucilage, and other nutritious juices, which exist in the fire∣wood,
are decomposed into their elements; and the carbon
united with the oxygen is diffused in the atmosphere, and in
part carried by the winds into the surrounding ocean; instead of
the manures occasioned by the slow decomposition of it upon or
beneath the soil, or by the depredation of insects; which might
supply less decomposed nutriment to the absorbent roots of
plants.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="227"/>
This may be more easy to conceive, if we compare the little
vegetable nutriment, which could be derived from the small
quantity of ashes left from a cart-load of burnt-straw, with that
which would arise from the same quantity of straw mixed with
some animal recrements, and made into a manure heap. A
still greater diminution of useful manure would be made by burn∣ing
shavings or raspings of horn, or woollen rags, or hair, or
flesh; as a nutritive mucilage would be thus decomposed into its
elements, which might otherwise have been gradually dissolved
beneath the soil, and absorbed by the roots of vegetables nearly
in an unaltered state; as jellies and mucilage are known to be
drank up by the lacteals of animals; and, when drank in too
great abundance, to appear almost unchanged in their urine.</P>
<P>It must hence appear, that the numerous fires of a great city,
if supplied with wood instead of coals, as in Paris, must very
much impoverish a great part of the country which supplies it;
not only in the necessity of using large tracts of land for the
growth of fire-wood, but also because so small a part of it re∣turns
as manure. There is a provident adage of general bene∣volence,
“Burn nothing which any animal will eat; that is,
Burn nothing which may nourish animals by its digestion in
their stomachs.” May not the same benevolent idea be ex∣tended
to the vegetable world, and say, “Burn nothing which
may nourish vegetables by its slow decomposition beneath the
soil, which constitutes their stomachs.”</P>
<P>5. It may be a matter of use as well as of curiosity to ascer∣tain
the situations and circumstances most favourable for pro∣moting
the spontaneous decomposition of vegetable substances;
which may consist perhaps in the due quantity of air, water, and
heat, with a sufficient proportion of animal substances, and
finally an admixture of lime toward the end of the process.</P>
<P>1. In a cellar covered with an arch of bricks, and closed with
a very strong door, I once observed, that a deal shelf two
inches in thickness was decayed, so as to fall down with some
wine bottles on it, in about four years. This sudden decay I
believed to have been owing to the unchanging moisture of the
board, and at the same time to its exposure to unchanged air with∣out
the power of much exhalation; by which a slow fermentation
<PB N="222" REF="228"/>
was induced, and a consequent slow putrefaction, unchecked
by the extremes either of heat or cold.</P>
<P>For the same reason I suppose the wooden supporters of
bridges decay first just above the surface of the water; and
pieces of timber buried but a few inches under ground, which
are there exposed to the influence both of water and air, go
quicker into fermentation, and consequent putrefaction, than
those pieces of timber, which are many feet buried beneath the
soil, or immersed deep in water; which in that situation con∣tinue
unchanged for ages. The same seems to occur in the
vinous fermentation, which is instantly checked, if not totally
stopped, by bunging the barrel, or corking the bottle, which
contains it, and thus precluding the access of atmospheric
air.</P>
<P>2. From hence it may be concluded, first, that the vegetable
and animal substances, which we wish soon to become decom∣posed
by the fermentative and putrefactive processes, should be
exposed to an uniform moisture, though not covered deep with
water; as is generally practised in the first part of the prepara∣tion
of hemp or flax, which is designed to dissolve the mucilage,
and the cellular membrane of those vegetables, without injuring
the ligneous fibres. And that they should be so far accumulat∣ed
as not too much to exhale; yet not to lie in such large heaps,
as entirely to preclude the access of air from the interior parts
of them.</P>
<P>The manures of great farms should therefore be occasionally
removed from the fold-yards, or large reservoirs of it, and laid
in small heaps not only to increase its surface exposed to the
external atmosphere, for the purpose of exciting greater fermen∣tation,
which is a slow combustion; but also that air may be
imprisoned in the interstices of these manure-heaps, as men∣tioned
in No. 8. 2. of this section. It should then be used on
or in the soil, as it afterwards loses much of its nutritive quali∣ties
by evaporation, or sinking into the ground, or draining,
away.</P>
<P>3. A due degree of heat is necessary for the commencement
of fermentation and putrefaction, as both vegetable and animal
materials, as fruit or flesh, may be preserved for years if kept in
<PB N="223" REF="229"/>
an ice-house below the freezing point of 32. And also, I am
told, if they could be kept in an uniform degree of heat above
the boiling point of 212. After the commencement of either
of these processes a quantity of heat is evolved from the com∣bination
of the oxygen and carbon, which contributes to for∣ward
the processes by promoting the union of the next particles
of oxygen and carbon; which may thence be compared to a
slow combustion, or to a gradual explosion of gunpowder.</P>
<P>This heat therefore should be managed with some address, as
a great quantity of it would calcine or evaporate too much of
the materials, and leave the remainder a less profitable mass;
as happens, I am informed, to some parts of those heaps of
manure, which are used in the manufactory of white lead;
while on the contrary, when the heat is too small, as in severe
frost, these processes of decomposition will not commence, or may
be stopped in their progress. In the former case, where the heat
is too great, it may be checked by covering the whole manure-heap
with soil and turf, and thus preventing the access of air.
And when the heat is too small, as in old hot beds, it may be
renewed or promoted by turning the heap over with the spade,
and thus confining a new quantity of air in its interstices. On
these accounts it appears, that in the vernal and autumnal monsht
these processes must succeed better than in the winter or the sum∣mer
ones.</P>
<P>4. Toward the end of the putrefactive process the materials
should be repeatedly turned over with the spade, not only for
the purpose of simply exposing their interior parts to the atmos∣phere,
but also of including air in the interstices; as the union
of carbon with oxygen, and probably of azote with hydrogen,
seems thus to be occasioned; by which the three last of these
elements may change from a gasseous state into a fluid one, and
thus become absorbed by vegetable roots.</P>
<P>Lastly, I conclude that in general the manure heap before
stables, or in the fold-yard, should be placed on a gently rising
eminence, with a bason beneath it, that the superfluous water,
which would otherwise prevent the fermentation of the straw,
may drain off and be there received; and that into this bason, as
often as a fluid appears in it, some earth, or weeds, or leaves, or
<PB N="224" REF="230"/>
saw-dust, or other vegetable or animal recrements should be
thrown; the fermentation and putrefaction of which will be thus
forwarded, and the carbonic draining from the manure-heap will
not be lost.</P>
<P>5. The admixture of lime with this carbonic soil is found by
daily experience to produce the most fertile compositions for the
growth of vegetables, and for the production of nitre. The
great use of nitrous acid in vegetation has long been acknow∣ledged,
and that of hyper-oxygenated marine acid appears pro∣bable
from recent experiments; and would seem to be occasioned
by the more loose adhesion of the oxygen in those acids to their
respective bases; which may therefore in its fluid state be more
readily absorbed by vegetable roots. One use therefore of the
admixture of lime in such a compost of soil and manure is to
arrest the nitrous acid, as it is formed, and by making a calca∣reous
nitre, prevent its exhalation, or its easy elutriation from
the other materials.</P>
<P>6. A principal circumstance for the quicker and more perfect
decomposition of vegetable recrements is a due quantity of ani∣mal
matter, and their being properly mixed together; as ap∣pears
from the early experiments of sir John Pringle and Mac∣bride,
and by daily experience. There is nevertheless great
neglect in this respect in all those farm-yards, where the swine
hare their food in fixed stone-troughs, from which the refuse is
occasionally washed or swept. Whereas if wooden moveable
swine-troughs were always placed on the summit of the heaps of
dry straw, the quantity of their swill, consisting of broth, whey,
and other vegetable and animal matter, which these animals
waste in their contention for it, would generate early putrefac∣tive
processes; besides their mixing the substances well together
with their feet, and adding to it their urine and ordure.</P>
<P>Besides this inattention to the manure-heap in many houses
the washings of boilers, and milk-pans, and dishes, as well as the
soap-suds, which are all of them manures of the most productive
kind, are thrown into the common sewer, instead of being de∣rived
or carried to the garden or the straw-yard.</P>
<P>7. Another inattention to the production of manures concerns
the heaps of common weeds, and of dock-roots, and of cab∣bage-stalks,
<PB N="225" REF="231"/>
and the roots of twitch-grass; which improvident
farmers and gardeners frequently throw into the high roads, or
consume with fire; and which if laid on heaps, and occasion∣ally
turned over, and covered with soil, will quickly die, and
pass into speedy fermentation from the sugar and mucilage,
which they contain; and if to these a portion of lime be added,
I am informed by one who made the experiment, that the whole
was decomposed in a short time, and manure of the best kind
was the product.</P>
<P>The same should be practised with the leaves which fall in au∣tumn
on grass land, especially from those orchards, or hedges,
or from gooseberry-trees, which have been infested with cater∣pillars;
since I am told the eggs of a future race of these insects
are frequently deposited on the leaves, and hatched on or be∣neath
the soil in the ensuing spring. These therefore should be
removed from the roots of such trees, and converted into ma∣nure
by the process above mentioned.</P>
<P>Along with the weeds and leaves above mentioned I should
strongly recommend to the industrious agricultor to collect the
water-plants which grow in great abundance in lakes and rivers,
for the purpose of manure; which at present are employed to no
advantage. These might be moved twice a year, as it is proba∣ble
that these vegetables in their younger state, as the typha, or
cat's-tail; the butomus, or flowering rush; nymphaea and alisma,
as well as many other aquatic plants, would give better manure,
or sooner become sufficiently decomposed, during their more sac∣charine
and mucilaginous state, than when they have acquired
more fibrous leaves, and more woody stems.</P>
<P>By thus exposing the roots and tops of weeds to fermentation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their seeds would also be destroyed as well as the vegetative
power of their roots; and on this account the hay-seeds col∣lected
from stacks which have fermented too violently, so as to
become black by this slow combustion, are frequently so much
injured as not to vegetate, to the great disappointment of the
sower, a circumstance which also sometimes occurs in stacks of
wheat, as mentioned in Sect. XVI. 7. 1.</P>
<P>8. Lastly, peat, so well understood and so strongly recom∣mended
by Lord Dundonald, is too much neglected in agricul∣ture.
<PB N="226" REF="232"/>
The peat or turf, which constitutes the solid parts of
morasses, as it consists of vegetable fibres in different states of
decomposition, may be laid on clayey or sandy soils with the
greatest advantage; and ought to be considered as an inestimable
treasure to the farms in its vicinity. Or it may previously be
laid on heaps, and thus mixed with air and drained from water
for further decomposition, with or without the addition of lime.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>XII. APPLICATION OF MANURES.</HEAD>
<P>Two questions of importance here present themselves. As
the spontaneous or chemical changes of manure-heaps in farmyards
gradually progrede from the saccharine and mucilaginous
commencement through a great variety of other fermentations;
which can only be named from the principal material, which
each of there produces, as carbonic acid, alcohol, vinegar, vo∣latile
alkali, hydrogen, nitrous acid, and finally carbonic earth.
At what era or stage of this decomposition of vegetable and ani∣mal
substances can they be most advantageously applied to the
purposes of agriculture? and secondly, at what time of the year?</P>
<P>1. In respect is the era of the progress of the decomposition
in manure-heaps, in which they may be most advantageously ap∣plied
in agriculture, the particular purpose of that application
must be attended to. Where they are designed to be spread on
the surface of grass lands, as a top-dressing, the accumulations of
vegetable and animal recrements should be permitted to go
through the various spontaneous processes of decomposition,
which begin with the saccharine and mucilaginous state, and end
with the production of carbonic earth, with many kinds of inter∣mediate
fermentations, if they may be so called, which accom∣pany
or succeed each other, and which I believe to be more in
number than have had names applied to them.</P>
<P>But that less of the fertilizing materials, whether of soluble
solids, or of fluids, or of gasses, may be lost in these series of
fermentations; it is a very advantageous management to cover
them with soil, when the first fermentation is advanced, as is
known by the production of considerable heat; or when the
putrefactive one has commenced, which is known by the smell
<PB N="227" REF="233"/>
of volatile alkali, or of hydrogen. By this method the too
great rapidity of these fermentations is checked, and the fluid
part of the manure is retained by the addition of the soil below,
and the gasseous part by that above; and if to this be after∣wards
added a proportion of lime, which by uniting with the
nitrous acid may retain it from exhalation or from alluviation,
every thing is preserved that art can accomplish.</P>
<P>Where manure-heaps are to be ploughed into clayey soils,
which are liable to become too solid and impenetrable to the root-fibres
of seeds, as of wheat; or where knobby or bulbous roots
are to be inserted to produce other knobs or bulbs beneath the
soil, as potatoes; it is probably more advantageous to bury
the manure in a less decomposed state, while some of the
straw retains its form; as such parts by their flower decompo∣sition
will longer prevent the superincumbent soil from becoming
too solid; and though they will in this situation require some
time before they will be perfectly decomposed, and reduced to
the black carbonic earth; yet they will in the end totally decay,
and give the same quantity of nutriment to the roots, though it
may be more gradually applied.</P>
<P>2. In respect to the time of year those manures, which are to
be ploughed or dug into the ground, should be used immediately
before sowing the seeds or setting the roots, which they are
designed to nurture; because the atmospheric air, which is bu∣ried
along with the manure in the interstices of the earth, and
which for many weeks, or even months, renders the soil loose,
and easily impressed by the foot on walking on it, gradually
evolves by its union with carbon a genial heat very friendly to
vegetation in this climate, as well as the immediate production of
much fluid carbonic acid, and probably of a fluid mixture of ni∣trogen
with hydrogen, which are believed to supply much nu∣triment
to plants.</P>
<P>But those manures which are designed to be spread on the sur∣face
of grass-land, which is called the top-dressing, are best ap∣plied,
I suspect in the early spring; and should be dispersed over
the soil almost in a state of powder, or in lumps of very loose
cohesion; as at this time the vernal showers wash them into the
soil; and they are applied to the roots of the grass, before their
<PB N="228" REF="234"/>
essential parts are diminished by winter rains or by summer exha∣lation.
There are some in Derbyshire, who spread manure even
on the meadows, which are annually overflowed by the Trent or
Derwent, at the end of summer, or as soon as the grass is
mowed and removed; which appears to be an improvident ma∣nagement,
since the aftermath, or autumnal grass, is thus ren∣dered
unpalatable to the cattle; and the winter rains, or the
vernal floods, which generally occur with the return of the
south-west winds, after the season of frost ceases, must wash
away a great part of it.</P>
<P>In respect to the most economical manner of using manures in
agriculture Mr. Parkinson asserts, that one great advantage of
the drill husbandry consists in putting the manure into drills,
which he directs to be made at two feet distance from each other.
He sows wheat, beans, peas, cabbages, on this manure, and
affirms, that four loads of manure on an acre in this kind of hus∣bandry
is equal to sixteen loads in the usual way of spreading it
over the whole of the field. Experienced Farmer, Vol. I.
p. 32.</P>
<P>3. A third question here presents itself, if the recrements of
vegetable and animal bodies buried a few inches beneath the soil
undergo the same decomposition, as when laid on heaps in farm-yards.
And though this is accomplished more slowly, yet it is
attended with less loss of carbonic acid, and of volatile alkali,
and of hyrogen, and of the fluid matter of heat; all which are
emitted in great quantity during the rapid fermentations of large
heaps of manure, and are wasted in the atmosphere, or on un∣prolific
ground; would it not in general be more economical to
bury such vegetable and animal matters beneath the soil without
a previous fermentation and putrefaction?</P>
<P>In answer to this it must be observed, that in some cases the
use of recent vegetables ploughed into the earth is found of ad∣vantage,
as in sandy soils buck-wheat, or vetches, are sown,
and the crop ploughed in, before it ripens its seeds. In this
circumstance the recent crop is buried in its saccharine and mu∣cilaginous
state, which must undergo indeed a slower fermenta∣tion,
without being mixed with animal substances, but no part
of the organic matter, nor of the fluid heat, is lost to the pur∣poses
of new organization.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="235"/>
So in the cultivation of clayey lands, whose tenacity is too
great; or where knobby roots, as potatoes, are to be inserted
for the production of other knobby roots beneath the soil; long
muck, as it is called, or such which is only so far decomposed as
to dissolve the mucilage or more tender vessels or membranes,
but in which the form of the fibrous or ligneous parts of the
straw remains, is recommended above; and may in these situa∣tions
perhaps be ploughed into the ground even in their most
early state, when rejected from the stable or cowhouse, before
the commencement of their spontaneous dissolution.</P>
<P>So also in gardens, which are already fertile, and do not
want the immediate assistance of mature manure, it may be more
economical to bury the weeds, as the ground is dug, than to con∣vey
them to a manure-heap, and replace them after a twelve-month's
decomposition.</P>
<P>But where a luxuriant crop is immediately wanted, a manure-heap
towards the end of the putrefactive process by being re∣cently
interred in the soil, which is immediately to be sown or
planted, has this great advantage; that the carbonic acid is pre∣sently
formed by the mixture of atmospheric air with the car∣bon
of the manure; which exists therefore in its fluid, not its
gasseous state, and is thence more readily absorbed. Secondly,
ammoniac is produced, and nitre, and hydrogen probably is
mixed with nitrogen; and these also, I suppose, exist at first in
their fluid, not in their gasseous state. And thirdly, from these
combinations a genial degree of heat is evolved, which so much
assists the vernal growth of vegetation.</P>
<P>And where manure is to be used as a top-dressing, it is neces∣sary,
that it should be in a state of powder, or in small lumps of
loose cohesion, as mentioned above; that it may be easily washed
by rains to the roots of the grass, or that the young stems of
grass may readily shoot themselves through it; whence mature
heaps of manure are for this purpose necessary; and on this ac∣count
any adhesive manure, as cow-dung itself, should be week∣ly
gathered from grass-ground, where cattle are nourished, and
laid on heaps with soil, or straw, or weeds, to ferment or putre∣fy;
till it becomes less tenacious, and can be profitably replaced
in the ensuing spring.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="236"/>
Finally, I suspect the most economical method of
disposing of the straw and dung from the farm-yard would be, as soon as a
dark coloured water drains from the heap, by which much loss
is sustained, to carry the refuse of the stable and cow-house, as
freque<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly as convenient, to the ground, where it is designed to
be employed; and there to mix it with earth in heaps of proper
size, and to cover them likewise with soil; and by these means
I suppose the whole process of decomposition may be carried on
with very little loss; and by the addition of a greater or less
quantity of soil that the era of complete or most profitable de∣composition
of the compost may be managed, so as to coincide
nearly with the time it may be wanted.</P>
<P>4. Fourthly, it may be asked, what kinds of manure contri∣bute
most to the luxuriant growth of vegetables? In answer to
this it may be said, that as plants are inferior animals, and are
furnished with absorbent vessels in their roots correspondent to the
lacteals in the stomach; that the same organic matters, which by
their quick solution in the stomach supply the nutritive chyle to
animals, will by their flow solution in or near the surface of the
earth supply the nutritive sap-juice to vegetables. Hence all
kinds of animal and vegetable substances, which will undergo a
digestive process, or spontaneous solution, as the flesh, fat, skin,
and bones, of animals; with their secretions of bile, saliva, mu∣cus;
and their excretions of urine, and ordure; and also the
fruit, meal, oil, leaves, wood, of vegetables, when properly
decomposed on or beneath the soil, supply the most nutritive
food to plants.</P>
<P>Secondly, the chyle of all animals is similar to the sap-juice of
all vegetables in this circumstance, that they both contain muci∣lage
and sugar, and seem only to differ in this respect, that the
chyle of animals also contains oil, which being mixed with the
mucilage gives it its whiteness like milk. Hence those matters
must supply nutriment most expeditiously to vegetables which
contain mucilage and sugar, or produce them with the least de∣composition,
as the jellies from the shavings of horns, from hair,
woollen rags, and the saccharine matter of sweet fruits, roots,
kernels, seeds; and in the same manner these things with the
addition of oil are most expeditiously nutritive to animals.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="237"/>
Thirdly, such materials as contain in solution those simple
substances which constitute a great part of vegetable bodies as
carbon, which is found in most earths; and oxygen, hydrogen,
and nitrogen, which are found in water and in air; and from
hence we may conclude, that whatever material has constituted a
part of living organic bodies, may again constitute a part of
them; and that with more expedition, if they can be used with∣out
being decomposed into their primary elements.</P>
<P>Mr. Bewley, the Norfolk philosopher, said to a friend, who
was riding by his side, that when he wanted a whip, he habitu∣ally
looked for a dead stick in the hedge, unwilling to pluck off
a leafy branch, and destroy so many living buds. He might
have added, that to burn a hair or a straw unnecessarily diminishes
the sum of matter fit for quick nutrition by decomposing it nearly
into its elements, and should therefore give some compunctions
to a mind of universal sympathy.</P>
<P>It would seem therefore, that long roots fixed into the earth,
and leaves innumerable waving in the air, were necessary for
the decomposition and new combinations of water and air, and the
conversion of them into saccharine and mucilaginous matter;
which would have been not only cumbrous but totally incompa∣tible
with the locomotions of animal bodies; for how could a
man or quadruped have carried on his head or back a forest of
leaves, or have trailed after him long branching lacteals termi∣nating
on the surface of the earth? Animals therefore subsist on
vegetables; that is, they take the matter so far prepared, and
possess organs to prepare it further for the purposes of greater
sensibility, and of higher animation.</P>

<P>I. 1. THE great quantity of water required for healthy vege∣tation
is treated of in Sect. X. 3. 1. But as all extrems are
injurious, too much water becomes pernicious to all except
aquatic plants. Whence the necessity of draining those lands,
which too much abound with moisture; the art of which is
<PB N="233" REF="239"/>
better understood, since the knowledge of geology has been
studied, and in some measure diffused amongst the people.</P>
<P>Lands in respect to the method of draining them may be di∣vided
into two situations; those which lie so high, that the
water can descend from them, if it be properly collected and
conducted; and those which lie so low as to command no fall,
some of which are even below the level of the sea.</P>
<P>2. In regard to the former it generally happens, that the
waters from the springs beneath the soil have not a free passage
to the rivers in their vicinity; the nature of springs should there∣fore
be previously understood. Many modern philosophers have
endeavoured to shew, that all the continents and islands of the
world, as well as the hills, which emboss their surfaces, have
been raised out of the primeval ocean by subterraneous fires.
This appears from the quantity of sea-shells, which form innu∣merable
mountains; and from the fissures in the rocks, of
which they consist; the quantity of volcanic productions all over
the world; and the numerous remains of craters of volcanoes in
mountainous countries.</P>
<P>Hence the strata, which compose the sides of mountains, lie
slanting downwards; and one or two or more of the external
strata not reaching to the summit, when the mountain was
raised up, the second or third stratum, or a more inferior one,
is there exposed to day. This may be well represented by for∣cibly
thrusting a very blunt instrument through some folds of
paper, a bur will be raised with the lowermost leaf standing
highest in the center of it. Or if at the original elevation of an
extensive mountain the lowest stratum should not at first stand
higher in the center of the summit, it would in time become so
by some of the upper strata of the mountain being gradually
washed away by rains into the valleys or rivers. On this up∣permost
stratum which is colder, as it is more elevated, the
dews are condensed in large quantities; and sliding down pass
under the first, or second, or third stratum, which compose the
sides of the hill; and either form a morass below, or a weeping
rock by oozing out in numerous places; or many of these less
currents meeting together burst out in a more copious rill.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="240"/>
The immediate cause of springs consists therefore in the con∣densation
of the atmospheric moisture, during the night princi∣pally,
by the greater coldness of the summits of hills, which is
explained in detail in the Botanic Garden, Vol. I. additional
note 26. The water thus condensed on the summits of hills
descends between the strata of the incumbent soil, sometimes for
many miles together; but generally from the nearest eminences
into the adjoining vallies.</P>
<P>3. Thus there is a stratum of marl, which I have observed
on the surface of the lands about Derby, which extends many
miles in most directions. This stratum of marl is of various
thickness from 10 to 150 feet, and beneath it lies a stratum of
sand, which is also of various thickness from a few inches to
six or eight feet, and of various degrees of induration; and be∣neath
this lies another stratum of marl to an unknown depth.
On the top of Radborne-common, about five miles north-west
from Derby, the sandy stratum is quite loose, and rises above the
stratum of marl, which is deficient at the summit of the hill.
Three or four strong springs of water burst out on the sides of
this hill, which thus originate from the moisture of the atmos∣phere
condensed on the cold summit, and passing through the
sandy stratum between the two strata of marl.</P>
<P>In the road to Duffield, about two miles north of Derby, the
sand-stratum is cemented into stone, as well as in some situa∣tions
near Radborne-common above mentioned. This stratum
of sand-stone is some feet in thickness, and lies four or five
yards deep, beneath the upper stratum of marl, dividing it from
the lower one. At Normanton, about two miles south from
Derby, the sand-stratum consists of a loose sand, so white and
pure, that I imagine it might be used in the manufacture of
flint-glass, and lies about twelve feet deep, beneath the upper
stratum of marl, dividing it from the under one. In the town
of Derby on boring with design to sink a well, after having
passed about thirteen yards through marl, some sand was brought
up by the auger, and water followed, as related in the Philos-Transact.
Vol. LXXV.</P>
<P>The dews therefore, which are perpetually condensing on
the summits of these hills, descend beneath the upper
and under
<PB N="235" REF="241"/>
strata of marl, through the thin stratum of sand, which divides
them, and form St. Alkmund's well, and many other springs
in the vicinity of Derby; and probably all those which supply
the wells within the town.</P>
<P>But there is a situation, where the manner of the production
of springs is most agreeably visible; it is about a mile from the
city of Lichfield, near the cold bath erected by sir John Floyer,
in a beautiful piece of ground, which was formerly Dr. Dar∣win's
botanic garden.</P>
<P>In this place a grotto about six yards wide and ten long has
been excavated on the side of a hill consisting of filiceous sand∣stone
with this peculiar circumstance; that the upper stratum
of the sand-rock, which is there about <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive feet thick, is divided
from the lower stratum of it by a sheet of clay not more than
three or four inches in thickness; on the upper surface of this
sheet of clay, between the lips of these rocks, a perpetual drib∣bling
of water oozes quite round the grotto, like a shower from
a weeping rock. Such sheets of water having been often ob∣served
to slide between the strata of the earth almost horizon∣tally,
like the horizontal joints of a stone-wall, have, I sup∣pose,
given the name of wall-springs to them, to distinguish
them from pipe-springs, or such as burst out in a single rill.</P>
<P>Thus this thin sheet of clay prevents the water from sinking
into the lower stratum of sand-stone; and produces other copious
springs, which are collected at about half a mile's distance, and
conveyed by leaden pipes to the cathedral close of Lichfield,
which is thus supplied with water of uncommon purity, which
contains no calcareous earth, owing to its passing through sili∣ceous
sand over a stratum of clay, and which would be a trea∣sure
to the paper-mill or the bleach-yard.</P>
<P>4. One other circumstance in the present conformation of the
earth is necessary to be mentioned; which is, that at the time
when the mountains were raised all over the world by deep
volcanoes, or by central fires, some parts of the summits of
many of them, and of their steeper sides, rolled down again into
the new formed vallies. And secondly, that since that remote
time the recrements of vegetable and animal bodies have conti∣nually
been washed down from the eminences by showers, and
<PB N="236" REF="242"/>
have contributed gradually to accumulate in the vallies, and to
form the plains, which exist on the sides of rivers. This ap∣pears
from the tin ores found in the vallies in Cornwall in loose
pieces similar to those in the proximate mountains; and from
the black carbonic soil, or morass-turf, found in most vallies.</P>
<P>5. From these clear ideas of the strata of the earth, and of
the streams of water, which slide between them, and form what
are termed wall-springs, it is easy to conceive, that the best
method of preventing the vallies at the bottom of hills from
being too moist must be by cutting a long horizontal ditch into
the side of the mountain to intercept the water, just before the
level land of the valley commences; and thus to carry away
the water before it comes upon the plain beneath.</P>
<P>For this purpose at the foot of the hill where the plain, which
is too moist, commences, some auger-holes should be bored to
find the depth of the springs, that is to find the thickness of the
upper stratum of the soil. If this be only four or six feet, an
horizontal ditch should be cut along the bottom of the mountain
to intercept the water; which must then be carried away by one
or more other ditches opening into this, and conducting the
water so collected into the neighbouring rivulet.</P>
<P>As the strata, between which the water descends in forming
these springs, have generally the same inclination as the surface
of the hill, or nearly so; it follows, that the holes should be
bored, and the ditch cut, not vertically downwards, as is the
common practice, but perpendicular to the surface of the moun∣tain;
as by that means the second stratum will sooner be arrived
at; as shewn in Plate V. at the end of this Section.</P>
<P>6. But if on cutting a ditch five or six feet along the bottom
of the hill perpendicular to the rising plain, which forms the
side of it, the upper stratum be not cut through; and in conse∣quence
no water oozes into the bottom of the ditch; it is then
proper to bore other holes at the bottom of this ditch some yards
deeper, or till water rises up through them into the ditch, if it
can be so discovered. Where this succeeds, many holes should
be bored, and the water received into the ditches, and conduct∣ed
into the adjacent river; for the water will then rise into the
bottom of this ditch six feet below the wet surface of the valley,
<PB N="237" REF="243"/>
and thus flow away, rather than rise up from the lower wall-springs,
or apertures of the stratum, through the incumbent soil
to the surface of the valley, which is so many feet higher.
This well understood is the great secret for draining those
grounds, where the springs can not be cut into simply by a
ditch.</P>
<P>This method has been some years practised with success by
Mr. Elkington, but was previously used and explained by Mr.
Anderson, as he asserts in his introduction to Vol. III. of his
Essays on Agriculture, who sunk a hole into the earth at the
bottom of a ditch in the year 1764, and the water rose six feet
above the surface of the ground, and has continued to flow with
less violence ever since that time.</P>
<P>It should here be noticed, that where the water rises with
great force through holes thus bored into a deep stratum, it is
liable to bring up along with it much sand, so as sometimes to
obstruct its passage; which sand in this case must frequently be re∣moved
for a few days by the reapplication of the auger. Of this
a remarkable instance is published in a late volume of the Phil.
Trans. By Mr. Wulliamy, who sunk a well 236 feet deep and
four feet wide; and, on then boring a few feet lower, with a
five-inch borer, so much sand arose with a violent stream of
water, as to fill up the whole well; which was repeatedly
cleared away by buckets in its fluid state, and at last the
water ran over the surface to the amount of forty-six gallons
in a minute.</P>
<P>The manner of making these ditches narrower, as they des∣cend,
by spades of an adapted breadth; and of making the lowest
part narrower than any other part, so that the shoulders or edges
of it may support stones, or faggots, to cover the whole at a
small expence without obstructing the currents of water, are
obvious to the workmen. In many situations hollow bricks, or
ridge-tiles, or old pieces of plaster-floors, may be worth the
additional expence of providing them.</P>
<P>7. There may nevertheless be found situations, where the
first stratum of earth may be too thick to be easily penetrated;
or where the water, condensed from the atmosphere on the sum∣mits
of the hills, may slide between the second and third, or
<PB N="238" REF="244"/>
between the third and fourth strata, which form the sides of
those hills, owing to a deficiency of so many of the strata at the
summits of them; and hence that it may lie too deep to be ea∣sily
arrested by a ditch, or by boring; and yet by its being
dammed up by the materials, which form the level plain of the
valley, may rise up through those materials to the surface, and
form boggy or morassy ground.</P>
<P>In these situations the common unskilful method of draining
may be usefully employed; which consists in cutting many ditches
four or six feet deep across the bog or morass; and covering
them, so that the water may have no obstruction in passing along
them; which may thus, as it rises from below, be in part col∣lected
and conveyed away; though less advantageously than
where the springs can be intercepted.</P>
<P>Another method of draining moist meadows has been by
making or opening drains almost annually by a large plough
with two converging coulters, and other adapted parts, for the
purpose of cutting both the sides of a ditch at the same time,
and turning out the intervening turf and soil. These large
ploughs have been kept in some parishes, and drawn over moist
commons by twelve or twenty horses, to form parallel ditches.</P>
<P>Mr. Adam Scott has invented for the same purpose what he
terms a mole plough, which consists of a coulter fifteen inches
long, and two and a half wide, to cut the sward; and behind
this an horizontal cone of cast iron twenty inches long, and two
and half diameter at the base, to the middle of which is fixed
an upright bar two feet long, and three inches and a half broad,
with a sharp edge. As this cast iron cone is drawn along six
or eight inches beneath the turf in moist lands, either in the
spring or autumn, in many parallel lines, the water for a con∣siderable
time is conveyed away, and no injury done to the sur∣face;
which thus seems to be an useful machine, and may be
well managed, I am informed, by six or eight horses. In very
moist lands, or at very moist seasons, if more horses be used,
their feet will not sink so deep into the turf, as each horse will
draw less; or a contrivance of adding broader shoes of wood
to the horses like the snow-shoes of higher latitudes, might
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
answer this purpose. See Transact. of Society of Arts, Vol.
XV.</P>
<P>8. There are nevertheless some situations, where the water is
conveyed beneath the first stratum on a thin bed of clay over a
porous sand-stone beneath it; as in the grotto at Lichfield above
described. In these situations by boring many auger-holes, or
by sinking wells, through the stratum of clay the water will
penetrate the sand-stone beneath it; and either pass away by the
porosity of this kind of stone, or by the cracks or joints which
are always found in it; of which the horizontal joints were
formed at the time of the production or accumulation of the
sand beneath the sea, which was then formed in horizontal
strata; but the vertical cracks were made at the time of its ele∣vation
by subterraneous fires. In these vertical fissures the ores
of lead, ponderous earth, and calcareous spars, are found in
the lime-stone rocks of Derbyshire; and those of tin, and
quartz, in the granite rocks of Cornwall.</P>
<P>9. The knowledge of this part of geology concerning the
formation of springs may be employed for many useful purposes;
thus where the wall-springs, or water-conducting strata, lie so
deep as not to be accessible at a small expense; they generally ex∣ist
between the second and the third, or between third and fourth
strata; which rise into day higher on the summits of the adja∣cent
mountains than the first stratum; and hence, when they
are bored into, the water will rise higher, than when it is found
beneath the first stratum only; which generally becomes defi∣cient
on lower parts of the adjacent eminences of the country.</P>
<P>Thus where water, descending in high columns between the
strata of mountains, is dammed up below by the materials,
which fill up the vallies; if a hole be bored in the valley deep
through the incumbent soil and strata, it frequently rises much
above the source of the new aperture, and sometimes above the
surface of the ground. In sinking the king's well at Sheerness
the water rose 300 feet above its source in the well, as related
in Philos. Transact. Vol. LXXIV. And at Hartford in Con∣necticut
there is a well, which was dug seventy feet before water
was found; and then on boring an auger hole through a rock
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
the water rose so fast, as to make it difficult to keep it dry by
pumps, till the hole could be blown larger by gun-powder;
which was no sooner accomplished, than it filled, and run over,
and has been a brook for near a century. Travels through
America, Lond. 1789. Lane.</P>
<P>In the town of Richmond in Surry, and at Inslip near Pres∣ton,
in Lancashire, I am informed, that it is usual to bore for
water to a certain depth; and that when it is found in both
those places, it rises so high as to flow over the surface. And
there is reason to conclude, that if similar experiments were
made in many other places, such artificial springs might be pro∣duced
at small expence, both for the common purposes of life,
and for the great improvement of lands by watering them.</P>
<P>10. Another deduction, which may be made from this know∣ledge
of geology, is, that many springs of water, which lie too
low for serving a house, or street, or town, or for watering
higher grounds for the purposes of agriculture or gardening,
may in many situations be dammed up many feet with little or
no loss. Thus when the new bridge was building at Dublin,
Mr. G. Semple found a spring in the bed of the river, where
he meant to lay the foundation of a pier; which by fixing
iron pipes into it he raised many feet; and in boring a hole near the
Derwent in Derby about fifteen yards deep, the water rose
above the surface of the ground, and has continued to flow now
for above twelve years in rather an increasing quantity. From
having observed a valley north-west of St. Alkmund's well near
Derby, at the head of which that spring of water once probably
existed, and by its current formed the valley, (which current
in after times found its way out in its present lower situation),
I suspect, that St. Alkmund's well might by building round it
be raised high enough to supply many streets in Derby with
spring water, which are now only supplied with river water.</P>
<P>11. A third deduction from the knowledge of this geology
concerning the production of springs teaches, that by enlarging
the bottom of a well, where the water oozes from between the
surrounding strata in too scanty a supply, a proportionally greater
quantity of water may be procured. The hole near the river
Derwent in Derby above mentioned, is about an inch and a
<PB N="241" REF="247"/>
half in diameter and was bored about fifteen yards deep through
the uppermost stratum of marl into the sand beneath it, and sup∣plies
Dr. Darwin's house with two or three hogsheads of water
a day. And Mr. Strutt near St. Peter's Bridge has sunk a well
for the use of his steam-engine about 200 yards from the former,
which passes through the same upper stratum of marl, and is
three feet in diameter at the bottom, and supplies, when re∣quired,
a hundred hogsheads in a day.</P>
<P>12. The knowledge of this part of geology leads to another
useful purpose, the discovery of springs; concerning which some
have pretended to possess secret or mystical intelligence both in
England and in France. When the eminences of a country
were raised out of the primeval ocean by subterraneous fires, some
of them were raised nearly equal on all sides, like the limestone
mountain at Breedon in Leicestershire; in which the central
stratum may be seen to stand nearly erect or vertical, and those
on all sides at considerable inclination. Other mountains were
abruptly broken off on one side only from the adjoining earth,
like those which form the high torr at Matlock; which rise with
one of their sides perpendicular as a wall by the Derwent side;
so that the strata of the former of these mountains may be re∣presented,
as before mentioned, by the bur, which would be
made on some folds of paper, if a very hard blunt instrument
was thrust through them; and the latter by raising up one edge
of fuch solds of paper, so as to incline the whole of it at some
angle with the horizon.</P>
<P>As the springs consist of the water, which slides between
these inclined strata; it is evident, that in some eminences of
ground they are only to be met with on one side of the mountain;
and in other eminences of ground on all sides of it. In searching
for springs therefore attention should be given to the inclination
of the strata of that part of the country, which may be often seen
in marl-pits, gravel-pits, or in hollow lanes. But they may in
general be found above any moist or morassy plain or valley;
the moisture of which shews, that springs exist in the strata on that side of the mountain.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="248"/>
A second observation for the purpose of detecting springs may
be made on misty evenings; as those parts of the ground,
where the mist commences, are moister than those in their vici∣nity
on the same level; and in consequence may generally, if
they are not hollow basons, possess springs nearer the surface;
for these moister parts of the ground, having evaporated more
during the day, are become colder on their surfaces than the
drier ground in their vicinity; and in misty evenings, which are
at the same time calm, the stationary air over these moist parts
of the ground is also more loaded with the evaporated moisture;
and on both these accounts these moister situations are liable to
shew a condensation of aerial vapour sooner than other places on
the same level.</P>
<P>As mountains are colder in proportion to their height, which
is explained in Botanic Garden, Vol. I. additional note 26, the
evening mist sometimes commences sooner on them than in the
valleys; but is seen earlier in these situations over the moister
places, if they are on the same level with the drier ones, exactly
as on the plains or valleys; and may therefore indicate the ex∣stence
of springs, unless these moister places, consist of hollow
basons containing water, which if not attended to may in all situ∣ations
deceive the observer.</P>
<P>Another observation for detecting springs may be made in
rimy mornings; for as moist earth is a better conductor of heat
than dry earth the rime will sooner melt on those parts of the
soil, which are kept moist by springs under it than on other
parts; as the common heat of the earth, which is 48 in this
country, will sooner be conducted upwards in moist places to
dissolve the rime on the surface. On this account the rime is
frequently seen on frosty mornings, when the heat of the air is
not much above 32, to lie an hour longer on dry cakes of cow-dung,
or on bridges, or planks of wood, than on the common
moist-ground; as the latter much better conducts the common
heat of the earth to the incumbent rime, which is in contact
with it.</P>
<P>But as the heat of the common springs in this country is 48,
where they exist, the rime is sooner dissolved, than on the stag∣nant
<PB N="243" REF="249"/>
moisture of bogs or morasses. And as the springs about
Buxton and Matlock, and at Bath and Bristol, are so much
warmer than common springs; it is highly probable, that where
these waters approach the surface of the soil, they must much
sooner dissolve the rime on frosty mornings; which may probably
be observed in situations much higher than their present
apparent sources; as they slide down between the interior strata of those
hills, beneath the summit of which they are condensed from the
steam of water boiling at great depths in the earth; which rises
up through those perpendicular clefts of the rocks, which were
formed at their original elevation, as explained in Botanic Gar∣den,
Vol. II. note on fucus; and in Pilkington's View of Der∣byshire,
V. I. p. 256.</P>
<P>In the winter months the rise of springs may be detected in
moist ditches by the presence of aquatic plants, as of water-cress,
water-parsnip, brook-lime; as in those ditches, which become
dry in the summer, these plants do not exist; and when those
ditches with springs in them are nearly dry, it may be discovered
which way the current has formerly descended by the direction
of the points of the leaves of the aquatic plants as certainly as
by a level; an observation which I learnt from Mr. Brindley,
the great canal-conductor of Staffordshire.</P>
<P>Finally, these arts of detecting the situation of springs may be
advantageous to the attentive agricultor both for the purposes of
draining those lands, which too much abound with water, and
for the purpose of watering those, which are too dry, and which
lie beneath the level of the springs, or to which the water may
be raised by wind-mills or water-engines to be explained here∣after.</P>
<P>II. 1. In respect to draining those plains or morasses where no
fall can be had, the water may in many situations be caught by
cutting a long horizontal ditch into the adjoining mountain per∣pendicular
to the inclined plane, which constitutes the side of
the mountain, above the level of the morass, so as to intercept
all the wall springs; and may then be conveyed away in wooden
troughs or hollow bricks above the surface; and if some water
still finds its way into the morass, this less quantity may be con∣ducted
<PB N="244" REF="250"/>
to one extremity of the ground in open drains or covered
soughs, and raised by an horizontal windmill and centrifugal
pump, as described at the end of this Section; and thus the
morass may be converted into soil of the most productive kind.</P>
<P>2. There may be other situations, as in the Peak of Derby∣shire,
where pools of water, or morasses, are collected on the
hollow summits of hills; which have been the craters of volca∣noes
in the primeval ages of the world, as Elden-hole near Castle∣ton,
which seems to have been the shaft of such a volcano. In
many of these basons on the summits of hills there still exist
what are called “Swallows,” or cavities; where the water sinks
into the earth, as it collects, to pass to some distant valley,
as Elden-hole above mentioned, and as in the channels of the
rivers Hamp and Manifold, between Ashbourn and Leek. In
others, as at the summit of a steep promontory called Axedge,
near Buxton, and about Broke-house, are unfathomed morasses,
which are said in some places not to bear a sheep to pass over
them; and that on the more tenacious parts of them it is neces∣sary
for the adventurer to step from tassock to tassock, or to
carry a long pole horizontally in his hand, like those who skaite
upon suspected ice to prevent his sinking over head, if he should
chance to sink at all.</P>
<P>It is probable, that by sinking a well, or boring a hole, where
such morasses or lakes now exist, into the obstructed shaft of the
ancient volcano, the water might be let off from those eminent
morasses at less expence, than by excavating a passage for it some
miles in a country of marble.</P>
<P>3. It is possible there may be situations in high countries of
marble, or granite, or quartz, where the difficulty and expence
of excavating the ground may be too great, as above; in which a
syphon might be contrived for the purpose of raising the water
from a morass or lake, and conveying it away. Such an in∣strument
might be constructed of bored Riga deals; but as air is
liable to collect in the summit of a syphon from the water,
which passes through it, it would be necessary to fix at the sum∣mit
an air-vessel with an air-pump at the top of it; which might
be moved by a very small horizontal windmill sail, to be des∣cribed
<PB N="245" REF="251"/>
at the end of this Section, or occasionally by the hand of
a labourer for a few minutes perhaps once or twice a day.</P>
<P>4. The draining of those large plains, which lie beneath the
level of the sea, is a subject, which belongs to the public, rather
than to the individual farmer; and is practised near Linn on
the river Cam by locks to keep out the tide, and by windmills
to lift or forward the otherwise stagnate water in the fen-dikes.
These windmills have vertical sails of the common kind, which
move a vertical water-wheel, by which the water is raised a foot
or two; but it is probable even this might be done better by the
horizontal sail and centrifugal pump to be described at the end
of this Section, as being a simpler machine, and requiring no
attention to turn it to the wind.</P>
<P>It might be a noble work, worthy the attention of a govern∣ment,
that wished to increase the quantity of nutriment, and con∣sequent
population and happiness of the country, to employ pro∣per
engineers with a number of labourers to environ with ditches
every morassy district of whatever extent, which lies beneath
the level of the tides, as the fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridge∣shire.
These ditches should be cut at the feet of the adjacent
rising grounds, or of eminences surrounded with fens, like
islands in a lake, so as to intercept the wall-springs and land-floods,
and convey the water thus collected above the level of
the morass into the ocean.</P>
<P>But this, I fear, is an effort not to be expected in the present
times, when the enclosure of forests and large commons is pre∣vented
by the interest of individuals, or by the difficulty of pro∣curing
expensive acts of parliament for every minute district,
instead of including them in a general act, so meritoriously con∣tended
for by sir John Sinclair, then President of the Agricul∣tural
Society.</P>
<P>5. Where finally the draining of marshy grounds can not be
effected at a responsible expence, some plants may perhaps be
cultivated with profit to the cultivator; as in some situations the
festica fluitans, floating fescue, callitriche, star-grass; or in
others the orchis for the purpose of making saloop by drying the
peeled roots in an oven. This might be better worth notice, if
the seed could be ripened in this climate for its easier propagation,
<PB N="246" REF="252"/>
which probably may be accomplished either by cutting away the
new root, as is affirmed in the Amoenitates Academicae; or by
planting them in a garden-pot so as to confine the roots in respect
to space, which is said in the same work to ripen the seeds of
convallaria, lily of the valley; and lastly by cultivating a sew on
a hot-bed or in a green-house.</P>
<P>In other situations the menyanthes, bog-bean, would flourish
abundantly, and might become a substitute for hops in the brew∣ery,
and be equally wholesome and palatable. It is indeed
much to be lamented, that we have no grain similar to rice,
that will grow in watery grounds in this cold climate, nor any
esculent roots or foliage except the water-cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss. There is reason
to believe nevertheless, that the roots of nymphaea, water-lily, or
of butomus, flowering-rush, may be esculent by simple boiling;
or that a wholesome starch might be obtained from them; or
lastly, that they might be fermentable into ardent spirit, like
the roots of potatoes, or into vinegar.</P>
<P>The nymphaea n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lumbo is much cultivated in China in their
swampy grounds, and in their lakes. The seed is like an acorn,
and of a taste more delicate than that of almonds. The roots
are sliced and served with ice in summer at their tables; and are
preserved in salt and vinegar for the winter. Embassy to China
by sir G. Staunton, Vol. III. p. 214, 8vo. ed. The nym∣phaea
alba of our country produces a root of three or four inches
in diameter. See Sect. XVII. 2. 3; and though the seed is very
small, and perhaps does not perfectly ripen, I have observed it to
be agreeable to the palate both in its recent state, and when dry.</P>
<P>If these should not succeed, other quick-growing plants might
be cultivated for manures, as typha, cat's-tail, caltha, and others;
which should be mowed twice a year, while they are young,
and in consequence abound with saccharine and mucilaginous
matter ready to pass into fermentation.</P>
<P>III. 1. The advantages resulting from occasionally covering
lands with water have long been experienced in warmer coun∣tries,
as in Egypt, Italy, and many parts of China; and have
of late years been introduced into our own more northern cli∣mates.
The great importance of much water to the progress of
vegetation has already been spoken of in Section X. 3. And in
<PB N="247" REF="253"/>
the warm climates above mentioned, it is particularly useful in
the cultivation of rice for the purpose perhaps of simply moisten∣ing
the ground.</P>
<P>But the advantages of flooding meadow-lands in this country
may be divided principally into three kinds, one of which con∣sists
in simply moistening them, which seems to be the principal
use of watering lands in warm countries, where the water is
derived to them almost every evening from reservoirs above them,
or from water-wheels worked by asses, and which is sometimes
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>one in the gardens of this country by watering pans and human
labour.</P>
<P>The second and greater advantage of flooding lands in this
climate consists in deriving much water over them from rivers or
from strong springs, and by thus supplying them with the muddy
sediment brought down by rivers, after sudden rains, or with
the calcareous earth dissolved in many springs. All those springs,
which pass through marl, or chalk, or other limestone, are re∣plete
with calcareous earth; which they hold in solution, as
those about Derby and about Matlock, which earth they deposit
on standing on the soil, or in slowly trickling over it. See Sect.
X. 6. 2. And river water in rainy seasons is loaded with dif∣fused
as well as with dissolved materials from the neighbouring
country.</P>
<P>Both these therefore are of great service in flooding meadow-lands,
and perhaps almost all other lands. But those springs,
which pass only through siliceous sandstone, as those at Lichfield
in Staffordshire, have no calcareous earth dissolved in them, as
I have found by experiment; and the water of most rivers, when
they are not swelled by rain, are also too pure for this purpose;
as they have deposited already in their course the calcareous
earth, which might abound in the springs, which feed them; as
I have observed by experiments on the water of the Derwent at
Derby, which though it runs for many miles about Matlock
through a bed of limestone, yet when clear of mud from rains, it
contains no calcareous earth, as it passes by Derby, though the
springs in the vicinity are replete with it. Neither of these
sources of water can therefore do much service for this second
design of depositing limestone or mud.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="254"/>
The third advantage of flooding lands in this climate is for
the purpose of defending them from the cold of the winter or
vernal months. For this advantage the water from strong
springs, which are always at 48 degrees of Farenheit in this
country, is preferable to river water, where it can be had in suf∣ficient
quantity; since the water of rivers is of the same degree
of cold as the atmosphere, till the thermometer sinks to 32.
But both of them, when they form a sheet of thin ice, as they
cover a meadow, defend the roots of the grass from severer
degrees of cold; which are thus preserved, and those of some
grasses are believed even to vegetate beneath the ice, as the rein∣deer
moss in Siberia vegetates beneath the snow in a degree of
heat about 40, which the medium between that of the under
surface of the thawing snow, which is 32; and that of the com∣mon
heat of the interior parts of the earth, which is 48; and
thus the crops of grass in this cold climate may be wonder∣fully
forwarded; so as almost to double the product of the year,
if well managed and carefully attended to.</P>
<P>The method of forming the channels to convey the water
consists in carrying the first or principal aqueduct along the
highest part of the meadow, and deriving others on the summits
of the lands: if the meadow has formerly been ploughed into
ridges, and furrows, these again are to be divaricated so as to
pass into the furrows; all these branches of the stream are again
to be collected from the furrows, and discharged at the lowest
part of the surface.</P>
<P>Something similar to this must be managed on more level
grounds, so as to conduct the water over the whole meadow,
and also to carry it off, that it may not stagnate; but that a
moving sheet of water about an inch in depth may continually
flow over the whole for the purpose of depositing the materials
dissolved or diffused in it. The construction and width of these
channels, with many useful observations, are shewn in a pamphlet
of Mr. T. Wright, on “the Art of Floating Land in Glou∣cestershire.'.
Scatcherd. London.</P>
<P>2. Mr. Wright in the treatise above mentioned advises, that
the aftermath of grass land should be eaten off bare by the be∣ginning
<PB N="249" REF="255"/>
of November, and that the channels for conducting the
water to and from the meadows should be then cleansed and re∣paired;
and that the water should be suffered to flow over the
meadow for three weeks; and that then the land ought to be ex∣posed
to the air for a few days; since some of the grasses, and
those of the most nutritive kinds, he believes will not much
longer exist under water. By this early preparation, he adds,
that advantage is taken of the autumnal floods, which bring
along with them a greater quantity of putrescent matter than
those of winter.</P>
<P>In the months of December and January Mr. Wright adds,
that the chief care of the floater consists in keeping the land
sheltered by the water from the severity of frosty nights; but
advises through the whole of these months every ten or fourteen
days to expose the land to the air by laying it as dry as possible
for a few days; and always to discontinue the flooding, when
the land is covered with a sheet of ice.</P>
<P>In the month of February greater attention is required; if
the water be suffered to flow over the meadow for the space of
many days without intermission, a white scum is generated, and
the grass is much injured. And he justly observes that, if you
now take off the water and expose the land in its wet state to a
severe frosty night, a great part of the grass will be cut off.</P>
<P>Mr. Wright adds, that in Gloucestershire two methods of
avoiding these injuries are practiced: one is to take off the water
by day to prevent the production of the scum, and to turn it
over again at night to guard against the frost. The other is to
take off the water early in the morning; and, if the day be dry,
to suffer it to remain off a few days and nights; for if the land
experiences only one drying day, the frost at night will do little
injury. But the former of these practices, where it can be easily
done, he thinks preferable to the latter.</P>
<P>In the beginning of March the grass on well-flooded meadows
will generally be so forward, as to afford abundant pasturage, and
the water should be taken off for about a week, that the land
may become dry and firm; and the cattle should for the first
week be allowed a little hay in the evening if the weather be
cold and rainy.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="256"/>
In the month of April the grass may be eaten off quite short
and close, but not later; since if you trespass but one week in
the month of May, the crop of hay, which is to succeed, will
be much impaired; and the grass will become soft and woolly,
and the hay have the appearance of lattermath hay, and be less
valuable.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the month of May the water is again
thrown over the meadows for a few days; which simply by
moistening the land will in most seasons, Mr. Wright observes,
ensure a crop of hay of one ton and a half on an acre in the
course of six or seven weeks.</P>
<P>The water is sometimes again used, when the hay is carried
off, but may render the lattermath, he thinks, unwholesome to
sheep. But this is particularly serviceable, when the water is
rendered turbid by sudden rains. Some have taken off two
hay-crops in one year, but this Mr. Wright thinks is imprudent
in this climate; which however I suppose might be accomplish∣ed,
where the first growth is not eaten in April, and where
much turbid river water or calcareous spring water can be used
between them.</P>
<P>Mr. Wright further observes, that the hay on these flooded
meadows is little inferior to upland hay, if it be cut at its proper
age; but that some avaricious farmers have permitted it to re∣main
uncut till it produces three tons on an acre, and that then
it will become long and coarse, and little better than straw.
But that when it is cut in June, and has been flooded well with
muddy water in the winter, that it becomes little inferior to the
best upland hay.</P>
<P>The hay, I should suppose, which is cut before the grass is
in full flower, while the saccharine juice still remains in part
at the joints of the flower-stems, must contain the most nutri∣tious
matter; which is afterwards absorbed as the flower ex∣pands,
and as the seed ripens, and forms the meal or starch of
the seed-lobe, and is shed upon the ground, or consumed by
birds, and the grass-stems and their leaves become simply like
the straw of ripened corn.</P>
<P>This will appear of more importance to any one, who at∣tends
to the difference of the pods or husks of peas, or of kidney-beans,
<PB N="251" REF="257"/>
during the early state of the enclosed seeds, and again
after the seeds become ripe. The pode or capsule is at first
sweet and mucilaginous, so as to supply an agreeable and nutri∣tive
food, the latter of which, and sometimes the former, are
eaten at our tables; afterwards as the seeds, which are attached
alternately to each side of the capsule, drink up by their vege∣table
life after impregnation the saccharine and mucilaginous
matters there purposely deposited for them; the capsule itself
becomes a mere fibrous membrane not better than the straw of
ripe grains above mentioned.</P>
<P>It may be here repeated, that one great use in this country
of flooding grass-grounds in winter, and in early spring, so as
to let a thin sheet of water perpetually flow slowly over them,
is, that it will in frosty nights, when the cold is not much below
the freezing point, produce a thin sheet of ice, and thus prevent
the cold from affecting the roots of the grass beneath it; which
may thus be two or three weeks forwarder than on other lands;
for ice is so bad a conductor of heat, that water is not readily
frozen beneath it; and especially if it stands hollow, so as to en∣close
a stratum of air between itself and the water beneath.</P>
<P>This seems to have been attended to by the philosophers in
the French army, when they passed over ice to subdue Hol∣land;
fearing least the ice should be too weak for the passage
of their troops and artillery, they bored many holes through it
every night; and then by pressure on its surface the water
was made to rise through these holes, so as to stand an inch
above the surface; which being thus exposed to the cold air of
the night, became frozen before morning; and thus in a few
nights thickened and strengthened the ice ten times more
than would have been done naturally by the slower freezing
beneath it.</P>
<P>3. To recapitulate the advantages of flooding, first, not only
the common meadow grounds are enriched, but morassy ones
are consolidated, by the mud brought over them from river
water; or the calcareous sediment, and azotic or nitrogen air,
from most spring waters, during those seasons when grass does
not naturally make much progress in its growth. 2. They are de∣fended
from frost by the flowing water, or by the ice, when
<PB N="252" REF="258"/>
it is frozen; and thus a much forwarder crop of grass is pro∣duced,
as may frequently be seen over pieces of ground natu∣rally
moist; which look green in the spring, some weeks be∣fore
that on drier land in their vicinity. 3. The ground is
rendered more easily penetrable by the roots of grass, both by
its being kept softer, and also from its being seldomer frozen
below the surface in the vernal months. 4. This early crop
may be eaten off by cattle or sheep, and a new flooding for a
short time will forward the growth of it so as to produce a good
crop of hay. 5. After the hay is removed another flooding
for a short time ensures a luxuriant growth of autumnal grass,
or aftermath.</P>
<P>The difficulty of getting moist lands free from rushes is said
to be readily overcome by flooding them, and that especi∣ally
after previously moving them, as their spongy pith will then
absorb so much water, as to cause them to putrify by its stagna∣tion;
or if this be done in autumn or spring, and a frost super∣venes,
the water in their pith by expanding, as it becomes ice,
bursts and destroys their organic structure.</P>
<P>The following conclusion is copied from Parkinson's Expe∣rienced
Farmer. “Upon the whole, artificial watering of
meadows is a most profitable improvement; it robs no dunghill,
but raises one for the benefit of other lands; for if a farmer can
water ten acres of land, cut the grass and use it either in stall
or fold-feeding, he might keep perhaps forty beasts; and by
working the manure made by them into a compost, and applying
that compost to other lands, he might either have a great deal
more hay for the winter, or seed more cattle in the summer.”
Vol. II. p. 68.</P>
<P>4. Two or three observations of importance should be here
inserted. 1. That in flooding lands for a considerable time,
the water should only trickle over them from the canal, which
leads it along the more elevated parts, and not stand on it like
a fish-pond; as in the latter case the grass roots will perish in a
few weeks in the early spring, to the great injury of the farmer,
an example of which on several acres I once witnessed.</P>
<P>As soon as any materials thus begin to putrefy beneath the
water, a scum of white froth arises owing to the air set at liberty
<PB N="353" REF="259"/>
by putrefaction; which is supposed by some to injure the grass,
whereas it is a consequence rather than a cause of injury, and
shews that the water has stagnated too long; and should either
be immediately drawn off, or supplied by a running stream:
but the former should probably be preferred: if the stems of
grass are so tall as to rise above the running water, it is proba∣ble,
that their death and putrefaction do not so soon occur.</P>
<P>Secondly. It is observed by gardeners, that in dry seasons,
if you begin to water any kinds of plants, you must continue
to repeat it; otherwise that they are sooner injured by dry
weather, than those which have not been watered. This fact
also I think I have observed, and it may depend on the cir∣cumstance
of the roots of annual vegetables shooting themselves
lower down in dry seasons in search of moisture; but if this be
given them in the commencement of their growth, they then
shoot their roots more horizontally, and are afterwards in con∣sequence
sooner destroyed by the subsequent dry weather.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Much cold water given suddenly to plants, which
were nearly perishing with heat and dryness, will I believe some∣times
injure or destroy them, as I saw occur this year, 1798,
in June to some rows of garden beans; which after being flood∣ed
for one night withered, and in part died, on the following
day, which was probably caused, not by the excess of water, as
plants of this genus would seem to bear much moisture from an
experiment of Lord Kaimes, who says in the Gentleman
Farmer, that he planted a pea on some cotton-wool spread on
water in a phial, and that it sprung up, and shot roots through
the cotton-wool into the water, and produced large pods full
of ripe seeds. The death of these beans was more probably
occasioned by the torpor of the system induced by cold, as oc∣curs
to those who have injudiciously drank much cold water,
or plunged into a cold bath, when they have been previously
much weakened by the unnecessary activity of the system occa∣sioned
by continued heat, or great exercise. See Sect XIV. 1. 1.</P>
<P>Nor is there reason to suppose that to whatever extent this
mode of cultivation of grass could be carried in this country,
that any injurious effects in respect to the health of the inhabi∣tants
<PB N="254" REF="260"/>
could be produced; as this mode of flooding is not by
stagnant water, as in rice grounds; which D. A. J. Cavanilles,
who has lately published a work on the cultivation of rice in the
kingdom of Valencia, believes to be injurious to the health of
the inhabitants. Magaz. Encyclop. T. 3.</P>
<P>In these cold climates the vicinity of running streams may
perhaps be rather falubrious than the contrary; as the air is
cooled in hot weather, and warmed in cold weather, by its
contact with their ever-changing surfaces, till they become
frozen. I at this moment recollect many, who lived to an
healthy old age in the valley of the Trent near the very edge
of the water, whose names I could repeat. But stagnate wa∣ters,
from which putrid exhalations arise, produce agues in
cold countries, as in the fens of Lincolnshire; and putrid
fevers in hot ones; from which our armies suffered so much
at St. Lucia both in the present and the last war.</P>
<P>5. This practice of flooding is capable of being extended to
a wonderful degree in this country, not only by using the natu∣ral
falls of brooks and springs, and by occasionally damming
them up to supply higher situations; and by effectually spread∣ing
the land-floods from accidental showers over the inferior
lands to a great extent. And lastly, the water, which is now
dammed up to supply the numerous mills, might be diffused
in rills over a thousand meadows, or part of it be raised by
pumps to higher grounds; and thus fertilize and enrich the
country; while the grinding of corn, spinning of cotton, rolling
iron bars, and other mechanic purposes, might be effected
by wind-mills, or steam-engines, in almost every part of the
island.</P>
<P>For this purpose likewise the new method of raising water by
the vis inertiae or acquired momentum of moving streams might
be well applied, which was formerly used by Mr. Whitehurst
of Derby on a small scale at Oulton in Cheshire, as described
with a plate of the machine, to which an air-vessel is ingeni∣ously
added, in the Philosophical Transactions for the year
1775, Vol. LXV. p. 277, and which is now adapted to va∣riety
of ingenious machinery by M. Boulton, Esq. of Soho near
<PB N="255" REF="261"/>
Birmingham; and is well explained with two prints in the
Repertory of Arts and Manufactures, No. LI.</P>
<P>6. The following water machine, which is on the principle
of Hiero's fountain, is designed to raise part of the water of a
spring, or small brook, where some feet of fall may be acquired,
to a greater height for the purpose of watering higher levels of
ground; and the horizontal windmill with centrifugal pump is
designed for the same purpose, where no fall can be acquired.
We shall then perhaps have satiated some of our readers with
this subject of watering lands, and may conclude with
the shepherds in Virgil's Eclogue,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">AERATION AND PULVERIZATION OF THE SOIL.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>I.</HI> Scils contain inflammable matters and water. Air consists of
oxygen, nitrogen, and heat. Produces carbonic, nitrous, and
phosphoric acids, and volatile alkali with water when buried in
the soil. Heat and light given out from the union of carbon and
oxygen in a letter-wafer. Sow and set soon after the plough or

8. Rolling wheat in spring.</Q>
<P>As almost all soils not only contain carbon, and other inflam∣mable
materials, which are capable of uniting with oxygen, and
thus producing the carbonic and other acids; but also contain
water, which by its decomposition, when in contact with con∣fined
air, produces ammonia or volatile alkali by the union of
its hydrogen with azote; and nitre by the union of its abundant
oxygen with another part of the abundant azote or nitrogen of
the atmospheric air; there is reason to conclude, that the great
use of turning over the soil with the plough or spade depends
principally in the production of these effects by the confinement
of both the oxygen and the azote or nitrogen of the air in the
interstices of the soil; and on this account we have entitled this
section the aeration of the soil rather than the oxygenation of
it, as the latter belongs to the respiration rather than to the nu∣trition
of vegetables.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="263"/>
When atmospheric air is imprisoned in the cavities of the
soil by turning over its surface, which must be in greater quantity,
when the soil is reduced into the very small fragments, which
has been called pulverization; and when it is the least pressed
down by animals trampling on it, it more readily unites, I be∣lieve,
with the materials above mentioned than in its free state;
which is probably effected by double or triple chemical affini∣ties.</P>
<P>For this atmospheric air consists of oxgen, azote, and the
fluid matter of heat; now if the heat, which occasions the oxy∣gen
and azote of the atmosphere to exist uncombined in the form
of gasses, be attracted from them by any other material, as they
are confined in the cavities of the soil, they may by their nearer
approach to each other combine into nitrous acid; or the oxy∣gen
may in its fluid state, not in its aerial one, more readily
unite with carbone; and form a fluid, not an aerial, car∣bonic
acid; which we believe to be of so much consequence in
the growth of plants, as shewn in Sect. X. 4.</P>
<P>Add to this, that if any putrefactive process be proceeding,
where atmospheric air is thus imprisoned in the cavities of the
soil, and by the loss of its heat is converted from a gas to a fluid;
that the azote may unite with the hydrogen of the decomposing
water, or contribute to decompose it; and thus to form volatile
alkali, which like the nitrous acid, may either during the pro∣cess
of its formation, or after it is formed, be of effectual ser∣vice
to vegetation, at the same time the oxygen given out from
the decomposing water may contribute like that of the atmos∣phere
to produce carbonic, nitrous, or phosphoric acids; and
thus to render carbon, phosphorus, and the basis of nitre, capa∣ble
of being absorbed by vegetable lacteals.</P>
<P>Where atmospheric air is confined along with water, I well
remember from experiments I made along ago, by inverting a
bottle filled with air in a jar of water, that the bulk of the air
was in some days so much diminished as to occupy only half the
bottle, which probably occurs from the decomposition of both
the water and air; and the production of ammonia and nitrous
acid, both which are believed to be so serviceable to vegetation,
as mentioned in Sect. X. 2. 9.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="264"/>
That the heat of the atmospheric air is given out, when
oxygen unites with carbon, is shewn by the heat of hot∣beds;
and of fermenting saccharine and mucilaginous fluids, as
in the production of ardent spirit; and may be beautifully seen
in the combination of oxygen with carbon in the burning of
one of those common letter-wafers, which consist of the muci∣lage
of flour, and red lead or minium; not one of those, which
are called Irish wafers, and which are coloured with vermilion.
If one of these minium wafers be made to blaze in the flame of
a candle, the oxygen contained in the minium unites with the
carbon of the flour, and gives out a very luminous spark, and
consequent great heat, and at the same instant a small globule
of melted lead drops down, and may be agreeably seen, if re∣ceived
on a sheet of white paper held under it. It is also pro∣bable,
that heat is emitted during the production of nitrous and
of phosphoric acids.</P>
<P>From these observations it appears, that seeds should be sown,
and roots planted, soon after the soil is turned over; while the
production of the carbonic, nitrous, and phosphoric acids, and
of volatile alkali, and perhaps many other processes, are pro∣ceeding,
rather than after they are completed; and also while
the fluid element of heat is passing from its combined state, and
permeating the soil, which in this cold climate in the vernal
months must be highly conducive to vegetation.</P>
<P>2. By thus turning over the soil with the plough or spade
the penetrability of it by the roots of plants is also much facili∣tated;
and for this purpose, as well as for the admixture of
atmospheric air, it can scarcely be reduced into too fine mole∣cules,
or a kind of wet powder; for the moisture of soil is as
necessary for its being permeated by the young roots of plants,
as its small cohesion, as mentioned in Sect. X. 3. 6.</P>
<P>Secondly, a more intimate mixture of the various ingredients
which most soils possess, as carbon, calcareous, argillaceous,
siliceous, and magnesian earths, with various metallic oxydes,
as those of iron, and sometimes of manganese and calamy, all
which by frequent turning over the soil with the plough or spade,
become mixed so as to act on each other or on the roots of vege∣tables
in every minute part of the soil.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="265"/>
And thirdly, the vernal rains are retained by their sinking
more readily into the pores and cells of land recently turned
over, and which still possesses an uneven surface. Besides a
greater surface of it being continually exposed to the passing
air, and to the heavier impurities, which it perpetually contains,
as carbonic acid, soot, odours of many kinds.</P>
<P>3. A recapitulation of these circumstances leads us to the
knowledge of the use of fallowing lands, by repeatedly turning
them over much carbonic acid is produced in its fluid state;
and perhaps some of the nitrous and phosphoric acids; these may
remain united with the vegetable recrements, or with volatile
alkali, or with calcareous earth. 2. The parts of the soil may
become better mixed together, and thus either chemically affect
each other to their mutual melioration; or they may more uni∣formly
supply nutriment to the roots, which penetrate it.
3. The soil may become broken into a moist powder, and may
thus be more easily permeated, and supply a greater surface of
its cavities for the vegetable absorbents to apply themselves to.
4. Unprofitable plants, or weeds, not being permitted to grow on
it, or their being perpetually ploughed under the soil in their
early growth, much vegetable nutriment will be reserved by not
being expended; or it will be increased by the saccharine and
mucilaginous matter of the young plants, which are thus buried
in it.</P>
<P>It should be added, that some plants are said not to impo∣verish
the ground, on which they have grown during their her∣baceous
state, before the seed-stems have arisen; as turnips,
when drawn up and carried away to feed cattle or sheep on other
grounds. This has been ascribed by some authors to the soil
having been shaded by their thick foliage, and thus not having
suffered so much by evaporation. Some have ascribed this sup∣posed
melioration of the soil to its having been screened or
overshadowed by the thicker foliage of such crops; and that as
the putrefactive process of vegetable recrements proceeds best
in damp and confined air, as wood decays soonest in cellars,
they suppose the soil may thus become improved. But Mr.
Tull seems either to doubt the fact, or to attribute it to the
ground, where such plants are cultivated, being usually once
<PB N="260" REF="266"/>
or twice hoed; and thus in effect to have been followed by the
repeated aeration and pulverization of the soil, and the destruc∣tion
of innumerable weeds.</P>
<P>If nevertheless the fact be true, not only all the circumstances
above mentioned may contribute to produce it, but also, as it
appears by the experiments of Priestley and Ingenhouz, that
though the perspirable matter of vegetable leaves gives out oxy∣gen
in the sunshine, yet that it gives out carbonic acid in the
shade; which even in its aerial or gasseous form is much heavier
than common air, and will therefore subside on the earth in the
shade of this perspiring foliage, and contribute to enrich the
soil by the hourly addition of carbon.</P>
<P>4. Nevertheless where the soil is already replete with ma∣nures,
and these processes productive of carbonic, nitrous, and
phosphoric acids, and of volatile alkali, are going on in proper
abundance; such soils must be injured by being too frequently
turned over in summer fallowing; and thus by exposing too
great a surface, and that too frequently, to the air, the sun∣shine,
and the rain; by which much of the fluid carbonic acid
will be converted into aerial carbonic acid, and escape, as well
as the phosphorus and the ingredients in their state previous to
the production of nitrous acid, and of the volatile alkali. On
this account in the manufacture of nitre in France, Spain, and
Prussia, it is directed to cover the compost of soil and animal
recrements with a shed to prevent too great exhalation and
ablution. Hence though a summer fallow may be of advantage
to a poor soil, which has nothing to lose; it must be disadvan∣tageous
to a rich one, which has nothing to gain.</P>
<P>Lord Dundonald in his work on the Connection of Agricul∣ture
and Chemistry ingeniously supposes, that soils become in∣jured,
when much exposed to the air by fallowing, from the
carbon or other inflammable matters uniting with oxygen; and
that then being again combined with other materials, they be∣come
insoluble, producing limestone, calcareous nitre, and phos∣phat
of lime. But there is another injury to soil by frequent
fallowing, which I suspect to be more extensive, from the es∣cape
of carbonic acid, or of nitrous acid, or of ammonia, into
<PB N="261" REF="267"/>
the atmosphere in the form of gas, as above mentioned; or their
being washed away by rains.</P>
<P>5. Hence the great advantages of Mr. Tull's ingenious dis∣covery
of the drill husbandry are easily understood. 1. By sow∣ing
the wheat in rows, scattered by a drill-plough at regular
distances, and buried at a regular depth, the grain is neither
crowded, nor too thinly dispersed. 2. Nor are the roots bu∣ried
either too deep in the soil, or too shallow. 3. By turn∣ing
the soil first from the rows in the spring for a week or two,
and then turning it up against the rows, the soil becomes newly
aerated with all the good effects in consequence. 4. It becomes
more penetrable by the superficial roots of the corn. 5. By
raising it to the second joint of the corn-stems, four or six new
roots with new stems will shoot out, generated by the caudex
of the second leaf of the corn-stem; which is now within the
soil, or in contact with it, as explained in Sect. IX. 3. 1. and
7. XVI. 2. 2.</P>
<P>Thus Mr. Tull's method of heaping soil against wheat-plants
up to the second joint answers in some degree the same purpose,
as transplanting the roots, and setting them deeper in the soil
with much less expence of labour. But for the more perfect
pulverization of the soil, and the more complete aeration of it,
he insists much on the preference of horse-hoeing to hand-hoe∣ing;
as the former passes deeper into the soil, and thus exposes
a greater quantity of it to the air; and especially of that part
of it, which before lay too much beneath the surface to be pre∣viously
much affected by the incumbent atmosphere. But the
great objection to the use of the horse-hoe is, that the alternate
rows of corn must be placed at too great a distance, as will be
again spoken of in Sect. XVI. 2. 2.</P>
<P>To the many advantages of the drill husbandry above recited
Mr. Tull adds, that “where the spring-turnips are used too
late in the year, there is not time to bring the land into tilth
for barley, and there is a loss of the barley crop in consequence;
which he says is entirely remedied by the drilling method; for
by that the land may be almost as well tilled before the turnips
are eaten or taken off, as it can afterwards.” Husbandry, Chap.
VIII. p. 89.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="268"/>
So many great advantages seem to accrue from Mr. Tull's
method of drill-sowing and horse-hoeing, that a curious question
offers itself, Why it has not been more generally adopted? First,
I suppose, because it is difficult to teach any thing new to adult
ignorance, so that the master must for some time attend the
process with his own eye. Secondly, I believe the axle-tree
of Mr. Tull's sowing machine did not accurately emit the pro∣per
quantity of seed from the hopper, and was liable to bruise
and destroy some of it in its passage. And thirdly, that the
improved drill machine of Mr. Cook's patent is too expensive
for the purchase of small farmers, who fear that it may not an∣swer
the expected advantages.</P>
<P>I have therefore given a print at the end of this work of a
machine constructed on a cheaper plan, which is simply an im∣provement
of that described in Mr. Tull's book, by enlarging
that part of the axle-tree which delivers the grain, into a cylin∣der
of some inches diameter with excavations in the rim; which
rim rises above the surface of the corn in the seed-box, and lets
drop again into the seed-box, whatever grains fill the holes above
the level of the rim, as that side of the cylinder ascends.
Whence the quantity delivered is uniform, and no grains are in
the way to be bruised or injured, as explained at large along
with the print; and the whole machine is simple, and of small
expence.</P>
<P>6. The most effectual method of obtaining the great combin∣ed
advantages of aeration and pulverization of the soil is by trans∣planting
the roots of wheat, and parting them, as already spoken
of in Sect. IX. 3. 7. By taking up the roots and replanting
them in soil lately turned over, and consequently exposed to
the air, which is now con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined in its interstices, all the advan∣tages
already mentioned are effectually received, from the new
made fluid, carbonic, nitrous, and phosphoric acids, and from
the ammonia, and other unnamed combinations. Secondly, all
the advantages arising from the easy penetrability of the loose soil
by the root-fibres, which are believed by Mr. Tull to put out
more radicles with absorbent mouths at every part, where they
are dissevered, like a brush or pencil of hairs. Thirdly, by
parting the root-scions from each other they acquire greater space
<PB N="263" REF="269"/>
of air for their respiring leaves, and of soil for their absorbent
roots. Whereas when too many stems arise from one root, or
many seeds are sown near together, a tussock is produced in a
conical form rising highest in the center; which seems to be
occasioned by the contest of the stems for air and light; their
roots also must descend lower in their contest for moisture,
and for other advantages of the soil; whence many of these crowded
stems become barren, producing no ears, or ill-corned ones.</P>
<P>Another benefit from transplanting corn is owing to the
quicker tendency to fructification, and consequent sooner ripen∣ing
of the grain. Thus transplanted garden beans and trans∣planted
brocoli flower sooner, and I suppose produce less stems or
straw, as mentioned in Sect. XVI. 1. 2. I am also well informed
by the Rev. Mr. Pole of Radborne, that the roots of those tur∣nips,
which were drawn out of the ground and transplanted,
became considerably larger than those, which were only hoed
in the common manner; which I suppose to have been owing
to many of the extremities of the roots having been torn off in
drawing them out of the ground; and that thence the tendency
to shoot up the new central stem is delayed, and the reservoir
of nourishment accumulated in the tuberous root is thus increas∣ed
in quantity, as several of these turnips weighed ten and eleven
pounds; and hence probably the transplanting turnips by means
of a cylindrical spade described in Vol. IV. of the Bath Society,
which tears the roots less, might not have been so advantageous.
Something similar occurs in transplanting fruit-trees. See Sect.
XV. 2. 4.</P>
<P>But the great advantage of transplanting wheat above the
drill-husbandry consists in being able at the same time to divide
the root-scions from each other; and thus not only to prevent
their crowding each other, but also wonderfully to increase the
product from a single grain, with many other advantages men∣tioned
by Mr. Bogle in the works of the Bath Society, Vol.
III. p. 494.</P>
<P>Another great advantage of transplanting wheat consists in
this, that it may be sowed in a garden, one acre of which will
produce sets for one hundred acres, if they be divided and plant∣ed
at nine inches distance from each other; and as they are not
<PB N="264" REF="270"/>
to be transplanted till the spring, wheat may be thus cultivated
in moister situations than would otherwise be friendly to its
growth.</P>
<P>And that a clean crop may be crtainly thus procured; because
if the land be ploughed immediately before the plants are set
out, the corn will spring much quicker from the plants, than
the weeds from their seeds; and the corn will thence bear down
the growth of the weeds.</P>
<P>For many other particulars the reader is referred to the in∣genious
paper of Mr. Bogle above mentioned, who thinks the
transplanting might be done by boys and girls at a small expence;
I shall only add, that rape-seed, which is generally sown in
August, and not reaped till the August following, might be
profitably transplanted, as well as peas and beans. And lastly;
that it is probable, that some means of making the holes to re∣ceive
the plants might be much expedited by a broad wheel to
be drawn by a man or horse with prominent pegs on its peri∣phery
two inches tall, and nine inches asunder.</P>
<P>7. Another means of aeration and of pulverization has been
used in respect to wheat crops by many with advantage, and that
is by drawing a lightish harrow over a wheat-crop in the spring,
which, where a crop is thin, is particularly recommended; and
may also be of service where it is too thick.</P>
<P>The harrow by breaking the clods, and by turning up the soil
against the stems of many plants▪ earths them deeper as in hoe∣ing;
and thus by burying the second joint occasions it to tiller,
or shoot out new root-scions; at the same time the earth is
exposed to the air, and many weeds are rooted up and covered,
and some roots of the corn.</P>
<P>The drawing a sharp harrow over a field of wheat in the
spring must cut or tear many of the roots of those stems, which
it comes near, which according to Mr. Tull's theory would
shoot out many new radicles, or pencils of fine roots, and thus
acquire more nourishment. But I suspect that tearing of many
of the root-fibres prevents the too luxuriant growth of the stem
and leaves, and thence sooner produces the fructification, as in
transplanting. At the same time the earth being loosened be∣comes
more penetrable to the remaining roots, as well as more
nutritive from its aeration.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="271"/>
Others have even ploughed a field at this season with good ef∣fect,
as Mr. Bogle asserts; but both of them appear to be only
inferior kinds of drill husbandry; and the former may so far be
of considerable utility.</P>
<P>8. Another method of aerating and pulverizing the soil of a
wheat field in spring is by rolling it, which may be done before
or after the use of the harrow, or without it. As the surface of
a wheat field is generally left rough with clods or eminences, the
pressure of a heavyish roller will not only pulverize these, and
thus expose their interior surface to the air, and raise the soil
round the wheat-stems above the second joint, and thus induce
them to shoot out new root-scions, or tiller; but will also press
down the wheat roots into the soil, and thus also promote the
growth of new stems as mentioned in Sect. XVI. 2. 5. if it be
performed, when the ground is neither too wet nor too dry for
such an operation.</P>

<P>I. 1. PHILOSOPHERS are not yet agreed, whether light and
heat be the same fluid under different modifications, or two dif∣ferent
fluids, which exist frequently together. The latter opi∣nion
seems to be more probable from the circumstances related
below, and also from the analogy of other aqueous, aerial, or
ethereal fluids which appear to consist of two other fluids com∣bined
or diffused with each other. Thus water consists of oxy∣gen
and hydrogen combined together. Atmospheric air of
oxygen and nitrogen diffused together. Electricity probably
consists of two fluids, which may be termed vitreous and resin∣ous
electricity. Magnetism also probably consists of two fluids,
which constitute northern and southern polarity. The power
of attraction seems to consist of gravitation and of chemical
affinity. And lastly, the element of fire consists I suppose of
light and heat.</P>
<P>The dissimilarity of light and heat is evinced by this simple
circumstance; that as light gives no heat to transparent bodies,
which the emanations from a fire do, there is reason to believe
them to be different fluids. Thus when smoke is blown near the
focus of a large burning glass, it does not ascend: which shews,
that the air is not heated and rarified by it; though it would
burn or vitrify in an instant any opake body, which might be op∣posed
to it; but the emanations of heat from a fire soon rarify
and warm the air in its vicinity, causing it to ascend, as may be
seen by a spiral card-vann placed over a chimney-piece, and
which is agreeably seen in the use of the new glass fire-screens of
Parisian invention, which placed before a parlour fire permit the
rays of light to pass, but intercept the emanations of fluid heat.</P>
<P>Whence it would seem, that light does not itself communicate
heat to opake bodies, when it falls on them; but combines with
them, and by that union heat is detruded or given out; which
heat may produce inflammation of the material, if it be of an
<PB N="268" REF="274"/>
inflammable nature, by uniting it with the oxygen of the atmos∣phere;
and thus producing an eduction of more heat from the
oxygen, and greater inflammation of the burning body.</P>
<P>2. Another essential difference between light and heat consists
in the particular attraction of the former to oxygen; insomuch
that by their union the combined or solid oxygen becomes
changed into an aerial, or gasseous state; as constantly occurs,
when the sun shines on the hyper-oxygenated water, which is
perspired or exhaled from plants, as mentioned in Botanic
Garden, Vol. I. Cant. IV. l. 25. But as an addition of heat
seems necessary to the conversion of a solid or fluid body into
an aerial or gasseous one, I suppose the sun's light at the same
time by combining also with the water sets at liberty some latent
heat from it, which gives wings to the oxygen.</P>
<P>The water perspired by plants, when exposed to the sunshine,
is believed to be decomposed, as it escapes from the fine extre∣mities
of the exhalent or perspirative vessels of plants; and that
the hydrogen is reabsorbed by the mouths of those vessels, as
explained in Botanic Garden, Vol. I. note 34. That this hap∣pens
to a certain degree is evinced by etiolated or blanched vege∣table
leaves becoming green, when exposed to the sunshine in a
few days; which is, I believe, produced by their retaining the
hydrogen of the water they perspire, as it is decomposed by the
sun's light.</P>
<P>But it is also probable, that the perspired fluid of plants is pre∣viously
hyper-oxygenated in the vegetable circulation. First,
because there is never perceived any smell of hydrogen to attend
this process of liberating oxygen by the sun's light. And se∣condly,
because the following productions of oxygen gas by the
sun's light are similar phenomena; though I suppose the points
or hairs on vegetable leaves may contribute to the escape of the
oxygen, as explained in Botanic Garden, Vol. I. note 10.</P>
<P>Sir Benj. Thompson, now Count Rumford, in a paper pub∣lished
in Philos. Transact. Vol. LXXVII. put thirty grains of
raw silk previously washed into some spring water, and exposing it
some hours to the sunshine obtained from it very pure vital air,
or oxygen gas. In that experiment the spring water seems to
have been in a state of hyper-oxygenation, and the points or
<PB N="269" REF="275"/>
sine edges of the raw silk to have assisted its liberation from the
water in the sunshine, as explained in Botanic Garden, Vol. II.
note on fucus. 2. The hyper-oxygenated marine acid is known
very hastily to part with its superabundant oxygen in the sun∣shine.
3. Mr. Scheele inverted a glass vessel filled with co∣lourless
nitrous acid into another glass-vessel containing the same
acid; and on exposing them to the sun's light, the inverted
glass became partly filled with pure air, and the acid at the same
time became coloured. Crell's Annal. 1786.</P>
<P>As water contains 85 hundreth parts of oxygen to 15 of hy∣drogen,
it may become much oxygenated occasionally by a small
loss of hydrogen in the vegetable system; or by the carbonic
acid being decomposed in plants by the secretion of carbon,
which constitutes so great a part of them; and that on both of
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se accounts they may yield oxygen gas, when exposed to the
sun's light, as appears from the following experiment related from
Von Uslar by G. Schmeisser. Observat. on Plants. Creech,
Edinburgh, p. 92.</P>
<P>If two branches of a plant are immersed, one in common wa∣ter,
and the other in water impregnated with carbonie acid, we
then find, that the branch immersed in the latter yields a much
greater quantity of oxygenous gas in the sunshine than the other.
The difference in some experiments has been found in the pro∣portion
of 264 to 1. But the proportions vary when different
plants are subjected to trial. Thus the carbonic acid, with which
the water is impregnated, is decomposed by the branch, the car∣bon
apparently enters into the constitution of the plant, while
the oxygen is set at liberty, and escapes in the form of gas in the
sunshine; but not in the night, as then the carbon is perspired
along with it.</P>
<P>3. A third circumstance, in which the effects of light differ
essentially from those of heat, appears in the blanching or etiola∣tion
of vegetables; under whatever temperature of heat a plant
is kept, it becomes white, if the light be excluded from it, and
is so far diseased, as mentioned in Sect. XIV. 2. 4. Whence
all vegetables turn towards the window, if confined in a room,
and in dense woods grow taller, than in open grounds, for the
purpose of acquiring access to this necessary fluid. On this sub∣ject
<PB N="270" REF="276"/>
many experiments are related by M. Senebier on vegetables
confined in a dark cavern.</P>
<P>From the experiment last related of the nitrous acid becoming
coloured, when the superabundant oxygen was volatilized by the
sun's light, or attracted from it; and from the experiments of
bleaching cotton by the hyper-oxygenated marine acid, where
the union of oxygen with the colouring matter seems to destroy
the latter by forming a new acid, which is colourless, it appears,
that the absence of oxygen occasions the colour of vegetable bo∣dies,
probably by the accumulation of hydrogen; and that on
this account, when they are secluded from the light, they be∣come
white or blanched, or etiolated, by their not being in a
situation to part with so much oxygen, as when they are exposed
to the light.</P>
<P>Hence plants growing in the shade are white, and become
green by being exposed to the sun's light; for their natural co∣lour
being blue, the addition of hydrogen adds yellow to this
blue, and <HI>tans</HI> them green.</P>
<P>I suppose a similar circumstance takes place in animal bodies;
their perspirable matter is probably hyper-oxygenated; and, as
it escapes in the sunshine, loses its superabundant oxygen; and
by the hydrogen being retained the skin becomes <HI>tanned</HI> yellow.
Though this must occur in less quantity in animals, as they per∣spire
so much less than vegetables; and the greatest part of their
perspired matter, which exhales from the lungs, is not exposed
to the sun's light. In proof of this it must be observed, that
both vegetable and animal substances become bleached white by
the sun-beams and water, when they are dead, as cabbage∣stalks,
bones, ivory, tallow, bees-wax, linen and cotton cloth;
and hence, I suppose, the copper coloured natives of sunny
countries might become etiolated, or blanched, by being kept
from their infancy in the dark, or removed for a few genera∣tions
to more northern climates.</P>
<P>It is probable, that on a sunny morning much pure air be∣comes
separated from the dew by means of the points of ve∣getables,
on which it adheres, and much inflammable air imbib∣ed
by the vegetable, or combined with it; and, by the sun's
<PB N="271" REF="277"/>
light thus decomposing water, the effects of it in bleaching
linen seem to depend; the water is decomposed by the light
at the ends or points of the cotton or thread; and the vital
air unites with the phlogistic or colouring matters of the
cloth; and produces a new acid, which is either itself colour∣less,
or washes out; at the same time the hydrogen or inflam∣mable
part of the water escapes. Hence there seems a reason,
why cotton bleaches so much sooner than linen; viz. because
its fibres are three or four times shorter, and therefore protrude
so many more points; which seem to facilitate the liberation of
the vital air from the inflammable part of the water.</P>
<P>A sun-flower three feet and a half high, according to the ex∣periment
of Dr. Hales, perspired two pints in one day, (vege∣table
statics) which is many times as much in proportion to its
surface, as is perspired from the surface and lungs of animal bo∣dies;
it follows, that the vital air, liberated from the surface
of plants by the sunshine, must much exceed the quantity of it
absorbed by their respiration; and that hence they improve the
air, in which they live, during the light part of the day; and
thus blanched vegetables will sooner become <HI>tanned</HI> into green
by the sun's light, than etiolated animal bodies will become
<HI>tanned</HI> yellow by the same means.</P>
<P>Lastly. This retention of the hydrogen on the skins of vege∣tables
and animals, when their perspirable matter is decomposed
by the sun's light, and by which the former becomes green, and
the latter yellow, is evidently owing to the power of life; be∣cause
when either of them are dead, the action of the sunshine
on the water sprinkled on them again blanches them, or bleaches
them white.</P>
<P>It is hence evident, that the curious discovery of Dr. Priest∣ley,
that his green vegetable matter, and other aquatic plants,
gave out vital air, when the sun shone upon them; and the
leaves of other plants did the same when immersed in water, as
observed by Mr. Ingenhouz, refer to the perspiration of vege∣tables,
not to their respiration. Because Dr. Priestley observ∣ed
the pure air to come from both sides of the leaves, and even
from the stalks of a water-flag, whereas one side of the leaf
only serves the office of lungs, and certainly not the stalks.
<PB N="272" REF="278"/>
Exper. on Air, Vol. III. And thus in respect to the circum∣stance,
in which plants and animals seemed the farthest remov∣ed
from each other, I mean in their supposed mode of respira∣tion,
by which one was believed to purify the air, which the
other had injured, they seem to differ only in degree; and the
analogy between them remains unbroken.</P>
<P>4. The contest for light, as well as for air, which is so visi∣ble
in the growth of vegetables, as described in Botanic Garden,
Vol. II. note on cuscuta, shews the former to be of great con∣sequence
to their existence as well as the latter. Thus many
flowers follow the sun during the course of the day by the nu∣tation
of the stalks, not by the rotation of them, as observed in
the sun-flower by Dr. Hales; and the leaves of all plants en∣deavour
to turn their upper surface to the light, which is their
respiratory organ, or lungs, as shewn in Sect. IV.</P>
<P>The great use of all plants turning their upper surfaces of
their leaves to the light is thus intelligible; the water perspired
from those furfaces is hyper-oxygenated; and, as it escapes from
the sharp edges of the mouths of the perspiring vessels, when
acted upon by the sun's light, gives out oxygen; which oxygen,
thus liberated from the perspired water, and added to that of the
common atmosphere, presents to the respiratory terminations of
the pulmonary arteries on the upper surfaces of leaves an atmos∣phere
more replete with vital air.</P>
<P>This necessity of light to the respiration of vegetables is so
great, that there is reason to believe, that many plants do not
respire during the night, but exist in a torpid state like winter
sleeping insects. Thus the mimosa, sensible plant, and many
others, close the upper surfaces of their opposite leaves together
during the night, and thus preclude them both from the air and
light. And the internal surfaces of innumerable flowers, which
are their respiratory organs, are closed during the night, and
thus unexposed both to light and air.</P>
<P>The fungi nevertheless, which are termed vegetables, because
they are fixed to the earth, or to the stones, or trees, or
timber, where they are sound, can exist without light or much
air; as appears in the truffle, which never appears above ground;
and by other fungi, which grow in dark cellars; and in esculent
<PB N="273" REF="279"/>
mushrooms, which are cultivated beneath beds of straw. From
this circumstance of their existing without light, and from their
smell of volatile alkali, like burnt feathers, when they are burnt,
and from their taste when cooked and eaten, they seem to ap∣proximate
to the animal kingdom.</P>
<P>5. Lastly. It may nevertheless be suspected, that in many
of the experiments of Dr. Priestley and Dr. Ingenhouz, the
production of vital air might be simply owing to the action of
the sun's light on the water, in which the vegetables were im∣mersed,
like that from the silk in the experiment of Count
Rumford; and that the fine points, or sharp edges of those
bodies, contributed only to facilitate the liberation of it, when
exposed to the sunshine, which thus disoxygenate the water by
their united effect.</P>
<P>This appears on immersing a dry hairy leaf in water fresh
from a pump, innumerable globules like quicksilver appear on
almost every point; for the extremities of these points attract
the particles of water less forcibly, than those particles attract
each other; hence the contained air, whose elasticity was but
just balanced by the attractive power of the surrounding particles
of water to each other, finds at the point of each sibre a place,
where the resistance to its expansion is less; and in consequence
it there expands, and becomes a bubble of air. It is easy to
foresee, that the rays of the sunshine, by being refracted and in
part reflected by the two surfaces of these minute air-bubbles,
must impart to them much more heat than to the transparent
water; and thus facilitate their ascent by further expanding
them; and that the points of vegetables attract the particles of
water less, than they attract each other, is seen by the spherical
form of dew-drops on the points of grass.</P>
<P>6. It may be added in this place, that there may also be a
fallacy in the supposed results of those experiments, where plants
have been confined in hydrogen or azote mixed with atmosphe∣ric
air; and have been believed to have vegetated more vigo∣rously,
and to have meliorated the air. In these experiments
I suspect, that the impure part of the air was attracted by the
water, and taken up by the absorbents of the roots of the plants
from the water, rather than by the absorbents of their leaves or
<PB N="274" REF="280"/>
stems in the air; and that the melioration of the air was occa∣sioned,
as above described, by the action of the light on the
water perspired from the surface of the plant, or liberated by its
points from the water, with which part of it was covered. This
is rendered more probable, because plants and seeds in the ex∣periments
of others ceased to vegetate in those gasses, which
were totally deprived of oxygen, as in M. Scheele's experiments
on the growth of seeds.</P>
<P>II. 1. The fluid matter of heat is one of the most extensive
elements in nature, perhaps next to that of gravitation; all other
bodies are immersed in it, and are preserved in their present
state of solidity or fluidity by the different attraction of their
particles to the matter of heat, which thus counteracts the powers
of gravitation, and of chemical affinity, which would otherwise
compress them into one solid chaotic mass!</P>
<P>Since all known bodies are contractible into less space by
depriving them of some portion of their heat; and as there is
no part of nature totally deprived of heat; there is reason to
believe, that the particles of bodies do not touch, but are held
towards each other by their self-attraction, or recede from each
other by their attraction to the mass of heat, which surrounds
them; and thus exist in an equilibrium between these two
powers.</P>
<P>If more of the matter of heat be applied to them, they re∣cede
farther from each other, and become fluid; if still more be
applied, they take an aerial form, and are termed gasses; and it
is probable, that the ethereal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luid of electricity may also be dif∣fused
with heat, as well as the ethereal fluid of light.</P>
<P>Thus w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n water is heated to a certain degree, it would in∣stantly
assume the form of steam, but for the pressure of the at∣mosphere;
which prevents this change from taking place so
easily; the same is true of quicksilver, diamonds, and of perhaps
all other bodies in nature; they would first become fluid, and
then aeriform, by appropriated degrees of heat. On the con∣trary,
this elastic matter of heat, termed Calorique in the new
nomenclature of the French academicians, is liable to become
consolidated itself in its combinations with some bodies, as cer∣tainly
<PB N="275" REF="281"/>
in nitre, and probably in combustible bodies, as sulphur
and charcoal.</P>
<P>This combined heat is universally set at liberty in the produc∣tion
of acids by the union of oxygen with all inflammable bodies,
as shewn in Sect. XII. 1. It is also taken from some bodies by
the vicinity of very cold ones, as water when frozen loses sud∣denly
a part of its combined heat, at the moment it becomes
ice.</P>
<P>2. It is evident, that without fluidity the blood or juices can
not circulate in animal or in vegetable vessels; whence so great
a diminution of heat as to produce frost on this account would
destroy them if long continued; at the same time too a great
deduction of heat is known to destroy the irritability of animal
as well as of vegetable fibres, and must on this account also
prevent the circulation of their fluids, and occasion the mortifi∣cation
of parts of them, or the death of the whole. But when
fluids are converted into ice, the bulk of them is enlarged to a
considerable degree, and that with such violence as to burst iron
vessels, as bombs, which are filled with water. Whence in
this manner also frost destroys those parts of vegetables, which
are most succulent; as the early shoots of ash trees, and other
young plants, are frequently destroyed in the beginning of May
by a frosty night.</P>
<P>The vessels of these succulent parts of plants are distended and
burst by the expansion of their frozen fluids; while the drier or
more resinous vegetables, as pines, yews, aulrels, and other
evergreens, are less liable to injury from cold. The trees in
valleys are on this account more liable to injury by the vernal
frosts, than those on eminences; because their early succulent
shoots appear sooner in the year.</P>
<P>Another method, by which the act of freezing may destroy
vegetable life, may be by separating some part of their fluids
from other parts of them. Thus when wine, or vinegar, or salt
and water, or clay diffused in water, and perhaps milk, are
frozen; the watery part, as it congeals, protrudes from its form∣ing
crystals the spirit, the acid, the salt, the clay, and probably
the opake particles of the milk; and by a similar process on
vegetable and perhaps on animal fluids, when exposed to great
<PB N="276" REF="282"/>
cold, they may be rendered unfit for future circulation or life.
See Sect. XV. 4. 1.</P>
<P>The expansion of ice nevertheless well accounts for the greater
mischief which is sometimes done by vernal frost, when preceded
by much rain, or mist, or dew, as by hoar-frost, than by the
dry frosts without rime, called black frosts; as the vegetable
vessels are then fuller of fluids. But when mist or dew attends
a frosty night, but has not preceded it, I suppose a hoar frost
may be less injurious than a black frost; as the case of ice on
the buds of trees, or on young grass, being instantly produced,
covers them with a bad conductor of heat, and prevents them
from being exposed to so great cold, as in the continuance of a
black frost without hoar or rime. See Sect. XV. 3. 5.</P>
<P>Mr. Laurence, in a letter to Mr. Bradley, complains, that
the dalemist attended with a frost on May-day had destroyed all
his tender fruits; though there was a sharper frost the night be∣fore
without a mist, that did him no injury; and adds, that a
garden not a stone's throw from his own on a higher situation,
being above the dale-mist, had received no damage. Bradley,
V. II. p. 232. From this instructive fact it appears, that very
low situations even in this cold climate are not proper for the
purposes of a garden. And on the contrary, very high situa∣tions
are equally improper on account of their greater cold, and
the consequent backwardness of their vegetable products. See
Sect. XV. 3. 5.</P>
<P>Hence fruit trees against a wall, which are covered with
coping stones projecting six inches over them, are less injured
by the vernal frosts; because their being thus sheltered from
the descending night-dews has prevented them from being moist
at the time, they were frozen; which circumstance has given
risen to a vulgar error amongst gardeners, whose suppose frost to
descend.</P>
<P>Hence as the freezing winds of this country are from the
north-east, a gardener should extend his rows of young peas and
beans from the south-east to the north-west, and raise a mound
of earth behind them, and might shelter them occasionally with
straw, placed on the ground behind the young plants, and sup∣ported
<PB N="277" REF="283"/>
a few inches over them in front by poles placed horizon∣tally
over the rows; remembering the old proverb,
<Q><L>The wind from north-east</L>
<L>Destroys man and beast;</L>
<L>The wind from south-west</L>
<L>Is always the best.</L></Q></P>
<P>The immediate cause of the coldness of the N. E. winds is,
that they consist of regions of air brought from the north over
evaporating ice, and gain an apparent easterly direction, because
they arrive at a part of the surface of the earth, which moves
with greater velocity, than the surface of the part of the earth,
they come from. So on the contrary the S. W. winds are
warm, as they consist of regions of air brought from the south,
and gain an apparent westerly direction, because they arrive at a
part of the earth's surface which moves slower than the surface
nearer the equator, whence they came, and of which they had
previously acquired the velocity.</P>
<P>As the common heat of the earth in this climate is 48 de∣grees,
those tender trees, which will bear bending down, are
easily secured from the frost by spreading them upon the ground,
and covering them with straw or fern. This particularly suits
sig-trees, as they are very flexible, and as they are furnished
with an acrid juice, which defends them from insects; but I
have nevertheless found them in this situation much eaten by
mice.</P>
<P>It has been believed by many, that frost meliorates the
ground; but it is now well known, that ice contains no nitrous
particles, as was formerly supposed; and that though frost by
enlarging the bulk of some moist soils may leave them more po∣rous
for a time after the thaw; yet as the water exhales, the
soil becomes as hard as before, being pressed together by the
incumbent atmosphere. And from an observation of Mr. Kir∣wan's,
mentioned in Section XV. 4. 1. it appears, that moist
clay becomes denser or more solid by being frozen; and if this
should not occur, yet it would quickly become as solid as be∣fore
by the self-attraction of its particles, called <HI>setting</HI> by the
potters; as well as by the pressure of the atmosphere; as its
<PB N="278" REF="284"/>
water exhales, and leaves vacuities between its particles. Add
to this, that on the coasts of Africa, where frost is unknown,
the fertility of the soil is much superior to our own.</P>
<P>In respect to the commonly supposed salubrity of frosty sea∣sons
to mankind, and to other animals, the bills of mortality
are an evidence in the negative in respect to mankind, as in long
frosts many weakly and old people perish from debility, occa∣sioned
by the diminished heat not being sufficient to excite into
action their vessels previously too inirritable; and many birds,
and other wild animals, and tender vegetables, perish benumb∣ed
by the degree and continuance of the cold.</P>
<P>It should however be observed, as frosty air is always dry,
except when frozen mists dissolve, as they adhere to the warmer
skins of animals, that it does not generally affect us with so
great a sensation of cold, as when air near the freezing point is
loaded with moisture; as the moisture of such air is perpetually
evaporating from our skins, and produces on them a degree of
cold greater than the simple contact of dry air produces, when
it is but a little beneath the freezing point. Hence frosty air is
more agreeable to those young or strong people, who can keep
themselves warm by exercise; that is, who can generate heat
by increased secretions. But severe and continued frosts de∣story
the old and infirm, who cannot use much exertion; and
the children of the poor, who want both food, fire, and cloth∣ing,
in this harsh climate.</P>
<P>It may nevertheless be true, that snows of long duration in
our winters may be less injurious to vegetation than great rains
and shorter frosts. 1. Because great rains carry down many
thousand pounds worth of the best manure into the sea; whereas
snow dissolves gradually, the upper surface, as it thaws, sliding
over the under part, which remains frozen, and thence carries
away less from the land into the rivers; whence a snow flood
may be distinguished from a rain flood by the transparency of the
water.</P>
<P>Secondly. Snow protects vegetables from the severity of the
frost; since it is generally in a state of thaw, where it is in con∣tact
with the earth; as the earth's heat is 48 degrees, and that of
thawing snow is 32<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The plants between them are generally
<PB N="279" REF="285"/>
kept in a degree of heat about 40, by which many of them are
preserved. On this account some plants from Siberia were
said to perish by the frosts at Upsal; because the snows did not
commence at the same time as in the colder climate, from which
they were brought.</P>
<P>Thus the lichen rangiferinus, coral-moss, vegetates beneath
the snow in Siberia, where the degree of heat is always about
40; that is in the middle between the freezing point and the
common heat of the earth. And as this vegetable is for many
months of the winter the sole food of the rein-deer, who digs
furrows in the snow to find it; and as the milk and flesh of this
animal is almost the only sustenance, which can be procured by
the natives during the long winters of those higher latitudes,
this moss may be said to support some millions of mankind.</P>
<P>Snow protects vegetables, that are covered by it, from cold,
both because it is a bad conductor of heat itself, and contains
much air in its pores. When living animals are buried in snow,
as sheep, or hares, the water, which their warmth produces,
becomes absorbed into the surrounding snow by capillary attrac∣tion,
and the creatures are not moistened by its dropping on
them; but the cavity enlarges, as the snow dissolves, affording
them both a dry and a warm habitation. If this was generally
known, many cold and weary travellers in snowy nights might
be saved by covering themselves with snow instead of endeavour∣ing
to proceed.</P>
<P>It should be added that Hassenfratz has endeavoured to shew
by ingenious chemical experiments, that rain water and snow
contain both of them a redundancy of oxygen compared with
river water, which they may have acquired in their descent
through the atmosphere; and that as oxygen is shewn by the
experiments of Ingenhouz and Senebier to promote the growth
of seeds and of plants, he concludes, that rain water and snow
promote vegetation in a much greater degree than river water or
ice, which seems to accord with the popular observations on
this subject.</P>
<P>3. Mr. John Hunter by applying thermometers to the inter∣nal
parts of vegetables newly opened discovered, that they pos∣sessed
in frosty seasons a degree of heat above that of the atmos∣phere,
<PB N="280" REF="286"/>
though less than that of cold blooded animals. Whence
another deleterious effect of cold on vegetable bodies must be
by destroying their irritability, and by that means stopping the
absorption and circulation of their juices; in the same manner
as is seen in the pale b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>umbed fingers of some people, when
exposed to the cold; and which is the immediate cause of death
in those, who perish in the snow in winter, which occurs long
before their fluids are frozen.</P>
<P>The necessity of a certain degree of heat to produce or to
preserve the activity of the absorbent vessels of vegetables is
well evinced by the experiments of Hales and Duhamel on the
rising sap of vines in the vernal months. On a frosty day, when
the sun shone on one of those wounded trees, the sap flowed on
the south side of the tree, but not on the north side. Physique
des abres, Vol. II. p. 258. M. Duhamel further observes,
that the maples in Canada, where the frost is long and severe,
begin to bleed, when wounded with the first thaw, and stop
again when it freezes; and that this in frosty days occurs only
on the south side of the tree.</P>
<P>This acquaints us, that one of the principal properties of heat
in respect to organic bodies, whether of vegetables or animals,
consists in its acting as a stimulus; and that in a greater quan∣tity
than that, which the organized being has been accustomed
to, it acts as an excess of stimulus; and thus increases the acti∣vity
of the system in respect to the absorption of its food, circu∣lation
of its juices, and quantity of its secretions, and conse∣quently
to its more rapid growth; but all increase of stimulus
becomes injurious by its excess, and is certainly followed by
debility; as is seen in those of our own species, who are habi∣tually
kept in too warm rooms, or are accustomed to drink
intoxicating liquors.</P>
<P>Hence a wise gardener must regard the acquired habits of
tender vegetables; the inhabitants of his green house, and those
plants, which have been exposed to a greater heat for any length
of time, should be gradually cooled, and watered with subtepid
water; since exposing them to the cold of this climate is other∣wise
liable to destroy their irritability and occasion their
death.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="287"/>
4. The great cold produced by evaporation is now well
understood. In all chemical processes, where aerial or fluid
bodies become consolidated, a part of the heat, which was
before latent, becomes pressed out from the uniting particles;
as in the instant that water freezes, or that water unites with
quick lime. On the reverse, when solid bodies become fluid,
or fluid ones become aerial, heat is absorbed by the solution;
whence it may be said in popular language, that all chemical
combinations produce heat, and all chemical solutions produce
cold. This should teach the careful gardener not to water
tender vegetables in the heat of the sunshine, or in a warm dry wind;
lest the hasty evaporation should produce so much cold
as to destroy them; and that more certainly from their having
been previously too much stimulated by heat, and in consequence
their power of life, or irritability, having been already diminish∣ed;
as further spoken of in Sect. XIV. 2. 2.</P>
<P>III. 1. The mechanical theory of electricity invented by
Dr. Franklin is believed by some philosophers not so well to
explain the various phenomena of electricity, as may be ac∣complished
by an hypothesis of the existence of two electric
fluids diffused together, and strongly attracting each other, one
of them to be called vitreous, and the other resinous, electri∣city.
The latter opinion I am inclined to espouse, but shall not
here enter into a detail of the theory; but shall only observe,
that the experiments on vegetation have been principally made
with the accumulation of the vitreous electricity only, and the
consequent exclusion of the resinous; that is, with what is com∣monly
termed positive electricity, and not with what is termed
negative electricity. It is therefore to be wished, that some
future experiments may be made with the resinous or negative
electricity in preference to the vitreous or positive electricity,
or with both of them alternately or comparatively.</P>
<P>The influence of positive or vitreous electricity in forwarding
the germination of plants and their growth seems to be pretty
well established; though Mr. Ingenhouz did not succeed in his
experiments, and thence doubts the success of those of others;
and though M. Rouland, from his new experiments believes,
that neither positive nor negative electricity increases vegetation;
<PB N="282" REF="288"/>
both which philosophers had previously been supporters of the
contrary doctrine: for many other naturalists have since repeat∣ed
their experiments relative to this object, and their new results
have confirmed their former ones. Mr. D'Ormey and the two
Roziers have found the same success in numerous experiments,
which they have made in the two last years; and Mr. Carmoy
has shewn in a convincing manner, that electricity accelerates
germination.</P>
<P>Mr. D'Ormey not only found various seeds to vegetate sooner,
and to grow taller, which were put upon his insulated table,
and supplied with electricity; but also that silk-worms began to
spin much sooner, which were kept electrified, than those of
the same hatch, which were kept in the same place and manner,
except that they were not electrified. These experiments of
Mr. D'Ormey are detailed at length in the Journal de Physique
of Rozier, Tom. XXXV. p. 270.</P>
<P>Mr. Bartholon, who had before written a tract on this sub∣ject,
and proposed ingenious methods for applying electricity to
agriculture and gardening, has also repeated a numerous set of
experiments; and shews, that natural electricity as well as the
artificial increases the growth of plants, and the germination of
seeds; and opposes Mr. Ingenhouz by very numerous and con∣clusive
facts. Ib. Tom. XXXV. p. 401.</P>
<P>My friend Mr. D. Bilsborrow in June 1797 sowed mustard-seed
in four garden pots at Mr. Hartop's at Dalby Hall in
Leicestershire. He subjected one of these to positive or vitreous
electricity, and another to negative or resinous electricity, and
observed that the seeds in the pot subjected to the negative or
resinous electricity germinated a day before the pot subjected to
positive or vitreous electricity, and both of them much before
the two pots, which were not electrised, but otherwise exposed
to the same circumstances.</P>
<P>Nor do the injuries occasionally received from lightning in
its passage through trees or corn fields from or to the earth or
clouds, which are mentioned in Sect. XIV. 2. 3. in the least
invalidate this opinion of its general utility as well as that of the
fluid element of heat; for the excess of the most salutary sti∣muli
become deleterious both to vegetable and animal bo∣dies.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="289"/>
2. Since by the late discoveries in chemistry there is reason
to believe, that water is decomposed in the vessels of vegetables;
and that the hydrogene, or inflammable air, of which it in part
consists, contributes to the nourishment of the plant, and to the
production of its oils, resins, gums, sugar, &amp;c. And lastly,
as electricity has by late experiments been found to decompose
water into the two airs, termed oxygen and hydrogen, there
is a powerful analogy to induce us to believe, that it acce∣lerates
or contributes to the growth of vegetation; and like
he may possibly enter into combination with many bodies, or
form the basis of some yet unanalysed acid.</P>
<P>3. The solution of water in air or in calorique seems to ac∣quire
electric matter at the same time, as appears from an ex∣periment
of Mr. Bennet. He put some live coals into an in∣sulated
funnel of metal, and throwing on them a little water,
observed that the ascending steam was electrised plus; and the
water, which descended through the funnel, was electrised
minus. Hence it appears, that though clouds by their change
of form may sometimes become electrised minus, yet they have
in general an accumulation of positive electricity. This accu∣mulation
of electric matter also evidently contributes to support
the atmospheric vapour, when it is condensed into the form of
clouds; because it is seen to descend rapidly, after the flashes of
lightning have diminished its quantity.</P>
<P>According to the theory of Mr. Lavoisier concerning the
composition and decomposition of water, there would seem
another source of thunder showers; and that is, that the two
gasses termed oxygen gas, or vital air, and hydrogen gas, or
inflammable air, may exist in the summer atmosphere in a state
of mixture, but not of combination; and that the electric spark,
or flash of lightning, may combine them, and produce water in∣stantaneously.</P>
<P>4. A profitable application of electricity by the gardener or
agricultor to promote the growth of plants is not yet discovered;
It is nevertheless probable, that in dry seasons the erection of
numerous metallic points on the surface of the ground, but a
few feet high, might in the night time contribute to precipitate
the dew by facilitating the passage of electricity from the air
<PB N="284" REF="290"/>
into the earth; and that an erection of such points higher in
the air by means of wires wrapped round tall rods, like angle
rods, or elevated on buildings, might frequently precipitate
showers from the higher parts of the atmosphere.</P>
<P>And lastly, that such points erected in gardens might pro∣mote
a quicker vegetation of the plants in their vicinity by sup∣plying
them more abundantly with the electric ether; if the
events of the experiments of the philosophers above mentioned
are to be depended upon, which may at least be worth a further
trial.</P>
<P>5. For the purpose of keeping a few flower-pots perpetually
subject to more abundant electricity, Mr. Bennet of Wirksworth
in Derbyshire affixeda small apparatus to the pendulum of a
clock, as described below with a plate; but has not yet suffici∣ently
attended to it to determine its effect on vegetation.</P>

<P>THE diseases of vegetables may be divided into those, which
appear to originate from internal causes, those from the external
elements, and those from the nidifications or depredations of in∣sects;
to which may be added the depredations of other animals.
We shall begin with diseased irritability.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>DISEASES FROM INTERNAL CAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>I. 1. It has already been shewn, that the buds of vegetables
are individual beings, and constitute an inferior order of animals;
<PB N="287" REF="293"/>
and that they possessess irritability, and sensibi∣lity,
and voluntarity, and have associations of motion; as explained in Zoono∣mia,
Vol. I. Sect. XIII. But as the three latter kinds of ex∣citability
are possessed in a so much less degree by vegetable buds
than by more perfect animals, we shall only consider the diseases
of their irritability.</P>
<P>M. Girtannir endeavoured to shew, that animal irritability ori∣ginates
from the oxygen, which constitutes somewhat less than a
third of the atmosphere, which they breathe. And M. Van
Uslar has applied the same idea to vegetable life; and has endea∣voured
to shew, that their irritability also originates from the
oxygen, which they acquire either by the respiration of their
leaves, or by the absorption of their roots. And indeed, as res∣piration
is every minute necessary to animal life, there is reason to
believe, that something immediately necessary to the existence of
life is acquired by the lungs of animals from the atmosphere ra∣ther
than from the food, which they digest; and that this, which
is believed to be the oxygen only, is mixed with the blood, and
separated again from it by the brain, and spinal marrow, after
having undergone some change in the circulation or secretion of
it.</P>
<P>In the same manner it is not improbable, but that the spirit of
vegetation may have a similar origin, probably from the uncom∣bined
oxygen of the air, respired by the upper surfaces of their
leaves; and not from that, which is absorbed by their roots in a
more combined state; and that this oxygen is again separated
from their juices by the sensorium, or brain, of each individual
bud, after having undergone some change in the circulation or
secretion of it. See Sect. IV. 1. 2.</P>
<P>The circumstances attending vegetable irritability are similar to
those belonging to the irritability of animals upon a less extensive
scale, as detailed in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XII.</P>
<P>When vegetable fibres have been long stimulated more than na∣tural
or usual by increase of heat, the spirit of vegetation becomes
exhausted; and in consequence a slighter degree of cold will de∣stroy
them; because their fibres after having been long excited
by a greater stimulus will cease to act on the application of one,
which is much less; whence after hot days tender plants are more
<PB N="288" REF="294"/>
liable to be destroyed by the coldness of the night. Whence in
more northern, climates the gardeners shade their tender vegeta∣bles,
as the flower of apricots, in the spring-frosts from the me∣ridian
fun, as well as from the coldness of the night; which is
generally the greatest about an hour before sunrise.</P>
<P>In the hot days of June 1798 I twice observed several rows
of garden beans become quite sickly, and many of them to die,
from being flooded for an hour or two with water from a canal in
the neighbourhood; which I ascribed more to the sudden appli∣cation
of too great cold, after bring much enfeebled, or render∣ed
inirritable, by the excessive heat of the season, than to the
too copious supply of water to the dry ground; to which should
be added, that some plants are more liable to be thus injured than
others; as the strawberries, young cabbage plants, and onions,
which were in the same situation, received benefit and not deteri∣oration
by being thus occasionally watered in that dry season.</P>
<P>On the contrary, when plants have been long exposed to a less
stimulus of heat than natural or usual, the spirit of vegetation
becomes accumulated; and if they are too suddenly subjected to
much greater heat, their too great increase of action induces in∣flammation,
and consequent mortification, and death; as oc∣curs
to those people, who have had too much warmth applied to
their frozen limbs. Experiments of this kind were instituted by
Van Uslar; he increased the irritability of euphorbia peplus and
esula by secluding light and heat from them; and, when he ex∣posed
them to a meridian sun, they became gangrenous, and died
in a short time.</P>
<P>This greater or less irritability of plants is to
be ascribed to their previous habits in respect to the stimulus of greater or less
heat. Thus the times of the appearance of vegetables in the
spring seem occasionally to be influenced by their previously ac∣quired
habits, as well as by their present sensibility to heat. For
the roots of potatoes, onions, will germinate with much less heat
in the spring than in the autumn; as is easily observable, where
these roots are stored for use, and hence malt is best made in
the spring, as the barley will then germinate with a less degree of
heat.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="295"/>
The grains and roots brought from more southern latitudes ger∣minate
here sooner than those, which are brought from more nor∣thern
ones, owing to their acquired habits. Fordyce on Agri∣culture.
It was observed by one of the scholars of Linneus, that
the apple-trees sent from hence to New England blossomed for a
few years too early for that climate, and bore no fruit; but after∣wards
learnt to accommodate themselves to their new situation.
(Kalm's Travels.) Vines in grape houses, which have been ex∣posed
to the winter's cold, will become forwarder and more vi∣gorous
than those, which have been kept during the winter in the
house. (Kennedy on Gardening.) This accounts for the very
rapid vegetation in the northern latitudes after the solution of the
snows.</P>
<P>The increase of the irritability of plants in respect to heat,
after having been previously exposed to cold, is farther illustrated
by an experiment of Dr. Walker's. He cut apertures into a
birch-tree at different heights; and on the 26th of March some
of these apertures bled, or oozed with the sap-juice, when the
thermometer was at 39; which same apertures did not bleed on
the 13th of March, when the thermometer was at 44. The
reason of this I apprehend was, because on the night of the 25th
of March the thermometer was as low as 34; whereas on the
night of the 12th of March it was at 41; though the ingenious
author ascribes it to another cause. Transact. of the Royal So∣ciety
of Edinburgh, V. I. p. 19.</P>
<P>There is an observation in Mr. Tull's work, which he ingeni∣ously
ascribes to the acquired habits of plants. “By the ex∣tremely
hard winter of the year 1708 or 1709, some lucern in
Languedoc was killed, along with all the olive trees and walnut
trees by the severity of the season; though I could not
hear that one walnut tree was killed in England. Perhaps
those in France having been accustomed to much hotter summers
were unable to endure the rigour of the same winter, that did not
destroy the same plants in England.” Horse-hoeing Husbandry,
Ch. XIII. p. 201.</P>
<P>By adapted experiments Medicus is said to have found, that the
irritability of plants is greater in the morning, less in the middle
<PB N="290" REF="296"/>
of the day, and much less in the evening. And Von Uslar
found, that their irritability in respect to their contractions was
increased in cool and rainy weather. Observ. on Plants by
Schmeisser. Edinb. So the parts of animals become more sen∣sible
to heat after being previously exposed to cold; as our hands
glow on coming into the house after having for a while being im∣mersed
in snow; and many insects, and other animals, which
hide themselves in the earth, and sleep during the winter, were
observed by M. Spallanzani to disappear at a season, when the
heat of the atmosphere was much higher than in the spring, when
they again made their appearance.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that plants, which are kept in a warm room
during winter, should occasionally be exposed to cooler air to in∣crease
their irritability; as otherwise their growth in the spring is
observed to be very tardy. Mankind for the same reason requires
the perpetual variations of the heat of the atmosphere to preserve
or restore the irritability, and consequent activity, of the system.
Whence the health and energy of men are greater, and their
lives longer, in this variable island, than in the tropical continents,
which possess greater warmth, and less variation of weather.</P>
<P>2. Linneus in the Philosophia Botanica has given names to
but four internal diseases, eurisiphe, mildew; rubigo, rust;
clavus, ergot, or spur; and ustilago, smut; to which may be
added many others as described below.</P>
<P>Erysiphe, a white mucor, or mould, or mildew, with sessile
tawny heads, with which the leaves are sprinkled; this is fre∣quent
in humulus, hop; lamium, dead nettle; gallopsis, arch-angel;
lithospermum, stone-seed; and acer, maple. This
mucur is a plant of the fungus kind, which will grow without
light, or change of air, like other funguses; and with its roots
penetrates the vessels of the vegetables to which it adheres.—
But these vessels are probably previously injured by internal dis∣ease.
The methods of preventing or destroying it must consist
in thinning the plant, or removing those in its vicinity, so as to
admit more light, and greater ventilation, which may at the
same time eradicate the mildew, and restore the internal vigour
of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant.</P>
<P>As the greater dampness of same land supplies one permanent
cause of mildew, as well as its being too much overshadowed by
<PB N="291" REF="297"/>
thick foliage, the methods of prevention must consist in properly
draining the land, and using drier kinds of manure, as coal-ashes
and bone-ashes, as well as by thinning the crops. And lastly, it
is recommended to sow early in the season for the purpose of
procuring forward crops; as this disease is said more to injure
late crops owing to the greater dampness of the ground in autumn.</P>
<P>3. Rubigo, rust, a ferruginous powder sprinkled under the
leaves, frequent in alchemilla, lady's mantle, rubus sexatilis,
essula degener; and particularly in senecio or jacobaea; and es∣pecially
in a burnt woody soil.</P>
<P>This is probably another fungus similar to the former, or to
some kinds of lichen, which grows beneath the leaves of vege∣tables
previously diseased, and may probably be prevented or des∣troyed
by exposing the plant to more light, and greater ventilla∣tion,
as in the mucor above mentioned.</P>
<P>An account is given by Mr. Lambert in the Transactions of
the Linnean Society, Vol. IV. of a disease which may probably
be somewhat similar to the rubigo, which he calls uredo frumen∣ti,
or blight of wheat, and describes it to be a fungus, which
covers the stems of wheat in wet seasons, when it is nearly ripe,
so as to give the field an appearance of being covered with foot.
The stem of the wheat is said to appear to be split, and the growth
of the plant to be much injured. He describes the fungus to be
linear-oblong, tawny-black.</P>
<P>4. Clavus, ergot, or spur, occurs when seeds grow out into
large horns, black without, as in secale, rye, and in carex.
This disease frequently affects the rye in France, and sometimes
in England, in moist seasons, and is called ergot, spur, or horn-seed;
the grain becomes considerably elongated, and is either
straight or crooked, containing black meal along with the white;
and is said to appear to be pierced by insects, which are supposed
to cause the disease.</P>
<P>Mr. Duhamel ascribes it to this cause, and compares it to galls
on oak-leaves; but this has not yet been established by sufficient
observations. By the use of this bad grain amongst the poor,
diseases have been produced, attended with great debility, and
mortification of the extremities, both in France and England.

<P><PB N="292" REF="298"/>
5. Ustilago, smut, when the fruit instead of seed produces a
black meal, as in wheat, barley, oats, scorzonera, tragopogon.
Much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s said on this disease in the Dict. Raison of Bomare. Art.
Bled, who recommends steeping the grain, before it is sown, in
brine; which is generally directed to have so much salt added to
the water, as may increase its specific gravity, till an egg will
swim in it; or secondly, to steep the seed-wheat in lime water;
or thirdly, which he thinks most efficacious, in an alkaline ley
made by adding pot-ash to lime-water.</P>
<P>In the systema naturae of Linneus under the article Vermes,
Zoophyta, Chaos ustilago, there is a quotation from Munchhau∣sen,
that the ustilago is a black powder, which is found in the
destroyed grains of barley, wheat, and other grasses; and in the
florets of tragopogon scorzonera. And that this powder being
macerated in warm water for some days passes into oblong animal∣cules,
hyaline in respect to colour, and playing about like fish, as
may be seen by a microscope; and are again mentioned in Lin∣neus's
dissertation on the invisible world.</P>
<P>There is an ingenious paper in the publications of the Bath
Society, in which the author observes, that the smut in wheat
only happens, when wet weather occurs at the time of the flower∣ing
of the wheat; which may burst the anthers, and wash away
the farina. He thinks that steeping the wheat in brine or lime
water is an ancient error, and can be of no use but to separate
light wheat from that which is good.</P>
<P>For he found smutty ears and good ones growing from the same
root; and thence it could not depend on any contagious material,
or insects eggs, adhering to the seed; and in some even the same
ear contained both sound and smutty corns. And lastly, that
some of the corns had one end smutty, and the other sound;
and he concludes, that it must be owing to the want of impreg∣nation
from the defect of the farina fecundans; and that the
putrefaction succeeded the death of the grain.</P>
<P>From the observations of Spallanzani on leguminous plants the
probability of this opinion is much confirmed. He found that
the seed was produced by the female organ of the plant, long
before it was impregnated; which could not happen, till the
flower was open, and the anther-dust ripe. Whence it is easy
<PB N="293" REF="299"/>
conceive, that for want of impregnation, or the vivifying prin∣ciple,
the wheat-corn must putrefy like the addle eggs of poultry,
which are unimpregnated, and thence die, and in consequence
putrefy.</P>
<P>If this disease of smut should become a serious evil, it might
possibly be prevented by sowing the grain in distant rows; and
after some days sowing other rows between them of the same,
or of another kind of wheat; by which means, if wet weather
should destroy the anthers of one set of rows, the alternate ones
might supply farina to their stigmas, if the weather became fa∣vourable.
See Sea. XVI. 8. 2.</P>
<P>Wheat discoloured by smut may be washed, and readily dried
on a malt kiln, and may be thus easily made marketable and
equally good; for the living grain will not absorb much water in
a short time; or it may be mixed with clean sand, and after be∣ing
well agitated the sand may be separated by a riddle; and if
necessary the same sand may be washed and dried for repeated
use.</P>
<P>6. Besides the four internal diseases above spoken of, as men∣tioned
by Linneus; and the uredo of Mr. Lambert, there are
probably many others, which have not yet been sufficiently at∣tended
to, as the canker, gangrena; the honey-sweat, exsudatio
mellita; the miliary sweat, exsudatio miliaris; the sap-flow,
fluxus umbilicalis; and the gum secretion, secretio gummosa.</P>
<P>The canker, which may be termed gangrena vegetabilis, is a
phagedenic ulcer of the bark; which is very destructive to ap∣ple-trees,
and pear-trees, as it spreads round the trunk or
branches, and destroys them.</P>
<P>Mr. Knight has observed this disease to be most frequent and
fatal to those trees, the fruit of which has been long in fashion;
as they have been perpetually propagated for a century or two by
ingrafting; which he believes to be a continuation of the old
tree, though nourished by a new stock; and that the canker is
thus a disease of old age, like the mortification of the limbs of
elderly people, and arises from the irritability of a part of the
system.</P>
<P>But it seems more probably to be an hereditary disease, as the
buds of trees being a lateral progeny, and more exactly resem∣bling
<PB N="294" REF="300"/>
their parents, must be more liable to the diseases gradually
acquired or increased by the influence of soil or climate; and
have not the probability of improvement, which attends the pro∣geny
of sexual generation.</P>
<P>It is nevertheless frequently produced on trees by external vio∣lence,
as by a stroke with a spade by a careless labourer, who is
digging near them; but this probably may more easily affect the
old grafts above mentioned. When a destruction of the bark is
thus produced by external violence, it may possibly be cured by
the application of a piece of living bark from a less valuable tree,
bound on as mentioned in the next article, and in Sect. XVII.
3. 10.</P>
<P>The edges of these gangrenous ulcers of the bark should be
nicely pared with a knife, so as to admit the air, and to prevent
the depredations of insects and the lodgment of moisture, which
might promote the putrefaction of the stagnant juices, and spread
the gangrene; this should be so managed as only to cut away the
dead lips of the wound, but not so as in the least to injure the liv∣ing
bark. Some thick white paint may then be smeared on the
naked alburnum or sap-wood on a dry day, which may prevent
insects from inserring their eggs into it, and produce maggots,
which erode and destroy the wood; and may also prevent the
dews and rains from rotting it. The paint should nevertheless
be so spread, as not to touch the edges of the wound; as it might
injure their growth by its poisonous quality; a quarter
of an ounce of sublimate of mercury, hydrargyrus muriatus, rubbed with
about a pound of white lead paint, might render it more noxi∣ous
to insects. See Sect. XVII. 3. 9. and 10.</P>
<P>7. The honey-dew, which may be called suffusio mellita, con∣sists
of a saccharine juice, which I have supposed to be exsuded
from the tree by the retrograde motions of the cutaneous lympha∣tic
vessels, connected either with the common sap-vessels describ∣ed
in Sect. II. or with the umbilical vessels described in Sect. III.
2. 8. instead of its being carried forwards to increase the growth
of the present leaf-buds, or to lay up nutriment for the buds,
which are in their embryon state; and may thus be compared to
the diaboetes mellitus, or to the sweating sickness of the last cen∣tury.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="301"/>
The saccharine and nutritious quality of the honey-dew, simi∣lar
to that of the sap-juice, which rises in the vernal months from
the birch and maple, is evident from its taste; and from the
number of bees and ants, which are said to feed on it, when it
appears on some trees; and which shews, that its exsudation
must be considerably injurious to the tree, as before mentioned
in Sect. VI. 6. 3.</P>
<P>In a paper written by the Abbé Boissier de Sauvages, he des∣cribes
two kinds of honey-dew; one of which he concludes to
be an exsudation from the tree, and the other he asserts to be the
excrement of one kind of aphis, which the animal projects to
the distance of some inches from its body on the leaves and
ground beneath it; and which he believes the animal acquires by
piercing the sap-vessels of the leaf. This paper is detailed in
Wildman's work on Bees, p. 46. The circumstances are dis∣tinctly
described, and by so great a philosopher as Sauvages of
Montpellier, that it is difficult to doubt the authenticity of the
fact. But that a material so nutritive should be produced as the
excrement of an insect is so totally contrary to the strongest ana∣logy,
that it may nevertheless be suspected to be a morbid exsu∣dation
from the tree; though these insects may occasionally prey
upon it, and void it almost unchanged at those seasons, because
the insects continued some months after the honey-dew ceased,
and before it commenced, as mentioned below; and the upper
surfaces of the leaves became covered with a black powder,
which had before been covered with the honey-dew. And lastly,
because on other trees, as on the peach and nectarine, at other
seasons of the year, no honey-dew is perceived, though the aphis
much abounds to the great injury of the trees.</P>
<P>Early this morning, June 18, 1798, I observed a remarkable
honey-dew on an extensive row of nut-trees, corylus avellana,
which grow by the side of a pond of water; the sun shone
bright, and the upper surface of every leaf, which was illumi∣ned
by the sun, was covered with a viscid juice, which tasted as
sweet as diluted honey. From many of these leaves large drops
hung from the point, and during that day and the following one
much of this honey dropped down so as to moisten the gravel
walk beneath the branches of every tree, and seemed more fluid
<PB N="296" REF="302"/>
as the sunshine became warmer; and the leaves, which were
concealed from the sun, appeared to have less of the honeys-dew,
and some of them none of it.</P>
<P>How long this honey-dew had continued before I observed it,
I cannot tell, but probably many days, as the weather was then,
and had been uncommonly dry and warm, and shining; and
after two or three days, when the weather changed, the mor∣bid
exsudation, if such it was, or the excrementitious deposition
of this viscid honey, became checked and gradually disappear∣ed.</P>
<P>Beneath every leaf of this extensive hedge of filberts I dis∣cerned
fifty or a hundred aphises of all sizes, and many of them
had wings; but I could not perceive, that any of them had
been on the upper surfaces of the leaves, where the honey only
existed; nor were any bees, or butter-flies, or ants, about
these leaves; on which they must have adhered, if they had
settled; which possibly they were aware of, as a hive of bees was
at no great distance.</P>
<P>M. Duhamel observed a similar sweet juice drop in such
quantity from willows by the side of a river in very hot and dry
weather, that children were busy in catching or gathering it,
and that it tasted like manna, but was more agreeable. He
also mentions its dropping from nut-trees. Physique des arbres,
Vol. I. p. 150. M. Reneaume, in the Memoirs of the Academ▪
des Sciences, observed a similar exsudation from the maple,
and sycamore; and adds, 1. That it was unctuous and sweet.
2. That it was in the greatest quantity on the leaves exposed to
the sun, which appeared wet on their upper surfaces; and that
it was not seen before sun-rise. 3. That bees collected it as
anxiousty as common honey. 4. And that some leaves died,
whose discharge was very great. 5. That it existed in a very
dry and hot season. But neither of these philosophers speak of
its being attended by the aphis.</P>
<P>The aphis this year was uncommonly numerous, the leaves
of the peach and nectarine trees were half of them destroyed by
this pernicious insect, and became blistered and curled I sup∣pose
by their punctures; which were made some weeks earlier
in the year, and by an aphis without wings, and differing some∣what
<PB N="297" REF="303"/>
what in their shape, but without any appearance of honey-dew
on those trees. But I could not discover any punctures or other
disease of the leaves of these nut-trees, and therefore doubt whe∣ther
these insects, though so numerous on the under surface of
every leaf, could be the cause of the morbid exsudation, if such
it was, on their upper surfaces; and the more as I could not
distinguish, that they preyed upon the honey thus produced;
and I afterwards observed that they continued in immense num∣bers
under every leaf, when the weather became cooler, and
moister, and the honey-dew ceased to be visible. But after a
few weeks I observed the upper surface of every leaf became
covered with a black powder like soot; whether this was a new
material, or remained after the exhalation of the honey-dew, I
did not determine by experiment. But if both the honey-dew
and this subsequent black powder on the upper surfaces of the
leaves, were the excrement of the aphis on the under surfaces
of the leaves over the former, or owing to an exsudation from
the tree, must be determined by further observations.</P>
<P>But as a second period of sap-flow is believed to exist about
mid-summer, or a deposition of vegetable nutriment for the new
buds, as described in Sect. III. 2. 8. there is reason to sus∣pect,
that the honey-dew is owing to the inverted action of the
external lymphatics occasioned by the debility induced by the
continued heat, and perhaps to the moisture of situation.
Whence the nutritive fluid is thrown upon the external habit
instead of being applied to nourish the new buds, or to be laid
up as a reservoir for their use. And that if it be voided by the
aphis, it is owing to their puncturing the sap-vessels with the
fine proboscis, which they possess, at this season only, or in a
distempered state of the tree, and drinking more of it than they
are able to digest. For a further history of this insect see No.
3. 2. of this Section.</P>
<P>8. Exsudatio miliaris, miliary sweat, appears to be produced
by too great and continued heat, as it exists on vines in hot-houses,
which are kept too warm, or too close in respect to their
ventilation.</P>
<P>This secretion has not the sweet taste like that of the honey-dew,
but consists of mucilage; which, as the watery part eva∣evaporats
<PB N="298" REF="304"/>
by heat, remains on the plant in very small round hard
globules, like millet seeds, whence their name, I once witnessed
a very similar appearance of minute hard round globules on the
skin in a miliary fever, which easily were rubbed off with the
finger; and were probably occasioned, as in this vegetable
disease, by too great heat, and the exclusion of air, as described
in Zoonomia, Vol. II. Class 2. 1 3. 12.</P>
<P>In the evaporation of perspirable matter, which in its diseased
state may be more mucilaginous than natural, in confined bed∣rooms
or hot-houses, I suppose, the aqueous part only is ex∣haled,
and the mucilaginons part remains in the form of a glo∣bule;
in the same manner as stalactites are formed on the roof
of caverns from a solution of calcareous earth in water, simply
by the evaporation of the water.</P>
<P>9. Fluxus umbilicalis, sap-flow, this occurs, when the albur∣num
or sap-wood of trees is wounded in the vernal months, as
in birch and maple, described in Sect III. 2. 2. and consists
of a saccharine and mucilaginous fluid similar to the honey-dew,
or suffusio mellita; and is often very troublesome, when vines
in hot-houses are pruned too late in the season, as the whole
branch is liable to bleed to death, owing thus to the loss of the
sap-juice, which ought to be employed in nourishing the young
buds, and expanding their leaves.</P>
<P>When some perennial plants have risen but a certain height
from the ground, if their stems are much wounded, or cut off,
the roots are liable to bleed to death from this discharge of the
umbilical fluid, or sap-juice, which ought to have nourished and
expanded the new buds and foliage; as may be seen in cutting
down the heracleum spondylium, cow parsnep, in April; and
on this account it has been recommended to mow down thistles,
and other weeds, which are troublesome from their numerous
increase, early in the spring; as many of them will then die,
and the rest be much weakened by the sap-flow, which attends
their wounds at that season.</P>
<P>In respect to trees another period of sap-flow is said to exist,
when the new buds are forming after Midsummer, as spoken of
in Sect. III. 2. 8. Whence wounds at this season also must be
injurious; where this loss of sap-juice occurs in hot-houses vari∣ous
<PB N="299" REF="305"/>
applications have been recommended by gardeners. I sus∣pect
that a bit of sponge bound upon the end of the cut branch,
or on the wound, by means of some elastic bandage, must be the
most certain application; or a wire twisted round the end of the
branch cut off, so tightly as to strangulate the whole circulation
of juices, and consequently destroy the part above the liga∣ture.</P>
<P>10. Secretio gummosa, gum secretion, a morbid production
of gum, which differs from the sap-juice above described, as it
contains no saccharine quality, though like the former it exsudes
from the wounded alburnum of deciduous trees; whether the
wound be originally caused by internal disease, or by external
violence, as mentioned in the gangrene of the bark above de∣scribed.</P>
<P>Where this happens to cherry-trees, prunus cerasus, a gum
exsudes like gum arabic; which in dry weather hardens, as it
adheres, and thus prevents the further discharge of this nutri∣tive
material; otherwise the tree weeps away its life, perish∣ing
from deficient nourishment. In similar manner a resin is
emitted from the injuries or wounds of pine trees, and some
other evergreens, with great injury to the growth, or the de∣struction
of the tree.</P>
<P>This exsudation of the gum or resin of trees, as it happens
chiefly in summer, is probably a part of nutritious fluid designed
for the new buds, which in most deciduous trees are formed
about this time, and should be prevented from continuing to
flow by binding on the part, previously made smooth by a knife,
a metallic plate, as of the lead in which tea is wrapped, so as
to prevent rain or dew drops from dissolving the indurated gum.
A bit of sponge, or of soft leather, or of Indian rubber, caout∣chouc,
might be bound on under the lead, till the wound is
healed. Might not a strong solution of green vitriol in water,
or some ink, if applied to the extremities of these bleeding ves∣sels,
stimulate them into contraction, and prevent the further
effusion of gum?</P>
<P>Another method might be worth trial, which is mentioned
in Sect. XVII. 3. 10. A piece of bark from a similar tree of
inferior value might be cut out, so as nicely to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it the wounded
<PB N="300" REF="306"/>
part, after its edges were nicely smoothed, and might be tied
on by a proper bandage, as the listing cut from the edges of
cloth, or flannel, so that its elasticity might secure a perpetual
pressure without injury.</P>

<HEAD>II. DISEASES FROM EXTERNAL ELEMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>1. In climates liable to incessant rains or perpetual drought
for a length of time many diseases of vegetables must originate
from the excess of moisture, or to the want of it; which are not
very frequent in this country. In moist seasons the leaf-buds
of plants, as of grass and corn, as well as of trees and pe∣rennial
vegetables, grow too luxuriantly; and the flowers and
consequent fruits or seeds are later, and contain more aqueous,
and less mucilaginous and saccharine matter.</P>
<P>On the contrary, in dry seasons the leaf-buds are less vigo∣rous,
and therefore in less quantity, as the crops of hay, and
the quantity of straw; but the fruits and seeds ripen earlier, and
are of more grateful flavour, and more nutritious.</P>
<P>2. The effect of heat on vegetation is spoken of in Sect.
XIII. 2. 2. The excess of that element is seldom much inju∣rious
to the vegetation of this country, unless it may contribute
to increase the dryness of the soil, when there is a scarcity of
moisture. But the defect of the element of heat, or in com∣mon
language excess of cold, is frequently destructive to the
early shoots of the ash, fraxinus, and to the early blossoms of
many fruit-trees, as apples, pears, apricots; as these are either
more succulent, or have less irritability, or more sensibility; on
both which accounts they are more liable to be diseased by
cold.</P>
<P>The blights occasioned by frost generally happen in the
spring, when cold nights succeed to warm sunny days, as the
living power of the plant has then been previously exhausted
by the stimulus of heat, and is therefore less capable of being ex∣cited
into the actions, which are necessary to vegetable life, by
the greatly diminished stimulus of a freezing atmosphere.</P>
<P>In some northern climates, where the long sunny days suc∣ceed
the dissolving of the snows, as in Denmark and in Russia,
<PB N="301" REF="307"/>
the gardeners are said to shelter their wall-trees from the meri∣dian
sun in the vernal months; which preserves them from the
cold of the succeeding night; and by preventing them from
flowering too early avoids the danger of the vernal frosts.</P>
<P>The destruction of the more succulent parts of vegetables,
as their early shoots, and that especially when exposed to frosty
nights, was spoken of in Sect. XIII. 2. 2. and can only be
counteracted by covering them from the descending dews or
rime by the coping-stones of a wall, or mats of straw.</P>
<P>3. The blasts occasioned by lightning are more frequent, I
believe, than is usually supposed; as I am informed by those,
who purchase extensive woods, that very many trees on being
sawed through are found cracked, and much injured by light∣ning.
I had last year a standard apple-tree, and a tall apricot-tree,
in full leaf blasted at the same time by lightning, as was
believed. They both lost all their leaves; the apple-tree never∣theless
put out a new foliage, and recovered, and bore fruit
this year; but the apricot, which was nailed to a high wall,
never shewed any returning life.</P>
<P>Mr. Tull ascribes one injury to the health of wheat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plants,
and frequently their death, to lightning; the effects whereof,
he says, may be observed by the blackish parts or patches visible
in a field of wheat, especially in those years which have more
thunder-storms than usual, and adds that against this there is
no remedy.</P>
<P>The erection of frequent metallic points could alone secure a
garden or field from this misfortune; which probably occurs
more frequently on damp situations, than on dry ones; as men∣tioned
in the account of Fairy Rings in Botanic Garden, Vol. I.
note XIII.</P>
<P>The manner in which lightning destroys the life of vegetables
may be similar to that, in which it destroys animal life; which
is I suppose by its great stimulus exhausting the sensorial power
in the violent action it occasions, and thus producing total in∣irritability
to the common stimuli, which ought to excite the
vital actions of the system; similar to which, though with less
expedition, seems to be the effect of some poisons on the animal
system, as the distilled water of lauro-cerasus, a solution of
<PB N="302" REF="308"/>
arsenic, the contagious matter of fevers, and even a common
emetic; all which by their strong stimulus seem almost instan∣taneously
to render the stomach, and other parts of the system,
nearly or entirely inirritable, or disobedient to their natural
stimuli.</P>
<P>It may also affect vegetables in another way similar to that,
which probably also happens, when their young succulent shoots
are frozen; that is, by bursting their vessels, as it passes through
them, by its expansive power; as it happens to the large
branches of some trees, and to stone-buildings, and other bad
conductors of electricity, when they are struck with light∣ning.</P>
<P>The expansive power of electricity is not only shewn by trees
and towers being rent by lightning, but by the sound, which
succeeds the passage of it through air; since a vacuum, or nearly
a vacuum, in respect to air must previously be made by the pre∣sence
of the electric fluid; and the sides of this vacuum rushing
together, when the stream has passed, occasions the consequent
vibrations of the air, which constitute sound, whether in the
audible spark of electricity, or the tremendous crash of thunder.
See Sect. XIII. 3.</P>
<P>4. The element of light, as well as that of heat, is necessary
to vegetation. In this climate they both seem in general to be
injurious only by their defect, and seldom by their excess.
But as light acts as a stimulus on the more irritative or sensitive
parts of plants, which appears by the expansion of many flowers,
and of some leaves, when the sun shines on them; and by the
nutation of the whole flower, as of the sun-flower, helianthus;
and by the bending of the summits of all plants confined in
houses towards the light; there may be diseases owing to the
excess of this stimulus, which have not been attended to; to
prevent which the flowers of tragapogon salsasi, and of other
plants, close about noon. Other unobserved diseases may be
owing to a defect of the stimulus of light; as a mimosa, sensitive
plant, which I had confined in a dark room, did not open its
foliage, though late in the day, till many minutes after it was
exposed to the light.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="309"/>
The excess of light has not been observed to be attended by
vegetable diseases in these more northern latitudes; but the
disease produced by the deficiency of it, which is termed etio∣lation,
or blanching, has been successfully used to render some
vegetable leaves and stalks esculent by depriving them of much
of their acrimoney, and of their cohesion, as well as of their
colour; as is seen in the blanching of celery, apium; endive,
cichorium; cinara, cardoon; sea-cale, crambe.</P>
<P>The following method of the growth and etiolation of sea-cale
is transcribed from the letter of a friend; to which should be
added, that the young heads of this vegetable without blanching
are equal or superior to most kinds of brocoli, brassica. “Sea-cale
should be sowed the latter end of March or beginning of
April in drills, and then earthed up. In autumn it should be
transplanted into high beds, one row of roots in a bed, about
a foot asunder, and in the winter it should be covered up. It
must be kept dry, that is, the beds made in the driest ground;
it is not fit to be eaten till the third year after it is sowed. The
year before it is eaten it must be covered up in the beginning of
winter, first with stable dung, which may be kept from pressing
on it by a few sticks placed like a cone over each root; then
with long litter two or three feet high; the higher the better,
because the more it is forced, the earlier it is fit to be gathered,
and the whiter it will be. It is to be gathered about the be∣ginning
of January and so on till May, one bed being kept
under another. It should be boiled and sent up on toast like
asparagus, and is an excellent vegetable, and at an early sea∣son.”</P>
<P>5. The earth, on which vegetables insert their roots, some∣times
presents noxious materials to their absorbent system, as the
acidity of some clays; into which when the roots of some fruit
trees penetrate, they are said to lose their health, as mentioned
in Sect. II. 9. by the death or decay or their root-fibres.</P>
<P>Pure siliceous sands also prevent vegetation from their con∣taining
no carbonaceous matter, and by their so readily permit∣ting
the dews and rains to exhale from them, especially in hot∣ter
climates, where they constitute a moving surface unfriendly
to all organized life.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="310"/>
6. There are also noxious exhalations diffused in the atmos∣phere
in the neighbourhood of some manufactories; which are
said to injure the growth or destroy the life of vegetables; as
the smoke from the furnaces, in which lead is smelted from the
ore, from potteries, and from lime-kilns; to which may be
added the marine salt, or marine acid, which abounds in the
too great vicinity of the sea.</P>
<P>To these belong the experiments of Dr. Peschier of Geneva,
who immersed several plants in vapours of nitrous acid, of vo∣latile
alkali, and of ether, to the great injury or death of the
plants. Journal de Physique par Delametherie, T. ii. p. 345.</P>
<P>7. Unwholesome or poisonous materials may be applied to
vegetables so as to disease or destroy them; as their absorbent
systems like those of animals are liable to imbibe many noxious
materials, as mentioned in Sect. II. 8. A slight solution of
arsenic, sprinkled on a peach-tree in the spring, destroyed the
branches which received it. A solution of liver of sulphur was
equally fatal to the branches of a nectarine-tree, and also oil of
turpentine.</P>
<P>Mr. Von Uslar affirms, that watering plants with a due quan∣tity
of oxygenated muriatic acid will increase their irritability;
and if carried beyond a certain degree will injure or destroy
the vegetable by giving it too much oxygen; which is known in
due quantity to be a salutary material; and the most necessary
of all others to vegetable as well as to animal life.</P>
<P>8. There are materials called condiments, which are believed
to possess stimulus without nutriment in respect to animal bodies,
as spice, salt, bitters, as the hop, and probably opium and
vinous spirit. These▪ when taken into the stomach increase its
activity, and render the animal for a time fat, and even strong;
but as all increase of stimulus, beyond what is natural, is fol∣lowed
by debility; after a time the animal becomes weak and
emaciated; and enervated in mind as well as body; as is uni∣formly
seen in those who are addicted to the use of much beer
and wine, or of opium; and in a less degree where spice, or
salt, or bitters, are taken in too large quantity.</P>
<P>What then shall we say to the use of common salt in agricul∣ture?
as it is a stimulus, which possesses no nourishment, but may
<PB N="305" REF="311"/>
incite the vegetable absorbent vessels into greater action; it may
in a certain quantity increase their growth by their taking up
more nutriment in a given time, and performing their circula∣tions
and secretions with greater energy. In a greater quantity
its stimulus may be so great as to act as an immediate poison on
vegetables, and destroy the motions of the vessels by exhausting
their irritability.</P>
<P>After a time I suspect vegetables will always be liable to dis∣ease
from this stimulating innutritive material; and that though
it may increase the early growth of the plant, it will injure its
flowering or seed-bearing; and that hence, if it be used at all,
it should be a little before the time, that the plant would acquire
that part of its growth, which is wanted. Thus if the herb or
young stem only be wanted, as in spinage, mercury, asparagus,
apply salt early; if the flower be wanted, as in brocoli and arti∣choke,
or in tulip or hyacinth, moisten them with a slight solu∣tion
of salt, when the flower-bud is formed. When the fruit
or seed is wanted, as in melons or cucumbers, or peas and
beans, apply the solution of salt still later, and at all times with
rather a parsimonious hand. See Sect. X. 7. 4.</P>
<P>Similar to this, where animals diseased with superabundancy
of fat are required, it is customary, I am told, to feed poultry
for the London markets by mixing gin and even opium with
their food, and to keep them in the dark; but they must be
killed as soon as their corpulency is formed, or they soon be∣come
weak, and emaciated like human drunkards. And in some
countries, as in Languedoc in France, the livers of geese and
ducks are required to be enlarged and diseased; as they are
reckoned a dainty by modern epicures, as well as by the an∣cient
ones, who speak of the tumidum jecur anseris; and for
this purpose the animals are kept in the dark, and crammed
with more than their natural quantity of nutriment; but are said
to become lean, and to die, if not killed as soon as this disease
is produced.</P>
<P>It is nevertheless to be observed, that sea-salt as well as
other stimulating condiments may be advantageously used as
medicines, though injurious as common food. Thus it is asserted
by Baron Schulz in the communications to the board of Agri∣culture,
<PB N="306" REF="312"/>
Vol. I. Part III. and IV. p. 318, that it destroys
the fasciola hepatica, or flewk-worm in sheep. Some have re∣commended
one ounce of salt to be given every day dissolved
in water, but it is probable, it might be used with greater ad∣vantage,
if hay was moistened with the solution, which would
thus at the same time supply them with better nourishment than
generally falls to the lot of these diseased sheep, on supposition
that they would eat it.</P>
<P>The rot of sheep, I suspect, arises from the inactivity of the
absorbent vessels of the liver of that animal; whence the bile
is too dilute, especially in moist seasons; whence the flewk-worm,
as I have seen in the shambles, inhabits the common bile-duct
and at length erodes the liver, causing ulcers; which
from the sympathy of the lungs with the liver occasions a cough,
and a hectic fever from the absorption of the matter. Hence
the salt by its additional stimulus may render the bile less dilute
by promoting a greater absorption of its aqueous parts, as well
as a greater secretion of it; which however I suspect would be
much more efficacious, if about sixty grains of iron-filings made
into a ball with flower was given every morning for a week
along with the salt, as further explained in Zoonomia, Part III.
Art. 4. 2. 6. 4.</P>
<P>Since writing the above account of common salt as a condi∣ment,
and the probable consequences attending the use of it,
I have met with some experiments published by Lord Kaimes
in his Gentleman Farmer, which seem much to confirm the
preceding account. He watered some Jerusalem artichokes,
helianthus tuberosus, which were planted in separate pots, with
a solution of fixed vegetable alkali, others with volatile alkali,
others with weak lime water, others with strong lime water,
others with putrid urine, and lastly others with water impreg∣nated
with putrid animal and vegetable substances, I suppose as
they exist in a dunghill. All these saline solutions at first en∣couraged
the growth of the respective plants, so as much to sur∣pass
those in the pot, which was moistened only with common
water, as a standard to compare the others to; but by additional
quantities of the solutions, they all, except the last, gradually
<PB N="307" REF="313"/>
lost their vigour, and perished in the end, as I suppose, by the
excess of stimulus.</P>
<P>There is also an experiment in the works of Mr. Anderson
which seems to shew, that common salt possesses no nutritive qua∣lity
adapted to vegetable growth; and that in some soils, or to
some vegetables, it would seem not even to act as a stimulus or
condimen. He, marked out a circle of six feet diameter in the
middle of a grass field, which he distinguished by driving a stake
in the centre; on this circle he strewed common salt, so as to
lie nearly an inch thick on the ground. The grass sprung up
in this circle in the same manner as in the other parts of the
ground, and the place could only be distinguished by the stake,
though it was left there for some years. Encycl. Britan. Art.
Agriculture. See Sect. X. 7. 5. of this work. This experi∣ment
is worthy to be repeated, lest there might have been some
mistake attending it; as so many authors have given experiments
with contrary results; and as some other neutral salts were shewn
to promote vegetation in the experiments of Dr. Home.</P>
<P>9. Some diseases from external violence have been already
mentioned in this Section, in which the injury is a remote
rather than a proximate cause of the disease, as in the canker
sometimes, and the sap-flow, and gum-secretion. But some
other diseases from external violence have been purposely pro∣duced,
as well as that of etiolation, and turned to advantage;
as the bunches of grapes, which have acquired their full size,
are said to ripen sooner, if the stalk of the bunch be cut half
through. Tournefort says, that the figs in Provence and about
Paris ripen sooner, if the buds be wounded with a straw dipped
in olive-oil. And lastly, the figs in the island of Malta are
made to ripen sooner by caprification; as spoken of in Botanic
Garden, Vol. II. note on Caprificus. And it may daily be
remarked, that those apples and plums ripen sooner, which
have been wounded by insects; and that pears will ripen consi∣derably
sooner, if they be immaturely plucked from the tree,
which must be esteemed injurious to the life of the pear; and
as the conversion of austere acid juices of fruit into sugar in the
process of ripening may be in part chemical, it may proceed more
hastily, when the life of the fruit is impaired or destroyed; as
<PB N="308" REF="314"/>
seems to occur in the drying of germinated barley, and in baking
pears, as well as in bruising apples for the purpose of making
cyder; which last effect might probably be much improved by
the addition of warmth.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>III. DISEASES OCCASIONED BY INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>1. Among the diseases of plants Linneus adds in his Philofo∣phia
Botanica the nests of those insects, which deposit their eggs
in plants; whence a variety of excrescences. These are, 1.
The galls of oak, of ground-ivy, cistus, trembling poplar, wil∣low,
and hawk-weed. 2. Bedequar of roses, or briar-balls.
3. Follicles of pistachia, and black poplar. 4. Contortions of
cerastium, chick-weed, veronica, speedwell, and lotus. 5.
Scales of firs, willows, and roses.</P>
<P>He then adds, that die duplicature and prolification of flowers
is often occasioned by insects, as common chamomile, matri∣caria,
is thus made proliferus; and that carduus caule crispo
bears larger florets, with the pistils growing into leaves, by
he wounds of insects.</P>
<P>It must be observed, that these excrescences on the leaves of
some plants, or mutation of their manner of growth, are not
always the consequence of a simple wound or puncture of the
insects, but of the deposition of their eggs, or young offspring;
which afterwards continue to stimulate the growing plant into
unnatural motions, and consequently into unnatural growth;
like the inflammation and consequent new granulations of flesh
in the wounds of animal bodies; which, if the skin is prevented
from spreading over them, will rise into large subsfances of
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngous flesh; or beneath the skin, where it is loose, as in
wens.</P>
<P>Many flowers are destroyed or rendered unprolific by the
depredation of insects, as rose-buds by the cynips; and I re∣member
observing one dry summer, that every blossom of a
large quince tree was pierced by a fly, and rendered unprolisic
before the blossoms had opened. I have also seen the hood of
the aconite, so replete with an acrid juice, pierced by insects to
plunder it of its honey.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="315"/>
2. The curling of the leaves of nectarine, and peach, and
cherry-trees, with the cells or bladders on their surfaces, are
formed in consequence of the wounds inflicted by the aphis;
in the same manner as the galls and bedeguars on the oak and
sweet-briar by other insects, but without their nidification or
the deposition of their eggs; though from the sudden and gene∣ral
appearance of these injuries they have been ascribed to blights
from inclement weather.</P>
<P>Some observers have believed nevertheless, that these affected
leaves were previously out of health; which occasioned them
to supply a proper situation for those insects, which molest them:
as I have frequently observed, that snails or slugs eat those
leaves, which have been plucked from cucumber plants, and
are beginning to wither; in preference to those, which are
growing in perfect health.</P>
<P>Mr. Lawrence relates, that in June the leaves of some of his
wall-pear-trees were much injured by a hail-storm, which leaves
were afterwards blighted, and become full of tumours from
insects; and the pears, which were then as large as walnuts,
all perished. On this Mr. Bradley remarks, that insects gene∣rally
lay their eggs on the dead or putrefying parts both of vege∣table
and animal bodies; and adds a conjecture, that the parent
insects may circulate in the juices of the plant, which however
is not probable, as though microscopic animals have been dis∣covered
in the stagnating juices of animal bodies, as in the pus∣tules
of the itch, and in the faeces in the dysentery, and even
in the semen, which may have stagnated in the vesiculae semina∣les;
yet no such animalculeae have, I believe, ever been detected
in recent blood, or any recent secretions from it.</P>
<P>A predilection for some withered leaves appears also in larger
animals as well as in insects; cows will eat young thistles,
a few hours after they are cut down, as their prickles become
flaccid; and horses refuse the young shoots of yew-trees, as they
grow; but will eat them when they are cut off, and begin to
wither; and on that account lose a part of their acrimony;
though there is still often sufficient poison within them to de∣stroy
the animal. And it is even probable, that when the leaves
of yew are withered to a greater degree, their poisonous acri∣mony
<PB N="310" REF="316"/>
becomes so far destroyed, that they cease to be deleterious
to horses; so that in Hesse in Germany it is customary in the
winter to crop the young shoots of yew-trees, and mixing them
with other provender to give them as common food to horses.
See Anderson on Agriculture, Vol. III. p. 590.</P>
<P>On this account if wall-trees are frequently watered by an
engine, so as to moisten their leaves or branches as well as the
ground at their roots on the dry days in spring, by which they
will be kept in vigorous growth, I was told, that they would
totally or nearly escape the depredations of insects; but I found
by an experiment well conducted on three trees, that this
management had no effect; and I also observed in the spring
and summer of this year, 1798, which seems to have much
favoured the production of the aphis, that they attacked the
most healthy leaves of peach and nectarine trees, as well as the
others; and that plums, cherries, black currants, and many
other trees suffered by their depredations, though previously in
perfect vigour. And lastly, that on repeatedly having washed
off many thousands of aphises from peach and nectarine leaves
by a strong stream from a forcible water-engine, that they evi∣dently
crawled again up the stems of the trees, or on the wall
to which they were nailed, as in another day the lowermost
branches were thus more infested with them than the upper
ones.</P>
<P>The history of the aphis, puceron, or vine-fretter, is so cu∣rious,
the destruction it commits on the foliage of the peach and
nectarine is in dry summers so irresistible, and its existence on
other trees so extensive, that it demands our particular attention.
See No. 1. 7. of this Section. From the observations of Swam∣merden,
Bonnet, Dr. Richardson, and of other philosophers,
this extraordinary insect rises in the spring from eggs, which
are said to be attached by the parent aphis to the twigs of trees
in the autumn, and are believed to produce not a larva or cater∣pillar,
but a progeny similar to the parent; every one of which
produces in about ten days not an egg, but another living pro∣geny
to the ninth generation, without being connected amato∣rially
with each other. The ninth generation produces males
and females, some of both kinds with wings, and others without
<PB N="311" REF="317"/>
them; and this tenth generation from those, which-were hatched
from eggs, become amatorially connected, and produce eggs;
which are laid on the new twigs of various trees for the next
year's progeny to be hatched by the vernal sun. Philos. Transact.
Vol. LXI. p. 182.</P>
<P>In this uncommon circumstance the eggs of the aphis resemble
the seeds of plants; which first produce some successive genera∣tions
of leaf buds, which are a viviparous progeny, before they
again produce seeds, which are their oviparous progeny, as
mentioned in Sect. IX. 3. 1. of this work. Nor is this to be
ascribed to what has been termed equivocal generation, or to
an impregnation of nine fetuses enclosed within each other, as
some have supposed. But this central production of the vivipa∣rous
progeny of the aphis seems to resemble the lateral produc∣tion
of a viviparous progeny from the polypus, which in time
detach themselves from their parents; like the buds▪ of the poly∣gonum
viviparum, or the bulbs of the magical onion, allium
magicum; which are produced from the flower-cup instead of
seeds, and in time detach themselves, and fall on the ground.
So that these aphises are not, I suppose, to be esteemed fecun∣dated
females, but proliferous males, as explained in Zoonomia,
Vol. I. Sect. 39. on generation.</P>
<P>This double mode of reproduction, so exactly resembling the
buds and seeds of trees, accounts for the wonderful increase of
this insect; which according to Dr. Richardson consists of ten
generations, and of fifty at an average in each generation; so that
the sum of fifty multiplied by fifty, and that product again mul∣tiplied
by fifty nine times, would give the product of one egg
only in countless millions; to which must be added the innu∣merable
eggs laid by the tenth generation for the renovation of
their progeny in the ensuing spring.</P>
<P>Their punctures of the leaves of peach and nectarine trees
in the vernal months, and of cherry, plum, and currant trees
in the summer, produce a swelling and elevation of the cuticle
of the leaf on its upper side, and a consequent curling of it with
its upper surface outwards, which terminates in a destruction of
it to the great injury of the tree, and frequently to the death
of it; while the leaves of the nut-trees, mentioned above, in
<PB N="312" REF="318"/>
No. 1. 7. of this section, appeared to be but little injured by
them, though fifty or a hundred of these insects were seen under
every leaf about Midsummer, both before and after their affusion
with the honey-dew.</P>
<P>From Dr. Richardson's account the aphises on the rose-tree
appeared in February, when the weather happened to be warm,
from small black oval eggs; which were deposited on the last
year's shoots in autumn; and that, when the weather became
colder, great numbers of them perished, by which circumstance
the rose-trees are in some years almost freed from them.</P>
<P>They came to their full growth before April, and after hav∣ing
twice cast off their exuviae, every one of them produced
about fifty young ones; all of which came into the world back∣wards,
and adhered sometime to the vent of the parent by their
mouths or forepart; as shewn in a magnified state at fig. 2. plate
IX; and were at length set down on some tender shoots of the
plant, and came to maturity in about ten days, casting off their
coats two, three, or four times.</P>
<P>The ninth generation in October consisted of males as well
as females, which were seen to cohabit; and the eggs produced
by their intercourse, he asserts, were deposited generally near
the new buds, or on other parts of the twigs of the trees, which
they possessed. These were at first green, but in a few days
became brown, and by degrees quite black. They were of
regular oval figures about one tenth of an inch in length, and
about half as broad, and adhered firmly by means of something
glutinous, and resisted the severity of the winter.</P>
<P>Other insects, which are produced from eggs, and become
winged butterflies or moths, live for some time in the inter∣mediate
state of caterpillars or larvae. During this state of their
existence they feed on the leaves, on which they are hatched;
or on fruits or kernels; but after they have acquired wings and
organs of reproduction, some of them take no food, as the silk-worm;
and others live only upon honey, as bees, and moths,
and butterflies. Now the aphis, I suppose, has no intermediate
state between the egg and the fly, and therefore makes no holes
in the leaves by eating them; or if any of them previously exist
in a caterpillar, or larva state, it can be only those which are
<PB N="313" REF="319"/>
produced from eggs in the early spring, which is worthy of fu∣ture
attention.</P>
<P>Whence I suppose, that this fly lives not by consuming the
foliage of the plants, which it inhabits; but by piercing the
pulmonary vessels in their natural state, or the lymphatic vessels
of the leaf in their retrograde state, by a sine tube or proboscis,
which it possesses, and which it may be seen by a common lens
perpetually to employ, as shewn under its chin in the magnified
insect at figure first of plate IX. For the sap-juice or vegetable
chyle is brought from the radicles of each leaf-bud, and propel∣led
up the long caudex to the pulmonary artery of the leaf,
where it becomes oxygenated, and converted into vegetable
blood. And may thus be extracted by the tubes of these insects
before its sanguification.</P>
<P>Perhaps those aphises, which were from eggs, might eat some
part of the peach leaves during their larva state, if such exists,
and occasion them to curl up. While those, which were a vi∣viparous
progeny, might only pierce the sap-vessels, or blood-vessels,
and thus not apparently injure the leaves; as on the nut-trees,
where perhaps they were not hatched from eggs, but
might have come thither in their winged state, and have then
produced their innumerable viviparous offspring; as on the nut-trees
above mentioned I could not discern the eggs, from which
they were hatched, and a few larger aphises with wings ap∣peared
early in the season amongst the smaller ones without
wings.</P>
<P>We may finally conjecture on this interesting subject, first,
that the aphises produced from eggs early in the spring may
have a larva or caterpillar state, and that during that state they
may feed on the young leaves of peaches, nectarines, plums,
and cherries, and thus occasion them to curl and die. 2. That
those, which are not from eggs, have no larva state, and only
puncture the larger chyle vessels of the young twigs, or the
pulmonary arteries of the leaves, which receive the vegetable
sap-juice from the roots, and thus that they suck it up, and live
on it, before it is converted into blood, as moths, butterflies,
and bees, live on honey in their winged state, though on other
parts of vegetables, as on their leaves, or anther-dust, in their
<PB N="314" REF="320"/>
larva state; and that these punctures are attended with no visible
injury to the leaf. 3. That for a week or two about Midsum∣mer,
when the umbilical vessels of the new buds convey the
sap-juice to them, or to the reservoirs of nutriment preparing for
them, that the aphises by piercing these vessels, or the pulmo∣nary
arteries of the leaves, acquire so large a quantity of this
saccharine material, that it passes through them almost unchang∣ed,
falling on the leaves and ground beneath them, and pro∣duces
what is called the honey-dew; but that this happens only
for a short season, as a week or two about Midsummer, during
the production of the new buds. And lastly, that the black
powdery material on the upper surfaces of the leaves of the nut-trees
and plum-trees, and of the shrubs which grow beneath
them, is an excrement from the aphises, which hang on the
under surfaces of the leaves above them, like the black bitter
powder in the nut-shell; which is the excrement of the cur∣cul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o,
which has eaten the sweet kernel.</P>
<P>Secondly, having last year written the above, I have had
another opportunity of attending to the aphis during the sum∣mer
of 1799, and shall add the further remarks, which I have
been able to make on this most curious and important animal,
which may in process of time destroy the vegetable world.</P>
<P>As the month of June was again in this summer very dry,
though not very warm, the aphis was propagated in immense
numbers on a great variety of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous
plants. The row of nut-trees mentioned in No. 1. 7. of this
Section was infested with a greater number of them this year
than in the preceding one; yet during the season about Midsum∣mer
there was so little honey-dew this year, that it might have
escaped observation, if it had not been particularly attended to;
yet what did appear was only on the upper surfaces of those
leaves which had other leaves impending over them crowded
with aphises; whence I had no doubt, but that it was voided
by the millions of aphises, which adhered on the under surfaces
of those superior leaves with their backs downwards.</P>
<P>On examining them with a strong magnifier I could frequently
perceive them insert their proboscis or trunk into the vessels of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e inferior surface of the leaf; and particularly observed, that
<PB N="315" REF="321"/>
when they were not moving from place to place, that they gene∣rally
stood with their heads towards the foot-stalk of the leaf of
nut-trees, or towards the base of the twigs of plum-trees, which
circumstance I shewed to many of my friends.</P>
<P>Both before and after the existence of the honey-dew a black
material, which was sometimes moist and sometimes dry, ap∣peared
on the upper surfaces of those leaves only, which had
other leaves crowded with aphises over them, and even on the
upper surface of the leaves of some herbaceous plants, which
grew under these nut-trees, and also on others, which grew
under plum-trees, which were much infested with an aphis of a
greener colour.</P>
<P>To prove beyond possibility of error that this black matter
was dejected on the leaves below by the aphises, which were
walking with their heads downwards on those above, I sewed
slightly with a needle and thread under several leaves a piece
of writing paper about the size of the leaf; and observed on
the next day that many black marks were distinguishable on the
paper.</P>
<P>On plum-trees and on many herbaceous plants innumerable
aphises were seen on the upper tender part of the upright shoots,
adhering with their heads downwards; and on the hanging
shoots with their heads upwards; and inserting their proboscis
into the vessels, I suppose, which contained the ascending sap-juice.
But on the nut-trees the most tender or uppermost parts
of the young shoots were covered with very numerous bristles,
which appeared to be an armour purposely produced to defend
them from these destructive insects, and hence they were princi∣pally
found on the under surfaces of the leaves.</P>
<P>As the chyle of animals is mixed with the venous blood,
and is immediately projected by the force of the heart into the
pulmonary artery, at the extremities of which it is principally
converted into blood by its exposure to the air; so in the vege∣table
system the sap-juice must be mixed with the returning ve∣nous
blood, and carried forwards to the extremities of the pul∣monary
artery of the leaf, before it is converted into vegetable
blood. These pulmonary arteries pass along the under surfaces
of leaves, as the upper surfaces of them are covered by the fine
<PB N="316" REF="322"/>
terminations of them on an air-membrane for the purpose of
respiration; hence on these under surfaces of leaves the aphises
adhere, and pierce the branches of the pulmonary arteries with
their proboscis standing with their heads towards the stalk, of
the leaf, that they may thus meet the streams of chyle or
sap-juice yet unchanged into blood; which accounts both for
their existing in all kinds of weather on the inferior side of the
leaves, and for their standing with their heads towards the foot-stalks
of them. Thus on an upright twig of a plum-tree I this
day observed a number of aphises adhere with their heads down∣wards
with their proboscises inserted into the tender stem, and
so near to each other, that the tail part of the lower ones ex∣tended
one third of their length over the head part of those
above them, and gave somewhat the appearance of scales;
while on the hanging twigs they adhered with their heads up∣wards,
still intent to meet the streams of sap-juice in the ascend∣ing
chyle vessels, or in the pulmonary arteries.</P>
<P>Dr. Bradley and others observe, that about Midsummer there
appears to be a pause in vegetation, and at this time the new
buds are generated; and Duhamil and others found, that the
bark of several trees became at this time as easily to be separated
from the alburnum as in the spring; as is related in Sect. III.
2. 8. of this work. At this time therefore there exists a new
flow of sap-juice to supply present nutriment, or to furnish a re∣servoir
of future nutriment to the newly generated or expected
embryon, either before or after its vivification, or its impregna∣tion,
if such a process may be supposed to occur in the produc∣tion
of buds.</P>
<P>At this time then, when there exists a summer-flow of sap-juice,
this pernicious insect in uncounted millions pierces the
sap-vessels round the new shoots, or the pulmonary arteries be∣neath
the leaves; and thus drinks the vegetable chyle, or sap-juice,
with such avidity, as to part with much of it again almost
unchanged. This I now believe with Sauvage to be the origin
of one kind of honey-dew certainly; and if another kind of
honey-dew exists, as he mentions, where there are no aphises,
I suspect, as observed in No. 1. 7. of this Section, that it must
arise from the inverted action of the lymphatic vessels of the
<PB N="317" REF="323"/>
leaf, at the time of the increased quantity of sap-juice about
Midsummer; but have not had an opportunity to ascertain these
facts.</P>
<P>Thirdly, There appears to be a power impressed on organized
bodies by the great author of all things, by which they not only
increase in size and strength from their embryon state to their
maturity, and occasionally cure their accidental diseases, and
repair their accidental injuries, but also a power of produc∣ing
armour to prevent those more violent injuries, which
would otherwise destroy them. Of this last kind are the poi∣sonous
juices of some plants, as of atropa belladonna, deadly
nightshade, hyoscyamus, hen-bane, cynoglossum, hounds-tongue.
Other plants are armed with thorns and prickles to prevent the
depredation of animals, as ilex, holly, crataegus, hawthorn,
ribes grossularia, gooseberry; the leaves of which would be
perpetually devoured but for this kind of protection. Other
plants secrete a viscid juice to agglutinate the insects, which
crawl up towards their fructification, as silene, catchfly, drosera,
sun-dew; and others by the contraction of their leaves or petals
arrest or destroy the insects, which attack them, as dionoea
muscipula, and apocynum androsemifolium.</P>
<P>But how can vegetables protect the whole inferior surfaces of
their leaves, and of their young rising stems from the innumera∣ble
progeny of the destructive aphis, which penetrates their
chyle vessels and their arteries; and which from their immense
numbers may in process of time destroy the vegetable world.
Many vegetables have not yet acquired any means of defence,
and have therefore the first growth of their foliage much injured,
or totally destroyed by this destructive insect, as the nectarine, and
peach, and plum, and cherry-trees, in many parts of this coun∣try,
as is every year seen and lamented.</P>
<P>Some vegetables have nevertheless already acquired an ar∣mour,
which lessens, though it does not totally prevent, the in∣juries
of this animal. This is most conspicuous on the stems
and floral-leaves of moss-roses, and on the young shoots and
leaf-stalks of nut-trees. Both these are covered with thickset
bristles, which terminate in globular-heads, and not only pre∣vent
the aphis from surrounding them in such great numbers,
<PB N="318" REF="324"/>
and from piercing their vessels so easily, but also secrete from the
gland, with which I suspect them to be terminated, a juice;
which is inconvenient, or deleterious to the insect which touches
it.</P>
<P>Hence moss-roses appear to be less injured by the aphis, than
other roses, which have less of this armour; and while on
plum-trees, and on many herbaceous plants, they hang round the
upright young shoots with their heads downwards, and insert
their trunks, so as totally to conceal the rising shoot; yet on
nut-trees, though they are seen in millions beneath the leaves on
the unarmed parts, they never appear round the young shoots,
nor on the large trunks of the vessels beneath the leaves, all
which have acquired a panoply of bristles with glandular heads
to them, like those round the moss-rose, but without the
branching structure of the latter. While those plants, which
are not infested with the legions of this self-productive animal,
have probably acquired some material mixed with their sap-juice,
or blood, which is poisonous to them; as those plants,
which possess a milky or yellow blood, as the spurges euphorbia,
or the celandines chelidonium, or the fig-tree, ficus.</P>
<P>Nor is this more astonishing, than that the holly-trees should
annually supply prickles only to their lower leaves, about six or
eight feet from the ground, as high as the animals can reach
them, which would prey upon them; but refuse the expence of
putting forth prickles in their higher branches, which are saved
by their situation, as I have repeatedly observed on the nume∣rous
holly-trees, which are the ornament of Needwood forest.</P>
<P>From hence I suspect, that another reason, why the leaves of
nut-trees and of rose-trees are not curled up or blistered like
those of nectarines, peaches, plums, and cherries, is because
their foot-stalks, and the larger branches of the pulmonary ar∣teries,
are defended by these bristles, which are perhaps only
beginning to appear on the leaf-stalks of the plum, but which
may increase in the progression of time; as all the works of
nature may be approaching to greater perfection, as mentioned
more at large in No. 2 of the last Section of this work.</P>
<P>Fourthly. The means of destroying an insect so extensively
injurious not only to gardens and hot-houses, but to half the
<PB N="319" REF="325"/>
vegetable world, would be indeed a valuable discovery. If the
eggs exist on the young buds, as Dr. Richardson affirms, some
application to these, before they are hatched, which might dis∣solve
their shells, as by very dilute marine acid injected on them;
or by some adhesive material, which might inviscate them as
soon as they are hatched, whether they appear first in their larva
state, like minute caterpillars, or in the form of the parent
aphis, as soap-suds injected on the twigs before the leaves begin
to unfold; or perhaps by rubbing them with oil or glue by
means of a sponge, or a painter's brush; but experiments alone
can determine the effect of these applications, both on the insect
and on the tree.</P>
<P>Lime water alone will not readily destroy the aphis, as I ob∣served
by immersing leaves with aphises on them; which crept
up the leaves, and thus escaped. But if pot-ash, or fixed al∣kali,
be mixed with lime, the solution becomes so caustic as to
destroy many insects without injuring the foliage of trees, or the
stems of wheat, if we may credit M. Socoloff, who in the
transactions of an Academy at Petersburgh, Vol. V. asserts,
that he added three parts of quick-lime newly made to two parts
of a saturated solution of fixed alkali in water; which poured
on the ground destroyed the earth-worms, and sprinkled on the
leaves of trees destroyed the caterpillars, but did not injure, or
much injure thee foliage of trees, or the leaves of wheat plants.</P>
<P>Tar water has lately been said to destroy slugs, white snails
without shells, and might be worthy a trial by injecting it on
trees at first with caution, lest it should injure them; as it is
probably the vegetable acid chiefly, with a small portion of
essential oil, which is disolved, or mixed with the water, by
agitation. See No 3. 5. of this Section.</P>
<P>Previous to the pullulation of the buds, it is also believed to
be of great service to water wall-trees with lime-water, or with
soap-suds, or perhaps with the addition of some pot-ash to either
of them to make a more caustic ley, such as is recommended
for steeping seed-wheat; but this with caution, as I have known
a solution of hepar sulphuris kill the branches of a tree, which
were moistened with it, as well as the insects, which were upon
<PB N="320" REF="326"/>
it. Nor am I certain that this will answer the purpose from the
observations I have heard from those, who have tried it.</P>
<P>The essential oils are all deleterious to certain insects, and
hence their use in the vegetable economy, being produced in
flowers or leaves to protect them from the depredations of their
voracious enemies. One of the essential oils, that of turpen∣tine,
is recommended by M. de Thosse for the purpose of de∣stroying
insects, which infect both vegetables and animals.
Having observed that the trees were attacked by multitudes of
small insects of different colours (pucins ou pucerons), which
injured their young branches, he destroyed them all entirely in
the following manner. He put into a bowl a few handfuls of
earth, on which he poured a small quantity of oil of turpentine;
he then beat the whole together with a spatula, pouring on it
water, till it became of the consistence of soup; with this mix∣ture
he moistened the ends of the branches, and both the insects
and their eggs were destroyed, and other insects kept aloof by
the scent of the turpentine. He adds, that he destroyed the
fleas of his puppies by once bathing them in warm water im∣pregnated
with oil of turpentine. Mem. d' Agriculture, An.
1787, Printemp. p. 109.</P>
<P>I sprinkled some oil of turpentine by means of a brush on
some branches of a nectarine-tree, which was covered with the
aphis; but it killed both the insect and the branches. A solu∣tion
of arsenic much diluted did the same. Might not the scent
of turpentine, or of tar, smeared on a fruit-wall deter the flies
from approaching the trees to deposit their eggs? or might not
arsenic mixed with honey be smeared on the wall, to which the
trees are nailed, be likely to attract the aphis as well as other
kinds of flying insects. But none of these should be smeared on
the branches, lest it injure or destroy the tree. Perhaps if a
few twigs smeared with turpentine, mixed with a little oil of
turpentine to make it more fluid, and to increase its odour,
were fixed in quince-trees, or in apple-trees, the flowers of
which are liable to be destroyed by the eggs deposited in them
by a small fly; they might be deterred from approaching the
tree, as the great use of essential oils, which cause the fra∣grance
<PB N="321" REF="327"/>
of flowers, seems to be to deter insects from infesting
their leaves, or preying upon their honey.</P>
<P>It is probable, that if infusions were made in hot water, or
perhaps for a longer time in cold water, of those leaves which
no insects devour; as of the walnut, juglans; lauro-cerasus,
laurel; foxglove, digitalis; hen-bane, hyoscyamus; hounds-tongue,
cynoglossum; rag-wort, senecio jacobaea; or of tobac∣co,
nicotiana; and many others; and were sprinkled on the
curled leaves of wall-trees, or on the buds before they open, by
a pump, or by a brush, or sponge; they might destroy the in∣sects
without injuring the trees, which might be determined by a
few experiments.</P>
<P>The dust of tobacco is frequently spread on affected leaves,
but not I believe with very encouraging success, owing perhaps
to the powder not being very fine, or not soon enough applied.
Some kinds of lime strewed on in powder might probably be
too caustic, and destroy the leaf along with the insects; which
also might be subjected to experiment. The powder of sulphur,
or of tobacco, or of any of the poisonous leaves above men∣tioned,
might be injected upon affected trees by a powder-puff,
such as hair-dressers use, or the smoke of tobacco, or of any
other of the poisonous leaves above mentioned, might be forci∣bly
blown on them by an adapted pair of bellows, as the smoke
of many of them may possess as poisonous a quality as that of
tobacco; and even the steam of a decoction of others, as of
lauro-cerasus, and walnut; the poison of the former of which
is known to rise in distillation, might probably be used with ef∣fect;
but this must depend on the greater or less fixity of their
essential oils. The smoke or steam might be applied to wall-trees
by previously suspending over them a large sheet of mat∣ting,
or of linen, or of paper, or an old carpet; but may how∣ever
be used with greater advantage in hot-houses, than in the
open air.</P>
<P>Since the above was written I directed in the early spring of
this year one nectarine-tree to be moistened with tar-water, and
parts of the wall to be smeared with tar; another to be moisten∣ed
with lime and pot-ash dissolved in water; a third with soap-suds
and lime added to them; and many both nectarine and
<PB N="322" REF="328"/>
peach-trees with soap-suds alone. This was done by means of
a brush before any flowers appeared, and was repeated thrice
on different days; but to my great disappointment, when the
leaves appeared, they became affected with the aphis as on
former years. I also afterwards dipped many nut-leaves crowd∣ed
with the aphis in strong infusion of tobacco, for a few mi∣nutes,
as the leaves hung on the trees without, as I believed,
destroying the insects; though some of them appeared for a
time to be rendered torpid.</P>
<P>Nevertheless on covering a low nut-tree with some sheets of
brown paper sewed together, and throwing the smoke of to∣bacco
under it from a proper pair of bellows, great numbers of
aphises were killed, many of which dropped from the upper
leaves on those below them, and many adhered motionless to
the under surfaces of the leaves. The fine powder of tobacco
called Scotch snuff sprinkled on the aphises by turning up some
of the leaves quickly destroyed them.</P>
<P>As walnut-leaves may be had in great quantity in the autumn,
and the whole plant of senecio jacobaea, rag-wort, at any time,
both which are probably deleterious to insects, as they seem ne∣ver
to be injured by them, these might be procured at small
expence, and might probably, when dried and burnt, produce a
smoke equally destructive to them.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The most ingenious manner of destroying the aphis
would be effected by the propagation of its greatest enemy, the
larva of the aphidivorous fly; of which I have given a print,
and which is said by Reaumeur, Tom. III. Mem. 9. to deposit
its eggs, where the aphis abounds; and that, as soon as the
larvae are produced, they devour hundreds around them with
the necessity of no other movements but by turning to the right
or left, arresting the aphis and sucking its juices. If these eggs
could be collected and carefully preserved during the winter, and
properly disposed on nectarine and peach-trees in the early
spring, or protected from injury in hot-houses; it is probable,
that this plague of the aphis might be counteracted by the na∣tural
means of devouring one insect by another; as the serpent
of Moses devoured those of the magicians.</P>
<P>Mr. Horrocks of Derby shewed me this larva of the aphidi∣vorous
<PB N="323" REF="329"/>
fly, which I saw devour two or three aphises, and Mr.
Swanwick of this town at my request made an accurate draw∣ing
both of the larva and fly, which he kindly favoured me
with, accompanied with the following note.</P>
<P>“On August the 4th Mr. Horrocks obligingly sent me an
aphidivorous larva in a box on a leaf of a plum-tree, on which
were a number of aphises; and I had almost immediately the
pleasure of seeing it eat one.</P>
<P>“The method of taking his prey is thus: he is like the sloth
in his disposition, for he does not ramble about, while he has
food around him. He only lifts up his head, and strikes it
down again, extending it in various directions, as if he was
blind, and repeating the above action. If by so doing he hap∣pens
to feel an aphis, he immediately seizes it by the back, lifts
it up and poises it in the air, as if to prevent it from liberating
itself by its struggles against the surface of the leaf, or that it
may fall more easily into the cavity of his mouth. In this posi∣tion
he holds it, while he pierces it, and sucks the juice out of
the body; which having done, he drops the skin, licks his lips
round with his little black tongue, contracts his head, and
drops it down; thus resting in perfect repose for some time,
after which he repeats the same actions. But if he is in the
midst: of plenty, he seldom gives himself this trouble, but waits
till an aphis touches him, when he immediately turns his head
round, and with fatal certainty seizes him, poizing him as be∣fore.</P>
<P>“For the purpose of seeing what fly was produced from this
caterpillar, I procured him food for about ten days. During
this time he eat a great number of aphises, and grew to about an
inch in length; when he left off eating, contracted himself to
about half his former length, fixed himself to the box by a
little gluten, which he discharged from his mouth, and without
casting a skin changed to a chrysalis.</P>
<P>“In this state he lay about ten or eleven days, at the end of
which time he burst his cell, and came out a beautiful fly, of
which the figure is a good representation.”</P>
<P>No. 1. The caterpillar with an aphis in his mouth.</P>
<P>No. 2. The chrysalis open at one end.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="330"/>
No. 3. The fly.</P>
<P>Another enemy to the aphis is said to be a beautiful small
spotted beetle, called a lady-bird by the people. Several of
these were seen on the nut-leaves, and are believed first to ap∣pear
there in their larva state, and to feed on the aphis; they
then change to a chrysalis, and lastly to a small wing-sheathed
beetle; and finally, I suppose, they bore holes into the earth,
as would appear from their possessing sheaths to their wings, and
that they there deposit their eggs to be hatched, and to climb
the trees infested with the aphis in the ensuing spring.</P>
<P>Thus from the exertions of a few aphidivorous larvae or ca∣terpillars,
from the poisonous juices of some plants, and from
the bristly armour on the young twigs and leaves of others, the
vegetable world is so far protected from the destruction with
which it has been, and is threatened, by the fine proboscis of
this multitudinous insect, which in its manner of attack resem∣bles
that of the large bat of Asia, vespertilio-vampyris; which
is asserted by Linneus to drink the blood by night of servants,
who sleep in the open air, Syst. Natur. p. 46; and is said by
others to be so skilful an operator as not to wake the patient by
the puncture, which it inflicts, as it agreeably fans them with
its wings.</P>
<P>3. Many of the orchards of apple-trees in this country are
liable to lose all their leaves by the depredations of caterpillars;
the same occurs to gooseberry-trees in some gardens, and to
cabbages in the latter part of the summer.</P>
<P>A few years ago I observed, that the blossoms of the quince-tree,
before they were quite expended, were perforated by a
fly; as the wound could be easily discerned like that on young
nuts, when wounded by the curculio; and all the blossoms of a
large tree were thus destroyed by a small caterpillar. And in
this late summer of 1799 the apple-blossoms in this country are
much injured by a caterpillar, which ecats the seed in the peri∣carp
of each blossom either before or at the time of its im∣pregnation,
the petals of the flower closing again over it and
dying.</P>
<P>The leaves of many trees are renewed after having been to∣tally
destroyed in the early part of the season; as those of the
<PB N="325" REF="331"/>
apple-tree above mentioned, which had lost its leaves entirely
by lightning; as the mulberry-trees in Italy, which are thus
robbed of their first leaves to feed silk-worms, as the tea-tree
in China, which is thus robbed for a fashionable potation.
And lastly, as the euonymus, or spindle-tree, which in this
country has its first crop of leaves almost perpetually destroyed
by caterpillars. But though the leaves are restored after the
depredation of this insect, yet there follows an irremediable
injury to the fruit. See Sect. IX. 2. 6.</P>
<P>As the eggs of butterflies are in the autumn wisely deposited
in situations, where the young can find proper food, when they
are hatched by the warmth of the spring; those on apple-trees,
and on gooseberry-trees, are frequently deposited on the leaves,
as well as on other parts of the tree; and as these leaves fall on
the ground, the eggs are thus covered and protected from the
frosts, and the young caterpillars are believed to climb the trees
in search of their food. If this be true, it would be an ad∣vantageous
practice to rake together the leaves in orchards, and
to burn them; which some have done from an idea, that the
smoke thus produced was noxious to the eggs of insects depo∣sited
on the branches.</P>
<P>Some gardeners for this purpose rear their gooseberry-trees on
one stem only; and believe, that by tying a fringe round this
stem the insects, which are hatched in the soil, if such there be,
can not climb up the tree thus surrounded with a fringe; and as
those caterpillars, which are already on the tree, let themselves
down by a thread, when the tree is shaken, from the fear of
being hurt by the vibrating twigs; if this thread be then broken,
by moving a stick round under the tree, these insects cannot re∣ascend.
A paper recently tarred on the outside might be
wrapped round the stem of the tree instead of the fringe with
perhaps more certain success; but the tar should not be smeared
on the bark of the tree, left it should injure or destroy it.</P>
<P>It may be observed in the choice of apple-trees, that those
kinds, which flower early, are less liable to the depredation of
insects; and those, which flower late, are less liable to the in∣juries
of frost. In apple-trees perhaps the former is in some
situation the greater evil, but in pears I should suspect the latter,
<PB N="326" REF="332"/>
the blossoms of which are so often totally destroyed by one
night's frost.</P>
<P>The white butterflies, which deposit their eggs on cabbage
plants, are seen flying about awkwardly in summer, and should
be caught, and destroyed by the gardener. Or they perhaps
might be invited and poisoned by a mixture of honey, and wa∣ter,
and arsenic; as a wealthy man in Italy was said to have
poisoned his neighbour's bees. See Sect. VI. 6. 3. These
cabbage-caterpillars would increase in destructive numbers, but
are half of them annually destroyed by a small ichneumon fly;
which deposits its own eggs in their backs, which are there
hatched by the warmth of the animal, and live on the silk
there secreted for its future nest; and eroding their way out
spin small cacoons of their own; ten or twelve of which hang
on each caterpillar; which thus perishes instead of changing
into a butterfly. This I saw happen to a great many of them,
which were put into a box on bran with a few cabbage leaves,
and covered with gauze, a few days before they were ready to
change into chrysolists. This ichneumon fly should therefore
be encouraged, if his winter habitation could be discovered.</P>
<P>4. The variety of insects, which infest hot-houses, as the
aca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us, thrips, aphis, and cocci, and the means commonly used
to destroy them by the smoke of tobacco, or by the powder of
sulphur and tobacco, or by solutions of lime and sulphur, are
described in Speechly's books on the Vine and Pine; but re∣quire
some caution in their application. A friend of mine, by
subjecting a wall-tree to the smoke of sulphur by hanging a matt
before it during the fumigation, killed both the insects and the
tree.</P>
<P>5. Other kinds of insects are produced beneath the soil, or
occasionally retire into terrestrial habitations. Of these are the
various families of snails, with and without shells, and other
insects with sheaths over their wings, with which they are fur∣nished
to prevent any injury from the friction of the sides of the
holes they make or descend into.</P>
<P>It has been lately supposed, that the great destruction of the
crops of turnips, which occasionally occurs, is owing to the de∣predation
of a white slug, or snail, which comes out of the soil
<PB N="327" REF="333"/>
before sun-rise in dewy mornings; and that by rolling the young
turnips with a heavy roller before sun-rise for a few mornings,
these pernicious insects may be destroyed, and add manure to
the rising plants they have injured.</P>
<P>The white slugs in gardens are very destructive to many
flower-stems, as they rise out of the ground, as to dictamnus
fraxinella, apocynum androsemifolium, to phaseolus, kidney∣bean,
to cinara, artic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oke, and many other plants. I well re∣member
in one season favourable to their production in a garden
by the side of the Derwent observing, that many artichoke
stems above a foot high were eaten by them near the moist earth
till they fell down, like trees felled by the ax. It has lately
been asserted, that watering the ground with tar-water will de∣stroy
them; which may be made by adding a few pounds of
tar to a hogshead of water, and well stirring it, without per∣ceptible
injury to the tar. A circle of lime round the flower-stems,
or of salt, or even of bran in dry weather, are means of
preventing the approach of slugs; and some gardeners lay a
board lightly on the ground between the alleys, under which
the slugs hide themselves when the sun rises, and are hence
easily caught and destroyed.</P>
<P>The leaves of the young turnip are also believed to be de∣stroyed
by a fly; which, if it be of the scarabaeus, or beetle
kind, which arises out of the earth, may likewise be destroyed
by rolling. The Chinese are said by Sir G. Staunton to steep
all their seeds in liquid manure until they swell, and their ger∣mination
begins to appear; which they believe not only hastens
he growth of the plants, but also defends them against insects
beneath the soil; and that to this Sir George observes it may
be owing, that the Chinese turnips escape the fly so injurious to
them in this country. Embassy to China, 8vo. edit. Vol. III.
p. 310. An observation of Mr. Guillet in the Bath Agricul∣ture,
Vol. II. Art. 44, seems to confirm this idea. He asserts,
that when turnip seed is sown during rain, or has rain immedi∣ately
afterwards, that the first leaves are so vigorous that the fly<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
never attacks them; or that the rain itself is so inconvenient to
the fly, as to prevent its appearance. It is also asserted by Mr.
Exeter in the Transactions of the London Society for Arts,
<PB N="328" REF="334"/>
Vol. XVI. p. 191, that the sowing turnips in drills deeper than
by broad cast, accelerates the growth of the plant by giving it
more moisture; whence it sooner puts forth its rough leaves,
and escapes the depredations of the fly. He speaks highly of
the use of the drill, advises the rows to be one foot distant,
uses three quarters of a pound of seed to an acre, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws
them from one inch and a half to two inches deep.</P>
<P>6. The great numbers and varieties of animated beings▪
which live under the soil, and sleep in winter, descending be∣neath
the reach of frost, is truly astonishing. I once observed
such immense numbers of small wing-sheathed insects, which I
believed to be the scarabaeus solstitialis, or fern-chaffer, as they
were not one-sixth part of the size of a May-chaffer, scarabaeus
melolontha, though much of the same form and colour; which
arose out of the ground near the cold bath at Lichfield, that I
guessed, that one or two emerged from every square inch of
many acres of land.</P>
<P>The grubs or maggots, from which these wing-sheathed flies
arose, I suspect in some seasons and situations favourable to
their production to be very destructive to the wheat in spring, or
the early part to summer, devouring the stem near the surface
of the ground at the joint, which is sweet, till it falls down or
withers, by which many crops were nearly destroyed this year,
1797, and that, I was informed, on some lands, which had
been previously well limed.</P>
<P>Mr. Tull in his husbandry, speaking of wheat, advises not to
sow it deeper than an inch, since the thread or caudex which
connects the lower or seminal root with the upper or coronal
root, he believes to be then not so readily found by worms in
the winter, as one three inches long might be, both on account
of the greater length of the latter, and because insects do not
rise so near the surface in the winter months.</P>
<P>Where this pestilential grub occurs, perhaps rolling the land
early in the mornings in the spring might crush them. And
when the fly is seen to come out in such abundance in the sum∣mer
evenings on grass land or fallows, it is probable, that rol∣ling
the ground in the evening might prevent the return into
the earth both of these and of the May-chaffers to deposit their
<PB N="329" REF="335"/>
eggs, and thus prevent their future progeny; or during their
grub state, when they exist at the roots of wheat above or just
beneath the surface of the soil, perhaps slaked lime might be
sprinkled over the crop in powder, or sea-salt in powder, which
might be washed down the stems of the corn in a wet day, and
destroy the insect without injuring the vegetable; or lastly, by
tar-water; all which might be first tried on a small part of a
field; for as lime is not all of equal purity, it is not all of the
same strength or causticity.</P>
<P>Another insect is said to injure wheat when in flower, and is
supposed to be the thrips physapus of Linneus, as mentioned in
the Transactions of the Linnean Society, Vol. III. But as it
only attacks the late flowering stems, it may possibly be prevent∣ed
by sowing the wheat early, if it should ever become a serious
evil.</P>
<P>Some time ago an insect called a corn-butterfly committed
great ravages in France while in its vermicular state, so as to
ruin two hundred parishes. A cure for it was at length disco∣vered,
which consisted in drying the wheat in an oven before
sowing it, and thus exposing it to such a degree of heat as
would destroy the eggs of the insect without injuring the seed;
or perhaps which hatched them without sufficient moisture to
soften the grain for their support. See Encycl. Britan.
Agricult.</P>
<P>Between Chesterfield and Plaisly in Derbyshire I well remem∣ber
above forty years ago to have seen for two or three miles
together every leaf of the hedges devoured by the May-chaffers,
scarabaeus melolontha, which hung on each other, where the
foliage was destroyed, like bees in a swarm. And to have
found in the same year, as it lay dead in a field near Chester∣field,
a true locust, like a very large grass-hopper with very
long and broad wings; which I preserved in spirits, and was
informed that many of them were found in other parts of Eng∣land
about the same time.</P>
<P>All these noxious animals might be destroyed or diminished
by encouraging the breed of small hedge-birds, and perhaps of
larks, and of rooks, by not taking their nests. I have observ∣ed,
that house sparrows destroy the May-chaffer, eating out the
<PB N="330" REF="336"/>
central part of it; and am told that turkeys and rooks do the
same; which I thence conclude might be as grateful food, if
properly cooked, as the locusts or termites of the east. And
probably the large grub, or larva of it, which the rooks pick
up in following the plow, is as delicious as the grub called
groogroo, and a large caterpillar, which feeds on the palm;
both of which are roasted and eaten in the West Indies. The
various species of linnets carry small caterpillars to their gaping
young; and hedgehogs are said to devour snails, and on that
account to be profitably kept in gardens.</P>
<P>When a severe frost occurs, before the ground is covered
with snow, those insects, which do not penetrate deeply into
the earth during their hybernation, as the shell-less snails or
slugs, are liable to be destroyed, and probably many of the
larvae of the fern-chaffer and May-chaffer, as is seen by their
diminished numbers in the ensuing season.</P>
<P>In China the aurelia of the silk-worm, after the silk is wound
off, and the white earth-grub, and the larva of the sphinx moth,
furnish articles at the table, and are said to be delicious. Em∣bassy
to China. Nevertheless all the caterpillar tribes may not
be equally innocuous; as in this climate the hairy caterpillars, if
laid between the fingers, where the skin is tender, I have ob∣served
to produce an itching and leave some of their pointed
bristles in the skin. And Mr. Vaillant, in his travels in Africa
from the Cape, asserts, that both a black and a white hairy ca∣terpillar
becomes so poisonous, when it feeds on a large eup∣horbia,
that the natives put them in bags, bruise them, and after
a few days poison their arrows with them. But that they are
less poisonous if they feed on less acrid vegetables.</P>
<P>There must be great difficulty in destroying the larvae, or
grubs, or caterpillars, of many insects, which are injurious to
the fruits and kernels, as well as to the foliage of plants, by
any chemical mixtures; as in this state, I suppose, some of
them are uncommonly hardy or tenacious of life. Mr. Gouch
affirms, that he kept the curculio nucum, or worm found in nuts, in
brandy for seventeen hours, which recovered; and I
remember putting a worm, which came from a person, who
called it an ascaris, though it was above an inch long, and
<PB N="331" REF="337"/>
nearly as thick as a thin crow-quill, into a saturated solution of
sugar of lead in water; which lived many hours without appa∣rent
injury. See Nicholson's Journal, No. 21, for November
179<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>7. A great number of bees, as well as of moths, and butter∣flies,
must be very injurious to flowers, and consequently to the
pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duction of fruits, as all of them plunder the nectaries of their
honey, and thence deprive the anthers and stigmas of their
adapted nourishment, as mentioned in Sect. VI. 6. 3. This
would be more destructive to the seminal products of plants,
but many of them possess means of defending their reservoirs
of honey, and yet of exposing it to the influence of the air,
some of them by long winding canals, as in the bottom of the
tubes of the honey-suckles, trefoils, and lark-spurs, lonicera,
trifolium, delphinium; others by covering it with a hood, as
in monkshood, aconitum; others by a gluten, as in catchfly,
silene, and in fun-dew, drosera; others by contracting some part
of their leaves or flowers, and destroying the hostile insect, as
in dionoea muscipula, and in apocynum androsemifolium; and
finally, many other flowers have probably acquired the habit of
secreting more honey than is necessary for their own consump∣tion,
as cacalia suaveolens, alpine colts-foot, and polygonum
fagopyrum, buck-wheat. From all these contrivances the flowers
of plants probably receive less injury from the depredations of
bees, moths and butterflies, in this country, and from the hum∣ming
bird in tropical climates, than they otherwise would be
subject to.</P>
<P>But besides the loss of much of their honey an abundance of
bees must likewise injure the seminal products of vegetables by
plundering the stamina of flowers of their anther-dust for bee-bread,
as Mr. Hunter believes; and also of the wax which co∣vers
the anthers for their defence against rain. Nevertheless, as
mankind convert to their own purposes the honey thus collected
by bees, and the wax, with which they fabricate their combs;
and as the seeds of plants and their fruits are nevertheless in
sufficient abundance; the depredations of bees are not counteract∣ed
like those of other insects, but on the contrary encouraged.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="338"/>
The following observations, which I made this summer, may
be of service to those who keep bees, and which I shall therefore
here relate. The bees of one society frequently attack those of
another society, plunder them of their honey, and destroy most
of them, perhaps all of them, in battle; in this respect resemb∣ing
the societies of mankind! This war for plunder occurs more
frequently than is commonly suspected. Last year I had one
hive of bees totally destroyed, and the year before another,
which I did not take means to prevent, though I saw the con∣test,
and the number destroyed in the latter; but not early
enough in the commencement of hostilities.</P>
<P>Last week, June 16, I happened to see a great number of
bees on the wing near the mouth of my only hive, and supposed
that they were about to swarm. In an hour or two, on again
attending to them, I distinctly saw it was a violent battle; and
at night observed about a hundred dead bees on the ground,
and on the bench before the hive. I then directed a board
about an inch thick to be laid on the bee-bench, and set the hive
on this board with its mouth exactly on the edge of this board,
the mouth of the hive was also contracted to about an inch in
length, and a semicircular hollow was made in the board imme∣diately
under the mouth of the hive. By this means the assail∣ing
bees were obliged to alight on the bee-bench, and then to
climb perpendicularly up the edge of the board, on which the
hive was now placed; and thus appeared to act with great dis∣advantage;
and a much less number of bees appeared to be
slain in this day's battle; whence it would be advantageous
always to place bee-hives in this manner.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, as the war did not cease, I directed early on
the next morning to remove the bee hive to a distant part of the
garden, and to a more easterly aspect, and found to my great
satisfaction, that the hosts of the enemy did not follow; and
that in a few hours the unassailed bees resumed their work, as
appeared by their going into the hive with loaded thighs; and
though a few of them were seen on the following two nights
resting on their old habitation, these were carried early on the
ensuing morning in their torpid state to their new situation, and
the war ended without extermination of either society.</P>

<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
<HEAD>IV. DESTRUCTION BY VERMIN.</HEAD>
<P>1. The destruction of grain, after it is sown, by the field∣mice,
which mine their way very quickly under newly ploughed
lands near the surface, is said by Mr. Wagstaff, in the papers
of the Bath Society, Vol. VI. to be effected in some seasons to
a very great extent. He adds, that the tussocks of wheat, seen
to arise in many fields, are owing to the granaries of these dimi∣nutive
animals; which he has often found to contain nearly an
hatful of corn, which grows into a tuft, if the owner becomes
accidentally destroyed.</P>
<P>Mr. Wagstaff also asserts, that they feed much on the young
plants, as they arise from the seed, and multiply at that time very
fast. He detects their habitations by small mounds of earth
being thrown up on or near the apertures of their dwellings, or
of the passages, which lead to their nests or granaries; and by
following the course of these passages he found and destroyed
the parents and the progeny.</P>
<P>Mr. Wagstaff recommends the taking up and dividing the
tussocks of wheat, thus sown in the autumn by the field-mice,
and transplanting them in the spring; and also to thin other
parts of a young crop, as they appear too thickly sown, which
he esteems an advantageous practice.</P>
<P>Acorns when sown, and garden beans, and peas, are liable
to be dug up or devoured by these voracious little animals,
which may be destroyed by traps baited with cheese; or best of
all by the encouragement of the breed of owls, so active in the
pursuit of nocturnal vermin, and thence so useful to the gardener
and farmer, who still permit their servants and children to de∣stroy
both their eggs and callow young.</P>
<P>2. This country was infested with two kinds of rats, the
house-rat and the water-rat; but it is believed, that within the
last half century the water-rat has destroyed the house-rat. The
water-rats possess some kind of ingenuity similar to the beaver
in the construction of their houses near the brinks of rivers and
pools; which have two apertures, one above ground amongst
the grass, and the other beneath the surface of the water; and
<PB N="334" REF="340"/>
unless they can hide their upper opening amid weeds or grass,
they forsake the situation. Thus if a rim three or four feet in
breadth, round a fish-pound be kept so low as to rise only two,
or three, or four inches above the level of the water; and if
this be kept clean from high grass, or weeds, the rats will desert
the pond.</P>
<P>I have seen a young water-rat devour a large leaf of water-plantain,
alisma plantago, and therefore suppose that they occa∣sionally
prey on the foliage, as well as on the seeds and fruits
of vegetables, and on young animals, as ducklings and rabbits.
As these animals, like the dog, are of a lascivious nature, and
as some materials have a strong scent, resembling perhaps that
of their venereal orgasm, they are liable to be attracted by such
smells, as dogs are, on the same account, I suppose, inclined
to roll themselves on putrid carrion; and male cats to eat ma∣ram,
valerian, and cat-mint. On this account it is usual for
rat-catchers to avail themselves of this propensity, and to mix
essential oil of rhodium, or musk, with the poisonous powders
of strychnos nux vomica, or of delphinium stavisagria, or per∣haps
of arsenic.</P>
<P>The great injury to vegetation effected by these rats consists
in their making innumerable burrows beneath the soil, and feed∣ing
on the roots of a great variety of vegetables. Some new
planted apple-trees I remember to have seen taken out of the
ground with nearly the whole of their smaller roots eaten, and
the larger ones peeled by these reptiles. They will also destroy
young ducks, young rabbits, and young chickens; and devour
with great avidity every kind of food, with which poultry and
swine are usually fed; and are hence in many ways injurious in
situations near water.</P>
<P>The subsequent receipts for poisoning this mischievous ver∣min
are printed in the papers of the Bath Agricultural Society,
and said to have been attended with great success. First, to a
quart of oatmeal add six drops of oil of rhodium, one grain of
musk, and two or three of the nuts of nux vomica finely pow∣dered;
make it into pellets, and put them into the rat-holes.
This was at first greedily eaten, and did great execution, but
the wise animals after a time ceased to eat it. The second con∣sisted
<PB N="335" REF="341"/>
of three parts of oatmeal, and one of stavisagria, stave's-acre,
mixed well into a paste with honey. Pieces of this paste
were laid in their holes, and again did great execution. A
third method of destroying them there recommended is by lay∣ing
a large box down on its front side with the lid supported
open by a string over a pully; and by trailing toasted cheese,
and a red herring, from their holes to this box; and placing
oatmeal and other food in this box, which they are for a few
nights permitted to eat unmolested; and finally to watch them
by moonlight, the inside of the box being painted white;
and, when many of them are seen, to let down the lid; by
which contrivance sixty of them were taken at once.</P>
<P>3. Moles, as well as rats, have occasionally increased so
greatly in numbers, as to much injure the agricultor; they per∣forate
the earth near its surface, and are said never to drink,
but to seed on the roots of vegetable, as well as on subterraneous
insects; and though they are believed never to drink, yet they
have been seen occasionally to swim over lakes of water to the
islands which they surround, of which an ocular proof is relat∣ed
in the transactions of the Linnean Society, Vol. III. 1797.
Some have recommended to inject the smoke of burning sulphur,
or of tobacco, into their subterraneous mansions; but as the
earth frequently falls in behind them, as they pass, or is accu∣mulated
behind them by their hindermost feet, as they perforate
the soil with their foremost feet or hands, this method of attack
can seldom succeed, unless the nest of the animal be near the
fumigated aperture. Others have advised to pour water into
their holes, which is equally inefficacious in general, though it
may have effect in particular situations. Some also have baited
traps with worms, and others have advised to put poison into
their holes; but they are not to be attracted together like rats
from their not appearing above ground.</P>
<P>The following method was related to me by Francis Paget
of Elston near Newark, a very popular and successful mole∣catcher,
whom I once attended in his occupation to witness his
operations. The moles have cities under ground, which consist
of houses, or nests, where they breed and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urse their young;
communicating with these are wider and more frequented streets,
<PB N="336" REF="342"/>
made by the perpetual journeys of the male and female parents;
as well as many other less frequented allies or bye roads, with
many diverging branches, which they daily extend to collect
food for themselves or their progeny.</P>
<P>This animal is more active in the vernal months, during the
time of the courtship of the males; and many more burrows are
at this time made in the earth for their meeting with each other.
And though these animals are commonly esteemed to be blind,
yet they appear to have some perception of light even in their
subterraneous habitations; because they begin their work as
soon as it is light, and consequently before the warmth of the
sun can be supposed to affect them. Hence his method of de∣stroying
them consisted first in attending their situation early
before sun-rise; and at that time he frequently could see the
earth move over them, or the grass upon it; and by a small
light spade he frequently cut off their retreat, by striking it into
the ground behind them, and then dug them up. He added,
that by laying the ear on a newly raised mole-hill, the sound
of the scratching mole might sometimes be heard at a distance,
and direct where to find it; as the solid earth conveys small
vibrations better, or to a greater distance, than the light air.
And that a terrier dog, after having been accustomed to the
business, was frequently of service in detecting by his nose the
place of the mole beneath the soil, and by endeavouring to
scratch the earth over it.</P>
<P>The mole he said generally suckles four or five, and some∣times
six, young ones; which are placed considerably deeper
in the ground than their common runs; and as these nests are
sunk much deeper into the ground than their streets or bye-roads,
and the mole-hills consequently larger, the earth on the summit
of those mole-hills is generally of a different colour, and is raised
higher than that of the other ones. These nests are to be dug
up, having first intercepted the canal between them and the
mole-hills in their vicinity, to cut off the retreat of the inha∣bitants.</P>
<P>The next important circumstance is to discover, which
are the frequented streets, and which the bye-roads, for the
purpose of setting subterraneous traps. This is effected by mak∣ing
<PB N="337" REF="343"/>
a mark on every new mole-hill by a light pressure of your
foot; and on the next morning by observing whether a mole has
again passed that way, and obliterated the foot mark; and this
is to be done two or three successive mornings. These foot∣marks
should not be deeply impressed, lest it should alarm the
animal on his return, and he should form a new branch of road,
rather than open the obstructed one.</P>
<P>The traps are then to be set in the frequented streets, so as
nicely to fit the divided canal. They consist of a hollow semicy∣linder
of wood with grooved rings at each end of it, in which
are placed two nooses of horsehair, one at each end, fastened
loosely by a peg in the center, and stretched above ground by a
bent stick. When the mole has passed half way through one of
the nooses, and removes the central peg in his progression, the
bent stick rises by its elasticity, and strangulates the animal.
He added, that where the soil was too moist or tenacious, that
the moles in passing the old ruins sometimes pushed a little of it
before them, and thus loosened the central peg before they
were in the noose; in which case he fixed the peg a little faster
in the trap.</P>
<P>By these means Francis Paget cleared many of the neighbour∣ing
parishes of this kind of vermin in a few days, or a week or
two, and laid them under an annual tax for the defence of their
territories from these invaders. And added, that some other mole∣catchers
had carried moles into those farms, whose occu∣piers
refused to pay them an annual stipend, a practice which he
scorned to use. I have detailed this method to prevent this
imposition, and to enable every farmer to be his own mole-catcher,
or to teach the art to his servants.</P>

<P>THE objects of the culture of the farm or garden may be di∣vided
into the production of fruits, seeds, roots, barks, woods,
leaves, and flowers.</P>
<P>We have repeatedly endeavoured to shew, that the buds im∣mediately
arising from seeds are not themselves capable of pro∣ducing
seads neither in herbaceous nor in arborescent vegetables;
but that the first bud from every seed is succeeded by a second
bud more perfect than itself; and that by a third, fourth, or
many more; each generation being more perfect than the pre∣ceding
one, till they acquire a puberty, if it may be so called▪
or a power of producing sexual organs, and a consequent semi∣nal
progeny.</P>
<P>In those plants, which are called annuals, because their seeds
are sown, and produce other seeds, in the same year, and then
perish, some successive buds grow on each other, before a flower
can be produced; as is seen in the stems of wheat, and sowthis∣tle,
triticum, souchus; which consist of joints, which appear
to be successive buds growing on each other.</P>
<P>From the tulip seed a single bud arises the first year with a
circular flat caudex existing beneath it, on which one principal
new bulb is formed annually more perfect than its parent, as is
seen by the larger leaf; and also some less bulbs are produced
<PB N="342" REF="347"/>
around the more perfect one in the bosom of each rudiment of a
leaf, which composes or encloses the principal bulb, as described
in Sect. VII. 1. 3. and Sect. IX. 3. 1. and 3. 6. These less
perfect bulbs round the principal one, after the principal one has
acquired its puberty, or power of producing sexual organs, are of
greater or less degree of maturity, as appears by their size; and
thence I suppose must require more or fewer years, before they
flower.</P>
<P>Similar to this circumstance of the tulip-root, the buds of
trees, which first arise from the seed, produce annually other
buds more perfect than themselves, till they acquire the power
of seminal generation; and afterwards not only a flower-bud is
formed, which is in some trees the central bud on the extremity
of the twig, as in pear-trees, and on the spurs of apple-tree; but
also many leaf-buds of greater or less maturity are formed around
the principal, or flower-bud; which require more or fewer
years, before they obtain the maturity necessary to produce a
flower.</P>
<P>It was shewn in Sect VII. 1. 7. that every part of the long
caudex, extending from a bud on the summit of a tree to the
root, can produce a bud, like every part of the broad caudex
of a tulip-root; but those produced in the bosom of the leaf I
believe generally to be the most mature; and those which arise
from a lower part of the caudex to be less mature, and will in
consequence require more successive buds to proceed from them,
before they can form a flower. Thus when the whole branches
of a fruit-tree are lopped from the trunk, the new buds are pro∣duced
from the lower parts of the caudexes of the branch-buds,
which have been lopped off, and are therefore an immature pro∣geny,
and require some years before they can flower.</P>
<P>It hence appears, that a number of buds or bulbs in all vege∣tables
must succeed each other from the seed, before a flower
and consequent fruit can be generated; but that these successive
generations are more numerous or fewer in some plants than in
others; that they in some plants may only succeed each other
annually; in others perhaps many of them in the same summer,
as in the herbaceous plants, as wheat: and in those trees, whose
annual joints have their pith divided from each other, as in vines.
<PB N="343" REF="348"/>
And lastly, that the number of these successive generations, or
the times of their production, whether only annually, or many
of them in one summer, may be diminished or accelerated, by
art; and that in attending to all these circumstances consists the
successful management of fruit-trees.</P>
<P>The new buds on deciduous trees in this climate are produced
about Midsummer, as observed in Sect. IX. 2. 9; and it is believ∣ed
by the Linnean school, that many of them at this time may be
so affected by art, as to become either leaf-buds or flower-buds.
At this season therefore the production of buds on wall-trees,
or espaliers, or on standards, should employ the attention of
the horticultor; as those seedling-trees produce leaf-buds only,
which are too young to produce flower-buds; and as the par∣ticular
shoots or buds of other trees are not so mature as to pro∣duce
flower-buds; and lastly, as some trees flourish too vigo∣rously,
as it is termed, to produce flower-buds. The things to
be attended to are the age of the tree, from which the graft
was taken, which now forms a branch; the maturity of the
particular buds, which you wish to encourage; and the vigour
of the whole tree, or its tendency to produce leaf-buds in pre∣ference
to flower-buds.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>I. TO PRODUCE FRUIT-BEARING TREES.</HEAD>
<P>1. There are four methods of procuring fruit-trees for the
purposes of horticulture, by seeds, by root-suckers, by planted
scions, or by ingrafted scions.</P>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>1. Of Seedling trees.</HEAD>
<P>It was observed above in Section IX. 3. 1. and 3. 6. that in
tulips and hyacinths, and even in potatoes and onions, the bulbs
succeed each other for two or three years or longer, before they
produce flowers; and that the same happens to the buds of seed∣ling-trees,
which are many years a succession of leaf-buds only,
before the propagation of a single flower-bud; for the power,
which produces the lateral germination of buds, seems to require
a lese mature organization than that, which is employed in the
<PB N="344" REF="349"/>
sexual generation of seeds; whence a kind of puberty of the
plant seems to be acquired for the production of the seminal or
amatorial progeny, analogous to the transformation of caterpillars
into butterflies; which appears to be effected solely for the pur∣pose
of propagation.</P>
<P>M. Speechly, in his treatise on the culture of the Vine, p. 49,
seems to say, that seedling vines must be three or four years
old, before they produce fruit; whereas a planted scion, or an
ingrafted one, from an aged tree, will produce fruit the first
or second year; and according to the observations of Mr.
Knight, seedling apple-trees will not bear fruit till they are
twelve or fourteen years old; and other fruit trees in similar
manner require some years after their birth from the seed, before
they arrive at sufficient maturity to bear flowers. See Sect. VII.
1. 3. Hence he advises the horticultor to procure scions for
grafting from such trees as already bear fruit; but pays no regard
to the stock, into which they are to be inserted; and adds, that
he believes, if scions from a bearing walnut or mulberry tree
were ingrafted on a seedling one, that it would produce fruit in
two or three years; which otherwise would not occur in less
than twenty. Treatise on Apple and Pear. Longman, London.
And hence we see the advantage of ingrafting on seedling orange
or lemon-trees in our green-houses the scions taken from those,
which bear fruit; as otherwise they would continue so many
years before the buds would acquire sufficient maturity to gene∣rate
flowers.</P>
<P>Some have believed that young trees will bear fruit sooner, if
they are not pruned, but permitted to grow quite wild in large
bushes. It is possible, that this may occur either from the un∣skilful
horticultor pruning off all die terminal twigs, whose buds
were forwarder in respect to age, than the lateral ones much
beneath them. Or because the great number of new leaf-buds,
proceeding from an exuberant branching head, may so crowd
the bark of the trunk with their caudexes, that some of them
may sooner find a difficulty in forming their embryon caudexes,
and may in consequence become flower-buds. But I much
doubt, that this can frequently occur from either cause, as I
think, I have seen espaliers bear some years sooner than stan∣dards,
<PB N="345" REF="350"/>
which were ingrafted at the same time, and from the
same trees. And I have been informed of other seedling apple-trees,
which have borne fruit in not much more than half the
time above mentioned by Mr. Knight.</P>
<P>It is much to be wished, that proper experiments were made
on seedling trees, by planting them as espaliers, or against walls,
and bending down their branches below the horizon, since the
difficulty of their generating leaf-buds might be thus increased;
as they could not so easily form their embryon caudexes on the
compressed bark of the bended branch; and the sap-juice for
the nourishment of fruit-buds would be thus rather increased than
diminished, according to an experiment of Dr. Walker, who
found the buds at the extremities of bended branches to swell
sooner in the season, and to become larger, than those of an
equal height on the more upright branches. Edinburgh Tran∣sactions,
Vol. I.</P>
<P>Mr. Bradley has mentioned an apple, which was sweet and
boiled soft on one side, and four and boiled hard on the other;
and ascribed it probably to the real cause with much ingenuity
in the year 1721, long before the publication of the system of
Linneus. He ascribes it to the male farina of some neighbour∣ing
harsh apple-tree affecting at the time of the impregnation
the stigma of the flower of a sweet one; and thus a production
of different seeds might be generated in the same pericarp, and
a consequent different kind of nutriment prepared for each;
and thus the different parts of the apple become four or sweet,
which is analogous to a bitch producing different kinds of puppies
at the same birth, resembling the different dogs with which she
had cohabited. The same circumstance is said to have occurred
in oranges and in grapes of different kinds.</P>
<P>By this method of applying the farina of one good variety of
fruit, as of apple or pear, to the stigma of another good variety,
it is very probable, that some very excellent new varieties of
fruit might be produced from the seeds, which might supply for
a century the orchards of the curious, instead of our golden
pippins, and nonpareils; which are said to be superannuated,
and so liable to canker as not to be worth cultivation. It is
probable also, that new varieties of tulips and hyacinths, and of
<PB N="346" REF="351"/>
melons and cucumbers, as well as of all other vegetables, might
be thus produced.</P>
<P>The following observations are from Mr. Knight's treatise on
Apple and pear, p. 47. “Every seed, though taken from the
same apple,” furnishes a new and distinct variety; and some of
these will grow with more luxuriance than others; and the
fruits produced by the different plants will possess different de∣grees
of merit; but an estimate may be made of their good and
bad qualities, at the conclusion of the first summer by the resem∣blance
the leaves bear to the highly cultivated, or to the wild
kinds; as has been remarked by the writers on this subject of
the last century. The plants, whose buds in the annual wood
are full and prominent, are usually more productive than those
whose buds are small and shrunk into the bark; but their future
produce will depend much on the power the blossoms possess
of bearing cold; and this power varies in the different varieties,
and can only be known from experience. Those, which pro∣duce
their leaves and blossoms rather early in the spring, are
generally to be preferred; for though they are more exposed to
injury from frost, they less frequently suffer from the attacks of
insects, the more common cause of failure.</P>
<P>“The leaves of young seedling plants annually change,” be∣come
more thick and fleshy, and assume more the character of
the cultivated kinds. These external changes indicate some
internal ones in the constitution of the plant, which may possibly
be similar in their nature to those, which take place in animals
between their infancy and the time, when they become capable
of propagating their species.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>2. Of Root-scions.</HEAD>
<P>Root-suckers from bearing bur-apples, or from bearing cod∣lings,
are believed to become fruitful as soon as grafts from those
trees; because they are a viviparous offspring, as well as the
scions or twigs from the branches; and are therefore not similar
to the oviparous progeny, or the young trees produced from seeds.
This must nevertheless in great measure depend upon the age of
the sucker; as those root-buds, which, rise into suckers, are not
<PB N="347" REF="352"/>
formed or generated in the bosom of a leaf, but from a part of
one of the long caudexes of a branch-bud; and will therefore, I
suppose, require a succession of buds for some years, before they
will acquire a sufficient maturity to produce a flower; as the cen∣tral
buds from the bosom of a leaf I suppose to be much forwarder
than the lateral buds from the same caudex; as is seen in the cen∣tral
or flower-bulb of a tulip, and its immature lateral bulbs from
the same caudex.</P>
<P>Root-suckers from those trees, which have been ingrafted on
the roots of other trees, as the robinia on the acacia, may arise
above the grafted part, which is beneath the soil; but those root-suckers,
which arise from trees, which were grafted above ground,
are similar to the stock, not to the fruit-bearing head; which
might have been a wild pear or wild apple; and will in that case
produce crab-pears, or crab-apples, with thorny stems.</P>
<P>When a branch of a vine, or briar, or of many other trees,
is bent down, and a part of it inserted into the ground with its
summit in the air, it will emit roots at the joints, and become a
new tree. So the rough knobs on the bark of a bur-apple-tree,
I am informed, will shoot out roots, if surrounded with moist
earth; and the branch may be then cut off, and successfully plant∣ed.
And from almost every joint of a fig-tree roots will pro∣trude,
if surrounded even with a woollen shred, which happens
to be frequently moistened by the dews or rain; and the branch
may be successfully bent down and planted in a garden-pot.
All these, like suckers from the roots of seedling-trees, or like
grafted scions, will become fertile, as soon as the tree, from
which they are the offspring; whether it be a seedling-tree or not.</P>
<P>This circumstance does not occur exactly similar in the inserti∣on
of buds from one tree into the bark of another; as those buds,
which do not arise from the bosom of a leaf, but from lower parts
of the caudexes of a branch-bud, as from the bark of a branch,
whose summit has been cut off, are less mature, I believe, than the
summit-buds, or those which arise from the bosom of a leaf; and
will therefore require some years before they can produce flowers;
as is seen in those apple or pear trees, whose summits have been
entirely lopped off. This is a new observation, I believe, and
worth the attention of those, who inoculate the buds of one
fruit tree into another.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="353"/>
Root-suckers may probably be liable to degenerate in respect
to their vigorous growth by hereditary diseases, owing to the too
great age of the original plant of that variety, like the ingrafted
scions from the branches. Whence it may be necessary to pro∣cure
root-suckers of raspberry-plants, and of gooseberries, and
even of artichokes, and strawberries, from such as have been
raised from seed not too long ago, when any of these begin to
degenerate.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>3. Of Planted Scions.</HEAD>
<P>The scions taken from the branches of many trees, if planted
in the earth, will emit roots, and flourish in the same manner,
as when they are grafted on other trees. This succeeds with
great certainty, if an inverted glass be put over them for a few
days to prevent their perspiring more at first, than their absorbent
vessels can supply. See Sect. I. 1. I have been informed, that
a quickset, or hawthorn hedge, crataegus, was thus planted and
became a good fence considerably sooner than from sowing the
seed.</P>
<P>The Chinese are said by sir G. Staunton to be unacquainted
with the art of ingrafting, and to produce dwarf fruit-trees,
which are brought to table loaded with fruit at their festi∣vals,
by surrounding a branch of a bearing fruit-tree at its bifur∣cation
with a bag of earth, which is kept moist for some months;
till the branch puts out roots, probably from the lips of a wound
in the bark, and is at length separated, and transplanted into a
pot. Embassy to China, Vol. II. p. 54. 8vo. edition; and it is
then rendered a dwarf by repeatedly cutting out the central buds,
as in the management of melons, as mentioned in No. 2. 5. and
3. 2. of this Section.</P>
<P>Vines possess so vigorous a power of vegetation, that the pre∣sent
most approved method of propagating them in grape-houses
consists in planting their scions. The late Rev. John Michel
of Thornhill, in Yorkshire, the philosopher, who discovered to
the world the art of making artificial magnets, which had been
concealed by Mr. Knight; whose friendship I long possessed, and
whose loss I have long lamented; amused himself and family
<PB N="349" REF="354"/>
at vacant hours in his hot-house. The observations of a man of
such accurate and universal knowledge are always worth record∣ing;
and though his ideas on this subject have already appeared
in Mr. Speechly's Culture of the Vine, I shall here transcribe a
part of one of his letters to me dated in May 1785.</P>
<P>“The way in which we raise our vines we account our own;”
for I don't know, that it was practised by any body before we
set the example. It is now pretty generally adopted however
by the gardeners and nurserymen in this part of the world.
Instead of leaving three or four eyes on the cuttings, as used
formerly to be done, which made them awkward straggling
things, we never plant more than a single eye to each, cutting
them with as long a part below the eye as they can admit,
without encroaching too much upon the next eye below; that
is to say, we leave perhaps about half an inch, or a little more,
as it may happen, above it. These cuttings we plant by half a
dozen or a dozen together, at the distance of three, four, or
five inches, in the bark-bed, where it is pretty warm, but not
so hot as to endanger the burning of the roots, when they shall
come out; and where it is also pretty moist, or else we water
them. We plant them sloping so as to make an angle of about
thirty degrees perhaps, a little more or less, with the horizon,
the eye being highest; but taking care that it also shall be
covered about an inch with the bark, which is a very neces∣sary
precaution; for though it ought just to <HI>smell</HI> the fresh air,
it must be kept moist, to prevent the bud and shoot, when it
comes, from drying; otherwise it will very frequently die away
presently after it has shot a little, or at best it will grow unkind∣ly,
not having yet made roots sufficient to supply it with the sap
necessary for its support; which will not be the case, if the bud
is sufficiently covered at first, and till it has acquired more
roots.</P>
<P>“We generally plant our vines in this way,” about the begin∣ning
or middle of January; and if the bark is pretty warm,
and as moist as it should be, the cuttings will begin
to push both at top and bottom in about a fortnight or three weeks at the
most. When the vines have shot a little, perhaps three or four
inches, but before the roots are got too long, (in which case it
<PB N="350" REF="355"/>
would be impossible to avoid breaking them by removing, on ac∣count
of their extreme tenderness and brittleness) we displace a
good deal of the bark very near them, till we can throw them
down all together, which shakes the bark very gently from their
roots; so that one may disengage them sufficiently easy, and
without much hurting them. We then plant three or four of
the most promising and thriving ones out of the whole number
singly in small pots in earth, which has previously stood in the
hot-house a day or two to get warm, letting the roots drop down
on a little earth at the bottom, at first, as they conveniently
can, and then covering them with more earth carefully, till the
pot is properly filled, and the stem about three or four inches
long, as I said before, standing in the middle; and then plenti∣fully
watering the earth to settle it to the roots. We now
plunge them again in the bark, where in five or six weeks, more
or less, they will have filled their pots pretty well with roots;
when they will begin to shew by their little progress, and the
smallness of the shoots, that they want more room. We then
take them carefully out of these small pots, disturbing the ball
of earth as little as possible, and put it all together into larger
pots, putting a little fresh earth at bottom and round about, and
watering well as before; and we then again plunge them into
the bark.</P>
<P>“By about the latter end of May, or beginning of June,
the best of them will be four or five, or perhaps six feet high,
and ought now to be removed, disturbing the roots as little as
possible, into the natural ground, where they are to remain. If
this is done carefully, and the earth well watered about them
to settle it to their roots, they will frequently begin growing
again almost immediately, but at least in three or four days;
and will then often shoot in the hot-house two inches in a day,
and by the end of the year will have shot from eighteen or
nineteen, to three, four, or five and twenty feet. Though we
approve of this as rather the best, yet if these cuttings are plant∣ed
in the same way either singly in small pots, or two or three
together in each, with earth, instead of planting them in the
bark, destroying all but the best one, when they have shot a
little, and plunging them either in the bark, or in default of a

<HEAD>4. Of Ingrafted Scions.</HEAD>
<P>The art of ingrafting trees is of great antiquity, and is at∣tended
with numerous well known advantages, but is not yet
arrived to its utmost perfection; for it is not yet certainly
known, whether the ingrafted scion gives or takes any property
to or from the tree, which receives it, except that it acquires
nourishment from it.</P>
<P>There is one instance recorded by Bradley, where the scion
of a variegated jassamine gave variegation to the leaves beneath
it of the unvariegated jassamine, on which it was ingrafted,
though the graft itself perished. See Sect. V. 1. This seems
to shew that a communication of juices exists between the graft
and the stock; and that thus some change in the colour of the
leaves of the stock might be occasioned by the inosculation of
the vessels of the new bud with those of other buds in its vici∣nity.
Thus if a scion of a purple grape was ingrafted on a
white one, the leaves of the latter might probably become some∣what
red in the autumn, like those of the purple-vine; but
there are no instances recorded, where this communication of
juices from the graft to the stock, or from the stock to the graft,
has varied the flavour or the form of the flowers, or fruit of
either of them.</P>
<P>For though the same vegetable blood passes along both the
upper and lower part of the caudex of the new scion, which
extends from its summit on the branch to its base in the earth;
yet the molecules secreted from this blood are selected or form∣ed
by the different glands of the part of the caudex, which
was brought with the ingrafted scion, and of the part of it
which remained on the stock, in the same manner as different
kinds of secretions are produced from the same blood in ani∣mal
bodies.</P>
<P>Some have nevertheless believed, that scions, ingrafted on
more vigorous trees of the same genus, have acquired greater
<PB N="352" REF="357"/>
vigour in the growth both of their leaf-buds and fruit-buds.
Mr Speechly asserts, that he has improved many kinds of vines
by ingrafting those, which bear small grapes, and which have
generally weak wood, on stronger ones, which he has often ex∣perienced;
and recommends the Syrian vine to graft upon, and
prefers those, which were raised from seed for this purpose; and
the contrary seems to appear, where more vigorous scions have
been ingrafted on less vigorous stocks; as apple-scions on crab∣stocks;
where in a few years the part above the grafted joint
becomes much larger in diameter than that below it.</P>
<P>Grafted scions succeed well in general on trees of the same
genus, as in the common ingraftment of fruit-trees; so the
laurel, prunus lauro-cerasus, will grow on the common cherry,
prunus cerasus, and produce a tall evergreen tree. But there
are said to be instances also of success in the ingraftment of
trees not only of different genera, but even of different orders,
and classes; as I have been informed, that apple-scions, pyrus
malus, have grown, when ingrafted on hazels, corylus. And
one of the fathers of the Carthusian order is said to have suc∣ceeded
in grafting a vine, vitis, on a fig-tree, ficus; and a
jassamine on an orange. Travels in France and Italy, by E.
Wright. It is hence probable, that many new discoveries
might be made by more frequent experiments on this subject.</P>
<P>It nevertheless appears that in grafted trees, though the stock
annually becomes covered with a new bark, as well as the graft,
yet it does not change its nature; since any new buds, which
come out from the stock afterwards, are similar to the stock,
not to the graft; and in many trees the graft grows so much
faster as to become nearly of double the diameter of the stock,
as is frequently seen in old cherry-trees, and is spoken of in Sect.
VII. 1. 7.</P>
<P>Thus the buds of fruit-trees, like the bulbs of tulips, when
raised from seed, annually improve in their colour, length,
thickness, and often in the shape of their leaves, for a certain
number of years; and then acquire a male, or a female, organ
of reproduction, as in the classes of monoecia, an dioecia; or
both, as in hermaphrodite flowers. After this period the cen∣tral
buds and bulbs annually produced are in every respect simi∣lar
<PB N="353" REF="358"/>
to their parents, as mentioned in Sect VII. 1. 3. except in
the nearer progress to old age of the tree, or of the bulb-pro∣geny;
and the consequent tendency to hereditary diseases. But
the lateral buds from the lower parts of the caudex of the cen∣tral
ones, which are not generated in the bosoms of leaves, are
of a more immature kind, and in that respect do not resemble
the central bud, or bulb; but require some years before they
flower.</P>
<P>Mr. Knight has observed, that the grafts from those fruit-trees,
which have been in public estimation for a century or two, are
now so liable to canker, that they bear very little fruit, and are
not worth cultivation; which he ascribes to the age of the tree;
as a graft he says is simply an elongation of the parent tree.
And as it demands some years to acquire the puberty necessary
for sexual generation, so it may become weak and inirritable by
age, and perish about the same time with the orignal tree;
which is somewhat countenanced by another remark of Mr.
Knight, that the summits, or long extremities of old trees, fre∣quently
die many years before some smaller branches from the
trunk, which continue to flourish, as is frequently seen in old
oaks as well as in fruit-trees; and which he might suppose to
be occasioned by the greater age of the terminal buds than of
the lateral ones, as well as from the greater length of their ab∣sorbent
vessels, and the consequent greater resistance to the
ascent of the sap-juice, which may also be sooner impeded, or
totally stopped by the inirritability of old age.</P>
<P>Nevertheless as the buds of trees are successive progenies, and
cannot therefore be liable to old age, as they die annually▪ the
degeneracy of the buds of very old trees, or of those which
have long succeeded each other by their lateral, and not by
sexual generation, must arise from their being liable to heredi∣tary
diseases only, and not to heredttary improvements, as ob∣served
above in Sect. XIV. 1. 6.</P>
<P>That the degeneracy of some plants is owing to hereditary
diseases, and not to old age, appears from their continuing for
long uncounted periods of time after the production of these
diseases, as berberries without seeds, and vines without seeds, and
strawberries without fruit, though probably with seeds, as the
<PB N="354" REF="359"/>
barren ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tbois strawberries, which bear no fruit, so called,
have perfect stamina and pistilla, as I this day observed with a
good lens; to which may be added those female figs which
have no aperture to admit impregnation, and the monstrous
double flowers, which have lost the power of seminal propaga∣tion,
and some mule-plants, which never possessed it.</P>
<P>We have nothing in the animal system, except in the poly∣pus,
and a few obscure insects, similar to lateral generation;
and cannot therefore decidedly argue on this subject. Nor have
we any thing similar to ingraftment in animals, except that of
inflamed parts growing together, the transplantation of teeth,
and construction of artificial noses from the skin of the patient's
arm, seriously delivered by Talicotius, with many engraved
plates in a work on that subject. But this ingraftment of noses
was unfortunately burlesqued by the author of Hudibras; and
perhaps this ingenious idea of Mr. Knight, that the ingrafted
scion becomes diseased by age, and perishes about the same time
with the parent tree, may be liable to a similar ridicule by some
future writer on gardening.</P>

<P>There is an apple said to exist at New York in America,
which is asserted to be sour on one side of it, and sweet on the
other side; and to have been produced by slitting a scion of a
sour apple, and another similar one of a sweet apple, taking
care to cut the buds of each scion with a very sharp knife ex∣actly
in half, and by applying them and binding them nicely to∣gether,
and then ingrafting this double scion on a tree. I men∣tion
this, as it is related by Mr. Jay in the communications to
the Board of Agriculture, Vol. I. part 3 and 4, p. 362; and is
referred to in the Memoirs of the American Academy. Vol. I.
p. 386. But there must undoubtedly have been some mistake
<PB N="355" REF="360"/>
in respect to the production of such an apple by any method
of grafting, and which is so well explained as above by Mr.
Bradley.</P>
<P>It only remains here to add in respect to grafting, that it is
necessary to apply the bark, which contains or consists of the
caudex of the young scion, exactly to the bark of the branch,
into which it is inserted, or applied; and then all species of in∣grafting
succeeds, whether it is performed on a branch or on a
root; and whether by excision, or inoculation, or inarching.
But I suspect, that where a single bud is inoculated, it has
often failed from the unskilful operator having selected a flower-bud
instead of a leaf-bud; which probably unites its caudex to
those of the stock with less vigour, and certainly dies after it has
ripened its seed; or by his imprudently holding the bud in his
mouth, as he ascends the ladder, or while he makes the incision,
and thus destroying it by heat, as I once observed. A leaf-bud
may in general be distinguished from a flower-bud by its being
sharper pointed and less spherical.</P>
<P>Where the summits of very young scions of only a few weeks
old are to be used to ingraft with and upon, it may be necessary
also to apply the pith exactly to the pith; as this summit bud is
yet a primary being, and not like a lateral one, whose whole
caudex exists in the bark, which adheres to it, when it is taken
off for inoculation.</P>
<P>The choice of buds for the purpose of inoculation is probably
of more consequence than has hitherto been imagined. As we
have endeavoured to shew, that buds from parts of the bark
distant from the central bud, and which are not generated in
the bosom of a leaf, are in different states of maturity; they
must require more years before they can produce a sexual pro∣geny
of flowers, and a consequent seminal offspring, with the
reservoir of nutriment or fruit, which attends it. A subject
which is new, and merits to be further inquired into.</P>
<P>It is curious to observe, that when harsher fruits become
sweeter, that the blossom becomes whiter, as is universally seen
in those of our native crabs, and of our cultivated apples; and
that the buds become larger, and the green leaves also become
of larger area, and of paler complexion.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="361"/>
Thus Mr. Knight observes, “that the width and thickness of
the leaves generally indicate the size of the future apple; and
the colour of the black cherry and purple grape may be known
by their autumnal tints; and that even in plants, which have
sprung from seed in the preceding spring; as the tinging matter
in the leaves of these plants is probably of the same kind as that,
to which the fruits will in future owe their colour.” The
leaves of the purple grape become quite red in autumn, as well
as those of the geranium robertianum, and many other kinds of
foliage, which I suppose may be owing to their abundancy of
acid, which uniting with the blue part of what constitutes along
with the yellow part the green colour of vegetable leaves, con∣verts
it to red; as it changes the colour of blue flowers into red
ones.</P>

ingrafting may amuse the reader.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>II. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FRUIT-BUDS.</HEAD>
<P>The terms strength and weakness, in their usual acceptation,
when applied to the vegetation of trees, are metaphorical ex∣pressions,
or denote the effect or consequence, rather than the
cause, of their bearing leaf-buds or flower-buds, as spoken of in
Sect. IX. 2. 7. For the production of leaf-buds, or flower-buds,
though it may be said to accompany the greater or less
vigour of a tree, depends on the facility or difficulty, with
which the long caudexes of the new buds, which constitute the
filaments of the bark, can be generated.</P>
<P>Thus the new vegetable production formed in the axilla of a
leaf about Midsummer, which is called a leaf-bud, consists▪ of
many embryon buds, perhaps twenty or thirty, which are to
<PB N="357" REF="362"/>
form the next year's shoot; and each of these must be fur∣nished
at the same time with a long caudex in miniature, ex∣tending
from the leaf or summit to its radicle or base; which
consists of umbilical vessels for its vernal nutriment, and of a
continuation of other absorbent vessels, and of arteries and
veins, as described in Sect. VII. 1. 7. which passes along the
branches and trunk from the apex or leaf of the bud in the air
to its base or radicle in the ground; and which thus forms the
new bark, and contributes to thicken and strengthen the trunk
and branches of the tree; because each new leaf-bud with its
summit, caudex, and radicle, continues afterwards to adhere to
the parent tree.</P>
<P>But the production in the axilla of a leaf, which is called a
flower-bud, or fruit-bud, consists only of an individual vegeta∣ble
with the rudiments of a number of flowers, with one caudex
for its growth and nutriment; for as the seed falls from the
tree, when ripe, no new apparatus of caudexes in miniature
for each individual seed, as for each individual embryon-bud, is
required to pass down the trunk into the ground to form a new
bark; and thus to thicken and to strengthen the trunk and
branches.</P>
<P>Add to this, that not only the seeds require no new caudexes
to pass down the trunk, but that probably die stamina and coral
of each flower strike their roots only into the blood vessels,
which communicate with the bractes, like mosses or funguses,
which grow on trees, or like cuscuta, dodder, viscum, misletoe,
and tillandsia, and epidendrum; and therefore require no cau∣dexes
and radicles to pass down into the ground.</P>
<P>Whence it appears, that by rendering it more difficult for
new buds to acquire new caudexes along the branches or trunk
from the summit into the ground, the tree will be necessitated
to produce flower-buds in preference to leaf-buds; a theory;
which was first delivered in the Botanic Garden, Vol. I. canto
4. l. 470, note, and explains the whole art of the management
of fruit-trees.</P>
<P>Vegetables therefore in respect to their mode of propagation
are either viviparous or oviparous. The live progeny of vege∣tables
consists of the buds, which rise on their branches in the
<PB N="358" REF="363"/>
bosom of each leaf, or on its long caudex extending down the
bark of trees; or which arise on the bulbs, knobs, wires, or
scions, from the broad caudex on the roots of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbaceous
plants. The egg-progeny of vegetables consists in their seeds,
with the previous apparatus of the flower, and concomitant nu∣triment
in the fruit and cotyledons. And as plants, or parts of
plants are said to be in greater vigour, when the viviparous pro∣geny
is prevalent; as the caudexes of this adherent offspring
form a new bark, and thence thicken and strengthen the trunk
and branches; and to be in less vigour when the oviparous pro∣geny
is prevalent; as the seeds fall from the tree, and conse∣quently
require no caudexes to form a new bark, and thence to
thicken and strengthen the tree. We shall generally use the
word viviparous instead of vigorous, when applied to vegetables,
which generate leaf-buds principally; and oviparous instead of
weak, when applied to vegetables, which generate flower-buds
principally; for the words vigorous or weak may properly ex∣press
the greater or less health of vegetables in both these
situations.</P>
<P>The reader will please to observe, that in the Botanic Gar∣den
we have called the bark of trees an intertexture of the
roots of each individual bud: but that this is not accurate lan∣guage,
as the filaments, which constitute the bark, are each of
them the caudex of a b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, or central part of it; which has a
leaf at its upper extremity, and a radicle at its lower one. And
that each new caudex, or bark filament, is generated along the
whole trunk of the tree by the caudex or bark filament beneath
it; as appears in those fruit-trees where one, or two, or three
scions have been ingrafted on each other, as mentioned in Sect.
VII. 1. 7. for in these compound tree, when a bud arises from
any part of the trunk, it is seen to resemble that part of the
stock, and not to resemble the new grafted scion above it.
We finally suppose, that this whole long caudex of a new bud
is generally generated all at the same time by the sympathetic
action of the parts of the parent caudex along with the bud in
the bosom of the leaf of that parent caudex; and that it is not
gradually produced, as we first supposed, by the elongation of
the roots of each budlet in the bosom of the leaves.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="364"/>
The following methods will contribute to prevent the young
buds from so readily acquiring new caudexes on the trunk of
the tree; and will therefore retard the generation of leaf-buds,
and consequently assist the generation of fruit-buds; and should
be executed about Midsummer, or soon after, as at that time
the new buds are formed.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The first method consists in bending the viviparous branches
to the horizon, which converts them into oviparous ones,</HI> for by
the curvature of such branches the bark will be compressed on
the under side, and extended on the upper side of the curve,
and its vessels on both sides will be contracted in their diameters,
and thus the difficulty of producing new caudexes for the gene∣ration
of embryon leaf-buds will be increased▪ in whatever state
of miniature they may be conceived to exist.</P>
<P>A curious fact seems to be established by the experiments of
Dr. Walker in the first volume of the Edinburgh Transactions,
which shews, that the bending of a branch even below its in∣sertion
into the trunk does not impede the ascent, or derivation
of the vernal sap-juice into it; but on the contrary, that it ra∣ther
appears to assist it, resembling in some measure a capillary
syphon, as mentioned in Sect. III. 2. 4. which may be owing
to the vernal sap-juice ascending principally, or entirely, in the
sap-wood, as appears by the new leaves expanding to a certain
degree on decorticated oak-trees, as shewn in Sect. IX. 2. 8.
And as the vessels of this alburnum are more rigid, they may
be less liable to contraction or coarctation by bending down the
branch than the bark-vessels, as well as from their being placed
within the latter, and therefore less liable to compression beneath
the curvature, and to elongation above it.</P>
<P>Whence it appears, that the bending down a branch of a
fruit-tree below the horizon does not diminish the nutriment of
the fruit-buds, but rather increases it; as Dr. Walker observed
these buds to grow sooner and larger at the extremities of the
bended branches than on other parts of equal height.</P>
<P>It was asserted by Mr. Lawrence, that the more the branches
of any tree are carried horizontally, the more apt that tree is
to bear fruit; and that the more upright or perpendicular the
branches are led, the more disposed is that tree to increase in
<PB N="360" REF="365"/>
wood; which he ascribes to the bending down of the branches
impeding the circulation of the sap. Art of Gardening. Mr.
Hitt in his Treatise on Fruit Trees, affirms, that if a vigorous
branch of a wall-tree be bent down to the horizon or beneath
it, it loses its vigour, and becomes a bearing branch; and there∣fore
recommends his method of nailing the branches of wall-trees,
and of tying those of espaliers, in an horizontal direc∣tion
or still lower; as in this constrained situation there must
occur greater difficulty, I suppose, in the production of the
new caudexes, necessary for the embryon progeny of buds, up∣wards
or horizontally along the bended branch contrary to their
natural habits, as well as from the compression of the bark be∣neath
the curvature of the branch, and its extension above it;
whence more flower-shoots are produced, which do not require
new caudexes to pass along the bended branch; but which per∣mit
their progeny, the seeds, to fall upon the earth, and pene∣trate
it with their new roots.</P>
<P>In Lord Stafford's gardens at Trentham I remember to have
seen many years ago some standard dwarf apple-trees with all
their branches bent down, and fixed on a slight frame-work
about a foot from the ground; which seemed to be uncommonly
prolific, as a circle of white and purple flowers twenty feet in
diameter on branches radiated from a center, appeared to a dis∣tant
eye like a lunar halo, or a carpet of rich embroidery.</P>
<P>The greater production of fruit-buds on branches bended to
the horizon must contribute, I should suppose, to the prolific
effect of training nectarine and peach-trees on tiles laid on the
ground, or on the gentle de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>livity of a bank of earth facing the
south, which has lately been recommended by some one, whose
name I do not recollect, who gained a patent for his discovery.
And it is indeed probable, that both these modes of training
fruit-trees, one of which may be called an horizontal wall-tree,
and the other an horizontal espa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, would repay the labour of
the horticultor; as they would be exposed to a more vertical
sun in summer, which might more certainly ripen their fruit;
and would be kept somewhat backwarder in the early spring,
by the greater obliquity of the sun-beams, and might be there∣fore
less liable to injury from the vernal frost; and when in
<PB N="361" REF="366"/>
blossom might easily be covered in the night, when necessary,
by mats thrown over them supported by stakes with horizontal poles on them.</P>
<P>2. Secondly. <HI>The twisting a wire, or tying a waxed string
round the viviparous branches of a tree, induces them to become
oviparous,</HI> as observed by Mr. Whitmill, who bound not only
the viviparous shoots of various wall-trees with strong wire, but
also some of their large roots, and thus increased the product
of his fruit. Bradley on Gardening, Vol II. p. 155. And
M. Buffon produced the same effect by a tight cord round the
branches, which previously produced leaf-buds instead of flower-buds.
Act. Paris. ann. 1738.</P>
<P>M. Buffon concludes from the above experiments, that an
ingrafted branch bears fruit more copiously, and more certainly,
from its vessels being compressed by the callus around the ingraft∣ed
junction, which may have this effect, and at the same time
contribute by preventing the luxuriant growth of its leaf shoots
to render the tree of more dwar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish stature. I am informed
that many dwarf apple-trees, which are now planted in garden
pots both in France and England, bear much fruit, and are
elegantly placed in the centre of a desert at luxurious tables;
and that the principal art of producing them consists in ingraft∣ing
them three or four times, scion on scion; so that the stem is
compressed by the callus of three or four ingraftments before the
branches are permitted to divaricate; and the trees are thus
rendered beautiful dwarfs.</P>
<P>The effect of thus compressing the bark by a wire, or a cord,
or by the callus round the junctures of the ingrafted scions, is
undoubtedly accomplished by the increased difficulty opposed to
the production of the caudexes for each new embryon leaf-bud,
as above explained, and the consequent generation of flower-buds
instead of them.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Thirdly.</HI> The wounding, or breaking a viviparous branch,
or cutting away a ring of the bark, as of pear-trees, or a semi-cylinder
of the bark of other fruit-trees, induces them to become
oviparous.</P>
<P>Where young trees discover too great vigour, Mr. Lawrence
advises to cut the most vigorous shoots two parts in three
<PB N="362" REF="367"/>
through, leaving a large notch, that the wound may not heal
too soon; which he adds will both render them fruitful, make
them more readily conform to the wall or espalier, and preserve
such as are dwarfs from too much aspiring in very strong
branches, especially of pears; he recommends two or more
such incisions to be made in the same branch.</P>
<P>Another method he proposes is to break the too vigorous
branches half through with the hand, which he has practised
with success in apricot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and peaches, when the branches were
formed directly forward from the wall, and these branches have
continued several years to bear fruit, though some have occa∣sionally
died by effusing gum; and though these incisions and
breaking the branches may be performed at any time of the
year, he prefers the spring on account of the wet or frost of
winter. Art of Gardening.</P>
<P>A complete cylinder of the bark about an inch in height was
cut off from the branch of a pear-tree against a wal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Mr.
Howard's garden at Lichfield about five years ago; the circum∣cised
part is now not above half the diameter of the branch
above and below it, yet this branch has been full of fruit every
year since, when the other branches of the tree bore only spar∣ingly.
I lately observed, that the leaves of this wounded
branch were smaller and paler, and the fruit less in size, and
ripened sooner than on the other parts of the tree; and another
branch has the bark taken off not quite all round with much
the same effect.</P>
<P>The theory of this curious vegetable fact receives great light
from the foregoing account of the individuality of buds. A
flower-bud dies when it has perfected its seed, like an annual
plant, and hence requires no place on the bark for new caudexes
to pass downwards; but on the contrary leaf-buds, as they ad∣vance
into shoots, form new buds in the axilla of every leaf;
which new buds require new caudexes to pass down the bark,
and thus thicken as well as elongate the branch. Now if a cy∣linder
of the bark be destroyed, many of these new caudexes
cannot be produced; and thence more of the buds will be con∣verted
into flower-buds.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="368"/>
In this curious circumstance the caudexes of the buds of the
tree above the decorticated part seem to have emitted short ra∣dicles
into the alburnum; the vessels of which must thus have
acted as capillary tubes between the upper and lower caudexes
of those buds; as capillary tubes will raise water by the attrac∣tion
of their internal surfaces nearly to their summits, when
they are not too high in proportion to their diameter; but water
will in no case flow over their summits, but will always stand
with a concave surface below the uppermost rim of the tube, in
which situation it may readily be absorbed by vegetable radi∣cles;
and may be supplied from beneath by the sap-juice raised
by the vegetable action of the absorbent vessels of the caudexes,
whose radicles terminate in the earth.</P>
<P>It is customary to debark oak trees in the spring, which are
intended to be felled in the ensuing autumn; because the bark
comes off easier at this season; and the sap-wood, or alburnum,
is believed to become harder, and more durable, if the tree
remains till the end of summer. The trees thus stripped of
their bark put forth shoots as usual with acorns on the sixth,
seventh, and eighth joints, like vines; but in the branches I
examined the joints of the debarked trees were much shorter
than those of other oak-trees, the acorns were more numerous,
and no new buds were produced above the joints which bore
acorns. From hence it appears, that the branches of decorti∣cated
oak-trees produce fewer leaf-buds, and more flower-buds.
And secondly, that the new buds of debarked oak trees con∣tinue
to obtain moisture from the alburnum after the season of
the ascent of the sap in other vegetables ceases; which in this
unnatural state of the debarked tree may act as capillary tubes,
like the alburnum of the small debarked cylinder of a pear-tree
above mentioned; or as the vessels of the alburnum may not
yet have lost their vegetable life, they may continue to absorb
sap-juice or water from their radicles, and carry it to the buds
at the summits by their spiral contractions as in the bleeding
season.</P>
<P>It is probable, that if oaks were debarked in the summer,
that much fewer leaf-buds would appear amidst the flower-buds;
because many of the latter must be advanced too far, when the
<PB N="364" REF="369"/>
trees are debarked in the spring, to be converted into flower-buds
by preventing the production of their caudexes, or by im∣peding
the ascent of the nutritive sap-juice; which in these
trees is lodged principally I suppose in the alburnum, as
spoken of in Sect. IX. 2. 8. On the same account, when
much sap-juice is taken in the vernal months from the birch or
maple for the purposes of making wine in this country, or sugar
in America, I am informed, that no great difference occurs in
the respective numbers of flower-buds or leaf-buds which then
succeed; but that the general luxuriance of the tree is dimi∣nished;
which evinces, that for the design of generating more
flower-buds and fewer leaf-buds by partial decortication, it
should be performed about Midsummer.</P>
<P>The cylindrical or semicylindrical decortication of a large
root of a tree, as well as of a branch, is said to answer the
purpose of increasing the production of fruit-buds by lessening
the number of leaf-buds; but may be subject to two inconve∣niencies;
first, that the wounded root being near the surface of
the ground may be liable to rot like the bottoms of hedge-stakes;
or like timber, which is kept in moist cellars; or the
posts of wooden bridges, which are alternately exposed to wa∣ter
and to air. A second inconvenience may occur from ter∣restrial
insects having access to the alburnum of the root, which
is often full of sweet sap-juice to invite them, and is otherwise
generally defended by an acrid rind.</P>
<P>The parts of a tree immediately below a decorticated or a
strangulated branch or root will generally become viviparous,
and will thence be said to be increased in vigour; that is, it will
produce new leaf-buds, and those of a luxuriant appearance;
because the injury of the bark of the branch or root will pre∣vent
the parts above from receiving so much of the nutritive
sap-juice, as in their sound state; and consequently the parts
beneath will possess more of it; and also because these new buds
are generated from a lower part of the caudex, and will thence
be a few years before they will acquire that maturity, or puberty,
which is necessary for the generation of flower-buds, or the
production of a sexual or seminal progeny; whence by strangu∣lating
or decorticating the alternate branches of a pear-tree they
<PB N="365" REF="370"/>
will bear for six or eight years; and the other alternate ones will
become in the same time strong and vigorous, ready to undergo
a similar operation, when the former cease to be of further use;
but the fruit will become smaller in size, though in greater num∣ber,
and ripen earlier in the season.</P>
<P>In the same manner new root-scions are said to be produced
by strangulating a branch of a root near the surface with a tight
string, or by slitting a root near the trunk, Evelyn's Sylva; as
in these cases the ascent of the sap-juice is impeded, and the
part below becomes viviparous, or produces new leaf-buds for
the reasons mentioned in the last paragraph; as is frequently
seen where the end of a branch is lopped, or beneath the scar of
the junction of an ingrafted scion. On the same account it is
not uncommon to ingraft with success on roots taken out of the
ground, and afterwards replanted; as the robinia on the root
of acacia, and any other apples on the roots of the suckers of
bur-apple, or codling, mentioned in Sect. IX. 3. 5.</P>
<P>For the same reason the roots of some plants, which are other∣wise
not easily propagated, will shoot up buds; if a part of them
next the stem of the plant be half cut through, or raised out of
the ground, and exposed to the air; as in pyramidal cam∣panula,
and geranium lobatum. And for the same reason the
lateral branches of numerous shrubs, as well as of herbaceous
plants, will put forth roots, when they are bent down into the
ground, if they are previously wounded to prevent the free
supply of the vegetable nutriment in its usual course, as in laying
carnations, dianthus.</P>
<P>A method of converting the viviparous branches of pear and
apple trees into oviparous branches is described by Mr. Fitzger∣ald
in the Philosph. Transact. Vol. LII. and seems to be supe∣rior
to the exsection of a cylinder of the bark above mentioned;
as the alburnum is not left naked after the operation. In the
month of August he made a circular incision round the princi∣pal
branches of several pear-trees, apple-trees, plum-trees, and
cherry-trees, near the stems of each, quite through the bark.
About three or four inches higher he then made another incision
round the bark, and then a perpendicular one, joining these two
circular ones, and separated the cylinder of bark nicely from the
<PB N="366" REF="371"/>
wood, covering it, and the bare part of the wood, from the air
for about a quarter of an hour, when the wound began to bleed.
He then replaced the bark with great exactness, and bound
it round rather tightly with bass, so as to cover the wound en∣tirely,
and half an inch above and below the circumcisions.</P>
<P>In about a month the bark began to swell above and below
the bandages, he then unbound them, and found the parts
quite healed. He rebound them slightly with bass, and let them
remain so till the beginning of the next summer, when he again
took off the bandages, and found them all healthy, and every
one of them bore plentifully that season, though it was in general
reckoned a scarce fruit year.</P>
<P>He treated two young pear-trees in this manner, which never
had yet had any bloom; on one of them he operated on the main
arms, and on several of the less branches from those main arms;
and on only one of the main arms of the other. The first, he
says, bore a surprizing quantity of fruit in the next summer;
and the circumcised arm of the other bore a moderate quantity;
though no other part of the tree had any appearance of bloom.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitzgerald afterwards took a cylinder of the bark from
the branches of two young apple trees about the same size, as
exactly as he could by measure; and changing them, bound
them each on the other tree. The bark of one had a leaf-bud
and two apples growing on it; the barks of both of them healed
perfectly, the leaf-bud put forth leaves, and the apples remained
on and ripened; and both the branches bore so plentifully, that
one broke with its load, and it was necessary to prop the
other.</P>
<P>The theory of the success of these curious experiments con∣firms
that delivered above concerning the scars made by the
junction of ingrafted scions with the stocks; and it is probable,
that three or four circular incisions through the bark on vivipa∣rous
pear or apple trees, or a spiral incision, as described in
Sect. IX. 2. 8. might answer the purpose without detracting
and replacing the bark; as scars or callous circles would be thus
produced, which might render it more difficult for the new
caudexes of the embryon leaf-buds to be generated, or their
parts united, and consequently increase the number of flower-buds.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="372"/>
Mr. Fitzgerald further observes, that he changed cylinders
of the bark with equal success of nectarine and peach trees;
and that the branches thus operated upon were retarded in their
general growth; which coincides with the idea of repeatedly
grafting one scion above another on the apple-trees designed for
dwarfs to be set in garden pots, as described in No. 2. 2. of
this Section.</P>
<P>4. The transplanting a viviparous fruit-tree, or destroying some
of its roots before Midsummer, or the confining its roots in a garden
pot, or on a floor of bricks beneath the soil, will induce it to become
oviparous.</P>
<P>Mr. Knight, in his treatise on the Culture of the Apple and
Pear, p. 83, has the following passage. “In the garden cul∣ture
of the apple, where the trees are retained as dwarfs or espa∣liers,
the more vigorously growing kinds are often rendered un∣productive
by the excessive, though necessary, use of the prun∣ing
knife. I have always succeeded in making trees of this
kind fruitful by digging them up, and replacing them with some
fresh mould in the same situation. The too great luxuriance of
growth is checked, and a disposition to bear is in consequence
brought on.” The same observation was made by Mr. Law∣rence,
who took up trees which were too vigorous; that is,
which produced viviparous buds instead of oviparous ones, and
replanted them to render them fruitful. Art of Gardening.
Lond. 1723.</P>
<P>In transplanting trees for any purpose it may be observed,
that they should not be replanted deep in the soil, since the
most nutritive or salubrious parts of the earth are those within
the reach of the sun's warmth, of the descending moisture, and
of the oxygen of the atmosphere. And as the root-fibres of trees, like those of seeds, always grow towards the moistest part
of the soil, as the young shoots and leaves grow towards the
purest air and brightest light; it follows, that the root-fibres
seldom rise higher in the ground than they were originally set,
and seldom elongate themselves even perfectly horizontally; so
that when a fruit-tree is planted too deep in the earth, it seldom
grows with healthy vigour, either in respect to its leaf-buds or
its flower-buds.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="373"/>
This curious effect cannot be produced by generally debilitat∣ing
the tree from its want of due nourishment; because it is said
to succeed best in very good soil, or by the addition of new
garden mould, as before directed; but by rendering more dif∣ficult
the production of radicles from the caudexes of the em∣bryon
leaf-buds; which descend to the sinest ramifications of
the old roots, and elongate themselves beyond the extremities
of their ultimate fibrils; a great number of which roots being
torn off by transplantation, or compressed in a garden pot, the
production or progress of many of the new radicles must be im∣peded
or prevented; and the numerous caudexes of new leaf-buds
be in consequence formed with greater difficulty, whence
an increased tendency to generate flower-buds.</P>
<P>For the same reason if beans, vicia faba, which are but a few
inches high, be transplanted; they do not become so tall, but
they flower and ripen their seeds sooner; because they can not
so easily generate new leaf-buds. The same occurs in frequent∣ly
transplanting brocoli, brassica; the plant does not grow so
tall, but has earlier flowers, and in greater number; and it is
hence better to pluck them up, than to dig them up, for the pur∣pose
of replanting them; as by that means more of the root-fibres
are torn off, and the plants become almost totally oviparous.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the vessels of animal bodies are less
liable to bleed, when they are torn asunder, than when they are
cut with a sharp instrument; as their diameters are contracted,
or their internal surfaces brought into contact with each other,
in the act of extending them, till they break. Thus if the
navel-strings of new born animals are cut instead of torn, they
are liable to bleed to death; and there is a remarkable case of
a miller's servant, who had his arm and shoulder bone, or sca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pula,
torn off in a windmill without much loss of blood. This
is mentioned to shew, that it may also be better to tear up roots,
which are transplanted for this purpose, than to dig them up;
is they may thence effuse less vegetable blood, and in conse∣quence
be less weakened by the operation.</P>
<P>In transplanting strawberries many of the roots being torn off,
fewer leaf-buds, and consequent wires, are produced from the
difficulty, which their embryon caudexes find in producing new
<PB N="369" REF="374"/>
radicles over the old ones to supply nutriment to the wires, till
they bend down and protrude roots into the ground at their
other extremities, whence a greater number of flower-buds are
generated; on this account the roots of strawberries should ge∣nerally
be transplanted, or new ones from the wires should be
cultivated, every third or fourth year, to prevent the too luxu∣riant
growth of their wires; or a similar difficulty of producing
wires or leaf-buds may be effected by crowding the roots of
strawberries together, as some gardeners recommend; but I
suppose by these means the fruit may become smaller from scar∣city
of nutriment, though more numerous.</P>
<P>A floor of bricks, or of stone, extended about two feet deep
beneath the roots of wall trees, has been practised in some
gardens from an idea, that the roots shot themselves too deep
into some unwholesome stratum of earth; and it has been ob∣served,
that the trees became better fruit-bearers. In some
situations it is possible, this might be the cause of the new pro∣lific
property of the trees; but I suspect it has occurred gene∣rally
from the difficulty opposed to the number and elongation
of the root-fibres, and consequently to the generation of the
new caudexes of the embryon leaf-buds; whence a greater pro∣duction
of flower-buds ensued.</P>
<P>In similar manner it is asserted by one of the Linnean school
in the Amoenitates Academicae, that some bulbous rooted
plants, which seldom produce seeds in Sweden, will produce
prolific seeds, if their roots be confined in a garden pot, till
they crowd each other; as those of the lily of the valley, con∣vallaria.
And that the orchis will bear prolific seeds, if the
new root early in the season be severed from the old one, which
has put up the flower-stem. This must occur in the former
case from the difficulty, which the plants find to generate new
offsets at their roots, which are their viviparous progeny; and
in the latter case from the new offset being destroyed; whence
in both situations more nutriment is expended on the flower.</P>
<P>On the same account it is probable, that confining the roots
of cucumbers and melons in small garden pots would stop the
too luxuriant growth of their leaf-buds, and render them sooner
oviparous, if care was taken to supply them with water more
<PB N="370" REF="375"/>
frequently, and with sufficient nutriment by mixing with the
water some of the carbonic black fluid, which has drained from
a manure heap.</P>
<P>5. <HI>If the central viviparous branches of a plant be cut away
or shortened, the lateral ones will sooner or more completely become
oviparous.</HI> 1. There are many very small buds on the lower
parts of large branches, which do not seem to grow to matu∣rity,
and in consequence produce neither new leaf-buds nor new
flower-buds. There are other lateral shoots on many trees,
which only push out a few inches, and are called spurs, and
which bear fruit the succeeding summer at their extremities.
In many other plants the lateral branches are oviparous, except
at the extremity, which is terminated with a viviparous bud;
while the central branches continue long to generate only a vi∣viparous
progeny, as in vines and melons.</P>
<P>The first of these, or the unprolific existence of the buds at
the bottom of large branches, may be owing in part to their
feebler efforts of pullulation from the want of sufficient sunshine
and ventilation; and also in part, like the spurs, and other la∣teral
branches, to the difficulty they encounter in producing the
embryon caudexes of new leaf-buds along the trunk; which is
already occupied by those of the more vigorous vegetation of the
central branches, which possess a greater share of sunshine and
ventilation.</P>
<P>But the principal cause, which renders the spurs and lateral
branches oviparous, results from the resistance the embryon
caudexes of leaf-buds experience by the curvature of the lateral
branch, where it joins the trunk, and the consequent coarctation
of its vessels, added to the difficulty every lateral bud has to
encounter from its own curvature at its exit from the parent
twig; on which last account the central bud at the extremity
of an oviparous branch is generally viviparous, because it has not
any curvature at its exit. All this corresponds with the fact
above described, that when the viviparous arms of wall-trees
are bent down to the horizon, they become oviparous. See
No. 2. 1. of this Section.</P>
<P>2. What then happens in all these situations when the central
parts are cut away or shortened? First the dwarf buds at the
<PB N="371" REF="376"/>
bottom of these large viviparous branches, which are in part
cut away, will find more room to push down the embryon cau∣dexes
of new leaf-buds; and will produce a viviparous progeny;
and those at the bottom of oviparous branches, which are shor∣tened
by cutting off their viviparous extremities, will also now
pullulate, and produce flower-buds for the succeeding year,
owing to the derivation of some of that nourishment to them,
which would otherwise have been expended on the summit-bud.
Secondly, the spurs will generate an oviparous progeny, but
will acquire more nutriment, because all the vessels of plants in∣osculate,
as mentioned in Sect. IX. 2. 10. and will thence pro∣duce
larger fruit, and more certainly ripen it. Thirdly, the
other lateral branches will receive more nourishment, and be∣come
more vertical, and will thence find less opposition to the
production of the caudexes, both of their flower-buds and leaf-buds;
either of which may become stronger or more numerous
according to the greater or less inclination of the branches to the
horizon; and both of them may be more vigorous properly
speaking; that is, they may become larger leaf-buds, or larger
flower-buds, than others of the same tree.</P>
<P>3. Thus in the management of MELONS, which would grow
into branches much too extensive for the artificial glass-frames
of our climate, and would not have time to ripen their later fruit
in our short summers; it is necessary first to check the vigour,
properly so speaking, of the whole plant. This is done by wash∣ing
the seed from the ripe fruit, which should naturally contri∣bute
to nourish it; and by keeping the seed four or five years, that
the mucilaginous nutriment deposited in the cotyledons may also
be in some degree impaired; it is also probable, that confining
the roots of melons and cucumbers in garden-pots, if they were
well supplied with nutriment, warmth, and water, might be
advantageous for this purpose.</P>
<P>Secondly, as soon as the leaf appears an inch in diameter, ex∣perienced
gardeners pick out the central bud, which causes an
oviparous, though a more vigorous, lateral shoot; which there∣fore
sooner bears fruit, and that of a larger kind; as it acquires
more nourishment from the destruction of the central one.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="377"/>
And as these lateral branches are liable to produce other
viviparous shoots at their extremities, after they have generated
lateral flower-buds, it again becomes necessary to pinch off the
viviparous extremities of them, not only to accommodate them
to the size of the glass-frame, but also to supply them with more
nutriment, which would otherwise have been expended on the
viviparous summit.</P>
<P>The central bud, or summit, of the lateral branches, is ge∣nerally
viviparous, as well as of the central branches; because
the embryon caudexes of its new offspring are opposed in the
production along the bark by only one curvature at the insertion
of the branch into the trunk; whereas the lateral buds of the
lateral branches have the progress of the embryon caudexes of
their new buds opposed by two curvatures, one of the bud to
the branch, and another from the branch to the trunk.</P>
<P>The is another reason, why the lateral buds of many plants
produce flowers sooner than the summit; which is, that the
lateral buds of those plants, where the pith of the upright cen∣tral
shoot is not divided, are propagated from the central shoot,
and are therefore one generation older; and have thus acquir∣ed
the maturity necessary for amatorial reproduction. In other
plants, where the pith of the stem is divided at every joint, the
summit bud has been preceded by more generations, and is
therefore more mature for the purpose of producing flowers,
that the lateral ones, as in a stem of wheat; and probably in
the artichoke, and on the spurs of some fruit trees, as of
pears.</P>
<P>4. It was observed in Sect. IX. 3. 1. that in the stems of
wheat three or four joints are formed above each other previous
to that, which bears the ear; and that in many other annual or
biennial plants two or three viviparous lateral shoots occur, as
in artichoke, cinara; and salsafi, tragopogon, before the cen∣tral
one flowers. The same happens to the vine-shoots; two
or three joints with a leaf and a viviparous bud at each are
always first produced; and as each of these have a division of
the pith between every joint, as remarked in Sect. I. 8. I
suppose, that these joints are separate plants growing on each
other like the joints of the stem of wheat; and that hence in
<PB N="373" REF="378"/>
vine-shoots three or four successive generations of leaf-shoots must
exist, before the new shoot can attain sufficient maturity to form
a flower; as the amatorial generation of seeds was shewn to re∣quire
higher animation, if it may be so called, than the lateral
generation of leaf-buds. The same mode of growth occurs in
the young shoots of oaks, and which is thus curiously accounted
for.</P>
<P>The lateral branches of many mature trees, though they bear
flower-buds on their sides, are generally terminated with a leaf-bud,
as above explained; but it happens in some of them, and
particularly to vines, that after two or three flower-buds are
produced on a lateral branch, that it shall proceed to grow in
length, and to produce leaf-buds at every joint above the flower-buds,
as well as at the summit; which may be thus perhaps sa∣tisfactorily
explained. After the third, and fourth, and fifth
joints of a new lateral shoot have generated flowers, which re∣quire
few or no more caudexes; room enough is left on the
bark of the shoot for those above them to acquire the numerous
new miniature caudexes of embryon leaf-buds, and where the
new caudexes of embryon buds can easily be produced along
the bark, and sufficient nutriment is supplied; all vegetables are
more liable to propagate themselves by buds than by seeds.</P>
<P>Hence in the management of VINES, as well as of MELONS,
it is useful at two or three joints above the last bunch of fruit
to pinch off the viviparous end of the new branch, not so much
to accommodate the length of it to the house, as to supply the
growing fruit with more nourishment from the inosculations of
the vessels of the caudexes of these viviparous buds, which are
now cut off, with those of the oviparous ones, which remain.</P>
<P>A curious vegetable fact, which appears in the culture of
VINES in hot-houses here presents itself to our notice. When a
vigorous shoot advances without producing fruit-buds at the third
or fourth joint, it is frequently permitted to grow in length to
above twenty feet; but at every joint the new or secondary bud
is pinched off, either soon after its appearance, or after it has
shot out one or two joints. By this management of permitting
the central summit of the shoot to grow till August or Sep∣tember,
the eyes, whose buds have been pinched off, do not
<PB N="374" REF="379"/>
put out afresh during that summer; but new buds are formed
at each eye, which germinate the next summer, and almost all
of them produce fruit.</P>
<P>If however some of the shoots in the bosom of these leaves
are pinched off too soon after their appearance, they are occa∣sionally
liable to generate new leaf-buds, which shoot out afresh
from the same eye; and it is said, that these eyes, which have
thus produced two leaf-buds in succession in one summer, will
not generally produce buds of any kind in the succeeding sum∣mer;
for as several of these joints in vigorous vines bear two or
three buds from the same eye at the same time, so others bear
them in succession.</P>
<P>The theory of these important facts may not be easy to inves∣tigate;
it is commonly supposed, that pinching off the lateral
shoots at every bud of a new vine-branch strengthens the next
year's expected bud, by not expending so much nutritive juice;
and that giving the vines a fortnight's artificial heat, after the
summer heat lessens, ripens the wood for the production of the
next year's fruit; but these are words, I imagine, without ac∣curate
ideas. I suppose, when each lateral shoot of this year's
branch of a vine is pinched off, that its caudexes, which had
already formed a part of the bark, coalesce; and may thus ren∣der
it more difficult for the caudexes of the succeeding embryon
bud in the same eye, which is to be expanded next spring, to
be produced along the bark, by having previously occupied the
situation which those new caudexes would require; and that
thus the secondary buds of these eyes become flower-buds, which
might otherwise have been leaf-buds.</P>
<P>The continued heat a week or two above the usual time of
summer, which is said to ripen the wood, may contribute to
dry and harden it, as well as to forward the growth of the buds;
and thus both to render the protrusion of embryon roots more
difficult, and consequently to produce flower-buds, and those of
a larger kind.</P>
<P>Whether a similar method to this practised on vines could be
applied with advantage in the management of other fruit-trees
is a circumstance of great importance, and can only be deter∣mined
by experiment. But as the first foliage of euonymus is
<PB N="375" REF="380"/>
generally destroyed by insects in this country, and yet a second
growth of foliage is produced; and as I witnessed last year,
that the whole first leaves of an apple-tree were destroyed, as
was believed, by lightning, and which yet put forth an entire
new set of leaves in a few weeks; is there not reason to con∣clude,
that if the leaf-buds were picked out early in the season
from a strong shoot of peach or apricot, either new leaf-buds
might be produced in that summer, or flower-buds in the suc∣ceding
one, as happens to the vine-shoots above described; and
that our wall-trees might be thus rendered more certainly proli∣fic.
And lastly, might not the clipping out with fine scissars
the extremities of young vine-shoots, which would otherwise be
barren ones, convert, some of their tendrils into bunches by
thus supplying them with additional nutriment, by preventing
its expenditure in the elongation of the viviparous branch? This
experiment might be the more readily tried, as some assert, that
the barren buds may be distinguished from the prolific ones by
their form before they expand.</P>

<HEAD>III. TO PERFECT AND ENLARGE THE FRUIT.</HEAD>
<P>It is believed by some of the Linnean school, that flower-buds
or leaf-buds may be converted into each other in the early state
of their existence, as mentioned in Sect. IX. 2. 8. It is indeed
probable, that either a flower-bud or leaf-bud may be generated
instead of each other reciprocally, before either of them exists;
but after either of them has obtained a certain degree of maturity,
so as to be distinguished by its form being more pointed or more
spherical; I suspect no addition or detraction of nutriment, or
of the facility of the production of its embryon caudexes down
the bark and radicles beneath can change its destination.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Shorten the oviparous branches, when the leaves fall off, by
pruning their viviparous summits, and cut away the root-suckers.</HI>
The summits of the lateral branches, as well as the erect ones,
are furnished generally with viviparous buds; which in many
wall trees should be cut off, after the leaves fall in autumn;
that more nutriment may be derived to the fruit-buds, which
may occasionally become somewhat enlarged during the milder
days of winter; as they are now certainly too far advanced to
be changed into leaf-buds; and if this pruning be deferred till
late in the winter months, the flower-buds will not be quite so
forward, as if it be performed earlier. For the same reason the
root-suckers also should be cut away in the autumn, that all the
nutriment, which they would otherwise expend, may be derived
to the flower-buds, and induce them early to enlarge them∣selves.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Pinch or rub off all useless viviparous buds in the spring or
summer, as they occur.</HI> In those trees where the fruit-buds arise
on the new leaf-shoots along with the leaf-buds, and cannot
therefore be sooner distinguished or approached, as in figs and
vines; the summit leaf-buds should be pinched off two joints abovet
the fruit-buds, as soon as they appear, that more nutriment may
be conveyed to the fruit-buds. See No. 3. 4. of this Section.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="382"/>
And in the hardier wall-trees the new leaf-buds, which appear
during the spring and summer months in wrong places, where
they cannot be trained properly against the wall, or where they
are too numerous, should be rubbed or pinched off, as they oc∣cur;
whence more nourishment will be derived to the ripening
fruit, and to those new leaf-buds which are to remain to produce
future flower-buds.</P>
<P>And if the new buds, which are seen in their young state in
the axilla of the leaves of the new shoots, were picked out by
the point of a knife, or pinched off, where they grow long
enough for that purpose as the secondary shoots of vines in
grape houses are pinched; it might probably induce those eyes
to produce flowers in the succeeding year, as spoken of in No.
2. 5. of this Section, as well as contribute to enlarge the pre∣sent
fruit by the expenditure of less nutriment on the leaf-buds,
an idea well deserving the test of experiment.</P>
<P>In the same manner in the cultivation of melons and cucum∣bers
after the central bud is pinched off, as mentioned above No.
2. 5. the viviparous extremities of the lateral branches should
be also destroyed, as soon as a sufficient number of female flowers
are impregnated; that a greater share of nutriment may be
de∣rived
to them, instead of crowding the frame with new branches,
whose fruit-buds would be too late to ripen in our short sum∣mers.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Thin all those fruits, which are too numerous; pluck off
apricots, peaches, gooseberries; and cut out many grapes from each
branch with scissars.</HI> By the inosculation of the vessels of vege∣tables
mentioned in Sect. I. 3. when any parts of a tree are
destroyed, those in their vicinity become more vigorous. On
this account when part of the fruit is taken away as early as may
be, the remaining part acquires more nutriment. Add to this,
that, where the fruit is crowded, some of it becomes precluded
from the sun and air, and in consequence does not perfectly
ripen, and is liable to become mouldy; for mucor is a vegeta∣ble
production, which like other fungi does not require either
much light or air, as appears from the growth of some fungus∣ses
in dark cellars, and of common mushrooms beneath beds of
straw, as mentioned in Sect. XIII. 1. 4.</P>
<Q><PB N="378" REF="383"/>
4. Prevent the production of new leaf-buds.</Q>
<P>In some pear trees the whole of the blossoms become sterile,
and fall off without any apparent injury from cold, and this for
many successive years. The same occurs sometimes to chesnut
trees, aesculus pavia, after the flower the fructification entirely
falls off; some of these might be male flowers, as Miller ob∣serves,
but the whole could not be such. The same happens
very frequently to the fig-trees of this climate, sometimes the
whole crop falls off, when they are about the size of filberts;
that is, while they are still in flower, which though concealed
within the fig, must precede the swelling of the seeds, whether
these be impregnated or not.</P>
<P>A correspondent fact occurred to me a few years ago. I had
six young trees of the Ischia fig with fruit on them in pots in a
stove. On removing them into larger boxes the figs fell off,
which I ascribed to the increased vigour of the plants; as they
protruded very vigorous shoots occasioned by the accumulation
of new soil round their roots. Perhaps these plants might rather
be said to have been in flower than in fruit, and perhaps these
flowers were all male ones only, or accompanied only with im∣perfect
female ones?</P>
<P>Whence I conclude, that about the season when the corals
of these flowers with their stamens and stigmas die, the trees
generate and nourish too many new leaf-buds, owing to the faci∣lity
with which they can produce the new caudexes of these
young buds down the bark; and that by the whole of the vege∣table
sap-juice being derived to the new buds for their present
growth, or to form reservoirs for their future growth, the peri∣carp
and seeds, whether impregnated or not, are deprived of
their due nutriment and fall off. See Sect. XVI. 1. 4.</P>
<P>Hence I propose to tie waxed thread or fine wire round the
twigs of pear-trees, which have usually miscarried, as
soon as they are in flower, so as to compress, but not so as to strangu∣late
them; or to wound the bark by a circular or semicircular
incision, which might counteract their facility of procreating
new leaf-buds; which I suspect would be more effectual in pre∣venting
the flowers from falling off, than pinching off the new
<PB N="379" REF="384"/>
leaf-buds, as they appear; which is recommended by Dr. Brad∣ley
in the management of fig-trees, and is done to vines in hot-houses;
but which I found to be ineffectual on many fig-branches
both in the natural ground and in pots, and ascribed its failure
to the continuance of the efforts of the fig-tree to produce new
leaf-buds; whereas in vines, I suppose, the grapes would ripen,
whether the new leaf-buds remain or are destroyed. See No.
3. 2. of this Section.</P>
<P>Pontedera observed, that in the islands of the Archipelago
some fig-trees bear in the spring many male flowers, and few
female ones, the former of which fall off; and that they bear
a second crop chiefly of female flowers in the autumn, which
ripen in the ensuing spring. Anthologia. Can this occur in the
fig-trees of this country?</P>
<P>Other figs are said not to ripen but to fall off before their
maturity, unless they be wounded by insects in their caprifica∣tion,
or punctured by a straw. A further investigation of this
subject is much wanted to propagate figs with success in this
climate. See Botanic Garden, Vol. II. note on caprificus.
See also Milne's Botan. Diction. Article caprification.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Give additional moisture, manure, and warmth during the
early part of the growth of fruit.</HI> By additional moisture the
fruit becomes larger; in hot-houses this may be effected two
ways, one by watering the earth on which the vegetables grow,
and another by producing steam by watering the warm flues or
floors; which will afterwards in the colder hours be again con∣densed,
and settle in the form of dew on the fruit and leaves.</P>
<P>By supplying vegetables as well as animals with an abundancy
of fluid, they are liable to increase in bulk, both because the ex∣ternal
cuticle, which confines the growth of both of them, be∣comes
relaxed, as is seen in the hands of those women, who
have many hours been employed in washing; and also because
the eutaneous absorbent vessels will thus imbibe more fluid
from the external surface; and the cellular absorbents will there∣fore
imbibe less from the internal cells, and consequently more
mucus or fat will remain in them.</P>
<P>Thus in Lancashire, where premiums are given for large
goose-berries, I am told, that some of those who are solicitous
<PB N="380" REF="385"/>
for the prizes, not only thin the fruit of a gooseberry-tree, so
as to leave but two or three gooseberries on a branch, but then
by supporting a tea-saucer under each of these gooseberries,
bathe it for some weeks in so much water as to cover about a
fourth part of it, which they call suckling the gooseberry.</P>
<P>In some parts of the Carnatic, where rice is cultivated, they
are said not to derive the water on it, till it is in flower; be∣cause
that would induce the stem to shoot too luxuriantly, like
our wheat-crops in wet-seasons; but, as soon as it is in flower,
they find it expedient to flood it with water for the purpose of
filling and enlarging the ears, (Communications to Board of
Agriculture, Vol. I. p. 355,) which it may effect both by re∣laxing
the cuticle of the grain, and preventing the too great
internal absorption of the mucus or starch deposited in the cells
of it; and lastly by supplying it with more nutriment.</P>
<P>There are two circumstances to be attended to in giving water
to plants; which are, not to water them during the hot part
of the day in summer, nor in the evenings of spring, when a
frost may be expected; in both these circumstances we may be
said to copy nature, as rain is generally preceded by a cloudy
sky, and is never accompanied by frost; though that sometimes
follows it, and is then very injurious to vegetation.</P>
<P>When plants have been long simulated by a hot sunshine
into violent action, if this stimulus of heat be too greatly and
too suddenly diminished by the affusion of cold water, or by its
sudden evaporation, their vessels cease to act, and death ensues;
exactly as has too frequently happened to those, who have bath∣ed
in a cold spring of water after having been heated by violent
and continued exercise on a hot day. When severe frost fol∣lows
the watering of plants, they are rendered torpid, and die
by the too great and sudden diminution of the stimulus of heat;
which is equally necessary to the activity of vegetable as to ani∣mal
fibres; and in some instances the circulation of their fluids
may be stopped by the congelation of them; and in others their
vessels may be burst by the expansion attending the conversion
of water into ice; or lastly, by the separation of their different
fluids by congelation. See Sect. XV. 4. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="386"/>
When an addition of manure can be procured, as where the
black carbonic juice from a dunghill mixed with water, or soap-suds,
which have been used in washing, can be employed in∣stead
of water alone; it must undoubtedly add to the nutriment,
and consequently enlarge the size of the fruit by that means
also, as well as by the additional water.</P>
<P>Where too much moisture is given without at the same time
an addition of warmth, some inconveniencies are liable to oc∣cur,
as a less aromatic and saccharine flavour of the fruit.
When therefore fruits become nearly ripe, less water should be
given them, unless it is convenient at the same time to increase
the heat, in which they are immersed, as may be done in some
hot-houses; and then the flavour of the fruit may be heighten∣ed,
as well as its size increased, as shewn by Mr. Bastard in
the Philosophical Transact. who planted pine-apple plants in ves∣sels
of water, and placed these vessels near the top of the hot-house,
or on the fire-flues, for the purpose of supplying them
with a greater heat; and produced by these means both larger,
as he asserts, and better flavoured pine apples.</P>
<P>On this important subject I shall transcribe his words, and
shall only add, that steam from boiling water is now successfully
used in some hot-houses for the growth both of vines and of
pines, but must require some attention in the application of it;
as it is occasionally conveyed through small apertures, which
perforate a brick arch, which is constructed somewhat like
the floor of a malt-kiln, where the water boils beneath the beds of
bark or of soil; and is occasionally admitted into the room
above, and thus supplies moisture and heat both to the ground
and to the air of the hot-house</P>
<P>“My hot-house is covered with the best crown glass, which
I apprehend gives more heat than the common sort of green
glass generally used for hot-houses. In the front part of the
house, and indeed any where in the lowest parts of it, the
pine-apple plants will not thrive well in water. The way in
which I treat them is as follows. I place a shelf near the high∣est
part of the back wall, so that the pine-plants may stand
without absolutely touching the glass, but as near it as can be.
On this shelf I place pans full of water, about seven or eight
<PB N="382" REF="387"/>
inches deep; and in these pans I put the pine-apple plants,
growing in the same pots of earth, as they are generally planted
in to be plunged into the bark-bed in the common way; that is,
I put the pot of earth with the pine-plant in it in the pan full of
water; and as the water decreases, I constantly fill up the pan.
I place either plants in fruit, or young plants as soon as they are
well rooted, in these pans of water, and find they thrive equal∣ly
well; the fruit reared this way is always much larger, as well
as better flavoured, than when ripened in the bark-bed. I
have more than once put only the plants themselves without any
earth, I mean after they had roots, into these pans of water,
with only water sufficient to keep the roots always covered,
and found them flourish beyond expectation. A neighbour of
mine has placed a leaden cistern upon the top of the back flue,
(in which, as it is in contact with the flue, the water is always
warm, when there is fire in the house,) and finds his fruit ex∣cellent
and large.</P>
<P>“The way I account for this success is, that the warm air
always ascending to the part, where this shelf is placed, as be∣ing
the highest part of the house, keeps it much hotter than in
any other part. The temperature at that place is, I believe
seldom less than what is indicated by the 73d degree of Fahren∣heit's
thermometer; and when the sun shines, it is often at
above 100°; the water the plants grow in seems to enable
them to bear the greatest heat, if sufficient air be allowed; and
I often see the roots of the plants growing out of the holes in
the bottom of the pot of earth, and shooting vigorously in the
water.</P>
<P>“It is not foreign to this purpose to mention, that, as a per∣son
was moving a large pine-plant from the hot-bed in my house
last summer, which plant was just shewing fruit, by some acci∣dent
he broke off the plant just above the earth in which it
grew, and there was no root whatever left to it; by way of
experiment I took the plant, and fixed it upright in a pan of
water (without any earth whatever) on the shelf; it there soon
threw out roots, and bore a pine-apple that weighed upwards of
two pounds.” Philos. Transact. Vol LXVII.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="388"/>
6. <HI>Protect the early flowers and the late fruits from frost.</HI>
The vernal frosts are very pernicious to the early blossoms of
apples and pears, and of all the tender wall-trees; various
contrivances have been used to shelter them, as mats suspended
before wall-trees; which in Denmark are said to be used to
shelter them from the mid-day sun, as well as from the night-frosts;
both to prevent them from flowering too early, and be∣ing
thence exposed to severer frosts; and because vegetables suf∣fer
more from great cold, as well as animals, after having been
exposed to great heat, as explained in Sect. XIV. 2. 2.</P>
<P>Those parts of vegetables, which are most succulent, suffer
most from frost, as the young tops of tender trees, as of the
ash, fraxinus, and weeping willow, salix babylonica; and also
all other vegetables after having been exposed to much moisture,
as to rain or dews; which probably may occur in part from the
greater sensibility of the tender juicy summits of the present
year's growth, and partly from the expansion of their frozen
juices, which may burst the containing vessels.</P>
<P>An important question here occurs, is a low situation to be
chosen for a garden? The greater warmth of low situations,
and their being generally better sheltered from the cold north-east
winds, and the boisterous south-west winds, are agreeable
circumstances; as the N. E. winds in this climate are the freez∣ing
winds; and S. W. winds being more violent, are liable
much to injure standard fruit-trees in summer by dashing their
branches against each other, and thence bruising, or beating off
the fruit; but in low situations the fogs in vernal evenings, by
moistening the young shoots of trees, and their early flowers,
render them much more liable to the injuries of the frosty
nights, which succeed them, which they escape in higher situa∣tions.
These fogs, which are seen by the sides of rivers, and
on damp plains or valleys after sun-set, are converted into rime
during the night. And as at the time of these fogs there is
generally no wind, the dew falls perpendicularly, and the rime is
formed most frequently on the upper surface of objects,
which may then therefore be more readily sheltered from it
than at other times, when the freezing fog is blown forwards
<PB N="384" REF="389"/>
by the wind, and the rime is formed on one side of the branches of trees.</P>
<P>In some circumstances the rime is believed to defend the ve∣getables
on which it is formed, by the heat it gives out at the in∣stant
of its freezing, and by covering them from the cold like
snow upon the ground; and thence the black frosts, which are
not attended with rime, are said to be more prejudicial. But
where dew or mist descends on vegetable leaves before the act
of freezing commences, and is in part absorbed by them; they
become more succulent, and hence are destroyed by their fluids
being converted into ice, and bursting the vessels already dis∣tended
with more water, than they would otherwise possess.
See Sect. XIII. 2. 2.</P>
<P>Mr. Bradley gives a decisive fact in regard to this subject.
A friend of his had two gardens, one not many feet below the
other, but so different that the low garden often appeared
flooded with the evening mists, when none appeared in the up∣per
one; and in a letter to Mr. Bradley he complains that his
lower garden is much injured by the vernal frost, and not his
upper one. A similar fact is mentioned by Mr. Lawrence,
who observes, that he has often seen the leaves and tender
shoots of tall ash-trees in blasting mists to be frozen, and as it
were singed, in all the lower parts and middle of the tree;
while the upper part, which was above the mist, has been un∣injured.
Art of Gardening. In confirmation of this idea I
well remember many years ago to have travelled sixty miles,
partly in the valley of the Trent, and partly over adjacent hills,
on the sixth of May; and to have observed that the new shoots
of all the ash-trees in the vallies had their young extre∣mities
entirely turned black by the frost of the preceding
night; but that on the hills they had escaped, which I at first
ascribed to the trees being less forward on the hills, but believe
it was more probably owing to the greater succulence of those
in the valleys, and to their having been previously exposed to
the moisture of the evening mist.</P>
<P>The precipitation or adhesion of moisture to vegetables, when
misty air is blown against them, is well described by Mr. White
in his history of Shelborne; who observed on a foggy day with
<PB N="385" REF="390"/>
some wind, that so much moisture was deposited on a tree,
that it ran down upon the ground, and filled the ruts of a lane
beneath it, which was dry elsewhere. On the same account in
the early spring the grass is seen to become green sooner under
the spreading branches of trees than in their vicinity. See Bo∣tanic
Garden, Vol. I. note 26.</P>
<P>It is hence evident, that very low and damp situations are
not to be preferred for gardens and orchards in this climate;
and that it is in all gardens an object worthy attention to pro∣tect
in the early spring the blossoms and the young shoots from
being moistened by the descending night dews; for this purpose
some have put coping stones at the top of the fruit-walls, so as
to project six or eight inches over the trees. By the shelter of
these coping stones the descending dews, which would moisten
the young leaves and flowers, are prevented from falling on
them, and in consequence no rime is seen in the morning on
these trees. I had once an opportunity of observing some trees
beneath a protecting coping to be much safer in respect both
to their fruit and foliage, than those in their vicinity, and in
the same aspect where there were no coping stones over them.</P>
<P>But I am informed, that after the vernal frosts have ceased,
this kind of shelter is certainly injurious to the growth and per∣fection
of the fruit; which may arise from the same cause,
namely, the want of the summer night-dews to moisten the fruit,
and also the perpendicular sun-beams to ripen it. On these ac∣counts
I have proposed to make temporary sheds of boards to
project eight inches from the walls, to be held on by iron
hooks, which might easily be removed, as soon as the vernal
frosts should cease; and in one experiment on a single apricot
tree it appeared to succeed well.</P>
<P>From some experiments in a late volume in the Philosophical
Transactions, it appears, that very much more rain was caught
in glasses placed on the ground near a high church, than was
caught in similar glasses on the roof of it; which evinces, that
a much greater quantity of moisture exists in the lower parts of
the atmosphere, and is precipitated from it, than from the higher
parts; whence to protect the blossoms more effectually from the
descending dews coping boards might be placed at every two
<PB N="386" REF="391"/>
feet or less above each other, with their front edges pointing
upwards to the meridian fun in March, and ledges nailed on the
back edges to convey the rain or dews towards the central part
of the tree, where by another cross ledge at the end of each
board it might be carried from the wall.</P>
<P>A similar inconvenience from autumnal frosts affects some of
the late fruits, as figs and grapes, which might also receive ad∣vantage
from replacing the coping boards in the autumn.</P>
<P>Another method of effectually guarding against the vernal
frosts, and also the autumnal ones, is by building the garden-walls
with fire-flues in them, which is now frequently practised.
There is one secret necessary to be known, and well attended
to, in the management of fire-flues; and that is in the first place
to plant trees, which will open their flowers about the same
time, against the same flue, and then diligently to observe not
to put fire into this flue, till the trees, it is designed to assist, are
in flower; since if the fire be applied sooner, the flowers are for∣warded,
and in consequence exposed to more danger from the
severer frosts. One friend of mine, who diligently attends to
this circumstance, assures me, that he never fails of producing a
plentiful crop of excellent fruit.</P>
<P>And it is possible that one use of covering apricot trees, be∣fore
they flower, from the mid-day sun, which is said to be
practised in Denmark, may be to protract their time of flower∣ing,
and thus expose them to less danger from frost, as well as
to prevent their irritability from being exhausted by the heat,
and thus causing the night air to be more injurious to them.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Fruits may be sooner ripened by wounding them, or by gathering them.</HI> The wounds inflicted by insects on many fruits
promotes their more speedy ripening, as well as those in∣flicted
by caprification, mentioned in Sect. XIV. 3. 3. and in
No. 3. 4. of this Section. It is said that cutting the stalk of a
bunch of grapes half through, which has acquired its due size,
will expedite the ripening of it; because it will then be supplied
with a less quantity of new juices, and the change of its acerb
juices into saccharine ones, which is partly a chemical, and
partly a vegetable process, proceeds more rapidly. See Sect. X. 8. 1. On the same account the pears on a branch, which
<PB N="387" REF="392"/>
has had a circle of its bark cut away, will ripen its fruit sooner;
and those annual plants, which are supplied with less water than
usual, both flower sooner, and ripen their seed sooner.</P>
<P>To which may be added, that gathering pears from the tree
before they are ripe, and laying them on heaps covered with
blankets, is known considerably to forward their ripening, by
something like a chemical fermentation added to the living ac∣tion
of the fruit, which advances the saccharine process with
greater rapidity.</P>
<P>I have seen apricots at table, which I was informed were
plucked from the tree, and kept some days in a hot-house, and
thus became deliciously ripe; in the same manner as harsh pears
ripen almost into a syrup during twelve or twenty hours baking
in a slow oven; which occasioned the jest of a French traveller,
who on being asked on his return, what good fruit they had in
England, answered, that the only ripe fruit he happened to taste
was the baked pear.</P>
<P>IV. THE ARTS OF PRESERVING FRUIT, as they depend on
the prevention of the chemical processes, which produce their
dissolution, ought to be here mentioned.</P>
<P>1. As life whether animal or vegetable prevents putrefac∣tion,
and as many fruits exist long, after they are gathered from
the tree, before they become ripe and die spontaneously, and
in consequence putrefy, as crabs, sloes, medlars, and austere
pears. The art of preserving these consists in storing them,
where the heat is neither much above or below 48 degrees,
which is the temperature of the interior parts of the earth; that
is, in a dry cellar, or beneath the soil, or well covered with straw
or mats in a dry chamber. As greater heat might make them
ripen sooner, than they are wanted, by the increased activity
of their vegetable life; and frost by destroying that life would
subject them to putrefy, when they become thawed; as perpetually
happens to apples and potatoes, which are not well de∣fended
from frost. And lastly, the moisture would injure them
many ways; first by its contributing to destroy their vegetable
life; secondly in promoting the chemical process of putrefac∣tion;
and thirdly by its encouraging the growth of mucor, or
<PB N="388" REF="393"/>
mould, which will grow in moist situations without much light or air.</P>
<P>Too great warmth destroys both animal and vegetable life by
stimulating their vessels into too great activity for a time, whence
a subsequent torpor from the too great previous expenditure of
the living power, which terminates in death. After the death
of the organization a boiling heat congulates the mucilaginous
fluids, and if continued would I believe prevent the chemical
fermentation of them; and that thus both vegetable and animal
substances might be preserved. The experiment is difficult to
try, and could not therefore be of much practical utility if it
should succeed.</P>
<P>Great cold on the contrary destroys both animals and vege∣tables
by the torpor occasioned by the defect of stimulus, and a
consequent temporary death. Afterwards if a great degree of
cold be continued, in some cases the expansion of their freezing
juices may burst the vegetable vessels, and thus render the life
of them irrecoverable. But there is another curious thing hap∣pens
to many aqueous solutions, or diffusions, which is, that
at the time of congelation the dissolved or diffused particles are
pushed from the ice, either to the centre, if the cold be applied
equally on all sides, or into various cells, as mentioned in Sect.
XIII. 2. 2.</P>
<P>This exclusion of salt is seen in freezing any saline solution
in water; as common salt or blue vitriol exposed to severe frost
in a two-ounce phial are driven to the centre of it. Wine, vine∣gar,
and even milk, may be thus deprived of much of their
water. Very moist clay, when exposed to frosty air, shrinks
and becomes much more solid according to the assertion of Mr.
Kirwan. Mineralog. Vol. I. p. 9, the freezing water covering
its surface with ice, and driving the molecules of clay nearer the
centre. And lastly, the mucilage produced by boiling wheat
flour in water, like book-binders paste, if not too thick, loses its
cohesion by being frozen, the water driving, as it freezes, the starch from its crystallization; and from this circumstance pro∣bably
is occasioned the change of flavour of apples, potatoes,
and other vegetables, on being thawed after they have been frozen.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="394"/>
It is nevertheless affirmed, I think, by Mons. Reaumeur, that
if frozen apples be dipped in cold water repeatedly, and the ice
thus formed on their surface be wiped off, or if they be left in
a large pail full of very cold water, so that they may not thaw
too hastily, they will not lose their flavour. If this be true,
and the apples will keep sound some time afterwards, it would
seem that the vegetable life was not destroyed; but that, like
sleeping insects, they were reanimated by the warmth; otherwise,
if the flavour be not destroyed, and they could be immediately
eaten or used in cookery, it is still a valuable discovery if true,
and might lead us to preserve variety of fruits in ice-houses, as
strawberries, currants, grapes, and pines, to the great advan∣tage
of society. See Sect. XVII. 2. 4.</P>
<P>As the process of fermentation will not commence or conti∣nue,
I believe, in the heat of boiling water, or 212; and as
this degree of heat can be easily preserved by steam, or by the
vicinity of vessels containing boiling water; it is probable, that
fruits for the use of cookery might be thus preserved throughout
the year, as the pulp of boiled apples, gooseberries, &amp;c. put into
bottles, and placed so as to be exposed to the wasted steam of
steam-engines, or immersed in the hot water, which flows from
the condensing of it; or near the boilers fixed behind some
kitchen fires; as I suspect, that if such a degree of heat could
be applied once a day, it would counteract the tendency to fer∣mentation.</P>
<P>2. Another method of preserving some fruits is by gathering
them during their acid state, before that acid juice is converted
into sugar, as lemons, oranges, gooseberries, pears, and some
apples; and if a part of the water be evaporated by a boiling heat
so as to leave the acidity more concentrated, it is less liable to
ferment, and in consequence will be longer preserved. For this
purpose the fruit should be kept in a cellar, and corked in bottles,
so as to be precluded from the changes of air, and variations of
heat; gooseberries, and rhubarb-stalks, are thus successfully pre∣served
for winter use; and if a tea spoonful of brandy be put
into each quart bottle, it will prevent the growth of mucor or mould upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="395"/>
3. As sugar will not pass into fermentation unless diluted with
much water, and less so in low degrees of heat, many fruits may
be thus preserved by impregnating them with sugar, and the bet∣ter
if they are kept in a dry cellar. Dr. Hales found that by
inverting the end of a branch of a tree into a bottle of brandy
for a few hours, that the whole branch died; hence it is usual
and useful to cover preserved fruits with a paper moistened with
vinous spirit, which prevents the growth of mucor or mould upon
their surfaces, which is a vegetable thus easily killed by the in∣toxicating
stimulus.</P>
<P>If sweet fruits be dried by heat, not only the superfluous water
becomes exhaled, but the saccharine process is also promoted, and
much of the mucilaginous or acid particles are converted into
sugar, as in baking pears, or in drying figs, dates, raisins, apri∣cots;
so that by gradually drying them many fruits may be well
preserved, and require afterwards simply to be kept dry.</P>
<P>4. Some fruits, as the olive, are preserved in their unripe
state in salt and water; the unripe pods of kidney-beans, and
the hats of mushrooms, may be thus also kept for months in
weak brine in a cool cellar enclosed in bottles without much
change. But the oily kernels of nuts are well preserved in
cellars beneath the soil to preclude the variations of heat, and
covered in jars to prevent their evaporation. Other fruits are
converted into pickles and preserved in vinegar, but lose their
flavour; and others by being immersed in vinous spirit are pre∣served,
as cherries, and thus transmuted from food to poison.
And when the kernels of apricots, cherries, or bitter almonds,
are preserved in brandy, which is called ratafia, we possss a
mixture of two of the most poisonous productions of the vegeta∣ble
kingdom; except perhaps the leaves of lauro-cerasus distil∣led
in alcohol, which was sold as ratafia in Dublin, and pro∣duced
many sudden deaths in the gin-shops.</P>

<P>MANY of the circumstances above related concerning the
production and enlargement of fruit are applicable to the produc∣tion
of the seeds, which are included in them; but those seeds,
which contribute most to the nourishment of mankind, many of
which are the progeny of annual or biennial plants, require other
modes of cultivation.</P>
<P>As an introduction to this section it may be observed, how
much more ingenuity was required in the discovery of nourish∣ing
mankind by the small seeds of the grasses, which have pro∣bably
been since much enlarged by perpetual cultivation, than by
the large roots of potatoes. The Isis or Osiris of Egypt seems
to have invented the process of cultivating wheat, as well as
flax, on the banks of the Nile; and afterwards Ceres and Trip∣tolemus
to have taught the former of these important discoveries
all over the known world. While in later ages the Incas or
Motezumas of Peru and Mexico seem to have destroyed the
cannibals, or men-eaters, of that continent, and to have desco∣vered
and taught their people to support themselves by the cul∣tivation
of potatoes.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>I. 1. To produce seeds early in the season.</HEAD>
<P>Those plants, which are required to yield a forward crop, as
the peas and beans of our gardens, and those which our cold
and short summers will not otherwise perfectly ripen, as wheat,
should be sowed before the commencement of winter, either in
<PB N="395" REF="400"/>
natural ground, as in the cultivation of wheat, or in situations
sheltered from the north-east, as in the garden cultivation of peas
and beans; or they may be sowed very thick in hot-houses, or
under hot-bed frames, or under warm walls, and be transplant∣ed,
when they are one or two inches high, into the natural
ground at due distances, when the weather is milder, and the
plants are become hardier or less liable to be destroyed from
their having longer acquired the habits of life.</P>
<P>When young plants of any kind are transplanted, the ground
should be recently dug, as their expeditious growth depends so
much on the atmospheric air being buried in the pores or inter∣stices
of the earth by the production of carbonic and nitrous
acids, and ammonia, and heat.</P>
<P>The same advantage occurs by soaking seeds in water, or in
the drainage from manure heaps, till they are ready to sprout,
and then sowing them in a soil lately turned over; as their roots
will then immediately put out by the newly generated heat, and
newly produced carbonic acid in its fluid not its gasseous state.</P>
<P>2. The transplanting of young roots, if they be set no deeper
than before, does not, I suppose, multiply the number of stems,
as occurs when wheat is transplanted so deep as to cover the
second joint; but by tearing off several small extremities of the
roots, the new production of many viviparous buds is prevented,
and that of oviparous buds increased in consequence, for reasons
mentioned in No. 2. 4. of the preceding Section.</P>
<P>When the roots of wheat are transplanted and divided, not
only a great increase of the crop is produced, but I believe the
seed is likewise ripened earlier, as is asserted by Mr. Bogle.
Bath Society, Vol. III. p. 494. And it is well known to
gardeners, that transplanting garden-beans forwards them in
respect to time, but shortens the height of the stem. Hence
transplanted vegetables grow less in height, as transplanted
beans, and less branchy, as transplanted melons, but produce
and ripen their seeds earlier; which is a great advantage in the
short summers of this climate; and if the roots can be divided,
as in wheat, or new scions can be produced by their being trans∣planted
deeper, as also occurs in wheat, the quantity of the
<PB N="396" REF="401"/>
seed may also be wonderfully increased by transplanting. See
Sect XII. 6.</P>
<P>3. Another mode of forwarding the production of seeds,
and of sooner ripening them, consists in pruning off the vivipa∣rous
tops or lateral shoots, which will bear no seeds at all, or
only small or imperfect ones, in our northern summers. For
this purpose the cutting away the tops of beans and of peas, and
the lateral branches of artichokes, after the fruit-buds are form∣ed,
both forwards and enlarges the flowers and seeds, which
remain, as more nourishment is derived to them.</P>
<P>4. As a superfluous supply of water is more friendly to the
production of leaf-buds than to the generation of flower-buds, to
derive less water than usual to the roots, forwards the produc∣tion
of seeds, a fact well known in the gardens of warmer cli∣mates,
which are perpetually watered from reservoirs or wheel-engines.
But when the blossoms appear, an addition of water
must forward their growth by supplying nourishment, which
should again be lessened when the fruit has acquired its full
size, both to expedite its ripening, and to increase its flavour; as
the saccharine matter and essential oil will be less diluted with
water.</P>
<P>In the dry summer of 1799 I had the opportunity of flooding
some rows of beans in my garden, which by being done too
frequently, or too copiously, occasioned them to grow to a
much greater height than usual, and in consequence to bring to
perfection few seeds, and some of them none. As I suppose
the new shoots of fig-trees in the beginning of summer occasions
the first production of young figs to fall off from the want of
that nourishment, which is now expended in the growth of
new leaf-buds. See Sect. XV. 3. 4. Whence the facility of pro∣ducing
leaf-buds seems evidently to prevent the generation of
flower-buds, and the use of cutting off the summits of tall beans
is thus explained, as directed above.</P>
<P>II. 1. <HI>To produce seeds in great quantity</HI> from annual or
biennial plants they should be brought forward in respect to the
season in our northern summers; that a greater quantity of vivi∣parous
buds may arrive early at their maturity for the purpose
of generating oviparous buds soon enough in the summer to
<PB N="397" REF="402"/>
ripen their seeds; on this account those should be sown in the
autumn which will bear the severity of the winter.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the seeds of those plants, which are natives of
this climate, should probably be sowed at the time they become
perfectly ripe, as occurs to them in their natural state; that is,
either when the seed is shed upon the ground by the parent
plant, or when the fruit or husk, which encloses it, becomes naturally ripe after it has fallen on the ground. Thus I have
seen crabs covered with leaves in hedge-bottoms, which have not
decayed till the early spring. Many pears do not become ripe
in our store-rooms till March or April; and ivy berries and
holly berries hang on their respective trees till the vernal months,
and are not till that time eaten by the thrushes. Hence it is
probable, that the seeds in these durable fruits or berries continue
to ripen, or to become more mature, and prepared for their
future growth during the winter months.</P>
<P>2. It was shewn in Sect. IX. 3. 7. that when wheat was transplanted so deep as to immerse the first joint about the root
into the soil, many new stems would shoot up and strike their
roots into the earth; and that thus four or six new plants, or
more, would be generated by the caudex of the leaf-bud, which
constitutes that joint. This mode of transplant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion therefore
will much increase the quantity of the crop of seed, if it can
be done soon enough for these additional stems to ripen their
corn, before the summer ends.</P>
<P>There is another mode of increasing this product of additional
stems without transplantation, which consists in sowing the
wheat in rows by what is called a drill-plough according to Mr.
Tull's method; and when the first stems rise a few inches high,
a horse-hoe, made like a very small plough, is to be brought so
near each row, as to turn up some earth against the stems, so
as to cover the first joint above the root with soil; whence new
stems will be generated, and shoot up round the old one; and
thus increase the crop in the same manner as by deep transplan∣tation.</P>
<P>The theory of Mr. Tull's drill husbandry is explained in
Sect. IX. 3. 7. and in XII. 5. which is of late years supposed
to have been improved by introducing the hand-hoe in place of
<PB N="398" REF="403"/>
the horse-hoe, and thus giving an opportunity of sowing the
rows or drills nearer together, as will be seen by the following
method, now introduced into almost general use in Norsolk by
Mr. Coke; though Mr. Tull himself much prefers the horse-hoe
as turning over the earth much deeper than the hand-hoe,
and thus rendering that part of it more exposed to the air, which
was before more deeply s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cluded from it; and also rendering it
more pervious to vegetable roots; to which may be added, that
both kinds of hoeing render the surface more permeable to the
rains and dews, and prevent the cracks in dry weather, which are
very injurious to the roots of plants; both which advantages
depend on the porosity of the soil, which must extend deeper
by the use of the horse-hoe than the hand-hoe.</P>
<P>Mr Tull makes other ingenious remarks on the use of horse-hoeing.
In the beginning of winter, when the wheat has ob∣tained
one blade like grass, or two or three leaves, the horse-hoe
is brought near the rows and deep, and the earth turned
from them so as to form a ridge between them. By this ridge
in level grounds he thinks the rows are shaded from the cold
winds in some situations, and that the roots of the wheat are
kept drier, and thence less injured by frosts. In the spring
this ridge in the intervals between the rows is divided by the
horse-hoe, and turned back against the rows of corn after it has
been fertilized by the air and rains, and dews of winter. See
Tull's husbandry, Ch. IX and Sect. XII. 5. of this work.</P>
<P>Mr. Coke of Holkham in Norfolk, assured me, that in thir∣teen
years experience on a farm of 3000 acres he had found the
drill husbandry in that country greatly superior to sowing seeds
of all sorts by the hand in what is termed the broad-cast method,
but differs in the number and arrangement of his rows from the
method of Mr. Tull in the following circumstances.</P>
<P>Mr. Tull drilled two rows of seed a few inches from each
other, and then left a space of two or three feet, and then drill∣led
two more rows near each other, for the purpose of passing
a hoe between each double row drawn by a horse, which was
therefore termed a horse-hoe; but Mr. Coke drills all his rows
of wheat and of peas nine inches from each other, and those of
barley six inches and three qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rters from each other; this is
<PB N="399" REF="404"/>
performed by a drill plough made by the Rev. Mr. Cook, which
drills six rows at a time, and thus sows an acre of land in an
hour, and is drawn by a single horse; and the quantity of seed
consumed is about six or seven pecks to an acre, which is about
half what is used in the sowing by the hand in the broad-cast
method.</P>
<P>Early in March Mr. Coke uses the hand-hoe, which for hoeing
the rows of wheat and of peas is about six inches wide, and for
hoeing those of barley about four inches wide. By this hoe the
surface is not only turned over, and the weeds between the rows
rooted up, but it is also accumulated about the roots of the grow∣ing
corn, and covers and consequently destroys the low growth of
poppies amongst them; which are a very frequent weed in that
part of the country. A second hoeing is performed about the
middle of May, and the soil is again not only cleared from weeds
but accumulated against the rising corn, each of which hoeings
cost about twenty-pence an acre.</P>
<P>Nevertheless I am informed, that some attentive agricultors
use the horse-hoe belonging to Mr. Cook's drill-machine, though
the rows of corn are but nine inches from each other; and assert,
that this occasional trampling of the horse on the young plants is
of no very ill consequence, a circumstance well worth observing,
as it removes the principal disadvantage of the horse-hoe, which
consists in the too great distance of the alternate rows of the
corn-plants.</P>
<P>By the earth being thus accumulated against the roots of the
corn it is said to tiller or tellure much; that is, to throw out four
or six stems, or more, around the original stem, and thus to in∣crease
the number of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars like transplanting the roots, insomuch
that Mr. Coke obtains by this method between four and five quar∣ters
of wheat on every acre, which in the broad-cast method of
sowing did not yield more than three quarters on an acre, beside
saving a strike and half of the seed corn, unnecessarily consumed
in the broad-cast method of sowing. To this should be added
another advantage, that as the land is thus kept clear from weeds,
and has its surface twice turned over, and thus exposed to the air,
it is found to save one ploughing for the purpose of a succeeding
crop of turnips.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="405"/>
It is probable, that one hand-hoeing in the beginning of winter, so managed as to turn the soil from the roots of the corn, and to
leave it rather elevated between the rows, as Mr. Tull recommends
to be performed by his horse-hoe, might give a similar advantage
to this mode of cultivation; and also if another hand-hoeing was
applied, as soon as the wheat is out of blossom, to supply more
nourishment to the young seed might increase its plumpness and
weight, as mentioned in No. 2. 3. of this Section.</P>
<P>The lands thus managed by Mr. Coke are laid level, and not
in ridges and furrows, and can thus be ploughed crosswise; and
the crop is equally good throughout the whole; whereas in the
furrows of some lands it is less forward or less prolific than on the
ridges; whence much light corn is mixed with the good, which
is obliged to be separated from that, which is marketable, and
used for hogs or poultry. Add to this, that in this mode of
husbandry the straw is believed to be larger and in greater quan∣tity
as well as the grain, and the land to be less impoverished, as
no weeds are suffered to grow on it, and as its surface is so fre∣quently
turned over, and exposed to the air.</P>
<P>In China the corn lands are laid on a level, not in ridges and
furrows; which is supposed to be the most advantageous plan in
almost every situation, which is proper for the cultivation of corn,
as by being thus rendered capable of being divided by cross-ploughing,
almost any kind of soil may be rendered more proper
for the use of the drill husbandry, by which it is seen in the above
account of the Norfolk management, that twelve strikes more of
wheat are raised on an acre, and one strike and a half saved in the
consumption of seed-wheat, which at six shilling a strike arises to
a considerable sum on a large farm.</P>
<P>Nevertheless there seem to be many advantages attending the
forming the surface of land into ridges and furrows; in wet lands
with a substratum of clay the furrows are convenient channels to
carry off the water, where there is a sufficient declivity, as treated
of by Mr. Tull in his Horse-hoeing Husbandry, Ch. XVI.
Add to this, that in some situations a deeper stratum of the soil,
where it is valuable, may be occasionally turned up, and exposed
to the air, and to the roots of vegetables, by gradually changing
the locality of the ridges; and lastly, in every situation a greater
<PB N="401" REF="406"/>
surface both of the soil, and of the summits of the stems, or ears,
are exposed to the influence of the air by means of ridges and
furrows; for as the plants of wheat are but three or four feet
high, the surface of a crop of wheat is increased as well as the
surface of the ground it grows upon, and not as the base on which
the declivities or hills rest, as some have erroneously supposed.
See Sect. X. 3. 8.</P>
<P>There is another method of sowing wheat in rows used in some
countries, which is termed dibbling in the language of agricultors,
and consists in making perpendicular holes one inch and half or
two inches deep, as is commonly done in planting potatoe-roots;
these holes are made by a man, who has a proper staff
shod with iron in each hand, and as he walks backwards is able
by looking at the part of the row already made to keep nearly in
a straight line, and to make two holes at once at about nine inches
distant from each other every way. Two or more children at∣tend
the man, and drop two, or three, or four seeds into each
perpendicular hole, which are afterwards covered by drawing
over them what is called a bush-harrow.</P>
<P>This method by sowing the wheat in rows adapts it for the use
of the hand-hoe, as by sowing it by a drill machine, but must be
attended with greater expence, and I suspect with less accuracy of
the distribution of the seed, owing to the hurry or fatigue of the
children employed; and I also suspect that sowing in drills is pre∣ferable,
because a greater quantity of earth is turned over, and
much air in consequence included in its interstices; whereas in
making perpendicular holes the sides of the holes are compressed,
and rendered more solid; whence potatoe-roots also might pro∣bably
be more advantageously planted by making drills instead of
perpendicular holes.</P>
<P>A correspondent of die board of agriculture asserts, that on
looking over a field of potatoes near Leicester, which had all
been planted at the same time, and on land equally manured,
he observed a great difference of the growth of one part of the
field, which on enquiry he found to have been owing to the roots
having been planted in drills, where the plants were so much
stronger; and by a setting stick in holes, where they were so
muchless vigorous; English Encyclopedia, Art. Husbandry, p.
<PB N="402" REF="407"/>
483: which difference of growth I suppose to have been owing
to the circumstances above mentioned.</P>
<P>A few ears of wheat were lately given me, which were branch∣ed,
having four or five less ears growing out of each side of the
principal ear; it was procured at Liverpool, and was called
Egyptian wheat, or Smyrna wheat. It is described in the Sup∣plem.
Plantarum of the younger Linneus, as well as in the spe∣cies
Plantarum of the elder; and is said to be a native of Egypt,
and to be cultivated at Naples; it is called “triticum compositum,
or wheat with a compound ear, crowded with less cars, awned;
and is said to be related to triticum aestivum, summer wheat; but
the spike is four times larger, a hand in length, composed of less
spikes, two faced, alternate, approximated, from nine to twelve,
the lower ones being shorter, and the top one solitary.” Suppl.
Plant. p. 115.</P>
<P>The plant, which was given me, had five tall and thick stems
from one root, but seemed to have been plucked up before it was
quite ripe, whence I cannot judge of the size of the grain, but
should imagine, that it is a species well worthy of attention. The
few ears, which I possessed, were sown in the spring of this year,
1799, not having obtained them soon enough to sow in the
autumn. When they were an inch or two high, they were
transplanted into a moistish part of my garden; and though the
year has been uncommonly cold and wet, and a great part of the
autumn-sown wheat of this country is blown down upon the
ground, and is not yet ripe, yet almost every root of the Egyptian
wheat has from ten to twelve stems, and stands upright on strong
straw about three and a half, or four feet high. The best stems
have one principal ear about five inches long, with five or six
shorter ones branching out on each side of it. They begin to ap∣pear
brown, and I hope will ripen. I have since found that this
species of wheat is mentioned in Tull's Husbandry under the
name of Smyrna wheat. He adds that it is highly productive,
but on that account requires a good soil.</P>
<P>3. Another method of promoting the growth of lateral stems
consists in destroying the central shoot; when this is done, other
new stems arise from the joint immediately above the root, which
in wheat is in contact with the earth. On this account, when
<PB N="403" REF="408"/>
wheat plants are sufficiently forward in respect to the season, it is
thought to be advantageous to eat the first stem down by sheep to
increase the quantity of the subsequent crop. See Sect. IX. 3. 7.
It should be nevertheless observed here, that the trampling of
the sheep on lands, which are not too adhesive, will press down
the first or second joint into the earth, and thus assist the pro∣duction
of many side shoots. But in very adhesive soils this
trampling of the stems into the ground may be injurious. See a
paper in Bath Agriculture, Vol. I. Art. XV. In soils which
are not too adhesive, when the crop appears thin, it is probable,
that a roller drawn over it by pressing the first or second joint into the
soil, might promote the production of side shoots, or make
them tiller, or tellure, in the language of agricultors. And
when grass or clover seeds are designed to be sown on the wheat-land,
it might first be harrowed, and then either rolled or
trampled by the sheep, which eat it; either or both of which
might press down the root-stems of the corn, and cover the
newly sown clover-seeds with soil.</P>
<P>This mode of eating down forward wheat with sheep is analo∣gous
to cutting off the central buds of melons and cucumbers to
make them produce earlier fruit, and in this climate perhaps in
greater quantity; as those produced after the great extent and
elongation of the central branches would be too late to ripen in
this climate: and by their exuberant generation of a viviparous
progeny would retard the succession of lateral shoots, and a con∣sequent
quicker production of flowers.</P>
<P>Nevertheless where the crop is not too luxuriant or too for∣ward,
the eating down the first stem by sheep may be an injurious
practice; as Mr. Tull thinks, that by thus destroying the first
stem, the ears of the latter ones have not time to ripen, and thence
becoming light in respect to the size or plumpness of the grain;
and that these secondary stems become weak, and are liable to
fall down, both which he says commonly occur where the crops
are eated by sheep.</P>
<P>Mr. Tull, whose work is throughout a great effort of human
genius, adds a very wise axiom, “that it is most advantageous to
hasten, what we can, the time of blossoming; and to protract
the time of ripening.” Horse-hoeing Husbandry, Ch. XI. p.
<PB N="404" REF="409"/>
147; for it is the farinaceous reservoir of nutriment laid up in
the cotyledon of the new seed for the future growth of the cor∣culum
or new embryon, for which we cultivate the plant; and
this reservoir is formed between the blossoming and ripening of
the grain, either before or after the impregnation of the pericarp,
or seed-vessels, and thus renders the grain plump and heavy. Mr.
Tull in another part of his work recommends an additional horse-hoeing
immediately after the blossom it over, to supply more nu∣triment
to the ripening grain. Ch. IX. p. 120. Mr. Tull es∣teems
the eating down of wheat by sheep to be generally a very
injurious practice in this climate, by rendering the ears light and
the straw weak; by retarding the time of blossoming, as well as
the growth of the stems.</P>
<P>4. In the moist springs of this climate many annual or biennial
plants are liable to shoot out too many or too strong viviparous
branches, which can not generate flower-buds soon enough to ri∣pen
their seeds in our cold and short summers. This always hap∣pens
to cucumbers and melons, which were brought from warmer
countries, and to the peas and beans of our gardens, and some∣times
to corn plants, which are liable in wet seasons to produce
too strong stems and foliage, which have not time to generate the
flower-bud at their summit soon enough to perfect and to ripen the
seed. Melons and cucumbers have been mentioned in Sect. XV.
2. 5. and in respect to garden beans their viviparous tops should
be pinched off, which if not too old may be eaten as an agreea∣ble
vegetable▪ when well boiled; and thus more nutriment is de∣rived
to the oviparous buds beneath, which renders them larger,
and perhaps more numerous. To prevent field peas from running
into straw in moist soils less manure should be used; and field
beans may have their tops cut off by a scythe fixed into a straight
shaft.</P>
<P>Annual cotton plants are much cultivated in some colder parts
of the Chinese empire, and the cultivators lop off the tops to in∣crease
the number of pods, and to hasten their production; and
in the West Indies the flowers of the rose tree are believed to be
accelerated and increased by topping the branches. Embassy to
China by sir G. Staunton, Vol. III. p. 202. 8vo. edit.</P>
<P>When the stems and foliage of wheat are thus too vigorous, it
may be advantageous to eat it down by sheep as above mentioned;
which may not only destroy the too▪ vigorous viviparous central
<PB N="405" REF="410"/>
stems, but also produce a greater number of lateral ones; which
may sooner terminate in oviparous ones, so as to produce more
grain with less straw.</P>
<P>5. It is also probable, that rolling them as mentioned above, if
it be done in a morning before the dew is off, might so far bruise
the stems and roots, as to stop their too great propensity to nou∣rish
the viviparous buds, and in consequence to favour the growth
of the oviparous buds on their summits; which might forward
the harvest season, as well as increase the product of grain in
proportion to the quantity of straw. From rolling wheat in spring
on fields where the surface remains uneven or cloddy, another ad∣vantage
may be derived, by breaking the clods or eminences, and
thus earthing up many of the stems above the second joint, and
thus inducing a new set of root-scions to put forth, or tiller. See
Sect. XII. 3.</P>
<P>6. The garden plants, which are too vigorous, in situations
where there is a command of water, as in the gardens of warm
climates, should have less water derived to them, till the blossoms
appear; because a greater quantity of moisture facilitates the pro∣duction
of viviparous buds so much as to retard that of oviparous
ones, and thus diminishes the quantity as well as retards the ri∣pening
of the crop. But in these situations, as soon as the blos∣soms
appear, a greater supply of water should be allowed, which
will contribute to nourish and enlarge them, as mentioned above;
as is practised in some countries of the east, where they do not
flood their rice-grounds, till they are in slower. See Sect. XV.
3. 4. But less water is again required, when the seed has arr∣ived
at its full size, as before spoken of.</P>
<P>III. 1. <HI>To forward the ripening of seeds.</HI> A due degree of
warmth and of dryness seems to include the circumstances prin∣cipally
required. The warmth not only accelerates the various
secretions of vegetables by increasing their irritability and cons∣equent
activity, but, after the mucilaginous, starchy, saccharine,
and oily matters are secreted into proper reservoirs, may contri∣bute
perhaps chemically to their change into each other, or to
their greater perfection. And the dryness of the air, whether
hot or cold, is necessary to give perfect ripeness to seeds; as
otherwise the due exhalation of the aqueous parts of the secreted
<PB N="406" REF="411"/>
fluids, which form the nutritive parts of seeds, does not properly
proceed; and the seed gathered in this condition is liable to mil∣dew
in the barn or granary, or to become shrivelled and wrinkled,
as it dries.</P>
<P>2. It is believed in Scotland, that even the frosty nights of
autumn contribute to ripen the late corps in that inclement cli∣mate,
which some have ascribed to the moonlight, but, which I
have indeed suspected, that the frost may in some measure effect
by converting the mucilage of the grain sooner into starch. This
I was induced to imagine by having observed that bookbinder's
paste, made by boiling wheat-flour in water, lost its adhesion af∣ter
having been frozen; and also from a culinary observation,
that when ice or snow is mingled with flour instead of water in
making pancakes, that it much improves them; the truth of
which I have heard boldly asserted, but never witnessed the expe∣riment.
See Sect. VI. 3. 3.</P>
<P>There is nevertheless an experiment related by Dr. Roebuck
in the Edinburgh Transactions, Vol. I. which seems to shew,
that the grains of oats continue to fill and to become heavier even
during the autumnal frosts; which may probably occur during the
sunshine of the middle part of the day, as occurs in the vernal
frosts of this part of the country. In 1780 near Borrowstoness
the oats were green even in October, when the ice was three-fourths
of an inch thick. He selected several stalks of oats of
nearly equal fulness, cut half of them, and marked the remain∣der,
which continued fourteen days longer in the field; after be∣ing
dry, the grains of each parcel were weighed; and eleven of
those grains, which had remained in the field, weighed thirty of
those which had been cut a fortnight sooner.</P>
<P>This important experiment should teach our farmers not to cut
their peas and beans too early in inclement autumns; which
are so frequently seen to become shrunk and shrivelled in the barn
or granary, and inclined to rot from deficient ripeness, and con∣sequent
softness or moisture; and thus contain much less flour in
proportion to the husk or bran.</P>
<P>3. The wheat produced after land has been much limed, is
believed to be thinner skinned, and to yield more good meal,
than other wheat, and to make better bread. See Sect. X. 6. 7.
<PB N="407" REF="412"/>
On this account I suppose one use of lime is to forward the ri∣pening
of seeds by converting their mucilage sooner into starch or
oil; as according to the experiments of M. Permentier the
goodness of bread depends much on the quantity of starch con∣tained
in it; who found, that if the starch taken from eight
pounds of raw potatoes, by grating them into cold water, was
mixed with eight pounds of boiled potatoes, as good bread might
be produced as from wheat flour. See Sect. VI. 3.</P>
<P>4. The seeds of some plants, which also propagate themselves
by bulbs at their roots, will not ripen in this climate naturally, as
the orchis; but are said to ripen, if the new bulb be cut off early
in the season; or if the propagation by their roots be retarded or
prevented by consining them in garden-pots, as the lily of the
valley; and it is probable, that the seeds of potatoes might be
rendered more perfectly ripe, and in consequence better for the
cultivation of new varieties; if the young roots were taken away
early in the season from that, which is to bear seed; or if they
were confined in garden pots.</P>
<P>If the orchis could by these means be cultivated from seed on
moist meadows or morasses, it might become a profitable article
of husbandry; as when it is scalded in boiling water, and the
peel rubbed off, it is sold by the name of salep, and might become
a nutritive article of diet, like sago and vermicelli, if it could
be propagated at less expence.</P>
<P>It is also probable, that Jerusalem, or ground artichokes, he∣lianthus
tuberosus, might be induced to ripen its seeds in this
country, if the new roots from a few of the forwardest plants
were taken away early in the season, or if they were confined in
garden pots. And if this plant could be propagated by seed, it
might make an useful product in agriculture, as horses are very
fond of the leaves, and swine of the roots; both of which are
produced in great quantity; and as the latter contain much sugar,
they must be very nutritive; and in respect to their culinary use
are remarkably grateful to moist palates, as well as nutritive,
when cut into slices, and baked in beef or mutton pies; but are
said to be flatulent in the bowels of those whose digestion is not
very powerful; a property which might be worthy attention,
<PB N="408" REF="413"/>
where the propensity to fermentation is required, as in making
bread with potatoes, or in the distillery.</P>
<P>It is also probable, that if the large new root-suckers of other
perennial plants, which do not bear bulbous or tuberous roots, and
which are late in ripening their seeds, or do not ripen them per∣fectly
in this climate, were cut or torn off early in the season, as
of the rheum palmatum, palmated rhubarb, or rheum hybridum,
male rhubarb; or if their roots were confined in garden-pots, that
they might be more liable completely to ripen their respective
seeds. See Sect. XV. 2. 4.</P>
<P>IV. 1. <HI>To generate the best <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of seeds</HI> the most healthy
plants must be chosen, and those which are most early in respect
to the season; these should be so insulated, as to have no weak
plants of the same species, or even genus, in their vicinity, lest
the fecundating dust of weaker plants should be blown by the
winds upon the stigmata of the stronger, and thus produce a less
vigorous progeny.</P>
<P>Where new varieties are required, the male dust of one good
variety, as of the nonp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>il apple, should he shed upon the stig∣mas
of another good variety, as of the golden-pippin; and it is
probable some new excellent variety might be thus generated.</P>
<P>Mr. Knight has given a curious experiment of his impregnat∣ing
the stigmas of the pea-blossoms of one variety with the farina
of another. He says, Treatise of Apple and Pear, p. 42,
“Blossoms of a small white garden-pea, in which the males had
previously been destroyed, were impregnated with the farina of a
large clay-coloured kind with purple blossoms. The produce of
the seeds thus obtained were of a dark grey colour, but these
having no fixed habits, were soon changed by cultivation into a
numerous variety of very large and extremely luxuriant white
ones; which were not only much larger and more productive than
the original white ones, but the number of seeds in each pod was
increased from seven or eight to eight or nine, and not unfre∣quently
to ten. The newly made grey kinds I found were easily
made white again by impregnating their blossoms with the farina of
another white kind. In this experiment the seeds, which grew
towards the point of the pod, and were by position first exposed
to the action of the male, would sometimes produce seeds like it
<PB N="409" REF="414"/>
in colour, whilst those at the other end would follow the female.</P>
<P>“In other instances the whole produce of the pod would take
the colour of one or other of the parents; and I had once an in∣stance
in which two peas at one end of a pod produced white seeds
like the male, two at the other end grey ones like the female, and
the central seeds took the intermediate shade, a clay colour.
Something very similar appears to take place in animals, which
produce many young ones at a birth, when the male and female are
of opposite colours. From some very imperfect experiments I
have made, I am led to suspect that considerable advantages would
be found to arise from the use of new or regenerated varieties of
wheat, and these are easily obtained, as this plant readily sports in
varieties, whenever different kinds are sown together.” See
Sect. VII. 2. 6. of this work.</P>
<P>2. The white and blue peas sown in fields as well as in gardens
sometimes possess the property of becoming soft by boiling, at
other times not. This circumstance is said to depend on the na∣ture
of the soil, but has not yet been sufficiently investigated;
perhaps the greater or less maturity of the peas at the time of
reaping them may have more or less contributed to sill their
fibrous cells or divisions with mucilage or starch. The greater or
less mealiness produced by boiling potatoes seems to be an analo∣gous
circumstance, and is thought by some to arise from the na∣ture
of the soil rather than from the species or variety of the
planted root.</P>
<P>The mealiness of some boiled potatoes, and the softness of
some boiled peas, may occasionally be affected by the acidity of
the spring water, in which they are boiled; but is generally I
suppose owing to the mucilage of some of them being more or
less coagulable by heat, than that of others. Something similar
to which obtains in animal mucus, as the crystalline humour of
the eyes of fish become hard and opake by boiling; while the
skins of animals, and the tendons of their feet, become a soft
mucus or jelly by boiling; and some of the liquids, which are
found in the cells or cavities of the body in dropsies, are observ∣ed
to coagulate by heat, and others to become more fluid. The
causes of this difference merits further enquiry.</P>
<P>V. 1. <HI>To collect good seeds,</HI> according to the observations of
Mr. Cooper of Philadelphia, consists not in procuring new seeds
<PB N="410" REF="415"/>
from distant places, as is generally supposed, but in selecting the
best seeds and roots of his own; which though he has continually
sown or planted them in the same soil, every article of his produce
is greatly superior to those of any other person, who supplies the
market, and they seem still in a state of improvement. He be∣lieved
that no kind of incest would degenerate the breeds of ve∣getables,
and therefore adopted the plan of Mr. Bakewell in Eng∣land
in respect to quadrupeds, who continued to improve his flocks
and herds by the marriages of those, in which the properties he
wished to produce were most conspicuous without regard to con∣sanguinity
or incest.</P>
<P>Mr. Cooper was led to his present practice, which he began
more than forty years ago, by observing that vegetables of all
kinds were very subject to change with respect to their time of
coming to maturity, and other properties, but that the best seeds
never failed to produce the best plants. Among a great num∣ber
of experiments he particularly mentions the following.</P>
<P>“About the year 1746 his father procured seeds of the
long watery squash, and though they have been used on the
farm ever since that time without any change, they are at this
time better than they were at the first.”</P>
<P>“His early peas were procured from London in the year 1756,
and though they have been planted on the same place
every season, they have been so far from degenerating, that they
are preferable to what they were then. The seeds of his aspa∣ragus
he had from New York in 1752, and though they have
been planted in the same manner, the plants are greatly im∣proved.”</P>
<P>“It is more particularly complained of, that potatoes dege∣nerate,
when they are planted from the same roots in the same
place. At this Mr. Cooper says, he does not wonder, when it
is customary with farmers to sell or consume the best, and to
plant from the refuse; whereas having observed that some of his
plants produced potatoes, that were larger, better shaped, and
in greater abundance than others, he took his roots from them
only; and the next season he found, that the produce was of
a quality superior to any, that he had ever had before. This
<PB N="411" REF="416"/>
practice he still continues, and finds that he is abundantly re∣warded
for his trouble.”</P>
<P>“Mr. Cooper is also careful to sow the plants, from which
he raises his seed, at a considerable distance from any others.
Thus, when his radishes are fit for use, he takes ten or twelve,
that he most approves, and plants them at least one hundred
yards from othesr, that blossom at the same time. In the same
manner he treats all his other plants, varying the circumstances
according to their nature.”</P>
<P>“About the year 1772 a friend of his sent him a few grains
of a small kind of Indian corn, not larger than goose shot, which
produced from eight to ten ears on a stalk. They were also
small, and he found, that few of them ripened before the frost.
Some of the largest and earliest he saved, and planted them be∣tween
rows of a larger and earlier kind, and the produce was
much improved. He then planted from those that had pro∣duced
the greatest number of the largest ears, and that were the
first ripe, and the next season the produce with respect to qua∣lity
and quantity was preferable to any, that he had ever planted
before.”</P>
<P>“The common method of saving seed-corn by taking the
ears from the heap is attended, he says, with two disadvanta∣ges;
one is the taking the largest ears, of which in general only
one grows on a stalk, which lessens the produce; and the other
is taking ears that ripen at different times.”</P>
<P>“Many years ago Mr. Cooper renewed all the seed of his
winter grain from a single plant, which he had observed to be
more productive, and of a better quality than the rest; which
he is satisfied has been of great use. And he is of opinion,
that all kinds of garden vegetables may be improved by the me∣thods
described above, particular care being taken that different
kinds of the same vegetables do not bloom at the same time
near together; since by this means they injure one another.”
Communications to the Board of Agriculture, Vol. I. part 3.
Letter from Dr. Priestley.</P>
<P>2. As the varieties of plants are believed to be produced by
different soils and climates, which varieties will afterwards con∣tinue
through many generations, even when the plants are re∣moved
<PB N="412" REF="417"/>
to other soils and climates, it must be advantageous for
the agricultor to inspect other crops as well as his own; and
thus wherever he can find a superior vegetation to collect seeds
from it; which is more certain to improve his crops than an
indiscriminate change of seed.</P>
<P>But where seed-corn is purchased without a previous observa∣tion
of its superior excellence, perhaps it would be more advan∣tageous
to take that from better kinds of soil, and from somewhat
better climates; as the good habits acquired by such seeds may
be continued long after their removal to inferior situations. And
on the contrary, care should be taken not to collect a change of
seeds from worse climates or inferior soils, unless the agricultor
is previously certain that they are of a superior kind.</P>
<P>VI. 1 <HI>To determine the goodness of seeds,</HI> the weighing a
given measure of them may generally be esteemed a criterion;
as it is known, that when seeds are put into cold water, those
which are less perfect are liable to swim, and the sound ones
to sink; thus the imperfect seeds of rye-grass and of clover
may be detected by throwing a spoonful of them into water;
but the seeds of rye-grass are said to be frequently adulterated
by a mixture of the seeds of twitch or dog's grass, which can
only be discovered by an experienced eye. This even is said
to be a test of the goodness of malt; as those grains, which are
not perfectly germinated, will swim with one end upwards, I
suppose the root end; and those which are perfectly germinated
swim on their side, whilst the sound ungerminated barley sinks
in water.</P>
<P>It is therefore a proper criterion of good seed-wheat to cast
it into salt and water, just so saline as to float an egg; as the
more salt is dissolved in the water, the heavier it becomes; and
hence none but quite sound grains of wheat will sink in this
brine; and that which swims is properly rejected. This rejec∣tion
of the light grains by steeping wheat in brine is probably
of greater consequence to the easuing crop, than the adhesion
of any salt to the grain, which has been believed to destroy the
eggs of infects supposed to adhere to it, or to fertilize the
soil.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="418"/>
2. The weight of a given measure of corn will also with con∣siderable
certainty discover the quantity of husk or bran contain∣ed
in it, compared to the quantity of flour; as that grain, which
is cut too early, or which is otherwise not quite ripe, as hap∣pens
in wet seasons, shrinks in the barn or granary, and becomes
wrinkled, and has thus a greater proportion of skin or bran,
than that which has been more perfectly ripened, and will hence
weigh lighter in proportion.</P>
<P>A test of this kind may enable us to determine whether peas
and beans, or oats, are preferable in respect to economy as pro∣vender
for horses. A strike or bushel of oats weighs perhaps
forty pounds, and a strike or bushel of peas and beans perhaps
sixty pounds; and as the skin of peas and beans is much less in
quantity than that of oats, I suppose there may be at least fifteen
pounds of flour more in a strike of peas and beans than in a strike
of oats. There is also reason to believe, that the flour of
beans is more nutritive than that of oats, as appears in the fat∣tening
of hogs; whence according to the respective prices of these
two articles I suspect, that peas and beans generally supply a
cheaper provender for horses than oats, as well as for other
domestic animals.</P>
<P>But as the flour of peas and beans is more oily, I believe,
than that of oats, it may in general be somewhat more difficult
of digestion; hence when a horse has taken a stomach full of
peas and beans alone, he may be less active for an hour or two,
as his strength will be more employed in the digestion of them,
than when he has taken a stomach full of oats. According to
the experiment of a German physician, who gave to two dogs,
which had been kept a day fasting, a large quantity of flesh-food;
and then taking one of them into the fields hunted him with
great activity for three or four hours, and left the other by the
fire. An emetic was then given to each of them, and the food
of the sleeping dog was found perfectly digested, whilst that
of the hunted one had undergone but little alteration.</P>
<P>Hence it may be found adviseable to mix bran of wheat with
the peas and beans, a food of less nutriment, but of easier di∣gestion;
or to let the horses eat before or after them the coarse
tussocks of sour grass, which remain in moist pastures in the win∣ter;
or lastly, to mix finely cut straw with them.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="419"/>
3. Another way of distinguishing light corn from heavy is
by winnowing; as the surface of the light grains being greater
in proportion to their solid contents, they will be carried further
by the current of air, which is produced by the van; though the
heavy grains would roll further on the floor after rolling down
a grate to separate the dust; because their vis inertiae would
carry them further, after they are put in motion; and their sur∣faces
would be resisted by the air no more than those of the
lighter grains.</P>
<P>4. Finally, there is reason to believe that a progressive im∣provement
of many seeds exists during the warmer days of
winter in our granaries, which probably consists in the process
of the conversion of mucilage into starch; in the same manner
as the harsh juices of crab-apples, and of austere pears, are con∣tinually
changing into sugar during the winter; both which
processes are probably in part chemical, like the slow but per∣petual
change of sugar into vinous spirit, when the juices of
sweeter apples and pears, or grapes, are put into bottles in the
manufacture of cyder, perry, and wine.</P>
<P>This improvement of wheat, and of barley, and of oats, is
well known to the baker, the maltster, and the horse-dealer;
as better bread is made from old wheat, and barley is converted
into better malt in the vernal months; and horses are believed
to thrive better, and to possess more vigour, when they are fed
with old than with new oats.</P>
<P>VII. 1. <HI>The preservation of seeds</HI> next demands our atten∣tion.
Those seeds which are liable to lie upon the ground, as
peas and corn, when thrown down by stormy or wet seasons,
should be gathered rather earlier; lest they should begin to ger∣minate,
as they lie upon the ground, and would hence become
a kind of malt after drying. Other seeds should be gathered,
before they would spontaneously fall from their pericarps, to
prevent the loss which must otherwise ensue in the reaping, or
mowing, and carrying them to the barn, which often amounts
to as much as is necessary to sow the land, which produced
it, as well as to supply the depredations of birds, insects, and
vermin.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="420"/>
Mons. B. G. Sage accuses the farmers of some parts of France
of collecting their wheat with many green weeds immediately
after reaping it, and pressing it close together in their barns;
by which the stack undergoes a fermentation with great heat
like some hay stacks; and that the corn is by this fermentation
killed, and will not grow when sown like hay-seeds from a fer∣mented
hay-stack, mentioned in Sect. X. 11. 7; and also that
the gluten, or vegeto-animal matter of the corn, is destroyed;
and it on that account makes less agreeable and less wholesome
bread; and lastly, that the straw is much injured by becoming
mouldy. Journal de Physique, Sep. 1794.</P>
<P>Mons. B. G. Sage adds, that the following process will dis∣cover,
whether wheat has been thus injured, which may be in∣teresting
both to the baker, and wheat-buyer, who wants it for
seed-wheat. Make a paste with flour and water, then wash it
with your hands under water, which must be frequently chang∣ed,
till it no longer becomes discoloured. The substance remain∣ing
the hands is the gluten; if the corn be good, this is elastic,
and will contract when drawn out; if the corn has begun to
heat, it is brittle; if the corn has fermented, none of the glu∣ten
will be obtained.</P>
<P>In this country, where corn is seldom cut too early, or pres∣sed
together on the stack, the principal circumstance required is
to keep it dry; as the straw is not liable to ferment like new hay
made with young grass, which contains sugar at every joint of
the stem. To preserve a stack of wheat dry, a good cover of
thatch may seem sufficient; but as this is liable to injury by
vermin, it would be an additional security, if at the time of mak∣ing
the stack the sheaves were laid highest in the middle, and
lower on every side, so that if any wet should find its way into
the stack, it might drain onwards along the straw of the sheaves,
which would thus act like thatch throughout the whole stack.</P>
<P>There are instances of great durability of seeds, which have
been preserved dry, and secured from either so great heat or so
great cold, as might destroy their life or organism. Thus there
is an account of the seeds of Indian wheat, which grew well in
a hot-house after having been kept thirty-four years, as was
accurately ascretained. Bath Society, Vol. V. p. 464. And
<PB N="416" REF="421"/>
it has been lately asserted, that many seeds of more than a hun∣dred
years old, which were found in some old herbarium at
Vienna, have been made to germinate by the use of oxygenated
muriatic acid and water. Philos. Magaz. But if the organic
life of a seed be destroyed by frost, or fire, or mechanic injury,
putrefaction succeeds, and decomposition; as when the organic
life of an egg is destroyed by violently agitating it, it is known
soon to putrefy.</P>
<P>To preserve seeds in barns or granaries our principal attention
should be first to make them dry; and secondly to keep them
dry; because no seeds can vegetate without moisture. The art
of drying most seeds must consist in duly ventilating them, espe∣cially
on dry days; which may be done by frequently turning
over the heaps of them; and to preserve them dry in this cli∣mate
the door and windows of granaries should open to the south
to receive the warmth of the sun, with apertures round the build∣ing
for sufficient ventilation; which must be prevented from
admitting rain or snow by sheltering boards on the outside.</P>
<P>The heaps of corn should be surrounded with boards to keep
them from contact with brick or stone walls; which, when
warm moist south-west winds succeed cold north-east winds,
are liable to precipitate the moisture from the atmosphere by
their coldness, and to communicate it to all bodies in contact
with them. For a similar purpose in stables some have put
up a tall wooden trunk from the chamber to the room below,
three or four feet square, and ten or twelve feet high, with a
sliding valve to draw out the corn below, which is poured in
at the top; in three or four places a tin or wooden pipe full of
holes is made to pass horizontally through the box to give air
to the corn, the whole of which, when any of it is drawn out
below, is moved in descending; and new surfaces of corn are
applied to the air-holes of the horizontal tubes.</P>
<P>The most secure way of preserving a great quantity of wheat,
according to Mr. Tull, is by gently drying it on a hair-cloth in
a malt-kiln, with no other fuel but clean straw, and no greater
heat than that of the sunshine. In this situation the wheat re∣mained
from four hours to twelve hours, according to the pre∣vious
dampness of it. Mr. Tull knew a farmer in Oxfordshire
<PB N="417" REF="422"/>
who purchased wheat, when it was cheap, and kept it by thus
drying it for many years, and made a large fortune by selling it
again in dearer seasons. The life of the seed was not destroyed
by this process; as he asserts, that some of it grew, which had
been kept in this manner seven years; whereas in drying pota∣toes
on a malt-kiln so great heat was employed as to destroy
their life, and violent putrefaction ensued, as mentioned in Sect.
X. 9. 2.</P>
<P>2. A due ventilation also, where corn is kept in the common
warmth of the atmosphere in this climate, is necessary, except
in seasons of frost, and also the admission of light; as otherwise
the vegetable mucor, called mould, is liable to grow upon the
corn, and injure it; as this mucor like some other funguses
will grow, where there is little or no change of air, and with∣out
light, as in cellars, if there be sufficient moisture and
warmth.</P>
<P>3. Another method of preserving seeds may consist se∣cluding
them from heat, as in granaries beneath the soil; which
are so deep or so well covered with earth, as not to be affected
by the difference of seasons. Thus there have been instances
of mustard-seed producing a crop on digging up earth, which
had not been removed for many years, and, as was believed,
even for ages. And in ice-houses it is probable, that not only
seeds might be long preserved, but perhaps fruits also; if they
were afterwards very gradually thawed by putting them into
cold water, that they might not be destroyed by the too great
stimulus of sudden heat, as mentioned in Sect. XV. 4. 1.</P>
<P>4. Where it has been necessary suddenly to collect and to
preserve great heaps of corn without shelter for the provision of
armies, some have moderately moistened the upper surface of the
heap daily, which has occasioned the upper grains to grow, and
thus to produce a sward or turf over those below; which, it is
said, has thus preserved the lower part of the magazine. But
in respect to granaries for the purpose of laying up very large
quantities of grain to prevent famines in scarce years, I suppose
the stacks of covetous farmers, who keep their corn in cheap
years, hoping to sell it at a better price in scarce ones, is a
more certain method, and a cheaper one to the public, to keep
<PB N="418" REF="423"/>
up a sufficient stock of corn, than by any other experiment that
can be devised.</P>
<P>5. Gardeners in general prefer new seeds to old for their
principal crops, as they are believed to come up sooner, and
with greater certainty, and to grow more luxuriantly. “But
peas and beans of a year old,” Mr. Marshall observes, “are by
some preferred to new,” as not so likely to run to straw. And
cucumbers and melons are best to be several years old, in order
of their shooting less vigorously, and thence becoming more
fruitful. But this principle is carried too far by some gardeners,
who say these seeds cannot be too old, and will allow ten years
to be within bounds; three for cucumbers, and four for melons,
however is age enough.</P>
<P>“As to the age of seeds, at which they may be sown, it is
uncertain, and depends much upon how they are kept; those
of cucumbers and melons are good a long time, because very
carefully preserved.</P>
<P>“Peas and beans will germinate very well at seven years of
age; but the seeds of lettuces and kidney-beans, and some
others, are not to be depended upon after a year or two; and
generally speaking the smaller seeds are of the least duration.”
Marshall on Gardening.</P>
<P>6. Where seeds of a perishable nature are to be carried to,
or brought from, distant countries, I suspect that covering them
in sugar would be the most certain and salutary method of pre∣serving
them; and even, that flesh meat cut into thin slices,
and covered with sugar, or syrup, or treacle, would be better
preserved than in brine, and afford a much more salutary nourish∣ment
to our sailors.</P>
<P>Since I wrote the above I have seen a paper in the Transac∣tions
of the Society of Arts, Vol. XVI. from Mr. Sneyde of
Belmont in Staffordshire, who having observed some seeds,
which came accidentally amongst raisins, to grow readily, di∣rected
many seeds to be sent from the West Indies covered with
raisins, and others in sugar, and others in the usual manner of
sending them, and found, that those immersed in sugar or co∣vered
with raisins both looked well, and grew readily; whereas
many of the others would not vegetate.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="424"/>
Since the powder of fresh burnt charcoal is known so power∣fully
to absorb all putrid vapours, it is probable the seeds mixed
with and covered with charcoal dust, which has been recently
burnt, or not long exposed to the air, might be successfully em∣ployed
for the preservation of seeds either in long voyages, or
in domestic granaries.</P>
<P>VIII. 1. <HI>To sow seeds advantageously</HI> it is probable, that
those of our native plants might be suffered to drop on the sur∣face
of the earth in the autumn, as they fall from their parent
plants, covered only by their deciduous leaves; in which situa∣tion
their fruit might contribute to nourish them, as our crabs
and sloes; or defend them from insects, as the acrid husk of the
walnut; or from birds, as the hard stones or shells of nuts and
cherries, since this is the process of nature.</P>
<P>But when the seeds brought originally from other climates are
to be sown, an attention is required to the circumstance of sea∣son
and of soil. Those, which will ripen their seeds in the same
year, are to be sowed in the early spring, and covered lightly
with earth to preserve them from birds and insects; and should
be buried thus beneath the soil, soon after it has been ploughed
or dug, as its interstices are then replete with atmospheric air;
which may be necessary to stimulate into elevation the plume of
the embryon plant; as the moisture of the earth is necessary to
stimulate the root into its elongation downwards.</P>
<P>Those seeds nevertheless, which will not perfect their vegeta∣tion
in the same year, must be sown in the early autumn; and
though all seeds vegetate better, when placed but a little
beneath the surface of the soil, as one inch, because they have
then a better supply of atmospheric air, which may be necessary
for their first growth, before they have acquired leaves above
ground; yet as many foreign seeds may not be sufficiently hardy
to bear our inclement winters, it may be necessary, as some be∣lieve,
to bury them an inch and a half, or two inches, deep in
the soil, to prevent the frosts from doing them injury, as
well as to preserve them from the depredation of birds. And the drill
semination, or sowing all kinds of seeds in rows, is the most con∣venient
method for sowing them at a determined depth, and also
<PB N="420" REF="425"/>
for the purpose of keeping the young plants clear from weeds by
the more easy application of the hoe.</P>
<P>To sow many seeds earlier than is usually practised is much
recommended. There is a paper by Lord Orford in Mr.
Young's Annals of Agriculture, Vol. IX. p. 385, who seems
to have found considerable advantage by sowing barley so early
as the seventh of February, three and a half bushels on an acre.
But as much moisture with or without subsequent frost is more
liable to destroy the embryon in its very early state in the seed,
than after it has shot out roots and a summit, and thus acquired
some habits of life; this early sowing must sometimes be practised
with caution. Seeds may nevertheless be sown still earlier in
hot-houses, or in warm situations, as peas, beans, wheat, and
may be afterwards transplanted in the vernal months with safety
and advantage. See Sect. X. 3. 6.</P>
<P>The difficulty of determining the best season for sowing seeds
in the spring, owing to the variation of the weather in the same la∣titude,
as well as in laying down the exact seasons for sowing in
different latitudes, occasioned Linneus to construct, what he
terms a calendar of Flora; which was afterwards adapted to this
climate by Stillingfleet; which consisted in observing the first ap∣pearance
of the root scions, or flowers of the uncultivated native
vegetables; with directions to sow the cerealia, or harvest seeds,
when such plants or flowers became visible. By attention to
such observations on the uncultivated native plants in many cli∣mates,
it is probable, that ingenious tables might be produced,
which might direct the best time of sowing the useful seeds in all
latitudes, and in all situations.</P>
<P>Another table of the climates, where plants grow naturally,
and of their native situations in respect to moisture or dryness,
hill or valley, with the kind of soil where they were originally
found, might also contribute to their successful cultivation.</P>
<P>2. In the gardens near large towns, where the land is more va∣luable
and better manured, gardeners sometimes sow two or three
kinds of seeds on the same ground for the purpose of economy.
Thus Mr. Marshall observes, that “on the same ground they sow
radishes, lettuces, and carrots; the radishes are drawn young
for the table, the lettuces to plant out, and a sufficient crop of
<PB N="421" REF="426"/>
carrots is left; for carrots, if you wish them to be large, should
not grow very near to each other.”</P>
<P>In defence of this mode of culture it is said, if one crop fails,
the others may do well, and there is no loss of ground or time;
and if all succeed, they do very well. Radishes and spinach
are commonly sown together by the common gardeners, and
many manoeuvres of inter-cropping are made by them, as the
sowing or planting between rows of vegetables that are wide
asunder, or presently to come off, or in the alleys of things cul∣tivated
on beds.</P>
<P>“Thus if a piece of horse-radish be new planted, it may be
top-cropped with radishes or spinach, &amp;c.; or if a piece of pot∣atoes
be planted wide, a bean may be put in between each set in
every or every other row; a thin crop of onions upon new aspa∣ragus
beds, is a common practice, drawing them young from
about the plants.” Introduc. to Gardening. Rivington.</P>
<P>The farmer likewise, in the cultivation of grasses for feeding
sheep, finds an advantage in sowing a mixture of seeds on the
same ground, as rye-grass, trefoil and clover, which are said to
succeed each other in respect to the production are maturity of
their herbage, as in Sect. XVIII. 1. 1. And for the purpose
of preventing smut it may be useful, as I have before observed,
to sow in the same ground in separate rows two kinds of wheat,
one of a forwarder nature than the other; whence if the farina
of one kind should be injured by wet weather, that of the other
may impregnate the ears of both. The two kinds of wheat re∣commended
are bearded wheat and smooth-headed wheat, which
are called by farmers cone wheat and Lammas wheat; of both
of which there are many varieties, and it is asserted that one
third of cone wheat is frequently sowed with two thirds of
Lammas wheat, and that the crops are much superior to either
of them separately. Hall's Encyclop. Art. Agriculture.</P>
<P>In respect to kinds of soil those should be chosen, which have
been found by observation to suit particular seeds, both in regard
to their nutritive properties, and the moisture and warmth of
their situations. And for those seeds, which produce tuberous
roots within the earth previous to their flowering, as potatoes,
<PB N="422" REF="427"/>
parsnips, radishes, a soil of less cohesion should be found or pre∣pared.</P>
<P>3. Add to this, that there are some seeds, as those of carrots,
that are so difficult to be disseminated in uniform quantities, that
it has been customary to mix them previously with sand or garden
mould, for the purpose of giving them weight, or bulk, or to
detach them from each other. And some even suffer them to
begin to put forth their roots in such a mixture of moist sand or
garden mould for the purpose of more regularly dispersing them.</P>
<P>In dry seasons the soaking seeds in water, a day or two before
committing them to the ground, will forward their growth, as
well as by artificially watering the ground before or after sowing
them; and the soaking them in a solution of salt and water may
have another advantage of giving an opportunity of rejecting
the light seeds, which float, and perhaps of destroying some in∣sects
which may adhere to them; the sprinkling some kinds of
feed with lime may also be of advantage for the purpose of de∣stroying
insects, if such adhere to them, and of attracting
moisture from the air, or lower parts of the earth, or for its
other useful properties; but where the seed, soil, and season are
adapted to each other, none of these condiments are required.</P>
<P>It may nevertheless on other accounts be very advantageous to
steep many kinds of grain in the black liquor, which oozes from
manure heaps. Mr. Chappel in the papers of the Bath Society,
found great benefit by steeping barley in the fluid above men∣tioned
for twenty four hours, and skimming off the light grains.
On taking it out of the water he mixed wood-ashes sifted with
the grain to make it spread regularly, and obtained a much finer
crop, than from the same corn sown without preparation. To
this we may add, that to steep the seed in a solution of dung in
water, as in the draining from a dunghill, is believed in China
both to forward the growth of the plant, and to defend it from
variety of insects, according to the information given to sir G.
Staunton.</P>
<P>There is an old proverb, “sow dry and set wet;” but where
the earth has been lately turned over by the plough or spade,
there can be no bad consequence from sowing during rain in ge∣neral;
but in some clay grounds much softened by rain, if seed
<PB N="423" REF="428"/>
be put into holes, and a dry season succeeds, an impenetrable
crust may supervene by the exhalation of the water, and the set∣ting,
as it is called, of the clay; but even this could not fre∣quently
occur, when seeds are sown in the moist weather of the
autumnal months; but generally in both cases the growth of the
seed would be forwarded by the moisture.</P>
<P>4. Where the fruit, which surrounds any kind of seeds, can
be sowed along with them, it may answer some useful purpose.
Thus the fruit of crabs, quinces, and some hard pears, will lie
all the winter uninjured covered only with their autumnal leaves,
and will contribute much to nourish their germinating seeds in
the spring. So the holly-berry and the ivy-berry remain du∣ring
the winter months uninjured by the rains or frosts, and un∣devoured
by birds or insects, and contribute to nourish their ger∣minating
seeds, when they fall on the ground in the spring. The
acrid husk of walnuts sowed along with them preserves the
sweet kernel from the attack of insects; the same must be the use
of the acrid oil of the cashew-nut. The hawthorn possesses
both a nutritive covering and a hard shell for the above purposes;
and the seeds of roses are armed with stiff pointed bristles, as
well as furnished with a nutritious fruit, so long known as an
agreeable conserve in the shops of medicine, conserva cynosbati;
the former constitutes a defence against insects, and the latter
supplies a reservoir of nutriment for the germinating seeds.</P>
<P>5. To this should be added, that in our short and cold sum∣mers
the viviparous buds of some vegetables are too luxuriant,
and do not produce oviparous buds soon enough to ripen their
seeds, as melons and cucumbers, and many other plants, in
those seasons which are moister than common. It is believed,
that by washing the seeds of melons and cucumbers from the
saccharine and mucilaginous matter of their fruit, and by keep∣ing
the seed three or four years before it is used, that the vivi∣parous
buds become less vigorous, and the oviparous ones more
numerous, and forwarder in their flowering; and for the pro∣duction
of earlier as well as of larger crops all such luxuriant
vegetables should be sown early in the vernal season, or in the
antumnal months, if they are not too tender to bear the winter
frosts.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="424" REF="429"/>
<HEAD>IX. Question concerning general enclosure.</HEAD>
<P>The political advantage or disadvantage of the general enclo∣sure
of a country belongs to this place, as it more particularly
affects the production of the cerealia, or corn-agriculture.</P>
<P>There can certainly be no objection to the enclosure of com∣mons,
or at least to the division of them into private property,
as they are believed to produce more than tenfold the quantity
of sustenance to mankind, if they are employed in agriculture,
or even in pasturage, than by nourishing a few geese, sheep, or
deer, in their uncultivated state covered with fern, heath, or gorse.</P>
<P>2. The advantage of enclosing pasture-lands, or meadows,
can not be doubted; as the management of fattening cattle, of
milch-cows, sheep, and horses, becomes so much easier; as well
as the more convenient use of the aftermath, when the hay is carried away.</P>
<P>3. The lands also appropriated to the production of garden
vegetables and fruit, as well as to the production of other pe∣rennial
plants, which are used in the arts, as hemp, flax, madder,
woad, rhubarb; and of the esculent roots or herbage raised for
the consumption of cattle, as turnips, potatoes, carrots, cabbages,
certainly require to be enclosed.</P>
<P>4. The political question therefore finally concerns only the
arable lands, and asks simply, whether a general enclosure of
arable lands be favourable or unfavourable to the population, and
consequent prosperity of the country, which must depend on
the comparative quantity of nutritive provision, which is likely
to be produced from the different modes of its cultivation.</P>
<P>Now as pasturage requires fewer hands in the management of
it, and less art and attention to conduct it, than agriculture;
and as its products in flesh, cheese, butter, take a higher com∣parative
price at market, and are articles of greater luxury, than
the products of arable land in corn, we may conclude, that pas∣turage
will prevail in all enclosed provinces over agriculture.
And as perhaps tenfold the numbers of mankind can be sup∣ported
by the corn produced on an hundred acres of land, than
on the animal food which can be raised from it, it follows, that
<PB N="425" REF="430"/>
an enclosed province will afford sustenance to a much smaller
population; and as the number of inhabitants of a country de∣pends
on the ease, with which parents can procure sustenance
for their families, marriages will become fewer, and the peo∣ple
decrease, when an arable country is converted into pastur∣age.</P>
<P>This last circumstance appears already to operate in these
realms, since about half a century ago much corn was exported
annually, but for several years last past great quantities of it
have been annually imported for our own sustenance; and that
even though potatoes are much cultivated, and must therefore
lessen the consumption of grain, and the ungraceful fashion of
covering the head with wheat-flour is much diminished. Is
this to be solely ascribed to the numerous enclosures of arable
lands, or in part to the consumption of corn in the distille∣ries?</P>
<P>One very important consequence of any country producing
a greater quantity of corn, than it consumes, and of thence ex∣porting
it to foreign nations, even by means of a bounty, con∣sists
in its certainty of preventing famine, the most dreadful of
human calamities; as in years of scarcity the stream of export∣tation
can be stopped, and produce an ample supply by its stag∣nation
at home.</P>
<P>Hence when a great part of any tract of country becomes em∣ployed
in pasturage instead of agriculture, the inhabitants will
become consumers of flesh instead of consumers of grain,
and will consequently decrease in number from the want of sufficient
sustenance. Besides which the people of agriculture are more
active and robust than the people of pasturage, and more inge∣nious
in the invention and use of machines necessary for the more
artful cultivation of the soil, as well as more numerous, and
will consequently become superior to them in arms and
arts, and may in process of time conquer them; which reminds us of the
Egyptian Dynasty of Shepherd-kings, who were subdued by
their agricultural rivals; and also of the allegorical history of
Cain slaying Abel, which were probably the names of two po∣litical
hieroglyphic figures representing the ages of pasturage and
of agriculture before the invention of letters.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="431"/>
It must hence certainly be an object of good policy to encour∣age
agriculture in preference to pasturage, which in this country
might be effected by preventing the enclosure of arable lands,
and also of those parts of commons, which are best adapted to
the growth of corn; though the whole might be advantageously
divided into private property. Unless some other means could
be devised of preventing a nation from becoming too carnivorous,
or of duly promoting the cultivation of grain, the former of
which was heretofore produced by religious fast-days twice a
week, and the latter by bounties on the exportation of corn.
To which might be added a total prohibition of the destructive
manufactory of grain into spirits, or into strong ale, and thus
converting the natural nutriment of mankind into a chemical
poison, and thus thinning the ranks of society both by lessening
their quantity of food, and shortening their lives by disease.</P>
<P>In many villages, where much arable lands have been lately
enclosed, the numbers of labouring people have quickly been
much diminished both by the scarcity of food, and want of
employment.</P>
<Q><L>Worse fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,</L>
<L>Where wealth accumulates, but men decay;</L>
<L>Princes or lords may flourish, or may fade,</L>
<L>A breath can make them, as a breath has made;</L>
<L>But a bold peasantly, their country's sword.</L>
<L>When once destroy'd, can never be restor'd.</L>
<L>GOLDSMITH'S DESERTED VILLAGE.</L></Q>
<P>Mankind nevertheless seems by nature to be designed to sub∣sist
on both vegetable and animal nutriment, which appears from,
the length of his intestines, which like those of swine are much
longer than the intestines of carnivorous animals, and much
shorter than those of the vegetable eaters; and which also ap∣pears
from the structure of his teeth, which partakes of the struc∣ture
of those of the carnivorous and phytivorous animals; and
lastly, because those people, who live solely on vegetables, as
the Gentoo tribes, and those who subsist solely on animals,
as the fish-eaters of the northern latitudes, are undoubtedly a
feebler generation than those of this country, who exist on a
<PB N="427" REF="432"/>
mixture of both. A due proportion therefore of the two kinds
of nourishment, such as perhaps at present exists, or lately did
exist, in this nation, must be decidedly the best; the preserva∣tion
of which, with the prohibition of spirits, or of strong fer∣mented
liquors, except occasionally as medicines, might pro∣bably
render these kingdoms more populous, robust, prosperous,
and happy, than any other nation in the world. But if the
luxurious intemperance of consuming flesh-meat principally, and
of drinking intoxicating liquors, should increase amongst us,
so as to thin the inferior orders of society by scarcity of food,
and the higher ones by disease both of mind and body, it may
hereafter be said of Great Britain, amid her foreign conquests,
as formerly of ancient Rome,

<P>As the barks of trees are composed of a congeries of the long
caudexes of the individual buds, which consist of the absorbent
vessels, which imbibe nutriment from the earth, and of the arte∣ries
and veins, which supply nutriment to the growing vegetable;
of the glands, which secrete from the vegetable blood the vari∣ous
acrid, astringent, or narcotic, juices to defend them from
the depredation of insects; and the various mucilaginous, oily,
or saccharine, materials for the nourishment of their embryon
buds; and lastly, of the organs of reproduction. There exists
the strongest analogy between the barks of the trunks of trees,
and of their roots, in every respect; except that the former
possesses a cuticle adapted to the contact of the dry atmosphere,
and the latter a cuticle adapted to the contact of the moist
earth, which differ from each other like the external skin, and
the mucous membranes of animals. And finally, as these long
caudexes of the buds of trees, which form the filaments of the
bark, terminate in radicles beneath the soil, and in leaves in
the air, like the broad caudexes with the radicles and ascending
stems, or foilage, of herbaceous plants, they exactly resemble
each other.</P>
<P>We shall therefore divide roots for the purpose of treating of
their production into bulbous or tuberous roots, into palmated
or branching roots, and into barks; observing that though
roots and buds might possibly have existed before seeds, and
though a great number of the roots used for nutriment, or for
the purposes of medicine, or for the arts of dying and tanning,
are immediately produced by buds, or bulbs; yet are they all,
which we now possess, originally derived, I suppose, from seeds;
because those varieties, which have been propagated from buds
or bulbs for many centuries, are believed to acquire hereditary
diseases, and gradually to perish.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="430" REF="435"/>
<HEAD>I. Of tuberous and bulbous roots.</HEAD>
<P>1. Some tuberous roots, as the turnip, brassica rapa, are im∣mediately
produced from seeds, but differ from the other plants,
which are called annual or biennial, in this circumstance; that,
as they are generally sowed so late in the season as not to have
time to produce flowers and seeds in the same year, they pro∣duce
a knobby root, which consists of a reservoir of nutritious
matter for the future flower-stem, which is to rise and flourish
in the succeeding spring and summer; whereas the common an∣nual
grasses, as oats and barley, do not previously lay up a
magazine of nutriment in their roots, but in their joints, which
are sweet; and therefore their roots are not used for culinary
purposes, or for provender.</P>
<P>Other tuberous roots are raised in the same manner from
seeds, but are generally sown also so late in the season as not to
form their flower-stems in the same year; as the carrot, daucus
carota; the parsnip, pastinaca sativa; and the beet, beta vulga∣ris;
these also lay up a store of mucilaginous and saccharine mat∣ter
in their roots for the growth of the future flowers. In the
beet-root the crystals of sugar are sometimes visible by a micros∣cope;
and I was well informed, that a labourer in Lincoln∣shire
made small beer from a decoction of parsnip roots, which
was spirituous enough, and not of disagreeable flavour; and Mr.
Hornby of York, by boiling carrots, and fermenting the juice
expressed from them, produced two hundred gallons of proof
spirits from twenty tons of carrots. Edinb. Transact. Vol. II.
p. 28. Now as all vinous spirit has been sugar, there is foun∣dation
to hope that a method may be discovered of producing
and separating sugar from these plants of our own climate in
sufficient quantity for our domestic consumption, or even for
exportation.</P>
<P>Other tuberous roots are propagated from seeds in the same
manner; and though they are sowed early, and produce their
flower-stem and seeds in the same year, yet they form a knobby
root, which consists of a magazine of nutritious matter, previous
to the elevation of the flower-stem, as the radish, rhaphanus sa∣tivus,
<PB N="431" REF="436"/>
and carrot, and beet, when sown early. I nevertheless
suspect that these, as well as the preceding, consist in reality
of two successive plants; that which forms the knobby root,
and that which is formed from it, as spoken of in Sect. IX.
3. 6.</P>
<P>For the production of roots of these kinds, which are im∣mediately
or secondarily propagated from seeds, our attention
must be applied to collect the forwardest seeds, and
from the best plants of the kind; and to sow them at the proper season
of the early spring, or early autumn; and in a soil which con∣tains
sufficient vegetable nourishment, observing, nevertheless,
that as carrots, parsnips, beets, and radishes consist of knobs
formed in the ground, a less adhesive soil is to be selected; as
one abounding with siliceous or calcareous sand, as well as with
carbonic earth. But as the turnips are formed chiefly above
ground, this attention to the cohesion of the soil becomes less
necessary, so that it is sufficiently penetrable by the fibres of
their radicles.</P>
<P>There is another art of producing larger roots from seed, and
at an earlier season, as of radishes; which is by sowing them
in hot-beds in the early spring, and exposing the tops to the cold
air during the day, as this prevents the luxuriant growth of the
summit, and increases that of the root.</P>
<P>2. Other tuberous roots are generally propagated by subter∣raneous
wires, or roots-buds, from the tuberous roots of their
parents through a long generation, and not either primarily or
secondarily from seeds; as the potatoe, solanum tuberosum; and
the ground artichoke, or tuberous sun-flower, helianthus tube∣rosus;
and perhaps the pig-nut, bunium bulbocastanum.</P>
<P>As the tuberous roots of the potatoe planted in the spring
not only produces many other similar tuberous roots, but flowers
also during the summer; I was led to suspect, that pinching off
the flowers, as they appeared, would contribute to increase the
number or enlarge the size of the new roots; which experiment
has been made on a small scale by one, who believed it to suc∣ceed
in a degree decisive of its utility. See Sect. XIX. 3. 1.
and Sect. VII. I. 3. where it is said, that pinching off the
flower-stems of bulbous-rooted flowers, when they first appear
<PB N="432" REF="437"/>
on young bulbs only a few years from the seed, is believed to
render the flower duplicate.</P>
<P>As the roots of potatoes are formed beneath the earth, the
soil, in which they are planted, should be laid hollow and full
of cells, or should possess less cohesion than usual, to facilitate
the protrusion of their wires, and the enlargement of their roots.
This should be done by burying some long litter of straw and
stable dung under the soil, for as potatoes are believed to re∣quire
more carbonaceous earth than carrots, a mixture of sand
is less advantageous to them.</P>
<P>I was this day shewn by my friend Major Trowel of Derby
a new variety of the potatoe in his excellent new-made garden,
the soil of which consists of marl mixed with lime and stable
manure. From one root there appeared to issue six or eight
stems three or four feet long, at every joint of which were pro∣duced
new potatoes; at the lower joints there were three of
these aerial potatoes, one large one the size of a pullet's egg,
and a smaller one on each side of it. At the upper joints only
one new aerial potatoe adhered, and these became smaller the
further they were removed from the root; and finally, at the
summit there had been a flower as there was now a seed-vessel,
called a potatoe-apple. All these new potatoes at the joints of
the stems were green, because they had not been etiolated by
being secluded from the light, but the terrestrial roots were
white. The larger new tuberous roots had eyes on them like
a common potatoe, but the smaller ones had begun to shoot out
a new stem or leaves, from their upper part. This variety,
which may be termed an aerial potatoe, is analogous to the ma∣gical
onion, and other species of allium, which bear cloves, or
roots on their summits instead of seeds, and like the viviparous polygonum; but differs in this circumstance, that in all those,
I believe, the flowers are barren in respect to bearing seeds, as
those are on the summit of the spike of polygonum viviparum;
but in the aerial potatoe there was also a seed-bearing flower at
the summit of the stem, and the new roots only at the lateral
joints. I should hope this proliferous variety by cultivation may
become permanent, and give rise to a new species, which may
<PB N="433" REF="438"/>
produce both aerial potatoes and subterraneous ones, a twofold
viviparous progeny.</P>
<P>The curling of the leaves of potatoes, which is attended with
so great a diminution of the quantity and size of the new roots,
is supposed to be owing to their continued propagation by sub∣terraneous,
buds or root-wires, instead of by seed; that hence
they acquire hereditary diseases, like the canker or gangrene
of apple trees, which have for one or two centuries been propa∣gated
by grafting the scions, as mentioned in Sect. IX. 3. 4.
and XV. 1. 4. Hence by sowing the seeds of potatoes, and
cultivating the roots thus produced, new varieties may probably
be soon acquired, exempt from the disease of the curled leaf,
and which may be as good in other respects as those which have
been too long propagated by their roots. Some have neverthe∣less
affirmed, that they have seen curled potatoe-plants in the
second year from the seed; and others, that they have seen
numerous insects on these curled leaves; and others, that the
potatoe-root, the leaves of which are curled, remains hard, and
less dissoluble in the soil, which I have myself witnessed. More
observations are wanted to elucidate this subject.</P>
<P>Another cause of the degeneracy of potatoes has arisen, I
believe, from planting the least instead of the largest roots, see
Sect. XVI. 5. and which consequently possess less vigorous
vegetation, as buds and bulbs so exactly resemble the parent plant.
Thus the small bulbs, which arise from tulip-roots, will pro∣duce
a rather larger bulb annually for three or four years, as I
am informed; but it is the large new central bulb only, which
will produce a flower the next summer, and another large cen∣tral
bulb like itself. See Sect. IX. 3. 1. Another cause of the
degeneracy of potatoes may arise from dividing the larger roots
into too many sets, which must deprive the embryon plant of
much of its appropriated nutriment; as the umbilical part of
the root is generally thrown aside by those idly-ingenious dissecters
of it; for though the part, where the umbilical vessels were in∣serted,
may not after the mature growth of the bulb appear to
possess new vessels from the embryon plants, such as are seen on
the lobes of a growing garden-bean; yet, as it becomes decom∣posed,
<PB N="434" REF="439"/>
it must supply mucilaginous or saccharine nutriment to
the roots of the new plants.</P>
<P>As the potatoes raised from seeds do not flower on the second
or third year, resembling in this circumstance the bulbs of tulips
and hyacinths; these new roots, I am told, are sold as early
potatoes, and that they are forwarder in their growth from their
being generally planted without being divided; and that they
form their new roots sooner, as they do not flower. To im∣prove
the seeds of potatoes see Sect. XVI. 3. 4.</P>
<P>The following method of planting whole potatoes is recom∣mended
in Mr. Adam's Essays on Agriculture, and has a pro∣mising
appearance.</P>
<P>“The idea,” says he, “which I mentioned before, respecting
the culture of the Scotch and Anjou cabbages, might be success∣fully
applied to that of potatoes. Let us suppose die ground, in
which they are to be set, is properly prepared by plowing: let
then the furrows be drawn in at four feet distance all over the
field and crossed by other furrows at an equal distance. Where
these intersect each other lay in some dung from a wheelbarrow,
extending from the point of intersection fourteen or fifteen inches
each way: let a man following spread a little of the mould from
the furrow over the dung; let a third hand put one whole sound
potatoe at the point of intersection, and one in each furrow, at a
foot distance from the centre, which will make five in all: a
fourth hand sould now follow with a barrow full of leaves, and
lay them over the plants; should then sprinkle some mould lightly
over them, and leave them so till the plants shoot.</P>
<P>“Thus the plants will occupy a space of two feet each way,
out of the four feet between the furrows; and the remaining in∣tervals
between the plants on each side will also be two feet,
which intervals I would horse-hoe at the proper periods, first
one way of the field, and then across, laying the mould upon
the plants at each hoeing, so that the spaces which the plants
occupied would by these means become little square hills filled
with roots; and the intervals between being thus hoed and cross
hoed, would have the usual good effects of pulverizing the soil,
destroying the weeds, and preparing the land in the best manner
possible for a crop of wheat.”</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="440"/>
3. The ground artichoke, helianthus tuberosus, seldom ripens
its seeds in this country, and might probably be much improved
by using methods to ripen the seed, which are mentioned in
Sect XVI. 3. 4; and by thus producing new varieties; and the
pignut, bunium, bulbocastanum, might probably by cultivation from
the seed supply an agreeable and salutary root to be eaten like
chesnuts either raw or roasted.</P>
<P>4. The seeds of the common onion, allium cepa, generally
produce no flower-stems the first year; but each seed produces
concentric leaves, which gradually form a large bulb below them
with one or two, and sometimes three, less internal bulbs, in∣cluded
within three or four general concentric coats, besides the
three or four coats appropriated to the individual bulbs, as de∣scribed
in Sect. IX. 3. 2. On the next year some species of
this genus produce bulbs after their flowers instead of seeds, as
allium sativum and magicum; others produce not only flowers
but also bulbs, as allium moly, and spherocephalum. If the
bulbs of these least kinds of allium were planted with design to
produce other bulbs, and not to produce seeds, it is probable,
that pinching off the flowers might enlarge the new bulbs, as the
pinching off the flowers of potatoes; and that by such means
a larger kind of bulbs of some of this genus might be procured.</P>
<P>5. Another bulbous root, which might be well worthy culti∣vation
in moist ground, is the orchis morio; which is sold un∣der
the name of salep, after it has been prepared by first scalding
it in hot water to detract the skin, and afterwards by drying it
in an oven; and which then affords a nourishing mucilage, which
will long keep uninjured. And, if it was cheaper, might pro∣bably
be brought into more extensive use as a culinary vegetable,
as mentioned in Sect. XVI. 3. 4. The orchis morio produces
one large new root annually, and probably some smaller offsets,
as otherwise I do not perceive, how it could increase in our
meadows, as it does not ripen its seeds in this country.</P>
<P>If the new root be taken away from the old one early in the
year, it is affirmed, that the seeds will ripen in Sweden; which
are otherwise in that country, as in this, always unprolific; this
experiment might therefore be very advantageous to the cultiva∣tor.
Another method of inducing orchis to bear prolific seeds
<PB N="436" REF="441"/>
may be by consining the roots in garden pots, which might be
immersed in a moist soil, and would probably bear ripe seeds; as
the lily of the valley, convallaria, is said to do by crowding its
roots so much as to prevent the production of more of them,
Amenet. Academ. Vol. VI. p. 120. A third method of pro∣curing
seed from orchis might be by cultivating a few of them in
a hot-house for that purpose.</P>
<P>The root of the snow-drop, galanthus, if dug up in winter,
and prepared in the same manner, might possibly supply a nutri∣tious
mucilage similar to that of the orchis; as I once boiled a
few of them, and found on tasting them, that they had no dis∣agreeable
flavour. If prolific seeds could be procured from this
plant, it might be worth cultivation for the same purposes as the
orchis; and the roots of the hyacinth, I am informed, are
equally insipid, and might be used as an article of food; but the
roots of crocus, which I boiled and tasted had a disagreeable
flavour, and might probably therefore be insalubrious.</P>
<P>Mr. Gmelin in his History of Siberia asserts, that the roots of
the lilium martagou are used as food in that country; and it is pro∣bable
that the root of the arum though it be acrid in its raw state,
might supply palatable and salutary nutriment by cookery; as
Mr. White asserts in his History of Selborne, p. 43, that it is
scratched up and eaten by thrushes in severe snowy seasons, and it is
known soon to lose its acrimony even by exposing its dry
powder to the air; we may add, that the root of the asphodelus
ramosus is used to feed swine in France, and that good starch is
obtained from the roots of white bryony and of alstromeria
licta.</P>
<P>Other bulbous roots are propagated by florists with great at∣tention
for the beauty of their flowers, as tulips, hyacinths, lilies,
and many others. For an account of some of these see Sect. IX.
3. on the growth of bulbs, and Sect. XIX. 3. 1. on the pro∣duction
of flowers.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>II. Palmated or branching roots.</HEAD>
<P>1. The bulbous and tuberous roots already mentioned were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther such, as we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e primarily derived from seeds, as the turnip,
<PB N="437" REF="442"/>
carrot, parsnip, radish, beet, salsafi; or such as were seconda∣rily
derived from seeds, but immediately from bulbs or knobs si∣milar
to themselves, as potatoes, ground artichoke, orchis, pig∣nut.
But the branching or palmated roots, which are used as
food, or in medicine, or in the arts of dying, are seldom produced
immediately from seeds, but generally from preceding roots, and
are hence the product not of annual but of perennial plants; as
the root of liquorice, glycyrrhiza; of marsh mallow, alcea; of
rhubarb, rheum; and of madder, rubia tinctoria.</P>
<P>The roots of these perennial plants shoot out not only annual
stems with numerous flower-buds above ground, but also other
new buds on their caudex, or upper part of the roots beneath
the soil; all which buds protrude their new caudexes not only
over those stems, but also over the old root-branches; and thus
form annually a new bark over the old root, which remains
alive beneath the ground, though the stem perishes by the winter
frosts. This happens exactly in the same manner as the bark of
trees, which annually is produced over the old bark of the root
as well as of the trunk; but in trees the stem-bark as well as the
root-bark survives the winter.</P>
<P>Hence these palmated or branching roots of perennial herba∣ceous
plants, as of rhubarb, madder, liquorice, continue to in∣crease
in size by the super-addition of an annual new bark; but
in four or five years the internal part begins to decay, and the
roots therefore should be taken out of the ground for use before
that time. It is said in the transactions of the Society for En∣couragement
of Arts, Vol. XVI. p. 226, that those rhubarb
roots, which were not taken up till they were seven or more
years old, were most of them good for nothing from the de∣cay
of the internal part of the root. The same is said to happen
to some bulbous roots, as the hyacinth; and occurs in all those
roots, which are said to be end-bitten, as a species of scabius
called devil's-bit. See Sect. IX. 3. 5.</P>
<P>They should then be taken up in the winter months, before
the new buds or flower-stems begin to acquire nourishment from
the root, by which it would be deprived of a part of the nutri∣tious,
colouring, or medical matters; which principally reside in
the bark, or alburnum of it. On this last account also these
<PB N="438" REF="443"/>
roots should not be permitted to continue in the ground a much
longer time than that above mentioned, though the internal or
woody part of the root may not decay; as the woody part is
less adapted to the purposes expected than the bark and albur∣num,
which cover or constitute the numerous branches of the
root.</P>
<P>2. One method to increase the size of these palmated or
branching roots may be by pinching off the flowers, as soon as
they appear, when the seeds are not wanted; this I once saw
practised on the rheum palmatum with apparent advantage, as
well as on potatoes, as mentioned above; as more nutriment
may thus be derived to the new buds forming on the roots.</P>
<P>The colouring matter sold under the name of annotta, or ar∣notta,
which is said to be obtained from the skin of the kernel
of the bixa of South America, or of the enonymus shrub culti∣vated
in our gardens, is believed to be much adulterated with
madder, rubia tinctoria; the root of which for the purpose of
colouring cheese may be used instead of arnotta, and is to my
knowledge a perfectly harmless root, though it tinges the bones
of young animals red, who eat it mixed with their food, and
may be grown by cheese-farmers in their own gardens, as it is a
very hardy perennial plant, and requires no art of cultivation. It
may be used either by pounding the fresh root and boiling it in
water, or by drying the root for the purpose of preserving it, and
afterwards bruising and boiling it.</P>
<P>For the cultivation of rubia tinctoria see Miller's Gardener's
Dictionary, who describes with several plates the manner of
growing and of afterwards preparing this root in prodigious
quantities in Holland; and adds, “that if the cultivation of
madder was carried on properly in England, that it would not
only save to the nation the great annual sum now expended in
the purchase of it from the Dutch, but would employ a great
number of hands, from the time harvest is over, till the spring
of the year, which is generally a dead time for labourers; and
the parishes might thence be much eased of the poor's rates,
which is a consideration well worthy public attention.”</P>
<P>The external part of the root of rubia tinctoria is coloured red,
and its internal part yellow, which distinguishes it from most
<PB N="439" REF="444"/>
other roots, which are generally etiolated owing to their seclu∣sion
from the light; which liberates their superfluous oxygen,
which otherwise deprives them of colour as in bleaching, by
uniting with their colouring matter, and converting it into a co∣lourless
acid, except where the colouring matter abounds in too
great quantity. This etiolation of most roots is evidently owing
to the want of light, because many of them, as of white potatoes,
become green if they grow above ground.</P>
<P>3. The roots of some aquatic plants are used in medicine both
of the bulbous and palmated kinds, as scilla maritima, squill or
sea-onion, and the iris luteus, yellow water flag, and the acorus
calamus, aromatic flag. Other aquatic roots are said to have
supplied food, as the ancient lotus in Egypt, which has been by
some writers supposed to be the nymphaea nelumbo. Herodotus
affirms in his Enterpe, that the Egyptian lotus grows in the
Nile, and resembles a lily; and that the natives dry it in the sun,
and take the pulp out of it, which grows like the head of a poppy,
and bake it for bread. The white flowered and the yellow-flowered
nymphaea of our ponds and rivers has a palmated root
sometimes three inches in diameter. In Siberia the roots of the
butomus, flowering rush, are eaten; both which well deserve
further attention, as they grow spontaneously in our ditches and
rivers, which at present produce no esculent vegetables, and
might thence become an article of useful cultivation. See Sect.
IX. 2. 5.</P>
<P>Some other aquatic roots, as well as terrestrial ones, might
probably become esculent and nutritive by boiling or roasting them
to destroy their acrimony. Or it is probable, that a wholesome
starch might be obtained from them, as from the roots of white
bryonia, as is affirmed by M. Parmetier, by the simple process
of grating the root by a bread-grater of tinned iron into cold
water, and depriving it of its acrid mucilage by frequent cold
ablution. And lastly that they might be so managed as to under∣go
fermentation either by previous germination, or by adding
yest to the juice expressed from them after boiling and thus be
converted into wine or beer, from which a spirit might be
distilled, or vinegar produced. See Sect. XI. 2. 5.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="445"/>
4. The art of preserving roots, when taken out of the ground,
consists either in keeping them alive during the winter without
suffering them to germinate, as life prevents the fermentation or
putrefaction of their juices; or secondly, by depriving them of
their water. For the first purpose the roots, whether bulbous or
palmated, should be kept in a degree of heat above the freezing
point of 32; since freezing them destroys their life; whence
they not only undergo a sudden change in their flavour and nu∣tritive
quality, but quickly tend to putrefaction in consequence of
their loss of life like the eggs of animals. Nevertheless both ve∣getable
and animal products, as fruits and flesh, as well as roots,
may probably long exist unchanged in a frozen state in ice-houses;
and it they are at length gradually thawed by covering them with
melting ice, or immersing them in cold spring water, it is said by
Mr. Reaumure, who tried the experiment on apples, that they
do not lose much of their flavour, if they be afterwards soon
made use of; otherwise, I suppose, as the frost has deprived
them of life, they soon begin to undergo chemical changes.</P>
<P>If these roots are kept in a degree of heat above 48, which is
the heat of the internal parts of the earth, and consequently of
spring water, they are liable to germinate, as happens to onions
and potatoes in our store-houses during the vernal months. And
if they be exposed to a much greater heat, so as to destroy the
life of the root, they soon run into fermentation or putrefaction,
or become covered with mould; unless the water which they
contain be quickly dissipated by evaporation. A friend of mine
once sent many strikes of potatoes to be dried on a malt-kiln,
hoping by that means to preserve them during the summer; but
as the life of these roots was destroyed by the degree of heat,
and only about half of their water evaporated, they soon became
so putrid after being returned into his store room, that the stench
of them was intolerable, and even the swine refused to eat them.
Nevertheless I believe, if the parts either of vegetables or ani∣mals
could be kept in an heat at or above the boiling point of
212 in close vessels, so as not to suffer their fluid part to evapo∣rate,
that neither fermentation nor putrefaction would ensue; but
that they might be kept for years unchanged, as in the cold of
32.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="446"/>
The degree of heat required for preserving roots secure from
frost, and from the process of germination, which is that be∣tween
the degrees of 32 and 48 of Farenheit's thermometer,
may be well managed by storing them beneath the soil in dry
situations, as in dry cellars, or in pits dug for that purpose, or
even in barns; but this requires more attention than is usually
employed in the common manner of storing potatoes, which are
liable to be injured both by frost and by germination. These
pits in a dry soil should be covered with materials, which con∣duct
heat ill, and also with such as might absorb any putrid ex∣halations,
which may occur, and thus check the progress of pu∣trefaction,
if it should commence.</P>
<P>Air is a bad conductor of heat, if it be consined over the sur∣face
of any body, but not so if it be perpetually changed; as it
then carries away heat very rapidly, as any one may experience
by being fanned on a hot day. Hence all such materials as pos∣sess
large pores or interstices full of air, are bad conductors of
heat; as blankets, saw-dust, wood-shavings or straw; and will
thence preserve the bodies, they cover, both from external cold
and from external heat. But as charcoal in coarse powder not
only includes much common air in its pores, but also has the
property, especially if recently burnt, of absorbing putrid exha∣lations;
and is also itself of an unperishable nature; it seems pe∣culiarly
adapted to the purposes above mentioned. Hence the
heaps of potatoes, or carrots, or parsnips, or ground artichokes,
or even the roots of turnips or of beets, and the heads of cab∣bages,
and perhaps pears, and apples, as well as nuts, almonds,
and walnuts, might be well preserved in pits or cellars, or even
in barns, if they were first covered with powdered charcoal an
inch or two in thickness, and over that a covering of saw-dust,
and finally over these a thick impenetrable thatch of straw;
whence a store of provender for the winter months and the suc∣ceeding
spring may be preserved from any degree of cold or of
warmth much above or below that of the internal parts of the
earth, in which seeds are known to continue for ages even with∣out
germination, or decay.</P>
<P>It is nevertheless necessary to dry many palmated roots, when
they are taken out of the ground, either because they will not
<PB N="442" REF="447"/>
continue to live in our barns or store-rooms, like the bulbous
roots, or because they require to be kept for some years in the
shops of medicine. Some of these roots, as those of rhubarb
are said like the bulbous roots of scilla or squill to contain five
sixths of their weight of water, and therefore require considera∣ble
care in the method of drying them; for unless they are
properly dried, they are liable to contract mould or mucor;
which is a vegetable production, which will grow on putrefying
materials without light or much air; but might be prevented
from growing by the vapour of perhaps a teaspoonful of spirit of
wine, as mentioned in Sect. XV. 2. 3.</P>
<P>There is nevertheless some precaution necessary in exhaling
the moisture of these roots, as they should be placed in a situa∣tion,
where they are ventilated as well as heated; for warmth
alone is liable to forward the tendency of the saccharine and
mucilaginous parts of them to pass into fermentation or putre∣faction,
and thence to destroy them; as the alburnum or sap-wood
of timber trees is liable to decay by what is termed the
dry rot.</P>
<P>With this design drying houses are constructed for the pre∣paration
of madder, rubia tinctoria, as described in Miller's
Dictionary; and the rhubarb of the shops has frequently large
holes bored through it; which, it is supposed, were designed,
to pass cords through for the purpose of suspending it to dry,
as it is conveyed on camels in a warm climate.</P>
<P>5. The cultivation of mushrooms, morels, and truffles, aga∣ricus,
phallus, lycoperdon, should be here mentioned; as they
are propagated by their roots. The fungi seem to constitute an
isthmus between the two great continents of nature, the vegeta∣ble
and animal kingdoms. The odour of a fungus, when burn∣ing,
approaches to that of burning feathers; and all of them
putrefy like animal flesh; some of them as the phallus impu∣dicus,
stink-horn, emits such a putrid scent, as it grows, as to
attract innumerable flesh-flies to deposit their eggs or spawn in it.
And those mushrooms, which are cooked at our tables, as well
as the catchup, made by preserving their juices in salt and water,
possess an animal flavour. Of this last circumstance I was told
a remarkable instance, where a cook maid in a family of inva∣lids,
<PB N="443" REF="448"/>
who frequently wanted weak broth, perpetually deceived
them by a mixture of a small quantity of good catchup with
thin gruel, and with only the addition of shred leaves of parsley,
and a little salt.</P>
<P>Another thing in which the funguses differ from vegetables,
consists in their growing perfectly well without light, which is
so necessary to the health of vegetables. The scarlet folds be∣neath
the head of the common esculent mushroom are so like the
gills of fish, that they have in our language obtained the same
name. These folds beneath the hat of the agarics, the pores
beneath the boletus, and the thorny appearance beneath the
hydnum, and the net-like pores of phallus, are all different
means of exposing a larger surface to the air; and therefore
undoubtedly constitute the lungs of the funguses, as leaves con∣stitute
those of vegetable, and not their organs of reproduction,
as some have supposed.</P>
<P>The chemical analogy, which exists between some of the
mushroom tribe and animal matters, led Van Humboldt to in∣vestigate
their conducting power of what he terms the galvanic
fluid, which I believe to be simply a minute shock of the elec∣tric
fluid; and he found, that morels and those fungi which in
a state of putrefaction emit a cadaverous animal smell, are
equally good conductors as real animal substances. Annals of
Medicine for 1798, Edinb. Van Humboldt asserts further, that
by chemical analysis they approach likewise to animal sub∣stances,
as they contain much azote and phosphorous. He also
asserts, that he converted morels into fat by means of sulphuric
acid diluted with water, which experiment he thinks is analo∣gous
to that of Gibbes, and of the burying ground of the Inno∣cents,
where fat was formed from muscular flesh. Journal de
Physique, Vol. IV. p. 67.</P>
<P>The fungi would hence appear to be animals without loco∣motion,
whose lacteal vessels are inserted into the earth, like
those of vegetables; but whose gills or lungs are covered from
the light, like those of animals, but exposed to the open air like
the leaves or lungs of vegetables. Another curious occurrence,
which seems to associate them with animals, if the truth can be
depended upon, is that some of them are of animal origin; as
<PB N="444" REF="449"/>
the common mushroom is said certainly to be procured from
horse-dung, as mentioned below; and may therefore have its
embryon or early state in the intestines of animals, and its ma∣turer
state in the soil or atmosphere like other insects, as the
bot-fly, and perhaps the tape-worm, and ascarides? as this pro∣duction
of mushrooms is otherwise contrary to all known ana∣logy.
Other fungi are found on the decayed parts of peculiar
vegetables, from which they seem to take their origin, perhaps
like worms in the intestines of animals, as the agaric of the oak,
of the beech, of the elder; the boletus of the beech, and of
the willow; and many others mentioned by Linneus.</P>
<P>The lycoperdon tuber, or truffle, grows under ground with∣out
light, never rising into day; and is propagated, I suppose,
by only a paternal or lateral progeny, like the polypus of our
ditches, and not by sexual connexion, or seminal progeny. The
truffle is hunted by dogs probably from its possessing somewhat
of an animal scent, like the perspirable effluvia left upon the
ground, by which they hunt their game or discover the foot of their master</P>
<P>The phallus esculentus, morel, and the agaricus, mushroom
of various kinds, will grow without light in cellars, or on beds
covered with straw; and are also, I suppose, propagated by a
paternal or lateral progeny only, and not by a sexual or seminal
one.</P>
<P>The roots, or spawn, or embryons, of the common mush∣room
are said by Mr. Kenedy and others to be certainly procur∣ed
from horse-dung laid unbroken in small heaps under cover.
It is asserted, that in a few weeks during the summer months
these roots will appear like white threads; which on breaking
the lumps have the mushroom smell. These horse-droppings
are directed to be as little broken as possible, and to be laid
about three inches thick on a hot-bed of moderate warmth, con∣structed
of alternate layers of tanner's bark and horse-dung, and
whose uppermost stratum consists of tanner's bark about two
inches thick. The bed is then to be covered with a little ma∣nure,
and about three inches of good soil, and finally with a
thick coat of straw. The shed behind most hot-houses is found
to afford a convenient place for a mushroom bed; as no light
<PB N="445" REF="450"/>
is required, but only warmth, and occasional moisture. See
Kenedy on Gardening, Vol. II. for a particular account of
this process.</P>
<P>In the tanyards of Derby, I am well informed, that a pro∣duction
of mushroom spawn always occurs in the path, where
the horse walks, which draws the rolling stone to grind the
bark, which path consists of powdered oak-bark and horse-dung
trampled together. Of this I was in one instance an eye-witness,
but whether the embryons of mushrooms were derived from the
oak-bark or horse-dung was not easy to determine.</P>
<P>Mr. Ferber, in his Travels through Italy, translated by
Raspe, mentions the mushroom-stone. He says, “the pietra
fungaia is a white calcareous stalactite, or tuph-stone, dug in the
limestone hills bordering on Romagna, and endowed with the
quality to produce in any season of the year esculent mushrooms,
if kept in a moist cellar, and now and then sprinkled with
water. This quality is owing to a great many roots, or vegeta∣ble
sibres, together with the mushroom seeds enclosed in its sub∣stance.
They are used in some great houses in Naples and
Rome. I saw an indurated mould from the same place that
had the same quality, which was used by Mr. Fabriani in the
mint of Florence.”</P>
<P>From this account the mushroom-stone appears to consist of a
porous tupha, like that with which the houses are built at Mat∣lock
Bath; and which has been deposited from the water.
But a later writer has since analysed one of these stones, but
does not mention how long it had been used for the vegetation
of mushrooms, which might in great measure affect the results of
his analysis. Mr Gadd, in the Stockholm Transactions, says,
that this pietra fungaia described first by Ferber consists of forty-five
or forty-six hundredth parts of siliceous earth, and twenty
of a calx of iron, with a little magnesia and vegetable alkali.
Analytic. Review, Dec. 1798.</P>
<P>In this country the cellars would not be sufficiently warm to
produce mushrooms at any season of the year; but as this mush∣room-stone
is of calcareous origin according to Ferber, it shews,
that calcareous earth is friendly to the growth of mushrooms;
and a similar porous stone from the vicinity of Matlock Bath
<PB N="446" REF="451"/>
might probably be permeated in a similar manner with the roots
of them, as a convenient repository of them to be raised into life
occasionally by warmth and moisture.</P>
<P>Some of the fungi are believed to possess an intoxicating qua∣lity,
and are eaten for that purpose by the peasants in Siberia.
One fungus of the species agaricus muscarum eaten raw, or a
decoction of three of them, produces intoxication for twelve or
sixteen hours. Hist. of Russia, Vol. I. Nichols, 1780. The
Ostiachs also blister the skin by a fungus found on birch trees, and
use the official agaric fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> soap. Other fungi possess a juice so acrid
in their raw state as immediately to blister the tongue, as I
once experienced on tasting a minute drop of the juice of
a large mushroom, which on breaking the hat poured out a yel∣low
juice, which became purple or blue in a few seconds of
time on its being exposed to the air; which I believed to be
the fungus deliciosus of Linneus; the acrimony of which might
nevertheless probably be destroyed by a boiling heat. And it
is also probable, that the common esculent mushroom may sometimes
disagree from their being not sufficiently stewed, or by
the incautious mixture of some intoxicating fungi along with
them.</P>
<P>Otherwise those in common use at our tables appear to sup∣ply
a wholesome and nutritive food, approaching towards an
animal nature. Two or three kinds are said to be eaten in
France besides the rid-gilled ones which are eaten here; and
it is probable many other kinds of fungi might be found agree∣able
to the palate, and wholesome food, if well boiled, which
might destroy their acrimony; and especially those which when
broken have simply the agreeable smell of the red-gilled ones
in common use; and some of these, I suppose, might be eaten
raw without injury, as many people eat the red gilled ones.</P>
<P>Besides some mushrooms with white gills, which when broken
had the grateful scent of the common red-gilled mushroom, and
which were said to be more delicious, I have known the peziza
auricula, or ear-fungus, which was formerly an article of the
materia medica under the name of the Jew's ear, to be stewed
and eaten in considerable quantity with impunity; and was
esteemed an agreeable article at the supper-table. And as this
<PB N="447" REF="452"/>
was esteemed a pernicious genus of fungi by Clusins, it is pro∣bable,
that many other funguses might lose their acrimony by
the heat of stewing, and become wholesome and agreeable food;
which are at present in disuse from their disagreeable acrimony
in their raw state, or from the bad character they have acci∣dentally
acquired.</P>
<P>It should be added, that though those plants, which are sup∣posed
to possess an alkalescent property, and to be liable to
putrefaction sooner than other vegetables, lose a part of their
acrimony by a boiling heat, as water-cresses, cabbages, onions;
yet that plants, whose acrimony is of a different kind, as ginger,
capsicum, arum, do not become much milder by boiling. I
this morning directed some leaves of common spotted arum, and
of arum arissarum to be boiled, and on tasting them found my
tongue and lips almost excoriated. The nature of this kind of
acrimony has not been sufficiently investigated by the chemists,
but probably depends on a fixed essential oil.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>III. Barks.</HEAD>
<P>1. The barks of the trunks of trees are similar to those of
their roots, and may be esteemed a part of them, as they con∣sist
of an intertexture of the vessels, which descend from the
plume of each individual bud to the radicle of it, and constitute
its caudex. The bark nevertheless of the root is furnished with
lymphatics to absorb water and nutritious juices from the earth,
and is covered with a moister cuticle; while the bark of the
stem is furnished with lymphatics to absorb moisture from the
air, and is covered with a drier cuticle; the latter refembling
the external skin of animals, and the lymphatics, which open
upon it; and the former resembling the mucous membrane of
the stomach, and its lacteals.</P>
<P>As the sap-juice rises in all deciduous trees during the vernal
months to expand their foliage, though probably in greater
quantity in some trees than in others, it must consist not only of
sugar and mucilage, as in the maple and birch, but of various
other ingredients in different trees, which have not been attend∣ed
to; as appears from the taste of their young leaves, as of oak
<PB N="448" REF="453"/>
or ash. And as some of these materials reside in the roots and
sap-wood or alburnum, so others of them may perhaps reside in
the bark, where they have been deposited during the preceding
summer, and become lignified by the warmth of the spring, or
dissolved by the moisture absorbed from the earth and air, and
conveyed upwards to the opening buds; whence it is evident,
that the barks of trees should be taken off for use in winter or in
early spring, before their buds begin to expand; as then a part
of these nutritious juices, or of the other materials, which are
required for medicines, or in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of dying and tanning, are
in part expended on the young leaves; which generally possess
the taste and qualities of the bark, though in a less degree.</P>
<P>It may nevertheless be observed, that all those astringent, or
other materials, may reside in the alburnum of the trunk or roots
of all perennial vegetables, as well as in their barks; because
the young leaves, which pullulate on decorticated oaks, have
the same bitter flavour as the leaves on those, which have not
been decorticated; which may in part be derived from the bark
of the root, which is still in the ground, and be carried up the
vessels of the sap-wood to the new buds.</P>
<P>2. Hence the bark of oak-trees should be taken off during the
winter; but when the sap-juice residing or ascending in the ves∣sels
of the alburnum becomes more liquefied by the warmth of
the spring, or is mixed with more moisture, and pushed up with
great force by the absorbent vessels of the roots, it oozes out in
some degree between the alburnum and the bark; and thus the
bark becomes so much more readily separated from the sap-wood;
whence this business is generally done early in the
spring, and should be performed as soon as this facility of de∣tracting
the bark appears, as mentioned in Sect. III. 5; because
this process of the germination of the buds continues to injure
the bark, whether the tree be cut down or not; as the buds
expand their foliage on new felled trees, as they lie on the
ground.</P>
<P>3. The interior barks of some trees, like the alburnum or
roots above described, contain much mucilaginous or nutritious
matter; as the bark of elm, ulmus, and of holly, ilex; and
probably of all those trees or shrubs which are armed with thorns
<PB N="449" REF="454"/>
or prickles which are designed to prevent the depredations of ani∣mals
on them, as the hawthorn, gooseberry, and gorse, cre∣taegus,
ribes grossularia, ulex. The internal barks of these ve∣getables
may be conceived to be their alburnum less indurated,
and might probably all be used as food for ourselves or other ani∣mals
in years of scarcity, or for the purpose of fermentation; as
I doubt not but the inner bark of elm-trees, ulmus, detracted in
the spring by being boiled in water might be converted by the
addition of yest into small beer, as well as the alburnum of the
maple and birch, acer et betula; all which are now suffered to
be eaten by insects when those trees are felled.</P>
<P>For the sugar, which is extracted from the vernal sap-juice
of the maple and birch, as well as that found in the manna∣ash,
fraxinus ornus, seems to reside during the winter months in
the root or alburnum, rather than in the bark properly so called;
and to become liquefied, as above mention, by the warmth of
the spring, or dissolved by the moisture absorbed from the earth,
and conveyed to the opening buds; but resides solely in the roots
of perennial herbaceous plants; and in the economy of grasses,
and I suppose of the sugar-cane, it is deposited at the bottom of
each joint, which is properly the root of the stem above it, as
shewn in Sect. IX. 3. 1.</P>
<P>Of these the bark of the holly not only yields a nutritious mu∣cilage,
and thus supplies much provender to the deer and cattle
in Needwood-forest by the branches being cut off, and strewed
upon the ground, in severe seasons of frost and snow; but con∣tains
a resinous material, which is obtained by boiling the bark,
and washing away the other parts of it. This resinous material
possesses a great adhesiveness to feathers and other dry porous bo∣dies,
and has hence obtained the name of bird-lime, and much
resembles the caoutchouc or elastic resin brought from South
America, and also resembles a fossil elastic bitumen found near
Matlock in Derbyshire, both in its elasticity and inflammability.
Hollies may be worth cultivating for this material besides the
uses of their wood, as I was informed, that thirty years ago a
person, who purchased a wood in Yorkshire, sold to a Dutch
merchant the bird-lime prepared from the bark of the numerous
hollies for nearly the whole sum given for the wood; which if it
<PB N="450" REF="455"/>
could be hardened might probably be sold for the elastic resin
above mentioned. Whether this resembles the nutritive resinous
material found in wheat flour, when the mucilage and starch are
washed from it, might be worth inquiry, as mentioned in Sect.
VI. 8. 5.</P>
<P>4. Other barks contain bitter, resinous, aromatic, or acrid
materials, which supply the shops of medicine, as peruvian bark,
cascarilla, cinnamon, and were designed by nature to protect
those vegetables from the depredations of quadrupeds or insects.
Hence many trees, and even the wood of them, after it is dried,
and made into domestic furniture, is never devoured by worms,
as the mahogany, cedar, cypress; and hence many plants, as the
foxglove, digitalis, hounds-tongue, cynoglossum, henbane, hyos∣ciamus,
and many trees, are not devoured by any animals; as
their juices would be poisonous to them, or much disagree with
their stomachs, if their disgustful flavours to the nose or palate
did not prevent their eating them. The same defence of the ve∣getable
kingdom from human digestion, except those which have
in long process of time been selected and cultivated, appears from
the relation of some unfortunate shipwrecked travellers, who have
passed some hundreds of miles along uninhabited countries almost
without finding an esculent vegetable production.</P>
<P>5. Other barks contain restringent or colouring particles, em∣ployed
in the arts of dying and tanning, as berberry, oak, and ash,
berberries, quercus, fraxinus. The art of tanning consists in
filling the pores of the animal mucous membrane with these re∣stringent
particles found in some vegetables, which are believed
to possess a quality of shortening animal fibres. Thus when a
long hair is immersed some time in a solution of the bark of oak,
or of the galls produced on its leaves by the punctures of insects,
the hair is said to be shortened. Whether this process be occa∣sioned
by chemical coagulation of the mucus, of which these
fibres totally or in part consist, or by capillary attraction tending
to distend these fibres in breadth, and thus to shorten them, as
a twisted string is shortened by moisture, has not yet been well
investigated. By thus impregnating the pores of animal skins
with vegetable particles, they become less liable to putrefaction,
as consisting of a mixture of animal and vegetable matter, as
<PB N="451" REF="456"/>
well as much better adapted to many domestic or mechanical pur∣poses.</P>
<P>The art of dying consists likewise in impregnating the pores
of dry substances with a solution of the colouring matter extracted
from vegetables by the capillary attraction of those pores to the
coloured solution. And secondly, by a chemical change of
those colouring particles after they have beem imbibed, and the
water of the solution exhaled, by again steeping them in another
solution, which may chemically affect the former. Thus as
green consists of a mixture of blue and yellow, it may be best
produced by boiling the material designed to be dyed first in a
decoction of one of these colours, as of indigo; and then in that
of another, as of the bark of berberry. And as a solution of
iron becomes black when mixed with a decoction of oak-galls▪
by being in part precipitated; it is probable, that the particles of
this combination of a solution of iron with restringent matter
may be larger than either of those particles separately; and
therefore that, if a dry porous substance be immersed first in a
decoction of oak-galls, and after being suffered to dry, is then
immersed in a solution of iron, the black tinge will penetrate
into minuter pores, and thus become more intense, than if the
substance had been immersed in the black dye already prepared.</P>
<P>6. Other barks are used for apparel, paper, cordage, and for
many mechanical purposes, owing to the strength and tenacity of
their sibres, or to the fineness of them; as hemp, cannabis;
flax, linum; for the purposes of spinning and weaving; an art
invented by Isis, queen of Egypt, who seems first to have culti∣vated
flax; which was brought into Europe from the banks of
the Nile. The bark or leaves of the papyrus, a flag of the Nile,
was first used for paper; and the bark of the mulberry-tree is still
made into cloth at Otaheite and other southern islands.</P>
<P>The art of separating the fibres of the bark of plants, as they
consist of the caudexes of buds, or the connecting vessels between
the plumules and the radicles of them, is performed by soaking
them some weeks in stagnant water; till the mucous membranes,
which connect these fibres, are destroyed by putrefaction; and
afterwards by drying them, and beating off with hammers, what
may still adhere.</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="457"/>
These fibrous parts of the barks of trees, as they contain no
saccharine matter, like the alburnum, are much less liable to
decay than the sap-wood, or perhaps than any part of the tim∣ber.
Maupertuis, who went to Lapland to measure a degree of
the meridian, says, that among the numerous trees which lay
upon the ground destroyed by age, or blown down by the winds,
many birch trees appeared whole, owing to the undecayed state
of their bark; but crumbled into powder on being trod upon;
and that the Swedes took the practice from this of covering their
houses with this unperishable bark, on which they sometimes
lay soil, and thus possess aerial gardens. Voyages by Mavor,
Vol. XII.</P>
<P>7. To increase the quantity of bark it must be remembered,
that the leaf-buds, or viviparous offspring of trees, as they form
new buds, acquire new caudexes extending down into the
ground, and thus increase the bark of the stem in thickness;
but the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lower buds acquire no new caudexes, but die, as soon as
they have ripened their seed, and consequently do not increase
the thickness of the bark. Whence one method of increasing
the quantity of the bark is to increase the number or vigour of
the leaf-buds in contradistinction to the flower-buds, which may
be done by pinching off the flowers as soon as they appear; and
as the bark becomes gradually changed into wood, this may be
one method also of forwarding the growth of timber trees, as
mentioned in the next Section.</P>
<P>8. The method of preserving the bark of trees from moss con∣sists
in rubbing off that parasite vegetable in wet weather by means
of a hardish brush; which is said to be used with advantage on
the apple-trees in the cyder countries; and may at the same time
give motion to the vegetable circulation, or forward the ascent
of their juices absorbed by the radical or cortical absorbents. In
dry weather the brush should be frequently dipped in water.
Washing the barks of wall-trees by a water-engine may also faci∣litate
the protrusion of their buds in dry seasons; and might pos∣sibly
prevent the canker, if applied to dwarf or aspallier apple-trees.
Other parasite vegetables must be occasionally destroyed,
where they occur, as the lichens, fungi, misletoes; with the
ivies and other climbers, as some kinds of lonicera, clematis, and
fumaria, woodbine, virgin's bower, and fumitory.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="458"/>
9. When a wound is made in the bark so as to expose the al∣burnum
to the air, the upper lip of the wound is liable to grow
faster downwards, than the lower one is to grow upwards, owing
to the former being supplied directly with nutritive juices secreted
from the vegetable blood, after its ventilation, and consequent
oxygenation in the leaves; whereas the lower lip only receives
those juices laterally by inosculation of vessels. Over these
wounds the cuticle is liable to project, and to supply a convenient
hiding place for insects, which either eat the new fibres of the
growing bark, and perforate the alburnum; or by their moisture,
their warmth, and their excrements, contribute to the decay of
the alburnum, and prevent the healing of the wound. These
dead edges of the projecting bark or cuticle should be nicely cut
off, but not so as to wound the living bark</P>
<P>Plasters of lime or of tar with sublimate of mercury, have
been recommended to preserve the wounded parts from the air,
and from moisture, and from insects; but as all these materials
are injurious to the fibres of the living bark, they should be used
with caution, so as not to touch the edges of the wound, but
only to cover the alburnum; for this purpose white lead and
boiled oil, mixed into a thick paint, or with the addition of sub∣limate
of mercury, or of arsenic, or of spirit of turpentine,
may probably answer the purpose; and may be of real utility on
the wounds of those trees, whose wood contains less acrimony,
and is therefore more liable to be bored into and eaten by a large
worm or maggot almost as thick as a goose quill: which I have
seen happen to a pear tree, so as to consume the whole internal
wood, till the tree was blown down.</P>
<P>In respect to the caution necessary to be observed in not touch∣ing
the living edges of the wounded bark with such materials as
may injure the tree by their absorption, I remember seeing several
young elm trees, which died by their boles having been covered,
as I was informed, by quick-lime mixed with cow-dung to pre∣vent
their being injured by horses; and I have seen branches of
peach and nectarine trees destroyed by sprinkling them, when in
leaf, with a slight solution of arsenic, and others with spirit of
turpentine.</P>

10. A more curious method of cure is said to have succeeded,
where the bark of a tree has recently been torn off even to great
extent, and that is by binding the same piece of bark on again,
or another piece from the same tree, or from one of a similar na∣ture,
nicely adapting the edges of the bark to be applied to the
edges of that, which surrounds the wound of the tree, which it
is said will coalesce in the same manner, as the vessels of the
bark of an ingrafted scion unite with those of the bark of the
stock ingrafted on; which is strictly analogous to the union of
inflamed or wounded parts of animal bodies, as in the cure of
the hare-lip, or the insertion of the living tooth from one
person into the jaw of another, or the factitious noses of Tali∣cotius.</P>
<P>If the bark over the cankered parts of apple-trees could be
thus renewed by paring the edges of the mortified bark to the
quick, and then nicely applying a piece of healthy bark from an
apple-tree of inferior value, and securing it with an elastic ban∣dage,
as a shred of flannel, it would be a very valuable dis∣covery.</P>
<P>Another method, where a branch of a valuable tree is in the
progress of being destroyed by canker, might be by inclosing the
cankered part, and some inches above it, in a garden-pot of
earth previously divided, and supported by stakes, and tied to∣gether
round the branch; which might then strike roots in the
earth of the garden-pot, and after some months might be cut
off, and planted on the ground, and might thus be preserved, and
produce a new tree; which experiment I have this summer tried
on two apple-trees and believe it will succeed.</P>

<HEAD>1. Of Leaves.</HEAD>
<P>1. The buds of plants have already been shewn to be indi∣vidual
vegetable beings, and the leaves to constitute the lungs of
each individual bud. And lastly, that the new bud in the bo∣som
of each leaf is the offspring from the caudex of that old bud,
of which the leaf constitutes the lungs.</P>
<P>The leaves of grasses are of great consequence, as they nou∣rish
many of our domestic quadrupeds; the cultivation of grasses
has therefore been much attended to. Many of these propa∣gate
themselves more by their roots than by their seed; espe∣cially
where their stems are perpetually destroyed by the grazing
of cattle, sheep, or geese; and some of them are said to be vi∣viparous,
as the festuca dumetorum, or fescue grass; that is,
that they bear bulbs on their stems after flowering instead of
seeds, which in time drop off, and strike root into the ground,
like the polygonum viviparum, and the allium magicum; which
circumstance is said to obtain in many alpine grasses, whose seeds
are annually devoured by small birds.</P>
<P>The stems of the grasses consist in general of joint above
joint without lateral branches; each joint of which seems to be
a successive plant growing on the preceding one, and generated in
the bosom of the leaf, which surrounds it; the stem may there∣fore
be esteemed a succession of leaf-buds, till at length a flower-bud
is produced on the summit, as shewn in Sect. IX. 3. 1. In
some grasses, as the agrostis canina, or triticum repens, dog's-grass,
twitch-grass, or couch-grass, the root consists of joints as
well as the stem; which may be considered as separate individual
plants, like the bulbs of potatoes, as every joint of these roots
will grow into a new plant to the great annoyance of the agri∣cultor,
<PB N="457" REF="462"/>
which, when the ground is not hard, may be best I
believe, drawn out by a deep harrow, or by Mr. Cook's scari∣fier;
as a plough turns them over under the soil, as it breaks
them, and thus much increases their number by in a manner
transplanting them. The teeth of the harrow, or scarifier,
should be inclined forwards towards the horse for the purpose of
lifting up the roots, and that it may not too easily rise out of the
soil; and it should be fixed by wedges or screw-nuts to the wooden
frame for the purpose of occasionally lengthening them to adapt
them to different soils, as the roots pierce deeper into less
tenacious soils than into clayey ones.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that a plant of grass consists not only of a
tuft of leaves surrounding the root, but that the three or four
lower joints of the stem, as of a wheat-straw, are so many suc∣cessive
leaf-buds, which are generated by the caudex of the leaf,
which surrounds each joint, and precede the flower-bud at the
summit; and that hence with the design of producing much
herbage for cattle, the propagation of new leaves from the root
is principally to be attended to; but with the design of producing
hay, or winter fodder, the leaf-buds of the stem are principally
to be attended to.</P>
<P>For the former of these purposes the stem of grass should be
eaten down as soon as it rises; whence more grass leaves will
arise from the root; as is well known to those who eat down
the first stem of wheat when it is too luxuriant. For the se∣cond
purpose the leaf-buds, which constitute the stems of grass,
should be cut down, before the flower-stem at the summit has
begun to ripen its seeds; as at that time the sweet juice lodged
in the joint below the flower-stem becomes expended on the
seed; and the stem becomes converted into straw rather than into
hay.</P>
<P>From hence it is readily understood, why those pastures, which
are perpetually grazed, are so much thicker or closer crowded
with grass roots than those, which are annually mowed; and
why grass cut young makes so much sweeter and more nutritive
hay than that, which has ripened and shed its seed. And lastly,
why the hay from grass cut young is so much more liable to take
<PB N="458" REF="463"/>
fire, if ricked too moist; because the greater quantity of sugar
in the joints of the stems produces so violent a fermentation,
when it has sufficient water to dissolve it, that it generates so
much heat as to burst into flame. This might best be prevented,
where chopped straw is designed to be given to horses along
with their hay, by laying alternately in the hay-stack a stratum
of new hay and a stratum of straw, or of clover and straw;
whence the rapid fermentation which occasions combustion, may
be prevented, and the straw may be rendered easier of digestion
by being impregnated with the fermentative infection, or yest,
of the fermenting hay.</P>
<P>The art of increasing the quantity of leaves round the roots of
grasses consists in eating off the central stems by sheep, or horses,
or cattle, early in the season, as above mentioned; whence
new ones are produced around the first joint of the stem thus
bitten off, and from the distant horizontal root-wires of such
grasses, as produce them. In low meadows it is hence doubly
profitable to eat down the early grass till about the middle of
May, as in moist situations there is no danger but a crop of hay
will succeed; which by this method will be finer and more
copious; and at the same time some weeks provender of hay
will have been saved by the use of the early grass.</P>
<P>On land intended for pasture, as for sheep, many people ad∣vise
to sow three kinds of vegetables, which may in some mea∣sure
succeed each other in their growth. Mr. Parkinson sows
four bushels of the seed of rye-grass, lolium perenne, ten pounds
of trefoil seed, trifolium pratense, and ten of white clover, tri∣folium
repens, on every acre; and adds, that the rye-grass
should be eaten early, while the white clover is still concealed in
the ground, and the trefoil makes only some small appearance.
That when the rye-grass is eaten down the trefoil springs up,
and becomes food for the sheep; after which the white clover
succeeds; and alter this is consumed, the rye-grass again springs
up, and supplies food during the winter months, if the weather
proves tolerably mild; and he further asserts, that a third more
of sheep at least may be thus nourished than by any other means.
Experienced Farmer, Vol. I. p. 88.</P>
<P><PB N="459" REF="464"/>
For the production of a meadow much superior to those com∣monly
seen, Mr. Curtis recommends six kinds of grass and two
of clover to be sowed; the seeds are to be mixed together in
the following proportions. Meadow foxtail, alopecurus praten∣sis,
one pint; meadow fescue, festuca pratensis, one pint;
smooth stalked meadow-grass, poa pratensis, half a pint; rough
stalked meadow-grass, poa trivialis, half a pint; crested dog's-tail,
cynosurus cristatus, a quarter of a pint; sweet-scented
vernal grass, anthoxanthum odoratum, a quarter of a pint;
Dutch clover, trifolium repens, half a pint; red clover,
trifolium pratense, half a pint; these seeds are to be mixed
together, and about three bushels to be sown on an acre in rows
for the convenience of hoeing them. About the end of August
or beginning of September they should be occasionally weeded
and thinned, and rolled in the spring, to press down into the
ground such roots as may have been raised by the frost.</P>
<P>Mr. Curtis thinks that meadow foxtail and rough stalked
meadow-grass suit moist soils the best; and that the smooth
stalked meadow-grass and crested dog's-tail suit dry pastures;
and lastly, that the meadow fescue, and the sweet-scented ver∣nal
grass, suit land either moist or moderately dry; and gives
the following order of their times of flowering. 1. Sweet-scented
vernal. 2. Meadow foxtail. 3. Smooth stalked mea∣dow-grass.
4. Rough stalked meadow-grass. 5. Meadow
fescue. 6. Crested dog's-tail. See Hall's Encycloped. Art.
Agriculture.</P>
<P>Not only new sown grasses designed for meadows, but the
larger grasses, which have the names of corn, as wheat, oats,
barley, may be advantageously rolled, when dry, after frost,
which by expanding the water in moist soils lessens the cavities,
which are occupied by roots; and as roots or their branches
are in general conical, they become pushed upwards; and such as
are loose rise quite out of the ground, as is often seen to
happen to the roots of the strawberries, when a frosty night has occurred
soon after their being transplanted. After a slight frost the
larger pebbles of a gravel walk are seen below the surface, as if
they had sunk downwards during the night; whereas this is
owing to a similar cause, the expansion of the moist soil or gravel
an inch deep; but as the frost had not penetrated so low as to
<PB N="460" REF="465"/>
swell the ground beneath the large pebbles, these had not been
lifted up like the smaller ones, on the wet sand.</P>
<P>Secondly, both to increase the quantity of leaves round the
root, and to increase the size or vigour, as well perhaps as the
number, of leaf-buds on the stem, a greater supply of water
than usual, where it can be done, would be advantageous; as
is done to the rice-grounds in warm countries in the early part
of its growth, and as in flooding our own meadows occasionally
in the vernal months. Thus very moist seasons are well known
to forward the luxuriant growth of the herbage, and stems, in
the cultivation of wheat, and to render the ears later, and less
prolific.</P>
<P>Where plants are sown for the purpose of consuming the first
foliage, as grasses or saint-foin, the seed should be sown thicker,
than where the plant is grown for the purpose of producing
seeds, as in wheat or peas: because the quantity of the first
foliage will be greater in respect to number; and the central
parts of the tussocks, as is often seen in wheat and peas, when
sown too thick, will rise two or three inches higher in their
contest for light and air, like the trees of thick planted woods;
and will hence produce a forwarder pasture as well as a more
copious one.</P>
<P>To which should be added, that the plants with succulent
stems, as saint-foin, lucern, red clover, receive so much injury
from the trampling of heavy cattle, that they should be mowed,
and given to cows and horses in their stalls; which should never theless
hare a yard or fold occasionally to run into with the
convenience of water; and if straw be chopped along with this
green food, it might be a cheap and a salutary addition.</P>
<P>Where a piece of grass land is overrun with tussocks of sour
grass, which often happens near towns, I have been informed,
that lime or coal-ashes spread on them would render the grass
sweeter, so that horses or cattle would eat it. But I suppose
the more certain and advantageous management would consist
in mowing it frequently, and giving it to the horses or cattle in
the stable or stall; as I believe they will eat it greedily after it
has been a few hours withered, and thus the land will not only
yield more provender at present, but after a few mowings a
<PB N="461" REF="466"/>
sweeter grass will rise in the place of that which was of a bad
kind, or of too luxuriant growth; for which purpose it should
be mowed as near the ground as may be; or if it be frequently
mowed during the summer, and left on the ground, some cattle
will eat it, when it is withered to a certain degree; by which
the disagreeable flavour of it is probably lessened or destroyed.</P>
<P>The art of making hay consists in evaporating about two
thirds of the weight of it, as observed by Young and Ruckert.
Dr. Hales found a sun-flower plant, which weighed forty-eight
ounces to lose thirty-six ounces by drying in the air during thirty
days; and consequently to have lost three fourths of its weight.
Vegetables to appearance perfectly dry contain three fifths or
three fourths of their weight of water; a part of which water
Mr. Kirwan thinks is not in its liquid state, but that it is by a
loss of much of its specific heat in a great measure solidified.
Kirwan on Manures, p. 37. Thus when water is thrown on
fresh quick-lime, a part of it unites with the lime, and becomes
solid, giving out much heat; which converts another part of it
into steam, as mentioned in Sect. X. 4. 4.</P>
<P>There are two methods of making hay practised in different
parts of the country. In the more southern counties the swarths
are not turned over or scattered for a day, or two, or three,
but remain as they were left by the scythe. In the more nor∣thern
counties the hay-makers follow the mowers, and scatter
the grass immediately, or on the succeeding day. Perhaps a
method between these may in general better suit this climate.</P>
<P>Herbs collected for medicinal purposes, as well as flowers,
should be dried in the shade; otherwise they become bleached,
and lose both their colour and their odour, by too great insola∣tion,
and exhalation. Now if the swarth of cut grass be only
turned over once a day for three or four days, the internal parts
of it may be said to be dried in the shade; and afterwards if it
be spread over the ground for only a few hours on a fine day, I
suppose it would become dry enough to stack, and have lost con∣siderably
less of its nutritive quality. Some advise a chimney to
be left in the center of a stack to prevent the hay taking fire,
but there should then also be culverts under the stack to supply
that chimney with air; which may be made by cutting three or
<PB N="462" REF="467"/>
four trenches in the earth, and covering them with boards or
sticks with their apertures exposed to the wind in all directions.
Perhaps the best way would be to make the stack narrow and long,
and bent into a semicircle or crescent to enable them the better
to resist the winds, instead of round or square, though a greater
surface would indeed be afterwards exposed to the weather, and
in some degree injured, by this mode of construction.</P>
<P>When the grass is spread uniformly over the whole meadow,
which is called <HI>tedding,</HI> it will sooner dry, as so much larger a
surface of it is exposed to the wind and sun; but it should cer∣tainly
be put into small cocks or wind-rows at night, especially
if the weather be moist; because it will otherwise receive much
dirt and slime from the innumerable worms, which rise out of
the ground always in moist warm nights, and generally when
the surface is covered with moist grass at all seasons; and when
they retreat into their subterranean mansions in the morning,
they are liable to draw in the ends of the grass to stop up the
apertures of their holes, and by that means prevent the centipes
from fallowing them into their homes, and destroying them.
See Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XVI. 16. Whence much of the
new hay becomes injured by the soil, they previously push before
them out of their mines and by that which adheres to the grass,
which was drawn in to stop the apertures of them, as well as by
the slime, which they leave behind them on the new hay, which they pass through or over.</P>
<P>On this account hay-cocks should be made as high as may
be in proportion to their base, that less surface may be in con∣tact
with the ground, as well as that a greater surface may be
exposed to the air for a quicker exhalation of its moisture,
and for the purpose of the better securing it from accidental
showers.</P>
<P>In wet seasons, I suspect, the best method must consist in
turning over the rows of swarth every day or every alternate
day, or making it into small cocks, and turning them over in
the same manner, that the rain may not injure the whole of it
by passing perpetually through it, and washing away its saccha∣rine
and mucilaginous fluids; and also that the part next the
ground, and the central parts of the cock or swarth, may not
<PB N="463" REF="468"/>
pass into fermentation and putrefaction. And lastly, when it
can be put into tall cocks, as the weather becomes drier, it will
not only sooner exhale its moisture by the contact of the atmos∣phere,
but a beginning fermentation will set at liberty some de∣gree
of heat, and thus contribute to dry it by increasing the
evaporation; as the great heat generated in hay-stacks which
have been finished but one day or two, assists much to dry the
whole stack in moist seasons, as is seen by the dense steam,
which arises from them.</P>
<P>2. Many root-leaves are consumed at our tables either in
their raw state, as those of water-cress, sisymbrium nasturtium,
lettuce, lactuca fativa, mustard, sinapis, celery, apium; many
others are previously boiled to diminish their acrimony, and to
coagulate their mucilage, as the root-leaves of spinach, spinacia,
of cabbage, brassica oleracea, and even of turnips, brassica rapa;
along with these stem-leaves of many plants the flower-buds at
their summits are eaten, as those of mercury, mercurialis, and
of some of the cabbage kind called brocoli, brassica italica.</P>
<P>Many of these leaves not only consist of a respiratory organ,
but at the lower parts of them especially, or in their stalks, there
exists a reservoir of nutriment for the rising flower-stem or for
the ripening seed, as in rhubarb leaves, and in cabbage leaves,
which is similar to that in the roots of other herbaceous plants,
and which renders them both palatable and nutritive. Most
of these concentric leaves are situated in contact with the earth,
as those of lettuces, lactuca, and salsafi, tragopogon. But others
of them, as the cabbages, are placed on a stem at some distance
from the ground; in the former the upper part of the root or
caudex is palatable and nutritious, as well as the lower part of
the leaves; and some of them are of superior flavour when boil∣ed.
In the latter the reservoir of nutriment for the future
flower-stem and seed consists in the lower part of the ribs of
the concentric foliage, as in the concentric leaves or lamina,
which cover the bulb of the onion, or even in the stalks, as in
cabbages, and artichoke, which are therefore not only esculent,
but palatable and nutritive.</P>
<P>Other leaves are eaten in their early state along with the
stem, which they surround, as asparagus, and the young shoots
<PB N="464" REF="469"/>
of spinach, and of some kinds of brocoli, and of mercury;
which last are sometimes suffered to shew their flowers before
they come to our tables, and are then treated of in Sect. XIX.</P>
<P>The art of cultivating all these consists in supplying them
with abundant carbonic earth, and with abundant moisture, as
these are more friendly to the luxuriant growth of root-leaves
or stem-leaves, than to the production of the flowers, or ripen∣ing
of the seeds, as appears by the too luxuriant growth both
of herbaceous plants and of fruit-trees in moist seasons.</P>
<P>Another method of forwarding the growth of the new leaves
and stem-shoots of perennial herbaceous plants, as of asparagus,
is annually to loosen or turn over the earth around and above the
roots, for the purpose of admitting air into its cells or cavities to
convert a part of the manure or carbonaceous soil, with which
they have been supplied, into ammonia, or into carbonic acid,
and thus both to afford them warmth and nutriment.</P>
<P>Add to this, that the leaves of trees may be increased in size
by lopping off the branches, by which means the remaining buds
acquire more nutriment; the black mulberry tree is thus kept
low, and formed into extensive shrubberies in China for the pur∣pose
of feeding silkworms, as observed by sir G. Staunton, who
thinks the leaves are thus rendered both larger and more succu∣lent;
and adds, that the ash-tree is also sometimes used for the
same purpose.</P>
<P>3. Another method of destroying the too great acrimony of
leaves, besides that of boiling them, consists in secluding them
from light, and is termed etiolation. This is chiefly practised
on cellery, apium, by earthing it up nearly to the top of the
plant; and on sea-kale, crambe maritima, by covering the
plant entirely with horse-litter or straw, as described in Sect.
XIV. 3. 3; and on lettuces, and endive, by tying together the
root-leaves with a bandage.</P>
<P>In many plants the central bud during its early growth seems
to be naturally in a state of etiolation, as it is excluded from
the light by the curvature of the surrounding foliage, as in cab∣bages,
and particularly in some species of aloe, which are said
to consume nearly a century in opening their numerous concentric
foliage. These etiolated leaves, like flowers before the calyx,
<PB N="465" REF="470"/>
is opened, are white; and the leaves become green, or the
flowers of many other colours, when exposed to the light, as
explained in Sect. XIII. 1. 3. It is probable that the foliage
of many other plants might be rendered esculent by thus destroy∣ing
their acrimony, and decreasing the tenacity of their fibres
by e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iolation, as well as the leaves of celery, apium; and car∣doon,
cinara; and of endive, cichorium endivia.</P>
<P>A seclusion from the sun's light and from air has an effect
somewhat similar on animal bodies, rendering them pale and
weak, as may be seen in the etiolated young ladies of some
boarding schools; and in those who pass their waking hours in
unventilated parlours during more than half the night.</P>
<P>4. Other vegetable foliage has been brought into very ex∣tensive
use infused in hot water for its agreeable aromatic or
bitterish flavour, as those of foreign tea, thea; and of the ash,
fraxinus, of our own island, the leaves of which were collect∣ed,
before they became expanded, and sold after being dried
for the inferior kind of Bohea tea in so great quantity as to oc∣casion
an act of parliament to be passed about forty years ago to
lay a sine on any one, who should have accumulated more than
fifty pounds of ash leaves, which were not the produce of
his own trees. The leaves of many other of our domestic ve∣getables,
as of mint, balm, and sage, mentha, melissa, salvia,
have been infused in hot water as an agreeable diluent beverage
both in health and sickness; the last of which, the sage, possesses
a very pleasant aromatic flavour; and if the infusion be poured
from the leaves, before it has acquired too much of the bitter
flavour, it is very grateful to the palate or stomach, and has
been esteemed salubrious from high antiquity to the present
times, whence the line of Horace:</P>
<Q>Cur moriatur homo, eui salvia crescit in horto?</Q>
<P>All these infusions become nutritive, when drank with cream
and sugar, and have certainly contributed to the health of the
inhabitants of this island by decreasing the potation of ferment∣ed
or spirituous liquors; and to their morality by more frequent∣ly
mixing the ladies and gentlemen in the same society.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="471"/>
The leaves of these plants, as well as the aromatic or balsa∣mic
buds of some other plants, as of myrica, gale; of tacama∣haca,
populus balsamifera; of balm of Gilead, amyris giliaden∣sis,
and many others, should be gathered at the time of their
greatest fragrance, as the essential oils, which constitute their
odorous exhalation, perpetually evaporate, as our sense of smell
informs us; and were apparently for the purpose of defending
the plants from the depredation of insects in their state of in∣fancy.</P>
<P>5. Other leaves have been used for medicinal purposes, and
for the arts of dying and tanning, like the barks before men∣tioned
as the leaves of carduus benedictus, enicus acarna, as
an emetic; those of foxglove, digitalis purpurea, as an absor∣bent
in anasarca; those of bog-bean, menyanthes trifoliata, as
a corroborant; which last might probably supply the place of
hops, humulus lupulus, in the breweries of malt-liquors; and as
it might be plentifully cultivated on boggy grounds, which are
not at present used for other purposes, might be a cheaper bitter
to the consumer, and save to the public much more fertile soil
for the cultivation of corn or other valuable vegetables.</P>
<P>The leaves of teucrium scorodonia, wood-sage, are as bitter
as those of menyanthes, bog-bean, and have been used with
success, as I have witnessed, in the cure of agues; and, as it
grows on dry barren soils, might possibly be cultivated to supply
the place of peruvian bark in some diseases, or to supply the use
of hops in the breweries of malt-liquor.</P>
<P>The leaves of oak-trees, quercus robur, and of ash-trees,
fraxinus excelsior, and of alder, betula alnus, even after they
drop spontaneously in the autumn, are said to serve the purpose
of tanning animal membranes, like the barks of the same trees
spoken of Sect. XVII. 3. 5; and for the purposes of dying, the
leaves of indigo, indigofera tinctoria; and of wood, isatis tinc∣toria;
and of weld, reseda luteola, have been much cultivated,
and extensively used; and a species of polygonum is said to be
much cultivated in China for the same purposes as indigofera
by sir G. Staunton; to which may be added the foliage of li∣chen
fructicosus, or archil, a whitish lichen brought from the
rocks of the Canary Islands, which gives a beautiful bloom to
<PB N="467" REF="472"/>
other colours, but is itself very fugitive. Linnens asserts in the
Swedish Transactions, that this archil moss is to be found
on the western coasts of England; and it is said, that the
archil is now prepared by Messrs. Gordens at Leith near
Edinburgh from a species found in the Highlands of Scotland.
Encyclopedia Britannica. Art. Archil. The manner of cultiva∣tion
and of the extraction of the colouring matter from the leaves
of these plants may be also seen in Bomare's Dictionaire Rai∣sonne,
and in Chambers's Encyclopedia. It is probable, that
many other plants, as hedysarum, saintfoin, or the broad
thick leaves of phytolacca, might yield a similar material to
that of indigo, wood, and weld, if properly cultivated and
prepared, as well as other kinds of mosses or lichens to that
above mentioned.</P>
<P>The green colour of perhaps all vegetables, as well as of
those from which indigo and woad are produced, is owing to
the blue fecula, which has been obtained for the dyers princi∣pally
from those plants; and to a yellow material, which is
more fugitive or more easily decomposed, which yellow may
possibly be owing to iron. This blue fecula is simply obtained
from indigo, as it subsides from the fluid, in which the plant is
suffered to ferment; and is obtained from woad along with the
cellular parts of the leaves during their fermentation in water,
and beaten into a mass. It is probable that the bluest kinds of
vegetables may contain the most of this fecula.</P>
<P>For domestic purposes the juice of the sage-leaf, salvia offici∣nalis,
has been used both to give colour and flavour to cheese;
and the juice of spinach is employed, I am informed, to colour
the green usquebaugh, a favourite dram with the Irish vulgar.
And it is probable, that the leaf of the vine, which bears pur∣ple
grapes, might give a similar colour and astringent taste to our
domestic wines, as the skin of the same grape gives to the fo∣reign
wines made from it; since the leaves of this wine always
become quite red in autumn, before they fall, probably by the
concentration of their acidity, as their water evaporates unsup∣plied;
as all blue vegetable juices become green by an admixture
of akali, and red by that of an acid.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="473"/>
6. Another use for which leaves are collected by some gar∣deners,
as they fall in autumn from any kinds of trees, is for
the production of heat by fermentation in hot-houses, or melon-frames,
instead of oak-bark, after its bitter particles have been
much extracted by the tanner; and it is probable, that many
leaves might be selected, as they will thus undergo fermenta∣tion,
which might afford a spirituous drink like small beer with∣out
any disagreeable flavour, or unwolesome material; which
now serve only for manure when gathered into heaps, or by their
slow decay on arable lands; or encumber the grass lands, they
fall upon.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>11. Of Woods.</HEAD>
<P>1. The leaf-buds of trees producing a viviparous offspring
acquire new caudexes, extending from the branches to the
ground, and the intertexture of these caudexes forms the new
bark over the old one. But the flower-buds acquire no new
caudexes down the bark, as their oviparous progeny does not
adhere to the side of the parent bud, but falls down when ma∣ture,
and strikes root into the soil.</P>
<P>Now as the bark of trees is thus produced along with the
leaf-buds, and is it annually becomes alburnum or sap-wood;
and that sap-wood gradually loses all vegetable life, and becomes
heart-wood, in follows, that the art of forwarding the growth
of the wood of trees must consist in producing and nourishing the
leaf-buds.</P>
<P>For this purpose the roots of trees should be supplied with
rather more water, than they generally possess in their most na∣tural
state, or the branches should be sprinkled by a water-en∣gine;
as moisture facilitates the production of the new caudexes
of the new leaf-buds probably by lessening the cohesion of the
cuticle, or mechanically relaxing it, like the cuticle of our
hands when long soaked in water, as well as by supplying them
with more nutriment.</P>
<P>It may sometimes occur, that the cuticle of trees, or exterior
bark, may adhere too strongly, and by not opening in cracks
confine the growth, or prevent the production of the caudexes
<PB N="469" REF="474"/>
of the new buds. There is annually a new cuticle produced
beneath the old ones, as well as a new bark above the old ones;
hence some trees have as many cuticles as they are years old,
others cast them more easily, as a snake casts its cuticle. When
a number of cuticles thus exist one over another, it is useful to
scratch them longitudinally, which will admit the new bark
beneath, consisting of the caudexes of the various buds to swell
out, and form a line more prominent than the other parts of the
trunk of the tree. If crooked young trees be thus scratched
internally in respect to the curvature, and this repeatedly, I
am informed, that they will gradually become straight, by thus
encouraging the growth within the curvature more than on its
convex side.</P>
<P>Another method of increasing the number and vigour of the
leaf-buds, and in consequence of enlarging the wood of a tree,
consists in pinching off the flowers, as soon as they appear; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the nourishment is thus supplied to the leaf-buds by the inoscula∣tion
of the vessels of the bark, which otherwise would have been
expended on the flowers, fruit, and seeds. The truth of this
circumstance is not only countenanced by gardeners, who pull off
the flowers of fruit-trees lately planted to encourage their
growth, but also from the appearance of sickly trees; which are
liable to perish, when in flower. In this case it often happens,
that, after the flowers fade, some of the leaf-buds continue to
expand, or new ones put out, owing to the supply of nutriment
not being now expended on the flowers.</P>
<P>2. As tall timber trees without branches, and consequent
knots in the timber, are most valuable except for ship-building,
this may be certainly effected by planting them near each other;
as then the powerful contest with each other for light and
air propels them upwards, instead of producing many lateral
branches; as may be seen in many woods, which have not been
too much thinned. For this purpose some have planted trees of
less value though of quicker growth, as pines, amongst oaks;
which may be pruned or lopped, if they shade the oaks too
much, and may be finally removed, when the oaks are crowded
by them; whence single trees seldom grow so tall as those in
woods, and appear stunted, as it is called; which is generally
<PB N="470" REF="475"/>
ascribed to the cold seasons, or to their being exposed more to
the winds; which may perhaps sometimes happen in this nor∣thern
climate; or where trees are exposed to insalubrious air, as near
the sea; or exist in colder situations, as on the summits
of mountains.</P>
<P>Something similar to this may be seen in tussocks of grass, or
where too many seeds of wheat have been sown near together.
The central part of the knot of wheat or grass grows much tal∣ler
than the external part, so as to give it a conical figure;
which has been by some ascribed to the central part having been
sheltered from the cold by the external ring, but is more gene∣rally
owing to the struggle of the internal stems, for the acqui∣sition
of light and air.</P>
<P>The Society of Agriculture at Copenhagen, has proposed
prizes concerning the cultivation of timber for ship building.
One question is, whether the necessary form and degree of
flexion can by any means be given to growing timber without
injuring it? This I imagine may be done by annually scratching
the external bark or cuticle either longitudinally or horizontally
on the south side of the part of a tree, which is wished to be
curved, as the south side of trees are known to grow faster
annually than the north side, as is seen by the greater thickness
of the concentric rings of a tree, when felled and sawed into
blocks; and because the cuticle bounds the lateral growth of the
trunks of trees, as the skin of animals bounds the growth of the
cellural parts beneath it; and hence that side of the tree where
the cuticle or exterior bark is frequently scratched through, will
become larger than the other side of the tree, and tend to bend
it into a curve with the scratched side outwards. Trees also
on the outside rows of woods will spontaneously bend outwards
for light and air, and may I suspect be more easily formed into
proper curves by the method above proposed. And where
trees in a wood are at a proper distance from each other, they
may forcibly be bent by cordage towards each other, and then
by wounding the exterior and interior bark longitudinally, or
perhaps horizontally also on the exterior side of the curved part
of the tree, they may be brought into almost any degree of flexure,
which they will afterwards preserve as the tree advances.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="476"/>
Some of the quicker growing trees may be more valuable to
the planter than oaks, and some in different soils are more valua∣ble
than others; as willow-trees in the hedge-rows in moist
grounds are said, if headed once in ten years, on an average to
produce each of them one shilling a year. Perhaps the ozier
for basket making may be still more advantageous in low grounds;
there is a valuable paper on the planting of them and the choice
of the kinds of them in the Transactions of the Society of Arts,
Vol. XVI. p. 129, by Mr. Phillips. Perhaps the sugar-maple may
also be cultivated in this climate to advantage on many barren com∣mons,
as on Cannock Heath And certainly pines, as Scotch fir,
might in these situations succeed astonishingly, as appears by the
plantations of Mr. Anson on the barren mountains near his seat
in Staffordshire; and also from the plantations of the marquis of
Bath at the foot of Wiltshire Downs near Warminster, whose
steward, Mr. Davis, has given a valuable account of the profit
of planting Scotch fir in preference to other timber trees; and
finally asserts, “that although fir-timber is worth individually
more per tree than oak or beech of the same size, these trees will
nevertheless grow faster and thicker together than any other
trees. Four firs will grow, where but one oak or beech will
grow; for firs are the better, and deciduous trees the worse,
for being crowded.” I suppose because the branches of the latter
are valuable, but the former is injured by the knots left in the
trunk, where large branches have existed. Trans. of Society of
Arts, Vol. XVI. p. 126.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis adds further, I suppose from his own observation,
that “the chalk-hills in Hampshire are peculiarly proper for
beech; the flinty loams and clays of the same county for oaks
and ash; the mossy steep fides of the Wiltshire Downs for hazel;
the rugged and almost naked rocks of Mendip in Somersetshire
near Chedder produce the lime-tree and the walnut in the greatest
luxuriance; and on the highest parts of the same Mendip hills,
where no other tree, can stand the sea-breeze, sycamore flou∣rishes
as well as in the most fertile vallies. But taking into con∣sideration
the general demand of countries, and the peculiarities
of different soils, no kind of wood is so generally profitable for
planting in coppices as ash.” <HI>Ib.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="477"/>
3. Another thing concerning timber-trees, which ought to be
attended to, is the injury, they are liable to receive from lightning;
which, I am informed, is much more frequent than is generally
supposed; insomuch that in felling most woods, especially those
which grow in wet situations, very many of the trees are found
to be cracked longitudinally to the great injury of the timber;
to prevent this, pointed wires, as thick as a goose quill,
should be attached to a few of the tallest trees of all flourishing woods
reaching above their summits, as conductors of lightning. Add
to this that the holes made by wood-peckers, I am told, are
very numerous, and do much injury to the timber of our fo∣rests,
which can only be prevented by destroying that beautiful
and ingenious bird.</P>
<P>4. Woods differ from each other in many respects, and are
therefore used for many other purposes besides mechanical ones;
as in colour; whence particular woods are chosen for their beauty
in the construction of the furniture of houses, as rose-wood, as∣palathus;
others are used in the art of dying, as the Campechy
wood, haematoxylum, and saunders, santalum, and pterocarpus;
and several others. Other woods differ in their medicinal pro∣perties,
as guaicum, quaffia, Campechy wood, and sassafras.
Others differ in their chemical properties, affording esssential oils,
as oleum rhodii, and turpentines or balsams, and tat; and in their
restringency, as the oak.</P>
<P>5. The oak probably contains much gallie acid, such as has been
extracted from the galls occasioned on their leaves by the
punctures or insects; whence oak boards are said to corrode the
sheets of lead, which are laid on them, and are hence believed
to be improper for the gutter-boards on the roofs of houses. But
the sap-wood, or external part of all timber, I suspect, must be
improper for this purpose on another account; as, when confined
from much air by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of lead over it, it must lie for many
months in the year in that state of moisture, which will favour
the fermentation of the saccharine matter, which all sap-wood
contains; and will thence be subject to the dry rot, as it is
called by architects. This may be long prevented by leaving
proper holes in the walls of all sides the building immediately
under the roof, as has been generally done by those itinerant
<PB N="473" REF="478"/>
bodies of architects, who shewed such prodigies of genius in
the construction of cathedrals in this island, and all over Eu∣rope;
and whose secret identifying words, and confederate
signs, which were necessary to them in foreign countries, whose
language they had not time to acquire, seems to have given origin
to the modern mysteries of Free-masonry.</P>
<P>The rot of wood might probably be entirely prevented by
soaking dry timber first in lime-water, till it has absorbed as
much of it as may be; and then after it is dry by soaking it in a
weak solution of vitriolic acid in water; which will unite with
the lime already deposited in the pores of the timber, and con∣vert
it into gypsum; which I suppose will not only preserve it
from decay for many centuries, if it be kept dry, but also render
it less inflammable, a circumstance worthy attending to in the
construction of wood-built houses. I also conceive that beams
so impregnated would be less liable to swag, and boards so pre∣pared
less liable to warp. In the immense salt-mines of Hungary
many large wooden props, which support the roof, and are per∣petually
moistened with salt water trickling down them, are said
to have suffered no decay for many centuries.</P>
<P>6. Woods also differ from each other in their hardness, or
the general cohesion of their particles, whence one kind of timber
has obtained the name of iron wood, sideroxylum. Others
differ in the sineness of their constituent fibres, which shew a
beautifully smooth polish, when planed, as rose wood, aspala∣thus.</P>
<P>Where these two properties of hardness and smoothness exist
together, as in box, buxus sempervirens, the wood must be pe∣culiarly
valuable for the purpose of making wooden printing
blocks, so well managed at this time by Mr. Bewick of New∣castle
in his books of Natural History of Quadrupeds and Birds.</P>
<P>7. Other woods differ in their durability, as cypress, cedar,
mahogany, are said to be indistructible by time, or by the de∣predation
of insects. The wood of the cedar of Bermudas,
Juniperus Bermudiana, in which black lead pencils are inclosed,
is said not to be eaten by either aerial, terrestrial, or marine in∣sects,
and is thence used in the West Indies for building ves∣sels,
<PB N="474" REF="479"/>
whose bottoms are not penetrated by sea-worms. The un∣perishable
chests which contain the Egyptian mummies, were of
cypress, as well as the coffins in which the Athenians are said by
Thucydides to have buried their heroes. The gates at St.
Peter's at Rome, which had lasted from the time of Constantine
to that of Pope Eugene the fourth, that is eleven hundred years,
ware of cypress, and had at that time suffered no decay.</P>
<P>Of these some are believed to endure longer in water than
others, as alder, be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>la alnus, and is therefore esteemed prefera∣ble
for piles to guard the banks of rivers. But Mr. Brindly, the
conductor of the grand trunk canal, assured me, that he be∣lieved
from observation, “that red Riga deal, or pine-wood,
would endure as long as oak in all situations,” owing perhaps to
its being so full of resin or turpentine.</P>
<P>8. Other woods differ in the degree of the lateral adhesion of
their longitudinal fibres, as the fir-wood, or deal, pinus, whence
the timber readily splits by wedges. As the moisture of the at∣mosphere
is absorbed into the pores of the dry cellular membrane,
which connects the longitudinal fibres of these woods, more than
into those of the longitudinal fibres themselves, they become
much more dilated laterally than extended longitudinally, by the
change of a dry atmosphere to a moist one; whence by joining
pieces of deal cut cross-wise into a rod of some feet in length,
a very sensible creeping hygrometer was made by Mr. Edgeworth,
described in the Botanic Garden, Vol. II. note on Impatiens.
And as this wood is not liable to be much extended by low de∣grees
of heat, when it is impregnated with boiling oil, or co∣vered
with varnish, to prevent the access of aerial moisture, the
pendulums of time-keepers have been constructed of it, which
have not perceptibly lengthened in any variations of the heat or
moisture of the atmosphere.</P>
<P>9. Another circumstance of great consequence, in which woods
differ, is their specific gravity, as many of them will sink in
water, as oak after it has been long moistened; and others will
swim with much of their contents above water, as deal, and
hence have been used for the construction of rafts for the pur∣poses
of rude navigation; and which are now said to be con∣structed
in France as engines of war, probably for the design of
<PB N="475" REF="480"/>
suddenly landing troops, horses, artillery, and provisions, from
the ships of invading armies on dangerous shores, and for the
certainty of re-embarking them. These nevertheless can not car∣ry
great burthens simply by their specific levity; but if each piece
of timber could be made hollow, and rendered water-tight, so as
to contain air, which might probably be done by boring them,
and plugging up the ends; or by joining thick boards together
by means of paint and flannel, or caoutchouc, so as to construct
long square wooden troughs filled with air, perhaps eight or ten
inches diameter within, and twenty or thirty feet long. If the
junctions of these could be rendered water-tight, and a number
of such hollow trunks could be chained loosely together, and
laid cross-wise three or four times over each other, they might
carry very large burthens, not easily to be destroyed by storms,
or sunk by cannon shot.</P>
<P>10. Another difference of the longitudinal sibres of timber
consists in their degree of elasticity, a circumstance of much
greater consequence to our ancestors in respect to the art of war
than to the present generation; as their bows for discharging ar∣rows,
and the catapulta, or engine for throwing stones, depended
on the recoil of rods or beams of timber forcibly bent into a
curve. For the construction of bows the yew-tree, taxus, was
used in this island, and was planted in church-yards, probably
for the purpose of supplying the youth of the parish with bows,
that they might become expert in the use of them; many of
which have acquired extreme old age, and remain to this day.</P>
<P>11. When tall trees are designed to be transplanted for the
purpose of ornamenting a pleasure ground, it is proper to dig a
circular trench round them two or three feet deep in the early
spring; whence many new roots will shoot from those, which
have their ends cut off, and thus the ball of earth will be better
held together, when the tree is removed in the succeeding au∣tumn,
and the tree by having previously produced so many more
fine absorbent radicles will be more certain to grow in its new
situation.</P>
<P>Hence when new grafted fruit-scions on young stocks are de∣signed
to remain a few years in the nursery, before they are de∣signed
for sale, some provident gardeners I am told transplant
<PB N="476" REF="481"/>
them every two years, that the root-fibres may be more numer∣ous
in a small compass, which occasions them to grow, when
finally transplanted, with more certainty, and with greater vi∣gour.</P>
<P>As transplanted trees should not be set too deep in the ground,
as their growth is then always much checked, as explained in
Sect. XV. 2. 4. they generally require some kind of props to pre∣vent
them from being overturned, or much shook by the winds,
before they have sufficiently extended their roots. As the bark
is the only living part of the tree, it is liable to receive much in∣jury
from its confusion by the pressure of the props against it, or
by the strangulation of the bandage which holds it to them.
Hence as the internal wood of a tree is not alive, I remember
many years ago that I fastened one prop by a strong nail to each
fruit-tree of a small orchard, which I then planted; and found
the tree supported with much less apparent injury than in the
usual manner by three props and adapted cordage.</P>
<P>12. The time for felling timber has generally been in the win∣ter
season, when labourers could best be spared from other rural
employments, and from the architecture of towns; but it was
long ago observed by Mr. S. Pepys in a paper published in the
Philosoph. Transact. Vol. XVII. p. 455, that the best time for
felling oaks for ship-building was after having taken off the bark
in the early spring, and having suffered the new foliage to put
forth and die. For by the pullulation of the new buds the sac∣charine
matter in the sap-wood or alburnum is expended, and it
then becomes nearly as hard and durable as the heart-wood,
being both less liable to decay, or to be penetrated by insects;
which was a curious and ingenious discovery at that time, though
the theory was not well understood; the truth of which has now
been established, I believe, by the experience of a century.</P>
<P>As the bark of trees annually changes into alburnum or sap-wood,
so the alburnum annually changes into lifeless wood;
whence the concentric rings, which are seen in the trunks of
trees, when they are felled, are annually produced; and are said
generally to be thicker on that side of the trunk, which grows
towards the south, than on the northern side, and thicker in the
fume<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s most favourable to vegetation than the contrary. These
<PB N="477" REF="482"/>
rings, as they lose their vegetable life, and at the same time a
part of their moisture by evaporation, or absorption, gradually
become harder and of a darker colour; insomuch that by count∣ing
their number, it is said, that not only the age of the tree,
but that the mildness or moisture of each summer during the time
of its growth may be estimated by the respective thickness of the
rings of timber.</P>
<P>13. In the same manner the central pith also loses its vegeta∣ble
life, probably after the first year; and then gradually be∣comes
absorbed, or so impregnated with ligneous particles, as
not to be distinguished from the surrounding wood. The pith
of a young bud so resembles the brain and spinal marrow of ani∣mals
in respect to its central situation, that it probably gives out
nerves to every living sibre of the bud; though these have yet
escaped our eyes and glasses; and thus furnishes the power of
motion, as well as of sensation, to the various parts of the ve∣getable
system. One curious fact, which I have observed, seems
to countenance this conjecture; which is, that the pith of a last
year's twig communicates to the leaves on each side of it, but not
to the new buds in the bosoms of those leaves; because those new
buds are each an individual being, generated by the caudex of the
leaf, and must therefore possess a sensorium of its own. See Sect.
I. 8. and IX. 2. 4.</P>
<P>The pith of trees contains much mucilage, as well as the stalks
of annual and perennial plants, whether they are hollow or not;
the pith of a palm-tree, cycas circinalis, is softened with water,
and passed through sieves, and thus forms the sagoe of our shops;
it is possible the large pith of the stalks of artichokes, cinara sco∣lymus,
might be manufactured into a similar kind of tasteless mu∣cilage;
and the pith of the young shoots of elder, sambucus ni∣gra,
might also possibly be made into tasteless mucilage, if pre∣viously
agitated in cold water to wash away any acrid material,
as in the preparation of starch.</P>
<P>14. When we contemplate the manner of the production of
the internal wood of trees from the induration of the sap-wood,
and the annual increase of the sap-wood from the bark, which was
previously generated by the caudexes of the numerous buds;
there would appear to be no natural boundary to the growth of
<PB N="478" REF="483"/>
trees. But that their trunks, though a mile distant from each
other, might be enlarged, till they meet together, and cover the
whole earth with ligneous mountains constructed by successive ge∣nerations
of vegetable buds; as some parts of the ocean are
crowded with calcareous rocks, fabricated by the successive ge∣nerations
of coralline insects!</P>
<P>A very large tree is described by Mr. Adanson in Africa,
which is called by Linneus Adansonia, in honour of that philo∣sopher;
of which he says the diameter of the trunk frequently
exceeds twenty-five feet, and the horizontal branches are from
forty-five to fifty-five feet long, and so large, that each branch is
equal to the largest tree in Europe. The breadth of the top is
from 120 to 150 feet; and one of the roots bared only in part
by the washing away of the earth by the river, near which it grew,
measured 110 feet long, and yet these stupendous trees do not
exceed 70 feet in height. Voyage to Senegal.</P>
<P>And in this country, when the internal wood is gradually de∣tached
from the alburnum, as it decays, as in some old hollow
oaks and willows, so that it does not destroy the tree by the
putrid matter being absorbed, there seems to be no termination
of the growth of the external remains of the tree, till the wind
blows it down from its want of solid wood to support it. Of
this kind of hollow tree a remarkable instance remains in Wel∣beck
Park in Nottinghamshire, through the middle of which a
coach is said to have been driven. There is another oak of un∣common
dimensions in the forest of Needwood, called Swilcar
oak, celebrated in an unpublished poem by Mr. Mundy, on his
leaving that forest, and is there said to be 600 years old.</P>
<P>But the caudexes of buds, which compose the barks and af∣terwards
the timber of trees, differ from the nests or cells of the
coralline insects, which compose their calcareous rocks beneath
the waves, in this circumstance. The cells of the coralline in∣sects,
like the shells of other sea-animals, become harder by time,
changing by slow degrees the phosphoric acid, which they con∣tain,
for carbonic acid; and some of them afterwards for siliceous
acid, and are thus converted into limestone and flint, and remain
eternal monuments of departed animal life.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="484"/>
Whilst the remaining vascular system, after the death of vege∣table
buds, like the flesh of animals, undergoes in process of time
a chemical decomposition, and loses by fermentation and putre∣faction
both their carbonic and phosphoric acids, which proba∣bly
gave them their solidity, and crumble into dust; which is
seen in the rotten trunks of trees, which lose so much of
their carbon as they decay; and also become luminous, when ex∣posed
to the air by the escape or production of phosphoric acid.
And finally, their other component parts are separated by elu∣triation,
and form morasses; whence coals, iron, clay, and
sandstone; all which are found on the lime-rocks, which were
previously generated in the ocean, and remain eternal monuments
of departed vegetable life. Whence it appears, that a boundary
is set to the size of trees by their internal decay, but none to the
growth of coral-rocks, which are so formidable in the naviga∣tion
of the southern ocean.</P>

<HEAD>15. Question on the cultivation of Timber.</HEAD>
<P>The political advantage or disadvantage of cultivating timber
in this island should be here considered. In the present insane
state of human society, when war and its preparations employ
the ingenuity and labour of almost all nations; and mankind
destroy or enslave each other with as little mercy, as they de∣stroy
and enslave the bestial world; and may in time for what
appears to the contrary, return to their savage state, and begin
to eat each other again, as seems to have occured at or before
the commencement of almost all civil societies; the first political
attention should certainly in this period of human infatuation be
employed to strengthen the country, to enable it to repel the in∣vasion
of foreign enemies, and to defend its natural rights,
when they are infringed by them; but not to attack or invade
other nations for any predatory or ambitious purpose. The
next important thing should be for this nation to set a great
example of justice and humanity to all contending nations, and
thence again to introduce truth and virtue into the world with
peace and happiness in their train.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="485"/>
Now as the power to resist invasion, and to defend our na∣tural
rights, when infringed by foreign enemies, must depend
more on the number of men than on the number of trees; there
need be no hesitation in determining that those lands which can
be employed in the present production of vegetable or animal
food, should not be occupied in the tedious cultivation of future
timber.</P>
<P>But that, as the summits of this country consist principally
of a ridge of mountains extending from south to north between
the eastern and western seas, as those of the Peak of Derbyshire
and the Moorlands of Staffordshire, which are so bleak or so
barren as to be totally unfit for the plough or for pasturage, and
yet might be employed for raising variety of timbers; which

from the extremity of Cornwall to the extremity of Scotland,

as experience has shewn them to be capable to sustain, and
which may be best adapted to the construction of ships.</P>

<P>THE beautiful colours of the petals of flowers with their po∣lished
surfaces are scarcely rivalled by those of shells, of feathers,
or of precious stones. Many of these transient beauties, which
give such brilliancy to our gardens, delight at the same time the
sense of smell with their odours; yet have they not been exten∣sively
used as articles either of diet, medicine, or the arts. For
the purpose of cultivation they may be divided into those imme∣diately
derived from seeds, those from buds, and those from roots;
to which may be added the esculent and medicinal
ones, and those used in the arts.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>I. Flowers from Seeds.</HEAD>
<P>1. The eye of the florist is frequently delighted with double
flowers, which shew a greater blaze of colour in a small space,
and continue some weeks longer in blow than single ones; and,
though they are properly called vegetable monsters by the bota∣nists,
may give information to the philosopher in respect to the
sexual generation of vegetables. The method therefore of pro∣ducing
double flowers from seeds is a matter of importance, as
well as the art of giving to both these and the single flowers their
most healthy expansion, and the greatest brilliancy and variety
of their colours</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="489"/>
Though those multiplied flowers, which are said to be full,
possess no stamens, or pistils, and consequently can produce no
seeds; yet are they frequently raised immediately from seeds;
for those flowers, which are cultivated with more manure, mois∣ture,
and warmth, than is natural, become more vigorous and
larger, and at the same time are liable to shew a tendency to
become double, by having one or two supernumerary petals
in each flower, as the stock July-flower, cheiranthus, and ane∣mone.
And what is truly curious, this tendency to duplicature
is communicated to the seeds of those individual blossoms; inso∣much
that florists are directed to tie a thread round such flowers,
which have a supernumerary petal, to mark them, and to collect
their seeds separately; which are said uniformly to produce
double or full flowers, if cultivated as above with rather more
manure, moisture, and warmth, than those plants have naturally
been accustomed to.</P>
<P>The analogy of this circumstance with the hereditary diseases
of animals is truly wonderful; as the children of those parents,
who have acquired the gout or dropsy by intemperance in the
use of fermented or spirituous potations, become afflicted with
those diseases, as I have frequently observed, in a much greater
degree by the same quantity of intemperance, which originally
produced them in their parents; or they acquire the same quan∣tity
of those diseases by a less degree of intemperance, than oc∣casions
them in others, whose parents have not used fermented
or spirituous liquors to excess.</P>
<P>The luxuriance of flowers, which is believed to arise from
their cultivation in more nutritive soils with greater moisture,
and warmth, consists in the increase of some parts of the flower,
and the consequent exclusion of others; and is distinguished by
Linnaeus into the multiplication and plenitude of flowers, and
into proliferous ones. Multiplied flowers consist of double, tri∣ple,
or quadruple corols; but full flowers are so multiplied as
to exclude the stamina; while in proliferous ones other flowers
arise from within the principal flower, and frequently from its
center. Philos. Botan. p. 80.</P>
<P>It is supposed that the stamina of some double flowers are converted into petals; but on examination, I suspect that the
<PB N="485" REF="490"/>
number of petals is increased, and the stamina prevented from
growing by being compressed by them in their nascent state;
as in many of them, I believe, the rudiments of some stamina
may be seen, as in ranunculus. So when a new flower rises in
the center of the old one, it is supposed, that the pistillum is
converted into the stem of a new flower, as in proliferous daisy,
bellis prolifera; but I suspect, that the pistillum is prevented
from rising by the immoderate growth of the new flower-stem;
as in some of them, I am told, the rudiment of the pistillum
may be perceived.</P>
<P>Thus monopetalous flowers are doubled or multiplied by the
increased divisions of the limb, as observed by Linnaeus, Philos.
Botan. p. 83, who adds, that the metamorphosis of English
soapwort is very singular, as its five petals are transformed
into one petal, and that in opulus flore globoso the cen∣tral
florets become similar to those of the circumference,
acquiring wheeled corols, and being barren: in these cases the
stamens cannot be changed into corols, as the number of corols
is not increased. Afterwards, in p. 84, the same illustrious
author observes, that in double lychnis the rudiment of the com∣mon
pistil is present.</P>
<P>The luxuriance of flowers therefore consists in the multipli∣cation
of the corols or nectaries, which last are properly an
appendage to the former; and the prevention of the growth of
the male and female organs is the consequence. Thus the flower
of aquilegia, columbine, has three kinds of plenitude: 1. the pe∣tals
become multiplied, and the nectaries excluded; 2. the
nectaries are multiplied, and the petals excluded; 3. the nec∣taries
are multiplied, the petals remaining. So that there are
five petals, and between each of these three nectaries, which
exist within each other.</P>
<P>A curious analogy here also exists between these vegetable
monsters and those of the animal world; as a duplicature of
limbs frequently attends the latter, as chickens and turkeys with
four legs and four wings, and calves with two heads. And in
mules the parts subservient to generation become deficient,
whence they cannot propagate their species; exactly as in these
full flowers, which can thence produce no seed. And in respect
<PB N="486" REF="491"/>
to botanic systems, it may be observed from these vegetables of
luxuriant growths, that the stamens and pistils are less liable to
change than the corols and nectaries, and are therefore more
proper parts for the classification of plants; on which idea Lin∣naeus
has constructed his unrivalled system. And lastly that
the calyx, or perianth, is the next most unchangeable part of
the flower, as this is seldom doubled or multiplied; and that
hence by inspecting the calyx the genera of many double flowers
may be detected; thus the double ranunculus possesses a calyx,
but the double anemone is without one, like the single ones of
those genera.</P>
<P>The greater duration of double flowers than single ones is so
remarkable in some poppies, that their single flowers lose the
corolla in a few hours, while in the double ones it continues
several days: this circumstance is well worthy the attention of
those, who cultivate poppies for the purpose of wounding the
head, which incloses the seeds, for the opium, which thus ex∣sudes.
As poppies with double flowers may probably be capa∣ble
of yielding opium, before they shed their flowers, and as
long as other poppies, after they shed them, Dr. Smith ascribes
this event to the organs of reproduction being obliterated, and
the consequent want of impregnation; by the great stimulus of
which he thinks the vegetable irritability may be sooner exhaust∣ed
in single flowers: and adds, “that on the same account
many plants resist a greater degree of cold for several winters
before flowering; but after that event they perish at the first
approach of cold, and can by no art be preserved so as to sur∣vive
the winter.” And repeats an observation from Linnaeus,
that the pistilla of the female hemp, cannabis, continued much
longer to exist when not exposed to the male pollen, than those
pistilia on which the pollen had been effused. Tracts on Nat.
Hist. p. 177.</P>
<P>It may be observed, that many insects may be called annual
ones as well as many vegetables, and die, as soon as they have
provided the eggs or seeds for the reproduction of their species,
as the silkworm, and I suppose, all the kinds of moths and but∣terflies;
many of which take no food at all, after they have ac∣quired
their organs of generation and their amatorial passion,
<PB N="487" REF="492"/>
and yet appear fat and active; and others live only upon honey,
and seem to die as soon as that passion is gratified, probably from
having no further pleasurable stimulus to excite the animal
power into activity, rather than from its total exhaustion; be∣cause
other animals, whose existence is not naturally so short,
are not injured or destroyed by the moderate use of the powers
of reproduction; and that power leaves them long before their
death. An experiment to shew, whether the moths of silk∣worms
would live longer if deprived of their paramours, might
be worth the attention of naturalists; and also, whether the
butterflies of our climate might not be preserved during the
winter, if fed with honey like bees, and kept from excessive
cold. I directed some honey to be offered to the silkworm-butterflies,
which they would not attend to, though they may
probably seek for it in their native climates.</P>
<P>2. Varieties in the colours of single flowers raised from seeds
may probably be generally acquired by sowing near together
those of the same species, which already possess different co∣lours;
so that during the dispersion of their anther-dust by the
wind, or otherwise, they may intermix and adulterate each
other. Or this may be more certainly effected by bending the
flowers of one colour, and shaking the anther-dust over
those of another colour. In this manner, I suppose, it happens, that
the beds of centaurea cyanus become of such various and beau∣tiful
shades of blues, purples, and whites.</P>
<P>Another method of giving variety of colours to seedling
flowers consists in sowing them on natural soils, or on factitious
composts, which differ much from each other in respect to vege∣table
nutriment, and perhaps in respect to their colour, as some
animals change their natural colours whenin different situations
of soil. As frogs much resemble the colour of the soil on which
they live, and our domesticated horses, dogs, cats, rabbits,
pigeons, and poultry, change their colours into endless varieties,
owing to the difference of their nutriment or situation. But
observations and experiments are wanting on this subject in re∣spect
to the colours of seedling flowers, as well as in respect to
the variegation of the leaves of shrubs and trees; which last ori∣ginates
<PB N="488" REF="493"/>
probably from soil or situation, and may be propagated
by ingrafting.</P>
<P>As the origin of double flowers is believed to result from the
luxuriant growth of the plant, owing to too much nourishment,
moisture, and warmth, so the origin of new colours in flowers,
and of variegated foliage, is thought to occur from the innutri∣tion
of the soil, on which they grow, compared to that which
they have naturally been accustomed to, or from defect of mois∣ture
and of heat; which is countenanced by the dwarfish size
of such plants in general, and especially by the lessened stature
of tulips, when their petals break into variety of colours.</P>
<P>The proximate cause of the change of colours in flowers or
foliage must be sought from the modern acquisitions of aerial
chemistry. The presence of oxygen gas deprives dead vegeta∣ble
fibres, as cotton-wool and the threads of flax, of their co∣lour;
that is, it bleaches them; which is probably owing to
its uniting with the colouring matter and forming a new acid,
which is transparent. Thus the hyper-oxygenated muriatic
acid almost instantaneously deprives cotton and linen of their
colour; and the sun's light on moistened linen spread upon the
ground seems to decompose the water, and the oxygen thus
detached whitens the linen. The etiolation or blanching of
living vegetables on the contrary seems to originate from the
want of the sun's light to convert into gas the fluid oxygen;
which, by dissolving their colouring matter, and forming new
and perhaps tasteless acids, deprives them of colour. Hence
the water, which vegetables perspire in the sunshine, becomes
hyper-oxygenated, which has much puzzled philosophers to
account for; and the oxygen rises from it without decomposing
it; which last circumstance is evinced by the total absence of the
smell of hydrogen, which so powerfully affects our nostrils, when
a spoonful of water is thrown on burning coals.</P>
<P>Now as plants, which grow less vigorously from defect of
nutriment, moisture, air, or warmth, may acquire or possess
less oxygen to dissolve their colouring matter, their structure may
approach towards that of dead vegetables; and hence they may
become bleached instead of coloured by the influence of the sun's
light, especially in those parts where their vital functions are
<PB N="489" REF="494"/>
performed with less vigour; so an etiolated vegetable, as a
blanched plant of celery, apium graveolens, becomes green in
a few days, when exposed to the light and air; and white again,
if deprived of life, and exposed to the sunshine and dews.</P>
<P>The immediate cause of the various colours of some flowers,
as of poppies, might be a subject of curious investigation. I
once supposed, that the thinness of the pellicle of some flowers
might occasion them to reflect different colours, as is seen on
dropping a drop of oil from a bridge on the water below on a
bright day. But colours thus produced vary with the situation
of the observer, in respect to the obliquity or angle of reflection,
in which they are seen; and are thence variable with every
motion of them, as those colours seen on soap-bubbles, and on
mother-pearl, and on the Labradore-stone, and on some silks.
For those colours depend on the thinness of the reflecting sur∣face,
which when seen more obliquely become thicker; and
then reflects those colours, which passed through thinner plates;
in the same manner as the red light of the setting sun is reflected
from glass windows, seen very obliquely by the observer.</P>
<P>The colours of flowers therefore, as they are not variable by
the obliquity, with which they are seen, like those of mother-pearl
card-fish, do not depend on the thinness of their pellicle;
but, I suppose, to the greater facility that some parts of them
possess in parting with their oxygen, when exposed to the sun's
light, than other parts of them; for all flowers are more or less
etiolated, before they first open. In the silk manufactory a
variable colour is produced by making the warp of one colour
and the woof of another; perhaps the variable colour of a pea∣cock's
tail may be owing to a mixture of different coloured
down placed in lines near each other.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>II. Flowers from Buds.</HEAD>
<P>1. The flowers arising from the buds of shrubs or trees are
liable to become double or full by the multiplication of their
petals, as those of roses, cherries, hawthorn, peach, rosa, pru∣nus,
cerasus, crategus oxyacantha, amygdalus persica. Which
tendency to duplicature, as in the flowers of annual plants, is
<PB N="490" REF="495"/>
probably owing to the too vigorous growth of the bud from a
too nutritious soil, or the combination of abundant moisture and
warmth, and would probably be forwarded by surrounding the
bud itself frequently with water; as is so beautifully seen in those
plants, which have a cup round their joints to preserve for a
time the rain, which falls upon them, as round the joints of
dypsacus, teasel, silphium, tillandsia, and nepenthes.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that though the duplicature of many flowers
is believed to have been owing to the more nutritious soil, in
which they have been cultivated, yet that, when transplanted
into less fertile soils, or ingrafted on less luxuriant trees, they
still retain their tendency to duplicature, which can only be as∣cribbed
to the continuance of an acquired habit, or to the succes∣sion
of hereditary diseases, so frequently observed in the animal
system.</P>
<P>This duplicature of flowers from buds is generally propagated
by ingrafting the scions of such, as bear multiplied petals, on
similar plants, which bear single flowers; and may be of service
not only for beauty, but for the purpose of increase in those
plants, the petals of whose flowers are consumed for any pur∣pose,
as the leaves of roses. A gentleman at Nottingham an∣nually
distils a profitable quantity of essential oil of roses, by
collecting all of them he can purchase in the neighbourhood
during the season; and this by the usual process, which is not
difficult though tedious. And a surgeon at Stafford has intro∣duced
an agreeable and profitable kind of agriculture, by plant∣ing
half an acre of ground with red roses, and converting the flowers into conserve with sugar, or by simply drying them
for the London market.</P>
<P>2. It is probable, that numerous varieties of colour in the
single flowers of shrubs, as well as those of annual plants, might
be obtained by shaking the anther-dust of one variety over the
stigma of another, where any difference of colour already exists
in the same species. And perhaps some changes of colour of
the flowers might be produeed by inoculating the buds of a
shrub, whose flowers are of one colour, into the branches of
another variety of the same species or genus; as the variegation
of the foliage of plants is said to have been produced in this
manner, according to the assertions of Mr. Bradley and Mr.
<PB N="491" REF="496"/>
Laurence, who budded a spotted passion-flower and a striped
jasmine on those, which were not variegated, and produced a
similar variegation of them, as related in Sect. V. 1. This has
been ascribed to the absorption of some infectious matter from
the inoculated bud, which propagated a similar disease to the
whole tree; and has thence been used as an argument in favour
of a vegetable circulation of the juices.</P>
<P>A similar fact is also asserted by Mr. Milne. He says, that
“an evergreen tree ingrafted on a deciduous one determines the
latter to retain its leaves; this observation is confirmed by re∣peated
experiments, particularly by grafting the laurel, lauro∣cerasus,
an evergreen, on the common cherry, cerasus; or the
ilex, an evergreen oak, on the common oak.” Botanical Dict.
Art. Defoliatio. All these seem to want further experiments
to authenticate the facts so delivered on the authority of ingeni∣ous
men.</P>
<P>3. To increase the number of the flowers of shrubs, all those
arts are applicable, which are described in Sect. XV. 2. for the
production of fruit on wall trees; which, when the tree is of a
proper age, consist, 1. in bending down the viviparous branches
to the horizon, which renders them oviparous; 2. by twisting
a wire, or tying a cord round the viviparous branches; 3. by wounding or cutting away a narrow cylinder of the bark; 4. by
transplanting or cutting off some of the roots; 5. by cutting away
the central or viviparous branches; 6. by ingrafting.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>III. Flowers from Roots.</HEAD>
<P>1. Many bulb-rooted flowers are deservedly in great estima∣tion
by florists, as the tulip, hyacinth, lily, colchicum, crocus,
fritillary, &amp;c. and of those many are liable to become double,
which adds in general so much to their splendour and to their
duration, as narcissus, hyacinth, colchicum, tulip.</P>
<P>The immediate cause of duplicature or multiplication of the
petals of these flowers is probably similar to that of those above
mentioned, and originates from their luxuriant growth, owing
to the fertility of the soil, and the abundance of moisture and of
warmth in combination.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="497"/>
Other circumstances, which may add to their luxuriant
growth, may also contribute to their duplicature; such as by
breaking off the flower as soon as it begins to fade; and thus, by
preventing the nutritious vegetable juices from being expended in
the growth of the seeds, more of it may be derived to the prin∣cipal
succeeding bulb.</P>
<P>Thus it is asserted, that the preventing some annual plants from
flowering lengthens their lives, which it may effect by occasion∣ing
them to produce new root-scions, and thus to become peren∣nial
vegetables. The very ingenious Mr. Bogle, in the papers
of the Bath Society, believes that wheat, oats, and barley, may
be made perennials, if they are eaten down by cattle or sheep,
or cat by the scythe or sickle, so as to prevent them from pro∣ducing
ears.</P>
<P>As tulip-bulbs raised from seed produce a larger bulb the suc∣ceeding
year, and again a larger with a different leaf on the third
year, and so on till the fifth or sixth, the bulbs thus annually
improving till they flower; and even after they flower they are
believed to continue to improve for some years, till the colour of
the petals become striped: I suspect that the art of procuring a
great duplicature of the petals of these flowers consists in break∣ing
off the flower-stem on the fifth, sixth, and seventh years,
from the sowing of the seed; that is, for a year, or two, or
three, after the flower-stem first appears, as noted in Sect. VIII.
1. 3. And that the tendency to duplicature will continue in the
succeeding bulbs by the acquired habit, as in the hereditary dis∣eases of animals.</P>
<P>And secondly, these flower-roots become more luxuriant by
raising them out of the ground, as soon as the leaves wither,
which are the parents of the new bulbs; and then by taking
away the smaller or collateral new bulbs from the principal one,
which might otherwise incommode its growth by their vicinity,
and consequent compression, both these methods are of equal
use to enlarge and render more vigorous the single flowers of
bulb-roots, as well as to increase their tendency to duplicature.</P>
<P>2. The single flowers of some of these plants may be probably
not only enlarged, but so strengthened as to ripen their seeds
in this climate, by nicely laying bare the root, and taking from
<PB N="493" REF="498"/>
it the new progeny; whether a single new bulb, as in orchis
mascula, or the numerous ones of hyacinth, tulip, or lily of the
valley; as by these means the vegetable nutriment is not ex∣pended
on the new bulbs, and probably more of it may thence
be derived to the flower. See Sect. XVII. 1. 3.</P>
<P>Another method of increasing the bulb-rooted flowers in size
or number consists in crowding their roots in garden-pots, or
by not annually transplanting them; and thus by preventing their
offsets from being formed, or by decreasing the number or vigour
of them; thus lily of valley, and jonquil, seldom afford large
or numerous flowers, till they have remained three or four years
in the same situation; but must nevertheless be then occasionally
in part transplanted, least the roots should die from being so
crowded as not to sorm each of them one annual new bulb,
which is their mode of reproduction.</P>
<P>The usual method of propagating bulbous roots has been by
the smaller offsets, which are formed annually round the princi∣pal
or central new bulb, as in tulips; which central new bulb has
commonly been mistaken for the old root; by this mode of pro∣pagation
the similarity of the new progeny to the parent is nicely
preserved; and on that account some of these new roots of
tulips and hyacinths hive been sold at extravagant prices. For
the circumstance of this mode of reproduction see Sect. IX. 3. 2.</P>
<P>But in respect to producing variety of colour in the single
flowers of bulbous roots, the most effectual method, I suppose,
must be by sowing their seeds, and waiting a few years, till their
successive bulbs at length produce flowers, as described in Sect.
XVII. 1. 2. and particularly if the anther-dust of one variety in
respect to colour be shed on the stigma of another variety.</P>
<P>Another method of producing a change or variety of colours
in bulb-rooted flowers may be by planting them every year, till
they flower, on very nutritious soil, with an abundant combina∣tion
of moisture and of heat, as these two elements should exist
together to effect the most luxuriant growth of vegetables. And
after they have flowered, or on the year in which they are ex∣pected
to flower, they should be transplanted on a less nutritive
soil, with less heat and moisture. Or probably this less quantity
<PB N="494" REF="499"/>
of nutriment, heat and moisture, might be used at the commence∣ment
of their growth, or even at sowing their seed, with similar
effect of sooner breaking into a variety of colours.</P>
<P>The beauty of the double yellow tulip, and its greater longe∣vity,
much recommend it to common eyes; but the endless va∣riety
in the colours of single tulips has long and deservedly been
the admiration of florists. The curious event of their breaking
into various colours from an uniform purple, a year or two after
their first flowering, and at the same time of their losing nearly
one third of the height of their stems, seems to indicate that this
effect results not from the debility of age, but from the acquisi∣tion
of hereditary diseases, as these new colours, into which
they break, afterwards remain for uncounted generations, and
may in this respect be compared to the canker in apple-trees,
mentioned in Sect. XIV. 1. 3.</P>
<P>This change of colour from darker to lighter in tulips may
probably be accelerated or increased by keeping the roots long
out of the ground in dry or warm apartments, so as to harden
their fibres, and diminish the diameters of their secreting vessels,
and thereby hindering their absorption of colouring molecules,
similar to grey hairs produced on animals by age or external in∣jury
of the part. This would seem to obtain in tulips, as when
they break into colours, they lose one third of their size, and
consequently the diameters of their secretory and of their absor∣bent
vessels must be much diminished.</P>
<P>New kinds of varieties in the situations or production of white
parts of the petals of flowers might be caused, I suspect, by
compressing some parts of them before the flower opens, by ty∣ing
fine threads round the calyx, which incloses them; as many
darker coloured cats and dogs have all those parts lighter or quite
white, which have been compressed together, as they lay in their
fetus state in the uterus; an instance of which exists in a black
male cat, which now lies upon the hearth, and an instance of a
black terrier bitch is described in Zoonomia, Vol. II. Class. I. 2. 2. 11. This may be worth the attention of florists and flower-sellers;
and it is probable, that the white streaks in dark flowers
may have been thus produced by their greater compression in the
calyx, before the flower opens.</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="500"/>
3. The causes of duplicature in perennial flowers with branch∣ing
roots, as ranunculus, caltha, hepatica, anemone, cheiranthus,
dianthus, silene, wallflower, carnation, catchfly, are probably
such as afford a general luxuriancy of growth to those vegeta∣bles,
and may be certainly propagated by offsets from those roots,
or by laying their branches in the ground, so as to exactly re∣semble
their parents. Many of these double flowers may also
be procured by collecting the seeds from such single flowers of
the same species, as possess a supernumerary petal; which, if
sowed on fertile ground, will present us with double or multi∣plied
flowers, as the anemone and July-flower mentioned in No.
I. 1. of this Section.</P>
<P>The effect of breaking the single ones into varieties of colour,
which, in anemones and poppies as well as in tulips, are uncom∣monly
beautiful, is probably owing to the less fertility of the
soil, or less supply of heat and moisture, where they have hap∣pened
to reside, and that more effectually if they were removed
from more favourable situations.</P>
<P>The varieties of the single flowers also of those roots may be
propagated unchanged, as well as the double ones, by dividing
the roots or transplanting the offsets, or by laying their branches
in the ground, as of pinks and carnations. Other varieties may
be procured by collecting seeds and sowing them in dissimilar
soils and situations; and such flowers as are of approved beauty,
may probably be occasionally strengthened and enlarged by depri∣ving
them in part of their offsets early in the season; or may be
broken into colours by keeping the roots some weeks or months
out of the ground in the autumn in dry or warm apartments.</P>
<P>The colours of flowers of this kind, I believe, are frequently
changed by situation; in my garden some roots of comfrey,
symphytum, with purple flowers had long existed on a moistish
border; and last year other roots, I suppose from the seeds of
the former, grew in a dryer situation, and bore white flowers.
And Mr. Bradley asserts, in his Philos. Account of Nature, p.
71, that some roots of purple hepatica, which were removed
from Tothill-fields to Henley on the Thames, became white;
and became purple again, when they were returned to their na∣tive
situation.</P>

<PB N="496" REF="501"/>
<HEAD>IV. Esculent and Medicinal Flowers.</HEAD>
<P>1. The esculent flowers most in use at our tables have their
mucilage in some degree coagulated by boiling them in water or
in steam, and are consumed before their maturity, as those of
artichoke, cinara scolymus; of mercury, mercurialis; of sea-cale,
crambe maritima; and of brocoli and cauliflower, brassica
olearacea, italica and botrytis. The flowers of the nasturtion,
tropeolum majus, possess an agreeable acrimony, and are eaten
raw, shred with the fresh leaves of lettuce, young mustard
plants, or red cabbage. Other flowers are used for domestic
or medicinal purposes, as those of hops, humulus lupulus, ca∣momile,
anthemis nobilis, roses, cardamine, violets.</P>
<P>The three foremost of these, the artichoke, and mercury,
and sea-cale, are perennial plants; and, as they put forth nu∣merous
root-scions or offsets, may have their principal stem much
invigorated, and will consequently produce larger flowers, by
taking away many of these offsets, so as to leave but two or
three on a root. And as the ripening of the seed is no object,
a greater abundance of moisture, than these plants have been na∣turally
accustomed to, with proportional increase of warmth in
respect to situation, will forward their growth, and increase
their size.</P>
<P>A great part of the nutritious mucilage in the artichoke is
placed in the upper part of the stem, as well as in the pericar∣pium
of the flower, which should therefore be boiled along with
it for the purpose of coagulation; and might then probably be
managed so as to resemble sagoe, if granulated by passing it
through sieves.</P>
<P>The art of boiling vegetables of all kinds in steam instead of
in water, might probably be managed to advantage, as a greater
degree of heat might be thus given them, by contriving to in∣crease
the heat of the steam after it has left the water; and
thus the vegetable mucilage in roots and seeds, as in potatoes
and flour-puddings, as well as in their leaves, stems, and flower-cups,
might be rendered probably more nutritive, and perhaps
more palatable.</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="502"/>
But many of the leaves of vegetables, as the summits of cab∣bage-sprouts,
lose their green colour by being boiled in steam, and
look like blanched vegetables. This etiolation of some vegeta∣bles
by steam is probably owing to its dissolving their colouring
matter which may then become decomposed; and may render
them less agreeable to those who choose by the eye rather than
by the palate; which green colour is however heightened by
boiling them in some hard waters which contain dissolved lime
or sea-salt, or by a slight admixture of common salt with soft
water. An effect which is owing to the evaporation of a part of
the marine acid, and to the remaining alkali, which was the
basis of it, when applied to bluish vegetables converting them
into green, as in the common experiment of adding salt of tartar
to syrup of violets; or, according to the custom of some cooks,
who add a little potash, or fixed vegetable alkali, to the water,
in which young peas are boiled to make them green, and after∣wards
a very little sugar to sweeten them.</P>
<P>The same effect of making vegetables green, when boiled in
other kinds of hard waters, is probably produced by the lime,
which abounds in them; and which like the vegetable alkali
when the aerial acid, which was united with it evaporates, is
said to convert bluish vegetable colours into green ones.</P>
<P>The nutritious mucilage resides likewise in the young stems of
mercury, which should therefore be eaten before the flower be∣gins
to open. The stalks and immature flowers of sea-cale are
similar to good brocoli, if eaten young; though many garden∣ers
prefer the blanching them, which supplies an early and agree∣able
repast, described in Sect, XIV. 3. 3. Asparagus does not
perhaps properly belong to this section, as the stem is eaten, be∣fore
the flower becomes visible.</P>
<P>2. The cultivation of brocoli and cauliflower must be very si∣milar,
except as to the seasons of the year, as they are varieties
of the same species of plant of the cabbage family. The fol∣lowing
directions for the cultivation <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brocoli were sent me by
Edward Tighe, Esq. an inge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous gentleman of Ireland, along
with an elegant Latin <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the same subject, a free transla∣tion
of which is placed at the end of this section.</P>
<P><PB N="498" REF="503"/>
“Brocoli may be so managed as to supply the table with a de∣licious
and salutary vegetable during the months of November,
December, January, February, March, April, and May.</P>
<Q><P>1. Procure prime seed from Rome or Naples both for early
and late sowing.</P>
<P>2. Sow at the cessation of the vernal snows, and repeat it
once a month till the end of May, or longer.</P>
<P>3. When three leaves appear, transplant them; and when six
leaves appear, transplant them again. Afterwards in
June, July, and August, transplant them two or three
feet asunder, to remain.</P>
<P>4. During September and October the ground must be
loosened and repeatedly cleared from weeds and stones;
and the plants earthed up to preserve their roots from the
frost, and to prevent their being injured by the equinoc∣tial
winds.</P>
<P>5. Water them occasionally with water impregnated with
dung.</P>
<P>6. Sow and plant them far from hedges, trees, and walls.</P></Q>
<P>The head is generally completed in five or six days from its
first appearance, and should not remain much longer; the stalk
should be boiled with the flower, and peeled in the kitchen, be∣fore
it is brought to the table.”</P>
<P>Some kinds of Italian brocoli are said to produce some knobs
or bulbs at their roots, which are supposed to be for the pur∣pose
of raising other stems; if this last circumstance be ascer∣tained,
they should be broken off, when the principal stem is
transplanted; like the new root of orchis to enlarge the flower,
mentioned in Section XV. 2. 4. But they may be simply a re∣servoir
of nutriment for the principal stem, as in carrots and tur∣nips;
in that case they should certainly remain, and be trans∣planted
along with the stem.</P>
<P>3. In respect <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the flowers of hop, humulus lupulus; and
chamomile, authemis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; as well as those of roses, violets,

they could be cultivated in their double <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> multiplied state, as is
generally indeed practised in respect to roses and chamomile;
<PB N="499" REF="504"/>
many acres of the latter of which are cultivated near Chester∣field
in Derbyshire, and are sold, I am informed, to mix with
hops. when those crops are deficient, as well as for the pur∣poses
of medicine. What might be the effect of endeavouring
to introduce a duplicature or multiplication of the flowers of ar∣tichoke,
sea-cale, cauliflower, and brocoli, has not, I believe,
been experienced.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>V. Flowers used in the Arts.</HEAD>
<P>1. The beautiful membrane, which covers the seeds of euo∣nymus
or spindle-tree, and of the bixa of South America, is said
to be manufactured into the anotta, or arnotta, used in colouring
cheese; but I am told that madder, made from the root of rubia
tinctoria, is sold frequently in its stead, and may be readily
grown by farmers in their own gardens. Few flowers are used
in the art of dying, their colours are so fugitive, as they readily
bleach when exposed to the light, and cannot be kept long even
in the herbariums of botanists without losing their colours;
which is believed to be owing to the oxygen of the atmosphere
being separated from the aerial water by the sun's light, and con∣verted
into a gas combined only with heat or light, and in that
state more readily uniting with the colouring matter of flowers,
and producing a new acid, which is transparent, colourless, or
white, or is dissolved and washed away by the dews or rains.</P>
<P>The blue colour of the flowers of violets has been extracted
by water, and preserved by the addition of sugar converting it
into syrup for the purposes of medicine in part, but chiefly for
those of chemistry, to shew the change of vegetable blues into
greens by an admixture of fixed alkali, as salt of tartar or potash;
and into red by the admixture of an acid, as those of sulphur,
nitre or marine salt.</P>
<P>2. Another very important flower, which is suffered to grow
to maturity for the purpose of using the fine fibres which wing or
invelope its seeds, is that of the cotton plant, gossypium; which,
as it requires so much less preparation than the fibres of the stems
of flax and of hemp or nettles, is likely to become the principal
clothing of mankind; and especially since the art of spinning it
<PB N="500" REF="505"/>
was brought to such wonderful perfection by the genius of Sir
Richard Arkwright, who discovered that two sets of rollers
moving with different velocities would draw out the fibres of
cotton into a fine thread more accurately than could be done by
the human hand, as well as more expeditiously, along with
much other very ingenious machinery.</P>
<P>There are two bog or water plants in our morasses, which
produce much vegetable fibres attached to their seeds, one of
these is the typha, or cat's-tail; and the other eriophorum, or
cotton-rush. The fibres of the former are short and coarse, but
might serve perhaps to stuff cushions, or even coarse beds;
those of the latter are longer, and perhaps fine enough to spin.
And as both these only grow on bogs or in water, where we at
present cultivate no useful vegetables, one or both of them, might
possibly be worthy the attention of those, who possess aquatic or
marshy situations. The cultivation of the cotton plant belongs
to warmer climates, and may probably require abundant water
for its vigorous growth, as well as the typha and eriophorum of
this country.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>VI. Nutritious parts of Vegetables.</HEAD>
<P>1. Having treated of the cultivation of fruits, seeds, roots,
barks, leaves, woods, and flowers, an important question pre∣sents
itself; which of them may supply the most nutrition to
mankind, or to other animals?</P>
<P>It may be answered first, that those vegetables, or parts of ve∣getables,
which approach nearest to the nature of animal bodies,
are most likely to supply them with the most nutriment; as the
esculent mushrooms, and he gluten of wheat, and the oils of
seeds and kernels. The former class of plants seems to connect
the animal and vegetable kingdoms of nature, as spoken of in
Sect. XVII. 2. 5. and though many of them possess an acrid,
and some of them an intoxicating quality, it is probable that the
former might be destroyed, and the latter diminished, by the
heat employed in cookery. This should nevertheless be at∣tempted
with due caution; since, though one kind of vegetable
acrimony, as that of water-cresses and of cabbages is much di∣minished
<PB N="501" REF="506"/>
or destroyed by a boiling heat, yet that of the leaves of
arum maculatum, and of arum arisarum, I found by experiment
was not decreased by boiling. And a few grains of the powder
of lycoperdon, puff-ball, have lately been recommended in epi∣leptic
fits, and may thence possibly possess a powerful narcotic
quality. The gluten of wheat is supposed to approach towards
the coagulable lymph of animal bodies, as referred to in Sect.
XVI. 7. 1. and was once, I believe, advertised as an alimentary
powder, and recommended as a nourishment of the most porta∣ble
kind for the sustenance of marching armies. And lastly the
oils of vegetables approach much to a similitude with those of
animal bodies.</P>
<P>2. Secondly, it may be answered, that since the chyle of all
red blooded animals is believed to be nearly similar, and to consist
principally of sugar, mucilage, and oil; the last of which ingre∣dients
renders it white by its insolubility in water, and thence
distinguishes it from the vegetable chyle or sap-juice of trees,
which is transparent, and is believed to consist principally of sugar
and mucilage without oil; those parts of vegetables which con∣tain
the greatest quantity of these ingredients which compose ani∣mal
chyle, or are convertible into them by the power of digestion,
may be supposed to contain the most nutriment for red-blooded
animals.</P>
<P>To this may be added, that the nutritive quality of sugar is
incontestably evinced from the known fact, that the slaves in
the sugar islands become in better condition during the sugar sea∣son,
though they are compelled to labour harder. The nutria∣tive
quality of simple mucilage was shewn in a remarkable in∣stance
on record; where a caravan by some misfortune had con∣sumed
or lost all their other provisions, and lived many weeks on
the gum arabic alone, which constituted their principal merchan∣dise.
The nutritive quality of oil is observable in the process of
feeding cattle with oil-cake, and in the habits of the natives
of the northern latitudes, who use the oil of fish for both meat
and drink, and derive from it their principal nourishment.</P>
<P>Sugar is known to be the same, from whatever vegetable it is
extracted, whether from the fruit of the vine or apple-tree, from
the joints of the sugar-cane, from the sap-vessels of the maple,
<PB N="502" REF="507"/>
from the alburnum of the manna ash, from the seeds of germi∣nated
barley and rice, from the roots of beets, carrots, and pota∣toes,
or, lastly, from the nectaries of flowers. The expressed
oils of vegetables are also believed not much to differ from each
other in respect to the nutriment they contain, though some of
them may approach nearer to the nature of animal fat; as the
painters distinguish them by their greater aptitude to dry, when
mixed with their colours and exposed to the air. But the word
mucilage has been used for starch, which will not dissolve in cold
water, as well as for gum arabic, and other mucilages properly
so called, which will dissolve in cold water, and even for the
gluten of wheat, which will not dissolve in either hot or cold
water. We may therefore conclude, that those parts of vege∣tables,
which contain the most of these materials, are the most
nutritive, if they do not contain along with them some noxious
materials united with their salutary ones, and which cannot be
readily separated from them.</P>
<P>3. Though the parts of vegetables, which possess much oil,
sugar, or mucilage, may afford more expeditious nutrition, as
they constitute the ingredients of the chyle of all red-blooded
animals; yet there are other materials, which appear to be so
readily convertible into sugar or into mucilage, as perhaps nearly
to supply an equal quantity of nutriment. Thus by the process
of germination, as when seeds of barley are converted into malt,
and when roots pullulate in our store-rooms, as of onions or po∣tatoes;
the farina, consisting of meal or starch, is in part con∣verted
into sugar, and in part into mucilage; similar to this
process of germination appears to be that of ripening, by which
the austere juices of fruits are transmuted into sweet ones; and
also the culinary processes of baking or boiling, by which the
austere juices of unripe pears are changed into sweet ones by the
application of heat, as mentioned in Sect. VI. 5. But another
more expeditious conversion of vegetable materials into sugar is
by the digestion of animals, which may be truly termed a saccha∣rine
process; as appears in those, who labour under diabates,
as by evaporating the urine of one of these patients, sixteen
ounces of impure sugar were daily extracted for some time.
Zoonomia. Vol. I. Sect XXIX. 4.</P>
<P><PB N="503" REF="508"/>
Hence, though the oily kernels of nuts, walnuts, almonds,
and the oily seeds, of flax, hemp, rape, may contain most expe∣ditious
nutriment; and next to these the saccharine fruits of
figs, dates, raisins, and the sweet roots of beet, mungel-worsal,
ground artichoke, helianthus tuberosus, parsnip, carrot, may
contain expeditious nutriment. Yet the more farinaceous seeds,
as of wheat, peas, rice, barley, oats, and buck-wheat, polygo∣num
fagopyrum, and the roots of potatoes, which contain
starch, and flour, and mucilage, which are convertible into
sugar in the stomachs of animals, and are probably by that di∣gestive
process, and their previous mastication in the mouth,
mingled with more animal coagulable lymph, as the saliva, gas∣tric,
and pancreatic juices, and may thus supply a more anima∣lized
nutriment than the former; and may on that account con∣tribute
more to strengthen the system. Of these seeds and roots
it appears probable, that those, which contain the most starch or
gluten, as wheat, afford the most nourishment, as they are be∣lieved
to make the best bread.</P>
<P>4. The alburnum, or sap-wood, of most trees in the winter
months probably contain much nutritious matter; whence it is
so soon destroyed by fermentation or putrefaction when deprived
of life; and by insects, when it is deprived of its protecting
bark. This nutritious matter might be obtained by grating, or
rasping, or pounding it, and boiling the powder or saw-dust thus
procured. The bark of all those vegetables, which are armed
with thorns or prickles, is believed to contain much nutritious
matter, which their armour was designed to protect; as the
inner barks of elm, holly, gooseberry, whin or gorse, contain
much nutritive mucilage; thus the deer in Needwood Forest
greedily peel the bark from the branches of holly, which are
cut from the summits of those trees, where they have no prickles,
as mentioned in Botanic Garden, Vol. II. note on Ilex. And
horses are said to be well nourished by gorse, if the prickles
are previously destroyed by rolling a stone over it, as the tanners
bruise their oak-bark; and some horses are said to be so fond of
it, and so wise, as to bruise young gorse-bushes with their feet,
and then to eat them.</P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="509"/>
Fern roots are said to be eaten by the natives of New Hol∣land,
and in other countries in times of scarcity; but as their
farinaceous or mucilaginous matter is included in ligneous fibres
too hard for mastication, the method of cooking it is said to
consist in boiling the root, and then extracting the fibres by
hammering it to pieces. The root of white bryony, which
grows to a great size in our hedge-bottoms, is said, by M. Per∣mentier,
to possess a quantity of starch, which was capable of
being warned from the acrid mucilage by grating it into cold
water, and of being manufactured into an agreeable and salutary
bread; like the bread made from the cassava, which is said to
undergo a small process, by expressing some of the acrimonious
mucilage previous to the application of the heat of cookery.
Which however not only destroys the acrimony of many vege∣tables,
as of water-cresses, cabbages, and the skins of potatoes,
but is also believed to render some of them more nutritive by
coagulating their mucilage, which was previously combined with
too great a proportion of water.</P>
<P>5. It would appear therefore in general, that the seeds or
kernels of vegetables afford the most nutriment; next to these
their fruits and roots; and afterwards the alburnum or bark.
Some of the flowers also in their early state before impregnation,
as those of artichoke, cinara, and cauliflower, brassica, are nu∣tritious
from the mucilage, which they possess; and some seeds
already impregnated, but still in their immature state, along
with their husks or capsules, as those of kidney-beans, phaseolus,
and of very young peas, afford a salutary nutriment. And
lastly all flowers after the expansion of their corols secrete
honey; which supplies food to innumerable insects, who plunder
it, as well as to mankind. In the bases of many leaves another
saccharine or mucilaginous juice is secreted, as at the joints of
grass, on the bulbs of onions, and at the lower parts of the
leaves of cabbages, and around the stems of asparagus, mercury,
and hop-buds, during the early state of their flowers; but the
leaves themselves, like the lungs of animals, seem to possess less
nutritious aliment than many other parts of their system.</P>

<PB N="505" REF="510"/>
<HEAD>VII. The Happiness of Organic Life.</HEAD>
<P>All organized nature may be divided into stationary organi∣zations,
and locomotive organizations; the former of which
are called vegetables, and the latter animals. All those parts
of vegetables, which are most nutritious to animals, consist, as
observed above, of aliment secreted from the vegetable blood,
and laid up in reservoirs for the future sustenance of their em∣bryon
or infant progeny; which reservoirs are plundered by
locomotive animals, and devoured along with the progeny, they
were designed to support! add to this, that the stronger loco∣motive
animals devour the weaker ones without mercy. Such
is the condition of organic nature! whose first law might be
expressed in the words, “Eat or be Eaten!” and which would
seem to be one great slaughter-house, one universal scene of ra∣pacity
and injustice!</P>
<P>1. Where shall we find a benevolent idea to console us amid
so much apparent misery?—I hope the sympathizing reader will
not think the following account of the happiness, which orga∣nized
beings acquire from irritation only, impertinently inserted
in this place; their happiness derived from imagination and vo∣lition
may be treated of in some future work.</P>
<P>It may first be observed, that the seeds of plants and the eggs
of animals, when they have left the pericarp or uterus, and have
not yet commenced their new growth upon the soil, or beneath
the wings of the mother, exist in a torpid state, not possesed
of sensitive life; and cannot therefore at this time be supposed
to suffer pain, when they are destroyed by other animals; though
those animals obtain pleasure from the activity, into which their
vascular systems are excited by the stimulus of the aliment thus
supplied.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the young of lactescent animals both acquire
and communicate pleasure to the enamoured mother, from whom
they receive their nutriment, as mentioned in Botanic Garden,
Vol. I. Canto I. l. 278. note; which constitutes the most
beautiful and most benevolent part of the great system of na∣ture.</P>

Thirdly, all animals, and, I suppose, vegetables, receive
pleasure in the reproduction of their species; and where seeds are
dispersed on the soil, and the eggs of some animals and of many
insects are buried beneath it, to be revived and hatched by the
warmth of the sun; there can be no pain in these cases inflicted
on the mother, when they are destroyed by animals or by in∣sects,
as she is unconscious of their destruction.</P>
<P>Fourthly, as all animal existence must perish in process of
time, by the inirritability and consequent debility occasioned by
the repetition of stimulus, which is termed habit, and appears
to be an universal law of nature: it is so ordered, that as soon
as any organized being becomes less irritable and less sensible,
and in consequence feeble or sickly, that it is destroyed and eaten
by other more irritable and more sensible, and in consequence
more vigorous organized beings; as insects attack the weaker
vegetable productions in preference to the healthy ones; and
beasts of prey more easily catch and conquer the aged and in∣firm,
and the young ones are defended by their parents. By
this contrivance more pleasurable sensation exists in the world,
as the organized matter is taken from a state of less irritability
and less sensibility, and converted into a state of greater; that
is, in other words, that the old organizations, whether station∣ary
or locomotive ones, are transmigrated into young ones:
whence it happened, that before mankind introduced rational
society, and conquered the savage world, old age was unknown
on earth!</P>
<P>Finally, the aged and infirm, from their present state of inirri∣tability
and insensibility, lose their lives with less pain, and
which ceases instantly with the stroke of death; insomuch that
death cannot so properly be called positive evil, as the termina∣tion
of good.</P>
<P>To this should be added, that a long continued or a great ex∣cess
of pain cannot afflict an organized being; as syncope or sud∣den
death, and consequent decomposition, attends very violent
pains; and a lingering death attends the continuation of less vio∣lent
ones, Hence it becomes a consoling circumstance, that mi∣sery
is not immortal.</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="512"/>
A philosopher, whom I left in my library, has perused the
above paragraphs, and added the subsequent one to my manu∣script.
“It consoles me to find, as I contemplate with you the
whole of organized nature, that it is not in the power of any
one personage, whether statesman or hero, to produce by his ill-employed
activity so much misery, as might have been supposed.
Thus, if a Russian army, in these insane times, after having en∣dured
a laborious march of many hundred miles, is destroyed by
a French army in defence of their republic, what has happened?
Forty thousand human creatures dragged from their homes and
their connexions cease to exist, and have manured the earth; but
the quantity of organized matter of which they were composed,
presently revives in the forms of millions of microscopic animals,
vegetables and insects, and afterwards of quadrupeds and men;
the sum of whose happiness is perhaps much greater than that of
the harassed soldiers, by whose destruction they have gained
their existence!—Is not this a consoling idea to a mind of uni∣versal
sympathy?”</P>
<P>“I well remember to have heard an ingenious agricultor boast,
that he had drained two hundred acres of morassy land, on
which he now was able to feed an hundred oxen; and added,” “is not that a meritorious thing?” “True,” replied one of the
company, “but you forget, that you hare destroyed a thousand
free republics of ants, and ten thousand rational frogs, besides
innumerable aquatic insects and aquatic vegetables.”</P>
<P>“Having written the above, I fear you may think me a mis∣anthrope,
but I assure you a contrary sensation dwells in my
bosom; and though I commiserate the evils of all organic being,
Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto.”</P>
<P>2. The vascular systems of animal bodies are excited into
action by the stimulus of the fluids, which they absorb, circu∣late,
and secrete; and when this action is exerted in its natural
or most usual quantity, it is attended with agreeable sensation,
which constitutes the pleasure of organized existence. These
vascular actions of animals, which perform digestion, sanguifi∣cation,
and secretion, convert the aliment, after its solution in
the stomach, into more compounded and more solid materials;
as into muscles, membranes, nerves, bones, and shells; at the
<PB N="508" REF="513"/>
same time that pleasurable sensation attends this activity of the
system. The vascular actions of vegetables, which perform
their digestion, sanguification, and secretion, convert the ele∣ments
of air and water, or other aliments, which they receive
from organized matter decomposing beneath the soil, into more
compounded or more solid materials, as into vegetable vessels,
muscles, membranes, nerves, and ligneous fibres; and a degree
of pleasureable sensation must be supposed from the strongest ana∣logy
to attend this activity of their systems.</P>
<P>3. Many of the materials, which have been thus produced
by the digestion and secretion of organized beings, and have
given pleasure in their production, have been slow in their de∣composition
after the death of the creature; as the shells of fish
were originally thus formed, and were left at the bottom of the
ocean, till they became wonderfully accumulated, were after∣wards
elevated by submarine fires, and constitute at this day the
immense rocks and unmeasured strata of limestone, chalk, and
marble. As mentioned in Sect. X. 10. 1.</P>
<P>The strata, which are incumbent on the calcareous ones,
which consist of coals, sand, iron, clay and marl, are all of
them believed to have been originally the products chiefly of ve∣getable
organization; whatever changes they have since under∣gone
in the long progress of their decomposition, and that all
those solid parts of the earth have been thus fabricated from their
simpler elements by vegetable and by animal life, and have given
pleasure to those organized beings, which formed them, at the
time of their production.</P>
<P>We hence acquire this sublime and interesting idea; that all
the calcareous mountains in the world, and all the strata of clay,
coal, marl, sand, and iron, which are incumbent on them, are
MONUMENTS OF THE PAST FELICITY OF ORGANIZED NA∣TURE!—AND
CONSEQUENTLY OF THE BENEVOLENCE OF THE
DEITY!</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PLAN FOR DISPOSING PART OF THE VEGETABLE SYSTEM OF LINNEUS INTO MORE NATURAL CLASSES AND ORDERS.</HEAD>
<Q>I. The classes of plants distinguished by the proportion or situation of
the stamina are more natural than those distinguished by their num∣bers.
Many Linnean classes thus distinguished. Many of the
orders are natural classifications. Use of natural classes. 2.
The situation and proportion of the sexual organs are less liable
to variation than their numbers. Great variation in respect to
number of the stamina. From luxuriant growth. Some species
have but half the number. Others have part of them without
anthers. The number of pistilla varies in different species of the
same genus. Progress of nature to greater perfection. Of the class
Syngenesia. 3. Immutable parts discovered by reasoning as well
as by observation. Filaments of Meadia unchangeable, and of he∣merocalis
fulva, nigella, collinsonia, spartium. 4. Some natural
orders might become classes. As the grasses, and the umbellatae,
and stellatae. Forms of the filaments, and of the anthers, as
well as their situations, less variable than their numbers. 5. Clas∣sic
characters. From short and long filaments. From their
unequal heights. From their different insertions. From their
respective situations. From their adhesions to each other. Or
to the corol, or style. From their existence in different flowers.
From the connexion of the anthers, or from the forms of the fila∣ments
and anthers. 6 Uncertainty of the number of pistilla.
Their proportions and figures less variable. And would define
more natural orders. 7. Characters of orders from the length
of the style. The curvature of it. The attitudes of it. Divi∣sions
of the stigma. Absence of the stigma. Adhesions of the
style. 8. Conclusion.</Q>
<P>I. OFTEN as I have admired the classification of vegetables
by the great Linneus deduced from their sexual organs of repro∣duction,
<PB N="513" REF="518"/>
some of the classes have appeared to me to be more ex∣cellent
than others, as they seemed to approach nearer to na∣tural
ones. On further attention to this subject, I perceived
that those classes which were deduced from the proportions or
situations of the stamina, or which included the number of the
stamina along with their proportions and situations, were more
natural classes than those, which were distinguished simply by the
number of them.</P>
<P>Thus the classes termed Dydynamia and Tetradynamia, which
are derived from the proportions and situations of the stamina
as well as their number, are wonderfully natural; to which may
be added the classes Icosandria, and Polyandria, as their diag∣nostic
character consists in the situation of the stamina on the
calyx or petals in the former class, and on the recaptacle in the
latter, though the names of these classes are not so happy, as
they simply refer to their numbers, which are unfortunately very
variable.</P>
<P>Some other of the Linnean classes are distinguished by the situ∣ation
of the filaments, as the Monadelphia, Diadelphia, Polyadel∣phia,
and Gynandria; all which approach towards natural classes;
and the Syngenesia, which is distinguished by the adhesion of
the anthers, is a class beautifully natural, except the last order.</P>
<P>Many of the orders also in the sexual system are natural classi∣fications,
as the grasses in the class Triandria, the umbellated
plants in the class Pentandria, and perhaps the cruciform plants
in the class Tetandria; with many amongst those which are
termed natural orders at the end of the Genera Plantarum; all
which might probably be discriminated by some situation, or pro∣portion,
or form, of their respective stamina.</P>
<P>As the classes deduced from the proportions or situations of the
stamina alone, or conjointly with their respective number, appear
thus to produce more natural distributions of vegetables, than
those derived simply from their number; it might have been more
fortunate for the science of botany, if the great author of the
sexual system had turned his mind to have classed all of them
from the proportions, situations, and forms of the stamina alone,
or from these conjointly with their number, and to have distin∣guished
the orders according to the proportions, situations, or
forms of the pistilla alone, or conjointly with their numbers.</P>
<P><PB N="514" REF="519"/>
The great use of distributing plants into natural classes is not
only for the purpose of more readily distinguishing them from
each other, and discovering their names, but also for that of
more readily detecting the virtues or uses of them in diet, medi∣cine,
or the arts; as for the purposes of dying, tanning, archi∣tecture,
ship-building; which has already been happily expe∣rienced
in attending to the genera or families of plants, which
are all natural distributions of them, whence the same virtues or
qualities generally exist among all the species of the same genus,
though perhaps in different degrees.</P>
<P>2. But another great advantage would probably occur from
deducing the characters of the classes of vegetables from the situa∣tions,
proportions, or forms of the sexual organs rather than
from their number; which is, that these criterions of the classes
and orders would be much less subject to variation.</P>
<P>The variation of the Dumber of stamina not only frequently
occurs from the too luxuriant growth of many cultivated flowers,
or by the duplicature or multiplication of their petals, or necta∣ries,
which is liable much to inconvenience the young botanist;
but several of the species of plants have but half the number of
stamina which other species of the same genus possess. This
occurs so frequently, that the defect of number is expressed as an
essential character of the species in many instances. Thus the
cerastium pentandrum, and spergula pentranda, distinguish those
species from the other plants of the genus, which possess ten sta∣mens;
so tamarix floribus pentandris, tamarix floribus decandris,
falix floribus diandris, falix triandra, salix pentandra, valeriana
floribus monandris, valeriana floribus diandris, verbena diandra.</P>
<P>So the vernal flowers of the corchorus siliquosus have but four
stamina, but the autumnal ones have numerous stamina. The
linum flax of this country has but five perfect stamina, and five
without anthers on their summits; whereas the linum lusitanicum,
Portugal flax, possesses ten complete ones. The verbena, ver∣vain,
of our country has four stamina, that of Sweden but two;
the genus albuca, bignonia catalpa, gratiola, and hemlock-leaved
geranium, have only half their filaments crowned with anthers;
all-which and many others evince the uncertainty of depending
on numbers alone for distinguishing the classes of plants.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="520"/>
Nor are the number of pistilla more certain as a criterion of
the orders. Thus there is nigella pentagyna, and nigella deca∣gyna;
hypericum floribus pentagynis, trigynis, and digynis,
with innumerable other similar instances, as mentioned in No. 6
of this Section. Which evince, that great confusion must be
occasioned by a reliance simply on the number of the pistilla for
defining the orders of plants.</P>
<P>I contend, that the number of the sexual organs in flowers is
more liable to change by the influence of soil or climate, or by
the progress of time, than their situations or proportions, or
forms, and might therefore probably be more advantageously em∣ployed
in distinguishing their classes and orders from each other,
as well as in rendering them more natural combinations.</P>
<P>This mutability or uncertainty of the number of the organs of
reproduction belonging to individual flowers, would seem to
arise from an attempt of all organized beings towards greater per∣fection.
Whence as the success of the process of reproduction
becomes more certain from the greater perfection of the vegetable
being, the organs for the purpose of reproduction seen to be∣come
fewer. Whence some flowers have lost half the stamina,
and in others the anthers of those stamina are yet only deficient,
and in others the pistilla are deficient, all which in process of
time may gradually become less numerous, or separate themselves
from hermaphrodite flowers into sexual ones, as in the classes of
monoecia and dioecia; and all of them finally, after a long pro∣cess
of ages, become of the orders monandria and monogy∣nia
of those classes; whilst new kinds of vegetables may begin
a similar progress from less to greater perfection. So in animals,
the less perfect seem to possess organs for a more numerous repro∣duction,
as fish and insects. Such would seem to be the perpe∣tual
progress of all organized being from less to greater perfection
existing from the beginning of time to the end of it! a power
impressed on nature by the great father of all.</P>
<P>Thus in the class syngenesia, the tendency of these vegetables
from more numerous to a more simple organization for the purpose
of reproduction is wonderfully conspicuous. In the order polygamia
aequalis, all the florets are furnished with male and female organs.
In the order polygamia superflua, the florets in the centre have both
male and female organs, those in the circumference have only female
<PB N="516" REF="521"/>
ones; and of those some have lost the corol of the floret. In
the order polygamia frustranea the florets in the centre possese
both male and female organs, but those in the circumference
have neither; though at the same time the corols of those florets
remain. And lastly, in the order polygamia necessaria the central
florets are simply male-florets, and those in the circumference
simply female ones; and thus approach to the class of monoecia,
having the male and female organs in separate florets; and may
in process of time exist in separate flowers, and afterwards in se∣parate
plants, like the two sexes of the more perfect animals.
Something similar to this seems already to have occurred in the
plant phytolacca, of the class decandria decagynia; which pos∣sesses
one species with twenty males, another with ten, another
with only eight males and eight females, and lastly one of the
class dioecia, or two houses.</P>
<P>3. In many flowers some circumstances of the situations or
proportions or forms of the filaments or anthers may be shewn,
by <HI>reasoning</HI> as well as by observation, to be less mutable than
others; as the shortness of the filaments of dodecatheon meadia,
cyclamen, solanum, borago, fuschia, and others. As mentioned
in Botanic Garden, Vol. II. note on Meadia. Thus in the
flower of meadia, the filaments are exceedingly short compared
to the style and seem to have been in that circumstance immuta∣ble.
Whence it became necessary, first to furnish them with
long anthers, which stand pointed towards the distant stigma ap∣parently
endeavouring to reach it. Secondly, it was necessary
to bend the flower-stalks, when the corols open into those grace∣ful
curves, which constitute the uncommon beauty both of this
flower and of the fuschia; that the stigma by hanging down im∣mediately
beneath the anthers might thus receive, as it falls,
the prolific farina. And that this was the evident design of the
curvature of the flower-stalk, appears from its rising again, and
becoming quite erect, as soon as the impregnation of the peri∣carp
is accomplished. Thirdly, as the flower thus becomes per∣pendicularly
pendent, it was necessary to reflect, the petals for
the purpose of admitting light and air to the sexual organs.</P>
<P>We may reason from this strucrure of the meadia, that all this
apparatus of long erect anthers? to approach the stigma; of bend∣ing
<PB N="517" REF="522"/>
the flower-stalk, that the sexual organs might become pendu∣lous;
and then of reflecting the petals to give light and air;
might have all been spared, if the filaments alone could have
grown as long as the style; as occurs in most other flowers.
And that therefore in these flowers the filaments are the most
unchangeable parts of them; and that hence the comparative
length of the filaments in respect to the style would afford the
most immutable mark of their essential character, or for the pur∣pose
of classification.</P>
<P>Another apparent instance of the great unchangeableness of
the length of the filaments exists in the hemerocallis fulva,
tawny daylily, in which I observe the style is crooked, or bent
into a zigzag, about the middle of it, evidently for the purpose
of shortening it, that the anthers might approach the stigma;
the stalk of the flower not being so flexible as to allow it to be∣come
pendent, as in the hemerocallis flava, or yellow day-lily.</P>
<P>In nigella, devil in the bush, the styles are very long compared
with the filaments, and bending down their stigmas over the an∣thers
in curves, give the flower a resemblance to a regal crown;
which need not to have occurred, if the filaments could more
easily have been lengthened.</P>
<P>In collinsonia the two anthers stand widely diverging on short
filaments, and the tall capillary style bends its stigma into con∣tact
first with one of them, and afterwards with the other. In
the spartium scoparium, common broom, the long style bends
round into a circle to accommodate the stigma to the short set of
anthers, which great curvature need not have existed, if the
filaments could more easily have grown longer. Other instan∣ces
of similar structure are related in Sect. VII. 2. 2 of this
work.</P>
<P>It is probable, that similar observations, and a consequent
reasoning on them, might be applied to many other kinds of
flowers so as to detect the most unchangeable parts of them:
but great time, labour, opportunity, and ingenuity, would be
required to establish from them the most invariable and most na∣tural
classes of vegetation.</P>
<P><PB N="518" REF="523"/>
4. Many different proportions and situations and forms of the
filaments are enumerated in the Philosophia Botanica of Lin∣naeus;
some of which might possibly have become classical cha∣racters,
if he had turned his attention to them, and given them
adapted names; as he has done to those classes, which he has
derived from the situations of the sexual organs, as didynamia,
tetradynamir, syngenesia, and others, which approach nearer to
natural classes, and are subject to less variation than the numerical
ones.</P>
<P>Some of those collections of plants, which Linnaeus has
termed natural orders, and some of those of Ray, and Tourne∣fort,
might perhaps have had names affixed to them, denoting
the situations or proportions or forms of their stamina, and have
thus constituted natural classes in the Linnaean system. Thus for
example the natural order of grasses might perhaps have had a
name denoting their long capillary filaments. The natural order
of grasses is so conspicuous, as to have struck all beholders; they
constitute, it is said, nearly a sixth part of the vegetable king∣dom,
especially in open countries; the leaves are not easily
broken by being trampled on, but die in winter, becoming yellow
and dry; but what is wonderful, they are said to revive in the
spring, and become green again. This natural order of plants
has been divided into cerealia and gramina, corn and grasses;
which however only differ in respect to the size of the seeds. It is
much disunited by the numerical distinctions of the sexual system,
as some grasses belong to the cass monandria, diandria, triandria,
and hexandria; and those of the triandria, and hexandria, are
either hermaphrodite, or monoecious, or polygamous plants. Of
these a very curious and extensive table is given in the Praelecti∣ones
in Ordin. Natur. a Giseke Hamburg. 1792, p. 138.</P>
<P>A great part of the natural order of caryophyllei, in which
the number of the stamina is very variable, are observed by Mr.
Milne to have their filaments alternately attached to the claws of
the petals and to the receptacle, and might possibly have a classi∣cal
denomination from that circumstance. Botan. Dic. Art.
Caryophyllei.</P>
<P>The five stamina of the umbellated plants in the class of pen∣tandria
digynia, with five petals, two seeds, above; which are
<PB N="519" REF="524"/>
termed umbellateae in the natural orders of Linnaeus; as they
diverge from each other, might perhaps be called five starred, or
cinque-pointed stamina from this situation. And in part the
natural order of plants termed stellatae by Linneus, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>galium,
and asperula; which belong to the class tetandria monogynia
with one petal, two berries, above; the four diverging stamina
might perhaps be termed cruciform, as they oppose each other.
And thus these natural collections of vegetables might acquire a
classical denomination from the situations of their stamina, or
perhaps from the form of their filaments or anthers.</P>
<P>To these situations and proportions of the stamina, with many
others, might be added the form of the filaments, as capillary,
flat, wedgeform, spiral, awled; and also the forms and situations
of the anthers, as globular, oblong, arrowy, angular, horned.
Which may be seen in the Philosophia Botanica of Linnaeus, p.
65; or a translation of them in Miln's Botanical Dictionary,
under the titles of filament and anther. All which, I suppose,
are much less variable by soil or climate, than the numbers of
their respective sexual organs, and would in the hands of an
ingenious botanist form more natural classifications.</P>
<P>5. Classical characters might perhaps be taken from the length
of the filaments compared to that of the style, with some other
concomitant circumstances; as first where they are somewhat
shorter than the style, as in the pendent bell-flowers of lily, fri∣tillaria,
campanula. Secondly where the filaments are more
than twice as short as the style, as in meadia, cyclamen, solanum,
borago, fuschia. Or thirdly where the filaments are more than
twice as long as the style, and in the natural order of grasses.</P>
<P>Secondly, the unequal heights of the filaments at the first
opening of the corol. In many flowers the inferior set of sta∣mina
rise up to the stigma, when the higher set have discharged
their pollen. To these situations of the stamina may also be
added their number, as in the two very natural classes of Lin∣naeus,
the didynamia and the tetradynamia. One of these
might be termed two higher than two; the other four higher
than two. To which might perhaps be added a third class, of
many higher than many; as six above six in lithrum salicaria,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve above five in lychnis.</P>
<P><PB N="520" REF="525"/>
Thirdly, the different insertions of the filaments, as first on
the calyx, which principally distinguishes the class icosandria of
Linnaeus, and which thus approaches towards a natural class.
Secondly on the receptacle, which distinguishes the class poly∣andria
of Linnaeus, which also approaches toward a natural
class. And thirdly, the insertion of the filaments alternately to
the claws of the petals, and to the receptacle; which distin∣guishes
a part of the natural order of the caryophyllei, in which
the number of the stamina is very various.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the situation of the filaments in respect to each
other; as first in the natural order of Linnaeus termed stellatae,
or a part of the tetrandria monogynia; the diverging filaments
oppose each other, and might be termed cruciform, as in galium,
asperula. Or secondly, where five diverging filaments assume
the appearance of a star, as in the natural order of umbellatae, or a
part of pentandria digynia, and might have a name borrowed
also from their number, like five-starred, or cinque-pointed,
applied to the filaments, as mentioned above.</P>
<P>Fifthly, the adhesions of the filaments to each other at their
base. This has given names to three classes of the Linnaean
system, which approach to natural ones, under the term of bro∣therhoods;
as first, where the filaments all adhere at their base,
as in the class monadelphia; secondly, where they adhere in two
sets, as in the class diadelphia: and thirdly, where they adhere
in many sets, as in the class polyadelphia.</P>
<P>Sixthly, the adhesions of the filaments to the coral, as where
they adhere more than half their length to the internal part of
it, as in many monopetalous flowers, as primula, auricula; or
where the filament arises from the petal, or where the anthers
adhere to the margin of the petal, as in many of the natural order
of scitamineae, as observed in the Praelect. in Ord. Natur. a
Giseke, p. 189.</P>
<P>Seventhly, where the filaments adhere to the style, as in the
class gynandria, which approaches to a natural one.</P>
<P>Eighthly, the situations of the stamina not in the same flowers
with the pistillum. This has also given names to three classes of
the Linnaean system, monoecia, dioecia, polygamia.</P>
<P><PB N="521" REF="526"/>
Ninthly, the connexion of the anthers, which has given the
name to the class syngenesia, which excepting the last order, is a
wonderfully extensive and natural class.</P>
<P>To these varieties of situation, proportion, and adhesion, of
the filaments, may be added those of the anthers on their sum∣mits;
which to an attentive observer may perhaps be as numerous
as those of the filaments, and to these may again be added the
various forms of the filaments, as capillary, flat, wedgeform,
spiral, feathered, &amp;c. and also the various forms of the anthers,
as oblong, globular, arrowy, angular, horned. All which are
described in the Philosophia Botanica. And by an adoption of
some of these separately or in conjunction for classical characters,
I should hope that new classifications might be discovered instead
of those, which are simply numerical. Which might be more
natural ones, less subject to variation, easier to be distinguished
from each other, and more similar in their good or bad qualities:
and might thus add to the great beauty and utility of the present
wonderful arrangement of so many thousand vegetables in the
Linnaean system.</P>
<P>6. The same observations and mode of reasoning are applica∣ble
to the various orders of the sexual system. Which if the
great Linnaeus had fortunately deduced them from the proporti∣ons,
situations, or forms of the styles and stigmas, the characte∣ristic
signs might have been less liable to change by soil or climate,
and many of the orders have been more natural collections of
vegetables, than those are, which he has derived simply from
their number.</P>
<P>The uncertainty, of the number of pistilla, and the confusion,
which might be occasioned by a reliance on it, was mentioned in
No. 2 of this section; there is a nigella pentagyna, and a nigella
decagyna; there is an hypericum floribus pentagynis, trigynis,
and digynis; and in the whole order of frustraneous polygamy
in the class syngenesia the florets of the ray are furnished with a
style and no stigma, as in the sunflower.</P>
<P>The flowers of the polygonum, whose classical character is
octandria, and its order trigynia, affords many instances of the
uncertainty of the number of the sexual organs, both in respect
to the stamina and pistilla. Thus the species 4, 5, 6, 7, possess
<PB N="522" REF="527"/>
but five stamina in each; the species 8, 9, 10, have each of
them six stamina, and the eleventh species has seven stamina.
And lastly, the species 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, have each of them
but two pistilla, and all the rest three pistilla.</P>
<P>From these and other innamerable instances there is reason to
conclude, that the proportions, situations, and forms of the
style and stigma, to which might be added their number con∣jointly,
would have made essential characters for the orders,
which would have been less variable than those derived only
from the number of them, and would have rendered them more
natural collections.</P>
<P>7. The characters of the orders might be deduced first from
the length of the style compared with that of the filaments; as
where the style is more than twice as long as the filaments, as
in meadia, cyclamen, solanum, fuschia. Secondly, where the
style is about one third longer than the filaments, as in lilium,
fritillaria, campanula, and many other bell-flowers. Thirdly,
where the style is very short compared to the filaments, as in
poppies.</P>
<P>2. The characters of the orders might be deduced from the
curvatures of the style. As first, where the style bends into a
curve over the anthers to bring the stigma into contact with
them, as in nigella, devil in the bush. Secondly, where the
style bends into a circle like a french-horn to accommodate the
stigma to two sets of stamina in succession, first the lower, and
then the higher, as in spartium scoparium, common broom.
Thirdly, where the style is crooked in the middle of it, making
a kind of zigzag, to lower the stigma to the anthers beneath it,
as in hemerocallis fulva, tawny day-lily.</P>
<P>3. Characters might be deduced from the attitude of the style;
as where it is pendent, that the stigma may be accommodated
to the anothers above it, as in many bell-flowers. Secondly,
where it is inclined at a considerable angle to accommodate the
stigma to the inclined anthers, as in epilobium, willow-herb,
and gloriosa superba. Thirdly, where the style is erect,
to adapt the stigma to the upright anthers, as in many
flowers.</P>
<P><PB N="523" REF="528"/>
4. Where the divisions of the stigma expand, and bend down
toward the anthers beneath them, as in some kinds of dianthus,
pink, and in epilobium.</P>
<P>5. The total absence of the style might mark an order.</P>
<P>6. The total absence of the stigma, which is a characteristic
mark of the florets of the ray in the order frustraneous poly∣gamy
of the class syngenesia.</P>
<P>7. Where the style adheres to the stamina, as in the natural
order of Linnaeus termed calamatiae, as observed in Philos.
Botanica, No. 102, on the Pistilla, p. 68.</P>
<P>8. When style supports the stamina as in the class gynan∣dria.</P>
<P>9. Where the style appears to exist both above and below the
germ, as in capparis, euphorbia.</P>
<P>10. The lateral adhesion of the style to the germ, as in one
of the natural orders of Linnaeus, which he has termed senticosae,
or briers, which includes the rose, raspberry, strawberry, agri∣mony,
alchemilla, and many others, which might be named
from the lateral adhesion of the style to the germ, which Lin∣naeus
asserts to exist both in the natural order above mentioned,
and in the order Icosandria polygyna. Philos. Botan. p. 67.</P>
<P>If to these proportions or situations of the style were added
the varieties of its figure, as cylindrical, angular, awled, capil∣lary;
and to these were again added the divisions of the stigma,
as convolute, revolute, six-parted, many-parted. And to these
were again added the various forms of the stigma, as globular,
egged, end-nicked, cruciform, feathery, &amp;c. which are enu∣merated
in the Philosophia Botanica; there is great reason to
believe, that characteristic marks of all the orders of plants might
be deduced and named from some of those circumstances sepa∣rately
or conjointly; which might distinguish them from each
other with greater ease and certainty, and by marks less varia∣ble
by soil or climate, than by the number alone; and by ren∣dering
them more natural add to the beauty and utility of the
Linnaean system.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="524" REF="529"/>
<HEAD>Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>Nevertheless I am well aware of the great general inconve∣nience
of altering so extensive a system once established, and am
sorry to see some idle efforts to add the classes already deduced
from situation or proportion to those, which are simply numeri∣cal;
and thus rather to deteriorate than to improve the present
system of the great master.</P>
<P>I profess myself incapable to execute the plan, which I have
here suggested, as it would require a most exact knowledge of
the detail of botany, as well as of the outline; would require
many years of unremitted application, with every opportunity of
visiting botanic gardens, or examining dry collections, and in∣specting
prints and drawings of vegetables; and would demand
a genius which few possess, capable of reducing the complex and
intricate to the simple and explicit.</P>
<P>But if the system of the great Linnaeus can ever be intrinsically
improved, I am persuaded, that the plan here proposed of using
the situations, proportions, or forms, with or without the numbers
of the sexual organs, as criterions of the orders and classes, must
lay the foundation; but that it must require a great architect to
erect the superstructure. And my principal design in adjoining
this imperfect sketch at the end of this work was to warn those
botanists, who have began to interweave some of the Linaean
classes deduced from situation or proportion of the sexual organs
into those distinguished simply by number, that they so far con∣tribute
to deteriority the great system, which they mean to
amend.—At the same time I much applaud, and beg leave to
recommend to the attention of the public, the superb pictoresque
botanical coloured plates now publishing by Dr. THORNTON,
which I suppose have no equal.</P>

<HEAD>ADDITIONAL NOTES.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>1. To be inserted before the last paragraph of Sect. IV. 2. 1. at p. 42, line 20.</HEAD>
<P>IN the present year 1799, August 18, there was an uncom∣mon
summer-stood on the Derwent, which covered my garden
above three feet deep with muddy water. Many plants of the
rheum hybridum, mule rhubarb, which were transplanted in the
spring, and had not flowered, had their large pointed leaves cover∣ed
with mud, so as to render the green colour totally invisible
after the water subsided. They appeared strong as before for a day
or two, and then every one withered and dropped down. The
same happened to the leaves of many other vegetables, and to
espallier apple-trees, as high as they were immersed; which
was doubtless owing to their respiration being precluded by the
veil over them of a sine tenacious mud. See Sect. VII. 2. 6.</P>

<P>The rheum hybridum, mule rhubarb, described in Murray's
Systema Vegetabilium, edition the fourteenth, I believe to be
produced between the palmated rhubarb, and the common rhu∣barb
of our gardens, or rheum rhaphonticum; as it appeared
both in my garden and my neighbours amongst a mixture of
those two kinds of rhubarb, without being previously placed or
sown there. The leaf is very large and pointed, without being
palmated, and is a week or two forwarder in the spring than
either of the other rhubarbs, and the peeled stalks are asserted
by connoisseurs in eating to make the best possible of all tarts,
much superior to those of the palmated or rhaphontic rhubarb;
and are so much more valuable as a luxury, as they precede by
<PB N="526" REF="531"/>
a month the gooseberry and early apple; and may be well pro∣pagated
by dividing the roots, as they do not produce seed in all
summers. See Sect. IV. 2. 1.</P>

<P>Mr. Ruckert planted two beans in pots of equal size filled with
garden-mould; the one was watered almost daily with distilled
water, and the other with water impregnated with carbonic
acid gas, in the proportion of half a cubic inch to an ounce of
water; and both of them were exposed to all the influence of
the atmosphere except to the rain. The bean treated with the
carbonic acid water appeared above ground nine days sooner than
that moistened with distilled water, and produced twenty-five
beans; whereas the other pot produced only fifteen. The same
experiment was made on stock-july flowers, and other plants
with equal success. An. Chym. 1788.</P>

<DIV2>

<P>Besides which the vitriolic acid abounding in many clays,
when brought into contact with mild calcareous earth, by the
various operations of agriculture, must unite with it, and set at
liberty the carbonic acid either in a fluid form, or a gasseous
form beneath the soil; which is known to be so friendly to ve∣getation,
when applied to the roots of plants; and at the same
time a gypsum will be produced, which is now also believed to
be useful in agriculture.</P>
<P>Mr. Kirwan asserts, “That the gypsum used with success▪ in
agriculture is of a fibrous texture; and that clay lands, he be∣lieves,
to be more improved by it than calcareous ones. The
time of spreading it is in February or March, and it is then to
be thinly strewed on grass-land at the rate of about eight bushels
to an acre; as more he says would be hurtful. He further
adds that the theory of its effects is to be deduced from its ex∣traordinary
sceptic power; as it is found to accelerate putrefac∣tion
in a higher degree than any other substance, (Histoire de
Putrefaction, p. 36), whence it is not to be ploughed in, but
<PB N="527" REF="532"/>
barely to be strewed on the surface of the land in the month of
February, to convert the old grass quickly into coal to nourish
the young growths.”</P>
<P>I have transcribed the above from Mr. Kirwan's Treatise on
Manures, but am liable to doubt the experiments concerning
bodies promoting putrefaction; as the progress of that process
has generally been only judged of by the odour; which may
possibly be altered or destroyed by many bodies, by their uniting
with it without otherwise affecting the tendency to dissolution.
Add to this another circumstance, shewing the uncertainty of
these deductions, that some of these antiseptic materials, as sea∣salt,
and lime, are said to promote putrefaction, when used in
small quantities; and to suppress it, when used in large ones.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>5. To be inserted in Sect. XIII. 2. 2. at the end of the paragraph which mentions Mr. Lawrence's letter to Mr. Bradley.</HEAD>
<P>Another thing, which renders low situations less proper for
gardens, is, that I believe them to be much more liable to be
infested by the aphis; as leaves of the nut-trees in my garden
on the banks of the Derwent are every year crowded with in∣numerable
aphises on their inferior surfaces, and yet I have seen
few, if any of them, on nut-trees in some higher situations,
which I happened to inspect Add to this, that the great
honey-dew, mentioned in Sect. XIV. 1. 7. was produced on a
row of willows by the side of water. This may nevertheless be
in part ascribed to some other local circumstance; as I this
year observed numerous large black aphides round the stalks of
garden-beans on a clayey soil, which did not exist in my garden,
which may be called a carbonic soil. Though on the peach
and nectarine trees, against the walls in my low garden, and on
some plum-trees, the aphides exist almost every year in such
destructive multitudes as to prevent the fruit from succeeding,
and thence to render them not worth cultivation; and to ren∣der
the leaves of the nut-trees less in size, and less prolific than
other nut-trees on a more elevated and clayey soil, with which
I this year compared them.</P>
<P>Why the aphis should be so much more numerous in moist
situations is a curious subject of inquiry, but is so similar to
<PB N="528" REF="533"/>
another animal fact, that they may illustrate each other. The
cough and coosequent consumption of sheep, which occurs an∣nually
in moist situations, is owing to an insect called a fleuk∣worm,
about the size and shape of a child's finger-nail, which
creeps up the gall ducts from the intestines and preys upon the
livers of sheep; as may be seen in moist seasons in our shambles.
This seems to occur from the bile becoming too dilute from so
much watery nourishment in those animals, and that thence it
does not possess sufficient bitterness or acrimony to prevent the
depredations of these insects, as in drier seasons. On the same
account I suspect the juices of nut-trees and of willows planted
in very moist situations may be rendered too dilute; but that in
higher situations they may possess sufficient acrimony or bitterness
mixed with the sap-juice to prevent the depredations of the
aphis. See Sect. XIV. 2. 8.</P>

<P>Phosphorated lime is said to be found in the greatest quantity
in wheat, where it contributes to the formation of the gluten,
which is thence not improperly denominated by some writers
animal gluten; which in rainy years has been observed by Wit∣wer
to be in smaller quantity. Dissert. II. p. 103. Hence the
use of bone-ashes as a manure for wheat, as observed by Mr.

<P>Besides the various secretions above described Brugmanns is
said by Humbolt to have shewn, that plants void an excrement
like animals which might be noxious to them if retained; that he
put the plant lolium, ray-grass, into a glass of water, and ob∣served
daily at the extremities of the roots a small drop of a vis∣cous
material; which he detached and found to be renewed on
the next day. But this I suspect to have been produced by the
death and consequent decomposition of the extremities of the
roots in their unnatural situation. Journ. de Physique Delamethe∣rie,

<P>In the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society
there is a paper shewing, that the water-rats of that part of the
country are so liable to be affected with tape-worm, as is supposed
much to diminish their numbers. In this country many animals,
as I believe dogs, cats, and geese, as well as the human species,
are afflicted with this intestine enemy. Could some of these dis∣eased
American rats be imported into this country, and propa∣gate
their malady amongst the native rats of this climate?</P>

<P>Having now spoken of carbon, of lime, and of clay, which
with siliceous sand constitute the principal ingredients of fertile
soils, some rules may be required for distinguishing the goodness
of soils by the purchaser, as well as by the possessor. For this
purpose the chemical analysis would first present itself, as at∣tempted
by Fordyce, many years ago, and lately by Giobert,
Bergmen, Kirwan, and others.</P>
<P>M. Giobert found, that one pound of a fertile soil in the vici∣nity
of Turin contained of carbonic matter, which would burn
and flame, about twenty-five grains, of flinty sand about 4400
grains, of clay about 600 grains, of lime about 400 grains, and
lastly, of water about 70 grains. The same author found that
one pound of some barren soils was composed of siliceous earth
about 3000 grains, of argillaceous earth about 600 grains, and
of calcareous earth about 400 grains, and I supppose without any
carbonic matter.</P>
<P>Mr. Kirwan ingeniously observes, that the quantity of mois∣ture,
which some countries are more liable to than others, should
be nicely attended to, at the same time that you estimate the fer∣tility
of land by its analysis, as moist climates or situations may
require more sand than drier ones; and therefore the same com∣ponent
parts of soil would not be the most fertile, on both the
western and eastern coasts of this island; as the former expe∣riences
more rain than the latter; nor on the summit, declivity,
<PB N="530" REF="535"/>
and base of most mountains which differ in their degree of mois∣ture.</P>
<P>It appears from hence, that the chemical analysis of soils is
not yet arrived at sufficient accuracy to be depended upon with
certainty to discover their degrees of fertility. But as the car∣bonic
part of soil probably contributes most to the growth of ve∣getables,
and next to that the calcareous part; there is reason
to conclude, that if a few pounds of different soils are dried by
the same degree of heat, and then weighed, and afterwards ex∣posed
to a red heat in an open fire; that the soil, which loses
most weight, is probably the most fertile; because the carbonic
matter will almost all escape in flame, and almost half the weight
of the calcareous earth in carbonic acid.</P>
<P>Another method of giving some conjecture concerning the fer∣tility
of a soil may be by examining its specific gravity; as the spe∣cific
gravity of garden-mould is said by Muschenbroek to be
1, 630, compared to 1, 000 of water. And Fabroni found the
specific gravity of barren sandy land to be 2, 210 to 1, 000 of
water. This experiment would not be difficult to try with suf∣ficient
accuracy by drying two different soils at an equal distance
from a fire, or in the same oven, and then weighing a pound of
each in a thin bladder with apertures near its top or neck; and
then letting the bladder sink so low into water, as to admit the
water through the apertures amongst the soil; and lastly, observ∣ing
the difference between their respective weights in air, and in
water.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the method most in use by the purchasers of land
to judge of its valuè is by attending to the growth and colour of
the vegetables, which cover it; which requires an experienced
eye, and cannot be easily described in words. Add to this that
vegetables which grow wild on soils, will in some measure indi∣cate
the nature of them. As the digitalis, and arenarea, are
found generally on sandy soils, the veronica becabunga, and
cresses of some kinds, belong to moist situations and others to
mountainous ones. A particular catalogue of such plants, as
spontaneously grow in different situations, might assist in discover∣ing
the degree of fertility, and the nature of the soil; as other
flowers by the time of their opening in each climate, which is
<PB N="531" REF="536"/>
termed the Calendar of Flora, may teach the temperature of the
season.</P>
<P>In some parts of the country the spontaneous production of
many docks, rumex, has been reckoned the mark of an inferior
soil, and the production of thistles, serratula arvensis, to be a
sign of a good one; which explains a story in a black letter
book on husbandry, which says, “A blind man went to pur∣chase
a farm, which was offered to sale, and riding over the
pasture land, and hearing the goodness of the soil much ap∣plauded
by the possessor, at length dismounted, and said to his
servant, “Tie my horse to a thistle!” “Here are no thistles,”
replies the servant, “but I can tie him to a dock. “Then I
will not purchase the land,” says he, and mounting his horse
with a good morning to you, Sir, left the owner of the estate
in great surprise.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>10. To be inserted at the end of Sect. XV. 3. 7.</HEAD>
<P>To discover when the seeds of herbaceous plants are ripe, as
of wheat, the dryness or straw-colour of the stem is in general
a good criterion; as when the stem dies, and becomes bleached
by the oxygen of the atmosphere, no more nutriment can be
conveyed to the mature seed. And to determine at what time to
collect those fruits, which never ripen on the trees in this cli∣mate,
as crab-apples, and baking-pears, change of colour or
fall of the leaf shews, that they can acquire no more nourish∣ment,
and may receive injury from the approaching frost.</P>
<P>But to determine when our best or earliest apples and pears
are ripe enough to gather, that is, when they will acquire no
more nutriment from the tree, depends on a very curious circum∣stance
of the colour of the skin of the seeds. During the infant
state of the seed there is no cavity round them, but the seed is
in contact with the seed-vessel, as may be seen on cutting an un∣ripe
pear or apple; and the seed therefore is perfectly etiolated,
as it cannot part with any of its oxygen. Afterwards when
there is no more deposition of nutritious matter to enlarge the
fruit, the cells, in which the seeds are contained, become hollow,
producing an air-vessel for the living embryon; of what purity
<PB N="532" REF="537"/>
the air may be, which is produced in these cells, has not I
believe been tried, and may differ as the embryon-seed grows
older; but the oxygen, which it contains, seems to have been
disengaged from the membranes, which cover the seeds, which
thence become coloured; whence the dark colour of the seeds of
apples and pears is a proper criterion of the time, when they
should be gathered; as it indicates, that the fruit will no longer
increase in size, as it now wastes and becomes hollow by absorb∣ing
some of the mucilage from the central parts of it.</P>

maple, birch, and vine, but also I suppose from that of herba∣ceous
vegetables, as heracleum spondilium, cow parsnip, and
serratula arvensis, field thistle; when the former of these plants
has been cut off near the ground in the vernal months, the sap-juice
from the stump I have observed to flow in such quantity for
many days, that I have doubted whether by a proper apparatus
for catching it the plant might not be advantageously cultivated
for the purpose of making wine, or of extracting the sugar as
from the maple of America. This circumstance has been said
to shew a proper time for destroying the weeds, as if they be
mowed in the bleeding season, they are believed to perish by
the loss of sap-juice.</P>
<P>As all spirit is the same, when nicely distilled, whether it be
found in wine, ale, cyder, brandy, rum, gin, and is the product
of sugar by the chemical process of fermentation; and as all
sugar is the same, when nicely cleaned, whether it be obtained
from fruits, grains, roots, canes, or sap-juice; there is reason
to believe, that sugar as well as spirit may some time or other be
economically procured from the vegetables of this climate, as
Margraff extracted it from the beet-root, and from potatoes.
For the strength of common ale, which is produced from the
sugar contained in malt, is said to be about the same as that of
some domestic wines, which owe their spirit to prepared sugar.
And as in the former a bushel or strike of malt is used to about
six gallons of water, and in the latter about twenty pounds of
<PB N="533" REF="538"/>
sugar to six gallons of water, it follows, that one strike of malt
contains about twenty pounds of sugar; which if an easy method
of cleaning it from the mucilage and from the essential oil of the
seed could be discovered, it may some time be manufactured at
home cheaper, than it can be procured from abroad.</P>
<P>We may add, as all sugar is the same, and all spirit is the same,
from whatever plant they are procured; that the flavours of wines
differ from each other solely in the essential oil, which they con∣tain,
or the quantity of acidity, or of sugar not yet fermented;
and that in respect to wholesomeness wines only differ from each
other in their strength or quantity of spirit, unless where some
noxious material has been used to fine them, or to counteract
their tendency to the acetous fermentation, as lead has been
employed in some of the cyders of our country, and in some of
the white wines of France, to correct their acidity; and it is
said that arsenic is occasionally employed for the purpose of fining
white wines.</P>
<P>The injurious methods of fining wines, and of stopping their
tendency to acidity having been mentioned, the innocuous ones
ought to be subjoined; for the former it has been proposed to
filter muddy wine through fine sand laid on a sieve; but this I
am told does not succeed, as the mucilage of the foul wine soon
fills up the interstices of the grain of sands; but that an efficaci∣ous
method is to shower the fine sand on the wine through a
sieve; which as it passes down by its own weight will carry the
muoilaginous mud of the wine along with it. And lastly, if
some colouring particles cannot thus be made to subside, a litttle
more simple mucilage must be added, as gum arabic or whites of
eggs, and a sand-shower be again passed through it.</P>
<P>In respect to the tendency of wines to become vinegar, this I
am informed may be prevented by not exposing the fermenting
material to the air more than can be easily prevented, as it is the
union of the oxygen of the atmosphere with the spirit that con∣verts
it into vinegar; and though the vinous fermentation pro∣ceeds
flower, when secluded from the air, yet it finally becomes
more perfect; as the sugar in sweet wines continues to become
spirit, after it is corked up in bottles, though the process is flower,
<PB N="534" REF="539"/>
and the wine consequently becomes stronger as it grows older,
and the sweetness vanishes.</P>
<P>Hence I observe the manufacturers of raisin-wines set them to
ferment in large casks with only the bung-hole open, that they
may not be too much exposed to the atmosphere; and soon stop
them up or bottle them, before the sweetness vanishes, which
they judge of by the taste.</P>
<P>I was once told by a gentleman, who made a considerable
quantity of cyder on his own estate, that he had procured vessels
of stronger construction than usual, and that he directed the ap∣ple-juice,
as soon as it had settled, to be bunged up close; and
that though he had had one vessel or two occasionally burst by
the expansion of the fermenting liquor, yet that this rarely occur∣red,
and that his cyder never failed to be of the most excellent
quality, and took a considerably greater price at market.</P>
<P>Nor should this account of fermentation be concluded without
observing, that it converts sugar, which is a wholesome nutriment
both to young and old, into spirit, which is a poisonous material
to all; as it stimulates the whole system into too violent exertion
for a few hours, and leaves it afterwards in consequence torpid
and inactive; and hence that the strongest wines are the most
pernicious, and that all of them should be diluted with water.
As those in general, who drink ale to excess, acquire the gravel;
those, who drink wine to excess, acquire the gout; and the
drinkers of spirits die of the dropsy!—but it is the custom of
most of the inebriates of this country to begin their unfortunate
career with the first, and terminate it with the last.</P>

<HEAD>12. To be inserted at the end of Sect. X. 6. 8.</HEAD>
<P>An important paper concerning lime is this year published in
the Philosophical Transactions by Mr. Tennant, who having
been informed, that two kinds of lime were used in agriculture
which differed greatly in their effects, one of which it was ne∣cessary
to use sparingly, and to spread very evenly over the land;
for it was said, that a large proportion of it diminished the ferti∣lity
of the soil; and that wherever a heap of it had been left on
one spot, all vegetation was prevented for many years. And
<PB N="535" REF="540"/>
that of this kind of lime fifty or sixty bushels on an acre were as
much as could be used with advantage; while of the other sort
of lime a large quantity was never found to be injurious; and
that the spots, which were entirely covered with it, became re∣markably
fertile, Instead of being rendered barren.</P>
<P>Mr. Tennant having analysed those two kinds of lime found,
that the latter consisted solely of calcareous earth; but that the
former contained two parts of magnefia with three parts of cal∣careous
earth. He afterwards observed, that though vegetable
seeds would grow equally well in both these kinds of limestone,
when simply reduced to powder; yet that, when they were cal∣cined
so as to become lime, and both of them strewed about the
tenth of an inch thick on garden mould, that the magnesian
lime prevented nearly all the seeds, which had been sowed,
from coming up; while no injury was occasioned by the calcare∣ous
lime used in the same manner.</P>
<P>This important discovery seems to explain the cause of such
variety of opinion about the use of lime, which some have be∣lieved
to be of no advantage, and even injurious to land; which
has probably been owing to their having used the magnesian lime,
and having laid on too much of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Tennant first found magnesian lime near the town of
Doncaster, and afterwards at York, at Matlock in Derbyshire,
and at Breeden in Leicestershire, and at Worksop in Notting∣hamshire.
He observes, that the cathedral and walls of York
are built with this magnesian limestone; and that at Matlock
the magnesian and calcareous limestones are contiguous to each
other; the rocks on the side of the river Derwent, where the
houses are built, being magnesian, and on the other side calca∣reous.
He observed also here, that the magnesian limestone was
incumbent on the calcareous; for in descending into a cave
formed in that rock, he found a separate vein of calcareous lime∣stone,
which was full of shells, but contained no magnesia; and
observes in general, that magnesian limestone may be readily dis∣tinguished
from the calcareous by its so much slower solution in
acids, and that it contains generally very few shells, but that
those also are impregnated with magnesia.</P>
<P><PB N="536" REF="541"/>
As all limestone may be divided into three kinds; the rocks,
which remain, where they were formed from shells beneath the
ocean, except that they were afterwards elevated by submarine
fires; and secondly into alluvial limestone, as those which have
been dissolved in water, and simply precipitated, as the beds of
chalk, which contain only the most insoluble remains of sea-animals,
as the teeth of sharks; and thirdly those which af∣ter
having been dissolved and precipitated, have been long agitated
beneath the sea, till the particles have been rolled so against each
other, as to acquire a globular form, which is said to resemble
the roe, or spawn, of fish, and which contain very few shells
or none, as the Ketton stone, and that which I have seea on
Lincoln Heath extending almost from Sleaford to Lincoln.</P>
<P>Now as the salts of the sea consist of only two kinds, com∣mon
salt, or muriat of soda, and vitriolated magnesia, commonly
called Epsom salt, which in the sea-waters surrounding this
island were found at a medium to exist in the proportion of one
thirtieth part of common salt, and one eightieth part of vitrio∣lated
magnesia compared to the quantity of water. And se∣condly
as these salts are believed by many philosophers to have
been formed by vegetable and animal matters, which principally
grew upon the surface of the dry land, after it was raised out of
the primeval ocean; and that in consequence the saltness of the
sea was posterior to the formation of the primeval rocks of lime∣stone;
and from hence we understand, why those limestone
strata, which have not been dissolved or washed in sea-water
since the sea became salt, are not mixed with magnesia.</P>
<P>The chalk must have been dissolved and precipitated from
water, as it exactly resembles the internal part of some calcare∣ous
stalactites, which I have in my possession; yet there is no ap∣pearance
of its component particles having been rubbed together
into small globules, and may not therefore have been removed
from the situation, where it was produced, except by its eleva∣tion
above the surface of the ocean.</P>
<P>But that alluvial limestone, which consists of small globules
adhering together, called Ketton limestone, and of which
there appears to be a bed ten miles broad from Beckingham to
Sleaford in Lincolnshire, and twenty miles long from Sleaford
<PB N="537" REF="542"/>
to Lincoln, I suspect may probably consist of magnesian limestone
which is also said in that country to do no service to vegetation;
for this alluvial limestone by having evidently been long rolled
together beneath the sea, by which the small crystallised parts of
it have had their angles rubbed off, is most likely to have thus
been mixed with the magnesia of the sea-water, which is said to
contain one eightieth part of its weight of vitriolated magnesia,
as above mentioned.</P>
<P>At the lime-works at Ticknal near Derby there appears a
stratum of alluvial limestone, like Ketton limestone, which they
do not burn for sale, over the bed of the calcareous-limestone,
which they get from beneath the former, and calcine for sale. It
is probable, that the superior bed may contain magnesia, which
has rendered it not so useful in agriculture.</P>
<P>It is more probable, that alluvial limestone has acquired its
mixture of magnesia from the sea-water; as magnesia in its un∣calcined
state will precipitate lime from water, as observed by Dr.
Alston; who thence proposes to render water pure and potable,
which has been long kept at sea free from putridity by having
lime mixed with it, by precipitating the lime by the addition of
mild magnesia; which is a subject now perhaps worthy the at∣tention
of the court of admiralty, since magnesian limestone
appears to be so plentifully diffused over the earth. See Dr.
Black's Exper. on Magnesia in the Essay Philos. and Literary,
Edinb.</P>
<P>The lime from Breedon is magnesian, that from Ticknal
(which is sold) is calcareous lime I believe; and some farmers
in the vicinity of Derby assert, that two loads of Breedon lime
will <HI>go as far,</HI> that is will apparently do as much service to their
land as three loads of Ticknal lime. Breedon lime, I am also
informed, is preferred in architecture, and is said <HI>to go further</HI> in
making mortar; which I suppose means, that it requires more
sand to be mixed with it. Mr. Marshall in his account of the
agriculture of the Midland counties speaks of lime made at
Breedon near Derby as destructive to vegetables when used in
large quantities. And in Nottinghamshire it is afferted, that
the lime from Critch in Derbyshire is so mild, that thistles and
grass spring up through the edges of large heaps of it, when laid
in the fields. Dr. Fenwick of Newcastle observes, that the
<PB N="538" REF="543"/>
farmers in that country divide lime into hot and mild; which
Mr. Tennant believes to mean magnesian and calcareous lime.</P>
<P>By experiments which were made by Mr. Tennant by sowing
seeds of colewort on various mixtures of calcined magnesia
with soil, and of calcareous lime with soil, he found that thirty
or forty grains of lime did not retard the growth of seeds more
than three or four of calcined magnesia; from hence what can
we conclude? but that, as they both injure vegetation in large
quantities, they may both assist vegetation in small ones? and
that this is more probable, as the farmers believe, that they find
both of them useful, though in different quantities; and as the
magnesia would form Epsom salt, if it meets with vitriolic acid,
which Dr. Home found from his experiments to be friendly to
vegetation, when used in very small quantities. More accurate
observations and more numerous experiments on this subject are
required, which this important discovery of Mr. Tennant's will
I hope soon occasion.</P>

<HEAD>13. To be inserted at p. 259, 1. 6, at the end of No. 2 of Sect. XII.</HEAD>
<P>Another method has been attempted by some for the purpose
of ameliorating clayey lands, which were unfit to be turned up
deeper than they had been accustomed to be ploughed, on account
of their acidity or tenacity being very injurious to vegetation; as
the white saggar clays over many coal countries; or some very
tenacious red clays, which may contain a vitriol of iron; not an
oxyde, or oxygenated calx of it.</P>
<P>The method I allude to consists in first turning over a ridge of
earth, as in common ploughing; and then with a plough, made
on purpose, to penetrate some inches deeper into the clay so inju∣rious
to vegetation; this plough is to be so contrived, as to raise
up the clayey soil about the breadth of the furrow recently made,
and three or four inches deep, or more; but not to turn it over,
so that it may still lie under the fertile soil, which is to be turned
over it with the common plough, in making the adjoining fur∣row.
So that this plough is only to pass under the soil, and
<PB N="539" REF="544"/>
thus loosen it, and mix it with atmospheric air without turning
it over.</P>
<P>By this manoeuvre the clay a few inches deep beneath the fer∣tile
soil becomes broken in its texture, and obtains some air inter∣cepted
in its pores; from the former circumstance it may contri∣bute
to retain the vernal showers, which would otherwise run off
over the clayey surface beneath the more fertile one, and might
thus in drier seasons prevent the upper surface from being so much
indurated, and might gradually become less injurious by the fre∣quent
admixture of atmospheric air, and at length even salubrious
to the roots of vegetables.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">IMPROVEMENT OF THE DRILL PLOUGH.</HEAD>
<P>THE first experiment I tried to improve this valuable
machine was that mentioned in Sect. XII. 5. of this work,
by enlarging the axis of Mr. Tull's seed-box into a wheel
of sixteen inches diameter, with excavations in the rim
to raise portions of the corn above the surface of that in
the seed-box. But I found to my surprise the friction of
the corn to be so much greater than expected, when six
such large wheels were immersed in it, that an additional
hopper became necessary to deliver the seed slowly into the
seed-box, as in Mr. Cook's drill plough; which, as it
would add much to the intricacy and expence of the ma∣chinery,
and to the inaccuracy of the quantity of seed de∣livered,
occasioned me to relinquish that idea, and after
many designs and many experiments to construct the fol∣lowing
machine, which I believe to be more simple, and
consequently less expensive to construct, and less liable to
be out of order, and to deliver the seeds of all kinds with
greater accuracy than any drill plough at present in use;
and that it possesses every other advantage that they can
boast. The scale of the three following plates is half an
inch to ten inches.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Construction of the Carriage Part.</HEAD>
<P>Plate X. Fig. 1. <HI>a a,</HI> are the shafts for the horse, which
are fixed to the center of the axle-tree by a simple univer∣sal
<PB N="542" REF="546"/>
joint at z, whence, if the horse swerve from a straight
line, or is purposely made to pass obliquely to avoid tread∣ing
on the rows of corn in hoeing; the person, who
guides the plough behind, may keep the coulters of the
plough or hoe in any line he pleases; which is thus per∣formed
with much simpler mechanism, than that used in
Mr. Cook's patent plough for the same purpose, which
has many joints like a parallel rule.</P>
<P><HI>b b</HI> are the horns or shafts behind, for the person who
guides the drill coulter or hoes; they are fixed to the
axle-tree before, and have a cross piece about six inches
from it at <HI>g g</HI> for the purpose of supporting the seed-box
described below. Behind this about a foot distant from it
is another cross piece at <HI>c c,</HI> called the coulter-beam, which
is fifty inches long, six inches wide, and two inches thick;
it is perforated with two sets of square holes, six in each
set, to receive the coulters in drill-ploughing, and the hoes
in horse-hoeing.</P>
<P>The six light square holes are nine inches from each
other, and are to receive the coulters or hoes in the culti∣vation
of wheat, the rows of which are designed to be
nine inches from each other, and the six dark square holes
are placed seven inches from each other to receive the
coulters or hoes for the cultivation of barley, the rows of
which are designed to be but seven inches distant from
each other.</P>
<P>Besides these there are six round holes through this
coulter-beam at one part of it, and six iron circular staples
fixed into the edge of the other part of it; these are to
receive the ends of the tin flues, which cross each other,
and convey the seed from the bottom of the seed-box into
the drills or furrows, when the coulters are disposed in
the square perforations before them.</P>
<P>These coulters or hoes the person, who guides the ma∣chine,
oan raise cut of the ground in turning at the ends
<PB N="543" REF="547"/>
of the lands, or in passing to or from the field, and can
suspend them so raised on the iron springs <HI>d d,</HI> which at
the same time so fixes the shafts to the axle-tree that the
wheels will then follow in the same line with the horse.</P>
<P><HI>e e</HI> are wheels of four feet in diameter, the nave of one
of which has on it a cast-iron wheel at <HI>f f,</HI> for the purpose
of turning the axis of the seed-box, which has a similar
wheel of one-fourth its diameter; whence the axis of the
seed-box revolves four times to one revolution of the
wheel.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Construction of the seed-box. Plate XI. Fig. 2.</HEAD>
<P>This consists of boards about an inch in thickness, is
forty-eight inches long within, twelve inches deep, twelve
inches wide at top, and six inches wide at bottom; it is
divided into six cells, in which the corn is to be put, as
represented in Plate XI. Fig. 2. and should also have a
cover with hinges to keep out the rain, and is to be placed
in part over, and in part before, the axle-tree of the car∣riage,
at <HI>g g.</HI> Plate X. Fig. 1.</P>
<P>Beneath the bottom of the seed-box passes a wooden
cylinder, at <HI>h h,</HI> Plate XI. Fig. 2. with excavations in its
periphery to receive the grain from the six cells of the
seed-box, <HI>l m n o p q,</HI> and to deliver it into the six oblique
flues <HI>i i,</HI> which are made of tin, and cross each other, as
represented in the plate. The use of the seed-flues thus
intersecting each other is to increase the length of the in∣clined
surface, on which the seed descends, that if six or
eight grains be delivered together, they might so separate
by their friction in descending, as not to be sown together
in one point, which might be liable to produce tussocks of
corn.</P>
<P>As these seed-flues cross each other, before they pass
through the coulter-beam at <HI>c c,</HI> Plate X. Fig. 1. it was
necessary to make three of the round holes of the coulter-beam
<PB N="544" REF="548"/>
at one end backwarder than those at the other end;
and on that account to use iron staples or rings at one end
instead of perforations, as at <HI>w w,</HI> Plate X. Fig. 1.
These tin flues deliver the seed at the time of sowing into
the small furrows or drills, which are made by the coulters
before them.</P>
<P>These seed-flues have a joint at <HI>z z,</HI> where one part of
the tin tubes slides into the other part, and they by these
means can be occasionally shortened or lengthened to ac∣commodate
them to the coulters, when placed at seven
inches distance for sowing barley, or at nine for sowing
wheat.</P>
<P>At the bottom of this seed-box are six holes, one in each
cell, to deliver the corn into the excavations of the cylin∣der,
which revolves beneath them. These holes are fur∣nished
on the descending side, as the cylinder revolves,
with a strong brush of bristles about three fourths of an
inch long, which press hard on the tin cylinder. On the
ascending side of the revolving cylinder the holes at the
bottom of the seed-box are furnished with a piece of
strong shoe-soal leather, which rubs upon the ascending
side of the cylinder. By these means the corn, whether
beans or wheat, is nicely delivered, as the axis revolves,
without any of them being cut or bruised.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Construction of the iron axis and wooden cylinder beneath the seed-box. Plats XI. Fig. 3.</HEAD>
<P>An iron bar is first made about four feet six inches in
length, and an inch square, which ought to weigh about
fifteen pounds; this bar is covered with wood, so as to
make a cylinder four feet long, and two inches in diame∣ter,
as at <HI>k k,</HI> Plate XI. Fig. 3. The use of the iron bar
in the centre of the wood is to prevent it from warping,
which is a matter of great consequence.</P>
<P><PB N="545" REF="549"/>
This wooden cylinder passes beneath the bottom of the
seed-box, and has a cast-iron cog-wheel at one end of its
axis, as at <HI>r r,</HI> which is one fourth of the diameter of
the correspondent cast-iron wheel, which is fixed on the
nave of the carriage-wheel, as in Plate X. Fig. 1. <HI>f f,</HI> so
that the axis of the seed-box revolves four times during
every revolution of the wheels of the carriage.</P>
<P>In the periphery of this wooden cylinder are excavated
four lines of holes, six in each line, as at <HI>n n n n n n.</HI> A
second line of excavations is made opposite to these on the
other side of the cylinde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and two other lines of exca∣vations
between these; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that there are in all twenty-four
excavations in the wooden part of this axis beneath the
seed-box, which excavations receive the corn from the
seed-cells, as the axis revolves, and deliver it into the
flues shewn in Plate XI. Fig. 2. <HI>o o i i,</HI> not unsimilar to
the original design of the ingenious Mr. Tull.</P>
<P>The size of these excavations in the wooden cylinder to
receive the seed are an inch long, half an inch wide, and
three eighths of an inch deep; which are too large for
any seeds at present employed in large quantities, except
beans, but have a method to contract them to any dimen∣sions
required, by moving the tin cylinder over the wooden
one, as explained below in Plate XI. Fig. 4.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Construction of the Tin-cylinder. Plate XI.</HEAD>
<P>A B at Fig. 4. represents a cylinder of tin an inch
longer within than the wooden cylinder on the iron axis at
Fig. 3. and is of two inches diameter within, so as exactly
to receive the wooden cylinder, which may slide about an
inch backwards or forwards within it. C D are two
square tin sockets fixed on the ends of the tin cylinder to
fit on the square part of the iron axis, which, passes
through the wooden cylinder at <HI>l l,</HI> Fig. 3. on which they
slide one inch backwards or forwards.</P>
<P><PB N="546" REF="550"/>
The following directions in making the holes in this tin
cylinder, and those in the wooden cylinder, which are to
correspond with them, must be nicely attended to.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> when the tin-cylinder is soldered longitudinally,
and one end of it soldered on, as at A, six holes through
it must be made longitudinally on four opposite sides of
it, each hole must be exactly half an inch wide, and five
eighths of an inch long, the length to be parallel to
the length of the cylinder.</P>
<P>The centre of the first of these holes must be five inches
distant from the closed end A, the centre of the second
hole must be eight inches distant from the centre of the
first, and so on till six holes are made longitudinally along
the cylinder. Then another such line of six similar holes
is to be made on the opposite side of the cylinder, and
then two other such lines between the former, in all
twenty-four; and the size of all these holes must be nicely
observed, as well as their distances.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The wooden cylinder fixed on the axis is now
to be introduced into the tin cylinder, but not quite to the
end of it, but so as to leave exactly one inch of void space
at the closed end A, and then the size of all these aper∣tures
through the tin cylinder, each of which is exactly
half an inch wide, and five eighths of an inch long, are
to be nicely marked with a fine point on the wooden cy∣linder,
which must not previously have any excavations
made in it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The twenty-four holes thus marked on the
wooden cylinder are now to be excavated exactly three
eighths of an inch deep, but with an addition also of three
eighths of an inch at that end of every one of them which
is next to A, so that, when the wooden cylinder is again
replaced in the tin cylinder as before, with one inch of
void space at the closed extremity of it, the excavations
in the wooden cylinder will be three eighths of an inch
<PB N="547" REF="551"/>
longer, than the perforations in the tin cylinder over them.
These excavations in the wooden cylinder must also be
rather narrower at the bottom than at the top, to prevent
with certainty any of the grain from sticking in them, as
they revolve.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> A screw of iron about three inches long,
with a square head to receive a screw-driver, is to pass
through the end A of the tin cylinder on one side of the
axis, as at <HI>x,</HI> Fig. 4. The screw part of this is to lie in
a hollow groove of the wooden cylinder, and to be re∣ceived
into a nut, or female screw, which is fixed to the
wooden cylinder. The head part of the screw, which
passes through the end A of the tin cylinder at <HI>x,</HI> must
have a shoulder within the tin cylinder, that it may not
come forwards through the end of it; and a brass ring
must be put over the square end of the screw on the out∣side
of the tin cylinder, with a pin through that square
end of the screw to hold on the brass ring.</P>
<P>Thus when the square head of the screw is turned by
a screw-driver, it gradually moves the tin cylinder back∣wards
and forwards one inch on the wooden one, so as
either to press the end A of the tin cylinder into contact
with the end of the wooden cylinder within it, or to re∣move
it to the distance of one inch from it, and leave a
void space at the end A.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> The ends of all the holes of the tin cylinder,
which are next to the end A of it, are now to be enlarged,
by slitting the tin three eighths of an inch towards A, on
each side of the hole; and then that part of the tin, in∣cluded
between these two slits, which will be half an
inch wide, and three eighths of an inch lengthways in
respect to the cylinder, is not to be cut out, but to be bent
down into the excavations of the wooden cylinder beneath,
so as to lie against that end of the excavation which is
next to A.</P>
<P><PB N="548" REF="552"/>
But these projecting bits of tin, before they are bent
down into the excavations of the wooden cylinder, must
be filed a little less at the projecting end, which is to be
bent down, than at the other end; as the excavations of
the wooden cylinder are to be rather narrower at the bot∣tom
than at the top, and these pieces of tin, when bent
down, must exactly fit them.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> When all these holes through the tin-cylinder
are thus enlarged, and the bits of tin filed rather narrower
at their projecting ends, and then bent down into the ex∣cavations
of the wooden cylinder, the other end of the
tin cylinder with its square socket may be soldered on.</P>
<P>And now when the end of the tin cylinder at A is
pressed forwards upon the wooden cylinder towards B,
by turning the screw at <HI>x</HI> above described; every exca∣vation
of the wooden cylinder will be gradually lessened,
and finally quite closed; by which easy means they may
be adapted to receive and deliver seeds of any size from
horse-beans and peas to wheat, barley, and to turnip-seed,
with the greatest accuracy, so as to sow four, five, or six
pecks on an acre, or more or less, as the agricultor pleases,
by only turning the screw a few revolutions one way or
the other.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Observations.</HEAD>
<P>1. In the construction of the tin and wooden cylinders
beneath the seed-box another small improvement may be
necessary in sowing very small seeds, which is this: As
the screw at the end A is turned, so as to contract all the
excavations of the wooden cylinder, the surface of the
wooden cylinder for one inch from the end of each exca∣vation
towards the end B, Plate XI. Fig. 4. will become
bare without being covered by the tin cylinder; and on
these bare parts of the wooden cylinder, which will be
one inch long, and half an inch wide, some small seeds
<PB N="549" REF="553"/>
may chance to stick, and evade the brushes, which should
prevent them from passing, as the cylinders revolve.</P>
<P>To prevent this, when the wooden cylinder is so placed
within the tin cylinder, that all the holes are quite open,
let a piece of the tin cylinder about an inch and a half
long, and half an inch wide, be cut out from the extre∣mity
of each hole next to the end B, and let this piece of
the tin cylinder thus cut out be fixed by a few sprigs on
the wooden cylinder exactly in the same place, which it
covered before it was cut out of the tin one, by which
contrivance, when the tin cylinder is afterwards pushed
forwards by turning the screw at its end, so as to contract
the excavations of the wooden cylinder beneath, the bare
parts of the wooden cylinder will exist an inch and a half
from the extremities of the excavations next to the end
B, and thus will not pass under the brushes, and in con∣sequence
no small seeds can lodge in them.</P>
<P>2. Some kind of iron staple should be fixed at each end
of the seed-box on the outside, which when the hinder
part of the carriage is raised up by the person who guides
it, might catch hold of the two iron springs at <HI>d d</HI> in Plate
X. Fig. 1. for the purpose of suspending the coulters out
of the ground, and connecting the hinder part of the
machine with the shafts before; that in turning at the
ends of the lands, or in passing from or to the field, the
wheels may not swerve at the joint <HI>z,</HI> at the centre of the
axle-tree, but may follow in the same line with the shafts.</P>
<P>3. The seed-box must also be supported on upright iron
pins passing through iron staples, with a lever under the
end of it next to the wheel <HI>r r,</HI> Plate XI. Fig. 3, for the
purpose of easily lifting that end of the seed-box about
an inch high, to raise the teeth of the iron cog-wheel on
its axis out of the teeth of the correspondent iron wheel
on the nave of the carriage-wheel.</P>
<P>4. The construction of the coulters, which make the
drills, and of the rakes, which again fill them, after the
<PB N="550" REF="554"/>
seed is deposited, and also of the hoes, are not here deli∣neated;
as they are similar to those so often described or
used by Mr. Tull and his followers.</P>
<P>5. When the lower ends of the seed-flues are placed
through the holes in the coulter-beam, Plate. I. Fig. 1.
at nine inches distance from each other, the rows of wheat
or beans will then be sown nine inches from each other;
and as the wheels of the carriage are four feet in diame∣ter,
and therefore travel about twelve feet at each revo∣lution;
and as there are four excavations round the axis
of the seed-box, which revolve four times for one revo∣lution
of the carriage-wheels; it follows, that the seeds
contained in the excavations of the cylinder beneath the
seed-box will be sown at nine inches distance in each drill
or furrow, as the plough proceeds; and as these rows
are nine inches asunder, any desired number of seeds may
be deposited in every square of nine inches, which are contained in the surface of the field.</P>
<P>6. Mr. Coke of Norfolk acquainted me, that on his
very extensive farm the wheat sown on an acre was six or
seven pecks by the Rev. Mr. Cook's drill plough, which
was about half the quantity generally used in broad-cast
sowing. If the wheat was nicely deposited in the drills,
I suspect one bushel would be quite sufficient for an acre,
as the rows are at nine inches distant from each other; for
there would in that case be about eight grains or nine grains
deposited in every nine inches of the drill-furrow; that
is, in every square of nine inches contained in the surface
of the land so cultivated.</P>
<P>Which may be thus estimated. Mr. Charles Miller, in
the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LVIII. p. 203, has
estimated the number of grains in a bushel of wheat to
amount to 620,000; and Mr. Swanwick of Derby has
lately estimated them to be 645,000. We may suppose
therefore, that a bushel may at an average contain 635,000
<PB N="551" REF="555"/>
grains of wheat. Now as a statute acre contains 4840
square yards, and there are sixteen squares of nine inches
in every square yard, 4840 multiplied by 16 gives 77,440,
which is the number of squares of nine inches in such an
acre. If 635,000 grains in a bushel be divided by 77,440,
the number of squares of nine inches in an acre, the quo∣tient
will shew, that rather more than eight grains of
wheat will thus be deposited in every nine inches of the
drills.</P>
<P>7. Now if eight or nine grains were dropped altogether
in one inch of ground, they would be too numerous, if
they be all supposed to grow, and would form a tussock;
but by making them slide down an inclined plane, as in
the tin-flues, from the seed-box to the coulters, which
are crossed for the purpose of lengthening them, as seen
in Plate XI. fig. 2. some of the seeds will be more de∣layed
by their friction in descending than others, and the
eight or nine seeds will thence be dispersed over the whole
nine inches of the drill; which renders drill-sowing su∣perior
to dibbling, as in the latter the seeds are dropped
all together.</P>
<P>8. When the holes in the wooden cylinder are com∣pletely
open, they are about a proper size for sowing
horse-beans or peas: when they are completely closed,
there will remain a small niche at the end of the excava∣tion
in the wooden cylinder next to B, Plate XI. fig. 4.
for turnip-seed, or other small seeds.</P>
<P>For wheat and barley and oats, a wooden wedge
should be made of the exact shape of the area of the
hole, which the director of the plough requires; who
will occasionally insert it into the holes, when he turns
the screw at the end of the cylinder to enlarge or to lessen
them to these exact dimensions.</P>
<P>These wedges should be written upon with white paint,
wheat, barley, oats, &amp;c. which will much facilitate the
<PB N="552" REF="556"/>
adapting the size of the excavations to each kind of grain,
and may be altered, if required, to suit larger or less seeds
of the same denomination.</P>
<P>9. In some drill-ploughs, as in Mr. Cook's, there is an
additional machinery to mark a line, as the plough pro∣ceeds,
in which the wheel nearest the last sown furrow
may be directed to pass at a proper distance from it, and
parallel to it. But in sowing wheat or peas and beans this
may be done by making the wheels, as they run upon the
ground, to be exactly fifty-four inches from each other;
and then at the time of sowing to guide the wheel next to
the part last sown exactly in the rut, which was last made;
by which guide the rows will all of them be accurately
at nine inches distant from each other.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Simplicity of this Drill Plough.</HEAD>
<P>1. The simplicity of this machine consists first in its
having only a seed-box, and not both a hopper and a seed-box,
as in the Rev. Mr. Cook's patent drill-plough.</P>
<P>2. The flues, which conduct the seed from the bottom
of the seed-box into the drill-furrows, are not disjoined
about the middle of them to permit the lower part to move
to the right or left, when the horse swerves from the line,
in which the coulters pass, as in Mr. Cook's patent drill-plough;
which is done in this machine by the simple uni∣versal
joint at <HI>z,</HI> Plate I. fig. 1.</P>
<P>3. In this machine the horns or shafts behind, between
which the person walks, who guides the coulters, are
fixed both to the coulter-beam, and to the axle-tree;
whereas in Mr. Cook's patent plough these are all of them
moveable joints like a parallel rule, for the purpose of
counteracting the swerving of the horse; which in this
machine is done by the simple universal joint at <HI>z,</HI> fig. 1.
Plate I. before mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="553" REF="557"/>
4. The altering the dimensions of the holes in the axis
of the seed-box by only turning a screw, so as to adapt
them to all kinds of seeds, which are usually sown on
field-lands.</P>
<P>5. The strong brush of bristles, which sweep over the
excavations of the cylinders beneath the seed-box, strickle
them with such exactness, that no supernumerary seeds
escape, and yet none of them are in the least bruised or
broken, as I believe is liable to occur in Mr. Tull's ori∣ginal
machine.</P>
<P>Lastly it should be observed, that the less expence in
the construction, the less propensity to be out of repair,
and the greater ease of understanding the management of
this machine, correspond with its greater simplicity; and
will, I hope, facilitate the use of the drill-husbandry.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Mr. Swanwick's Seed-Box.</HEAD>
<P>As the dibbling of wheat, described in Sect. XVI. 2.
2. is a very slow and laborious method of depositing the
corn, and is yet coming, as I am informed, more and
more into fashion in some counties, I suspect this must be
owing to the expence of procuring, and the difficulty of
managing the drill-ploughs now in use, or to the greater
inaccuracy, with which they deliver the seed. I flatter
myself therefore, that I am doing a benefit to society in
endeavouring to simplify this machine, and to increase its
accuracy as much as possible: and shall therefore here de∣scribe
another method of delivering the seed from the
seed-box, which was invented by Mr. Swanwick, an in∣genious
teacher of writing and arithmetic, with some
branches of natural philosophy, in Derby; and who will
not be averse to shew the working models of the seed-boxes,
or to give assistance to any one, who wishes to con∣struct
either this drill machine, or the preceding one.</P>
<P><PB N="554" REF="558"/>
Mr. Swanwick's seed-box is forty-eight inches long
within, is divided into six cells for the purpose of sowing
six rows of seeds at the same time, like that above de∣scribed.
And at the bottom of each cell is a hole, <HI>a, a,</HI> &amp;c.
Fig. 1. Plate XII. for the seed to pass through into
the seed-flues, as in the machine before described: but in
this there is no revolving axis, but a wooden or iron bar
B B, fig. 3. Plate XII. about two inches broad, and about
four feet eight inches long, and exactly three eighths of
an inch thick. Through this bar there are six perforations,
<HI>e e e,</HI> &amp;c. which are each of them exactly one inch long,
and half an inch wide; and three eighths of an inch
deep, which is the thickness of the bar. The centres of
these holes are exactly eight inches distant from each
other, correspondent to the holes at the bottom of the
seed-box; over which it is made to slide backward and
forwards in a groove. By this sliding motion it passes
under stiff brushes, which are placed over it on each end
of the holes at the bottom of the seed-box, and strickle
off the grain, as the holes in the sliding-bar pass under
them, which thus measure out the quantity with consider∣able
accuracy.</P>
<P>In order to increase or diminish the quantity of grain
delivered, the slider is covered with a case of tin C C, fig.
4, Plate XII. which has six perforations exactly corre∣sponding
with the holes in the slider; but instead of the
bit of tin being cut out the whole length of the hole, part
of it is left at the end <HI>i,</HI> fig. 6, equal to the thickness of
the slider, and is bent down as at <HI>b,</HI> after the slider is put
into the case, like the tin cylinder in the preceding ma∣chine.
This case is moveable about one inch backward
and forward by turning the finger-screw <HI>s,</HI> fig. 4 and 5;
and thus the holes are made larger or less to suit various
sorts of grain, or different quantities of the same sort,
exactly as in the wooden and tin cylinders in Plate XI.
<PB N="555" REF="559"/>
The slider is moved forwards by a bent iron pin <HI>h</HI> attached
to it, which passes into a serpentine groove Y, fig. 5, fixed
to the nave of the wheel: and backwards by a steel spring
at the other end of the seed-box, which is not represented
in the plate.</P>
<P>Fig. 5 is a bird's eye view of the parts before described:
E E the seed-box divided into cells by the partitions <HI>d d,</HI>
&amp;c.—<HI>c c c</HI> the slider, with a part of the apertures seen just
appearing from under the brushes. X the axis of the wheel.</P>
<P>Fig. 6 is a drawing of part of the tin case, nearly
of the full dimensions as to breadth and thickness, but
only a small portion of the length; and is intended to
shew more distinctly the construction of it.</P>
<P>Fig. 2 represents a side-view of one of the six bridges
lying over the holes at the bottom of the seed-box, on each
side of which the brushes are fixed, which strickle the
holes, when they are full of corn, as the bar slides back∣wards
and forwards.</P>
<P>The simplicity of this slider at the bottom of the seed-box
may be in some respects greater, than that of wooden
and tin cylinders in the former machine; as this has but
six holes to measure out the corn, and the other has
twenty-four. But perhaps in other respects less so; as in
this twelve brushes are used, one on each side of each of
the six holes; whereas there are only six brushes rub upon
the tin cylinder in the former machine. And the recipro∣cating
motion of this slider must be quick, as it must act
once every time the periphery of the wheel of the car∣riage
has passed nine inches forward; which may not be
so easy to execute as the cog-wheel, and uninterrupted
movement of the axis and cylinder in the preceding ma∣chine.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that the facility of adapting the
holes to the dimensions required in both these machines,
and their not bruising or breaking the grain in their ope∣ration
<PB N="556" REF="560"/>
of delivering it, as well as their not being encum∣bered
with an additional hopper, which must deliver the
quantity of seed with great inaccuracy from the unequal
shaking of the machine, adds much to the excellency and
simplicity of them both. And I hope will render more
general the use of the drill husbandry invented by the in∣genious
Mr. TULL; who was on that account an honour
to this country, and ought to have a statue erected to his
memory, as a benefactor of mankind, like Ceres and
Triptolemus of old.</P>

<P>Represents the spiral vessels of a vine-leaf considerably magni∣fied,
copied from Grew, Table LI. On slowly tearing asunder
almost any tender vegetable shoot or leaf, the spiral structure of
these vessels becomes visible to the naked eye. They have been
erroneously believed to be air-vessels; but as they exist equally in
the roots of plants, as in their barks, and have no communica∣tion
with the horizontal perforations of the cuticle of the bark,
they cannot be air-vessels, and are therefore believed to consti∣tute
the absorbent vessels of the adult vegetable, and the umbili∣cal
ones of the embryon bud. A similar plate of the spiral struc∣ture
of these vessels is given by Duhamel. As they are larger
than the vegetable blood-vessels, and pass along the whole cau∣dex
of each bud from its plumula to its radicle, as well as to the
cautaneous absorbents, those of the trunks of trees or herbaceous
plants may be thought to resemble the receptaculum chyli of ani∣mal

<HEAD>PLATE III.</HEAD>
<P>Is copied from Malpighi Appendix de ovo Incubato, Tom. II.
Fig. 54, and represents the chick in the egg on the fourteenth
day of incubation. The chick rolled up swims in the amnios
<HI>a a,</HI> which is kept moist by very minute vessels. Round this is
placed the yolk <HI>b b,</HI> to which adjoins the thicker part of the
white. The whole is surrounded with chorion <HI>d d d.</HI> On this
are spread the blood-vessels, of which the large one <HI>e</HI> emerging
from the navel of the chick, and generating the various branches
<HI>f f f,</HI> terminates in a capillary network. In contact with these
a redder set of vessels passes with similar ramifications. Another
set of vessels <HI>g g</HI> arises from the navel, which are smaller ones,
and are propagated amidst the ramification of <HI>f f.</HI> The lungs
are white; the stomach full of milk, or of coagulated albumen
or white; and the intestines hang out from the navel.</P>
<P>As two sets of blood-vessels terminate on the chorion, and as
one branch of the larger set carries redder blood, and as the
lungs are still white; it seems evident, that this larger set of
vessels resemble the placental arteries and vein of viviparous ani∣mals,
and that the blood receives its red colour by acquiring
oxygen from the air included between the external moist mem∣brane
and the shell of the egg; which air at first is seen only at
the broad end, but afterwards extends from thence to the equa∣tor
of the egg, and probably passes through the other end of the
shell to that part of the internal membrane, which adheres to
it. See an analogous plate in Fabricius ab Aquapendente.

<HEAD>PLATE VII.</HEAD>
<P>Is a section of a machine for raising water a few feet high by the
power of the wind for the purpose of draining morasses, or of
watering lands on a higher level.</P>
<P>It consists of a windmill sail placed horizontally like that of a
smoak-jack, surrounded by an octagon tower; the diverging rays
of this tower, <HI>a b, a b,</HI> may consist of two-inch deals only, if
on a small scale, or of brick-work if on a larger one. These up∣right
pillars are connected together by oblique horizontal boards
as shewn at A B, by which boards placed horizontally from pil∣lar
to pillar, in respect to their length, but at an angle of about
45 degrees in respect to their breadth, so as to form a complete
octagon including the horizontal windmill sail near the top of it;
the wind as it strikes against any of them, from whatever quarter
it comes, is bent upwards and then strikes against the horizontal
wind-sail. These horizontal boards, which form the sides of the
octagon, may either be fixed in their situations, or be made to
turn upon an axis a little below their centres of gravity, so as to
close themselves on that side of the octagon tower most distant
from the wind.</P>
<P>It may be supposed that the wind thus reflected would lose
considerably of its power before it strikes on the wind-sail, but
on fixing a model of such a machine on the arm of a long whirl∣ing
lever, with proper machinery to count the revolution of the
wind-sail, when thus included in a tower and moving horizontally;
and then <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> moved vertically as it was whirled on the arm of
the lever with the same velocity, it was found on many trials by
Mr. Edgeworth of Edgeworth town in Ireland, and by myself,
thus the wind by being thus reverted upwards by a fixed planed
board did not seem to lose any of its power. And as the height
of the tower may be made twice as great as the diameter of the
sail there is reason to conclude that the power of this horizontal
wind-sail may be considerably greater, than if the same sail was
placed nearly vertically opposed to the wind in the usual manner.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the shaft of the wind-sail is placed a centri∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gal
pump with two arms at C D, which has been described in
mechanical authors. It consists simply of an upright bored trunk,
or cylinder of lead, with two opposite arms with an adapted valve
at the bottom to prevent the return of the water, and a valve at
the extremity of each arm to prevent any ingress of air above the
current of the water as it flows out.</P>
<P><HI>c c c c</HI> is a circular trough to receive the streams of water from
C and D, to convey them where required.</P>

<HEAD>PLATE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Shews the structure of Mr. Bennet's electric Doubler applied to
the pendulum of a clock for the purpose of subjecting a flower-pot
to perpetual positive or negative electricity.</P>
<P>A the brass plate, which is always insulated by its glass pedes∣tal,
on which the electricity is accumulated. B the brass plate,
which becomes electrified by the influence of the moving plate C,
which is also insulated. D the pendulum wire. C is insulated
by the glass-tube E E. The wire F F is also insulated by the
same glass, being fastened to the middle of it by a brass socket
at G. HHHHH are wires to connect the plates with each
other, or with the earth. I I a string to be carried from the
plate A over insulated hooks to any part of a room, or to an in∣sulated flower-pot.</P>
<P>Now if A be positive, and C moves, till it be parallel to it,
and the wires at the bottom touch each other, then C becomes
negative, and moving till it be parallel to B, and its wire touched
by the uppermost H, then B becomes positive; and when C re∣turns
to A, the electricity of A and B becomes united by means
of the insulated wire F F touching H H. The longer end of
F is bent so as not to touch the wire of B, till the end is brought
to it. Thus the positive electricity of A is increased.</P>
<P>The wires are curled into several rings to make them more
elastic, as otherwise they would soon be pushed out of their
places, and the proper contacts not occur. The plates A and B
may be fixed on heavy pedestals, that they may be moved upon a
shelf to a proper distance from the plate, which hangs by the pen∣dulum
wire. The heavier the pendulum and the larger the plates,
the more electricity may be accumulated. With my small appara∣tus
fixed to a Dutch wooden clock sparks are sometimes produced
between the plates, and sometimes the clock has been stopped
by their attraction to each other. Perhaps the plates should not
be circular, but something like a lady's fan, when expanded, the
bottom being a part of the curve described by the moving pendu∣lum,
with the sides directed towards the point on which it moves.</P>
<P>This drawing and description of his Pendulum Doubler was
sent me by Mr. Bennet of Wirksworth, and is referred to at the
end of Sect. XIII. of this work. If another insulated flower-pot
was connected with the plate B instead of the wire at the up∣permost
H, perhaps it might be kept in a state of minus, or nega∣tive
electricity, at the same time that the other flower-pot was
kept in a state of plus or positive electricity.</P>

<Q>Exhibits the aphis, puceron, or vine-fretter, and the insects
which destroy it.</Q>
<P>Fig. 1. represents the aphis of the rose-tree without wings
very much magnified, copied from M. Bonnet, with its antenae
before, and its two horns behind, which are not half the length
of the antennae, are immoveable, and said by Bonnet to be hol∣low
canals from which the sweet juice called honey-dew is eva∣cuated;
lastly, with the trunk under its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead in the position in
which it penetrates the leaves. In some the horns behind are
wanting, and little knobs supply their place, which Reaumur
thinks supply the same sweet juice. That some possessing wings,
and others not, does not distinguish the sexes is agreed by all ob∣servers.</P>
<P>Fig. 2. represents a magnified aphis of a pear-tree from which
a young one is suspended for some time after it is otherwise born.</P>
<P>Fig. 3. represents the aphidivorous larva, with an aphis in its
mouth, and the chrysalis of the same insect, before it is trans∣formed
into the fly at fig. 4. All these were drawn from nature,
and exactly resemble similar representations in the work of
Bonnet.</P>
<P>Fig. 5. represents an insect from Bonnet, which he terms an
aphis lion, as it so greedily devou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the aphises. This insect is
transformed into the fly at fig. 6.</P>
<P>Fig. 7. represents a spotted hemispheric scarabeus, called by
some a lady-bird, into which the insect at fig. 8. is transformed,
which is also said to be a great aphis-eater. Oeuvres de C.
