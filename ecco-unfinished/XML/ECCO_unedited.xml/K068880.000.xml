<SALUTE>COURTEOUS READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF, after having purchased <HI>My Night—gown, and Slippers,</HI> you hold them two shillings and six-pence all too dear, you have only to journey to the foun∣tain Castalius, in Baeotia, at the very bottom of Mount Parnassus, (where such mere <HI>bijoux</HI> as these are manufactured) and I will return you the mo∣ney:—Provided, at the same time, that you, there, do return to me my goods, clean, and uncut.</P>
<P>Let me, however, give you a brief account of these Trifles.</P>
<P><HI>The Maid of the Moor, the Newcastle Apothecary,</HI> and <HI>Lodgings for single Gentlemen,</HI> are slip-shod Tales, written for an Entertainment which I pro∣posed to offer to the Publick, at the Haymarket Theatre, during Lent; and two of them were intended to be <HI>spoken,</HI> (read them, therefore, with a view to recitation) and the third to be sung, as light matter, calculated to relieve the gravity of a didactick performance.</P>
<P>The whole performance (for reasons unnecessary to mention, here) was relinquished:—</P>
<P>But, as it is my custom to avoid the accumulation of my own papers, in my Bureau, I hold it more adviseable to print my three Stories (light as they are) than to burn them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4"/>I have put them into a kind of Crambo-vehicle, to make them connect; and, if <HI>The Maid of the Moor</HI> acts as an antidote, with o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Foard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng-school Miss, to the poison, so plentifully distributed, in the shape of Novels, Ro∣mances, Legendary Tales, &amp;c. &amp;c. I may say, with Philosophers, that the most insignificant things are of some utility.</P>

<LG>
<L>TOM, DICK, and WILL, were little known to Fame;—</L>
<L>No matter:—</L>
<L>But to the Alehouse oftentimes they came,</L>
<L>To chatter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It was the custom of these three,</L>
<L>To sit up late;</L>
<L>And, o'er the embers of the Alehouse fire,</L>
<L>When steadier customers retire,</L>
<L>The choice <HI>Triumviri,</HI> d'ye see,</L>
<L>Held a debate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Held a debate?—On politicks, no doubt.</L>
<L>Not so;—they cared not who was in,</L>
<L>Not of a pin—</L>
<L>Nor who was out.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<L>All their discourse on modern Poets ran;</L>
<L>For in the Muses was their sole delight:—</L>
<L>They talk'd of such, and such, and such a man;</L>
<L>Of those who could, and those who could not write.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It cost them very little pains</L>
<L>To count the modern Poets, who had brains.</L>
<L>'Twas a small difficulty;—'twasn't any:</L>
<L>They were so few.</L>
<L>But to cast up the scores of men</L>
<L>Who wield a stump they call a pen,</L>
<L>Lord! they had much to do!</L>
<L>They were so many.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Buoy'd on a sea of fancy, Genius rises,</L>
<L>And like the rare Leviathan surprises:</L>
<L>But the <HI>small fry</HI> of scribblers!—tiny souls!</L>
<L>They wriggle through the mud in shoals</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It would have raised a smile to see the faces</L>
<L>They made, and the ridiculous grimaces,</L>
<L>At many an Author as they overhaul'd him.</L>
<L>They gave no quarter to a calf,</L>
<L>Blown up with puff, and paragraph;</L>
<L>But, if they found him bad, they maul'd him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<L>On modern Dramatists they sell,</L>
<L>Pounce, <HI>vi et armis</HI>—tooth and nail—pell mell:</L>
<L>They call'd them Carpenters and Smugglers;</L>
<L>Filching their incidents from ancient hoards,</L>
<L>And knocking them together like deal boards:</L>
<L>And Jugglers;</L>
<L>Who all the town's attention fix</L>
<L>By making—Plays?—No Sir; by making <HI>Tricks.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Versifiers—Heaven defend us!</L>
<L>They play'd the very devil with their rhimes.</L>
<L>They hoped Apollo a new set would send us;—</L>
<L>And then, invidiously enough,</L>
<L>Placed modish verse, which they call'd stuff,</L>
<L>Against the writings of the elder times.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To say the truth, a modern vesifier</L>
<L>Clap'd cheek by jowl</L>
<L>With Pope, with Dryden, and with Prior,</L>
<L>Would look damn'd scurvily, upon my soul!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Novels, should their critick hints succeed,</L>
<L>The Misses might fare better when they took 'em;</L>
<L>But it would fare extremely ill, indeed,</L>
<L>With gentle <HI>Messieurs Bell</HI> and <HI>Hookham.</HI></L>

<L>"A Novel, now" says WILL, "is nothing more"</L>
<L>"Than an old castle,—and a creaking door"—</L>
<L>"A distant hovel"—</L>
<L>"Clanking of chains—a gallery—a light"</L>

<LG>
<L>WILL rose in declamation. "Tis the bane,"</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>DICK knock'd the ashes from his pipe;</L>

<L>"Time was,—when honest Fielding writ,—"</L>

<L>ON a wild Moor, all brown and bleak,</L>

<L>There stood a tenement antique;</L>
<L>Lord Hoppergollop's country house.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here Silence reign'd, with lips of glue,</L>
<L>And undisturb'd maintain'd her law;</L>
<L>Save when the Owl cry'd "whoo! whoo! whoo!"</L>
<L>Or the hoarse Crow croak'd "caw! caw! caw!"</L>

<L>Neglected mansion!—for, 'tis said,</L>

</LG>

<L>Weak Hoppergollop!—Lords may moan,</L>

<L>Swift whirl the wheels.—He's gone.—a Rose</L>

<L>A bolder, far, than my weak note,</L>

<L>Long had the fair one sat alone,</L>
<L>Had none remain'd save only she;—</L>
<L>She by herself had been—if one</L>
<L>Had not been left, for company.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas a tall youth, whose cheek's clear hue</L>
<L>Was tinged with health, and manly toil;</L>
<L>Cabbage he sow'd, and, when it grew,</L>
<L>He alwys cut it off, to boil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft would he cry "Delve, Delve the hole!"</L>
<L>"And prune the tree, and trim the root!"</L>
<L>"And stick the wig upon the pole,"</L>
<L>"To scare the sparrows from the fruit!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A small, mute favourite, by day,</L>
<L>Follow'd his step; where'er he wheels</L>
<L>His barrow round the garden gay,</L>
<L>A bob-tail cur is at his heels.</L>

<L>Ah, man! the brute creation see!</L>
<L>Thy constancy oft needs the spur!</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard toil'd the youth, so fresh and strong,</L>
<L>While Bobtail in his face would look,</L>
<L>And mark'd his master troll the song,—</L>
<L>"Sweet Molly Dumpling! O, thou Cook!"—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For thus he sung:—while Cupid smiled;—</L>
<L>Pleased that the Gard'ner own'd his dart;</L>

</LG>

<L>Maid of the Moor! his love return!</L>
<L>True love ne'er tints the cheek with shame:</L>

<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
<L>Ah! not averse from love was she;</L>
<L>Though pure as Heaven's snowy flake;</L>
<L>Both loved:—and, though a Gard'ner he,</L>
<L>He knew not what it was to rake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cold blows the blast:—the night's obscure:</L>
<L>The mansion's crazy wainscoats crack:</L>
<L>The sun had sunk:—and all the Moor,</L>
<L>Like ev'ry other Moor,—was black.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alone, pale, trembling, near the fire,</L>
<L>The lovely Molly Dumpling sat,</L>
<L>Much did she fear, and much admire,</L>
<L>What Thomas Gard'ner could be at.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Listening, her hand supports her chin;</L>
<L>But, ah! no foot is heard to stir:</L>
<L>He comes not, from the garden, in;</L>
<L>Nor he, nor little Bobtail cur.</L>

<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
<L>They cannot come, sweet maid, to thee!</L>
<L>Flesh, both of cur and man, is grass!</L>
<L>And what's impossible, can't be;</L>
<L>And never, never, comes to pass!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She paces through the hall antique,</L>
<L>To call her Thomas from his toil;</L>
<L>Opes the huge door;—the hinges creak;—</L>
<L>Because the hinges wanted oil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice, on the threshold of the hall,</L>
<L>She "Thomas" cried, with many a sob;</L>
<L>And thrice on Bobtail did she call,</L>
<L>Exclaiming sweetly—"Bob! Bob! Bob!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Vain maid! a Gard'ner's corpse, 'tis said,</L>
<L>In answers can but ill succeed;</L>
<L>And, dogs that hear when they are dead</L>
<L>Are very cunning Dogs, indeed!</L>
</LG>

<L>Back thro' the hall she bent her way;</L>
<L>All, all was solitude around!</L>
<L>The candle shed a feeble ray,—</L>
<L>Though a large mould of four to th' pound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full closely to the fire she drew;</L>
<L>Adown her cheek a salt tear stole;</L>
<L>When, lo! a coffin out there flew,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Spiders their busy death-watch tick'd;</L>
<L>A certain sign that fate will frown;</L>
<L>The clumsy kitchen clock, too, click'd;</L>
<L>A certain sign it was not down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>More strong and strong her terrors rose;—</L>
<L>Her shadow did the maid appall;—</L>
<L>She trembled at her lovely nose,—</L>
<L>It look'd so long against the wall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
<L>Up to her chamber, damp and cold,</L>
<L>She climb'd Lord Hoppergollop's stair;—</L>
<L>Three stories high, long, dull, and old,—</L>
<L>As great Lords stories often are.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All Nature now appear'd to pause;</L>
<L>And "o'er the one half world seem'd dead;"</L>
<L>No "curtain'd sleep" had she;—because</L>
<L>She had no curtains to her bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Listening she lay;—with iron din,</L>
<L>The clock struck <HI>Twelve</HI>; the door flew wide;</L>
<L>When Thomas grimly glided in,</L>
<L>With little Bobtail by his side▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tall, like the poplar, was his size;</L>
<L>Green, green his waistcoat was, as leeks;</L>
<L>Red, red as beet-root, were his eyes;</L>

<L>Soon as the Spectre she espied,</L>

<L>He wrote this verse;</L>

<L>Next morning, early, Bolus rose;</L>

<L>Will Waddle, whose temper was studious, and lonely,</L>
<L>Hired lodgings that took Single Gentlemen, only;</L>
<L>But Will was so fat he appeared like a ton;—</L>
<L>Or like two Single Gentlemen, roll'd into One.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
<L>He entered his rooms; and to bed he retreated,</L>
<L>But, all the night long, he felt fever'd and heated;</L>
<L>And, though heavy to weigh, as a score of fat sheep,</L>
<L>He was not, by any means, heavy to sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next night 'twas the same;—and the next;—and the next;</L>
<L>He perspired like an ox; he was nervous, and vex'd;</L>
<L>Week passed after week; till, by weekly succession,</L>
<L>His weakly condition was past all expression.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In six months, his acquaintance began much to doubt him;</L>
<L>For his skin, "like a lady's loose gown," hung about him;</L>
<L>He sent for a Doctor; and cried, like a ninny,</L>
<L>"I have lost many pounds—make me well—there's a guinea."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
<L>The Doctor look'd wise:—"a slow fever," he said:</L>
<L>Prescribed sudorificks,—and going to bed.</L>
<L>"Sudorificks in bed," exclaimed "Will" are humbugs;"</L>
<L>"I've enough of them there, without paying for drugs."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WILL kick'd out the Doctor:—but when ill indeed,</L>
<L>E'en dismissing the Doctor don't <HI>always</HI> succeed;</L>
<L>So, calling his host,—he said,—"Sir, do you know,</L>
<L>"I'm the fat Single Gentleman, six months ago?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Look'e, landlord, I think" argued Will, with a grin,</L>
<L>"That with honest intentions you first <HI>took me in</HI>;"</L>
<L>"But from the first night—and to say it I'm bold"—</L>
<L>"I have been so damn'd hot, that I'm sure I caught "cold."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quoth the landlord—"till now, I ne'er had a dispute;</L>
<L>"I've let lodgings ten years;—I'm a Baker to boot;</L>
<L>"In airing your sheets, Sir, my wife is no sloven,</L>
<L>"And your bed is immediately—over my Oven."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
<L>"The Oven"!!! says Will—says the host, "why this passion?"</L>
<L>"In that excellent bed died three people of fashion.</L>
<L>"Why so crusty, good sir?" "Zounds!"—cries Will, in a taking,</L>
<L>"Who wouldn't be crusty, with half a year's baking?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WILL paid for his rooms; cried the host, with a sneer,</L>
<L>"Well, I see you've been <HI>going away</HI> half a year,"</L>
<L>"Friend, we can't well agree"—"yet no quarrel"— Will said;</L>
<L>"For one man may die where another makes bread."</L>
