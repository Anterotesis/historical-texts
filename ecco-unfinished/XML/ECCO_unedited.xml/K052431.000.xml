<HEAD>TO
THE RIGHT REVEREND
EDMUND LAW, D. D.
LORD BISHOP OF CARLISLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD the obligations which I owe to
your Lordship's kindness been much less,
or much fewer, than they are; had per∣sonal
gratitude left any place in my mind
for deliberation or for enquiry; in select∣ing
a name which every reader might
confess to be prefixed, with propriety, to
a work, that, in many of its parts, bears
no obscure relation to the general prin∣ciples
of natural and revealed religion, I
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
should have found myself directed by
many considerations to that of the Bishop
of Carlisle. A long life, spent in the most
interesting of all human pursuits, the in∣vestigation
of moral and religious truth,
in constant and unwearied endeavours to
advance the discovery, communication,
and success of both; a life so occupied,
and arrived at that period which renders
every life venerable, commands respect
by a title, which no virtuous mind will
dispute, which no mind sensible of the
importance of these studies to the su∣preme
concernments of mankind, will
not rejoice to see acknowledged. What∣ever
difference, or whatever opposition,
some, who peruse your Lordship's writ∣ings,
may perceive between your conclu∣sions
and their own, the good and wise of
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
all persuasions will revere that industry,
which has for its object the illustration
or defence of our common Christianity.
Your Lordship's researches have never
lost sight of one purpose, namely, to re∣cover
the simplicity of the gospel from
beneath that load of unauthorized addi∣tions,
which the ignorance of some ages,
and the learning of others, the supersti∣tion
of weak, and the craft of designing
men, have unhappily for its interest
heaped upon it. And this purpose, I am
convinced, was dictated by the purest mo∣tive;
by a firm, and, I think, a just
opinion, that whatever renders religion
more rational, renders it more credible;
that he, who, by a diligent and faithful
examination of the original records, dis∣misses
from the system one article, which
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
contradicts the apprehension, the experi∣ence,
or the reasoning of mankind, does
more towards recommending the belief,
and, with the belief, the influence of
Christianity, to the understandings and
consciences of serious enquirers, and
through them to universal reception and
authority, than can be effected by a
thousand contenders for creeds and or∣dinances
of human establishment.</P>
<P>When the doctrine of transubstantia∣tion
had taken possession of the Chris∣tian
world, it was not without the in∣dustry
of learned men that it came at
length to be discovered, that no such
doctrine was contained in the New Tes∣tament.
But had those excellent per∣sons
done nothing more by their disco∣covery,
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
than abolished an innocent su∣perstition,
or changed some directions in
the ceremonial of public worship, they
had merited little of that veneration,
with which the gratitude of protestant
churches contemplates their services. What
they did for mankind was this, they ex∣onerated
Christianity of a weight which
sunk it. If indolence or timidity had
checked these exertions, or suppressed
the fruit and publication of these enqui∣ries,
is it too much to affirm, that infi∣delity
would at this day have been uni∣versal?
I do not mean, my Lord, by
the mention of this example to insinu∣ate,
that any popular opinion which
your Lordship may have encountered,
ought to be compared with transubstan∣tion,
or that the assurance with which
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
we reject that extravagant absurdity, is
attainable in the controversies in which
your Lordship has been engaged; but I
mean, by calling to mind those great
reformers of the public faith, to observe,
or rather to express my own persuasion,
that to restore the purity, is most effectu∣ally
to promote the progress of Christi∣anity;
and that the same virtuous mo∣tive,
which hath sanctified their labours,
suggested yours. At a time when some
men appear not to perceive any good,
and others to suspect an evil tendency, in
that spirit of examination and research
which is gone forth in Christian coun∣tries,
this testimony is due not only to
the rectitude of your Lordship's views,
but to the general cause of intellectual and
religious liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
That your Lordship's life may be pro∣longed
in health and honour; that it
may afford whilst it continues an instruc∣tive
proof, how serene and easy old age
can be made, by the memory of impor∣tant
and well intended labours, by the
possession of public and deserved esteem,
by the presence of many grateful rela∣tives;
above all by the resources of reli∣gion,
by an unshaken confidence in the
designs of a “faithful Creator,” and a
settled trust in the truth and in the pro∣mises
of Christianity, is the fervent prayer of, my Lord,</P>
<CLOSER>Your Lordship's dutiful,
Most obliged,
And most devoted servant,

<PB REF="10"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the treatises that I have met with upon,
the subject of <HI>morals,</HI> I appear to myself to
have remarked the following imperfections—either
that the principle was erroneous, or that it was
indistinctly explained, or that the rules deduced
from it, were not sufficiently adapted to real life
and to actual situations. The writings of Grotius,
and the larger work of Puffendorf are of too
<HI>forensic</HI> a cast, too much mixed up with the civil
law, and with the jurisprudence of Germany, to
answer precisely the design of a system of ethics—
<PB N="ii" REF="11"/>
the direction of private consciences in the gene∣ral
conduct of human life. Perhaps, indeed, they
are not to be regarded, so much as institutes of
morality, calculated to instruct an individual in
his duty, as a species of law books and law autho∣rities,
suited to the practice of those courts of jus∣tice,
whose decisions are regulated by certain
general principles of natural equity combined with
the maxims of the Roman code: of which kind,
I understand, there are many upon the continent.
To which may be added, concerning both these
authors, that they are more occupied in describ∣ing
the rights and usages of independent commu∣nities,
than is necessary in a work which professes
not to adjust the correspondence of nations, but
to delineate the offices of domestic life. The
profusion also of classical quotations, with which
many of their pages abound, seems to me a fault
from which it will not be easy to excuse them.
If these extracts be intended as decorations of
style, the composition is overloaded with orna∣ments
of one kind. To any thing more than
<PB N="iii" REF="12"/>
ornament they can make no claim. To propose
them as serious arguments; gravely to attempt
to establish or fortify a moral duty by the testi∣mony
of a Greek or Roman poet, is to trifle with
the attention of the reader, or rather to take it
off from all just principles of reasoning in morals.</P>
<P>Of our own writers in this branch of philosophy,
I find none that I think perfectly free from the
three objections which I have stated. There is like∣wise
a fourth property observable in almost all of
them, namely, that they divide too much the law of
nature from the precepts of revelation; some au∣thors
industriously declining the mention of scrip∣ture
authorities, as belonging to a different province,
and others reserving them for a separate volume:
which appears to me much the same defect, as if
a commentator on the laws of England should
content himself with stating upon each head the
common law of the land, without taking any no∣tice
of acts of parliament; or should chuse to
give his readers the common law in one book,
<PB N="iv" REF="13"/>
and the statute law in another. “When the obli∣gations
of morality are taught,” says a pious and
celebrated writer, “let the sanctions of Christia∣nity
never be forgotten; by which it will be
shewn that they give strength and lustre to each
other; religion will appear to be the voice of rea∣son,
and morality the will of God.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to the Preceptor, by Dr. Johnson.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>manner,</HI> also, in which modern writers
have treated of subjects of morality, is, in my
judgment, liable to much exception. It has be∣come
of late a fashion to deliver moral institutes
in strings or series of detached propositions, with∣out
subjoining a continued argument or regular
dissertation to any of them. This sententious,
apothegmatizing style, by crowding propositions
and paragraphs too fast, upon the mind, and by
carrying the eye of the reader from subject to sub∣ject
in too quick a succession, gains not a suffi∣cient
hold upon the attention, to leave either the
memory furnished, or the understanding satisfied.
<PB N="v" REF="14"/>
However useful a syllabus of topics, or a series
of propositions may be in the hands of a lecturer,
or as a guide to a student, who is supposed to con∣sult
other books, or to institute upon each subject
researches of his own, the method is by no means
convenient for ordinary readers; because few
readers are such <HI>thinkers</HI> as to want only a hint
to set their thoughts at work upon; or such as
will pause and tarry at every proposition, till they
have traced out its dependency, proof, relation,
and consequences, before they permit themselves
to step on to another. A respectable writer of this
class<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ferguson, author of “Institutes of Moral Philosophy,” 1767.</NOTE> has comprized his doctrine of slavery in
the three following propositions.</P>
<P>“No one is born a slave, because every one is
born with all his original rights.”</P>
<P>“No one can become a slave, because no one
from being a person can, in the language of the
Roman law, become a thing, or subject of pro∣perty.”</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="15"/>
“The supposed property of the master in the
slave, therefore, is matter of usurpation, not of
right.”</P>
<P>It may be possible to deduce from these few
adages such a theory of the primitive rights of
human nature, as will evince the illegality of sla∣very;
but surely an author requires too much of
his reader, when he expects him to make these
deductions for himself? or to supply, perhaps,
from some remote chapter of the same treatise,
the several proofs and explanations, which are
necessary to render the meaning and truth of these
assertions intelligible.</P>
<P>There is a fault, the opposite of this, which
some moralists who have adopted a different, and,
I think, a better plan of composition, have not
always been careful to avoid; namely, the dwel∣ling
upon verbal and elementary distinctions, with
a labour and prolixity, proportioned much more
to the subtlety of the question, than to its value
<PB N="vii" REF="16"/>
and importance in the prosecution of the subject.
A writer upon the law of nature,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Rutherforth, author of “Institutes of Natural Law.”</NOTE> whose expli∣cations
in every part of philosophy, though al∣ways
diffuse, are often very successful, has em∣ployed
three long sections in endeavouring to
prove, that, “permissions are not laws.” The
discussion of this controversy, however essential it
might be to dialectic precision, was certainly not
necessary to the progress of a work designed to
describe the duties and obligations of civil life.
The reader becomes impatient when he is detained
by disquisitions which have no other object than
the settling of terms and phrases? and, what is
worse, they, for whose use such books are chiefly
intended, will not be persuaded to read them at
all.</P>
<P>I am led to propose these strictures, not by any
propensity to depreciate the labours of my predeces∣sors,
much less to invite a comparison between the
merits of their performances and my own, but solely
<PB N="viii" REF="17"/>
by the consideration, that, when a writer offers a
book to the public upon a subject, in which the
public are already in possession of many others,
he is bound by a kind of literary justice, to in∣form
his readers distinctly and specifically, what
it is he professes to supply, and what he expects to
improve. The imperfections above enumerated are
those which I have endeavoured to avoid or remedy.
Of the execution the reader must judge, but this
was the design. Concerning the <HI>principle</HI> of mo∣rals
it would be premature to speak; but concern∣ing
the manner of unfolding and explaining that
principle, I have somewhat which I wish to be
remarked. An experience of nine years in the
office of a public tutor in one of the universities,
and in that department of education to which
these chapters relate, afforded me frequent occasion
to observe, that, in discoursing to young minds
upon topics of morality, it required much more
pains to make them perceive the difficulty, than
to understand the solution; that, unless the sub∣ject
was so drawn up to a point, as to present the
<PB N="ix" REF="18"/>
full force of an objection, or the exact place of a
doubt, before any explanation was entered upon;
in other words, unless some curiosity was excited
before it was attempted to be satisfied, the labour
of the teacher was lost. When information was
not requested, it was seldom, I found, retained.
I have made this observation my guide in the fol∣lowing
work; that is, upon each occasion I have
endeavoured, before I suffered myself to proceed
in the disquisition, to put the reader in complete
possession of the question; and to do it in the way
that I thought most likely to stir up his own doubts
and solicitude about it.</P>
<P>In pursuing the principle of morals through the
detail of cases to which it is applicable, I have had
in view to accommodate both the choice of the
subjects, and the manner of handling them, to the
situations which arise in the life of an inhabitant
of this country, in these times. This is the thing
that I think to be principally wanting in former
treatises, and, perhaps, the chief advantage which
<PB N="viii" REF="19"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="ix" REF="20"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="x" REF="21"/>
will be found in mine. I have examined no
doubts, I have discussed no obscurities, I have en∣countered
no errors, I have adverted to no con∣troversies,
but what I have seen actually to
exist. If some of the questions treated of appear
to a more instructed reader minute or puerile,
I desire such reader to be assured that I have
found them occasions of difficulty to young
minds; and what I have observed in young minds,
I should expect to meet with in all who approach
these subjects for the first time. Upon each
article of human duty, I have combined with the
conclusions of reason, the declarations of scripture,
when they are to be had, as of co-ordinate
authority, and as both terminating in the same
sanctions.</P>
<P>In the <HI>manner</HI> of the work, I have endeavoured
so to temper the opposite plans above animadverted
upon, as that the reader may not accuse me
either of too much haste, or of too much delay.
I have bestowed upon each subject enough of dis∣sertation
<PB N="xi" REF="22"/>
to give a body and substance to the chap∣ter
in which it is treated of, as well as coherence
and perspicuity; on the other hand, I have sel∣dom,
I hope, exercised the patience of the reader
by the length and prolixity of my essays, or dis∣appointed
that patience at last, by the tenuity and
unimportance of the conclusion.</P>
<P>There are two particulars in the following
work for which it may be thought necessary that
I should offer some excuse. The first of which
is, that I have scarcely ever referred to any other
book, or mentioned the name of the author whose
thoughts, and sometimes, possibly, whose very
expressions I have adopted. My method of writ∣ing
has constantly been this; to extract what I
could from my own stores, and my own reflec∣tions
in the first place; to put down that; and
afterwards to consult upon each subject such read∣ing
as fell in my way: which order, I am con∣vinced,
is the only one whereby any person can
keep his thoughts from sliding into other men's
<PB N="xii" REF="23"/>
trains. The effect of such a plan upon the pro∣duction
itself will be, that whilst some parts in
matter or manner may be new, others will be
little else than a repetition of the old. I make
no pretensions to perfect originality: I claim to be
something more than a mere compiler. Much
no doubt is borrowed; but the fact is, that the
notes for this work having been prepared for
some years; and such things having been from
time to time inserted in them, as appeared to me
worth preserving; and such insertions having been
made, commonly, without the name of the author
from whom they were taken, I should, at this
time, have found a difficulty in recovering these
names with sufficient exactness to be able to ren∣der
to every man his own. Nor, to speak the
truth, did it appear to me worth while to repeat
the search merely for this purpose. When autho∣rities
are relied upon, names must be produced:
when a discovery has been made in science, it may
be unjust to borrow the invention, without ac∣knowledging
<PB N="xiii" REF="24"/>
the author. But in an argumentative
treatise, and upon a subject, which allows no
place for discovery or invention, properly so cal∣ed;
and in which all that can belong to a writer
is his mode of reasoning, or his judgment of pro∣babilities;
I should have thought it superfluous,
had it been easier to me than it was, to have in∣terrupted
my text, or crouded my margin with
references to every author, whose sentiments I have
made use of. There is, however, one work to
which I owe so much, that it would be ungrate∣ful
not to confess the obligation; I mean the writ∣ings
of the late Abraham Tucker, Es{que} part of
which were published by himself, and the remain∣der
since his death, under the title of “The Light
of Nature pursued, by Edward Search, Esq.” I
have found in this writer more original thinking
and observation upon the several subjects that
he has taken in hand, than in any other, not to say,
than in all others put together. His talent also for
illustration is unrivalled. But his thoughts are
<PB N="xiv" REF="25"/>
diffused through a long, various, and irregular
work. I shall account it no mean praise, if I
have been sometimes able to dispose into method,
to collect into heads and articles, or to exhibit
in more compact and tangible masses, what, in
that otherwise excellent performance, is spread
over too much surface.</P>
<P>The next circumstance for which some apology
may be expected, is the joining of moral and poli∣tical
philosophy together, or the addition of a book
of politics to a system of ethics. Against this
objection, if it be made one, I might defend my∣self
by the example of many approved writers, who have treated, <HI>de officiis hominis et civis,</HI> or, as
some chuse to express it, “of the rights and obli∣gations
of man, in his individual and social capa∣city,”
in the same book. I might alledge also, that
the part a member of the commonwealth shall take
in political contentions, the vote he shall give, the
counsels he shall approve, the support he shall afford,
<PB N="xv" REF="26"/>
or the opposition he shall make, to any system of
public measures, is as much a question of personal
duty, as much concerns the conscience of the indi∣vidual,
who deliberates, as the determination of any
doubt which relates to the conduct of private
life; that consequently political philosophy is,
properly speaking, a continuation of moral phi∣losophy;
or rather, indeed, a part of it, suppos∣ing
moral philosophy to have for its aim, the in∣formation
of the human conscience in every de∣liberation
that is likely to come before it. I might
avail myself of these excuses, if I wanted them;
but the vindication upon which I rely, is the
following. In stating the principle of morals, the
reader will observe, that I have employed some
industry in explaining the theory, and shewing
the necessity of <HI>general rules;</HI> without the full
and constant consideration of which, I am per∣suaded
that no system of moral philosophy can
be satisfactory or consistent. This foundation be∣ing
laid, or rather, this habit being formed, the
<PB N="xvi" REF="27"/>
discussion of political subjects, to which, more
than to almost any other, general rules are appli∣cable,
became clear and easy. Whereas had these
topics been assigned to a distinct work, it would
have been necessary to have repeated the same
rudiments, to have established over again the
same principles, as those which we had already
exemplified, and rendered familiar to the reader,
in the former parts of this. In a word, if
there appear to any one too great a diversity,
or too wide a distance between the subjects
treated of, in the course of the present volume,
let him be reminded, that the doctrine of gene∣ral
rules pervades and connects the whole.</P>
<P>It may not be improper, however, to admonish
the reader, that, under the name of <HI>politics,</HI> he
is not to look for those occasional controversies,
which the occurrences of the present day, or
any temporary situation of public affairs may
excite; and most of which, if not beneath the
<PB N="xvii" REF="28"/>
dignity, it is beside the purpose of a philoso∣phical
institution to advert to. He will perceive
that the several disquisitions are framed with a refe∣rence
to the condition of this country, and of this
government; but it seemed to me to belong to the
design of a work like the following, not so much
to discuss each altercated point with the particularity
of a political pamphlet upon the subject, as to deliver
those universal principles, and to exhibit, as well
as I was able, that mode and train of reasoning
in politics, by the due application of which every
man might be enabled to attain to just conclusions
of his own.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant of an objection that has been
advanced against all abstract speculations concern∣ing
the origin, principle, or limitation of civil
authority, namely, that they possess little or no
influence upon the conduct either of the state or
of the subject, of the governors or the governed;
nor are attended with any useful consequences to
<PB N="xviii" REF="29"/>
either; that in times of tranquillity they are not
wanted, in times of confusion they are never heard.
This representation, however, in my opinion, is
not just. Times of tumult, it is true, are not
the times to learn; but the election men
make of their side and party, in the most
critical occasions of the commonwealth, may,
nevertheless, depend upon the lessons they have
received, the books they have read, and the opi∣nions
they have imbibed, in seasons of leisure and
quietness. Some judicious persons, who were
present at Geneva, during the troubles which
lately convulsed that city, thought they perceived,
in the contentions there carrying on, the operation
of that political theory, which the writings of
Rousseau, and the unbounded esteem in which
these writings are held by his countrymen, had
diffused amongst the people. Throughout the
political disputes that have within these few years
taken place in Great Britain, in her sister kingdom,
and in her foreign dependencies; in the language
<PB N="xix" REF="30"/>
of party, in the resolutions of popular meetings,
in debate, in conversation, in the general strain of
those fugitive and diurnal addresses to the pub∣lic,
which such occasions call forth, it was im∣possible
not to observe the prevalency of those
ideas of civil authority which are displayed in the
works of Mr. Locke. The credit of that great
name, the courage and liberality of his principles,
the skill and clearness with which his arguments
are proposed, no less than the weight of the argu∣ments
themselves, have given a reputation and
currency to his opinions, of which, I am per∣suaded,
in any unsettled state of public affairs,
the influence would be felt. As this is not a
place for examining the truth or tendency of these
doctrines, I would not be understood, by what I
have said, to express any judgment concerning
either. I only mean to remark, that such doc∣trines
are not without effect; and that it is of
<HI>practical</HI> importance, to have the principles from
which the obligations of social union, and the ex∣tent
<PB N="xx" REF="31"/>
of civil obedience are derived, rightly explained
and well understood. Indeed, as far as I have
observed, in political, beyond all other subjects,
where men are without some fundamental and
scientific principles to resort to, they are liable
to have their understandings played upon by cant
phrases and unmeaning terms, of which every
party in every country possess a vocabulary. We
appear astonished when we see the multitude led
away by sounds; but we should remember, that,
if sounds work miracles, it is always upon igno∣rance.
The influence of names is in exact pro∣portion
to the want of knowledge.</P>
<P>These are the observations with which I have
judged it expedient to prepare the attention of my
reader. Concerning the personal motives which
engaged me in the following attempt, it is not
necessary that I say much; the nature of my
academical situation, a great deal of leisure since
my retirement from it, the recommendation of an
<PB N="xxi" REF="32"/>
honoured and excellent friend, the authority of
the venerable prelate to whom these labours are
inscribed, the not perceiving in what way I could
employ my time or talents better, and my disap∣probation,
in literary men, of that fastidious indo∣lence,
which sits still, because it disdains to do
<HI>little,</HI> were the considerations that directed my
thoughts to this design. Nor have I repented of
the undertaking. Whatever be the fate or recep∣tion
of this work, it owes its author nothing. In
sickness, and in health, I have found in it that,
which can alone alleviate, the one, or give enjoy∣ment
to the other—occupation and engagement.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Definition and Use of the Science.</HEAD>
<P>MORALITY, Moral Philosophy, Ethics, Casuistry,
Natural Law, mean all the same thing; namely,
<HI>That science which teaches men their duty and the
reasons of it.</HI></P>
<P>The use of such a study depends upon this, that,
without it, the rules of life, by which men are ordinarily
governed, oftentimes mislead them, thro' a defect either
in the rule, or in the application.</P>
<P>These rules are, the Law of Honour, the Law of the
Land, and the Scriptures.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="2" REF="40"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Law of Honour.</HEAD>
<P>THE Law of Honour is a system of rules constructed
by people of fashion, and calculated to facilitate
their intercourse with one another: and for no other pur∣pose.</P>
<P>Consequently, nothing is adverted to by the Law of
Honour, but what tends to incommode this intercourse.</P>
<P>Hence this law only prescribes and regulates the duties
<HI>betwixt equals;</HI> omitting such as relate to the Supreme
Being, as well as those which we owe to our inferiors.</P>
<P>For which reason profaneness; neglect of public wor∣ship
or private devotion; cruelty to servants; rigorous treat∣ment
of tenants or other dependants; want of charity to
the poor; injuries done to tradesmen by insolvency or de∣lay
of payment; with numberless examples of the same
kind, are accounted no breaches of honour; because a
man is not a less agreeable companion for these vices, nor
the worse to deal with, in those concerns which are usually
transacted between persons of honour.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="41"/>
Again, the Law of Honour, being constituted by men
occupied in the pursuit of pleasure, and for the mutual
convenience of such men, will be found, as might be ex∣pected
from the character and design of the law-makers,
to be, in most instances, favourable to the licentious indul∣gence
of the natural passions.</P>
<P>Thus it allows of fornication, adultery, drunkenness,
prodigality, duelling, and revenge in the extreme; and
lays no stress upon the virtues opposite to these.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Law of the Land.</HEAD>
<P>THAT part of mankind, who are beneath the Law
of Honour, often make the Law of the Land
their rule of life; that is, they are satisfied with them∣selves,
so long as they do or omit nothing, for the doing
or omitting of which the law can punish them.</P>
<P>Whereas every system of human laws, considered as a
rule of life, labours under the two following defects:</P>
<P>I. Human laws omit many duties, as not objects of
compulsion; such as piety to God, bounty to the poor,
<PB N="4" REF="42"/>
forgiveness of injuries, education of children, gratitude to
benefactors, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Law, never speaks but to command, nor commands
but where it can compell; consequently those duties,
which by their nature must be <HI>voluntary,</HI> are left out of
the statute book, as lying beyond the reach of it's opera∣tion
and authority.</P>
<P>II. Human laws permit, or which is the same thing,
suffer to go unpunished, many crimes, because incapable
of being defined by any previous description.—Of which
nature is luxury, prodigality, partiality in voting at those
elections, where the qualification of the candidate ought
to determine the success—caprice in the disposition of
men's fortunes at their death—disrespect to parents—and a
multitude of similar examples.</P>
<P>For this is the alternative; the Law must either define,
beforehand, and with precision, the offences which it pu∣nishes,
or must leave it to the <HI>discretion</HI> of the magistrate,
to determine upon each particular case, whether it consti∣tutes
that offence which the law designed to punish, or not;
which is, in effect, leaving it to the magistrate to punish
or not to punish, at his pleasure, the individual who is
brought before him—-which is just so much tyranny.
Where, therefore, as in the instances above-mentioned,
the distinction between right and wrong is of too subtle or
too secret a nature, to be ascertained by any preconcerted
<PB N="5" REF="43"/>
language, the law of most countries, especially of free
states, rather than commit the liberty of the subject to the
discretion of the magistrate, leaves men in such cases to
themselves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER expects to find in the Scriptures, par∣ticular
directions for every moral doubt that
arises, looks for more than he will meet with. And to
what a magnitude such a detail of particular precepts
would have enlarged the sacred volume, may be partly
understood from hence—The laws of this country, includ∣ing
the acts of the legislature and the decisions of our
supreme courts of justice, are not contained in fewer than
fifty folio volumes; and yet it is not one time in ten, that
you can find the case you look for, in any law-book what∣ever;
to say nothing, of those numerous points of conduct,
in which the law does not profess to prescribe or determine
any thing.</P>
<P>Had then the same particularity, which obtains in hu∣man
laws, so far as they go, been attempted in the Scrip∣tures,
<PB N="6" REF="44"/>
throughout the whole extent of morality, it is ma∣nifest,
they would have been by much too bulky to be
either read or circulated; or rather as St. John says, “even
the world itself could not contain the books that should be
written.”</P>
<P>Morality is taught in Scripture in this wise—-General
rules are laid down of piety, justice, benevolence, and
purity—such as worshiping God in spirit and in truth—doing
as we would be done by—loving our neighbour as
ourself—forgiving others, as we expect forgiveness from
God—that mercy is better than sacrifice—that not that
which entereth into a man, (nor by parity of reason, any
ceremonial pollutions) but that which proceedeth from the
heart, defileth him. Several of these rules are occasionally
illustrated, either in <HI>fictitious examples,</HI> as the parable of
the good Samaritan—of the cruel servant, who refused to
his fellow-servant, that indulgence and compassion which his
master had just shewn to him; <HI>or in instances which actually
presented themselves,</HI> as the reproof of his disciples at the Sa∣maritan
village—-the praise of the poor widow, who cast in
her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mite—the censure of the Pharisees, who chose out the
chief rooms—and of the tradition, whereby they evaded the
command to sustain their indigent parents—<HI>or in the reso∣lution
of questions, which those about our Saviour proposed
to him,</HI> as his answer to the young man who asked him,
“What lack I yet?” and to the honest scribe, who had
found out even in that age and country, that to love God
<PB N="7" REF="45"/>
and his neighbour, was more than all whole burnt offer∣ings
and sacrifice.</P>
<P>And this is the way in which all practical sciences are
taught, as Arithmetic, Grammar, Navigation, and the like.—Rules
are laid down, and examples are subjoined; not that
these examples are the cases, much less all the cases that
will actually occur, but by way only of explaining the
principle of the rule, and as so many specimens of the me∣thod
of applying it.—The chief difference is, that the ex∣amples
in Scripture are not annexed to the rules, with the
didactic regularity to which we are now-a-days accustomed,
but delivered dispersedly, as particular occasions suggested,
which gave them however, especially to those who heard
them, and were present to the occasions which produced
them, an energy and persuasion, much beyond what the
same, or any instances would have appeared with, in their
places in a system.</P>
<P>Besides this, the Scriptures commonly presuppose in
the person they speak to, a knowledge of the principles of
natural justice; and are employed, not so much to teach
<HI>new</HI> rules of morality, as to enforce the practice of it by
<HI>new</HI> sanctions, and a <HI>greater certainty;</HI> which last part
seems to be the proper business of a revelation from God;
and what was most wanted.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="46"/>
Thus the “unjust, covenant breakers, and extortioners”
are condemned in scripture, supposing it known, or leaving
it, where it admits of doubt, to moralists to determine, what
injustice, extortion, or breach of contract are.</P>
<P>The above considerations are intended to prove, that the
scriptures do not supersede the use of the science we pro∣fess
to treat of; and to acquit them of any charge of imper∣fection
or insufficiency on that account.</P>

<P>“THE father of <HI>Caius Toranius</HI> had been proscribed by
the triumvirate. Caius Toranius coming over to
the interests of that party discovered to the officers, who
were in pursuit of the old man's life, the place where he
concealed himself, and gave them withall a description,
by which they might distinguish his person, when they
found him. The aged parent, more anxious for the safety
and fortunes of his son, than about the little that might
remain of his own life, began immediately to enquire of
the officers who seized him, whether his son was well,
whether he had done his duty to the satisfaction of his
generals. That son, replied one of the officers, so dear to
<PB N="9" REF="47"/>
thy affections, betrayed thee to us; by his information
thou art apprehended, and diest. The officer with this
struck a poniard to his heart, and the unhappy father
fell, not so much affected by his fate, as by the means
to which he owed it.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>“Caius Toranius triumvirum partes secutus, proscripti patris sui prae∣torii et ornati viri latebras, aetatem, notasque corporis, quibus agnosci posset, centurionibus edidit, qui eum persecuti sunt.

<P>Now the question is, whether, if this story were re∣lated
to the wild boy, caught some years ago in the woods
of Hanover, or to a savage, without experience, and with∣out
instruction, cut off, from his infancy, from all inter∣course
with his species, and consequently under no possible
influence of example, authority, education, sympathy, or
habit; whether, I say, such a one would feel upon the re∣lation,
any degree of <HI>that sentiment of disapprobation of Tora∣nius's
conduct,</HI> which we feel, or not.</P>
<P>Those who maintain the existence of a moral sense—of
innate maxims—-of a natural conscience—that the love of
virtue and hatred of vice are instinctive—or the perception
<PB N="10" REF="48"/>
of right and wrong intuitive, (all which are only different
ways of expressing the same thing) affirm that he would.</P>
<P>Those who deny the existence of a moral sense, &amp;c. affirm
that he would not.—</P>
<P>And upon this issue is joined.</P>
<P>As the experiment has never been tried; and from the
difficulty of procuring a subject (not to mention the im∣possibility
of proposing the question to him, if we had one)
is never likely to be tried, what would be the event, can
only be judged of from probable reasons.</P>
<P>Those who contend for the affirmative, observe, that we
approve examples of generosity, gratitude, fidelity, &amp;c.
and condemn the contrary, instantly—without deliberation—without
having any interest of ours concerned in them—oftimes
without being conscious of, or able to give, any
reason for our approbation—that this approbation is uni∣form
and universal; the same sorts of conduct being ap∣proved
or disapproved in all ages and countries of the world—All
which circumstances, say they, strongly indicate the
operation of an instinct or moral sense.</P>
<P>On the other hand, answers have been given to most of
these arguments, by the patrons of the opposite system;
and,</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="49"/>
First, as to the <HI>uniformity</HI> above alledged, they contra∣vert
the fact. They remark, from authentic accounts of
historians and travellers, that there is scarce a single vice,
which in some age or country of the world, has not been
countenanced by public opinion—that in one country it is
esteemed an office of piety to sustain their aged parents;
in another to dispatch them out of the way—that suicide
in one age of the world is heroism; in another felony—that
theft, which is punished by most laws, by the laws
of Sparta was sometimes rewarded—-that the promiscu∣ous
commerce of the sexes, although condemned by the
regulations and censure of all civilized nations, is prac∣tised
by the savages of the tropical regions without reserve,
compunction, or disgrace—that crimes, of which it is no
longer permitted us even to speak, have had their advocates
amongst the sages of very renowned times—that, if an in∣habitant
of the polished nations of Europe is delighted
with the appearance, wherever he meets with it, of hap∣piness,
tranquillity, and comfort, a wild American is no
less diverted with the writhings and contorsions of a victim
at the stake—that even amongst ourselves, and in the present
improved state of moral knowledge, we are far from a perfect
consent in our opinions or feelings—that you shall hear
duelling alternately reprobated and applauded, according
to the sex, age, and station of the person you converse with—that
the forgiveness of injuries and insults is accounted by
one sort of people magnanimity, by another meanness—That
in the above instances, and perhaps most others,
moral approbation follows the fashions and institutions of
<PB N="12" REF="50"/>
the country we live in—which fashions also, and institu∣tions
themselves have grown out of the exigencies, the
climate, situation, or local circumstances of the country—or
been set up by the authority of an arbitrary chieftain,
or the unaccountable caprice of the multitude—all which,
they observe, looks very little like the steady hand,
and indelible characters, of nature. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, because, after all these exceptions and abate∣ments,
it cannot be denied, but that some sorts of actions
command and receive the esteem of mankind more than
others; and that the approbation of them is general,
though not universal: as to this they say, that the ge∣neral
approbation of virtue, even in instances where we
have no interest of our own to induce us to it, may be
accounted for, without the assistance of a moral sense;
thus:</P>
<P>Having experienced, in some instance, such a conduct
to be beneficial to ourselves, or observed that it would be
so, a sentiment of approbation rises up in our minds,
which sentiment afterwards accompanies the idea or men∣tion
of the same conduct, though the private advantage
which first excited it be no more.</P>
<P>And this continuance of the passion, after the reason of
it is ceased, is nothing more, say they, than what hap∣pens
in other cases; particularly in the love of money,
which is in no person so strong and eager, as it is oftimes
<PB N="13" REF="51"/>
found in a rich old miser, without family to provide for,
or friend to oblige by it, and to whom consequently it is
no longer (and he may be sensible of it too) of any real
use or value: yet is this man as much overjoyed with
gain, and mortified by losses, as he was the first day he
opened his shop, and when his subsistence depended upon
his success in it.</P>
<P>By these means, the custom of approving certain actions
commenced; and when once such a custom has got foot∣ing
in the world, it is no hard matter to explain how it is
transmitted and continued; for <HI>then</HI> the greatest part of
those who approve of virtue, approve it from authority,
by imitation, and from a habit of approving such and such
actions, inculcated in early youth, and receiving, as they
grow up, continual accessions of strength and vigour, from
censure and encouragement, from the books they read,
the conversation they hear, the current application of epi∣thets,
and turn of language, and the various other causes,
by which it universally comes to pass, that a society of
men, touched in the feeblest degree with the same passion,
soon communicate to one another a great degree of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>“From instances of popular tumults, seditions, factions, panics, and of all passions, which are shared with a multitude, we may learn the influence of society, in exciting and supporting any emotion; while the most un∣governable disorders are raised, we find, by that means, from the slightest and most frivolous occasions.—He must be more or less than man, who kindles not in the common blaze. What wonder then, that moral sentiments are found of such influence in life, though springing from principles, which may appear, at first sight, somewhat small and delicate?”</P>
<P>Hume's Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, Sect. <HI>IX.</HI> P. 326.</P></NOTE>—
<PB N="14" REF="52"/>
This is the case, with most of us at present; and is the
cause also, that <HI>the process of association,</HI> described in the
last paragraph but one, is now-a-days little either perceived
or wanted.</P>
<P>Amongst the causes assigned for the continuance and dif∣fusion
of the same moral sentiments amongst mankind,
we have mentioned <HI>imitation,</HI> the efficacy of which prin∣ciple
is very observable in children: and if there be any
thing in them, which deserves the name of an <HI>instinct,</HI> it is
their <HI>propensity to imitation;</HI> and there is nothing which
they imitate or apply more readily than expressions of af∣fection
and aversion, of approbation, hatred, resentment,
and the like.—And when these passions and expressions are
once connected (which they soon will be) by the same as∣sociation,
which unites words with their ideas; the pas∣sion
will follow the expression, and attach upon the object
to which the child has been accustomed to apply the ex∣pression.
In a word, when almost every thing else is
learned by <HI>imitation,</HI> can we wonder to find the same cause
concerned in the generation of our moral sentiments!</P>
<P>Another considerable objection to the system of moral
instincts is this, that there are no maxims in the science,
which can well be deemed <HI>innate,</HI> as none perhaps can be
assigned, which are absolutely and universally <HI>true;</HI> in
<PB N="15" REF="53"/>
other words, which do not <HI>bend</HI> to circumstances. Vera∣city,
which seems, if any be, a natural duty, is excused
in many cases towards an enemy, a thief, a madman, or
a child; the obligation of promises, which is a first prin∣ciple
in morality, depends upon the circumstances under
which they were made—they may have been unlawful, or
become so since, or inconsistent with former promises, or
erroneous, or extorted; under all which cases, instances
may be put, where the obligation to perform the promise
would be dubious or discharged: and so of most other ge∣neral
rules, when they come to be actually applied.</P>
<P>There is an argument oil the same side of the question,
of this kind. Together with the instinct, there must have
been implanted also a clear and precise idea of the object
upon which it was to attach. The instinct and the idea of
the object are inseperable even in imagination, and as ne∣cessarily
accompany each other as any correlative ideas
whatever: that is, in plainer terms, if we be prompted
by nature to the approbation of particular actions, we must
have received also from nature a distinct conception of the
action we are thus prompted to approve; which we cer∣tainly
have not.</P>
<P>But as this argument bears alike against all instincts, and
in brutes as well as in men, it will hardly, I suppose, pro∣duce
convinction, though it may be difficult to find an an∣swer
to it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="54"/>
Upon the whole, it seems to me, either that there are
no such instincts as compose what is called the
moral sense, or that they are not now to be distinguished from prejudices
and habits; on which account they cannot be depended upon
in moral reasoning: I mean, that it is no safe way of ar∣guing,
to assume certain principles as so many dictates, im∣pulses,
and instincts of nature, and then draw conclusions
from these, as to the rectitude or wrongness of actions, in∣dependant
of the tendency of such actions, or any other
consideration whatever.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> lays it down, as a fundamental and self-evident
maxim, that nature intended barbarians to be slaves; and
proceeds to deduce from this maxim a train of conclusions,
calculated to justify the policy which then prevailed. And
I question whether the same maxim be not still self-evident
to the “company of merchants trading to the coast of Africa.”</P>
<P>Nothing is so soon made as a maxim; and it appears from
the example of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> that authority and convenience,
education, prejudice, and general practice, have a great
share in the making of them.</P>
<P>For which reason, I am apt to suspect, that a system of
morality, built upon instincts, will only find out reasons
and excuses for opinions and practices already established—will
seldom correct or reform them.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="55"/>
Besides, suppose we admit the existence of these instincts,
what is their authority?—No man, you say, can act in de∣liberate
opposition to them without a secret remorse of con∣science.—But
this remorse may be borne with—and if the
sinner chuse to bear with it, for the sake of the pleasure or
profit he expects from his wickedness; or finds the plea∣sure
of the sin exceed the remorse of conscience, of which
he alone is the judge, and when he feels them both toge∣ther
can hardly be mistaken, the moral-instinct-man, so
far as I can understand, has nothing more to say.</P>
<P>For, if he alledge, that these instincts are so many
indications of the will of God, and consequently pre∣sages
of what we are to look for hereafter, this, I an∣swer,
is to resort to a rule and a motive, ulterior to the in∣stincts
themselves, and at which rule and motive we shall
by and by arrive by a surer road—I say <HI>surer,</HI> so long as
there remains a controversy whether there be any instinc∣tive
maxims at all; or any difficulty in ascertaining what
maxims are instinctive.</P>
<P>This celebrated question therefore in our system becomes
a question of pure curiosity; and as such we dismiss it to
the determination of those who are more inquisitive, than
we are concerned to be, after the natural history and con∣stitution
of the human species.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Human Happiness.</HEAD>
<P>THE word <HI>happy</HI> is a relative term; that is, when we
call a man happy, we mean that he is happier than
some others, with whom we compare him; than the ge∣nerality
of others; or than he himself was in some other
situation: thus, speaking of one who has just compassed
the object of a long pursuit, now, we say, he is happy;
and in a like comparative sense, compared, that is, with the
general lot of mankind, we call a man happy who has health
and competency.</P>
<P>In strictness, any condition, in which the amount or
aggregate of pleasure exceeds that of pain, estimating both
pleasure and pain, by the intensity and continuance, may
be denominated happy: and the degree of happiness de∣pends
upon the quantity of this excess.</P>
<P>And the greatest quantity of it, ordinarily attainable in
human life, is what we mean by happiness, when we en∣quire
or pronounce what human happiness consists in.</P>
<P>In which enquiry I will omit the usual declamation upon
the dignity and capacity of our nature—the superiority of
<PB N="19" REF="57"/>
the soul to the body—of the rational to the animal part of
our constitution—the worthiness, refinement, and delicacy
of some satisfactions, or the meanness, grossness, and sensu∣ality
of others—because I hold, that pleasures differ in no∣thing
but in their continuance and intensity; from a just
computation of which, confirmed by what we observe of
the apparent chearfulness, tranquillity, and content, of
men of different tastes, tempers, stations, and pursuits,
every question concerning human happiness must receive
it's decision.</P>
<P>We will state,</P>
<P>I. What human Happiness does not consist in.</P>
<P>II. What it does consist in.</P>
<P>FIRST then, Happiness does not consist in the pleasures of
sense, in whatever profusion or variety they be possessed.—By
the pleasures of sense I mean, as well the animal gra∣tifications
of eating, drinking, and that by which the spe∣cies
is continued, as the more refined pleasures of music,
painting, architecture, gardening, splendid shews, theatric
exhibitions, and the pleasures, lastly, of active sports, as
hunting, shooting, fishing, &amp;c. For,</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> These pleasures continue but a little while at a
time. This is true of all of them, especially of the
grosser sort. Laying aside the preparation, and the ex∣pectation,
<PB N="20" REF="58"/>
and computing strictly the actual sensation, we
shall be surprised to find, how inconsiderable a portion of
our time they occupy, how few hours in the four and
twenty they are able to fill up, or enliven.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> These pleasures, by repetition, lose their relish. It
is a property of the machine, for which we know no re∣medy,
that the organs, by which we perceive pleasure,
are blunted and benumbed, by being frequently exercised
in the same way. There is hardly any one who has not
found the difference between a gratification, when new,
and when, familiar; or any pleasure which does not be∣come
indifferent, as it grows habitual.</P>
<P><HI>3dly,</HI> The eagerness for high and intense delights takes
away the relish from all others; and as such delights fall
rarely in our way, the greater part of our time must be
empty and uneasy.</P>
<P>There is hardly any delusion, by which men are greater
sufferers in their happiness, than by their expecting too much
from what is called pleasure; that is, from those intense de∣lights,
which vulgarly engross the name of pleasure. The
very expectation spoils them. When they do come, we
are often engaged in taking pains to persuade ourselves
how much we are pleased, rather than enjoying any plea∣sure,
which springs naturally out of the object. And
whenever we depend upon being vastly delighted, we
always go home secretly grieved at missing our aim. Like∣wise,
<PB N="21" REF="59"/>
as hath been observed just now, when this humour
of being prodigiously delighted, has once taken hold of
the imagination, it hinders us from providing for, or ac∣quiescing
in, those gently soothing engagements, the due
variety and succession of which, are the only things that
can supply any man with a continued stream of happiness.</P>
<P>What I have been able to observe of that part of man∣kind,
whose professed pursuit is pleasure, and who are
withheld in the pursuit, by no restraints of fortune, or
scruples of conscience, corresponds sufficiently with this
account. I have commonly remarked in such men, a
restless and inextinguishable passion for variety—a great
part of their time to be vacant, and so much of it irksome—and
that, with whatever eagerness and expectation they
set out, they become by degrees, fastidious in their choice
of pleasure, languid in the enjoyment, yet miserable un∣der
the want of it.</P>
<P>The truth is, there is a limit, at which these pleasures
soon arrive, and from which they ever afterwards decline.
They are in their nature of short duration, as the organs
cannot hold on their emotions beyond a certain length of
time; and if you endeavour to compensate for this, by the
frequency with which you repeat them, you lose more
than you gain, by the fatigue of the faculties, and the
diminution of sensibility.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="60"/>
We have said nothing in this account of the loss of op∣portunities,
or the decay of faculties, which, whenever
they happen, leave the voluptuary, destitute and desperate;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eazed by desires that can never be gratified, and the
memory of pleasures which must return no more.</P>
<P>It will also be allowed by those who have experienced
it, and perhaps by those alone, that pleasure which is
purchased by the incumbrance of our fortune, is pur∣chased
too dear; the pleasure never compensating for the
perpetual irritation of embarrassed circumstances.</P>
<P>These pleasures, after all, have their value: and, as the
young are always too eager in their pursuit of them, the
old are sometimes too remiss; that is, too studious of their
ease, to be at the pains for them, which they really de∣serve.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Neither does happiness consist in an exemp∣tion
from pain, labour, care, business, suspence, moles∣tation,
and “those evils which are without;” such a
state being attended not with ease, but with depression
of spirits, a tastelessness in all our ideas, imaginary anxie∣ties,
and the whole train of hypocondriacal affections.</P>
<P>For which reason it seldom answers their expectations,
to those, who retire from their shops and counting-houses,
to enjoy the remainder of their days in leisure and tran∣quillity;
much less to such, as in a fit of chagrin, shut
<PB N="23" REF="61"/>
themselves up in cloysters and hermitages, or quit the
world, and their stations in it, for solitude and repose.</P>
<P>Where there is a known external cause of uneasiness, the
cause may be removed, and the uneasiness will cease. But
those imaginary distresses which men feel for want of
real ones, (and which are equally tormenting, and so far
equally real) as they depend upon no single or assignable
subject of uneasiness, admit oftimes of no application or
relief.</P>
<P>Hence a moderate pain, upon which the attention may
fasten and spend itself, is to many a refreshment; as a
fit of the gout will sometimes cure the spleen. And the same
of any moderate agitation of the mind, as a literary con∣troversy,
a law suit, a contested election, and above all, gam∣ing;
the passion for which, in men of fortune and liberal
minds, is to be accounted for on this principle only.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Neither does happiness consist in greatness,
rank, or elevated station.</P>
<P>Were it true that all superiority afforded pleasure, it
would follow, that, by how much we were the greater, that
is, the more persons we were superior to, in the same pro∣portion,
so far as depended upon this cause, we should be
the happier; but so it is, that no superiority yields us any
satisfaction, save that which we possess of obtain over those
with whom we immediately compare ourselves. The shep∣herd
<PB N="24" REF="62"/>
perceives no pleasure in his superiority over his dog—the
farmer in his superiority over the shepherd—the lord
in his superiority over the farmer—nor the king, lastly, in
his superiority over the lord. Superiority, where there is no
competition, is seldom contemplated—what most men in∣deed
are quite unconscious of.</P>
<P>But if the same shepherd can run, fight, or wrestle bet∣ter
than the peasants of his village—if the farmer can show
better cattle, keeps a better horse, or is supposed to have a
longer purse than any farmer in the Hundred—if the lord
has more interest in an election, greater favour at court, a
better house, or larger estate, than any nobleman in the
county—if the king possesses a more extensive territory, a
more powerful fleet or army, a more splendid establishment,
or more loyal subjects, than any prince in Europe—in all
these cases the parties feel an actual satisfation in their su∣periority.</P>
<P>Now the conclusion that follows from hence is this—that
the pleasures of ambition, which are supposed to be
peculiar to high stations, are in reality common to all con∣ditions.
The farrier who shoes a horse better, and is in
greater request for his skill than any man within ten miles
of him, possesses, for all that I can see, the delight of dis∣tinction
and of excelling, as really and truly as the states∣man,
the soldier, and the scholar, who have filled Europe
with the reputation of their wisdom, their valour, or their
knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="63"/>
No superiority is of any account but superiority over a
rival. This it is manifest may exist wherever rivalships
do; and rivalships fall out amongst men of all ranks and
degrees. The object of emulation, the dignity or magni∣tude
of this object, makes no difference; as it is not what
either possesses that constitutes the pleasure, but what one
possesses more than the other.</P>
<P>Philosophy smiles at the contempt with which the rich
and great speak of the petty strifes and competitions of the
poor; not reflecting that these strifes and competitions are
just as reasonable as their own, and the pleasure, which
success affords, the same.</P>
<P>Our position is, that happiness does not consist in great∣ness.
And this position we make out by shewing, that
even what are supposed to be the peculiar advantages of
greatness, the pleasures of ambition and superiority, are in
reality common to all conditions. But whether the pur∣suit
of ambition contribute more to the happiness or mi∣sery
of the pursuers is a different question; and a question
concerning which I entertain great doubt. The pleasure of
success is exquisite; so also is the anxiety of the pursuit,
and the pain of disappointment—and what is the worst part
of the story, the pleasure is short lived. We soon cease to
look back upon those we have left behind; new contests
are engaged in, new prospects unfold themselves; a suc∣cession
of struggles is kept up, whilst there is a rival left
<PB N="26" REF="64"/>
within the compass of our views and profession; and when
there is none, the pleasure with the pursuit, is at an end.</P>
<P>We have seen what happiness does not consist in. We
are next to consider in what it does consist.</P>
<P>In the conduct of life, the great matter is, to know be∣fore
hand, what will please us, and what pleasures will hold
out. So far as we know this, our choice will be justified
by the event. And this knowledge is more scarce and dif∣ficult
than at first sight it may seem to be: for sometimes,
pleasures, which are wonderfully alluring and flattering in
the prospect, turn out in the possession extremely insipid;
or do not hold out as we expected: at other times pleasures
start up, which never entered into our calculation; and
which we might have missed of by not foreseeing: from
whence we have reason to believe, that we actually do miss
of many pleasures from the same cause. I say “know
before hand,” for after the experiment is tried, it is
commonly impracticable to retreat or change; besides that
shifting and changing is apt to generate a habit of restless∣ness,
which is destructive of the happiness of any con∣dition.</P>
<P>By reason of the original diversity of taste, capacity, and
constitution, observable in the human species, and the
still greater variety, which habit and fashion have intro∣duced
in these particulars, it is impossible to propose any
<PB N="27" REF="65"/>
plan of happiness, which will succeed to all, or any me∣thod
of life which is universally eligible or practicable.</P>
<P>All that can be said is, that there remains a presump∣tion
in favour of those conditions, in which men generally
appear most chearful and contented. For though the ap∣parent
happiness of mankind be not always a true measure
of their real happiness, it is the best measure we have.</P>
<P>Taking this for my guide, I am inclined to believe that
happiness consists,</P>
<P>I. In the exercise of the social affections.</P>
<P>Those persons commonly possess good spirits, who have
about them many objects of affection and endearment, as
wife, children, kindred, friends. And to the want of
these may be imputed the peevishness of monks, and of
such as lead the lives of monks.</P>
<P>Of the same nature with the indulgence of our do∣mestic
affections, and equally refreshing to the spirit, is
the pleasure which results from acts of bounty and bene∣ficence,
either in giving money, or imparting to those,
who want it, the assistance of our skill and profession.</P>
<P>Another main article of Human Happiness is,</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="66"/>
II. The exercise of our faculties, either of body or mind,
in the pursuit of some engaging end.</P>
<P>It seems to be true, that no plenitude of present grati∣fications
can make the possessor happy for a continuance,
unless he have something in reserve—something to hope
for, and look forward to. This I conclude to be the case,
from comparing the alacrity and spirits of men, who are
engaged in any pursuit which interests them, with the de∣jection
and <HI>ennui</HI> of almost all, who are either born to
so much that they want nothing more, or who have
<HI>used up</HI> their satisfactions too soon, and drained the sources
of them.</P>
<P>It is this intolerable vacuity of mind, which carries the
rich and great to the horse-course and the gaming table;
and often engages them in contests and pursuits, of which
the success bears no proportion to the solicitude and ex∣pence,
with which it is sought. An election for a dis∣puted
borough shall cost the parties twenty or thirty thou∣sand
pounds a piece, to say nothing of the anxiety, humi∣liation
and fatigue of the canvass; when a seat in the
House of Commons, of exactly the same value, may be had
for a tenth part of the money, and with no trouble.
I do not mention this to blame the rich and great, (per∣haps
they cannot do better) but in confirmation of what I
have advanced.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="67"/>
Hope, which thus appears to be of so much importance
to our happiness, is of two kinds—where there is some∣thing
to be done towards attaining the object of our
hope—and where there is nothing to be done. The first
alone is of any value; the latter being apt to corrupt into
impatience, having nothing in it's power but to sit still
and wait, which soon grows tiresome.</P>
<P>The doctrine delivered under this head may be readily
admitted; but how to provide ourselves with a succession
of pleasurable engagements, is the difficulty. This requires
two things—judgement in the choice of ends adapted to our
opportunities—and a command of imagination, so as to be
able, when the judgment has made choice of an end, to
transfer a pleasure to the <HI>means;</HI> after which the end may
be forgotten as soon as we well.</P>
<P>Hence those pleasures are most valuable, not which are
most exquisite in the fruition, but most productive of en∣gagement
and activity in the pursuit.</P>
<P>The more significant our engagements are, and the
better; such as planning laws, institutions, manufactures,
charities, improvements, public works, and endeavour∣ing,
by our interest, address, solicitations, and activity,
to carry them into effect: or, upon a smaller scale, pro∣curing
a maintenance and fortune for our families, by a
course of industry and application to our callings, which
forms, and gives motion to the common occupations of
<PB N="30" REF="68"/>
life—training up a child—prosecuting a scheme for his fu∣ture
establishment—making ourselves masters of a lan∣guage
or a science—improving or managing and estate—la∣bouring
after a piece of preferment: and lastly, any en∣gagement,
which is innocent, is better than none; as
writing a book—building a house—laying out a garden—digging
a fish-pond—-even raising a cucumber or a tulip.</P>
<P>A man, who believes the Christian religion, and is in
earnest in his endeavours after the happiness of a future
state, has, in this respect, an advantage, over all the
world. For he has constantly before his eyes an object of
supreme importance, productive of perpetual engagement
and activity, and of which the pursuit (which can be
said of no pursuit besides) lasts him to his life's end. Yet
even he, must have many ends, besides the <HI>far end:</HI> but then
they will conduct to that, be subordinate, and in some
way or other capable of being referred to that, and derive
their satisfaction, or an addition of satisfaction, from
that.</P>
<P>III. Happiness depends upon the prudent constitution of
the habits.</P>
<P>The art in which the secret of human happiness in a
great measure consists, is to <HI>set</HI> the habits; in such a man∣ner,
that every change may be a change for the better.
The habits themselves are much the same; for whatever
is made habitual, becomes smooth, and easy, and indiffe∣rent.
<PB N="31" REF="69"/>
The return to an old habit is likewise easy, what∣ever
the habit be.—Therefore, the advantage is with those
habits which allow of indulgence in the deviation from
them.—The luxurious receive no greater pleasure from
their dainties, than the peasant does from his bread and
cheese: but the peasant, whenever he goes abroad, finds
a feast; whereas the epicure must be well entertained to
escape disgust. Those who spend every day at cards, and
those who go to plow every day, pass their time much
alike; intent upon what they are about, wanting nothing,
regretting nothing, they are both in a state of ease: but
then, whatever suspends the occupation of the card-player,
distresses him; whereas to the labourer, every interrup∣tion
is a refreshment; and this appears in the different effect
that Sunday produces upon the two, which proves a day
of recreation to the one, but a lamentable burthen to the
other. The man who has learned to live alone, feels
his spirits enlivened whenever he enters into company,
and takes his leave without regret: another, who has
long been accustomed to a croud, or continual succession
of company, experiences in company no elevation of spi∣rits,
nor any greater satisfaction, than what the man of a
retired life finds in his solitary chimney corner. So far
their conditions are equal: but let a change of place,
fortune, or situation, separate the companion from his
circle, his visitors, his club, common-room, or coffee-house,
and the difference of advantage in the choice and
constitution of the two habits will shew itself.—Solitude
comes to the one clothed with melancholy; to the other
<PB N="32" REF="70"/>
it brings liberty and quiet.—You will see the one fretful
and restless, at a loss how to dispose of his time, till the
hour come round that he can forget himself in bed; the
other easy and satisfied, taking up his book, or his pipe,
as soon as he finds himself alone; ready to admit any little
amusement that casts up, or turn his hands and attention
to the first business that presents itself; or content with∣out
either to sit still, and let his trains of thought glide
indolently through his brain, without much use, perhaps,
or pleasure, but without <HI>hankering</HI> after any thing better,
and without irritation.—A reader, who has inured himself
to books of science and argumentation, if a novel, a well
written pamphlet, an article of news, a narrative of a curious
voyage or travels, fall in his way, sits down to the repast with
relish; enjoys his entertainment while it lasts, and can
return, when it is over, to his graver reading, without
distaste. Another, who lives upon sweet-meats, with
whom nothing will go down but works of humour and plea∣santry,
or whose curiosity must be interested by perpe∣tual
novelty, will consume a bookseller's window in half
a forenoon; during which time, he is rather in search of
diversion than diverted, and as books to his taste are few,
and short, and rapidly read over, the stock is soon ex∣hausted,
when he is left without resource from this prin∣cipal
supply of innocent amusement.</P>
<P>So far as circumstances of fortune conduce to happiness,
it is not the income which any man possesses, but the in∣crease
of income that affords the pleasure. Two persons,
<PB N="33" REF="71"/>
of whom one begins with an hundred, and advances his
income to a thousand, a year; and the other sets off with
a thousand, and dwindles down to an hundred, may,
in the course of their time, have the receipt and spending
of the same sum of money. Yet their satisfaction, so far
as fortune is concerned in it, will be very different. The
series and sum total of their incomes may be the same,
but it makes a wide difference which end they begin at.</P>
<P>IV. Happiness consists in Health.</P>
<P>By health I understand, as well freedom from bodily
distempers, as that tranquility, firmness, and alacrity of
mind, which we call good spirits; and which may pro∣perly
enough be included in our notion of health, as they
commonly depend upon the same causes, and yield to
the same management as our bodily constitution.</P>
<P>Health, in this sense, is the one thing needful. There∣fore
no pains, expence, self-denial, or restraint, which we
submit to for the sake of it, is too much. Whether it
require us to relinquish lucrative situations—abstain from
favourite indulgences—controul intemperate passions—or
undergo tedious regimens—whatever difficulties it lays
us under, a man, who pursues his happiness, rationally and
resolutely, will be content to submit to.</P>
<P>When we we are in perfect health and spirits, we feel
in ourselves a happiness independent of any particular
<PB N="34" REF="72"/>
outward gratification, whatever, and of which we can give
no account. This is an enjoyment which the Deity has
annexed to life; and probably constitutes, in a great mea∣sure,
the happiness of infants and brutes, especially of
the lower and sedentary orders of animals, as oysters, pe∣riwinkles,
and the like; for which I have sometimes been
at a loss to find out amusement.</P>
<P>The above account of human happiness will justify the
two following conclusions, which, though found in most
books of morality, have seldom been supported by any
sufficient reasons:</P>
<P>FIRST, that happiness is pretty equally distributed
amongst the different orders of civil society.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, that vice has no advantage over virtue
even with respect to this world's happiness.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="35" REF="73"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Virtue.</HEAD>
<P>VIRTUE is, “<HI>the doing good to mankind, in obedience
to the will of God, and for the sake of everlasting
happiness.</HI>”</P>
<P>According to which definition, “the good of mankind”
is the subject, the “will of God,” the rule, and “ever∣lasting
happiness,” the motive of human virtue.</P>
<P>Virtue has been divided by some, into <HI>benevolence, pru∣dence,
fortitude, and temperance. Benevolence</HI> proposes
good ends; <HI>prudence</HI> suggests the best means of attaining
them; <HI>fortitude</HI> enables us to encounter the difficulties,
dangers, and discouragements, that stand in our way in
the pursuit of these ends; temperance repels and over∣comes
the passions that obstruct it. <HI>Benevolence,</HI> for in∣stance,
prompts us to undertake the cause of an oppressed
orphan; <HI>prudence</HI> suggests the best means of going about
it; <HI>fortitude</HI> enables us to confront the danger, and bear
up against the loss, disgrace, or repulse, that may attend
our undertaking; and <HI>temperance</HI> keeps under the love of
money, of ease, or amusement, which might divert us
from it.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="74"/>
Virtue is distinguished by others into two branches only,
<HI>prudence</HI> and <HI>benevolence; prudence</HI> attentive to our own
interest; <HI>benevolence</HI> to that of our fellow creatures: both
directed to the same end, the increase of happiness in
nature; and taking equal concern in the future as in the
present.</P>
<P>The four cardinal virtues are <HI>prudence, fortitude, tempe∣rance,</HI>
and <HI>justice.</HI></P>
<P>But the division of Virtue, to which we are now-a-days
most accustomed, is into duties,</P>
<P>Towards <HI>God;</HI> as piety, reverence, resignation, grati∣tude,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>Towards <HI>other men;</HI> (or relative duties) as justice,
charity, fidelity, loyalty, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Towards <HI>ourselves;</HI> as chastity, sobriety, temperance,
preservation of life, care of health, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are more of these distinctions, which it is not
worth while to set down.</P>
<P>I shall proceed to state a few observations, which relate
to the general regulation of our conduct; unconnected
indeed with each other, but very worthy of attention;
<PB N="37" REF="75"/>
and which fall as properly under the title of this chap∣ter,
as of any other.</P>
<P>I. Mankind act more from habit than reflection.</P>
<P>It is on few only and great occasions, that men delibe∣rate
at all; on fewer still, that they institute any thing
like a regular enquiry into the moral rectitude or depravity
of what they are about to do; or wait for the result of it.—We
are for the most part determined, at once, and by an
impulse, which is the effect and energy of pre-established
habits. And this constitution seems well adapted to the
exigencies of human life, and the imbecillity of our moral
principle. In the current occasions, and rapid opportuni∣ties
of life, there is oftimes little leisure for reflection;
and were there more, a man, who has to reason about his
duty, when the temptation to transgress it is upon him, is
almost sure to reason himself into an error.</P>
<P>If we are in so great a degree passive under our habits,
where it is asked, is the exercise of Virtue, the guilt of
vice, or any use of moral and religious knowledge? I an∣swer,
in the <HI>forming and contracting</HI> of these habits.</P>
<P>And from hence results a rule of life of considerable im∣portance,
viz. that many things are to be done, and ab∣stained
from, solely for the sake of habit. We will ex∣plain
ourselves by an example or two. A beggar with
the appearance of extreme distress, asks our charity. If
<PB N="38" REF="76"/>
we come to argue the matter, whether the distress be real—whether
it be not brought upon himself—whether it be
of public advantage to admit such applications—whether
it be not to encourage idleness and vagrancy—whether it
may not invite impostors to our doors, though this
be none—whether the money can be well spared, or
might not be better applied—when these considerations
are put together, it may appear very doubtful, whether
we ought or ought not to give any thing. But when
we reflect, that the misery before our eyes excites our pity,
whether we will or not—that it is of the utmost conse∣quence
to us to cultivate this tenderness of mind—that it
is a quality, cherished by indulgence, and soon stifled by
opposition—when this I say is considered, a wise man will
do that for his own sake, which he would have hesitated to
do for the petitioner's—he will give way to his compas∣sion,
rather than offer violence to a habit of so much ge∣neral
use.</P>
<P>A man of confirmed good habits will act in the same
manner without considering at all.</P>
<P>This may serve for one instance. Another is the follow∣ing:
A man has been brought up from his infancy with a
dread of lying. An occasion presents itself, where at the ex∣pence
of a little veracity, he may divert his company, set off
his own wit with advantage, attract the notice and engage the
partiality of those about him. This is no small temptation.
And when he looks at the other side of the question, he
<PB N="39" REF="77"/>
sees no mischief that can ensue from this liberty—no
slander of any man's reputation—no prejudice likely to arise
to any man's interest. Were there nothing farther to be
considered, it would be hard to say, why a man under such
circumstances might not indulge his humour. But when
he reflects that his scruples about lying have hitherto pre∣served
him free from this vice—that occasions like the
present will return, where the inducement may be equally
strong, but the indulgence much less innocent—that his
scruples will wear away by a few transgressions, and leave
him subject to one of the meanest and most pernicious of
all bad habits, a habit of lying whenever it will serve his
turn.—When all this, I say, is considered, a wise man
will forego the present, or a much greater pleasure, rather
than lay the foundation of a character so vicious and con∣temptible.</P>
<P>From what has been said may be explained also the nature
of habitual virtue. By the definition of Virtue, at the begin∣ning
of this chapter, it appears, that the good of mankind
is the subject, the will of God the rule, and everlasting hap∣piness
the motive and end of all virtue. Yet a man shall
perform many an act of virtue, without having either the
good of mankind, the will of God, or everlasting happi∣ness,
in his thoughts; just as a man may be a very good ser∣vant,
without being conscious, at every turn, of a regard
to his master's will, or attention to his interest; (and your
best old servants are of this sort) but then he must have
served for a length of time under the actual direction of
<PB N="40" REF="78"/>
these motives to bring it to this—in which service his me∣rit
and virtue consist.</P>
<P>There are <HI>habits,</HI> not only of drinking, swearing, and
lying, and of some other things, which are commonly
acknowledged to be habits, and called so; but of every
modification of action, speech, and thought. Man is a
bundle of habits. There are habits of industry, attention,
vigilance, advertency; of a prompt obedience to the
judgment occurring, or yielding to the first impulse of
passion; of extending our views to the future, or resting
upon the present; of apprehending, methodizing, rea∣soning;
of indolence and dilatoriness; of vanity, self-conceit,
melancholy, partiality; of fretfulness, suspicion,
captiousness, censoriousness; of pride, ambition, covet∣ousness;
of over-reaching, intriguing, projecting. In a
word, there is not a quality or function, either of body
or mind, which does not feel the influence of this great
law of animated nature.</P>
<P>II. The Christian religion has not ascertained the pre∣cise
quantity of virtue necessary to salvation.</P>
<P>This has been made an objection to Christianity; but
without reason. For, as all revelation, however imparted
originally, must be transmitted by the ordinary vehicle of
language, it behoves those, who make the objection, to
shew, that any form of words could be devised, which
might express this quantity; or that it is possible to con∣stitute
<PB N="41" REF="79"/>
a standard of moral attainments, accommodated to
the almost infinite diversity which subsists in the capacities
and opportunities of different men.</P>
<P>It seems most agreeable to our conceptions of justice,
and consonant enough to the language of scripture,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully,” 2 Cor. ix. 6.—“And that servant, which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes; but he that knew not shall be beaten with few stripes.” Luke xii. 47, 48.—“Who∣soever shall give you a cup of water to drink, in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward,” to wit, intimating that there is in reserve a proportionable reward, for even the smallest act of Virtue. Mark ix. 41.—See also the parable of the pounds, Luke xix, 16, &amp;c. where he, whose pound had gained ten pounds, was placed over ten cities; and he, whose pound had gained five pounds, was placed over five cities.</NOTE> to
suppose, that there are prepared for us rewards and punish∣ments,
of all possible degrees, from the most exalted hap∣piness
down to extreme misery; so that “our labour is
never in vain;” whatever advancement we make in virtue,
we procure a proportionable accession of future happiness;
as, on the other hand, every accumulation of vice, is the
“treasuring up of so much wrath against the day of wrath.”
It can never be a just oeconomy of providence, it is said,
to admit one part of mankind into heaven, and condemn
the other to hell, when there may be very little to chuse,
between the worst man who is received into heaven,
and the best who is excluded. And how know we
<PB N="42" REF="80"/>
but that there may be as little to chuse in their condi∣tions?</P>
<P>Without entering into a detail of scripture morality,
which would anticipate our subject, the following general
positions may be advanced, I thank, with safety:</P>
<P>1. That a state of happiness is not to be expected by
those, who are conscious of no moral or religious rule. I
mean those who cannot with truth say, that they have
been prompted to one action, or with held from one gratifi∣cation,
by any regard to virtue or religion, either imme∣diate
or habitual.</P>
<P>There needs no other proof of this, than the conside∣ration,
that a brute would be as proper an object of re∣ward
as such a man; and that, if this were the case, the
penal sanctions of religion could have no place—for whom
would you punish, if you make such a one as this hap∣py?—or
rather indeed religion itself, both natural and re∣vealed,
would cease to have any use or authority.</P>
<P>2. That a state of happiness is not to be expected by
those, who reserve to themselves the habitual practice of
any one sin, or neglect of one known duty.</P>
<P>Because, no obedience can proceed upon proper motives
which is not universal, that is, which is not directed to
<PB N="43" REF="81"/>
every command of God alike, as they all stand upon the
same authority.</P>
<P>Because, such an allowance would in effect amount to a toleration of every vice in the world.</P>
<P>And because, the strain of scripture language excludes any
such hope. When our <HI>duties</HI> are recited, they are put <HI>col∣lectively,</HI>
that is, as all and every of them required in the
Christian character. “<HI>Add</HI> to your faith Virtue; and to
Virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and
to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and
to godliness brotherly kind∣ness; and
to brotherly kind∣ness
charity.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> On the other hand, when <HI>vices</HI> are enumerated, they are put <HI>disjunctively,</HI> that is, as sepa∣rately
and severally excluding the sinner from heaven. “<HI>Neither</HI> fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor
effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers,
nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.”<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Those texts of scripture, which seem to lean a contrary way, as that “charity shall cover the multitude of sins,”<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iv. 8.</NOTE>
“that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall hide a multitude of sins,”<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">James v. 20.</NOTE> cannot, I think,
for the reasons abovementioned, be extended to sins deli∣berately
and obstinately persisted in.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="82"/>
3. That a state of mere unprofitableness will not go unpunished.</P>
<P>This is expressly laid down by Christ in the parable of the
talents, which supersedes all farther reasoning about the matter. “Then he which had received one talent, came
and said, Lord I know thee that thou art an austere
man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering
where thou hast not strawed; and I was afraid, and
hid thy talent in the earth; lo, there thou hast that is
thine. His lord answered and said unto him, thou
wicked and <HI>slothful</HI> servant, thou knewest, (or knewest
thou?) that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where
I have not strawed; thou oughtest therefore to have put
my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I
should have received mine own with usury. Take there∣fore
the talent from him, and give it unto him which
hath ten talents; for unto every one that hath shall be
given, and he shall have abundance; but from him that
hath not, shall be taken away even that which he hath;
<HI>and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness, there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</HI>”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxv. 24, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>III. In every question of conduct where one side is doubt∣ful,
and the other side safe, we are bound to take the safe side.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="83"/>
This is best explained by an instance, and I know of
none more to our purpose, than that of suicide. Suppose,
for example's sake, that it appear doubtful to a reasoner
upon the subject, whether he may lawfully destroy him∣self.
He can have no doubt, but that it is lawful for him
to let it alone. Here therefore is a case, in which one side is doubtful, and the other side safe. By Virtue therefore
of our rule, he is bound to pursue the safe side, that is, to forbear from offering violence to himself, whilst a
doubt remains upon his mind about the lawfulness of
it.</P>
<P>It is <HI>prudent,</HI> you allow, to take the safe side. But our
observation means something more than that. We assert
that the action, concerning which we doubt, whatever
it may be in itself, or to another, would, in <HI>us,</HI> whilst
this doubt remains upon our minds, be sinful. The case
is expressly so adjudged by St. Paul, with whose authority we will for the present rest contented. “I know and am
persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing un∣clean
of itself, but <HI>to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean.</HI>—Happy is
he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he
alloweth; and he that doubteth is damned (<HI>condemned</HI>)
if he eat, for whatsoever is not of faith (i. e. not done
with a full persuasion of the lawfulness of it) is sin.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans XIV. 14. 22, 23.</NOTE></P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="book">
<HEAD>BOOK II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MORAL OBLIGATION.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Question, Why am I obliged to keep my Word? considered.</HEAD>
<P>WHY am I <HI>obliged</HI> to keep my word?</P>
<P>Because it is right, says one.—Because it is agreeable to the fitness of things, says another.—Because it is con∣formable
to reason and nature, says a third.—Because it is conformable to truth, says a fourth.—Because it promotes the public good, says a fifth.—Because it is required by the
will of God, concludes a sixth.</P>
<P>Upon which different accounts, two things are observ∣able:</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="85"/>
FIRST, that they all ultimately coincide.</P>
<P>The fitness of things, means their fitness to produce happiness; the nature of things means that actual consti∣tution
of the world, by which some things, as such and
such actions, for example, produce happiness, and others
misery; reason is the principle by which we discover
or judge of this constitution; truth is this judgment
expressed or drawn out into propositions. So that it ne∣cessarily
comes to pass, that what promotes the public
happiness, or happiness upon the whole, is agreeable to
the fitness of things, to nature, to reason, and to truth;
and such (as will appear by and by) is the divine character,
that what promotes the general happiness is required by the
will of God; and what has all the above properties must
needs be <HI>right,</HI> for right means no more than conformity
to the rule we go by, whatever that rule be.</P>
<P>And this is the reason, that moralists, from whatever
different principles they set out, commonly meet in their
conclusions; that is, they enjoin the same conduct, pre∣scribe
the same rules of duty, and with a few exceptions,
deliver upon dubious cases the same determinations.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, it is to be observed that these answers all leave the the matter short; for the enquirer may turn
round upon his teacher with a second question, in which
he will expect to be satisfied, namely, <HI>why</HI> am I obliged
to do what is right; to act agreeably to the fitness of things;
<PB N="49" REF="86"/>
to conform to reason, nature, or truth; to promote the
public good, or obey the will of God?</P>
<P>The proper method of conducting the enquiry, is to
see, FIRST, what we mean, when we say a man is <HI>obliged</HI> to do a thing, and THEN to shew <HI>why</HI> he is obliged to
do it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What we meant when we say, a Man is obliged to do a Thing.</HEAD>
<P>A Man is said to be <HI>obliged,</HI> “when be is urged by a <HI>violent motive resulting from the command of another.”</HI></P>
<P>I. “The motive must be violent.” If a person, who has
done me some little service, or has a small place in his dis∣posal,
ask me for my vote upon some occasion, I may possibly give it him, from a motive of gratitude or expectation;
but I should hardly say, that I was <HI>obliged</HI> to give it him,
because the inducement does not rise high enough. Whereas,
if a father or a master, any great benefactor, or one on whom my fortune depends, require my vote, I give it him of
course; and my answer to all who ask me why I voted so
<PB N="50" REF="87"/>
and so, is, that my father or my master <HI>obliged</HI> me; that
I had received so many favours from, or had so great a dependence upon such a one, that I was <HI>obliged</HI> to vote as
he directed me.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, “It must result from the command of another.” Offer a man a gratuity for doing any thing,
for seizing, for example, an offender, he is not <HI>obliged</HI> by
your offer, to do it; nor would he say he is; though he
may be <HI>induced, persuaded, prevailed upon, tempted</HI>—If a
magistrate, or the man's immediate superior command it,
he considers himself as <HI>obliged</HI> to comply, though possibly
he would lose less by a refusal in this case, than in the former.</P>
<P>I will not undertake to say, that the words <HI>obligation</HI>
and <HI>obliged</HI> are used uniformly in this sense, or always
with this distinction; nor is it possible to tie down popu∣lar
phrases to any constant signification; but, wherever
the motive is violent enough, and coupled with the idea
of command, authority, law, or the will of a superior,
there, I take it, we always reckon ourselves to be <HI>obliged.</HI></P>
<P>And from this account of obligation it follows, that we
can be obliged to nothing, but what we ourselves are to
gain or lose something by; for nothing else can be a vio∣lent
motive to us. As we should not be obliged to obey
the laws, or the magistrate, unless rewards or punishments,
<PB N="51" REF="88"/>
pleasure or pain, some how or other depended upon our obedience; neither could we, without the same reason,
be obliged to practise virtue, obey the commands of God,
do what is right, or to any thing else.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The question, Why I am obliged to keep my Word? resumed.</HEAD>
<P>LET it be remembered, that to be <HI>obliged,</HI> “is to be
urged by a violent motive, resulting from the com∣mand
of another.”</P>
<P>And then let it be asked, Why am I obliged to keep my
word? and the answer will be, because I am “urged to do so
by a violent motive,” (namely the expectation of being
after this life rewarded, if I do, or punished for it, if I
do not) “resulting from the command of another,” (name∣ly
God).</P>
<P>This solution goes to the bottom of the subject, as no farther question can reasonably be asked.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="89"/>
Therefore private happiness is our motive, and the will
of God our rule.</P>
<P>When I first turned my thoughts to moral speculations,
an air of mystery seemed to hang over the whole subject; which arose, I believe, from this—that I supposed, that to be <HI>obliged</HI> to do any thing, was very different from being <HI>induced</HI> only to do it; and that the obligation to practise virtue, to do what is right, just, &amp;c. was quite another thing, and of another kind, than the obligation,
which a soldier is under to obey his officer, a servant his master, or any of the civil and ordinary obligations of
human life. Whereas, from what has been said, it ap∣pears,
that moral obligation is like all other obligations;
and that all <HI>obligation</HI> is nothing more than an <HI>inducement</HI>
of sufficient strength, and resulting, in some way, from the command of another.</P>
<P>There is always understood to be a difference between
an act of <HI>prudence</HI> and an act of <HI>duty.</HI> Thus, if I distrusted
a man, who owed me money, I should reckon it an act
of prudence to get another bound with him; but I should
hardly call it an act of duty. On the other hand, it would
be thought a very unusual and loose kind of language, to
say, that, as I had made such a promise, it was <HI>prudent</HI>
to perform it; or that as my friend, when he went abroad,
placed a box of jewels in my hands, it would be <HI>prudent</HI>
in me to preserve it for him till he returned.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="90"/>
Now, in what, you will ask, does the difference consist? Inasmuch as according to our account of the matter, both
in the one case and the other, in acts of duty as well as
acts of prudence, we consider solely what we shall get or lose by the act?</P>
<P>The difference, and the only difference, is this; that,
in the one case, we consider what we shall get or lose in this world; in the other case, we consider also what we shall get or lose in the world to come.</P>
<P>Those who would establish a system of morality, inde∣pendent
of a future state, must look out for some different
idea of moral obligation; unless they can shew that virtue conducts the possessor to certain happiness in this world,
or to a much greater share of it, than he could attain by
a different behaviour.</P>
<P>To us there are two great questions:</P>
<P>I. Will there be after this life, any distribution, of re∣wards
and punishments at all?</P>
<P>II. If there be, what actions will be rewarded and what
will be punished?</P>
<P>The first question comprises the credibility of the Chris∣tian
religion, together with the presumptive proofs of a
future retribution, from the light of nature. The second
<PB N="54" REF="91"/>
question is the province of morality. Both questions are
too much for one work. The affirmative therefore of the
first, although we confess that it is the foundation,
upon which the whole fabric rests, must in this treatise be taken
for granted.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Will of God.</HEAD>
<P>AS the will of God is our rule, to enquire what is our
duty, or what we are obliged to do, in any instance,
is, in effect, to enquire, what is the will of God in that instance? which consequently becomes the whole business of morality.</P>
<P>Now there are two methods of coming at the will
of God, on any point:</P>
<P>I. By his express declarations, when they are to be had;
and which must be sought for in Scripture.</P>
<P>II. By what we can discover of his designs and disposition
from his works, or, as we usually call it, the light of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="92"/>
And here we may observe the absurdity of separating natural and revealed religion from each other. The ob∣ject
of both is the same—to discover the will of God—and
provided we do but discover it, it matters nothing by
what means.</P>
<P>An ambassador, judging only from what he knows of
his sovereign's disposition, and arguing from what he has
observed of his conduct, or is acquainted with of his
designs, may take his measures in many cases with safety;
and presume, with great probability, how his master would
have him act on most occasions that arise: but if he have
his commission and instructions in his pocket, it would be
strange never to look into them. He will naturally con∣duct
himself by both rules: when his instructions are clear
and positive, there is an end of all farther deliberation (un∣less
indeed he suspect their authenticity): where his in∣structions
are silent or dubious, he will endeavour to sup∣ply
or explain them, by what he has been able to collect
from other quarters of his master's general inclination or intentions.</P>
<P>Mr. HUME, in his fourth Appendix to his Principles
of Morals, has been pleased to complain of the modern
scheme of uniting Ethics with the Christian Theology. Those, who find themselves disposed to join in this com∣plaint,
will do well to observe what Mr. HUME himself
has been able to make of morality without this union.
<PB N="56" REF="93"/>
And for that purpose, let them read the second part of the ninth section of the above essay; which part contains the practical application of the whole treatise—a treatise, which
Mr. HUME declares to be "incomparably the best he “ever wrote.” When they have read it over, let them consider, whether any motives there proposed are likely to
be found sufficient, to withhold men from the gratification
of lust, revenge, envy, ambition, avarice, or prevent the existence of these passions. Unless they rise up from this
celebrated essay, with very different impressions upon their
minds, than it ever lest upon mine, they will acknowledge
the necessity of additional sanctions. But the necessity of
these sanctions is not now the question. If they be <HI>in fact established,</HI> if the rewards and punishments held forth
in the gospel will actually come to pass, they <HI>must</HI> be con∣sidered.
Those, who reject the Christian religion, are to
make the best shift they can, to build up a system, and lay the foundations of morality, without it. But it ap∣pears
to me a great inconsistency, in those, who receive Christianity, and expect something to come of it, to endea∣vour
to keep all such expectations out of sight, in their reasonings concerning human duty.</P>
<P>The method of coming at the will of God, concerning
any action, by the light of nature, is to enquire into the ten∣dency
of the action to promote or diminish the general
happiness. And this rule proceeds upon the presumption,
that God Almighty wills and wishes the happiness of his
<PB N="57" REF="94"/>
creatures; and consequently, that those actions, which promote that will and wish, must be agreeable to him;
and the contrary.</P>
<P>But, as this presumption is the foundation of the whole system, it becomes necessary to explain the reasons upon
which it rests.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Divine Benevolence.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN God created the human species, he either
wished their happiness, or he wished their misery,
or he was indifferent and unconcerned about both.</P>
<P>If he had wished our misery, he might have made sure of his purpose, by forming our senses to be as many sores and
pains to us, as they are now instruments of gratification
and enjoyment; or by placing us amidst objects, so ill suited
to our perceptions, as to have continually offended us, in∣stead
of ministring to our refreshment and delight. He
might have made, for example, every thing we tasted bi∣tter;
every thing we saw, loathsome; ever thing we touched,
a sting; every smell, a stench; and every sound, a dis∣cord.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="95"/>
If he had been indifferent about our happiness or misery, we must impute to our good fortune (as all design by this supposition is excluded) both the capacity of our senses to
receive pleasure, and the supply of external objects fitted to excite it.</P>
<P>But either of these, and still more both of them, being too much to be attributed to accident, nothing remains
but the first supposition, that God, when he created the human species, wished their happiness; and made for them the provision he has made, with that view, and for that purpose.</P>
<P>The same argument may be proposed in different terms, thus: Contrivance proves design; and the predominant
tendency of the contrivances indicates the disposition of
the designer. The world abounds with contrivances; and
all the contrivances, that we are acquainted with, are di∣rected
to beneficial purposes. Evil no doubt exists; but it
is never, that we can perceive, the object of contrivance.
Teeth are contrived to eat, not to ache; their aching now
and then is incidental to the contrivance, perhaps insepa∣rable
from it; or even, if you will, let it be called a defect
in the contrivance; but it is not the object of it. In de∣scribing
implements of husbandry, you would hardly say
of a sickle, this is to cut the reapers fingers, though from the construction of the instrument, and the manner of
using it, this mischief often happens. But if you had occasion to describe instruments of torture or execution,
<PB N="59" REF="96"/>
this, you would say, is to extend the sinews; this to dis∣locate
the joints; this to break the bones; this to scorch
the soles of the feet. Here pain and misery are the objects of the contrivance. Now nothing of this sort is to be
found in the works of nature: we never discover a train of contrivance to bring about an evil purpose. No anatomist
ever discovered a system of organization, calculated to
produce pain and disease; or, in explaining the parts of the
human body, ever said, this is to irritate; this to inflame;
this duct is to convey the gravel to the kidneys; this gland
to secrete the humour which forms the gout: if by chance
he come at a part of which he knows not the use, the
most he can say is, that it is useless; no one ever suspects
that it is put there to incommode, to annoy, or torment.
Since then God hath called forth his consummate wisdom,
to contrive and provide for our happiness, and the world
appears to have been constituted with this design at first,
so long as this constitution is upheld by him, we must in
reason suppose the same design to continue.</P>
<P>The contemplation of universal nature, rather bewil∣ders
the mind than affects it. There is always a bright
spot in the prospect, upon which the eye rests, a single
example perhaps, by which each man finds himself more
<HI>convinced</HI> than by all others put together. I seem, for my
own part, to see the benevolence of the Deity more clearly
in the pleasures of very young children, than in any thing
in the world. The pleasures of grown persons may be
reckoned partly of their own procuring; especially if there
<PB N="60" REF="97"/>
has been any industry, or contrivance, or pursuit, to come
at them; or if they are founded, like music, painting, &amp;c.
upon any qualification of their own acquiring. But the pleasures of a healthy infant are so manifestly provided for
it by <HI>another;</HI> and the benevolence of the provision is so
unquestionable, that every child I see at it's sport, affords
to my mind a kind of sensible evidence of the finger of God, and of the disposition which directs it.</P>
<P>But the example, which strikes each man most strongly, is the true example for him; and hardly two minds hit
upon the same; which shews the abundance of such ex∣amples
about us.</P>
<P>We conclude therefore, that God wills and wishes the happiness of his creatures. And this conclusion being
once established, we are at liberty to go on with the rule built upon it, namely, “that the method of coming at
the will of God, concerning any action, by the light of
nature, is, to enquire into the tendency of that action
to promote or diminish the general happiness.”</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Utility.</HEAD>
<P>SO then actions are to be estimated by their tendency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Actions in the abstract are right or wrong, according to their <HI>tendency;</HI> the agent is virtuous or vicious, according to his <HI>design.</HI> Thus, if the question be, Whether relieving common beggars be right or wrong? we enquire into the <HI>tendency</HI> of such a conduct to the public advantage or in∣convenience. If the question be, Whether a man, remarkable for this sort of bounty, is to be esteemed virtuous for that reason? we enquire into his <HI>design,</HI> whether his liberality sprung from charity or from ostentation. It is evident that our concern is with actions in the abstract.</NOTE>
to promote happiness.—Whatever is expedient, is
right.—It is the utility of any moral rule alone which constitutes the obligation of it.</P>
<P>But to all this there seems a plain objection, viz. that many actions are useful, which no one in his wits will
allow to be right. There are occasions, in which the
hand of the assassin would be very useful. The present
possessor of some great estate employs his influence and
fortune, to annoy, corrupt, or oppress all about him.
His estate would devolve by his death, to a successor of an
opposite character. It is useful, therefore, to dispatch
<PB N="62" REF="99"/>
such a one, as soon as possible, out of the way, as the neighbourhood would exchange thereby a pernicious tyrant
for a wise and generous benefactor. It may be use∣ful
to rob a miser, and give the money to the poor; as
the money no doubt would produce more happiness, by
being laid out in food and cloathing for half a dozen dis∣tressed
families, than by continuing locked up in the miser's
chest. It may be useful to get possession of a
place, a piece of preferment, or of a seat in parliament, by bribery
or false swearing; as by means of them we may serve
the public more effectually than in our private station.
What then shall we say? Must we admit these actions to
be right, which would be to justify assassination, plunder,
and perjury, or must we give up our principle, that the criterion of right is utility?</P>
<P>The answer is this; that these actions after all, are not useful, and for that reason, and that alone, are not right.</P>
<P>But to see this point perfectly, it must be observed, that
the bad consequences of actions are two-sold, <HI>particular</HI>
and <HI>general.</HI></P>
<P>The particular bad consequence of an action, is the mischief which that single action directly and immediately occasions.</P>
<P>The general bad consequence is the violation of some necessary or useful <HI>general rule.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="100"/>
Thus the particular bad consequence of the assassination
above described, is the fright and pain which the deceased underwent—the loss he suffered of life, which is as valuable
to a bad man, as to a good one, or more so—the pre∣judice
and affliction, of which his death was the occasion,
to his family, friends, and dependents.</P>
<P>The general bad consequence is the violation of this ne∣cessary
general rule, that no man be put to death for his
crimes, but by public authority.</P>
<P>Although therefore such an action have no particular
bad consequence, or greater particular good consequences,
yet it is not useful, by reason of the general consequence, which is evil, and of more importance. And the same
of the other two instances, and of a million more, which
might be mentioned.</P>
<P>But as this solution supposes, that the moral govern∣ment
of the world must proceed by general rules, it re∣mains
that we shew the necessity of this.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Necessity of General Rules.</HEAD>
<P>YOU cannot permit one action and forbid another,
without shewing a difference betwixt them. There∣fore
the same sort of actions must be generally permitted
or generally forbidden. Where, therefore, the general per∣mission
of them would be pernicious, it becomes necessary
so lay down and support the rule which generally for∣bids
them.</P>
<P>Thus, to return once more to the case of the assassin.
The assassin knocked the rich villain on the head, because
he thought him better out of the way than in it. If you
allow this excuse in the present instance, you must allow it to all, who act in the same manner, and from the
same motive; that is, you must allow every man to kill
any one he meets, whom he thinks noxious or useless;
which, in the event, would be to commit every man's
life and safety to the spleen, fury, and fanaticism of his
neighbour—a disposition of affairs which would presently
fill the world with misery and confusion; and ere long
put an end to human society, if not to the human spe∣cies.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="102"/>
The necessity of general rules in human governments
is apparent: but whether the same necessity subsist in the
divine oeconomy, in that distribution of rewards and pu∣nishments,
to which a moralist looks forward, may be
doubted.</P>
<P>I answer, that general rules are necessary to every mo∣ral
government; and by moral government I mean any
dispensation, whose object is to influence the conduct of reasonable creatures. For if, of two actions perfectly similar,
one be punished, and another rewarded or forgiven,
which would be the consequence of rejecting general rules,
the subjects of such a dispensation would no longer know,
either what to expect or how to act—rewards and punishments
would cease to be such would become accidents,
like the stroke of a thunderbolt, or the discovery of a mine—like a blank or a benefit ticket in a lottery, they would occasion pain or pleasure when they happened; but follow∣ing
in no known order, from any particular course of
action, they could have no previous influence or effect
upon the conduct.</P>
<P>An attention to general rules, therefore, is included in
the very idea of reward and punishment. Consequently
whatever reason there is to expect future reward and pu∣nishment
at the hand of God, there is the same reason to
believe, that he will proceed in the distribution of it by general rules.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="103"/>
As the general consequence of an action, upon which
so much of the guilt of a bad action depends, consists in the
example; it should seem, that, if the action be done with perfect secrecy, so as to furnish no bad example, that part of the guilt drops off. In the case of suicide, for instance,
if a man can so manage matters, as to take away his own
life, without being known or suspected to have done it,
he is not chargeable with any mischief from the example;
nor does his punishment seem necessary, in order to save.
the authority of any general rule.</P>
<P>In the first place, those who reason in this manner,
do not observe, that they are setting up a general rule, of all others the least to be endured; namely, that secrecy, whenever secrecy is practicable, will justify any action.</P>
<P>Was such a rule admitted, for instance, in the case above
produced, is there not reason to fear that people would,
be <HI>disappearing</HI> perpetually?</P>
<P>In the next place, I would wish them to be well satis∣fied
about the points proposed in the following queries:</P>
<P>1. Whether the scriptures do not teach us to expect,
that, at the general judgment of the world, the most se∣cret
actions will be brought to light?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, Rom. xi, 16—Judge nothing before the time untill the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the councils of the heart. 1 Cor. iv. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="104"/>
2. For what purpose can this be, but to make them the objects of reward and punishment?</P>
<P>3. Whether, being so brought to light, they will not
fall under the operation of those equal and impartial rules,
by which God will deal with his creatures?</P>
<P>They will then become examples, whatever they be
now; and require the same treatment from the judge and
governor of the moral world, as if they had been detected
from the first.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Consideration of general Consequences pursued.</HEAD>
<P>THE general consequence of any action may be estimated,
by asking what would be the consequence,
if the same sort of actions were generally permitted.—But
suppose they were, and a thousand such actions per∣petrated
under this permission; is it just to charge a single
action with the collected guilt and mischief of the whole
thousand? I answer, that the reason for prohibiting and
punishing an action (and this reason may be called the
guilt of the action, if you please) will always be in pro∣portion
to the whole mischief that would arise from the
general impunity and toleration of actions, of the same sort.</P>
<P>“Whatever is expedient is right.” But then it must;
be expedient, upon the whole—at the long run—in all it's
effects, collateral., and remote, as well as in those which are
immediate and direct; as it is obvious, that, in compu∣ting
consequences, it makes no difference in what way or
at what distance they, ensue.</P>
<P>To impress this doctrine upon the minds of young
readers, and to teach them to extend their views beyond
the immediate mischief of a crime, I shall here subjoin
<PB N="69" REF="106"/>
a string of instances, where the particular consequence is comparatively insignificant; and where the malignity of
the crime, and the severity with which human laws pursue
it, is almost entirely on account of the general consequence.</P>
<P>The particular consequence of coining, is the loss of a guinea, or of half a guinea, to the person who receives
the counterfeit money; the general consequence (by which
I mean the consequence that, would, ensue, if the same practice were generally permitted) is to abolish the use of money.</P>
<P>The particular consequence of forgery, is a damage of
twenty or thirty pounds, to the man who accepts the forged
bill; the general consequence is, the stoppage of paper currency.</P>
<P>The particular consequence of sheep-stealing, or horse∣stealing,
is a loss to the owner, to the amount of the value
of the sheep or horse stolen; the general consequence is,
that the land could not be occupied, nor the market sup∣plied
with this kind of stock.</P>
<P>The particular consequence of breaking into a house
empty of inhabitants; is the loss of a pair of silver candle∣sticks,
or a few spoons; the general consequence is, that
nobody could leave their house empty.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="107"/>
The particular consequence of smuggling, may be a de∣duction
from the national fund too minute for computa∣tion:
the general consequence is the destruction of one en∣tire
branch of public revenue a proportionable increase
of the burthen upon other branches; and the ruin of all
fair and open trade in the article smuggled.</P>
<P>The particular consequence of an officer's breaking his
parole, is the loss of a prisoner, who was possibly not
worth keeping; the general consequence is, that this mi∣tigation
of captivity would be refused to all others.</P>
<P>And what proves incontestibly the superior importance
of general consequences is, that crimes are the same, and treated in the same manner, though the particular conse∣quence
be very different. The crime and fate of the
house-breaker is the fame, whether his booty be five pounds
or fifty. And the reason is, that the general consequence
is the same.</P>
<P>The want of this distinction between particular and
general consequences, or rather the not sufficiently attend∣ing
to the latter, is the cause of that perplexity we meet
with in the ancient moralists. On the one hand, they
were sensible of the absurdity of pronouncing actions
good or evil, without regard to the good or evil they pro∣duced.
On the other hand, they were startled with the con∣clusions
to which a steady adherence to consequences see∣med
sometimes to conduct them. To relieve this difficulty,
<PB N="71" REF="108"/>
they contrived the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the <HI>honestum,</HI> by which
terms they meant to constitute a measure of right, distinct
from utility. Whilst the <HI>utile</HI> served them, that is, whilst
it corresponded with their habitual notions of the rectitude
of actions, they went by <HI>it.</HI> When they fell in with such
cases as those mentioned in the sixth chapter, they took
leave of their guide, and resorted to the <HI>honestum.</HI> The
only account they could give of the matter was, that these
actions might be useful; but because they were not at the
same time <HI>honesta,</HI> they were by no means to be deemed just or right.</P>
<P>From the principles delivered in this and the two pre∣ceding
chapters, a maxim may be explained, which is in
every man's mouth, and in most men's without meaning,
viz. “not to do evil, that good may come:” that is, let
us not violate a general, rule, for the sake of any particular good consequence we may expect. Which is for the most
part a salutary caution, the advantage seldom compensating
for the violation of the rule. Strictly speaking, that can∣not
be “evil,” from which “good comes;” but in this
way, and with a view to the distinction between particular
and general consequences, it may.</P>
<P>We will conclude this subject of <HI>consequences</HI> with the
following reflection. A man may fancy, that any action
of his, with respect to the public, must be inconsiderable; so also is the agent. If his crime produce but a small
<PB N="72" REF="109"/>
effect upon the universal interest, his punishment or de∣struction
bears a small proportion to the sum of happiness
and misery in the creation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Right.</HEAD>
<P>RIGHT and obligation are reciprocal; that is, where∣ever
there is a right in one person, there is a corres∣ponding
obligation upon others. If one man has a “right”
to an estate; others are “obliged” to abstain from it—if
parents have a “right” to reverence from their children;
children are “obliged” to reverence their parents; and
so in all other instances.</P>
<P>Now, because moral obligation depends, as we have
seen, upon the will of God, <HI>right,</HI> which is correlative to
it, must depend upon the same. Right therefore signifies,
<HI>the being consistent with the will of God.</HI></P>
<P>If the divine will determines the distinction of right and
wrong, what else is it but an identical proposition, to say
of God, that he acts right, or how is it possible, even to
conceive that he should act wrong: yet these assertions are
intelligible and significant. The case is this: by virtue of
the two principles, that the will of God is the measure of
<PB N="73" REF="110"/>
right and wrong, and that God wills the happiness of his
creatures, we arrive at certain conclusions; which conclu∣sions
become rules, and we soon learn to pronounce ac∣tions
right or wrong, according, as they agree or disagree
with our rules, without looking any farther: and when
the habit is once established of stopping at the rules, we
can go back and compare with these rules, even the divine
conduct itself, and yet it may be true (only not observed
by us at the time) that the rules themselves are deduced
from the divine will.</P>
<P>Right is a quality of persons or of actions.</P>
<P>Of persons; as when we say, such a one has a “right”
to this estate—parents have a “right” to reverence from
their children—the king to allegiance from his subjects—masters
have a “right” to their servants labour—a man
has not a “right” over his own life.</P>
<P>Of actions; as in such expressions as the following: it
is "right to punish murder with death—his behaviour on
that occasion was “right”—it is not “right” to send an
unfortunate debtor to jail—he did or acted “right,” who
gave up his place, rather than vote against his judg∣ment.</P>
<P>In this latter set of expressions, you may substitute the
definition of right above given for the term itself, v. g. it
is “consistent with the will of God” to punish murder
<PB N="74" REF="111"/>
with death—his behaviour on that occasion, was “con∣sistent
with the will of God”—it is not “consistent
with the will of God” to send an unfortunate debtor to
jail—he did, or acted “consistently with the will of God,”
who gave up his place, rather than vote against his judg∣ment.</P>
<P>In the former set, you must vary the phrase a little,
when you introduce the definition instead of the term.
Such a one has a “right” to this estate, that is, it is
“consistent with the will of God,” that such a one should
have it—parents have a “right” to reverence from their
children, that is, it is “consistent with the will of God,”
that children should reverence their parents; and the same
of the rest.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Division of Rights.</HEAD>
<P>RIGHTS, when applied to persons, that is, when ap∣plied
in the way in which we used the term “right”
in the former set of expressions, are</P>
<P>Natural or adventitious.</P>
<P>Alienable or unalienable.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="112"/>
Perfect or imperfect.</P>
<P>I. Rights are natural or adventitious.</P>
<P>Natural rights are such as would belong to a man, al∣though
there subsisted in the world no civil government
whatever.</P>
<P>Adventitious rights are such as would not.</P>
<P><HI>Natural rights</HI> are, a man's right to his life, limbs, and
liberty; his right to the produce of his personal labour;
to the use, in common with others, of air, light, water.
If a thousand different persons, from a thousand different
corners of the world, were cast together upon a desert
island, they would from the first, be every one entitled to
these rights.</P>
<P><HI>Adventitious rights</HI> are, the right of a King over his sub∣jects;
of a General over his soldiers; of a judge over the
life and liberty of a prisoner; a right to elect or appoint
magistrates, to impose taxes, decide disputes, direct the
descent or disposition of property; a right, in a word, in
any one man, or particular body of men, to make laws and
regulations for the rest. For none of these rights would
exist in the newly inhabited island.</P>
<P>And here it will be asked how adventitious rights are
created; or, which is the same thing, how any new rights
<PB N="76" REF="113"/>
can accrue, from the establishment of civil society; as rights
of all kinds, we remember, depend upon the will of God,
and civil society is only the ordinance and institution of
man? For the solution of this difficulty, we must return to
our first principles. God wills the happiness of mankind,
and the existence of civil society, as conducive to that hap∣piness.
Consequently, many things, which are useful for
the support of civil society in general, or for the conduct
and conservation of particular societies already established,
are, for that reason, “consistent with the will of God,”
or “right,” which, without that reason, i. e. without the
establishment of civil, society, would not have been so.</P>
<P>From whence also it appears, that, adventitious rights,
though immediately derived from human appointment, are
not, for that reason, less sacred, nor the obligation to re∣spect
them less cogent, than, natural rights. They both
ultimately rely upon the same authority, the will of God.
Such, a man claims a right to this estate. He can shew,
it is true, nothing for his right, but a rule of the civil
community to which he belongs; and this rule may be
arbitrary, capricious, and absurd. Notwithstanding all
this, there would be the same sin in dispossessing the man
of his estate by craft or violence, as if it had been assigned
him, like the partition of the country amongst the twelve
tribes, by the immediate designation and appointment
of heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="114"/>
II. Rights are alienable or unalienable.</P>
<P>Which terms explain themselves.</P>
<P>The right we have to most of those things, which we
call property, as houses, lands, money, &amp;c. is alienable.</P>
<P>The right of a prince over his people, of a husband
over his wife, of a master over his servant, is generally and
naturally unalienable.</P>
<P>The distinction depends upon the mode of acquiring the
right. If the right originate from a contract; and be
limited to the <HI>person</HI> by the express terms of the contract,
or by the common interpretation of such contracts, (which
is equivalent to an express stipulation) or by a <HI>personal con∣dition</HI>
annexed to the right, then it is unalienable. In all
other cases it is alienable.</P>
<P>The right to civil liberty is alienable; though in the ve∣hemence
of our zeal for it, and in the language of some
political remonstrances, it is often pronounced to be an
unalienable right. The true reason why mankind hold in
detestation the memory of those who have sold their li∣berty
to a tyrant, is, that together with their own, they
sold commonly, or endangered, the liberty of others;
which certainly they had no right to dispose of.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="115"/>
III. Rights are perfect or imperfect.</P>
<P>Perfect rights may be asserted by force, or, what in
civil society comes into the place of private force, by
course of law.</P>
<P>Imperfect rights may not.</P>
<P>Examples of perfect rights. A man's right to his life,
person, house; for if these be attacked, he may repel the
attack by instant violence, or punish the aggressor by law;
a man's right to his estate, furniture, cloaths, money, and
to all ordinary articles of property; for if they be inju∣riously
taken from him, he may compel the author of the
injury to make restitution or satisfaction.</P>
<P>Examples of imperfect rights. In elections of appoint∣ments
to offices, where the qualifications are prescribed,
the best qualified candidate has a right to success; yet,
if he be rejected, he has no remedy. He can neither
seize the office by force, nor obtain redress at law; his right
therefore is imperfect. A poor neighbour has a right to
relief; yet if it be refused him, he must not extort it.
A benefactor has a right to returns of gratitude from the
person he has obliged; yet if he meet with none, he
must acquiesce. Children have a right to affection and
education from their parents; and parents on their part,
to duty and reverence from their children; yet if these
<PB N="79" REF="116"/>
rights be on either side withheld, there is no compulsion
to enforce them.</P>
<P>It may be at first view difficult to apprehend, how a
person should have a right to a thing, and yet have no
right to use the means necessary to obtain it. This diffi∣culty,
like most others in morality, is resolvable into the
necessity of general rules. The reader recollects, that a
person is said to have a “right” to a thing, when it is
“consistent with the will of God” that he should possess
it. So that the question is reduced to this; How it comes
to pass, that it should be consistent with the will of God,
that a person should possess a thing, and yet not be consistent
with the same will that he should use force to obtain it?
The reason is, that the permission of force in this case,
because of the indeterminateness, either of the object, or
of the circumstances of the right, would, in it's conse∣quence,
lead to the permission of force in other cases,
where there was no right at all. The candidate above de∣scribed
has, no doubt, a right to success; but his right
depends upon his qualifications: for instance, upon his
comparative virtue, learning, &amp;c.—there must he some∣body
therefore to compare them. The existence, degree,
and respective importance of these qualifications are all
indeterminate; there must be somebody therefore to de∣termine
them. To allow the candidate to demand success
by force, is to make him the judge of his own qualifica∣tions.
You cannot do this, but you must make all other
candidates, the same; and that manifestly would open a
<PB N="80" REF="117"/>
door to demands, without number, reason, or right. In,
like manner, a poor man has a right to relief from, the
rich; but the mode, season, and quantum of that relief—who
shall contribute to it, or how much—are not ascer∣tained.
Yet these points, must be ascertained, before a
claim to relief can be prosecuted by force. For to allow
the poor to ascertain them for themselves, would be to
expose property to so many of these claims, that it would
lose it's value, or cease indeed to be property. The same
observation holds of all other cases, of imperfect rights;
not to mention, that in the instances of gratitude, affection,
reverence, and the like, force is excluded by the very idea
of the duty, which must be voluntary, or not at all.</P>
<P>Wherever the right is imperfect, in the corresponding
obligation must be so too. I am obliged to prefer the best
candidate, to relieve the poor, be grateful to my benefac∣tors,
take care of my children, and reverence my parents;
but in all these cases, my obligation, like their right, is
imperfect.</P>
<P>I call these obligations “imperfect,” in conformity to
the established language of writers upon the subject; though
the term is not at all to my mind. It seems very ill
chosen on one account, that it leads many to imagine,
that there is less guilt in the violation of an imperfect obli∣gation,
than of a perfect one. Which is a groundless
notion. For an obligation being perfect or imperfect, de∣termines
only whether, violence may or may not be em∣ployed
<PB N="81" REF="118"/>
to enforce it; and determines nothing else. The
degree of guilt incurred by the violation of it, is another
matter, and is determined by circumstances altogether
independent of this distinction. A man, who by a par∣tial,
prejudiced, or corrupt vote, disappoints a worthy
candidate of a station in life, upon which his hopes, possibly,
and livelyhood depend, and thereby discourages merit and
emulation in others, incurs, and persuaded, a much greater
crime, than if he had filched a book out of a library, or
picked a pocket of a handkerchief; though in the one
case, he violates only an imperfect, right, in the other a
perfect one.</P>
<P>As positive precepts are often indeterminate in their ex∣tent,
and the indeterminateness of an obligation makes it,
as we have seen; imperfect it comes to pass, that positive
precepts commonly produce an imperfect obligation.</P>
<P>Negative precepts or prohibitions, being generally pre∣cise,
constitute accordingly a perfect obligation.</P>
<P>The fifth commandment is positive, and the duty which
results from it is imperfect.</P>
<P>The sixth-commandment is negative, and imposes a per∣fect
obligation.</P>
<P>Religion and virtue find their principal exercise amongst
the imperfect obligations; the laws of civil society taking
pretty good care of the rest.</P>

<P>I. A right to the fruits or vegetable produce of the earth</P>
<P>The insensible parts of the creation are incapable of in∣jury;
and it is nugatory to enquire into the right, where
the use can be attended with no injury. But it may be
worth observing, for the sake of an inference which will
appear below, that, as God has created us with a want and
desire of food, and provided things suited by their nature
to sustain and satisfy us, we may fairly presume, that he
intended we should apply them to that purpose.</P>
<P>II. A right to the flesh of animals.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="120"/>
This is a very different claim from the former. Some
apology seems necessary for the pain and loss which we
occasion to brutes, by restraining them of their liberty,
mutilating their bodies, and at last, putting an end to
their lives, which we suppose to be their all, for our plea∣sure
or conveniency.</P>
<P>The reasons alledged in vindication of this practice, are
the following: that brutes being created to prey upon
each other, affords a kind of analogy to prove, that we
were intended to feed upon them; that, if let alone, they
would over-run the earth, and exclude mankind from the
occupation, of it; that they are requited for what they suf∣fer
at our hands, by our care and protection.</P>
<P>Upon which reasons, I would observe, that <HI>the analogy,</HI>
contended for, is extremely lame; brutes having no power
to support life by any other means, which we have; for
the whole human species might subsist entirely upon fruit,
pulse, herbs and roots, as many tribes of Hindoos actually
do. The two other reasons may be good reasons, as far as
they go; for, no doubt, if man had been supported entirely
by vegetable food, a great part of those animals, which
die to furnish his table, would never have lived: but they
by no means justify our right over the lives of brutes, to
the extent in which we exercise it. What danger is there,
for instance, of fish interfering with us, in the use of their
element? Or what do <HI>we</HI> contribute to their support or
preservation?</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="121"/>
It seems to me that it would be difficult to defend this
right, by any arguments which the light and order of na∣ture
afford; and that we are beholden for it, to the per∣mission
recorded in scripture, Gen. ix. 1, 2, 3, “And God
blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, be fruit∣ful,
and multiply and replenish the earth; and the fear
of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every beast
of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, and upon
all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes
of the sea; into your hand are they delivered: every
moving, thing shall be meat for you; even as the green
herb, have I given you all things.” To Adam and his
posterity had been granted at the creation, “every green
herb for meat,” and nothing more. In the last clause
of the passage now produced, the old grant is recited, and
extended to the fresh of animals, “even as the green herb,
have I given you all things.” But this was not till
after the flood; the inhabitants of the antediluvian world
therefore had no such permission, that we know of.
Whether they actually refrained from the flesh of animals,
is another question. Abel, we read, was a keeper of sheep;
and what he kept them for, but to eat, is hard to say (un∣less
it were for sacrifices): might not, however, some of
the stricter sects among them be scrupulous, as to this
point; and might not Noah and his family be of this de∣scription;
for it is not probable that God would publish a
permission, to authorise a practice which had never, been
disputed?</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="122"/>
Wanton, and what is worse, studied cruelty to brutes,
is certainly wrong, as coming within none of these rea∣sons.</P>
<P>From reason then, or revelation, or from both together,
it appears to be God Almighty's intention, that the produc∣tions
of the earth should be applied to the sustentation of
human life. Consequently, all waste and misapplication
of these productions, is contrary to the divine intention
and will; and therefore wrong, for the same reason, that any
other crime is so. Such as the converting of twenty ma∣nors,
as <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror did, into a forest for hun∣ting—or,
what is not much better, suffering them to con∣tinue
in that state—or letting large tracts of land lie barren,
because the owner cannot cultivate them, nor will part
with them, to those who can—or destroying, or suffering
to perish, great part of an article of human provision, in
order to enhance the price of the remainder; which is said
to have been till lately, the case with fish caught for the
London, market—or diminishing the breed of animals, by a
wanton, or improvident consumption of the young; as of
the fry of salmon, the spawn of shell fish; the use of un∣lawful
nets, or at improper seasons; or, what is the same
evil in a smaller way, the expending of human food, on su∣perfluous
dogs or horses—reducing the quantity, to alter the
quality, and generally for the worse; as the distillation of
<PB N="86" REF="123"/>
spirits from bread corn, the boiling down of solid meat for
sauces, essences, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This seems to be the lesson which our Saviour, after his
manner, inculcates, when he bids his disciples “gather up
the fragments, that nothing be lost.” And it opens in-indeed
a new field of duty. Schemes of wealth or profit,
prompt the active part of mankind to cast about, how they
may convert their property to the most advantage—and
their own advantage, and that of the public commonly con∣cur.
But it has not as yet entered into the minds of man∣kind,
that it is a <HI>duty,</HI> to add what we can, to the common
stock of provision, by extracting out of our estates, the most
they will yield; or that it is any sin to neglect this.</P>
<P>From the same intention of God Almighty, we also de∣duce
another conclusion, namely, that nothing ought to be
made exclusive property, which can be conveniently enjoyed
in common.</P>
<P>The general intention of God Almighty is, that the pro∣duce
of the earth be applied to the use of man. This ap∣pears
from the constitution of nature, or, if you will, from
his express declaration; and this is all that appears hither∣to.
Under this general donation, one man has the same
right as another. You pluck an apple from a tree, or take
a lamb out of a flock, for your immediate use and nourish∣ment,
and I do the same; and we both plead for what we
do, the general intention of the Supreme Proprietor. So
<PB N="87" REF="124"/>
far all is right; but you cannot claim the whole tree, or
the whole flock, and exclude me from any share of them,
and plead the general intention. The plea will not serve
you, you must shew something farther. You mush shew,
by probable arguments at least, that it is God's intention,
that these things should be parcelled out to individuals; and
that the established distribution, under which you claim,
should be upheld. Shew me this, and I am satisfied. But
until this be shewn, the general intention, which has been
made appear, and which is all that does appear, must pre∣vail;
and under that, my title is as good as yours. Now
there is no argument to induce such a presumption, but
one, that the thing cannot be enjoyed at all, or enjoyed with
the same, or with nearly the same advantage, while it con∣tinues
in common, as when appropriated. This is true,
where there is not enough for all, or where the article in
question requires care or labour in the production or pre∣servation:
but where no such reason obtains, and the thing
is in it's nature capable of being enjoyed by as many as
will, it seems an arbitrary usurpation upon the rights of
mankind, to confine the use of it to any.</P>
<P>If a medicinal spring were discovered in a field which
was private property, copious enough for every purpose it
could be applied to, I would award a compensation to the
owner of the field, and a liberal profit to take author of the
discovery, especially, if he had bestowed pains or expence
upon the search. But I question, whether any human
laws would be justified, or would justify the owner, in
<PB N="88" REF="125"/>
prohibiting mankind from the use of the water, or setting
such a price upon it, as would almost-amount to a prohi∣bition.</P>
<P>If there he fisheries, which are inexhaustible; as, for
aught I know, the cod-fishery upon the Banks of New∣foundland,
and the herring fishery in the British seas are;
then all those conventions, by which one or two nations
claim to themselves, and guarantee to each other, the ex∣clusive
enjoyment of these fisheries, are so many encroach∣ments
upon the general rights of mankind.</P>
<P>Upon the same principle may be determined a question,
which makes a great figure in books of natural law, <HI>utrum
mare sit liberum?</HI> that is, as I understand it, whether the
exclusive right of navigating particular seas, or a control
over the navigation of these seas, can be claimed consistently
with the law of nature, by any nation. What is necessary
for each nation's safety we allow; as their own bays, creeks,
and harbours, the sea contiguous to, that is, within cannon
shot, or three leagues of their coast; and upon the same
principle of safety (if upon any principle) must be de∣fended,
the claim of the Venetian state to the Adriatic, of
Denmark to the Baltic, of Great Britain to the seas which
invest the island. But, when Spain asserts a right to the
Pacific ocean, or Portugal to the Indian seas, or when any
nation extends it's pretensions much beyond the limits of
it's own territories, they erect a claim, which interferes
<PB N="89" REF="126"/>
with the benevolent designs of providence, and which no
human authority can justify.</P>
<P>III. Another right, which may be called a general right,
as it is incidental to every man who is in a sitnation to claim
it, is the right of extreme necessity; by which is meant, a
right to use or destroy another's property, when it is ne∣cessary
for our own preservation, to do so; as a right to take,
without or against the owner's leave, the first food, cloaths,
or shelter we meet with, when we are in danger of perishing
through want of them; a right to throw goods over board,
to save the ship; or to pull down a house, in order to stop the
progress of a fire; and a few other instances of the same kind.
Of which right the foundation seems to be this, that, when
property was first instituted, the institution was not in∣tended
to operate to the destruction of any: therefore when
such consequences would follow, all regard to it is supper∣seded.
Or rather perhaps these are the few cases, where
the particular consequence exceeds the general consequence;
where the mischief resulting from the violation of the ge∣neral
rule, is over-balanced by the advantage.</P>
<P>Restitution however is due, when in our power; because
the laws of property are to be adhered to, so far as consists
with safety; and restitution, which is one of those laws, sup∣poses
the danger to be over. But what is to be restored? Not
the full value of the property destroyed, but what it was
worth at the time of destroying it; which, considering the
danger it was in of perishing, might be very little.</P>

<P>IF you should see a flock of pigeons in a field of corn;

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Use of the Institution of Property.</HEAD>
<P>THERE must be some very important advantages to
account for an institution, in one view of it, so pa∣radoxical
and unnatural.</P>
<P>The principal of these advantages, are the following.</P>
<P>I. It increases the produce of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="129"/>
The earth, in climates like ours, produces little without
cultivation; and none would be found willing to cultivate
the ground, if others were to be admitted to an equal
share of the produce. The same is true of the care of
flocks and herds of tame animals.</P>
<P>Crabs and acorns, red deer, rabbits, game, and fish,
are all we should have to subsist upon, if we trusted to the
spontaneous productions of this country: and it fares not
much better with other countries. A nation of North
American savages, consisting of two or three hundred, will
occupy, and be half-starved upon a tract of land, which,
in Europe, and with European management, would be
sufficient for the maintenance of as many thousands.</P>
<P>In some fertile soils, with great abundance of fish upon
their coasts, and in regions where cloaths are unnecessary,
a considerable degree of population may subsist without
property, in land; which is the case in the islands of Ota∣heite;
but in others, as in New Zealand, though this sort
of property obtain, in a small degree, the inhabitants for
want of a more secure and regular establishment of it, are
driven ofttimes by the scarcity of provision, to devour each
other.</P>
<P>II. It preserves the produce of the earth to maturity.</P>
<P>We may judge, what would be the effects of a com∣munity
of right to the productions of the earth, from the
<PB N="94" REF="130"/>
trifling specimens that we see of it at present. A cherry-tree
in a hedge-row, nuts in a wood, the grass of an unstinted
pasture, are seldom of much advantage, to any body, be∣cause
people do not wait for the proper season of reaping
them. Corn, if any were sown, would never ripen;
lambs and calves would never grow up to sheep and cows,
because the first person that met with them would reflect,
that he had better take them as they are, than leave them
for another.</P>
<P>III. It prevents contests.</P>
<P>War and waste, tumult and confusion, must be una∣voidable
and eternal, where there is not enough for all,
and where there are no rules to adjust the division.</P>
<P>IV. It improves the conveniency of living.</P>
<P>This it does two ways. It enables mankind to divide
themselves into distinct professions; which is impossible,
unless a man can exchange the productions of his own
art for what he wants from others; and exchange implies
property. Much of the advantage of civilized over sa∣vage
life, depends upon this. When a man is from neces∣sity
his own taylor, tent-maker, carpenter, cook, hunts∣man,
and fisherman, it is not probable that he will be ex∣pert
at any of his callings. Hence the rude habita∣tions,
furniture, cloathing, and implements of savages;
<PB N="95" REF="131"/>
and the tedious length of time which all their operations
require.</P>
<P>It likewise encourages, those arts, by which the accom∣modations
of human life are supplied, by appropriating to
the artist the benefit of his discoveries and improvements;
without which appropriation, ingenuity will never be ex∣erted
with effect.</P>
<P>Upon these several accounts we may venture, with a
few exceptions, to pronounce, that even the poorest and
the worst provided in countries where the property and the
consequences of property prevail, are in a better situation,
with respect to food, raiment, houses and what are called
the necessaries of life, than <HI>any</HI> are, in places where most
things remain in common. The balance therefore, upon
the whole, must preponderate in favour of property with
a great excess.</P>
<P>Inequality of property in the degree in which it exists
in most countries of Europe, abstractedly considered, is
an evil: but it is an evil, which flows from those rules,
concerning the acquisition and disposal of property, by
which men are incited to industry, and the object of their
industry is made secure and valuable. If there be any great
inequality unconnected with this origin, it ought to be
corrected.</P>

<PB N="96" REF="132"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The History of Property.</HEAD>
<P>THE first objects of property were the fruits a man
plucked, and the wild animals he caught; next to
these, the tents or houses he built, the tools he made use
of to catch or prepare his food; and afterwards weapons of
war and offence. Many of the savage tribes in North
America have got no farther than this yet; for they are said
to gather their harvest, and return the produce of their
market with foreigners, into a common hoard or treasury
for the whole tribe. Flocks and herds of tame animals
soon became property; <HI>Abel,</HI> the second from <HI>Adam,</HI> was
a keeper of sheep; sheep and oxen, and camels, and asses,
composed the wealth of the <HI>Jewish</HI> patriarchs, as they do
still of the modern <HI>Arabs.</HI> As the world was first peopled
in the East, where there was a scarcity of water, wells
probably were next made property; as we learn, from the
frequent and serious mention of them in the Old Testa∣ment,
the contentions and treaties about them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxi, 25. xxvi, 18.</NOTE> and from
it's being recorded, amongst the most memorable atchieve∣ments
of very eminent men, that they dug or discovered a
well. Land, which is now so important a part of proper∣ty,
which alone our laws call <HI>real</HI> property, and re∣gard
upon all occasions with such peculiar attention, was
probably not made property in any country, till long after
<PB N="97" REF="133"/>
the institution of many other species of property, that is,
till the country became populous, and tillage began to be
thought of. The first partition of an estate we read of,
was between <HI>Abram</HI> and <HI>Lot;</HI> and was one of the simplest
imaginable: “If thou will take the left hand, then I
will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand,
then I will go to the left.” There are no traces of property
in land in <HI>Caesar</HI>'s account of <HI>Britain;</HI> little of it in the
history of the <HI>Jewish</HI> patriarchs; none of it found amongst
the nations of <HI>North America;</HI> the <HI>Scythians</HI> are expressly
said to have appropriated their cattle and houses, but to have
left their land in common. Property in immoveables con∣tinued
at first no longer than the occupation; that is, so
long as a man's family continued in possession of a cave, and
his flocks depastured upon, a neighbouring hill, no one
attempted, or thought he had a right, to disturb or drive
them out: but when the man quitted his cave, or changed
his pasture, the first who found them unoccupied, entered
upon them, by the same title as his predecessor; and made
way in his turn for any one that happened to succeed him.
All more permanent property in land, was probably poste∣rior
to civil government and to laws; and therefore settled
by these, or according to the will of the reigning chief.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="98" REF="134"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In what the Right of Property is founded.</HEAD>
<P>WE now speak of Property in Land; and there is a
difficulty in explaining the origin of this property,
consistently with the law of nature; for the land was once
no doubt common; and the question is, how any particu∣lar
part of it could justly be taken out of the common,
and so appropriated to the first owner, as to give him a
better right to it than others; and, what, is more, a right
to exclude all others from it.</P>
<P>Moralists have given many different accounts of this
matter; which alone perhaps is a proof that none of
them are satisfactory.</P>
<P>One says, that mankind, when they suffered a parti∣cular
person to occupy a piece of ground, by a tacit con∣sent,
relinquished their right to it; and, as the piece of
ground belonged to mankind collectively, and mankind
thus gave up their right to the first peaceable occupier, it
thenceforward became his property, and no person after∣wards
had a right to molest him in it.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="135"/>
The objection to this account is, that a man's consent
can never be presumed from his silence, where he knows
nothing about the matter; which must have been the
case with all mankind, except the neighbourhood of the
place where the appropriation was made. And to suppose
that the piece of ground previously belonged to the neigh∣bourhood,
and that they had a just power of conferring
a right to it upon whom they pleased, is to suppose the
question resolved, and a partition of land to have already
taken place.</P>
<P>Another says, that each man's limbs and labour are his
own exclusively; that, by occupying a piece of ground,
a man inseparably mixes his labour with it; by which
means the piece of ground becomes thenceforward his own,
as you cannot take it from him, without depriving him
at the same time of something, which is indisputably <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>This is Mr. LOCKE'S solution; and seems indeed a fair
reason, where the value of the labour bears a considera∣ble
proportion to the value of the thing; or where the
thing derives it's chief use and value from the labour.
Thus game and fish, though they be common, whilst at
large in the woods or water, instantly become the pro∣perty
of the person that catches them; because an animal,
when caught, is much more valuable than when at li∣berty;
and this increase of value, which is inseparable
from, and makes a great part of the whole value, is
strictly the property of the fowler, being the produce of
<PB N="100" REF="136"/>
his personal labour. For the same reason, wood or iron,
manufactured into utensils, become the property of the
manufacturer; because the value of the workmanship far
exceeds that of the materials. And upon a similar princi∣ple,
a parcel of unappropriated ground, which a man
should pare, burn, plow, harrow, and sow, for the pro∣duction
of corn, would justly enough be thereby made
his own. But this will hardly hold, in the manner it
has been applied, of taking a ceremonious possession of
a tract of land, as navigators do of new discovered
islands, by erecting a standard, engraving an inscription,
or publishing a proclamation, to the birds and beasts; or
of turning your cattle into a piece of ground, setting up a
landmark, digging a ditch, or planting a hedge round it.
Nor will even the clearing, manuring, and plowing of a
field, give the first occupier a right to it in perpetuity,
and after this, cultivation and all effects of it are ceased.</P>
<P>Another, and in my opinion, a better account of the
first right of ownership, is the following: that, as God
has provided these things for the use of all, he has of
consequence given each leave to take of them what he
wants; by virtue therefore of this leave, a man may ap∣propriate
what he wants to his own use, without asking,
or waiting for the consent of others; in like manner, as,
when an entertainment is provided for the freeholders of a
county, each freeholder goes, and eats and drinks, what
he wants, or chuses, without having, or waiting for the
consent of the other guests.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="137"/>
But then, this reason justifies property, as far as neces∣saries
only, or, at the most, a competent provision for our
natural exigences. For, in the entertainment we speak of
(allowing the comparison to hold in all points), although
every particular freeholder may sit down and eat till he
be satisfied, without any other, leave than that of the
master of the feast, or any other proof of this leave, than
the general invitation, or the manifest design with which
the entertainment is provided; yet you would hardly per∣mit
any one to fill his pockets or his wallet; or carry off
with him a quantity of provision to hoard up, or waste,
or give his dogs, or stew down into sauces, or convert into
articles of superfluous luxury; especially, if by so doing,
he pinched the guests at the lower end of the table.</P>
<P>These are the accounts that have been given of the mat∣ter,
by the best writers upon, the subject; but, were these
accounts less exceptionable than they are, they would none
of them, I fear, avail us in vindicating our present claims
of property in land, unless it were more probable than it is,
that our estates were actually acquired at first, in some of
the ways which these accounts suppose; and that a regular
regard had been had to justice, in every successive trans∣mission
of them since: for if one link in the chain fail,
every title posterior to it falls to the ground.</P>
<P>The real foundation of our right, is the law of the
land.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="138"/>
It is the intention of God, that the produce of the earth
be applied to the use of man; this intention cannot be ful∣filled,
without establishing property; it is consistent there∣fore
with his will, that property be established. The land
cannot be divided into separate property, without leaving it
to the law of the country to regulate that division; it is
consistent therefore with the same will, that the law should
regulate the division; and consequently “consistent with
the will of God,” or “right” that I should possess that
share which these regulations assign me.</P>
<P>By whatever circuitous train of reasoning you attempt to
derive this right, it must terminate at last in the will of
God; the straightest therefore, and shortest way of coming
at this will, is the best.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that my right to an estate does not at
all depend upon the manner or justice of the original acqui∣sition;
nor upon the justice of every subsequent change of
possession. It is not, for instance, the less, nor ought to be
impeached, because the estate was taken possession of, at
first, by a family of aboriginal Britons, who happened to be
stronger than their neighbours; nor because the British pos∣sessor
was turned out by a Roman, and the Roman by a
Saxon invader; or because it was seized, without colour of
right or reason, by a follower of the Norman adventurer;
from whom, after many interruptions of fraud and violence,
it has at length devolved to me.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="139"/>
Nor does the owner's right depend upon the <HI>expediency</HI> of
the law which gives it him. On one side of a brook, an
estate descends to the eldest son; on the other side, to
all the children alike. The right of the claimants under
both laws of inheritance is equal; though the expediency
of such opposite rules must needs be different.</P>
<P>The principles we have laid down upon this subject, ap∣parently
tend to a conclusion, of which a bad use is apt to
be made. As the right of property depends upon the law
of the land, it seems to follow, that a man has a right to
keep and take every thing, which the law will allow him
to keep and take: which in many cases, will authorise the
most manifest and flagitious chicanery. If a creditor, upon
a simple contract, neglect to demand his debt for six years,
the debtor may refuse to pay it. Would it be <HI>right</HI> there∣fore
to do so, where he is conscious of the justice of the
debt? If a person, who is under twenty-one years of age,
contract a bargain (other than for necessaries), he may
avoid it by pleading his minority. But would this be a
fair plea, where, the bargain was; originally just? The di∣stinction
to be taken in such cases is this. With the law,
we acknowledge, resides the disposal of property: so long
therefore, as we keep within the design and intention of a
law, that law will <HI>justify us,</HI> as well <HI>in foro conscientiae,</HI> as <HI>in
soro humano,</HI> whatever be the equity or expediency of the
law itself. But When we convert to one purpose, a rule or
expression of law, which is intended for another purpose;
then, we plead in our justification, not the intention of the
<PB N="104" REF="140"/>
law, but the words; that is, we plead a dead letter, which
can signify nothing: for words <HI>without</HI> meaning or inten∣tion
have no force or effect in justice, much less words
taken <HI>contrary</HI> to the meaning and intention of the speaker
or writer. To apply this distinction to the examples just now
proposed; in order to protect men against antiquated de∣mands,
from which it is not probable they should have
preserved the evidence of their discharge, the law pre∣scribes
a limited time to certain species of private securities,
beyond which, it will not enforce them, or lend it's assisst∣ance
the recovery of the debt. If a man be ignorant, or
dubious of the justice of the demand made upon him, he
may conscientiously plead this limitation; because <HI>he ap∣plies
the rule of law to the purpose for which it was intended.</HI>
But when he refuses to pay a debt, of the reality of which
he is conscious; he cannot, as before, plead the intention of
the statute, and the supreme authority of law, unless he
could shew, that the law <HI>intended</HI> to interpose it's supreme
authority, to acquit men of debts, of the existence and
justice of which they were themselves sensible. Again, to
preserve youth from the practices and impositions, to which
their inexperience exposes them, the law compells the pay∣ment
of no debts incurred within a certain age, nor the per∣formance
of any engagements, except for such necessaries
as are suited to their condition and fortunes. If a young
person therefore perceive that he has been practiced or im∣posed
upon, he may honestly avail himself of the privilege
of his non-age, to defeat the circumvention. But, if he
shelter himself under this privilege, to avoid a fair oblige∣tion,
<PB N="105" REF="141"/>
or equitable contract, he extends the privilege to a case,
in which it is not allowed by intention of law, and in which,
consequently it does not, in natural justice, exist.</P>
<P>As property is the principal subject of Justice, or “of
the determinate relative duties,” we have put down what
we had to say upon it in the first place: we now proceed
to state these duties in the best order we can.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>I. WHENCE the obligation to perform promises
arises.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. In what sense promises are to be interpreted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. In what cases promises are not binding.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. Whence the obligation to perform promises arises.</P>
<P>Those who argue from innate moral principles, suppose
a sense of the obligation of promises to be one of them;
<PB N="106" REF="142"/>
but without assuming this, or any thing else, without
proof, the obligation to perform promises, may be deduced
from the necessity of such a conduct, to the Well being, or
the existence indeed, of human society.</P>
<P>Men act from their expectations. These expectations
are in most cases determined by the assurances and engage∣ments
we receive from, others. If no dependance could be
placed upon these assurances, it would be impossible to
know, what judgment to form of many future events, or
how to regulate our conduct with respect to them. Con∣fidence
therefore in promises, is essential to the intercourse
of human life; because, without it, the greatest part of
our conduct would proceed upon chance. But there could
be no confidence in promises, if men were not obliged to
perform them: the obligation therefore to perform pro∣mises
is essential, to the same end, and in the same degree.</P>
<P>Some may imagine, that, if this obligation were suspended,
a general caution, and mutual distrust would ensue, which
might do as well; but this is imagined, without consider∣ing,
how every hour of our lives we trust to, and depend
upon others; and how impossible it is, to stir a step, or,
what is worse, to sit still a moment without such trust and
dependance. I am now writing at my ease, not doubting
(or rather never thinking and therefore never thinking
about it) but that the butcher will send in the joint of
meat, which I ordered; that his servant will bring it; that
my cook will dress it; that my footman will serve at up;
<PB N="107" REF="143"/>
and that I shall find it upon table at one o'clock. Yet
have I nothing for all this, but the promise of the butcher,
and the implied promise of his servant and mine. And the
same holds, of the most important, as well as the most fa∣miliar
occurrences of social life.</P>
<P>II. In what sense promises are to be interpreted.</P>
<P>Where the terms of a promise admit of more senses than
one, the promise is to be performed in that sense in which
the promiser apprehended at the time that the promisee re∣ceived
it.</P>
<P>It is not the sense in which the promiser actually in∣tended
it, that always governs the interpretation of an
aequivocal promise; for, at that rate, you might excite ex∣pectations,
which you never meant, nor would be obliged,
to satisfy. Much less is it the sense, in which the pro∣misee
actually received the promise; according to that rule,
you might be drawn into engagements which you never
designed to undertake. It must therefore be the sense (for
there is no other remaining) in which the promisee believed
that the promisee accepted his promise.</P>
<P>This will be the same as the actual intention of the promi∣ser,
where the promise is given without collusion or reserve;
but we put the rule in this form, to exclude evasion, where
the popular meaning of a phrase, and the strict gramma∣tical
signification of the words differ, or, in general, where
<PB N="108" REF="144"/>
the promiser attempts to make his escape through some
ambiguity in the expressions he used.</P>
<P><HI>Temures</HI> promised the garrison of <HI>Sebastia,</HI> that, if they
would surrender, <HI>no blood should be shed.</HI> The garrison sur∣rendered;
and <HI>Temures</HI> buried them all alive. Now <HI>Temures</HI>
fulfilled the promise, in one sense, and in the sense too
in which he intended it at the time; but not in the sense
in which the garrison of <HI>Sebastia</HI> actually received it, nor
in the sense in which <HI>Temures</HI> himself knew that the gar∣rison
received it; which last sense, according to our rule,
was the sense he was in conscience bound to have per∣formed
it in.</P>
<P>From the account we have given of the obligation of
promises, it is evident, that this obligation depends upon
the expectations which we <HI>knowingly</HI> and <HI>voluntarily</HI> excite.
Consequently any action or conduct towards. another,
which we are sensible excites expectations in that other,
is as much a promise, and creates as strict an obligation,
as the most express assurances. Taking, for instance, a
relation's child, and educating him for a liberal profession,
or in a manner suitable only for the heir of a large fortune,
as much obliges us, to place him in that profession, or
leave him such a fortune, as if we had given him a pro∣mise
to do so, under our hands and seals. In like manner,
a great man, who encourages an indigent retainer; or a
minister of state, who distinguishes and caresses at his levee,
one who is in a situation to be obliged by his patronage,
<PB N="109" REF="145"/>
engages, by such behaviour, to provide for him.—This is
the foundation of <HI>tacit promises.</HI></P>
<P>You may either, declare your present intention simply;
or you may accompany your declaration with an engage∣ment
to abide by it, which constitutes a complete promise.
In the first case, the duty is satisfied, if you were sincere,
that is, if you entertained at the time, the intention you
expressed, however soon, or for whatever reason, you af∣terwards
change it. In the latter case, you have parted
with the liberty of changing. All this is plain; but it
must be observed, that most of those forms of speech,
which, strictly taken, amount to no more than declara∣rations
of present intention, do yet, in the usual way of
understanding them, excite the expectation, and there∣fore
carry with them the force, of absolute promises. Such
as, “I intend you this place”—“I design to leave you
this estate”—“I purpose giving you my vote”—“I mean
to serve you.”—In which, although the “intention,” the
“design,” the “purpose,” the “meaning,” be expressed in
words of the present time, yet you cannot afterwards
change them, without a breach of good faith. If you have
a mind therefore to make known your present intention,
and yet to reserve to yourself the liberty of changing it;
you must guard your expressions by an additional clause,
as “I intend <HI>at present</HI>”—<HI>if I don't alter</HI>—or the like—and
after all, as there can be no reason for disclosing your in∣tention,
but to excite some degree of expectation or other,
a wanton change of an intention which is once disclosed,
<PB N="110" REF="146"/>
always disappoints somebody; and is always, for that rea∣son,
wrong.</P>
<P>There is, in some men, an infirmity with regard to
promises, which often betrays them into great distress.
From the confusion, or hesitation, or obscurity, with
which they express themselves, especially when overawed,
or taken by surprise, they sometimes encourage expecta∣tions,
and bring upon themselves demands, which, pos∣sibly,
they never dreamed of.—This is a want, not so
much of integrity, as of presence of mind.</P>
<P>III. In what cases promises are not binding.</P>
<P>1. Promises are not binding, where the performance is
<HI>impossible.</HI></P>
<P>But observe, that the promiser is guilty of a fraud,
when he is privately aware of the impossibility, at the
time of making the promise. For when any one promises
a thing, he asserts his belief, at least, of the possibility of
performing it; as no one can accept or understand the
promise under any other supposition. Instances of this
sort are the following. The minister promises a place,
which he knows to be engaged, or not at his disposal—A
father, in settling marriage articles, promises to leave his
<PB N="111" REF="147"/>
daughter an estate, which he knows to be entailed upon
the heir male of his family—A merchant promises with
his daughter a ship, or share of a ship, which he is pri∣vately
advised is lost at sea—An incumbent promises to re∣sign
a living, being, well assured, that his resignation will
not be accepted by the Bishop. The promiser, as in these
cases, with knowledge of the impossibility, is justly an∣swerable
in an equivalent; but otherwise not.</P>
<P>When the promiser himself occasions the impossibility,
it is neither more nor less than a direct breach of the pro∣mise;
as when a soldier maims, or a servant disables him∣self,
to get rid of their engagements.</P>
<P>2. Promises are not binding, where the performance is
<HI>unlawful.</HI></P>
<P>There are two cases of this; one, where the unlawful∣ness
is known to the parties, at the time of making the
promise; as where an assassin promises to dispatch your
rival or your enemy—a servant to betray his master—a
pimp to procure a mistress—or a <HI>friend</HI> to give his assist∣ance
in a scheme of seduction. The parties in these cases
are not obliged to perform what the promise requires, <HI>be∣cause
they were under a prior obligation to the contrary.</HI> From
which prior obligation what is there to discharge them?
their promise—their own act and deed—but an obligation,
from which a man can discharge himself, by his own act
and deed, is no obligation, at all. The guilt therefore of
<PB N="112" REF="148"/>
such promises is in the making, not in the breaking them;
and if, in the interval betwixt the promise and the per∣formance,
a mail so far recover his reflection, as to repent
of his engagements, he ought certainly to break through
them.</P>
<P>The other case is, where the unlawfulness did not ex∣ist,
or was not known, at the time of making the promise;
as where a merchant promises his correspondent abroad,
to send him a ship load of corn, at a time appointed, and
before the time arrives, an embargo is laid upon the ex∣portation
of corn—A woman gives a promise of marriage;
before the marriage, she discovers that her intended hus∣band
is too near a-kin to her, or has a wife yet living. In
all such cases, where the contrary does not appear, it must
he presumed, that the parties supposed, what they pro∣mised
to be lawful, and proceeded entirely upon this sup∣position.
The lawfulness therefore becomes a condition
of the promise; and where the condition fails, the obli∣gation
ceases. Of the same nature was Herod's promise
to his daughter-in-law, “that he would give her what∣ever
she asked, even to the half of his kingdom.” The
promise was not unlawful, in the terms, in which Herod
delivered it; and when it became so by the daughter's
choice, by her demanding “JOHN the Baptist's head,”
Herod was discharged from the obligation of it, for the
reason now laid down, as well as for that given in the last
paragraph.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="149"/>
This rule, “that promises are void, where the perform∣ance
is unlawful,” extends also to imperfect obligations;
for the reason of the rule holds of all obligations. Thus,
if you promise a man a place, or your vote, and he after∣wards
render himself unfit to receive either, you are ab∣solved
from the obligation of your promise; or, if a bet∣ter
candidate appear, and it be a case in which you are
bound by oath, or otherwise, to govern yourself by the
qualification, the promise must be broken through.</P>
<P>And here I would recommend, to young persons espe∣cially,
a caution, from the neglect of which, many in∣volve
themselves in embarrassment and disgrace; and that
is, “never to give a promise which may interfere in
the event with their duty;” for, if it do so interfere,
the duty must be discharged, though at the expence of
their promise, and the peril of their good name.</P>
<P>The specific performance of a promise is reckoned a per∣fect
obligation. And many casuists have laid it down, in
opposition to what has been here asserted, that, where a
perfect and an imperfect, obligation clash, the perfect obli∣gation
is to be preferred. For which opinion however,
there seems to be no reason, but what arises from the
terms “perfect” and “imperfect,” the impropriety of
which has been remarked above. The truth is, of two
contradictory obligations, that ought to prevail, which is
prior in point of time.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="150"/>
It is the <HI>performance</HI> being unlawful, and not any un∣lawfulness
in the subject or motive of the promise, which
destroys it's validity; therefore a bribe, after the vote is
given; the wages of prostitution; the reward of any
crime, after the crime is committed, ought, if promised,
to be paid. For the sin and mischief, by this supposition,
are over, and will be neither more nor less for the per∣formance
of the promise.</P>
<P>In like manner, a promise does not lose it's obligation,
merely because it proceeded from an <HI>unlawful motive.</HI> A
certain person, in the life-time of his wife, who was then
sick, paid his addresses, and, promised marriage to another
woman—the wife died; and the, woman demanded per∣formance,
of the promise. The man, who, it seems, had
changed his mind, either felt or pretended, doubts concern∣ing
the obligation of such a promise, and referred his
case to bishop SANDERSON, the most eminent in this kind
of knowledge, of his time. Bishop SANDERSON, after
writing a dissertation upon the question, adjudged the pro∣mise
to be void. In which however, upon our principles,
he was wrong; for, however criminal the affection might
be, which induced the promise, the performance, when
it was demanded, was lawful; which, is the only lawful∣ness required.</P>
<P>A promise cannot be deemed unlawful, where it pro∣duces,
when performed, no effect beyond what would
have taken place, had the promise never been made. And
<PB N="115" REF="151"/>
this is the single case, in which the obligation of pro∣mise
will justify a conduct, which, unless it had been pro∣mised,
would be unjust. A captive, may lawfully recover
his liberty, by a promise of neutrality; for his conqueror
takes nothing by the promise, which he might not have
secured by his death or confinement: and neutrality
would be innocent in him, although criminal in another.
It is manifest, however, that promises, which come into
the place of coercion, can extend no farther than to pas∣sive
compliances; for coercion itself could compell no
more. Upon the same principle, promises of secresy ought
not to be violated, although the public would derive ad∣vantage
from the discovery. Such promises contain no un∣lawfulness
in them, to destroy their obligation; for, as
the information would not have been; imparted upon any
other condition, the public lose nothing by the promise,
which they would have gained without it.</P>
<P>3. Promises are not binding, where they contradict a
former promise.</P>
<P>Because the performance is then unlawful, which re∣solves
this case into the last.</P>
<P>4. Promises are not binding before acceptance; that is,
before notice given to the promisee; for, where the pro∣mise
is beneficial, acceptance may be presumed. Before
the promise be communicated to the promisee, it is the
<PB N="116" REF="152"/>
same only, as a resolution in the mind of the promiser, which may be altered at pleasure. For no expectation has
been excited, therefore none can be disappointed.</P>
<P>But suppose I declare, my intention to: a third person,
who, without any authority from me, conveys my decla∣ration
to the promisee; is that such a notice as will be
binding upon me? It certainly is not: for I have not <HI>vo∣luntarily
excited any expectation,</HI> which is of the essence of a
promise.</P>
<P>5. Promises are not binding, which are released by the
promisee.</P>
<P>This is evident; but it may be sometimes doubted who
is the promisee. If I give a promise <HI>to</HI> A, of a place or vote
for B; as to a father for his son; to an uncle for his ne∣phew;
to a friend of mine, for a relation or friend of his;
then A is the promisee, whose consent I must obtain, to re∣lease
me from the engagement.</P>
<P>If I promise a place or vote to B <HI>by</HI> A, that is, if A be
a messenger to convey the promise, as if should, say, “you may tell B, that he shall have this place, or may depend
upon my vote;” or if A be employed to introduce B's
request, and I answer in any terms which amount to a com∣pliance
with it, then B is the promisee.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="153"/>
Promises to one person, for the benefit of another, are
not released by the death of the promisee. For his death
neither makes the performance impracticable, nor implies
any consent to release the promiser from it.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Erroneous</HI> promises are not binding in certain cases;
as,</P>
<P>1. Where the error proceeds from the mistake or misre-presentation
of the promisee.</P>
<P>Because a promise evidently supposes the truth of the ac∣count
which the promisee relates, in order to obtain it. A
beggar solicits your charity, by a story of the most pitiable
distress—you promise to relieve him, if he will call again—in the interval you discover his story to be made up of
iies—this discovery, no doubt, releases you from your pro∣mise.
One who wants your service, describes the business
or office he would engage you for—you promise to under∣take
it—when you come to enter upon it, you find the
profits less, the labour more, or some material circum∣stance
different from the account he gave you—In such case
you are not bound by your promise.</P>
<P>2. When the promise is understood by the promisee, to
proceed upon a certain supposition; or when the promiser
thought he so understood it; and that supposition turns out
to be false; then the promise is not binding.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="154"/>
This intricate rule will be best explained by an example.
A father receives an account, from abroad, of the death of
his only son—soon after which, he promises his fortune to
his nephew—the account turns out to be false—the father,
we say, is released from his promise; not merely because he
never would have made it, had he known the truth of
the case—for that alone won't do—but because the ne∣phew
also himself understood the promise to proceed upon
the supposition of his cousin's death; or at least his
uncle thought he so understood it; and could not think other∣wise.—The
promise proceeded upon this supposition, in the
promiser's own apprehension, and, as he believed, in the
apprehension of both parties; and this belief of his is the
precise circumstance which sets him free. The foundation
of the rule is plainly this, a man is bound only to satisfy
the expectation which he intended to excite; whatever con∣dition
therefore he intended to subject that expectation to,
becomes an essential condition of the promise.</P>
<P>Errors, which come not within this description, do not
annul the obligation of a promise. I promise a candidate
my vote—presently another candidate presents himself, for
whom I certainly would have reserved it, had I been ac∣quainted
with his design. Here therefore, as before, my
promise proceeded from an error; and I never should have
given such a promise, had I been aware of the truth of the
case, as it has turned out—but the <HI>promisee</HI> did not know
this—<HI>he</HI> did not receive the promise, subject to any such
condition, or as proceeding from any such supposition—nor
<PB N="119" REF="155"/>
did I at the time imagine he so received it—-This error,
therefore, of mine, must fall upon my own head, and The
promise be observed notwithstanding. A father promises
a certain fortune with his daughter, supposing himself to
be worth so much—his circumstances turn out upon ex∣amination,
worse than he was aware of. Here again the
promise was erroneous, but, for the reason, assigned in the
last case, will nevertheless be obligatory.</P>
<P>The case of erroneous promises, is attended with some
difficulty; for to allow every mistake, or change of circum∣stances,
to dissolve the obligation of a promise, would be
to allow a latitude, which might evacuate the force of al∣l
most all promises: and, on the other hand, to gird the obli∣gation
so tight, as to make no allowances for manifest, and
fundamental errors, would, in many instances, be produc∣tive
of great hardship and absurdity.</P>
<P>It has long been controverted amongst moralists, whe∣ther
promises are binding, which are extorted by violence
or fear. The obligation of all promises results, we have
seen, from the necessity, or the use, of that confidence,
which mankind repose in them. The question, therefore,
whether, these promises are binding, will depend upon this,
whether mankind upon the whole, are benefited by the
confidence placed in such promises? A highwayman at∣tacks
you—and being disappointed of his booty, threatens
or prepares to murder you—you promise, with many so∣lemn
<PB N="120" REF="156"/>
assverations, that, if he will spare your life, he shall
find a purse of money left for him, at a place appointed—upon▪
the faith of this promise, he forbears from farther
violence. Now your life was saved by the confidence re∣posed
in a promise, extorted by fear; and the lives of many
others may be saved by the same. The promise, therefore,
it should seem, ought to be fulfilled.</P>
<P>There are other cases which are plainer; as where a
magistrate confines a disturber of the public peace in jail,
till he promise to behave better; or a prisoner of war pro∣mises,
if set at liberty, to return within a certain time.
These promises, say moralists, are binding, because the
violence or duress is just; but, the truth is, because there
is the same use of confidence in these promises, as of con∣fidence
in the promises of a person at perfect liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Vows</HI> are promises to God. Their obligation cannot be
made out upon the same principle as that of other pro∣mises.
The violation of them however implies, and in∣spires,
a want of reverence to the Supreme Being; which
is enough to make it sinful.</P>
<P>There is no command or encouragement in the Christi∣an
scriptures to make vows; much less any authority to
break through them, when they are made. The few in∣stances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts. xviii. 18. xxi. 23.</NOTE>
<PB N="121" REF="157"/>
of vows we read of in the New Testament, were
religiously observed.</P>
<P>The rules we have laid down concerning promises, are
applicable to vows. Thus Jephthah's vow, taking it in the
sense in which that transaction is commonly understood,
was not binding; because the performance, in that contin∣gency,
became unlawful.</P>

<P>A CONTRACT is a mutual promise. The oblige∣tion
therefore of contracts; the sense in which they
are to be interpreted; and the cases where they are not
binding, will be the same as of promises.</P>
<P>From the principle established in the last chapter, that
the obligation of promises is to be measured by the expec∣tation,
which the promiser any how voluntarily and know∣ingly
excites, results a rule, which governs the construc∣tion

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts, of Sale.</HEAD>
<P>THE rule of justice, which wants, most to be incul∣cated,
in the making bargains, is, that the seller
is bound in conscience to disclose the faults of what he
offers to sale. Amongst other methods of proving this,
one may be the following:</P>
<P>I suppose it will be allowed, that to advance a direct
falsehood in recommendation of our wares, by ascribing to
<PB N="123" REF="159"/>
them some quality, which, we know, they have not, is dis∣honest.
Now compare with this the designed concealment
of same fault, which we know, they have. The motives
and the effects of actions are the only points of compa∣rison,
in which their, moral quality can differ; but the mo∣tive
in these two cases is the same, viz. to procure higher
price than we expect otherwise to obtain; the effect, that
is, the prejudice to the buyer, is also the same; for he
finds himself equally, put of pocket by his bargain, whe∣ther
the commodity, when he gets home with it, turn out
worse than he had supposed, by the want of some quality
which he expected, or the discovery of some fault which
he did not expert. If therefore actions be the same as to all
moral purposes, which proceed from the same motives, and
produce the same effects; it is making a distinction with∣out
a difference, to esteem it a cheat, to magnify, beyond
the truth, the virtues of what we have to fell; but none
to conceal it's faults.</P>
<P>It adds to the value of this kind of honesty, that the
faults of many things are of a nature not to be known by
any, but the persons that have used them: so that the
buyer has no security from imposition, but in the ingénue∣ousness
and integrity of the seller.</P>
<P>There is one exception, however, to this rule, where
the silence of the seller implies some fault in the thing to
be sold; and where the buyer has a compensation in the
price, for the risk he runs: as where a horse, in a London
<PB N="124" REF="160"/>
repository, is sold by public auction, without warranty; the
want of warranty is notice of some unsoundness, and pro∣duces
a proportionable abatement in the price.</P>
<P>To this of concealing the faults of what we want to put
off, may be referred, the practice of passing; bad money;
which most people will confess to be wrong, not withstand∣ing
the vulgar excuse, that you have taken it for good, and
must therefore get rid of it Which excuse is much the
same, as if one, who had been robbed upon the highway,
should imagine he had a right to reimburse himself out of
the pocket of the first traveller he met; the justice of
which reasoning the traveller possibly may not com∣prehend.</P>
<P>Where there is no monopoly or combination, the mar∣ket
price is always a fair price; because it will always be
proportionable to the use and scarcity of the article.
Hence, there need be no scruple about demanding, or tak∣ing
the market price; and all those expressions, “provi∣sions
are extravagantly dear,” “corn bears an unreason∣able
price,” and the like, import no unfairness or unreason∣ableness
in the seller.</P>
<P>If your taylor or your draper charge, or even ask you
more for a suit of cloaths, than the market price, you com∣plain
that you are imposed upon; you pronounce the man
who makes such a charge dishonest: although, as the
tradesman's goods were his own, and he had a right to
<PB N="125" REF="161"/>
prescribe the terms, upon which he would consent to part
with them, it may be questioned what dishonesty there
can be in the case, and where in the imposition consists.
Whoever opens a shop, or in any manner exposes goods to
public sale, virtually engages to deal with his customers at
a market price; because it is upon the faith and idea such
an engagement, that any one comes within his shop doors,
or offers to treat with him. This is expected by the buyer;
is known to be so expected by the seller; which is enough,
according to the rule delivered above, to make it a part of
the contract between them, though not a syllable be said
about it. The breach of this implied contract constitutes
the fraud enquired after.</P>
<P>Hence, if you disclaim any such engagement, you may
set what value you please upon your property. If, upon
being asked to sell a house, you answer that the house suits
your fancy or conveniency, and that you will not turn
yourself out of it, under such a price; the price fixed may
be double of what the house cost, or would fetch at a public
sale, without any imputation of injustice or extortion upon
you.</P>
<P>If the tiling fold be damaged, or perish, between the sale and
the delivery, ought the buyer to bear the loss, or the
seller? This will depend upon the construction of the con∣tract.
If the seller, either expressly, or by implication, or
by custom, engage to <HI>deliver</HI> the goods; as if I buy a set of
china, and the china-man ask me whither he shall bring
<PB N="126" REF="162"/>
or send them to, and they are broken in the conveyance;
the seller must abide by the loss. If the thing sold remain
with the seller, at the instance, or for the conveniency of
the buyer; then the buyer undertakes the risk; as if I buy
a horse, and mention, that I will send for it on such a
day, which is in effect, desiring that it may continue with
the seller till I do send for it; then, whatever misfortune
befalls the horse in the meantime, must be at my cost.</P>
<P>And here, once for all, I would observe, that innume∣rable
questions of this sort are determined solely by <HI>custom;</HI>
not that custom possesses any proper authority to alter or
ascertain the nature of right and wrong; but because the
contracting parties are presumed to include in their stipu∣lation,
all the conditions which custom has annexed to
contracts of the same sort: and when the usage is noto∣rious,
and no exception made to it, this presumption is
generally agreeable to the fact.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It happens here, as many cases, that what the parties ought to do, and what a judge or arbitrator would award to be done, may be very differ∣rent. What the parties ought to do, by virtue of their contract, depends upon their consciousness, at the time of making it: whereas a third person finds it necessary to found his judgment upon presumptions, which presump∣tions may be false, although the most probable that he could proceed by.</NOTE></P>
<P>If I order a pipe of port from a wine merchant abroad;
at what period the property passes from the merchant to
me; whether upon delivery of the wine at the merchant's warehouse; upon it's being put on shipboard at Oporto;
<PB N="127" REF="163"/>
upon the arrival of the ship in England; at it's destined port;
or not till the wine be committed to my servants, or de∣posited

no decision, but what custom points out. Whence, in

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts of Hazard.</HEAD>
<P>BY Contracts of Hazard, I mean gaming; and insu∣rance.</P>
<P>What some say of this kind of contracts, “that one
side ought not to have any advantage over the other,” is
neither practicable nor true. It is not practicable; for that
perfect equality of skill and judgment, which this rule re∣quires,
is seldom to be met with. I might not have it in
my power to play a game at cards, billiards, or tennis;
lay a wager at a horse race; or underwrite a policy of
insurance, once in a twelvemonth; if I must wait till I
meet with a person, whose art, skill, and judgment, in
these matters, is neither greater nor less than my own.
Nor is this equality requisite to the justice of the contract.
One party, may give to the other the whole of the stake,
<PB N="128" REF="164"/>
if he please; and the other party may justly accept it, if
it be given him; much more therefore may one give to
the other a stake or the or, what is exactly the same
thing, an advantage in the chance of winning the whole.</P>
<P>The proper restriction is, that neither side have an ad∣vantage,
by means which the other is not aware of; for
this is an advantage taken, without being <HI>given.</HI> Although
the event be still an uncertainty, your advantage in the
chance has a certain value; and so much of the stake, as
that value amounts to, is taken from your adversary with∣out
his knowledge, and therefore without his consent.
If I sit down to a game at whist, and have an advantage
over the adversary, by means of a better memory, closer
attention, or a superior knowledge of the rules and chances
of the game, the advantage is fair; because it is obtained
by means which the adversary is aware of; for he is
aware, when he sits down with me, that I shall exert the
skill that I possess, to the utmost. But if I gain an ad∣vantage
by packing the cards, glancing my eye into the
adversaries hands, or by concerted signals with my part∣ner,
it is a dishonest advantage; because it depends upon
means, which the adversary never because that I make
use of.</P>
<P>The same distinction holds of all contracts, into which
chance enters. If I lay a wager at a horse race, founded
upon the conjecture I form the appearance, and cha∣racter,
and breed of the horse, I am justly entitled to any
<PB N="129" REF="165"/>
advantage which my judgment gives me; but, if I carry
on a clandestine correspondence with the jockies, and find
out from them, that a trial has been, actually made, or
that it is settled before-hand, which horse shall win the race;
all such information is so much fraud, because derived from
sources, which the other did not suspect, when he pro∣posed
or accepted the wager.</P>
<P>In speculations in trade, or in the stocks, if I exercisse
my judgment upon the general aspect and posture of public
affairs, and deal with a person who conducts himself by
the same sort of judgment; the contract has all the equa∣lity
in it which is necessary: but, if I have access to se∣crest
of state at home, or private advice of some decisive
measure or event abroad, I cannot avail myself of these
advantages with justice, because they are excluded by the
contract, which proceeded upon the supposition, that I
had no such advantage.</P>
<P>In insurances, where the underwriter computes his risk
entirely from the account given by the person insured, it
is absolutely necessary, to the justice and validity of the
contract, that this account be exact and complete.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts of lending of inconsumable Property.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the identical loan is to be returned, as a
book, a horse, a harpsichord, it is called <HI>incon∣sumable</HI>
in opposition to corn, wine, money, and those
things which perish or are parted with in the use, and
can therefore only be returned, in kind.</P>
<P>The questions under this head are few and simple. The
first is, if the thing lent be lost or damaged, who ought to bear
the loss or damage? If it be damaged by the use, or by
accident in the use for which it was lent, the lender must
bear it; as if I hire a job-coach, the wear, tear, and soil∣ing
of the coach, must belong to the lender; or a horse to
go a particular journey, and in going the proposed journey,
the horse die, or be lamed, the loss must be the lender's:
on the contrary, if the damage be occasioned by the fault
of the borrower, or by, accident in some use for which it
was not lent; then the borrower must make, it good; as if
the coach be overturned by the carelessness of your drun∣ken
coachman, or broken to pieces; or the horse be hired
to take a morning's ride upon, and you go a hunting with
him, or leap him over hedges, or put him into your cart,
<PB N="131" REF="167"/>
or carriage, and he be strained, or staked, or galled, or
accidentally hurt, or drop down dead, whilst you are
thus using him; you must make satisfaction to the
owner.</P>
<P>The two cases are distinguished, because in one case, the
owner foresees the damage or risk, and therefore consents
to undertake it; in the other case, he does not.</P>
<P>An estate or house may, during the term of a lease, be
so increased or diminished in it's value, as to become worth
much more, or much less, than the rent agreed to be paid
for it. In some of which cases, it may be doubted, to
whom the advantage or disadvantage of natural right be∣longs.
The rule of justice seems to be this: if the alte∣ration
might be expected by the parties, the hirer must
take the consequence; if it could not, the owner. An
orchard, or a vineyard, or a mine, or a fishery, or a de∣coy,
may this year yield nothing, or next to nothing,
yet the tenant shall pay his rent; and if they next year
produce ten times the usual profit, no more shall be de∣manded;
because the produce is in it's nature preca∣rious,
and this variation might be expected. If an estate
in the fens of <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> or the isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> be overflowed
with water, so as to be incapable of occupation, the te∣nant,
notwithstanding, is bound by his lease; because he
entered, into it with a knowledge and foresight of this
danger. On the other hand, if by the irruption of the
sea into a country where it was never known to have
<PB N="132" REF="168"/>
come before, by the change of the course of a river, the
fall of a rock, the breaking out of a volcano, the bursting
of a moss, the incursions of an enemy, or, by a mortal
contagion amongst the cattle; if by means like these, the
estate change, or lose it's value, the loss shall fall upon
the owner; that is, the tenant shall either be discharged
from his agreement, or be entitled to an abatement of
rent. A house in <HI>London,</HI> by the building of a bridge,
the opening of a new road or street, may become of ten
times it's former value; and by contrary causes, may be
as much reduced in value: here also, as before, the owner,
not the hirer, shall be affected by the alteration. The
reason upon which our determination proceeds, is this,
that changes such as these, being neither foreseen, nor
provided for, by the contracting parties, form no part or
condition of the contract; and therefore ought to have
the same effect as if no contract at all had been made,
(for none was made with respect to <HI>them</HI>) that is, ought to
fall upon the owner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts concerning the lending of Money.</HEAD>
<P>THERE exists no reason, in the law of nature, why
a man should not be paid for the lending of his
money; as well as of any other property into which the
money might be converted.</P>
<P>The scruples that have been entertained upon this head,
and upon the foundation of which, the receiving of inte∣rest
or usury (for they formerly meant the same thing) was
once prohibited in almost all Christian countries,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By a statute of JAMES the First, interest above eight pounds per cent. was prohibited, (and consequently under that rate allowed) with this sage provision; <HI>That this statute shall not be construed or expounded to allow the practice of usury in point of religion or conscience.</HI></NOTE> arose
from a passage in the law of MOSES, <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> xxiii, 19,
20, “Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother;
usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing,
that is lent upon usury: unto a stranger thou mayest
lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not
lend upon usury.”</P>
<P>This, prohibition is now generally understood to have
been intended for the Jews alone, as part of the civil or
<PB N="134" REF="170"/>
political law of their nation; and calculated to preserve
that distribution of property, to which many of their
institutions were subservient; as the marriage of an heiress
within, her own tribe; of a widow, who was left childless,
to her husband's brother; the year of jubilee, when alie∣nated
estates reverted to the family of the original propri∣etor;
regulations, which were never thought to be binding
upon any but the commonwealth of Israel.</P>
<P>This interpretation is confirmed, I think, beyond all con∣troversy,
by the distinction made in the law, between a Jew
and a foreigner, “unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon
usury, but unto thy brother, thou mayest not lend upon
usury,” a distinction, which could hardly have been ad∣mitted,
into a law, which the divine author intended to
be of moral and of universal obligation.</P>
<P>The rate of interest is in most countries regulated by
law. The Roman law allowed of twelve pounds per cent.
which <HI>Justinian</HI> reduced at one stroke to four pounds. A
statute of the thirteenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which
was the first that tolerated the receiving of interest in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
restrained it to ten pounds per cent; a statute of <HI>James</HI>
the First to eight pounds; of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, to six
pounds.; of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> to five pounds, on pain of treble
value of the money lent; at which rate and penalty the
matter now stands. The policy of these regulations is, to
check the power of accumulating wealth, without industry;
to give encouragement to trade, by enabling adventurers
<PB N="135" REF="171"/>
in it, to borrow money, at a moderate price; and of late
years, to enable the state to borrow the subject's money
themselves.</P>
<P>Compound interest, though forbidden by the law of
England, is agreeable, enough to natural equity; for inte∣rest,
detained after it is due, becomes, to all intents and
purposes, part of the sum lent.</P>
<P>It is a question, which sometimes occurs, how money bor∣rowed
in one country, ought to be paid in another, where
the relative value of the precious metals is not the same.
For example, suppose I borrow a hundred guineas in Lon∣don,
where each guinea is worth one and twenty shillings,
and meet my creditor in the East Indies, where a guinea is
worth no more perhaps than nineteen is it a satisfaction of the
debt to return a hundred guineas? or must I make up so
many times one and twenty shillings? I should think the
latter; for it must be presumed, that my creditor, had he
not lent me his guineas, would have disposed of them, in
such a manner, as to have now had, in the place of them,
so many one and twenty shillings; and the question sup∣poses,
that he neither intended, nor ought to be a sufferer,
by parting with his money to me.</P>
<P>When the relative value of coin is altered by an act of
the state; if the alteration would have extended to the iden∣tical
pieces which were lent, it is enough to return an
equal number of pieces of the same denomination, or their
<PB N="136" REF="172"/>
present value in any other. As if guineas were reduced
by act of parliament to twenty shillings, so many twenty
shillings, as I borrowed guineas, would be a just repayment.
It would be otherwise, if the reduction was owing to a de∣basement
of the coin; for then respect ought to be had,
to the comparative value, of the old guinea, and the
new.</P>
<P>Whoever borrows money is bound in conscience to re∣pay
it. This every man can see; but every man cannot
see, or does not however reflect, that he is, in consequence,
also bound, to use the means necessary to enable himself to
repay it. “If he pay the money, when he has it, or has it
to spare, he does all that an honest man can do,” and all,
he imagines, that is required of him; whilst the previous
measures, which are necessary to furnish him with the mo∣ney,
he makes no part of his care, nor observes to be as
much his duty, as the other; such as selling a family seat,
or a family estate; contracting his plan of expence; lay∣ing
down his equipage; reducing the number of his ser∣vants;
or any of those humiliating sacrifices, which justice
requires of a man in debt, the moment he discovers, that
he has no reasonable prospect of paying his debts without
them a prospect, which depends upon the continuance of
his own life, will not satisfy an honest man, if a better
provision be in his power; for it is a breach of faith to sub∣ject
a creditor, when we can help it, to the risk of our life,
be the event what it will; that not being the security to
credit was given.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="173"/>
I know few subjects which have been more misunder∣stood
than the law which authorises the imprisonment of
insolvent debtors. It has been represented as a gratuitous
cruelty, which contributes nothing to the reparation of the
creditor's loss, or to the advantage of the community. This
prejudice arises principally from considering the sending of
a debtor to jail, as an act of private satisfaction to the cre∣ditor,
instead of a public punishment. As an act of satis∣faction
or revenge, it is always wrong in the motive, and
often intemperate and undistinguishing in the exercise.
Consider it as a public punishment, founded upon the same
reason, and subject to the same rules, as other punishments;
and the justice of it, together with the degree to which it
should be extended, and the objects upon whom it may be
inflicted, will be apparent. There are frauds relating to
insolvency, against which it is as necessary to provide pu∣nishment,
as for any public crimes whatever; as where a
man gets your money into his possession, and forthwith runs
away with it; or, what is little better, squanders it in vi∣tious
expences; or stakes it at the gaming table; in the al∣ley;
or upon wild adventures in trade; or is conscious at
the time he borrows it, that he can never repay it; or wil-fully
puts it out of his, power by profuse living; or con∣ceals
his effects, or transfers them by collusion to ano∣ther;
not to mention the obstinacy of some debtors, who
had rather rot in a jail, than deliver up their estates; for,
to say the truth, the first absurdity is in the law itself,
which leaves it in a debtor's power to withhold any part of
his property from the claim of his creditors. The only
<PB N="138" REF="174"/>
question is, whether the punishment be properly placed in
the hands of an exasperated creditor? for which it may be
said, that these frauds are so subtle and versatile, that no∣thing
but a discretionary
power can overtake them; and
that no discretion is likely to be so well informed, so vigi∣lant,
and so active, as that of the creditor.</P>
<P>It must be remembered, however, that the confinement
of a debtor in jail is a punishment; and that every punish∣ment
supposes a crime. To pursue therefore, with the ex∣tremity
of legal rigour, a sufferer, whom the fraud or
failure of others, his own want of capacity, or the disap∣pointments
and miscarriages to which all human affairs
are subject, have reduced to ruin, merely because we are
provoked by our loss, and seek to relieve the pain we feel,
by that which we inflict, is repugnant not only to hu∣manity,
but to justice; for it is to pervert a provision of
law, designed for a different and a salutary purpose, to the
gratification of private spleen and resentment. Any alte∣ration
in these laws, which could distinguish the degrees of
guilt, or convert the service of the insolvent debtor some
public profit, might be an improvement; but any considerable
mitigation of their rigour, under colour of relieving, the
poor, would increase their hardships. For whatever de∣prives
the creditor of his power of coercion, deprives him of
his security: and as this must add greatly to the difficulty
of obtaining credit, the poor, especially the lower sort of
tradesmen, are the first who would, suffer by such a regu∣lation.
As tradesmen must buy <HI>before</HI> they sell, you would
<PB N="139" REF="175"/>
exclude from trade two thirds of those who now carry it
on, if none were enabled to enter into it, without a capital
sufficient for prompt payments. An advocate, therefore,
for the interests of this important class of the community,
will deem it more eligible, that one out of a thousand
should be sent to jail by his creditor, than that the nine
hundred and ninety-nine should be straitened, and embar∣rassed,
and many of them lie idle, by the want of credit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts, of Labour.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Service.</HEAD>
<P>SERVICE in this country is, as it ought to be volun∣tary,
and by contract.; and the master's authority ex∣tends
no farther than the terms, or equitable construction
of the contract, will justify.</P>
<P>The treatment of servants, as to diet, discipline, and ac∣commodation,
the kind and quantity of work to be required
of them, the intermission, liberty, and indulgence to be
allowed them, must be determined in a great measure by
custom; for, where the contract involves so many parti∣culars,
the contracting parties express a few perhaps of the
<PB N="140" REF="176"/>
principal, and by mutual understanding, refer the rest to
the known custom of the country in like cases.</P>
<P>A servant is not bound to obey the unlawful commands
of his master; to minister, for instance, to his unlawful
pleasures; or to assist him in unlawful practices in his pro∣fession;
as in smuggling, or adulterating the articles which
he deals in, For the servant is bound by nothing but his
own promise; and the obligation of a promise extends not
to things unlawful.</P>
<P>For the same reason, the master's authority is no justifi∣cation
to the servant in doing wrong; for the servant's own
promise, upon which that authority is; founded, would be
none.</P>
<P>Clerks and apprentices ought to be employed entirely in
the profession or trade, which they are intended, to learn.
Instruction is their wages; and to deprive them of the op∣portunities
of instruction, by taking up their time with oc∣cupations
foreign to their business, is to defraud them of
their wages.</P>
<P>The master is responsible for what a servant does in the
ordinary course of his employment; for it is done under a
general authority committed to him, which is in justice,
equivalent to a specific direction. Thus, if I pay money
to a banker's clerk, the banker is accountable; but not,
<PB N="141" REF="177"/>
if I had paid it to his butler or his footman, whose business
it is not to receive money. Upon the same principle, if I
once send a servant to take up goods upon credit, whatever
goods he afterwards takes up at the same shop, so long as
he continues in. my service, are justly chargeable to my
account.</P>
<P>The law of this country goes great lengths, in intending
a kind of concurrence in the master, so as to charge him
with the consequences of his servant's conduct. If an
inn-keeper's servant rob his guests, the inn-keeper must
make restitution.; if a farrier's servant lame, your horse,
the farrier must answer for the damage; and still farther,
if your coachman or carter drive over a passenger in the
road, the passenger may recover from you a satisfaction
for the hurt he suffers. But these determinations stand, I
think, rather upon the authority of the law,: than any
principle, of natural justice.</P>
<P>There is a carelessness and facility in giving charac∣ters,
as it is called, of servants, especially when given
in writing, or according to some established form, which,
to speak, plainly of it, is a cheat upon those who
accept them. They are given with so little reserve
and veracity, that I should as soon depend, says the au∣thor
of the Rambler, upon an acquittal, at the Old Bailey,
by way of recommendation, of a servant's honesty, as upon
one of these characters. It is sometimes carelessness; and
sometimes also to get rid of a bad servant, without the
<PB N="142" REF="178"/>
uneasiness of a dispute; for which nothing can be pleaded,
but the most ungenerous of all excuses, that the person
we deceive is a stranger.</P>
<P>There is a conduct, the reverse of this, but more inju∣rious,
because the injury falls where there is no remedy.
I mean the obstructing of a servant's advancement, be∣cause
you are unwilling to spare his service. To stand in
the way of your servant's interest, is a poor return for his
fidelity; and affords flender encouragement for good be∣haviour,
in this numerous, and therefore important, part
of the community. It is a piece of injustice, which, if
practiced towards an equal, the law of honor would lay
hold of; as it is, it is neither uncommon nor dissrepu∣table.</P>
<P>A master of a family is culpable, if he permit any vices
among his domestics, which he might restrain by due
discipline, and a proper interposition. This results from
the general obligation to prevent misery, when in our
power; and the assurance we have, that vice and misery,
at the long run, go together. Care to maintain in his
family a sense of virtue and religion, received the di∣vine
approbation in the person of ABRAHAM, <HI>Gen.</HI> xviii,
19, “I know him, that he will command his children,
and <HI>his household,</HI> after him; and they shall keep the
way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment.” And
indeed no authority seems so well adapted to this purpose,
as that of masters of families; because none operates upon
<PB N="143" REF="179"/>
the subjects of it, with an influence so immediate and con∣stant.</P>
<P>What the Christian Scriptures Have delivered concern∣ing
the relation and reciprocal duties of masters and ser∣vants,
breathes a spirit of liberality, very little known in
ages when servitude was slavery; and which flowed from
a habit of contemplating mankind under the common re∣lation
in which they stand to their Creator, and with re∣spect
to their interest in another existence."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 5—9.</NOTE> “Servants
be obedient to them that are your masters, according to
the flesh, with fear and trembling; in singleness of
your heart, as unto Christ; not with eye service, as
men pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the
will of God from the heart; <HI>with good will, doing service
as to the Lord and ot to men:</HI> knowing that whatsoever
good thing any man doth, the same shall he receive of
the LORD, whether he be bond or free. And ye mas∣ters
do the same thing, unto them, forbearing threat∣ening
knowing that your master also is in heaven;
neither is there respect of persons with him.” The
idea of referring their service to God, of considering <HI>him</HI>
as having, appointed them, their task, that they were do∣ing
<HI>his</HI> will, and were to look to <HI>him</HI> for their reward, was
new, and affords a greater security to the master than any
inferior principle; because it tends to produce a steady
and cordial obedience in the place of that constrained ser∣vice,
which can never be trusted out of sight, and which
<PB N="144" REF="180"/>
is justly enough called eye service. The exhortation to
masters, to keep in. view their own subjection. and ac∣countableness,
was no loss seasonable.</P>

<P>WHOEVER undertakes another man's business, makes
it his own, that is, promises to employ upon
it the same care, attention, and diligence, that he would
do if it were actually his own; for he knows that the bu∣siness
was committed to him with that expectation. And
he promises no more than this; therefore an agent is not
obliged to wait, enquire, solicit, ride about the country,
toil, or study, whilst there remains a possibility of bene∣fiting
his employer. If he exert so much of his activity,
and use such caution, as the value of the business, in his
judgment, deserves; that is, as he would have thought
sufficient, if the same interest of his own had been at
stake, he has discharged his duty, although it should af∣terwards
turn out, that by more activity, and longer per∣severance,
he might have concluded the business with
greater advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="181"/>
This rule defines the duty of factors, stewards, attor∣nies,
advocates.</P>
<P>One of the chief difficulties of an agent's situation is,
to know how far he may depart from his instructions,
when he sees reason to believe, from some change or dis∣covery
in the circumstances of his commission, that his
employer, if he were present, would alter his intention.
The latitude allowed to agents in this respect, will be dif∣ferent,
according as the commission was confidential or
ministerial; and according as the general rule and nature
of the service require a prompt and precise obedience to
orders or not. An attorney sent to treat for an estate, if he
found out a flaw in the title, would defist from proposing the
price he was directed to propose; and very properly. On
the other hand, if the commander in chief of an army
detach an officer under him upon a particular service,
which service turns out more difficult, or less expedient, than was supposed; in so much that the officer is con∣vinced
that his commander, if he were acquainted with
the true state in which the affair is found, would recall
his orders; yet, if he cannot wait for fresh directions,
without prejudice to the expedition he is sent upon, he
must at all hazards pursue those which he brought out
with him.</P>
<P>What is trusted to an agent, may be lost or damaged in
his hands by misfortune. An agent who acts without pay,
is clearly not answerable for the loss; for, if he give
<PB N="144" REF="182"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="145" REF="183"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="146" REF="184"/>
labour for nothing, it cannot be presumed, that he gave
also security for the success of it. If the agent be hired
to the business, the question will depend upon the appre∣hension
of the parties at the time of making the contract;
which apprehension of theirs must be collected chiefly from
custom, by which probably it was guided. Whether a
public carrier ought to account for goods sent by him—the
owner or master of a ship for the cargo—the post-office for
letters, or bills inclosed in letters, where the loss is not
imputed to any fault or neglect of theirs; are questions of
this sort. Any expression, which, by implication, amounts
to a promise, will be binding upon the agent, without
custom; as where the proprietors of a stage-coach adver∣tise,
that they will not be accountable for money, plate,
or jewels; this makes them accountable for every thing
else: or, where the price is too much for the labour, part
of it may be considered as a premium for insurance. On
the other hand, any caution on the part of the owner, to
guard against danger, is evidence, that he considers the
risk to be his; as cutting a bank bill in two, to send by
the post at different times.</P>
<P>Universally, unless <HI>a promise,</HI> either exprese or tacit, can
be proved against the agent, the loss must fall upon the
owner.</P>
<P>The agent may be a sufferer in his own person or pro∣perty,
by the business he undertakes; as where one goes
a journey for another, and hurts himself, or lames his horse,
<PB N="147" REF="185"/>
by a fall upon the road; but, unless the same be provided
for by express stipulation, the agent is not entitled to any
compensation from his employer on that account; for
where the danger is not foreseen, there can be no reason
to believe, that the employer engaged to indemnify the
agent against it; much less, where it is foreseen; for
whoever knowingly undertakes a dangerous employment,
in common construction, takes upon himself the danger
and the consequences; as where a fireman undertakes for
a reward, to rescue a box of writings from the flames;
or a sailor to bring off a passenger from a ship in a storm.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts of Labour.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Partnership.</HEAD>
<P>I Know of nothing upon this subject, that requires ex∣planation,
but how the profits are to be divided,
where one partner contributes money, and the other la∣bour;
which is a common case.</P>
<P><HI>Rule.</HI> From the stock of the partnership deduct the sum
advanced, and divide the remainder between the monied
partner and the labouring partner, in the proportion of
<PB N="148" REF="186"/>
the interest of the money, to the wages of the labour;
allowing such a rate of interest, as money might be bor∣rowed
for, upon the same security, and such wages as a
journeyman would require for the same labour and trust.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI> A advances a thousand pounds, but knows no∣thing
of the business; B produces no money, but has been
brought up to the business and undertakes to conduct it.
At the end of the year, the stock and effects of the partner∣ship
amount to twelve hundred pounds; consequently there
are two hundred pounds to divide. Now no body would
lend money upon the event of the business succeeding,
which is A's security, under six per cent.—therefore A must
be allowed sixty pounds for the interest of his money: B,
before he engaged in the partnership, earned thirty pounds
a year in the same employment; his labour, therefore,
ought to be valued at thirty pounds: and the two hundred
pounds must be divided between the partners, in the pro∣portion
of sixty to thirty, that is, A must receive one hun∣dred
and thirty-three pounds six shillings and eight pence,
and B sixty-six pounds thirteen shillings and four pence.</P>
<P>If there be nothing gained, A loses his interest, and B
his labour, which is right. If the original stock be dimi∣nished,
by this rule B loses only his labour, as before;
whereas A loses his interest, and part of the principal: for
which eventual disadvantage, A is compensated, by having
the interest of his money computed at six per cent, in the
division of the profit, when there is any.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="187"/>
It is true, that the division of the profit is seldom forgot∣ten
in the constitution of the partnership; and is therefore
commonly settled by express agreement: but these agree∣ments,
to be equitable, should pursue the principle of the
rule here laid down.</P>
<P>All the partners are bound, by what any one of them
does in the course of the business; for, <HI>quoad hoc,</HI> each
partner is considered as an authorised agent for the rest.</P>
</DIV4>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Contracts of Labour.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Offices.</HEAD>
<P>IN many offices, as schools, fellowships of colleges, pro∣fessorships
in the universities, and the like, there is a two∣fold
contract, one with the founder, the other with the
electors.</P>
<P>The contract with the founder obliges the incumbent of
the office, to discharge every duty appointed by the charter,
statutes, deed of gift, or will of the founder; because the
endowment was given, and consequently accepted for that
purpose, and upon these conditions.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="188"/>
The contract with the electors extends this obligation, to
all duties, that have been customarily connected with, and
reckoned a part of the office, though not prescribed by the
founder; for the electors expect from the person they
choose, all the duties which his predcessors have dis∣charged;
and, as the person elected cannot be ignorant of
their expectation, if he means to refuse this condition, he
ought to apprise them of his objection.</P>
<P>And here let it be observed, that the leave of the elec∣tors
is, in conscience, an excuse from this last class of du∣ties
only; because they result from a contract, to which the
electors, and the person-elected, are the only parties. The
other class of duties result from a different contract.</P>
<P>It is a question of some magnitude and difficulty, what
offices may be conscientiously supplied by deputy.</P>
<P>We will state the several objections to the substitution of
a deputy; and then it will be understood that a deputy
may be allowed in all cases, to which these objections do
not apply.</P>
<P>An office may <HI>not</HI> be discharged by deputy,</P>
<P>1. Where a particular confidence is reposed, in the per∣son
appointed to it; as the office of a steward, guardian,
judge, commander in chief, by land or sea.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="189"/>
2. Where the custom hinders; as in the case of school∣masters,
tutors, and of commissions in the army and navy.</P>
<P>3. Where the duty cannot, from it's nature, be so well
performed by a deputy; as the deputy governor of a pro∣vince
may not possess the legal authority, or the actual
influence, of his principal.</P>
<P>4. When some inconveniency would result, to the ser∣vice
in general, from the permission of deputies in such
cases: for example, it is probable, that military merit would
be much discouraged, if the duties belonging to commis∣sions
in the army, were generally allowed to be executed
by substitutes.</P>
<P>The non-residence of the parochial clergy, who supply
the duty of their benefices by curates, is worthy of a more
distinct consideration. And, in order to draw the question
upon this case, to a point, we will suppose the officiating
curate, to discharge every duty, which his principal, were
he present, would be bound to discharge, and in a manner
equally beneficial to the parish; under which circum∣stances,
the only objection to the absence of the principal,
at least, the only one of the foregoing objections is the
last.</P>
<P>And, in my judgment, the force of this objection will
be much diminished, if the absent rector or vicar be, in the
<PB N="152" REF="190"/>
meantime, engaged in any function or employment, of
equal importance to the general interest of religion, or of
greater. For the whole revenue of the national church
may properly enough be considered as a common fund, for
the support of the national religion; and, if a clergyman
be serving the cause of christianity and protestantism, it can
make little difference, out of what particular portion of this
fund, that is, by the tythes and glebe of what particular
parish his service be requited; any more than it can pre∣judice
the king's service, that an officer who has signalized
his merit in America, should be rewarded with the govern∣ment
of a fort or castle in Ireland, which he never saw;
but for the custody of which proper provision is made, and care taken.</P>
<P>Upon the principle thus explained, this indulgence is
due to none more than to those who are occupied in culti∣vating,
or communicating religious knowledge, or the sci∣ences
subsidiary to religion.</P>
<P>This way of considering the revenues of the church,
as a common fund for the same purpose, is the more equi∣table,
as the value of particular preferments bears no pro∣portion
to the particular charge or labour.</P>
<P>But when a man draws upon this fund, whose studies
and employments bear no relation to the object of it; and
who is no farther a minister of the christian religion, than
<PB N="153" REF="191"/>
as a cockade makes a soldier, it seems a misapplication, lit∣tle
better than robbery.</P>
<P>And to those who have the management of such matters,
I submit this question, whether the impoverishing of the
fund, by converting the best share of it into <HI>annuities</HI> for the
gay and illiterate youth of great families, threatens not to
starve and stifle the little clerical merit that is left amongst
us?</P>
<P>All legal dispensations from residence, proceed upon the
supposition, that the absentee is detained from his living,
by some engagement of equal or of greater public impor∣tance.
Therefore, if in a case, where no such reason can
with truth be pleaded, it be said, that this question regards
a right of property; and that all right of property awaits
the disposition of law; that if therefore, the law, which
gives a man the emoluments of a living, excuse him from residing upon it, he is excused in conscience; we answer,
that the law does not excuse him by <HI>intention,</HI> and that all
other excuses are fraudulent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lies.</HEAD>
<P>ALIE is a breach of promise; for whoever seriously
addresses his discourse to another, tacitly promises to
speak the truth, because he knows that the truth is ex∣pected.</P>
<P>Or the obligation of veracity may be made out, from the
direct ill consequences of lying to social happiness. Which
consequences consist, either in some specific injury to parti∣cular
individuals, or in the destruction of that confidence,
which is essential to the intercourse of human life: for
which latter reason, a lie may be pernicious in it's general
tendency, and therefore criminal, though it produce no
particular or visible mischief to any one.</P>
<P>There are falshoods which are not lies; that is, which
are not criminal, as,</P>
<P>1. Where no one is deceived; which is the case in pa∣rables,
fables, novels, jests, tales to create mirth, ludicrous
embellishments of a story, where the declared design of the
speaker is not to inform, but to divert, compliments in the
<PB N="155" REF="193"/>
subscription of a letter, a servant's <HI>denying</HI> his master, a
prisoner's pleading not guilty, an advocate asserting the
justice, or his belief of the justice of his client's cause. In
such instances, no confidence is destroyed, because none was
reposed; no promise to speak the truth is violated, because
none was given, or understood to be given.</P>
<P>2. Where the person you speak to has no right to know
the truth, or more properly, where little or no inconvenience
results from the want of confidence; in such cases, as
where you tell a falshood to a child, or a madman, for their
own advantage; to a robber, to conceal your property; to
an assassin, to defeat, or to divert him from his purpose.
The particular consequence is by the supposition beneficial;
and, as to the general consequence, the worst that can hap∣pen
is, that the child, the madman, the robber, the assas∣sin,
will trust you no more; which (besides, that the two
first are incapable of deducing regular conclusions, from
having been once deceived, and the two last not likely to
come a second time in your way) is sufficiently compen∣sated,
by the immediate, benefit which you propose by the
falsehood.</P>
<P>It is upon this principle, that, by the laws of war, it is
allowed, to deceive an enemy by feints, false colours, spies,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There have been two or three instances of late, of English ships decoying the enemy into their power, by counterfeiting signals of distress; an artifice, which ought to be reprobated by the common indignation of mankind: for for a few examples, of captures effected by this stratagem, would put an end to that promptitude, in affording assistance to ships in distress, which is the best virtue in a seafaring character, and by which the perils of navigation are diminished to all.</NOTE>
<PB N="156" REF="194"/>
false intelligence, and the like; but, by no means, in trea∣ties,
truces, signals of capitulation, or surrender: and the
difference is, that the former suppose hostilities to conti∣nue,
the latter are calculated to terminate or suspend them.
In the conduct of war, and whilst the war continues, there
is no use, or rather no place for confidence, betwixt the
contending parties; but in whatever relates to the termi∣nation
of war, the most religious sidelity is expected, be∣cause
without it wars could not cease, nor the victors be
secure, but by the entire distruction of the vanquished.</P>
<P>Many people indulge in serious discourse a habit of
fiction and exaggeration, in the accounts they give of
themselves, of their acquaintance, or of the extraordinary
things which they have seen or heard; and so long as the
facts they relate are indifferent, and their narratives, tho' false, are inoffensive, it may seem a superstitious regard to
truth, to censure them merely for truth's sake.</P>
<P>In the first place, it is almost impossible to pronounce be∣forehand,
with certainty, concerning any lie, that it is in∣offensive. <HI>Volat irrevocable;</HI> and collects oft-times accretions
in it's flight, which entirely change it's nature. It may
owe possibly it's mischief to the officiousness or misrepre∣sentation
of those who circulate it; but the mischief is
<PB N="157" REF="195"/>
nevertheless, in some degree, chargeable upon the origin∣nal
editor.</P>
<P>In the next place, this liberty in conversation defeats it's
own end. Much of the pleasure, and all the benefit of
conversation, depends upon our opinion of the speaker's
veracity; for which this rule leaves no foundation. The
faith indeed of a hearer must be extremely perplexed,
who considers the speaker, or believes that the speaker con∣siders
himself as under no obligation to adhere to truth,
but according to the particular importance of what he re∣lates.</P>
<P>But besides and above both these reasons, <HI>white</HI> lies al∣ways
introduce others of a darker complexion. I have
seldom known any one who deserted truth in trifles, that
could be trusted in matters of importance. Nice distinc∣tions
are out of the question, upon occasions, which, like
those of speech, return every hour. The habit therefore,
when once formed, is easily extended to serve the designs
of malice or interest, and like all habits, it spreads indeed
of itself.</P>
<P><HI>Pious</HI> frauds, as they are improperly enough called, pre∣tended
inspirations, forged books, counterfeit miracles,
are impositions of a more serious nature. It is possible,
they may sometimes, though seldom, have been set up and
encouraged, with a design to do good; but the good they
aim at, requires that the belief of them should be perpe∣tual;
<PB N="158" REF="196"/>
which is hardly possible; and the detection of
the fraud, is sure to disparage the credit of all pretensions
of the same nature. Christianity has suffered more injury
from this cause, than from all other causes put toge∣ther.</P>
<P>As there may be falsehoods, which are not lies, so there
may be lies, without literal or direct falsehood; as when
the literal and grammatical signification of a sentence is
different from the popular and customary sense of it. It is
the wilful deceit that makes the lie; and we wilfully de∣ceive,
when our expressions are not true, in the sense in
which we believe the hearer apprehends them. Besides, it
is absurd to contend for any sense of words, in opposition
to usage, for all senses of all words are founded upon usage,
and nothing else.</P>
<P>Or a man may <HI>act</HI> a lie; as by pointing his singer in a
wrong direction, when a traveller enquires of him his way;
or when a tradesman shuts up his windows, to induce his
creditors to believe that he is abroad; for to all moral pur∣poses,
and therefore as to veracity, speech and action are
the same; speech being only a mode of action.</P>
<P>Or lastly, there may be lies of <HI>omission.</HI> A writer of
<HI>English</HI> history, who, in his account of the reign of <HI>Charles</HI>
the first, wilfully suppresses any evidence of that prince's
despotic measures and designs, <HI>lies;</HI> for, by entitling his
book a <HI>history of England,</HI> he engages to relate the whole
truth of the history, or at least, all he knows of it.</P>

<ITEM>IV. Obligation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. What oaths do not bind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. In what sense oaths are to be interpreted.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. The forms of oaths, like other religious ceremonies,
have been always very various; but consisting for the most
part, of some bodily action (from which they are called
corporal oaths) and of a prescribed form of words. Amongst
the <HI>Jews;</HI> the juror held up his right-hand towards hea∣ven,
which explains a passage in the cxlivth Psalm, “whose
mouth speaketh vanity, and <HI>their right-hand is a right-hand
of falsehood.”</HI> The same form is retained in <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
still. An oath of fidelity was taken, by the servant's
putting his hand under the thigh of his lord, as <HI>Eliezer</HI> did
<PB N="160" REF="198"/>
to <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> xxiv. 2. from whence, with no great va∣riation,
is derived perhaps the form of doing homage at
this day, by putting the hands between the knees, and
within the hands of the liege.</P>
<P>Amongst the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> the form differed with
the subject and occasion of the oath. In private contracts,
the parties took hold of each other's hand, whilst they
swore to the performance; or they touched the altar of the
God, by whose divinity they swore. Upon more solemn
occasions, it was the custom to slay a victim; and the
beast being <HI>struck down,</HI> with certain ceremonies and in∣vocations,
gave birth to the expressions <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, se∣rire
pactum, and to our <HI>English</HI> phrase, translated from these,
of “striking a bargain.”</P>
<P>The forms of oaths in Christian countries, are also very
different; but in none, I believe, worse contrived, either
to express or impress the meaning and obligation of an
oath, than in our own. The juror, with us, after repeat∣ing
the promise or affirmation, which the oath is intended
to confirm, adds, “so help me God:” or, more fre∣quently
the substance of the oath is repeated to the juror,
by the officer or magistrate who administers it; adding in
the conclusion, “so help you God.” The energy of the
sentence resides in the particle <HI>so; so,</HI> that is, <HI>hâc lege,</HI>
upon condition of my speaking the truth, or performing
this promise, may God help me, and not otherwise. The
juror, whilst he hears or repeats the words of the oath,
<PB N="161" REF="199"/>
holds his right-hand upon a bible, or other book, contain∣ing
the four gospels. The conclusion of the oath some∣times
runs, “ita me Deus adjuvet et haec sancta evange∣lia,”
or “so help me God, and the contents of this
book;” which last clause forms a connection between the
words and action of the juror, which, before was wanting.
The juror then kisses the book; the kiss however seems
rather an act of reverence to the contents of the book, as,
in the popish ritual, the priest kisses the gospel before he
reads it, than any part of the oath.</P>
<P>This obscure and elliptical form, together with the le∣vity
and frequency with which it is administered, has
brought about a general inadvertency to the obligation of
oaths, which, both in a religious and political view, is
much to be lamented; and it merits public consideration,
whether the requiring of oaths on so many frivolous oc∣casions,
especially in the customs, and in the qualification
for petty offices, has any other effect, than to make them
cheap in the minds of the people. A pound of tea cannot
travel regularly from the ship to the consumer, without
costing half a dozen oaths at the least; and the same secu∣rity
for the due discharge of their office, namely that of
an oath, is required from a churchwarden and an arch∣bishop,
from a petty constable and the chief justice of
<HI>England.</HI> Let the law continue it's own sanctions, if they
be thought necessary; but let it spare the solemnity of an
oath. And where it is necessary to accept men's own word
or account, for want of any thing better to depend upon,
<PB N="162" REF="200"/>
let it annex to prevarication penalties proportioned to the
public consequence of the offence.</P>
<P>II. But whatever be the form of an oath, the <HI>fignification</HI> is
the same. It is “the calling upon God to witness, <HI>i. e.</HI>
to take notice of what we say, and invoking his vengeance,
or renouncing his favor, if what we say be false, or what
we promise be not performed.”</P>
<P>III. Quakers and Moravians refuse to swear upon any oc∣casion;
founding their scruples concerning the <HI>lawfulness</HI>
of oaths, upon our Saviour's prohibition, <HI>Matth.</HI> v. 34.
“I say unto you, swear not at all.”</P>
<P>The answer which we give to this objection, cannot be
understood, without first stating the whole passage; “Ye
have heard, that it hath been said by them of old time,
thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto
the Lord thine oaths; but I say unto you, swear not
at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor
by the earth, for it is his footstool; neither by <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI>
for it is the city of the great King; neither shalt
thou swear by thy head, because thou can'st not make
one hair white or black: but let your communication
be yea yea, nay nay, for whatsoever is more than these
cometh of evil.”</P>
<P>To reconcile with this passage of scripture, the prac∣tice
of swearing, or taking oaths, when required by law,
the following observations must be attended to.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="201"/>
1. It does not appear, that swearing “by heaven,” “by the earth,” “by <HI>Jerusalem,”</HI> or “by their own head,” was
a form of swearing ever made use of amongst the <HI>Jews,</HI> in
judicial oaths: and consequently it is not probable that
they were judicial oaths, which Christ had in his mind
when he mentioned those instances.</P>
<P>2. As to the seeming universality of the prohibition,
“swear not at all,” the emphatic clause “not at all,” is
to be read in connection with what follows; “not at all”
<HI>“h. e.</HI> neither by the heaven,” nor “by the earth,” nor
by “<HI>Jerusalem,”</HI> nor by thy “head:” “not at all” does
not mean upon no occasion, but by none of these forms.</P>
<P>3. Our Saviour's argument seems to suppose, that the
people, to whom he spake, made a distinction between
swearing directly by the “name of God,” and swearing by
those inferior objects of veneration, “the heavens,” “the earth,” “<HI>Jeruselam,”</HI> “or their own head.” In op∣posstion
to which distinction, he tells them, that, on ac∣count
of the relation which these things bore to the su∣preme
being, to swear by any of them, was in effect and
substance to swear by <HI>him;</HI> “by heaven, for it is his
throne; by the earth, for it is his footstool; by <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI>
for it is the city of the great King; by thy head,”
for it is <HI>his</HI> workmanship, not thine, “thou can'st not
make one hair white or black:” for which reason, he says,
“swear not at all,” that is, neither directly by God, nor
indirectly by any thing related to him. This interpreta∣tion
<PB N="164" REF="202"/>
is greatly confirmed, by a passage in the twenty-third
chapter of the same gospel, where a similar distinction,
made by the Scribes and Pharisees, is replied to in the same
manner.</P>
<P>4. Our Saviour himself being “adjured by the living
God,” to declare whether he was the Christ, the son of
God, or not, condescended to answer the high priest, without
making any objection to the oath, (for such it was) upon
which he examined him. <HI>“God is my witness,”</HI> says St.
<HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> “that without ceasing, I make men∣tion
of you in my prayers:” and to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> still
more strongly, “<HI>I call God for a record upon my soul,</HI> that,
to spare you, I came not as yet to <HI>Corinth.</HI>” Both these
expressions contain the nature of oaths. The epistle to the
<HI>Hebrews</HI> speaks of the custom of swearing judicially, with∣out
any mark of censure or disapprobation, "men verily
swear by the greater, and an oath, for confirmation, is,
to them, an end of all strife.</P>
<P>Upon the strength of these reasons, we explain our Sa∣viour's
words to relate, not to judicial oaths, but to the
practice of vain, wanton, and unauthorìsed swearing, in
common discourse. St. <HI>James's</HI> words, chap. v. 12, are
not so strong as our Saviour's, and therefore admit the same
explanation with more ease.</P>
<P>VI. Oaths are nugatory, that is, carry with them no
<HI>proper</HI> force or <HI>obligation,</HI> unless we believe, that God will
<PB N="165" REF="203"/>
punish false swearing, with, more severity than a simple
lie, or breach of promise; for which belief there are the
following reasons:</P>
<P>1. Perjury is a sin of greater deliberation. The Juror
has, I believe, in fact, the thoughts of God, and of reli∣gion,
upon his mind, at the time; at least there are very
few who can shake them off entirely. He offends therefore,
if he do offend, with a high hand, in the face, that
is, and in defiance of the sanctions of religion. His offence
implies a disbelief, or contempt of God's knowledge, power,
and justice, which cannot be said of a lie, where there is
nothing to carry the mind to any reflection upon the Deity,
or the divine attributes at all.</P>
<P>2. Perjury violates a superior confidence. Mankind must
trust to one another; and they have nothing better to trust
to than one another's oath. Hence legal adjudications,
which govern and affect every right and interest on this
side the grave, of necessity proceed, and depend upon oaths.
Perjury, therefore, in it's general consequence, strikes at the
security of reputation, property, and even of life itself. A
lie cannot do the same mischief, because the same credit is
not given to it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Except indeed, where a Quakers or Moravian's affirmation is accepted in the place of an oath; in which case, a lie partakes, so far as this reason ex∣tends, of the nature and guilt of perjury.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="204"/>
3. God directed the <HI>Israelites</HI> to swear by his name;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. vi. 13. x. 20.</NOTE>
and was pleased, “in order to show the immutability of
his own council,”<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 17.</NOTE> to confirm his covenant, with that
people, by an oath. Neither of which it is probable he
would have done, had he not intended to represent oaths,
as having some meaning and effect, beyond the obligation
of a bare, promise; which effect must be owing to the se∣verer
punishment, with which he will vindicate the autho∣rity
of oaths.</P>
<P>V. Promissory oaths are <HI>not binding,</HI> where the promise
itself would not be so: for the several cases of which, see
the chapter of promises.</P>
<P>VI. As oaths are designed for the securiiy of the imposer,
it is manifest they must be performed, and <HI>interpreted,</HI> in the
sense in which the imposer intends them; otherwise, they
afford no security to <HI>him.</HI> And this is the meaning and
reason of the rule, “jurare in animum imponentis;” which rule,
the reader is desired to carry along with him, whilst we
proceed to consider certain particular oaths, which are,
either of greater importance, or more likely to fall in our
way than others.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Oath in Evidence.</HEAD>
<P>THE witness swears, “to speak the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, touching the
matter in question.”</P>
<P>Upon which it may be observed, that the designed con∣cealment
of any truth, which relates to the matter in agi∣tation,
is as much a violation of the oath, as to testify a po∣sitive
falsehood; and this, whether he be interrogated to
that particular point or not. For when a witness is sworn
upon a voir dire, that is, in order to enquire, whether he
ought to be admitted to give evidence in the cause at all, the
form runs thus, "you shall true answer make to all such
“questions as shall be asked you;” but, when he comes to
be sworn in chief, he swears, “to speak the whole truth,”
without restraining it, as before, to the questions that
shall be asked: which difference shews, that the law intends, in
this latter case, to require of the witness, that he give a
complete, and unreserved account of what he knows of the
subject of the trial, whether the questions proposed to him,
reach the extent of his knowledge or not. So that if it be
enquired of the witness afterwards, why he did not inform
the court so and so, it is no sufficient, though a very com∣mon
answer to say, because it was never asked me.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="206"/>
I know of but one exception to this rule; which is,
when a full discovery of the truth tends to accuse the wit∣ness
himself of some legal crime. The law of <HI>England</HI>
constrains no man to accuse himself; consequently imposes
the oath of testimony with this tacit reservation. But the
exception must be confined to <HI>legal</HI> crimes. A point of
honour, of delicacy, or of reputation, may make a wit∣ness
backward to disclose some circumstance, which he is
acquainted with; but is no excuse for concealment, unless
it could be shewn, that the law which imposes the oath,
intended to allow this indulgence to such motives. The
exception is also withdrawn by compact between the ma∣gistrate
and the witness, when an accomplice is admitted
to give evidence against the partners of his crime.</P>
<P>Tenderness to the prisoner, is a specious apology for
concealment, but no just excuse; for if this plea be
thought sufficient, it takes the administration of penal
justice out of the hands of judges and juries, and makes
it depend upon the temper of prosecutors and witnesses.</P>
<P>Questions may be asked which are irrelative to the cause,
which affect the witness himself, or some third person;
in which, and in all cases, where the witness doubts of the perti∣nency
and propriety of the question, he ought to refer
his doubts to the court. The answer of the court, in re∣laxation
of the oath, is authority enough to the witness;
for the law which imposes the oath, may remit what it
will of the obligation; and it belongs to the court to de∣clare
<PB N="169" REF="207"/>
clare what the mind of the law is. Nevertheless it cannot
be said universally, that the answer of the court is con∣clusive
upon the conscience of the witness; for his obliga∣tion
depends upon what he apprehended, at the time of
taking the oath, to be the design of the law in im∣posing
it; and no after requisition or explanation by the
court, can carry the obligation beyond that.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Oath of Allegiance.</HEAD>
<P>“I DO sincerely promise, and swear, that I will be
faithful and bear true allegiance to his Majesty
King GEORGE.” Formerly the oath of allegiance ran
thus: “I do promise to be true and faithful to the King
and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear, of life, and
limb, and terrene honour; and not to know or hear of
any ill or damage intended him, without defending him
therefrom:” and was altered at the Revolution to the
present form. So that the present oath is a relaxation of
the old one. And as the oath was intended to ascertain,
not so much the extent of the subject's obedience, as to
whom it was due, the legislature seems to have wrapped up
it's meaning upon the former point, in a word purposely
made choice of for it's general and indeterminate
significa∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="208"/>
It will be most convenient to consider, first, what the
cath excludes, as inconsistent with it; secondly, what it
permits.</P>
<P>1. The oath excludes all intention to support the claim
or pretensions of any other person or persons, than the
reigning sovereign, to the crown and government. A <HI>Ja∣cobite,</HI>
who is persuaded of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s right to the
crown, and moreover designs to join with the adherents
of that cause, to assert this right, whenever a proper
opportunity, with a reasonable prospect of success, pre∣sents
itself, cannot take the oath of allegiance; or,
if he could, the path of abjuration follows, which
contains an express renunciation of all opinions in favour
of the claim of the exiled family. An inhabitant of
<HI>North America,</HI> who means to maintain the new erect∣ed
governments there, cannot take the oath of alle∣giance.</P>
<P>2. The oath excludes all design, at the time, of attempt∣ing
to depose the reigning prince, for any reason whatever.
Let the justice of the Revolution be what it would, no ho∣nest
man could have taken even the present path of alle∣giance
to <HI>James the second,</HI> who entertained at the time of
taking it, a design of joining in the measures that were
entered into to dethrone him.</P>
<P>3. The oath forbids the taking up arms against the
reigning prince, with views of private advancement, or
<PB N="171" REF="209"/>
from motives of personal resentment or dislike. It might
happen, in this, what frequently happens in despotic go∣vernments,
that an ambitious general, at the head of the
military force of the nation, by a conjuncture of fortunate
circumstances, and a great ascendency over the minds of
the soldiery, might depose the prince upon the throne,
and make way to it for himself, or some creature of his
own. A person in this, situation would be withheld from
such an attempt by the oath of allegiance, if he paid any
regard to it. If there were any who engaged in the rebellion
of the year forty-five, with the expectation of titles, estates,
or preferment; or because they were disappointed, and
thought themselves neglected and ill used at court; or be∣cause
they; entertained a family animosity, or personal re∣sentment
against the king, the favourite, or the minister;
if any were induced to take up arms by these motives,
they added to the many crimes of an unprovoked rebellion,
that of wilful and corrupt perjury. If the same motives
determined others now, to connect themselves with the
American opposition; their part in it is chargeable with
perfidy and falsehood to their oath, whatever be the fate
or justice of the opposition itself, or however well founded
their complaints may be of private injuries.</P>
<P>We are next to consider what the oath of allegiance per∣mits,
or does not require.</P>
<P>1. It permits resistance to the king, when his ill be∣haviour,
or imhecillity is such, as to make resistance
<PB N="172" REF="210"/>
beneficial to the community. It may fairly be presumed,
that the convention Parliament, which introduced the oath in
it's present form, did not mean, by imposing it, to exclude
all resistance; since the members of that legislature had
many of them, recently taken up arms against <HI>James the
second;</HI> and the very authority by which they sat together,
was itself the effect of a successful opposition, to an acknow∣ledged
sovereign; and if any resistance be allowed it must
be that which has the public interest for it's object.</P>
<P>2. The oath does not require obedience to such com∣mands
of the king, as are unauthorised by law. No such
obedience is implied by the terms of the oath; the <HI>fidelity</HI>
there promised, is intended of fidelity in opposition to his
enemies, and not in opposition to law; and <HI>allegiance,</HI> at
the utmost, only signifies obedience to lawful commands.
Therefore if the king should issue a proclamation, levying
money, or imposing any service or restraint upon the sub∣ject,
beyond what the crown is impowered by law to en∣join,
there would exist no sort of obligation to obey such a
proclamation, in consequence of having taken the oath of
allegiance.</P>
<P>3. The oath does not require that we sould continue
our allegiance to the king, after he is actually and absolute∣ly
deposed, driven into exile, carried away captive, or
otherwise rendered incapable of exercising the regal
office. The promise of allegiance implies, and is under∣stood
by all parties to suppose, that the person to whom the
<PB N="173" REF="211"/>
promise is made, continues king; continues, that is, to
exercise the power, and afford the protection, which be∣longs
to the office of king: for it is the possession of this
power, which makes such a particular person the object of
the oath; without it, why should I swear allegiance to this
man, rather than to any other man in the kingdom? Be∣sides,
the contrary doctrine is burthened with this conse∣sequence,
that every conquest, revolution of government,
or disaster, which befalls the person of the prince, must
be followed by public and perpetual anarchy.</P>

purchase the gift of the holy Ghost, <HI>Acts</HI> viii. 19. the
obtaining of a presentation by pecuniary considerations, has
been called <HI>Simony.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="213"/>
The sale of advowsons is inseparable from the right of
private patronage; as patronage would otherwise devolve
to the most indigent, and for that reason, the most impro∣per
hands it could be placed in. Nor did the law ever intend
to prohibit the sale of ad vowsons from one patron to another;
but to restrain the patron, who possesses the right of pre∣senting
at the vacancy, from being influenced, in the choice
of his presentee, by a bribe, of benefit to himself. It is
the same distinction with that which obtains in a free∣holders
vote for his representative in parliament. The right
of voting, that is the freehold, to which the right pertains,
may be bought and sold, as freely as any other property;
but the exercise of that right, the vote itself, may not be
purchased, or influenced by money.</P>
<P>For this purpose, the law imposes upon the presentee,
who is generally concerned in the simony, if there be any,
the following oath: “I do swear, that I have made no
<HI>simoniacal</HI> payment, contract, or promise, directly or in∣directly,
by myself, or by any other to my knowledge,
or with my consent, to any person or persons whatso∣ever,
for or concerning the procuring and obtaining of
this ecclesiastical place, &amp;c. nor will, at any time here-after,
perform, or satisfy, any such kind of payment,
contract, or promise, made by any other without my
knowledge or consent: So help me God, through Jesus
Christ.”</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="214"/>
It is extraordinary, that bishop <HI>Gibson</HI> should have thought
this oath against all promises whatsoever, when the terms
of the oath expressly restrain it to <HI>simoniacal</HI> promises; and
the law must pronounce what promises, as well as what
payments, and contracts, are simoniacal, and consequently
come within the oath; and what are not so.</P>
<P>Now the law<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adjudges to be simony,</P>
<P>1. All payments, contracts, or promises, made by any
person, for a benefice already vacant. The advowson of a
void turn, by law cannot be transferred from one patron to
another; therefore if the void turn be procured by money,
it mush be by a pecuniary influence upon the then subsisting
patron in the choice of his presentee; which is the very
practice the law condemns.</P>
<P>2. A clergyman's purchasing of the next turn of a bene∣fice
for himself, “directly or indiredtly,” that is, by him∣self,
or by another person with his money. It does not
appear, that the law prohibits a clergyman, from perchasing
the perpetuity of a patronage, more than any other
person; but purchasing the perpetuity, and forthwith sel∣ling
it again, with a reservation of the next turn, and with
no other design than to possess himself of the next turn, is
in <HI>fraudem legis,</HI> and inconsistent with the oath.</P>
<P>3. The procuring of a piece of preferment, by ceding to
the patron, any rights, or probable rights, belonging to it.
<PB N="177" REF="215"/>
This is simony of the worst kind; for it is not only buying
preferment, but robbing your successor to pay for it.</P>
<P>4. Promises to the patron of a portion of the profit, re∣mission
of tythes and dues, or other advantage out of the
produce of the benefice; which is a pernicious condescen∣sion
in the clergy, independent of the oath, for it tends to in∣troduce
a practice, which may very soon become general, of
giving the revenues of churches to the lay patrons, and
supplying the duty by indigent stipendaries.</P>
<P>5. General bonds of resignatìon (that is, bonds to resign
upon demand) when intended to secure any of the above-mentioned
purposes; to which use they may always be con∣verted.</P>
<P>I doubt not but that the oath is binding upon the con∣sciences
of those who take it, though I question much the
expediency of requiring it. It is very fit to debar public
patrons, such as the king, the lord chancellor, bishops,
ecclesiastical corporations, and the like, from this kind of
traffic; because, from them may be expected some regard
to the qualifications of the persons they promote. But the
oath lays a snare for the integrity of the clergy; and I do
not perceive, that the requiring of it, in cases of private
patronage, produces any good effect, sufficient to compensate
for this danger.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="216"/>
Where advowsons are held along with manors, or other
principal estates, it would be an easy regulation to forbid
that they should ever hereafter be separated; and would, at
least, keep church preferment out of the hands of brokers.</P>

<P>To bring a case within this rule, the <HI>inconveniency</HI> must,</P>
<P>1. Be manifest; concerning which there is no doubt.</P>

so may the institution itself be, but prejudicial to the par∣ticular
end proposed by the institution; for this last cir∣cumstance
proves that the founder would have dispensed
with it in pursuance of his own purpose.</P>
<P>The statutes of some colleges forbid the speaking of any

<P>Those who contend, that nothing less can justify sub∣scription

suppose, that the legislature expected the consent of ten
thousand men, and that in perpetual succession, not to one
contraverted proposition, but to many hundreds. It is
hard to conceive how this could be expected by any, who
observed the incurable diversity of human opinion upon

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Wills.</HEAD>
<P>THE fundamental question upon this subject is, whe∣ther
Wills are of natural or of adventitious right?
that is, whether the right of directing the disposition of
property after his death, belong to a man in a state of na∣ture,
and by the law of nature, or whether it be given
him entirely by the positive regulations of the country he
lives in?</P>
<P>The immediate produce of each man's personal labour,
as the tools, weapons, and utensils, which he manufac∣tures,
the tent or hut he builds, and perhaps the flocks
and herds which he breeds and rears, are as much his own
as the labour was which he employed upon them, that
is, are his property naturally and absolutely, and conse∣quently
he may give or leave them to whom he pleases,
there being nothing to limit the continuance of his right,
or to restrain the alienation of it.</P>
<P>But every other species of property, especially property
in land, stands upon a different foundation.</P>
<P>We have seen in the Chapter upon Property, that, in a
state of nature, a man's right to a particular spot of ground
<PB N="184" REF="222"/>
arises from his using it, and wanting it; consequently
ceases with the use and want; so that at his death the estate
reverts to the community, without any regard to the last
owner's will, or even any preference to his family, farther
than as they become the first occupiers after him, and suc∣ceed
to the same want and use.</P>
<P>Moreover, as natural rights cannot, like rights created
by act of parliament, expire at the end of a certain number
of years; if the testator have a right by the law of nature,
to dispose of his property one moment after his death, he
has the same right to direct the disposition of it, for a mil∣lion
of ages after him; which is absurd.</P>
<P>The ancient apprehensions of mankind upon the subject
were conformable to this account of it; for wills have been
introduced into most countries by a positive act of the
state, as by the laws of <HI>Solon</HI> into <HI>Greece,</HI> by the twelve ta∣bles
into <HI>Rome;</HI> and that, not till after a considerable pro∣gress
had been made in legislation and the oeconomy of
civil life. <HI>Tacitus</HI> relates, that amongst the <HI>Germans</HI> they
were disallowed; and, what is more remarkable, since the
Conquest, lands in this country could not be devized by will,
till within little more than two hundred years ago, when
this privilege was restored to the subject, by an act of par∣liament
in the latter end of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth.</P>
<P>No doubt many beneficial purposes are attained by ex∣tending
the owner's power over his property, beyond his
<PB N="185" REF="223"/>
life, and beyond his natural right. It invites to industry;
it encourages marriage; it secures the dutifulness and de∣pendency
of children. But a period must be assigned to the
duration of this power. The utmost extent to which, in
any case, entails are allowed by the laws of <HI>England</HI> to ope∣rate,
is during the lives in existence at the death of the tes∣tator,
and one and twenty years beyond these: after which
there are ways and means of setting them aside.</P>
<P>From the consideration that wills are the creatures of
the municipal law which gives them their efficacy, may be
deduced a determination of the question, whether the in∣tention
of the testator in an <HI>informal</HI> will be binding
upon the conscience of those, who, by operation of law,
succeed to his estate. By an <HI>informal</HI> will, I mean a will
void in law, for want of some requisite formality,
though no doubt be entertained of it's meaning or authen∣ticity:
as suppose a man make his will, devising his
freehold estate to his sister's son, and the will be attested
by two only, instead of three subscribing witnesses; would
the brother's son, who is heir at law to the testator, be
bound in conscience, to resign his claim to the estate, out
of deference to his uncle's intention? Or, on the contrary,
would not the devisee under the will be bound, upon dis∣covery
of this flaw in it, to surrender the estate, suppose he
had gained possession of it, to the heir at law?</P>
<P>Generally speaking, the heir at law is not bound by the
intention of the testator. For the intention can signify no∣thing,
<PB N="186" REF="224"/>
unless the person intending have a right to govern
the descent of the estate. That is the first question. Now
this right the testator can only derive from the law of the
land; but the law confers the right upon certain condi∣tions,
which conditions he has not complied with. There∣fore
the testator can lay no claim to the power which he
pretends to exercise, as he hath not entitled himself to the
benefit of that law, by virtue of which alone, the estate
ought to attend his disposal. Consequently the devisee
under the will, who, by concealing this flaw in it, keeps
possession of the estate, is in the situation of any other per∣son,
who avails himself of his neighbour's ignorance, to de∣tain
from him his property. The will is so much waste
paper, from the defect of right in the person who made it.
Nor is this catching at an expression of law to pervert the
substantial design of it, for I apprehend it to be the delibe∣rate
mind of the legislature, that no will should take effect
upon real estates, unless authenticated in the precise man∣ner
which the statute describes. Had testamentary dispo∣sitions
been founded in any natural right, independant of
positive constitutions, I should have thought differently of
this question. For then I should have cousidered the law,
rather as refusing it's assistance to enfore the right of the de∣visee,
than as extinguishing, or working any alteration in
the right itself.</P>
<P>And after all, I should chuse to propose a case, where no
consideration of pity to distress, duty to a parent, or grati∣tude
<PB N="187" REF="225"/>
to a benefactor, interfered with the general rule of
justice.</P>
<P>The regard due to kindred in the disposal of our fortune,
(except the case of lineal kindred, which is different)
arises, either from the respect we owe to the presumed in∣tention
of the ancestor, from whom we received our for∣tunes,
or from the expectations we have encouraged. The
intention of the ancestor is presumed with greater certainty,
as well as entitled to more respect, the fewer degrees he is
removed from us, which makes the difference in the dif∣ferent
degrees of kindred. It may be presumed to be a fa∣ther's
intention and desire, that the inheritance he leaves,
after it has served the turn and generation of one son, should
remain a provision for the families of his other children,
equally related, and dear to him as the eldest. Whoever
therefore, without cause, gives away his patrimony from
his brother's or sister's family, is guilty not so much of an
injury to them, as of ingratitude to his parent. The de∣ference
due from the possessor of a fortune, to the presumed
desire of his ancestor, will also vary with this circumstance,
whether the ancestor earned the fortune by his personal in∣dustry,
acquired it by accidental successes, or only trans∣mitted
the inheritance which he received.</P>
<P>Where a man's fortune is acquired by himself, and he
has done nothing to excite expectation, but rather refrained
from those particular attentions which tend to cherish ex∣pectation,
he is perfectly disengaged from the force of the
<PB N="188" REF="226"/>
above reasons, and at liberty to leave his fortune to his
friends, to charitable or public purposes, or to whom he
will; the same blood, proximity of blood, and the like, are
merely modes of speech, implying nothing real, nor any
obligation of themselves.</P>
<P>There is always, however, a reason for providing for our
poor relations, in preference to others who may be equally
necessitous, which is, that if we do not, no body else will;
mankind, by an established consent, leaving the reduced
branches of good families, to the bounty of their wealthy
alliances.</P>
<P>The not making a will is a very culpable omission, where
it is attended with the following effects: where it leaves
daughters or younger children at the mercy of the eldest
son; where it distributes a personal fortune equally amongst
the children, although there be no equality in their exi∣gences
or situations; where it leaves an opening for litiga∣tion;
or lastly, and principally, where it defrauds creditors;
for by a defect in our laws, which has been long and
strangely overlooked, real estates are not subject to the pay∣ment
of debts by simple contract, unless made so by will;
although credit is in fact generally given to the possession
of such estates. He therefore, who neglects to make the
necessary appointments for the payment of his debts, as far
as his effects extend, sins, as it has been justly said in his
grave; and, if he omits this on purpose to defeat the de∣mands
<PB N="189" REF="227"/>
of his creditors, he dies with a deliberate fraud in
his heart.</P>
<P>Anciently, when any one died without a will, the bi∣shop
of the diocese took possession of his personal fortune,
in order to dispose of it for the benefit of his soul, that is,
to pious or charitable uses. It became necessary therefore,
that the bishop should be satisfied of the authenticity of the
will, when there was any, before he resigned the right
he had to take possession of the dead man's fortune, in
case of intestacy. In this way, wills, and controversies
relating to wills, came within the cognizance of ec∣clesiastical
courts; under the jurisdiction of which, wills
of personals (the only wills that were made formerly)
still continue; though, in truth, no more now-a-days
connected with religion, than any other instruments of
conveyance.</P>
<P>Succession in estates must be regulated by positive rules
of law, there being no principle of natural justice where∣by
to ascertain the proportion of the different claimants;
not to mention that the claim itself, especially of collateral
kindred, seems to have little foundation in the law of na∣ture.
These regulations should be guided by the duty and
presumed inclination of the deceased, so far as these consi∣derations
can be consulted by general rules. The statutes
of <HI>Charles</HI> the second, commonly called the statutes of dis∣tribution,
which adopt the rule of the <HI>Roman</HI> law, in the
distribution of personals, are sufficiently equitable. They
<PB N="190" REF="228"/>
assign one third to the widow, and two thirds to the chil∣dren;
in case of no children, one half to the widow, and
the other half to the next of kin; where neither widow
nor lineal descendents survive, the whole to the next of
kin, and to be equally divided amongst kindred of equal
degrees; without distinction of whole blood and half blood,
or of consanguinity by the father's or mother's side.</P>
<P>The descent of real estates, of houses, that is, and land,
having been settled in more remote and ruder times, is
less reasonable. There never can be much to complain of
in a rule, which every person may avoid by so easy a pro∣vision,
as that of making his will; otherwise our law in
this respect, is chargeable with some flagrant absurdities;
such as that an estate shall in no wise go to the brother or
sister of the half blood, though it came to the deceased
from the common parent; that it shall go to the re∣motest
relation the intestate has in the world, rather
than to his own father or mother, or even be forfeited for
want of an heir, though both parents survive; that the
most distant paternal relation shall be preferred to an uncle
or own cousin by the mother's side, notwithstanding the
estate was purchased and acquired by the intestate himself.</P>
<P>Land not being so divisible as money, may be a reason for
making a difference in the course of inheritance, but there
ought to be no difference but what is founded upon that
reason. The <HI>Roman</HI> law made none.</P>

<P>I USE the term Charity neither in the common sense
of bounty to the poor, nor in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s sense of be∣nevolence
to all mankind, but in a sense more commodious
to my purpose, I apply it for the present, to signify <HI>the
promoting the happiness of our inferiors.</HI></P>
<P>Charity in this sense, I take to be the principal province
of virtue and religion; for whilst worldly prudence will
direct our behaviour towards our superiors, and politeness
<PB N="192" REF="230"/>
towards our equals, there is little besides the consideration
of duty, or an habitual humanity, which comes into the
place of consideration, to produce a proper conduct towards
those who are beneath us, and dependent upon us.</P>
<P>There are three principal methods of promoting the
happiness of our inferiors:</P>
<P>1. By the treatment of our domestics and dependants.</P>
<P>2. By professional assistance.</P>
<P>3. By pecuniary bounty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Charity.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Treatment of our Domestics and Dependants.</HEAD>
<P>A PARTY of friends setting out together upon a
journey, soon find it to be the best for all sides, that
while they are upon the road, one of the company should
wait upon the rest; another ride forward to seek out lodg∣ing
and entertainment; a third carry the portmanteau; a
fourth take charge of the horses; a fifth bear the purse,
<PB N="193" REF="231"/>
conduct and direct the rout: not forgetting however,
that as they were equal and independant when they set out,
so they are all to return to a level again at their journey's
end. The same regard and respect; the same forbearance,
lenity, and tenderness in using their service; the same
mildness in delivering commands; the same study to make
their journey comfortable and agreeable to them, which
he, whose lot it was to direct the rest, would in common
decency think himself bound to observe towards them;
ought we to shew to those, who, in the casting of the
parts of human society, happen to be placed within our
power, or to depend upon us.</P>
<P>Another reflection of the same tendency is, that our
obligation to them is much greater than their's to us. It
is a mistake to suppose, that the rich man maintains his
servants, tradesmen, tenants, and labourers: the truth is,
they maintain him. It is their industry which supplies his
table, furnishes his wardrobe, builds his houses, adorns
his equipage, provides his amusements. It is not his
estate, but the labour employed upon it, that pays his
rent. All that he does, is to distribute what others pro∣duce;
which is the least part of the business.</P>
<P>Nor do I perceive any foundation for an opinion, which
is often handed round in genteel company, that good usage
is thrown away upon low and ordinary minds; that they
are insensible of kindness, and incapable of gratitude.
It by “low and ordinary minds” are meant the minds of
<PB N="194" REF="232"/>
men in low and ordinary stations, they seem to be affected
by benefits in the same way that all others are; and to
be no less ready to requite them: and it would be a very
odd law of nature, if it were otherwise.</P>
<P>Whatever uneasiness we occasion to our domestics, which
neither promotes our service, nor answers the just ends of
punishment, is manifestly wrong; were it only upon the
general principle of diminishing the sum of human happi∣ness.</P>
<P>By which rule we are forbidden,</P>
<P>1. To injoin unnecessary labour or confinement, from
the mere love and wantonness of domination.</P>
<P>2. To insult them by harsh, scornful, or opprobrious
language.</P>
<P>3. To refuse them any harmless pleasures.</P>
<P>And by the same principle are also forbidden causeless
or immoderate anger, habitual peevishness, and groundless
suspicion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Slavery.</HEAD>
<P>THE prohibitions of the last chapter extend to the
treatment of slaves, being founded upon a prin∣ciple
independant of the contract between masters and ser∣vants.</P>
<P>I define slavery to be “an obligation to labour for the
benefit of the master, without the contract or consent of
the servant.”</P>
<P>This obligation may arise, consistently with the law of
nature, from three causes.</P>
<P>1. From crimes.</P>
<P>2. From captivity.</P>
<P>3. From debt.</P>
<P>In the first case, the continuance of the slavery, as of
any other punishment, should be proportioned to the crime;
in the second and third cases, it should cease, as soon as
the demand of the injured nation, or private creditor, is
satisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="234"/>
When slaves are brought to market upon the coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> no questions, I believe, are asked about the origin
or justice of the vendor's title. It may be presumed there∣fore,
that this title is not always, if it be ever founded in
any of the causes above assigned.</P>
<P>But defect of right in the first purchase is the least crime,
with which this traffic is chargeable. On one side of the
<HI>Atlantic,</HI> the natives are excited to war and mutual depre∣dation,
for the sake of supplying their contracts, or fur∣nishing
the market with slaves. The slaves, thus separated
for ever from parents, wives, children, from their friends and
companions, their fields and flocks, their home and coun∣try,
are transported with no other accommodation on ship∣board,
than what is provided for brutes, to the <HI>European</HI>
settlements in <HI>America</HI>—where these unhappy exiles are
placed in subjection to a dominion and system of laws, the
most merciless and tyrannical that ever were tolerated upon
the face of the earth: and from all that can be learned by
the accounts of people upon the spot, the inordinate au∣thority,
which the plantation laws confer upon the slave-holder,
is exercised, by the <HI>English</HI> slave-holder especially,
with rigor and brutality.</P>
<P>But a <HI>necessity</HI> is pretended; the name under which all
enormities are attempted to be excused. And after all, what
is the necessity? It was never pretended that the land
could not be cultivated there, as it is here, by hired ser∣vants;
only that it could not be cultivated with quite
<PB N="197" REF="235"/>
the same conveniency and cheapness, as by the labour of
slaves. By which means, a pound of sugar, which the
planter now sells for sixpence, could not be afforded
under sixpence halfpenny; and this is the <HI>necessity.</HI></P>
<P>The great revolution which, seems preparing in the
Western world, may probably conduce, and who knows,
but that it is designed to accelerate the fall of this abo∣minable
tyranny: and when this contest, and the pas∣sions
that attend it are no more, there will succeed a season
for reflecting, whether a legislature, which had so long
lent it's assistance to the support of an institution replete
with human misery, was fit to be trusted with an empire,
the most extensive that ever obtained in any age or quarter
of the world.</P>
<P>Slavery was a part of the civil constitution of most
countries, when Christianity appeared, yet no passage is
to be found in the Christian scriptures, by which it is con∣demned
or prohibited. This is true; for Christianity,
soliciting admission into all nations of the world, abstained,
as behoved it, from intermeddling with the civil institu∣tions
of any. But does it follow, from the silence of
scripture concerning them, that all the civil institutions
which then prevailed, were right? or that the bad should
not be exchanged for better?</P>
<P>Besides this, the discharging slaves from all obligation
to obey their masters, which is the consequence of pro∣nouncing
<PB N="198" REF="236"/>
slavery to be unlawful, would have had no bet∣ter
effect, than to let loose one half of mankind upon the
other. Slaves would have been tempted to embrace a reli∣gion,
which asserted their right to freedom. Masters
would hardly have been persuaded to consent to claims
founded upon such authority. The most calamitous of all
contests, a <HI>bellum servile,</HI> might probably have ensued, to
the reproach, if not the extinction of the Christian name.</P>
<P>The truth is, the emancipation of slaves should be gra∣dual;
and carried on by provisions of law, and under the
protection of civil government. Christianity can only ope∣rate
as an alterative. By the mild diffusion of it's light
and influence, the minds of men are insensibly prepared to
perceive and correct the enormities, which folly, or wick∣edness,
or accident, have introduced into their public esta∣blishments.
In this way the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> slavery, and
since these, the feudal tyranny has declined before it.
And we trust that as the knowledge and authority of the
same religion advance in the world, they will banish what
remains of this odious institution.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Charity.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Professional Assistance.</HEAD>
<P>THIS kind of beneficence is chiefly to be expected
from members of the legislature, magistrates,
medical, legal, and sacerdotal professions.</P>
<P>1. The care of the poor ought to be the principal object
of all laws, for this plain reason, that the rich are able to
take care of themselves.</P>
<P>Much has been, and more might be done, by the laws
of this country, towards the relief of the impotent, and the
protection and encouragement of the industrious poor.
Whoever applies himself to collect observations upon the
state and operation of the poor laws; and to contrive re∣medies
for the imperfections and abuses he observes; and
digests these remedies into acts of parliament; and con∣ducts
them by argument or influence through the two
branches of the legislature; or communicates his ideas to
those, who are more likely to carry them into effect; de∣serves
well of a class of the community so numerous, that
<PB N="200" REF="238"/>
their happiness makes no inconsiderable part of the whole. The study and activity thus employed is charity, in the
most meritorious sense of the word.</P>
<P>2. The care of the poor is intrusted in the first instance
to overseers and contractors, who have an interest in oppo∣sition
to that of the poor, inasmuch as whatever they afford
them, comes in part out of their own pocket. For this
reason, the law has deposited with justices of the peace, a
power of superintendence and control; and the judicious
interposition of this power is a most useful exertion of cha∣rity,
and oftimes within the ability of those, who have no
other way of serving their generation. A country gentle∣man,
of very moderate education, and who has little to
spare from his fortune, by learning so much of the poor
law, as is to be found in Dr. <HI>Burn's Justice,</HI> and furnishing
himself with a knowledge of the prices of labour and pro∣vision,
so as to be able to estimate the exigences of a family,
and what is to be expected from their industry, may, in
this way, place out the one talent committed to him, to
great account.</P>
<P>3. Of all private professions, that of medicine puts it in
a man's power to do the most good at the least expence.
Health, which is precious to all, is to the poor invaluable;
and their complaints, as agues, rheumatisms, &amp;c. are often
such as yield to medicine. And as to the expence, drugs
at first hand cost little, and advice nothing, where it is only
bestowed upon those who could not afford to pay for it.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="239"/>
4. The rights of the poor are not so important or intri∣cate,
as their contentions are violent and ruinous. A
Lawyer or Attorney of tolerable knowledge in his profes∣sion,
has commonly judgment enough to adjust these dis∣putes,
with all the effect, and without the expence of a
law suit; and he may be said to give a poor man twenty
pounds, who prevents his throwing it away upon law.
A <HI>legal</HI> man, whether of the profession or not, who toge∣ther
with a spirit of conciliation, possesses the confidence
of his neighbourhood, will be much resorted to for this
purpose, especially since the great increase of costs has
produced a general dread of going to law.</P>
<P>Nor is this line of beneficence confined to <HI>arbitration.</HI>
Seasonable counsel coming with the weight which the re∣putation
of the adviser gives it, will often keep or extri∣cate
the rash and un-informed out of great difficulties.
And I know not a more exalted charity than that, which
presents a shield against the rapacity or persecution of a
tyrant.</P>
<P>5. Betwixt argument and authority (I mean that autho∣rity,
which flows, from voluntary respect, and attends up∣on
sanctity and disinterestedness of character) something
may be done amongst the lower orders of mankind, to∣wards
the regulation of their conduct, and the satisfac∣tion
of their thoughts. This office belongs to the mini∣sters
of religion; or rather whoever undertakes it becomes
a minister of religion. The inferior clergy, who are
<PB N="202" REF="240"/>
nearly upon a level with the common sort of their parish∣ioners,
and on that account, gain an easier admission to
their society and confidence, have in this respect more in
their power than their superiors; and the discreet use of
this power constitutes one of the most respectable functi∣ons
of human nature.</P>

<P><HI>I.</HI> The obligation to bestow relief upon the poor.</P>
<P>THOSE, who rank pity amongst the original impul∣ses
of our nature, rightly contend, that when it
prompts us to the relief of human misery, it indicates
sufficiently the divine intention, and our duty. Indeed
the same conclusion is deducible from the existence of the
passion whatever account be given of its origin. Whether
it be an instinct or a habit, it is in fact a property of our
<PB N="203" REF="241"/>
nature, which God appointed: And the final cause, for
which it was appointed, is to afford to the miserable, in
the compassion of their fellow creatures, a remedy for
those inequalities and distresses, which God foresaw
that many must be exposed to, under every general rule for
the distribution of property.</P>
<P>Besides this, the poor have a claim founded in the law
of nature, which may be thus explained. All things
were originally common: no one being able to produce a
charter from Heaven had any better title to a particular
possession, than his next neighbour. There were reasons
for mankind's agreeing upon a separation of this common
fund; and God for these reasons, is presumed to have ra∣tified
it. But this separation was made and consented to,
upon the expectation and condition, that every one should
have left a sufficiency for his subsistence, or the means of
procuring it; and as no fixed laws for the regulation of
property can be so contrived, as to provide for the relief
of every case and distress which may arise, these cases
and distrersses, when their right and share in the common
stock was given up or taken from them, were supposed to
be left to the voluntary bounty of those, who might be
acquainted with the exigencies of their situation, and in
the way of affording assistance. And therefore, when
the partition of propriety is rigidly maintained against the
claims of indigence and distress, it is maintained in oppo∣sition
to the intention of those who made it, and to <HI>his,</HI>
who is the Supreme Proprietor of every thing, and who
<PB N="204" REF="242"/>
has filled the world with plenteousness for the sustentation
and comfort of all whom he sends into it.</P>
<P>The Christian scriptures are more copious and explicit
upon this duty than almost any other. The descrip∣tion
which Christ hath left us of the proceedings of
the last day, establishes the obligation of bounty, so far
as his authority can be depended upon, beyond controversy.
“When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all
the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the
throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered
all nations; and he shall separate them one from ano∣ther.—Then
shall the king say unto them on his right
hand, Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the king∣dom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was
thirsty and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger and ye
took me in: naked, and ye cloathed me: I was sick and
ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.—And
inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least
of these my brethern, ye have done it unto me.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxv. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> It is
not necessary to understand this passage as a literal
account of what will actually pass on that day. Supposing it
only a scenical discription of the rules and principles, by which
the supreme arbiter of our destiny will regulate his decisi∣ons,
it conveys the same lesson to us; it equally demon∣strates
of how great value and importance these duties in
<PB N="205" REF="243"/>
the sight of God are, and what stress will be laid upon
them. The Apostles also describe this virtue as propitiat∣ing
the divine favour in an eminent degree. And these
recommendations have produced their effect. It does not
appear that before the times of Christianity, a Hospital,
Infirmary, or public charity of any kind, existed in the
world; whereas most countries in Christendom have long
abounded with these institutions. To which may be add∣ed,
that a spirit of private liberality seems to flourish a∣midst
the decay of many other virtues: not to mention
the legal provision for the poor, which obtains in this
country, and which was unknown and unthought of by
the most polished nations of antiquity.</P>
<P>St. Paul adds upon the subject an excellent direction;
and which is practicable by all who have any thing to give.
“Upon the first day of the week (or any other stated
time) let every one of you lay by in store, as God hath
prospered him.” By which I understand St. Paul to
recommend, what is the very thing wanting with most
men, <HI>the being charitable upon a plan;</HI> that is, from a delibe∣rate
comparison of our fortunes, with the reasonable ex∣pences
and expectations of our families; to compute
what we can spare, and to lay by so much for charitable
purposes, in some mode or other. The <HI>mode</HI> will be a
consideration afterwards.</P>
<P>The effect, which Christianity produced upon some of
its first converts, was such as might be looked for, from a
divine religion coming with full force and miraculous
<PB N="206" REF="244"/>
evidence, upon the consciences of mankind. It over-whelmed
all worldly considerations in the expectation of
a more important existence. “And the multitude of them
that believed were of one heart and of one soul; nei∣ther
said any of them that aught of the things, which
he possessed, was his own; but they had all things in
common.—Neither was there any among them that
lacked; for as many as were possessors of lands or
houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things
that were sold, and laid them down, at the apostles feet;
and distribution was made unto every man, according as
he had need.” Acts iv, 32.</P>
<P>Nevertheless this community of goods, however it ma∣nifested
the sincere zeal of the primitive christians, is no
precedent for our imitation. It was confined to the church
at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> continued not long there; was never en∣joined
upon any (Acts. v. 4.); and altho' it might suit
with the particular circumstances of a small, and select
society, is altogether impracticable in a large and mixed
community.</P>
<P>The conduct of the Apostles upon the occasion deserves
to be noticed. Their followers laid down their fortunes
at their feet; but so far were they from taking advantage
of this unlimited confidence, to enrich themselves or
establish their authority, that they soon after got rid of this
business, as inconsistent with the main object of their mis∣sion,
and transferred the custody and management of the
<PB N="207" REF="245"/>
public fund to deacons, elected to that office by the people
at large. (Acts. vi).</P>
<P>II. <HI>The manner of bestowing bounty—or the different kinds of charity.</HI></P>
<P>Every question between the different kinds of charity
supposes the sum bestowed to be the same.</P>
<P>There are three kinds of charity which prefer a claim
to attention.</P>
<P>The first, and, in my judgment one of the best, is to
give stated and considerable sums, by way of pension or
annuity, to individuals or families with whose behaviour
and distress we ourselves are acquainted. When I speak of
<HI>considerable</HI> sums, I mean only, that five pounds, or any
other sum, given at once, or divided amongst five or fewer
families, will do more good than the same sum, distributed
amongst a greater number in shillings or half crowns;
and that, because it is more likely in the former way to be
properly applied by the persons who receive it. A poor
fellow, who can find no better use for a shilling, than to
drink his benefactor's health, and purchase half an hour's
recreation for himself, would hardly break into a guinea
for any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch purpose, or be so improvident, as not to lay it
by, for an occasion of importance, for his rent, his cloath∣ing,
fuel, or stock of winter's provision. It is a still grea∣ter
recommendation of this kind of charity, that pensions
<PB N="208" REF="246"/>
and annuities, which are paid regularly, and can be expect∣ed
at the time, are the only way by which we can pre∣vent
one part of a poor man's sufferings, the dread of
want.</P>
<P>2. But as this kind of charity supposes that proper ob∣jects
of such expensive benefactions, fall within our pri∣vate
knowledge and observation, which does not happen to
all, a second method of doing good, which is in every
one's power, who has the money to spare, is by subscrip∣tion
to public charities. Public charities admit of this
argument in their favour, that your money goes farther
in this way, towards attaining the end, for which it is
given, than it can do by any private and separate benefi∣cence.
A guinea for example, contributed to an Infirma∣ry,
becomes the means of providing one patient at least,
with a physician, surgeon, apothecary, with medicine,
diet, lodging, and suitable attendance; which is not the
tenth part, of what the same assistance, if it could be pro∣cured
at all, would cost to a sick person or family in any
other situation.</P>
<P>3. The last, and compared with the former, the lowest
exertion of benevolence, is in the relief of beggars. Ne∣vertheless,
I by no means approve the indiscriminate re∣jection
of all who implore our alms this way. Some may
perish by such a conduct. Men are sometimes overtaken
by distress, for which all other relief would come too late.
Besides which, resolutions of this kind compell us to offer
<PB N="209" REF="247"/>
such violence to our humanity, as may go near, in a little
while, to suffocate the principle itself; which is a very se∣rious
consideration. A good man, if he do not surrender
himself to his feelings without reserve, will at least lend
an ear to importunities, which come accompanied with
outward attestations of distress; and after a patient hearing
of the complaint, will direct himself by the circumstances
and credibility of the account he receives.</P>
<P>There are other species of charity well contrived to make
the money expended <HI>go far;</HI> such as keeping down the
price of fuel or provision, in case of a monopoly or tempo∣rary
scarcity, by purchasing the articles at the best market,
and retailing them at prime cost or a small loss; or adding
a bounty to particular species of labour, when the price
is accidently depressed.</P>
<P>The proprietors of large estates have it in their power to
facilitate the maintenance, and thereby encourage the esta∣blishment
of families, (which is one of the noblest pur∣poses
to which the rich and great can convert their endea∣vours)
by building cottages, splitting farms, erecting ma∣nufactures,
cultivating wastes, embanking the sea, draining
marshes, and other expedients, which the situation of each
estate points out. If the profits of these undertakings do
not repay the expence, let the authors of them place the
difference to the account of charity. It is true of most
such projects that the public is a gainer by them, whatever
<PB N="210" REF="248"/>
the owner be. And where the loss can be spared, this is
consideration enough.</P>
<P>It is become a question of some importance, under what
Circumstances charity ought to be done in private, and
when it may be made public, without detracting from the
merit of the action, (if it ever may); the author of
our religion having delivered a rule upon this subject,
which seems to enjoin universal secrecy. “When thou
doest alms, let not thy left hand know, what thy right
hand doth; that thy alms may be in secret, and thy fa∣ther
which seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee
openly.” (Mat. vi. 3, 4.) From the preamble to this
prohibition, I think it however plain, that our Saviour's de∣sign
was to forbid <HI>ostentation,</HI> and all publishing of good
works, which proceeds from <HI>ostentation,</HI> and nothing else.
“Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, <HI>to be
seen of them;</HI> otherwise ye have no reward of your fa∣ther,
which is in Heaven: therefore when thou doest thine
alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypo∣crites
do, in the synagogues and in the streets, <HI>that they
may have glory of men.</HI> Verily I say unto thee they have
their reward.” v. 2. There are motives for the doing
our alms in public, besides those of <HI>ostentation,</HI> with which
therefore our Saviour's rule has no concern; such as to
testify our approbation of some particular species of cha∣rity,
and to recommend it to others; to take off the pre∣judice,
which the want, or which is the same thing, the
suppression of our name in the list of contributors might
<PB N="211" REF="249"/>
excite against the charity, or against ourselves: and, so
long as these motives are free from any mixture of vanity,
they are in no danger of invading our Saviour's prohibi∣tion;
they rather seem to comply with another direction,
which he has left us, “Let your light so shine before men,
that they may see your good works and glorify your fa∣ther
which is in Heaven.” If it be necessary to pro∣pose
a precise distinction upon the subject, I can think
of none better than the following. When our bounty is
<HI>beyond</HI> our fortune or station, that is, when it is more than
could be expected from us, our charity should be private,
if privacy be practicable; when it is not more than might
be expected, it may be public; for we cannot hope to
influence others to the imitation of extraordinary genero∣sity,
and therefore want, in the former case, the only
justifiable reason for making it public.</P>
<P>Having thus described several different exertions of cha∣rity,
it may not be improper to take notice of a species of
liberality, which is not <HI>charity,</HI> in any sense of the word;
I mean the giving of entertainments or liquor, for the sake
of popularity; or the rewarding, treating, and maintain∣ing,
the companions of our diversions, as hunters, shooters,
fishers, and the like. I do not say that this is criminal;
I only say that it is not charity; and that we are not to
suppose, because we <HI>give,</HI> and give to the <HI>poor,</HI> that it will
stand in the place, or supersede the obligation, of more me∣ritorious
and disinterested bounty.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="250"/>
IV. <HI>The pretences by which men excuse themselves from giving to the poor.</HI></P>
<P>1. “That they have nothing to spare.” i. e. nothing,
which they have not some other use for; nothing, which
their plan of expence, together with the savings they have
resolved to lay by, will not exhaust: never reflecting whe∣ther
it be in their <HI>power,</HI> or that it is their <HI>duty</HI> to
retrench their expences, and contract their plan, “that they may have
to give to them that need;” or rather that this ought to
have been part of their plan originally.</P>
<P>2. “That they have families of their own, and that
charity begins at home.” The extent of this plea, will
be considered when we come to explain the duty of parents.</P>
<P>3. “That charity does not consist in giving money, but in
benevolence, philanthropy, love to all mankind, goodness
of heart, &amp;c.” Hear St. James. "If a brother or sister
be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you
say unto them, depart in peace, be you warmed and filled,
notwithstanding <HI>ye give them not those things which are need∣ful
to the body,</HI> what doth it profit? (James, ii. 15, 16.)</P>
<P>4. “That giving to the poor is not mentioned in St.
Paul's description of charity, in the thirteenth chapter of
his first Epistle to the Corinthians.” This is not a de∣scription
of charity, but of good nature; and it is not ne∣cessary
that every duty be mentioned in every place.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="251"/>
5. “That they pay the poor rates.” They might as
well alledge that they pay their debts; for the poor have
the same right to that portion of a man's property, which
the laws assign them, that the man himself has to the
remainder.</P>
<P>6. “That they employ many poor persons:” for their
own sake, not the poor's, otherwise it is a good plea.</P>
<P>7. “That the poor do not suffer so much as we ima∣gine;
that education and habit have reconciled them to
the evils of their condition, and make them easy under it.”
Habit can never reconcile any one to the extremities of
cold, hunger, and thirst, any more than to the touch of a
red hot iron: besides, the question is not, how unhappy
any one is, but how much more happy we can make him.</P>
<P>8. “That these people, give them what you will, will never thank you, or think of you for it.” In the first place, this is not true; in the second place, it was not for the sake of their thanks that you relieved them.</P>
<P>9. “That we are so liable to be imposed upon.” If a
due enquiry be made, our motive and merit is the same:
besides that the distress is generally real, whatever has
been the cause of it.</P>
<P>10. “That they should apply to their parishes.” This is
not always practicable; to which we may add, that there are
<PB N="214" REF="252"/>
many requisites to a comfortable subsistence, which parish
relief does not always supply; and that there are some,
who would suffer almost as much from receiving parish
relief, as by the want of it; and lastly, that there are ma∣ny
modes of charity, to which this answer does not re∣late
at all.</P>
<P>11. “That giving money encourages idleness and va∣grancy.”
This is true only of injudicious and indiscri∣minate
generosity.</P>
<P>12. “That we have too many objects of charity at
home, to bestow any thing upon strangers, or that there
are other charities, which are more useful or stand in
greater need.” The value of this excuse depends entirely
upon the <HI>fact,</HI> whether we actually relieve those
neigh∣bouring
objects, and contribute to those other charities.</P>
<P>Besides all these, pride, or prudery, or delicacy, or love
of ease, keep one half of the world, out of the way of ob∣serving
what the other half suffer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Anger.</HEAD>
<P>“BE ye angry and sin not;” therefore all anger is not
sinful: I suppose, because some degree of it, and
upon some occasions, is inevitable.</P>
<P>It becomes sinful, or contradicts however the rule of
scripture, when it is conceived upon slight and inadequate
provocations; and when it continues long.</P>
<P>1. When it is conceived upon slight provocations; for
“charity suffereth long, is not easily provoked” “let every
man be slow to anger”—peace, long suffering, gentleness,
meekness, are enumerated among the fruits of the spirit
Gal. v. 22, and compose the true christian temper, as to
this article of duty.</P>
<P>2. When it continues long; for “let not the sun go
down upon your wrath.”</P>
<P>These precepts, and all reasoning indeed upon the sub∣ject,
suppose the passion of anger within our power; and
this power, consists not so much in any faculty we have
<PB N="217" REF="255"/>
of assuaging our wrath at the time, (for we are passive un∣der
the smart which an injury or affront occasions, and all
we can then do, is to prevent its breaking out into action)
as in so fortifying our minds, by habits of just reflection,
as to be less irritated by impressions of injury, and to
relent sooner.</P>
<P>Reflections proper for this purpose, and which may be
called the <HI>sedatives</HI> of anger, are the following: the pos∣sibility
of mistaking the motives, from which the conduct
that offends us proceeded; how often <HI>our</HI> offences have been
the effect of inadvertency, when they were mistaken
for malice; the inducement which prompted our adversary
to act as he did; and how powerfully the same inducement
has at one time or other, operated upon ourselves; that he
is suffering perhaps under a contrition, which he is ashamed,
or wants opportunity, to confess; and how ungenerous it is
to triumph by coldness or insult over a spirit already hum∣bled
in secret; that the returns of kindness are sweet; and
that there is neither honour, nor virtue, nor use in resisting
them; (for some persons think themselves bound to cherish
and studiously keep alive their indignation, when they find
it dying away of itself;) we may remember that others have
their passions, their prejudices, their favourite aims, their
fears, their cautions, their interests, their sudden impulses,
their varieties of apprehension, as well as we; we may
recollect what has passed in our own minds, when we have
got on the wrong side of a quarrel; and imagine the same to
be passing in our adversary's mind now; when we became
<PB N="218" REF="256"/>
sensible of our misbehaviour, what palliations we perceiv∣ed
in it, and expected others to perceive; how we were
affected by the kindness, and felt the superiority of a ge∣nerous
reception and ready forgiveness; how persecution
revived our spirits with our enmity, and seemed to justify
the conduct in ourselves, which we before blamed. Add
to this, the indecency of extravagant anger; how it ren∣ders
us, whilst it lasts, the scorn and sport of all about us;
of which, it leaves us, when it ceases, sensible and ashamed;
the inconveniences, and irretrievable misconduct into which
our irascibility has sometimes betrayed us; the friendships
it has lost us; the distresses and embarrassments, in which
we have been involved by it; and the sore repentance,
which on one account or other it always costs us.</P>
<P>But the reflection calculated above all others to bring
down that haughtiness of temper, which is ever finding out
provocations, and renders anger so impetuous, is that which
the gospel first proposed; namely, that we ourselves are,
or shortly shall be, suppliants for mercy and pardon at the
judgement seat of God. Imagine our secret sins all dis∣closed
and brought to light; imagine us thus humbled and
exposed; trembling under the hand of God; casting our∣selves
on his compassion; crying out for mercy—imagine
such a creature to talk of satisfaction and revenge; refusing
to be entreated, disdaining to forgive; extreme to mark
and to resent, what is done amiss; imagine I say this,
and you can hardly feign to yourself an instance of more
impious and unnatural arrogance.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="257"/>
The point is to habituate ourselves to these reflections,
till they rise up of their own accord, when they are want∣ed;
that is, instantly upon the receipt of an injury or af∣front,
and with such force and colouring, as both to mi∣tigate
the paroxysms of our anger, and at length to pro∣duce
an alteration in the temper and constitution itself.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Revenge.</HEAD>
<P>ALL pain occasioned to another in consequence of
an offence, or injury received from him, farther
than what is calculated to procure reparation, or promote
the just ends of punishment, is so much revenge.</P>
<P>There can be no difficulty in knowing, when we occa∣sion
pain to another; nor any in distinguishing, whether
we do so, with a view only to the ends of punishment, or
from revenge; for in the one case we proceed with reluc∣tance,
in the other with pleasure.</P>
<P>It is highly <HI>probable</HI> from the light of nature, that a
passion, which seeks its gratification immediately and ex∣pressly
in giving pain, is disagreeable to the benevolent
<PB N="220" REF="258"/>
will and counsels of the creator. Other passions and plea∣sures
may, and often do produce pain to some one; but
then pain is not, as it is here, the object of the passion, and
the cause of the pleasure. This <HI>probability</HI> is converted in∣to
certainty, if we give credit to those passages of the chris∣tian
scriptures, which condemn revenge, or what is the
same thing, which enjoin forgiveness.</P>
<P>We will set down the principal, of these passages; and
endeavour to collect from them, what conduct is upon
the whole allowed to an enemy, and what is forbidden.</P>
<P>“If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly
Father will also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men
their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.” “And his Lord was wroth, and delivered him
to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due un∣to
him; so likewise, shall my heavenly Father do also un∣to
you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his
brother their trespasses.” “Put on bowels of mercy, kind∣ness,
humbleness of mind, meekness, long suffering,
forbearing one another, forgiving one another, if any
man have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave
you, so also do ye.” “Be patient towards all men; see
that none render evil for evil unto any man.” “Avenge not
yourselves but rather give place unto wrath: for it is writ∣ten,
vengeance is mine, I will repay saith the Lord.
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, seed him; if he thirst,
give him drink; for in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of
<PB N="221" REF="259"/>
fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but over∣come
evil with good.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. vi. 14. 15. xviii. 34. 35. Col. iii. 12. 13. Thess. v. 14. 15. Rom. xii. 19. i.</NOTE></P>
<P>I think it evident from some of these passages taken se∣parately,
and still more so, from all of them together,
that revenge as described in the beginning of this chapter,
is forbidden in every degree, under all forms, and upon any
occasion. We are likewise forbidden to refuse to an ene∣my
even the most imperfect right; “if he hunger feed
him, if he thirst give him drink,”<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sec also Exodus xxiii. 4. "If thou meet thine enemy's ox, or his ass, going astray thou shall surely bring it back to him again: if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.</NOTE> which are examples
of imperfect rights. If one who has offended us, solicit
from us a vote to which his qualifications entitle him, we
may not refuse it from motives of resentment, or the me∣mory
of what we have suffered at his hands. His right,
and our obligation which follows the right, is not altered
by his enmity to us, or our's to him.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I do not conceive, that these prohi∣bitions
were intended to interfere with the punishment or
prosecution of public offenders. In the eighteenth chap∣ter
of St. Matthew, our Saviour tells his disciples, “if
thy brother who has trespassed against thee, neglect to
<PB N="222" REF="260"/>
hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man,
and a publican.” Immediately after this, when St. Pe∣ter
asked him, “how oft shall my brother sin against me,
and I forgive him?” till seven times? Christ replied, “I
say not unto thee until seven times; but until seventy
times seven;” that is as often as he repeats the offence.
From these two passages compared together, we are au∣thorized
to conclude, that the forgiveness of an enemy,
is not inconsistent with the proceeding against him as a
public offender; and that the discipline established in reli∣gious
or civil societies, for the restraint or punishment of
criminals, ought to be upheld.</P>
<P>As the Magistrate is not tied down by these prohibitions
from the execution of his office, so neither is the prosecutor;
for the office of the prosecutor is as necessary as
that of the magistrate.</P>
<P>Nor by parity of reason, are private persons withheld
from the correction of vice, when it is in their pow∣er
to exercise it; by which, some kinds of vice are
more discouraged and kept in awe, than by legal penal∣ties:
provided however they be assured, that it is the guilt,
which provokes them, and not the injury; and that their
motives are pure from all mixture, and every particle of
that spirit, which delights and triumphs in the pain
and humiliation of an adversary.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="261"/>
Thus it is no breach of christian charity, to withdraw
our company or civility, when the same tends to discoun∣tenance
any vicious practice. This is one branch of that
extrajudicial discipline, which supplies the defects and re∣missness
of law; and is expressly authorized by St. Paul
(1 Cor. v. II.) “But now I have written unto you, not to
keep company, if any man, that is called a brother, be a
fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a
drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to
eat.” The use of this continues to be experienced in one
instance, and might be extended with good effect to others.
The confederacy amongst women of character, to exclude
from their society, kept mistresses and prostitutes, contri∣butes
more perhaps to discourage that condition of life,
and prevents more from entering into it, than all the con∣siderations
of prudence and religion put together.</P>
<P>We are likewise allowed to practice so much caution, as
not to put ourselves in the way of injury, or invite the re∣petition
of it. If a servant, or tradesman has cheated us,
we are not bound to trust him again; for this is to encou∣rage
him in his dishonest practices, which is doing him as
much harm, as it can do us.</P>
<P>Where a benefit can be conferred only upon one or few;
and the choice of the person, upon whom it is conferred,
is a proper subject of favour; we are at liberty to prefer
<PB N="224" REF="262"/>
those who have not offended us to those who have; the
contrary being no where required.</P>
<P>Christ who, as hath been well demonstrated,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a view of the internal evidence of the Christian Religion.</NOTE> estimated
virtues by their solid utility, and not by their fashion or po∣pularity,
prefers this of the forgiveness of injuries, to every
other. He injoins it oftener; with more earnestness; un∣der
a greater variety of forms; and with this weighty and
peculiar circumstance, that the forgiveness of others is the
condition, upon which alone we are to expect, or even
ask, from God, forgiveness for ourselves. And this prefer∣ence
is justified by the superior importance of the virtue
itself. The feuds and animosities in families and between
neighbours, which disturb the intercourse of human life,
and collectively compose half the misery of it, have their
foundation in the want of a forgiving temper, and can
never cease, but by the exercise of this virtue, on one side,
or both.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Duelling.</HEAD>
<P>DUELLING as a punishment is absurd; because it is an
equal chance, whether the punishment fall upon the
offender, or the person offended. Nor is it much better
as a reparation; it being hard to say, what <HI>satisfaction</HI>
consists in, or how it tends to undo the injury, or afford a
compensation for the damage already sustained.</P>
<P>The truth is, it is not considered as either. A law of
honour having annexed the imputation of cowardice to
patience under an affront, challenges are given and accept∣ed,
with no other design than to prevent or wipe off this
suspicion; without malice against the adversary, generally
without a wish to destroy him, or any concern but to
preserve the duellist's own reputation and reception in the
world.</P>
<P>The unreasonableness of this rule of manners is one
consideration; the duty and conduct of individuals, whilst
such a rule exists, is another.</P>
<P>As to which, the proper and single question is this,
whether a regard for our own reputation is, or is not suffi∣cient
to justify the taking away the life of another.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="264"/>
Murder is forbidden; and wherever human life is delibe∣rately
taken away, otherwise than by public authority,
there is murder. The value and security of human life
make this rule necessary; for I do not see what other
idea or definition of murder can be admitted, which will
not let in so much private violence, as to render society a
scene of peril and bloodshed.</P>
<P>If unauthorized laws of honour be allowed to create ex∣captions
to divine prohibitions, there is an end of all mo∣rality
as founded in the will of the Deity; and the obli∣gation
of every duty, may at one time or other be dis∣charged,
by the caprice and fluctuations of fashion.</P>
<P>But a sense of shame is so much torture; and no relief
presents itself otherwise than by an attempt upon the life
of our adversary. What then? The distress which men
suffer by the want of money is oftentimes extreme, and
no resource can be discovered but that of removing a life,
which stands between the distressed person and his inheri∣tance.
The motive in this case is as urgent, and the
means much the same as in the former; yet this case
finds no advocates.</P>
<P>Take away the circumstance of the duellist's exposing his
own life, and it becomes assassination: add this circumstance,
and what difference does it make? none but this, that fewer
perhaps will imitate the example, and human life will be
somewhat more safe, when it cannot be attacked without
<PB N="227" REF="265"/>
equal danger to the aggressor's own. Experience however
proves that there is fortitude enough in most men to under∣take
this hazard; and were it otherwise, the defence, at
best, would be only that which a highwayman or house-breaker
might plead, whose attempt had been so daring
and desperate, that few were likely to repeat the same.</P>
<P>In expostulating with the duellist I all along suppose his
adversary to fall. Which supposition I am at liberty to
make, because, if he have no right to kill his adversary, he
has none to attempt it.</P>
<P>In return, I forbear applying to the case of duelling, the
christian principle of the forgiveness of injurles; because
the injury may be supposed to be forgiven, and the duellist
to act entirely from a concern for his own reputation:
where this is not the case, the guilt of duelling is manifest,
and greater.</P>
<P>In this view it seems unnecessary to distinguish, between
him who gives, and him who accepts a challenge; for
they incur an equal hazard of destroying life; and both
act upon the same persuasion, that what they do is neces∣sary,
in order to recover or preserve the good opinion of
the world.</P>
<P>Public opinion is not easily controlled by civil institu∣tions;
for which reason I question whether any regulations
can be contrived of sufficient force to suppress or change
<PB N="228" REF="266"/>
the rule of honour which stigmatises all scruples about
duelling with the reproach of cowardice.</P>
<P>The inadequate redress which the law of the land af∣fords,
for those injuries which chiefly affect a man in his
sensibility and reputation, tempts many to redress them∣selves.
Prosecutions for such offences, by the trifling da∣mages
that are recovered, serve only to make the sufferer
more ridiculous.—This ought to be remedied.</P>
<P>For the army, where the point of honour is cultivated
with exquisite attention and refinement, I would establish
a Court of Honour, with a power of awarding those sub∣missions
and acknowledgments, which it is generally the
object of a challenge to obtain; and it might grow into a
fashion, with persons of rank of all professions, to refer
their quarrels to the same tribunal.</P>
<P>Duelling, as the law now stands, can seldom be over∣taken
by legal punishment. The challenge, appointment,
and other previous circumstances, which indicate the in∣tention
with which the combatants met, being suppressed,
nothing <HI>appears</HI> to a court of justice, but the actual ren∣counter.
And if a person be slain when actually fighting
with his adversary, the law deems his death nothing more
than manslaughter.</P>

<P>“IF it be <HI>possible</HI> live peaceably with all men;” which
precept contains an indirect confession that this is
not always <HI>possible.</HI></P>
<P>The instances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also; and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.”</NOTE> in the fifth chapter of St. Matthew are
rather to be understood as proverbial methods of describ∣ing
the general duties of forgiveness and benevolence, and
of the temper we ought to aim at acquiring, than as di∣rections
to be specifically observed; or of themselves of
any great importance to be observed. The first of these
is “if thine enemy smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to
him the other also;” yet, when one of the officers struck
Jesus, with the palm of his hand, we find Jesus re∣buking
him for the outrage, with becoming indigna∣tion;
“if I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but
<PB N="230" REF="268"/>
if well, why smitest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?” (John xviii. 22.) It may be
observed likewise, that all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>amples are drawn from in∣stances
of small and tolerable injuries. A rule which for∣bad
all opposition to injury, or defence against it, could
have no other effect, than to put the good in subjection to
the bad; and deliver one half of mankind to the depre∣dation
of the other half: which must be the case, so long
as some considered themselves as bound by such a rule,
whilst others despised it.—<HI>St. Paul,</HI> tho' no one inculcated
forgiveness and forbearance, with a deeper sense of the va∣lue
and obligation of these virtues, did not interpret either
of them to require an unresisting submission to every con∣tumely,
or a neglect of the means of safety and self-de∣fence.
He took refuge in the laws of his country, and
the privileges of a <HI>Roman</HI> citizen, from the conspiracy of
the <HI>Jews,</HI> (Acts. xxv. 11.) and from the clandestine vio∣lence
of the chief Captain. (Acts xxii. 25.) And this is
the same apostle who reproved the litigiousness of his <HI>Co∣rinthian</HI>
converts with so much severity. “Now therefore
there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law
one with another: why do ye not rather take wrong? Why
do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?”</P>
<P>On the one hand therefore, Christianity excludes all
vindictive motives, and all frivolous causes of prosecution;
so that, where the injury is small, where no good purpose
of public example is answered, where forbearance is not
likely to invite a repetition of the injury, or where the ex∣pence
<PB N="231" REF="269"/>
of an action becomes a punishment too severe for
the offence; here the christian is withheld by the authority
of his religion from going to law.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a law suit is inconsistent with no
rule of the gospel, when it is instituted,</P>
<P>1. For the establishing of some important right.</P>
<P>2. For the procuring a compensation for some consider∣able
damage.</P>
<P>3. For the preventing of future injury.</P>
<P>But since it is supposed to be undertaken simply with a
view to the ends of justice and safety, the prosecutor of
the action is bound to confine himself to the cheapest pro∣cess,
that will accomplish these ends, as well as to con∣sent
to any peaceable expedient for the same purpose; as
<HI>a reference,</HI> in which the arbitrators can do, what the law
cannot, divide the damage, when the fault is mutual; or
<HI>a compounding of the dispute,</HI> by accepting a compensation in
the gross, without entering into articles and items which
it is often very difficult to adjust separately.</P>
<P>As to the rest, the duty of the contending parties may
be expressed in the following directions.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="270"/>
Not to prolong a suit by appeals against your own con∣viction.</P>
<P>Not to undertake or defend a suit against a poor adver∣sary,
or render it more dilatory or expensive than neces∣sary,
with the hope of intimidating or wearying him out
by the expence.</P>
<P>Not to influence <HI>evidence</HI> by authority or expectation.</P>
<P>Nor to stifle any in your possession, although it make
against you.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have treated of civil actions. In criminal
prosecutions the private injury should be forgotten, and
the prosecutor proceed with the same temper, and upon
the same motives, as the magistrate; the one being a ne∣cessary
minister of justice as well as the other; and both,
bound to direct their conduct by a dispassionate care for
the public welfare.</P>
<P>In whatever degree the punishment of an offender is
conducive, or his escape dangerous to the interest of the
community, in the same degree is the party against whom
the crime was committed bound to prosecute, because
such prosecutions must in their nature originate from the
sufferer.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="271"/>
Therefore great public crimes, as Robberies, Forgeries,
&amp;c. ought not to be spared, from an apprehension of
trouble or expence in carrying on the prosecution, or from
false shame or misplaced compassion.</P>
<P>There are many offences such as nuisances, neglect of
public roads, forestalling, engrossing, smuggling, sabbath
breaking, profaneness, drunkenness, prostitution, keep∣ing
lewd or disorderly houses, writing publishing or ex∣posing
to sale lascivious books or prints, with some others,
the prosecution of which, being of equal concern to the
whole neighbourhood, cannot be charged as a particular
obligation upon any.</P>
<P>Nevertheless there is great merit in the person who
undertakes such prosecutions upon proper motives; which
amounts to the same thing.</P>
<P>The character of an informer is in this country unde∣servedly
odious. But where any public advantage is likely
to be attained by informations, or other activity in pro∣moting
the execution of the laws, a good man will despise
a prejudice founded in no just reason, or will acquit him∣self
of the imputation of interested designs, by giving
away his share of the penalty.</P>
<P>On the other hand, prosecutions for the sake of the re∣ward,
or for the gratification of private enmity, where
<PB N="234" REF="272"/>
the offence produces no public mischief, or arises from
ignorance or inadvertency, are reprobated under the ge∣neral
description of <HI>applying a rule of law to a purpose for
which it was not intended.</HI> Under which description may
be ranked an officious revival of the laws against popish

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Gratitude.</HEAD>
<P>EXAMPLES of ingratitude check and discourage
voluntary beneficence: and in this the mischief of
ingratitude consists; nor is the mischief small, for after
all is done that can be done, by prescribing general rules
of justice, and enforcing the observation of them by
pe∣nalties
or compulsion, much must be left to those offices of
kindness, which men remain at liberty to exert or withold.
Now not only the choice of the objects, but the quantity
and even the existence of this sort of kindness in the world
depends, in a great measure, upon the return it receives,
and this is a consideration of public importance.</P>
<P>A second reason for cultivating a grateful temper in
ourselves is the following: the same principle, which is
<PB N="235" REF="273"/>
touched with the kindness of a human benefactor, is ca∣pable
of being affected by the divine goodness, and of be∣coming
under the influence of that affection, a source of the
purest and most exalted virtue. The love of God is the
sublimest gratitude. It is a mistake therefore to imagine,
that this virtue is omitted in the christain scriptures, for
every precept, which commands us “to love God, be∣cause
he first loved us,” presupposes the principle of gra∣titude,
and directs it to its proper object.</P>
<P>It is impossible to particularise the several expressions
of gratitude, which vary with the character and situation
of the benefactor, and with the opportunities of the per∣son
obliged; for this variety admits of no description.</P>
<P>It may be observed however, that gratitude can never
oblige a man to do what is wrong, and what by conse∣quence
he is previously obliged not to do. It is no ingra∣titude
to refuse to do, what we cannot reconcile to any ap∣prehensions
of our duty; but it is ingratitude and hypo∣crisy
together, to pretend this reason, when it is not the
real one: and the frequency of such pretences has brought
this apology for noncompliance with the will of a bene∣factor
into unmerited disgrace.</P>
<P>It has long been accounted a violation of delicacy and
generosity to upbraid men with the favours they have re∣ceived;
but it argues a total destitution of both these qua∣lities
<PB N="236" REF="274"/>
as well as of moral probity, to take advantage of
that ascendency, which the conferring of benefits justly
creates, to draw or drive those whom we have obliged
into mean or dishonest compliances.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Slander.</HEAD>
<P>SPEAKING is acting, both in philosophical strictness,
and as to all moral purposes; for, if the mischief and
motive of our conduct be the same, the means we use
make no difference.</P>
<P>And this is in effect what our Saviour declares, <HI>Matt.</HI>
xii. 37. “By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by
thy words thou shalt be condemned:” by thy words, as
well that is as by thy actions; the one shall be taken in∣to
the account, as well as the other, for they both possess
the same property of voluntarily producing good or evil.</P>
<P>Slander may be distinguished into two kinds, <HI>malicious</HI>
slander, and <HI>inconsiderate</HI> slander.</P>
<P><HI>Malicious</HI> slander, is the relating of either truth or fals∣hood,
with a conscious purpose of creating misery.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="275"/>
I acknowledge that the truth or falshood of what is re∣lated
varies the degree of guilt considerably; and that
slander, in, the ordinary acceptation of the term, signifies
the circulation of mischievous falsehoods; but truth may
be made instrumental to the success of malicious designs
as well as falshood, and altho' the end may sometimes
justify the means, the means can never justify the end.</P>
<P>I think the idea of slander ought to be confined to the
production of <HI>gratuitous</HI> mischief. When we have an end
or interest of our own to serve, if we attempt to compass
it
by falshood, it is <HI>fraud;</HI> if by a discovery of the truth, it
is not without some additional, circumstance of breach of
promise, betraying of confidence, or the like, to be deemed
criminal.</P>
<P>Sometimes the pain is intended for the person we speak
to; at other times an enmity is to be gratified by the
prejudice or disquiet of a third person. To infuse sus∣picions;
to kindle or continue disputes; to avert the fa∣vour
and esteem of benefactors from their dependents; to
render some one we dislike contemptible or obnoxious in
the public opinion; are all offices of slander; of which
the guilt must be measured by the intensity and extent
of
the misery produced.</P>
<P>The disguises under which slander is conveyed, whe∣ther
in a whisper, with injunctions of secresy, by way of
caution, or with affected reluctance, are all so many ag∣gravations
of the offence, as they manifest a more con∣certed
and deliberate design.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="276"/>
<HI>Inconsiderate</HI> slander is a different offence. The not be∣ing
conscious of that mischievous design, which we have
hitherto attributed to the slanderer, makes the difference;
altho' the same mischief actually follow, and might have
been forseen.</P>
<P>The guilt here consists in the want of that regard to
the consequences of our conduct, which a just affection
for human happiness, and concern for our duty, would
not have failed to produce in us. And it is no answer to
this crimination to say that we entertain no bad <HI>design.</HI>
A servant may be a very bad servant, and yet seldom or
never <HI>design</HI> to act in opposition to his master's interest or
will; and his master may justly punish such servant for
a thoughtlessness and neglect nearly as prejudicial as de∣liberate
disobedience. I accuse you not, he may say, of
any express intention to hurt me; but had not the fear
of my displeasure, the care of my interest, and indeed all
the qualities which constitute the merit of a good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervant,
been wanting in you, they would not only have excluded
every direct purpose of giving me uneasiness, but have
been so far present to your thoughts, as to have checked
that unguarded licentiousness, by which I have suffered so
much, and inspired you in its place, with an habitual so∣licitude
about the effects and tendency of what you did
or said. This very much resembles the case of all sins
of inconsideration; and, amongst the foremost of these,
that of inconsiderate slander.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="277"/>
Information communicated for the real purpose of cau∣tion,
is not slander.</P>
<P>Indiscriminate praise, is the opposite of slander, but it is
the opposite extreme; and however it may affect to be
thought excess of candour, is commonly the production
of a frivolous folly, and sometimes of a settled contempt
of all moral distinctions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the public use of marriage institutions.</HEAD>
<P>THE public use of marriage institutions consists in
their promoting the following beneficial effects,</P>
<P>1. The private comfort of individuals, especially of the
female sex. It may be true, that all are not interested in
this reason; nevertheless it is a reason to all for abstaining
from any conduct which tends in its general consequence
to obstruct marriage; for whatever promotes the happi∣ness
of the majority, is binding upon the whole.</P>
<P>2. The production of the greatest number of healthy
children; their better education, and the making of due
provision for their settlement in life.</P>
<P>3. The peace of human, society, in cutting off a prin∣cipal
source of contention, by assigning one or more wo∣men
to one man, and protecting his exclusive right by
sanctions of morality and law.</P>
<P>4. The better government of society, by distributing
the community into separate families; and appointing over
<PB N="242" REF="280"/>
each, the authority of a master of a family, which has more
actual influence, than all civil authority put together.</P>
<P>5. The same end, in the additional security, which the
state receives, for the good behaviour of its citizens, from
the solicitude they feel for the welfare of their children,
and from their being confined to permanent habitations.</P>
<P>6. The encouragement of industry.</P>
<P>Some ancient nations appear to have been more sensible
of the importance of marriage institutions than we are.
The Spartans obliged their citizens to marry, by penalties;
and the Romans encouraged their's, by the <HI>jus trium libero∣rum.</HI>
A man who had no child was entitled by the Ro∣man

<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="243" REF="281"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fornication.</HEAD>
<P>THE first and great mischief, and by consequence
the guilt, of promiscuous concubinage, consists in its
tendency to diminish marriages; and thereby to defeat the
several public and beneficial purposes enumerated in the
preceeding chapter.</P>
<P>Promiscuous concubinage discourages marriage by aba∣ting
the chief temptation to it. The male part of the
species will not undertake the incumbrance, expence, and
restraint of married life, if they can gratify their passions
at a cheaper price; and they will undertake any thing, ra∣ther
than not gratify them.</P>
<P>The reader will learn to comprehend the magnitude of
this mischief, by attending to the importance and variety
of the uses to which marriage is subservient; and by re∣collecting
withal, that the malignity and moral quality
of each crime is not to be estimated by the particular ef∣fect
of one offence, or of one person's offending, but by
the general tendency and consequence of crimes of the
same nature. The libertine may not be conscious that
<PB N="244" REF="282"/>
his indulgences in this way hinder his own marriage, from
which he is deterred, he may alledge, by many different
considerations; much less does he perceive how <HI>his</HI> indul∣gences
can hinder other men from marrying; but what,
will he say, would be the consequence, if the same licen∣tiousness
were universal? or what should hinder its be∣coming
universal, if it be innocent or allowable in him?</P>
<P>2. Fornication supposes prostitution; and prostitution
brings and leaves the victims of it, to almost certain mi∣sery.
It is no small quantity of misery in the aggregate,
which, between want, disease, and insult, is suffered by
those outcasts of human society, who infest populous ci∣ties;
the whole of which, is a <HI>general consequence</HI> of for∣nication,
and to the increase and continuance of which,
every act and instance of fornication contributes.</P>
<P>3. Fornication produces habits of ungovernable lewd∣ness,
which introduce the more aggravated crimes of se∣duction,
adultery, violation, &amp;c. Likewise, however it
be accounted for, the criminal commerce of the sexes cor∣rupts
and depraves the mind and moral character more,
than any single species of vice whatsoever. That ready per∣ception
of guilt, and decisive resolution against it, which
constitute a virtuous character, are seldom found in the per∣sons
addicted to these indulgences. They prepare an easy
admission for every sin that seeks it; and are in low life,
usually the first stage in men's progress to the most despe∣rate
villainies; and in high life, to that lamented dissolute∣ness
<PB N="245" REF="283"/>
of principle, which manifests itself in a profligacy of
public conduct, and a contempt of the obligations of reli∣gion
and moral probity. Add to this, that habits of liber∣tinism
incapacitate and indispose the mind for all intellec∣tual,
moral, and religious pleasures, which is a great loss
to any man's happiness.</P>
<P>4. Fornication perpetuates a disease, which may be ac∣counted
one of the forest maladies of human nature; and
the effects of which are said to visit the constitution of
even distant generations.</P>
<P>The passion being natural proves that it was intended to
be gratified; but under what restrictions, or whether
without any, must be collected from different con∣siderations.</P>
<P>The christian scriptures condemn fornication absolutely
and peremptorily. “Out of the heart,” says our Saviour,
“proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, <HI>fornication,</HI>
thefts, false witness, blasphemies, these are the things
which defile a man.” These are Christ's own words, and
one word from him upon the subject is final. It may be
observed with what society fornication is classed; with
murders, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. I do not mean
that these crimes are all equal, because they are all men∣tioned
together; but it proves that they are all, crimes.
The apostles are more full upon this topic. One well
known passage in the epistle to the Hebrews may stand in
<PB N="246" REF="284"/>
the place of all others; because admitting the authority by
which the apostles of Christ spake and wrote, it is de∣cisive:
“Marriage and the bed undefiled is honourable
amongst all men, but whoremongers and adulterers God
will judge;” which was a great deal to say, at a time
when it was not agreed even amongst philosophers, that
fornication was a crime.</P>
<P>The scriptures give no sanction to those austerities,
which have been since imposed upon the world under the
name of Christ's religion, as the celibacy of the clergy,
the praise of perpetual virginity, the <HI>prohibitio concubitûs cum
gravidâ uxore;</HI> but with a just knowledge of, and regard
to the condition and interest of the human species, have
provided in the marriage of one man with one woman, an
adequate gratification, for the propensities of their nature,
and have <HI>restrained</HI> them to that gratification.</P>
<P>The avowed toleration, and in some countries the li∣censing,
taxing, and regulating of public brothels, has ap∣peared
to the people an authorizing of fornication, and
has contributed with other causes, so far to vitiate the
public opinion, that there is no practice of which the im∣morality
is so little thought of, or acknowledged; altho'
there are few, in which it can more plainly be made out.
The legislators who have patronized receptacles of prosti∣tution,
ought to have foreseen this effect, as well as con∣sidered,
that whatever facilitates fornication, diminishes
marriages. And as to the usual apology for this relaxed
<PB N="247" REF="285"/>
decipline, the danger of greater enormities, if access to
prostitutes were too strictly watched and prohibited, it will
be time enough to look to that, after the laws and the ma∣gistrates
have done their utmost. The greatest vigilance
of both, will do no more, than oppose some bounds and
some difficulties to this intercourse. And after all, these
pretended fears are without foundation in experience. The
men are in all respects the most virtuous, in countries,
where the women are most chaste.</P>
<P>There is a species of cohabitation, distinguishable no
doubt from promiscuous concubinage, and which by rea∣son
of its resemblance to marriage may be thought to par∣ticipate
of the sanctity and innocence of that estate; I
mean the case of <HI>kept mistresses,</HI> under the favourable cir∣cumstance
of mutual fidelity. This case I have heard de∣fended
by some such apology as the following.</P>
<P>“That the marriage rite being different, in different
countries, and in the same country amongst different sects,
and with some, scarce any thing; and moreover not being
prescribed or even mentioned in scripture, can be ac∣counted
of only as of a form and ceremony of human in∣vention:
that consequently, if a man and woman betroth
and confine themselves to each other, their intercourse
must be the same as to all moral purposes, as if they were
legally married; for the addition or omission of a mere
form and ceremony can make no difference in the fight of
God, or in the actual nature of right and wrong.”</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="286"/>
To all which it may be replied,</P>
<P>1. If the situation of the parties be the same thing as
marriage, why do they not marry?</P>
<P>2. If the man chuse to have it in his power to dismiss
the woman at his pleasure, or to retain her in a state of
hu∣miliation
or dependence inconsistent with the rights which
marriage would confer upon her, it is not the same
thing.</P>
<P>3. It is not at any rate the same thing to the children.</P>
<P>Again, as to the marriage rite being a mere form, and
that too, variable, the same may be said of signing and
sealing of bonds, wills, deeds of conveyance, and the like,
which yet make a great difference in the rights and obli∣gations
of the parties concerned in them.</P>
<P>And with respect to the rite not being appointed in
scripture—the scriptures forbid fornication, that is cohabi∣tation
without marriage, leaving it to the law of each
country to pronounce what is, or what makes a marriage,
in like manner as they forbid theft, that is the taking
away of another's property, leaving it to the municipal
law to fix what makes the thing property, or whose it is,
which also, like marriage, depends on arbitrary and mu∣table
forms.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="287"/>
Laying aside the injunctions of scripture, the plain ac∣count
of the question seems to be this: it is immo∣ral,
because it is pernicious, that men and women should co∣habit
without undertaking certain irrevocable obligations
and mutually conferring certain civil rights; if therefore
the law has annexed these rights and obligations to cer∣tain
forms, so that they cannot be secured or undertaken
otherwise, which is the case here (for whatever the par∣ties
may promise to each other, nothing but the marriage
ceremony can make their promise irrevocable) it becomes
in the same degree immoral, that men and women should
cohabit without the interposition of these forms.</P>
<P>If fornication be criminal, all those incentives which
lead to it are accessaries to the crime, as lascivious conver∣sation,
whether expressed in obscene or disguised under
modest phrases, also wanton songs, pictures, books, the
writing publishing and circulating of which, whether out
of frolic, or for some pitiful profit, is productive of so ex∣tensive
a mischief from so mean a temptation, that few
crimes, within the reach of private wickedness, have more
to answer for, or less to plead in their excuse.</P>
<P>Indecent conversation, and by parity of reason all the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Seduction.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>seducer</HI> practices the same stratagems to draw
a woman's person into his power, that a <HI>swindler</HI>
does, to get possession of your goods, or money; yet the
<HI>law of honour,</HI> which abhors deceit, applauds the address of
a successful intrigue: so much is this capricious rule
guided by names, and with such facility does it accom∣modate
itself to the pleasures and convenience of higher
life.</P>
<P>Seduction is seldom accomplished without fraud; and
the fraud is by so much more criminal than other frauds,
as the injury effected by it is greater, continues longer, and
less admits of reparation.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="289"/>
This injury is three-fold, to the woman, to her family,
and to the public.</P>
<P>1. The injury to the woman is made up, of the <HI>misery</HI>
she suffers from shame, of the <HI>loss</HI> she sustains in her re∣putation
and prospects of marriage, and of the <HI>depravation
of her moral principle.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>misery</HI> must be extreme, if we may judge of it from
those barbarous endeavours to conceal their disgrace, to
which women sometimes have recourse; and compare
this barbarity, with their passionate fondness for their off-spring,
in other cases. Nothing but an agony of mind the
most insupportable can induce a woman to forget her na∣ture,
and the pity, which even a stranger would show, to a
helpless and imploring infant. It is true, that all are not
urged to this extremity, but if any are, it affords an indi∣cation
of how much all suffer, from the same cause.
What shall we say to the authors of such mischief?</P>
<P>The <HI>loss</HI> which a woman sustains by the ruin of her re∣putation,
almost exceeds computation. Every person's hap∣piness
depends in part upon the respect and reception they
meet with in the world; and it is no inconsiderable morti∣fication
even to the firmest tempers to be rejected from the
society of their equals, or received there with neglect and
disdain. But this is not all, nor the worst. By a rule of
life, which it is not easy to blame, and impossible to alter,
a woman loses with her chastity the chance of marrying
<PB N="252" REF="290"/>
at all, or in any manner equal to the hopes she had been
accustomed to entertain. Now marriage, whatever it be
to a man, is that, from which every woman expects her
chief happiness. And this is still more true in low life, of
which condition the women are, who are most exposed to
solicitations of this sort. Add to this, that where a wo∣man's
maintenance depends upon her character, as it does,
in a great measure, with those who are to support them∣selves
by service, little sometimes is left to the forsaken
sufferer, but to starve for want of employment, or to have
recourse to prostitution for food and raiment.</P>
<P>As a woman collects her virtue into this point, the loss
of her chastity is generally the <HI>destruction of her moral prin∣ciple;</HI>
and this consequence is to be apprehended, whether
the criminal intercourse be discovered or not.</P>
<P>2. The injury to the family may be understood, by the
application of that infallible rule “of doing to others what
we would that others should do unto us.” Let a father,
or a brother say, for what they would suffer this injury
in a daughter or a sister; and whether any or even a total
loss of fortune, would create equal affliction and distress.
And when they reflect upon this, let them distinguish if
they can, between the robbery of their fortune by fraud
or forgery, and the ruin of their happiness by the treachery
of a Seducer.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="291"/>
3. The public at large lose the benefit of the woman's
service in her proper place and destination, as a wife and
parent. This to the whole community may be little; but
it is often more than all the good, which the seducer does
to the community, can recompense. Moreover, prostitution
is supplied by seduction, and in proportion to the dan∣ger
there is of the woman's betaking herself after her first
sacrifice to a life of public lewdness, the seducer is answer∣able
for the multiplied evils to which his crime gives
birth.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if we pursue the effects of seduction,
through the complicated misery it occasions; and if it be
right to estimate crimes by the mischief they knowingly
produce, it will appear something more than mere invec∣tive
and declamation to assert, that not one half of the
crimes, for which men suffer death, by the laws of this
country, are so flagitious as.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Yet the law, has provided no punishment for this offence beyond a pe∣cuniary satisfaction to the injured family; and this can only be come at, by one of the quaintest fictions in the world, by the father's bringing his action against the seducer, for the loss of his daughter's service, during her pregnancy and nurturing.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Adultery.</HEAD>
<P>A New sufferer is introduced, the injured husband,
who receives a wound in his sensibility and affec∣tions,
the most painful and incurable that human nature
knows. In all other respects, adultery on the part of the
man who solicits the chastity of a married woman, includes
the crime of seduction, and is attended with the same
mischief.</P>
<P>The infidelity of the woman is aggravated, by the cru∣elty
to her children, who are generally involved in their
parents shame, and always made unhappy by their
quarrel.</P>
<P>If it be said that these consequences are chargeable not
so much upon the crime, as the discovery, we answer,
first, that the crime could not be discovered unless it were
committed, and that the commission is never secure from
discovery; and secondly, that if we allow of adulterous
connections, whenever they can hope to escape detection,
which is the conclusion to which this argument conducts
<PB N="255" REF="293"/>
us, we leave the husband no other security for his wife's
chastity, than in her want of opportunity or temptation,
which would probably deter most men from marrying, or
render marriage, a state of jealousy and continual alarm to
the husband; which must end, in the slavery and confine∣ment
of the wife.</P>
<P>The vow, by which married persons mutually engage
their fidelity is “witnessed before God,” and accompanied
with circumstances of solemnity and religion, which ap∣proach
to the nature of an oath. The married offender
therefore incurs a crime little short of perjury, and the se∣duction
of a married woman is little less than subornation
of perjury—and this guilt is independent of the
discovery.</P>
<P>All behaviour, which is designed, or which knowingly
tends, to captivate the affection of a married woman, is a
barbarous intrusion upon the peace and virtue of a family,
though it fall short of adultery.</P>
<P>The usual and only apology for adultery is the prior
transgression of the other party. There are degrees no
doubt in this, as in other crimes; and so far as the bad
effects of adultery are anticipated by the conduct of the
husband or wife who offends first, the guilt of the second
offender is extenuated. But this can never amount to a
justification; unless it could be shewn that the obligation
of the marriage vow depends upon the condition of reci∣procal
<PB N="256" REF="294"/>
fidelity; for which construction, there appears no
foundation, either in expediency, or in the terms of the
promise, or in the design of the legislature which prescribed
the marriage rite. Moreover, the rule contended for by
this plea, has a manifest tendency to multiply the offence,
but none, to reclaim the offender.</P>
<P>The way of considering the offence of one party as a
<HI>provocation</HI> to the other, and the other as only <HI>retaliating</HI>
the injury by repeating the crime, is a childish trifling
with words.</P>
<P>“Thou shalt not commit adultery,” was an interdict
delivered by God himself. By the Jewish law adultery
was capital to both parties in the crime; “Even he that
committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adul∣terer
and adulteress shall surely be put to death,” Lev. xx.
10. which proves, that the divine legislator placed a great
difference between adultery and fornication: and with
this agree the christian scriptures, for in almost all the ca∣talogues
they have left us of crimes, and criminals, they
enumerate “fornication, adultery,” “whoremongers, adul∣terers,”
(Matt. xv. 19. 1 Cor. vi. 9. Gal. v. 9. Heb. xiii. 4.)
by which mention of both, they shew that they did not
consider them as the same; but that the crime of adul∣tery
was, in their apprehension, distinct from, and accu∣mulated
upon that of fornication.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="295"/>
The history of the woman taken in adultery, recorded
in the eighth chapter of <HI>St. John's Gospel,</HI> has been thought
by some to give countenance to that crime. As Christ
told the woman, “neither do <HI>I condemn</HI> thee,” we must
believe, it is said, that he deemed her conduct either not
criminal, or not a crime however of the heinous nature
we represent it to be. A more attentive examination of
the case will, I think, convince us, that nothing can be
concluded from it, as to Christ's opinion concerning adul∣tery,
either one way or the other. The transaction is thus
related. “Early in the morning Jesus came again into
the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he
sat down and taught them; and the Scribes and Pharisees
brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when
they had set her in the midst, they say unto him, Master
this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act; now
Moses in the law commanded that such should be stoned,
but what sayest thou? This they said tempting him, that
they might have to accuse him: but Jesus-stooped down,
and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he
heard them not. So when they continued asking him,
he lift up himself, and said unto them, he that is without
sin amongst you, let him first cast a stone at her; and
again he stooped down and wrote on the ground: and
they which heard it, being convicted by their own con∣science,
went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even
unto the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman
standing in the midst. When Jesus had lift up himself,
and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, woman
<PB N="258" REF="296"/>
where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned
thee? She said unto him, no man, Lord; and, he said unto
her, <HI>neither do I condemn thee,</HI> go and sin no more.”</P>
<P>“This they said tempting him that they might have to
accuse him,” to draw him, that is, into an exercise of ju∣dicial
authority, that they might have to accuse him be∣fore
the Roman governor of usurping or intermeddling
with the civil government. This was their design, and
Christ's behaviour throughout the whole affair proceeded
from a knowledge of this design, and his care to defeat it.
He gives them at first a cold and sullen reception, well suited
to the insidious intention with which they came, “he
stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground,
as though he heard them not.” “When they <HI>continued</HI>
asking him,” when they teased him to speak, he dismissed
them, with a rebuke, which the impertinent malice of
their errand, as well as the secret character of many of
them deserved, “he that is without sin (that is this sin)
among you, let him first cast a stone at her.” This had its
effect. Stung with the reproof, and disappointed of their
aim, they stole away one by one and left Jesus and the
woman alone. And then follows the conversation, which
is the part of the narrative most material to our present
subject. “Jesus saith unto her, woman where are those
thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said
no man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, neither do I con∣demn
thee; go and sin no more.” Now, when Christ
<PB N="259" REF="297"/>
asked the woman “hath no man <HI>condemned</HI> thee” he cer∣tainly
spoke, and was understood by the woman to speak,
of a legal and judicial condemnation; otherwise her an∣swer
“no man, Lord” was not true. In every other
sense of condemnation, as blame, censure, reproof, private
judgment, and the like, many had condemned her; all
those indeed who brought her to Jesus. If then a judi∣cial
sentence was what Christ meant by <HI>condemning</HI>
in the question, the common use of language requires us
to suppose that he meant the same in his reply, “neither
do I condemn thee,” <HI>i. e.</HI> I pretend to no judicial charac∣ter
or authority over thee, it is no office or business of
mine to pronounce or execute the sentence of the law.</P>
<P>When Christ adds “go and sin no more” he in effect
tells her, that she had sinned already, but as to the degree
or quality of the sin, or Christ's opinion concerning, it, no∣thing
is declared, or can be inferred, either way.</P>
<P>Adultery, which was punished with death during the
usurpation, is now regarded by the law of England as only
a civil injury; for which the imperfect satisfaction that
money can afford, may be recovered, by the husband.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Incest.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to preserve chastity in families, and betwixt
persons of different sexes, brought up and living toge∣ther
in the most unreserved intimacy, it is necessary, by
every method possible to inculcate an abhorrence of inces∣tuous
conjunctions; which abhorrence can only be upheld
by the absolute reprobation of all commerce of the sexes
between near relations. Upon this principle the <HI>marriage</HI>
as well as other cohabitation of brothers and sisters, of li∣neal
kindred, and of all who usually live in the same fa∣mily,
may be said to be forbidden by the law of nature.</P>
<P>Restrictions, which extend to remoter degrees of kin∣dred
than this reason makes it necessary to prohibit from
intermarriage, are founded in the authority of the positive
law which ordains them, and can only be justified by their
tendency to diffuse wealth, connect families, or promote
some political advantage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Levitical</HI> law, which is received in this country, and
from which the rule of the <HI>Roman</HI> law differs very little,
<PB N="261" REF="299"/>
prohibits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Roman</HI> law continued the prohibition without limits to the de∣scendants of brothers and sisters. In the <HI>Levitical</HI> or <HI>English</HI> law, there is nothing to hinder a man from marrying his <HI>great</HI> niece.</NOTE> marriage between relations within <HI>three</HI> degrees
of kindred; computing the generations through the com∣mon
ancestor, and accounting affinity the same as con∣sanguinity.
The issue, however, of such marriages are
not bastardized, unless the parents be divorced during their
life-time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> are said to have allowed of the marriage
of brothers and sisters. Amongst the <HI>Athenians</HI> a very
singular regulation prevailed; brothers and sisters of the
half blood, if related by the father's side, might marry; if
by the mother's side, they were prohibited from marrying.
The same custom also probably obtained in Chaldaea so
early as the age in which Abraham left it, for he and Sa∣rah
his wife stood in this relation to each other. “And
yet indeed, she is my sister, she is the daughter of my fa∣ther,
but not of my mother, and she became my wife.”

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Polygamy.</HEAD>
<P>THE equality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This equality is not exact. The number of male infants exceeds that of females in the proportion of nineteen to eighteen, or thereabouts; which exacss provides for the greater consumption of males by war, seafaring, and other dangerous or unhealthy occupations.</NOTE> in the number of males and females
born into the world intimates the intention of God,
that one woman should be assigned to one man; for if to
one man be allowed an exclusive right to five or more wo∣men,
four or more men must be deprived of the exclusive
possession of any: which could never be the order in∣tended.</P>
<P>It seems also a pretty significant indication of the di∣vine
will, that he at first created only one woman to one
man. Had God intended polygamy for the species, it is
probable he would have begun with it; especially as by
giving to Adam more wives than one, the multiplication
of the human race would have proceeded with a quicker
progress.</P>
<P>Polygamy not only violates the constitution of nature,
and the apparent design of the deity, but produces to the
parties themselves, and to the public the following bad ef∣fects—contests
and jealousies amongst the wives of the
same husband—distracted affections, or the loss of all affec∣tion
<PB N="263" REF="301"/>
in the husband himself—a voluptuousness in the rich,
which dissolves the vigour of their intellectual as well as
active faculties, producing that indolence and imbecility
both of mind and body, which have long characterized the
nations of the East—the abasement of one half of the hu∣man
species, who, in countries where polygamy obtains, are
degraded into mere instruments of physical pleasure to the
other half—neglect of children—and the manifold, and
sometimes, unnatural mischiefs, which arise from a scarcity
of women. To compensate for these evils, polygamy does
not offer a single advantage. In the article of population,
which it has been thought to promote, the community
gain nothing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing, I mean, compared with a state in which marriage is nearly universal. Where marriages are less general, and many women unfruitful from the want of husbands, polygamy might at first add a little to population; and but a little: for as a variety of wives would be sought chiefly from temptations of voluptuousness, would rather increase the demand for female beauty, than for the sex at large. And this <HI>little</HI> would soon be made less, by many deductions. For firstly, as none but the opulent can maintain a plurality of wives, where polygamy obtains, the rich indulge in it, whilst the rest take up with a vague and barren incontinency. And secondly, women would grow less jealous of their virtue, when they had nothing for which to reserve it, but a chamber in the <HI>Haram;</HI> when their chastity was no longer to be rewarded with the rights and happiness of a wife, as enjoyed under the marriage of one woman to one man. These considerations may be added to what is mentioned in the text, concerning the easy and early settlement of children in the world.</NOTE>; for the question is, not, whether one man
will have more children by five or more wives than by
one, but whether these five wives would not bear the
<PB N="264" REF="302"/>
same or a greater number of children, to five separate hus∣bands.
And as to the care of the children when produced,
and the sending of them into the world, in situations,
in which they may be likely to form and bring up families
of their own, upon which the increase. and succession
of the human species in a great degree depends; this is less
provided for, and less practicable, where twenty or thirty
children are to be supported by the attention and fortunes
of one father, than if they were divided into five or six
families, to each of which were assigned the industry and
inheritance of two parents.</P>
<P>Whether simultaneous polygamy was permitted by the
law of <HI>Moses,</HI> seems doubtful:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Deut. xvii, 16. xxi, 15.</NOTE> but whether permitted or
not, it was certainly practised by the <HI>Jewish</HI> patriarchs,
both before that law, and under it. The permission, if
there was any, might be, like that of divorce, “for the
hardness of their heart,” in condescension to their esta∣blished
indulgences, rather than from the general recti∣tude
or propriety of the thing itself. The state of man∣ners
in <HI>Judaea</HI> had probably undergone a reformation in this
respect before the time of <HI>Christ;</HI> for, in the New Testa∣ment
we meet with no trace or mention of any such prac∣tice
being tolerated.</P>
<P>For which reason, and because it was likewise forbidden
amongst the Greeks and Romans, we cannot expect to
find any express law upon the subject in the Christian code.
<PB N="265" REF="303"/>
The words of Christ (Matt. xix. 9.) may be construed by
an easy implication to prohibit polygamy;—for, if “who∣ever
putteth away his wife, and <HI>marrieth</HI> another, com∣mitteth
adultery,” he who marrieth another, <HI>without</HI> put∣ting
away the first, is no less guilty of adultery; because
the adultery does not consist in the repudiation of the first
wife, (for however unjust or cruel that may be, it is not
adultery) but in entering into a second marriage, during the
legal existence and obligation of the first. The several
passages in <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s writings, which speak of marriage,
always suppose marriage to signify the union of one man
with one woman. Upon this supposition he argues, (Rom.
vii. 2, 3.) “Know ye not, brethren, for I speak to them
that know the law, how that the law hath dominion
over a man, as long as he liveth; for the woman which
hath an husband, is bound by the law to her husband so
long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is
loosed from the law of her husband; so then if while
her husband liveth she be married to another man, she
shall be called an adulteress.” When the same Apostle
permits marriage to his Corinthian converts (which, “for
the present distress,” he judges to be inconvenient) he re∣strains
the permission to the marriage of one husband with
one wife; “it is good for a man not to touch a woman,
nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his
own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.”</P>
<P>The manners of different countries have varied in no∣thing
more than in their domestic constitutions. Less po∣lished
<PB N="266" REF="304"/>
and more luxurious nations have either not per∣ceived
the bad effects of polygamy, or if they did per∣ceive
them, they who in such countries possessed the
power of reforming the laws, have been unwilling to re∣sign
their own gratifications. Polygamy is retained at this
day among the <HI>Turks,</HI> and throughout every part of <HI>Asia,</HI>
in which Christianity is not pofessed. In Christian coun∣tries
it is universally prohibited. In <HI>Sweden</HI> it is punished
with death. In <HI>England,</HI> beside the nullity of the second
marriage, it subjects the offender to imprisonment and
branding for the first offence, and to capital punishment
for the second. And whatever may be said in behalf of
polygamy, when it is authorised by the law of the land,
the marriage of a second wife, during the life-time of the
first, in countries where such a second marriage is void,
must be ranked with the most dangerous and cruel of those
frauds, by which a woman is cheated out of her fortune,
her person, and her happiness.</P>
<P>The ancient <HI>Medes</HI> compelled their citizens, in one can∣ton,
to take seven wives; in another, each woman to re∣ceive
five husbands: according as war had made, in one
quarter of their country, an extraordinary havock among
the men, or the women had been carried away by an ene∣my
from another. This regulation, so far as it was adapted
to the proportion which subsisted between the numbers
of males and females, was founded in the reason upon
which the most improved nations of <HI>Europe</HI> proceed at pre∣sent.</P>

<P>This power was allowed to the husband, among the

exercised by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Persians.</HI></P>
<P>The congruity of such a right with the law of nature,

<P>And in the first place, it is manifestly inconsistent with
the duty, which the parents owe to their children; which
duty can never be so well fulfilled as by their cohabitation
<PB N="268" REF="306"/>
and united care. It is also incompatible with the right which
the mother possesses, as well as the father, to the grati∣tude
of her children and the comfort of their society;
from both which, she is almost necessarily precluded, by
her dismission from her husband's family.</P>
<P>Where this objection does not interfere, I know of no
principle of the law of nature applicable to the question,
besides that of general expediency.</P>
<P>For, if we say, that arbitrary divorces are excluded by
the terms of the marriage contract, it may be answered,
that the contract might be framed so as to admit of this
condition.</P>
<P>If we argue with some Moralists, that the obligation
of a contract naturally continues, so long as the purpose,
which the contracting parties had in view, requires its con∣tinuance,
it will be hard to say, what purpose of the con∣tract
(the care of children excepted) should confine a man
to a woman, from whom he seeks to be loose.</P>
<P>If we contend with others, that a contract cannot, by
the law of nature, be dissolved, unless the parties be re∣placed
in the situation, which each possessed before the con∣tract
was entered into; we shall find it difficult to prove
this to be an universal or indispensable property of con∣tracts.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="307"/>
I confess myself unable: to assign any circumstance in the
marriage contract, which essentially distinguishes it from
other contracts, or which proves that it contains, what
many have ascribed to it, a natural incapacity of being
dissolved by the consent of the parties; at the option of
one of them, or either of them. But if we trace the
effects of such a rule upon the general happiness of mar∣ried
life, we shall perceive reasons of expediency, that
abundantly justify the policy of those laws, which refuse
to the husband the power of divorce, or restrain it to a
few extreme and specific provocations: and our principles
teach us to pronounce that to be contrary to the law of
nature, which can be proved to be detrimental to the com∣mon
happiness of the species.</P>
<P>A lawgiver, whose counsels were directed by views of
general utility, and obstructed by no local impediment,
would make the marriage contract indissoluble, during the
joint lives of the parties, for the sake of the following ad∣vantages.</P>
<P>I. Because this tends to preserve peace and concord be∣tween
married persons, by perpetuating their common
interest, and by inducing a necessity of mutual compli∣ance.</P>
<P>There is great weight and substance in both these con∣siderations.
An earlier termination of the union would
produce a separate interest. The wife would naturally
<PB N="270" REF="308"/>
look forward to the dissolution of the partnership, and en∣deavour
to draw to herself a fund, against the time when
she was no longer to have access to the same resources.
This would beget peculation on one side, and mistrust on
the other: evils which at present very little disturb the
confidence of married life. The second effect, of making
the union determinable only by death, is not less benefi∣cial.
Adverse tempers, habits, and tastes, must often meet
in marriage. In which case, each party must take pains
to give up what offends, and practise what may gratify the
other. A man and woman in love with each other, do this
insensibly: but love, is neither general nor durable; and
where that is wanting, no lessons of duty, or delicacy of
sentiment, will go half so far with the generality of man∣kind
and womankind, as this one intelligible reflection,
that they must each make the best of their bargain; and
that seeing they must either both be miserable, or both
share in the same happiness, neither can find their own
comfort but in promoting the pleasure of the other. These
compliances, though at first extorted by necessity, become
in time easy and mutual; and, though less endearing,
than assiduities which take their rise from affection, gene∣rally
procure to this married pair, a repose and satisfaction,
sufficient for their happiness.</P>
<P>II. Because new objects of desire would be continually,
sought after, and preferred, if men could, at will, be re∣leased
from their subsisting engagements. Suppose the
husband to have once preferred his wife to all other women,
the duration of this preference cannot be trusted to. Pos∣session
<PB N="271" REF="309"/>
makes a great difference: and there is no other se∣curity
against the invitations of novelty, than the known
impossibility of obtaining the new object. Did the cause,
which brings the different sexes together, hold them to∣gether
by the same force with which it first attracted them
to each other, or could the woman be restored to her per∣sonal
integrity, and to all the advantages of her virgin
estate; the power of divorce might be deposited in the
hands of the husband, with less danger of abuse or in∣conveniency.
But constituted as mankind are, and in∣jured
as the repudiated wife generally must be, it is neces∣sary
to add a stability to the condition of married women,
more secure than the continuance of their husband's af∣fections;
and to supply to both sides, by a sense of duty
and of obligation, what satiety has impaired of passion and
of personal attachment. Upon the whole, the power of
divorce is evidently and greatly to the disadvantage of the
woman; and the only question appears to be, whether the
real or permanent happiness of one half of the species, should be surrendered to the caprice and voluptuousness of
the other?</P>
<P>We have considered divorces as depending upon the will
of the husband, because that is the way in which they have
actually obtained in many parts of the world; but the same
objections apply, in a great degree, to divorces by mutual
consent; especially when we consider the indelicate situa∣tion
and small prospect of happiness, which remains to the
<PB N="272" REF="310"/>
party, who opposed his or her dissent to the liberty and
desires of the other.</P>
<P>The law of nature admits of an exception, in favour of
the injured party, in cases of adultery, of obstinate deser∣tion,
of attempts upon life, of outrageous cruelty, of in∣curable
madness, and, perhaps, of personal imbecillity;
but by no means indulges the same privilege to mere dis∣like,
to opposition of humours and inclinations, to con∣trariety
of taste and temper, to complaints of coldness, ne∣glect,
severity, peevishness, jealousy: not that these rea∣sons
are trivial, but because such objections may always be
alledged, and are impossible by testimony to be ascer∣tained:
so that to allow implicit credit to them, and to
dissolve marriages whenever either party thought fit to
pretend them, would lead in its effect to all the licentious∣ness
of arbitrary divorces.</P>
<P><HI>Milton</HI>'s story is well known. Upon a quarrel with his
wife, he paid his addresses to another woman, and set
forth a public vindication of his conduct, by attempting to
prove, that confirmed dislike was as just a foundation for
dissolving the marriage contract, as adultery; to which
position, and to all the arguments by which it can be sup∣ported,
the above consideration affords a sufficient answer.
And if a married pair, in actual and irreconcileable discord,
complain that their happiness would be better consulted,
by permitting them to determine a connection, which is
become odious to both, It may be told them, that the
<PB N="273" REF="311"/>
same permission, as a general rule, would produce liber∣tinism,
dissension, and misery, amongst thousands, who
are now virtuous, and quiet, and happy, in their condition:
and it ought to satisfy them to reflect, that when their
happiness is sacrificed to the operation of an unrelenting
rule, it is sacrificed to the happiness of the community.</P>
<P>The scriptures seem to have drawn the obligation tighter
than the law of nature left it. “Whosoever, saith <HI>Christ,</HI> shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication,
and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and
whoso marrieth her which is put away, doth commit
adultery.” Matt. xix. 9. The law of <HI>Moses,</HI> for reasons
of local expediency, permitted the <HI>Jewish</HI> husband to put
away his wife; but whether for every cause, or for what
causes, appears to have been controverted amongst the in∣terpreters
of those times. <HI>Christ,</HI> the precepts of whose
religion were calculated for more general use and observa∣tion,
revokes this permission, as given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> “for
the hardness of their hearts,” and promulges a law which
was thenceforward to confine divorces to the single cause
of adultery in the wife. And I see no sufficient reason to
depart from the plain and strict meaning of the words.
The rule was new. It both surprised and offended his dis∣ciples;
yet <HI>Christ</HI> added nothing to relax or explain it.</P>
<P>Inferior causes may justify the separation of husband
and wife, although they will not such a dissolution of
the marriage contract, as would leave either at liberty to
<PB N="274" REF="312"/>
marry again: for it is that liberty in which the danger and
mischief of divorces principally consist. If the care of
children does not require that they should live together,
and it is become, in the serious judgment of both, neces∣sary
for their mutual happiness that they should separate,
let them separate by consent. Nevertheless this necessity
can hardly exist, without guilt and misconduct on one side
or on both. Moreover cruelty, ill usage, extreme violence,
or moroseness of temper, or other great and continued pro∣vocations,
will authorize the injured party to withdraw.
The law which imposes the marriage vow, whereby the
parties promise to “keep each other,” must be understood
to impose it with a silent reservation of these cases; be∣cause
the same law has constituted a judicial relief from the
tyranny of the husband, by the divorce <HI>a mensâ et toro,</HI> and
the provision which it makes for the separate maintenance
of the injured wife. St. <HI>Paul</HI> likewise distinguishes between
a wife's merely separating herself from the family of her
husband, and her marrying again. “Let not the wife
depart from her husband, but, and if she do depart,
let her remain unmarried.”</P>
<P>The law of this country, in conformity to our Sav∣iour's
injunction, confines the dissolution of the marriage
contract, to the single case of adultery, in the wife; and a
divorce in that case can only be brought about by the ope∣ration
of an act of parliament, founded upon a previous
sentence in the spiritual court, and a verdict against the
adulterer at common law; which together compose as
<PB N="275" REF="313"/>
complete an investigation of the complaint as a cause can
receive. It has lately been proposed to the legislature to
annex a clause to these acts, restraining the offending party from marrying with the companion of her crime, who by
the forms of proceeding is always known and convicted;
for there is reason to fear, that adulterous connections are
often formed with the prospect of bringing them to this
conclusion; at least, when the seducer has once captivated
the affection of a married woman, he may avail himself of
this tempting argument to subdue her scruples, and com∣plete
his victory; and the legislature, as the business is
managed at present, assists by its interposition, the crimi∣nal
design of the offenders, and confers a privilege where
it ought to inflict a punishment. The proposal deserved
an experiment; but something more penal, will I appre∣hend
be found necessary, to check the progress of this
alarming depravity. Whether a law might not be framed
directing <HI>the fortune of the adulteress to descend as in case of her
natural death,</HI> reserving however a certain proportion of the
produce of it, by way of annuity for her subsistence, (such
annuity in no case to exceed a certain sum,) and also so far
suspending the estate in the hands of the heir, as to pre∣serve
the inheritance to any children she might bear to a
second marriage, in case there were none to succeed in the
place of their mother by the first; whether, I say, such a
law would not render female virtue in higher life less vin∣cible,
as well as the seducers of that virtue less urgent in
their suit, we recommend to the deliberation of those, who
are willing to attempt the reformation of this important,
<PB N="276" REF="314"/>
but most incorrigible class of the community. A passion
for splendor, for expensive amusements and distinctions,
is commonly found in that description of women who
would become the subjects of such a law, not less inor∣dinate
than their other appetites. A severity of the kind
we propose applies immediately to that passion. And
there is no room for a complaint of injustice, since the
provisions above stated, with others which might be con∣trived,
confine the punishment, so far as it is possible, to
the person of the offender; suffering the estate to remain
to the heir, or within the family of the ancestor from
whom it came, or to attend the appointments of his will.</P>
<P>Sentences of the ecclesiastical courts, which release the
parties <HI>a vinculo matrimonii</HI> by reason of impuberty, frigidi∣ty,
consanguinity within the prohibited degrees, prior mar∣riage,
or want of the requisite consent of parents or guar∣dians,
are not dissolutions of the marriage contract, but
judicial declarations, that there never was any marriage;
such impediment subsisting at the time, as rendered the
celebration of the marriage rite a mere nullity. And the
rite itself contains an exception of these impediments. The
man and woman to be married are charged, “if they know
any impediment why they may not be lawfully joined toge∣ther,
to confess it;” and assured “that so many as are coup∣led
together, otherwise than God's word doth allow, are
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony law∣ful;”
all which is intended by way of solemn notice to the
<PB N="277" REF="315"/>
parties, that the vow they are about to make will bind
their consciences and authorise their cohabitation only upon
the supposition that no legal impediment exist.</P>

<P>WHETHER it hath grown out of some tradition of
the divine appointment of marriage in the persons
of our first parents, or merely from a design to impress the
obligation of the marriage contract with a solemnity suited
to its importance, the marriage rite, in almost all countries
of the world, has been made a religious ceremony,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was not, however, in Christian countries required that marriages should be celebrated in churches 'till the thirteenth century of the christian aera. Marriages in <HI>England</HI> during the usurpation were solemnized before justices of the peace, but for what purpose this novelty was introduced, ex∣cept to degrade the clergy, does not appear</NOTE> al∣though

contract and nothing more.</P>
<P>As to one main article in matrimonial alliances, an al∣teration
has taken place in the fashion of the world; the
<PB N="278" REF="316"/>
wife now brings money to her husband, whereas anciently
the husband paid money to the family of the wife; as was
the case among the <HI>Jewish</HI> patriarchs, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and the
old inhabitants of <HI>Germany.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ancient <HI>Assyrians</HI> sold their <HI>beauties</HI> by an annual auction. The prices were applied by way of portions to the more homely. By this con∣trivance all of both sorts were disposed of in marriage.</NOTE> This alteration has proved
of no small advantage to the female sex; for their impor∣tance
in point of fortune procures to them in modern
times, that assiduity and respect which are wanted to com∣pensate
for the inferiority of their strength, but which
their personal attractions would not always secure.</P>
<P>Our business is with marriage as it is established in this
country. And in treating thereof, it will be necessary to
state in part, the terms of the marriage vow, in order to
discover,</P>
<P>1. What duties this vow creates.</P>
<P>2. What situation of mind at the time is inconsistent
with it.</P>
<P>3. By what subsequent behaviour it is violated.</P>
<P>The husband promises on his part “to love, comfort,
honour and keep his wife;” the wife on her's “to obey,
serve, love, honour, and keep her husband;” in every
<PB N="279" REF="317"/>
variety of health, fortune, and condition; and both stipu∣late
“to forsake all others, and to keep only unto one
another, so long as they both shall live.” This promise
is called the marriage vow; is witnessed before God and
the congregation; accompanied with prayers to Almighty
God for his blessing upon it; and attended with such cir∣cumstances
of devotion and solemnity, as place the obli∣gation
of it, and the guilt of violating it, nearly upon the
same foundation with that of oaths.</P>
<P>The parties by this vow engage their personal fidelity
expressly and specifically—they engage likewise to consult
and promote each other's happiness—the wife, moreover,
promises obedience to her husband. Nature may have
made and left the sexes of the human species nearly equal
in their faculties, and perfectly so in their rights; but to
guard against those competitions which equality, or a con∣tested
superiority is almost sure to produce, the christian
scriptures enjoin upon the wife that obedience which she
here promises, and in terms so peremptory and absolute, that
it seems to extend to every thing not criminal, or not entirely
inconsistent with the woman's happiness. “Let the wife,
(says St. Paul) be subject to her own husband in every
thing.” “The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
(says the same apostle, speaking of the duty of wives), is in the
sight of God of great price.” No words ever ex∣pressed
the true merit of the female character so well as
these.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="318"/>
The condition of human life will not permit us to say,
that no one can conscientiously marry, who does not pre∣fer
the person at the altar, to all other men or women in
the world: but we can have no difficulty in pronouncing,
(whether we respect the end of the institution, or the plain
terms in which the contract is conceived) that whoever is
conscious, at the time of his marriage, of such a dislike
to the woman he is about to marry, or of such a subsisting
attachment to some other woman, that he cannot reasonably,
nor does in fact expect ever to entertain an affection
for his future wife, is guilty, when he pronounces the
marriage vow, of a direct and deliberate prevarication;
and that too, aggravated by the presence of those ideas of
religion, and of the Supreme Being, which the place, the
ritual, and the solemnity of the occasion, cannot fail of
bringing to his thoughts. The same likewise of the wo∣man.
This charge must be imputed to all, who, from
mercenary motives, marry the objects of their aversion
and disgust; and likewise to those who desert, from any
motive whatever, the object of their affection, and, without
being able to subdue that affection, marry another.</P>
<P>The crime of falshood is also incurred by the man, who
intends, at the time of his marriage, to commence, re∣new,
or continue a personal commerce with any other
woman. And the parity of reason, if a wife be capable
of so much guilt, extends to her.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="319"/>
The marriage vow is violated,</P>
<P>I. By adultery.</P>
<P>II. By any behaviour, which, knowingly, renders the
life of the other miserable; as desertion, neglect, prodi∣gality,
drunkenness, peevishness, penuriousness, jealousy,
or any levity of conduct, which may administer occa∣sion
of jealousy.</P>
<P>A late regulation in the law of marriages in this coun∣try,
has made the consent of the father, if he be living,
of the mother, if she survive the father, or of guardians, if
both parents be dead, necessary to the marriage of a per∣son
under twenty-one years of age. By the <HI>Roman</HI> law,
the consent <HI>et avi et patris</HI> was required so long as they
lived. In <HI>France,</HI> the consent of parents is necessary to
the marriage of sons, until they attain to thirty years of
age; of daughters, until twenty-five. In <HI>Holland,</HI> for
sons, 'till twenty-five; for daughters, 'till twenty. And
this distinction between the sexes appears to be well found∣ed,
for a woman seems usually as well qualified at eigh∣teen,
for the domestic and interior duties of a wife or mo∣ther,
as a man is for the business of the world, and the
more arduous care of providing for a family, at twenty-one.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="320"/>
The constitution also of the human species indicates the
same distinction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cum vis prolem procreandi diutius haereat in mare quam in foeminâ, populi numerus nequaquam minuetur, si scriùs venerem colere inceperint viri.</NOTE></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Duty of Parents.</HEAD>
<P>THAT virtue, which confines its beneficence within
the walls of a man's own house, we have been
accustomed to consider as little better than a more refined
selfishness; and yet it will be confessed, that the subject
and matter of this class of duties are inferior to none, in
utility and importance: and where, it may be asked, is
virtue the most valuable, but where it does the most good?
What duty is the most obligatory, but that, on which the
most depends? And where have we happiness and misery
so much in our power, or liable to be so affected by our
conduct, as in our own families? It will also be acknow∣ledged,
that the good order and happiness of the world
is better upheld, whilst each man applies himself to his
own concerns, and the care of his own family, to which
<PB N="283" REF="321"/>
he is present, than if every man, from an excess of mis∣taken
generosity, should leave his own business, to under∣take
his neighbour's, which he must always manage with
less knowledge, conveniency, and success. If therefore
the low estimation of these virtues be well founded, it
must be owing, not to their inferior importance, but to
some defect or impurity in the motive. And indeed it
cannot be denied, but that it is in the power of <HI>association,</HI>
so to unite our children's interest with our own, as that
we shall often pursue both from the same motive, place
both in the same object, and with as little sense of duty in
one pursuit as in the other. Where this is the case, the
judgement above stated, is not far from the truth. And
so often as we find a solicitous care of a man's own family,
in a total absence, or extreme penury of every other virtue,
or interfering with other duties, or directing its operation
solely to the temporal happiness of the children, placing
that happiness in amusement and indulgence, whilst they
are young, or in advancement of fortune, when they grow
up, there is reason to believe that this is the case. In this
way the common opinion concerning these duties may be
accounted for, and defended. If we look to the subject of
them, we perceive them to be indispensable; if we re∣gard
the motive, we find them often not very meritorious.
Wherefore, although a man seldom rises high in our esteem,
who has nothing to recommend him beside the care of his
own family, yet we always condemn the neglect of this
duty with the utmost severity; both by reason of the ma∣nifest
and immediate mischief which we see arising from
<PB N="284" REF="322"/>
this neglect, and because it argues a want not only of pa∣rental
affection, but of those moral principles, which
ought to come in aid of that affection, where it is want∣ing.
And if, on the other hand, our praise and esteem
of these duties be not proportioned to the good they pro∣duce,
or to the indignation with which we resent the ab∣sence
of them, it is for this reason, that virtue is the most
valuable, not where, in strictness, it produces the most
good, but where it is the most wanted; which is not the
case here, because its place is often supplied by instincts,
or involuntary associations. Nevertheless, the offices of
a parent, may be discharged from a consciousness of their
obligation, as well as other duties; and a sense of this
obligation is sometimes necessary to assist the stimulus of
parental affection; especially, in stations of life, in which
the wants of a family cannot be supplied without the con∣tinual
hard labour of the father; nor without his refrain∣ing
from many indulgences and recreations, which un∣married
men, of like condition, are able to purchase.
Where the parental affection is sufficiently strong, or has
fewer difficulties to surmount, a principle of duty may still
be wanted, to direct and regulate its exertions; for other∣wise
it is apt to spend and waste itself in a womanish fond∣ness
for the person of the child; an improvident attention
to his present ease and gratification; a pernicious facility
and compliance with his humours; an excessive and super∣fluous
care to provide the externals of happiness, with
little or no attention to the internal sources of virtue and
satisfaction. Universally, wherever a parent's conduct is
<PB N="285" REF="323"/>
prompted or directed by a sense of duty, there is so much
virtue.</P>
<P>Having premised thus much concerning the place which
parental duties hold in the scale of human virtues, we
proceed to state and explain the duties themselves.</P>
<P>When moralists tell us, that parents are bound to do all
they can for their children, they tell us more than is true;
for, at that rate, every expence which might have been
spared, and every profit omitted, which might have been
made, would be criminal.</P>
<P>The duty of parents has its limits, like other duties;
and admits, if not of perfect precision, at least of rules de∣finite
enough for application.</P>
<P>These rules may be explained under the several heads of
<HI>maintenance, education,</HI> and <HI>a reasonable provision for the child's
happiness,</HI> in respect of outward condition.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> Maintenance.</P>
<P>The wants of children make it necessary that some per∣son
maintain them, and, as no one has a right to burthen
others by his act, it follows, that the parents are bound to
undertake this charge themselves. Beside this plain infe∣rence,
the affection of parents to their children, if it be
instinctive, and the provision which God has prepared in
<PB N="286" REF="324"/>
the person of the mother, for the sustentation of the in∣fant,
concerning the existence and design of which, there
can be no doubt, are manifest indications of the divine
will.</P>
<P>From hence we learn the guilt of those, who run away
from their families, or, what is much the same, in con∣sequence
of idleness or drunkenness throw them upon a
parish; or who leave them destitute at their death, when
by diligence and frugality they might have laid up a pro∣vision
for their support: also of those, who refuse or ne∣glect
the care of their bastard offspring, abandoning them
to a condition in which they must either perish or become
burthensome to others; for the duty of maintenance, like
the reason upon which it is founded, extends to bastards
as well as to legitimate children.</P>
<P>The christian scriptures, although they concern them∣selves
little with maxims of prudence or oeconomy, and
much less authorize worldly mindedness or avarice, have
yet declared in explicit terms their judgement of the obli∣gation
of this duty, “if any provide not for his own, es∣pecially
for those of his own houshold, he hath denied the
faith, and is worse than an infidel,” (1. Tim. v. 8.) he
hath disgraced the christian profession, and fallen short in a
duty which even infidels acknowledge.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Education.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="325"/>
Education, in the most extensive sense of the word,
may comprehend, every preparation that is made in our
youth, for the sequel of our lives: and in this sense, I
use it.</P>
<P>Some such preparation is necessary for children of all
conditions, because without it, they must be miserable, and
probably will be vicious, when they grow up, either from
want of the means of subsistence, or from want of rati∣onal
and inoffensive occupation. In civilized life, every
thing is effected by art and skill. Whence a person who
is provided with neither (and neither can be acquired
without exercise and instruction) will be useless; and he
that is useless, will generally be at the same time mis∣chievous
to the community: so that to send an unedu∣cated
child into the world, is injurious to the rest of man∣kind;
it is little better than to turn out a mad dog, or a
wild beast into the streets.</P>
<P>In the inferior classes of the community, this principle
condemns the neglect of parents, who do not inure their
children betimes to labour and restraint, by providing
them with apprenticeships, services, or other regular em∣ployment;
but suffer them to waste their youth, in idle∣ness
and vagrancy, or to betake themselves to some lazy,
trifling, and precarious calling; for the consequence, of
having thus tasted the sweets of natural liberty, at an age
when their passion and relish for it are at the highest, is,
that they become incapable for the remainder of their lives
<PB N="288" REF="326"/>
of continued industry or persevering attention to any thing;
spend their time, in a miserable struggle between the impor∣tunity
of want, and the irksomeness of regular application;
and are prepared to embrace every expedient, which pre∣sents
a hope, of supplying their necessities, without con∣fining
them to the plough, the loom, the shop, or the
counting-house.</P>
<P>In the middle orders of society, those parents are most
reprehensible, who neither qualify their children for a pro∣fession,
nor enable them to live without one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amongst the Athenians, if the parent did not put his child into a way of getting a livelihood, the child was not bound to make provision for the parent when old and necessitous.</NOTE>: and those
in the highest, who from indolence, indulgence, or ava∣rice,
omit to procure their children those liberal attain∣ments,
which are necessary to make them useful in the
stations, to which they are destined. A man of fortune,
who permits his son to consume the season of education,
in hunting, shooting, or in frequenting horse-races, as∣semblies,
or other unedifying though not vicious diver∣sions,
defrauds the community of a benefactor, and be∣queaths
them a nuisance.</P>
<P>Some, though not the same preparation for the sequei
of their lives, is necessary for youth of every description—and
therefore for bastards, as well as for children of better
expectations. Consequently, they who leave the educa∣tion
of their bastards to chance, contenting themselves
<PB N="289" REF="327"/>
with making provision for their subsistence, desert half
their duty.</P>
<P>III. A reasonable provision for the happiness of a child, in
respect of outward condition, requires three things: a
situation suited to his habits and reasonable expectations;
a competent provision for the exigences of that situa∣tion,
and a probable security for his virtue.</P>
<P>The two first articles will vary with the condition of
the parent. A situation somewhat approaching in rank
and condition to the parent's own; or, where that is not
practicable, similar to what other parents of like condition
provide for their children, bounds the reasonable, as well
as, generally speaking, the actual expectations of the
child, and therefore contains the extent of the parent's ob∣ligation.</P>
<P>Hence, a peasant satisfies his duty, who sends out his
children, properly instructed for their occupation, to hus∣bandry,
or to any branch of manufacture. Clergymen,
lawyers, physicians, officers in the army or navy, gentle∣men
possessing moderate fortunes of inheritance, or exer∣cising
trade in a large or liberal way, are required by the
same rule to provide their sons with learned professions,
commissions in the army or navy, places in public offices,
or reputable branches of merchandise.—Providing a child
with a situation, includes a competent supply for the ex∣pences
of that situation, until the profits of it enable the
<PB N="290" REF="328"/>
child to support himself. Noblemen, and gentlemen of
high rank and fortune, may be bound to transmit an in∣heritance
to the representatives of their family, sufficient
for their support, without the aid of a trade or profession,
to which, there is little hope, that a youth who has been
flattered with other expectations, will apply himself with
diligence or success. In these parts of the world, public
opinion has assorted the members of the community into
four or five general classes; each class comprizing a great
variety of employments and professions; the choice of
which must be committed to the private discretion of the
parent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The health and virtue of a child's future life, are considerations so superior to all others, that whatever is likely to have the smallest influence upon these, deserves a parent's first attention. In respect of health, agri∣culture, and all active, rural, and out-of-door employments, are to be pre∣ferred to manufactures, and sedentary occupations. In respect of virtue, a course of dealings in which the advantage is mutual, in which the profit on one side is connected with the benefit of the other (which is the case in trade, and all serviceable art or labour) is move fa∣vourable to the moral character, than callings, in which one man's gain is another man's loss, in which, what you acquire, is acquired without equivalent, and parted with in distress; as in gaming, and whatever partakes of gaming, and in the predatory profits of war. The following distinctions also deserve notice. A business, like a retail trade, in which the profits are small and frequent, and accruing from the employment, furnishes a moderate and constant engagement to the mind, and so far, suits better with the general disposition of mankind, than pro∣fessions which are supported by fixed salaries, as stations in the church, army, navy, revenue, public offices, &amp;c. or wherein the profits are made in large sums, by a few great concerns, or fortunate adventures; as in many branches of wholesale and foreign merchandize, in which the occu∣pation is neither so constant, nor the activity so kept alive by immediate encouragement. For security, manual arts exceed merchandize, and such as supply the wants of mankind are better than those which minister to their pleasure. Situations which promise an early settlement in marriage, are on many accounts to be chosen before those, which require a longer wait∣ing for a larger establishment.</NOTE> All that can be exacted from parents as a duty,
<PB N="291" REF="329"/>
and therefore the only rule which a moralist can deliver
upon the subject is, that they ehdeavour to preserve their
children in the <HI>class</HI> in which they are born; that is to
say, in which others of similar expectations are accustomed
to be placed, and that they to careful to confine their
hopes and habits of indulgence, to objects which will con∣tinue
to be attainable.</P>
<P>It is an ill-judged thrift in some rich parents, to bring
up their sons to mean employments, for the sake of saving
the charge of a more expensive education; for these sons,
when they become masters of their liberty and fortune,
will hardly continue in occpations, by which they think
themselves degraded; and are seldom qualified for any
thing better.</P>
<P>An attention, in the first place, to the exigencies of the
children's respective conditions in the world; and a regard,
in the second place, to their reasonable expectations, always
postponing the expectations to the exigencies, when both
cannot be satisfied, ought to guide parents in the disposal
of their fortunes after their death. And these exigencies
and expectations must be measured by the standard which
custom has established; for there is a certain appearance,
<PB N="292" REF="330"/>
attendance, establishment, and mode of living, which
custom has annexed to the several ranks and orders of civil
life, (and, which compose what is called <HI>decency</HI>) together
with a certain society, and particular pleasures belonging
to each class; and a young person, who is with-held from
sharing in these, by want of fortune, can scarcely be said
to have a fair chance for happiness: the indignity and mor∣tification
of such a seclusion being what few tempers can
bear, or bear with contentment. And as to the second
consideration, of what a child may reasonably expect from
his parent, he will expect, what he sees all, or most o∣thers,
in similar circumstances receive; and we can hard∣ly
call expectations, unreasonable, which it is impossible to
suppress.</P>
<P>By virtue of this rule, a parent is justified in making a
difference between his children, according as they stand in
greater or less need of the assistance of his fortune, in con∣sequence
of the difference of their age or sex, or of the situ∣ations
in which they are placed, or the various success
which they have met with.</P>
<P>On account of the few lucrative employments which
are left to the female sex, and by consequence the little
opportunity they have of adding to their income, daugh∣ters
ought to be the particular objects of a parent's care
and foresight: and as an option of marriage, from which
they can reasonably expect happiness, is not presented to
every woman who deserves it; especially in the present
<PB N="293" REF="331"/>
times, in which a licentious celibacy, seems to have grown
into fashion with the men, a father should endeavour to
enable his daughters to lead a single life with independen∣cy
and decorum; even though he subtract more for that
purpose, from the portions of his sons, than is agreeable
to modern usage, or than they expect.</P>
<P>But when the exigencies of their several situations are
provided for, and not before, a parent ought to admit the
second consideration, the satisfaction of his children's ex∣pectations;
and upon that principle to prefer the eldest
son to the rest, and sons to daughters: which constitutes.
the right, and the whole right of primogeniture, and the
reason of the preference of one sex to the other. The pre∣ference,
indeed, of the first born has one public good effect,
that if the estate were divided equally amongst the sons,
it would probably make them all idle; whereas, by the
present rule of descent, it makes only one so; which is
the less evil of the two. And it must farther be observed
on the part of sons, that if the rest of the community
make it a rule, to prefer sons to daughters, an individual
of that community ought to guide himself by the same
rule, upon principles of mere equality. For as the son
suffers by the rule, in the fortune he may expect in mar∣riage,
it is but reasonable that he should receive the ad∣vantage
of it in his own inheritance. Indeed, whatever
the rule be, as to the preference of one sex to the other,
marriage restores the equality. And as money is generally
more convertible to profit, and more likely to promote
<PB N="294" REF="332"/>
industry, in the hands of men than women, the custom of
this country may properly be complied with, when it does
not interfere with the weightier reason explained in the
last paragraph.</P>
<P>The point of the children's actual expectations, together
with the expediency of subjecting the illicit commerce of
the sexes to every discouragement it can receive, makes
the difference between the claims of legitimate children
and of bastards. But neither reason will justify, in any
case, the leaving of bastards to the world, without provi∣sion,
education, or profession; or, what is more cruel,
without the means of continuing in the situation to which
the parent has introduced them: which last, is to leave
them to inevitable misery.</P>
<P>After the first requisite, namely, a provision for the ex∣igencies
of his situation is satisfied, a parent may diminish
a child's portion, in order to punish any flagrant crime,
or to punish contumacy and want of filial duty, in in∣stances
not otherwise criminal; for a child, who is con∣scious
of bad behaviour, or of contempt of his parent's
will and happiness, cannot reasonably expect the same
instances of his munificence.</P>
<P>A child's vices may be of that sort, and his vicious ha∣bits
so incorrigible, as to afford much the same reason for
expecting that he will waste or misemploy the fortune put
into his power, as if he were mad or idiotish; in which
<PB N="295" REF="333"/>
case a parent may treat him as a madman or an idiot; that
is, may deem it sufficient to provide for his support, by
an annuity equal to his wants and innocent enjoyments,
and which he may be restrained from alienating. This
seems to be the only case, in which a disinherison, nearly
absolute, is justifiable.</P>
<P>Let not a father hope to excuse an inofficious disposition
of his fortune, by alledging, that “every man may do
what he will with his own.” All the truth which this
expression contains, is, that his discretion is under no con∣troul
of law; and that his will, however capricious, will
be valid. This, by no means, absolves his conscience
from the obligations of a parent, or imports that he may
neglect, without injustice, the several wants and expec∣tations
of his family, in order to gratify a whim, or a
pique; or indulge a preference, founded in no reasonable
distinction of merit or situation. Although, in his inter∣course
with his family, and the lesser endearments of do∣mestic
life, a parent may not always resist his partiality
to a favourite child, (which, however, should he both
avoided and concealed, as oftentimes productive of lasting
jealousies and discontents) yet when he sits down to make
his will, these tendernesses must give, place to more
manly deliberations.</P>
<P>A father of a family is bound to adjust his oeconomy
with a view to these demands upon his fortune; and un∣til
a sufficieney for these ends is acquired, or in due time
<PB N="296" REF="334"/>
<HI>probably</HI> will be acquired, (for, in human affairs <HI>probability</HI> is
enough) frugality and exertions of industry are duties; and
he is justified in declining expensive liberality; for to take
from those who want, in order to give to those who want,
adds nothing to the stock of public happiness.—Thus far,
therefore, and no farther, the plea of “children,” “large
families,” “charity begins at home,” &amp;c. is an excuse for
parsimony, and an answer to those who solicit our bounty.
Beyond this point, as the use of riches becomes less, the
desire of <HI>laying up</HI> should abate proportionably. The truth
is, our children gain less than we imagine, in the chance
of this world's happiness, or even of its external prospe∣rity,
by setting out in it with large capitals. Of those
who die rich, a great part begun with little. And, in
respect of enjoyment, there is no comparison between a
fortune, which a man acquires himself, by a fruitful industry,
or a series of successes in his business, and one
found in his possession, or received from another.</P>
<P>A principal part of a parent's duty is still behind, viz.
the using of proper precautions and expedients, in order
to form and preserve his children's virtue.</P>
<P>To us, who believe, that in one stage or other of our
existence, virtue will conduct to happiness, and vice ter∣minate
in misery; and who observe withal, that men's
virtues and vices are, to a certain degree, produced or af∣fected
by the management of their youth, and the situa∣tions
in which they are placed: to all who attend to these
<PB N="297" REF="335"/>
reasons, the obligation to consult a child's virtue will ap∣pear
to differ in nothing from that, by which the parentis
bound to provide for his maintenance or fortune. The
child's interest is concerned in the one means of happiness,
as well as in the other; and both means are equally, and
almost exclusively, in the parent's power.</P>
<P>The first point to be endeavoured after is, to impress
upon children, the idea of <HI>accountableness,</HI> that is, to ac∣custom
them to look forward to the consequences of their
actions in another world; which can only be brought
about by the parents visibly acting with a view to these
consequences themselves. Parents, to do them justice,
are seldom sparing in lessons of virtue and religion; in ad∣monitions
which cost little, and profit less, whilst their
<HI>example</HI> exhibits a continual contradiction to what they
teach. A father, for instance, will with much solemnity
and apparent earnestness, warn his son against idleness, ex∣cess
in drinking, debauchery, and extravagance, who
himself loiters about all day without employment; comes
home every night drunk; is made infamous in his neigh∣bourhood,
by some profligate connection; and wastes the
fortune which should support or remain a provision for his
family, in riot, or luxury, or ostentation. Or he will dis∣course
gravely before his children of the obligation and
importance of revealed religion, whilst they see frivolous,
and oftentimes feigned excuses detain him from its most
reasonable and solemn ordinances. Or he will set before
them, perhaps, the supreme and tremendous authority of
<PB N="298" REF="336"/>
Almighty God; that such a being ought not to be
named, or even thought upon, without sentiments of awe
and veneration. This may be the lecture he delivers to
his family one hour; when the next, if an occasion arise to
excite his anger, his mirth, or his surprise, they will hear him
treat the name of the Deity with the most irreverent pro∣fanation,
and sport with the terms and denunciations of
the christian religion, as if they were the language of some
ridiculous and long exploded superstition. Now even a
child is not to be imposed upon by such mockery. He
sees through the grimace of this counterfeited concern for
virtue. He discovers that his parent is acting a part; and
receives his admonitions, as he would hear the same max∣ims
from the mouth of a player. And when once this
opinion has taken possession of the child's mind, it has a
fatal effect upon the parent's influence in all subjects; even
in those, in which he himself may be sincere and con∣vinced.
Whereas a silent, but observable regard to the
duties of religion in the parent's own behaviour, will take
a sure and gradual hold of the child's disposition, much
beyond formal reproofs and chidings, which, being gene∣rally
prompted by some present provocation, discover more
of anger than of principle, and are always received with a
temporary alienation and disgust.</P>
<P>A good parent's first care is to be virtuous himself; his
second, to make his virtues as easy and engaging to those
about him, as their nature will admit. Virtue itself of∣fends,
when coupled with forbidding manners. And some
<PB N="299" REF="337"/>
virtues may be urged to such excess, or brought forwards
so unseasonably, as to discourage and repel those, who ob∣serve
and are acted upon by them, instead of exciting an in∣clination
to imitate and adopt them. Young minds in par∣ticular
are liable to these unfortunate impressions. For in∣stance,
if a father's oeconomy degenerate into a minute and
teasing parsimony, it is odds, but that the son, who has
seen and suffered under it, set out a sworn enemy to all
rules of order and frugality. If a father's piety be morose,
rigorous, and tinged with melancholy, perpetually break∣ing
in upon the recreations of his family, and surfeiting
them with the language of religion upon all occasions,
there is danger, lest the son carry from home with him a
settled prejudice against seriousness and religion, as incon∣sistent
with every plan of a pleasurable life, and turn out,
when he mixes with the world, a character of levity or dis∣soluteness.</P>
<P>Something likewise may be done, towards the correc∣ting
or improving of those early inclinations which chil∣dren
discover, by disposing them into situations the least
dangerous to their particular characters.—Thus I would
make choice of a retired life, for young persons addicted
to licentious pleasures; of private stations, for the
proud and passionate; of liberal professions, and a town
life, for the mercenary and sottish: and not, accord∣ing
to the general practice of parents, send dissolute
youths into the army; pernurious tempers to trade; or
make a crafty lad an attorney; or flatter a vain and
<PB N="300" REF="338"/>
haughty temper, with elevated names, or situations, or
callings, to which the fashion of the world has annexed
precedency and distinction, but in which his disposition,
without at all promoting his success, will serve both to
multiply and exasperate his disappointments. In the same
way, that is, with a view to the particular frame and ten∣dency
of the pupil's character, I would make choice of a
public or private education. The reserved, timid, and in∣dolent
will have their faculties called forth, and their
nerves excited and invigorated by a public education. Youths
of strong spirits and passions will be safer in a private edu∣cation.
At our public schools, as far as I have observed,
more literature is acquired, and more vice. Under private
tuition, a moderate proficiency in juvenile learning is sel∣dom
exceeded, but oftener attained.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Rights of Parents.</HEAD>
<P>THE Rights of Parents result from their duties. If
it be the duty of a parent to educate his children,
to form them for a life of usefulness and virtue, provide for
them situations, needful for their subsistence and suited to
their circumstances, and prepare them for those situations;
he has a right to such authority, and, in support of that
authority, to exercise such discipline, as may be necessary
for these purposes. The law of nature acknowledges no
other foundation of a parent's right over his children, be∣sides
his duty towards them. (I speak now of such
rights as may be enforced by coercion.) This relation con∣fers
no property in their persons, or natural dominion over
them, as is commonly supposed.</P>
<P>Since it is, in general, necessary to determine the desti∣nation
of children, before they are capable of judging of
their own happiness, parents have a right to elect pro∣fessions
for them.</P>
<P>As the mother herself owes obedience to the father, her
authority must submit to his. In a competition, therefore,
<PB N="302" REF="340"/>
of commands, the father is to be obeyed. In case of the
death of either, the authority, as well as duty, of both
parents, devolves upon the survivor.</P>
<P>These rights, always following the duty, belong like∣wise
to guardians; and so much of them, as is delegated
by the parents or guardians; belongs to tutors, school∣masters,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>From this principle, “that the rights of parents result
from their duty,” it follows, that parents have no natural
right over the lives of their children, as was absurdly al∣lowed
to <HI>Roman</HI> fathers; nor any to exercise unprofitable
severities; nor to command the commission of crimes:
for these rights can never be wanted for the purposes of
their duty.</P>
<P>Nor, for the same reason, have parents any right to sell
their children into slavery. Upon which, by the way, we
may observe, that the children of slaves are not, by the
law of nature, born slaves; for, as the master's right is
derived to him through the parent, it can never be greater
than the parent's own.</P>
<P>Hence also it appears, that parents not only pervert,
but exceed their just authority, when they consult their
own ambition, interest, or prejudice, at the manifest ex∣pence
of their children's happiness. Of which abuse of
parental power, the following are instances: the shutting
<PB N="303" REF="341"/>
up of daughters and younger sons in nunneries and mona∣steries,
in order to preserve entire the estate and dignity of
the family; or the using of any arts, either of kindness or
unkindness, to induce them to make choice of this way of
life themselves: or in countries, where the clergy are
prohibited from marriage, putting sons into the church
for the same end, who are never likely either to do or re∣ceive
any good in it, sufficient to compensate for this sacri∣fice:
the urging of children to marriages, from which they
are averse, with the view of exalting or enriching the fa∣mily,
or for the sake of connecting estates, parties, or in∣terests;
or the opposing of a marriage, in which the child
would probably find his happiness, from a motive pride,
or avarice, of family hostility, or personal pique.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THe Duty of Children.</HEAD>
<P>The Duty of Children may be considered,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. During childhood.</ITEM>

in their father's family.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. After they have attained to manhood, and have left
their father's family.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> During childhood.</P>
<P>Children must be supposed to have attained to some de∣gree
of discretion before they are capable of any duty.
There is an interval of eight or nine years, between the
dawning, and the maturity of reason, in which it is neces∣sary
to subject the inclination of children to many restraints,
and direct their application to many employments, of the
tendency and use of which they cannot judge; for which
cause, the submission of children, during this period, must
<PB N="305" REF="343"/>
be ready and implicit, with an exception, however, of
any manifest crime, which may be commanded him.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> After they have attained to manhood, but continue in their
father's family.</P>
<P>When children, after they are grown up, voluntarily
continue members of their father's family, besides the ge∣neral
duty of gratitude to their parents, they are bound
to observe such regulations of the family, as the father
shall appoint; contribute their labour to its support,
if required; and confine themselves to such expences as
he shall allow. The obligation would be the same, if
they were admitted into any other family, or received sup∣port
from any other hand.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> After they have attained to manhood, and have left their
father's family.</P>
<P>In this state of the relation, the duty to parents is sim∣ply
the duty of gratitude; not different <HI>in kind,</HI> from that
which we owe to any other benefactor; <HI>in degree,</HI> just so
much exceeding other obligations, by how much a parent
has been a greater benefactor than any other friend. The
services and attentions, by which filial-gratitude may be
testified, can be comprized within no enumeration. It
will shew itself, in compliances with the will of the pa∣rents,
however contrary it be to the child's own taste or
judgment, provided it be neither criminal, nor totally in∣consistent
<PB N="306" REF="344"/>
with his happiness; in a constant endeavour to
promote their enjoyments, prevent their wishes, and soften
their anxieties, in small matters as well as in great; in
assisting them in their business; in contributing to their
support, ease, or better accommodation, when their cir∣cumstances
require it; in affording them our company, in
preference to more amusing engagements; in waiting upon
their sickness or decrepitude; in bearing with the infirmi∣ties
of their health or temper, with the peevishness and
complaints, the unfashionable, negligent, austere manners,
and offensive habits, which often attend upon advanced
years; for, where must old age find indulgence, if it do
not meet with it in the piety and partiality of children?</P>
<P>The most serious contentions between parents and their
children, are those commonly, which relate to marriage,
or the choice of professions.</P>
<P>A parent has, in no case, a right to destroy his child's hap∣piness.
If it be true, therefore, that there exist such personal
and exclusive attachments between individuals of different
sexes, that the possession of a particular man or woman in
marriage, be really necessary to the child's happiness; or
if it be true, that an aversion to a particular profession may
be involuntary and unconquerable; then it will follow,
that parents, where this is the case, ought not to urge
<PB N="307" REF="345"/>
their authority, and that the child is not bound to obe
it.</P>
<P>The point is, to discover how far, in any particular in∣stance,
this <HI>is</HI> the case. Whether the fondness of lovers
ever continues, with such intensity, and so long, that
the success of their desires constitutes, or the disappoint∣ment
affects, any considerable portion of their happiness,
compared with that of their whole life, it is difficult to
say; but there can be no difficulty in saying, that not one
half of those attachments, which young people conceive,
with so much haste and passion, are of this sort. I believe
it also to be true, that there are few aversions to a profes∣sion,
which resolution, perseverance, activity in going
about the duty of it, and above all, despair of changing,
will not subdue: yet there are some such. Wherefore,
a child who respects his parent's judgement, and is tender,
as he ought to be, of his happiness, owes, at least, so
much deference to his will, as to try fairly and faithfully,
in one case, whether time and absence will not quench his
affection? and in the other, whether a longer continuance
in his profession may not reconcile him to it? The whole
depends upon the experiment being made on the child's
part with sincerity; and not merely with a design of com∣passing
his purpose at last, by means of a simulated and
temporary compliance. It is the nature of love and hatred,
and of all violent affections, to delude the mind with a
persuasion, that we shall always continue to feel them, as
we feel them at present. We cannot conceive that they
<PB N="308" REF="346"/>
will either change or cease. Experience of similar or
greater changes in ourselves, or a habit of giving credit to
what our parents, or tutors, or books teach us, may con∣troll
this persuasion; otherwise it renders youth very un∣tractable:
for they see clearly and truly, that it is impos∣sible
they should be happy under the circumstances pro∣posed
to them, in their present state of mind.—After a
sincere, but ineffectual endeavour, by the child, to accom∣modate
his inclination to his parent's pleasure, he ought
not to suffer in his parent's affection, or in his fortunes.
The parent, when he has reasonable proof of this, should
acquiesce: at all events, the child is <HI>then</HI> at liberty to pro∣vide
for his own happiness.</P>
<P>Parents have, on no account, a right to urge their
children upon marriages, to which they are averse; nor
ought, in any shape, to resent the children's disobedience
of such commands. This is a different case from opposing
a match of inclination, because the child's misery is a much
more probable consequence; it being easier to live without
a person that we love, than with one whom we hate. Add
to this, that compulsion in marriage leads to prevarication;
as the reluctant party promises an affection, which neither
exists, nor is expected to take place: and parental, like
all human authority ceases, at the point, where obedience
becomes criminal.</P>
<P>In the abovementioned, and in all contests, between pa∣rents
and children, it is the parent's duty to represent to
<PB N="309" REF="347"/>
the child the consequences of his conduct, and it will be
found his best policy to represent them with fidelity. It
is usual for parents to exaggerate these descriptions beyond
probability, and by exaggeration, to lose all credit with
their children; and thus, in a great measure, to defeat
their own end.</P>
<P>Parents are forbidden to interfere, where a trust is re∣posed
personally in the son; and where, consequently,
the son was expected, and by virtue of that expectation is
obliged, to pursue his own judgement, and not that of
any other; as is the case with judicial magistrates, in the
execution of their office; with members of the legislature
in their votes; with electors, where preference is to be
given to certain prescribed qualifications. The son may
assist his own judgement by the advice of his father, or of
any one whom he chuses to consult: but his Own judge∣ment,
whether it proceed upon knowledge or authority,
ought finally to determine his conduct.</P>
<P>The duty of children to their parents, was thought
worthy to be made the subject of one of the ten command∣ments;
and, as such, is recognised by <HI>Christ,</HI> together
with the rest of the moral precepts of the decalogue, in
various places of the gospel.</P>
<P>The same divine teacher's sentiments, concerning, the
relief of indigent parents, appear sufficiently from that
manly and deserved indignation, with which he reprehend∣ed
<PB N="310" REF="348"/>
the wretched casuistry of the <HI>Jewish</HI> expositors, who,

Upon which two phrases, “this is right,” and “this is
well pleasing unto the Lord,” being used by St. <HI>Paul</HI> in a

<P>THIS division of the subject is merely for the sake of
<HI>method,</HI> by which the writer and the reader are
equally assisted. To the subject itself, it imports nothing;
for the obligation of all duties being fundamentally the
same, it matters little under what class or title any of
them are considered. In strictness, there are few duties or
crimes, which terminate in a man's self; and, so far as
others are affected by their operation, they have been treated
of in some article of the preceding book. We have reserved
to this head the <HI>rights of self-defence;</HI> also the consideration
of <HI>drunkenness</HI> and <HI>suicide,</HI> as offences against that care of
our faculties, and preservation of our person, which we
account duties, and call <HI>duties to ourselves.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Rights of Self-defence.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been asserted, that in a state of nature, we might
lawfully defend the most insignificant right, provided
it were a perfect determinate right, by any extremities,
which the obstinacy of the aggressor made necessary. This
I question; because I question, whether the general rule
be worth sustaining at such an expence, and, apart from
the general consequence of yielding to the attempt, it cannot
be contended, to be for the augmentation of human happi∣ness,
that one man should lose his life or a limb, rather
than another a pennyworth of his property? Neverthe∣less,
perfect rights can only be distinguished by their va∣lue;
and it is impossible to ascertain the value, at which
the liberty of using extreme violence begins. The person
attacked, must balance, as well as he can, between the
general consequence of yielding, and the particular effect
of resistance.</P>
<P>However this right, if it exist in a state of nature, is
suspended by the establishment of civil society; because
<HI>thereby</HI> other remedies are provided against attacks upon
our property, and because it is necessary to the peace and
safety of the community, that the prevention, punish∣ment,
<PB N="313" REF="351"/>
and redress of injuries be adjusted by public laws.
Moreover, as the individual is assisted in the recovery of
his right, or of a compensation for it, by the public strength,
it is no less equitable than expedient, that he should sub∣mit
to public arbitration, the manner, as well as the mea∣sure
of the satisfaction he is to obtain.</P>
<P>There is one case in which all extremeties are justifiable,
namely, when our life is assaulted, and it becomes neces∣sary
for our preservation to kill the assailant. This is evi∣dent
in a state of nature; unless it can be shown, that we
are bound to prefer the aggressor's life to our own, that is
to say, to love our enemy <HI>better than</HI> ourselves, which
can never be a debt of justice, nor any where appears to
be a duty of charity. Nor is the case altered by our living
in civil society; because, by the supposition, the laws of
society cannot interpose to protect us, nor by the nature
of the case compel restitution. This liberty is restrained
to cases, in which no other probable means of preserving
our life remain, as flight, calling for assistance, disarming
the adversary, &amp;c. The rule holds, whether the danger
proceed from a voluntary attack, as by an enemy, robber,
or assassin; or from an involuntary one, as by a madman,
or person sinking in the water, and dragging us after him:
or where two persons are reduced to a situation, in which one
or both of them must perish; as in a ship-wreck, where two
seize upon a plank, which will support only one; though,
to say the truth, these extreme cases, which happen sel∣dom,
and hardly, when they do happen, admit of moral
<PB N="314" REF="352"/>
agency, are scarcely worth mentioning, much less debat∣ing.</P>
<P>The instance, which approaches the nearest to the pre∣servation
of life, and which seems to justify the same ex∣tremities,
is the defence of chastity.</P>
<P>In all other cases, it appears to me the safest; to consi∣der
the taking away of life as authorised by the law of
the land; and the person who takes it away, as in the
situation of a minister or executioner of the law.</P>
<P>In which view, homicide, in <HI>England,</HI> is justifiable:</P>
<P>1. To prevent the commission of a crime, which, when
committed, would be punishable with death. Thus it is
lawful to shoot a highwayman, or one attempting to break
into a house by night; but not by day: which particu∣lar
distinction, by a consent that is remarkable, obtained
also in the <HI>Jewish</HI> law, as well as in the laws both of <HI>Greece</HI>
and <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>2. In necessary endeavours to carry the law into exe∣cution,
as in suppressing riots, apprehending malefactors,
preventing escapes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I do not know, that the law holds forth its authority
to any cases besides those which fall within one or other
of the above descriptions; or that after the exception of
<PB N="315" REF="353"/>
immediate danger to life or chastity, the destruction of a
human being can be innocent without that authority.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Drunkenness.</HEAD>
<P>DRUNKENNESS is either actual or habitual; just as
it is one thing to be drunk, and another to be a
drunkard. What we shall deliver upon the subject, must
principally be understood of a <HI>habit</HI> of intemperance; al∣though
<HI>part</HI> of the guilt and danger described may be ap∣plicable
to casual excesses; and <HI>all</HI> of it, in a certain de∣gree,
forasmuch as every habit is only a repetition of single
instances.</P>
<P>The mischief of drunkenness, from which we are to
compute the guilt of it, consists in the following bad effects:</P>
<P>1. It betrays most constitutions either into extravagan∣cies
of anger, or sins of lewdness.</P>
<P>2. It disqualifies men for the duties of their station, both
by the temporary disorder of their faculties, and at length,
by a constant incapacity and stupefaction.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="354"/>
3. It is attended with expences, which can often be ill
spared.</P>
<P>4. It is sure to occasion uneasiness, to the family of the
drunkard.</P>
<P>5. It shortens life.</P>
<P>To these consequences of drunkenness must be added
the peculiar danger and mischief of the <HI>example.</HI> Drun∣kenness
is a social festive vice; apt, beyond any vice, I
can mention, to draw in others by the example. The
free-drinker collects his circle; the circle naturally spreads;
of those, who are drawn within it, many become the cor∣rupters
and centres of sets and circles of their own; every
one countenancing, and, perhaps, emulating the rest; 'till
a whole neighbourhood, be infested, from the contagion, of
a single example. This account is confirmed by what we
often observe of drunkenness, that it is a <HI>local,</HI> vice; found
to prevail in certain countries, certain districts of a country,
or in particular towns, without any reason to be given for
the fashion, but that it had been introduced by some po∣pular
examples. With this reflection upon the spreading
quality of drunkenness, let us connect a remark which
belongs to the several evil effects above recited. The con∣sequences
of a vice, like the symptoms of a disease, tho'
they be all enumerated in the description, seldom all meet
in the same subject. In the instance under consideration,
the age and temperature of one drunkard, may have little
<PB N="317" REF="355"/>
to fear from inflammations of lust or anger; the fortune
of a second, may not be injured by the expence; a third,
may have no family to be disquieted by his irregularities;
and a fourth, may Possess a constitution fortified against the
poison of strong liquors. But if, as we always ought to
do, we comprehend, within the consequences of our con∣duct,
the mischief and tendency of the example, the above
circumstances, however fortunate for the individual, will
be found to vary the guilt of his intemperance, less pro∣bably,
than he supposes. Although the waste of time
and money may be of small importance to you, it may be
of the utmost to some one or other whom your society
cor∣rupts.
Repeated, or long continued excesses, which hurt
not <HI>your</HI> health, may be fatal to your companion. Al∣though
you have neither wife, nor child, nor parent, to
lament your absence from home, or expect your return to
it with terror; other families, whose husbands and fathers
have been invited to share in your, ebriety, or encouraged
to imitate it, may justly lay their misery or ruin at your
door. This will hold good, whether the person seduced,
be seduced immediately by you, or the vice be propagated
from you to him, through several intermediate examples.
A moralist must assemble all these considerations, to
judge
truly of a vice, which usually meets with milder names,
and more indulgence, than it deserves.</P>
<P>I omit those outrages upon one another, and upon the
peace and safety of the neighbourhood, in which drunken
revels often end; and also those deleterious and maniacal
<PB N="318" REF="356"/>
effects, which strong liquors produce upon particular con∣stitutions;
because, in general propositions concerning
drunkenness; no consequences should be included, but
what are constant enough to be generally expected.</P>
<P>Drunkenness is repeatedly forbidden by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> “Be
not drunk with wine, wherein is excess.” “Let us
walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting and drunken∣ness.”
“Be not deceived, neither fornicators—nor
<HI>drunkards,</HI> nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the
kingdom of God.” <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 18. <HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 13. 1
<HI>Cor.</HI> vi, 9.
10. The. same apostle likewise condemns drunkenness, as
peculiarly inconsistent with the christian profession; “They
that be drunken, are drunken in the night; but let us,
who are of the day, be sober.” 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> v. 7. 8. We
are not concerned with the argument; the words amount
to a prohibition of drunkenness; and the authority is
conclusive.</P>
<P>It is a question of some importance, how far drunken∣ness
is an excuse for the crimes which the drunken person
commits.</P>
<P>In the solution of this question, we will first suppose
the drunken person to be altogether deprived of moral
agency, that is to say, of all reflection and foresight. In
this condition, it is evident, that he is no more capable of
guilt, than a madman; although, like him, he may be
extremely mischievous. The only guilt, with which he
<PB N="318" REF="357"/>
is chargeable, was incurred, when he voluntarily brought
himself into this, situation; And as every man is respon∣sible
for the consequences which he foresaw, or might have
foreseen, and for no other, this guilt will be in proportion
to the probability of such consequences ensuing. From
which principle results the following rule, viz. that the
guilt of any action, in a drunken man, bears the same pro∣portion
to the guilt of the like action, in a sober man,
that the probability of its being the consequence of drun∣kenness,
bears to absolute certainty. By virtue of this
rule, those vices, which are the <HI>known</HI> effects of drunken∣ness,
either in general, or upon particular constitutions,
are, in all, or in men of such constitutions, nearly as cri∣minal,
as if committed with all their faculties and senses
about them.</P>
<P>If the privation of reason be only partial, the guilt will
be of a mixt nature. For so much of his self-government,
as the drunkard retains, he is as responsible then, as at
any other time. He is entitled to no abatement, beyond
the strict proportion, in which, his moral faculties are im∣paired.
Now I call the guilt of the crime, if a sober man
had committed it, the <HI>whole</HI> guilt. A person, in the con∣dition
we describe, incurs part of this, at the instant of per∣petration,
and by bringing himself into this condition, he
incurred such a fraction, of the remaining part, as the dan∣ger
of this consequence was of an integral certainty. For
the sake of illustration, we are at liberty to suppose, that a
man loses half his moral faculties by drunkenness: this
<PB N="320" REF="358"/>
leaving him but half his responsibility, he incurs, when he
commits the action, half of the whole guilt. We will al∣so
suppose that it was known before hand, that it was an
even chance, or half a certainty, that this crime would fol∣low
his getting drunk. This makes him chargeable with
half of the remainder; so that altogether, he is responsible
in three fourths of the guilt, which a sober man would
have incurred by the same action.</P>
<P>I do not mean that any real case can be reduced to num∣bers;
or the calculation made with arithmetical precision:
but these are the principles, and this the rule, by which
our general admeasurement of the guilt of such offences,
should be regulated.</P>
<P>The appetite for intoxicating liquors, appears to me to be
almost always <HI>acquired.</HI> One proof of which is, that it is apt to return only at particular times, and places; as after din∣ner,
in the evening, on the market day, at the market town,
in such a company, at such a tavern. And this may be the
reason, that if a habit of drunkenness be ever overcome, it
is upon some change of place, situation, company, or pro∣fession.
A man sunk deep in a habit of drunkenness, will
upon such occasions as these, when he finds himself
loosened from the associations which held him fast, some∣times
make a plunge, and get out. In a matter of such great
importance, it is well worth while, where it is tolerably
<PB N="321" REF="359"/>
convenient, to change our habitation and society, for the
sake of the experiment.</P>
<P>Habits of drunkenness commonly take their rise, either
from a fondness for and connection with some company,
or some companion, already addicted to this practice;
which affords an almost irresistible invitation to take a share
in the indulgences, which those about us are enjoying with
so much apparent relish and delight: or from want of re∣gular
employment, which is sure to let in many superflu∣ous
cravings, and customs, and often this amongst the
rest: or lastly, from grief or fatigue, both which strongly
solicit that relief, which inebriating liquors administer for
the present; and furnish a specious excuse for complying
with the inclination. But the habit, when once set in,
is continued by different motives from those to which it
owes its origin. Persons addicted to excessive drinking,
suffer, in the intervals of sobriety, and near the return of
their accustomed indulgence, a faintness and oppression
<HI>circa praecordia,</HI> which it exceeds the ordinary patience of
human nature to endure. This is usually relieved, for a
short time, by a repetition of the same excess: and to this
relief, as to the removal of every long continued pain,
they who have once experienced it, are urged almost be∣yond
the power of resistance. This is not all: as the li∣quor
loses its <HI>stimulus,</HI> the dose must be increased, to reach
the same pitch of elevation, or ease; which increase propor∣tionably
accelerates the progress of all the maladies which
drunkenness brings on. Whoever reflects upon the vio∣lence
<PB N="322" REF="360"/>
of the craving, in the advanced stages of the habit,
and the fatal termination to which the gratification of
it leads, will, the moment he perceives the least tendency
in himself of a growing inclination to intemperance, col∣lect
his resolution to this point; or, what, perhaps, he
will find his best security, arm himself with some peremp∣tory
rule, as to the times and quantity of his indulgences.
I own myself a friend to the laying down of rules to our∣selves
of this sort, and rigidly abiding by them. They
may be exclaimed against, as stiff, but they are often salu∣tary.
Indefinite resolutions of abstemiousness, are apt to
yield to <HI>extraordinary</HI> occasions; and <HI>extraordinary</HI> occasions
to occur perpetually. Whereas the stricter the rule is, the
more tenacious we grow of it: and many a man will
abstain, rather than break his rule, who would not easily
be brought to exercise the same mortification, from higher
motives. Not to mention, that when our rule is once
known, we are provided with an answer to every impor∣tunity.</P>
<P>There is a difference, no doubt, between convivial in∣temperance,
and that solitary sottishness, which waits
neither for company nor invitation. But the one, I am
afraid, commonly ends in the other: and this last, is the
basest degradation, to which the faculties and dignity of
human nature can be reduced.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Suicide.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no subject in morality, in which the consi∣deration
of <HI>general consequences</HI> is more necessary, than
in this of suicide. Particular and extreme cases of suicide
may be feigned, and may happen, of which it would be
difficult to assign the particular harm, or demonstrate from
that consideration alone, the guilt. And these cases have
chiefly occasioned confusion and doubtfulness in the ques∣tion.
Albeit, this is no more, than what is sometimes
true, of the most acknowledged vices. I could propose
many possible cases, even of murder, which, if they
were detached from the general rule, and governed by
their own particular consequences alone, it would be no
easy undertaking to prove criminal.</P>
<P>The true question in the argument is no other than this,
may every man who pleases to destroy his life, innocently do
so? Twist, limit, and distinguish the subject, as you can,
it will come at last, to this question.</P>
<P>For, shall we say, that we are then only at liberty to com∣mit
suicide, when we find our continuance in life become
<PB N="324" REF="362"/>
useless to mankind? Any one, who pleases, may make
himself useless; and melancholy minds are prone to think
themselves useless, when they really are not so. Suppose
a law were promulged, allowing each private person to
destroy every man he met, whose longer continuance in
the world he judged to be <HI>useless;</HI> who would not condemn
the latitude of such a rule? Who does not perceive, that it
amounts to a permission to commit murder at pleasure? A
similar rule, regulating the right over our own lives, would
be capable of the same extension. Besides which, no one
is <HI>useless</HI> for the purpose of this plea, but he who has lost
every capacity and opportunity of being useful, together
with the possibility of recovering any degree of either;
which is a state of such complete destitution and despair,
as cannot, I believe, be predicated of any man living.</P>
<P>Or rather, shall we say, that to depart voluntarily out
of life, is lawful for those alone, who leave none to lament
their death? If this consideration is to be taken into the
account at all, the subject of debate will be, not whe∣ther
there are any to sorrow for us, but whether their
sorrow for our death will exceed that which we should
suffer by continuing to live. Now this is a comparison
of things, so indeterminate in their nature, capable of so
different a judgement, and concerning which, the judge∣ment
will differ so much, according to the state of the spi∣rits,
or the pressure of any present anxiety, that it would
vary little in hypocondriacal constitutions, from an un∣qualified
licence to commit suicide, whenever the distresses,
<PB N="325" REF="363"/>
men felt or fancied, rose high enough to overcome the pain
and dread of death. Men are never tempted to destroy
themselves, but when under the oppression of some grie∣vous
uneasiness. The restrictions of the rule, therefore,
ought to apply to these cases. But what effect can we
look for from a rule, which proposes to weigh our own
pain, against that of another; the misery that is felt,
against that which is only conceived; and in so corrupt a
balance as the party's own distempered imagination?</P>
<P>In like manner, whatever other rule you assign, it will
ultimately bring us to an indiscriminate toleration of sui∣cide,
in all cases, in which there is danger of its being
committed.</P>
<P>It remains, therefore, to enquire what would be the
effect of such a toleration: evidently, the loss of many
lives to the community, of which some might be use∣ful
or important; the affliction of <HI>many</HI> families, and
the consternation of <HI>all;</HI> for mankind must live in conti∣nual
alarm for the fate of their friends and dearest relations,
when the restraints of religion and morality are withdrawn;
when every disgust, which is powerful enough to tempt
men to suicide, shall be deemed sufficient to justify it;
and when the follies and vices, as well as the inevitable
calamities of human life, so often make existence a bur∣then.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="364"/>
A second consideration, and perfectly distinct from the
former, is this. By continuing in the world, and the exercise
of those virtues which remain within our power, we retain
the opportunity of meliorating our condition in a future
state. This argument, it is true, does not in strictness prove
suicide a crime, but if it supply a motive to dissuade us from
it, it comes to much the same thing. Now there is no
condition in human life, which is not capable of some
virtue, active or passive. Even piety and resignation
under the sufferings to which we are called, testify a trust
and acquiescence in the divine counsels, more acceptable,
perhaps, than the most prostrate devotion; afford an edi∣fying
example to all who observe them, and may hope
for a recompence among the most arduous of human vir∣tues.
These qualities are always in the power of the mi∣serable;
indeed of none but the miserable.</P>
<P>The two considerations above stated, belong to all cases
of suicide whatever. Besides which general reasons, each
case will be aggravated by its own proper and particular
consequences; by the duties that are deserted; by the
claims that are defrauded; by the loss, affliction, or dis∣grace,
which our death, or the manner of it, causes to
our families, kindred, or friends; by the occasion we
give to many to suspect the sincerity of our moral and re∣ligious
professions, and, together with ours, those of all
others; by the reproach we draw upon our order, calling,
or sect; in a word, by a great variety of evil consequences,
<PB N="327" REF="365"/>
attending upon peculiar situations, with some or other
of which, every actual case of suicide is chargeable.</P>
<P>I refrain from the common topics of “deserting our
post,” “throwing up our trust,” “rushing uncalled into
the presence of our maker,” with some others of the
same sort, not because they are <HI>common,</HI> (for that rather
affords a presumption in their favour) but because I do not
perceive in them much argument, to which an answer
may not easily be given.</P>
<P>Hitherto, we have pursued upon the subject the light
of nature alone, taking into the account, however, the expec∣tation
of a future existence, without which, our reasoning
upon this, as indeed all reasoning upon moral questions,
is vain. We proceed to enquire, whether any thing is to
be met with in scripture, which may add to the probability
of the conclusions we have been endeavouring to support.
And here, I acknowledge, that there is neither any ex∣press
determination of the question to be found, nor suf∣ficient
evidence to prove, that the case of suicide, was in
the contemplation of the law which prohibited murder.
Any inference, therefore, which we deduce from scripture,
can be sustained only by construction and implication;
that is to say, although they, who were authorized to in∣struct
mankind, have not decided a question, which never,
so far as appears to us, came before them; yet, I think,
they have left enough to constitute a presumption, how
<PB N="328" REF="366"/>
they would have decided it, had it ever been proposed or
thought of.</P>
<P>What occurs to this purpose, is contained in the follow∣ing
observations:</P>
<P>1. Human life is spoken of as a <HI>term</HI> assigned or pre∣scribed
to us. “Let us run with patience the race that
is set before us.”—“I have finished my course.”—“That
I may finish my course with joy.”—“You have need of
patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye
might receive the promise.” These expressions appear to
me inconsistent with the opinion, that we are at liberty
to determine the duration of our lives for ourselves. If
this were the case, with what propriety could life be
called a race, <HI>that is set before us,</HI> or what is the same thing,
<HI>“our course;”</HI> that is, the course set out, or appointed to
us? The remaining quotation is equally strong: <HI>that after
ye have done the will of God,</HI> i. e. the duties of life, so long as
God is pleased to continue you in it, “ye might receive
the promises.” According to this interpretation, the text
militates strongly against suicide; and they who reject
this paraphrase, will please to propose a better.</P>
<P>2. There is not one quality, which <HI>Christ</HI> and his apostles
inculcate upon their followers, so often, or so earnestly,
as that of patience under affliction. Now this virtue would
have been in a great measure superseded, and the exhor∣tations
to it might have been spared, if the disciples of
<PB N="329" REF="367"/>
his religion had been at liberty to quit the world, as soon
as they grew weary of the ill usage which they received
in it. When the evils of life pressed sore, they were to
look forward to a “far more exceeding and eternal weight
of glory;” they were to receive them “as the chastening
of the Lord;” as intimations of his care and love: by
these and the like reflections, they were to support and
improve themselves under their sufferings, but not a hint
has any where escaped, of relieving themselves by a vo∣luntary
death. The following text, in particular, strongly
combats all impatience of distress, of which, the greatest
is that which prompts to acts of suicide: “Consider him
that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself,
lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.” I would
offer my comment upon this passage, in these two queries;
first, whether a christian convert, who had been impelled,
by the continuance and urgency of his sufferings, to de∣stroy
his own life, would not have been thought, by the
author of this text, “to have been weary,” “to have
fainted in his mind,” to have fallen off from that example,
which is here proposed to the meditation of christians in
distress? And yet, secondly, whether such an act would
not have been attended with all the circumstances of miti∣gation,
which can excuse or extenuate suicide at this day?</P>
<P>3. The <HI>conduct</HI> of the apostles, and of the christians of
the apostolic age, affords no obscure indication of their
sentiments upon this point. They lived, we are sure, in
a confirmed persuasion of the existence, as well as of the
<PB N="330" REF="368"/>
happiness, of a future state. They experienced in this
world, every extremity of external injury and distress.
To die then was gain. The change, which death brought
with it, was, in their expectation, infinitely beneficial.
Yet it never, that we can find, entered into the intention of
one of them, to hasten this change by an act of suicide;
from which it is difficult to say, what motive could have so
universally with-held them, besides an apprehension of
some unlawfulness in the expedient.</P>
<P>Having stated what we have been able to collect, in op∣position
to the lawfulness of suicide, by way of direct
proof, it seems unnecessary to open a separate controversy
with all the arguments, which are made use of to defend
it; which would only lead us into a repetition of what
has been offered already. The following argument, how∣ever,
being somewhat more artificial and imposing than
the rest, as well as distinct from the general consideration
of the subject, cannot so properly be passed over. If we
deny to the individual, a right over his own life, it seems
impossible, it is said, to reconcile with the law of nature,
that right which the state claims and exercises over the
lives of its subjects, when it ordains or inflicts capital pu∣nishments.
For this right, like all other just authority in
the state, can only be derived from the compact and vir∣tual
consent of the citizens which compose the state; and
it seems self-evident, if any principle in morality be so,
that no one, by his consent, can transfer to another, a
right, which he does not possess himself. It will be
<PB N="331" REF="369"/>
equally difficult to account for the power of the state to
commit its subjects to the dangers of war, and to expose
their lives without scruple in the field of battle; especially
in offensive hostilities, in which the privileges of self-defence
cannot be pleaded with any appearance of truth:
and still more difficult to explain, how in such, or in any
circumstances, prodigality of life can be a virtue, if the
preservation of it, be a duty of our nature.</P>
<P>This whole reasoning sets out from one error, namely, that
the state acquires its right over the life of the subject, from
the subject's own consent, as a part of what originally and per∣sonally
belonged to him, and which he has made over to his
governors. The truth is, the state derives this right, nei∣ther
from the consent of the subject, nor through the me∣dium
of that consent, but, as I may say, immediately
from the donation of the Deity. Finding that such a pow∣er,
in the sovereign of the community, is expedient, if
not necessary for the community itself, it is justly pre∣sumed
to be the will of God, that the sovereign should
possess and exercise it. It is this <HI>presumption</HI> which consti∣tutes
the right, it is the same indeed which constitutes
every other; and if there were the like reasons to autho∣rize
the presumption in the case of private persons, sui∣cide
would be as justifiable as war, or capital executions.
But, until it can be shown, that the power over human
life, may be converted to equal advantage in the hands of
individuals over their own, as in those of the state over
the lives of the subjects, and that it may be entrusted with
<PB N="332" REF="370"/>
equal safety to both, there is no room for arguing from
the existence of such a right in one, to the toleration of
it in the other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Division of these Duties.</HEAD>
<P>IN one sense, every duty is a duty towards God, since it
is his will which makes it a duty: but there are some
duties, of which God is the object, as well as the author;
and these are peculiarly, and in a more appropriated sense,
called <HI>duties towards God.</HI></P>
<P>That silent piety, which consists in a habit of tracing
out the creator's wisdom and goodness, in the objects
<PB N="334" REF="372"/>
about us, or in the history of his dispensations; of refer∣ring
the blessings we enjoy to his bounty, and of resorting
to his succour in our distress, may possibly be more ac∣ceptable
to the Deity, than any visible expressions of de∣votion
whatever. Yet these latter, which, although they
may be excelled, are not superseded by the former, com∣pose
the only part of the subject, which admits of direc∣tion
or disquisition from a moralist.</P>
<P>Our duty towards God, so far as it is external, is di∣vided
into worship and reverence. God is the immediate
object of both: and the difference between them is, that
the one consists in action; the other in forbearance.
When we go to church, on the Lord's day, led thither by
a sense of duty towards God, we perform an act of worship:
when we rest in a journey, upon that day, from the same
motive, we discharge a duty of reverence.</P>
<P>Divine worship is made up of adoration, thanksgiving,
and prayer. But, as what we have to offer concerning
the two former, may be observed of prayer, we shall
make that the title of the following chapters, and the di∣rect
subject of our consideration.</P>

<PB N="335" REF="373"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Duty, and of the Efficacy of Prayer, so far as the same appear, from the Light of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN one man desires to obtain any thing of ano∣ther,
he betakes himself to intreaty: and this
may be observed of mankind in all ages and countries of
the world. Now what is universal, may be called natu∣ral;
and it seems probable, that God, as our supreme
governor, should expect that towards himself, which, by
a natural impulse, or by the irresistible order of our con∣stitution,
he has prompted us to pay to every other being
on whom we depend.</P>
<P>The same may be said of thanksgiving.</P>
<P>Again, prayer is necessary to keep up in the minds of
mankind, a sense of God's agency in the universe, and of
their dependence upon him.</P>
<P>But after all, the duty of prayer depends upon its effi∣cacy
for I confess myself unable to conceive, how any
man can pray, or be obliged to pray, who expects nothing
from his prayer; but is persuaded, at the time he
<PB N="336" REF="374"/>
utters his request, that it cannot possibly produce the
smallest impression upon the being to whom it is addressed,
or advantage to himself. Now the efficacy of prayer im∣ports,
that we obtain something in consequence of pray∣ing,
which we should not have received without prayer;
against all expectation of which, the following objection
has been often and seriously alledged. “If it be most a∣greeable
to perfect wisdom and justice, that we should re∣ceive
what we desire, God, as perfectly, wise and just,
will give it to us without asking: if it be not agreeable to
these attributes of his nature, our intreaties cannot move
him to give it us; and it were impious to expect they
should.” In fewer words, thus; “If what we request,
be fit for us, we shall have it without praying; if it be
not sit for us, we cannot obtain it by praying.” This ob∣jection
admits but of one answer, namely, that it may be
agreeable to perfect wisdom and justice, to grant that to
our prayers, which it would not have been agreeable to
perfect wisdom to have given us without praying for.
But what virtue, you will ask, is there in prayer, which
should make a favour consistent with wisdom, which would
not have been so without it? To this question, which
contains the whole difficulty attending the subject, the
following possibilities are offered in reply.</P>
<P>1. A favour granted to prayer, may be more apt, on
that very account, to produce good effects upon the person
obliged. It may hold in the divine bounty, what experi∣ence
has raised into a proverb in the collation of human
<PB N="337" REF="375"/>
benefits, that what is obtained without asking, is oft-times
received without gratitude.</P>
<P>2. It may be consistent with the wisdom of the Deity, to
with-hold his favours till they be asked for, as an expedient
to encourage devotion in his rational creation, in order
thereby to keep up and circulate a knowledge and sense
of their dependency upon <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>3. Prayer has a natural tendency to amend the petitioner
himself; and thus to bring him within the rules, which the
wisdom of the Deity has prescribed to the dispensation of his
favours.</P>
<P>If these, or any other assignable suppositions, serve to
remove the apparent repugnancy between the success of
prayer, and the character of the Deity, it is enough; for
the question with the petitioner, is not from which, out of
many motives, God may grant his petition, or in what parti∣cular
manner he is moved by the supplications of his crea∣tures;
but whether it be consistent with his nature to be
moved at all, and whether there be any conceivable motives,
which may dispose the divine will to grant the petitioner
what he wants, in consequence of his praying for it. It
is sufficient for the petitioner that he gain his end. It is
not necessary to devotion, perhaps not very consistent with
it, that the circuit of causes, by which his prayers prevail,
should be known to the petitioner, much less that they
should be present to his imagination, at the time. All
that is necessary, is, that there be no impossibility appre∣hended
in the matter.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="376"/>
Thus much must be conceded to the objection; that
prayer cannot reasonably be offered to God with all the same
views, with which we oftentimes address our intreaties to
men (and which views are not commonly or easily sepa∣rated
from it) viz. to inform them of our wants or desires;
to tease them out by importunity; to work upon their
indolence or compassion, to persuade them to do what
they ought to have done before, or ought not to do at all.</P>
<P>But, suppose there existed a prince, who was known by
his subjects to act, of his own accord, always and invari∣ably
for the best, the situation of a petitioner, who soli∣cited
a favor or pardon from such a prince, would suffici∣ciently
resemble our's; and the question with him, as with
us, would be, whether, the character of his prince being
considered, there remained any chance that he should ob∣tain
from him by prayer, what he would not have re∣ceived
without it? I do not conceive, that the character
of such a prince would necessarily exclude the effect of his
subjects prayers; for when that prince reflected, that the
earnestness and humility of his supplication had generated
an the suppliant a frame of mind, upon which the par∣don
or favour asked, would produce a permanent and ac∣tive
sense of gratitude; that the granting of it to his pray∣er,
would put others upon praying to him, and by that means
preserve to him the love and submission of his sub∣jects;
upon which love and submission, their own happi∣ness,
as well as his glory, depended: that besides, that the memory of the particular kindness would be heighten∣ed
and prolonged by the anxiety with which it had been
<PB N="339" REF="377"/>
sued for, prayer having, in other respects, so disposed and
prepared the mind of the petitioner, as to render him ca∣pable
of future services, who before was unqualified for
any: might not that prince, I say, although he proceeded
upon no other considerations, than, the strict rectitude and
expediency of the measure, grant a favour or pardon to
<HI>this man,</HI> which he did not grant to <HI>another,</HI> who was too
proud, too lazy, or too busy, too indifferent whether he
received it or not, or too insensible of the sovereign's ab∣solute
power to give or to with-hold it, ever to ask for it;
or even to the <HI>philosopher,</HI> who, from an opinion of the
fruitlessness of all addresses to a prince of the character
which he had formed to himself, refused himself, and dis∣couraged
in others, all outward returns of gratitude, ac∣knowledgements
of duty, or applications to the sovereign's
mercy or bounty; the disuse of which (seeing affections
do not long subsist, which are never expressed) was follow∣ed
by a decay of loyalty and zeal amongst his subjects, and
threatened to end in a forgetfulness of his rights, and a con∣tempt
of his authority? These, together with other as∣signable
considerations, and some perhaps inscrutable, and
even inconceivable by the persons upon whom his will was
to be exercised, might pass in the mind of the prince,
and move his counsels; whilst nothing, in the mean time,
dwelt in the petitioner's mind, but a sense of his own grief
and wants; of the power and goodness from which alone
he was to look for relief; and of his obligation to endeavour,
by future obedience, to render that being propitious to his
happiness, in whose hands, and at the disposal of whose
mercy, he found himself to be.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="378"/>
The objection to prayer supposes, that a perfectly wise
being must necessarily be inexorable; but where is the
proof, that <HI>inexorability</HI> is any part of perfect wisdom;
especially of that wisdom, which is explained to consist
in bringing about the most beneficial ends by the wisest
means?</P>
<P>The objection likewise assumes another principle, which
is attended with considerable difficulty and obscurity,
namely, that upon every occasion, there is <HI>one,</HI> and only
<HI>one</HI> mode of action <HI>for the best;</HI> and that the divine will is
necessarily determined and confined to that mode: both
which positions presume a knowledge of universal nature,
much beyond what we are capable of attaining. Indeed
when we apply to the divine nature such expressions as
these, “God <HI>must</HI> always do what is right,” “God <HI>can∣not,</HI>
from the moral perfection and necessity of his nature,
act otherwise than for the best,” we ought to apply them
with much indeterminateness and reserve; or rather we
must confess, that there is something in the subject out of
the reach of our apprehension: for to our apprehension, to
be under a necessity of acting according to any rule, is in∣consistent
with free agency; and it makes no difference,
that we can understand, whether the necessity be internal or
external; or that the rule, is the rule of perfect recti∣tude.</P>
<P>But efficacy is ascribed to prayer, without the proof, we are told, which can alone, in such a subject produce con∣viction,
<PB N="341" REF="379"/>
the confirmation of experience. Concerning the
appeal to experience, I shall content myself with this re∣mark,
that if prayer were suffered to disturb the order of
second causes appointed in the universe, too much, or to
produce its effect with the same regularity that they do,
it would introduce a change into human affairs, that in
some important respects would be evidently for the worse.
Who, for example, would labour, if his necessities could
be supplied with equal certainty by prayer? How few
would contain within any bounds of moderation, those pas∣sions
and pleasures, which at present are checked only by
disease or the dread of it, if prayer would infallibly restore
health? In short, if the efficacy of prayer were so con∣stant
and observable as to be relied upon <HI>before hand,</HI> it is
easy to foresee that the conduct of mankind would, in pro∣portion
to that reliance, become careless and disorderly.
It is possible in the nature of things, that our prayers may,
in many instances, be efficacious, and yet our experience
of their efficacy be dubious and obscure. Therefore, if the
light of nature instruct us by any other arguments to hope
for effect from prayer; still more, if the scriptures autho∣rize
these hopes by promises of acceptance; it seems not
a sufficient reason for calling in question the reality of such
effects, that our observations of them are ambiguous: espe∣cially,
since it appears probable, that this very ambiguity
is necessary for the happiness and safety of human life.</P>
<P>But some, whose objections do not exclude all prayer,
are offended with the mode of prayer in use amongst us,
<PB N="342" REF="380"/>
and with many of the subjects, which are almost univer∣sally
introduced into public worship, and recommended to
private devotion. To pray for particular favours by name,
is to dictate, it has been said, to divine wisdom and good∣ness:
to intercede for others, especially for whole nations
and empires, is still worse; it is to presume that we possess
such an interest with the deity, as to be able, by our applica∣tions,
to bend the most important of his counsels; and that the
happiness of others, and even the prosperity of whole com∣munities,
is to depend upon this interest and our choice. Now
how unequal soever our knowledge of the divine oeconomy
may be to the solution of this difficulty which may require a
comprehension of the entire plan, and of all the ends of God's
moral government to explain satisfactorily, we can under∣stand
one thing concerning it, that it is after all, nothing
more, than making one man the instrument of happiness
and misery to another; which is perfectly of a piece with
the course and order, that obtain, and which we must be∣lieve,
were intended to obtain, in human affairs. Why
may we not be assisted by the prayers of other men, who are
beholden to their labour for our support? Why may not
our happiness be made im some cases to depend upon the in∣tercession,
as it certainly does in many upon the good of∣fices,
of our neighbours? The happiness and misery of
great number, we see oftentimes at the disposal of one
man's choice, or liable to be much affected by his conduct,
what greater difficulty is there in supposing, that the pray∣ers
of an individual may avert a calamity from multitudes,
or be accepted to the benefit of whole communities?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Duty and Efficacy of Prayer, as represented in Scrip∣ture.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader will have observed, that the reflections
stated in the preceding chapter, whatever truth
and weight they may be allowed to contain, rise many
of them no higher, than to negative arguments in favour
of the propriety of addressing prayer to God. To prove
that the efficacy of prayers is not inconsistent with the at∣tributes
of the Deity, does not prove that prayers are ac∣tually
efficacious: and in the want of that unequivocal
testimony, which experience alone could afford to this
point, but which we do not possess, and have seen good
reason why we are not to expect, the light of nature leaves
us to controverted probabilities, drawn from the impulse
by which mankind have been almost universally prompted
to devotion, and from some beneficial purposes, which, it
is conceived, may be better answered by the audience of
prayer, than by any other mode of communicating the
same blessings. The revelations which we deem authentic,
completely supply this defect of natural religion. They
require prayer to God as a duty; and they contain positive
assurances of its efficacy and acceptance. We could have
<PB N="344" REF="382"/>
no reasonable motive for the exercise of prayer, without
believing that it may avail to the relief of our wants.
This belief, can only be founded, either in a sensible expe∣rience
of the effect of prayer, or in promises of acceptance,
signified by divine authority. Our knowledge would have
come to us in the former way, less capable, indeed, of
doubt, but subjected to the abuses and inconveniences
briefly described above: in the latter way, that is, by au∣thorized
significations of God's general disposition to hear
and answer the devout supplications of his creatures, we are
encouraged to pray, but not to place such a dependence
upon prayer, as might relax other obligations, or confound
the order of events and human expectations.</P>
<P>The scriptures not only affirm the propriety of prayer
in general, but furnish precepts or examples which justify
some topics and modes of prayer, which have been thought
exceptionable. And as the whole subject rests so much
upon the foundation of scripture, I shall put down at
length texts applicable to the five following heads; to the
duty and efficacy of prayer in general; of prayer for par∣ticular
favours by name; for public national blessings; of
intercession for others; of the repetition of unsuccessful prayers.</P>
<P>Texts injoining prayer in general; “Ask and it shall be
given you, seek and ye sall find”—“If ye, being evil,
know how to give good gifts unto your children, how
much more shall your father which is heaven, give good
<PB N="345" REF="383"/>
things to them that ask him.” “Watch ye therefore,
and <HI>pray always,</HI> that ye may be accounted worthy to
escape all those things that shall come to pass, and to
stand before the son of man.” “Serving the Lord,
rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, <HI>continuing in∣stant
in prayer.”</HI> “Be careful for nothing, but in every
thing <HI>by prayer and supplication,</HI> with thanksgiving, let
your requests be made known unto God.” “I will,
therefore, that men <HI>pray every where,</HI> lifting up holy
hands without wrath and doubting.” “<HI>Pray without
ceasing.</HI>” <HI>Mat.</HI> vii. 7, 9. <HI>Luke</HI> xxi. 36. <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 12.
<HI>Phil.</HI> iv. 6. 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> v. 17. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 8. Add to these, that
Christ's reproof of the ostentation and prolixity of phari∣saical
prayers, and his recommendation to his disciples of
retirement and simplicity in their's, together with his dic∣tating
a particular form of prayer, all presuppose prayer
to be an acceptable and availing service.</P>
<P>Examples of prayer for particular favours by name:
“For this thing (to wit, some bodily infirmity,” which he
calls “a thorn given him in the flesh,”) “I besought the
Lord thrice that it might depart from me.” “Night and
day praying exceedingly, that we <HI>might see your face,</HI> and
perfect that which is lacking in your faith.” 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii.

<P>Directions to pray for national or public blessings:
“<HI>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.”</HI> “Ask ye of the Lord
rain, in the time of the latter rain, so the Lord shall
<PB N="346" REF="384"/>
make bright clouds and give them showers of rain, to
every one grass in the field.” “I exhort therefore
that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and
giving of thanks, be made for all men; for kings and
for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet
and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty; for
this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Sa∣viour.”

thy servants.” “And the Lord repented of the evil
which he thought to do unto his people.” “<HI>Peter</HI>
therefore was kept in prison, but prayer was made with∣out

For the same reason they properly reject the invocation of saints; as also because such invocations suppose in the saints they address, a knowledge which can perceive, at the same time, what passes in different regions of the earth. And they deem it too much to take for granted, without the smallest intimation of such a thing in scrip∣ture, that any created being possesses a faculty little short of that omni∣science and omnipresence which they ascribe to the Deity.</NOTE></P>

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="348" REF="386"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of private Prayer, Family Prayer, and public Worship.</HEAD>
<P>CONCERNING these three descriptions of devotion,
it is first of all to be observed, that they have each
their separate and peculiar use; and therefore, that the
exercise of one species of worship, however regular it be,
does not supersede, or dispense with the obligation of either
of the other two.</P>
<P>I. <HI>Private prayer,</HI> is recommended for the sake of the
following advantages:</P>
<P>Private wants cannot always be made the subjects of
public prayer; but whatever reason there is for praying
at all, there is the same, for making the sore and grief of
each man's own heart the business of his application to
God. This must be the office of private exercises of de∣votion,
being imperfectly, if at all, practicable in any other.</P>
<P>Private prayer, is generally more hearty and in earnest,
than the share we are capable of taking in joint acts of
worship; because it affords leisure and opportunity for the
circumstantial recollection of those personal wants, by the
<PB N="349" REF="387"/>
remembrance and ideas of which, the warmth and ear∣nestness
of prayer is chiefly excited.</P>
<P>Private prayer, in proportion as it is usually accompa∣nied
with more actual thought and reflection of the peti∣tioner's
own, has a greater tendency than other modes of
devotion, to revive and fasten upon the mind the general
impressions of religion. Solitude itself powerfully assists
this effect. When a man finds himself alone, in commu∣nication
with his Creator, his imagination fills with a con∣flux
of aweful ideas concerning the universal agency, and
invisible presence of that being; concerning what is likely to
become of himself; and of the superlative importance of pro∣viding
for the happiness of his future existence, by endea∣vours
to plase <HI>him,</HI> who is the arbiter of his destiny: reflec∣tions,
which, whenever they gain admittance, for a sea∣son
overwhelm all others; and leave, when they depart,
a solemnity upon the thoughts, that will seldom fail, in
some degree, to affect the conduct of life.</P>
<P>Private prayer, thus recommended by its own propriety,
and by advantages not attainable in any form of religious
communion, receives a superior sanction from the autho∣rity
and example of Christ. “When thou prayest, enter
into thy closet; and when thou hast shut thy door,
pray to thy father which is in secret, and thy father
which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.”
“And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went
up into a mountain <HI>apart to pray.” Mat.</HI> vi. 6. xiv. 23.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="388"/>
<HI>II.</HI> Family Prayer.</P>
<P>The peculiar use of family piety consists in its influence
upon servants, and the young members of a family, who
want sufficient seriousness and reflection to retire of their
own accord to the exercise of private devotion, and whose
attention you cannot easily command in public worship.
The example also and authority of a father and master act
in this way with the greatest force; for his private prayers,
to which his children and servants are not witnesses, act
not at all upon them, as examples; and his attendance upon
public worship, they will readily impute to fashion, to a
care to preserve appearances, to a concern for decency and
character, and to many motives besides a sense of duty to
God. Add to this, that forms of public worship, in
proportion as they are more comprehensive, are always
less interesting than family prayers; and that the ardor of
devotion is better supported, and the sympathy more easily
propagated, through a small assembly connected by the af∣fections
of domestic society, than in the presence of a
mixed congregation.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> Public Worship.</P>
<P>If the worship of God be a duty of religion, public
worship is a necessary institution; forasmuch as without
it, the greater part of mankind would exercise no religious
worship at all.</P>

These assemblies afford also, at the same time, oppor∣tunities
for moral and religious instruction to those who
otherwise would receive none. In all protestant, and in
most christian countries, the elements of natural religion,
and the important parts of the evangelic history, are fa∣miliar
to the lowest of the people. This competent degree
and general diffusion of religious knowledge amongst all
orders of christians, which will appear a great thing, when
compared with the intellectual condition of barbarous na∣tions,
can fairly, I think, be ascribed to no other cause,
than the regular establishment of assemblies for divine wor∣ship;
in which, either portions of scripture are recited and
explained, or the principles of christian erudition are so con∣stantly
taught in sermons, incorporated with liturgies, or
expressed in extempore prayer, as to imprint, by the very
repetition, some knowledge and memory of these subjects
upon the most unqualified and careless hearer.</P>
<P>The two reasons above stated, bind all the members of
a community to uphold public worship by their presence
and example, although the helps and opportunities it af∣fords,
may not be necessary to the devotion or edification
of all; and to some may be useless: for it is easily fore∣seen,
how soon religious assemblies would fall into con∣tempt
and disuse, if that class of mankind, who are above
seeking instruction in them, and want not that their own
piety should be assisted by either forms, or society in de∣votion,
were to withdraw their attendance; especially
when it is considered, that all who please, are at liberty to
<PB N="352" REF="390"/>
rank themselves of this class. This argument meets the
following, and the only serious apology that is made for
the absenting of ourselves from public worship. “Surely I
may be excused from going to church, so long as I pray
at home, and have no reason to doubt but that my prayers
are equally acceptable and efficacious in my closet, as in a
cathedral; still less can I think myself obliged to fit thro'
a tedious sermon, in order to hear what is known already,
or better learnt from books, or suggested by meditation.”
They, whose qualifications and habits best supply to them∣selves
all the effect of public ordinances, will be the last
to prefer this excuse, when they reflect upon the <HI>general
consequence</HI> of setting up such an exemption, as well as the
<HI>turn</HI> which is sure to be given in the neighbourhood, to their
absence from public worship. You stay from church, to
employ the sabbath at home in exercises and studies suited
to its proper business: your next neighbour stays from
church, to spend the seventh day less religiously than he
passed any of the six, in a sleepy, stupid rest, or at some
rendezvous of drunkenness and debauchery, and yet thinks
that he is only imitating you, because you both agree in
not going to church. The same consideration should over∣rule
many small scruples, concerning the rigorous proprie∣ty
of some things, which may be contained in the forms,
or admitted into the administration of the public worship
of our communion; for it seems impossible, that even
“two or three should be gathered together,” in any act
of social worship, if each one require from the rest, an
implicit submission to his objections; and no man will at∣tend
<PB N="353" REF="391"/>
upon a religious service, which in any point contra∣dicts
his opinion of truth, or falls short of his ideas of per∣fection.</P>
<P>Beside the direct necessity of public worship to the
greater part of every christian community, supposing wor∣ship
at all to be a christian duty, there are other valuable
advantages growing out of the use of religious assemblies,
without being designed in the institution, or thought of by
the individuals who compose them.</P>
<P>1. Joining in prayer and praises to their common crea∣tor
and governor, has a sensible tendency to unite man∣kind
together, and to cherish and enlarge the generous af∣fections.</P>
<P>So many pathetic reflections are awakened by every ex∣ercise
of social devotion, that most men, I believe, carry
away from public worship a better temper towards the rest
of mankind, than they brought with them. Sprung from
the same extraction, preparing together for the period of all
worldly distinctions, reminded of their mutual infirmities
and common dependency, imploring and receiving sup∣port
and supplies from the same great source of power and
bounty, having all one interest to secure, one Lord to
serve, one judgement, the supreme object to all of their
hopes and fears, to look towards, it is hardly possible, in
this position, to behold mankind as strangers, competitors,
<PB N="354" REF="392"/>
or enemies, or not to regard them, as children of the same
family, assembled before their common parent, and with
some portion of the tenderness which belongs to the most
endearing of our domestic relations. It is not to be ex∣pected,
that any single effect of this kind should be consi∣derable
or lasting; but the frequent return of such senti∣ments,
as the presence of a devout congregation naturally
suggests, will gradually melt down the ruggedness of many
unkind passions, and may generate in time a permanent
and productive benevolence.</P>
<P>2. Assemblies for the purpose of divine worship, placing
men under impressions, by which they are taught to con∣sider
their relation to the Deity, and to contemplate those
around them with a view to that relation, force upon their
thoughts the natural equality of the human species, and
thereby promote humility and condescension in the highest
orders of the community, and inspire the lowest with a
sense of their rights. The distinctions of civil life are al∣most
always insisted upon too much, and urged too far.
Whatever therefore conduces to restore the level, by qua∣lifying
the dispositions which grow out of great elevation or
depression of rank, improves the character on both sides.
Now things are made to appear little, by being placed be∣side
what is great. In which manner, superiorities, which
occupy the whole field of the imagination, will vanish or
shrink to their proper diminutiveness, when compared with
the distance by which even the highest of men are removed
from the supreme Being: and this comparison is naturally
<PB N="355" REF="393"/>
introduced by all acts of joint worship. If ever the poor
man holds up his head, it is at church; if ever the rich
man views him with respect, it is there; and both will be
the better, and the public profited, the oftener they meet
in a situation, in which the consciousness of dignity in the
one is tempered and mitigated, and the spirit of the other
erected and confirmed. We recommend nothing adverse to
subordinations, which are established and necessary; but
that it should be remembered, that subordination itself is
an evil, being an evil to the subordinate, who are the ma∣jority,
and therefore ought not to be carried a tittle be∣yond
what the greater good, the peaceable government of
the community, requires.</P>
<P>The public worship of christians is a duty of divine ap∣pointment.
“Where two or three,” says Christ, “are
gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xviii. 20. Heb. x. 25.</NOTE> This invitation will want nothing of the
force of a command with those, who respect the person
and authority from which it proceeds. Again in the Epistle
to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> “not forsaking the assembling of ourselves
together as the manner of some is,” which reproof seems
as applicable to the desertion of our public worship at this
day, as to the forsaking the religious assemblies of christians
in the age of the apostle. Independently of these passages of
scripture, a disciple of christianity will hardly think himself
at liberty to dispute a practice set on foot by the inspired
preachers of his religion, coeval with its institution, and re∣tained
by every sect into which it has been since divided.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Forms of Prayer in public Worship.</HEAD>
<P>LITURGIES, or preconcerted forms of public devo∣tion,
being neither injoined nor forbidden in scrip∣ture,
there can be no good reason for either receiving
or rejecting them, but that of expediency; which expe∣diency,
is to be gathered from a comparison of the advan∣tages
and disadvantages attending upon this mode of wor∣ship,
with those which usually accompany extemporary
prayer.</P>
<P>The advantages of a liturgy are these:</P>
<P>1. That it prevents absurd, extravagant, or impious ad∣dresses
to God, which the folly and enthusiasm of many,
in an order of men so numerous as the sacerdotal, must
always be in danger of producing, where the conduct of
the public worship is entrusted, without restraint or assist∣ance,
to the discretion and abilities of the officiating minister.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="395"/>
2. That it prevents the <HI>confusion</HI> of extemporary prayer,
in which the congregation, being ignorant of each petition
before they hear it, and having little or no time to join in
it, after they have heard it, are confounded between their
attention to the minister, and to their own devotion. The
devotion of the hearer is necessarily suspended, until a
petition be concluded; and before he can assent to it, or
properly adopt it, that is, before he can address the same
request to God for himself, and from himself, his atten∣tion
is called off to keep pace with what succeeds. Add
to this, that the mind of the hearer is held in continual
expectation, and detained from its proper business, by the
very novelty with which it is gratified. A congregation
may be pleased and affected with the prayers and devotion
of their minister, without joining in them; in like manner
as an audience oftentimes are, with the representation of
devotion upon the stage, who, nevertheless, come away, with∣out
being conscious, or conceiving, that they have exercised
any act of devotion themselves. <HI>Joint prayer,</HI> which is the
duty, and amongst all denominations of christians the
declared design of “coming together,” is prayer in which
all <HI>join;</HI> and not that which one alone in the congregation
conceives and delivers, and of which the rest are merely
hearers. This objection seems fundamental; and holds,
even where the minister's office is discharged with every
possible advantage and accomplishment. The labouring re∣collection,
and embarrassed or tumultuous delivery, of many
extempore speakers, form an additional objection to this
mode of public worship; for these imperfections are very
<PB N="358" REF="396"/>
general, and give great pain to the serious part of a congre∣gation,
as well as afford a profane diversion to the levity
of the other part.</P>
<P>These advantages of a liturgy are connected with two
principal inconveniences; first, that forms of prayer com∣posed
in one age, become unfit for another, by the una∣voidable
change of language, circumstances, and opinions;
secondly, that the perpetual repetition of the same form of
words, produces weariness and inattentiveness in the con∣gregation.
However both these inconveniences are, in
their nature, vincible. Occasional revisions of a liturgy
may obviate the first; and devotion will supply a remedy
for the second. Or they may both subsist in a considerable
degree, and yet be outweighed by the objections which are
inseparable from extemporary prayer.</P>
<P>The Lord's prayer is a precedent, as well as a pattern
for forms of prayer. Our Lord appears, if not to have
prescribed, at least to have authorised the use of fixed forms,
when he complied with the request of the disciple who
said unto him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as <HI>John</HI> also
taught his disciples.” <HI>Luke</HI> xi. 1.</P>
<P>The properties required in a public liturgy, are, that it
be compendious; that it express just conceptions of the
divine attributes; that it recite such wants as the congre∣gation
are likely to feel, and no other; and that it
contain as few contraverted propositions, as may be.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="397"/>
1. That it be compendious.</P>
<P>It were no difficult task, to contract the liturgies of most
churches into half their present compass, and yet retain
every distinct petition, as well the substance of every sen∣timent,
which can be found in them. But brevity may
be studied too much. The composer of a liturgy must not
sit down to his work, with, the hope, that the devotion of
the congregation will be uniformly sustained throughout,
or that every part will be attended to by every hearer. If
this could be depended upon, a very short service would be
sufficient for every purpose that can be answered or de∣signed
by social worship; but seeing the attention of most
men is apt to wander and return, at intervals, and by
starts, he will admit a certain degree of amplification and
repetition, of diversity of expression upon the same subject,
and variety of phrase and form, with little addition to the
sense, to the end that the attention which has been slum∣bering
or absent, during one part of the service, may be
excited and recalled by another; and the assembly kept
together, until it may reasonably be presumed that the
most heedless and inadvertent have performed some act of
devotion, and the most desultory attention been caught by
some part or other of the public service. On the other
hand, the too great length of church services is more un∣favourable
to piety, than almost any fault of composition
can be. It begets in many an early and unconquerable
dislike to the public worship of their country or commu∣nion.
They come to church seldom; and enter the doors
<PB N="360" REF="398"/>
of one, under the apprehension of a tedious attendance, which
they prepare for at first, or soon after relieve, by composing
themselves to a drowsy forgetfulness of the place and duty,
or by sending abroad their thoughts in search of more amusing
occupation. Although there may be some few of a disposition
not to be wearied with religious exercises, yet, where a
ritual is prolix, and the celebration of divine service long,
no effect is, in general, to be looked for, but that indo∣lence
will find in it an excuse, and piety be disconcerted
by impatience.</P>
<P>The length and repetitions complained of in our liturgy,
are not so much the fault of the compilers, as the effect
of uniting into <HI>one</HI> service, what was originally, but with
very little regard to the conveniency of the people, dis∣tributed
into <HI>three.</HI> Notwithstanding that dread of inno∣vation,
which seems to have become the <HI>panic</HI> of the age,
few, I should suppose, would be displeased with such
omissions, abridgements, or change in the arrangement,
as the combination of separate services must needs require,
even supposing each to have been faultless in itself. If to∣gether
with these alterations, the Epistles and Gospels, and
Collects which precede them, were composed and selected
with more regard to unity of subject and design; and the
psalms and lessons, either left to the choice of the minister,
or better accommodated to the capacity of the audience,
and the edification of modern life; the church of <HI>England</HI>
would be in possession of a liturgy, in which those who
assent to her doctrines, would have little to blame, and the
<PB N="361" REF="399"/>
most dissatisfied must acknowledge many beauties. The
stile throughout is excellent; calm, without coldness;
and though every where sedate, oftentimes affecting.
The pauses in the service are disposed at proper intervals.
The transitions from one office of devotion to another,
from confession to prayer, from prayer to thanksgiving,
from thanksgiving to “hearing of the word,” are con∣trived
like scenes in the drama, to supply the mind
with a succession of diversified engagements. As much
variety is introduced also into the form of praying, as this
kind of composition seems capable of admitting. The pray∣er
at one time is continued, at another, broken by responses,
or cast into short alternate ejaculations; and sometimes
the congregation are called upon to take their share in the
service, by being left to complete a sentence which the
minister had begun. The enumeration of human wants
and sufferings in the litany, is almost complete. A chris∣tian
petitioner can have few things to ask or deprecate of
God, which he will not find there expressed, and for the
most part, with inimitable tenderness and simplicity.</P>
<P>II. That it express just conceptions of the divine at∣tributes.</P>
<P>This is an article in which no care can be too great. The
popular notions of God, are formed, in a great measure,
from the accounts which the people receive of his nature
and character, in their religious assemblies. An error here,
becomes the error of multitudes: and as it is a subject, in
<PB N="362" REF="400"/>
which almost every opinion leads the way to some practical
conclusion, the purity or depravation of public manners,
will be affected, amongst other causes, by the truth or
corruption of the public forms of worship.</P>
<P>III. That it recite such wants as the congregation are
likely to feel, and no other.</P>
<P>Of forms of prayer, which offend not egregiously against
truth and decency, that has the most merit, which is best
calculated to keep alive the devotion of the assembly. It were
to be wished therefore, that every part of a liturgy were
personally applicable to every individual in the congrega∣tion;
and that nothing were introduced to interrupt the pas∣sion,
or damp a flame, which it is not easy to rekindle.
Upon this principle, the <HI>state prayers</HI> in our liturgy,
should be fewer and shorter. Whatever may be pre∣tended,
the congregation do not feel that concern in
the subject of these prayers, which must be felt, or ever
prayer be made to God with earnestness. The <HI>state stile</HI>
likewise seems unseasonably introduced into these prayers,
as ill-according with that annihilation of human greatness,
of which, every act, that carries the mind to God, pre∣sents
the idea.</P>
<P>IV. That it contain as few contraverted propositions, as
may be.</P>
<P>We allow to each church the truth of its peculiar tenets,
and all the importance which zeal can ascribe to them.
<PB N="363" REF="401"/>
We dispute not here the right, or the expediency of fram∣ing
creeds, or imposing subscriptions. But why should
every position, which a church maintains, be woven with
so much industry into her forms of public worship? Some
are offended, and some are excluded; this is an evil in it∣self,
at least to <HI>them;</HI> and what advantage or satisfaction
can be derived to the <HI>rest,</HI> from the separation of their bre∣thren,
it is difficult to imagine; unless it were a duty,
to publish our system of polemic divinity, under the name
of making confession of our faith, every time we worship
God; or a sin, to agree in religious exercises with those, from
whom we differ in some religious opinions. Indeed, where
one man thinks it his duty, constantly to worship a being,
whom another cannot, with the assent of his conscience,
permit himself to worship at all, there seems to be no
place for comprehension, or any expedient left, but a quiet
secession. All other differences may be compromised by
silence. If sects and schisms be an evil, they are as much
to be avoided by one side as the other. If sectaries are
blamed for taking unnecessary offence, established churches
are no less culpable for unnecessarily giving it; or bound
at least to produce a command, or a reason of equivalent
utility, for shutting out any from their communion, by
mixing with divine worship, doctrines, whether true or
false, unconnected, in their nature, with devotion.</P>

<PB N="364" REF="402"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Use of Sabbatical Institutions.</HEAD>
<P>AN assembly cannot be collected, unless the time of
assembling be fixed and known before hand; and
if the design of the assembly require, that it be held fre∣quently,
it is easiest that it should return at stated intervals.
This produces a necessity of appropriating set seasons to
the social offices of religion. It is also highly convenient,
that the same seasons be <HI>observed</HI> throughout the country,
that all may be employed, or all at leisure together; for,
if the recess from worldly occupation be not general, one
man's business will perpetually interfere with another man's
devotion; the buyer will be calling at the shop, when the
seller is gone to church. This part, therefore, of the
religious distinction of seasons, namely, a general inter∣mission
of labour and business, during times, previously
set apart for the exercise of public worship, is founded in
the reasons which make public worship itself a duty. But
the celebration of divine service never occupies the whole
day. What remains, therefore, of Sunday, beside the
part of it employed at church, must be considered as a
mere rest from the ordinary occupations of civil life; and
he who would defend the institution, as it is required to
<PB N="365" REF="403"/>
be observed in christian countries, unless he can produce a
command for a <HI>christian sabbath,</HI> must point out the uses of
it in that view.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, that interval of relaxation, which Sunday af∣fords
to the laborious part of mankind, contributes greatly
to the comfort and satisfaction of their lives, both as it re∣freshes
them for the time, and as it relieves their six days
labour, by the prospect of a day of rest always approach∣ing;
which could not be said of <HI>casual</HI> indulgences of lei∣sure
and rest, even were they more frequent, than there is
reason to expect they would be, if left to the discretion or
humanity of interested task-masters. To this difference
between the two, it may be added, that holydays which
come seldom, and unexpected, are unprovided when they
do come, with any duty or employment, and the manner
of spending them being regulated by no public decency or
established usage, they are commonly consumed in rude,
if not criminal pastimes, in a stupid sloth, or brutish in∣temperance.
Whoever considers how much sabbatical in∣stitutions
conduce, in this respect, to the happiness and
civilization of the labouring classes of mankind, and re∣flects
how great a majority of the human species these
classes compose, will acknowledge the utility, whatever
he may believe of the origin of this distinction; and will,
consequently, perceive it to be every man's duty to uphold
the observation of Sunday, when once established, let the
establishment have proceeded from whom, or what autho∣rity
it will.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="404"/>
Nor is there any thing lost to the community by the
intermission of public industry, one day in the week.
For in countries tolerably advanced in population, and the
arts of civil life, there is always enough of human labour,
and to spare. The difficulty is not so much to procure,
as to employ it. The addition of the seventh day's labour
to that of the other six, would have no other effect, than
to reduce the price. The labourer himself, who deserved
and suffered most by the change, would gain nothing.</P>
<P>2. Sunday, by suspending many public diversions, and
the ordinary rotation of employment, leaves to men of all
ranks and professions, sufficient leisure, and not more
than what is sufficient, for both the external offices of
christianity, and the retired, but equally necessary duties
of religious meditation and enquiry. It is true, that many
do not convert their leisure to this purpose; but it is of
moment, and is all which a public constitution can effect,
that to every one be allowed the opportunity.</P>
<P>3. They, whose humanity embraces the whole sensitive
creation, will esteem it no inconsiderable recommendation
of a we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kly return of public rest, that it affords a respite
to the toil of brutes. Nor can we omit to recount this
amongst the uses, which the divine founder of the <HI>Jewish</HI>
sabbath, expressly appointed a law of the institution.</P>
<P>We admit, that none of these reasons show why Sunday
should be preferred to any other day in the week, or one
<PB N="367" REF="405"/>
day in seven, to one day in six or eight; but these points,
which, in their nature, are of arbitrary determination,
being established to our hands, our obligation applies to
the subsisting establishment, so long as we confess, that
some such institution is necessary, and are neither able,
nor attempt to substitute any other in its place.</P>

<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Scripture Account of Sabbatical Institutions.</HEAD>
<P>THE subject, so far as it makes any part of christian
morality, is contained in two questions:</P>
<P>I. Whether the command, by which the <HI>Jewish</HI> sabbath
was instituted, extend to christians?</P>
<P>II. Whether any new command was delivered by Christ;
or any other day substituted in the place of the <HI>Jewish</HI>
sabbath, by the authority or example of his Apostles?</P>
<P>In treating of the first question, it will be necessary to
collect the accounts, which are preserved of the institu∣tion
in the <HI>Jewish</HI> history; for the seeing these accounts
together, and in one point of view, will be the best pre∣paration
<PB N="368" REF="406"/>
for the discussing or judging of any arguments on
one side or the other.</P>
<P>In the second chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> the historian having
concluded his account of the six days creation, proceeds
thus: “And on the seventh day God ended his work
which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day
from all his work which he had made: and God
<HI>blessed</HI> the seventh day, and <HI>sanctified it,</HI> because that in
it he had rested from all his work which God created
and made.” After this, we hear no more of the sabbath,
or of the seventh day, as in any manner distinguished from
the other six, until the history bring us down to the so∣journing
of the <HI>Jews</HI> in the wilderness, when the following
remarkable passage occurs. Upon the complaint of the peo∣ple
for want of food, God was pleased to provide for their
relief by a miraculous supply of manna, which was found
every morning upon the ground about the camp, when
the dew went off, “and they gathered it every morning,
every man according to his eating; and when the sun
waxed hot, it melted: and it came to pass, that on
the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two
omers for one man; and all the rulers of the congre∣gation
came and told <HI>Moses;</HI> and he said unto them,
this is that which the Lord hath said, <HI>tomorrow, is the
rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord,</HI> bake that which ye
will bake, to day, and seethe that ye will seethe, and
that which remaineth over lay up for you, to be kept
until the morning; and they laid it up till the morn∣ing,
<PB N="369" REF="407"/>
as <HI>Moses</HI> bade,” and it did not stink (as it had done
before, when some of them left it till the morning)
“neither was there any worm therein. And <HI>Moses</HI> said,
Eat that to day; <HI>for to day is a sabbath unto the Lord:</HI>
to day ye shall not find it in the field. Six days ye shall
gather it, but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath,
in it there shall be none. And it came to pass, that
there went out some of the people on the seventh day
for to gather, and they found none. And the Lord
said unto <HI>Moses,</HI> how long refuse ye to keep my com∣mandments
and my laws? See, for <HI>that the Lord hath
given you the sabbath,</HI> therefore he giveth you on the sixth
day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his
place, let no man go but of his place on the seventh day,
so the people rested on the seventh day.” <HI>Exodus</HI>
xvi.</P>
<P>Not long after this, the sabbath, as is well known,
was established with great solemnity in the fourth com∣mandment.</P>
<P>Now, in my opinion, the transaction in the wilderness,
above recited, was the first actual institution of the sab∣bath.
For, if the sabbath had been instituted at the time of
the creation, as the words in <HI>Genesis</HI> may seem at first sight
to import, and observed all along, from that time to the
departure of the <HI>Jews</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> a period of about
two thousand five hundred years; it appears unaccountable,
that no mention of it, no occasion of even the obscurest al∣lusion
<PB N="370" REF="408"/>
to it, should occur, neither in the general history of
the world before the call of <HI>Abraham,</HI> which contains, we
admit, only a few memoirs of its early ages, and those
extremely abridged; nor, which is more to be wondered at,
in that of the lives of the three first <HI>Jewish</HI> patriarchs,
which, in many parts of the account, is sufficiently cir∣cumstantial
and domestic. Nor is there, in the passage
above quoted from the sixteenth chapter of <HI>Exodus,</HI> any in∣timation
that the sabbath, then appointed to be observed,
was only the revival of an ancient institution, which had
been neglected, forgotten, or suspended; nor is any such
neglect imputed either to the inhabitants of the old world,
or to any part of the family of <HI>Noah;</HI> nor lastly, is any
permission recorded to dispense with the institution during
the captivity of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> or on any other public
emergency.</P>
<P>The passage in the second chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> which cre∣ates
the whole controversy upon the subject, is not incon∣sistent
with this opinion; for as the seventh day was erected
into a sabbath, on account of God's resting upon that day
from the work of the creation, it was natural enough in
the historian, when he had related the history of the crea∣tion,
and of God's ceasing from it on the seventh day, to
add, “and God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it,
because that on it he had rested from all his work which
God created and made;” although the “blessing” and
“sanctification,” i. e. the religious distinction and appro∣priation
of that day, was not actually made till many
<PB N="371" REF="409"/>
ages afterwards. The words do not assert, that God <HI>then</HI>
“blessed” and “sanctified” the seventh day, but that he
blessed and sanctified it <HI>for that reason;</HI> and if any ask, why
the sabbath, or sanctification of the seventh day, was <HI>then</HI>
mentioned, if it was not <HI>then</HI> appointed, the answer is at
hand, the order of connection, and not of time, intro∣duced
the mention of the sabbath, in the history of the
subject which it was ordained to commemorate.</P>
<P>This interpretation is strongly supported by a passage in
the prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> where the sabbath is plainly spoken
of as <HI>given,</HI> and what else pan that mean, but as <HI>first in∣stituted,</HI>
in the wilderness? “Wherefore I caused them
to go forth out of the land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and brought them
into the wilderness, and I gave them my statutes and
shewed them my judgements, which if a man do, he
shall even live in them; moreover, also <HI>I gave them my
sabbaths,</HI> to be a sign between me and them, that they
might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.”
<HI>Ezek.</HI> xx. 10, 11, 12.</P>
<P><HI>Nehemiah</HI> also recounts the promulgation of the sabbatic
law amongst the transactions in the wilderness; which
supplies another considerable argument in aid of our opi∣nion:
“Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a
cloudy pillar, and in the night by a pillar of fire, to
give them light in the way wherein they should go.
Thou camest down also upon Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> and spakest
with them from heaven, and gavest them right judge∣ments
<PB N="372" REF="410"/>
and true laws, good statutes and commandments,
<HI>and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath,</HI> and com∣mandedst
them precepts, statutes and laws by the hand
of <HI>Moses</HI> thy servant, and gavest them bread from hea∣ven
for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for
them out of the rock.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the mention of the sabbath in so close a connection with the descent of God upon mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> and the delivery of the law from thence, one would be inclined to believe, that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> referred solely to the fourth commandment. But the fourth commandment certainly did not first make known the sabbath. And it is apparent, that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> observed not the order of events, for he speaks of what passed upon mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> before he mentions the miraculous supplies of bread and water, though the <HI>Jews</HI> did not arrive at mount <HI>Sinai</HI> till long after both these miracles were wrought.</NOTE> <HI>Nehem.</HI> ix. 12.</P>
<P>If it be enquired, what duties were appointed for the
<HI>Jewish</HI> sabbath, and under what penalties, and in what
manner it was observed amongst the ancient <HI>Jews;</HI> we
find that, by the fourth commandment, a strict cessation
from work was enjoined, not only upon <HI>Jews</HI> by birth,
or religious profession, but upon all who resided within the
limits of the <HI>Jewish</HI> state; that the same was to be per∣mitted
to their slaves and their cattle; that this rest was
not to be violated under pain of death: “Whosoever
doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be
put to death.” <HI>Ex.</HI> xxxi. 14. Besides which the seventh
day was to be solemnized by double sacrifices in the temple;
“And on the sabbath day <HI>two</HI> lambs of the first year with∣out
spot, and two tenth deals of floor for a meat of∣fering,
<PB N="373" REF="411"/>
mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof,
this is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the
continual burnt offering and his drink offering.” <HI>Numb.</HI>
xxviii. 9, 10. Also holy convocations, or assemblies for
the purpose, we presume, of public worship or religious
instruction, were directed to be held on the sabbath day,
“the seventh day is a sabbath of rest, <HI>an holy convocation.”
Lev.</HI> xxiii. 3.</P>
<P>And accordingly we read, that the sabbath was in fact
observed amongst the <HI>Jews,</HI> by a scrupulous abstinence
from every thing that, by any possible construction, could
be deemed labour; as from dressing meat, from travelling
beyond a sabbath day's journey, or about a single mile.
In the <HI>Maccabean</HI> wars, they suffered a thousand of their
number to be slain, rather than do any thing on the sab∣bath
day, in their own defence. In the final siege of <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI>
after they had so far overcome their scruples, as
to defend their persons when attacked, they refused any
operation on the sabbath day, by which they might have
interrupted the enemy in filling up the trench. After the
establishment of synagogues, (of the origin of which we
have no account) it was the custom to assemble in them
upon the sabbath day, for the purpose of hearing the law
rehearsed and explained, and for the exercise, it is probable,
of public devotion. “For <HI>Moses</HI> of old time hath in
every city, them that preach him, <HI>being read in the syna∣gogues
every sabbath day.</HI>” The seventh day is <HI>Saturday;</HI>
and agreeably to the <HI>Jewish</HI> way of computing the day,
<PB N="374" REF="412"/>
the sabbath held from six o'clock on the Friday evening,
to six o'clock on Saturday afternoon.—These observations
being premised, we approach the main question, "Whe∣ther
the command, by which the <HI>Jewish</HI> sabbath was in∣slituted,
extend to us?</P>
<P>If the divine command was actually delivered at the cre∣ation,
it was addressed, no doubt, to the whole human
species alike, and continues, unless repealed by some sub∣sequent
revelation, binding upon all who come to the
knowledge of it. If the command was published for the
first time in the wilderness, then it was directed to the
<HI>Jewish</HI> people alone; and something farther, either in the
subject, or circumstances of the command, will be ne∣cessary
to show, that it was designed for any other. It is
on this account, that the question concerning the date
of the institution was first to be considered. The former
opinion precludes all debate about the extent of the obliga∣tion;
the latter admits, and, <HI>primâ facie,</HI> induces a be∣lief,
that the sabbath ought to be considered as part of
the peculiar law of the <HI>Jewish</HI> policy.</P>
<P>Which belief receives great confirmation from the fol∣lowing
arguments.</P>
<P>The sabbath is described as a sign between God and the
people of <HI>Israel;</HI> “Wherefore the children of <HI>Israel</HI> shall
keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout
their generations, for a perpetual covenant; <HI>it is a sign
<PB N="375" REF="413"/>
between me and the children of Israel for ever.” Exodus</HI>
xxxi. 16, 17. Again, “And I gave them my statutes
and shewed them my judgements, which, if a man do,
he shall even live in them; <HI>moreover also I gave them
my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them,</HI> that they
might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.”
<HI>Ezek.</HI> xx. 12. Now it does not seem easy to understand
how the sabbath could be a <HI>sign</HI> between God and the
people of <HI>Israel,</HI> unless the observance of it was peculiar
to that people, and designed to be so.</P>
<P>The distinction of the sabbath is, in its nature, as much
a positive ceremonial institution, as that of many other
seasons which were appointed by the levitical law to be kept
holy, and observed by a strict rest; as the first and seventh
days of unleavened bread; the feast of pentecost; the feast
of tabernacles; and in the twenty third chapter of <HI>Exo∣dus,</HI>
the sabbath and these are recited together.</P>
<P>If the command by which the sabbath was instituted,
be binding upon christians, it must bind as to the day,
the duties, and the penalty; in none of which it is re∣ceived.</P>
<P>The observation of the sabbath was not one of the ar∣ticles
enjoined by the Apostles, in the fifteenth chapter of
<HI>Acts,</HI> upon them, “which, from among the Gentiles, were turned unto God.”</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="414"/>
St. <HI>Paul</HI> evidently appears to have considered the sabbath,
as part of the <HI>Jewish</HI> ritual, not binding upon Christians
as such: “Let no man therefore judge you in meat or
in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new
moon, or <HI>of the sabbath days,</HI> which are a shadow of
things to come, but the body is of Christ.” <HI>Col.</HI> ii.
16, 17.</P>
<P>I am aware of only two objections which can be opposed
to the force of these arguments: one is, that the reason
assigned in the fourth commandment for hallowing the
seventh day, namely, “because God rested on the se∣venth
day from the work of the creation,” is a reason
which pertains to all mankind; the other, that the com∣mand,
which injoins the observation of the sabbath, is
inserted in the decalogue, of which all the other precepts
and prohibitions are of moral and universal obligation.</P>
<P>Upon the first objection it may be remarked, that al∣though
in <HI>Exodus</HI> the commandment is founded upon God's
rest from the creation, in <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> the commandment
is repeated with a reference to a different event: “Six
days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the
seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it
thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor
thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-ser∣vant,
nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy
cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates, that
thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well
<PB N="377" REF="415"/>
as thou; and remember that thou wast a servant in the
land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought
thee out thence, through a mighty hand, and by a
stretched-out arm; <HI>therefore</HI> the Lord thy God com∣manded
thee to keep the sabbath day.” It is farther
observable, that God's rest from the creation is proposed
as the reason of the institution, even where the institution
itself is spoken of as peculiar to the Jews:—“Wherefore
the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe
the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpe∣tual
covenant: it is a sign between me and the children
of Israel for ever; <HI>for</HI> in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was
refreshed.” The truth is, these different reasons were
assigned to account for different circumstances in the com∣mand.
If a Jew enquired, why the <HI>seventh day</HI> was sanc∣tified
rather than the sixth or eighth, his law told him
because God rested on the <HI>seventh</HI> day from the creation.
If he asked, why was the same rest indulged to <HI>slaves?</HI>
his law bid him remember, that he also was a <HI>slave</HI> in the
land of Egypt; and “that the Lord his God brought
him out thence.” In this view, the two reasons are per∣fectly
compatible with each other, and with a third end
of the institution, its being a <HI>sign</HI> between God and the
people of Israel; but in this view they determine nothing
concerning the extent of the obligation. If the reason by
its proper energy had constituted a natural obligation,
or if it had been mentioned with a view to the extent of
the obligation, we should submit to the conclusion, that
<PB N="378" REF="416"/>
all were comprehended by the command, who are con∣cerned
in the reason. But the sabbatic rest being a duty
which results from the ordination and authority of a posi∣tive
law, the reason can be alledged no farther than as it
explains the design of the legislator; and if it appear to be
recited with an intentional application to one part of the
law, it can explain his design upon no other.</P>
<P>With respect to the second objection, that inasmuch as
the other nine commandments are confessedly of moral
and universal obligation, it may reasonably be presumed
that this is of the same;—we answer, that this argument
will have little weight, when it is considered, that the
distinction between positive and natural duties, like other
distinctions of modern ethics, was unknown to the simpli∣city
of ancient language; and that there are various pas∣sages
in scripture, in which duties of a political, or cere∣monial,
or positive nature, and confessedly of partial
obligation, are enumerated, and without any mark of dis∣crimination,
along with others which are natural and
universal. Of this the following is an incontestible exam∣ple:
“But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful
and right; and hath not eaten upon the mountains; nor
hath lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of <HI>Israel;</HI> nei∣ther
hath defiled his neighbour's wife; <HI>neither hath come near
to a menstruous woman;</HI> and hath not oppressed any, but
hath restored to the debtor his pledge; hath spoiled
none by violence; hath given his bread to the hungry,
and hath covered the naked with a garment; <HI>he that
<PB N="379" REF="417"/>
hath not given upon usury, neither hath taken any increase;</HI>
that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity; hath exe∣cuted
true judgment between man and man; hath
walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments to
deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the
Lord God.” <HI>Ezek.</HI> xviii. 5—9. The same thing may
be observed of the apostolic decree recorded in the fifteenth
chapter of the <HI>Acts.</HI>—“It seemed good to the Holy Ghost
and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these
necessary things; that ye abstain from meats offered to
idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and
<HI>from fornication:</HI> from which if ye keep yourselves,
ye shall do well.”</P>
<P>II. If the law by which the sabbath was instituted, was
a law only to the <HI>Jews,</HI> it becomes an important question
with the <HI>Christian</HI> enquirer, whether the founder of his re∣ligion
delivered any new command upon the subject; or,
if that should not appear to be the case, whether any day
was appropriated to the service of religion, by the authority
or example of his apostles.</P>
<P>The practice of holding religious assemblies upon the
first day of the week, was so early and universal in the
<HI>Christian</HI> church that it carries with it considerable proof of
having originated from some precept of <HI>Christ</HI> or his apos∣tles,
though none such be now extant. It was upon the
<HI>first</HI> day of the week that the disciples were assembled when
<HI>Christ</HI> first appeared to them after his resurrection; “then
<PB N="380" REF="418"/>
the same day at evening, <HI>being the first day of the week,</HI>
when the doors were shut, where the disciples were as∣sembled,
for fear of the <HI>Jews,</HI> came <HI>Jesus</HI> and stood in
the midst of them.” <HI>John</HI> xx. 19. This, for any thing
that appears in the account, might as to the day have been
accidental: but in the 26th verse of the same chapter we
read that “after eight days,” that is on the <HI>first day</HI> of the
week <HI>following, “again</HI> the disciples were within,” which
second meeting upon the same day of the week looks like
an appointment and design to meet on that particular day.
In the twentieth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles we
find the same custom in a <HI>Christian</HI> church at a great dis∣tance
from <HI>Jerusalem:</HI>—“And we came unto them to
<HI>Troas</HI> in five days, where we abode seven days; and
<HI>upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together
to break bread, Paul</HI> preached unto them.” <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 6,
7. The manner in which the historian mentions “the
disciples coming together to break bread on the <HI>first</HI> day
of the week,” shews, I think, that the practice by this
time was familiar and established. St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Corin∣thians</HI>
writes thus: “Concerning the collection for the
saints, as I have given order to the churches of <HI>Galatia,</HI>
even so do ye; <HI>upon the first day of the week</HI> let every one
of you lay by him in store as God hath prospered him, that
there be no gatherings when I come.” 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> xvi. 1, 2.
Which direction affords a probable proof, that the first day
of the week, was already, amongst the Christians both of
<HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Galatia,</HI> distinguished from the rest, by some
religious application or other. At the time that St. <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="381" REF="419"/>
wrote the book of his revelation, the first day of the week
had obtained the name of the <HI>Lord's day;</HI> I was in the
spirit, says he, <HI>on the Lord's day.</HI> Rev. i. 10. Which name,
and St. <HI>John</HI>'s use of it, sufficiently denote the appropria∣tion
of this day to the service of religion, and that this ap∣propriation
was perfectly known to the churches of <HI>Asia.</HI>
I make no doubt but that by the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>day</HI> was meant
the <HI>first day</HI> of the week; for we find no footsteps of any
distinction of days, which could entitle any other to that
appellation. The subsequent history of Christianity, cor∣responds
with the accounts delivered on this subject, in
scripture.</P>
<P>It will be remembered, that we are contending by these
proofs, for no other duty upon the first day of the week,
than that of holding and frequenting religious assemblies.
A cessation upon that day from labour, beyond the time
of attendance upon public worship, is not intimated in any
passage of the New Testament. Nor did <HI>Christ</HI> or his
Apostles deliver, that we know of, any command to their
disciples for a discontinuance upon that day of the com∣mon
offices of their professions. A reserve which none
will see reason to wonder at, or reproach as a defect in the
institution, who consider that in the primitive condition of
Christianity, the observation of a new sabhath would have
been usless, or inconvenient, or impracticable. During
<HI>Christ</HI>'s personal ministry his religion was preached to the
<HI>Jews</HI> alone. <HI>They</HI> already had a sabbath, which, as citi∣zens
and subjects of that oeconomy, they were obliged to
<PB N="382" REF="420"/>
keep, and did keep. It was not therefore probable that
<HI>Christ</HI> would enjoin another day of rest in conjunction with
this. When the new religion came forth into the world,
and among the Gentiles, few of the converts to it had
their time and labour at their own disposal; and it was
scarcely to be expected, that unbelieving masters and ma∣gistrates,
and they who directed the employment of
others, would permit their slaves and labourers to rest
from their work every seventh day; or that civil govern∣ment,
indeed, would have submitted to the loss of a se∣venth
part of the public industry, and that too in addition
to the numerous festivals which the national religions in∣dulged
to the people: at least this would have been an
incumbrance, which might have greatly retarded the re∣ception
of Christianity in the world. In reality, the insti∣stution
of a weekly sabbath is so connected with the
functions of civil life, and requires so much of the con∣currence
of civil laws in its regulation and support, that
it cannot, perhaps, properly be made the ordinance of any
religion, till that religion be received as the religion of the
state.</P>
<P>The opinion that <HI>Christ</HI> and his Apostles meant to re∣tain
the duties of the <HI>Jewish</HI> sabbath, shifting only the day
from the seventh to the first, seems to prevail without suf∣ficient
proof; nor does any evidence remain in scripture,
(of what, however, is not improbable) that the first day
of the week was thus distinguished in commemoration of
our Lord's resurrection.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="421"/>
The conclusion from the whole enquiry, for it is our
business to follow the arguments to whatever probability
they conduct us, is this: the <HI>assembling</HI> upon the first day of
the week for the purpose of public worship and religious
instruction is a law of Christianity, of divine appointment;
the <HI>resting</HI> on that day from our employments, longer than
we are detained from them by attendance upon these assem∣blies,
is to Christians, an ordinance of human institution;
binding nevertheless upon the conscience of every indivi∣dual
of a country in which a weekly sabbath is established,
for the sake of the beneficial purposes which the public
and regular observation of it promotes; and recommended
perhaps in some degree to the divine approbation, by the
resemblance it bears to what God was pleased to make a
solemn part of the law which he delivered to the people of
<HI>Israel,</HI> and by its subserviency to many of the same uses.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">By what Acts and Omissions, the Duty of the Christian Sabbath is violated.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the obligation upon Christians, to comply with
the religious observation of Sunday, arises, from the
public uses of the institution, and the authority of the
apostolic practice, the <HI>manner</HI> of observing it ought to be
that, which best fulfils <HI>these</HI> uses, and conforms the nearest
to <HI>this</HI> practice.</P>
<P>The uses proposed by the institution are,</P>
<P>1. To facilitate attendance upon public worship.</P>
<P>2. To meliorate the condition of the laborious classes of
mankind, by regular and seasonable returns of rest.</P>
<P>3. By a general suspension of business and amusement, to
invite and enable persons of every description, to apply their
time and thoughts, to subjects appertaining to their salvation.</P>
<P>With the primitive Christians the peculiar, and proba∣bly
for some time the only distinction of the first day of
the week, was the holding of religious assemblies upon that
<PB N="385" REF="423"/>
day. We learn, however, from the testimony of a very
early writer amongst them, that they also reserved the day
for religious meditations. <HI>Unusquisque nostrûm,</HI> saith <HI>Irenaeus,
sabbatizat spiritualiter, meditatione legis gaudens, opificium Dei
admirans.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREFORE the duty of the day is violated;</P>
<P>1st. By all such employments or engagements, as
(though differing from our ordinary occupation) hinder
our attendance upon public worship, or take up so much
of our time, as not to leave a sufficient part of the day at
leisure for religious reflection; as going journeys, paying
or receiving visits which engage the whole day, or em∣ploying
the time at home in writing letters, settling ac∣counts,
reading books, or applying ourselves to studies,
which bear no relation to the business of religion.</P>
<P>2dly. By unnecessary encroachments upon the rest and
liberty which Sunday ought to bring to the inferior orders
of the community; as by keeping servants on that day
confined and busied in preparations for the superfluous ele∣gancies
of our table, or dress.</P>
<P>3dly. By such recreations as are customarily forborne out
of respect to the day; as hunting, shooting, fishing, public
diversions, frequenting taverns, playing at cards or dice.</P>
<P>If it be asked, as it often has been, wherein consists
the difference between walking out with your stick, or
<PB N="386" REF="424"/>
with your gun? between spending the evening at home,
or in a tavern? between passing the Sunday afternoon at a
game of cards, or in conversation not more edifying, nor
always so inoffensive?—To these, and to the same ques∣tion,
under a variety of forms, and in a multitude of
similar examples, we return the following answer:—That
the religious observation of Sunday, if it ought to be re∣tained
at all, must be upheld by some public and visible
distinctions—that draw the line of distinction where you
will, many actions which are situated on the confines of
the line, will differ very little, yet lie on opposite sides of
it—that every trespass upon that reserve, which public de∣cency
has established, breaks down the fence, by which
the day is separated to the service of religion—that it is
unsafe to trifle with scruples and habits that have a bene∣ficial
tendency, though founded in mere custom—that
these liberties, however intended, will certainly be consi∣dered
by those who observe them, not only as disre∣spectful
to the day and institution, but as proceed∣ing
from a secret contempt of the Christian faith—that
consequently they diminish a reverence for religion
in others, so far as the authority of our opinion, or the
efficacy of our example reaches; or rather, so far as
either will serve for an excuse of negligence to those who
are glad of any—that as to cards and dice, which put in
their claim to be considered amongst the <HI>harmless</HI> occupations
of a vacant hour, it may be observed, that few find any
difficulty in refraining from <HI>play</HI> on Sunday, except they
who sit down to it, with the views and eagerness of
<PB N="387" REF="425"/>
gamesters:—that <HI>gaming</HI> is seldom innocent—that the anxi∣ety
and perturbations, however, which it excites, are incon∣sistent
with the tranquillity and frame of temper, in which
the duties and thoughts of religion should always both
find, and leave us—and lastly, we shall remark, that the
example of other countries, where the same or greater
licence is <HI>allowed,</HI> affords no apology for irregularities in
our own; because a practice which is tolerated by public
order and usage, neither receives the same construction,
nor gives the same offence, as where it is discouraged
and censured by both.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Reverencing the Deity.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is in many a seriousness and sense of awe,
which overspreads the imagination, whenever the
idea of the Supreme Being is presented to their thoughts.
This, which forms a considerable security against vice, is
the effect, not so much of reflection, as of habit; which
habit being generated by the external expressions of reve∣rence,
which we use ourselves, and observe in those about
us, may be destroyed by causes opposite to these, and es∣pecially,
by that familiar levity with which some learn to
speak of the Deity, of his attributes, providence, revela∣tions,
or worship.</P>
<P>God hath been pleased, no matter for what reason, al∣though
probably for this, to forbid the vain mention of his
name—“Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy
God in vain.” Now the mention is vain, when it is
useless; and it is useless, when it is neither likely nor in∣tended
to serve any good purpose; as when it flows from
the lips idle or unmeaning, or is applied upon occasions
inconsistent with any consideration of religion or devotion,
to express our anger, our earnestness, our courage, or
our mirth; or indeed, when it is used at all, except in acts
<PB N="389" REF="427"/>
of religion, or in serious and seasonable discourse upon re∣ligious
subjects.</P>
<P>The prohibition of the third commandment is recogni∣zed
by <HI>Christ,</HI> in his sermon upon the mount, which ser∣mon
adverts to none but the moral parts of the <HI>Jewish</HI> law.
“I say unto you swear not at all; but let your commu∣nication
be yea yea, nay nay; for whatsoever is more
than these, cometh of evil.” The <HI>Jews</HI> probably inter∣preted
the prohibition as restrained to the name <HI>Jehovah,</HI>
the name which the Deity had appointed and appropriated
to himself. <HI>Ex.</HI> vi. 3. The words of <HI>Christ</HI> extend the prohibition
beyond the <HI>name</HI> of God to every thing associated with the
idea. “Swear not, neither by heaven, for it is God's
throne; nor by the earth, for it is his foot-stool; neither
by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.” <HI>Matt.</HI> v. 35.</P>
<P>The offence of profane swearing, is aggravated by
the consideration, that duty and decency are sacrificed
thereby to the slenderest of temptations. Suppose the habit
either from affectation, or by negligence and inadvertency
to be already formed; it costs, one would think, little to
relinquish the pleasure and honour which it confers, and
it must always be within the power of the most ordinary
resolution to correct it. Zeal, and a concern for duty, are
in fact never strong, when the exertion requisite to van∣quish
a habit founded in no antecedent propensity, is
thought too much, or too painful.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="428"/>
A contempt of positive duties, or rather of those duties
for which the reason is not so plain as the command, indicates
a disposition upon which the authority of revelation has
obtained little influence.—This remark is applicable to the
offence of profane swearing, and describes, perhaps, the
general character of those who are most addicted to it.</P>
<P>Mockery and ridicule, when exercised upon the scrip∣tures,
or even upon the places, persons, and forms set
apart for the ministration of religion, fall within the mis∣chief
of the law, which forbids the profanation of God's
name, especially as it is extended by Christ's interpretation.
They are moreover inconsistent with a religious frame of
mind; for no one ever feels himself either disposed to
pleasantry, or capable of being diverted with the pleasan∣try
of others, upon matters in which he is cordially inter∣ested.
A mind intent upon the attainment of heaven,
rejects with indignation, every attempt to entertain it,
with jests, calculated to degrade or deride subjects, which
it never recollects, but with seriousness and anxiety—No∣thing
but stupidity, or the most frivolous dissipation of
thought, can make even the inconsiderate forget the su∣preme
importance of every thing which relates to the
expectation of a future existence. Whilst the infidel mocks
at the superstitions of the vulgar, insults over their credu∣lous
fears, their childish errors, and fantastic rites, it does
not occur to him to observe, that the most preposterous
device by which the weakest devotee ever believed he was
<PB N="391" REF="429"/>
securing the happiness of a future life, is more rational, than
unconcern about it. Upon this subject nothing is so absurd,
as indifference—no folly so contemptible, as thought∣lessness
and levity.</P>
<P>Finally, the knowledge of what is due to the solemnity
of those interests, concerning which revelation professes
to inform and direct us, may teach even those who are
least inclined to respect the prejudices of mankind, to ob∣serve
a decorum in the style and conduct of religious dis∣quisitions,
with the neglect of which, many adversaries of
Christianity, are justly chargeable. Serious arguments are
fair on all sides. Christianity is but ill defended by refus∣ing
audience or toleration to the objections of unbelievers.
But whilst we would have freedom of enquiry, restrained
by no laws, but those of decency, we are entitled to de∣mand
on behalf of a religion, which holds forth to man∣kind
assurances of immortality, that its credit be assailed
by no other weapons than those of serious discussion and
legitimate reasoning—that the truth or falshood of Chris∣tianity
be never made a topic of raillery, a theme for the
exercise of wit or eloquence, or a subject of contention for
literary fame and victory—that the cause be tried upon its
merits—that all applications to the fancy, passions, or
prejudices of the reader, all attempts to pre-occupy, en∣snare,
or perplex his judgment, by any art, influence, or
impression whatsoever, extrinsic to the proper grounds and
evidence upon which his assent ought to proceed, be re∣jected
from a question, which involves in its determination,
<PB N="392" REF="430"/>
the hopes, the virtue, and repose of millions—that the
controversy be managed on both sides with sincerity, that
is, that nothing be produced in the writings of either,
contrary to, or beyond, the writer's own knowledge and
persuasion—that objections and difficulties be proposed
from no other motive, than an honest and serious desire to
obtain satisfaction, or to communicate information which
may promote the discovery and progress of truth—that
in conformity with this design, every thing be stated
with integrity, with method, precision and simplicity;
and above all, that whatever is published in oppo∣sition
to received and confessedly beneficial persuasions,
be set forth under a form, which is likely to invite en∣quiry,
and to meet examination. If with these moderate
and equitable conditions, be compared, the manner in which
hostilities have been waged against the Christian religion,
not only the votaries of the prevailing faith, but every
man who looks forward with anxiety to the destination of
his being, will see much to blame, and to complain of.
By <HI>one unbeliever,</HI> all the follies which have adhered, in a
long course of dark and superstitious ages, to the popular
creed, are assumed as so many doctrines of Christ and his
Apostles, for the purpose of subverting the whole system,
by the absurdities, which it is <HI>thus</HI> represented to contain.
By <HI>another,</HI> the ignorance and vices of the sacerdotal order,
their mutual dissensions and persecutions, their usurpations
and incroachments upon the intellectual liberty and civil
rights of mankind, have been displayed with no small
triumph and invective, not so much to guard the Christian
<PB N="393" REF="431"/>
laity against a repetition of the same injuries, which is the
only proper use to be made of the most flagrant examples
past, as to prepare the way for an insinuation, that the re∣ligion
itself, is nothing else than a profitable fable, imposed
upon the fears and credulity of the multitude, and upheld
by the frauds, and influence, of an interested and crafty
priesthood. And yet how remotely is the character of the
clergy connected with the truth of Christianity! or what
more do the most disgraceful pages of ecclesiastical history
prove, than that the passions of our common nature are not
altered or excluded by distinctions of name, and that the
characters of men are formed much more by the tempta∣tions,
than the duties of their profession? A <HI>third</HI>
finds delight, in collecting and repeating accounts of
wars and massacres, of tumults and insurrections, excited
in almost every age of the Christian aera, by religious zeal;
as though the vices of Christians were parts of Christiani∣ty;
intolerance and extirpation precepts of the gospel; or
as if its spirit could be judged of, from the councils of
princes, the intrigues of statesmen, the pretences of ma∣lice
and ambition, or the unauthorized cruelties of some
gloomy and virulent superstition. By a <HI>fourth,</HI> the succes∣sion
and variety of popular religions, the vicissitudes with
which sects and tenets have flourished and decayed—the
zeal with which they were once supported, the negli∣gence
with which they are now remembered—the little
share which reason and argument appear to have had in
framing the creed, or regulating the religious conduct of
the multitude—the indifference and submission with which
<PB N="394" REF="432"/>
the religion of the state is generally received by the com∣mon
people—the caprice and vehemence with which it is
sometimes opposed—the phrenzy with which men have
been brought to contend for opinions and ceremonies, of
which they knew neither the proof, the meaning, nor ori∣ginal—lastly,
the equal and undoubting confidence, with
which we hear the doctrines of <HI>Christ</HI> or of <HI>Confucius,</HI> the
law of <HI>Moses</HI> or of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the <HI>Bible,</HI> the <HI>Koran,</HI> or the
<HI>Shaster,</HI> maintained or anathematized, taught or abjured,
revered or derided, according as we live on this, or on that
side of a river; keep within, or step over the boundaries of a
state; or even in the same country, and by the same people,
so often as the event of a battle, or the issue of a negocia∣tion
delivers them to the dominion of a new master—points,
I say, of this sort, are exhibited to the public at∣tention,
as so many arguments against the <HI>truth</HI> of the
<HI>Christian</HI> religion—and with success. For these topics,
being brought together and set off with some aggravation
of circumstances, and a vivacity of style and description,
familiar enough to the writings and conversation of free-thinkers,
insensibly lead the imagination into a habit of
classing Christianity with the delusions, that have taken
possession, by turns, of the public belief; and of regarding
it, as what the scoffers of our faith represent it to be, <HI>the
superstition of a day.</HI> But is this to deal honestly by the
subject, or with the world? May not the same things be
said, may not the same prejudices be excited by these re∣presentations,
whether Christianity be true or false, or by
whatever proofs its truth be attested? May not truth as
<PB N="395" REF="433"/>
well as falshood be taken upon credit? May not a religion
be founded upon evidence, accessible, and fatisfactory to
every mind competent to the enquiry, which yet, by the
greatest part of its professors, is received upon authority?</P>
<P>But if the <HI>matter</HI> of these objections be reprehensible, as
calculated to produce an effect upon the reader, beyond
what their real weight, and place in the argument deserve,
still more shall we discover of management and disingenu∣ousness
in the <HI>form</HI> under which they are dispersed among
the public. Infidelity, is served up in every shape, that is
likely to allure, surprize, or beguile the imagination—in a
fable, a tale, a novel, a poem—in interspersed and broken
hints—remote and oblique surmises—in books of travels,
of philosophy, of natural history—in a word, in any form,
rather than the right one, that of a professed and regular
disquisition. And because the coarse buffoonery, and
broad laugh of the old and rude adversaries of the Chris∣tian
faith, would offend, the taste, perhaps, rather than
the virtue of this cultivated age, a graver irony, a more
skilful and delicate banter, is substituted in their place.
An eloquent historian, besides his more direct, and there∣fore
fairer attacks, upon the credibility of the evangelic
story, has contrived to weave into his narration, one con∣tinued
sneer upon the cause of Christianity, and the writings
and characters of its ancient patrons. The knowledge which
this author possesses of the frame and conduct of the human
mind, must have led him to observe, that such attacks do
their execution, without enquiry. Who can refute a
<PB N="396" REF="434"/>
<HI>sneer?</HI> Who can compute the number, much less, one by
one, scrutinize the justice, of those disparaging insinua∣tions,
which croud the pages of this elaborate history?
What reader suspends his curiosity, or calls off his atten∣tion
from the principal narrative, to examine references,
to search into the foundation, or to weigh the reason, pro∣priety
and force, of every transient sarcasm, and sly allu∣sion,
by which the Christian testimony is depreciated and
traduced? and by which nevertheless, he may find his
faith afterwards unsettled and perplexed.</P>
<P>But the enemies of Christianity have pursued her with
poisoned arrows. Obscenity itself is made the vehicle of
infidelity. The awful doctrines, if we be not permitted
to call them the sacred truths, of our religion, together
with all the adjuncts and appendages of its worship, and
external profession, are impudently profaned by an unna∣tural
conjunction with impure and lascivious images. The
fondness for ridicule is almost universal; and ridicule to
many minds is never so irresistible, as when heightened by
obscenity, and employed upon religion. But in propor∣tion
as these noxious principles take hold of the imagina∣tion,
they infatuate the judgment; for trains of ludicrous
and unchaste associations adhering to every sentiment and
mention of religion, render the mind indisposed to receive
either conviction from its evidence, or impressions from
its authority. And this effect being exerted upon the sen∣sitive
part of our frame, is altogether independent of ar∣gument,
proof, or reason; and as formidable to a true
<PB N="397" REF="435"/>
religion, as to a false one; to a well-grounded faith, as to a
chimerical mythology, or fabulous tradition. Neither, let
it be observed, is the crime or danger less, because impure
ideas are exhibited under a veil, in covert and chastized
language.</P>
<P>Seriousness, is not constraint of thought; nor levity,
freedom. Every mind which wishes the advancement of
truth and knowledge, in the most important of all human
researches, must abhor this licentiousness as violating no
less the laws of reasoning, than the rights of decen∣cy.
There is but one description of men, to whose
principles it ought to be tolerable, I mean that class of
reasoners, who can see <HI>little</HI> in Christianity, even supposing
it to be true. To such adversaries we address this reflec∣tion—Had
<HI>Jesus Christ</HI> delivered no other declaration, than
the following: “The hour is coming, in the which all
that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall
come forth; they that have done good, unto the resur∣rection
of life, and they that have done evil unto the
resurrection of damnation;” he had pronounced a
message of inestimable importance, and well worthy of
that splendid apparatus of prophecy and miracles, with
which his mission was introduced, and attested—a message,
in which the wisest of mankind would rejoice to find an
answer to their doubts, and rest to their enquiries. It is
idle to say, that a future state had been discovered already—It
had been discovered, as the <HI>Copernican</HI> system was—it was
<PB N="398" REF="436"/>
one guess amongst many. He alone discovers, who <HI>proves;</HI>
and no man can prove this point, but the teacher who
testifies by miracles that his doctrine comes from God.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Origin of Civil Government.</HEAD>
<P>GOVERNMENT, at first, was either patriarchal or
military; <HI>that</HI> of a parent over his family, or of a
commander over his fellow warriors.</P>
<P>I. Paternal authority, and the order of domestic life,
supplied the foundation of <HI>civil government.</HI> Did mankind
spring out of the earth mature and independent, it would
be found perhaps impossible, to introduce subjection and
subordination among them; but the condition of human
<PB N="400" REF="438"/>
infancy prepares men for society, by combining individuals
into small communities, and placing them from the
be∣ginning
under direction and controll. A family contains
the rudiments of an empire. The authority of one over
many, and the disposition to govern and be governed, are
in this way incidental to the very nature, and coeval, no doubt,
with the existence of the human species. Moreover,
the constitution of families, not only assists the formation
of civil government, by the dispositions which it gene∣rates,
but also furnishes the first steps of the process by
which empires have been actually reared. A parent would
retain a considerable part of his authority after his chil∣dren
were grown up, and had formed families of their
own. The obedience, of which they remembered not the
beginning, would be considered as natural; and would
scarcely, during the parent's life, be entirely or abruptly
withdrawn. This is the second stage in the progress of
dominion. The first, was that of a parent over his young
children: we now see an ancestor presiding over his adult
descendants. And altho' the original progenitor was the
centre of union to his posterity, yet it is not probable that
the association would be immediately or altogether dis∣solved
by his death. Connected by habits of intercourse
and affection, and by some common rights, necessities,
and interests, they would consider themselves as allied to
each other in a nearer degree than to the rest of the spe∣cies.
Almost all would be sensible of an inclination to
continue in the society in which they had been brought
up; and experiencing as they soon would, many incon∣veniences
<PB N="401" REF="439"/>
from the absence of that authority which their
common ancestor exercised, especially in deciding their
disputes, and directing their operations in matters in which
it was necessary to act in conjunction, they might be
in∣duced
to supply his place by a formal choice of a successor,
or rather might willingly and almost imperceptibly trans∣fer
their obedience to some one of the family who by his
age or services, or by the part he possessed in the direction
of their affairs during the life-time of the parent, had al∣ready
taught them to respect his advice, or to attend to
his commands; or lastly, the prospect of these inconve∣niences
might prompt the first ancestor to appoint a suc∣cessor,
and his posterity, from the same motive united with
an habitual deference to his authority, would receive the
appointment with submission. Here then we have a tribe
or clan incorporated under one chief. Such communities
might be increased by considerable numbers, and fulfill the
purposes of civil union without any other or more regular
convention, constitution, or form of government, than
what we have described. Every branch which was slip∣ped
off from the primitive stock, and removed to a distance
from it, would in like manner take root, and grow into a
separate clan. Two or three of these clans were frequent∣ly
we may suppose united into one. Marriage, conquest,
mutual defence, common distress, or more accidental coa∣litions,
might produce this effect.</P>
<P>II. A second source of personal authority, and which
might easily extend or sometimes perhaps supersede the
<PB N="402" REF="440"/>
patriarchal, is that, which results from military arrange∣ment.
In wars, either of aggression, or defence, manifest
necessity would prompt those who fought on the same side,
to array themselves under one leader. And although their
<HI>leader</HI> was advanced to to this eminence for the purpose only and during the operations of a single expedition, yet
his authority would not always terminate with the reasons
for which it was conferred. A warrior who had led forth his
tribe against their enemies with repeated success, would
procure to himself even in the deliberations of peace, a
powerful and permanent influence. If this advantage
were added to the authority of the patriarchal chief, or
favoured by any previous distinction of ancestry, it would
be no difficult undertaking for the person who possessed it,
to obtain the almost absolute direction of the affairs of
the community, especially if he was careful to associate to
himself proper auxiliaries, and content to practice the ob∣vious
art of gratifying or removing those who opposed his
pretensions.</P>
<P>But although we may be able to comprehend how by his
personal abilities or fortune one man may obtain the rule
over many, yet it seems more difficult to explain how em∣pire
became hereditary, or in what manner sovereign
power, which is never acquired without great merit or ma∣nagement,
learns to descend in a succession, which has no
dependence upon any qualities, either of understanding, or
activity. The causes which have introduced hereditary
dominion into so general a reception in the world, are
<PB N="403" REF="441"/>
principally the following—the influence of association,
which communicates to the son a portion of the same respect
which was wont to be paid to the virtues, or station of the
father—the mutual jealousy of other competitors—the
greater envy, with which all behold the exaltation of an
equal, than the continuance of an acknowledged superiori∣ty—the
founder of the family would leave behind him
many adherents, who could only preserve their own im∣portance,
by supporting the succession of his children—Add
to these reasons, that elections to the supreme power
having upon some occasions produced the most destructive
contentions, many states would take refuge from a return
of the same calamities, in a rule of succession; and no rule
presents itself so obvious, certain, and intelligible, as con∣sanguinity of birth.</P>
<P>The antient state of society in most. countries, and the
modern condition of some uncivilized parts of the world,
exhibit that appearance, which this account of the original
of civil government would lead us to expect. The earliest
histories of <HI>Palestine, Greece, Italy, Gaul, Britain,</HI> inform
us, that these countries were occupied by many small in∣dependent
nations, not much perhaps unlike those which
are found at present amongst the savage inhabitants of
<HI>North America,</HI> and upon the coast of <HI>Africa.</HI> These na∣tions,
I consider, as the amplifications of so many single
samilies, on derived from the junction of two or three fa∣milies,
whom society in war or the approach of common
danger had united. Suppose a country to have been first
<PB N="404" REF="442"/>
peopled by shipwreck on its coasts, or by emigrants, or
exiles from some neighbouring country, the new settlers
having no enemy to provide against, and occupied with
the care of their personal subsistence, would think little
of digesting laws, of contriving a form of government, or
indeed of any political union at all; but each settler would
remain at the head of his own family, and each family
would include all of every age and generation who were
descended from him. So many of these families as were
holden together after the death of the original ancestor, by
the reasons, and in the method above recited, would wax
as the individuals were multiplied, into tribes, clans,
hords, or nations, similar to those into which the antient
inhabitants of many countries are known to have been di∣vided,
and which are still found, wherever the state of
society and manners is immature and uncultivated.</P>
<P>Nor need we be surprized at the early existence in the
world of some vast empires, or the rapidity with which
they advanced to their greatness, from comparatively small
and obscure originals, Whilst the inhabitants of so many
countries were broken into numerous communities, un∣connected,
and oftentimes contending with each other; be∣fore
experience had taught these little states to see their own
danger in their neighbour's ruin; or had instructed them
in the necessity of resisting the aggrandizement of an as∣piring
power, by alliances and timely preparations; in this
condition of civil policy, a particular tribe who by any
means had got the start of the rest in strength, or disci∣pline,
<PB N="405" REF="443"/>
and happened to fall under the conduct of an am∣bitious
chief, by directing their first attempts to where
success was most secure, and by assuming, as they went
along, those whom they conquered into a share of their
future enterprizes, might soon gather a force, which
would infallibly overbear any opposition, that the divided
power and unprovided state of such enemies could make
to the progress of their victories.</P>
<P>Lastly, our theory affords a presumption, that the first
governments were monarchies, because the government of
families, and of armies, from which, according to our ac∣count
civil government derived its institution, and probably
its form, is universally monarchical.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="406" REF="444"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How Subjection to Civil-Government is maintained</HEAD>
<P>COULD we view our own species from a distance, and
regard mankind with the same sort of observation,
with which we read the natural history or remark the
<HI>manners</HI> of any other animal, there is nothing in the hu∣man
character which would more surprize us, than the
almost universal subjugation of strength to weakness—than
to see many millions perhaps of robust men in the com∣plete
use and exercise of their personal faculties and with∣out
any defect of courage, waiting upon the will of a
child, a woman, a driveller, or a lunatic. And although
when we suppose a vast empire in absolute subjection to
one person and that one depressed beneath the level of his
species by infirmities, or vice, we suppose perhaps an ex∣treme
case, yet in all cases, even in the most popular
forms of civil government, <HI>the physical strength resides in the
governed.</HI> In what manner opinion thus prevails over
strength, or how power, which naturally belongs to su∣perior
force, is maintained in opposition to it, in other
words, by what motives the many are induced to submit
to the few, becomes an enquiry which lies at the root of
<PB N="407" REF="445"/>
almost every political speculation. It removes, indeed,
but does not resolve the difficulty to say, that civil govern∣ments
are now-a-days almost universally upheld by stand∣ing
armies, for the question still returns, how are these
armies themselves kept in subjection and made to obey the
directions, and carry on the designs, of the prince, or
state which employs them.</P>
<P>Now although we should look in vain for any <HI>single</HI>
reason which will account for the general submission of
mankind to civil government, yet it may not be difficult
to assign for every class and character in the community,
considerations powerful enough to dissuade each from any
attempts to resist established authority. Every man has
his motive, though not the same. In this as in other in∣stances,
the conduct is similar, but the principles which
produce it, extremely various.</P>
<P>There are three principal distinctions of character, into
which the subjects of a state may be divided; into those
who obey from prejudice; those who obey from reason;
and those who obey from self-interest.</P>
<P>I. They who obey from prejudice, are determined by
an opinion of <HI>right,</HI> in their governors; which opinion is
founded upon <HI>prescription.</HI> In monarchies and aristocracies
which are hereditary, the prescription operates in favour of
particular families; in republics and elective offices, in fa∣vour
of particular forms of government or <HI>constitutions.</HI> Nor
<PB N="408" REF="446"/>
is it to be wondered at, that mankind should reverence
authority founded in prescription, when they observe that
prescription confers a title to almost every thing else. The
whole course, and all the habits off civil life, favor this
prejudice. Upon what other foundation stands any man's
right to his estate? The right of primogeniture, the suc∣cession
of kindred, the descent of property, the inheritance
of honours, the demand of tythes, tolls, rents, or ser∣vices
from the estates of others, the right of way, the
powers of office and magistracy, the privileges of nobility,
the immunities of the clergy, upon what are they all
founded, in the apprehension at least of the multitude,
but upon prescription? To what else, when the claims
are contested, is the appeal made? It is natural to transfer
the same principle to the affairs of government, and to re∣gard
those exertions of power, which have been long exer∣cised
and acquiesced in, as so many <HI>rights</HI> in the sovereign,
and to consider obedience to his commands, within certain
accustomed limits, as enjoined by that rule of conscience,
which requires us to render to every man his due.</P>
<P>In hereditary monarchies, the <HI>prescriptive title</HI> is corroborat∣ed,
and its influence considerably augmented, by an acces∣sion
of religious sentiments, and by that sacredness which
men are wont to ascribe to the persons of princes. Princes
themselves have not failed to take advantage of this dispo∣sition,
by claiming a superior dignity, as it were, of na∣ture,
or a peculiar delegation from the Supreme Being.
For this purpose were introduced the titles of <HI>sacred</HI> majesty,
<PB N="409" REF="447"/>
of God's anointed, representative, vicegerent, together
with the ceremonies of investitures and coronations, which
are calculated not so much to recognize the authority of
sovereigns, as to consecrate their persons. Where a fabu∣lous
religion permitted it, the public veneration has been
challenged by bolder pretensions. The <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors
usurped the titles, and arrogated the worship of gods. The
mythology of the heroic ages, and of many barbarous na∣tions,
was easily converted to this purpose. Some princes,
like the heroes of <HI>Homer,</HI> and the founder of the Roman
name, derived their birth from the Gods: others, with
<HI>Numa,</HI> pretended a secret but supernatural communication
with some divine being: and others again, like the <HI>Incas</HI>
of <HI>Peru,</HI> and the antient <HI>Saxon</HI> kings, extracted their descent
from the deities of their country. The <HI>Lama</HI> of <HI>Thibet,</HI>
at this day, is held forth to his subjects, not as the offspring
or successor of a divine race of princes, but as the im∣mortal
God himself, the object at once of civil obedience,
and religious adoration. This instance is singular, and
may be accounted the farthest point to which the abuse of
human credulity has ever been carried. But in all these
instances the purpose was the same; to engage the reve∣rence
of mankind, by an application to their religious
principles.</P>
<P>The reader will be careful to observe, that in this ar∣ticle
we denominate every opinion a <HI>prejudice,</HI> which,
whether true or false, is not founded upon argument, in
the mind of the person who entertains it.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="448"/>
II. They who obey from <HI>reason,</HI> that is to say, from con∣science
as instructed by reasonings and conclusions of their
own, are determined, by the consideration of the necessity
of some government or other—the certain mischief of
civil commotions—and the danger of resettling the go∣vernment
of their country better, or at all, if once sub∣verted
or disturbed.</P>
<P>III. They who obey from <HI>self-interest,</HI> are kept in order
by want of leisure; by a succession of private cares, plea∣sures,
and engagements; by contentment, or a sense of
the ease, plenty, and safety they enjoy; or lastly, and
principally, by fear, foreseeing they would bring them∣selves
by resistance into a worse situation than their present,
inasmuch as the strength of government, each discontented
subject reflects, is greater than his own, and he knows not
that others would join him. This last consideration has
often been called the <HI>opinion of power.</HI></P>
<P>This account of the principles by which mankind are
retained in their obedience to civil government, may sug∣gest
the following cautions:</P>
<P>1. Let civil governors learn from hence to respect their
subjects; let them be admonished, that <HI>the physical strength
resides in the governed;</HI> that this strength wants only to be
felt and roused to lay prostrate the most ancient and con∣firmed
dominion; that civil authority is founded in opi∣nion;
that general opinion therefore ought always to be
<PB N="411" REF="449"/>
treated with deference, and managed with delicacy and
circumspection.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The opinion of right</HI> always following <HI>the custom,</HI> being
for the most part founded in nothing else, and lending one
principal support to government, every innovation in the
constitution, or, in other words, in the custom of govern∣ing,
diminishes the stability of government. Hence some
absurdities are to be retained, and many small inconveniencies
endured in every country, rather than that the usage should be
violated, or the course of public affairs diverted from their
old and smooth channel. Even <HI>names</HI> are not indifferent.
When the multitude are to be dealt with, there is a <HI>charm</HI>
in sounds. It was upon this principle, that several states∣men
of those times advised <HI>Cromwell</HI> to assume the title of
King, together with the ancient style and <HI>insignia</HI> of royal∣ty.
The minds of many, they contended, would be
brought to acquiesce in the authority of a King, who sus∣pected
the office, and were offended with the administra∣tion
of a Protector. Novelty reminded them of usurpation.
The adversaries of this design opposed the measure, from
the same persuasion of the efficacy of names and forms,
jealous left the veneration paid to these, should add an in∣fluence
to the new settlement, which might ensnare the
liberty of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Government may be too secure.</HI> The greatest tyrants
have been those, whose titles were the most unquestioned.
Whenever therefore the opinion of right becomes too pre∣dominant
<PB N="412" REF="450"/>
and superstitious, it is abated by <HI>breaking the cus∣tom.</HI>
Thus the Revolution broke the <HI>custom of succession,</HI>
and thereby moderated both in the prince and people, those
lofty notions of hereditary right, which in the one were
become a continual temptation to tyranny, and disposed
the other to invite servitude, by undue compliances, and
dangerous concessions.</P>
<P>4. As ignoranee of union, and want of communica∣tion,
appear amongst the principal preservatives of civil
authority, it behoves every state to keep its subjects in this
want and ignorance, not only by vigilance in guarding
against actual confederacies and combinations, but by a
timely care to prevent great collections of men of any se∣parate
party or religion, even of the same occupation or
profession, or in any way connected by a participation of
interest or passion, from settling in the same vicinity. A
protestant establishment in this country may have little to
fear from its popish subjects, scattered as they are through∣out
the kingdom, and intermixed with the protestant in∣habitants,
which yet might think them a formidable body,
if they were gathered together into one county. The most
frequent and desperate riots are those, which break out
amongst men of the same profession, as weavers, miners, sai∣lors.
This circumstance makes a mutiny of soldiers, more to
be dreaded than any other insurrection. Hence also one dan∣ger
of an overgrown metropolis, and of those great cities,
and crouded districts, into which the inhabitants of trading
countries are commonly collected. The worst effect of
<PB N="413" REF="451"/>
popular tumults consists in this, that they discover to the
insurgents the secret of their own strength, teach them to
depend on it against a future occasion, and diffuse and produce
sentiments of confidence in one another, and assurances of
mutual support. Leagues thus formed and strengthened,
may over-awe, or over-set the power of the state, and the
danger is greater in proportion, as from the propinquity of
habitation, and intercourse of employment, the passions
and counsels of the party can be circulated with ease and
rapidity. It is by these means, and in such situations, that
the minds of men are so affected and prepared, that the
most dreadful uproars often arise from the slightest provo∣cations.—When
the train is laid, a spark will produce
explosion.</P>

<PB N="414" REF="452"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Duty of Submission to Civil Government explained.</HEAD>
<P>THE subject of this chapter is sufficiently distinguished
from the subject of the last, as the motives which
<HI>actually</HI> produce civil obedience, may be, and often are,
very different from the reasons which make that obedi∣ence
a duty.</P>
<P>In order to prove civil obedience to be a moral duty, and
an obligation upon the conscience of the subject, it hath
been usual with many political writers, at the head of
whom we find the venerable name of <HI>Locke,</HI> to state
a compact between the citizen and the state, as the ground
and cause of the relation between them; which compact
binding the parties, for the same general reason that pri∣vate
contracts do, resolves the duty of submission to civil
government into the universal obligation of fidelity in the
performance of promises. This compact is two-fold;</P>
<P>First, <HI>An express</HI> compact by the primitive founders of
the state, who are supposed to have convened for the
declared purpose of settling the terms of their future union,
and a constitution of government. The whole body is sup∣posed
to have unanimously consented, in the first place, to
<PB N="415" REF="453"/>
be bound by the resolutions of the majority; that majo∣rity,
in the next place, to have fixed certain fundamental
regulations; and then to have constituted, either in one
person, or in an assembly (the rule of succession or ap∣pointment
being at the same time determined) a <HI>standing
legislature,</HI> to whom, under these pre-established restrictions,
the government of the state was thenceforward committed,
and whose laws the several members of the convention
were, by their first undertaking, thus personally engaged
to obey.—This transaction is sometimes called the <HI>social
compact,</HI> and these supposed original regulations compose
what are meant by the <HI>constitution,</HI> the <HI>fundamental laws of
the constitution;</HI> and form on one side, the <HI>inherent indefeasible
prerogative of the crown;</HI> and on the other, the unalienable
<HI>birthright</HI> of the subject.</P>
<P>Secondly, A <HI>tacit</HI> or <HI>implied</HI> compact, by all succeeding
members of the state, who, by accepting its protection,
consent to be bound by its laws; in like manner as who∣ever
<HI>voluntarily enters</HI> into a private society, is understood,
without any other or more explicit stipulation, to promise
a conformity with the rules, and obedience to the govern∣ment
of that society, as the known conditions, upon which
he is admitted to a participation of its privileges.</P>
<P>This account of the subject, although specious, and pa∣tronized
by names the most respectable, appears to labour
under the following objections; that it is founded upon a
supposition false in fact, insufficient, if it were true, for
<PB N="416" REF="454"/>
the purposes for which it is produced, and leading to dan∣gerous
conclusions.</P>
<P>No social compact, similar to what is here de∣scribed,
was ever made or, entered into in fact; no such
original convention of the people was ever actually
held, or in any country could be held, antecedent to
the existence of civil government in that country. It is
to suppose it possible to call savages out of caves and
deserts, to deliberate and vote upon topics, which the ex∣perience,
and studies, and refinements of civil life alone
suggest. Therefore no government in the universe began
from this original. Some imitation of a social compact
may have taken place at a <HI>Revolution.</HI> The present age has
been witness to a transaction, which bears the nearest
resemblance to this political idea, of any of which history
has preserved the account or memory. I refer to the
establishment of the united states of <HI>North America.</HI> We
saw the <HI>people</HI> assembled to elect deputies, for the avowed
purpose of framing the constitution of a new empire. We
saw this deputation of the people deliberating and resolv∣ing
upon a form of government, erecting a permanent
legislature, distributing the functions of sovereignty, estab∣lishing
and promulging a code of fundamental ordinances,
which were to be considered by succeeding generations,
not merely as laws and acts of the state, but as the very
terms and conditions of the confederation, as binding not
only upon the subjects and magistrates of the state, but as
limitations of power, which were to controul and regulate
<PB N="417" REF="455"/>
the future legislature.—Yet even here much was presup∣posed.—In
settling the constitution many important parts
were presumed to be already settled—the qualifications of
the constituents who were admitted to vote in the elec∣tion
of members of Congress, as well as the mode of
electing the representatives, were taken from the old
forms of government. That was wanting from which
every social union should set off, and which alone makes
the resolutions of the society the act of the individual,
the unconstrained consent of all, to be bound by the de∣cision
of the majority; and yet, without this previous
consent, the revolt, and the regulations which followed
it, were compulsory upon dissentients.</P>
<P>But the original compact, we are told, is not proposed as
a <HI>fact,</HI> but as a fiction, which furnishes a commodious ex∣plication
of the mutual rights and duties of sovereigns and
subjects. In answer to this representation of the matter
we observe, that the original compact, if it be not a fact, <HI>is
nothing,</HI> can confer no actual authority upon laws or ma∣gistrates,
nor afford any foundation to rights, which are
supposed to be real and existing. But the truth is, that in
the books, and in the apprehension of those who deduce
our civil rights and obligations <HI>a pactis,</HI> the original con∣vention
is appealed to and treated of as a reality. When∣ever
the disciples of this system speak of the constitution;
of the fundamental articles of the constitution; of
laws being constitutional or unconstitutional; of inhe∣rent,
unalienable, inextinguishable rights, either in the
prince, or the people; or indeed of any laws, usages, or
<PB N="418" REF="456"/>
civil rights, as transcending the authority of the subsist∣ing
legislature, or possessing a force and sanction superior
to what belong to the modern acts and edicts of the legi∣slature,
they secretly refer us to what passed at the ori∣ginal
convention. They would teach us to believe, that
certain rules and ordinances were established by the
people, at the same time that they settled the charter of
government, and the powers as well as the form of the
subsisting legislature, which, consequently deriving its
commission and existence from the consent and act of the
primitive assembly (of which indeed it is only the stand∣ing
deputation) continues subject in the exercise of its of∣fices,
and as to the extent of its power, to the rules, reser∣vations,
and limitations which the same assembly then made
and prescribed to it.</P>
<P>“ As the first members of the state were bound by
express stipulation to obey the government which they
had erected, so the succeeding inhabitants of the same
country are understood to promise allegiance to the con∣stitution
and government they find established, by ac∣cepting
its protection claiming its privileges, and ac∣quiescing
in its laws; more especially, by the purchase
or inheritance of lands, to the possession of which, alle∣giance
to the state is annexed, as the very service and
condition of the tenure.” Smoothly as this train of
argument proceeds, little of it will endure examination.
The native subjects of modern states are not conscious of
any stipulation with their sovereigns, of ever exercising an
<PB N="419" REF="457"/>
election whether they will be bound or not by the acts of
the legislature, of any alternative being proposed to their
choice, of a promise either required or given, nor do they
apprehend that the validity and authority of the laws de∣pend
at all upon <HI>their</HI> recognition or consent. In all
stipulations, whether they be expressed or implied, pri∣vate
or public, formal or constructive, the parties stipu∣lating
must both possess the liberty of assent and refusal,
and also be conscious of this liberty, which cannot with
truth be affirmed of the subjects of civil government, as
government is now, or ever was actually administered.
This is a defect, which no arguments can excuse or sup∣ply;
all presumptions of consent, without this conscious∣ness,
or in opposition to it, are vain and erroneous. Still
less is it possible to reconcile with any idea of stipulation
the practice in which all <HI>European</HI> nations agree, of found∣ing
allegiance upon the circumstance of nativity, that is,
of claiming, and treating as subjects, all those who are
born within the confines of their dominions, although re∣moved
to another country in their youth or infancy. In
this instance, certainly the state does not presume a com∣pact.
Also if the subject be bound only by his own con∣sent,
and if the voluntary abiding in a country be the
proof and intimation of that consent, by what arguments
shall we defend the right, which sovereigns universally
assume, of prohibiting, when they please, the departure
of their subjects out of the realm?</P>
<P>Again, when it is contended that the taking and hold∣ing
possession of land amounts to an acknowledgment of
<PB N="420" REF="458"/>
the sovereign, and a virtual promise of allegiance to his
laws, it is necessary to the validity of the argument to
prove, that the inhabitants, who first composed and con∣stituted
the state, collectively possessed a right to the soil
of the country—a right to parcel it out to whom they
pleased, and to annex to the donation what conditions they
thought fit. How came they by this right? An agree∣ment
amongst themselves would not confer it: that could
only adjust what already belonged to them. A society of
men vote themselves to be the owners of a region of the
world;—does that vote, unaccompanied especially with any
culture, inclosure, or proper act of occupation, make it
theirs? does it entitle them to exclude others from it, or to
dictate the conditions upon which it shall be enjoyed? Yet
this original collective right and ownership, is the foun∣dation
of all the reasoning by which the duty of allegiance
is inferred from the possession of land.</P>
<P>The theory of government which affirms the existence
and the obligation of a social compact, would, after all,
have merited little discussion, and however groundless and
unnecessary, should have received no opposition from us,
did it not appear to lead to conclusions unfavourable to the
improvement, and to the peace, of human society.</P>
<P>1st. Upon the supposition that government was first
erected by, and derives all its just authority from the
resolutions entered into by a convention of the people,
it is capable of being presumed, that many points were
<PB N="421" REF="459"/>
settled by that convention, anterior to the establishment of
the subsisting legislature, and which the legislature, conse∣quently,
has no right to alter, or interfere with. These
points are called the fundamentals of the constitution, and
as it is impossible to determine how many, or what they
are, the suggesting of any such, serves extremely to em∣barrass
the deliberations of the legislature, and affords a
dangerous pretence for disputing the authority of the laws.
It was this sort of reasoning (so far as reasoning of any
kind was employed in the question) that produced in this
nation the doubt, which so much agitated the minds of
men in the reign of the <HI>second Charles,</HI> whether an <HI>Act of
Parliament</HI> could of right alter or limit <HI>the succession of the
Crown.</HI></P>
<P>2dly. If it be by virtue of a compact, that the subject
owes obedience to civil government, it will follow, that he
ought to abide by the form of government he finds esta∣blished,
be it ever so absurd, or inconvenient. He is
bound by his bargain. It is not permitted to any man to
retreat from his engagement, merely because he finds the
performance disadvantageous, or because he has an oppor∣tunity
of entering into a better. This law of contracts is
universal: and to call the relation between the sovereign
and the subject a contract, yet not to apply to it the rules,
or allow of the effects of a contract, is an arbitrary use of
names, and an unsteadiness in reasoning, which can teach
nothing. Resistance to the encroachments of the supreme
magistrate may be justified upon this principle; recourse
<PB N="422" REF="460"/>
to arms, for the purpose of bringing about an amendment
of the constitution, never can. No form of government
contains a provision for its own dissolution; and few go∣vernors
will consent to the extinction, or even to any
abridgement of their own power. It does not therefore
appear, how despotic governments can ever in consistency
with the obligation of the subject be changed, or mitigat∣ed.
Despotism is the constitution of many states: and
whilst a despotic prince exacts from his subjects the most
rigorous servitude, according to this account, he is only
holding them to their agreement. They may vindicate
the rights, which the constitution has left them, by force,
but every attempt to narrow the prerogative of the crown,
by new limitations, and in opposition to the will of the
reigning prince, whatever opportunities may invite, or
success follow it, must be condemned as an infraction of
the compact between the sovereign and the subject.</P>
<P>3dly. <HI>Every violation of the compact on the part of the go∣vernors
releases the subject from his allegiance, and dissolves the
government.</HI> I do not perceive how we can avoid this con∣sequence,
if we found the duty of allegiance upon com∣pact,
and confess any analogy between the social compact
and other contracts. In private contracts, the violation or
non-performance of the conditions, by one of the parties,
vacates the obligation of the other. Now the terms and
articles of the social compact being no where extant or
expressed—the rights and offices of the administrator of
an empire being so many and various—the imaginary and
<PB N="423" REF="461"/>
controverted line of his prerogative being so liable to be
overstepped in one part or other of it—the position that
every such transgression amounts to a forfeiture of the go∣vernment,
and consequently authorizes the people to with∣draw
their obedience and provide for themselves by a new
settlement, would endanger the stability of every political
fabric in the world, and has in fact always supplied the
disaffected with a topic of seditious declamation. If occa∣sions
have arisen, in which this plea has been resorted to
with justice and success, they have been occasions, in
which a revolution was defensible upon other and plainer
principles. The plea itself, is at all times captious and unsafe.</P>
<P>Wherefore, rejecting the intervention of a compact, as
unfounded in its principle, and dangerous in the applica∣tion,
we assign for the only ground of the subjects'
obligation, THE WILL OF GOD AS COLLECTED FROM EXPEDIENCY.</P>
<P>The steps by which the argument proceeds are few and
direct. “It is the will of God that the happiness of hu∣man
life be promoted”—this is the first step, and the
foundation not only of this, but of every moral conclusion.
“Civil society conduces to that end”—this is the second
proposition. “Civil societies cannot be upheld, unless
in each, the interest, of the whole society be binding
upon every part and member of it”—this is the third
<PB N="424" REF="462"/>
step, and conducts us to the conclusion, namely, “that
so long as the interest of the whole society requires it,
that is, so long as the established government cannot be
resisted or chantged without public inconveniency, it is
the will of God (which <HI>will</HI> universally determines our
duty) that the established government be obeyed”—and
no longer.</P>
<P>This principle being admitted, the justice of every particular case of resistance, is reduced to a computation of the
quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side, and
of the probability and expence of redressing it on the
other.</P>
<P>But who shall judge of this? <HI>Every man for himself.</HI> In
contentions between the sovereign and the subject, the
parties acknowledge no common arbitrator, and it would
be absurd to commit the decision to: <HI>those</HI> whose conduct
has provoked the question, and whose own interest, au∣thority,
and fate, are immediately concerned in it. The
danger of error and abuse, is no objection to the rule of
expediency, because every other rule is liable to the same
or greater; and every rule that can be propounded upon
the subject (like all rules which appeal to or bind the con∣science)
must in the application depend upon private judg∣ment.
It may be observed, however, that it ought equally
to be accounted the exercise of a man's private judgment,
whether he be determined by reasonings and conclusions
<PB N="425" REF="463"/>
of his own, or submit to be directed by the advice
of others,
provided he be free to chuse his guide.</P>
<P>We proceed to point out some easy but important infer∣ences,
which result from the substitution of <HI>public expedi∣ency,</HI>
in the place of all implied compacts, promises, or
conventions whatsoever.</P>
<P>I. It may be as much a duty, at one time, to resist go∣vernment,
as it is at another, to obey it—to wit, whenever
more advantage will, in our opinion, accrue to the community
from resistance, than mischief.</P>
<P>II. The lawfulness of resistance, or of a revolt, does not
depend alone upon the grievance which is sustained or
feared, but also upon the probable expence and event of
the contest. They who concerted the Revolution in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
were clearly justifiable in their counsels, because from
the disposition of the nation, and the strength and character
of the parties, the measure was likely to be brought about
with little mischief or bloodshed; whereas it might have
been a question with many friends of their country, whe∣ther
the injuries then endured and threatened, would have
authorized the renewal of a doubtful civil war.</P>
<P>III. Irregularity in the first foundation of a state, or sub∣sequent
violence, fraud, or injustice in getting possession
of the supreme power, are not sufficient reasons for resist∣ance,
after the government is once peaceably settled. No
<PB N="424" REF="464"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="425" REF="465"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="426" REF="466"/>
subject of the <HI>British</HI> empire conceives himself engaged to
vindicate the justice of the <HI>Norman</HI> claim or conquest, or
apprehends that his duty in any manner depends upon that
controversy. So likewise if the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> or
even the posterity of <HI>Cromwell</HI> had been at this day seated
upon the throne of <HI>England,</HI> we should have been as little
concerned to enquire how the founder of the family came
there. No civil contests are so futile, although none have
been so furious and sanguinary, as as those which are ex∣cited
by a disputed succession.</P>
<P>IV. Not every invasion of the subjects' rights, or liber∣ty,
or of the constitution; not every breach of promise,
or of oath; not every stretch of prerogative, abuse of
power, or neglect of duty by the chief magistrate, or by
the whole or any branch of the legislative body, justifies
resistance, unless these crimes draw after them public con∣sequences of sufficient magnitude to outweigh the evils
of civil disturbance. Nevertheless, every violation of the
constitution ought to be watched with jealousy, and re∣sented
as such, beyond what the quantity of damage sus∣tained
would require or warrant; because a known and
settled usage of governing affords the best security against
the enormities of uncontrolled dominion, and because this
security is weakened by every encroachment which is made
without opposition, or opposed without effect.</P>
<P>V. No usage, law, or authority whatever, is so bind∣ing,
that it need or ought to be continued, when it may be
<PB N="427" REF="467"/>
changed with advantage to the community. The family
of the prince, the order of succession, the prerogative of
the crown, the form and parts of the legislature, together
with the respective powers, office, duration, and mutual
dependency of the several parts, are all only so many <HI>laws,</HI>
mutable like other laws, whenever expediency requires,
either by the ordinary act of the legislature, or if the occa∣sion
deserve it, by the interposition of the people. These
points are want to be approached with a kind of awe, they
are represented to the mind as principles of the constitu∣tion
settled by our ancestors, and being fettled to be no
more committed to innovation or debate; as foundations
never to be stirred; as the terms and conditions of the so∣cial
compact, to which every citizen of the state has en∣gaged
his fidelity, by virtue of a promise, which he can∣not
now recall. Such reasons have no place in our system;
to us, if there be any good reason for treating these with
more deference and respect than other laws, it is, either
the advantage of the present constitution of government
(which reason must be of different force in different coun∣tries)
or because, in all countries, it is of importance, that
the form and usage of governing be acknowledged and
understood, as well by the governors as the governed, and
because, the seldomer it is changed the more it will be re∣spected
by both sides.</P>
<P>VI. As all civil obligation is resolved into expediency,
what difference is there between the obligation of an Eng∣lishman
and a Frenchman? in other words, why is a
<PB N="428" REF="468"/>
Frenchman bound in conscience to bear any thing from
his King, which an Englishman is not bound to bear, since
the obligation of both is founded in the same reason?
Their conditions may differ, but their <HI>rights</HI> according to
this account should seem to be equal; and yet we are ac∣customed
to speak of the <HI>rights</HI> as well as of the happiness of
a free people, compared with what belong to the subjects
of absolute monarchies.—How can this comparison be ex∣plained,
unless we refer to a difference in the compacts,
by which they are respectively bound? This is a fair ques∣tion,
and the answer to it will afford a farther illustration
of our principles. There are then many things which a
Frenchman is bound in conscience, as well as by coercion,
to endure at the hands of his prince, to which an English∣man
would not be obliged to submit, but it is for these
two reasons alone; <HI>first,</HI> because the same act of the prince
is not the same grievance where it is agreeable to the con∣stitution, as where it infringes it: <HI>secondly,</HI> because redress
in the two cases is not equally attainable. Resistance can∣not
be attempted with equal hopes of success, or the same
prospect of receiving support from others, where the peo∣ple
are reconciled to their sufferings, as where they are
alarmed by innovation. In this way, and no otherwise,
the subjects of different states have different civil rights;
the duty of obedience is defined by different boundaries,
and the point of justifiable resistance placed at different
parts of the <HI>scale</HI> of suffering—all which is sufficiently in∣telligible
without a social compact.</P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="469"/>
VII. <HI>The interest of the whole society is binding upon every
part of it.</HI> No rule, short of this, will provide for the sta∣bility
of civil government, or for the peace and safety of
social life. Wherefore, as individual members of the
state are not permitted to pursue their private emolument
to the prejudice of the community, so is it equally a con∣sequence
of this rule, that no particular colony, province,
town, or district, can justly concert measures for their se∣parate
interest, which shall appear at the same time to
diminish the <HI>sum</HI> of public prosperity. I do not mean, that
it is necessary to the justice of a measure, that it profit each
and every part of the community; for as the happiness of
the whole may be increased, whilst that of some parts is
diminished, it is possible, that the conduct of one part of an empire,
may be detrimental to some other part, and yet
just, provided one part gain more in happiness, than the
other part loses, so that the common weal be augmented by
the change: but what I affirm is, that those counsels can
never be reconciled with the obligations resulting from
civil union, which cause the <HI>whole</HI> happiness of the so∣ciety
to be impaired for the conveniency of <HI>a part.</HI> This
conclusion is applicable to the question of right between
<HI>Great Britain</HI> and her revolted colonies. Had I been an
<HI>American,</HI> I should not have thought it enough, to have
had it even demonstrated, that a separation from the pa∣rent
state would produce effects beneficial to <HI>America;</HI> my
relation to that state imposed upon me a farther enquiry,
whether the whole happiness of the empire was likely to
be promoted by such a measure—not indeed the happiness
<PB N="430" REF="470"/>
of every part, that was not necessary or to be expected—but
whether what <HI>Great Britain</HI> would lose by the separa∣tion,
was likely to be compensated to the joint stock of
happiness, by the advantages which <HI>America</HI> would receive
from it. The contested claims of sovereign states, and
their remote dependencies, may be submitted to the adjudi∣cation
of this rule with mutual safety. A public advan∣tage,
is measured by the advantage each individual re∣ceives,
and the number of those who receive it. A public
evil is compounded of the same proportions. Whilst,
therefore, a colony is small, or a province thinly inha∣bited,
if a competition of interests arise between the ori∣ginal
country and their acquired dominions, the former
ought to be preferred, because it is fit, that if one must
necessarily be sacrificed, the less give place to the greater:
but when, by an increase of population, the interest of
the provinces begins to bear a considerable proportion to
the <HI>entire</HI> interest of the community, it is possible that
they may suffer so much by their subjection, that not only
their's, but the whole happiness of the empire may be ob∣structed
by their union. The rule and principle of the
calculation being still the same, the <HI>result</HI> is different;
and this difference begets a new situation, which en∣titles
the subordinate parts of the state to more equal
terms of confederation, and, if these be refused, to
independency.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Duty of Civil Obedience as stated in the Christian Scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>WE affirm, that as to the <HI>extent</HI> of our civil rights
and obligations, <HI>Christianity</HI> hath left us where she
found us—that she hath neither altered, nor ascertained
it—that the New Testament contains not one passage,
which fairly interpreted, affords either argument or objec∣tion
applicable to any conclusions upon the subject, that
are deduced from the law and religion of nature.</P>
<P>The only passages which have been seriously alledged in
the controversy, or which it is necessary for us to state and
examine, are the two following; the one extracted from
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> the other from the First
General Epistle of St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
<Q>Romans xiii. I—7.</Q>
<P>“Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
For there is no power but of God; the powers that be,
are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the
power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that
<PB N="432" REF="472"/>
resist, shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers
are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which
is good, and thon shalt have praise of the same: for he
is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou
do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the
sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger
to <HI>execute</HI> wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore
ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also
for conscience sake. For, for this cause pay you tribute
also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually
upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their
dues: tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom
custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.”</P>
<Q>I. PETER, ii. 13—18.</Q>
<P>“Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the
Lord's sake; whether it be to the King as supreme; or
unto Governors, as unto them that are sent by him for
the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them
that do well. For so is the will of God, that with well-doing
ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish
men: as free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of
maliciousness, but as the servants of God.”</P>
<P>To comprehend the proper import of these instrtucions,
let the reader reflect, that upon the subject of civil obedi∣ence
there are two questions; the first, whether to obey
government be a moral duty and obligation upon the
<PB N="433" REF="473"/>
conscience at all; the second, how far, and to what cases,
that obedience ought to extend;—that these two questions,
are so distinguishable in the imagination, that it is possible
to treat of the one, without any thought of the other;
and lastly, that if expressions which relate to one of these
questions be transferred and applied to the other, it is with
great danger of giving them a signification very different
from the author's meaning. This distinction is not only
possible, but natural. If I met with a person, who ap∣peared
to entertain doubts, whether civil obedience were a
moral duty which ought to be voluntarily discharged, or
whether it were not a mere submission to force, like that,
which we yield to a robber, who holds a pistol to our
breast; I should represent to him the use and offices of
civil government, the end and the necessity of civil subjec∣tion;
or, if I preferred a different theory, I should explain
to him the social compact, urge him with the obligation
and the equity of his implied promise, and tacit consent to
be governed by the laws of the state from which he received
protection; or I should argue, perhaps, that Nature her∣self
dictated the law of subordination, when she planted
within us an inclination to associate with our species, and
framed us with capacities so various and unequal.—From
whatever principle I set out, I should labour to infer from
it this conclusion, “that obedience to the state, is to be
numbered amongst the relative duties of human life,
for the transgression of which, we shall be accountable at
the tribunal of divine justice, whether the magistrate,
be able to punish us for it or not;” and being arrived
<PB N="434" REF="474"/>
at this conclusion, I should stop, having delivered the con∣clusion itself, and throughout the whole argument expres∣sed
the obedience, which I inculcated, in the most general
and unqualified terms, all reservations and restrictions be∣ing
superfluous, and foreign to the doubts I was employed
to remove.</P>
<P>If in a short time afterwards, I should be accosted by
the same person, with complaints of public grievances
and apprehensions of exorbitant taxes, of acts of cruelty
and oppression, of tyrannical encroachments upon the an∣cient
or stipulated rights of the people, and should be con∣sulted
whether it were lawful to revolt, or justifiable to
join in an attempt to shake off the yoke, and provide
against the approaching danger, by open resistance; I
should certainly consider myself as having a case and ques∣tion
before me very different from the former. I should
now define and discriminate. I should reply, that if pub∣lic
expediency be the foundation, it is also the measure of
civil obedience; that the obligation of subjects and sove∣reigns
is reciprocal; that the duty of allegiance, whether
it be founded in utility or compact, is neither unlimited
nor unconditional;—that peace may be purchased too
dear; that patience becomes culpable pusillanimity, when
it serves only to encourage our rulers to increase the weight
of our burthen, or to bind it the faster; that the submis∣sion,
which surrenders the liberty of a nation, and entails
slavery upon future generations, is enjoined by no law of
rational morality: finally, I should instruct him to com∣pare
<PB N="435" REF="475"/>
the peril and expence of his enterprize, with the
effects it was expected to produce, and to make choice of
the alternative, by which not his own present relief or
profit, but the whole and permanent interest of the state
was likely to be best promoted. If any one who had been
present at both these conversations should upbraid me with
change or inconsistency of opinion, should retort upon
me the passive doctrine I before taught, the large and ab∣solute
terms in which I then delivered lessons of obedience
and submission, I should account myself unfairly dealt
with. I should reply, that the only difference which the
language of the two conversations presented was, that I
added now many exceptions and limitations, which were
omitted or unthought of then—that this difference arose
naturally from the two occasions, such exceptions being
as necessary to the subject of our present conference, as
they would have been superfluous and unseasonable in the
former. Now the difference in these two conversations
is precisely the distinction to be taken in interpreting those
passages of scripture, concerning which we are debating.
They inculcate the <HI>duty,</HI> they do not describe the <HI>extent</HI> of
it—they enforce the obligation by the proper sanctions of
Christianity, without intending either to enlarge or con∣tract,
without considering indeed the limits by which it is
bounded. This is also the method, in which the same
Apostles enjoin the duty of servants to their masters; of
children to their parents; of wives to their husbands.
“Servants be subject to your masters.”—“Children
obey your parents in all things.”—“Wives submit
<PB N="436" REF="476"/>
yourselves unto your own husbands.” The same con∣cise
and absolute form of expression, occurs in all these
precepts; the same silence, as to any exceptions or distinc∣tions;
yet no one doubts, but that the commands of
masters, parents, and husbands, are often so immoderate,
unjust, and inconsistent with other obligations, that they
both may and ought to be resisted. In letters or differta∣tions
written professedly upon separate articles of morality,
we might with more reason have looked for a precise de∣lineation
of our duty, and some degree of modern accu∣racy
in the rules which were laid down for our direction;
but in those short collections of practical maxims, which
compose the conclusion, or some small portion, of a doc∣trinal
or perhaps controversial epistle, we cannot be sur∣prized
to find the author more solicitous to impress the
duty, than curious to enumerate exceptions.</P>
<P>The consideration of this distinction, is alone sufficient
to vindicate these passages of scripture, from any explana∣tion,
which may be put upon them, in favor of an unli∣mited
passive obedience. But if we be permitted to assume
a supposition, which many commentators proceed upon as
a certainty, that the first Christians privately cherished an
opinion, that their conversion to Christianity entitled them to
new immunities, to an exemption as of <HI>right</HI> (however
they might give way to necessity) from the authority of
the <HI>Roman</HI> sovereign, we are furnished with a still more apt
and satisfactory interpretation of the Apostles' words. The
two passages apply with great propriety to the refutation
<PB N="437" REF="477"/>
of this error; they teach the Christian convert to obey the
magistrate “for the Lord's sake,”—“not only for wrath
but for conscience sake.”—“that there is no power but
of God”—“that the powers that be,” even the present
rulers of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, though<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heathens and usurpers,
seeing they are in possession of the actual and necessary
authority of civil government “are ordained of God,” and
consequently, entitled to receive obedience from those who
profess themselves the peculiar servants of God, in a greater (certainly not in a less) degree, than from any
others. They briefly describe the office of civil governors,
“the punishment of evil doers, and the praise of them
that do well;” from which description of the use of go∣vernment,
they justly infer the duty of subjection, which
duty being as extensive, as the reason upon which it is
founded, belongs to Christians no less than to the heathen
members of the community. If it be admitted, that the
two Apostles wrote with a view to this particular question,
it will be confessed, that their words cannot be transferred
to a question totally different from this, with any certain∣ty
of carrying along with us their authority and intention.
There exists no resemblance between the case of a primitive
convert who disputed the jurisdiction of the <HI>Roman</HI> govern∣ment
over a disciple of Christianity, and <HI>his,</HI> who
acknowledging the general authority of the state over all
its subjects, doubts, whether that authority be not in some
important branch of it, so ill constituted or abused, as to
warrant the endeavours of the people to bring about a
reformation by force: Nor can we judge what reply the
<PB N="438" REF="478"/>
Apostles would have made to this <HI>second</HI> question, if it had
been proposed to them, from any thing they have deli∣vered
upon the <HI>first;</HI> any more than in the two consulta∣tions
above described, it could be known beforehand,
what I would say in the latter, from the answer which I
gave to the former.</P>
<P>The only defect in this account is, that neither the scriptures,
nor any subsequent history of the early ages of
the church, furnish any direct attestation of the existence
of such disaffected sentiments amongst the primitive con∣verts.
They supply indeed some circumstances, which
render the opinion probable, that extravagant notions of
the political rights of the Christian state were at that time
entertained by many proselytes to the religion. From the
question proposed to Christ, “Is it lawful to give tribute
unto Caefar?” it may be presumed that doubts had been
started in the <HI>Jewish</HI> schools concerning the obligation, or
even the lawfulness of submission to the <HI>Roman</HI> yoke.
The accounts delivered by <HI>Josephus,</HI> of various insurrections
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> of that, and the following age, excited by
this principle, or upon this pretence, confirm the pre∣sumption.
Now as the <HI>Christians</HI> were at first chiefly taken
from the <HI>Jews,</HI> confounded with them by the rest of the
world, and from the affinity of the two religions, apt to
intermix the doctrines of both, it is not to be wondered at,
that a tenet, so flattering to the self-importance of those
who embraced it, should have been communicated to the
new institution. Again, the teachers of Christianity,
<PB N="439" REF="479"/>
amongst the privileges which their religion conferred up∣on
its professors, were wont to extoll the “<HI>liberty</HI> into
which they were called,”—“in which Christ had made
them free.” This liberty, which was intended of a
deliverance from the various servitude, in which they had
heretofore lived, to the domination of sinful passions, to
the superstition of the <HI>Gentile</HI> idolatry, or the incumbered
ritual of the <HI>Jewish</HI> dispensation, might by some be inter∣preted
to signify an emancipation from all restraint, which
was imposed by an authority merely human. At least they
might be represented by their enemies as maintaining no∣tions
of this dangerous tendency. To some error or ca∣lumny
of this kind, the words of St. <HI>Peter</HI> seem to allude:
“For so is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may
put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: as free,
and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness,
(i. e. sedition) but as the servants of God.” After all,
if any one think, this conjecture too feebly supported by
testimony, to be relied upon in the interpretation of scrip∣ture,
he will then revert to the considerations alledged in
the preceding part of this chapter.</P>
<P>After so copious an account of what we apprehend to be
the general design and doctrine of these much agitated pas∣sages,
little need be added in explanation of particular
clauses. St. <HI>Paul</HI> has said, “whosoever resisteth the
power, resisteth the ordinance of God.” This phrase,
“the ordinance of God,” is by many so interpreted as to
authorize the most exalted and superstitious ideas of the
<PB N="440" REF="480"/>
regal character. But, surely, such interpreters have sacri∣ficed
truth to adulation.—For in the first place, the ex∣pression,
as used by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> is just as applicable to one
kind of government and succession is to another—to the
elective magistrates of a pure republic, as to an absolute
hereditary monarch:—in the next place, it is not affirmed
of the supreme magistrate exclusively, that <HI>he</HI> is the ordi∣nance
of God; the title, whatever it imports, belongs
with equal propriety to the inferior officers of the state.
The divine right of <HI>Kings,</HI> is, like the divine right of <HI>Con∣stables,</HI>
the law of the land, or even actual and quiet
possession of their office, a right, ratified we humbly pre∣sume
by the divine approbation, so long as obedience to
their authority appears to be necessary, or conducive to
the common welfare. Princes are ordained of God by
virtue only of that general decree, by which he assents,
and adds the sanction of his will, to every law of society,
which promotes his own purpose, the communication of
human happiness: according to which idea of their origin
and constitution, and without any repugnancy to the
words of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> they are by St. <HI>Peter</HI> denominated the
<HI>ordinance of man.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Civil Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>CIVIL Liberty is the not being restrained by any Law, but what conduces in a greater degree to the public welfare.</P>
<P>To do what we will is natural liberty; to do what we
will, consistently with the interest of the community
to which we belong, is civil liberty; that is to say, the
only liberty to be desired in a state of civil society.</P>
<P>I should wish, no doubt, to be allowed to act in every
instance as I pleased, but I reflect that the rest also of
mankind would then do the fame; in which state of uni∣versal
independence and self-direction I should meet with so
many checks and obstacles to my own will, from the
interference and opposition of other men's, that not only
<PB N="442" REF="482"/>
my happiness, but my liberty, would be less, than whilst
the whole community are subjected to the dominion of
equal laws.</P>
<P>The boasted liberty of a state of nature exists only in a
state of solitude. In every kind and degree of union and
communication with his species, the liberty of the indi∣vidual
is augmented by the very laws which restrain it;
because he gains more from the limitation of other men's
freedom than he suffers by the diminution of his own.
Natural liberty is the right of common upon a waste;
civil liberty is the safe, exclusive, unmolested enjoyment
of a cultivated inclosure.</P>
<P>The definition of civil liberty above laid down, imports
that the laws of a free people impose no restraints upon the
private will of the subject, but what conduce in <HI>a greater
degree</HI> to the public happiness: by which it is intimated,
1 st, that restraint itself is an evil; 2dly, that this evil
ought to be overbalanced by some public advantage; 3dly,
that the proof of this advantage lies upon the legislature—it
is not enough to say that a law is harmless; its being a
law is a harm; 4thly, that a law being found to produce no
sensible good effects is a sufficient reason for repealing it, as
adverse and injurious to the rights of a free citizen, with∣out
demanding specific evidence of its bad effects.—This
maxim might be remembered with advantage in a revision
of many laws of this country; especially the game laws—the
poor laws, so far as they lay restrictions upon the poor
<PB N="443" REF="483"/>
themselves—the laws against papists and dissenters: and
amongst a people enamoured to excess and jealous of their
liberty, it seems a matter of surprize that this principle
has been so imperfectly attended to.</P>
<P>The degree of actual liberty always bearing, according
to this account of it, a reversed proportion to the number
and severity of the <HI>restrictions</HI> which are either useless, or
whose utility does not outweigh the evil of the restraint;
it follows that every nation possesses some, no nation per∣fect
liberty; that this liberty may be enjoyed under every
form of Government; that it may be impaired indeed,
or increased; but that it is neither gained, nor lost, nor
recovered, by any single regulation, change, or event
whatever; that consequently, those popular phrases which
speak of a free people; of a nation of slaves; which call one
revolution the aera of liberty; or another the loss of it;
with many expressions of a like absolute form, are intelli∣gible
only in a comparative sense.</P>
<P>Hence also we are enabled to apprehend the distinction
between personal and civil liberty. A citizen of the freest
republic in the world may be imprisoned for his crimes,
and though his personal freedom be restrained by bolts and
fetters, so long as his confinement is the effect of a be∣neficial
public law, his civil liberty is not invaded. If this
instance appear dubious, the following will be plainer.
A passenger from the Levant, who, upon his return to
England, should be conveyed to a lazaretto by an order of
<PB N="444" REF="484"/>
quarantine, with whatever impatience he might desire his
enlargement, and though he saw a guard placed at the door
to oppose his escape, or even ready to destroy his life if he
attempted it, would hardly accuse government of in∣croaching
upon his civil freedom; nay, might, perhaps,
rather congratulate himself that he had at length set his
foot again in a land of liberty. The manifest expediency
of the measure not only justifies it, but reconciles the most
odious confinement with the perfect possession, and the
loftiest notions of civil liberty. And if this be true of the
coercion of a prison, that it is compatible with a state of
<HI>civil</HI> freedom; it cannot with reason be disputed of those
more moderate constraints which the ordinary operation of
government imposes upon the will of the individual. It is
not the rigour, but the inexpediency of laws and acts of
authority, which makes them tyranical.</P>
<P>There is another idea of civil liberty, which, though
neither so simple nor so accurate as the former, agrees
better with the signification, which the usage of common
discourse, as well as the example of many respectable wri∣ters
upon the subject, has affixed to the term. This idea
places liberty in security; making it to consist not merely
in an actual exemption from the constraint of useless and
noxious laws and acts of dominion, but in being free from
the <HI>danger</HI> of having any such hereafter imposed or
exercised. Thus, speaking of the political state of modern
Europe, we are accustomed to say of Sweden, that she lost
her <HI>liberty</HI> by the revolution which lately took place in that
<PB N="445" REF="485"/>
country; and yet we are assured that the people continue
to be governed by the same laws as before, or by others
which are wiser, milder, or more equitable. What then
have they lost? They have lost the power and functions of
their diet; the constitution of their states and orders,
whose deliberation and concurrence were required in the
formation and establishment of every public law; and
thereby have parted with the security they possessed against
any attempts of the crown to harrass its subjects, by op∣pressive
and useless exertions of prerogative. The loss of
this security we denominate the loss of liberty. They
have changed not their laws, but their legislature; not their
enjoyment, but their safety; not their present burthens,
but their prospects of future grievances: and this we pro∣nounce
a change from the condition of freemen to that of
slaves. In like, manner, in our own country, the act of
parliament, in the reign of Henry the eighth, which gave
to the king's proclamation the force of law, has properly
been called a complete and formal surrender of the liberty
of the nation; and would have been so, although no procla∣mation
were issued in pursuance of these new powers, or
none but what was recommended by the highest wisdom
and utility. The security was gone. Were it probable,
that the welfare and accommodation of the people would
be as studiously, and as providently, consulted in the edicts
of a despotic prince, as by the resolutions of a popular as∣sembly,
then would an absolute form of government be no
less free than the purest democracy. The different degree
of care and knowledge of the public interest which may
<PB N="446" REF="486"/>
reasonably be expected from the different form and com∣position
of the legislature, constitutes the distinction, in
respect of liberty, as well between these two extremes, as
between all the intermediate modifications of civil govern∣ment.</P>
<P>The definitions which have been framed of civil liberty,
and which have been made the subject of much unnecessary
altercation, are most of them adapted to this idea. Thus
one political writer makes the very essence of the subject's
liberty to consist in his being governed by no laws but
those to which he hath actually consented; another is sa∣tisfied
with a virtual and indirect consent; another again
places civil liberty in the separation of the legislative and
executive offices of government; another in the being go∣verned
by <HI>law,</HI> that is, by known, preconstituted, inflex∣ible
rules of action and adjudication; a fifth in the exclusive
right of the people to tax themselves by their own repre∣sentatives;
a sixth in the freedom and purity of elections of
representatives; a seventh in the controll which the demo∣cratic
part of the constitution possesses over the military
establishment. Concerning which, and some other similar
accounts of civil liberty, it may be observed, that they all
labour under one inaccuracy, viz. that they do not so much
describe liberty itself, as the safeguards and preservatives of
liberty: for example, a man's being governed by no laws,
but those to which he has given his consent, were it
<PB N="447" REF="487"/>
practicable, is no otherwise necessary to the enjoyment of
civil liberty, than as it affords a probable security against
the dictation of laws, imposing arbitrary and superfluous
restrictions upon his private will. This remark is applica∣ble
to the rest. The diversity of these definitions will not
surprise us, when we consider that there is no contrariety
or opposition amongst them whatever; for by how many
different provisions and precautions civil liberty is fenced
and protected, so many different accounts of liberty itself,
all sufficiently consistent with truth and with each other,
may, according to this mode of explaining the term, be
framed and adopted.</P>
<P>Truth cannot be offended by a definition, but propriety
may. In which view those definitions of liberty ought to
be rejected, which by making that essential to civil freedom
which is unattainable in experience, inflame expectations
that can never be gratified, and disturb the public content
with complaints, which no wisdom or benevolence of go∣vernment
can remove.</P>
<P>It will not be thought extraordinary, that an idea, which
occurs so much oftener as the subject of panegyric, and
careless declamation, than of just reasoning, or correct
knowledge, should be attended with uncertainty and con∣fusion;
or that it should be found impossible to contrive a
definition, which may include the numerous, unsettled,
and ever varying significations, which the term is made to
<PB N="448" REF="488"/>
stand for, and at the same time accord with the condition
and experience of social life.</P>
<P>Of the two ideas that have been stated of civil liberty,
whichever we assume, and whatever reasoning we found
upon them, concerning its extent, nature, value and preser∣vation,
this is the conclusion:—that <HI>that</HI> people, govern∣ment,
and constitution, is the <HI>freest,</HI> which makes the best
provision for the enacting of expedient and salutary laws.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of different Forms of Government.</HEAD>
<P>AS a series of appeals must be finite, there necessarily
exists in every government a power from which
the constitution has provided no appeal; and which power,
for that reason, may be termed absolute, omnipotent,
uncontrollable, arbitrary, despotic; and is alike so in all
countries.</P>
<P>The person, or assembly, in whom this power resides,
is called the sovereign, or the supreme power of the state.</P>
<P>Since to the same power universally appertains the

<P>A government receives its denomination from the form

as the simple forms, by some combination and intermix∣ture
of which all actual governments are composed,
than as any where existing in a pure and elementary state.
These forms are.</P>
<P>I. Despotism, or absolute MONARCHY, where the legis∣lature

<P>II. An ARISTOCRACY, where the legislature is in a se∣lect

their places in it by inheritance, property, tenure of cer∣tain
lands, or in respect of some personal right, or quali∣fication.</P>
<P>III. A REPUBLIC, or democracy, where the people at
large, either collectively, or by representation, constitute
the legislature.</P>
<P>The separate advantages of MONARCHY, are unity of
council, activity, decision, secrecy, dispatch; the mili∣tary
strength and energy which result from these qualities
of government; the exclusion of popular and aristocratical
contentions; the preventing, by a known rule of succession,
of all competition for the supreme power; and thereby re∣pressing
the hopes, intrigues, and dangerous ambition of
aspiring citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="491"/>
The mischiefs, or rather the dangers of MONARCHY, are,
tyranny, expence, exaction, military domination; unne∣cessary
wars waged to gratify the passions of an individual;
risk of the character of the reigning prince; ignorance
in the governors of the interests and accommodation of
the people, and a consequent deficiency of salutary regu∣lations;
want of constancy and uniformity in the rules of
government, and, proceeding from thence, insecurity of
person and property.</P>
<P>The separate advantage of an ARISTOCRACY consists in
the wisdom which may be expected from experience and
education—a permanent council naturally possesses expe∣rience;
and the members, who succeed to their places in
it by inheritance, will, probably, be trained and educated
with a view to the stations, which they are destined by
their birth to occupy.</P>
<P>The mischiefs of an ARISTOCRACY are, dissensions
in the ruling order of the state, which, from the
want of a common superior, are liable to proceed to the
most desperate extremities; oppression of the lower orders
by the privileges of the higher, and by laws partial to
the separate interests of the law makers.</P>
<P>The advantages of a REPUBLIC are, liberty, or exemp∣tion
from needless restrictions; equal laws; regulations
adapted to the wants and circumstances of the people;
public spirit, frugality, averseness to war; the opportu∣nities
<PB N="452" REF="492"/>
which democratic assemblies afford to men of every
description, of producing their abilities and councils to
public observation, and the exciting thereby, and calling
forth to the service of the commonwealth, the faculties of
its best citizens.</P>
<P>The evils of a REPUBLIC are, dissensions, tumults, fac∣tion;
the attempts of powerful citizens to possess them∣felves
of the empire; the confusion, rage, and clamour
which are the inevitable consequences of assembling mul∣titudes,
and of propounding questions of state to the dis∣cussion
of the people; the delay and disclosure of public
councils, and designs; and the imbecility of measures re∣tarded
by the necessity of obtaining a numerous consent—Lastly,
the oppression of the provinces which are not ad∣mitted
to a participation in the legislative power.</P>
<P>A <HI>mixed</HI> government is composed by the combination of
two or more of these simple forms of government—and,
in whatever proportion each form enters into the constitu∣tion
of a government, in the same proportion may both
the advantages and evils, which we have attributed to that
form, be expected; that is, those are the uses to be main∣tained
and cultivated in each part of the constitution, and
these are the dangers to be provided against in each—Thus,
if secrecy and dispatch be truly enumerated amongst
the separate excellencies of regal government; then a mixed
government, which retains monarchy in one part of its
constitution, should be careful that the other estates of
<PB N="453" REF="493"/>
the empire do not interpose delays, or discover what it is
expedient to conceal, by an officious and inquisitive inter∣ference
with the executive functions, which are, or ought
to be, reserved to the administration of the prince. On the
other hand, if profusion, exaction, military domination,
and needless wars, be justly accounted natural properties of
monarchy, in its simple unqualified form; then are
these the objects to which, in a mixed government, the
aristocratic and popular parts of the constitution ought to
direct their vigilance; the dangers against which they
should erect and fortify their barriers:—these are depart∣ments
of sovereignty, over which a power of inspection
and control ought to be deposited with the people.</P>
<P>The same observation may be repeated of all the other
advantages and inconveniencies which have been ascribed
to the several simple forms of government; and affords a
rule whereby to direct the construction, improvement,
and administration of mixed governments, subjected howe∣ver
to this remark, that a quality sometimes results from
the conjunction of two simple forms of government,
which belongs not to the separate existence of either: thus
corruption, which has no place in an absolute monarchy,
and little in a pure republic, is sure to gain admission into
a constitution, which divides the supreme power between
an executive magistrate and a popular council.</P>
<P>An <HI>hereditary</HI> MONARCHY is universally to be preferred
to an <HI>elective</HI> monarchy—the confession of every writer
<PB N="454" REF="494"/>
upon the subject of civil government, the experience of
ages, the example of Poland, and the papal dominions,
seem to place this amongst the few indubitable maxims
which the science of politics admits of—A crown is too
spendid a prize to be conferred upon merit—the passions
or interests of the electors exclude all consideration of the
qualities of the competitors. The same observation holds
of the appointment to any office which is attended with a
great share of power and emolument. Nothing is gained
by a popular choice worth the dissensions, tumults, and
interruption of regular industry, with which it is inse∣parably
attended. Add to this, that a king, who owes
his elevation to the event of a contest, or to any other
cause than a fixed rule of succession, will be apt to regard
one part of his subjects as the associates of his for∣tune,
and the other as conquered foes. Nor should it be
forgotten, amongst the advantages of, an <HI>hereditary</HI> mo∣narchy,
that as plans of national improvement and re∣form
are seldom brought to maturity by the exertions of
a single reign, a nation cannot attain to the degree of
happiness and prosperity which it is capable of enjoying,
unless an uniformity of councils, a consistency of public
measures and designs be continued through a succession of
ages. This benefit of a consistent scheme of government,
may be expected, with greater probability, where the su∣preme
power descends in the same race, and each prince
succeeds, in some sort, to the disposition of his ancestor,
than where the crown, at every change, devolves upon a
stranger, whose first care is commonly to pull down what
<PB N="455" REF="495"/>
his predecessor had built up; and to substitute systems of
administration, which, in their turn, give way to the
more favourite novelties of the next successor.</P>
<P>ARISTOCRACIES are of two kinds, first, where the power
of the nobility belongs to them in their collective capacity
alone; that is, where although the government reside in
an assembly of the order, yet the members of the assem∣bly
separately and individually possess no authority or privi∣lege
beyond the rest of the community:—this describes
the constitution of Venice. Secondly, where the nobles are
severally invested with great personal power and immuni∣ties,
and where the power of the senate is little more than
the aggregated power of the individuals who compose it:—this
is the constitution of Poland. Of these two forms of
government, the first is the most tolerable; for al∣though
the members of the senate should many, or even all
of them, be profligate enough to abuse the authority of
their stations in the prosecution of private designs, yet,
not being all under a temptation to the same injustice, not
having all the same end to gain, it would still be difficult
to obtain the consent of a majority,, to any oppressive mea∣fure,
which the iniquity of an individual might prompt
him to propose: or if the will were the same, the power
to harrass is more remote and confined; one tyrant, whe∣ther
the tyranny reside in a single person, or a senate, can∣not
exercise oppression at so many places at the same time,
as it may be carried on by the dominion of a numerous
nobility over their respective vassals and dependents. Of
<PB N="456" REF="496"/>
all species of domination this is the most odious:—the
freedom and satisfaction of private life are more constrain∣ed
and harrassed by it, than by the most vexatious laws,
or even by the lawless will of an arbitrary monarch; from
whose knowledge, and whose injustice, the greatest part of
his subjects are removed by their distance, or concealed
by their obscurity.</P>
<P>Europe exhibits more than one modern example, where
the people, aggrieved by the exactions, or provoked by
the enormities, of their immediate superiors, have joined
with the reigning prince in the overthrow of the aristocra∣cy,
and deliberately exchanged their condition for the
miseries of despotism. About the middle of the last cen∣tury,
the commons of Denmark, weary of the oppres∣sions
which they had long suffered from the nobles, and
exasperated by some recent insults, presented themselves
at the foot of the throne, with a formal offer of their
consent to establish unlimited dominion in the king.
The revolution in Sweden, still more lately, brought
about with the acquiescence, not to say the assistance of
the people, owed its success to the same cause, namely,
the prospect of deliverance, that it afforded, from the ty∣ranny
which their nobles exercised under the old constitu∣tion.
In England the people beheld the depression of the
Barons, under the house of Tudor, with satisfaction, al∣though
they saw the crown ascending thereby to a height
of power which no limitations, that the constitution had
then provided, were likely to confine. The lesson to be
<PB N="457" REF="497"/>
drawn from such events is this, that a mixed govern∣ment,
which admits a patrician order into its constitution,
ought to circumscribe the personal privileges of the nobi∣lity,
especially claims of hereditary jurisdiction and local
authority, with a jealousy proportioned to the solicitude
with which it provides for its own preservation. For no∣thing
so alienates the minds of the people, from the
government under which they live, by a perpetual sense of
annoyance and inconveniency; or so prepares them for the
practices of an enterprising prince, or a factious demagogue,
as the abuse which almost always accompanies the exist∣ence
of separate immunities.</P>
<P>Amongst the inferior, but by no means inconsiderable
advantages of a DEMOCRATIC constitution, or of a consti∣tution
in which the people partake of the power of legis∣lation;
the following should not be neglected.</P>
<P>I. The direction which it gives to the education,
studies and pursuits of the superior orders of the commu∣nity.
The share which this has in forming the public
manners and character is very important. In countries,
in which the gentry are excluded from all concern in the
government, scarce any thing is left which leads to ad∣vancement,
but the profession of arms. They who do
not addict themselves to this profession, (and miserable
must that country be, which constantly employs the mi∣litary
service of a great proportion of any order of its sub∣jects,)
are commonly lost by the mere want of object and
<PB N="458" REF="498"/>
destination; that is, they fall, without reserve, into the
most sottish habits of animal gratification, or entirely de∣vote
themselves to the attainment of those futile arts and
exterior decorations, which compose the business and re∣commendation
of a court: on the other hand; where the
whole, or any effective portion of civil power is possessed
by a popular assembly, more serious pursuits will be en∣couraged,
purer morals and a more intellectual character
will engage the public esteem; that knowledge, and
those faculties, which qualify men for deliberation and
debate, and which are the fruit of sober habits, of early
and long continued application, will be roused and ani∣mated
by the reward, which, of all others, most readily
awakens the ambition of the human mind, political di∣gnity
and importance.</P>
<P>II. Popular elections procure to the common people
courtesy from their superiors. That contemptuous and
overbearing insolence, with which the lower orders of
the community are wont to be treated by the higher, is
greatly mitigated where the people have something to
give. The assiduity, with which their favour is sought
upon these occasions, serves to generate settled habits of
condescension and respect; and as human life is more em∣bittered
by affronts than injuries, whatever contributes
to procure mildness and civility of manners, towards those
who are most liable to suffer from a contrary behaviour,
corrects with the pride, in a great measure, the evil of ine∣quality,
<PB N="459" REF="499"/>
and deserves to be accounted amongst the most
generous institutions of social life.</P>
<P>III. The satisfaction which people in free governments
derive from the knowledge and discussion of political sub∣jects;
of national measures, and occurrences; the proceed∣ings
and debates of the senate; the conduct and character
of ministers; the revolutions, intrigues, and contentions
of parties; the agitation of public questions. Subjects of
this fort excite just enough of interest and emotion, to af∣ford
a moderate engagement to the thoughts, without ri∣sing
up to any painful degree of anxiety, or ever leaving
a fixed oppression upon the spirits—and what is this, but
the aim and end of all those amusements, which compose
so much of the business of life and value of riches? For
my part, and I believe it to be the case with most men,
who are arrived at the middle age, and occupy the middle
classes of life; had I all the money, which I pay in taxes
to government, at liberty to lay out upon amusement and
diversion, I know not whether I could make choice of
any, in which I should find greater pleasure, than what
I receive from expecting, hearing, and relating public news;
reading parliamentary debates, and proceedings; can∣vassing
the political arguments, projects, predictions and
intelligence, which are conveyed, by various channels, to
every corner of the kingdom. These topics, exciting
universal curiosity, and being such as almost every man is
ready to form, and prepared to deliver an opinion about,
greatly promote, and, I think, improve conversation—
<PB N="460" REF="500"/>
they render it more rational and more innocent—they
supply a substitute for drinking, gaming, scandal, and
obscenity. Now the secrecy, the jealousy, the solitude
and precipitation of despotic governments exclude all this.
But the loss, you say, is trifling. I know that it is pos∣sible
to render even the mention of it ridiculous, by re∣presenting
it as the idle employment of the most insigni∣ficant
part of the nation, the folly of village-statesmen,
and coffee-house politicians: but I allow nothing to be a
trifle, which ministers to the harmless gratification of mul∣titudes;
nor any order of men to be insignificant, whose
number bears a respectable proportion to the sum of the
whole community.</P>
<P>We have been accustomed to an opinion, that a REPUB∣LICAN
form of government suits only with the affairs of a
small state: which opinion is founded in these consider∣ations,
that unless the people, in every district of the em∣pire,
be admitted to a share in the national representation,
the government is not, as to <HI>them,</HI> a republic; that elec∣tions,
where the constituents are numerous, and dispersed
through a wide extent of country, are conducted with
difficulty, or rather, indeed, managed by the intrigues, and
combination of a few, who are situated near the place of
election, each voter considering his single suffrage as too
minute a portion of the general interest to deserve his care
or attendance, much less to be worth any opposition to
influence and application; that whilst we contract the re∣presentation
within acompass small enough to admit of
<PB N="461" REF="501"/>
orderly debate, the interest of the constituent becomes too
small, of the representative too great. It is difficult also to
maintain any connection between them. He who
repre∣sents
two hundred thousand, is necessarily a stranger to the
greatest part of those who elect him: and when his in∣terest
amongst them ceases to depend upon an acquaint∣ance
with their persons and character, or a care and
knowledge of their affairs; when such a representative
finds the treasures and honours of a great empire at the
disposal of a few, and himself one of the few, there is
little reason to hope that he will not prefer to his public
duty, those temptations of personal aggrandizement which
his situation offers, and which the price of his vote will
always purchase. All appeal to the people is precluded
by the impossibility of collecting a sufficient proportion of
their force and numbers. The factions, and the unanimi∣ty
of the senate are equally dangerous.—Add to these con∣siderations,
that in a democratic constitution the mechan∣ism
is too complicated, and the motions too flow for the
operations of a great empire; whose defence and govern∣ment
require execution and dispatch, in proportion to the
magnitude, extent, and variety of its interests and con∣cerns.—There
is weight, no doubt, in these reasons—but
much of the objection seems to be done away by the contri∣vance
of a <HI>federal</HI> republic, which, distributing the country
into districts of a commodious extent, and leaving to each its
internal legislation, reserves only to a convention of the
states, the adjustment of their relative claims; the levying,
direction and government of the common force of the con∣federacy;
<PB N="462" REF="502"/>
the requisition of subsidies for the support of
this force; the making of peace and war; the entering
into treaties; the regulation of foreign commerce; the
equalization of duties upon imports, so as to prevent the
defrauding of the revenue of one province by smuggling
articles of taxation from the borders of another; and like∣wise,
so as to guard against undue partialities in the en∣couragement
of trade. To what limits such a republic
might, without inconvenience, enlarge its dominions, by
assuming into the confederacy neighbouring provinces; or
how far it would unite the liberty of a small common∣wealth,
with the safety of a powerful empire; or whether,
amongst co-ordinate powers, dissensions and jealousies
would not be likely to arise, which, for want of a com∣mon
superior, might proceed to fatal extremities, are
questions, upon which the records of mankind do not au∣thorize
us to decide with tolerable certainty.—The experi∣ment
is is about to be tried in America upon a large scale.</P>

<PB N="463" REF="503"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the British Constitution.</HEAD>
<P>BY the constitution of a country is meant so much of
its law, as relates to the designation and form of the
legislature; the rights and functions of the several parts
of the legislative body; the construction, office, and juris∣diction
of courts of justice. The constitution is one
principal division, head, section or title of the code
of public laws; distinguished from the rest only by the
particular nature, or superior importance of the subject of
which it treats.—Therefore the terms <HI>constitutional</HI> and
<HI>unconstitutional,</HI> mean legal and illegal. The distinction
and the ideas, which these terms denote, are founded in the
same authority with the law of the land upon any other
subject; and to be ascertained by the same inquiries. The
system of English jurisprudence is made up of acts of
parliament, of decisions of courts of law, and of imme∣morial
usages: consequently these are the principles of
which the constitution itself consists; the sources from
which all our knowledge of its nature and limitations is
<PB N="464" REF="504"/>
to be deduced, and the authorities to which all appeal
ought to be made, and by which every constitutional
doubt and question can alone be decided. This plain and
intelligible definition is the more necessary to be preserved
in our thoughts, as some writers upon the subject ab∣surdly
confound what is constitutional, with what is ex∣pedient;
pronouncing forthwith a measure to be unconsti∣tutional,
which they adjudge in any respect to be detri∣mental
or dangerous: whilst others again, ascribe a kind
of transcendent authority, or mysterious sanctity, to the
constitution, as if it were founded in some higher origi∣nal
than that which gives force and obligation to the
ordinary laws and statutes of the realm, or were inviolable
on any other account than its intrinsic utility. An act of
parliament, in England, can never be unconstitutional,
in the strict and proper acceptation of the term; in a lower
sense it may, viz. when it militates with the spirit, con∣tradicts
the analogy, or defeats the provision of other
laws, made to regulate the form of government. Even
that flagitious abuse of their trust, by which a parliament
of Henry the Eighth conferred upon the king's proclama∣tion
the authority of law, was unconstitutional only in
this latter sense.</P>
<P>Most of those who treat of the British constitution,
consider it as a scheme of government formally planned
and contrived by our ancestors, in some certain aera of our
national history, and as set up in pursuance of such regular
plan and design. Something of this sort is secretly sup∣posed,
<PB N="465" REF="505"/>
or referred to, in the expressions of those who
speak of the “principles of constituton,” of bringing
back the constitution to its “first principles,” of restoring
it to its “original purity,” or primitive model." Now
this appears to me an erroneous conception of the subject.
No such plan was ever formed, consequently no such first
principles, original model, or standard, exist. I mean there
never was a date, or point of time in our history, when
the government of England was to be set up a new, and
when it was referred to any single person, or assembly, or
committee, to frame a charter for the future government
of the country; or when a constitution, so prepared and
digested, was by common consent received and established.
In the time of the civil wars, or rather between the death
of Charles the First, and the restoration of his son, many
such projects were published, but none carried into execu∣tion.
The great charter, and the bill of rights, were
wise and strenuous efforts to obtain security against certain
abuses of regal power, by which the subject had been
aggrieved; but they were, either of them, much too par∣tial
modifications of the constitution to give it a new set∣tlement
or original. The constitution of England, like
that of most countries in Europe, hath grown out of oc∣casion
and emergency; from the various policy of differ∣ent
ages; the contentions, successes, interests, and oppor∣tunities
of different orders and parties of men in the com∣munity.
It resembles one of those old mansions, which,
instead of being built at once, after a regular plan, and ac∣cording
to the rules of architecture, has been reared in
<PB N="466" REF="506"/>
different ages of the art, altered from time to time, and
has been continually receiving additions and repairs
suited
to the taste, fortune or conveniency of its successive pro∣prietors.
In such a building we look in vain for the ele∣gance
and proportion, the just order and correspondence
of parts, which we expect in a modern edifice; and which
external symetry, after all, contributes more perhaps to the
amusement of the beholder, than the accommodation of the
inhabitant.</P>
<P>In the British, and possibly in all other constitutions,
there exists a wide difference between the actual state of
the government and the theory. The one results from
the other; but still they are different. When we con∣template
the <HI>theory</HI> of the British government, we see the
King invested with the most absolute personal impunity;
with a power of rejecting laws, which have been resolved
upon by both houses of parliament; of conferring by his
charter, upon any set or succession of men he pleases,
the privilege of sending representatives into one house of
parliament, as by his immediate appointment he can place
whom he will in the other. What is this, a foreigner
might ask, but a more circuitous despotism? Yet, when
we turn our attention from the legal existence to the ac∣tual
exercise of royal authority in England, we see these
formidable prerogatives dwindled into mere ceremonies;
and in their stead, a sure and commanding influence, of
which the constitution, it seems, is totally ignorant, grow∣ing
out of that enormous patronage, which the increased
<PB N="467" REF="507"/>
extent, and opulence of the empire has placed in the dis∣posal
of the executive magistrate.</P>
<P>Upon questions of government the habit of reflection
to be encouraged, is a sober comparison of our present
constitution, not with models of speculative perfection,
but with the actual chance of obtaining a better. This
turn of thought will generate a political disposition,
equally removed from that puerile admiration, which sees
no fault, and can endure no change, and that distempered
sensibility, which is alive only to perceptions of inconve∣niency,
and too impatient to be delivered from its present
uneasiness, to compute either the peril, or expence of the
remedy. Political innovations commonly produce many
effects besides those that are intended. The direct conse∣quence
is often the least important. Incidental, remote,
and unthought of evils or advantages frequently exceed
the good that is designed, or the inconveniency that is
foreseen. It is from the silent and unobserved operation;
the obscure progress of causes, set at work for different
purposes, that the greatest revolutions take their rise.
When the Barons, in the reign of Henry the Seventh,
sued for the liberty of alienating their estates, they little
suspected, that they were petitioning for the downfall of
their order; or that they were laying the foundations of
despotism, upon the ruins of the aristocracy. When
Elizabeth, and her immediate successor, applied themselves
to the encouragement and regulation of trade by many
wise laws, they knew not, that, together with wealth
<PB N="468" REF="508"/>
and industry, they were diffusing a consciousness of
strength and independency, which would not long endure,
under the forms of a mixed government, the dominion
of arbitrary princes. When it was debated whether the
mutiny act, the law by which the army is governed and
maintained, should be temporary or perpetual, little else
probably, occurred to the advocates of an annual bill, than
the expediency of retaining a control over the most dan∣gerous
prerogative of the crown—the direction and com∣mand
of a standing army: whereas, in its effect, this
single reservation has altered the whole frame and quality
of the British constitution. For since, in consequence of
the military system, which prevails in neighbouring and
rival nations, as well as on account of the internal exigen∣ces
of government, a standing army has become essential
to the safety and administration of the empire, it enables
parliament, by discontinuing this necessary provision, so to
enforce its resolutions upon any other subject, as to render
the king's dissent to a law, which has received the appro∣bation
of both houses, too dangerous an experiment any
longer to be advised. A contest between the king and
parliament, cannot now be persevered in, without a dis∣solution of the government.—Lastly, when the constitu∣tion
conferred upon the crown the nomination to all em∣ployments
in the public service, the authors of this
arrangement were led to it, by the obvious propriety of
leaving to a master the choice of his servants; and the
manifest inconveniency of engaging the national council,
upon every vacancy, in those personal contests which at∣tend
<PB N="469" REF="509"/>
elections to places of honour and emolument. Our
ancestors did not observe that this disposition would add
an influence to the regal office, which, as the number
and value of public employments increased, would super∣sede
in a great measure the forms, and change the charac∣ter
of the ancient constitution. They knew not, what
the experience and reflection of modern ages has disco∣vered,
that patronage universally is power; that he who
possesses in a sufficient degree the means of gratifying the
desires of mankind after wealth and distinction, by what∣ever
checks and forms his authority may be limited or
disguised, will direct the management of public affairs.
Whatever be the mechanism of the political engine, he
will guide the motion. These instances are adduced to
illustrate the proposition we laid down, that, in politics,
the most important and permanent effects have been,
for the most part, incidental, and unforeseen: and this
proposition we would inculcate, for the sake of the caution
which it teaches, that changes ought not to be adventur∣ed
upon without a <HI>comprehensive</HI> discernment of the con∣sequences,—without
a knowledge, as well of the remote
tendency, as the immediate design. The courage of a
statesman should resemble that of a commander, who,
however regardless of personal danger, never forgets, that
with his own he commits the lives and fortunes of a mul∣titude;
and who does not consider it as any proof of zeal
or valour, to stake the safety of <HI>other</HI> men, upon the suc∣cess
of a perilous or desperate enterprize.</P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="510"/>
There is one end of civil government peculiar to a good
constitution, namely, the happiness of its subjects; there
is another end essential to a good government, but com∣mon
to it with many bad ones,—its own preservation.
Observing that the best form of government would be de∣fective,
which did not provide for its own permanency,
in our political reasonings we consider all such provisions
as expedient; and are content to accept as a sufficient ex∣cuse
for any measure, or regulation, that it is necessary or
conducive to the security of the constitution. Yet, in
truth, such provisions are absolutely expedient, and such an
excuse final, only whilst the constitution is worth preserv∣ing—that
is, until it can be exchanged for a better. I
premise this distinction, because many things in the Eng∣lish,
as in every constitution, are to be vindicated and ac∣counted
for solely from their tendency to maintain the
government in its present state, and the several parts of it
in possession of the powers which the constitution has
assigned them; and because I would wish it to be remarked
that such a consideration is always subordinate to another—the
value and usefulness of the constitution itself.</P>
<P><HI>The Government of England,</HI> which has been sometimes
called a mixed government, sometimes a limited monar∣chy,
is formed by a combination of the three regular spe∣cies
of government; the monarchy, residing in the King;
the aristocracy, in the House of Lords; and the republic
being represented by the House of Commons. The per∣fection
intended by such a scheme of government is, to
<PB N="471" REF="511"/>
unite the advantages of the several simple forms, and to
exclude the inconveniences. To what degree this purpose
is attained or attainable in the British constitution; wherein
it is lost sight of or neglected; and by what means it may
in any part be promoted with better suceess, the reader
will be enabled to judge, by a separate recollection of
these advantages and inconveniences, as enumerated in the
preceding chapter, and a distinct application of each to the
political condition of this country. We will present our
remarks upon the subject in an enumeration of the expe∣dients
by which the British constitution provides.</P>
<P>1st, For the interest of its subjects.</P>
<P>2dly, For its own preservation.</P>
<P>The contrivances for the first of these purposes are the
following:</P>
<P>In order to promote the establishment of salutary
public laws, every citizen of the state is capable of be∣coming
a member of the senate; and every senator possesses
the right of propounding to the deliberation of the legis∣lature
whatever law he pleases.</P>
<P>Every district of the empire enjoys the privilege of
chusing representatives, informed of the interests and
circumstances and desires of their constituents, and en∣titled
by their situation to communicate that information
<PB N="472" REF="512"/>
to the national council. The meanest subject has some
one whom he can call upon to bring forward his com∣plaints
and requests to public attention.</P>
<P>By annexing the right of voting for members of the
House of Commons to different qualifications in different
places, each order and profession of men in the commu∣nity,
become virtually represented; that is, men of all
orders and professions, statesmen, courtiers, country
gentlemen, lawyers, merchants, manufacturers, soldiers,
sailors, interested in the prosperity, and experienced in
the occupation of their respective professions, obtain seats
in parliament.</P>
<P>The elections, at the same time, are so connected with
the influence of landed property as to afford a certainty
that a considerable number of men of great estates will be
returned to parliament; and are also so modified, that
men the most eminent and successful in their respective
professions, are the most likely, by their riches, or the
weight of their stations, to prevail in these competitions.</P>
<P>The number, fortune, and quality of the members;
the variety of interests and characters amongst them;
above all, the temporary duration of their power, and the
change of men which every new election produces, are so
many securities to the public, as well against the subjec∣tion
of their judgments to any external dictation, as
<PB N="473" REF="513"/>
against the formation of a junto in their own body, suf∣ficiently
powerful to govern their decisions.</P>
<P>The representatives are so intermixed with the consti∣tuents,
and the constituents with the rest of the people,
that they cannot, without a partiality too flagrant to be
endured, impose any burthen upon the subject, in which
they do not share themselves; nor scarcely can they adopt
an advantageous regulation, in which their own interests
will not participate of the advantage.</P>
<P>The proceedings and debates of parliament, and the
parliamentary conduct of each representative, are known
by the people at large.</P>
<P>The representative is so far dependent upon the consti∣tuent,
and political importance upon public favour, that
every senator, by contriving and patronizing laws and
measures of public utility, most effectually recommends
himself to eminence and advancement in the state.</P>
<P>When intelligence of the condition, wants, and occa∣sions
of the people, is thus collected from every quarter,
and so many understandings are set at work upon the sub∣ject,
it may be presumed, that the most eligible council,
expedient, remedy or improvement, will occur to some
one or other: and when a wise council, or beneficial regula∣tion
is once suggested, it may be expected, from the dis∣position
of an assembly so constituted as the British
<PB N="474" REF="514"/>
House of Commons is, that it cannot fail of receiving the
approbation of the majority.</P>
<P>To prevent those destructive contentions for the su∣preme
power, which are sure to take place, where the
members of the state do not live under an acknowledged
head, and a known rule of succession; to preserve the
people in tranquillity at home, by a speedy and vigorous
execution of the laws; to protect their interest abroad,
by strength and energy in military operations, by those
advantages of decision, secrecy, and dispatch, which be∣long
to the resolutions of monarchical councils;—for these
purposes, the constitution has committed the executive
government to the administration and limited authority
of an hereditary King.</P>
<P>In the defence of the empire; in the maintenance of its
power, dignity, and privileges, with foreign nations; and
in the providing for the general administration of muni∣cipal
justice, by a proper choice and appointment of ma∣gistrates,
the inclination of the king and of the people,
usually coincide: in this part, therefore, of the regal
office, the constitution entrusts the prerogative with
ample powers.</P>
<P>The dangers principally to be apprehended from regal
government, relate to the two articles, of taxation and
punishment. In every form of government, from which
the people are excluded, it is the interest of the governors
<PB N="475" REF="515"/>
to get as much, and of the governed to give as little as
they can: and the power of punishment, in the hands of
an arbitrary prince oftentimes becomes an engine of ex∣tortion,
jealousy, and revenge;—wisely therefore, hath
the British constitution guarded the safety of the people,
in these two points, by the most studious precautions.</P>
<P>Upon that of taxation; every law, which, by the re∣motest
construction, may be deemed to levy money upon
the property of the subject, must originate, that is, must
first be proposed and assented to, in the House of Com∣mons:
by which regulation, accompanying the weight
which that assembly possesses in all its functions, the
levying of taxes is almost exclusively reserved to the po∣pular
part of the constitution, who it is presumed will not
tax themselves, or their fellow subjects, without being
convinced of the necessity of the aids which they grant.</P>
<P>The application also of the public supplies, is watched
with the same circumspection, as the assessment. Many
taxes are annual; the produce of others, is mortgaged or
appropriated to specific services; the expenditure of all of
them, is accounted for to the house of commons; as
computations of the charge of the purpose, for which
they are wanted, are previously submitted to the same
tribunal.</P>
<P>In the infliction of punishment, the power of the crown
and of the magistrate appointed by the crown, is confined
<PB N="476" REF="516"/>
by the most precise limitations: the guilt of the offender
must be pronounced by twelve men of his own order,
indifferently chosen out of the county where the offence
was committed: the punishment, or the limits to which
the punishment may be extended, are ascertained and af∣fixed
to the crime, by laws, which knew not the person
of the criminal.</P>
<P>And whereas the arbitrary and clandestine seizure and
confinement of the person is the injury most to be dread∣ed
from the strong hand of the executive government,
because it deprives the prisoner at once of protection and
defence, and delivers him into the power, and to the ma∣licious
or interested designs of his enemies; the constitu∣tion
has provided against this danger with extreme soli∣citude.
The ancient writ of habeas corpus, the habeas
corpus act of Charles the Second, and the practice and
determinations of our sovereign courts of justice founded
upon these laws, afford a complete remedy, for every con∣ceivable
case of illegal imprisonment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon complaint in writing by, or on behalf of any person in confine∣ment, to any of the four courts of Westminster Hall, in term time, or to the Lord Chancellor, or one of the Judges, in the vacation; and upon a probable reason being suggested to question the legality of the detention, a writ is issued, to the person in whose custody the complainant is alledged to be, commanding him within a certain limited and short time to produce the body of the prisoner, and the authority under which he is detained. Upon the return of the writ, strict and instantaneous obedience to which is enforced by very severe penalties, if no lawful cause of imprisonment appear, the court or judge, before whom the prisoner is brought, is au∣thorized and bound to discharge him; even though he may have been com∣mitted by a secretary, or other high officer of state, by the privy council, or by the King in person: so that no subject of this realm can be held in confinement, by any power, or under any pretence whatever, provided he can find means to convey his complaint to one of the four courts of Westminster Hall, or, during their recess, to any of the Judges of the same, unless all these several tribunals agree in determining his imprisoment to be legal. He may make application to them, in succession; and if one out of the number be found, who thinks the prisoner entitled to his liberty, that one possesses authority to restore it to him.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="477" REF="517"/>
Treason being that charge, under colour of which the
destruction of an obnoxious individual is often sought; and
government being at all times more immediately a party
in the prosecution; the law, beside the general care with
which it watches over the safety of the accused, in this
case, sensible of the unequal contest in which the subject
is engaged, has assisted his defence with extraordinary in∣dulgences.
By two statutes, enacted since the revolution,
every person indicted for high treason shall have a copy
of his indictment, a list of the witnesses to be produced,
and of the jury impanelled, delivered to him ten days be∣fore
the trial; he is also permitted to make his defence
by council—privileges which are not allowed to the pri∣soner,
in a trial for any other crime: and, what is of more
importance to the party than all the rest, two witnesses,
at the least, are required to convict a person of treason;
whereas one positive witness is sufficient in almost every
other species of accusation.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="518"/>
We proceed, in the second place, to enquire in what
manner the constitution has provided for its own preserva∣tion;
that is, in what manner each part of the legislature
is secured in the exercise of the powers assigned to it,
from the incroachment of the other parts. This security
is sometimes called the <HI>balance of the constitution;</HI> and the
political equilibrium, which this phrase denotes, consists
in two contrivances,—a balance of power, and a balance
of interest. By a balance of power is meant, that
there is no power possessed by one part of the legislature,
whose abuse, or excess, is not checked by some antagonist
power, residing in another part. Thus the power of the
two houses of parliament to frame laws is checked by the
king's negative; that if laws subversive of regal govern∣ment
should obtain the consent of parliament, the reign∣ing
prince, by interposing his prerogative, may save the
necessary rights and authority of his station. On the
other hand, the arbitrary application of this negative is
checked by the privilege which parliament possesses, of
refusing supplies of money to the exigences of the King's
administration. The constitutional maxim, “that the
king can do no wrong,” is balanced by another maxim,
not less constitutional, “that the illegal commands of
the king, do not justify those who assist, or concur, in
carrying them into execution;” and by a second rule, sub∣sidiary
to this, “that the acts of the crown acquire not
any legal force, until authenticated by the subscription of
some of its great officers.” As the King could not be pun∣ished,
without a civil war, the constitution wisely exempts
<PB N="479" REF="519"/>
his person from trial or account; but, left this impunity
should encourage a licentious exercise of dominion, vari∣ous
obstacles are opposed to the private will of the sove∣reign,
when directed to illegal objects. The pleasure
of the crown must be announced with certain solemnities,
and attested by certain officers of state. In some cases,
the royal order must be signified by a secretary of state; in
others, it must pass under the privy seal, and in many,
under the great seal. And when the King's command is
regularly published, no mischief can be atchieved by it,
without the ministry and compliance of those to whom it
is directed. Now all who either concur in an illegal or∣der,
by authenticating its publication with their seal or
subscription, or who assist in the execution of it, subject
themselves to prosecution and punishment, for the part
they have taken; and are not permitted to plead or pro∣duce
the command of the king, in justification of their
obedience. And, that the crown may not protect its ser∣vants,
in a criminal submission to their matter's desires,
by the power, which in general belongs to its authority, of
pardoning offences, and of remitting the sentence of the
law, prosecutions by impeachment, which is the usual
way of proceeding against offenders of this sort, are ex∣cepted
out of that prerogative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amongst the checks, which parliament holds over the administration of public affairs, I forbear to mention the practice of addressing the King, to know by whose advice he resolved upon a particular measure, and of punishing the authors of that advice, for the council they had given. Not because I think this method either unconstitutional or improper, but for this reason, that it does not so much subject the king to the control of par∣liament, as it supposes him to be already in subjection. For if the King were so far out of the reach of the resentment of the house of commons, as to be able, with safety, to refuse the information requested, or to take upon himself the responsibility inquired after, there must be an end of all proceedings founded in this mode of application.</NOTE>.—The power of the crown
<PB N="480" REF="520"/>
to direct the military force of the kingdom, is balanc∣ed
by the annual necessity of resorting to parliament for
the maintenance and government of that force. The
power of the king to declare war, is checked by the pri∣vilege
of the house of commons, to grant or withhold
the supplies by which the war must be carried on. The
king's choice of his ministers is controlled by the obli∣gation
he is under of appointing those men to offices in
the state, who are found capable of managing the affairs
of his government, with the two houses of parliament.
Which consideration imposes such a necessity upon the
crown, as hath in a great measure subdued the influence
of favouritism; insomuch, that it is become no uncom∣mon
spectacle in this country, to see men promoted by
the king to the highest offices, and richest preferments,
which he has in his power to bestow, who have been dis∣tinguished
by their opposition to his personal inclinations.</P>
<P>By the <HI>balance of interest,</HI> which accompanies and gives
efficacy to the <HI>balance of power,</HI> is meant this, that the
respective interests of the three estates of the empire are so
disposed and adjusted, that whichever of the three shall
<PB N="481" REF="521"/>
attempt any encroachment, the other two will unite in
resisting it. If the king should endeavour to extend his
authority, by contracting the power and privileges of the
commons, the house of lords would see their own dignity
endangered by every advance which the crown made
to independency upon the resolutions of parliament.
The admission of arbitrary power is no less formidable
to the grandeur of the aristocracy, than it is fatal to the
liberty of the republic; that is, it would reduce the nobility
from the hereditary share they possess in the national coun∣cils,
in which their real greatness consists, to the making
them a part of the empty pageantry of a despotic court. On
the other hand, if the house of commons should intrench
upon the distinct province, or usurp the established prero∣gative
of the crown, the house of lords would receive an
instant alarm from every new stretch of popular power.
In any contest in which the king may be engaged with
the representative body, in defence of his established share
of authority, he will find a natural and sure ally in the
collective power of the nobility. An attachment to the
monarchy, from which they derive their own distinction;
the allurements of a court, in the habits and with the
sentiments of which they have been brought up; their
hatred of equality, and of all levelling pretensions, which
may ultimately affect the privileges, or even the existence
of their order; in short, every principle and every preju∣dice
which are wont to actuate human conduct, will de∣termine
their choice, to the side and support of the crown.
<PB N="482" REF="522"/>
Lastly, if the nobles themselves should attempt to revive
the superiorities, which their ancestors exercised under
the feudal constitution, the king and the people would
alike remember, how the one had been insulted, and the
other enslaved, by that barbarous tyranny. They would
forget the natural opposition of their views and inclinations,
when they saw themselves threatened with the return of
a domination, which was odious and intolerable to both.</P>
<P>The reader will have observed, that in describing the
British constitution little notice has been taken of the house of lords. The proper use and design of this
part of the constitution, are the following: First, to
enable the king, by his right of bestowing the peerage,
to reward the servants of the public, in a manner most
grateful to them, and at a small expence to the nation;
secondly, to fortify the power and secure the stability of
regal government, by an order of men allied to its inteterests;
and, thirdly, for a purpose, which, though of
superior importance to the other two, does not occur so
readily to our observation. Large bodies of men are sub∣ject
to sudden phrenzies. I mean, that opinions may be
circulated amongst a multitude without proof or exami∣nation,
acquiring confidence and reputation merely by
being repeated from one to another; and that passions
founded upon these opinions, diffusing themselves with a
rapidity that can neither be accounted for nor resisted,
sometimes agitate a country with the most violent com∣motions.
Now the only way to stop the sermentation, is
<PB N="483" REF="523"/>
to divide the mass; that is, to erect different orders in the
community, with separate prejudices and interests. And
this may, occasionally, become the use of an hereditary
nobility, invested with a share of legislation, namely, to
stem the progress of popular fury. Averse to those preju∣dices,
which actuate the minds of the vulgar; accustom∣ed
to contemn the clamour of the populace; disdaining to
receive laws and opinions from their inferiors in rank,
they will oppose resolutions, which are founded in the
folly and violence of the lower part of the community.
Was the voice of the people always dictated by reflection;
did eyery man, or even one man in an hundred think for
himself, or actually consider the measure he was about to
approve or censure; or even were the common people
tolerably steadfast in the judgment which they formed, I
should hold the interference of a superior order, not only
superfluous, but bad: for, when every thing is allowed to
difference of rank and education, which the actual state of
these advantages deserves, that, after all, is most likely to
be right and expedient, which appears to be so to the se∣parate
judgment and decision of a great majority of the
nation; at least, that, in general, is right <HI>for them,</HI> which
is agreeable to their fixed opinions and desires: But when
we observe, what is urged as the public opinion, to be, in
truth, the opinion only, or perhaps the seigned professions
of a few crafty, leaders; that the numbers, who join in the
cry, serve only to swell and multiply the sound, without
any accession of judgment, or exercise of understanding; and
that oftentimes the wisest councils have been thus over∣borne
<PB N="484" REF="524"/>
by tumult and uproar,—we may conceive occasions
to arise, in which the commonwealth may be saved by
the reluctance of the nobility to yield to the vehemence,
or adopt the caprices of the common people. In expecting
this advantage from an order of nobles, we do not suppose
the nobility to be more unprejudiced than others; but
that their prejudices will be different, and may occasion∣ally
counteract those of others.</P>
<P>If the personal privileges of the peerage, which are
usually so many injuries to the rest of the community, be
restrained, I see little inconvenience in the increase of its
number; for it is only dividing the same quantity of
power amongst more hands, which is rather favourable to
public freedom, than otherwise.</P>
<P>The admission of a small number of ecclesiastics into
the House of Lords, is but an equitable compensation to
the clergy for the exclusion of their order from the house
of commons. They are a set of men considerable by their
number and property, as well as by their influence, and
the duties of their station; yet, whilst every other pro∣fession has those amongst the national representatives,
who, being conversant in the same occupation, are able
to state, and naturally disposed to support the rights and
interests of the class and calling to which they belong,
the clergy alone are deprived of this advantage. If the
Bishops, from gratitude or expectation, be more obse∣quious
to the will of the crown, than those who possess
<PB N="485" REF="525"/>
great temporal inheritances, they are properly inserted
into that part of the constitution, from which much or
frequent resistance to the measures of government is not
expected.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, that I perceive no sufficient reason for
exempting the persons of members of either house of par∣liament
from arrest for debt. The councils or suffrage of
a single senator, especially of one who in the manage∣ment
of his own affairs may justly be suspected of a want
of prudence or honesty, can seldom be so necessary to those
of the public, as to justify a departure from that whole∣some
policy, by which the laws of a commercial state
punish and stigmatize insolvency. The prospect of dis∣grace
might make such men more provident. But what∣ever
reason may be pleaded for their <HI>personal</HI> immunity,
when this privilege of parliament is extended to domestics
and retainers, or when it is permitted to impede or delay
the course of judicial proceedings, it becomes an absurd
sacrifice of equal justice to imaginary dignity.</P>
<P>There is nothing, in the British constitution, so re∣markable,
as the irregularity of the popular representation.
The house of commons consists of five hundred and forty
eight members, of whom, two hundred are elected by seven
thousand constituents: so that a majority of these seven
thousand, without any reasonable title to superior weight
and influence in the state, may, under certain circum∣stances,
decide a question against the opinion of as many
<PB N="486" REF="526"/>
millions. Or, to place the same object in another point of
view; if my estate be situated in one county of the king∣dom,
I possess the ten thousandth part of a single represen∣tative;
if in another, the thousandth; if in a particular
district, I may be one in twenty who choose two represen∣tatives;
if in a still more favoured spot, I may enjoy the right
of appointing two myself. If I have been born, or dwell,
or have served an apprenticeship in one town, I am, repre∣sented
in the national assembly by two deputies, in the
choice of whom, I exercise an actual and sensible share of
power; if accident has thrown my birth, or habitation, or
service into another town, I have no representative at all,
nor any more power or concern in he election of those
who make the laws, by which I am governed, than if I
was a subject of the Grand Seignior—and this partiality
subsists without any pretence whatever of merit or public
propriety, to justify, the preference of one place to another.
Or, thirdly, to describe the state of national representation
as it exists in reality; it may be affirmed, I believe, with
truth, that about one half of the house of commons ob∣tain
their seats in that assembly by the election of the
people, the other half by purchase, or the nomination of
single proprietors of great estates.</P>
<P>This is a flagrant incongruity in the constitution; but
is is one of those objections which strike most forcibly at
first fight. The effect of all reasoning upon the subject
is to diminish the first impression: on which account it
deserves the more attentive examination, that we may be
<PB N="487" REF="527"/>
assured, before we adventure upon a reformation, that the
magnitude of the evil justifies the danger of the experiment.
In the few remarks that follow, we would be understood,
in the first place, to decline all conference with those
who wish to alter the form of government of these king∣doms.
The reformers with whom we have to do, are
they, who, whilst they change this part of the system,
would retain the rest. If any Englishman expect more
happiness to his country under a republic, he may very
consistently recommend a new modelling of elections to
parliament; because, if the king and house of lords were
laid aside, the present disproportionate representation
would produce nothing but a confused and ill-digested oli∣garchy.
In like manner we wave a controversy, with
those writers who insist upon representation as a <HI>natural</HI>
right<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this right be <HI>natural,</HI> no doubt it must be equal, and the right, we may add, of one sex, as well as of the other. Whereas every plan of representation, that we have heard of, begins, by excluding the votes of women: thus cutting off, at a single stroke, one half of the public from a right which is asserted to be inherent in all; a right too, as they represent it, not only universal, but unalienable and indeseasable.</NOTE>: we consider it so far only as a right at all, as it
conduces to public utility; that is, as it contributes to the
establishment of good laws, or secures to the people the
just administration of these laws. These effects depend
upon the political conduct, and that conduct upon the
disposition and abilities of the national counsellors. Where∣fore,
if men the most likely by their qualifications to
know and to promote the public interest, be actually re∣turned
<PB N="488" REF="528"/>
to parliament, it signifies little who return them.
If the properest persons be elected, what matters it by
whom they are elected? At least, no prudent statesman
would subvert long established or even settled rules of re∣presentation,
without a prospect of procuring wiser or
better representatives. This then being well observed,
let us, before we seek to obtain any thing more, consider
duely what we already have. We <HI>have</HI> a House of Com∣mons
composed of five hundred and forty-eight members,
in which number are found, the most considerable land∣holders
and merchants of the kingdom; the heads of the
army, the navy, and the law; the occupiers of great
offices in the state; together with many private individu∣als,
eminent by their knowledge, eloquence, or activity.
Now, if the country be not safe in such hands, in whose
may it conside its interests? If such a number of such
men be liable to the influence of corrupt motives, what
assembly of men will be secure from the same danger?
Does any new scheme of representation promise to collect
together more wisdom, or produce firmer integrity? In
this view of the subject, and attending not to ideas of ab∣stract
proportion and regularity, (of which many minds are
much enamoured,) but to effects alone, we may discover
just excuses for those parts of the present representation,
which appear to a hasty observer most exceptionable and
absurd. It should be remembered as a maxim extremely
applicable to this subject, that no order or assembly of
men whatever can long maintain their place and authority
in a mixed government, of which, the members do not
<PB N="489" REF="529"/>
individually possess a respectable share of personal import∣ance.
Now, whatever may be the defects of the present
arrangement, it infallibly secures a great weight of pro∣perty
to the house of commons, by rendering many seats
in that house accessible to men of large fortunes, and to
those alone—by which means such men are engaged in
the defence of the separate rights and interests of this
branch of the legislature as are best able to support its
claims. The constitution of most of the small boroughs,
especially the burgage tenure, though not formed with
this design, contributes to the same effect; for the appoint∣ment
of the representatives we find commonly annexed to
certain great inheritances. Elections purely popular are
in this respect uncertain: in times of tranquillity, the na∣tural
ascendency of wealth will prevail; but when the
minds of men are inflamed by political dissentions, this in∣fluence
often yields to more impetuous motives. The
variety of tenures and qualifications, upon which the
right of voting is founded, appears to me a recommendation
of the mode which now subsists, as it tends to introduce
into parliament a corresponding mixture of characters and
professions. It has been long observed that conspicuous
abilities are most frequently sound with the representatives
of small boroughs. And this is nothing more than what
the laws of human conduct might teach us to expect:
when such boroughs are set to sale, those men are likely
to become purchasers, who are enabled by their talents to
make the best of their bargain: when a seat is not sold, but
given by the opulent proprietor of a burgage tenure, the
<PB N="490" REF="530"/>
patron finds his own interest consulted, by the repu∣tation
and abilities of the member, whom he nominates.
If certain of the nobility hold the appointment of some
part of the house of commons, it serves to maintain that
alliance between the two branches of the legislature, which
no good citizen would wish to see dissevered: it helps
to keep the government of the country in the house
of commons, in which, it would not perhaps long con∣tinue
to reside, if so powerful and wealthy a part of the na∣tion
as the peerage compose, were excluded from all share
and interest in its constitution. If there be a few boroughs
so circumstanced as to lie at the disposal of the crown,
whilst the number of such is known and small, they may
be tolerated with little danger. For where would be the
impropriety, or the inconvenience, if the King at once
should nominate a limited number of his servants to seats
in parliament; or, what is the same thing, if seats in
parliament were annexed to the possession of certain of
the most efficient and responsible offices in the state?
The present representation, after all these deductions, and
under the confusion in which it confessedly lies, is still in
such a degree popular; or rather the representatives are
so connected with the mass of the community, by a
society of interests and passions, that the will of the people,
when it is determined, permanent, and general, almost
always at length prevails.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, in the several plans which have
been suggested, of an equal or a reformed representa∣tion,
it will be difficult to discover any proposal that
has a tendency to throw more of the business of the
<PB N="491" REF="531"/>
nation into the house of commons, or to collect a set
of men more fit to transact that business, or in general
more interested in the national happiness and prosperity.
One consequence, however, may be expected from these
projects, namely, “less flexibility to the influence of the
crown.” And since the diminution of this influence, is the
declared, and perhaps the sole design of the various schemes
that have been produced, whether for regulating the elec∣tions,
contracting the duration, or for purifying the con∣stitution
of parliament by the exclusion of placemen and
pensioners; it is obvious and of importance to remark,
that the more apt and natural, as well as the more safe and
quiet way of attaining the same end, would be, by a direct
reduction of the patronage of the crown, which might be
effected to a certain extent without hazarding farther con∣sequeuces.
Superfluous and exorbitant emoluments may
not only be suppressed for the present; but provisions of
law be devised, which sould for the future restrain with∣in
certain limits, the number and value of the offices in
the donation of the king.</P>
<P>But whilst we dispute concerning different schemes of
reformation, all directed to the same end, a previous doubt
occurs in the debate, whether the end itself be good, or
even innocent—whether the influence so loudly com∣plained
of can be destroyed, or even diminished, with
safety to the state. Whilst the zeal of some men beholds
this influence with a jealousy, which nothing but its abo∣lition
can appease, many wife and virtuous politicians
<PB N="492" REF="532"/>
deem a considerable portion of it to be as necessary a part of
the British constitution, as any other ingredient in the com∣position—to
be that, indeed, which gives cohesion and
solidity to the whole. Were the measures of government,
say they, opposed from nothing but principle, government
ought to have nothing but the rectitude of its measures to
support them; but since opposition springs from other
motives, government must possess an influence to coun∣teract
that opposition—to produce, not a bias of the pas∣sions,
but a neutrality: it must have some weight to cast
into the scale to set the balance even. It is the nature
of power always to press upon the boundaries which
confine it. Licentiousness, faction, envy, impatience of
control or inferiority; the secret pleasure of mortifying
the great, or the hopes of dispossessing them; a constant
willingness to question and thwart whatever is dictated or
even proposed by another; a disposition common to all
bodies of men to extend the claims and authority of their
order; above all, that love of power, and of showing it,
which resides more or less in every human breast, and
which, in popular assemblies, is inflamed, like every other
passion, by communication and encouragement: these
motives, added to private designs and resentments, che∣rished
also by popular acclamation, and operating upon
the great share of power already possessed by the house of
commons, might induce a majority, or at least a large
party of men in that assembly, to unite in endeavouring
to draw to themselves the whole government of the state;
or at least so to obstruct the conduct of public affairs, by a
<PB N="493" REF="533"/>
wanton and perverse opposition, as to render it impossible
for the wisest statesman to carry forwards the business of
the nation in parliament, with success or satisfaction.</P>
<P>Some passages of our national history afford grounds for
these apprehensions. Before the accession of James the
First, or, at least, during the reigns of his three immedi∣ate
predecessors, the government of England was a go∣vernment
by force; that is, the king carried his measures
in parliament by <HI>intimidation.</HI> A sense of personal dan∣ger
kept the members of the house of commons in sub∣jection.
A conjunction of fortunate causes delivered at
last the parliament and nation from slavery. That over∣bearing
system, which had declined in the hands of James,
expired early in the reign of his son. After the restoration
there succeeded in its place, and since the revolution has been methodically pursued, the more successful expedient
of influence. Now we remember what passed between
the loss of terror, and the establishment of influence.
The transactions of that interval, whatever we may think
of their occasion or effect, no friend of regal government
would wish to see revived.—But the affairs of this king∣dom
afford a more recent attestation to the same doctrine.
In the British colonies of North America, the late assem∣blies
possessed much of the power and constitution of our
house of commons. The king and government of Great
Britain held no patronage in the country, which could
create attachment and influence, sufficient to counteract
that restless, arrogating spirit, which in popular assemblies,
<PB N="494" REF="534"/>
when left to itself, will never brook an authority, that
checks and interferes with its own. To this cause, exci∣ted
perhaps by some unseasonable provocations, we may
attribute, as to their true and proper original, we will not
say the misfortunes, but the changes that have taken
place in the British empire. The admonition, which
such examples suggest, will have its weight with those,
who are content with the general frame of the English
constitution; and who consider stability amongst the first
perfections of any government.</P>
<P>We protest however against any construction, by
which what is here said shall be attempted to be applied
to the justification of bribery, or of any clandestine reward or solicitation whatever. The very secrecy of such nego∣tiations
confesses or begets a consciousness of guilt; which,
when the mind is once taught to endure without uneasi∣ness,
the character is prepared for every compliance. And
there is the greater danger in these corrupt practices, as
the extent of their operation is unlimited and unknown.
Our apology relates solely to that influence, which results
from the acceptance or expectation of public preserments.
Nor does the influence, which we defend, require any sa∣crifice
of personal probity. In political, above all other
subjects, the arguments, or rather the conjectures on each
side of a question, are often so equally poized, that the
wisest judgments may be held in suspence. These I call
subjects of <HI>indifference.</HI> But again, when the subject is not
<HI>indifferent</HI> in itself, it will appear such to a great part of
those to whom it is proposed, for want of information, or
<PB N="495" REF="535"/>
reflection, or experience, or capacity to collect and weigh
the reasons by which either side is supported. These are
subjects of <HI>apparent indifference.</HI> This indifference occurs
still more frequently in personal contests; in which, we
do not often discover any reason of public utility, for the
preference of one competitor to another. These cases
compose the province of influence; that is, the decision
in these cases will inevitably be determined by influence
of some sort or other. The only question is, what in∣fluence
shall be admitted. If you remove the influence of
the crown, it is only to make way for influence from a
different quarter. If motives of expectation and gratitude
be withdrawn, other motives will succeed in their place,
acting probably in an opposite direction, but equally irre∣lative
and external to the proper merits of the question.
There exist, as we have seen, passions in the human heart,
which will always make a strong party against the execu∣tive
power of a mixed government. According as the
disposition of parliament is friendly or adverse to the re∣commendation
of the crown in matters which are really
or apparently indifferent, as indifference hath been now
explained, the business of empire will be transacted with
ease and convenience, or embarrassed with endless conten∣tion
and difficulties. Nor is it a conclusion founded in
justice or experience, that, because men are induced by
views of interest to yield their consent or support to mea∣sures,
concerning which their judgment decides nothing,
they may be brought by the same influence, to act in de∣liberate
opposition to knowledge and duty. Whoever re∣views
the operations of government in this country since
<PB N="496" REF="536"/>
the revolution, will find few even of the most questionable
measures of administration, about which the best instruc∣ted
judgment might not have doubted at the time; but of
which he may affirm with certainty, that they were
<HI>indifferent</HI> to the greatest part of those who concurred in
them. From the success or the facility, with which they
who dealt out the patronage of the crown carried measures
like these, ought we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conclude, that a similar application
of honours and emoluments would procure the consent
of parliament to councils evidently detrimental to the
common welfare? Is there not, on the contrary, more
reason to fear, that the prerogative, if deprived of influ∣ence,
would not be long able to support itself? For when
we reflect upon the power of the house of commons to
extort a compliance with its resolutions from the other
parts of the legislature; or to put to death the constitution
by a refusal of the annual grants of money, to the support
of the necessary functions of government—when we re∣flect
also, what motives there are, which, in the vicissitudes
of political interests and passions, may one day arm and
point this power against the executive magistrate—when
we attend to these considerations, we shall be led perhaps
to acknowledge, that there is not more of paradox than of
probability, in that important, but much decried apo∣thegm,
“that an independent parliament is incompatible
with the existence of the monarchy.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Administration of Justice.</HEAD>
<P>THE first maxim of a free state is, that the laws be
made by one set of men, and administered by ano∣ther;
in other words, that the legislative and judicial cha∣racters
be kept separate. When these offices are united
in the same person or assembly, particular laws are made
for particular cases, springing oftentimes from partial mo∣tives,
and directed to private ends: whilst they are kept
separate, general laws are made by one body of men,
without foreseeing whom they may affect; and when
made, must be applied by the other, let them affect whom
they will.</P>
<P>For the sake of illustration let it be supposed in this
country, either that, parliaments being laid aside, the courts
of Westminster Hall made their own law; or that the
two houses, of parliament, with the King at their head,
tried and decided, causes their bar: it is evident, in the
first place, that the decisions of such a judicature would be
so many laws; and, in the second place, that, when the
parties and the interests to be affected by the law were
<PB N="498" REF="538"/>
known, the inclinations of the law makers would inevitably
attach on one side or the other; and that, where there was neither any fixed rules to regulate their determinations,
nor any superior power to control their proceedings,, these
inclinations would interfere with the integrity of public
justice. The consequence of which must be, that the
subjects of such a constitution would live either without
any constant laws, that is, without any known pre∣established
rules of adjudication whatever; or under laws
made for particular cases and particular persons, and par∣taking
of the contradictions and iniquity of the motives,
to which they owed their origin.</P>
<P>Which dangers, by the division of the legislative and
judicial functions, are effectually provided against. Par∣liament
knows not the individuals upon whom its acts will
operate; it has no cases or parties before it; no private
designs to serve: consequently, its resolutions will be sug∣gested
by the consideration of universal effects and tenden∣cies,
which always produces impartial, and commonly ad∣vantageous
regulations. When laws are made, courts of
justice, whatever be the disposition of the judges, must
abide by them; for the legislative being necessarily the
supreme power of the state, the judicial and every other
power is accountable to that: and it cannot be doubted,
but that the persons, who possess the sovereign authority
of government, will be tenacious of the laws which they
themselves prescribe, and sufficiently jealous of the assumption
<PB N="499" REF="539"/>
sumption of dispensing and legislative powers by any others.</P>
<P>This fundamental rule of civil jurisprudence is viola∣ted
in
the case of acts of attainder, of confiscation, in bills
of pains and penalties, and in all <HI>ex post facto</HI> laws what∣ever,
in which parliament exercises the double office of
legislature and judge. And whoever, either understands
the value of the <HI>rule</HI> itself, or collects the history of those
instances, in which it has been invaded, will be induced,
I believe, to acknowledge, that it had been wiser and safer
never to have departed from it. He will confess at least,
that nothing but the most manifest and immediate peril of
the commonwealth will justify a repetition of these dan∣gerous
examples. If the laws in being do not punish an
offender, let him go unpunished; let the legislature, ad∣monished
of the defect of the laws, provide against the
commission of future crimes of the same fort. The escape
of one delinquent can never produce so much harm to the
community, as may arise from the infraction of a rule,
upon which the purity of public justice, and the existence
of civil liberty essentially depend.</P>
<P>The next security for the impartial administration of
justice, especially in decisions to which government is a
party, is the independency of the judges. As redress and
protection against every illegal attack upon the rights of
the subject by the servants of the crown are to be sought
for from these tribunals, the judges of the land become
<PB N="500" REF="540"/>
the arbitrators between the king and the people. On which
account they ought to be independent of either; or, what
is the same thing, equally dependent upon both; that is,
if they be appointed by the one, they should be remove∣able
only by the other. This was the policy, which dic∣tated
that memorable improvement in our constitution,
by which the judges, who, before the revolution, held
their offices during the pleasure of the king, can now only
be deprived of them by an address from both houses of
parliament; as the most regular, solemn, and authentic
way, by which the dissatisfaction of the people can be ex∣pressed.
To make this independency of the judges com∣plete,
the public salaries of their office ought not only
to be certain both in amount and continuance, but so
liberal as to secure their integrity from the temptation of
secret bribes: which liberality will answer also the farther
purpose of preserving their jurisdiction from contempt, and
their characters from suspicion; as well as of rendering
the station worthy of the ambition of men of eminence
in their profession.</P>
<P>A third precaution to be observed in the forming of
courts of justice, is, that the numbers of the judges be
small. For, beside that the violence and tumult insepara∣ble
from large assemblies arc inconsistent with the pa∣tience,
method, and attention requisite in judicial investi∣gations;
beside that all passions and prejudices act with
augmented force upon a collected multitude; beside these
objections, judges when they are numerous divide the
<PB N="501" REF="541"/>
shame of an unjust determination, they shelter themselves
under one another's example; each man thinks his
own character hid in the croud: for which reason the
judges ought always to be so few, that the conduct of each
may be conspicuous to public observation; that each may
be responsible in his separate and particular reputation for
the decisions in which he concurs. The truth of the re∣mark
has been exemplified in this country, in the effects
of that wife regulation, which transferred the trial of
parliamentary elections from the house of commons at
large, to a select committee of that house composed of
thirteen members. This alteration, simply by reducing
the number of the judges, and, in consequence of that
reduction, exposing the judicial conduct of each to public
animadversion, has given to a judicature, which had been
long swayed by interest and solicitation, the solemnity
and virtue of the most, upright tribunals. I should prefer
an even to an odd number of judges, and four to almost
any other number; for in this number, beside that it suf∣ficiently
consults the idea of separate responsibility, nothing
can be decided but by a majority of three to one. And
when we consider that every decision establishes a perpe∣tual
precedent, we shall allow that it ought to proceed
from an authority not less than this. If the court be
equally divided nothing is done; things remain as they
were; with some inconveniency, indeed, to the parties,
but without the danger to the public, of a, hasty precedent.</P>
<P>A fourth requisite in the constitution of a court of jus∣tice,
and equivalent to many checks upon the discretion
<PB N="502" REF="542"/>
of judges, is that its proceedings be carried on in public;
<HI>apertis soribus;</HI> not only before a promiscuous concourse of
by-standers, but in the audience of the whole profession
of the law. The opinion of the Bar concerning what
passes will be impartial; and will guide that of the pub∣lic.
The most corrupt judge will fear to indulge his dif∣honest
wishes in the presence of such an assembly: he
must encounter what few can support, the censure of his
equals and companions, together with the indignation
and reproaches of his country.</P>
<P>Something is also gained to the public by appointing
two or three courts of concurrent jurisdiction, that it may
remain in the option of the suitor to which he will resort.
By this means a tribunal which may happen to be occu∣pied
by ignorant or suspected judges, will be deserted for
others, that possess more of the confidence of the nation.</P>
<P>But, lastly, if several courts, co-ordinate to, and inde∣pendent
of each other, subsist together in the country, it
seems necessary that the appeals from all of them should
meet and terminate in the same judicature; in order that
one supreme tribunal, by whose final sentence all others
are bound and concluded, may superintend and preside
over the rest. This constitution is necessary for two pur∣poses—to
preserve an uniformity in the decisions of infe∣rior
courts, and to maintain to each the proper limits of
its jurisdiction. Without a common superior, different
courts might establish contradictory rules of adjudication,
<PB N="503" REF="543"/>
and the contradiction be final and without remedy: the
same question might receive opposite determinations, ac∣cording
as it was brought before one court or another, and
the determination in each be ultimate and irreversible. A
common appellant jurisdiction prevents or puts an end to
this confusion. For when the judgments upon appeals are
consistent, which may be expected, whilst the same court
is at last resorted to, the different courts, from which the
appeals lie, will be reduced to a like consistency with one
another. Moreover, if questions arise between courts
independent of each, other, concerning the extent and
boundaries of their respective jurisdiction, aa each will be
desirous of enlarging its own, an authority which, both
acknowledge can alone adjust the controversy. Such a
power, therefore, must reside somewhere, lest the rights
and repose of the country be distracted, by the endless op∣position
and mutual encroachment of its courts of justice.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of Judicature; the one, where the
office of the judge is permanent in the fame person, and
consequently where the judge is appointed and known
long before the trial; the other, where the judge is deter∣mined
by lot at the time of the trial, and for that turn
only. The one may be called a <HI>fixed,</HI> the other a <HI>casual</HI>
judicature. From the former may be expected those
qualifications, which are preferred and sought for in the
choice of the judges, and that knowledge and readi∣ness
which result from experience in the office. But
then, as the judge is known beforehand, he is accessible
<PB N="504" REF="544"/>
to the parties; there exists a possibility of secret manage∣ment
and undue practices: or, in contests between the
crown and the subject, the judge appointed by the crown
may be suspected of partiality to his patron; or of enter∣taining
inclinations favourable to the authority, from
which he derives his own. The advantage attending the
second kind of judicature is indifferency; the defect, the
want of that legal science, which produces uniformity and
justice in legal decisions. The construction of English
courts of law, in which causes are tried, by a jury with
the assistance of a judge, combines the two species toge∣ther
with peculiar success. This admirable contrivance
unites the wisdom of a fixed with the integrity of a casual
judicature, and avoids, in a great measure, the inconve∣niences
of both. The judge imparts to the jury the bene∣fit
of his erudition and experience; the jury, by their
disinterestedness, check any corrupt partialities which
previous application may have produced in the judge.
If the determination was left to the judge, the party
might suffer under the superior interest of his adversary:
if it was left to an uninstructed jury, his rights would be
in still greater danger, from the ignorance-of those who
were to decide upon them. The present wife admixture
of chance and choice in the constitution of the court, in
which his cause is tried, guards him equally against the
fear of injury from either of these causes.</P>
<P>In proportion to the acknowledged excellency of this
mode of trial, every deviation from it ought to be watched
<PB N="505" REF="545"/>
with vigilance, and adopted by the legislature with cau∣tion.
Summary convictions before justices of the peace,
especially for offences against the game laws; courts of
conscience; extending the jurisdiction of courts of equity;
urging too far the distinction between questions of law
and matters of fact, are all so many infringements upon
this great charter of public safety.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the trial by jury is sometimes found ina∣dequate
to the administration of equal justice. This im∣perfection
takes place chiesly in cases, in which some po∣pular
passion or prejudice intervenes; as where a particular
order of men advance claims upon the rest of the commu∣nity,
which is the case of the clergy contending for
tythes; or are obnoxious by their profession, as are officers
of the revenue, bailiffs, bailiffs followers, and other low
ministers of the law; or, where one of the parties has an
interest in common with the general interest of the jurors,
and that of the other is opposed to it, as in contests be∣tween
landlords and tenants, between lords of manors and the
holders of estates under them; or, lastly, where the minds
of men are inslamed by political dissensious or religious
hatred. These prejudices act most powerfully upon the
common people, of which order juries are made up. The
force and danger of them are also increased by the very
circumstance of taking juries but of the county in
which the subject of dispute arises. In the neighbourhood
of the parties the cause is often prejudged: and. these
secret decisions of the mind, proceed commonly more upon
<PB N="506" REF="546"/>
sentiments of favour or hatred; upon some opinion con∣cerning
the sect, family, profession, character, connections,
or circumstances of the parties, than upon any know∣ledge
or discussion of the proper merits of the question.
More exact justice would, in many instances, be rendered to
the suitors, if the determination were left entirely to the
judges; provided we could depend upon the same purity
of conduct when the power of these magistrates was en∣larged,
which they have long manifested in the exercise
of a mixed and restrained authority. But this is an expe∣riment
too big with public danger to be hazarded. The
effects, however, of some local prejudices might be safely
obviated, by a law empowering the court, in which the
action is brought, to send the cause to trial in a distant
county: the expences attending the change of place al∣ways
falling upon the party who applied for it.</P>
<P>There is a second division of courts of justice, which
presents a new alternative of difficulties. Either one, two,
or a few sovereign courts may be erected in the metropolis,
for the whole kingdom to resort to; or numerous courts of
local jurisdiction may be fixed in the various provinces and
districts of the empire. Great, though opposite incon∣veniences
attend each arrangement. If the court be remote
and solemn, it becomes, by these very qualities, ex∣pensive
and dilatory: the expence is unavoidably increased
when witnesses, parties, and agents must, be brought to
attend from distant parts of the Country: and, where the
whole judicial business of a large nation is collected into a
<PB N="507" REF="547"/>
few superior tribunals, it will be sound impossible, even
if the prolixity of forms which retards the progress of
causes were removed, <HI>to</HI> give a prompt hearing to every
complaint, or an immediate answer to any. On the
other hand, if to remedy these evils, and to render the
administration of justice cheap and speedy, domestic and
summary tribunals be erected in each neighbourhood, the
advantage of such courts will be accompanied with all the
dangers of ignorance and partiality, and the certain mis∣chief
of confusion and contrariety in their decisions. The
law of England, by its circuit or itinerary courts, contains
a provision for the distribution of private justice in a great
measure relieved from both these objections. As the pre∣siding
magistrate comes into the country a stranger to its
prejudices, rivalships, and connections, he brings with
him none of those attachments and regards;, which are so
apt to pervert the course of justice, when the parties and
the judges inhabit the same neighbourhood. Again, as
this magistrate is usually one of the judges of the supreme
tribunals of the kingdom, and has past his life in the
study and adminitsration of the laws of his country, he
possesses, it may be presumed, those professional qualifica∣tions,
which befit the dignity and importance of his
station. Lastly, as both he, and the advocates who ac∣company
him in his circuit, are employed in the business
of those superior courts, (to which also their proceedings
are amenable,) they will naturally conduct themselves by
the rules of adjudication, which they have applied, or
learnt there; and, by this means maintain, what consti∣tutes
<PB N="508" REF="548"/>
a principal perfection of civil government, one law
of the land in every part and district of the empire.</P>
<P>Next to the constitution of courts of justice, we may
confider the maxims which ought to guide their proceed∣ings:
and upon this subject, the chief enquiry will be,
how far, and for what reasons, it is expedient to adhere to
former determinations; or, whether it be necessary for judges,
to attend to any other consideration than the apparent and
particular equity of the case before them. Now although
to assert, that precedents established by one set of judges,
ought to be incontrovertible by their successors in the
same jurisdiction, or by those who exercise a higher,
would be to attribute to the sentence of those judges,
all the authority we ascribe to the most solemn acts of
the legislature: yet, the general security of private rights,
and of civil life, requires, that such precedents, especially
if they have been confirmed by repeated adjudications,
should not be overthrown without a detection of manifest
error, or some imputation of dishonesty upon the court by
whose judgment the question was first decided. And
this deference to prior decisions is founded upon two rea∣sons;
first, that the discretion of judges may be bound
down by positive rules; and, secondly, that the subject
upon every occasion, in which his legal interest is con∣cerned,
may know beforehand how to act, and what to
expect. To set judges free from any obligation, to con∣form
themselves to the decisions of their predecessors would
be to lay open a latitude of judging, with, which, no de∣scription
<PB N="509" REF="549"/>
of men can safely be entrusted: it would be to
allow space for the exercise of those concealed partialities,
which, since they cannot by any human policy be excluded,
ought to be confined by boundaries and land marks. It is
in vain to alledge, that the superintendency of parliament
is always at hand to control and punish abuses of judicial
discretion. By what rules can parliament proceed? Who
shall pronounce a decision to be wrong, where there exists
no acknowledged measure or standard of what is right,
which, in a multitude of instances, would be the case,
is prior determinations were no longer to be appealed to?</P>
<P>Diminishing the danger of partiality, is one thing gained
by adhering to precedents; but not the principal thing.
The subject of every system of laws must expect that de∣cision
in his own case, which he knows that others have
received in cases similar to his. If he expect not this, he
can expect nothing. There exists no other rule or principle
of reasoning, by which he can soretell, or even conjecture
the event of a judicial contest. To remove theresore the
ground of this expectation, by rejecting the force and
authority of precedents, is to entail upon the subject the
worst property of slavery—to have no assurance of his
rights, or knowledge of his duty. But the quiet of the coun∣try,
no less than the considence and satisfaction of each
man's mind, as well as the direction of each man's conduct,
requires the same thing. Nothing completely puts an end
to strife, but a rigid adherence to known rules of adjudi∣cation.
Nothing quells a spirit of litigation, like des∣pair
of success. Whilst the event is uncertain, which
<PB N="510" REF="550"/>
it must be, when it is uncertain whether former deter∣minations
upon the same subject will be followed or not,
law suits will be endless and innumerable: men will con∣tinually
engage in them, either from the hope of prevail∣ing
in their claims, which the smallest chance is sufficient
to encourage; or with the design of intimidating their ad∣versary
by the terrors of a dubious litigation. When justice
is rendered to the parties, but half the business of a court
of justice is done: the more important part of its office
remains—to put an end, for the future, to every fear, and
quarrel, and expence upon the fame point; and so to regu∣late
its proceedings, that not only a doubt once decided,
may be stirred no more, but that the whole train of
law-suits, which issue from one uncertainty, may die
with the parent question. Now this advantage can only
be attained by considering each decision as a direction to
succeeding judges, whenever a like dispute comes before
them. And it should be observed that every departure
from former determinations, especially if often repeated,
or long submitted to, shakes the stability of all legal title.
It is not fixing the point anew; it is leaving it unfixed.
For by the same stretch of power, by which the present
race of judges take upon them to contradict the judgment
of their predecessors, those who try the question next. may
set aside theirs.</P>
<P>From an adherence however to precedents, by which
so much is gained to the public, two consequences arise
which are often lamented; the hardship of particular
<PB N="511" REF="551"/>
cases, and the intricacy of the science. As to the first of
these complaints, whenever such cases occur, we must
apply to them this reflection, “that uniformity is of more
importance than equity, in proportion as general uncer∣tainty
would be a greater evil than particular injustice.”
The second is attended with no greater inconveniency
than the erecting the practice of the law into a separate
profession: and which becomes necessary on this account;
for if we attribute so much authority to precedents, it is
evident they ought to be known in every cause, both to
the advocates and the judge: this knowledge cannot be
general, since it is the fruit oftentimes of laborious re∣search,
or demands a memory stored with long-collected
erudition.</P>
<P>To a mind revolving upon the subject of human juris∣prudence,
there frequently occurs this, question; why,
since the maxims of natural justice are few and evident, do
there arise so many doubts and controversies in the appli∣cation?
Or, in other words, how comes it to pass, that,
although the principles of the law of nature be simple,
and for the most part sufficiently obvious, there should
exist nevertheless, in every system of municipal laws, and in
the actual administration of relative justice, numerous uncer∣tainties
and acknowledged difficulty? Whence, it may be
asked, so much room for litigation, and so many subsisting
disputes, if the rules of human duty be neither obscure
nor dubious? If a system of morality, containing both the
precepts of revelation, and: the deductions of reason? may
<PB N="512" REF="552"/>
be comprised within, the compass of one moderate volume;
and the moralist be able, as he pretends, to describe the
rights and obligations of mankind, in all the different re∣lations
they may hold to one another; what need of those
codes of positive and particular institutions, of those tomes
of statutes and reports, which require the employment of
a long life even to peruse? And this question is immedi∣ately
connected with the argument treated of in the pre∣ceding
paragraph; for unless there be found some greater
uncertainty in the law of nature, or what may be called
natural equity, when it comes to be applied to real cases
and actual adjudication, than what appears in the rules
and principles of the science, as delivered in the writings
of those who treat of the subject, it were better that the
determination of every cause were left to the conscience of
judges, unfettered by precedents and authorities; since the
very purpose, for which these are introduced, is to give a
certainty to judicial proceedings, which they would want
without them.</P>
<P>Now to account for the existence of so many sources
of litigation, notwithstanding the clearness and per∣fection
of natural justice, it should be observed, in the
first place, that treatises of morality always suppose
facts to be ascertained; and not only so, but the intention
likewise of the parties to be known and laid bare. For
example, when we pronounce that promises ought to be
fulfilled in that sense in which the promiser apprehended,
at the time of making the promise, the other party re∣ceived
and understood it, the apprehension of one side,
<PB N="513" REF="553"/>
and the expectation of the other, must be discovered, be∣fore
this rule can be reduced to practice, or applied to
the determination of any actual dispute. Wherefore the
discussion of facts, which the moralist supposes to be set∣tled;
the discovery of intentions, which he presumes to be
known, still remain to exercise the enquiry of courts of
justice. And as these facts and intentions are often to
be inferred or rather conjectured, from obscure indications,
suspicious testimony, and a comparison of opposite and
contending probabilities, they afford a never-failing sup∣ply
of doubt and litigation. For this reason, as hath been
observed in a former part of this work, the science of
morality is to be considered rather as a direction to the
parties, who are conscious of their own thoughts, and
motives, and designs, and to which consciousness the
teacher of morality constantly appeals; than as a guide to
the judge, or to any third person, whose arbitration must
proceed upon rules of evidence, and maxims of credibility,
with which the moralist has no concern.</P>
<P>Secondly, there exist a multitude of cases, in which the
law of nature, that is, the law of public expediency pre∣scribes
nothing, except that some certain rule be adhered
to, and that the rule actually established be preserved; it
being either indifferent what rule obtains, or out of many
rules, no one being so much more advantageous than the
rest, as to recompence the inconveniency of an alteration.
In all such cases the law of nature sends us to the law of
the land. She directs either that some fixed rule be in∣troduced
<PB N="514" REF="554"/>
by an act of the legislature, or that the rule
which accident, or custom, or common consent have al∣ready
established, be steadily maintained. Thus, in the
descent of lands or the inheritance of personals from
intestate proprietors, whether the kindred of the grand∣mother,
or of the great grandmother, shall be preferred
in the succession; whether the degrees of consanguinity
hsall be computed through the common ancestor, or from
him: whether the widow shall take a third or a moiety
of her husband's fortune; whether sons shall be preferred
to daughters, or the elder to the younger; whether the
distinction of age shall be regarded amongst sisters, as well
as between brothers; in these, and in a great variety of
questions which the same subject supplies, the law of na∣ture
determines nothing. The only answer she returns
to our enquiries is, that some certain and general rule be
laid down by public authority; be obeyed when laid
down; and that the quiet of the country be not dis∣turbed,
nor the expectation of heirs frustrated by Capri∣cious
innovations. This silence or neutrality of the law
of nature, which we have exemplified in the cafe of in∣testacy,
holds concerning a great part of the questions that
relate to the right or acquisition of property. Recourse
then must necessarily be had to statutes, or precedents, or
usage, to fix what the law of nature has left loose. The
interpretation of these statutes, the search after prece∣dents,
the investigation of customs, compose therefore an
unavoidable, and at the same time a large and intricate
portion of forensic business. Positive constitutions or judi∣cial
<PB N="515" REF="555"/>
authorities are, in like manner, wanted to give precision
to many things, which are in their own nature <HI>indeter∣minate.</HI>
The age of legal discretion; at what time of
life a person shall be deemed competent to the perform∣ance
of any act, which may bind his property; whether
at twenty, or twenty one, or earlier or later, or at some
point of time between these years, can only be ascertained
by a positive rule of the society to which the party be∣longs.
Nature has assigned no period for this; the hu∣man
understanding advancing to maturity by insensible
degrees, and its progress varying in different individuals.
Yet it is necessary, for the sake of mutual security, that a
precise age be fixed, and that what is fixed be known to
all. It is on these occasions that the intervention of law
supplies the inconstancy of nature. Again, there are
other things which are perfectly <HI>arbitrary,</HI> and capable of
no certainty but what is given them by positive regulation.
It is necessary that a limited time sHould be assigned to
defendants, to plead to the complaints alledged against
them; and also that the default of pleading within a cer∣tain,
time, should be taken for a confession of the charge:
but to how many days or months that term should be ex∣tended,
though necessary to be known with certainty,
cannot be known at all, by any information which the
law of nature affords. And the same remark seems appli∣cable
to almost all those rules of proceeding, which con∣stitute
what is called the practice of the courts as they
cannot be traced out by reasoning, they must be fettled
by authority.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="556"/>
Thirdly, in contracts whether express or implied,
which involve a great number of conditions, as in those
which are entered into between masters and servants,
principals and agents; many also of merchandize, or for
works of art; some likewise which relate to the negocia∣tion
of money or bills, or to the acceptance of credit or
security; the original design and expectation of the parties
was, that both sides should be guided by the course and cus∣tom
of the country in transactions of the same sort. Con∣sequently,
when these contracts come to be disputed, na∣tural
justice can only refer to that custom. But as such
customs are not always sufficiently uniform or notorious,
but often to be collected from the production and compa∣rison
of instances and accounts repugnant to one another;
and each custom being only that, after all, which amongst
a variety of usages seems to predominate, we have <HI>here</HI>
also ample room for doubt and contest.</P>
<P>Fourthly, as the law of nature founded in the very
construction of human society, which is to endure through
a series of perishing generations, requires that the just en∣gagements
a man enters into, should continue in force be∣yond
his own life; it follows that the private rights of
persons frequently depend upon what has been transacted,
in times remote from the present, by their ancestors or
predecessors, by those under whom they claim, or to
whose obligations they have succeeded. Thus the questions
which usually arise between lords of manors, and their
tenants, between the king and those who claim royal
<PB N="517" REF="557"/>
franchises, or between them and the persons affected by
these fnanchises, depend upon the terms of the original
grant. In like manner every dispute concerning tythes, in
which an exemption or composition is pleaded, depends
upon the agreement which took place between the predeces∣sor
of the claimant, and the ancient owner of the land.
The appeal to these grants and agreements is dictated
by natural equity, as well as by the municipal law: but
concerning the existence, or the conditions of such old
covenants, doubts will perpetually occur, to which the
law of nature affords no solution. The loss or decay of
records, the perishableness of living memory, the corup∣tion
and carelessness of tradition, all conspire to multiply
uncertainties upon this head; what cannot be produced
or proved, must be left to loose and fallible presumption.
Under the same head may be included another topic of al∣tercation;
the tracing out of boundaries, which time, or
neglect, or unity of possession, or mixture of occupation
have confounded or obliterated. To which should be
added a difficulty which often presents itself in disputes
concerning rights of <HI>way,</HI> both public and private, and of
those easements which one man claims in another mans
property; namely, that of distinguishing, after a lapse of
years, the use of an indulgence from the exercise of a
right.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The quantity or extent of an injury, even
when the cause and author of it are known, is often du∣bious
and undefined. If the injury consist in the loss of
<PB N="518" REF="558"/>
some specific property, the value of the property consti∣tutes
the amount of the injury: but what a man may
have sufrered in his person, from an assault; in his repu∣tation,
by slander; or in the comfort of his life, by the
sedudtion of a wife or daughter; or what sum of money
shall be deemed a reparation for the damage, cannot be
ascertained by any rules which the law of nature supplies.
The law of nature commands that reparation be made; and
adds to her command, that when the aggressor and the
sufterer disagree, the damage be assessed by authorized and
indifferent arbitrators. Here then recourse must be had
to courts of law, not only with the permission, but in
some measure, by the direction of natural justice.</P>
<P>Sixthly, When controversies arise in the interpretation
of written laws, they arise upon contingencies, which the
composer of the law did not foresee or think of. In the
adjudication of such cases, this dilemma presents itself:
if the laws be permitted to operate only upon the cafes,
which were actually contemplated by the law makers,
they will always be found defective: if they be extended
to every case, to which the reasoning and spirit and ex∣pediency
of the provision seem to belong, without any far∣ther
evidence of the intention of the legislature, we shall
allow to the judges a liberty of applying the law, which
will fall very little short of the power of making it. If a
literal construction be adhered to, the law will often fail
of its end: if a loose and vague exposition be admitted,
the law might as well have never been enacted; for this
<PB N="519" REF="559"/>
license will bring back into the subjedt all the uncertainty
which it was the design of the legislature to take away.
Courts of justice are, and always must be embarassed by
these opposite difficulties: and as it can never be known
beforehand, in what degree either consideration may pre∣vail
in the mind of the judge, there remains an unavoid∣able
cause of doubt, and a place for contention.</P>
<P>Seventhly, the deliberations of courts of justice upon
every <HI>new</HI> question are incumbered with additional diff∣iculties,
in consequence of the authority which the judg∣ment
of the court possesses, as a precedent to future judi∣catures:
which authority appertains not only to the
conclusions the court delivers, but to the principles
and arguments upon which they are built. The view
of this effect makes it necessary for a judge to look be∣yond
the case before him; and, beside the attention he
owes to the truth and justice of the cause between the
parties, to reflect whether the principles, and maxims, and
reasoning, which he adopts and authorizes, can be applied
with safety to all cases, which admit of a comparison
with the present. The decision of the cause, were the
effects of the decision to stop there, might be easy: but
the consequence of establishing the principle, which such
a decision assumes, may be difficult, though of the utmost
importance, to be foreseen and regulated.</P>
<P>Finally, after all the certainty and rest that can be given
to points of law, either by the interposition of the legisla∣ture,
<PB N="520" REF="560"/>
or the authority of precedents, one principal source
of disputation will remain still, and into which indeed the
greater part of legal controversies may be resolved, namely,
“a competition of opposite analogies.” When a point of
law has been once adjudged, neither that question, nor any
which completely, and in all its circumstances, corresponds
with <HI>that,</HI> can be brought a second time into dispute: but
questions arise, which resemble this only indirectly and
in part, in certain views and circumstances, and which
may seem to bear an equal or a greater affinity to other
adjudged cases; questions, which can be brought within
any fixed rule only by analogy, and which hold a relation
by analogy to different rules. It is by the urging of these
different analogies that the contention of the bar is carried
on: and it is in the comparison, adjustment, and reconci∣liation
of them with one another; in the discerning of
such distinctions, and in the framing of such a determina∣tion,
as may either save the various rules alledged in
the cause, or, if that be impossible, may give up the
weaker analogy to the stronger, that the sagacity and
wisdom of the court are seen and exercised. Amongst a
thousand instances of this, we may cite one of general no∣toriety
in the contest that has lately been agitated con∣cerning
literary property. Here the personal industry,
which an author expends upon the composition of his
work, bears so near a resemblance to that, by which
every other kind of property is earned, or deserved, or
acquired; or rather there exists such a correspondency be∣tween
what is created by the study of a man's mind, and
<PB N="521" REF="561"/>
the production of his labour, in any other way of apply∣ing
it, that he seems entitled to the same exclusive, as∣signable,
and perpetual right in both; and that right
to the same protection of law. This is the analogy
contended for on one side. On the other hand, a book,
as to the authors right in it, appears similar to an inven∣tion
of art, as a machine, an engine, a medicine. And,
since the law permits these to be copied, or imitated, ex∣cept
where an exclusive use or sale is reserved to the in∣ventor
by patent, the same liberty should be allowed in
the publication and sale of books. This is the analogy
maintained by the advocates of an open trade. And the
competition of these opposite analogies constituted the
difficulty of the case, as far as the same was argued, or
adjudged upon principles of common law—One example
may serve to illustrate our meaning; but whoever takes
up a volume of reports, will find most of the arguments
it contains capable of the same analysis; although the ana∣logies,
it must be confessed, are sometimes so entangled as
not to be easily unravelled, or even perceived.</P>
<P>Doubtful and obscure points of law are not however
nearly so numerous, as they are apprehended to be. Out
of the multitude of causes, which in the course of each
year, are brought to trial in the metropolis, or upon the
circuits, there are few in which any point is reserved for
the judgment of superior courts. Yet these few con∣tain
all the doubts, with which the law is chargeable: for
<PB N="522" REF="562"/>
as to the rest, the uncertainty, as hath been shown above,
is not in the law, but in the means of human information.</P>
<P>There are two peculiarities in the judicial constitution
of this country, which do not carry with them the same
evidence of their propriety, that recommends almost every
other part of the system. The first of these is the rule,
which requires that juries be <HI>unanimous</HI> in their verdicts.
To expect that twelve men, taken by lot out of a promis∣cuous
multitude, should agree in their opinion upon points
confessedly dubious; and upon which often the wisest
judgments might be held in suspense; or to suppose
that any real <HI>unanimity,</HI> or change of opinion in the dis∣senting
jurors, could be procured by confining them until
they all consented to the same verdict; bespeaks more of
the conceit of a barbarous age, than of the policy which
could dictate such an institution as that of juries. Ne∣vertheless,
the effects of this rule are not so detrimental,
as the rule itself is unreasonable: in criminal prosecutions
it operates considerably in favour of the prisoner; for if a
juror find it necessary to surrender to the obstinacy of
others, he will much more readily resign his opinion on
the side of mercy, than of condemnation: in civil suits it
adds weight to the direction of the judge; for when a
conference with one another does not seem likely to pro∣duce,
in the jury, the agreement that is necessary, they
will naturally close their disputes by a common submission
to the opinion delivered from the bench. However, there
seems to be less of the concurrence of separate judgments
<PB N="523" REF="563"/>
in the same conclusion; consequently, less assurance that
the conclusion is founded in reasons of apparent truth and
justice, than if the decision were left to a plurality, or
some certain majority of voices.</P>
<P>The second cirumstance in our constitution, which,
however it may succeed in practice, does not seem to
have been suggested by any intelligible fitness in the nature
of the thing, is the choice that is made of the <HI>House of
Lords,</HI> as a court of appeal from every civil court of judi∣cature
in the kingdom; and of the last also and highest
appeal, to which the subject can resort. There appears to be
nothing in the constitution of that assembly; in the edu∣cation,
habits, character, or professions of the members
who compose it; in the mode of their appointment, or
the right by which they succeed to their places in it,
that should qualify them for this arduous office: except,
perhaps, that the elevation of their rank and fortune af∣fords
a security against the offer and influence of small
bribes. Officers of the army and navy, courtiers, eccle∣siasties;
young men who have just attained the age of
twenty-one, and who have passed their youth in the
dissipation and pursuits which commonly accompany
the possession or inheritance of great fortunes; coun∣try
gentlemen occupied in the management of their
estates, or the care of their domestic concerns and family
interests; the greater part of the assembly born to their
station, that is, placed in it by chance; most of the rest
advanced to the peerage, for services, and from motives
<PB N="524" REF="564"/>
utterly unconnected with legal erudition—these men
compose the tribunal, to which the constitution entrusts
the interpretation of her laws, and the ultimate decision
of every dispute between her subjects. These are the men
assigned to review judgments of law, pronounced by sages
of the profession, who have spent their lives in the study
and practice of the jurisprudence of their country. Such is
the order which our ancestors have established. The effect
only proves the truth of this maxim, “that when a single in∣stitution
is extremely dissonant from other parts of the system
to which it belongs, it will always find some way of re∣conciling
itself to the analogy which governs and pervades
the rest.” By constantly placing in the House of Lords
some of the most eminent and experienced lawyers
in the kingdom; by calling to their aid the advice
of the judges, when any abstract question of law
awaits their determination; by the almost implicit and un∣disputed
deference, which the uninformed part of the
house find it necessary to pay to the learning of their col∣leagues,
the appeal to the House of Lords becomes an
appeal to the collected wisdom of our supreme courts of
justice: receiving indeed solemnity, but little perhaps of
direction or assistance, from the presence of the august as∣sembly,
in which it is heard and determined.</P>
<P>These however, if real, are in their consequences mi∣nute
imperfections. A politician, who should sit down to
delineate a plan for the dispensation of public justice,
guarded against all access to influence and corruption, and
<PB N="525" REF="565"/>
bringing together the separate advantages of knowledge
and impartiality, would find, when he had done, that he
had been transcribing the judicial constitution of England.
And it may teach the most discontented amongst us to
acquiesce in the government of his country, to reflect,
that the pure, and wise, and equal administration of the
laws, forms the first end and blessing of social union; and
that this blessing is enjoyed by him in a perfection, which
he will seek in vain, in any other nation of the world.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<PB REF="566"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Crimes and Punishments.</HEAD>
<P>THE proper end of human punishment is, not the
satisfaction of justice, but the prevention of crimes.
By the satisfaction of justice, I mean the retribution of so
much pain for so much guilt; which is the dispensation
we expect at the hand of God, and which we are accus∣tomed
to consider as the order of things that perfect justice
dictates and requires. In what sense, or whether with
truth in any sense, justice may be said to demand the
punishment of offenders, I do not now enquire; but I assert
that this <HI>demand</HI> is not the motive or occasion of human
punishment. What would it be to the magistrate that
offences went altogether unpunished, if the impunity of
the offenders were followed by no danger or prejudice to
the commonwealth? The fear left the escape of the
criminal should encourage him, or others by his example,
<PB N="527" REF="567"/>
to repeat the same crime, or to commit different crimes,
is the sole consideration which authorizes the infliction of
punishment by human laws. Now that, whatever it be,
which is the cause and end of the punishment, ought un∣doubtedly
to regulate the measure of its severity. But
this cause appears to be founded, not in the guilt of the
offender, but in the necessity of preventing the repetition
of the offence. And from hence results the reason, that
crimes are not by any government, nor, in all cases, ought
to be punished, in proportion to their guilt, but in propor∣tion
to the difficulty and the necessity of preventing
them. Thus the stealing of goods privately out of a shop,
may not, in its moral quality, be more, criminal, than the
stealing of them out of a house; yet, being equally neces∣sary,
and more difficult to be prevented, the law, in certain
circumstances, denounces against it a severer punishment:
that is, the crime must be prevented by some means or
other; and consequently, whatever means appear necessary
to this end, whether they be proportionable to the guilt
of the criminal or not, are adopted rightly, because they
are adopted upon the principle which alone justifies the
infliction of punishment at all. From the same considera∣tion
it also follows, that punishment ought not to be em∣ployed,
much less rendered severe, when the crime can
be prevented by any other means. Punishment is an evil
to which the magistrate resorts only from its being neces∣sary
to the prevention of a greater. This necessity does
not exist, when the end may be attained, that is, when
the public may be defended from the effects of the crime,
<PB N="528" REF="568"/>
by any other expedient. The sanguinary laws which
have been made against counterfeiting or diminishing the
gold coin of the kingdom might be just, until the method
of detecting the fraud, by weighing the money, was intro∣duced
into general usage. Since that precaution was prac∣tised,
these laws have slept: and an execution under
them would be deemed, at this day, a measure of un∣justifiable
severity. The same principle accounts for a
circumstance, which has been often censured as an ab∣surdity
in the penal laws of this, and of most modern na∣tions,
namely, that breaches of trust are either not pun∣ished
at all, or punished with less rigour than other
frauds—wherefore is it, some have asked, that a violation
of confidence, which increases the guilt, should mitigate
the penalty. This lenity, or rather forbearance of the
laws is founded in the most reasonable distinction. A due
and practicable circumspection in the choice of the per∣sons,
whom they trust; caution in limiting the extent of
that trust; or the requiring of sufficient security for the
faithful discharge of it, will commonly guard men from
injuries of this description: and the law will not interpose
its sanctions, to protect negligence and credulity, or to sup∣ply
the place of private care and prudence. To be con∣vinced
that the law proceeds entirely upon this considera∣tion,
we have only to observe, that, where the confidence
is unavoidable, where no practicable vigilance could watch
the offender, as in the case of theft committed by a servant
in the shop or dwelling-house of his master, or upon pro∣perty
to which he must necessarily have access, the sen∣tence
<PB N="529" REF="569"/>
of the law is not less severe, and its execution com∣monly
more certain and rigorous, than if no trust at all
had intervened.</P>
<P>It is in pursuance of the same principle, which pervades
indeed the whole system of penal jurisprudence, that the faci∣lity
with which any species of crimes is perpetrated, has been
generally deemed a reason for aggravating the punishment.
Thus, sheep-stealing, horse stealing; the stealing of cloth
from tenters, or bleaching grounds, by our laws, subject
the offenders to sentence of death: not that these crimes
are in their nature more heinous, than many simple felo∣nies
which are punished by imprisonment or transporta∣tion,
but because the property being more exposed, re∣quires
the terror of capital punishment to protect it. This
severity would be absurd and unjust, if the guilt of the
offender were the immediate cause and measure of the
punishment; but is a consistent and regular consequence
of the supposition, that the right of punishment results
from the necessity of preventing the crime: for if this be
the end proposed, the severity of the punishment must be
increased in proportion to the expediency and the difficul∣ty
of attaining this end; that is, in a proportion compounded
of the mischief of the crime, and the ease with which it
is executed. The difficulty of discovery is a circumstance
to be included in the same consideration. It constitutes
indeed, with respect to the crime, the facility we speak of.
By how much therefore the detection of the offender is
more rare and uncertain, by so much the more severe
<PB N="530" REF="570"/>
must be the punishment, when he is detected. Thus the
writing of incendiary letters, though in itself a pernicious
and alarming injury, calls for a more condign and exem∣plary
punishment, by the very obscurity with which the
crime is committed.</P>
<P>From the justice of God we are taught to look for a
gradation of punishment, exactly proportioned to the guilt
of the offender: when therefore, in assigning the degrees
of human punishment, we introduce considerations di∣stinct
from that guilt, and a proportion so varied by ex∣ternal
circumstances, that equal crimes frequently under∣go
unequal punishments, or the less crime the greater; it
is natural to demand the reason why a different measure
of punishment should be expected from God, and observed
by man; why that rule, which befits the absolute and
perfect justice of the Deity, should not be the rule which
ought to be pursued and imitated by human laws. The
solution of this difficulty must be sought for in those pe∣culiar
attributes of the divine nature, which distinguish
the dispensations of supreme wisdom from the proceed∣ings
of human judicature. A Being whose knowledge
penetrates every concealment; from the operation of whose
will no art or flight can escape; and in whose hands
punishment is sure; such a Being may conduct the moral
government of his creation, in the best and wisest manner,
by pronouncing a law that every crime should finally re∣ceive
a punishment proportioned to the guilt which it
contains, abstracted from any foreign consideration what∣ever;
<PB N="531" REF="571"/>
and may testify his veracity to the spectators of his
judgments, by carrying this law into strict execution.
But when the care of the public safety is entrusted to men,
whose authority over their fellow creatures is limited by
defects of power and knowledge; from whose utmost vigi∣lence
and sagacity the greatest offenders often lie hid;
whose wisest provisions and speediest pursuit may be
eluded by artifice or concealment; a different necessity, a
new rule of proceeding results from the very imperfection
of their faculties. In their hands the uncertainty of pun∣ishment
must be compensated: by the severity. The ease
with which crimes are committed or concealed, must be
counteracted by additional penalties and increased terrors.
The very end, for which human government is established,
requires that its regulations be adapted to the suppression
of crimes. This end, whatever it may do in the plans
of infinite wisdom, does not in the designation of tem∣poral
penalties, always coincide with the proportionate
punishment of guilt.</P>
<P>There are two methods of administring penal justice.</P>
<P>The first method assigns capital punishments to few of∣fences,
and invariably inflicts it.</P>
<P>The second method assigns capital punishments to many
kinds of offences, but inflicts it only upon a few examples
of each kind.</P>
<P><PB N="532" REF="572"/>
The latter of which two methods has been long adopt∣ed
in this country, where, of those who receive sentence
of death, scarce one in ten is executed. And the prefer∣ence
of this to the former method seems to be founded
in the consideration, that the selection of proper objects
for capital punishment principally depends upon circum∣stances,
which, however easy to perceive in each particular
case, after the crime is committed, it is impossible to enu∣merate
or define beforehand, or to ascertain however with
that exactness, which is requisite in legal descriptions.
Hence, although it be necessary to fix the boundary on
one side, that is, the limit to which the punishment may
be extended, by precise rules of law; and also that no∣thing
less than the authority of the whole legislature be
suffered to determine and assign these rules; yet, the miti∣gation
of punishment, the exercise of lenity, may, with∣out
danger, be entrusted to the executive magistrate, whose
discretion will operate upon those numerous, unforeseen,
mutable, and indefinite circumstances, both of the crime and
the criminal, which constitute or qualify the malignity
of each offence. Without the power of relaxation lodged
in a living authority, either some offenders would escape
capital punishment, whom the public safety required
to suffer; or others would undergo this punishment,
where it was neither deserved nor necessary. For if judg∣ment
of death were reserved for one or two species of
crimes only, which would probably be the case if that
judgment was meant to be executed without exception,
crimes might occur of the most dangerous example, and
<PB N="533" REF="573"/>
attended with circumstances of heinous aggravation, which
did not fall within <HI>any</HI> description of capital offences,
and consequently could not receive the punishment their
own malignity and the public safety required—and what
is worse, it would be known beforehand, that such crimes
might be committed, without danger to the offender's life.
On the other hand, if, to reach these possible cases, the
whole class of offences to which they belong be subjected
to pains of death, and no power of remitting this se∣verity
remain any where, the execution of the laws will
become more sanguinary, than the public compassion
would endure, or than is necessary to the general security.</P>
<P>The law of England is constructed upon a different and
a better policy. By the number of statutes creating capital
offences, it sweeps into the net every crime, which under
any possible circumstances may merit the punishment of
death: but when the execution of this sentence comes to
be deliberated upon, a small proportion of each class are
singled out, the general character, or the peculiar aggra∣vations
of whose crimes, render them fit examples of
public justice. By this expedient few actually suffer
death, whilst the dread and danger of it hang over the
crimes of many. The tenderness of the law cannot be
taken advantage of. The life of the subject is spared, as
far as the necessity of restraint and intimidation permits,
yet no one will adventure upon the commission of any
enormous crime, from a knowledge that the laws have
not provided for its punishment. The wisdom and hu∣manity
of this design furnish a just excuse for the mul∣tiplicity
<PB N="534" REF="574"/>
of capital offences, which the laws of England
are accused of containing beyond those of other countries.
The charge of cruelty is answered by observing, that these
laws were never meant to be carried into indiscriminate
execution; that the legislature, when it establishes its last
and highest sanctions, trusts to the benignity of the crown
to relax their severity, as often as circumstances appear to
palliate the offence, or even as often as those circumstances
of aggravation are wanting, which rendered this rigorous
interposition necessary. Upon this plan, it is enough to
vindicate the lenity of the laws, that some instances are to
be found in each class of capital crimes, which require the
restraint of capital punishment; and that this restraint
could not be applied, without subjecting the whole class
to the same condemnation.</P>
<P>There is however one species of crimes, the making
of which capital can hardly, I think, be defended, even
upon the comprehensive principle just now stated; I mean,
that of privately stealing from the person. As every de∣gree
of force is excluded by the description of the crime,
it will be difficult to assign an example, where either the
amount or circumstances of the theft place it upon a level
with those dangerous attempts, to which the punishment
of death should be confined. It will be still more difficult
to show, that, without gross and culpable negligence on
the part of the sufferer, such examples are probable, or were
ever so frequent, as to make it necessary to constitute a
class of capital offences, of very wide and large extent.</P>
<P><PB N="535" REF="575"/>
The prerogative of pardon is properly reserved to the
chief magistrate. The power of suspending the laws is a
privilege of too high a nature to be committed to many
hands, or to those of any inferior officer in the state.
The King also can best collect the advice by which his reso∣lutions
should be governed; and is removed at the greatest
distance from the influence of private motives. But let
this power be deposited where it will, the exercise of it
ought to be regarded, not as the gift of a favour, to be
yielded to solicitation, granted to friendship, or, least of all,
to be made subservient to the conciliating or gratifying of
political attachments, but as a judicial act; as a delibera∣tion
to be conducted with the same character of impartiali∣ty,
the same exact and diligent attention to the proper
merits and reasons and circumstances of the case, that the
judge upon the bench was expected to maintain and show
in the trial of the prisoner's guilt. The questions whether
the prisoner be guilty, and whether, being guilty, he ought
to be executed, are equally questions of public justice.
The trial of the one is as much a function of magistracy
as of the other. The public welfare is interested in both.
The conviction of an offender should depend upon nothing
but the proof of his guilt, nor the execution of the sen∣tence
upon any thing beside the quality and circumstances
of his crime. It is necessary to the good order of society,
and to the reputation and authority of government, that
this be known and believed to be the case in each part
of the proceeding. These reflections will show, that
the admission of extrinsic or oblique considerations, in dis∣pensing
<PB N="536" REF="576"/>
the power of pardon, is a crime, in the authors
and advisers of such unmerited partiality, of the same
nature with that of corruption in a judge.</P>
<P>The aggravations which ought to guide the selection of objects
for condign punishment are principally these three—repe∣tition,
cruelty, combination. The two first, it is manifest,
add to every reason upon which the justice or the necessity
of rigorous measures can be founded; and, with respect
to the last circumstance, it may be observed, that when
thieves and robbers are once collected into gangs, their vi∣olence
becomes more formidable, the confederates more
desperate, and the difficulty of defending the public
against their depredations much greater, than in the case
of solitary adventurers. Which several considerations
compose a distinction, that is properly adverted to, in de∣ciding
upon the fate of convicted malefactors.</P>
<P>In crimes however, which are perpetrated by a multi∣tude
or a gang, it is proper to separate, in the punishment,
the ring-leader from his followers, the principal from his
accomplices, and even the person who struck the blow,
broke the lock, or first entered the house, from those who
joined him in the felony; not so much on account of any
distinction in the guilt of the offenders, as for the sake of
casting an obstacle in the way of such confederacies, by ren∣dering
it difficult for the confederates to settle who shall be∣gin
the attack, or to find a man amongst their number wil∣ling
to expose himself to greater danger than his associates.
<PB N="537" REF="577"/>
This is another instance in which the punishment, which
expediency directs, does not pursue the exact propor∣tion
of the crime.</P>
<P>Injuries effected by terror and violence, are those
which it is the first and chief concern of legal government
to repress: because, their extent is unlimited; because,
no private precaution can protect the subject against them;
because, they endanger life and safety, as well as property;
and lastly, because, they render the condition of society
wretched, by a sense of personal insecurity. These rea∣sons
do not apply to frauds, which circumspection may
prevent; which must wait for opportunity; which can
proceed only to certain limits; and, by the apprehen∣sion
of which, although the business of life be incom∣moded,
life itself is not made miserable. The appearance
of this distinction has led some humane writers to express
a wish, that capital punishments were confined to crimes
of violence. In estimating also the comparative malig∣nancy
of which, regard is to be had, not only to the pro∣per
or intended mischief of the crime, but to the alarm
occasioned by the attack, to the probability of still worse
consequences, and to the general consternation excited by
it in others. Thus in affixing the punishment of burglary,
or of breaking into dwelling-houses by night, we are to con∣sider
not only the peril to which the most valuable property
is exposed by this crime, and which may be called the direct
and meditated mischief of it, but the danger of murder, in
case of resistance, or for the sake of preventing discovery,
<PB N="538" REF="578"/>
and the universal dread with which the silent and de∣fenceless
hours of rest and sleep must be disturbed, where
attempts of this sort become frequent; and which dread
alone, and without the mischief which is the object of
it, is not only a public evil, but almost of all evils the
most insupportable. These circumstances place a differ∣ence
between the breaking into a dwelling-house by day,
or by night; which difference obtains in the punish∣ment
of the offence by the law of Moses, and is proba∣bly
to be found in the judicial codes of most countries,
from the earliest ages to the present.</P>
<P>Of frauds, or of injuries which are effected with∣out
force, the most noxious kinds are forgeries, coun∣terfeiting
or diminishing of the coin, and the stealing
of letters in the course of their conveyance; inas∣much
as these practices tend to deprive the public
of accommodations, which not only improve the con∣veniencies
of social life, but are essential to the prosperi∣ty,
or even the existence of commerce. Of these crimes
it may be said, that, although they seem to affect property
alone, the mischief of their operation does not terminate
there. For let it be supposed, that the remissness or
lenity of the laws should, in any country, suffer offences
of this sort to grow into such a frequency, as to render
the use of money; the circulation of bills, or the public con∣veyance
of letters no longer safe or practicable; what would
follow, but that every species of trade and of activity must
decline under these discouragements; the sources of subsist∣ence
fail, by which the inhabitants of the country are support∣ed;
<PB N="539" REF="579"/>
the country itself, where the intercourse of civil life was
so endangered and defective, be deserted; and that, beside
the distress and poverty, which the loss of employment
would produce to the industrious and valuable part of the
community, a rapid depopulation must take place, each
generation becoming less numerous than the last, till so∣litude
and barrenness overspread the land; until a desola∣tion
similar to what obtains in many countries of Asia,
which were once the most civilized and frequented parts
of the world, succeed in the place of crouded cities,
cultivated fields, of happy and well peopled regions.
When we carry forwards therefore our views to the more
distant, but not less certain consequences of these crimes,
we perceive that, though no living creature be destroyed by
them, yet human life is diminished; that an offence, the
particular consequence of which deprives only an indivi∣dual
of a small portion of his property, and which even in
its general tendency seems only to obstruct: the enjoy∣ment
of certain public conveniences, may nevertheless, by
its ultimate effects, conclude in the laying waste of human
existence. This observation will enable those, who regard
the divine rule of “life for life and blood for blood” as
the only authorized and justifiable measure of capital pun∣ishment,
to perceive a greater resemblance than they sup∣posed,
with respect to the effects and quality of the actions,
between certain atrocious frauds, and these crimes which
attack personal safety.</P>
<P>In the case of forgeries there appears a substantial dif∣ference,
between the forging of bills of exchange, or of se∣curities
which are circulated, and the circulation and cur∣rency
<PB N="540" REF="580"/>
of which are found to serve and facilitate valuable
purposes of commerce, and the forging of bonds, leases,
mortgages, or of instruments which are not commonly
transferred from one hand to another; because, in the
former case credit is necessarily given to the signature, and,
without that credit, the negociation of such property could
not be carried on, nor the public utility sought from it be
attained; in the other case, all possibility of deceit might
be precluded, by a direct communication between the par∣ties,
or by due care in the choice of their agents, with
little interruption to business, and without destroying, or
much incumbering, the uses for which these instruments
are calculated. This distinction, I apprehend, to be not
only real, but precise enough to afford a line of division
between forgeries, which, as the law now stands, are al∣most
universally capital, and punished with undistinguish∣ing
severity.</P>
<P>Perjury is another crime of the same class and magni∣tude.
And, when we consider what reliance is necessarily
placed upon oaths; that all judicial decisions proceed upon
testimony; that consequently, there is not a right, which
a man possesses, that false witriesses may not deprive him
of; that reputation, property, and life itself lie open to
the attempts of perjury; that it may often be committed
without a possibility of contradiction or discovery; that
the success and prevalency of this vice tend to introduce
the most grievous and fatal injustice into the administra∣tion
of human affairs, or such a distrust of testimony as
must create universal confusion and embarrassment; when
<PB N="541" REF="581"/>
we reflect upon these mischiefs, we shall be brought, pro∣bably,
to agree with the opinion of those, who contend
that perjury, in its punishment, especially that which is
attempted in solemn evidence, and in the face of a court
of justice, should be placed on a level with the most flagi∣tious
frauds.</P>
<P>The obtaining of money by secret threats, whether we
regard the difficulty with which the crime is traced out,
the odious imputations to which it may lead, or the pro∣fligate
conspiracies that are sometimes formed to carry it
into execution, deserves to be reckoned amongst the worst
species of robbery.</P>
<P>The frequency of capital executions in this country,
owes its necessity to three causes—much liberty, great
cities, and the want of a punishment, short of death, pos∣sessing
a sufficient degree of terror. And if the taking a∣way
of the life of malefactors be more rare in other coun∣tries
than in ours, the reason will be sound in some differ∣ence
in these articles. The liberties of a free people, and
still more the jealousy with which these liberties are
watched, and by which they are maintained, permit not
those precautions and restraints, that inspection, scrutiny,
and control, which are exercised with success in arbitrary
governments. For example, the spirit of the laws, and of
the people, will not suffer the detention or consinement
of suspected persons, without proofs of their guilt which
it is often impossible to obtain; nor that masters of fami∣lies
be obliged to record and render up a description
<PB N="542" REF="582"/>
of the strangers or inmates they entertain; nor that an
account be demanded, at the pleasure of the magistrate,
of each man's time, employment, and means of subsist∣ence;
nor securities to be required when these accounts
appear unsatisfactory or dubious; nor men to be appre∣hended
upon the mere suggestion of idleness or vagrancy;
nor to be confined to certain districts; nor the inhabitants
of each district to be made responsible for one another's behavi∣our;
nor passports to be exacted from all persons entering
or leaving the kingdom: least of all will they tolerate the
appearance of an armed force, or of military law; or suffer
the streets and public roads to be guarded and patrol∣led
by soldiers; or, lastly, entrust the police with such
discretionary powers, as may make sure of the guilty,
however they involve the innocent. These expedients,
although arbitrary and rigorous, are many of them effec∣tual;
and in proportion as they render the commission or
concealment of crimes more difficult, they substract from
the necessity of severe punishment. Great cities multiply
crimes by presenting easier opportunities and more incen∣tives
to libertinism, which in low life is commonly the in∣troductory
stage to other enormities; by collecting thieves
and robbers into the same neighbourhood, which enables
them to form communications and confederacies, that
increase their art and courage, as well as strength and
wickedness; but principally by the refuge they afford to
villany, in the means of concealment, and of subsisting
in secrecy, which crouded towns supply to men of every
description. These temptations and facilities can only be
<PB N="543" REF="583"/>
counteracted by adding to the number of capital punish∣ments.
But a third cause, which increases the frequency
of capital executions in England, is a defect of the laws in
not being provided with any other punishment than that
of death, sufficiently terrible to keep offenders in awe.
Transportation, which is the sentence second in the order
of severity, appears to me to answer the purpose of example
very imperfectly; not only because exile is in reality a
slight punishment to those, who have neither property,
nor friends, nor reputation, nor regular means of subsist∣ence
at home; and because their situation becomes little
worse by their crime, than it was before they committed
it; but because the punishment, whatever it be, is unob∣served
and unknown. A transported convict may suffer
under his sentence, but his sufferings are removed from
the view of his countrymen; his misery is unseen; his con∣dition
strikes no terror into the minds of those, for whose
warning and admonition it was intended. This chasm
in the scale of punishment produces also two farther im∣perfections
in the administration of penal justice: the first
is, that the same punishment is extended to crimes of very
different character and malignancy; the second, that pun∣ishments
separated by a great interval, are assigned to
crimes hardly distinguishable in their guilt and mischief.</P>
<P>The end of punishment is two-fold, <HI>amendment</HI> and <HI>ex∣ample.</HI>
In the first of these, the <HI>reformation</HI> of criminals,
little has ever been effected, and little I fear is practicable.
From every species of punishment that has hitherto been
<PB N="544" REF="584"/>
from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and exile, from pain and infamy, male∣factors
return more hardened in their crimes, and more
instructed. If there be any thing that shakes the soul of a
confirmed villain, it is the expectation of approaching
death. The horrors of this situation may cause such a
wrench in the mental organs, as to give them a holding
turn: and I think it probable, that many of those who
are executed, would, if they were delivered at the point
of death, retain such a remembrance of their sensations,
as might preserve them, unless urged by extreme want,
from relapsing into their former crimes. But this is an
experiment that from its nature cannot be repeated often.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>reforming</HI> punishments which have not yet been
tried, none promises so much success as that of <HI>solitary</HI>
imprisonment, or the confinement of criminals in separate
apartments. This improvement would augment the ter∣ror
of the punishment; seclude the criminal from the so∣ciety
of his fellow prisoners, in which society the worse
are sure to corrupt the better; would wean him from the
knowledge of his companions, and the love of that turbu∣lent,
precarious life, in which his vices had engaged him;
would raise up in him reflections on the folly of his choice,
and dispose his mind to such better and continued peni∣tence,
as might produce a lasting alteration in the princi∣ples
of his conduct.</P>
<P>As aversion to labour is the cause, from which half of
the vices of low life deduce their origin and continuance,
<PB N="545" REF="585"/>
punishments ought to be contrived with a view to the
conquering of this disposition. Two opposite expedients
have been recommended for this purpose; the one solitary
confinement, with hard labour; the other solitary con∣finement,
with nothing to do. Both expedients seek the
same end—to reconcile the idle to a life of industry.
The former hopes to effect this, by making labour habi∣tual;
the latter, by making idleness irksome and insup∣portable:
and the preference of one method to the other,
depends upon the question, whether a man is more likely
to betake himself, of his own accord, to work, who has
been accustomed to employment, or, who has been dis∣tressed
by the want of it. When jails are once provided
for the <HI>separate</HI> confinement of prisoners, which both propo∣sals
require, the choice between them may be soon deter∣mined
by experience. If labour be exacted, I would leave
the whole or a portion of the profit to the prisoner's use,
and I would debar him from any other provision or supply;
that his subsistence, however coarse or penurious, may be
proportioned to his diligence, and that he may taste the advan∣tage
of industry, together with the fatigue. I would go far∣ther;
I would measure the confinement, not by duration of
time, but by quantity of work, in order both to excite
industry, and to render it more voluntary. But the prin∣cipal
difficulty remains still; namely, how to dispose of
criminals after their enlargement. By a rule of life, which
is perhaps too invariably and indiscriminately adhered to,
no one will receive a man or woman out of a jail, into
any service or employment whatever. This is the com∣mon
<PB N="546" REF="586"/>
misfortune of public punishments, that they preclude
the offender from all honest means of future, support.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Until this inconveniency be remedied, small offences had, perhaps, better go unpunished; I do not mean that the laws should exempt them from punishment, but that private persons should be tender in prosecuting them.</NOTE> It
seems therefore incumbent upon the state to secure a
maintenance to those who are willing to work for it; and
yet it is absolutely necessary to divide criminals as far
asunder from one another as possible. Whether male pri∣soners
might not, after the term of their confinement was
expired, be distributed in the country, detained within
certain limits, and employed upon the public roads; and
females be remitted to the overseers of country parishes,
to be there furnished with dwellings, and with the mate∣rials
and implements of occupation; whether by these,
or by what other methods, it may be possible to effect the
two purposes of <HI>employment</HI> and <HI>dispersion,</HI> well merits the
attention of all, who are anxious to perfect the internal
regulation of their country.</P>
<P><HI>Torture</HI> is applied, either to obtain confessions of guilt,
or to exasperate or prolong the pains of death. No
bodily punishment, however excruciating or long conti∣nued,
receives the name of torture, unless it be designed
to kill the criminal by a more lingering death, or to ex∣tort
from him the discovery of some secret, which is
supposed to lie concealed in his breast;. <HI>The question by
<PB N="547" REF="587"/>
torture</HI> appears to be equivocal in its effects; for, as extre∣mity
of pain, and not any consciousness of remorse
in the mind, produces those effects, an innocent man
may sink under the torment, as soon as the guilty.
The latter has as much reason for his resolution, and as
much to fear from yielding, as the former. The instant
and almost irresistable desire of relief may draw from one
sufferer false accusations of himself or others, as it may
sometimes extract the truth out of another. This ambi∣guity
renders the use of torture, as a means of procuring
information in criminal proceedings, liable to the risk of
grievous and irreparable injustice. For which reason,
though recommended by ancient and general example, it
has been properly exploded from the mild and cautious
system of penal jurisprudence, established in this country.</P>
<P>Barbarous spectacles of human agony are justly found
fault with, as tending to harden and deprave the pub∣lic
feelings, and to destroy that sympathy with which
the sufferings of our fellow creatures are beheld; or, if
no effect of this kind follow from them; they counteract
in some measure their own design, by sinking men's ab∣horrence
of the crime in their commiseration of the cri∣minal.
But if a mode of execution could be devised,
which would augment the horror of the punishment, with∣out
offending or impairing the public sensibility by cruel
or unseemly exhibitions of death, it might add something
to the efficacy of the example; and by being reserved for a
few atrocious crimes, might also enlarge the scale of pun∣ishment;
an addition to which seems wanting; for, as the
<PB N="548" REF="588"/>
matter remains at present, you hang a malefactor for a
simple robbery, and can do no more to the villain who
has poisoned his father. Somewhat of the sort we have
been describing was the proposal, not long since suggested,
of casting murderers into a den of wild beasts, where they
would perish in a manner dreadful to the imagination,
yet concealed from, the view.</P>
<P><HI>Infamous</HI> punishments are mismanaged in this country,
with respect both to the crimes and the criminals. In the
first place, they ought to be confined to offences, which
are held in undisputed and universal detestation. To
condemn to the pillory the author or editor of a libel
against the state, who has rendered himself the favourite
of a party, if not of the people, by the very act for which
he stands there, is to gratify the offender, and to expose
the laws to mockery and insult. In the second place, the
delinquents who receive this sentence, are for the most
part such, as have long ceased, either to value reputation,
or to fear shame; of whose happiness and of whose en∣joyments
character makes no part. Thus the low minis∣ters
of libertinism, the keepers of bawdy or disorderly
houses, are threatened in vain with a punishment, that
affects a sense which they have not; that applies solely to
the imagination, to the virtue and the pride of human
nature. The pillory, or any other infamous distinc∣tion
might be employed rightly, and with effect, in
the punishment of some offences of higher life; as of
frauds and peculation in office; of collusions and conni∣vances,
<PB N="549" REF="589"/>
by which the public treasury is defrauded; of
breaches of trust; of perjury, and subornation of perjury;
of the <HI>clandestine</HI> and forbidden sale of places; of flagrant
abuses of authority, or neglect of duty; and lastly, of cor∣ruption
in the exercise of confidential, or judicial offices. In
all which the more elevated was the station of the crimi∣nal,
the more signal and conspicuous would be the triumph
of justice, and the more efficacious the example.</P>
<P>The <HI>certainty</HI> of punishment is of more consequence
than the severity. Criminals do not so much flatter
themselves with the lenity of the sentence, as with the
hope of escaping. They are not so apt to compare what
they gain by the crime, with what they may suffer
from the punishment, as to encourage themselves with the
chance of concealment or flight. For which reason, a
vigilant magistracy, an accurate police, a proper distribu∣tion
of force and intelligence, together with due rewards
for the discovery and apprehension of malefactors, and
an undeviating impartiality in carrying the laws into exe∣cution,
contribute more to the restraint and suppression of
crimes, than any violent exacerbations of punishment.
And for the same reason, of all contrivances directed
to this end, those, perhaps, are most effectual, which
facilitate the conviction of criminals. The offence
of counterfeiting the coin, could not be checked
by all the terrors and the utmost severity of law,
whilst the act of coining was necessary to be establish∣ed
<PB N="550" REF="590"/>
by specific proof. The statute which made the possession
of the implements of coining capital, that is, which consti∣tuted
that possession complete evidence of the offender's
guilt, was the first thing that gave force and efficacy
to the denunciations of law upon this subject. The
statute of James the First, relative to the murder
of bastard children, which ordains that the concealment
of the birth should be deemed incontestible proof of the
charge, though a harsh law, was, in like manner with the
former, well calculated to put a stop to the crime.</P>
<P>It is upon the principle of this observation, that
I apprehend much harm to have been done to the
community, by the over-strained scrupulousness, or
weak timidity of juries, which demands often such
proof of a prisoner's guilt, as the nature and secrecy
of his crime scarce possibly admit of; and which holds it
the part of a <HI>safe</HI> conscience not to condemn any man,
whilst there exists the minutest possibility of his inno∣cence.
Any story they may happen to have heard or read
whether real or feigned in which courts of justice have
been misled by presumptions of guilt, is enough, in their
minds, to found an acquittal upon, where positive proof is
wanting. I do not mean that juries should indulge con∣jectures,
magnify suspicions into proofs, or even that
they should weigh probabilities in <HI>gold scales;</HI> but when
the preponderation of evidence is so manifest, as to per∣suade
every private understanding of the prisoner's guilt,
when it furnishes that degree of credibility, upon which
men decide and act in all other doubts, and which ex∣perience
<PB N="551" REF="591"/>
hath shown that they may decide and act upon
with sufficient safety; to reject such proof, from an insinua∣tion
of uncertainty that belongs to all human affairs, and a
general dread, left the charge of innocent blood should lie at
their doors, is a conduct, which, however natural to a
mind studious of its own quiet, is authorised by no con∣siderations
of rectitude or utility. It counteracts the
care, and damps the activity of government: it holds out
public encouragement to villainy, by confessing the im∣possibility
of bringing villains to justice; and that species
of encouragement, which, as hath been just now ob∣served,
the minds of such men are most apt to entertain
and dwell upon.</P>
<P>There are two popular maxims, which seem to have a
considerable influence, in producing the injudicious ac∣quittals
of which we have been complaining. One is, “that
circumstantial evidence falls short of positive proof.”
This assertion, in the unqualified sense in which it is ap∣plied,
is not true. A concurrence of well-authenticated
circumstances composes a stronger ground of assurance,
than positive testimony, unconfirmed by circumstances,
usually affords. Circumstances cannot lie. The conclu∣sion
also, which results from them, though deduced by
only probable inference, is commonly more to be relied
upon, than the veracity of an unsupported solitary wit∣ness.
The danger of being deceived is less; the actual
instances of deception are fewer in the one case than the
other. What is called positive proof in criminal matters,
<PB N="552" REF="592"/>
as where a man swears to the person of the prisoner, and
that he actually saw him commit the crime with which
he is charged, may be founded in the mistake or perjury
of a single witness. Such mistakes, and such perjuries,
are not without many examples. Whereas, to impose
upon a court of justice a chain of <HI>circumstantial</HI> evidence
in support of a fabricated accusation, requires such a number
of false witnesses as seldom meet together; an union also of
skill and wickedness, which is still more rare; and after all,
this species of proof lies much more open to discussion,
and is more likely, if false, to be contradicted, or to be∣tray
itself by some unforeseen inconsistency, than that
direct proof, which being confined within the know∣ledge
of a single person, which appealing to, or standing
connected with no external or collateral circumstances, is
incapable, by its very simplicity, of being confronted
with opposite probabilities.</P>
<P>The other maxim which deserves a similar examination
is this, “that it is better that ten guilty persons escape,
than that one innocent man should suffer.” If by saying
it is <HI>better,</HI> be meant that it is more for the public advan∣tage,
the proposition, I think, cannot be maintained. The
security of civil life, which is essential to the value and the
enjoyment of every blessing it contains, and the interrup∣tion
of which is followed by universal misery and confu∣sion,
is protected chiefly by the dread of punishment.
The misfortune of an individual, for such may the suffer∣ings,
<PB N="553" REF="593"/>
or even the death of an innocent person be called,
when they are occasioned by no evil intention, cannot be
placed in competition with this object. I do not contend
that the life or safety of the meanest subject ought, in
any case, to be knowingly sacrificed. No principle of ju∣dicature,
no end of punishment can ever require <HI>that.</HI>
But when certain rules of adjudication must be pursued,
when certain degrees of credibility must be accepted, in
order to reach the crimes with which the public are in∣fested;
courts of justice should not be deterred from the
application of these rules, by <HI>every</HI> suspicion of danger, or
by the mere possibility of confounding the innocent with
the guilty. They ought rather to reflect, that he, who falls
by a mistaken sentence, may be considered as falling for
his country; whilst he suffers under the operation of these
rules, by the general effect and tendency of which, the
welfare of the community is maintained and upheld.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Religious Establishments, and of Toleration.</HEAD>
<P>“A Religious establishment is no part of Christianity,
it is only the means of inculcating it.”—It can∣not
be proved that any form of church government was
laid down in scripture with a view of fixing a constitution
for succeeding ages; and which constitution, conse∣quently,
the disciples of christianity would, every where,
and at all times, by the very law of their religion, be
obliged to adopt. Certainly no command for this purpose
was delivered by Christ himself; and if it may be shown
that the apostles ordained bishops and presbyters amongst
their first converts, it must be remembered that deacons
also and deaconesses were appointed by the same autho∣rity,
with functions very dissimilar to any which obtain
in the church at present. The truth seems to have been,
<PB N="555" REF="595"/>
that such offices were at first erected in the Christian
church, as the good order, the instruction and the exi∣gences
of the society at that time required, without any
intention, at least without any declared design, of regu∣lating
the appointment, authority, or the distinction of
Christian ministers under future circumstances. This
reserve, if we may so call it, in the Christian Legislator,
is sufficiently accounted for by two considerations: First,
that no precise constitution could be framed, which would
suit with the condition of Christianity in its primitive state,
and with that which it was to assume when it should be
advanced into a national religion. Secondly, that a par∣ticular
designation of office or authority amongst the
ministers of the new religion, might have so interfered
with the arrangements of civil policy, as to have formed,
in some countries, a considerable obstacle to the progress
and reception of the religion itself.</P>
<P>The authority therefore, of a church establishment is
founded in its utility: and whenever, upon this principle,
we deliberate concerning the form, propriety, or compara∣tive
excellency of different establishments, the single
view under which we ought to consider any of them is
that of “a scheme of instruction;” the single end we
ought to propose by them is, “the preservation and
communication of religious knowledge.” Every other
idea, and every other end that have been mixed with this,
as the making of the church an engine, or even <HI>an ally</HI>
of the state; converting it into the means of strengthen∣ing
<PB N="556" REF="596"/>
or of diffusing influence; or regarding it as a support of
regal in opposition to popular forms of government, have
served only to debase the institution, and to introduce
into it many corruptions and abuses.</P>
<P>The notion of a religious establishment comprehends
three things;—a clergy, or an order of men secluded
from other professions to attend upon the offices of reli∣gion;—a
legal provision for the maintenance of the
clergy;—and the confining of that provision to the teachers
of a particular sect of Christianity. If any one of these
three things be wanting; if there be no clergy, as
amongst the quakers; or, if the clergy have no other
provision than what they derive from the voluntary con∣tribution
of their hearers; or, if the provision which the
laws assign to the support of religion be extended to va∣rious
sects and denominations of Christians, there exists
no national religion or established church, according to
the sense which these terms are usually made to convey.
He, therefore, who would defend ecclesiastical establish∣ments,
must show the separate utility of these three
essential parts of their constitution.</P>
<P>1. The question first in order upon the subject, as well
as the most fundamental in its importance, is, whether
the knowledge and profession of Christianity can be main∣tained
in a country, without a class of men set apart by
public authority to the study and teaching of religion,
and to the conducting of public worship; and for those
<PB N="557" REF="597"/>
purposes secluded from other employments. I add this
last circumstance, because in it consists, as I take it, the
substance of the question. Now it must be remembered
that Christianity is an historical religion, founded in facts
which are related to have passed, upon discourses which
were held, and letters which were written, in a remote
age and distant country of the world, as well as under a
state of life and manners, and during the prevalency of
opinions, customs and institutions, very unlike any
which are found amongst mankind at present. Moreover
this religion, having been first published in the country
of Judea, and being built upon the more ancient religion
of the Jews, is necessarily and intimately connected with
the sacred writings, with the history and polity of that
singular people; to which must be added, that the records
of both revelations are preserved in languages which
have long ceased to be spoken in any part of the world.
Books which come down to us from times so remote, and
under so many causes of unavoidable obscurity, cannot,
it is evident, be understood without study and preparation.
The languages must be learnt. The various writings
which these volumes contain, must be carefully com∣pared
with one another, and with themselves. What
remains of cotemporary authors, or of authors con∣nected
with the age, the country, or the subject of our
scriptures, must be perused and consulted, in order to
interpret doubtful forms of speech, and to explain allu∣sions
which refer to object or usages that no longer exist.
Above all, the modes of expression, the habits of reason∣ing
<PB N="558" REF="598"/>
and argumentation, which were then in use, and to
which the discourses even of inspired teachers were ne∣cessarily
adapted, must be sufficiently known, and can
only be known at all, by a due acquaintance with ancient
literature. And, lastly, to establish the genuineness and
integrity of the canonical scriptures themselves, a series
of testimony recognizing the notoriety and reception of
these books, must be deduced from times near to those
of their first publication, down the succession of ages
through which they have been transmitted to us. The
qualifications necessary for such researches demand, it is
confessed, a degree of leisure, and a kind of education,
inconsistent with the exercise of any other profession;
but how few are there amongst the clergy, from whom
any thing of this sort can be expected! How small a
proportion of their number, who seem likely either to
augment the fund of sacred literature, or even to collect
what is already known!—To this objection it may be
replied, that we sow many seeds to raise one flower.—In
order to produce a <HI>few</HI> capable of improving and continu∣ing
the stock of Christian erudition, leisure and opport∣unity
must be afforded to great numbers. Original
knowledge of this kind can never be universal; but it is
of the utmost importance, and it is enough, that there
be, at all times, found <HI>some</HI> qualified, for such enquiries,
and in whose concurring and independent conclu∣sions
upon each subject, the rest of the Christian com∣munity
may safely confide: whereas without an order of
clergy educated for the purpose, and led to the prosecu∣tion
<PB N="559" REF="599"/>
of these studies by the habits, the leisure and the
object of their vocation, it may well be questioned whe∣ther
the learning itself would not have been lost, by
which the records of our faith are interpreted and de∣fended.
We contend, therefore, that an order of clergy
is necessary to perpetuate the evidences of revelation, and
to interpret the obscurities of these ancient writings, in
which the religion is contained. But besides this, which
forms, no doubt, one design of their institution, the
more ordinary offices of public teaching, and of con∣ducting
public worship, call for qualifications not usually to
be met with amidst the employments of civil life. It has
been acknowledged by some, who cannot be suspected of
making unnecessary concessions in favour of establish∣ments,
“to be barely <HI>possible</HI> that a person who was never
educated for the office should acquit himself with decency
as a public teacher of religion:” And that surely must be
a very defective policy, which trusts to <HI>possibilities</HI> for suc∣cess,
when provision is to be made for regular and general
instruction. Little objection to this argument can be
drawn from the example of the quakers, who it may be
said, furnish an experimental proof that the worship and
profession of Christianity may be upheld without a separate
clergy. These sectaries every where subsist in conjunction
with a regular establishment. They have access to the
writings, they profit by the labours of the clergy, in
common with other Christians. They participate in that
general diffusion of religious knowledge, which the constant
teaching of a more regular ministry keeps up in the country:
<PB N="560" REF="600"/>
with such aids, and under such circumstances, the de∣defects
of a plan may not be much felt, although the
plan itself be altogether unfit for general imitation.</P>
<P>2. If then an order of clergy be necessary, if it be ne∣cessary
also to seclude them from the employments and
profits of other professions, it is evident they ought to be
enabled to derive a maintenance from their own. Now this
maintenance must either depend upon the voluntary con∣tributions
of their hearers, or arise from revenues assigned
by authority of law. To the scheme of voluntary con∣tribution
there exists this insurmountable objection, that
few would ultimately contribute any thing at all. How∣ever
the zeal of a sect, or the novelty of a change,
might support such an experiment for a while, no reliance
could be placed upon it as a general and permanent pro∣vision.
It is at all times a bad constitution which; presents
temptations of interest in opposition to the duties of re∣ligion;
or which makes the offices of religion, expensive
to those who attend upon them; or which allows pre∣sences
of conscience to be an excuse for not sharing in a
public burthen. If, by declining to frequent religious
assemblies, men could save their money, at the same
time that they indulged their indolence, and their dis∣inclination
to exercises of seriousness and reflection; or
if, by dissenting from the national religion, they could
be excused from contributing to the support of the mi∣nisters
of religion, it is to be feared that many would
take advantage of the option which was thus imprudently
<PB N="561" REF="601"/>
left open to them, and that this liberty might finally
operate to the decay of virtue, and an irrecoverable for∣getfulness
of all religion in the country. Is there not
too much reason to fear, that, if it were reserred to the
discretion of each neighbourhood, whether they would
maintain amongst them a teacher of religion or not,
many districts would remain unprovided with any?—that
with the difficulties which incumber every measure,
requiring the co-operation of numbers, and where each
individual of the number has an interest secretly pleading
against the success of the measure itself, associations for
the support of Christian worship and instruction would
neither be numerous nor long continued. The devout and
pious might lament in vain the want or the distance of a
religious assembly: they could not form nor maintain
one, without the concurrence of neighbours who felt
neither their zeal nor their liberality.</P>
<P>From the difficulty with which congregations would
be established and upheld upon the <HI>voluntary</HI> plan, let us
carry our thoughts to the condition of those who are to
officiate in them. Preaching in time would become a
mode of begging. With what sincerity, or with what
dignity, can a preacher dispense the truths of Christia∣nity,
whose thoughts are perpetually solicited to the
reflection how he may increase his subscription. His
eloquence, if he possess any, resembles rather the exhi∣bition
of a player who is computing the profits of his
theatre, than the simplicity of a man, who, feeling
<PB N="562" REF="602"/>
himself the awful expectations of religion, is seeking to
bring others to such a sense and understanding of their
duty as may save their souls. Moreover, a little experi∣ence
of the disposition of the common people will inform
us, that it is one thing to edify them in Christian know∣ledge,
and another to gratify their taste for vehement
impassioned oratory—that he, not only whose success but
whose subsistence depends upon collecting and pleasing a
croud, must resort to other arts than the acquirement and
communication of sober and profitable instruction—to be
thus at the mercy of his audience, to be obliged to adapt
his doctrines to the pleasure of a capricious multitude,
to be continually affecting a style and manner of preach∣ing
neither natural to him, nor agreeable to his judg∣ment,
to live in constant bondage to tyrannical and
insolent directors, are circumstances so mortifying, not
only to the pride of the human heart, but to the virtuous
love of independency, that they are rarely submitted to
without a sacrifice of principle, and a depravation of cha∣racter—at
least it may be pronounced, that a ministry,
so degraded, would soon fall into the lowest hands; for
it would be found impracticable to engage men of worth
and ability, in so precarious and humiliating a profession.</P>
<P>If it be admitted then, in deference to these reasons,
that a legal provision for the clergy, cornpulsory upon
those who contribute to it, is expedient; the next ques∣tion
will be, whether this provision should be confined to
one sect of Christianity, or be extended indifferently to
<PB N="563" REF="603"/>
all.—Now it should be observed that this question can
never offer itself where the people are agreed in their re∣ligious
opinions, and that it never ought to arise, where
a system can be framed of doctrines and worship wide
enough to comprehend their disagreement: and which
may satisfy all by uniting all in the articles of their com∣mon
faith; and in a mode of divine worship, omitting
every subject of controversy or offence.—Where such a
comprehension is practicable, the comprehending religion
ought to be made that of the state. But if this be des∣paired
of; if religious opinions exist, not only so various,
but so contradictory, as to render it impossible to reconcile
them to each other, or to any one confession of faith, rule
of discipline, or form of worship; if, consequently,
separate congregations and different sects must unavoid∣ably
continue in the country, under such circumstances
whether the laws ought to establish one sect in preference
to the rest, that is, whether they ought to confer the
provision assigned to the maintenance of religion upon
the teachers of one system of doctrines alone, becomes a
question of necessary discussion and of great importance.
And whatever we may determine concerning speculative
rights and abstract proprieties, when we set about the
framing of an ecclesiastical constitution adapted to real
life, and to the actual state of religion in the country,
we shall find this question very nearly related to, and
principally, indeed, dependent upon another; namely,
“in what way or by whom ought the ministers of reli∣gion
to be appointed?” If the species of patronage be
<PB N="564" REF="604"/>
retained to which we are accustomed in this country, and
which allows private individuals to nominate teachers of
religion for districts and congregations to which they are
absolute strangers, without some test proposed to the
persons nominated, the utmost discordancy of religious
opinions might frequently arise between the several
teachers and their respective congregations. A popish
patron might appoint a priest to say mass to a congrega∣tion
of protestants; an episcopal clergyman be sent to
officiate in a parish of presbyterians; or a presbyterian
divine to inveigh against the errors of popery before an
audience of papists. The requisition then of subscription,
or any other test, by which the national religion is
guarded, may be considered as a restriction upon the exer∣cise
of private patronage. The laws speak to the private
patron thus: “Of those whom we have previously pronoun∣ced
to be fitly qualified to teach religion, we allow you to
select one; but we do not allow you to decide what reli∣gion
shall be established in a particular district of the
country; for which decision you are in no wise fitted by
any qualifications which, as a private patron, you may
happen to possess. If it be necessary that the point be de∣termined
for the inhabitants by any other will than their
own, it is surely better that it should be determined by
the deliberate resolution of the legislature, than by the
casual inclination of an individual, by whom the right is
purchased, or to whom it devolves as a mere temporal in∣heritance.”
Wheresoever, therefore, this constitution of
patronage is adopted, a national religion, or the legal
<PB N="565" REF="605"/>
preference of one particular religion to all others,
must almost necessarily accompany it. Or, secondly, if
it be supposed that the appointment of the minister of
religion is left in each parish to the choice of the parish∣ioners,
may not this choice be safely exercised without
its being limited to the teachers of any particular sect?
The effect of such a liberty would be, that a papist, or
a presbyterian, a methodist, a Moravian, or an anabaptist
might successively gain possession of the pulpit according
as a majority of the party happened at each election to
prevail. Now with what violence the conflict would up∣on
every vacancy be renewed; what bitter animosities
would be revived, or rather be constantly fed and kept
alive in the neighbourhood; with what unconquerable
aversion the teacher and his religion would be received by
the defeated party, may be foreseen by those who reflect
with how much passion every dispute is carried on, in
which the name of religion can be made to mix itself;
much more where the cause itself is concerned so imme∣diately
as it would be in this. Or, thirdly, if the state
appoint the ministers of religion, this constitution will
differ little from the establishment of a national religion;
for the state would, undoubtedly, appoint those, and
those alone, whose religions opinions, or rather whose
religious denomination agreed with their own: unless it
be thought that any thing would be gained to religious
liberty by transferring the choice of the national religion
from the legislature of the country to the magistrate, who
administers the executive government. The only plan
<PB N="566" REF="606"/>
which seems to render the legal maintenance of a clergy
practicable, without the legal preference of one sect of
Christians to others, is that of an experiment which is
said to be attempted or designed in some of the new states
of North America. The nature of the plan is thus de∣scribed.
A tax is levied upon the inhabitants for the
general support of religion; the collector of the tax
goes round with a register in his hand, in which are in∣serted,
at the head of so many distinct columns, the
names of the several religious sects, that are professed in
the country.—The person, who is called upon for the
assessment, as soon as he has paid his quota, subscribes
his name in which of the columns he pleases: and the
amount of what is collected in each column is paid over
to the minister of that denomination. In this scheme it
is not referred to the option of the subject, whether he
will contribute, or what he shall contribute to the main∣tenance
of a Christian ministry; it is only left to his
choice to determine by what sect his contribution shall
be received. The above arrangement is, undoubtedly,
the best that has been proposed upon this principle; it
bears the appearance of liberality and justice, it may
contain some solid advantages; nevertheless it labours
under inconveniences which will be found, I think, upon
trial, to over-balance all its recommendations. It is
scarcely compatible with that, which is the first requisite
in an ecclesiastical establishment, the division of the
country into parishes of a commodious extent. If the
parishes be small, and ministers of every denomination be
<PB N="567" REF="607"/>
stationed in each, which the plan seems to suppose, the
expence of their maintenance would become too burthen∣some
a charge for the country to support. If, to reduce
the expence, the districts be enlarged, the place of assem∣bling
would oftentimes be too far removed from the
residence of the persons who ought to resort to it. Again,
the making the pecuniary success of the different teachers
of religion to depend upon the number and wealth of
their respective followers, would naturally generate
strifes, and indecent jealousies amongst them, as well as
produce a polemical and proselyting spirit, founded in
or mixed with views of private gain, which would both
deprave the principles of the clergy, and distract the
country with endless contentions.</P>
<P>The argument, then, by which ecclesiastical estab∣lishments
are defended, proceeds by these steps. The
knowledge and profession of Christianity cannot be up∣held
without a clergy; a clergy cannot be supported
without a legal provision; a legal provision for the clergy
cannot be constituted without the preference of one sect
of Christians to the rest: and the conclusion will be satis∣factory
in the degree in which the truth of these several
propositions has been made out.</P>
<P>If it be deemed expedient to establish a national reli∣gion,
that is to say, one sect in preference to all others;
some test, by which the teachers of that sect may be
distinguished from the teachers of different sects,
<PB N="568" REF="608"/>
appears to be an indispensible consequence. The exist∣ence
of such an establishment supposes it—the very no∣tion
of a national religion includes that of a test. But
this necessity, which is real, hath, according to the
fashion of human affairs, furnished to almost every church
a pretence for extending, multiplying and continuing
such tests beyond what the occasion justified. For though
some purposes of order and tranquillity may be answered
by the establishment of creeds and confessions; yet they
are at all times attended with serious inconveniences.
They check enquiry; they violate liberty; they ensnare
the consciences of the clergy by holding out temptations
to prevarication: however, they may express the persua∣sion,
or be accommodated to the controversies or to the
fears of the age, in which they are composed, in process
of time, and by reason of the changes which are wont
to take place in the judgment of mankind upon religious
subjects, they come at length to contradict the actual
opinions of the church, whose doctrines they profess to
contain; and they often perpetuate the proscription of
sects and tenets, from which any danger has long ceased
to be apprehended.</P>
<P>It may not follow from these objections that tests and
subscriptions ought to be abolished; but it follows that
they ought to be made as simple and easy as possible;
that they should be adapted from time to time to the
varying sentiments and circumstances of the church in
which they are received; and that they should at no time
<PB N="569" REF="609"/>
advance one step farther than some subsisting necessity
requires. If, for instance, promises of conformity to the
rites, liturgy and offices of the church, be sufficient to
prevent confusion and disorder in the celebration of divine
worship, then such promises ought to be accepted in the
place of stricter subscriptions. If articles of <HI>peace,</HI> as they
are called, that is, engagements not to preach certain doc∣trines,
or to revive certain controversies, would exclude
indecent altercations amongst the national clergy, as well
as secure to the public teaching of religion as much of
uniformity and quiet as is necessary to edification; then
confessions of <HI>faith</HI> ought to be converted into articles of
<HI>peace.</HI> In a word, it ought to be held a sufficient
reason for relaxing the terms of subscription, or for drop∣ping
any or all of the articles to be subscribed, that no
<HI>present</HI> necessity requires the strictness which is complain∣ed
of, or that it should be extended to so many points of
doctrine.</P>
<P>The division of the country into districts, and the sta∣tioning
in each a teacher of religion, forms the substantial
part of every church establishment. The varieties that
have been introduced into the government and discipline
of different churches are of inferior importance, when
compared with this, in which they all agree. Of these
oeconomical questions, none seems more material than that
which has been long agitated in the reformed churches of
Christendom, whether a parity amongst the clergy, or a
distinction of orders in the ministry, be most conducive
<PB N="570" REF="610"/>
to the general ends of the institution. In favour of that
system which the laws of this country have preferred, we
may alledge the following reasons; that it secures tran∣quillity
and subordination amongst the clergy themselves;
that it corresponds with the gradations of rank in civil
life, and provides for the edification of each rank, by sta∣tioning
in each an order of clergy of their own class and
quality; and lastly, that the same fund produces more
effect, both as an allurement to men of talents to enter
into the church, and as a stimulus to the industry of those
who are already in it, when distributed into prizes of
different value, than when divided into equal shares.</P>
<P>After the state has once established a particular system
of faith as a national religion, a question will soon occur,
concerning the treatment and toleration of those who dis∣sent
from it.—And this question is properly preceded by
another, concerning the right which the civil magistrate
possesses to interfere in matters of religion at all; for
although this right be acknowledged whilst he is em∣ployed
solely in providing means of public instruction, it
will probably be disputed, indeed it ever has been, when
he proceeds to inflict penalties, to impose restraints, or in∣capacities
on the account of religious distinctions. They
who acknowledge no other just original of civil govern∣ment,
than what is founded in some stipulation with its
subjects, may with probability contend that the concerns
of religion were excepted out of the social compact; that
in an affair which is transacted between God and a man's
<PB N="571" REF="611"/>
own conscience, no commission or authority was ever de∣legated
to the civil magistrate, or could indeed be trans∣serred
from the person himself to any other. We, how∣ever,
who have rejected this theory, because we cannot
discover any actual contract between the state and the
people, and because we cannot allow an arbitrary fiction
to be made the foundation of real rights and of real obli∣gations,
find ourselves precluded from this distinction.
The reasoning which deduces the authority of civil go∣vernment
from the will of God, and which collects that
will from public expediency alone, binds us to the unre∣served
conclusion, that the jurisdiction of the magistrate is
limited by no consideration but that of general utility: In
plainer terms, that whatever be the subject to be regulated,
it is lawful for him to interfere, whenever his interference,
in its general tendency, appears to be conducive to the
common interest. There is nothing in the nature of re∣ligion,
as such, which exempts it from the authority of
the legislator, when the safety or welfare of the commu∣nity
requires his interposition. It has been said indeed,
that religion, pertaining to the interests of a life to come,
lies out of the province of civil government, the office of
which is confined to the affairs of this life. But in reply to
this objection, it may be observed, that when the laws
interfere even in religion, they interfere only with tem∣porals:
Their effects terminate, their power acts only
upon those rights and interests, which confessedly belong
to their disposal. The resolutions of the legislature, the
edicts of the prince, the sentence of the judge, cannot
<PB N="572" REF="612"/>
affect my salvation; nor do they, without the most absurd
arrogance, pretend to any such power: but they may
deprive me of liberty, of property, and even of life itself
on account of my religion; and however I may complain
of the injustice of the sentence, by which I am condemned,
I cannot alledge, that the magistrate has transgressed the
boundaries of his jurisdiction, because the property, the
liberty, and the life of the subject, may be taken away
by the authority of the laws, for any reason, which, in the
judgment of the legislature, renders such a measure neces∣sary
to the common welfare. Moreover, as the precepts
of religion may regulate all the offices of life, or may be so
construed as to extend to all, the exemption of religion
from the controll of human laws might afford a plea,
which would exclude civil government from all authority
over the conduct of its subjects. Religious liberty is like
civil liberty, not an immunity from restraint, but the being
restrained by no law, but what in a greater degree con∣duces
to the public welfare.</P>
<P>Still it is right “to obey God rather than, man.” No∣thing
that we have said encroaches upon the truth of this
sacred and undisputed maxim: the right of the magistrate
to ordain, and the obligation of the subject to obey, in
matters of religion, may be very different; and will be so as
often as they flow from opposite apprehensions of the divine
will. In affairs that are properly of a civil nature, in “the
things that are Caesar's,” this difference seldom happens.
The law authorizes the act which it enjoins; revelation being
<PB N="573" REF="613"/>
either silent upon the subject, or referring it to the laws
of the country, or requiring only that men act by some
fixed rule, and that this rule be established by competent
authority. But when human, laws interpose their direc∣tion
in matters of religion, by dictating, for example, the
object or mode of divine worship; by prohibiting the profes∣sion
of some articles of faith, and by exacting that of others,
they are liable to clash with what private persons believe
to be already settled by precepts of revelation, or to contra∣dict
what God himself, they think, hath declared to be
true. In this case, on whichever side the mistake lies, or
whatever plea, the state may alledge to justify its edict, the
subject can have none to excuse his compliance. The same
consideration also shews us the distinction as to the
authority of the state between temporals and spirituals.
The magistrate is not to be obeyed in one, any more than
in the other, where any repugnancy is perceived between
his commands, and certain credited manifestations of the
divine will; but such repugnancies, are much less likely
to arise in one case than the other.</P>
<P>When we grant that it is lawful for the magistrate to
interfere in religion as often as his interference appears to
him to conduce, in its general tendency, to the public
happiness; it may be argued from, this concession, that
since salvation is the highest interest of mankind, and since
consequently to advance <HI>that</HI> is to promote the public hap∣piness
in the best way, and in the greatest degree, in which
it can be promoted; it follows, that it is not only the
<PB N="574" REF="614"/>
right, but the duty of every magistrate, invested with supreme
power, to enforce upon his subjects the reception
of that religion, which he deems most acceptable to God;
and to enforce it by such methods as may appear
most effectual for the end proposed. A popish king, for
example, who should believe that salvation is not attain∣able
out of the precincts of the Romish church, would
derive a right, from our principles, not to say that he would
be bound by them, to employ the power, with which the
constitution intrusted him, and which power, in absolute
monarchies, commands the lives and fortunes of every
subject of the empire, in reducing his people within that
communion. We confess that this consequence is infer∣red
from the principles we have laid down concerning the
foundation of civil authority, not without the resemblance
of a regular deduction:—we consess also, that it is a con∣clusion
which it behoves us to dispose of; because if it
really followed from our theory of government, the theory
itself ought to be given up. Now it will be remembered,
that the terms of our proposition are these: “That it is
lawful for the magistrate to interfere in the affairs of re∣ligion,
whenever his interference appears to him to con∣duce,
by its general tendency, to the public happiness.”
The clause of “general tendency,” when this rule comes to
be applied, will be found a very significant part of the
direction. It obliges the magistrate to reflect, not only,
whether the religion, which he wishes to propagate
amongst his subjects, be that which will best secure their
eternal welfare: not only, whether the methods he em∣ploys
<PB N="575" REF="615"/>
be likely to effectuate the establishment of that
religion; but also upon this farther question, whether the
kind of interference, which he is about to exercise, if it
were adopted as a common maxim amongst states and
princes, or received as a general rule for the conduct of
government in matters of religion, would, upon the whole,
and in the mass of instances, in which his example might
be imitated, conduce to the furtherance of human salva∣tion.
If the magistrate, for example, should think, that,
although the application of his power might, in the in∣stance
concerning which he deliberates, advance the true
religion, and together with it the happiness of his people,
yet that the same engine in other hands, who might assume
the right to use it with the like pretensions of reason and
authority that he himself alledges, would more frequently
shut out truth, and obstruct the means of salvation; he
would be bound by this opinion, and still admitting pub∣lic
utility to be the supreme rule of his conduct, to refrain
from expedients, which, whatever particular effects <HI>he</HI> may
expect from them, are in their general operation dangerous
or hurtful. If there be any difficulty in the sub∣ject,
it arises from that, which is the cause of every
difficulty in morals, the competition of particular and
general consequences—or what is the same thing, the
submission of one general rule to another rule, which is still
more general.</P>
<P>Bearing then in mind that it is the <HI>general</HI> tendency of
the measure, or in other words, the effects which would
<PB N="576" REF="616"/>
arise from the measure being <HI>generally</HI> adopted, that fixes
upon it the character of rectitude or injustice; we pro∣ceed
to inquire what is the degree and the sort of inter∣ference
of secular laws in matters of religion, which are
likely to be beneficial to the public happiness. There are
two maxims which will in a great measure regulate our
conclusions upon this head. The first is, that any form
of Christianity is better than no religion at all; the second,
that of different systems of faith, that is the best, which is
the truest. The first of these positions will hardly be dis∣puted,
when we reflect, that every sect and modification
of Christianity holds out the happiness and misery of ano∣ther
life, as depending chiefly upon the practice of virtue
or of vice in this; and that the distinctions of virtue and
vice are nearly the same in all. A person, who acts under
the impression of these hopes and fears, though com∣bined
with many errors and superstitions, is more likely
to advance both the public happiness and his own, than
one who is destitute of all expectation of a future ac∣count.
The latter proposition is founded in the consideration,
that the principal importance of religion, consists in
its influence upon the fate and condition of a future exist∣ence.
This influence belongs only to that religion which
comes from God. A political religion, may be framed,
which shall embrace the purposes, and describe the duties
of political society perfectly well; but if it be not deli∣vered
by God, what assurance does it afford, that the
decisions of the divine judgment will have any regard
to the rules which it contains? By a man who acts with
<PB N="577" REF="617"/>
view to a future judgment, the authority of a religion,
is the first thing enquired after: a religion, which wants
authority, with him wants every thing. Since then this
authority appertains not to the religion which is most
commodious; to the religion which is most sublime and
efficacious; to the religion which suits best with the
constitution, or seems most calculated to uphold the power
and stability of civil government; but only to that reli∣gion
which comes from God, we are justified in pro∣nouncing
the <HI>true</HI> religion, by its very <HI>truth,</HI> and indepen∣dently
of all considerations of tendencies, aptnesses, or any
other internal qualities whatever, to be universally the <HI>best.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>first</HI> proposition follows this inference, that
when the state enables its subjects to learn <HI>some</HI> form of
Christianity, by distributing teachers of a religious system
throughout the country, and by providing for the main∣tenance
of these teachers at the public expence; that is,
in fewer terms, when the laws establish a national religion,
they exercise a power and an interference, which are likely,
in their general tendency, to promote the interest of
mankind: for even supposing the species of Christianity;
which the laws patronize, to he erroneous and corrupt,
yet when the option lies between this religion and no
religion at all, which would be the consequence of leaving
the people without any public means of instruction, or any
regular celebration of the offices of Christianity, our
proposition teaches us that, the former alternative is con∣stantly
to be preferred.</P>
<P><PB N="578" REF="618"/>
But after the right of the magistrate to establish a parti∣cular
religion has been, upon this principle, admitted; a
doubt sometimes presents itself, whether the religion which
he ought to establish be that which he himself professes,
or that which he observes to prevail amongst the majority of
the people. Now when we consider this question with a
view to the formation of a general rule upon the subject, and
which view alone can furnish a just solution of the doubt, it
must be assumed to be an equal chance whether of the two
religions is the more true, that of the magistrate, or that of
the people. The chance then that is left to truth being equal
upon both suppositions, the remaining consideration will
be, from which arrangement more efficacy can be expected—from
an order of men appointed to teach the people their
own religion, or to convert them to another. In my
opinion the advantage lies on the side of the former scheme:
and this opinion, if it be assented to, makes it the duty of
the magistrate, in the choice of the religion which he
establishes, to consult the faith of the nation rather than
his own.</P>
<P>The case also of dissenters must be determined by the
principles just now stated. <HI>Toleration</HI> is of two kinds,—the
allowing to dissenters the unmolested profession and exer∣cise
of their religion, but with an exclusion from offices of
trust and emolument in the state, which is a <HI>partial</HI>
toleration; and the admitting them without distinction, to
all the civil privileges and capacities of other citizens,
<PB N="579" REF="619"/>
which is a <HI>complete</HI> toleration. The general expediency of
toleration, and consequently the general right of the subject
to demand it, as far as relates to liberty of conscience, and
the claim of being protected in the free and safe profession
of his religion, is deducible from the <HI>second</HI> of those
propositions, which we have delivered as the grounds of
our conclusions upon the subject. That proposition asserts
truth, and truth in the abstract, to be the supreme perfec∣tion
of every religion. The advancement consequently, and
discovery of truth, is that end to which all regulations
concerning religion ought principally to be adapted. Now
every species of intolerance which enjoins suppression and
silence; and every species of persecution which enforces
such injunctions, is adverse to the progress of truth; for∣asmuch
as it causes that to be fixed by one set of men, at
one time, which is much better, and with much more
probability of success, left to the independent and pro∣gressive
enquiries of separate individuals. Truth results
from discussion and from controversy—is investigated by
the labours and researches of private persons. Whatever
therefore prohibits these, obstructs that industry and that
liberty, which it is the common interest of mankind to
promote. In religion, as in other subjects, truth, if left to
itself, will almost always gain the ascendency. If different
religions be professed in the same country, and the minds
of men be unfettered and unawed by intimidations of law,
that religion, which is founded in maxims of reason and
credibility, will gradually gain over the other to it. I
do not mean, that men will formally renounce their ancient
<PB N="580" REF="620"/>
religion, but that they will adopt into it the more
rational doctrines, the improvements and discoveries of
the neighbouring sect; by which means the worse reli∣gion,
without the ceremony of a reformation, will insensibly
assimulate itself to the better. If popery, for instance,
and protestantism were permitted to dwell quietly
together, papists might not become protestants, (for the
name is commonly the last thing that is changed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Would we let the <HI>name</HI> stand, we might often attract men, without their perceiving it, much nearer to ourselves, than, if they did perceive it, they would be willing to come.</NOTE>) but,
they would become more enlightened and informed; they
would by little and little incorporate into their creed
many of the tenets of protestantism, as well as imbibe
a portion of its spirit and moderation.</P>
<P>The justice and expediency of toleration we found
<HI>principally</HI> in its conduciveness to truth, and in the supe∣rior
value of truth to that of any other quality which a
religion can possess: but there are some auxiliary consider∣ations
too important to be omitted. The confining of the
subject to the religion of the state, is a needless violation
of natural liberty, and in an instance in which constraint is
always grievous. Persecution produces no sincere con∣viction,
nor any real change of opinion; on the contrary,
it depraves the public morals by driving men to prevari∣cation
and commonly ends in a general tho' secret
infidelity, by imposing, under the name of revealed
religion, systems of doctrine which men cannot believe,
<PB N="581" REF="621"/>
and dare not examine—finally, it disgraces the character
and wounds the reputation, of Christianity itself, by
making it the author of oppression, cruelty and bloodshed.</P>
<P>Under the idea of religious toleration I include the
toleration of all books of serious argumentation; but I
deem it no infringement of religious liberty to restrain the
circulation of ridicule, inventive and mockery upon reli∣gious
subjects. Because this species of writing applies
solely to the passions, weakens the judgment, and contami∣nates
the imagination of its readers; has no tendency
whatever to assist either the investigation or the impression
of truth; on the contrary, whilst it stays not to distinguish
the character or authority of different religions, it destroys alike the influence of all.</P>
<P>Concerning the admission of dissenters from the esta∣blished
religion to offices and employments in the public
service, which is necessary to render toleration <HI>complete,</HI>
doubts have been entertained with some appearance of
reason. It is possible that such religious opinions may
be holden as are utterly incompatible with the necessary
functions of civil government; and which opinions con∣sequently
disqualify those who maintain them, from
exercising any share in its administration. There have
been enthusiasts who held that Christianity has abolished
all distinction of property, and that she enjoins upon her followers a community of goods. With what tolerable
propriety could one of this sect be appointed a judge or a
<PB N="582" REF="622"/>
magistrate, whose office it was to decide upon questions of
private right, and to protect men in the exclusive enjoy∣ment
of their property. It would not be less absurd than
to entrust a military command to a quaker, who believes
it to be contrary to the gospel to take up arms. This is
possible; therefore it cannot be laid down as an universal
truth, that religion is not in its nature a cause which will
justify exclusion from public employments. When we
view, however, the sects of Christianity which actually
prevail in the world, we must confess, that with the single
exception, of refusing to bear arms, we find no tenet in
any of them, which incapacitates men for the service of
the state. It has indeed been asserted, that discordancy of
religions, even supposing each religion to be free from any
errors that affect the safety or the conduct of government,
is enough to render men unfit to act together in public sta∣tions.
But upon what argument or upon what experience,
is this assertion founded? I perceive no reason why men
of different religious persuasions, may not sit upon the same
bench, deliberate in the same, council, or fight in the same
ranks, as well as men of various or opposite opinions upon
any controverted topic of natural philosophy, history, on
ethics.</P>
<P>There are two cases, in which test laws, are wont to be
applied, and in which, if in any, they may be defended.
One is where two or more religions are contending for
establishment; and where there appears no way of putting
an end to the contest, but by giving to one religion such a
<PB N="583" REF="623"/>
decided superiority in the legislature and government of
the country, as to secure it against danger from any other.
I own that I should assent to this precaution with many
scruples. If the dissenters from the establishment become
a majority of the people, the establishment itself ought to
be altered or qualified. If there exist amongst the different
sects of the country such a parity of numbers, interest and
power, as to render the preference of one sect to the rest,
and the choice of that sect, a matter of hazardous success,
and of doubtful election; some plan similar to that which
is meditated in North America, and which we have
described in a preceding part of this chapter, may perhaps
suit better with this divided state of public opinions, than
any constitution of a national church whatever. In all
other situations, the establishment will be strong enough
to maintain itself. However if a test be applicable with
justice upon this principle at all, it ought to be applied
in regal governments to the chief magistrate himself,
whose power might otherwise overthrow or change the
established religion of the country, in opposition to the
will and sentiments of the people.</P>
<P>The second case of <HI>exclusion,</HI> and in which, I think,
the measure is more easily vindicated, is that of a country
in which some disaffection to the subsisting government,
happens to be connected with certain religious distinctions.
The state undoubtedly has a right to refuse its power
and its confidence to those who seek its destruction.
Wherefore, if the generality of any religious sect entertain
<PB N="584" REF="624"/>
dispositions hostile to the constitution, and if government
have no other way of knowing its enemies than by the
religion they profess, the professors of that religion may
justly be excluded from offices of trust and authority. But
even <HI>here</HI> it should be observed, that it is not against the
religion that government shuts its doors, but against these
political principles, which, however independent they
may be of any article of religious faith, the members of
that communion are found in fact to hold. Nor would
the legislator make religious tenets the test of men's
inclinations towards the state, if he could discover any
other that was equally certain and notorious. Thus if
the members of the Romish church, for the most part
adhere to the interests, or maintain the right of a foreign
pretender to the crown of these kingdoms; and if there
be no way of distinguishing those who do, from those who
do not retain such dangerous prejudices; government is
well warranted in fencing out the whole sect from situa∣tions
of trust and power. But even in this example it is
not to popery that the laws object, but to popery as the
mark of jacobitism; an equivocal indeed and fallacious
mark, but the best, and perhaps the only one that can be
devised. But then it should be remembered, that as
the connection between popery and jacobitism, which is
the sole cause of suspicion, and the sole justification of
those severe and jealous laws which have been enacted
against the professors of what religion, was accidental in
its origin, so probably it will be temporary in its duration;
and that these restrictions ought not to continue one day
<PB N="585" REF="625"/>
longer, than some visible danger renders them necessary
to the preservation of public tranquillity.</P>
<P>After all, it may be asked, why should not the
legislator direct his test against the political principles
themselves, which he wishes to exclude, rather than
encounter them through the medium of religious
tenets, the only crime and the only danger of which
consist in their presumed alliance with the former? Why,
for example, should a man be required to renounce tran∣substantiation,
before he be admitted to ail office in the
state, when it might seem to be sufficient that he abjure
the pretender? There are but two answers that can be
given to the objection which this question contains; first,
that it is not opinions which the laws fear, so much as
inclinations, and that political inclinations are not so easily
detected by the affirmation or denial of any abstract propo∣sition
in politics, as by the discovery of the religious creed
with which they are wont to be united: secondly, that
when men renounce their religion, they commonly quit
all connection with the members of the church which
they have left; that church no longer expecting assistance
or friendship from them: whereas particular persons
might insinuate themselves into offices of trust and autho∣rity
by subscribing political assertions, and yet retain their
predilection for the interests of the religious sect to which
they continued to belong. By which means government
would sometimes find, though it could not accuse
individual, whom it had received into its service, of
<PB N="586" REF="626"/>
disaffection to the civil establishment, yet that, through
him, it had communicated the aid and influence of a
powerful station to a party who were hostile to the consti∣tution.
These answers however, we propose, rather
than defend. The measure certainly cannot be defended
at all, except where the suspected union between certain
obnoxious principles in politics, and certain tenets in reli∣gion,
is nearly universal: in which case it makes little dif∣ference
to the subscriber, whether the test be religious or
political; and the state is somewhat better secured by the
one than the other.</P>
<P>The result of our examination of those general ten∣dencies,
by which every interference of civil government
in matters of religion ought to be tried, is this. “That a
<HI>comprehensive</HI> national religion, guarded by a few articles
of peace and conformity; with a legal provision for the
clergy of that religion; and with a <HI>complete</HI> toleration of
all dissenters from the established church, without any other
limitation or exception, than what arises from the conjunc∣tion
of dangerous political dispositions with certain reli∣gious
tenets, appears to be, not only the most just and
liberal, but the wisest and safest system, which a state can
adopt: inasmuch as it unites the several perfections which
a religious constitution ought to aim at—liberty of con∣science,
with means of instruction; the progress of truth,
with the peace of society; the right of private judgment,
with the care of the public safety.”</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Population and Provision; and of Agriculture and Commerce, as subservient thereto.</HEAD>
<P>THE final view of all rational politics is to produce
the greatest quantity of happiness in a given tract
of country. The riches, strength, and glory of nations,
the topics which history celebrates, and which alone almost
engage the praises, arid excite the admiration of mankind,
have no value farther than as they contribute to this end.
When they interfere with it, they are evils, and not the
less real, for the splendour that surrounds them.</P>
<P>Secondly, altho' we speak of communities as of sen∣tient
beings; altho' we ascribe to them happiness and
misery, desires, interests and passions, nothing really
exists or feels but <HI>individuals.</HI> The happiness of a people
is made up of the happiness of single persons; and the
<PB N="588" REF="628"/>
quantity of it can only be augmented by encreasing the num∣ber
of the percipients, or the pleasures of their perceptions.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Notwithstanding that diversity of condition,
especially different degrees of plenty, freedom and secu∣rity,
greatly vary the quantity of happiness enjoyed by
the same number of individuals; and notwithstanding
that extreme cases may be found, of human beings so galled
by the rigours of slavery, that the increase of numbers
is only the amplification of misery; yet, within certain
limits, and within those limits to which civil life is diver∣sified,
under the temperate governments that obtain in
Europe, it may be affirmed, I think, with certainty,
that the quantity of happiness produced in any given
district, (the object to which all the endeavours of public
wisdom should be directed,) <HI>so far</HI> depends upon the num∣ber
of inhabitants, that, in comparing adjoining periods,
in the same country, the collective happiness will be nearly
in the exact proportion of the numbers, that is, twice the
number of inhabitants will produce double the quantity
of happiness; in distant periods, and different countries,
under great changes or great dissimilitude of civil con∣dition,
although the proportion of enjoyment may fall
much short of that of the numbers, yet still, any
considerable excess of numbers will usually carry with
it a preponderation of happiness; that at least, it
may, and ought to be assumed, in all political delibera∣tions,
that a larger portion of happiness is enjoyed amongst
<HI>ten</HI> persons, possessing the means of healthy subsistence,
<PB N="589" REF="629"/>
than can be produced by <HI>five</HI> persons, under every advan∣tage
of power, affluence and luxury.</P>
<P>From these principles it follows, that the quantity of
happiness in a given district, although it is possible it may be
increased, the number of inhabitants remaining the same, is
chiefly and most naturally affected by alteration of the num∣bers:
that, consequently, the decay of population is the
greatest evil that a state can suffer; and the improvement of
it the object which ought, in all countries, to be aimed at,
in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever.</P>
<P>The importance of population, and the superiority of
<HI>it</HI> above every other national advantage, are points neces∣sary
to be inculcated, and to be well understood; inas∣much
as false estimates, or fantastic notions of national
grandeur, are perpetually drawing the attention of states∣men
and legislators from the care of this, which is, at all
times, the true and absolute interest of a country: for
which reason, we have stated these points with unusual
formality; we will confess, however, that a competition
can seldom arise between the advancement of population
and any measure of sober utility; because, in the ordinary
progress of human affairs, whatever, in any way, con∣tributes
to make a people happier, tends to render them
more numerous.</P>
<P>In the secundity of the human, as of every other species
of animals, nature has provided for an indefinite multipli∣cation.
<PB N="590" REF="630"/>
Mankind have increased to their present number
from a single pair: the offspring of early marriagess, in
the ordinary course of procreation, do more than replace
the parents: in countries, and under circumstances very
favourable to subsistence, the population has been doubled
in the space of twenty years: the havock occasioned by
wars, earthquakes, famine, or pestilence, is usually re∣paired
in a short time. These indications sufficiently
demonstrate the tendency of nature hi the human species
to a continual increase of its numbers. It becomes there∣fore
a question that may reasonably be propounded,
What are the causes which confine or check the natural
progress of this multiplication? And the answer which
first presents itself to the thoughts of the enquirer is,
that the population of a country must stop when the
country can maintain no more, that is, when the inhabi∣tants
are already so numerous as to exhaust all the pro∣vision
which the soil can be made to produce. This how∣ever,
though an insuperable bar, will seldom be found to
be <HI>that,</HI> which actually checks the progress of population,
in any country of the world; because the number of the
people have seldom, in any country, arrived at this limit, or
even approached to it. The fertility of the ground, in tem∣perate
regions, is capable of being improved by cultivation
to an extent which is unknown; much, however, beyond
the state of improvement in any country in Europe. In
our own, which holds almost the first place in the know∣ledge
and encouragement of agriculture, let it only be
supposed that every field in England of the same
original
<PB N="591" REF="631"/>
quality with these in the neighbourhood of the metro∣polis,
and consequently capable of the same fertility,
were by a like management made to yield, an equal pro∣duce,
and it may be asserted, I believe, with truth, that
the quantity of human provision, raised in the island,
would be increased, fivefold. The two principles, there∣fore,
upon which population seems primarily to depend,
the fecundity of the species, and the capacity of the soil,
would in most, perhaps in all countries, enable it to pro∣ceed
much farther than it has yet advanced. The num∣ber
of marriageable women, who, in each country,
remain unmarried, afford, a computation how much the
agency of nature in the diffusion of human life is cramped
and contracted; and the quantity of waste, neglected,
or mismanaged surface, together with a comparison, like
the preceding, of the crops raised from the soil in the
neighbourhood of populous cities, and under a perfect
state of cultivation, with those, which lands of equal or
superior quality yield in different situations, will show, in
what proportion the indigenous productions of the earth
are capable of being farther augmented.</P>
<P>The fundamental proposition upon the subject of popu∣lation,
which must guide every endeavour to improve it,
and from which every conclusion concerning it may be
deduced, is this: “Whererever the commerce between
the sexes is regulated by marriage, and a provision for that
mode of subsistence, to which each class of the commu∣nity
is accustomed, can be procured with ease and cer∣tainty,
<PB N="592" REF="632"/>
there the numbers of the people will increase;
and the rapidity, as well as the extent of the increase
will be proportioned to the degree in which these causes
exist.”</P>
<P>This proposition we will draw out into the several prin∣ciples
which it contains.</P>
<P>I. First, the proposition asserts the “necessity of con∣fining
the intercourse of the sexes to the marriage union.”
It is only in the marriage union that this intercourse is
sufficiently prolific. Beside which, family establishments
alone are fitted to perpetuate a succession of generations.
The offspring of a vague and promiscuous concubinage are
not only few, and liable to perish by neglect, but are seldom
prepared for, or introduced into situations suited to the
raising of families of their own. Now, nature in the
constitution, of the sexes has provided a stimulus, which
will infallibly secure the frequency of marriages, with all
their beneficial effects upon the state of population, pro∣vided
the male part of the species be prohibited from
irregular gratifications. This impulse, which is sufficient
to surmount almost every impediment to marriage, will
operate in proportion to the difficulty, expence, danger,
or infamy, the sense of guilt, or the fear of punishment,
which attend licentious indulgences. Wherefore, in
countries where subsistence is become scarce, it behoves
the state to watch over the public morals with increased
<PB N="593" REF="633"/>
solicitude; for nothing but the instinct of nature, under
the restraint of chastity, will induce men to undertake the
labour, or consent to that sacrifice of personal liberty and
indulgence, which the support of a family, in such cir∣cumstances,
requires.</P>
<P>II. The second requisite which the proposition states,
as necessary to the success of population, is, “The ease
and certainty with which a provision can be procured for
that mode of subsistence to which each class of the com∣munity
is accustomed.” It is not enough that men's
<HI>natural</HI> wants be supplied, that a provision adequate
to the actual necessities of human life be attainable: ha∣bitual
superfluities become real wants; opinion and fashion
convert articles of ornament and luxury into necessaries of
life. And it must not be expected from men in general,
at least in the present relaxed state of morals and discipline,
that they will enter into marriages which degrade their
condition, reduce their mode of living, deprive them of
the accommodations to which they have been accustomed,
or even of those ornaments or appendages of rank and
station, which they have been taught to regard as be∣longing
to their birth, or class, or profession, or place in
society. The same consideration, namely, a view to
their <HI>accustomed</HI> mode of life, which is so apparent in the
superior orders of the people, has no less influence
upon those ranks which compose the mass of the
community. The kind and quality of food and liquor,
the species of habitation, furniture and cloathing, to
<PB N="594" REF="634"/>
which the common people of each country are habituated,
must be attainable with ease and certainty before mar∣riages
will be sufficiently early and general, to carry the
progress of population to its just extent. It is in vain to
alledge, that a more simple diet, ruder habitations, or
coarser apparel, would be sufficient for the purposes of
life and health, or even of physical ease and pleasure.
Men will not marry with this encouragement. For
instance, when the common people of a country are
accustomed to eat a large proportion of animal food, to
drink wine, spirits, or beer, to wear shoes and stock∣ings,
to dwell in stone houses, they will not marry to
live in clay cottages, upon roots and milk, with no other
cloathing than skins, or what is necessary to defend the
trunk of the body from the effects of cold, although
these last may be all that the sustentation of life and
health requires, or that even contribute much to animal
comfort and enjoyment.</P>
<P>The ease then, and certainty, with which the means
can be procured, not barely of subsistence, but of that
mode of subsisting, which custom hath in each country
established, form the point upon which the state and
progress of population chiefly depend. Now, there are
three causes which evidently regulate this point. The
mode itself of subsisting which prevails in the country;
the quantity of provision suited to that mode of subsist∣ence,
which is either raised in the country, or imported
into it; and lastly, the distribution of that provision.</P>
<P><PB N="595" REF="635"/>
These three causes merit distinct considerations.</P>
<P>I. The mode of livings which actually obtains in a
country. In China, where the inhabitants frequent
the sea shore, and subsist, in a great measure, upon fish,
the population is described to be excessive. This pecu∣liarity
arises, not probably from any civil advantages,
any care or policy, any particular constitution, or supe∣rior
wisdom of government, but simply from hence, that
the species of food, to which custom hath reconciled the
desires and inclinations of the inhabitants, is that which,
of all others, is procured in the greatest abundance, with
the most ease, and requires the least preparation. The
natives of Indostan, being confined by the laws of their
religion, to the use of vegetable food, and requiring little
except rice, which the country produces in plentiful
crops; and food, in warm climates, composing the only
want of life; these countries are populous, under all
the injuries of a despotic, and the agitations of an unset∣tled
government. If any revolution, or what would be
called perhaps refinement of manners, should generate
in these people a taste for the flesh of animals, similar to
what prevails amongst the Arabian hordes; should intro∣duce
flocks and herds into grounds which are now covered
with corn; should teach them to account a certain portion
of this species of food amongst the necessaries of life;
the population, from this single change, would suffer in a
few years a great diminution: and this diminution would
follow, in spite of every effort of the laws, or even of any
<PB N="596" REF="636"/>
improvement that might take place in their civil condition.
In Ireland, the simplicity of living alone maintains a
considerable degree of population, under great defects of
police, industry and commerce.</P>
<P>Under this head, and from a view of these considera∣tions,
may be understood the true evil and proper danger
of <HI>luxury.</HI> Luxury, as it quickens circulation, as it
supplies employment and promotes industry, assists po∣pulation.
But then, there is another consequence attend∣ing
it, which counteracts, and often overbalances these ad∣vantages.
When, by introducing more superfluities into
general reception, luxury has rendered the usual accom∣modations
of life more expensive, artificial and elaborate,
the difficulty of maintaining a family, conformably with
the established mode of living, becomes greater, and what
each man has to spare from his personal consumption,
proportionably less: the effect of which is, that mar∣riages
grow less frequent, agreeably to the maxim above
laid down, and which must be remembered as the foun∣dation
of all our reasoning upon the subject, that men
will not marry to <HI>sink</HI> their place or condition in society,
or to forego those indulgencies, which their own habits,
or what they observe amongst their equals, have rendered
necessary to their satisfaction. This principle is applicable
to every article of diet and dress, to houses, furniture,
attendance; and this effect will be felt in every class
of the community. For instance, the custom of wear∣ing
broad cloth, and fine linen, repays the shepherd, and
<PB N="597" REF="637"/>
flax-grower, feeds the manufacturer, enriches the mer∣chant,
gives, not only support, but existence to mul∣titudes
of families: hitherto, therefore, the effects are
beneficial: and were these the only effects, such elegancies,
or, if you please to call them so, such luxuries, could
not be too universal. But herein is the mischief, that,
when once fashion hath annexed the use of these articles
of dress to any certain class, to the middling ranks, for
example, of the community, each individual of that rank
finds them to be <HI>necessaries</HI> of life; that is, finds himself
obliged to comply with the example of his equals, and
to maintain that appearance which the custom of society
requires. This obligation creates such a demand upon his
income, and withal adds so much to the cost and burthen
of a family, as to put it out of his power to marry,
with the prospect of continuing his habits, or of main∣taining
his place and situation in the world. We see, in
this description, the cause which induces men to waste
their lives in a barren celibacy; and this cause, which im∣pairs
the very source of population, is justly placed to the account of <HI>luxury.</HI></P>
<P>It appears then, that luxury, considered with a view
to population, acts by two opposite effects; and it seems
probable, that there exists a point in the scale, to which
luxury may ascend, or, in other words, to which the
wants of mankind may be multiplied, with advantage
to the community, and beyond which the prejudicial
effects begin to preponderate. The determination of this
<PB N="598" REF="638"/>
point, though it assume the form of an arithmetical pro∣blem,
depends upon circumstances too numerous, intri∣cate,
and undefined, to admit of a precise solution. How∣ever,
from what has been observed concerning, the ten∣dency
of luxury to diminish marriages, in which tendency,
the evil of it resides, the following general conclusions
may be established.</P>
<P>1st. That, of different kinds of luxury, those are the the
most innocent, which afford employment to the great∣est
number of artists, and manufacturers; or those, in
other words, in which the price of the work bears the
greatest proportion to that of the raw material. Thus,
luxury in dress or furniture is universally preferable to
luxury in eating, because the articles which constitute the
one, are more the production of human art and industry,
than they which supply the other.</P>
<P>2dly. That it is the <HI>diffusion,</HI> rather than the degree of
luxury, which is to be dreaded as a national evil. The
mischief of luxury consists, as we have seen, in the ob∣struction
that it forms to marriage. Now, it is only a
small part of the people that, the higher ranks in any
country compose; for which reason, the facility or the
difficulty of supporting the expense of <HI>their</HI> station, and
the consequent increase or diminution of marriages
amongst <HI>them,</HI> will influence the state of population but
little. So long as the prevalency of luxury is confined
to a few of elevated rank, much of the benefit is felt,
<PB N="599" REF="639"/>
and little of the inconveniency. But when the imitation of
the same manners descends, as it always will do, into the
mass of the people; when it advances the requisites of
living beyond what it adds to men's abilities to purchase
them, then it is, that luxury checks the formation
of families, in a degree that ought to alarm the public
fears.</P>
<P>3dly. That the condition most favourable to popula∣tion
is that of a laborious frugal people, ministring to
the demands of an opulent, luxurious nation; because
this situation, whilst it leaves them every advantage of
luxury, exempts them from the evils which naturally ac∣company
its admission into any country.</P>
<P>II. Next to the mode of living, we are to consider
“The quantity of provision suited to that mode, which
is either raised in the country, or imported into it;”—for
this is the order in which we assigned the causes of popu∣lation,
and undertook to treat of them. Now, if we mea∣sure
the quantity of provision by the number of human
bodies it will support in due health and vigour, this quan∣tity,
the extent and quality of the soil, out of which it is
raised, being given, will depend greatly upon the <HI>kind.</HI> For
instance, a piece of ground capable of supplying animal food
sufficient for the subsistence of ten persons, would sustain,
at least, the double of that number with grain, roots, and
milk. The first resource of savage life, is in the flesh of
wild animals; hence the numbers amongst savage nations,
<PB N="600" REF="640"/>
compared with the track of country which they occupy,
are universally small, because this species of provision
is, of all others, supplied in the slenderest proportion.
The next step was the invention of pasturage, or the rear∣ing
of flocks and herds of tame animals. This alteration
added to the stock of provision greatly: but the last
and principal improvement was to follow, namely, tillage,
or the artificial production of corn, esculent plants,
and roots. This discovery, whilst it changed the qua∣lity
of human food, augmented the quantity in a vast
proportion. So far as the state of population is governed
and limited by the quantity of provision, perhaps, there
is no single cause that affects it so powerfully, as the kind,
and quality of food, which chance or usage hath intro∣duced
into a country. In England, notwithstanding the
produce of the soil has been, of late, considerably in∣creased,
by the inclosure of wastes, and the adoption, in
many places, of a more successful husbandry, yet, we do
not observe a corresponding addition to the number of
inhabitants; the reason of which appears to me to be,
the more general consumption of animal food amongst
us. Many ranks of people, whose ordinary diet was,
in the last century, prepared almost entirely from milk,
roots, and vegetables, now require every day a conside∣rable
portion of the flesh of animals. Hence, a great part
of the richest lands of the country are converted to
pasturage. Much also of the bread corn, which went
directly to the nourishment of human bodies, now only
contributes to it, by fattening the flesh of sheep and
<PB N="601" REF="641"/>
oxen. The mass and volume of provisions are hereby
diminished; and what is gained in the melioration of the
soil is lost in the quality of the produce. This conside∣ration
teaches us, that tillage, as an object of national
care and encouragement, is universally preferable to pas∣turage;
because, the <HI>kind</HI> of provision, which it yields,
goes much farther in the sustentation of human life.
Tillage is also recommended by this additional advantage,
that it affords employment to a much more numerous
peasantry. Indeed, pasturage seems to be the art of a
nation, either imperfectly civilized, as are many of the
tribes, which cultivate it, in the internal parts of Asia;
or of a nation, like Spain, declining from its summit by
luxury and inactivity.</P>
<P>The kind and quality of the provision, together with
the extent and capacity of the soil, from which it is raised,
being the same; the quantity procured will principally
depend upon two circumstances, the <HI>ability</HI> of the occupier,
and the <HI>encouragement</HI> which he receives. The greatest
misfortune of a country is an indigent tenantry. What∣ever
be the native advantages of the soil, or even the skill
and industry of the occupier, the want of a sufficient
capital confines every plan, as well as cripples and wea∣kens
every operation of husbandry. This evil is felt,
where agriculture is accounted a servile, or mean employ∣ment;
where farms are extremely subdivided, and badly
furnished with habitations; where leases are unknown,
or are of short or precarious duration. With respect to the
<PB N="602" REF="642"/>
<HI>encouragement</HI> of husbandry; in this, as in every other
employment, the true reward of industry is in the price
and sale of the produce. The exclusive right to the pro∣duce
is the only incitement which acts constantly and
universally; the only spring which keeps human labour
in motion. All, therefore, that the laws can do, is, to
secure this right to the occupier of the ground, that is,
to constitute such a system of tenure, that the full and
entire advantage of every improvement go to the benefit
of the improver; that, every man work for himself, and
not for another; and that no one share in the profit who
does not assist in the production. By the <HI>occupier</HI> I here
mean not so much the person who performs the work, as
him, who directs the management, and procures the
labour: and I consider the whole profit as <HI>received</HI> by the
occupier, when the occupier is benefited by the whole
value of what is produced,, which is the case with the
tenant who pays a fixed rent for the use of land, no less
than with the proprietor who holds it as his own. The one
has the same interest in the produce, and in the advantage
of every improvement, as the other. Likewise the pro∣prietor,
though he grant out his estate to farm, may
be considered as the <HI>occupier,</HI> insomuch as he regulates
the occupation by the choice, superintendency, and
encouragement of his tenants, by the disposition of
his lands, by erecting buildings, providing accommoda∣tions,
by prescribing conditions, or supplying imple∣ments
and materials of improvement; and is entitled,
by the rule of public expediency above mentioned, to
<PB N="603" REF="643"/>
receive, in the advance of his rent, a share of the
benefit which arises from the increased produce of
his estate. The violation of this fundamental maxim of
agrarian policy constitutes the chief objection to the hold∣ing
of lands by the state; by-the king; by corporate
bodies; by private persons in right of their offices or
benefices. The inconveniency to the public arises not so
much from the unalienable quality of lands thus holden
in perpetuity, as from hence, that proprietors of this
description, seldom contribute much either of attention
or expence to the cultivation of their estates, yet claim,
by the rent, a share in the profit of every improvement
that is made upon them. This complaint can only be
obviated by long leases at a fixed rent, which convey a
large portion of the interest to those who actually conduct
the cultivation. The same objection is applicable to the
holding of lands by foreign proprietors, and in some de∣gree,
to estates of too great extent being placed in the
same hands.</P>
<P>III. Beside the <HI>production</HI> of provision, there remains to
be considered the DISTRIBUTION.—It is in vain, that
provisions abound in the country, unless I be able to ob∣tain
a share of them. This reflection belongs to every
individual. The plenty of provision produced, the quan∣tity,
of the public stock, affords subsistence to individuals,
and encouragement to the formation of families, only in
proportion as it is <HI>distributed,</HI> that is, in proportion as
these individuals are allowed to draw from it a supply of
<PB N="604" REF="644"/>
their own wants. The <HI>distribution,</HI> therefore, becomes of equal
consequence to population with the <HI>production.</HI> Now, there
is but one principle of distribution that can ever become uni∣versal,
namely, the “principle of exchange;” or, in other
words, that every man have something to give in return
for what he wants. Bounty, however it may come in
aid of another principle, however it may occasionally qua∣lify
the rigour, or supply the imperfection of an established
rule of distribution, can never itself become that rule
or principle; because men will not work to give the pro∣duce
of their labour away. Moreover the only equivalents
that can be offered in exchange for provision are <HI>power</HI> and
<HI>labour.</HI> All property is <HI>power.</HI> What we call property
in land, is the <HI>power</HI> to use it, and to exclude others from
the use. Money is the representative of <HI>power,</HI> because
it is convertible into power; the value of it consists in
its faculty of procuring <HI>power</HI> over things and persons.
But <HI>power</HI> which results from civil conventions, and of
this kind are what we call a man's fortune or estate, is
necessarily confined to a few, and is withal, soon exhaust∣ed:
whereas the capacity of <HI>labour</HI> is every man's natural
possession, and composes a constant and renewing fund.
The hire, therefore, or produce of personal industry is
that, which, the bulk of every community must bring to
market, in exchange for the means of subsistence; in
other words, employment must, in every country, be
the medium of distribution, and the source of supply to
individuals. But when we consider the <HI>production</HI> and <HI>dis∣tribution</HI>
of provision, as distinct from, and independent
<PB N="605" REF="645"/>
of each other; when supposing the same quantity to be
produced, we enquire in what way, or according to what
rule, it may be <HI>distributed,</HI> we are led to a conception of
the subject not at all agreeable to truth and reality; for,
in truth and reality, though provision must be produced,
before it be distributed, yet the production depends, in a
great measure, upon the distribution. The quantity of
provision raised out of the ground, so far as the raising
of it requires human art or labour, will evidently be
regulated by the demand—the demand, or, in other
words; the price and sale, being that which alone rewards
the care, or excites the diligence of the husbandman.
But the sale of provision depends upon the number,
not of those who want, but of those who have some∣thing
to offer in return for what they want; not of those
who would consume, but of those who can buy; that
is, upon the number of those who have the fruits of some
other kind of industry, to tender in exchange for what they
stand in need of from the productions of the soil.</P>
<P>We see, therefore, the connection between population
and <HI>employment.</HI> Employment affects population
“di∣rectly,”
as it affords the only medium of distribution, by
which individuals can obtain from the common stock a
supply for the wants of their families: it affects popula∣lation
“indirectly,” as it augments the stock itself of
provision, in the only way by which the production of it
can be effectually encouraged, by furnishing purchasers,
No man can purchase without an equivalent, and that
<PB N="606" REF="646"/>
equivalent, by the generality of the people, must, in
every country, be derived from employment.</P>
<P>And upon this basis is founded the public benefit of
<HI>trade,</HI> that is to say, its subserviency to population, in
which its only real utility consits. Of that industry,
and of those arts and branches of trade, which are em∣ployed
in the production, conveyance, and preparation
of any principal species of human food, as of the busi∣ness
of the husbandman, the butcher, baker, brewer,
corn-merchant, &amp;c. we acknowledge the necessity: like∣wise
of those manufactures, which furnish us with warm
cloathing, convenient habitations, domestic utensils, as
of the weaver, taylor, smith, carpenter, &amp;c. we per∣ceive,
(in climates, however, like ours, removed at a
distance from the sun,) the conduciveness to popula∣tion,
by their rendering human life more healthy, vigorous,
and comfortable. But not one half of the occupations,
which compose the trade of Europe, fail within either of
these descriptions. Perhaps, two thirds of the manu∣facturers
of England are employed upon articles of con∣fessed
luxury, ornament, or splendor; in the superfluous
embellishment of some articles which are useful in their
kind, or upon others which have no conceivable use or
value, but what is founded in caprice, or fashion. What
can be less necessary, or less connected with the sustentation
of human life, than the whole produce of the silk, lace,
and plate manufactory? yet, what multitudes labour in
the different branches of these arts! What can be ima∣gined
<PB N="607" REF="647"/>
gined more capricious than the fondness for tobacco and
snuff? yet, how many various occupations, and how
many thousands in each, are set at work, in admini∣string
to this frivolous gratification! Concerning trades of
this kind, and this kind comprehends more than half
of the trades that are exercised, it may fairly be asked
“how, since they add nothing to the stock of provision,
do they tend to encrease the number of the people.” We
are taught to say of trade, “that it maintains multitudes;”
but by what means does it <HI>maintain</HI> them, when it
produces nothing upon which the support of human
life depends?—In like manner, with respect to foreign
commerce; of that merchandise which brings the neces∣saries
of life into a country, which imports, for example,
corn, or cattle, or cloth, or fuel, we allow the ten∣dency
to advance population, because it increases the
stock, of provision, by which the people are subsisted.
But this is so little the effect of foreign commerce in our
own country, that, I believe, it may be affirmed of
Great Britain, what Bishop, <HI>Berkley,</HI> said of a neighbour∣ing
island, that if it was encompassed with a wall of brass
fifty cubits high, the country might maintain the same
number of inhabitants, that find subsistence in it at present;
and that every necessary, and even every real comfort and
accommodation of human life might be supplied in as great
abundance as they are now. Here, therefore, as before,
we may fairly ask, by what operation it is, that foreign
commerce, which brings into the country no one article of
<PB N="608" REF="648"/>
human subsistence, promotes the multiplication of hu∣man
life?</P>
<P>The answer to this enquiry will be contained in the
discussion of another; viz.</P>
<P>Since the soil will maintain many more than it can
employ, what must be done, supposing the country to be
full, with the remainder of the inhabitants. They, who,
by the rules of partition, (and some such must be esta∣blished
in every country,) are entitled to the land; and
they who, by their labour upon the soil, acquire a right
in its produce, will not part with their property for no∣thing;
or rather, they will no longer raise from the soil
what they can neither use themselves, nor exchange for
what they want. Or, lastly, if these were willing to
distribute what they could spare of the provision, which
the ground yielded, to others, who had no share or con∣cern
in the property or cultivation of it, yet, still, the
most enormous mischiefs would ensue from great numbers
remaining unemployed. The idleness of one half of the
community would overwhelm the whole with confusion
and disorder. One only way presents itself of removing
the difficulty which this question states, and which is
simply this; that they, whose work is not wanted,
nor can be employed in the raising of provision out
of the ground, convert their hands and ingenuity to the
fabrication of articles, which may gratify, and requite
those who are so employed; or who, by the division of
<PB N="609" REF="649"/>
lands in the country, are entitled to the exclusive pos∣session of
certain parts of them. By this contrivance
all things proceed well. The occupier of the ground
raises from it the utmost he can procure, because he is
repaid for what he can spare by something else, which he
wants, or with which he is pleased: the artist and manu∣facturer,
though he have neither any property in the soil,
nor any concern in its cultivation, is regularly supplied
with the produce, because he gives, in exchange for what
he stands in need of, something, upon which the receiver
places an equal value: and the community is kept quiet,
whilst both sides are engaged in their respective occupations.</P>
<P>It appears then, that the business of one half of
mankind is, to set the other half at work; that is, to pro∣vide
articles, which, by tempting the desires, may stimu∣mulate
the industry, and call forth the activity of those,
upon the exertion of whose industry, and the application
of whose faculties, the production of human provision de∣pends.
A certain portion only of human labour is, or can be
<HI>productive;</HI> the rest is <HI>instrumental</HI>—both equally necessary,
tho' the one have no other object than to excite the other.
It appears, also, that it signifies nothing as to the main
purpose of trade, how superfluous the articles which it
furnishes are; whether the want of them be real or ima∣ginary,
founded in nature, or in opinion, in fashion, ha∣bit,
or emulation: it is enough that they be actually de∣sired
and sought after. Flourishing cities are raised and
supported by trading in tobacco: populous towns subsist
by the manufactory of ribbons. A watch may be a very
<PB N="610" REF="650"/>
unnecessary appendage to the dress of a peasant: yet if the
peasant will till the ground in order to obtain a watch,
the true design of trade is answered; and the watch∣maker,
whilst he polishes the case, or files the wheels of
his machine, is contributing to the production of corn as
effectually, tho' not so directly, as if he handled the
spade, or held the plough. The use of tobacco has been
mentioned already as an acknowledged superfluity, and
as affording a remarkable example of the caprice
of human appetites: yet, if the fisherman will ply his
nets, or the mariner fetch rice from foreign countries, in
order to procure to himself this indulgence, the market is
supplied with two important articles of provision, by the
instrumentality of a merchandise, which has no other
apparent use, than, the gratification of a vitiated palate.</P>
<P>But it may come to pass, that the husbandman, or
whoever he be, that is entitled to the produce of the
soil, will no longer exchange it for what the manufac∣turer
offers. He is already supplied to the extent of
his desires. For instance, he wants no more cloth; he
will no longer therefore give the weaver corn, in return
for the produce of his looms; but he would readily
give it for tea or for wine. When the weaver finds this to
be the case, he has nothing to do but to send his cloth
abroad in exchange for tea or for wine, which he may
barter for that provision, which the offer of his cloth
will no longer procure. The circulation is thus revived;
and the benefit, of the alteration is, that whereas the
<PB N="611" REF="651"/>
number of weavers, who could find subsistence from
their employment, was before limited by the consump∣tion
of cloth in the country, that number is now aug∣mented,
in proportion to the demand for tea and for
wine. This is the principle of <HI>foreign</HI> commerce. In
the magnitude and complexity of the machine, the prin∣ciple
of motion is sometimes lost of unobserved; but it
is always simple and the same, to whatever extent it may
be diversified and enlarged in its operations.</P>
<P>The effect of trade upon agriculture, the process of
which we have been endeavouring to describe, is visible
in the neighbourhood of trading towns, and in those
districts which carry on a communication with the mar∣kets
of trading towns. The husbandmen are busy and
skilful; the peasantry laborious; the lands are managed
to the best advantage, and double the quantity of corn or
herbage, (articles which are ultimately converted into
human provision,) raised from it, of what the same soil
yields in remoter and more neglected parts of the coun∣try.
Wherever a thriving manufactory finds means to
establish itself, a aew vegetation springs up around it.
I believe it is true that agriculture never arrives at any
considerable, much less at its highest degree of perfec∣tion,
where it is not connected with trade, that is, where
the demand for the produce is not increased by the con∣sumption
of trading cities. <HI>Let</HI> it be remembered then,
that agriculture is the immediate source of human pro∣vision;
that trade conduces to the production of provision
<PB N="612" REF="652"/>
only as it promotes agriculture; that the whole system of
commerce, vast and various as it is, hath no other public
importance than its subserviency to this end.</P>
<P>We return to the proportion we laid down; “that
employment universally promotes population.” From
this proportion it follows, that the comparative utility
of different branches of national commerce is measured
by the number which each branch <HI>employs.</HI> Upon which
principle a scale may easily be constructed, which shall
assign to the several kinds and divisions of foreign trade,
their respective degrees of public importance. In this
scale the <HI>first</HI> place belongs to the exchange of wrought
goods for raw materials, as of broad cloth for raw silk;
cutlery for wool; clocks or watches for iron, flax, or
furs; because this traffic provides a market for the
labour that has already been expended, at the same time
that it supplies materials for new industry. Population
always flourishes where this species of commerce obtains
to any considerable degree. It is the cause of employment,
or the certain indication. As it takes off the manufac∣tures
of the country, it promotes employment; as it brings
in raw materials, it supposes the exrstence of manufac∣tories
in the country, and a demand for the article when
manufactured. The <HI>second</HI> place is due to that com∣merce,
which barters one species of wrought goods for
another, as stuffs for calicoes, sustians for cambrics,
leather for paper; or wrought goods for articles which
require no farther preparation, as for wine, oil, tea, sugar,
<PB N="613" REF="653"/>
&amp;c. This also assists employment, because when the
country is stocked with one kind of manufacture, it re∣news
the demand by converting it into another; but it
is inferior to the former, as it promotes this end by one
side only of the bargain—by what it carries out. The
<HI>last,</HI> the lowest, and most disadvantageous species of com∣merce,
is the exportation of raw materials in return for
wrought goods; as when wool is sent abroad to purchase
velvets; hides or peltry to procure shoes, hats, or linen
cloth. This trade is unfavourable to population, because
it leaves no room or demand for employment, either in
what it carries out of the country, or in what it brings
into it. Its operation on both sides is noxious. By its ex∣ports
it diminishes the very subject upon which the indus∣try
of the inhabitants ought to be exercised; by its imports
it lessens the encouragement of that industry, in the same
proportion that it supplies the consumption of the country
with the produce of foreign labour. Of different bran∣ches
of manufactory, those are, in their nature, the most
beneficial, in which the price of the wrought article ex∣ceeds
in the highest proportion that of the raw material;
for this excess measures the quantity of employment, or;
in other words, the number of manufacturers which each
branch sustains. The produce of the ground is never the
most advantageous article of foreign commerce. Under a
perfect state of public oeconomy, the soil of the country
should be applied solely to the raising of provision for the
inhabitants, and its trade be supplied by their industry.
A nation will never reach its proper extent of population,
<PB N="614" REF="654"/>
so long as its principal commerce consists in the exporta∣tion
of corn or cattle; or even of wine, oil, tobacco,
madder, indigo, timber; because these last articles take
up that surface, which ought to be covered with the ma∣terials
of human subsistence.</P>
<P>It must be here however noticed, that we have all along
considered the inhabitants of a country as maintained by
the produce of the country; and that what we have said
is applicable with strictness to this supposition alone.
The reasoning, nevertheless, may easily be adapted to a
different case; for when provision is not produced, but
imported, what has been affirmed concerning provision,
will be, in a great measure, true of that article, whether
it be money, produce, or labour, which is exchanged for
provision. Thus when the Dutch raise madder, and
exchange it for corn; or when the people of America
plant tobacco, and send it to Europe for cloth; the culti∣vation
of madder and tobacco become as necessary to the
subsistence of the inhabitants, and, by consequence, will
affect the state of population in these countries, as sensibly
as the actual production of food, or the manufactory of
raiment. In like manner, when the same inhabitants of
Holland earn money by the carriage of the produce of
one country to another, and with that money purchase the
provision from abroad, which their own land is not
extensive enough to supply, the increase or decline of
this trade will influence the numbers of the people no
<PB N="615" REF="655"/>
less than similar changes would do in the cultivation of
the soil.</P>
<P>The few principles already established will enable us
to describe the effects, upon population, which may be
expected from the following important parts of national
practice and oeconomy.</P>
<P>I. EMIGRATION. <HI>Emigration</HI> may be either the over∣flowing
of a country, or the desertion. As the increase of
the species is indefinite, and the number of inhabitants,
which any given tract of surface can support, finite, it is
evident that great numbers may be constantly leaving
the country, and yet the country remain constantly full.
Or whatever be the cause which invincibly limits the
population of a country, when the number of the people
have arrived at that limit, the progress of generation,
beside continuing the succession, will supply multitudes
for foreign emigration. In these two cases, emigration
neither indicates any political decay; nor, in truth,
diminishes the number of the people; nor ought to be
prohibited or discouraged. But emigrants may relinquish
their country from a sense of insecurity, oppression,
annoyance and inconveniency. Neither, again, here is it
emigration which wastes the people, but the evils that
occasion it. It would be in vain, if it were practicable,
to confine the inhabitants at home; for the same causes
which drive them out of the country, would prevent
their multiplication if they remained in it. Lastly, men
<PB N="616" REF="656"/>
may be tempted to change their situation by the allure∣ment
of a better climate, a more refined or luxurious
manner of living, by the prospect of wealth, or, some∣times,
by the mere nominal advantage of higher wages
and prices. This class of emigrants, with whom alone
the laws can interfere with effect, will never, I think,
be numerous. With the generality of a people, the
attachment of mankind to their homes and country, the
irksomeness of seeking new habitations, and of living
amongst strangers, will outweigh, so long as men possess
the necessaries of life in safety, or, at least, so long as
they can obtain a provision for that mode of subsistence,
which the class of citizens, to which they belong, are
accustomed to enjoy, all the inducements that the ad∣vantages
of a foreign land can offer. There appear,
therefore, to be few cases in which emigration can be
prohibited with advantage to the state; it appears also
that emigration is an equivocal symptom, which will
probably accompany the decline of the political body,
but which <HI>may</HI> likewise attend a condition of perfect
health and vigour.</P>
<P>II. COLONIZATION. The only view under which our
sobject will permit us to consider <HI>colonization,</HI> is in its
tendency to augment the population of the parent state
Suppose a fertile, but empty island, to lie within the reach
of a country, in which arts and manufactures are already
established: suppose a colony sent out from such a coun∣try
to take possession of the island, and to live there
<PB N="617" REF="657"/>
under the protection and authority of their native govern∣ment;
the new settlers will naturally convert their
labour to the cultivation of the vacant soil, and, with the
produce: of that soil, will draw a supply of manu∣factures
from their countrymen at home. Whilst the
inhabitants continue few, and the lands cheap and fresh,
the colonists will find it easier and more profitable to
raise corn or rear cattle, and with corn and cattle to pur∣chase
woollen cloth, for instance, or linen, than to spin
or weave these articles for themselves. The mother coun∣try,
it is evident, will derive from this connection an
increase both of provision and employment. It pro∣motes
at once the two great requisites, upon which the
facility of subsistence, and, by consequence, the state of
population depends, <HI>production</HI> and <HI>distribution.</HI> And this
in a manner the most direct and beneficial. No situation
can be imagined more favourable to population, than that
of a country which works up goods for others, whilst
these others are cultivating new tracts of land for them.
For as, in a genial climate, and from a fresh soil, the
labour of one man will raise provision enough for ten;
it is manifest that, where all are employed in agriculture,
much the greater part of the produce will be spared from
the consumption; and that three out of four, at least, of
those who are maintained by it, will reside in the coun∣try
which receives the radundancy. When the new
country does not remit <HI>provision</HI> to the old one, the
advantage is less; but still the exportation of wrought
goods, by whatevever return they are paid for, advances
<PB N="618" REF="658"/>
population in that secondary way, in which those trades
promote it that are not employed in the production of
provision. Whatever prejudice, therefore, some late
events have excited against schemes of colonization, the
system itself is founded in apparent national utility, and
what is more, upon principles favourable to the common
interest of human nature: for it does not appear, by
what other method newly discovered and unfrequented
countries can be peopled, or, during the infancy of their
establishment, be protected or supplied. The error which
we of this nation at present lament, seems to have
consisted not so much in the original formation of colonies,
as in the subsequent management, in imposing restractions
too rigorous, or in continuing them too long; in not
perceiving the point of time, when the irresistible order
and progress of human affairs demanded a change of laws
and policy.</P>
<P>III. MONEY. Where <HI>money</HI> abounds the people are gene∣rally
numerous: yet, gold and silver neither feed nor clothe
mankind; nor are they in every country converted into
provision by purchasing the necessaries of life at foreign
markets; nor do they, in any country, compose those
articles of personal or domestic ornament, which certain
orders of the community have learnt to regard as
necessaries of life, and without the means of procuring
which they will not enter into family establishments—at
least, this property of the precious metals obtains in a
very small degree. The effect of money upon the number
<PB N="619" REF="659"/>
of the people, tho' visible to observation, is not explained
without some difficulty. To understand this connection
properly, we must return to the proposition, with which
we concluded our reasoning upon the subject, “that
population is chiefly promoted by employment.” Now
of employment money is partly the indication, and partly
the cause. The only way in which money regularly and
spontaneously <HI>flows into</HI> a country is in return for the
goods that are sent out of it, or the work that is per∣formed
by it; and the only way in which money is
<HI>retained</HI> in country is by the country supplying, in a
great measure, its own consumption of manufactures.
Consequently, the quantity of money found in a country,
denotes the amount of labour and employment: but
still, employment, not money, is the cause of population;
the accumulation of money being merely a collateral
effect of the same cause, or a circumstauce which accom∣panies
the existence, and measures the operation of that
cause. And this is true of money, only whilst it is ac∣quired
by the industry of the inhabitants. The treasures,
which belong to a country by the possession of mines, or
by the exaction of tribute from foreign dependencies, afford
no conclusion concerning the state of population. The
influx from these sources may be immense, and yet the
country remain poor and ill peopled; of which we see
an egregious example in the condition of Spain, since the
acquisition of its South American dominions.</P>
<P>But, secondly, money may become also a real and an oper∣ative
<HI>cause</HI> of population, by acting as a stimulus to industry,
<PB N="620" REF="660"/>
and by facilitating the means of subsistence. The case of
subsestence, and the encouragement of industry, depend
neither upon the price of provision, nor upon the price
of labour, but upon the proportion which the one bears
to the other. Now the influx of money into a country
naturally tends to advance this proportion; that is, every
fresh accession of money raises the price of labour before
it raises the price of provision. When money is brought
from abroad, the persons, be they who they will, into
whose hands it first arrives, do not buy up provision with
it, but apply it to the purchase and payment of labour.
If the state receive it, the state dispenses what it receives
amongst soldiers, sailors, artificers, engineers, ship-wrights,
workmen; if private persons bring home treasures of
gold and silver, they usually expend them in the building
of house, the improvement of estates, the purchase of
furniture, dress, equipage, in articles of luxury or splen∣dour:
if the merchant be enriched by the returns of his
foreign commerce, he applies his increased capital to the
enlargement of his business at home. The money ere∣long
comes to market for provision, but it comes thither
through the hands of the manufacturer, the artist, the
husbandman and labourer. Its effect, therefore, upon the
price of art and labour will <HI>precede</HI> its effect upon the price
of provision; and, during the interval between one effect
and the other, the means of subsistence will be multiplied
and facilitated, as well as industry be excited by new
rewards. When the greater plenty of money in circu∣lation
has produced an advance in the price of provision,
<PB N="621" REF="661"/>
corresponding to the advanced price of labour, its effect
ceases. The labourer no longer gains any thing by the
increase of his wages. It is not, therefore, the quantity
of specie collected into a country, but the continual in∣crease
of that quantity, from which the advantage arises
to employment and population. It is only the <HI>accession</HI>
of money which produces the effect, and it is only by
money constantly flowing into a country, that the effect
can be constant. Now whatever consequence arises to
the country from the influx of money, the contrary may
be expected to follow from the diminution of its quantity;
and accordingly we find, that whatever cause drains off
the specie of a country, faster than the streams, which
feed it, can supply, not only impoverishes the country, but
depopulates it. The knowledge and experience of this
effect has given occasion to a phrase which occurs in
almost every discourse upon commerce or politics. The
<HI>balance of trade</HI> with any foreign nation is said to be
against or in favour of a country simply as it tends to
carry money out or to bring it in; that is, according
as the price of the imports exceeds or falls short of the
price of the exports. So invariably is the increase or
diminution of the specie of a country regarded as a test
of the public advantage or detriment, which arises from
any branch of its commerce.</P>
<P>IV. TAXATION. As <HI>taxes</HI> take nothing but of the
country; as they do not diminish the public stock, only
vary the distribution of it, they are not necessarily preju∣dicial
<PB N="622" REF="662"/>
to population. If the state exact money from
certain members of the community, she dispenses it also
amongst other members of the same community. They
who contribute to the revenue, and they who are sup∣ported
or benefited by the expences of government, are
to be placed one against the other; and whilst what the
subsistence of one part is profited by receiving, compen∣sates
for what that of the other suffers by paying, the
common fund of the society is not lessened. This is
true: but it must be observed that although the sum dis∣tributed
by the state be always <HI>equal</HI> to the sum collected
from the people, yet the gain and loss to the means of
subsistence may be very <HI>unequal;</HI> and the balance will
remain on the wrong or the right side of the account,
according as the money passes by taxation from the
industrious to the idle, from the many to the few,
from those who want to those who abound, or in a
contrary direction. For instance, a tax upon coaches,
to be laid out in the repair of roads, would probably
improve the population of a neighbourhood; a tax upon
cottages to be ultimately expended in the purchase and
support of coaches would certainly diminish it. In like
manner, a tax upon wine or tea, distributed in bounties
to fishermen or husbandmen, would augment the pro∣vision
of a country; a tax upon fisheries and husbandry,
however indirect or concealed, to be converted, when
raised, to the procuring of wine or tea for the idle and
opulent, would naturally impair the public stock. The
effect therefore of taxes upon the means of subsistence
<PB N="623" REF="663"/>
depends not so much upon the amount of the sum levied, as
upon the object of the tax, and the application. Taxes
likewise may be so adjusted as to conduce to the restraint
of luxury, and the correction of vice; to the encourage∣ment
of industry, trade, agriculture and marriage. Taxes
thus contrived become rewards and penalties; not only
sources of revenue, but instruments of police. Vices
indeed themselves cannot be taxed without holding forth
such a conditional toleration of them as to destroy men's
perception of their guilt; but the materials and incen∣tives
of vice may. Although, for instance, drunkenness
would be, on this account, an unfit object of taxation,
yet public-houses and spirituous liquors are very properly
subjected to heavy imposts.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, although it may be true, that taxes can∣not
be pronounced to be detrimental to population, by
any absolute necessity in their nature; and though, under
some modifications, and when urged only to a certain
extent, they may even operate in favour of it; yet it will be found, in a great plurality of the instances, in which they are
imposed, that their tendency is noxious. Let it be supposed
that nine families inhabit a neighbourhood, each possessing
barely the means of subsistence, or of that mode of subsistence
which custom hath established amongst them; let a tenth
family be quartered upon these, to be supported by a
tax raised from the nine; or rather let one of the nine
have his income augmented by a similar deduction from
the incomes of the rest: in either of these cases, it is
<PB N="624" REF="664"/>
evident that the whole district would be broken up. For
as the entire income of each is supposed to be barely suffi∣cient
for the establishment which it maintains, a deduction
of any part destroys that establishment. Now it is no
answer to this objection, it is no apology for the grievance,
to say, that nothing is taken out of the neighbourhood;
that the common stock is not diminished. The mis∣chief
is done by deranging the distribution. Nor, again,
is the luxury of one family, or even the maintenance of
an additional family, a recompence to the country for
the ruin of nine others. Nor, lastly, will it alter the
effect, though it may conceal the cause, that the contri∣bution,
instead of being levied directly upon each day's
wages, is mixed up in the price of some article of
constant use and consumption; as in a tax upon candles,
malt, leather, or fuel. This example illustrates the
tendency of taxes to obstruct subsistence; and the mi∣nutest
degree of this obstruction will be felt in the
formation of families. The example indeed forms an
extreme case: the evil is magnified, in order to ren∣der
its operation distinct and visible. In real life,
families may not be broken up, or forced from their ha∣bitation,
houses be quitted, or countries suddenly de∣serted,
in consequence of any new imposition whatever;
but marriages will become gradually less frequent.</P>
<P>It seems necessary however to distinguish between the
operation of a new tax, and the effect of taxes which
have been long established. In the course of circulation
the money may flow back to the hands from which it
<PB N="625" REF="665"/>
was taken. The proportion between the supply and the
expence of subsistence, which had been disturbed by the
tax, may at length recover itself again. In the instance
just now stated, the addition, of a tenth family to the
neighbourhood, or the enlarged expences of one of the
nine, may, in some shape or other, so advance the profits,
or increase the employment of the rest, as to make full
restitution for the share of their property, of which it
deprives them: or, what is more likely to happen, a
reduction may take place in their mode of living, suited
to the abridgment of their incomes. Yet still the ulti∣mate
and permanent effect of taxation, tho' distinguish∣able
from the impression of a new tax, is generally adverse
to population. The <HI>proportion</HI> above spoken of, can only
be restored by one side or other of this alternative; by
the people either contracting their wants, which at the
same time diminishes consumption and employment; or
by raising the price of labour, which necessarily adding
to the price of the productions and manufactures of the
country, checks their sale at foreign markets. A nation,
which is burthened with taxes, must always be undersold
by a nation which is free from them, unless the difference
be made up by some singular advantage of climate, soil,
skill, or industry. This quality belongs to all taxes,
which affect the mass of the community, even when
imposed upon the properest objects, and applied to the
fairest purposes. But abuses are inseparable from
the disposal of public money. As government is usually
administred, the produce of public taxes is expended upon
<PB N="624" REF="666"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="625" REF="667"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="626" REF="668"/>
a train of gentry, in the maintaining of pomp, or in the
purchase of influence. The conversion of property, which
taxes effectuate, when they are employed in this manner,
is attended with obvious evils. It takes from the in∣dustrious
to give to the idle; it increases the number of
the latter; it tends to accumulation; it sacrifices the
conveniency of many to the luxury of a few; it makes
no return to the people, from whom the tax is drawn,
that is satisfactory or intelligible; it encourages no acti∣vity
that is useful or productive.</P>
<P>The sum to be raised being settled, a wise statesman will
contrive his taxes principally with a view to their effect
upon <HI>population,</HI> that is, he will so adjust them, as to give
the least possible obstruction to those means of subsistence
by which the mass of the community are actually
maintained. We are accustomed to an opinion that a
tax, to be just, ought to be accurately proportioned to
the circumstances of the persons who pay it. But upon
what, it might be asked; is this opinion founded; unless it
could be shown that such a proportion interferes the least
with the general conveniency of subsistence: whereas I
should rather believe, that a tax, constructed with a view
to that conveniency, ought to rise upon the different
classes of the community, in a much higher ratio than
the simple proportion of their incomes. The point to
be regarded, is not what men have, but what they can
spare; and it is evident that a man, who possesses a thou∣sand
pounds a year, can more easily give up a hundred,
<PB N="627" REF="669"/>
than a man with a hundred pounds a year can part with
ten; that is, those habits of life which are reasonable
and innocent, and upon the ability to continue which
the formation of families depends, will be much less
affected by the one deduction than the other: it is still
more evident, that a man of a hundred pounds a year
would not be so much distressed in his subsistence, by a
demand from him often pounds, as a man of ten pounds
a year would be by the loss of one: to which we must
add, that the population of every country being reple∣nished
by the marriages of the lowest ranks of the
society, their accommodation and relief becomes of more
importance to the state, than the conveniency of any
higher but less numerous order of its citizens. But
whatever be the proportion which public expediency
directs, whether the simple the duplicate, or any higher
or intermediate proportion of men's incomes, it can
never be attained by any <HI>single</HI> tax; as no single object
of taxation can be found, which measures the ability of
the subject with sufficient generality and exactness. It
is only by a system and variety of taxes, mutually ba∣lancing
and equalising one another, that a due propor∣tion
can be preserved. For instance, if a tax upon lands
press with greater hardship upon those who live in the
country, it may be properly counterpoised by a tax upon
the rent of houses, which will affect principally the in∣habitants
of great towns. Distinctions may also be framed
in some taxes, which shall allow abatements or exemp∣tions
to married persons; to improvers of the soil; to
<PB N="628" REF="670"/>
particular modes of cultivation, as to tillage in preference
to pasturage; and in general to that industry which
is immediately <HI>productive,</HI> in preference to that which is
only <HI>instrumental;</HI> but above all, which may leave the
heaviest part of the burthen upon the methods, whatever
they be, of acquiring wealth without industry, or even,
of subsisting in idleness</P>
<P>V. EXPORTATION OF BREAD-CORN. Nothing seems to
have a more positive tendency to reduce the number of the
people, than the sending abroad part of the provision by
which they are maintained; yet this has been the policy
of legislators very studious of the improvement of their
country. In order to reconcile ourselves to a practice,
which appears to militate with the chief interest, that is,
with the population of the country that adopts it, we
must be reminded of a maxim which belongs to the pro∣ductions
both of nature and art, “that it is impossible
to have enough without a superfluity.” The point of
sufficiency cannot, in any case, be so exactly hit upon,
as to have nothing to spare, yet never to want. This
is peculiarly true of bread-corn, of which the annual
increase is extremely variable. As it is necessary that
the crop be adequate to the consumption in a year of
scarcity, it must, of consequence, greatly exceed it in a
year of plenty. A redundancy therefore will occasionally
arise from the very care that is taken to secure the people
against the danger of want; and it is manifest that the
exportation of this redundancy subtracts nothing from
<PB N="629" REF="671"/>
the number that can regularly be maintained by the
produce of the soil. Moreover, as the exportation
of corn, under these circumstances, is attended with
no direct injury to population, so the benefits, which
indirectly arise to it from foreign commerce, belong
to this in common with other species of trade; together
with the peculiar advantage of presenting a costant in∣citement
to the skill and industry of the husbandman, by
the promise of a certain sale and an adequate price, under
every contingency of season and produce. There is ano∣ther
situation, in which corn may not only be exported;
but in which the people can thrive by no other means;
that is, of a newly settled country, with a fertile soil. The
exportation of a large proportion of the corn which a
country produces, proves, it is true, that the inhabitants
have not yet attained to the number which the country
is capable of maintaining; but it does not prove but they
may be hastening to this limit with the utmost practi∣cable
celerity, which is the perfection to be sought for in
a young establishment. In all cases except these two,
and in the former of them to any greater degree than
what is necessary to take off occasional redundancies, the
exportation of corn is either itself noxious to population,
or argues a defect of population arising srom some other cause.</P>
<P>VI. ABRIDGEMENT OF LABOUR. It has long been made
a question whether those mechanical contrivances, which
<HI>abridge labour,</HI> by performing the same work with fewer
<PB N="630" REF="672"/>
hands, be detrimental or not to the population of a coun∣try.
From what has been delivered in preceding parts
of the chapter it will be evident, that this question is
equivalent to another, whether such contrivances dimi∣nish
or not the quantity of employment. Their first and
most obvious effect undoubtedly is this; because if one
man be made to do what three men did before, two are
immediately discharged: but if, by some more general
and remoter consequence, they increase the demand for
work, or, what is the same thing, prevent the diminu∣tion
of that demand, in a greater proportion than they
contract the number of hands by which it is performed,
the quantity of employment, upon the whole, will gain
an addition. Upon which principle it may be observed,
firstly, that whenever a mechanical invention succeeds
in one place, it is necesslary that it be imitated in every
other, where the same manufacture is carried on; for it
is manifest, that he, who has the benefit of a conciser
operation, will soon outvie and undersell a competitor
who continues to use a more circuitous labour. It is also
true, in the second place, that whoever first discover or
adopt a mechanical improvement, will, for some time,
draw to themselves an increase of employment; and that
this preference may continue even after the improvement
has become general: for, in every kind of trade, it is not only
a great but permanent advantage, to have once preoccupied
the public reputation. Thirdly, after every superiority
which might he derived from the possession of a secret,
has
ceased, it may be well questioned, whether even then
<PB N="631" REF="673"/>
any loss can accrue to employment. The same money will
be spared to the same article still. Wherefore in
propor∣tion
as it can be afforded at a lower price, by reason
of an
easier or shorter process in the manufacture, it will either
grow into more general use, or an improvement will take
place in the quality and fabric of the article, which will
demand a proportionable addition of hands. The number
of persons employed in the manufactory of stockings has
not, I apprehend, decreased, since the invention of stoc∣king
mills. The amount of what is expended upon the
article after subtracting from it the price of the raw ma∣terial,
and consequently what is paid for work in this
branch of our manufactories, is not less than it was before.
Goods of a finer texture are worn in the place of coarser.
This is the change which the invention has produced,
and which compensates to the manufactory for every other
inconveniency. Add to which, that in the above, and in
almost every instance, an improvement which conduces
to the recommendation of a manufactory, either by the
cheapness or the quality of the goods, draws up after it
many dependent employments, in which no abbrevia∣tion
has taken place.</P>
<P>From the reasoning that has been pursued, and the vari∣ous
considerations suggeted in this chapter, a judgment
may, in some sort, be formed, how far regulations of law
are in their nature capable of contributing to the support and advancement of population. I <HI>say how far,</HI> for, as in many
<PB N="632" REF="674"/>
subjects, so especially in those which relate to commerce,
to plenty, to riches, and to the number of the people,
more is wont to be expected from laws, than laws can do.
Laws can only imperfectly restrain that dissoluteness of
manners, which, by diminishing the frequency of mar∣riages,
impairs the very source of population. Laws can∣not
regulate the wants of mankind, their mode of living,
or their desire of those superfluities, which fashion, more
irresistible than laws, has once introduced into general
use, or, in other words, has erected into necessaries of
life. Laws cannot induce men to enter into marriages,
when the expence of a family must deprive them of that
system of accommodation, to which they have habituated
their expectations. Laws by their protection, by assuring
to the labourer the fruit and profit of his labour, may help
to make a people industrious; but without industry, the
laws cannot provide either subsistence, or employment:
laws cannot make corn grow without toil and care; or
trade flourish without art and diligence. The expert,
laborious, honest workman, will be <HI>employed,</HI> in spite of
all laws, in preference to the lazy, the unskilful, the
fraudulent and evasive: and this is not more true of two
inhabitants of the same village, than it is of the people of
two different countries, which communicate either with
each other, or with the rest of the world. The natural
basis of trade is rivalship of quality and price; or which is
the same thing, of skill and industry. Every attempt to
<HI>force</HI> trade by operation of law, that is, by compelling
persons to buy goods at one market, which they can obtain
<PB N="633" REF="675"/>
cheaper and better from another, is sure to be either
eluded by the incessant activity of private interest, or to
be frustrated by retaliation. One half of the commercial
laws of many states are calculated merely to counteract
the restractions which have been imposed by other states.
Perhaps the only way, in which the interposition of law
is salutary in trade, is in the prevention of frauds.</P>
<P>Next to the indispensible requisites of internal peace and security, the chief advantage, which can be derived
to population from the interference of law, appears to
me to consist in the encouragement of <HI>agriculture.</HI> This,
at least, is the direct way of increasing the number of the
people; every other mode being effectual only by its in∣fluence
upon this. Now the principal expedient by which
such a purpose can be promoted, is to adjust the laws of
property, as nearly as possible, to the two following rules:
firstly, “to give to the occupier all the power over the
soil which is necessary for its perfect cultivation;”—second∣ly,
“to assign the whole profit of every improvement to
the persons by whose activity it is carried on.” What
we call property in land, as hath been observed above, is
power over it. Now it is indifferent to the public, in
whose hands this power resides, if it be rightly used: it matters not to whom the land belongs, if it be well cul∣tivated.
When we lament that great estates are often
united in the same hand, or complain that one man
possesses what would be sufficient for a thousand, we sus∣fer
ourselves to be misled by names. The owner of ten
<PB N="634" REF="676"/>
thousand pounds a year <HI>consumes</HI> little more of the produce
of the soil than the owner of ten pound's a year. If the
cultivation be equal, the estate, in the hands of one great
lord, affords subsistence and employment to the same num∣ber
of persons, as it would do, if it were divided amongst
a hundred proprietors. In like manner, we ought to
judge of the effect upon the public interest, which may
arise from lands being holden by the king, or by the sub∣ject;
by private persons, or by corporations; by lay men
or ecclesiastics; in fee or for life; by virtue of office, or
in right of inheritance, I do not mean that these varieties
make no difference, but I mean, that all the difference
they do make respects cultivation.</P>
<P>But there exist in this country conditions of tenure,
which condemn the land itself to perpetual sterility. Of
this kind is the right of <HI>common,</HI> which precludes each
proprietor from the improvement, or even the convenient
occupation of his estate, without, what seldom can be
obtained, the eonsent of many others. This tenure is
also usually embarrassed by the Interference of <HI>manerial</HI>
claims, under which it often happens that the surface
belongs to one owner, and the soil to another; so that
neither owner can stir a clod without the concurrence of his
partner in the property. In many manors, the tenant
is restrained from granting leases beyond a short term
of years, which renders every plan of solid and perma∣nent
improvement impracticable. In these cases the
owner wants, what the first rule of rational policy re∣quires;
<PB N="635" REF="677"/>
“sufficient power over the soil for its perfect culti∣vation.”
This power ought to be extended to him by
some easy and general law of enfranchisement, partition,
and inclosure, which, tho' compulsory upon the lord or
the rest of the tenants, whilfst it has in view the meliora∣tion
of the soil, and tenders an equitable compensation
for every right that it takes away, is neither more arbi∣trary,
nor more dangerous to the stability of property, than
that which is done in the construction of roads, bridges,
embankments, navigable canals, and indeed almost every
public work, in which private owners of land are obliged
to accept that price for their property which an indifferent
jury may award. It may here however be proper to
observe, that altho' the inclosure of wastes and pastures
be generally beneficial to population, yet the inclosure of
lands in tillage, in order to convert them into pastures,
is as generally hurtful.</P>
<P>But secondly, agriculture is discouraged by every con∣stitution
of landed property, which lets in those, who
have no concern in the improvement, to a participation
of the profit. This objection is applicable to all such
customs of manors as subject the proprietor, upon the
death of the lord, or tenant, or the alienation of the
estate, to a fine apportioned to the improved value of
the land. But of all institutions, which are, in this
way, adverse to cultivation and improvement, none is so
noxious as that of <HI>tithes.</HI> A claimant here enters into
the produce who contributed no assistance whatever to
<PB N="636" REF="678"/>
the production. When years, perhaps, of care and toil
have matured an improvement; when the husbandman
sees new crops ripening to his skill and industry, the moment he is ready to put his sickle to the grain, he
finds himself compelled to divide his harvest with a
stranger. Tithes are a tax not only upon industry, but
upon that industry which seeds mankind; upon that
species of exertion, which it is the aim of all wise laws
to cherish and promote; and to uphold and excite which,
composes, as we have seen, the main benefit that the
community receives from the whole system of trade, and
the success of commerce. And together with the more
general inconveniency that attends the exaction of tithes,
there is this additional evil, in the mode at least accord∣ing
to which they are collected at present, that they ope∣rate
as a bounty upon pasturage. The burthen of the
tax falls with its chief, if not with its whole weight,
upon tillage; that is to say, upon that precise mode of
cultivation, which, as hath been shown above, it is the
business of the state to relieve and remunerate, in prefe∣rence
to every other. No measure, of such extensive
concern, appears to me so practicable, nor any single alte∣ration
so beneficial, as the conversion of tithes into corn
rents. This commutation, I am convinced, might be so
adjusted, as to secure to the tithe-holder, a complete and
perpetual equivalent for his interest, and to leave to indus∣try
its full operation and entire reward.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of War, and of Military Establishments.</HEAD>
<P>BECAUSE the Christian scriptures describe wars,
as what they are, as crimes or judgments, some
have been led to believe that it is unlawful for a Christian
to bear arms. But it should be remembered, that it may
be necessary for individuals to unite their force, and, for
this end, to resign themselves to the direction of a com∣mon
will; and yet it may be true, that that will is often
actuated by criminal motives, and often determined to
destructive purposes. Hence, although the origin of wars
be ascribed in scripture to the operation of lawless and
malignant passions;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James iv. 1.</NOTE> and tho' war itself be enumerated
the sorest calamities with which a land can be
<PB N="638" REF="680"/>
visited, the profession of a soldier is no where forbidden
or condemned. When the "soldiers demanded of John
the Baptist, “and what shall we do?” he said unto them,
“do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsly, and be
content with your wages.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke iii. 14.</NOTE> In which answer we do
not find that, in order to prepare themselves for the
reception of the kingdom of God, it was required of soldiers
to relinquish their profession, but only that they should be∣ware
of the vices, of which that profession, it may be pre∣sumed, was justly accused. The precept, “be con∣tent
with your wages,” supposed them to continue in
their situation. It was of a Roman centurion that Christ
pronounced that memorable eulogy, “I have not found so
great faith no not in Israel.”<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke vii. 9.</NOTE> The first<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 1.</NOTE> gentile convert
who was received into the Christian church, and to whom
the gospel was imparted by the immediate and especial
direction of Heaven, held the same station: and, in the
history of this transaction, we discover not the smallest
intimation, that Cornelius upon becoming a Christian quit∣ted
the service of the Roman legion; that his profession was
objected to, or his continuance in it considered as, in any
wise, inconsistent with his new character.</P>
<P>In applying the principles of morality to the affairs of na∣tions,
the difficulty which meets us arises from hence, that
the particular consequence, sometimes, appears to exceed the
<PB N="639" REF="681"/>
value of the general rule." In this circumstance is found∣ed
the only distinction that exists between the case of
independent states, and of independent individuals. In
the transactions of private persons, no advantage, that
results from the breach of a general law of justice, can
compensate to the public for the violation of the law:
in the concerns of empire, this may sometimes be doubted.
Thus, that the faith of promises ought to be maintained,
as far as is lawful, and as far as was intended by the
parties, whatever inconveniency either of them may suf∣fer
by his fidelity, in the intercourse of private life is
seldom disputed; because it is evident to almost every
man who reflects upon the subject, that the common
happiness gains more by the preservation of the rule, than
it could do by the removal of the inconveniency. But
when the adherence to a public treaty would enslave a
whole people, would block up seas, rivers, or harbours;
depopulate cities, condemn fertile regions to eternal de∣solation,
cut off a country from its sources of provision,
or deprive it of those commercial advantages, to which its
climate, produce, or situation naturally entitle it; the
magnitude of the particular evil induces us to call in
question the obligation of the general rule. Moral phi∣losophy
furnishes no precise solution to these doubts.
She cannot pronounce that any rule of morality is so
rigid as to bend to no exceptions; nor, on the other hand,
can she comprize these exceptions within any previous
description. She confesses that the obligation of every
law depends upon its ultimate utility; that this utility
<PB N="640" REF="682"/>
having a finite and determinate value, situations may be
feigned, and consequently may possibly arise, in which
the general tendency is outweighed by the enormity of
the particular mischief: but she recalls, at the same
time, to the consideration of the enquirer, the almost
inestimable importance, as of other general rules of rela∣tive
justice, so especially of national and personal fidelity;
the unseen, if not unbounded extent of the mischief,
which must follow from the want of it; the danger of
leaving it to the sufferer to decide upon the comparison of
particular and general consequences, and the still greater
danger of such decisions being drawn into future pre∣cedents.
If treaties, for instance, be no longer binding
than whilst they are convenient, or until the inconve∣niency
ascend to a certain point which point must be
fixed by the judgment, or rather the feelings of the
complaining party; or if such an opinion, after being
authorized by a few examples, come at length to prevail;
one and almost the only method of averting or closing
the calamities of war, of either preventing, or putting a
stop to the destruction of mankind, is lost to the world for
ever. We do not say that no evil can exceed this, nor
any possible advantage compensate it; but we say that a
loss, which affects <HI>all,</HI> will scarcely be made up to the
common stock of human happiness, by any benefit that
can be procured to a single nation, which, however respect∣able
when compared with any other single nation, bears
an inconsiderable proportion to the whole. These how∣ever
are the principles upon which the calculation is to
<PB N="641" REF="683"/>
be formed. It is enough, in this place, to remark the
cause which produces the hesitation that we sometimes feel,
in applying the rules of personal probity to the conduct of
nations.</P>
<P>As between individuals it is found impossible to ascertain
every duty by an immediate reference to public utility,
not only because such reference is oftentimes too remote
and obscure for the direction of private consciences, but
because a multitude of cases arise, in which it is indiffer∣ent
to the general interest by what rule men act, tho' it
be absolutely necessary that they act by some constant and
known rule or other; and as for these reasons certain po∣sitive
constitutions are wont to be established in every
society, which, when established, become as obligatory as
the original principles of natural justice themselves; so,
likewise, it is between independent communities. Together
with those maxims of universal equity which are common
to states and to individuals, and by which the rights and
conduct of the one as well as of the other ought to be
adjusted, when they fall within the scope and application
of such maxims; there exists also amongst sovereigns a
system of artificial jurisprudence, under the name of the
<HI>law of nations.</HI> In this code are found the rules which
determine the right to vacant or newly discovered countries;
those which relate to the protection of fugitives, the pri∣vileges
of embassadors, the condition and duties of neutra∣lity,
the immunities of neutral ships, ports, and coasts,
the distance from shore to which these immunities extend,
<PB N="642" REF="684"/>
the distinction between free and contraband goods, and a
variety of subjects of the same kind. Concerning which
examples, and indeed the principal part of what is called the
<HI>jus gentium,</HI> it may be observed, that the rules derive their
moral force, by which I mean the regard that ought to
be paid to them by the consciences of sovereigns, not
from their internal reasonableness or justice, for many of
them are perfectly arbitrary; nor yet from the authority
by which they were established, for the greater part have
grown insensibly into usage without any public compact,
formal acknowledgment, or even known original; but
simply from the fact of their being established, and the
general duty of conforming to established rules upon
questions, and between parties, where nothing but positive
regulations can prevent disputes, and where disputes are
followed by such destructive consequences. The first of
the instances, which we have just now enumerated, may
be selected for the illustration of this remark. The
nations of Europe consider the sovereignty of newly dis∣covered
countries as belonging to the prince or state whose
subject makes the discovery; and, in pursuance of this
rule, it is usual for a navigator, who falls upon an un∣known
shore, to take possession of it, in the name of his
sovereign at home, by erecting his standard, or displaying
his flag upon a desert coast. Now nothing can be more
fanciful, or less substantiated by any considerations of
reason or justice, than the right which such discovery, or
the transient occupation, and idle ceremony that accompany
it, confer upon the country of the discoverer. Nor can
<PB N="643" REF="685"/>
any stipulation be produced, by which the rest of the
world have bound themselves to submit to this pretension.
Yet when we reflect that the claims to newly discovered
countries can hardly be settled, between the different
nations that frequent them, without some positive rule
or other; that such claims, if left unsettled, would
prove sources of ruinous and fatal contentions; that the
rule already proposed, however arbitrary, possesses one
principal quality of a rule—determination and certainty;
above all that it is acquiesced in, and that no one has
power to substitute another, however he might contrive
a better, in its place: when we reflect upon these pro∣perties
of the rule, or rather upon these consequences of
rejecting its authority, we are led to ascribe to it the vir∣tue
and obligation of a precept of natural justice, because
we perceive in it that, which is the foundation of justice
itself, public importance and utility. And a prince who
should dispute this rule, for the want of regularity in its
formation, or of intelligible justice in its principle, and by
such disputes should disturb the tranquillity of nations, and
at the same time lay the foundation of future disturbances,
would be little less criminal, than he who breaks the public
peace by a violation of engagements to which he had him∣self
consented, or by an attack upon those national rights,
which are founded immediately in the law of nature, and
in the first perceptions of equity. The same thing may be
repeated of the rules which the law of nations prescribes
in the other instances that were mentioned, namely, that
the obscurity of their origin, or the arbitrariness of their
<PB N="644" REF="686"/>
principle, substracts nothing from the respect that is due
to them, when once established.</P>
<P>WAR, may be considered with a view to its <HI>causes</HI> and to
its <HI>conduct.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>justifying</HI> causes of war are deliberate invasions of
right, and the necessity of maintaining such a balance of
power amongst neighbouring nations, as that no single state,
or confederacy of states, be strong enough to overwhelm
the rest. The objects of just war are precaution, defence,
or reparation. In a larger sense, every just war is a <HI>de∣fensive</HI>
war, inasmuch as every just war supposes an injury
perpetrated, attempted, or feared.</P>
<P>The <HI>insufficient</HI> causes, or <HI>unjustifiable</HI> motives of war, are
either the family alliances, or the personal friendships, or
quarrels of princes; the internal disputes which are
carried on in other nations; the justice of other wars;
the extension of territory, or of trade; the misfortunes
or accidental weakness of a neighbouring or rival nation.</P>
<P>There are <HI>two</HI> lessons of rational and sober policy,
which, if it were possible to inculcate into, the councils of
princes, would exclude many of the motives of war, and
al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay that restless ambition which is constantly stirring up
one part of mankind against another. The first of these
lessons admonishes princes to “place their glory and their
emulation, not in extent of territory, but in raising the
<PB N="645" REF="687"/>
greatest quantity of happiness out of a given territory.”
The enlargement of territory by conquest is not only not
a just object of war, but in the greater part of the in∣stances
in which it is attempted, not even desireable. It
is certainly not desireable where it adds nothing to the
numbers, the enjoyments, or the security of the con∣querors.
What commonly is gained to a nation, by the
annexing of new dependencies, or the subjugation of
other countries to its dominion, but a wider frontier to
defend; more interfering claims to vindicate; more
quarrels, more enemies, more rebellions to encounter;
a greater force to keep up by sea and land; more services
to provide for, and more establishments to pay? And in
order to draw from these acquisitions something that may
make up for the charge of keeping them, a revenue is to
be extorted, or a monopoly to be enforced and watched,
at an expence which costs half their produce. Thus the
provinces are oppressed, in order to pay for being ill
governed; and the original state is exhausted in main∣taining
a feeble authority over discontented subjects. No
assignable portion of country is benefited by the change;
and if the sovereign appear to himself to be enriched or
strengthened, when every part of his dominion is made
poorer and weaker than it was, it is probable that he is
deceived by appearances. Or were it true that the gran∣deur
of the prince is magnified by those exploits; that
glory which is purchased, and that ambition which is
gratified by the distress of one country, without adding
to the happiness of another, which, at the same time en∣slaves
<PB N="646" REF="688"/>
the new, and impoverishes the ancient part of the
empire, by whatever names it may be known or flattered,
is an object of universal execration; and not more so to
the vanquished, than it is oftentimes to the very people
whose armies or whose treasures have atchieved the victory.</P>
<P>There are indeed, two cases in which the ex∣tension
of territory is of real advantage, and to both
parties. The first is, where an empire thereby reaches to
the natural boundaries which divide it from the rest of
the world. Thus the British channel is the natural
boundary which separates the nations of England and
France: and if France possessed any countries on this,
or England any cities or provinces on that side of the
sea, the recovery of such towns and districts to what may
be called their natural sovereign, tho' it might not be a
just reason for commencing war, would be a proper use
to make of victory. The other case is, where neighbour∣ing
states being severally too small and weak to defend
themselves against the dangers that surround them,
can only be safe by a strict and constant junction of their
strength: here conquest will effect the purposes of confe∣deration
and alliance: and the union which it produces
is often more close and permanent than that which
results from voluntary association. Thus, if the hep∣tarchy
had continued in England, the different kingdoms
of it might have separately fallen a prey to foreign inva∣sion;
and although the interest and danger of one part of
the island was in truth common to every other part, it
might have been difficult to have circulated this persua∣sion
<PB N="647" REF="689"/>
amongst independent nations; or to have united
them in any regular or steady opposition to their conti∣nental
enemies, had not the valour and fortune of an
enterprising prince incorporated the whole into a single
monarchy. Here the conquered gain as much by the
revolution as the conquerors. In like manner, and for
the same reason, when the two royal families of Spain
met together in one race of princes, and the several pro∣vinces
of France had devolved into the possession of a
single sovereign, it became unsafe for the inhabitants of
Great Britain any longer to remain under separate govern∣ments.
The union of England and Scotland, which
transformed two quarrelsome neighbours into one power∣ful
empire, and which was first brought about by the
course of succession, and afterwards completed by amica∣ble
convention, would have been a fortunate conclusion
of hostilities, had it been effected by the operations of
war. These two cases being admitted, namely, the ob∣taining
of natural boundaries and barriers, and the in∣cluding
under the same government those who have a
common danger, and a common enemy to guard against;
I know not whether a third can be thought of, in which
the extension of empire by conquest is useful even to the
conquerors.</P>
<P>The second rule of prudence which ought to be re∣commended
to those who conduct the affairs of nations is,
“never to pursue national <HI>honour</HI> as distinct from national <HI>in∣terest.”</HI>
This rule acknowledges that it is often necessary to
<PB N="648" REF="690"/>
assert the honour of a nation for the sake of its interest. The
spirit and courage of a people are supported by flattering
their pride. Concessions which betray too much of fear
or weakness, tho' they relate to points of mere ceremony,
invite demands and attacks of more serious impor∣tance.
Our rule allows all this, and directs only that,
when points of honour become subjects of contention
between sovereigns, or are likely to be made the occasions
of war, they be estimated with a reference to utility,
and not <HI>by themselves.</HI> “The dignity of his crown,
the honour of his flag, the glory of his arms,” in
the mouth of a prince, are stately and imposing terms;
but the ideas they inspire are insatiable. It may be al∣ways
glorious to conquer, whatever be the justice of the
war, or the price of the victory. The dignity of a sovereign
may not permit him to recede from claims of homage and
respect, at whatever expence of national peace and happi∣ness
they are to be maintained, however unjust they may
have been in their original, or, in their continuance, how∣ever
useless to the possessor, or mortifying and vexatious to
other states. The pursuit of honour, when set loose from
the admonitions of prudence, becomes in kings a wild and
romantic passion; eager to engage, and gathering fury
in its progress, it is checked by no difficulties, repelled by
no dangers: it forgets or despises those considerations of
safety, ease, wealth and plenty, which, in the eye of true
public wisdom, compose the objects, to which the renown
of arms, the fame of victory, are only instrumental and
subordinate. The pursuit of interest, on the other hand,
<PB N="649" REF="691"/>
is a sober principle; computes costs and consequences; is
cautious of entering into war; stops in time; when regu∣lated
by those universal maxims of relative justice which
belong to the affairs of communities, as well as of private
persons, it is the right principle for nations to proceed by;
even when it trespasses upon these regulations, it is much
less dangerous, because much more temperate than the
other.</P>
<P>II. The conduct of war.—If the cause and end of war
be justifiable, all the means that appear necessary to the
end are justifiable also. This is the principle which
defends those extremities, to which the violence of war
usually proceeds; for since war is a contest by force
between parties who acknowledge no common superior,
and since it includes not in its idea the supposition of
any convention which should place limits to the opera∣tions
of force, it has naturally no boundary, but that
in which force terminates, the destruction of the
life against which the force is directed. Let it be
observed however, that the license of war authorizes no
acts of hostility but what are necessary or conducive to
the end and object of the war. Gratuitous barbarities
borrow no excuse from this plea. Of which kind is every
cruelty and every insult that serves only to exasperate
the sufferings, or to incense the hatred of an enemy,
without weakening his strength, or in any manner tend∣ing
to procure his submission; such as the slaughter of
captives, the subjecting them to indignities or torture,
<PB N="650" REF="692"/>
the violation of women, the profanation of temples, the
demolition of public buildings, libraries, statues, and in
general the destruction or defacing of works that conduce
nothing to annoyance or defence These enormities are
prohibited not only by the practice of civilized nations,
but by the law of nature itself; as having, no proper
tendency to accelerate the termination or object of the
war; and as containing that, which in peace and war is
equally unjustifiable, ultimate and gratuitous mischief.</P>
<P>There are other restrictions imposed upon the conduct
of war, not by the law of nature primarily, but by the
<HI>laws of war</HI> first, and by the law of nature as seconding,
and ratifying the laws of war. The laws of war are part
of the law of nations; and founded, as to their authority,
upon the same principle with the rest of that code, name∣ly,
upon the fact of their being established, no matter
when or by whom; upon the expectation of their being
mutually observed, in consequence of that establishment;
and upon the general utility which results from such
observation. The binding force of these rules is the
greater, because the regard that is paid to them must be
universal or none. The breach of the rule can only
be punished by the subversion of the rule itself. On
which account the whole mischief, that ensues from the
loss of those salutary restrictions, which such rules pre∣scribe,
is justly chargeable upon the first aggressor. To
this consideration may be referred the duty of refraining
in war from poison and from assassination. If the law of
<PB N="651" REF="693"/>
nature simply be consulted, it may be difficult to distin∣guish
between these and other methods of destruction,
which are practised without scruple by nations at war.
If it be lawful to kill an enemy at all, it seems lawful to
do so by one mode of death as well as by another; by a
dose of poison, as by the point of a sword; by the hand
of an assassin, as by the attack of an army: for if it be
said that one species of assault leaves to an enemy the
power of defending himself against it, and that the other
does not, it may be answered that we possess at least the
same right to cut off an enemy's defence, that we have
to seek his destruction. In this manner might the
question be debated, if there existed no rule or law of war
upon the subject. But when we observe that such
practices are at present excluded by the usage and opi∣nions
of civilized nations; that the first recourse to
them would be followed by instant retaliation; that the
mutual license which such attempts must introduce
would fill both sides with the misery of continual dread
and suspicion, without adding to the strength or success
of either; that when the example came to be more gene∣rally
imitated, which it soon would be after the senti∣ment,
that condemns it, had been once broken in upon, it
would greatly aggravate the horrors and calamities of war,
and yet procure no superiority to any of the nations engag∣ed
in it: when we view these effects, we join in the public
reprobation of such fatal expedients, as of the admission
amongst mankind of new and enormous evils without
necessity or advantage. The law of nature, we see at
<PB N="652" REF="694"/>
length, forbids these innovations as so many transgressions
of a beneficial general rule, actually subsisting.</P>
<P>The license of war then acknowledges two limitations:
it authorizes no hostilities which have not an apparent
tendency to effectuate the object of the war; it respects
those positive laws which the custom of nations hath
sanctified, and which, whilst they are mutually con∣formed
to, mitigate the calamities of war without weak∣ening
its operations, or diminishing the power or safety
of belligerent states.</P>
<P>Long and various experience seems to have convinced
the nations of Europe that nothing but a <HI>standing army</HI>
can oppose a standing army, where the numbers on each
side bear any moderate proportion to one another. The
first standing army that appeared in Europe after the fall
of the Roman legion, was that which was erected in
France by Charles VII. about the middle of the fifteenth
century. And that the institution hath since become
general, can only be attributed to the superiority and success
which are every where observed to attend it. The truth
is, the closeness, regularity, and quickness of their
movements; the unreserved, instantaneous, and almost
mechanical obedience to orders; the sense of personal
honour, and the familiarity with danger, which belong
to a disciplined, veteran, and embodied soldiery, give such
firmness and intrepidity to their approach, such weight
and execution to their attack, as are not to be withstood
<PB N="653" REF="695"/>
by loose ranks of occasional and newly levied troops, who
are liable by their inexperience to disorder and confusion,
and in whom fear is constantly augmented by novelty
and surprize. It is possible that a <HI>militia,</HI> with a great
excess of numbers, and a ready supply of recruits, may
sustain a defensive or a flying war against regular troops:
it is also true that any service, which keeps soldiers for a
while together, and inures them by little and little to the
habits of war, and the dangers of action, transforms them
in effect into a standing army: but upon this plan it may
be necessary for almost a whole nation to go out to war to
repel an invader; beside that a people so unprepared
must always have the seat, and with it the miseries
of war, at home, being utterly incapable of carrying their
operations into a foreign country.</P>
<P>From the acknowledged superiority of standing armies,
it follows, not only that it is unsafe for a nation to
disband its regular troops, whilst neighbouring kingdoms
retain theirs, but also that regular troops provide for
the public service at the least possible expence. I suppose
a certain quantity of military strength to be necessary, and
I say that a standing army costs the community less than
any other establishment which presents to an enemy the
same force. The constant drudgery of low employments is
not only incompatible with any great degree of perfection
or expertness in the profession of a soldier, but the pro∣fession
of a soldier almost always unfits men for the busi∣ness
of regular occupations. Of three inhabitants of a
<PB N="654" REF="696"/>
village, it is better that one should addict himself entirely
to arms, and the other two stay constantly at home to cul∣tivate
the ground, than that all the three should mix the
avocations of a camp with the business of husbandry. By
the former arrangement the country gains one complete
soldier, and two industrious husbandmen; from the lat∣ter
it receives three raw militia-men, who are at the same
time three idle and profligate peasants. It should be consi∣dered
also that the emergencies of war wait not for sea∣sons.
Where there is no standing army ready for imme∣diate
service, it may be necessary to call the reaper from the
fields in harvest, or the ploughman in seed time; and the
provision of a whole year may perish by the interruption of
one month's labour. A standing army, therefore, is not
only a more effectual, but a cheaper method of providing
for the public safety, than any other, because it adds more
than any other to the common strength, and takes less
from that, which composes the wealth of a nation, its
stock of productive industry.</P>
<P>There is yet another distinction between standing armies
and militias, which deserves a more attentive considera∣tion
than any that has been mentioned. When the
state relies for its defence upon a militia, it is necessary
that arms be put into the hands of the people at large.
The militia itself must be numerous, in proportion to the
want or inferiority of its discipline, and the imbecilities
or defects of its constitution. Moreover, as such a mili∣tia
must be supplied by rotation, allotment, or some
<PB N="655" REF="697"/>
mode of succession, whereby they, who have served a
certain time, are replaced by fresh draughts from the
country, a much greater number will be instructed in the
use of arms, and will have been occasionally embodied
together, than are actually employed, or than are sup∣posed
to be wanted at the same time. Now what effects
upon the civil condition of the country may be looked
for from this general diffusion of the military character,
becomes an enquiry of great importance and delicacy.
To me it appears doubtful, whether any government
can be long secure, where the people are acquainted with
the use of arms and accustomed to resort to them. Every
faction will find itself at the head of an army. Every
disgust will excite commotion, and every commotion
become a civil war. Nothing perhaps can govern a
nation of armed citizens but that which governs an
army—despotism. I do not mean that a regular go∣vernment
would become despotic by training up its sub∣jects
to the knowledge and exercise of arms, but that it
would ere long be forced to give way to despotism in
some other shape; and that the country would be liable,
to what is even worse than a settled and constitutional
despotism, to perpetual rebellions, and to perpetual revo∣lutions;
to short and violent usurpations; to the suc∣cessive
tyranny of governors, rendered cruel and jealous
by the danger and instability of their situation.</P>
<P>The same purposes of strength and efficacy which
make a standing army necessary at all, make it necessary,
<PB N="656" REF="698"/>
in mixt governments, that this army be submitted to the
management and direction of the prince. For however well
a popular council may be qualified for the offices of legisla∣tion,
it is altogether unfit for the conduct of war; in which
success usually depends upon vigour and enterprize, upon
secresy, dispatch, and unanimity, upon a quick percep∣tion
of opportunities, and the power of seizing every
opportunity immediately. It is likewise necessary that
the obedience of an army be as prompt and active as
possible; for which reason it ought to be made an obe∣dience
of will and emulation. Upon this consideration
is founded the expediency of leaving to the prince not
only the government and destination of the army, but the
appointment and promotion of its officers; because a
design is then alone likely to be executed with zeal
and fidelity, when the person who issues the order
chuses the instruments, and rewards the service. To
which we may subjoin that, in governments like ours,
if the direction and <HI>officering</HI> of the army were placed in
the hands of the democratic part of the constitution, this
power, added to what they already possess, would so
overbalance all that would be left of regal prerogative,
that little would remain of monarchy in the constitution,
but the name and expence; nor would they probably
remain long.</P>
<P>Whilst we describe, however, the advantages of standing
armies, we must not conceal the danger. These proper∣ties
of their constitution, the soldiery being separated in
<PB N="657" REF="699"/>
a great degree from the rest of the community, their
being closely linked amongst themselves by habits of
society and subordination, and the dependency of the
whole chain upon the will and favour of the prince,
however essential they may be to the purposes for which
armies are kept up, give them an aspect in no wise fa∣vourable
to public liberty. This danger however is
diminished by maintaining, upon all occasions, as
much alliance of interest, and as much intercourse of
sentiment, between the military part of the nation and
the other orders of the people, as are consistent with the
union and discipline of an army. For which purpose
the officers of the army, upon whose disposition towards
the commonwealth a great deal may depend should be
taken from the principal families of the country, and
at the same time also be encouraged to establish in it
families of their own, as well as be admitted to seats in
the senate, to hereditary distinctions, and to all the civil
honours and privileges that are compatible with their
profession; which circumstances of connection and situ∣ation
will give them such a share in the general rights of
the people, and so engage their inclinations on the side of
public liberty, as to afford a reasonable security that they
cannot be brought, by any promises of personal aggran∣disement,
to assist in the execution of measures which
might enslave their posterity, their kindred, and their
country.—</P>
