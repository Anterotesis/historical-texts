<HEAD>ON THE DUTIES OF THE YOUNG.</HEAD>
<P>The uncertainty of the enjoyments of human life
Checks presumption; the multiplicity of its dangers
Demands perpetual caution. Moderation, vigilance,
And self-government, are duties incumbent on all; but
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>specially on such as are beginning the journey of life.
The scenes which present themselves, at our entering
upon the world, are commonly flattering. What∣ever
they be in themselves, the lively spirits of the
young gild every opening prospect. The field of
hope appears to stretch wide before them. Pleasure
seems to put sorth its blossoms on every side. Im∣pelled
by desire, forward they rush with inconsider∣ate
ardour: Prompt to decide, and to chuse; averse
to hesitate, or to inquire; credulous, because untaught
by experience; rash, because unacquainted with dan∣ger;
headstrong, because unsubdued by disappoint∣ment.
As soon as you are capable of reflection,
you must perceive that there is a right and a wrong
in human actions. You see, that those who are born
with the same advantages of fortune, are not all equally
prosperous in the course of life. While some of them,
by wise and steady conduct, attain distinction in the
world, and pass their days with comfort and honour;
others of the same rank, by mean and vicious behav∣iour,
forfeit the advantages of their birth, involve
themselves in much misery, and end in being a dis∣grace
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
to their friends, and a burden on society. Early
then, you may learn, that it is not on the external con∣dition
in which you find yourselves placed, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the part which you are to act, that your welfare <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
unhappiness, your honour or infamy, depend. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
when beginning to act that part, what can be of greater
moment, than to regulate your plan of conduct with
the most serious attention, before you have yet com∣mitted
any satal or irretrieveable errors? If, instead
exerting reflection for this valuable purpose, you deliv∣er
you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> selves up at so critical a time, to sloth and plea∣sure;
if you refuse to listen to any counsellor but h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mour,
or to attend to any pursuit except that of amuse∣ment;
if you allow yourselves to float loose and carele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
on the tide of life, ready to receive any direction
which the current of fashion may chance to give you
what can you expect to follow from such beginnings
While so many around you are undergoing the sad
consequences of a like indiscretion, for what reason
shall not those consequences extend to you? Sha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
you attain success without that preparation, and es∣cape
dangers without that precaution, which is re∣quired
of others? Shall happiness grow up to you
of its own accord, and solicit your acceptance, when
to the rest of mankind, it is the fruit of long cultiva∣tion,
and the acquisition of labour and care?—De∣ceive
not yourselves with such arrogant hopes. What
ever be your rank. Providence will not, for your sake
reverse its established order. The Author of your be∣ing
hath enjoined, you to <HI>take heed to your ways;
ponder the paths of your feet; to remember your Creator
the days of your youth.</HI> He, hath decreed, that the
only <HI>who seek after wisdom shall find it; that fools sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
be afflicted because of their transgressions; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
so re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>useth instruction shall destroy his own soul.</HI> By list∣ening
to these admonitions. and tempering the vivacity
of youth with a proper mixture of serious thought you
may ensure cheerfulness for the rest of life; but by de∣livering
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
yourselves up at present to giddiness and lev∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity,
you lay the foundation of lasting heaviness of
heart. When you look forward to those plans
of life, which either your circumstances have suggest∣ed,
or your friends have proposed, you will not hesi∣tate
to acknowledge that, in order to pursue them with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> advantage, some previous discipline is requisite. Be
assured, that whatever is to be your profession, no edu∣cation
is more necessary to your success, than the
requirement of virtuous dispositions and habits. This
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the universal preparation for every character, and
every station in life. Bad as the world is, respect is
always paid to virtue. In the usual course of human
affairs, it will be found, that a plain understanding
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oined with acknowledged worth, contributes more to
rosperity, than the brightest parts without probity
or honour. Whether science, or business, or public life <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
your aim, virtue still enters, for a principal share,
into all those great departments of society. It is con∣nected
with eminence in every liberal art; with repu∣tation,
in every branch of fair and useful business; with
distinction, in every public station. The vigour which
It gives the mind, and. the weight which it adds to char∣acter;
the generous sentiments which it breathes, the
undaunted spirit which it inspires, the ardour of di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣gence
which it quickens, the freedom which it procures
from pernicious and dishonourable avocations, are the
foundations of all that is high in fame, or great in suc∣cess
among men. Whatever ornamental or en∣agingendowments
you now possess, virtue is a neces∣sary
requisite, in order to their shining with proper
lustre. Feeble are the attractions of the fairest form, if
it be suspected that nothing within corresponds to the
pleasing appearance without. Short are the triumph of
wit, when it is supposed to be the vehicle of malice. By
whatever arts you may at first attract the attention, you
can hold the esteem, and secure the hearts of others,
only by amiable dipositions, and the accomplishments
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
of the mind. These arc the qualities whose lnfluence
will last, when the lustre of all that once sparkled and,
dazzled has passed away. Let not then the season
of youth be barren of improvements socssential to you
future felicity and honour. Now is the seed-time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
life; and according to <HI>what you sow, you shall reap.</HI> Your
character is now, under Divine assistance, of your own
forming; your fate is. in some measure, put into your
own hands. Your nature is as yet pliant and sofu

have not pre-occupied your understanding. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
world has not had time to contract and debase your
affections. All your powers are more vigorous, dis∣embarrassed,
and free, than they will be at any future
period. Whatever-impulse you now give to your de∣sires
and passions, the direction is likely to continue
It will form the channel in which your life is to run
nay, it may determine its everlasting issue. Consider
then the employment of this important period, as the
highest trust which shall ever be committed to you;
as, in a great measure, decisive of your happiness, in
time, and in eternity. As in. the succession of the sea∣sons,
each, by the invariable laws of Nature, affect
the productions of what is next in course; so, in human
life, every period of our age, according as it is well
or ill spent, influences the happiness of that which is
to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings forward
accomplished and flourishing manhood; and suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
manhood passes of itself, without uneasiness, into
respectable and tranquil old age. But when Nature is
turned out of its regular course, disorder takes place in
the moral, just as in the vegetable world. If the Spring
put forth no blossoms, in Summer there will be no
beauty, and in Autumn no fruit. So, if youth be
trifled away without improvement, manhood will be
contemptible, and old age miserable. If the begin∣ings
of life have been <HI>vanity,</HI> its later end can. No
other than <HI>vexation of spirit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Piety to God is the foundation of good morals, and
is a disposition particularly graceful and becoming in
youth.. To be void of it, argues a cold heart, desti∣tute
of some of the best affections which belong to that
age. Youth is the season of warm and generous emo∣tions.
The heart should then, spontaneously, rise in∣to
the admiration of what is great, glow with the love
of what is fair and excellent, and melt at the discov∣ery
of tenderness and goodness. Where can any ob∣ject
be found, so proper to kindle those affections as
the Father of the universe, and the Author of all fe∣licity?
Unmoved by veneration? can you contemplate
That grandeur and majesty, which his works every
where diplay? Untouched by gratitude, can you view
that profusion of good, which, in this pleasing season
of life, his beneficent hand pours around you? Happy
in the love and affection, of those with whom you are
connected, look, up to the Supreme Being, as the in∣spirer
of all the friendship which has ever been shewn
you by others; himself, your best and your first
friend; formerly, the supporter of your infancy, and
the guide of your childhood; now, the guardian of
your youth, and the hope of your coming years. View
religious homage, as a natural expression of gratitude
to him for all his goodness. Connected with so many
tender sensibilities of soul, let religion be with you,
not the cold and barren off spring of speculation, but
the warm and vigorous dictate of the heart. But
though piety chiefly belong to the heart, yet the aid
of the understanding is requisite, to give a proper di∣rection
to the devout affections. Yon must endeavour,
therefore, to acquire just views, both of the great prin∣ciples
of natural religion, and of the peculiar doc∣trines
of the Gospel. For this end study the sacred
scriptures. Cousult the word of God, more than the
systems of men, if you would know the truth in its
native purity. When, upon rational and. sober inquiry.
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
you have established your principles, suffer them not
to be shaken by the scoffs of the licentious, or the cavils
of the sceptical. Remember, that in the examination
of every great and comprehensive plan, such as that of
Christianity, difficulties may be expected to occur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and that reasonable evidence is not to be rejected, be∣cause
the nature of our present state allows us only to
<HI>know in part, and to see through a glass darkly.</HI> Im∣press
your minds with reverence for all that is sacred.
Let no wantonness of youthful spirits, no compliance
with the intemperate mirth of others, ever betray you
into prophane sallies. Besides the guilt which is there
by incurred, nothing gives a more odious appearance
of petulance and presumption to youth, than the affec∣tation
of treating religion with levity. Instead of be∣ing
an evidence of superior understanding, it discovent
a pert and shallow mind; which, vain of the first smat∣terings
of knowledge, presumes to make light of what
the rest of mankind revere. At the same time
you are not to imagine, that when exhorted to be re∣ligious,
you are called upon to become more formal
and solemn in your manners than others of the same
years, or to erect yourselves into supercilious reprov∣ers
of those around you. The spirit of true religion
breathes gentleness and affability. It gives a native,
unaffected case to the behaviour. It is social, kind,
and cheerful; far removed from that gloomy and il∣liberal
superstition which clouds the brow, sharpens
the temper, dejects the spirits, and teaches men to fit
themselves for another world, by neglecting the con∣cerns
of this. Let your religion, on the contrary con∣nect
preparation for heaven, with an honourable dis∣charge
of the duties of active life. Let it be associated
In your imagination, with all that is manly and useful;
<HI>with whatsoever things are true, are just, are pure, art
love<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, are of good report,</HI> wherever there is any <HI>vertu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
and wherever there is <HI>any praise.</HI> Of such religiou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
discover, on every proper occasion, that you are not
a shamed; but avoid making any unnecessary ostenta∣tion
of it before the world.</P>
<P>To piety, join modesty and docility, reverence of
your paren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s, and submission to those who are your
superiors in knowledge, in station, and in years. De∣pendence
and obedience belong to youth. Modesty
is one of its chief ornaments; and has ever been es∣teemed
a presage of rising merit. When entering on
the career of life, it is your part, not to assume the
reins as yet into your hands; but to commit yourselves
to the guidance of the more experienced, and to be∣come
wise by the wisdom of those who have gone be∣fore
you. Of all the follies incident to youth,
there are none which either deform its present appear∣ance,
or blas: the prospect of its future prosperity, more
than self-conceit, presumption, and obstinacy. By
checking its natural progress in improvement, they fix
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in long immaturity; and frequently produce mis∣chiefs,
which can never be repaired. Yet these are vices
too commonly found among the young, Big with en∣terprise,
and elated by hope, they resolve to trust for
succcss to none but themselves. Full of their own abi∣lities,
they deride the admonitions which arc given
them by their friends, as the timorous suggestions of age.
Too wise to learn. too impatient to delibrate,
too forward to be restrained, they plunge, with preci∣pitant
indiscretion, into the midst of all the dangers
with which life abounds. <HI>Seest thou young man wise in
his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool. than of him.</HI>
Positive as you now are in your opinions, and con∣fident
in your assertions, be assured, that the time ap∣proaches
when both men and things will appear to you
in a different light. Many characters which you now
admire, will, by and by, sink in your esteem; and
many opinions, of which you are at present most tena∣cious,
will alter as you advance in years. Distrust,
therefore, that glare of youthful presumption, which
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
dazzles your eyes. Abound not in your own sense
Put not yourselves forward with too much eagerness
nor imagine, that by the impetuosity of juvenile ar∣dour,
you can overturn systems which have been long
established, and change the face of the world. <HI>Learn

to think soberly.</HI> By patient and gradual progression <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

you to the wise, and mark you out for importance
and consideration in subsequent life.</P>
<P>It is necessary to recommend to you, sincerity and
truth. This is the basis of every virtue. That dark∣ness
of character, where we can see no heart; those
foldings of art, through which no native affection <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

every season of life, but particularly odious in youth
If, at an age when the heart is warm, when the emo∣tions
are strong, and when nature is expected to
shew itself free and. open, you can already smile and
deceive, what are we to look for when you shall b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
longer hackneyed in the ways of men; when interest
shall have completed the obduration of your heart, and
experience shall have improved you in all the arts of
guile? Dissimulation in youth, is the fore-runner <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
perfidy in old age. Its first appearance is the fatal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
men of growing depravity, and future shame. It de∣grades
parts and learning; obscures the lustre of every
accomplishment; and sinks you into contempt with
God and man. As you value, therefore, the ap∣probation
of Heaven, or the esteem of the-world cul∣tivate
the love of truth. In all your proceedings, be di∣rect
and consistent. Ingenuity and candour possess
the most powerful charm; they bespeak universal fa∣vour,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
and carry an apology for almost every failing.
<HI>The lip of tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, shall be established for ever; but a lying
tongue is but for a moment.</HI> The path of truth, is a
plain and a safe path; that of falsehood, is a perplexing
maze. After the first departure from sincerity, it is not
in your power to stop. One artifice unavoidably leads
on to another; till, as the intricacy of the lahyrinth
incicascs, you are left entangled in your own snare.
Deceit discovers a little mind, which stops at tempo∣ary
expedients, without rising to comprehensive views
of conduct. It betrays, at the same time, a dastardly
pirit. It is the resource of one who wants courage to
now his designs, or to rest upon himself. Whereas,
openncss of character displays that generous boldness
which ought to distinguish youth. To set out in the
world with no other principle than a crafty attention.
interest, betokens one who is destined for creeping
rough the inferior walks of life. But to give an early
refarence to honour above gain, when they stand in
competition; to depise every advantage, which can
not be attained without dishonest arts; to brook no
eanness, and to stoop to no dissimulation; are the
dications of a great mind, the presages of future em∣ence
and distinction in life. At the same time,
is virtuous sincerity is perfectly consistent with the
most prudent vigilance and caution. It is opposed to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ning. not to true wisdom, It is not the simplicity
a weak and improvident, but the candour of an
enlarged and noble mind; of one who scorns deceit,
because he accounts it both base and unprofitable;
and who seeks no disguise, because he needs none to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide him.</P>
<P>Youth is the proper1 season of cultivating the be∣evolent
and humane affections. As a great part of
our happiness is to depend on the connections which
you form with others, it is of high importance that
on acquire, betimes, the temper and the manners
which will render such connections comfortable. Let
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
a sense of justice be the foundation of all your so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
qualities. In your most early intercourse with
world, and even in your youthful amusement, let
unfairness be found. Engrave on your mind that
cred rule, of <HI>doing all things to others, according as
wish that they should do unto you.</HI> For this end, improve
yourselves with deep sense of the original and r∣ural
equality of men. Whatever advantages of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or
fortune you possess, never display them with an∣tentatious
superiority. Leave the subordination
rank, to regulate the intercourse of more advance
years. At present it becomes you to act among <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
companions, as man with man. Remember how <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>known to
you are the vicissitudes of the world; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
how often they, on whom ignorant and contemptu <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
young men once looked down with scorn, have rise
to be their superiours in future years. Compass
is an emotion of which you ought never to be
shamed. Graceful in youth is the tear of sympathease
and the heart that melts at the tale of woe. Let
ease and indulgence contract your affections, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
you up in selfish enjoyments. But go sometimes to
<HI>house of mourning,</HI> as well as <HI>to the house of feastive</HI>

meanest insect with wanton cruelty.</P>
<P>young minds there is commonly a strong propen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to particular intimacies and friendships. Youth,
deed, is the season when friendships are something
formed, which not only continue through succeeding
life, but which glow to the last, with a tender <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

The propensity therefore is not to be discourage

pretended friendships of youth, are mere combi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ons
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
in pleasure. They are often founded on capr∣ious
likings; suddenly contracted, and as suddenly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issolved. Sometimes they are the effect of interested
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omplaisance and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lattery on the one side, and of cred∣lous
fondness on the other. Beware of such rash and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>angerous connections, which may afterwards load

any advantage by his prejudice or hurt. In
order to render yourselves amiable in society, correct
every appearance of harshness in behaviour. Let

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, not so much from studied politeness, as from
mild and gentle heart. Follow the customs of the
world in matters indifferent; but stop when they be∣come
sinful. Let your manners be simple and natural;
and of course they will be engaging. Affectation is
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertain deformity. By forming themselves on fantastic
models, and vying with one another in every reigning

<P>Diligence, industry, and proper improvement of
time, are material duties of the young. To no purpose
are they endowed with the best abilities, if they want
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tivity for exerting them. Unavailing, in this case,
will be every direction that can be given them, either <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
their temporal or spiritual welfare. In youth the
abits of industry are most easily acquired. In
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outh, the incentives to it are strongest, from ambi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on
and from duty, from emulation and hope, from
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the prospects which the beginning of life affords, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
dead to these calls, you already lauguish in sloth∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
inaction, what will be able to quicken the more
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uggish current of advancing years? Industroy
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
is not only the instrument of improvement, but the
foundation of pleasure. Nothing is so opposite to
the true enjoyment of life, as the relaxed and feeble
state of an indolent mind. He who is a stranger to
industry, may possess, but he cannot enjoy. For it is
labour only which gives the relish to pleasure. It
is the appointed vehicle of every good to man. It is
the indispensable condition of our possessing a sound
mind in a sound body. Sloth is so inconsistent with
both, that it is hard to determine whether it be a
greater foe to virtue, or to health and happiness. In∣active
as it is in itself, its effects are fatally power∣ful.
Though it appear a slowly flowing stream, yet i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
undermines all that is stable and flourishing. It not
only saps the foundation of every virtue, but pours
upon you a deluge of crimes and evils. It is like wa∣ter
which first putrifies by stagnation, and then send
up noxious vapours, and fills the atmosphere with
death. Fly, therefore, from idleness, as the
certain parent both of guilt and of ruin. And under
idleness I include, not mere inaction only, but all tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
circle of trifling occupations, in which too man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
saunter away their youth; perpetually engaged in
frivolous society, or public. amusements, in the la∣bours
of dress, or the ostentation of their persons.—
Is this the foundation which you lay for future useful∣ness
and esteem? By such accomplishments, do you
hope to recommend yourselves to the thinking part
of the world, and to answer the expectations of you
friends and your country?—Amusements, youth
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quires. It were vain, it were cruel to prohibit them▪
But though allowable as the relaxation, they are mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
culpable as the business, of the young. For they the
become the gulf of time, and the poison of the min<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
They foment bad passions. They weaken the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ly
powers. They sink the native vigour of you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
into contemptible effeminacy. Redceming you
time from such dangerous waste, seek to fill it with
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
employments which you may review with satisfac∣tion.
The acquisition of knowledge is one of the
most honourable occupations of youth. The desire
of it discovers a liberal mind, and is connected with
many accomplishments, and many virtues. But though
your train of life should not lead you to study, the
course of education always furnishes proper employ∣ments
to a well-disposed mind. Whatever you pursue,
be emulous to excel. Generous ambition, and sensibili∣ty
to praise, are, especially at your age, among the marks
of virtue. Think not, that any affluence of fortune, or any
elevation of rank, exempts you from the duties of ap∣plication
and industry. Industry is the law of our be∣ing;
it is the demand of Nature, of Reason, and of God.
Remember always, that the years which now pass over
your heads, leave permanent memorials behind them.
From your thoughtless minds they may escape;
but they remain in the remembrance of God. They
form an important part of the register of your life.
They will hereafter bear testimony, either for or a∣gainst
you, at that day, when, for all your actions, but
particularly for the employments of youth, you must
give an account to God-Thus I have set before
you some of the chief qualifications which belong
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a virtuous and ieligious character; piety, modes∣ty,
truth, benevolence, temperance, and industry.
Whether your future course is destined to be long or
short, after this manner it should commence; and, if it
continue to be thus conducted, its conclusion, at what
time soever it arrives, will not be inglorious or un∣happy.</P>
<P>Let your attention be recalled to that dependance
a the blessing of Heaven, which, amidst all your
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>deavours after improvement, you ought continu∣lly
to preserve. It is too common with the young,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven when they resolve to tread the path of virtue and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onour, to set out with presumptuous confidence in
themselves. Trusting to their own abilities for carry∣ing
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
them successfully through life, they are careless of
applying to God, or of deriving any assistance from
what they are apt to reckon the gloomy discipline of
religion. Alas! how little do they know the dange<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
which await them? Neither human wisdom, nor hu∣man
virtue, unsupported by religion, are equal to the the
trying situations which often occur in life. By the
shock, of temptation, how frequently have the most
virtuous intentions been overthrown? Under the pres∣sure
of disaster, how often has the greatest constancy
sunk.? <HI>Every good and every perfect gift, is from about.</HI>
Wisdom and virtue, as well as <HI>riches and honour, cent

situation, with all your boasted abilities, than orphar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
left to wander in a trackless desert, without any guide

Expect not, that your happiness can be inde∣pendent
of him who made you. By faith and repeat∣ance,
apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety
and prayer, seek the protection of the God of heaven.
In fine, remember the solemn words, in which a great
Prince delivered his dying charge to his son; word
which every young person ought to consider as ad∣dressed
to himself, and to engrave deeply on his heart.
<HI>Thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy fathers;
and serve hint with a perfect heart, and with a willing
mind. For the Lord searcheth all hearts, and underta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word∣eth

he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will
cast thee off for ever.</HI></P>
