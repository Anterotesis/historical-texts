THEATRE ROYAL,
IN

<PB REF="2"/>
<P>THIS little Drama, which had
been thrown aside for many years, was
brought out last season, with some altera∣tions,
for the benefit of Mr. KING, as a
token of regard for one, who, during
a long engagement, was never known,
unless confined by real illness, to disappoint
the Public, or distress the Managers—The
Author is sincerely apprehensive that the
excellence of the performance upon the
stage, will greatly lessen its credit with the
readers in the closet.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT is not, my dear, that I have the least regard for
my Lord; I had no love for him before I married him,
and you know, Matrimony is no breeder of affection;
but it hurts my pride, that he should neglect me, and
run after other women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, how can you be so hypocritical, Lady
Minikin, as to pretend to uneasiness at such trifles:
but pray have you made any new discoveries of my
Lord's gallantry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>New discoveries! why, I saw him myself yesterday
morning in a hackney coach, with a minx in a pink car∣dinal;
you shall absolutely burn your's, Tittup, for I
shall never bear to see one of that colour again.</P>
</SP>

<P>Sure she does not suspect me <STAGE>(aside).</STAGE> And where was
your Ladyship, pray, when you saw him?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Taking the air with Colonel Tivy in his Vis-a-Vis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear Lady Minikin, how can you be so angry
that my Lord was hurting your pride, as you call it, in
the hackney-coach, when you had him so much in your
power, in the Vis-a-Vis?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, with my Lord's friend, and my friend's lover!
<HI>(takes her by the hand)</HI> O fye, Tittup!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh, pooh, Love and Friendship are very fine names
to be sure, but they are mere visiting acquaintance; we
know their names indeed, talk of 'em sometimes, and let
'em knock at our doors, but we never let 'em in, you
know. <HI>(looking roguishly at her).</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I vow, Tittup, you are extremely polite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am extremely indifferent in these affairs, thanks to
my education—We must marry, you know, because
other people of fashion marry; but I should think very
meanly of myself, if after I was married, I should feel the
least concern at all about my husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hate to praise myself, and yet I may with truth aver,
that no woman of quality ever had, can have, or will
have, so consummate a contempt for her Lord, as I have
for my most honourable and puissant Earl of Minikin,
Viscount Perriwinkle, and Baron Titmouse—Ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it not strange, Lady Minikin, that merely his
being your husband, should create such indifference;
for certainly, in every other eye, his Lordship has great
accomplishments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accomplishments! thy head is certainly turn'd; if
you know any of 'em, pray let's have 'em; they are a
novelty, and will amuse me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>Imprimis, he is a man of quality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which, to be sure, includes all the cardinal virtues:—poor
girl!—go on!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a very handsome man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has a very bad constitution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has wit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a Lord, and a little goes a great way,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has great good nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No wonder—he's a fool.</P>

<P>And then his fortune, you'll allow—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was a great one—but he games, and if fairly, he's
undone; if not, he deserves to be hang'd—and so, Exit
my Lord Minikin—And now, let your wise uncle, and
my good cousin Sir John Trotley, Baronet, enter: Where
is he, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>In his own room, I suppose, reading pamphlets and
news-papers, against the enormities of the times; if he
stays here a week longer, notwithstanding my expecta∣tions
from him, I shall certainly affront him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a great favourite, but it is impossible much longer
to act up to his very righteous ideas of things;—Is'n't it
pleasant to hear him abuse every body, and every thing,
and yet always finishing with a—<HI>You'll excuse me,</HI> Cou∣sin?—Ha,
ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITTUP.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you think the Goth said to me yesterday?
one of the knots of his Tye hanging down his left
shoulder, and his fring'd cravat nicely twisted down his
breast, and thrust thro' his gold button hole, which
look'd exactly like my little Barbet's head in his gold
collar—Niece Tittup, cries he, drawing himself up, <HI>I
protest against this manner of conducting yourself, both at home
and abroad.</HI>—What are your objections, Sir John, an∣swered
I, a little pertly.—<HI>Various and manifold, reply'd
he; I have no time to enumerate particulars now, but I will
venture to prophecy, if you keep whirling round in the vortex
of Pantheons, Operas, Festinos, Coteries, Masquerades, and
all the Devilades in this town, your head will be giddy, down
you will fall, lose the name of Lucretia, and be call'd
nothing but Tittup ever after—Youll excuse me, cousin!</HI>—and
so he left me.</P>

<P>“Mrs. Pewitt's respects to Lady Minikin, and Miss
Tittup; hopes to have the pleasure of attending them,
to Lady Filligree's bali this evening.—Lady Daisey
sees masks.”—We'll certainly attend her—Gymp,
put some message cards upon my toilet, I'll send an an∣swer
immediately; and tell one of my footmen, that he
must make some visits for me to-day again, and send me
a list of those he made yesterday: he must be sure to call
at Lady Pettitoes, and if she shou'd unluckily be at home,
he must say that he came to inquire after her sprain'd
ancle.</P>

<P>Ay, ay, give our compliments to her sprain'd ancle.</P>

not finding her at home.—I am horridly low spirited to∣day,
do, send your Colonel to play at chess with me,

liking to him; I like every thing that loves my Titty.</P>

spirits, you must assist me to plague my Lord a little.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> TITT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and I'll plague my Lady a little, or I am much
mistaken: my Lord shall know every tittle that has passed:
what a poor, blind, half-witted, self-conceied creature,
this dear friend and relation of mine is! and what a fine
spirited gallant soldier my Colonel is! my Lady Mini∣kin
likes him, he likes my fortune; my Lord likes me,
and I like my Lord; however, not so much as he ima∣gines,
or to play the fool so rashly as he may expect; she
must be very silly indeed, who can't flutter about the
flame, without burning her wings—What a great re∣volution
in this family, in the space of fifteen months!
—we went out of England, a very aukward, regular,
good English family! but half a year in France, and a
winter passed in the warmer climate of Italy, have ripen'd
our minds to every refinement of ease, dissipation and
pleasure.</P>

<P>The world's at an end! here's fine work; here are
precious doings! this Lord is a pillar of the state too; no

what a friendand husband she is bless'd with!—let me
consider!—shou'd I tell the good woman of these pranks,
I may only make more mischief, and may hap, go near
to kill her, for she's as tender as she's virtuous;—poor
Lady! I'll e'en go and comfort her directly, endeavour
to draw her from the wickedness of this town into the
country, where she shall have reading, fowling, and fishing,
to keep up her spirits, and when I die, I will leave her that

<P>Don't urge it, Colonel; I can't think of coming home

Tittup.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Colonel</HI> TIVY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lady Minikin, you know my marriage with
your niece is only a secondary consideration; my first and
principal object is you—you, Madam!—therefore, my dear
Lady, give me your promise to leave the ball with me;
you must, Lady Minikin; a bold young fellow and a sol∣dier
as I am, ought not to be kept from plunder when
the town has capitulated.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it has not capitulated, and perhaps never will;
however, Colonel, since you are so furious, I must come
to terms, I think—Keep your eyes upon me at the ball,
I think I may expect that, and when I drop my handker∣chief,
'tis your signal for pursuing; I shall get home as
fast as I can, you may follow me as fast as you can; my
Lord and Tittup will be otherwise employ'd; Gymp will
let us in the back way—no, no, my heart misgives me!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>THERE is no bearing this! what a land are we in!
upon my word, Mr. Jessamy, you should look well to the
house, there are certainly rogues about it: for I did but
cross the way just now to the Pamphlet-shop, to buy a
touch of the times, and they have taken my hanger
from my side; ay, and had a pluck at my watch too,
but I heard of their tricks, and had it sew'd to my
pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JESSAMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be alarm'd, Sir John; 'tis a very common
thing, and if you will walk the streets without convoy,
you will be pick'd up by privateers of all kinds;
ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not be alarm'd when I am robb'd!—why, they might
have cut my throat with my own hanger; I shan't
sleep a wink all night; so pray lend me some weapon
of defence, for I am sure if they attack me in the open
street, they'll be with me at night again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JESSAMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll lend you my own sword, Sir John; but be assur'd
there's no danger; there's robbing and murder cry'd
every night under my window; but it no more dis∣turbs
me, than the ticking of my watch at my bed's-head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, be that as it will, I must be upon my
guard; what a dreadful place this is! but 'tis all owing
to the corruption of the times; the great folks game,
and the poor folks rob; no wonder that murder ensues;
sad, sad, sad!—well, let me but get over this night,
and I'll leave this den of thieves to-morrow; how
long will your Lord and Lady stay at this masking and
mummery before they come home?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JESSAMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis impossible to say the time, Sir; that merely depends
upon the spirits of the company and the nature of the
entertainment: for my own part, I generally make it
myself till four or five in the morning.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what the devil do you make one at these mas∣queradings?</P>

<P>Come, come, good folks, I see you are all confounded, I'll

<P>However appearances have condemn'd me, give me
