<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PReaching of Sermons is Speaking to a
few of Mankind: Printing of Books
is Talking to the whole World. The Par∣son
Prescribes himself, and addresses to the
particular Auditory with the Appellation of
<HI>My Brethren;</HI> but he that Prints a Book,
ought to Preface it with a <HI>Noverint Uni∣versi,</HI>
Know all Men by these Presents.</P>
<P>The proper Inference drawn from this re∣markable
Observation, is, That tho' he that
Preaches from the Pulpit ought to be careful
of his Words, that nothing pass from him
but with an especial Sanction of Truth;
yet he that Prints and Publishes to all the
World, has a tenfold Obligation.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
The Sermon is a Sound of Words spoken
to the Ear, and prepar'd only for present
Meditation, and extends no farther than the
strength of Memory can convey it; a Book
Printed is a Record, remaining in every
Man's Possession, always ready to renew its
Acquaintance with his Memory, and always
ready to be produc'd as an Authority or Vou∣cher
to any Reports he makes out of it, and
conveys its Contents for Ages to come, to the
Eternity of mortal Time, when the Author
is forgotten in his Grave.</P>
<P>If a Sermon be ill grounded, if the Prea∣cher
imposes upon us, he trespasses on a few;
but if a Book Printed obtrudes a Falshood,
if a Man tells a Lye in Print, he abuses
Mankind, and imposes upon the whole World,
he causes our Children to tell Lyes after us,
and their Children after them, to the End of
the World.</P>
<P>This Observation I thought good to make
by way of Preface, to let the World know,
that when I go about a Work in which I must
tell a great many Stories, which may in their
own nature seem incredible, and in which I
must expect a great part of Mankind will
<PB REF="4"/>
question the Sincerity of the Relator; I did
not do it without a particular sence upon me
of the proper Duty of an Historian, and the
abundant Duty laid on him to be very wary
what he conveys to Posterity.</P>
<P>I cannot be so ignorant of my own Intenti∣ons,
as not to know, that in many Cases I
shall act the Divine, and draw necessary pra∣ctical
Inferences from the extraordinary Re∣markables
of this Book, and some Digressi∣ons
which I hope may not be altogether useless
in this Case.</P>
<P>And while I pretend to a thing so solemn,
I cannot but premise I should stand convicted
of a double Imposture, to forge a Story, and
then preach Repentance to the Reader from a
Crime greater than that I would have him re∣pent
of: endeavouring by a Lye to correct
the Reader's Vices, and sin against Truth to
bring the Reader off from sinning against
Sence.</P>
<P>Ʋpon this score, tho' the Ʋndertaking be
very difficult among such an infinite variety
of Circumstances, to keep exactly within the
bounds of Truth; yet I have this positive
Assurance with me, that in all the subsequent
<PB REF="5"/>
Relation, if the least Mistake happen, it shall
not be mine.</P>
<P>If I judge right, 'Tis the Duty of an Hi∣storian
to set every thing in its own Light,
and to convey matter of fact upon its legiti∣mate
Authority, and no other: I mean thus,
(for I wou'd be as explicit as I can) That
where a Story is vouch'd to him with sufficient
Authority, he ought to give the World the
special Testimonial of its proper Voucher, or
else he is not just to the Story: and where it
comes without such sufficient Authority, he
ought to say so; otherwise he is not just to
himself. In the first Case he injures the Hi∣story,
by leaving it doubtful where it might
be confirm'd past all manner of question; in
the last he injures his own Reputation, by
taking upon himself the Risque, in case it
proves a Mistake, of having the World charge
him with a Forgery.</P>
<P>And indeed, I cannot but own 'tis just,
that if I tell a Story in Print for a Truth
which proves otherwise, unless I, at the same
time, give proper Caution to the Reader, by
owning the Ʋncertainty of my Knowledge in
<PB REF="6"/>
the matter of fact, 'tis I impose upon the
World; my Relater is innocent, and the Lye
is my own.</P>
<P>I make all these preliminary Observations,
partly to inform the Reader, that I have not
undertaken this Work without the serious
Consideration of what I owe to Truth, and
to Posterity; nor without a Sence of the ex∣traordinary
Variety and Novelty of the Rela∣tion.</P>
<P>I
am sensible, that the want of this Cauti∣on
is the Foundation of that great Misfor∣tune
we have in matters of ancient History;
in which the Impudence, the Ribaldry, the
empty Flourishes, the little Regard to Truth,
and the Fondness of telling a strange Story,
has dwindled a great many valuable Pieces
of ancient History into meer Romance.</P>
<P>How are the Lives of some of our most
famous Men, nay the Actions of whole Ages,
drowned in Fable? Not that there wanted
Pen-men to write, but that their Writings
were continually mixt with such Rhodomon∣tades
of the Authors that Posterity rejected
them as fabulous.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
From hence it comes to pass that Matters
of Fact are handed down to Posterity with
so little Certainty, that nothing is to be de∣pended
upon; from hence the uncertain Ac∣count
of Things and Actions in the remoter
Ages of the World, the confounding the Ge∣nealogies
as well as Atchievements of <HI>Belus,
Nimrod,</HI> and <HI>Nimrus,</HI> and their Succes∣sors,
the Histories and Originals of <HI>Saturn
Jupiter,</HI> and the rest of the Celestial
Rabble, who Mankind would have been a∣sham'd
to have call'd <HI>Gods,</HI> had they had
the true Account of their dissolute, exorbitant,
and inhumane Lives.</P>
<P>From Men we may descend to Action: and
this prodigious Looseness of the Pen has con∣founded
History and Fable from the begin∣ning
of both. Thus the great Flood in <HI>Deu∣calion</HI>'s
Time is made to pass for the Ʋni∣versal
Deluge: the Ingenuity of <HI>Dedalus,</HI>
who by a Clue of Thread got out of the <HI>Egy∣ptian</HI>
Maze, which was thought impossible,
is grown into a Fable of making himself a
pair of Wings, and flying through the Air:—the
great Drought and violent Heat of Sum∣mer,
thought to be the Time when the Great
<PB REF="8"/>
Famine was in <HI>Samaria,</HI> fabl'd by the Poets
and Historians into the Story of <HI>Phaeton</HI>
borrowing the Chariot of the Sun, and giving
the Horses their Heads, they run so near the
Earth as burnt up all the nearest Parts, and
scorch'd the Inhabitants, so that they have
been black in those Parts ever since.</P>
<P>These, and such like ridiculous Stuff, have
been the Effects of the Pageantry of Histori∣ans
in former Ages: and I might descend
nearer home, to the Legends of Fabulous Hi∣story
which have swallow'd up the Actions of
our a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient Predecessors, King <HI>Arthur,</HI> the
Gyant <HI>Gogmagog,</HI> and the <HI>Britain,</HI> the
Stories of St. <HI>George</HI> and the <HI>Dragon, Guy</HI>
Earl of <HI>Warwick, Bevis</HI> of <HI>Southamp∣ton,</HI>
and the like.</P>
<P>I'll account for better Conduct in the ensu∣ing
History: and tho' some Things here re∣lated
shall have equal Wonder due to them,
Posterity shall not have equal Occasion to dis∣trust
the Verity of the Relation.</P>
<P>I confess here is room for abundance of
Romance, because the Subject may be safer
extended than in any other case, no Story being
capable to be crowded with such Circumstan∣ces,
<PB REF="9"/>
but Infinite Power, which is all along
concern'd with us in every Relation, is sup∣pos'd
capable of making true.</P>
<P>Yet we shall no where so Trespass upon
Fact, as to oblige Infinite Power to the shew∣ing
more Miracles than it intended.</P>
<P>It must be allow'd, That when Nature
was put into so much Confusion, and the Sur∣face
of the Earth and Sea felt such extraordi∣nary
a Disorder, innumerable Accidents would
fall out that till the like Occasion happen may
never more be seen, and unless a like Occasion
had happen'd could never before be heard of:
wherefore the particular Circumstances being
so wonderful, serve but to remember Posteri∣ty
of the more wonderful Extreme, which was
the immediate Cause.</P>
<P>The Ʋses and Application made from this
Terrible Doctrine, I leave to the Men of the
Pulpit; only take the freedom to observe, that
when Heaven it self lays down the Doctrine,
all Men are summon'd to make Applications
by themselves.</P>
<P>The main Inference I shall pretend to make
or at least venture the exposing to publick
View, in this case, is, the strong Evidence
<PB REF="10"/>
God has been pleas'd to give in this terrible
manner to his own Being, which Mankind
began more than ever to affront and despise:
And I cannot but have so much Charity for
the worst of my Fellow-Creatures, that I be∣lieve
no Man was so hard'ned against the
Sence of his Maker, but he felt some Shocks
of his wicked Confidence from the Convulsions
of Nature at this time.</P>
<P>I cannot believe any Man so rooted in A∣theistical
Opinions, as not to find some Cause
to doubt whether he was not in the Wrong,
and a little to apprehend the Possibility of a
Supreme Being, when he felt the terrible Blasts
of this Tempest. I cannot doubt but the A∣theist's
hard'ned Soul trembl'd a little as well
as his House, and he felt some Nature asking
him some little Questions; as these—<HI>Am not
I mistaken? Certainly there is some such
thing as a God—What can all this be?
What is the Matter in the World?</HI></P>
<P>Certainly Atheism is one of the most Irra∣tional
Principles in the World; there is some∣thing
incongruous in it with the Test of Hu∣mane
Policy, because there is a Risque in the
Mistake one way, and none another. If the
<PB REF="11"/>
Christian is mistaken, and it should at last ap∣pear
that there is no Future State, God or
Devil, Reward or Punishment, where is the
Harm of it? All he has lost is, that he has
practis'd a few needless Mortifications, and
took the pains to live a little more like a Man
than he wou'd have done. But if the Atheist
is mistaken, he has brought all the Powers,
whose Being he deny'd, upon his Back, has
provok'd the Infinite in the highest manner,
and must at last sink under the Anger of him
whose Nature he has always disown'd.</P>
<P>I would recommend this Thought to any
Man to consider of, one Way he can loose
nothing, the other he may be undone. Cer∣tainly
a wise Man would never run such an
unequal Risque: a Man cannot answer it to
Common Arguments, the Law of Numbers,
and the Rules of Proportion are against him.
No Gamester will set at such a Main; no
Man will lay such a Wager, where he may
lose, but cannot win.</P>
<P>There is another unhappy Misfortune in
the Mistake too, that it can never be disco∣ver'd
till'tis too late to remedy. He that re∣solves
to die an Atheist, shuts the Door a∣gainst
being convinc'd in time.</P>
<P><PB REF="12"/>
If it shou'd so fall out, as who can tell,
But that there is a God, a Heaven, and
Hell,
Mankind had best consider well for Fear,
't should be too late when his Mistakes
appear.</P>
<P>I should not pretend to set up for an In∣structor
in this Case, were not the Inference
so exceding just; who can but preach where
there is such a Text? when God himself
speaks his own Power, he expects we should
draw just Inferences from it, both for our
Selves and our Friends.</P>
<P>If one Man, in an Hundred Years, shall
arrive at a Conviction of the Being of his
Maker, 'tis very well worth my While to write
it, and to bear the Character of an imperti∣nent
Fellow from all the rest.</P>
<P>I thought to make some Apology for the
Meanness of Stile, and the Method, which
may be a little unusual, of Printing Letters
from the Country in their own Stile.</P>
<P>For the last I only leave this short Reason
with the Reader, the Desire I had to keep
<PB REF="13"/>
close to the Truth, and hand my Relation with
the true Authorities from whence I receiv'd it,
together with some Justice to the Gentlemen
concern'd, who, especially in Cases of Delive∣rances,
are willing to record the Testimonial
of the Mercies they received, and to set their
Hands to the humble Acknowledgment. The
Plainness and Honesty of the Story will plead
for the Meanness of the Stile in many of the
Letters, and the Reader cannot want Eyes to
see what sort of People some of them come
from.</P>
<P>Others speak for themselves, and being
writ by Men of Letters, as well as Men of
Principles, I have not Arrogance enough to
attempt a Correction either of the Sense or
Stile; and if I had gone about it, should
have injur'd both Author and Reader.</P>
<P>These come dressed in their own Words be∣cause
I ought not, and those because I could not
mend 'em. I am perswaded, they are all dress'd
in the desirable, though unfasnionable Garb
of Truth, and I doubt not but Posterity will
read them with Pleasure.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen, who have taken the Pains
to collect and transmit the Particular Relations
<PB REF="14"/>
bere made pubick, I hope will have their End
answered in this Essay, conveying hereby to
the Ages to come the Memory of the dreadfulest
and most universal Judgment that ever Al∣mighty
Power thought fit to bring upon this
Part of the World.</P>
<P>And as this was the true Native and Ori∣ginal
Design of the first Ʋndertaking, abstra∣cted
from any Part of the Printer's Advan∣tage,
the Editor and Ʋndertakers of this
Work, having their Ends entirely answer'd,
hereby give their humble Thanks to all those
Gentlemen who have so far approv'd the Sin∣cerity
of their Design as to contribute their
Trouble, and help forward by their just Ob∣servations,
the otherwise very difficult Ʋnder∣taking.</P>
<P>If
Posterity will but make the desired Im∣provement
both of the Collector's Pains, as
well as the several Gentlemens Care in furnish∣ing
the Particulars, I dare say they will all
acknowledge their End fully answer'd, and
none more readily than</P>

<HEAD>THE
STORM.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Natural Causes and Original of Winds.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH a System of Exhalation,
Dilation, and Extension, things
which the Ancients founded the Do∣ctrine
of Winds upon, be not my di∣rect
Business; yet it cannot but be needful to
the present Design to Note, that the Difference
in the Opinions of the Ancients, about the Na∣ture
and Original of Winds, is a Leading Step to
one Assertion which I have advanc'd in all that
I have said with Relation to Winds, <HI>viz.</HI> That
there seems to be more of God in the whole
Appearance, than in any other Part of Ope∣rating
Nature.</P>
<P>Nor do I think I need explain my self very
far in this Notion: I allow the high Origi∣nal
<PB N="2" REF="16"/>
of Nature to be the Great Author of
all her Actings, and by the strict Rein of his
Providence, is the Continual and Exact Guide
of her Executive Power; but still 'tis plain
that in Some of the Principal Parts of Nature
she is Naked to our Eye, Things appear both
in their Causes and Consequences, Demon∣stration
gives its Assistance, and finishes our
further Enquiries: for we never enquire after
God in those Works of Nature which depend∣ing
upon the Course of Things are plain and
demonstrative; but where we find Nature de∣fective
in her Discovery, where we see Effects
but cannot reach their Causes; there 'tis most
just, and Nature her self seems to direct us to
it, to end the rational Enquiry, and resolve
it into Speculation: Nature plainly refers us
beyond her Self, to the Mighty Hand of Infi∣nite
Power, the Author of Nature, and Ori∣ginal
of all Causes.</P>
<P>Among these Arcana of the Sovereign Oe∣conomy,
the Winds are laid as far back as any.
Those Ancient Men of Genius who rifled Na∣ture
by the Torch-Light of Reason even to
her very Nudities, have been run a-ground in
this unknown Channel; the Wind has blown
out the Candle of Reason, and left them all
in the Dark.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle,</HI> in his Problems, Sect. 23. calls the
Wind <HI>Aeris Impulsum. Seneca</HI> says, <HI>Ventus est
Aer Fluens.</HI> The <HI>Stoicks</HI> held it, <HI>Motum aut
Fluxienem Aeris.</HI> Mr. <HI>Hobs,</HI> Air mov'd in a
<PB N="3" REF="17"/>
direct or undulating Motion. Fournier, <HI>LeVent
et un Movement Agitation de l' Air Causi par des
Exhalations et Vapours.</HI> The Moderns, a Hot
and Dry Exhalation repuls'd by Antiperista∣sis;
<HI>Des Cartes</HI> defines it, <HI>Venti Nihil sunt nisi
Moti &amp; Dilati Vapores.</HI> And various other Opi∣nions
are very judiciously collected by the
Learned Mr. <HI>Bohun</HI> in his Treatise of the
Origin and Properties of Wind, P. 7. and
concludes, <HI>'That no one Hypothesis, how Compre∣hensive
soever, has yet been able to resolve all the
Incident Phaenomena of Winds.</HI> Bohun <HI>of
Winds,</HI> P. 9.</P>
<P>This is what I quote them for, and this is
all my Argument demands; the deepest Search
into the Region of Cause and Consequence,
has found out just enough to leave the wisest
Philosopher in the dark, to bewilder his Head,
and drown his Understanding. You raise
a Storm in Nature by the very Inquiry; and
at last, to be rid of you, she confesses the
Truth, and tells you, <HI>It is not in Me, you must
go Home and ask my Father.</HI></P>
<P>Whether then it be the Motion of Air, and
what that Air is, <HI>which as yet is underfin'd,</HI> whe∣ther
it is a Dilation, a previous Contraction,
and then violent Extension as in Gun-Powder,
whether the Motion is Direct, Circular, or Ob∣lique,
whether it be an Exhalation repuls'd by
the Middle Region, and the Antiperistasis
of that Part of the Heavens which is set as a
Wall of Brass to bind up the Atmosphere,
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
and keep it within its proper Compass for the
Functions of Respiration Condensing and
Rarifying, without which Nature would be
all in Confusion; whatever are their efficient
Causes, 'tis not much to the immediate Design.</P>
<P>'Tis apparent, that God Almighty, whom the
Philosophers care as little as possible to have
any thing to do with, seems to have reserv'd
this, as one of those Secrets in Nature which
should more directly guide them to himself.</P>
<P>Not but that a Philosopher may be a Chri∣stian,
and some of the best of the Latter have
been the best of the Former, as <HI>Vossius,</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI>
Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> Lord <HI>Verulam,</HI> Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI>
and others; and I wish I could say Mr. <HI>Hobbs,</HI>
for 'twas Pity there should lie any just Ex∣ceptions
to the Piety of a Man, who had so
few to his General Knowledge, and an exal∣ted
Spirit in Philosophy.</P>
<P>When therefore I say the Philosophers do
not care to concern God himself in the Search
after Natural Knowledge; I mean, as it con∣cerns
Natural Knowledge, <HI>meerly as such;</HI> for
'tis a Natural Cause they seek, from a General
Maxim, That all Nature has its Cause within
it self: 'tis true, 'tis the Darkest Part of the
Search, to trace the Chain backward; to begin
at the Consequence, and from thence <HI>hunt
Counter,</HI> as we may call it, to find out the
Cause: 'twould be much easier if we could
begin at the Cause, and trace it to all its Con∣sequences.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="19"/>
I make no Question, the Search would be
equally to the Advantage of Science, and the
Improvement of the World; for without
Doubt there are some Consequences of known
Causes which are not yet discover'd, and I am
as ready to believe there are yet in Nature
some <HI>Terra Incognita</HI> both as to Cause and
Consequence too.</P>
<P>In this Search after Causes, the Philoso∣pher,
tho' he may at the same Time be a very
good Christian, cares not at all to meddle
with his Maker: the Reason is plain; We
may at any time resolve all things into Infinite
Power, and we do allow that the Finger of
Infinite is the First Mighty Cause of Nature
her self: but the Treasury of Immediate Cause
is generally committed to Nature; and if at
any Time we are driven to look beyond her, 'tis
because we are out of the way: 'tis not be∣cause
it is not in her, but because we cannot
find it.</P>
<P>Two Men met in the Middle of a great
Wood; One was searching for a Plant which
grew in the Wood, the Other had lost him∣self
in the Wood, and wanted to get out:
The Latter rejoyc'd when thro' the Trees he
saw the open Country; but the Other Man's
Business was not to get out, but to find what
he look'd for: yet this Man no more under∣valued
the Pleasantness of the Champion
Country than the other.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="20"/>
Thus in Nature the Philosopher's Business
is not to look through Nature, and come to
the vast open Field of Infinite Power; his
Business is in the Wood; there grows the
Plant he looks for; and 'tis there he must find
it. Philosophy's a-ground if it is forc'd to
any further Enquiry. The Christian begins
just where the Philosopher ends; and when
the Enquirer turns his Eyes up to Heaven,
Farewel Philosopher; 'tis a Sign he can make
nothing of it here.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> was a good Man, the Scripture gives
him that Testimony; but I am of the Opini∣on,
he was a better King than a Scholar, more
a Saint than a Philosopher: and it seems very
proper to judge that <HI>David</HI> was upon the Search
of Natural Causes, and found himself puzzled
as to the Enquiry, when he finishes the En∣quiry
with two pious Ejaculations, <HI>When I view
the Heavens the Works of thy Hands, the Moon
and the Stars which thou hast made; then I say,
what is Man! David</HI> may very rationally
be suppos'd to be searching the Causes, Mo∣tions,
and Influences of Heavenly Bodies;
and finding his Phyilosophy a-ground, and
the Discovery not to answer his Search, he
turns it all to a pious Use, recognizes Infinite
Power, and applies it to the Exstasies and
Raptures of his Soul, which were always em∣ploy'd
in the Charm of exalted Praise.</P>
<P>Thus in another Place we find him diffecting
the Womb of his Mother, and deep in the
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>
Study of Anatomy; but having as it may be
well supposed, no Help from <HI>Johan Remelini,</HI>
or of the Learned <HI>Riolanus,</HI> and other Ana∣tomists,
famous for the most exquisite Disco∣very
of human Body, and all the Vessels of
Life, with their proper Dimensions and Use,
all <HI>David</HI> could say to the Matter was, <HI>Good
Man,</HI> to look up to Heaven, and admire what
he could not understand, <HI>Psal.—I was
fearfully and wonderfully made,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is very Good, and well becomes a Pul∣pit;
but what's all this to a Philosopher? 'Tis
not enough for him to know that God has
made the Heavens, the Moon, and the
Stars, but must inform himself where he has
plac'd them, and why there; and what their
Business, what their Influences, their Functi∣ons,
and the End of their Being. 'Tis not
enough for an Anatomist to know that he is
fearfully and wonderfully made in the lower∣most
Part of the Earth, but he must see those
lowermost Parts; search into the Method Na∣ture
proceeds upon in the performing the Of∣fice
appointed, must search the Steps she takes,
the Tools she works by; and in short, know
all that the God of Nature has permitted to
be capable of Demonstration.</P>
<P>And it seems a just Authority for our
Search, that some things are so plac'd in Na∣ture
by a Chain of Causes and Effects, that
upon a diligent Search we may find out what
we look for: To search after what God has
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
in his Sovereignty thought fit to conceal,
may be criminal, and doubtless is so; and the
Fruitlesness of the Enquiry is generally Part
of the Punishment to a vain Curiosity: but
to search after what our Maker has not hid,
only cover'd with a thin Veil of Natural Ob∣scurity,
and which upon our Search is plain
to be read, seems to be justified by the very
Nature of the thing, and the Possibility of the
Demonstration is an Argument to prove the
Lawfulness of the Enquiry.</P>
<P>The Design of this Digression, is, in
short, That as where Nature is plain to be
search'd into, and Demonstration easy, the
Philosopher is allow'd to seek for it; so where
God has, as it were, laid his Hand upon any
Place, and Nature presents us with an univer∣sal
Blank, we are therein led as naturally to
recognize the Infinite Wisdom and Power of
the God of Nature, as <HI>David</HI> was in the Texts
before quoted.</P>
<P>And this is the Case here; the Winds are
some of those Inscrutables of Nature, in which
humane Search has not yet been able to arrive
at any Demonstration.</P>
<P>“The Winds, <HI>says the Learned Mr.</HI> Bohun,
are generated in the Intermediate Space be∣tween
the Earth and the Clouds, either by
Rarefaction or Repletion, and sometimes
haply by pressure of Clouds Elastical Vir∣tue
of the Air, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the Earth or Seas,
as by Submarine or Subterraneal Eruption or
<PB N="9" REF="23"/>
Descension or Resilition from the middle
Region.”</P>
<P>All this, though no Man is more capable
of the Enquiry than this Gentleman, yet to
the Demonstration of the thing, amounts to
no more than what we had before, and still
leaves it as Abstruse and Cloudy to our Un∣derstanding
as ever.</P>
<P>Not but that I think my self bound in Du∣ty
to Science in General, to pay a just Debt to
the Excellency of Philosophical Study, in
which I am a meer Junior, and hardly any
more than an Admirer; and therefore I can∣not
but allow that the Demonstrations made
of Rarefaction and Dilatation are extraordi∣nary;
and that by Fire and Water Wind may
be rais'd in a close Room, as the Lord <HI>Ve∣rulam</HI>
made Experiment in the Case of his Fea∣thers.</P>
<P>But that therefore all the Causes of Wind
are from the Influences of the Sun upon va∣porous
Matter first Exhal'd, which being Di∣lated
are oblig'd to possess themselves of more
Space than before, and consequently make the
Particles fly before them; this does not seem
to be a sufficient Demonstration of Wind:
for this, to my weak Apprehension, would
rather make a Blow like Gun-Powder than a
rushing forward; at best this is indeed a
probable Conjecture, but admits not of De∣monstration
equal to other Phaenomena in
Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="24"/>
And this is all I am upon, <HI>viz.</HI> That this
Case has not equal Proofs of the Natural Cau∣ses
of it that we meet with in other Cases:
The Scripture seems to confirm this, when it
says in one Place, <HI>He holds the Wind in his
Hand;</HI> as if he should mean, Other things are
left to the Common Discoveries of Natural
Inquiry, but this is a thing he holds in his
own Hand, and has conceal'd it from the Search
of the most Diligent and Piercing Understand∣ing:
This is further confirm'd by the Words
of our Saviour, <HI>The Wind blows where it list∣eth,
and thou hearest the Sound thereof, but
knowest not whence it cometh;</HI> 'tis plainly ex∣press'd
to signify that the Causes of the Wind
are not equally discover'd by Natural Enquiry
as the rest of Nature is.</P>
<P>If I would carry this Matter on, and travel
into the Seas, and Mountains of <HI>America,</HI>
where the Mansones, the Trade-Winds, the
Sea-Breezes, and such Winds as we have little
Knowledge of, are more common; it would
yet more plainly appear, <HI>That me hear the
Sound, but know not from whence they come.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is the Cause of their Motion parallel
to the Surface of the Earth, a less Mystery
than their real Original, or the Difficulty of
their Generation: and though some People
have been forward to prove the Gravity of
the Particles must cause the Motion to be ob∣lique;
'tis plain it must be very little so, or
else Navigation would be impracticable, and
<PB N="11" REF="25"/>
in extroardinary Cases where the Pressure a∣bove
is perpendicular, it has been fatal to
Ships, Houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and would have terrible
Effects in the World, if it should more fre∣quently
be so.</P>
<P>From this I draw only this Conclusion, That
the Winds are a Part of the Works of God
by Nature, in which he has been pleased to
communicate less of Demonstration to us than
in other Cases; that the Particulars more di∣rectly
lead us to Speculations, and refer us to
Infinite Power more than the other Parts of
Nature does.</P>
<P>That the Wind is more expressive and
adapted to his Immediate Power, as he is
pleas'd to exert it in extraordinary Cases in
the World.</P>
<P>That 'tis more frequently made use of as
the Executioner of his Judgments in the
World, and extraordinary Events are brought
to pass by it.</P>
<P>From these three Heads we are brought
down directly to speak of the Particular Storm
before us; <HI>viz.</HI> The Greatest, the Longest in
Duration, the widest in Extent, of all the
Tempests and Storms that History gives any
Account of since the Beginning of Time.</P>
<P>In the further Conduct of the Story, 'twill
not be foreign to the Purpose, nor unprofita∣ble
to the Reader, to review the Histories of
ancient Time and remote Countries, and exa∣mine
in what Manner God has been pleas'd to
<PB N="12" REF="26"/>
execute his Judgments by Storms and Tem∣pests;
what kind of things they have been,
and what the Consequences of them; and
then bring down the Parallel to the Dreadful
Instance before us.</P>
<P>We read in the Scripture of Two Great
Storms; One past, and the Other to come.
Whether the last be not Allegorical rather
than Prophetical, I shall not busie my self to
determine.</P>
<P>The First was when God caused a strong
Wind to blow upon the Face of the Delug'd
World; to put a stop to the Flood, and re∣duce
the Waters to their proper Channel.</P>
<P>I wish our Naturalists would explain that
Wind to us, and tell us which way it blew,
or how it is possible that any direct Wind
could cause the Waters to ebb; for to me it
seems, that the Deluge being universal, that
Wind which blew the Waters from one Part
must blow them up in another.</P>
<P>Whether it was not some perpendicular
Gusts that might by their Force separate the
Water and the Earth, and cause the Water
driven from off the Land to <HI>subside</HI> by its own
Pressure.</P>
<P>I shall dive no farther into that mysterious
Deluge, which has some things in it which
recommend the Story rather to our Faith than
Demonstration.</P>
<P>The Other Storm I find in the Scripture is
in the <HI>God shall rain upon the Wick∣ed,
<PB N="13" REF="27"/>
Plagues, Fire, and a horrible Tempest.</HI> What
this shall be, we wait to know; and happy
are they who shall be secured from its Effects.</P>
<P>Histories are full of Instances of violent
Tempests and Storms in sundry particular Pla∣ces.
What that was, which mingled with
such violent Lightnings set the Cities of <HI>So∣dom</HI>
and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> on fire, remains to me yet
undecided: nor am I satisfied the Effect it had
on the Waters of the Lake, which are to this
Day call'd the <HI>Dead Sea,</HI> are such as some fa∣bulous
Authors have related, and as Travel∣lers
take upon them to say.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Opinion of the Ancients, That this
Island was more subject ot Storms than
other Parts of the World.</HEAD>
<P>I Am not of Opinion with the early Ages of
the World, when these Islands were first
known, that they were the most Terrible of
any Part of the World for Storms and Tem∣pests.</P>
<P><HI>Cambden</HI>
tells us, The <HI>Britains</HI> were distin∣guish'd
from all the World by unpassable Seas
and terrible Northern Winds, which made the
<HI>Albion</HI> Shores dreadful to Sailors; and this
<PB N="14" REF="28"/>
part of the World was therefore reckoned the
utmost Bounds of the Northern known Land,
beyond which none had ever sailed: and
quotes a great variety of ancient Authors to
this purpose; some of which I present as a
Specimen.</P>
<P>Et Penitus Toto Divisos Orbe Britannos.</P>
<P>Britain'<HI>s disjoyn'd from all the well known World.</HI></P>
<Q>Quem Littus adusta,

Ignotum{que} Fretum.</Q>
<BIBL>Claud.</BIBL>
<P>And if the Notions the World then had
were true, it would be very absurd for us who
live here to pretend Miracles in any Extremes
of Tempests; since by what the Poets of those
Ages flourish'd about stormy Weather, was
the native and most proper Epithet of the
Place:</P>
<Q><L>Belluosus qui remotis</L>
<L>Obstrepit Oceanus <HI>Britannis.</HI></L></Q>
<BIBL>Hor.</BIBL>
<P>Nay, some are for placing the Nativity of
the Winds hereabouts, as if they had been all
generated here, and the Confluence of Matter
had made this Island its General Rendezvouz.</P>
<P>But I shall easily show, that there are seve∣ral
Places in the World far better adapted to
be the General Receptacle or Centre of Va∣pours,
to supply a Fund of Tempestuous Mat∣ter,
than <HI>England;</HI> as particularly the vast
<PB N="15" REF="29"/>
Lakes of <HI>North America:</HI> Of which after∣wards.</P>
<P>And
yet I have two Notions, one real, one
imaginary, of the Reasons which gave the
Ancients such terrible Apprehensions of this
Part of the World; which of late we find as
Habitable and Navigable as any of the rest.</P>
<P>The real Occasion I suppose thus: That
before the Multitude and Industry of Inhabi∣tants
prevail'd to the managing, enclosing,
and improving the Country, the vast Tract of
Land in this Island which continually lay
open to the Flux of the Sea, and to the Inun∣dations
of Land-Waters, were as so many
standing Lakes; from whence the Sun conti∣nually
exhaling vast quantities of moist Va∣pours,
the Air could not but be continually
crowded with all those Parts of necessary Mat∣ter
to which we ascribe the Original of Winds,
Rains, Storms, and the like.</P>
<P>He that is acquainted with the Situation of
<HI>England,</HI> and can reflect on the vast Quanti∣ties
of flat Grounds, on the Banks of all our
navigable Rivers, and the Shores of the Sea,
which Lands at least lying under Water every
Spring-Tide, and being thereby continually
full of moisture, were like a stagnated stand∣ing
body of Water brooding Vapours in the
Interval of the Tide, must own that at least a
fifteenth part of the whole Island may come
into this Denomination.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="30"/>
Let him that doubts the Truth of this, exa∣mine
a little the Particulars; let him stand
upon <HI>Shooters-Hill</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and view the
Mouth of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> and consider
what a River it must be when none of the
Marshes on either side were wall'd in from the
Sea, and when the Sea without all question
flow'd up to the Foot of the Hills on either
Shore, and up every Creek, where he must
allow is now dry Land on either side the River
for two Miles in breadth at least, sometimes
three or four, for above forty Miles on both
sides the River.</P>
<P>Let him farther reflect, how all these Parts
lay when, as our ancient Histories relate, the
<HI>Danish</HI> Fleet came up almost to <HI>Hartford;</HI> so
that all that Range of fresh Marshes which
reach for twenty five Miles in length, from
<HI>Ware</HI> to the River <HI>Thames,</HI> must be a Sea.</P>
<P>In short, Let any such considering Person
imagine the vast Tract of Marsh-Lands on both
sides the River <HI>Thames,</HI> to <HI>Harwich</HI> on the <HI>Es∣sex</HI>
side, and to <HI>Whitstable</HI> on the <HI>Kentish</HI> side,
the Levels of Marshes up the <HI>Stour</HI> from <HI>Sand∣wich</HI>
to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the whole Extent of Low∣grounds
commonly call'd <HI>Rumney-Marsh,</HI> from
<HI>Hythe</HI> to <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> and up the Banks of the
<HI>Rother;</HI> all which put together, and being al∣low'd
to be in one place cover'd with Water,
what a Lake wou'd it be suppos'd to make?
According to the nicest Calculations I can
make, it cou'd not amount to less than 500000
Acres of Land.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="31"/>
The Isle of <HI>Ely,</HI> with the <HI>Flats</HI> up the se∣veral
Rivers from <HI>Yarmouth</HI> to <HI>Norwich, Bec∣cles,
&amp;c.</HI> the continu'd Levels in the several
Counties of <HI>Norfolk, Cambridge, Suffolk, Hun∣tingdon,
Northampton,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> I believe
do really contain as much Land as the whole
County of <HI>Norfolk;</HI> and 'tis not many Ages
since these Countries were universally one vast
Moras or Lough, and the few solid parts whol∣ly
unapproachable: insomuch that the Town
of <HI>Ely</HI> it self was a Receptacle for the Male∣contents
of the Nation, where no reasonable
Force cou'd come near to dislodge them.</P>
<P>'Tis needless to reckon up twelve or four∣teen
like Places in <HI>England,</HI> as the Moores in
<HI>Somersetshire,</HI> the Flat-shores in <HI>Lancashire,
Yorkshire,</HI> and <HI>Durham,</HI> the like in <HI>Hampshire</HI>
and <HI>Sussex;</HI> and in short, on the Banks of eve∣ry
Navigable River.</P>
<P>The sum of the matter is this; That while
this Nation was thus full of standing Lakes,
stagnated Waters, and moist Places, the mul∣titude
of Exhalations must furnish the Air
with a quantity of Matter for Showers and
Storms infinitely more than it can be now sup∣ply'd
withal, those vast Tracts of Land being
now fenc'd off, laid dry, and turn'd into whol∣some
and profitable Provinces.</P>
<P>This seems demonstrated from <HI>Ireland,</HI> where
the multitude of Loughs, Lakes, Bogs, and
moist Places, serve the Air with Exhalations,
which give themselves back again in Showers,
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>
and make it be call'd, <HI>The Piss-pot of the
World.</HI></P>
<P>The imaginary Notion I have to advance
on this Head, amounts only to a Reflection
upon the Skill of those Ages in the Art of Na∣vigation;
which being far short of what it is
since arrived to, made these vast Northern
Seas too terrible for them to venture in: and
accordingly, they rais'd those Apprehensions
up to Fable, which began only in their want
of Judgment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> who were our first Naviga∣tors,
the <HI>Genoese,</HI> and after them the <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI>
who arriv'd to extraordinary Proficien∣cy
in Sea Affairs, were yet all of them, <HI>as we
say,</HI> Fair-weather Sea-men: The chief of their
Navigation was Coasting; and if they were
driven out of their Knowledge, had work
enough to find their way home, and sometimes
never found it at all; but one Sea convey'd
them directly into the last Ocean, from whence
no Navigation cou'd return them.</P>
<P>When these, by Adventures, or Misadven∣tures
rather, had at any time extended their
Voyaging as far as this Island, which, by the
way, they always perform'd round the Coast
of <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> if ever such
a Vessel return'd, if ever the bold Navigator
arriv'd at home, he had done enough to talk
on all his Days, and needed no other Diversi∣on
among his Neighbours, than to give an Ac∣count
of the vast Seas, mighty Rocks, deep Gulfs,
<PB N="19" REF="33"/>
and prodigious Storms he met with in these re∣mote
Parts of the known World: and this, mag∣nified
by the Poetical Arts of the Learned Men
of those times, grew into a receiv'd Maxim
of Navigation, That these Parts were so full
of constant Tempests, Storms, and dangerous
Seas, that 'twas present Death to come near
them, and none but Madmen and Desperadoes
could have any Business there, since they were
Places where Ships never came, and Naviga∣tion
was not proper in the Place.</P>
<Q><L>And <HI>Thule,</HI> where no Passage was</L>
<L>For Ships their Sails to bear.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Horace</HI> has reference to this horrid Part of
the World, as a Place full of terrible Mon∣sters,
and fit only for their Habitation, in the
Words before quoted.</P>
<Q><L>Belluosus qui remotis</L>
<L>Obstrepit Oceanus Britannis.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Juvenal</HI> follows his Steps;</P>
<Q>Quanto Delphino Balaena Britannica major.</Q>
<BIBL>Juv.</BIBL>
<P>Such horrid Apprehensions those Ages had
of these Parts, which by our Experience, and
the Prodigy to which Navigation in particu∣lar,
and Sciential Knowledge in general, is since
grown, appear very ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="34"/>
For we find no Danger in our Shores, no un∣certain
wavering in our Tides no frightful Gulfs,
no horrid Monsters, but what the bold Mariner
has made familiar to him. The Gulfs which
frighted those early Sons of <HI>Neptune</HI> are search'd
out by our Seamen, and made useful Bays,
Roads, and Harbours of Safety. The Pro∣montories
which running out into the Sea
gave them terrible Apprehensions of Danger,
are our Safety, and make the Sailors Hearts
glad, as they are the first Lands they make
when they are coming Home from a long Voy∣age,
or as they are a good shelter when in a
Storm our Ships get <HI>under their Lee.</HI></P>
<P>Our Shores are founded, the Sands and Flats
are discovered, which they knew little or no∣thing
of, and in which more real Danger lies,
than in all the frightful Stories they told us;
useful Sea-marks and Land-figures are plac'd on
the Shore, Buoys on the Water, Light-houses
on the highest Rocks; and all these dreadful
Parts of the World are become the Seat of
Trade, and the Centre of Navigation: Art has
reconcil'd all the Difficulties, and Use made
all the <HI>Horribles</HI> and <HI>Terribles</HI> of those Ages
become as natural and familiar as Day-light.</P>
<P>The Hidden Sands, almost the only real
Dread of a Sailor, and by which till the Chan∣nels
between them were found out, our Eastern
Coast must be really unpassable, now serve
to make Harbours: and <HI>Yar mouth</HI> Road was
made a safe Place for Shipping by them. Nay,
<PB N="21" REF="35"/>
when <HI>Portsmouth, Plymouth,</HI> and other good
Harbours would not defend our Ships in the
Violent Tempest we are treating of, here was
the least Damage done of any Place in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
considering the Number of Ships
which lay at Anchor, and the Openness of
the Place.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole it seems plain to
me, that all the dismal things the Ancients
told us of <HI>Britain,</HI> and her terrible Shores, a∣rose
from the Infancy of Marine Knowledge,
and the Weakness of the Sailor's Courage.</P>
<P>Not but that I readily allow we are more
subject to bad Weather and hard Gales of
Wind than the Coasts of <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> and
<HI>Barbary:</HI> But if this be allow'd, our Improve∣ment
in the Art of Building Ships is so consi∣derable,
our Vessels are so prepar'd to ride out
the most violent Storms, that the Fury of
the Sea is the least thing our Sailors fear:
Keep them but from <HI>a Lee Shore,</HI> or touching
upon a Sand, they'll venture all the rest: and
nothing is a greater satisfaction to them, if
they have a Storm in view, than a found Bot∣tom
and good <HI>Sea-room.</HI></P>
<P>From hence it comes to pass, that such
Winds as in those Days wou'd have pass'd for
Storms, are called only a <HI>Fresh-gale,</HI> or <HI>Blow∣ing
hard.</HI> If it blows enough to fright a
South Country Sailor, we laugh at it: and if
our Sailors bald Terms were set down in a
Table of Degrees, it will explain what we
mean.</P>

<P>Just half these Tarpawlin Articles, I pre∣sume,
would have pass'd in those Days for a
Storm; and that our Sailors call a Top-sail
Gale would have drove the Navigators of those
Ages into Harbours: when our Sailors reif a
Top-sail, they would have handed all their
Sails; and when we go under a main Course,
they would have run <HI>afore it</HI> for Life to the
next Port they could make: when our <HI>Hard
Gale</HI> blows, they would have cried a Tem∣pest;
and about the <HI>Fret of Wind</HI> they would
be all at their Prayers.</P>
<P>And if we should reckon by this Account
we are a stormy Country indeed, our Seas are
no more Navigable now for such Sailors than
they were then: If the <HI>Japaneses,</HI> the <HI>East
Indians,</HI> and such like Navigators, were to
come with their thin Cockle-shell Barks and
Calico Sails; if <HI>Cleopatra</HI>'s Fleet, or <HI>Caesar</HI>'s
great Ships with which he fought the Battle
of <HI>Acti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s,</HI> were to come upon our Seas, there
hardly comes a <HI>March</HI> or a <HI>September</HI> in twenty
Years but would blow them to Pieces, and
then the poor Remnant that got Home, would
<PB N="23" REF="37"/>
go and talk of a terrible Country where there's
nothing but Storms and Tempests; when all
the Matter is, the Weakness of their Shipping,
and the Ignorance of their Sea-men: and I
make no question but our Ships ride out many
a worse Storm than that terrible Tempest
which scatter'd <HI>Julius C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sar</HI>'s Fleet, or the
same that drove <HI>Aeneas</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Car∣thage.</HI></P>
<P>And in more modern times we have a fa∣mous
Instance in the <HI>Spanish Armada;</HI> which,
after it was rather frighted than damag'd by
Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s Machines, not then known
by the Name of Fireships, were scatter'd by a
terrible Storm, and lost upon every Shore.</P>
<P>The Case is plain, 'Twas all owing to the Ac∣cident
of Navigation: They had, no doubt, a
hard Gale of Wind, and perhaps a Storm; but
they were also on an Enemy's Coast, their Pilots
out of their Knowledge, no Harbour to run in∣to,
and an Enemy a-stern, that when once they
separated, Fear drove them from one Danger to
another, and away they went to the North∣ward,
where they had nothing but God's
Mercy, and the Winds and Seas to help them.
In all those Storms and Distresses which ruin'd
that Fleet, we do not find an Account of the
Loss of one Ship, either of the <HI>English</HI> or
<HI>Dutch;</HI> the Queen's Fleet rode it out in the
<HI>Downs,</HI> which all Men know is none of the
best Roads in the World; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> rode
among the Flats of the <HI>Flemish</HI> Coast, while
<PB N="24" REF="38"/>
the vast Galleons, not so well fitted for the
Weather, were forc'd to keep the Sea, and
were driven to and fro till they had got out
of their Knowledge; and like Men desperate,
embrac'd every Danger they came near.</P>
<P>This long Digression I could not but think
needful, in order to clear up the Case, having
never met with any thing on this Head be∣fore:
At the same time 'tis allow'd, and Hi∣stories
are full of the Particulars, that we have
often very high Winds, and sometimes vio∣lent
Tempests in these Northen Parts of the
World; but I am still of opinion, such a
Tempest never happen'd before as that which
is the Subject of these Sheets: and I refer the
Reader to the Particulars.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Storm in General.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore we come to examine the Damage
suffer'd by this terrible Night, and give
a particular Relation of its dismal Effects;
'tis necessary to give a summary Account of
the thing it self, with all its affrightning Cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>It
had blown exceeding hard, as I have al∣ready
observ'd, for about fourteen Days past;
and that so hard, that we thought it terrible
<PB N="25" REF="39"/>
Weather: Several Stacks of Chimnies were
blown down, and several Ships were lost,
and the Tiles in many Places were blown off
from the Houses; and the nearer it came to
the fatal <HI>26th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> the Tempestuous∣ness
of the Weather encreas'd.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Wednesday</HI> Morning before, being
the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> it was fair Weather,
and blew hard; but not so as to give any Ap∣prehensions,
till about 4 a Clock in the Af∣ternoon
the Wind encreased, and with Squauls
of Rain and terrible Gusts blew very fu∣riously.</P>
<P>The
Collector of these Sheets narrowly
escap'd the Mischief of a Part of a House,
which fell on the Evening of that Day by the
Violence of the Wind; and abundance of
Tiles were blown off the Houses that Night:
the Wind continued with unusual Violence
all the next Day and Night; and had not
the Great Storm follow'd so soon, this had
pass'd for a great Wind.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday</HI> Morning it continued to blow
exceeding hard, but not so as that it gave any
Apprehensions of Danger within Doors; to∣wards
Night it encreased: and about 10 a
Clock, our Barometers inform'd us that the
Night would be very tempestuous; the <HI>Mer∣cury</HI>
sunk lower than ever I had observ'd it on
any Occasion whatsoever, which made me
suppose the Tube had been handled and di∣sturb'd
by the Children.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="40"/>
But as my Observations of this Nature are
not regular enough to supply the Reader with
a full Information, the Disorders of that
dreadful Night having found me other Im∣ployment,
expecting every Moment when
the House I was in would bury us all in its
own Ruins; I have therefore subjoin'd a Let∣ter
from an Ingenious Gentleman on this very
Head, directed to the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and prin∣ted
in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions,</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 289.
P. 1530. as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Letter from the Reverend Mr. William
Derham, F.R.S. Containing his Obser∣vations
concerning the late Storm.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to my Promise at the general
Meeting of the <HI>R. S.</HI> on St. <HI>Andrews</HI>
Day, I here send you inclos'd the Account of
my Ingenious and Inquisitive Friend <HI>Richard
Townely,</HI> Es{que} concerning the State of the At∣mosphere
in that Part of <HI>Lancashire</HI> where
he liveth, in the late dismal Storm. And I
hope it will not be unaccepable, to accom∣pany
his with my own Observations at <HI>Ʋp∣minster;</HI>
especially since I shall not weary you
with a long History of the Devastations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
but rather some Particulars of a more Philo∣sophical
Consideration.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="41"/>
And first, I do not think it improper to
look back to the preceding Seasons of the
Year. I scarce believe I shall go out of the
way, to reflect as far back as <HI>April, May, June</HI>
and <HI>July;</HI> because all these were wet Months
in our Southern Parts. In <HI>April</HI> there fell
12, 49 <HI>l.</HI> of Rain through my Tunnel: And
about 6, 7, 8, or 9, <HI>l.</HI> I esteem a moderate quan∣tity
for <HI>Ʋpminster. In</HI> May <HI>there fell more
than in any Month of any Year since the Year</HI>
1696, viz. 20, 77 l. l. <HI>June</HI> likewise was a drip∣ping
Month, in which fell 14, 55 <HI>l.</HI> And
<HI>July,</HI> although it had considerable Intermissi∣ons,
yet had 14, 19 <HI>l.</HI> above 11 <HI>l.</HI> of which
fell on <HI>July 28th</HI> and <HI>29th</HI> in violent Showers.
And I remember the News Papers gave Ac∣counts
of great Rains that Month from divers
Places of <HI>Europe;</HI> but the <HI>North of England</HI>
(which also escaped the Violence of the late
Storm) was not so remarkably wet in any of
those Months; at least not in that great pro∣portion
more than we, as usually they are; as
I guess from the Tables of Rain, with which
Mr. <HI>Towneley</HI> hath favoured me. Particularly
<HI>July</HI> was a dry Month with them, there being
no more than 3, 65 <HI>l.</HI> of Rain fell through Mr.
<HI>Towneley</HI>'s Tunnel of the same Diameter with
mine.</P>
<P>From these Months let us pass to <HI>September,</HI>
and that we shall find to have been a wet
Month, especially the latter part of it;
there fell of Rain in that Month, 14, 86 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="42"/>
<HI>October</HI> and <HI>November</HI> last, although not re∣markably
wet, yet have been open warm
Months for the most part. My Thermometer
(whose freezing Point is about 84) hath been
very seldom below 100 all this Winter, and
especially in <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have laid before you as short Ac∣count
as I could of the preceding Disposition
of the Year, particularly as to wet and warmth,
because I am of opinion that these had a great
Influence in the late Storm; not only in cau∣sing
a Repletion of Vapours in the Atmo∣sphere,
but also in raising such Nitro-sulphu∣reous
or other heterogeneous matter, which
when mix'd together might make a sort of
Explosion (like fired Gun-powder) in the
Atmosphere. And from this Explosion I judge
those Corruscations or Flashes in the Storm to
have proceeded, which most People as well
as my self observed, and which some took for
Lightning. But these things I leave to better
Judgments, such as that very ingenious
Member of our Society, who hath undertaken
the Province of the late Tempest; to whom,
if you please, you may impart these Papers;
Mr. <HI>Hall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> you know I mean.</P>
<P>From Preliminaries it is time to proceed
nearer to the Tempest it self. And the fore∣going
Day, <HI>viz. Thursday, Nov.</HI> 25. I think de∣serveth
regard. In the Morning of that day
was a little Rain, the Winds high in the After∣noon▪
S.B.E. and S. In the Evening there was
<PB N="29" REF="43"/>
Lightning; and between 9 and 10 of the
Clock at Night, a violent, but short Storm of
Wind, and much Rain at <HI>Ʋpminster;</HI> and of Hail
in some other Places, which did some Damage:
There fell in that Storm 1, 65 <HI>l.</HI> of Rain. The
next Morning, which was <HI>Friday, Novem.</HI> 26.
the Wind was S.S.W. and high all Day, and
so continued till I was in Bed and asleep. A∣bout
12 that Night, the Storm awaken'd me,
which gradually encreas'd till near 3 that
Morning; and from thence till near 7 it con∣tinued
in the greatest excess: and then began
slowly to abate, and the <HI>Mercury</HI> to rise swift∣ly.
The Barometer I found at 12 h. 1/2 P. M.
at 28, 72, where it continued till about 6 the
next Morning, or 6 1/4, and then hastily rose;
so that it was gotten to 82 about 8 of the
Clock, as in the Table.</P>
<P>How the Wind sat during the late Storm I
cannot positively say, it being excessively dark
all the while, and my Vane blown down also,
when I could have seen: But by Information
from Millers, and others that were forc'd to
venture abroad; and by my own guess, I
imagin it to have blown about S. W. by S. or
nearer to the S. in the beginning, and to veer
about towards the West towards the End of
the Storm, as far as W. S. W.</P>
<P>The degrees of the Wind's Strength being
not measurable (that I know of, though talk'd
of) but by guess, I thus determine, with re∣spect
to other Storms. On <HI>Feb.</HI> 7. 169 8/9. was
<PB N="30" REF="44"/>
a terrible Storm that did much damage. This
I number 10 degrees; the Wind then W.N.W.
<HI>vid. Ph. Tr. No.</HI> 262. Another remarkable
Storm was <HI>Feb.</HI> 3. 170 ♀. at which time was
the greatest descent of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ever known:
This I number 9 degrees. But this last of
<HI>November,</HI> I number at least 15 degrees.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Stations</HI> of the <HI>Barometer,</HI> you
have Mr. <HI>Towneley</HI>'s and mine in the following
Table to be seen at one View.</P>
<P>As to <HI>November 17th</HI> (whereon Mr. <HI>Towne∣ley</HI>
mentions a violent Storm in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI>)
it was a Stormy Afternoon here at <HI>Upminster,</HI>
accompanied with Rain, but not violent, nor
♀ very low. <HI>November 11th</HI> and <HI>12th</HI> had
both higher Winds and more Rain; and the
♀ was those Days lower than even in the last
Storm of <HI>November 26th.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have given you the truest Ac∣count
I can, of what I thought most to deserve
Observation, both before, and in the late
Storm. I could have added some other par∣ticulars,
but that I fear I have already made
my Letter long, and am tedious. I shall there∣fore
only add, that I have Accounts of the
Violence of the Storm at <HI>Norwich, Beccles,
Sudbury, Colchester, Rochford,</HI> and several o∣ther
intermediate places; but I need not tell
Particulars, because I question not but you
have better Informations.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>Thus far Mr. Derham's Letter.</HEAD>
<P>It did not blow so hard till Twelve a Clock
at Night, but that most Families went to Bed;
though many of them not without some Con∣cern
at the terrible Wind, which then blew:
But about One, or at least by Two a Clock,
'tis suppos'd, few People, that were capable
of any Sense of Danger, were so hardy as to
lie in Bed. And the Fury of the Tempest en∣creased
to such a Degree, that as the Editor
of this Account being in <HI>London,</HI> and conver∣sing
<PB N="32" REF="46"/>
with the People the next Days, under∣stood,
most People expected the Fall of their
Houses.</P>
<P>And yet in this general Apprehension, no
body durst quit their tottering Habitations;
for whatever the Danger was within doors,
'twas worse without; the Bricks, Tiles, and
Stones, from the Tops of the Houses, flew
with such force, and so thick in the Streets,
that no one thought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to venture out, tho'
their Houses were near demolish'd within.</P>
<P>The Author of this Relation was in a well∣built
brick House in the skirts of the City;
and a Stack of Chimneys falling in upon the
next Houses, gave the House such a Shock,
that they thought it was just coming down
upon their Heads: but opening the Door to
attempt an Escape into a Garden, the Danger
was so apparent, that they all thought fit to
surrender to the Disposal of Almighty Provi∣dence,
and expect their Graves in the Ruins of
the House, rather than to meet most certain De∣struction
in the open Garden: for unless they
cou'd have gone above two hundred Yards
from any Building, there had been no Securi∣ty;
for the Force of the Wind blew the Tiles
point-blank, tho' their weight inclines them
downward: and in several very broad Streets,
we saw the Windows broken by the flying of
Tile-sherds from the other side: and where
there was room for them to fly, the Author
of this has seen Tiles blown from a House
<PB N="33" REF="47"/>
above thirty or forty Yards, and stuck from
five to eight Inches into the solid Earth. Pie∣ces
of Timber, Iron, and Sheets of Lead, have
from higher Buildings been blown much far∣ther;
as in the Particulars hereafter will ap∣pear.</P>
<P>It
is the receiv'd Opinion of abundance of
People, that they felt, during the impetuous
fury of the Wind, several Movements of the
Earth; and we have several Letters which af∣firm
it: But as an Earthquake must have been
so general, that every body must have dis∣cern'd
it; and as the People were in their
Houses when they imagin'd they felt it, the
Shaking and Terror of which might deceive
their Imagination, and impose upon their
Judgment; I shall not venture to affirm it was
so: And being resolv'd to use so much Cau∣tion
in this Relation as to transmit nothing
to Posterity without authentick Vouchers, and
such Testimony as no reasonable Man will dis∣pute;
so if any Relation come in ourway, which
may afford us a Probability, tho' it may be
related for the sake of its Strangeness or No∣velty,
it shall nevertheless come in the Com∣pany
of all its Uncertainties, and the Reader
left to judge of its Truth: for this Account
had not been undertaken, but with design to
undeceive the World in false Relations, and
to give an Account back'd with such Autho∣rities,
as that the Credit of it shou'd admit of
no Disputes.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="48"/>
For this reason I cannot venture to affirm
that there was any such thing as an Earth∣quake;
but the Concern and Consternation of
all People was so great, that I cannot wonder
at their imagining several things which were
not, any more than their enlarging on things
that were, since nothing is more frequent,
than for Fear to double every Object, and
impose upon the Understanding, strong Ap∣prehensions
being apt very often to perswade
us of the Reality of such things which we
have no other reasons to shew for the proba∣bility
of, than what are grounded in those
Fears which prevail at that juncture.</P>
<P>Others thought they heard it thunder. 'Tis
confess'd, the Wind by its unusual Violence
made such a noise in the Air as had a resem∣blance
to Thunder; and 'twas observ'd, the
roaring had a Voice as much louder than usu∣al,
as the Fury of the Wind was greater than
was ever known: the Noise had also some∣thing
in it more formidable; it sounded aloft,
and roar'd not very much unlike remote Thun∣der.</P>
<P>And
yet tho' I cannot remember to have
heard it thunder, or that I saw any Lightning,
or heard of any that did in or near <HI>London;</HI>
yet in the Countries the Air was seen full of
Meteors and vaporous Fires: and in some pla∣ces
both Thundrings and unusual Flashes of
Lightning, to the great terror of the Inhabi∣tants.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="49"/>
And yet I cannot but observe here, how
fearless such People as are addicted to Wicked∣ness,
are both of God's Judgments and uncom∣mon
Prodigies; which is visible in this Parti∣cular,
That a Gang of hardned Rogues assaulted
a Family at <HI>Poplar,</HI> in the very Height of the
Storm, broke into the House, and robb'd them:
it is observable, that the People cryed Thieves,
and after that cryed Fire, in hopes to raise the
Neighbourhood, and to get some Assistance;
but such is the Power of Self-Preservation, and
such was the Fear, the Minds of the People were
possess'd with, that no Body would venture
out to the Assistance of the distressed Family,
who were rifled and plundered in the middle
of all the Extremity of the Tempest.</P>
<P>It would admit of a large Comment here,
and perhaps not very unprofitable, to examine
from what sad Defect in Principle it must be that
Men can be so destitute of all manner of Re∣gard
to invisible and superiour Power, to be
acting one of the vil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Parts of a Villain,
while infinite Power was threatning the whole
World with Disolation, and Multitudes of Peo∣ple
expected the Last-Day was at Hand.</P>
<P>Several Women in the City of <HI>London</HI> who
were in Travail, or who fell into Travail by
the Fright of the Storm, were oblig'd to run
the risque of being delivered with such Help
as they had; and Midwives found their own
Lives in such Danger, that few of them
thought themselves oblig'd to shew any Con∣cern
for the Lives of others.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="50"/>
Fire was the only Mischief that did not
happen to make the Night compleatly dread∣ful;
and yet that was not so every where, for
in <HI>Norfolk</HI> the Town of—was almost ruin'd
by a furious Fire, which burnt with such Ve∣hemence,
and was so fann'd by the Tempest,
that the Inhabitants had no Power to concern
themselves in the extinguishing it; the Wind
blew the Flames, together with the Ruines,
so about, that there was no standing near it;
for if the People came to Windward they were
in Danger to be blown into the Flames; and
if to Leward the Flames were so blown up in
their Faces, they could not bear to come near it.</P>
<P>If this Distaster had happen'd in <HI>London,</HI>
it must have been very fatal; for as no regu∣lar
Application could have been made for the
extinguishing it, so the very People in Dan∣ger
would have had no Opportunity to have
sav'd their Goods, and hardly their Lives:
for though a Man will run any Risque to
avoid being burnt, yet it must have been next
to a Miracle, if any Person so oblig'd to es∣cape
from the Flames had escap'd being
knock'd on the Head in the Streets; for the
Bricks and Tiles flew about like small Shot;
and 'twas a miserable Sight, in the Morning
after the Storm, to see the Streets covered with
Tyle-sherds, and Heaps of Rubbish, from the
Tops of the Houses, lying almost at every Door.</P>
<P>From Two of the Clock the Storm conti∣nued,
and encreased till Five in the Morning;
<PB N="37" REF="51"/>
and from Five, to half an Hour after Six, it
blew with the greatest Violence: the Fury of
it was so exceeding great for that particular
Hour and half, that if it had not abated as it
did, nothing could have stood its Violence
much longer.</P>
<P>In this last Part of the Time the greatest
Part of the Damage was done: Several Ships
that rode it out till now, gave up all; for no
Anchor could hold. Even the Ships in the
River of <HI>Thames</HI> were all blown away from
their Moorings, and from <HI>Execution-Dock</HI> to
<HI>Lime-House Hole</HI> there was but four Ships that
rid it out, the rest were driven down into the
<HI>Bite,</HI> as the Sailors call it, from <HI>Bell-Wharf</HI> to
<HI>Lime-House;</HI> where they were huddeld toge∣ther
and drove on Shore, Heads and Sterns,
one upon another, in such a manner, as any
one would have thought it had been impossi∣ble:
and the Damage done on that Account
was incredible.</P>
<P>Together with the Violence of the Wind,
the Darkness of the Night added to the Ter∣ror
of it; and as it was just New Moon, the
Spring Tides being then up at about Four a
Clock, made the Vessels, which were a float
in the River, drive the farther up upon the
Shore: of all which, in the Process of this
Story, we shall find very strange Instances.</P>
<P>The Points from whence the Wind blew,
are variously reported from various Hands:
'Tis certain, it blew all the Day before at
<PB N="38" REF="52"/>
S.W. and I thought it continued so till about
Two a Clock; when, as near as I could judge
by the Impressions it made on the House, for
we durst not look out, it veer'd to the S.S.W.
then to the W. and about Six a Clock to
W. by N. and still the more Northward it
shifted, the harder it blew, till it shifted again
Southerly about Seven a Clock; and as it did
so, it gradually abated.</P>
<P>About Eight a Clock in the Morning it cea∣sed
so much, that our Fears were also abated,
and People began to peep out of Doors; but
'tis impossible to express the Concern that ap∣pear'd
in every Place: the Distraction and
Fury of the Night was visible in the Faces of
the People, and every Body's first Work was
to visit and enquire after Friends and Rela∣tions.
The next Day or Two was almost en∣tlrely
spent in the Curiosity of the People,
in viewing the Havock the Storm had made,
which was so universal in <HI>London,</HI> and espe∣cially
in the Out-Parts, that nothing can be
said sufficient to describe it.</P>
<P>Another unhappy Circumstance with which
this Disaster was join'd, was a prodigious
Tide, which happen'd the next Day but one,
and was occasion'd by the Fury of the Winds;
which is also a Demonstration, that the
Winds veer'd for Part of the Time to the
Northward: and as it is observable, and
known by all that understand our Sea Affairs,
that a North West Wind makes the Highest
<PB N="39" REF="53"/>
Tide, so this blowing to the Northward, and
that with such unusual Violence, brought up
the Sea raging in such a manner, that in
some Parts of <HI>England</HI> 'twas incredible,
the Water rising Six or Eight Foot higher
than it was ever known to do in the Me∣mory
of Man; by which Ships were fleeted
up upon the firm Land several Rods off from
the Banks, and an incredible Number of Cattle
and People drown'd; as in the Pursuit of this
Story will appear.</P>
<P>It was a special Providence that so directed
the Waters, that in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> the
Tide, thoug it rise higher than usual, yet it
did not so prodigiously exceed; but the
Height of them as it was, prov'd very pre∣judicial
to abundance of People whose Sellers
and Ware-houses were near the River; and
had the Water risen a Foot higher, all the
Marshes and Levels on both sides the River
had been over-flowed, and a great part of the
Cattle drowned.</P>
<P>Though the Storm abated with the rising
of the Sun, it still blew exceeding hard; so
hard, that no Boats durst stir out on the Ri∣ver,
but on extraordinary Occasions: and a∣bout
Three a Clock in the Afternoon, the next
Day being <HI>Saturday,</HI> it increas'd again, and
we were in a fresh Consternation, lest it should
return with the same Violence. At Four it
blew an extreme Storm, with sudden Gusts
as violent as any time of the Night; but as it
<PB N="40" REF="54"/>
came with a great black Cloud, and some
Thunder, it brought a hasty Shower of
Rain which allay'd the Storm: so that in a
quarter of an Hour it went off, and only
continued blowing as before.</P>
<P>This sort of Weather held all <HI>Sabbath-Day</HI>
and <HI>Monday,</HI> till on <HI>Tuesday</HI> Afternoon it en∣creased
again; and all <HI>Tuesday</HI> Night it blew
with such Fury, that many Families were a∣fraid
to go to Bed: And had not the former
terrible Night harden'd the People to all things
less than it self, this Night would have pass'd
for a Storm sit to have been noted in our Al∣manacks.
Several Stacks of Chimneys that stood
out the great Storm, were blown down in this;
several Ships which escap'd in the great
Storm, perish'd this Night; and several Peo∣ple
who had repair'd their Houses, had them
untiled again. Not but that I may allow
those Chimneys that fell now might have
been disabled before.</P>
<P>At this Rate it held blowing till <HI>Wednesday</HI>
about One a Clock in the Afternoon, which
was that Day Seven-night on which it began;
so that it might be called one continued
Storm from <HI>Wednesday</HI> Noon to <HI>Wednesday</HI>
Noon: in all which time, there was not one
Interval of Time in which a Sailor would not
have acknowledged it blew a Storm; and in
that time two such terrible Nights as I have
describ'd.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="55"/>
And this I particularly noted as to Time,
<HI>Wednesday, Nov.</HI> the <HI>24th</HI> was a calm fine Day
as at that time of Year shall be seen; 'till
above Four a Clock, when it began to
be Cloudy, and the Wind rose of a sudden,
and in half an Hours Time it blew a Storm.

<L>Those charming Willows which on <HI>Cherwel</HI>'s banks</L>

<L>The stately Oaks which reach'd the azure Sky,</L>

<L>Long a huge Pine did with the Winds contend;</L>
<L>This way, and that, his reeling Trunk they bend,</L>
<L>Till forc'd at last to yield, with hideous Sound</L>
<L>He falls, and all the Country feels the Wound.</L>
<L>Nor was the God of Winds content with these;</L>
<L>Such humble Victims can't his Wrath appease:</L>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Extent of this Storm, and from what
Parts it was suppos'd to come; with some
Circumstances as to the Time of it.</HEAD>
<P>AS all our Histories are full of the Relati∣ons
of Tempests and Storms which have
happened in various Parts of the World, I hope
it may not be improper that some of them
have been thus observ'd with their remark∣able
Effects.</P>
<P>But as I have all along insisted, that no
Storm since the Universal Deluge was like
this, either in its Violence or its Duration, so
I must also confirm it as to the particular of
its prodigious Extent.</P>
<P>All the Storms and Tempests we have heard
of in the World, have been Gusts or Squauls
of Wind that have been carried on in their
proper Channels, and have spent their Force
in a shorter space.</P>
<P>We feel nothing here of the Hurricanes of
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> the North- Wests of <HI>New-England</HI>
and <HI>Virginia,</HI> the terrible Gusts of the <HI>Levant,</HI>
or the frequent Tempests of the <HI>North Cape.</HI>
When Sir <HI>Francis Wheeler</HI>'s Squadron perish'd
at <HI>Gibralter,</HI> when the City of <HI>Straclsond</HI> was
almost ruin'd by a Storm, <HI>England</HI> felt it not,
nor was the Air here disturb'd with the Moti∣on.
<PB N="47" REF="61"/>
Even at home we have had Storms of
violent Wind in one part of <HI>England</HI> which
have not been felt in another. And if what
I have been told has any truth in it, in
St. <HI>George</HI>'s Channel there has frequently
blown a Storm at Sea right up and down the
Channel which has been felt on neither Coast,
tho it is not above 20 Leagues from the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
to the <HI>Irish</HI> Shore.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> gives us the Particulars
of two terrible Storms in <HI>Holland</HI> while he was
there; in one of which the great Cathedral
Church at <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> was utterly destroy'd: and
after that there was a Storm so violent in <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
that 46 Vessels were cast away at the
<HI>Texel,</HI> and almost all the Men drowned: and
yet we felt none of these Storms here.</P>
<P>And for this very reason I have reserv'd an
Abridgment of these former Cases to this
place; which as they are recited by Sir <HI>Wil∣liam
Temple,</HI> I shall put them down in his own
Words, being not capable to mend them, and
not vain enough to pretend to it.</P>
<P>“I stay'd only a Night at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> which
pass'd with so great Thunders and Light∣nings,
that I promis'd my self a very fair
Day after it, to go back to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> in the
<HI>States</HI> Yacht, that still attended me. The
Morning prov'd so; but towards Evening
the Sky grew foul, and the Sea men presag'd
ill Weather, and so resolved to lie at Anchor
<PB N="48" REF="62"/>
before <HI>Bergen ap Zoom,</HI> the Wind being cross
and little. When the Night was fallen as
black as ever I saw, it soon began to clear
up, with the most violent Flashes of Light∣ning
as well as Cracks of Thunder, that I be∣lieve
have ever been heard in our Age and
Climate. This continued all Night; and
we felt such a fierce Heat from every great
Flash of Lightning, that the Captain appre∣hended
it would fire his Ship. But about 8
the next Morning the Wind changed, and
came up with so strong a Gale, that we came
to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> in about 4 Hours, and there
found all Mouths full of the Mischiefs and
Accidents that the last Night's Tempest had
occasioned both among the Boats and the
Houses, by the Thunder, Lightning, Hail,
or Whirlwinds. But the Day after came
Stories to the <HI>Hague</HI> from all Parts, of such
violent Effects as were almost incredible: At
<HI>Amsterdam</HI> they were deplorable, many Trees
torn up by the Roots, Ships sunk in the
Harbour, and Boats in the Channels; Houses
beaten down, and several People were
snatch'd from the Ground as they walk'd the
Streets, and thrown into the Canals. But all
was silenc'd by the Relations from <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI>
where the Great and Ancient Cathedral was
torn in pieces by the Violences of this Storm;
and the vast Pillars of Stone that supported
it, were wreathed like a twisted Club, ha∣ving
been so strongly compos'd and ciment∣ed,
<PB N="49" REF="63"/>
as rather to suffer such a Change of Figure
than break in pieces, as other Parts of the Fa∣brick
did; hardly any Church in the Town es∣cap'd
the Violence of this Storm; and very
few Houses without the Marks of it; Nor
were the Effects of it less astonishing by the
Relations from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Brussels,</HI> where the
Damages were infinite, as well from Whirl∣winds,
Thunder, Lightning, as from Hail∣stones
of prodigious Bigness. This was in the
Year 1674.”</P>
<P>“In <HI>November,</HI> 1675. happen'd a Storm
at <HI>North-West,</HI> with a Spring-tide, so violent,
as gave apprehensions of some loss irrecovera∣ble
to the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI> and by several
breaches in the great Diques near <HI>Exchusen,</HI> and
others between <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and <HI>Harlem,</HI> made
way for such Inundations as had not been seen
before by any man then alive, and fill'd the
Country with many relations of most deplo∣rable
Events. But the incredible Diligence and
unanimous Endeavours of the People upon such
occasions, gave a stop to the Fury of that Ele∣ment,
and made way for recovering next Year
all the Lands, though not the People, Cattel,
and Houses that had been lost.”</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Thus far Sir William Temple.</HEAD>
<P>I am also credibly inform'd that the greatest
Storm that ever we had in <HI>England</HI> before, and
which was as universal here as this, did no Da∣mage
in <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> comparable to this
<PB N="50" REF="64"/>
Tempest: I mean the great Wind in 1661.
An Abstract of which, as it was printed in <HI>Mi∣rabilis
Anxis,</HI> an unknown, but unquestion'd
Author, take as follow, in his own Words.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>A dreadful Storm of Wind, accompanied
with Thunder, Lightning, Hail and
Rain; together with the sad Effects of it
in many Parts of the Nation.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> 1661. being
<HI>Tuesday,</HI> very early in the Morning, there
began a very great and dreadful Storm of Wind
(accompanied with Thunder, Lightning, Hail,
and Rain, which in may Places were as salt as
Brine) which continued with a strange and un∣usual
Violence till almost Night: the sad Effects
whereof throughout the Nation are so many,
that a very great Volume is not sufficient to
contain the Narrative of them. And indeed
some of them are so stupendious and amazing,
that the Report of them, though from never so
authentick Hands, will scarce gain Credit among
any but those that have an affectionate Sense of
the unlimited Power of the Almighty, knowing
and believing that there is nothing too hard for
Him to do.</P>
<P>Some few of which wonderful Effects we
shall give a brief Account of, as we have re∣ceived
them from Persons of most unquestiona∣ble
Credit in the several Parts of the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="65"/>
In the City of <HI>London,</HI> and in <HI>Covent Garden</HI>
and other Parts about <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI>
five or six Persons were killed outright by the
Fall of Houses and Chimneys; especially one
Mr. <HI>Luke Blith</HI> an Attorney, that lived at or near
<HI>Stamford</HI> in the County of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> was killed that
Day by the fall of a Riding-House not far from
<HI>Pickadilla:</HI> and there are some very remarka∣ble
Circumstances in this Man's Case, which do
make his Death to appear at least like a most e∣minent
Judgment and severe Stroak of the Lord's
Hand upon him.</P>
<P>From other Parts likewise we have received
certain Information, that divers Persons were
killed by the Effects of this great Wind.</P>
<P>At <HI>Chiltenham</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> a Maid was
killed by the Fall of a Tree, in or near the
Church-Yard.</P>
<P>An honest Yeoman likewise of <HI>Scaldwel</HI> in
<HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> being upon a Ladder to save
his Hovel, was blown off, and fell upon a Plough,
died outright, and never spoke Word more.</P>
<P>Also at <HI>Tewksbury</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> a Man was
blown from an House, and broken to Pieces.</P>
<P>At <HI>Elsbury</HI> likewise in the same County, a
Woman was killed by the Fall of Tiles or Bricks
from an House.</P>
<P>And not far from the same Place, a Girl was
killed by the Fall of a Tree.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Northampton,</HI> a Man was killed by the
Fall of a great Barn.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Colchester,</HI> a Young-man was killed by
the Fall of a Wind-mill.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="66"/>
Not far from <HI>Ipsvich</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> a Man was
killed by the Fall of a Barn.</P>
<P>And about two Miles from the said Town
of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> a Man was killed by the Fall of a
Tree.</P>
<P>At <HI>Langton,</HI> or near to it, in the County of
<HI>Leicester,</HI> one Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> had a Wind-mill
blown down, in which were three Men; and
by the Fall of it, one of them was killed outright,
a second had his Back broken, and the other had
his Arm or Leg struck off; and both of them
(according to our best Information) are since
dead.</P>
<P>Several other Instances there are of the like
Nature; but it would be too tedious to mention
them: Let these therefore suffice to stir us up
to Repentance, <HI>lest we likewise perish.</HI></P>
<P>There are also many Effects of this Storm
which are of another Nature, whereof we
shall give this following brief Account.</P>
<P>The Wind hath very much prejudiced many
Churches in several Parts of the Nation.</P>
<P><HI>At Temksbury</HI> in <HI>Gloncestershire,</HI> it blew down
a very fair Window belonging to the Church
there, both the Glass, and the Stone-work also;
the Doors likewise of that Church were blown
open, much of the Lead torn up, and some
Part of a fair Pinnacle thrown down.</P>
<P>Also at <HI>Red-Marly</HI> and <HI>Newin,</HI> not far from
<HI>Tewksbury,</HI> their Churches are extreamly broken
and shatterd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>T not a considerable part of them
blown down. The like was done to most, if
not all the Publick Meeting-places at <HI>Gloucester</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="67"/>
City. And it is reported, that some Hundreds
of Pounds will not suffice to repair the Damage
done to the Cathedral at <HI>Worcester,</HI> especially
in that Part that is over the Quire.</P>
<P>The like Fate happen'd to many more of
them, as <HI>Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Leighton Beau-desart</HI> in
<HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> and <HI>Eaton-Soken</HI> in the same Coun∣ty;
where they had newly erected a very fair
Cross of Stone, which the Wind blew down:
and, as some of the Inhabitants did observe,
that was the first Damage which that Town
sustained by the Storm, though afterwards in o∣ther
respects also they were in the same Condi∣tion
with their Neighbours. The Stesples also,
and other Parts of the Churches of <HI>Shenley,
Waddon,</HI> and <HI>Woolston</HI> in the County of <HI>Bucks,</HI>
have been very much rent and torn by the Wind.
The Spire of <HI>Finchinfield</HI> Steeple in the County
of <HI>Essex,</HI> was blown down, and it brake through
the Body of the Church, and spoild many of
the Pews; some Hundreds of Pounds will not
repair that Loss. But that which is most re∣markable
of this kind, is, the Fall of that most
famous Spire, or Pinnacle of the Tower-Church
in <HI>Ipswich:</HI> it was blown down upon the Body
of the Church, and fell reversed, the sharp End
of the Shaft striking through the Leads on the
South-side of the Church, carried much of the
Timber-work down before it into the Alley
just behind the Pulpit, and took off one Side of
the Sounding board over the Pulpit: it shatter∣ed
many Pews: The Weather-Cock, and the
Iron upon which it stood, broke off as it fell;
<PB N="54" REF="68"/>
but the narrowest Part of the Wood-work,
upon which the Fane stood, fell into the Alley,
broke quite through a Grave-stone, and ran
shoring under two Coffins that had been placed
there one on another; that Part of the Spire
which was pluck'd up was about three Yards
deep in the Earth, and it is believed some Part
of it is yet behind in the Ground: some Hun∣dreds
of Pounds will not make good the Detri∣ment
done to the Church by the Fall of this Pin∣nacle.</P>
<P>Very
great Prejudice has been done to pri∣vate
Houses; many of them blown down, and
others extreamly shattered and torn. It is
thought that five thousand Pounds will not
make good the Repairs at <HI>Audley-End House,</HI>
which belongs to the Earl of <HI>Suffolk.</HI> A good
Part also of the Crown-Office in the <HI>Temple</HI> is
blown down. The Instances of this kind are
so many and so obvious, that it would needlesly
take up too much time to give the Reader an
Account of the Collection of them; only there
has been such a wonderful Destruction of Barns,
that (looking so much like a Judgment from
the Lord, who the last Year took away our Corn,
and this our Barns) we cannot but give a
short Account of some Part of that Intelli∣gence
which hath come to our Hands of that
Nature.</P>
<P>A Gentleman, of good Account, in <HI>Ipswich,</HI>
affirms, that in a few Miles riding that Day,
there was eleven Barns and Out-houses blown
down in the Road within his View; and with∣in
<PB N="55" REF="69"/>
a very few Miles of <HI>Ipswich</HI> round about, a∣bove
thirty Barns and many of them with Corn
in them, were blown down. At <HI>Southold</HI> not
far from the Place before mentioned, many new
Houses and Barns (built since a late Fire that
happened there) are blown down; as also a Salt∣house
is destroyed there: and a thousand Pounds,
as it is believed, will not make up that particular
Loss.</P>
<P>From <HI>Tewksbury</HI> it is certified, that an incredi∣ble
Number of Barns have been blown down
in the small Towns and Villages thereabouts.
At <HI>Twyning,</HI> at least eleven Barns are blown
down. In <HI>Ashchurch</HI> Parish seven or eight. At
<HI>Lee,</HI> five. At <HI>Norton,</HI> a very great Number,
three whereof belonging to one Man. The great
Abby-Barn also at <HI>Tewksbury</HI> is blown down.</P>
<P>It is credibly reported, that within a very few
Miles Circumference in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> about an
hundred and forty Barns are blown down. At
<HI>Finchinfield</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> which is but an ordinary
Village, about sixteen Barns were blown down.
Also at a Town called <HI>Wilchamsted</HI> in the Coun∣ty
of <HI>Bedford</HI> (a very small Village) fifteen Barns
at least are blown down. But especially the
Parsonage Barns went to wrack in many Places
throughout the Land: In a few Miles Compass
in <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> and so in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> and
other Places, eight, ten, and twelve are blown
down; and at <HI>Yielding Parsonage</HI> in the County
of <HI>Bedford</HI> (out of which was thrust by Op∣pression
and Violence the late Incumbent) all
the Barns belonging to it are down. The In∣stances
<PB N="56" REF="70"/>
also of this kind are innumerable, which
we shall therefore forbear to make further men∣tion
of.</P>
<P>We have also a large Account of the blowing
down of a very great and considerable Number
of Fruit-Trees, and other Trees in several
Parts; we shall only pick out two or three Passa∣ges
which are the most remarkable. In the
<HI>Countries of Gloucester, Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI>
several Persons have lost whole Orchards of
Fruit-trees; and many particular Mens Loss
hath amounted to the Value of forty or fifty
Pounds at the least, meerly by Destruction of
their Fruit-Trees: and so in other Parts of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
proportionably the like Damage hath been
sustained in this Respect. And as for other
Trees, there has been a great Destruction made
of them in many Places by this Storm. Several
were blown down at <HI>Hampton-Court.</HI> And three
thousand brave Oaks at least, but in one principal
Part of the Forest of <HI>Dean,</HI> belonging to his
Majesty. In a little Grove at <HI>Ipswich,</HI> belonging
to the Lord of <HI>Her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sord</HI> (which together with
the Spice of the Steeple before-mentioned, were
the most considerable Ornaments of that Town)
are blown down at least two hundred goodly
Trees, one of which was an Ash, which had
ten Load of Wood upon it: there are now few
Trees left there.</P>
<P>In <HI>Bramion Bryan Park</HI> in the County of <HI>He∣rescrd,</HI>
belonging to Sir <HI>Edward Harly,</HI> one of the
late Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> above thirteen hundred
Trees are blown down; and above six hundred
<PB N="57" REF="71"/>
in <HI>Hopton Park</HI> not far from it: and thus it is pro∣portionably
in most Places where this Storm was
felt. And the Truth is, the Damage which
the People of this Nation have sustained upon all
Accounts by this Storm, is not easily to be va∣lued:
some sober and discreet People, who have
endeavoured to compute the Loss of the several
Countries on with another, by the Destruction of
Houses and Barns, the blowing away of Hovels
and Ricks of Corn, the falling of Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do be∣lieve
it can come to little less than two Millions
of Money.</P>
<P>There are yet behind many Particulars of a
distinct Nature from those that have been spo∣ken
of; some whereof are very wonderful, and
call for a very serious Observation of them.</P>
<P>In the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> espe∣cially
on the Bridge and near <HI>Wallingford-house,</HI>
several Persons were blown down one on the
Top of another.</P>
<P>In <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> a Man was taken up, carried
a Pole in Length, and blown over a very high
Hedge; and the like in other Places.</P>
<P>The Water in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and o∣ther
Places, was in a very strange manner
blown up into the Air: Yea, in the new Pond
in <HI>James's Park,</HI> the Fish, to the Number of at
least two Hundred, where blown out and lay
by the Bank-side, whereof many were Eye∣witnesses.</P>
<P>At
<HI>Moreclack</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> the <HI>Birds,</HI> as they at∣tempted
to fly, were beaten down to the Ground
by the Violence of the Wind.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="72"/>
At <HI>Epping</HI> in the County of <HI>Essex,</HI> a very
great Oak was blown down, which of it self
was raised again, and doth grow firmly at this
Day.</P>
<P>At <HI>Taunton,</HI> a great Tree was blown down,
the upper Part whereof rested upon a Brick or
Stone-wall, and after a little time, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of the Wind, the lower part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was
blown quite over the Wall.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Hereford,</HI> several <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> were,
by the Violence of the Wind <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the
Ground; one Man (as it is credibly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ported)
at least six Yards.</P>
<P>The great Fane at <HI>Whitehall</HI> was blown down;
and one of the four which were upon the <HI>white
Tower,</HI> and two more of them strangely bent;
which are to be seen at this Day, to the Admi∣ration
of all that behold them.</P>
<P>The several <HI>Triumphant Arches</HI> in the City of
<HI>London</HI> were much shattered and torn; That in
<HI>Leaden-hall-street</HI> lost the King's Arms, and ma∣ny
other rare Pieces that were affixed to it; That
in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> which represented the Church, suf∣fered
very much by the Fury of the Storm;
and a great Part of that in <HI>Fleetstreet</HI> (which re∣presented
Plenty) was blown down: but, blessed
be God, none as we hear of were either killed
or hurt by the Fall of it.</P>
<P>The Wind was so strong, that it blew down
several Carts loaded with Hay in the Road be∣tween
<HI>Barnet</HI> and <HI>London;</HI> and in other Roads
leading to the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="73"/>
<HI>Norwich</HI> Coach, with four or six Horses, was
not able to come towards <HI>London,</HI> but stayed
by the way till the Storm was somewhat aba∣ted.</P>
<P>It
is also credibly reported, That all, or some
of the Heads which were set up upon <HI>Westmin∣ster-Hall,</HI>
were that Day blown down.</P>
<P>There was a very dreadful Lightning which
did at first accompany the Storm, and by it some
of his Majesty's Houshold conceive that the Fire
which happened at <HI>Whitehall</HI> that Morning, was
kindled; as also that at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> by which
(as we are informed) seven or eight Houses
were burnt down.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Thus far the Author of Mirabilis Annis.</HEAD>
<P>'Tis very observable, that this Storm blew
from the same Quarter as the last, and that they
had less of it Northward than here; in which
they were much alike.</P>
<P>Now as these Storms were perhaps very furi∣ous
in some Places, yet they neither came up
to the Violence of this, nor any way to be com∣par'd
for the Extent, and when ruinous in one
Country, were hardly heard of in the next.</P>
<P>But this terrible Night shook all <HI>Europe;</HI> and
how much farther it extended, he only knows
who <HI>has his way in the Whirlwind, and in the
Storm, and the Clouds are the Dust of his
Feet.</HI></P>
<P>As this Storm was first felt from the West,
some have conjectur'd that the first Generation
or rather Collection of Materials, was from the
<PB N="60" REF="74"/>
Continent of <HI>America,</HI> possibly from that part
of <HI>Florida</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> where, if we respect na∣tural
Causes, the Confluence of Vapours rais'd
by the Sun from the vast and unknown Lakes
and Inland Seas of Water, which as some relate
are incredibly large as well as numerous, might
afford sufficient Matter for the Exhalation; and
where time adding to the Preparation, God,
who has generally confin'd his Providence to
the Chain of natural Causes, might muster to∣gether
those Troops of Combustion till they
made a sufficient Army duly proportion'd to the
Expedition design'd.</P>
<P>I am the rather inclin'd to this Opinion, be∣cause
we are told, they felt upon that Coast an
unusual Tempest a few Days before the fatal
27th of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>I confess, I have never studied the Motion
of the Clouds so nicely, as to calculate how
long time this Army of Terror might take up
in its furious March; possibly the velocity of
its Motion might not be so great at its first set∣ting
out as it was afterward, as a Horse that is
to run a Race does not immediately put himself
into the height of his Speed: and tho' it may be
true, that by the length of the way the force of
the Wind spends it self, and so by degrees cea∣ses
as the Vapour finds more room for Dilation;
besides, yet we may suppose a Conjunction of
some confederate Matter which might fall in with
it by the way, or which meeting it at its Arri∣val
here, might join Forces in executing the
Commission receiv'd from above, all natural
<PB N="61" REF="75"/>
Causes being allow'd a Subserviency to the
Direction of the great supream Cause; yet
where the vast Collection of Matter had its
first Motion, as it did not all take Motion in one
and the same moment, so when all the Parts had
felt the Influence, as they advanc'd and press'd
those before them, the Violence must increase in
proportion: and thus we may conceive that the
Motion might not have arriv'd at its Meridian
Violence till it reach'd our Island; and even
then it blew some Days with more than com∣mon
fury, yet much less than that last Night of
its force; and even that Night the Violence was
not at its extremity till about an hour before
Sun rise, and then it continued declining, tho' it
blew a full Storm for four Days after it.</P>
<P>Thus Providence, by whose special Direction
the Quantity and Conduct of this Judgment
was manag'd, seem'd to proportion things so,
as that by the course of things the proportion of
Matter being suited to Distance of Place, the
Motion shou'd arrive at its full Force just at the
Place where its Execution was to begin.</P>
<P>As then our Island was the first, this way, to
receive the Impressions of the violent Motion,
it had the terriblest Effects here; and continu∣ing
its steady Course, we find it carried a true
Line clear over the Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> tra∣vers'd
<HI>England, France, Germany,</HI> the <HI>Baltick</HI>
Sea, and passing the Northern Continent of
<HI>Sweedland, Finland, Musccvy,</HI> and part of <HI>Tarta∣ry,</HI>
must at last lose it self in the vast Northern
Ocean, where Man never came, and Ship never
<PB N="62" REF="76"/>
fail'd; and its Violence cou'd have no effect, but
upon the vast Mountains of Ice and the huge
Drifts of Snow, in which Abyss of Moisture and
Cold it is very probable the Force of it was
check'd, and the World restor'd to Calmness
and Quiet: and in this Circle of Fury it might
find its End not far off from where it had its
Beginning, the Fierceness of the Motion perhaps
not arriving to a Period, till having pass'd the
Pole, it reached again the Northern Parts of
<HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>The Effects of this impetuous Course, are the
proper Subjects of this Book; and what they
might be before our Island felt its Fury, who
can tell? Those unhappy Wretches who had
the misfortune to meet it in its first Approach,
can tell us little, having been hurried by its ir∣resistible
Force directly into Eternity: how ma∣ny
they are, we cannot pretend to give an Ac∣count;
we are told of about seventeen Ships,
which having been out at Sea are never heard
of: which is the common way of Discourse of
Ships founder'd in the Ocean: and indeed all we
can say of them is, the fearful <HI>Exit</HI> they have
made among the Mountains of Waters, can on∣ly
be duly reflected on by those who have seen
those Wonders of God in the Deep.</P>
<P>Yet I cannot omit here to observe, That this
Loss was in all probability much less than it
would otherwise have been; because the Winds
having blown with very great Fury, at the
same Point, for near fourteen Days before the
Violence grew to its more uncommon height,
<PB N="63" REF="77"/>
all those Ships which were newly gone to Sea
were forc'd back, of which some were driven
into <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Falmouth</HI> who had been above
a hundred and fifty Leagues at Sea; others,
which had been farther, took Sanctuary in <HI>Ire∣land.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, All those Ships which
were homeward bound, and were within 500
Leagues of the <HI>English</HI> Shore, had been hurried
so furiously on <HI>afore it (as the Seamen say)</HI> that
they had reach'd their Port before the Extre∣mity
of the Storm came on; so that the Sea was
as it were swept clean of all Shipping, those
which were coming home were blown home
before their time; those that had attempted to
put to Sea, were driven back again inspight of
all their Skill and Courage: for the Wind had
blown so very hard, directly into the Channel,
that there was no possibility of their keeping the
Sea whose Course was not right afore the Wind.</P>
<P>On the other hand, these two Circumstances
had fill'd all our Ports with unusual Fleets of
Ships, either just come home or outward-bound,
and consequently the Loss among them was ve∣ry
terrible; and the Havock it made among
them, tho' it was not so much as every body
expected, was such as no Age or Circumstance
can ever parallel, and we hope will never feel
again.</P>
<P>Nay, so high the Winds blew even before
<HI>that we call the Storm,</HI> that had not that intole∣rable
Tempest follow'd so soon after, we should
have counted those Winds extraordinary high:
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
and any one may judge of the Truth of this
from these few Particulars; That the <HI>Russia</HI>
Fleet, compos'd of near a hundred Sail, which
happen'd to be then upon the Coast, was abso∣lutely
dispers'd and scatter'd, some got into
<HI>Newcastle,</HI> some into <HI>Hall,</HI> and some into <HI>Yar∣mouth</HI>
Roads; two sounder'd in the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; one or
two more run a-shore, and were lost; and the
<HI>Reserve</HI> Frigat, their Convoy, founder'd in <HI>Yar∣mouth</HI>
Roads, all her Men being lost, and no
Boat from the Shore durst go off to relieve her,
tho' it was in the Day-time, but all her Men
perished.</P>
<P>In the same previous Storms the
Man of War was lost off of <HI>Harwich;</HI> but by
the help of smaller Vessels most of her Men
were sav'd.</P>
<P>And so high the Winds blew for neat a Fort∣night,
that no Ship stirr'd out of Harbour; and
all the Vessels, great or small, that were out at
Sea, made for some Port or other for shelter.</P>
<P>In this juncture of time it happen'd, that to∣gether
with the <HI>Russia</HI> Fleet, a great Fleet of
Laden Colliers, near 400 Sail, were just put
out of the River <HI>Tine:</HI> and these being generally
deep and unweildy Ships, met with hard mea∣sure,
tho' not so fatal to them as was expected:
such of them as could run in for <HI>Humber,</HI> where
a great many were lost afterwards, as I shall
relate in its course; some got shelter under the
high Lands of <HI>Cromer</HI> and the Northern Shores
of the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and the greater num∣ber
reach'd into <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roads.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="79"/>
So that when the Great Storm came, our
Ports round the Sea-Coast of <HI>England</HI> were ex∣ceeding
full of Ships of all sorts: a brief account
where of take as follows.</P>
<P>At <HI>Grinsby, Hall,</HI> and the other Roads of the
<HI>Humber,</HI> lay about 80 Sail, great and small, of
which about 50 were Colliers, and part of the
<HI>Russia</HI> Fleet as aforesaid.</P>
<P>In <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roads there rode at least 400
Sail, being most of them Laden Colliers, <HI>Russia</HI>
Men, and Coasters from <HI>Lynn</HI> and <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll.</HI></P>
<P>In the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> at the <HI>Nore,</HI> lay a∣bout
12 Sail of the Queen's hir'd Ships and
Store-ships, and only two Men of War.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Cloudsly Shovel</HI> was just arriv'd from the
<HI>Mediterranean</HI> with the Royal Navy: Part of
them lay at <HI>St. Heliens,</HI> part in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and
with 12 of the biggest Ships he was coming
round the <HI>Foreland</HI> to bring them into <HI>Chatham;</HI>
and when the Great Storm began was at an
Anchor at the <HI>Gunfleet,</HI> from whence the <HI>Associ∣ation</HI>
was driven off from Sea as far as the Coast
of <HI>Norway:</HI> What became of the rest, I refer to
a Chapter by it self.</P>
<P>At <HI>Gravesend</HI> there rode five <HI>East India</HI> Men,
and about 30 Sail of other Merchant-men, all
outward bound.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Downs</HI> 160 Sail of Merchant Ships out∣ward
bound, besides that part of the Fleet which
came in with Sir <HI>Cloudsly Shovel,</HI> which consist∣ed
of about 18 Men of War, with Tenders and
Victuallers.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="80"/>
At <HI>Portsmouth</HI> and <HI>Cowes</HI> there lay three
Fleets; first, a Fleet of Transports and Tenders,
who with Admiral <HI>Dilks</HI> brought the Forces
from <HI>Ireland</HI> that were to accompany the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>Lisbon;</HI> secondly, a great Fleet of
Victuallers, Tenders, Store-ships, and Trans∣ports,
which lay ready for the same Voyage,
together with about 40 Merchant-ships, who
lay for the benefit of their Convoy; and the
third Article was, the Remainder of the Grand
Fleet which came in with Sir <HI>Cloudsly Shovel;</HI>
in all almost 300 Sail, great and small.</P>
<P>In <HI>Plymouth</HI> Sound, <HI>Falmouth</HI> and <HI>Milford</HI>
Havens, were particularly several small Fleets
of Merchant-ships, driven in for Shelter and
Harbour from the Storm, most homeward
bound from the Islands and Colonies of <HI>Ame∣rica.</HI></P>
<P>The
<HI>Virginia</HI> Fleet, <HI>Barbadces</HI> Fleet, and some
<HI>East India</HI> Men, lay scatter'd in all our Ports,
and in <HI>Kinsale</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> there lay near 80 Sail,
homeward bound and richly laden.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bristol</HI> about 20 Sail of home-bound <HI>West
India</HI> Men, not yet unladen.</P>
<P>In <HI>Holland,</HI> the Fleet of Transports for <HI>Lisbon</HI>
waited for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and several <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Men of War lay at <HI>Helvoet Sluice;</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Fleet from the <HI>Texel</HI> lay off of <HI>Cadsandt,</HI> with
their Forces on Board, under the Admiral <HI>Cal∣lenberge.</HI>
Both these Fleets made 180 Sail.</P>
<P>I think I may very safely affirm, That hard∣ly
in the Memory of the oldest Man living, was
a juncture of Time when an Accident of this
<PB N="67" REF="81"/>
nature could have happen'd, that so much Ship∣ping,
laden out and home, ever was in Port at
one time.</P>
<P>No Man will wonder that the Damages to
this Nation were so great, if they consider these
unhappy Circumstances: it shou'd rather be
wonder'd at, that we have no more Disasters
to account to Posterity, but that the Navigation
of this Country came off so well.</P>
<P>And therefore some People have excus'd the
Extravagancies of the <HI>Paris Gazetteer,</HI> who af∣firm'd
in Print, that there was 30000 Sea-men
lost in the several Ports of <HI>England,</HI> and 300
Sail of Ships; which they say was a probable
Conjecture; and that considering the multitude
of Shipping, the Openness of the Roads in the
<HI>Downs, Yarmouth,</HI> and the <HI>Nore,</HI> and the prodi∣gious
Fury of the Wind, any Man would have
guess'd the same as he.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, It is a thing wonderful to consi∣der,
that especially in the <HI>Downs</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth</HI>
Roads any thing shou'd be safe: all Men that
know how wild a Road the first is, and what
Crowds of Ships there lay in the last; how al∣most
every thing quitted the Road, and neither
Anchor nor Cable would hold must wonder
what Shift or what Course the Mariners could
direct themselves to for Safety.</P>
<P>Some which had not a Mast standing, nor an
Anchor or Cable left them, went out to Sea
wherever the Winds drove them; and lying
like a Trough in the Water, wallow'd about
till the Winds aba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed; and after were driven,
<PB N="68" REF="82"/>
some into one Port, some into another, as Pro∣vidence
guided them.</P>
<P>In short, Horror and Confusion seiz'd upon
all, whether on Shore or at Sea: No Pen can de∣scribe
it, no Tongue can express it, no Thought
conceive it, unless some of those who were in
the Extremity of it; and who, being touch'd
with a due sense of the sparing Mercy of their
Maker, retain the deep Impressions of his Good∣ness
upon their Minds, tho' the Danger be past:
and of those I doubt the Number is but few.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE
EFFECTS
OF THE
STORM.</HEAD>
<P>THE particular dreadful Effects of this
Tempest, are the Subject of the ensuing
Part of this History: And tho' the Rea∣der
is not to expect that all the Particulars can
be put into this Account, and perhaps many ve∣ry
remarkable Passages may never come to our
Knowledge; yet as we have endeavour'd to
furnish our selves with the most authentick Ac∣counts
we could from all Parts of the Nation,
and a great many worthy Gentlemen have con∣tributed
their Assistance in various, and some
very exact Relations and curious Remarks; so
we pretend, not to be meanly furnish'd for this
Work.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen, whose Accounts are but of
common and trivial Damages, we hope will
not take it ill from the Author, if they are not
inserted at large; for that we are willing to put
<PB N="70" REF="84"/>
in nothing here common with other Accidents of
like nature; or which may not be Worthy of a
History and a Historian to record them; nothing
but what may serve to assist in convincing Po∣sterity
that this was the most violent Tempest
the World ever saw.</P>
<P>From hence 'twill follow, that those Towns
who only had their Houses until'd, their Barns
and Hovels levell'd with the Ground, and the
like, will find very little notice taken of them
in this Account; because if these were to be
the Subject of a History, I presume it must be
equally voluminous with <HI>Fox, Grimston, Holin∣shead</HI>
or <HI>Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P>Nor shall I often trouble the Reader with the
Multitude or Magnitude of Trees blown down,
whole Parks ruin'd, fine Walks defac'd, and
Orchards laid flat, and the like: and tho' I had,
my self, the Curiosity to count the Number of
Trees, in a Circuit I rode, over most part of
<HI>Kent,</HI> in which being tired with the Number,
I left off reckoning after I had gone on to 17000;
and tho' I have great reason to believe I did not
observe one half of the Quantity; yet in some Parts
of <HI>England,</HI> as in <HI>Devonshire</HI> especially, and the
Counties of <HI>Worcester, Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>Hereford,</HI>
which are full of very large Orchards of Fruit-Trees,
they had much more mischief:</P>
<P>In the Pursuit of this Work, I shall divide it
into the following Chapters or Sections, that I
may put it into as good Order as possible.</P>

</LIST>
<P>We had design'd a Chapter for the Damages
abroad, and have been at no small Charge to
procure the Particulars from foreign Parts;
which are now doing in a very authentick man∣ner:
but as the World has been long expecting
this Work, and several Gentlemen who were
not a little contributing to the Information of
the Author, being unwilling to stay any longer
for the Account, it was resolved to put it into
the Press without any farther Delay: and if the
foreign Accounts can be obtain'd in time, they
shall be a Supplement to the Work; if not,
some other Method shall be found out to make
them publick.</P>
<DIV2>
<PB N="72" REF="86"/>
<HEAD>I. Of the Damages in the City of London,
and Parts adjacent.</HEAD>
<P>Indeed the City was a strange Spectacle, the
Morning after the Storm, as soon as the People
could put their Heads out of Doors: though I
believe, every Body expected the Destruction
was bad enough; yet I question very much, if
any Body believed the Hundredth Part of what
they saw.</P>
<P>The Streets lay so covered with Tiles and
Slates, from the Tops of the Houses, especially
in the Out-parts, that the Quantity is incredible:
and the Houses were so universally stript, that
all the Tiles in Fifty Miles round would be able
to repair but a small Part of it.</P>
<P>Something may be guest at on this Head,
from the sudden Rise of the Price of Tiles;
which rise from 21 <HI>s. per</HI> Thousand to 6 <HI>l.</HI> for
plain Tiles; and from 50 <HI>s. per</HI> Thousand for
Pantiles, to 10 <HI>l.</HI> and Bricklayers Labour
to 5 <HI>s. per</HI> Day: And tho' after the first Hurry
the Prices fell again, it was not that the Quan∣tity
was supply'd; but because,
<HI>1st,</HI> The Charge was so extravagant, that
an universal Neglect of themselves, appear'd
both in Landlord and Tenant; an incredible
Number of Houses remain'd all the Winter un∣covered,
and expos'd to all the Inconveniences
of Wet and Cold; and are so even at the Wri∣ting
of this Chapter.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="87"/>
2. Those People who found it absolutely ne∣cessary
to cover their Houses, but were unwil∣lling
to go to the extravagant Price of Tiles;
chang'd their Covering to that of Wood, as a
present Expedient, till the Season for making
of Tiles should come on; and the first Hurry
being over, the Prices abate: and 'tis on this
Score, that we see, to this Day, whole Ranks of
Buildings, as in <HI>Christ Church Hospital,</HI> the <HI>Tem∣ple,
Asks-Hospital, Old-street, Hogsden-Squares,</HI>
and infinite other Places, covered entirely with
Deal Boards; and are like to continue so, per∣haps
a Year or two longer, for Want of Tiles.</P>
<P>These two Reasons reduc'd the Tile-Mer∣chants
to sell at a more moderate Price: But 'tis
not an irrational Suggestion, that all the Tiles
which shall be made this whole Summer, will
not repair the Damage in the covering of Houses
within the Circumference of the City, and Ten
Miles round.</P>
<P>The next Article in our Street Damage was,
the Fall of Chimneys; and as Chimneys in
the City Buildings are built in large Stacks, the
Houses being so high, the Fall of them had the
more Power, by their own Weight, to de∣molish
the Houses they fell upon.</P>
<P>'Tis not possible to give a distinct Account of
the Number, or particular Stacks of Chimneys,
which fell in this fatal Night; but the Reader
may guess by this Particular, that in <HI>Cambray-House,</HI>
commonly so called, a great House near
<HI>Islington,</HI> belonging to the Family of the <HI>Comp∣tons,</HI>
Earls of <HI>Northampton,</HI> but now let out in∣to
<PB N="74" REF="88"/>
Tenements; the Collector of these Remarks
counted Eleven or Thirteen Stacks of Chimneys,
either wholly thrown in, or the greatest Parts
of them at least, what was expos'd to the Wind,
blown off. I have heard Persons, who pre∣tended
to observe the Desolation of that terrible
Night very nicely; and who, by what they had
seen and enquired into, thought themselves ca∣pable
of making some Calculations, affirm, They
could give an Account of above Two Thousand
Stacks of Chimneys blown down in and about
<HI>London;</HI> besides Gable Ends of Houses, some
whole Roofs, and Sixteen or Twenty whole
Houses in the Out-Parts.</P>
<P>Under the Disaster of this Article, it seems most
proper to place the Loss of the Peoples Lives, who
fell in this Calamity; since most of those, who
had the Misfortune to be killed, were buried, or
beaten to Pieces with the Rubbish of the several
Stacks of Chimneys that fell.</P>
<P>Of these, our Weekly Bills of Mortality gave
us an Account of Twenty One; besides such as
were drown'd in the River, and never found:
and besides above Two Hundred People very
much wounded and maim'd.</P>
<P>One Woman was kill'd by the Fall of a Chim∣ney
in or near the Palace of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, and a Stack
of Chimneys falling in the new unfinish'd Build∣ing
there, and carried away a Piece of the Coin of
the House.</P>
<P>Nine Souldiers were hurt, with the Fall of
the Roof of the Guard-house at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> but
none of them died.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="89"/>
A Distiller in <HI>Duke-street,</HI> with his Wife, and
Maid-servant, were all buried in the Rubbish
of a Stack of Chimneys, which forced all the
Floors, and broke down to the Bottom of the
House; the Wife was taken out alive, though
very much bruised, but her Husband and the
Maid lost their Lives.</P>
<P>One Mr. <HI>Dyer,</HI> a Plaisterer in <HI>Fetter-Lane,</HI>
finding the Danger he was in by the shaking of
the House, jumpt out of Bed to save himself;
and had, in all Probability, Time enough to
have got out of the House, but staying to strike
a Light, a Stack of Chimneys fell in upon him,
kill'd him, and wounded his Wife.</P>
<P>Two Boys at one Mr. <HI>Purefoy</HI>'s, in <HI>Cross-street
Hatton-Garden,</HI> were both kill'd, and buried in
the Rubbish of a Stack of Chimneys; and a
third very much wounded.</P>
<P>A Woman in <HI>Jewin-street,</HI> and Two Persons
more near <HI>Aldersgate-street,</HI> were kill'd; the first,
as it is reported, by venturing to run out of the
House into the Street; and the other Two by
the Fall of a House.</P>
<P>In <HI>Threadneedle-street,</HI> one Mr. <HI>Simpson,</HI> a Scrive∣ner
being in Bed and fast a-sleep, heard nothing
of the Storm; but the rest of the Family being
more sensible of Danger, some of them went
up, and wak'd him; and telling him their own
Apprehension, press'd him to rise; but he too
fatally sleepy, and consequently unconcern'd at
the Danger, told them, he did not apprehend
any Thing; and so, notwithstanding all their
Persuasions, could not be prevailed with to rise:
<PB N="76" REF="90"/>
they had not been gone many Minutes out of
his Chamber, before the Chimneys fell in
broke through the Roof over him, and kill'd
him in his Bed.</P>
<P>A Carpenter in <HI>White-Cross-street</HI> was kill'd
almost in the same Manner, by a Stack of Chim∣neys
of the <HI>Swan</HI> Tavern, which fell into his
House: it was reported, That his Wife earnestly
desir'd him not to go to Bed; and had prevail'd
upon him to sit up till near two a Clock, but
then finding himself very heavy, he would go
to Bed against all his Wife's Intreaties; after
which, she wak'd him, and desir'd him to rise,
which he refus'd, being something angry for
being disturb'd; and going to sleep again, was
kill'd in his Bed: and his Wife, who would
not go to Bed, escap'd.</P>
<P>In this Manner, our Weekly Bills gave us an
Account of Twenty One Persons kill'd in the
City of <HI>London,</HI> and Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>Some of our printed Accounts give us larger
and plainer Accounts of the Loss of Lives, than
I will venture to affirm for Truth; as of several
Houses near <HI>Moor-Fields</HI> levell'd with the Ground:
Fourteen People drowned in a Wherry going to
<HI>Gravesend,</HI> and Five in a Wherry from <HI>Chelsey.</HI>
Not that it is not very probable to be true; but
as I resolve not to hand any thing to Posterity,
but what comes very well attested, I omit such
Relations as I have not extraordinary Assurance
as to the Fact.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="91"/>
The Fall of Bricke-Walls, by the Fury of this
Tempest, in and about <HI>London,</HI> would make
a little Book of it self; and as this affects the
Out-Parts chiefly, where the Gardens and Yards
are wall'd in, so few such have escap'd: at St.
<HI>James</HI>'s a considerable part of the Garden Wall;
at <HI>Greenwich Park</HI> there are several pieces of the
Wall down for an Hundred Rods in a Place;
and some much more, at <HI>Battersey, Chelsey,
Putney,</HI> at <HI>Clapham,</HI> at <HI>Deptford,</HI> at <HI>Hackney,
Islington, Hogsden, Wood's Close</HI> by St. <HI>John's
Street,</HI> and on every side the City, the Walls
of the Gardens have generally felt the Shock,
and lie flat on the Ground twenty, thirty Rod
of walling in a Place.</P>
<P>The publick Edifices of the City come next
under our Consideration; and these have had
their Share in the Fury of this terrible Night.</P>
<P>A part of her Majesty's Palace, as is before
observ'd, with a Stack of Chimneys in the
Centre of the new Buildings, then not quite fi∣nished,
fell with such a terrible Noise as very
much alarm'd the whole Houshold.</P>
<P>The Roof of the Guard-house at <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
as is also observ'd before, was quite blown off;
and the great Vane, or Weather-Cock at <HI>White∣hall</HI>
blown down.</P>
<P>The Lead, on the Tops of the Churches
and other Buildings, was in many Places roll'd
up like a Roll of Parchment, and blown in
some Places clear off from the Buildings;
as at <HI>Westminster Abby,</HI> St. <HI>Andrews Holbourn,
<PB N="78" REF="92"/>
Christ-Church Hospital,</HI> and abundance of other
Places.</P>
<P>Two of the new built Turrets, on the Top of
St. <HI>Mary Aldermary Church,</HI> were blown off,
where of One fell upon the Roof of the Church;
of Eight Pinnacles on the Top of St. <HI>Albans
Woodstreet,</HI> Five of them were blown down;
Part of One of the Spires of St. <HI>Mary Overies</HI>
blown off; Four Pinnacles on the Steeple of
St. <HI>Michael Crooked Lane</HI> blown quite off: The
Vanes and Spindles of the Weather-Cocks, in
many Places, bent quite down; as on St. <HI>Mi∣chael
Cornhil,</HI> St. <HI>Sepulchres,</HI> the <HI>Tower,</HI> and di∣vers
other Places.</P>
<P>It was very remarkable, that the Bridge over
the <HI>Thames</HI> received but little Damage, and not
in Proportion to what in common Reason might
be expected; since the Buildings there stand
high, and are not sheltered, as they are in the
Streets, one by another.</P>
<P>If I may be allow'd to give this Philosopical
Account of it, I hope it may not be absurd;
that the Indraft of the Arches underneath the
Houses giving Vent to the Air, it past there
with a more than common Current; and con∣fequently
relieved the Buildings, by diverting
the Force of the Storm: I ask Pardon of the in∣genious
Reader for this Opinion, if it be not re∣gular,
and only present it to the World for
Want of a better; if those better furnished <HI>that
Way</HI> will supply us with a truer Account, I
shall withdraw mine, and submit to theirs. The
<PB N="79" REF="93"/>
Fact however is certain, that the Houses on the
<HI>Bridge</HI> did not suffer in Proportion to the other
Places; though all must allow, they do not seem
to be stronger built, than other Streets of the
same sort.</P>
<P>Another Observation I cannot but make;
to which, as I have Hundreds of Instances, so
I have many more Witnesses to the Truth of
Fact, and the uncommon Experiment has made
it the more observ'd.</P>
<P>The Wind blew, during the whole Storm,
between the Points of S. W. and N. W. not
that I mean it blew at all these Points, but I
take a Latitude of Eight Points to avoid Excep∣tions,
and to confirm my Argument; since
what I am insisting upon, could not be a natu∣ral
Cause from the Winds blowing in any of those
particular Points.</P>
<P>If a Building stood North and South, it must
be a Consequence that the East-side Slope of
the Roof must be the Lee-side, lie out of the
Wind, be weather'd by the Ridge, and conse∣quently
receive no Damage in a direct Line.</P>
<P>But against this rational way of arguing, we
are convinced by Demonstration and Experi∣ment,
after which Argument must be silent. It
was not in one Place or Two, but in many
Places; that where a Building stood ranging
North and South, the Sides or Slopes of the Roof
to the East and the West, the East-side of the
Roof would be stript and untiled by the Vio∣lence
of the Wind; and the West Side,
<PB N="80" REF="94"/>
which lay open to the Wind, be found and un∣touch'd.</P>
<P>This,
I conceive, must happen either where
the Building had some open Part, as Windows
or Doors to receive the Wind in the Inside,
which being pusht forward by the succeeding
Particles of the Air, must force its Way forward,
and so lift off the Tiling on the Leward Side of
the Building; or it must happen from the Posi∣tion
of such Building near some other higher
Place or Building, where the Wind being re∣puls'd,
must be forc'd back again in Eddies;
and consequently taking the Tiles from the
lower Side of the Roof, rip them up with the
more Ease.</P>
<P>However it was, it appear'd in many Places,
the Windward Side of the Roof would be whole,
and the Leeward Side, or the Side from the
Wind, be untiled; in other Places, a high Build∣ing
next the Wind has been not much hurt,
and a lower Building on the Leeward Side of the
high One clean ript, and hardly a Tile left upon
it: this is plain in the Building of <HI>Christ Church
Hospital</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> where the Building on the
West and South Side of the Cloyster was at least
Twenty Five Foot higher than the East Side,
and yet the Roof of the lower Side on the
East was quite untiled by the Storm; and
remains at the Writing of This covered
with Deal Boards above an Hundred Foot in
Length.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="95"/>
The blowing down of Trees may come in for
another Article in this Part; of which, in Pro∣portion
to the Quantity, here was as much as in
any Part of <HI>England:</HI> Some printed Accounts
tell us of Seventy Trees in <HI>Moorfields</HI> blown down,
which may be true; but that some of them
were Three Yards about, as is affirmed by the
Authors, I cannot allow: above a Hundred
Elms in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> some whereof were of
such Growth, as they tell us they were planted
by Cardinal <HI>Woolsey;</HI> whether that Part of it
be true or not, is little to the Matter, but
only to imply that they were very great Trees:
about <HI>Baums,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Whitmore house,</HI>
there were above Two Hundred Trees blown
down, and some of them of extraordinary Size
broken off in the middle.</P>
<P>And 'twas observ'd, that in the Morning after
the Storm was abated, it blew so hard, the Wo∣men,
who usually go for Milk to the Cow-keep∣ers
in the Villages round the City, were not
able to go along with their Pails on their Heads;
and One, that was more hardy than the rest,
was blown away by the Fury of the Storm, and
forced into a Pond, but by strugling hard got
out, and avoided being drowned; and some
that ventured out with Milk the Evening after,
had their Pails and Milk blown off from their
Heads.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible to enumerate the Particulars
of the Damage suffered, and of the Accidents
which happened under these several Heads, in
and about the City of <HI>London:</HI> The Houses
<PB N="82" REF="96"/>
looked like Skeletons, and an universal Air of
Horror seem'd to sit on the Countenances of the
People; all Business seem'd to be laid aside for
the Time, and People were generally intent
upon getting Help to repair their Habitations.</P>
<P>It pleased God so to direct things, that there
fell no Rain in any considerable Quantity, ex∣cept
what fell the same Night or the ensuing
Day, for near Three Weeks after the Storm,
though it was a Time of the Year that is generally
dripping. Had a wet Rainy Season followed
the Storm, the Damage which would have been
suffered in and about this City to Houshold
Goods, Furniture and Merchandise, would have
been incredible, and might have equall'd all the
the rest of the Calamity: but the Weather
prov'd fair and temperate for near a Month after
the Storm, which gave People a great deal of
Leisure in providing themselves Shelter, and for∣tisying
their Houses against the Accidents of
Weather by Deal Boards, old Tiles, Pieces of Sail
Cloth, Tarpaulin, and the like.</P>

<P>As the Author of this was an Eye-witness and
Sharer of the Particulars in the former Chapter;
so, to furnish the Reader with Accounts as au∣thentick,
and which he has as much cause to de∣pend
upon as if he had seen them, he has the
several Particulars following from like Eye wit∣nesses,
and that in such a manner, as I think
their Testimony is not to be question'd, most of
the Gentlemen being of Piety and Reputation.</P>
<P>And as a Publication was made to desire all
Persons who were willing to contribute to the
forwarding this Work, and to transmit the Me∣mory
of so signal a Judgment to Posterity, that
they would be pleas'd to send up such authen∣tick
Accounts of the Mischiefs, Damages, and
Disasters in their respective Countries that the
World might rely on; it cannot, without a great
breach of Charity, be suppos'd that Men mov'd
by such Principles, without any private Interest
or Advantage, would forge any thing to im∣pose
upon the World, and abuse Mankind in
Ages to come.</P>
<P>Interest, Parties, Sttife, Faction, and parti∣cular
Malice, with all the scurvy Circumstances
attending such things, may prompt Men to
strain a Tale beyond its real Extent; but, that
Men shou'd invent a Story to amuse Posterity,
in a case where they have no manner of Motive,
where the only Design is to preserve the Re∣membrance
of Divine Vengeance, and put our
<PB N="84" REF="98"/>
Children in mind of God's Judgments upon
their sinful Fathers, this would be telling a Lye
for God's sake, and doing Evil for the sake of
it self, which is a step beyond the Devil.</P>
<P>Besides, as most of our Relators have not
only given us their Names, and sign'd the Ac∣counts
they have sent, but have also given us
Leave to hand their Names down to Posterity
with the Record of the Relation they give, we
would hope no Man will be so uncharitable to
believe that Men would be forward to set their
Names to a voluntary Untruth, and have them∣selves
recorded to Posterity for having, without
Motion, Hope, Reward, or any other reason,
impos'd a Falsity upon the World, and disho∣nour'd
our Relation with the useless Banter of an
Untruth.</P>
<P>We cannot therefore but think, that as the
Author believes himself sufficiently back'd by
the Authority of the Vouchers he presents, so
after what has been here premis'd, no Man will
have any room to suspect us of Forgery.</P>
<P>The ensuing Relation therefore, as to Dama∣ges
in the Country, shall consist chiefly of Let∣ters
from the respective Places where such things
have happen'd; only that as all our Letters are
not concise enough to be printed as they are,
where it is otherwise the Letter is digested into
a Relation only; in which the Reader is assur'd
we have always kept close to the matter of
fact.</P>
<P>And first, I shall present such Accounts as
are entire, and related by Men of Letters,
<PB N="85" REF="99"/>
principally by the Clergy; which shall be given
you in their own Words.</P>
<P>The first is from <HI>Stowmarket</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> where,
by the Violence of the Storm, the finest Spire
in that County, and but new built, <HI>viz.</HI> with∣in
thirty Years, was overthrown, and fell upon
the Church. The Letter is sign'd by the reve∣rend
Minister of the Place, and vouched by
two of the principal Inhabitants, as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving seen an Advertisement of a Design
to perpetuate the Remembrance of the
late dreadful Storm, by publishing a Collection
of all the remarkable Accidents occasion'd by it,
and supposing the Damage done to our Church
to be none of the least, we were willing to con∣tribute
something to your Design, by sending
you an Account thereof as follows.</P>
<P>We had formerly a Spire of Timber covered
with Lead, of the height of 77 Foot; which be∣ing
in danger of falling, was taken down: and
in the Year 1674, with the Addition of 10
Loads of new Timber, 21 thousand and 8
hundred weight of Lead, a new one was erect∣ed,
100 Foot high from the Steeple, with a
Galiery at the height of 40 Foot all open, where∣in
hung a Clock-Bell of between 2 and 3 hun∣dred
Weight. The Spire stood but 8 Yards a∣bove
the Roof of the Church; and yet by the
extreme Violence of the Storm, a little before 6
in the Morning the Spire was thrown down;
<PB N="86" REF="100"/>
and carrying with it all the Battlements on the
East side, it fell upon the Church at the distance
of 28 Foot; for so much is the distance between
the Steeple and the first Breach, which is on the
North-side of the middle Roof, of the length of
17 Foot, where it brake down 9 Spars clean,
each 23 Foot long, and severally supported with
very strong Braces. The Spire inclining to the
North, fell cross the middle Wall, and broke
off at the Gallery, the lower part falling in at
the asoresaid Breach, and the upper upon the
North Isle, which is 24 Foot wide, with a flat
Roof lately built, all new and very strong: It
carried all before it from side to side, making a
Breach 37 Foot long, breaking in sunder two
large Beams that went a-cross, which were 12
Inches broad and 15 deep, besides several other
smaller. Besides these two Breaches, there is a
great deal of Damage done by the Fall of great
Stones upon other parts of the Roof, as well as
by the Wind's riving up the Lead, and a third
part of the Pews broken all in pieces, every
thing falling into the Church, except the Wea∣ther-cock,
which was found in the Church∣yard,
at a considerable distance, in the great
Path that goes cross by the East End of the
Church. It will cost above 400 <HI>l.</HI> to make all
good as it was before. There were 3 single
Chimneys blown down, and a Stack of 4 more
together, all about the same time; and some
others so shaken, that they were forc'd to be
pull'd down; but, we thank God, no body
hurt, tho' one Bed was broken in pieces that
<PB N="87" REF="101"/>
was very o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t lain in: no body lay in it that
Night. Most Houses suffered something in their
Tiling, and generally all round the Country,
there is incredible Damage done to Churches,
Houses, and Barns.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MEeting with an Advertisement of yours in
the <HI>Gazette</HI> of <HI>Monday</HI> last, I very much
approved of the Design, thinking it might be a
great Motive towards making People, when
they hear the Fate of others, return Thanks to
Almighty God for his Providence in preserving
them. I accordingly was resolved to send you
all I knew. The Place where I have for some
time lived is <HI>Besselsleigh,</HI> in <HI>Barkshire,</HI> about four
Miles S. W. of <HI>Oxon.</HI> The Wind began with us
much about One of the Clock in the Morning,
and did not do much harm, only in untiling
Houses, blowing down a Chimney or two,
without any Person hurt, and a few Trees: but
what was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he only thing that was strange, and
<PB N="88" REF="102"/>
to be observed, was a very tall Elm, which was
found the next Morning standing, but perfectly
twisted round; the Root a little loosen'd, but
not torn up. But what happened the Afternoon
preceding, is abundantly more surprizing, and
is indeed the Intent of this Letter.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday</HI> the 26th of <HI>November,</HI> in the After∣noon,
about Four of the Clock, a Country Fel∣low
came running to me in a great Fright, and
very earneslly entreated me to go and see a Pil∣lar,
as he call'd it, in the Air, in a Field hard
by. I went with the Fellow; and when I came,
found it to be a Spout marching directly with
the Wind: and I can think of nothing I can
compare it to better than the Trunk of an Ele∣phant,
which it resembled, only much bigger.
It was extended to a great Length, and swept
the Ground as it went, leaving a Mark behind.
It crossed a Field; and what was very strange
(and which I should scarce have been induced
to believe had I not my self seen it, besides seve∣ral
Country-men who were astonish'd at it)
meeting with an Oak that stood towards the
middle of the Field) snapped the Body of it
asunder. Afterwards crossing a Road, it suck∣ed
up the Water that was in the Cart-ruts: then
coming to an old Barn, it tumbled it down,
and the Thatch that was on the Top was car∣ried
about by the Wind, which was then very
high, in great confusion. After this I followed
it no farther, and therefore saw no more of it.
But a Parishoner of mine going from hence to
<HI>Hinksey,</HI> in a Field about a quarter of a Mile off
<PB N="89" REF="103"/>
of this Place, was on the sudden knock'd down,
and lay upon the Place till some People came by
and brought him home; and he is not yet quite
recovered. Having examined him, by all I can
collect both from the Time, and Place, and Man∣ner
of his being knock'd down, I must conclude
it was done by the Spout, which, if its Force
had not been much abated, had certainly kill'd
him: and indeed I attribute his Illness more to
the Fright, than the sudden Force with which
he was struck down.</P>
<P>I will not now enter into a Dissertation on the
Cause of Spouts, but by what I can understand
they are caused by nothing but the Circumgy∣ration
of the Clouds, made by two contrary
Winds meeting in a Point, and condensing the
Cloud till it falls in the Shape we see it; which
by the twisting Motion sucks up Water, and
doth much Mischief to Ships at Sea, where they
happen oftner than at Land. Whichever of the
two Winds prevails, as in the above-menti∣oned
was the S. W. at last dissolves and dissipates
the Cloud, and then the Spout disappears.</P>
<P>This is all I have to communicate to you,
wishing you all imaginable Success in your Col∣lection.
Whether you insert this Account, I
leave wholly to your own Discretion; but can
assure you, that to most of these things, tho' ve∣ry
surprizing, I was my self an Eye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>witness. I

for some time before the Tempest.</P>

<P>HAving seen in the <HI>Gazettee</HI> an Intimation,
that there would be a Memorial drawn
up of the late terrible Wind, and the Effects of
it, and that the Composer desired Informations
from credible Persons, the better to enable him
to do the same, I thought good to intimate what
happen'd in this Town, and its Neighbourhood.
1. The Weather-cock of <HI>All-Saints</HI> Church being
placed on a mighty Spindle of Iron, was bowed
together, and made useless. Many Sheets of
Lead on that Church, as also on St. <HI>Giles's</HI> and
St. <HI>Sepulehres,</HI> rowled up like a Scroll. Three
Windmills belonging to the Town blown down,
to the Amazement of all Beholders; the mighty
upright Post below the Floor of the Mills being
snapt in two like a Reed. Two entire Stacks of
Chimneys in a House uninhabited fell on two
several Roofs, and made a most amazing Ruin
in the Chambers, Floors, and even to the lower
<PB N="91" REF="105"/>
Windows and Wainscot, splitting and tearing it
as if a Blow by Gun-powder had happen'd. The
Floods at this instant about the South Bridge,
from a violent S. W. Wind, rose to a great and
amazing height; the Wind coming over or a∣thwart
large open Meadows, did exceeding da∣mage
in that part of the Town, by blowing
down some whole Houses, carrying whole Roofs
at once into the Streets, and very many lesser
Buildings of Tanners, Fell-mongers, Dyers,
Glue-makers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet, through the Goodness of
God, no Person killed or maimed: the mighty
Doors of the Sessions-house, barr'd and lock'd,
forced open, whereby the Wind entring, made
a miserable Havock of the large and lofty Win∣dows:
a Pinnacle on the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> with the
Fane, was also blown down. To speak of Hou∣ses
shatter'd, Corn-ricks and Hovels blown from
their Standings, would be endless. In Sir <HI>Tho∣mas
Samwell's</HI> Park a very great headed Elm was
blown over the Park-Wall into the Road, and
yet never touched the Wall, being carried some
Yards. I have confined my self to this Town.

Design, he may use it or dismiss it at his Dis∣cretion.

<P>THIS Parish is a very large one in the Coun∣ty
of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> on one Side whereof run∣neth
the River <HI>Severn,</HI> which by Reason of the
Violence of the late Storm beat down and tore
to pieces the Sea Wall (which is made of great
Stones, and Sticks which they call Rouses, a Yard
and half long, about the Bigness of ones Thigh ram∣med
into the Ground as firm as possible) in many
Places, and levell'd it almost with the Ground,
forcing vast Quantities of Earth a great Distance
from the Shore, and Stones, many of which
were above a Hundred Weight: and hereby the
<HI>Severn</HI> was let in above a Mile over one part of
the Parish, and did great Damage to the Land;
it carried away one House which was by the
Sea-side, and a Gentleman's Stable, wherein
was a Horse, into the next Ground; and then
the Stable fell to pieces, and so the Horse came
out. There is one thing more remarkable in
this Parish, and 'tis this: Twenty Six Sheets of
<PB N="93" REF="107"/>
Lead, hanging all together, were blown off from
the middle Isle of our Church, and were carried
over the North Isle, which is a very large one,
without touching it; and into the Church-yard
ten Yards distant from the Church; and they
were took up all joyned together as they were
on the Roof; the Plummer told me that the
Sheets weighed each Three Hundred and a half
one with another. This is what is most observable
in our Parish; but I shall give you an Account of
one thing (which perhaps you may have from
other Hands) that happen'd in another, call'd
<HI>Kingscote,</HI> a little Village about Three Miles
from <HI>Tedbury,</HI> and Seven from us; where <HI>Willi∣am
Kingscote</HI> Es{que} has many Woods; among
which was one Grove of very tall Trees, being
each near Eighty Foot high; the which he great∣ly
valued for the Tallness and Prospect of them,
and therefore resolv'd never to cut them down:
But it so happen'd, that Six Hundred of them,
within the Compass of Five Acres were whol∣ly
blown down; (and suppos'd to be much at
the same time) each Tree tearing up the Ground
with its Root; so that the Roots of most of the
Trees, with the Turf and Earth about them,
stood up at least Fifteen or Sixteen Foot high;
the lying down of which Trees is an amazing
Sight to all Beholders. This Account was gi∣ven
by the Gentleman himself, whom I know ve∣ry
well. I have no more to add, but that I am,

<P>I Received a printed Paper sometime since,
wherein I was desired to send you an Account
of what happen'd in the late Storm: and I should
have answered it sooner, but was willing to
make some Enquiry first about this Country;
and by what I can hear or learn, the dismal Ac∣cident
of our late Bishop and Lady was most
remarkable; who was killed by the Fall of two
Chimney Stacks, which fell on the Roof, and
drove it in upon my Lord's Bed, forced it
quite through the next Flower down into the
Hall, and buried them both in the Rubbish;
and 'tis suppos'd my Lord was getting up, for
he was found some Distance from my Lady,
who was found in her Bed; but my Lord had
his Morning Gown on, so that 'tis suppos'd he
was coming from the Bed just as it fell. We
had likewise two small Houses blown flat down
just as the People were gone out to a Neighbour's
House; and several other Chimney Stacks fell
down, and some through the Roof, but no other
Accident as to Death in this Town or near it:
abundance of Tiles are blown off, and likewise
Thatch in and about this Town, and several
Houses uncover'd, in the Country all about us,
abundance of Apple and Elm Trees are rooted
up by the Ground; and also abundance of Wheat
and Hay-mows blown down: at <HI>Huntspil,</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="109"/>
about twelve Miles from this Town, there was
Four or Five small Vessels drove a-shoar which
remain there still, and 'tis suppos'd cannot be
got off; and in the same Parish, the Tide broke
in Breast high; but all the People escap'd only
one Woman, who was drowned. These are
all the remarkable Things that happen'd near
us, as I can hear of; and is all, but my
humble Service; and beg Leave to subscribe

<P>THE Dreadful Storm did this Church but

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honour'd Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Obedience to your Request I have here
sent you a particular Account of the da∣mages
sustain'd in our Parish by the late Vio∣lent
Storm; and because that of our Church is
the most material which I have to impart to
you, I shall therefore begin with it. It is the
fineness of our Church which magnifies our
present loss, for in the whole it is a large and
noble structure, compos'd within and without
of Ashler curiously wrought, and consisting
of a stately Roof in the middle, and two
Isles runing a considerable length from one
end of it to the other, makes a very beautiful
Figure. It is also adorn'd with 28 admired
and Celebrated Windows, which, for the va∣riety
and fineness of the Painted Glass that was
in them, do justly attract the Eyes of all cu∣rious
Travellers to inspect and behold them;
nor is it more famous for its Glass, than new∣ly
renown'd for the Beauty of its Seats and
Paving, both being chiefly the noble Gift of
that pious and worthy Gentleman <HI>Andrew Bar∣ker,</HI>
Es{que} the late Deceas'd Lord of the Man
nor. So that all things consider'd, it does
equal, at least, if not exceed, any Parochial
Church in <HI>England.</HI> Now that part of it
which most of all felt the fury of the Winds,
was, a large middle West Window, in Dimen∣sion
about 15 Foot wide, and 25 Foot high;
<PB N="98" REF="112"/>
it represents the general Judgment, and is so
fine a piece of Art, that 1500 <HI>l.</HI> has formerly
been bidden for it, a price, though very temp∣ting,
yet were the Parishoners so just and ho∣nest
as to refuse it. The upper part of this
Window, just above the place where our Sa∣viour's,
Picture is drawn sitting on a Rain∣bow,
and the Earth his Foot-stool, is entirely
ruin'd, and both sides are so shatter'd and
torn, especially the left, that upon a general
Computation, a fourth part, at least, is blown
down and destroy'd. The like Fate has ano∣ther
West Window on the left side of the
former, in Dimension about 10 Foot broad,
and 15 Foot high, sustain'd; the upper half
of which is totally broke, excepting one Stone
Mannel. Now if this were but ordinary
Glass, we might quickly compute what our
repairs would Cost, but we the more lament
our misfortune herein, because the Paint of
these two, as of all the other Windows in our
Church, is stain'd thro' the Body of the Glass;
so that if that be true which is generaly said,
that this Art is lost, than have we an irretrie∣vable
loss. There are other damages about
our Church, which, tho' not so great as the
former, do yet as much testify how strong
and boisterous the Winds were, for they un∣bedded
3 Sheets of Lead upon the uppermost
Rooff, and roll'd them up like so much Paper,
Over the Church-porch, a large Pinnacle and
two Battlements were blown down upon the
<PB N="99" REF="113"/>
leads of it, but resting there, and their fall be∣ing
short, these will be repair'd with little
Cost. This is all I have to say concerning
our Church: Our Houses come next to be
considered, and here I may tell you, that
(thanks be to God) the effects of the Storm
were not so great as they have been in many
other places; several Chimneys, and Tiles,
and Slats, were thrown down, but no body
kill'd or wounded. Some of the Poor, be∣cause
their Houses were Thatch'd, were the
greatst sufferers; but to be particular here∣in,
would be very frivolous, as well as vexa∣tious.
One Instance of Note ought not to
omitted; on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 26th, being the day
after the Storm, about 2-a-Clock in the After∣noon,
without any previous warning, a sud∣den
flash of Lightning, with a short, but vio∣lent
clap of Thunder, immediately following
it like the Discharge of Ordnance, fell upon
a new and strong built House in the middle of
our Town, and at the same of the Lead of an
upper Window, and struck the Mistress of
the House into a Swoon, but this, as appear'd
afterwards, prov'd the effect more of fear,
than of any real considerable hurt to be found
about her. I have nothing more to add, unless
it be the fall of several Trees and Ricks of
Hay amongst us, but these being so common
every where, and not very many in number

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOme time since I received a Letter
from you, to give you an Account of
the most particular Things that hapned in the
late dreadful Tempest of Wind, and in the
first Place is the Copy of a Letter from a Bro∣ther
of mine, that was an Exciseman of <HI>Ax∣bridge,</HI>
in the West of our Country of <HI>somer-sat:</HI>
these are his Words,</P>
<P>What I know of the Winds in these Parts,
are, that it broke down many Trees, and that
the House of one <HI>Richard Henden, of Charter∣House</HI>
on <HI>Mendip,</HI> call'd <HI>Piney,</HI> was almost
<PB N="101" REF="115"/>
blown down, and in saving their House, they,
and the Servants, and others, heard grievous
Cries and Scrieches in the Air. The Tower of
<HI>Compt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Bishop</HI> was much shatter'd and the
Leads that cover'd it were taken clean away,
and laid flat in the Church-Yard: The House
of <HI>John Cray</HI> of that place, received much and
strange Damages, which together with his
part in the Sea-wall, amounted to 500 <HI>l.</HI>
Near the Salt-works in the Parish of <HI>Burnham,</HI>
was driven five trading Vessels, as Colliers
and Corn-dealers, betwixt <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Bridg∣water,</HI>
at least 100 Yards on Pasture Ground.
In the North Marsh, on the sides of <HI>Bristol</HI>
River, near <HI>Ken</HI> at <HI>Walton Woodspring,</HI> the
Waters broke with such Violence, that it came
six Miles into the Country drowning much
Cattel, carrying away several Hay-ricks and
Stacks of Corn: And at a Farm at <HI>Churchill</HI>
near <HI>Wrington,</HI> it blew down 150 Elms that
grew most in Rows, and were laid as Uniform
as Soldiers lodge their Arms.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cheddar</HI> near <HI>Axbridge,</HI> was much harm
done in Apple-trees, Houses, and such like;
but what's worth remark, tho' not the very
Night of the Tempest, a Company of wicked
People being at a Wedding of one <HI>Thomas Mar∣shall,
John,</HI> the Father of the said <HI>Thomas,</HI> be∣ing
as most of the Company was very Drunk,
after much filthy Discourse while he was eat∣ing,
a strange Cat pulling something from his
<PB N="102" REF="116"/>
Trenchard, he Cursing her, stoopt to take it
up, and died immediately.</P>
<P>At <HI>Brewton</HI> what was most Remarkable,
was this, that one <HI>John Dicer</HI> of that Town, lay
the Night as the Tempest was, in the Barn
of one <HI>John Seller,</HI> the Violence of the Wind
broke down the Roof of the Barn, but fortu∣nately
for him there was a Ladder which staid up
a Rafter, which would have fell upon the said
<HI>John Dicer;</HI> but he narrowly escaping being
killed, did slide himself thro' the broken Roof,
and so got over the Wall without any great
hurt. What hurt was done more about that
Town is not so considerable as in other Places;
Such as blowing off the Thatch from a great
many back Houses of the Town; for the
Town is most tiled with a sort of heavy Tile,
that the Wind had no power to move; there
was some hurt done to the Church, which was
not above 40 <HI>s.</HI> besides the Windows, where
was a considerable damage, the Lady <HI>Fitzhard∣ing's</HI>
House standing by the-Church, the Bat∣tlement
with part of the Wall of the House
was blown down, which 'tis said, above 20
Men with all their strength could not have
thrown down; besides, a great many Trees
in the Park torn up by the Roots, and laid in
very good Order one after another; it was
taken notice that the Wind did not come in a
full Body at once, but it came in several Gusts,
as my self have taken Notice as I rid the
Country, that in half a Miles riding I could
<PB N="103" REF="117"/>
not see a Tree down, nor much hurt to Hou∣ses,
then again I might for some space see the
Trees down, and all the Houses shattred: and
I have taken Notice that it run so all up the
Country in such a Line as the Wind sat; about
One of the Clock it turn'd to the North West,
but at the beginning was at South West;
I my self was up until One and then I went
to Bed, but the highest of the Wind was af∣ter
that, so that my Bed did shake with me.</P>
<P>What was about <HI>Wincanton,</HI> was, that one
Mrs. <HI>Gapper</HI> had 36 Elm-trees growing toge∣ther
in a Row, 35 of them was blown down;
and one <HI>Eage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill</HI> of the same Town, and his
Family being a Bed did arise, hearing the
House begin to Crak, and got out of the Doors
with his whole Family, and as soon as they
were out the Roof of the House fell in, and
the Violence of the Wind took of the Chil∣dren's
Head-cloaths, that they never saw them
afterwards.</P>
<P>At <HI>Evercreech,</HI> three Miles from <HI>Brew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI>
there were a poor Woman beg'd for Lodging
in the Barn of one <HI>Edmond Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that same
Night that the Storm was, she was wet the
Day before in Travelling, so she hung up her
Cloaths in the Barn, and lay in the Straw;
but when the Storm came it blew down the
Roof of the Barn where she lay, and she nar∣rowly
escaped with her Life, being much
<PB N="104" REF="118"/>
bruised, and got out almost naked through
the Roof where it was broken most, and went
to the dwelling House of the said <HI>Edmond Pe∣ny,</HI>
and they did arise, and did help her to
something to cover her, till they could get
out her Cloaths; that place of <HI>Evercreech</HI> re∣ceived
a great deal of hurt in their Houses,
which is too large to put here.</P>
<P>At <HI>Batcomb</HI> Easterly of <HI>Evercreech,</HI> they had
a great deal of Damage done as I said before, it
lay exactly with the Wind from <HI>Evercreech,</HI>
and both places received a great deal of Da∣mage;
there was one Widow <HI>Walter</HI> lived in a
House by it self, the Wind carried away the
Roof, and the Woman's pair of Bodice, that
was never heard of again, and the whole Fa∣mily
escaped narrowly with their Lives; all
the Battlements of the Church on that side of
the Tower next to the Wind was blown in,
and a great deal of Damage done to the
Church.</P>
<P>At <HI>Shipton Mallet</HI> was great Damages done,
as I was told by the Post that comes to <HI>Brew∣ton,</HI>
that the Tiles of the Meeting House was
blown off, and being a sort of light Tiles they
flew against the Neighbouring Windows, and
broke them to pieces: And at <HI>Chalton</HI> near
<HI>Shepton Mallet</HI> at one <HI>Abbot's,</HI> the Roof was
carried from the Walls of the House, and the
House mightily shaken, and seemingly the Foun∣dation
removed, and in the Morning they
<PB N="105" REF="119"/>
found a Foundation Stone of the House upon
the top of the Wall, where was a shew in the
Ground of its being driven out. At <HI>Dinder</HI>
within two Miles of <HI>Shepton,</HI> there was one
<HI>John Allen,</HI> and his Son, being out of Doors
in the midst of the Tempest, they saw a great
Body of Fire flying on the side of a Hill,
call'd <HI>Dinder-hill,</HI> about half a Mile from
them, with a Shew of black in the midst of it,
and another Body of Fire following it, some∣thing
smaller than the former.</P>
<P>There has been a strange thing at <HI>Butly,</HI>
eight Miles from <HI>Brewton,</HI> which was thought
to be Witchcraft, where a great many unusual
Things happened to one <HI>Pope,</HI> and his Family,
especially to a Boy, that was his Son, that
having lain several Hours Dead, when he
came to himself, he told his Father, and seve∣ral
of his Neighbours, strange Stories of his
being carried away by some of his Neigh∣bours
that have been counted wicked Persons;
the Things have been so strangely related
that Thousands of People have gone to see
and hear it; it lasted about a Year or more:
But since the Storm I have inquired of the
Neighbours how it was, and they tell me,
that since the late Tempest of Wind the House
and People have been quiet; for its generally
said, that there was some Conjuration in quiet∣ing
of that House. If you have a desire to hear
any farther Account of it, I will make it my
Business to inquire farther of it, for there were

At <HI>Cockeup,</HI> two Miles from us, was a Barn
blown down, and several Elms blown down
a Cross the High-way, so that there was no
passage; a great Oak of about nine or ten
Loads was blown down, having a Raven sitting

and held him fast; but the Raven received no
hurt: At <HI>Duckelton,</HI> a little thatch't House
was taken off the Ground-pening, and remov∣ed

blown down, one House had a sheet of Lead
taken from one side and blown over to the o∣ther,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Brief but exact Remarks on the late Dreadful
Storms of Wind, as it affected the Town, and
the Parts adjacent.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IMPRIMUS.</HI> At <HI>Ashil</HI>- Parish 3 Miles West
from this Town, the Stable belonging
to the Hare and Hounds Inn was blown down.
in which were three Horses, one kill'd, ano∣ther
very much bruised.</P>
<P>2. At <HI>Jurdans,</HI> a Gentleman's S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at in the
same Parish, there was a Brick Stable, whose
Roof, one Back, and one End Wall, were all
thrown down, and four foot in depth of the
Fore Wall; in this Stable were 4 Horses, which
by reason of the Hay-loft that bore up the
Roof, were all preserv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="122"/>
3. At <HI>Sevington</HI> Parish, three Miles East
from this Town, <HI>John Hutkens</HI> had the Roof
of a new built House heaved clean off the
Walls. <HI>Note,</HI> the House was not glazed, and
the Roof was thatch'd.</P>
<P>4. In <HI>White Larkington</HI> Park, a Mile East
from this Town, besides four or five hundred
tall Trees broken and blown down, (admira∣ble
to behold, what great Roots was turned
up) there were three very large Beaches, two
of them that were near five Foot thick in the
Stem were broken off, one of them near the
Root, the other was broken off twelve Foot
above, and from that place down home to the
Root was shattered and flown; the other that
was not broken, cannot have less than forty
Waggon Loads in it; a very fine Walk of Trees
before the House all blown down, and broke
down the Roof of a Pidgeon House, the Rooke∣ry
carried away in Lanes, the Lodg-House da∣maged
in the Roof, and one End by the fall of
Trees. In the Garden belonging to the House,
was a very fine Walk of tall Firrs, twenty of
which were broken down.</P>
<P>5. The damage in the Thatch of Houses,
(which is the usual Covering in these Parts)
is so great and general, that the price of Reed
arose from twenty Shillings to fifty or three
Pounds a Hundred; insomuch that to shelter
themselves from the open Air, many poor
People were glad to use Bean, Helm and Furse
to thatch their Houses with, Things
<PB N="109" REF="123"/>
never known to be put to such Use before.</P>
<P>6. At <HI>Kingston,</HI> a Mile distance from this
Town, the Church was very much shattered
in its Roof, and Walls too, and all our Coun∣try
Churches much shattered, so that Churches
and Gentlemen's Houses which were tiled,
were so shattered in their Roofs, that at pre∣sent,
they are generally patch'd with Reed,
not in Compliance with the Mode, but the Ne∣cessity
of the Times.</P>
<P>7. At <HI>Broadway,</HI> two Miles West of this
Town, <HI>Hugh Betty,</HI> his Wife, and four Chil∣dren
being in his House, it was by the vio∣lence
of the Storm blown down, one of his
Children killed, his Wife wounded, but reco∣vered,
the rest escaped with their Lives. A
large Alms-Houses had most of the Tile blown
off, and other Houses much shattered; a very
large Brick Barn blown down, Walls and Roof
to the Ground.</P>
<P>8. Many large Stacks of Wheat were broken,
some of the Sheaves carried two or three Hun∣dred
Yards from the Place, many Stacks of
Hay turned over, some Stacks of Corn heaved
off the Stadle, and set down on the Ground,
and not broken.</P>
<P>9. <HI>Dowlish Walk,</HI> two Miles South East,
the Church was very much shattered, several
Load of Stones fell down, not as yet repair'd,
therefore can't express the damage. A very
large Barn broken down that stood near the
<PB N="110" REF="124"/>
Church, much damage was done to Orchards,
not only in this Place, but in all places round,
some very fine Orchards quite destroyed;
some to their great Cost had the Trees set up
right again, but a Storm of Wind came after,
which threw down many of the Trees again;
as to Timber Trees, almost all our high Trees
were broken down in that violent Storm.</P>
<P>10. In this Town <HI>Henry Dunster,</HI> his Wife

<P>The Church, in this Place, scap'd very well,
as to its Roof, being cover'd with Lead only
on the Chancel; the Lead was at the top of
the Roof heaved up, and roll'd together, more

cutting the Sheets of Lead, which was done

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As the Undertaking you are engag'd in,
to preserve the Remembrance of the late
dreadful Tempest, is very commendable in it
self, and may in several respects be serviceable
not only to the present Age, but also to Po∣sterity;
so it merits a suitable Encouragement,
and, 'tis hop'd, it will meet with such, from all
that have either a true sense of Religion, or
<PB N="112" REF="126"/>
have had any sensible share of the care of Pro∣vidence
over them, or of the goodness of God
unto them in the Land of the Living, upon
that occasion. There are doubtless vast num∣bers
of People in all Parts (where the Tem∣pest
raged) that have the greatest reason (as
the Author of this Paper for one hath) to bless
God for their wonderful preservation, and to
tell it to the Generation following. But to
detain you no longer with Preliminaries, I
shall give you a faithful Account of what oc∣curr'd
in my Neighbourhood (according to
the Conditions mention'd in the Advertise∣ment
in the <HI>Gazette</HI>) worthy, at least, of my
notice, if not of the Undertakers; and I can
assure you, that the several Particulars were
either such as I can vouch-for on my own cer∣tain
Knowledge and Observation, or else such
as I am satisfy'd of the truth of by the Testi∣mony
of others, whose Integrity I have no
reason to suspect. I will say no more than
this in general, concerning the Storm, that, at
its height, it seem'd, for some hours, to be a
perfect Hurrican, the Wind raging from every
Quarter, especially from all the Points of
the Compass, from <HI>N. E.</HI> to the <HI>N. W.</HI> as the
dismal Effects of it in these Parts do evident∣ly
demonstrate, in the demolishing of Buil∣dings
(or impairing 'em at best) and in the
throwing up <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast numbers of Trees by the
Roots, or snapping them off in their Bodies,
or larger Limbs. But as to some remarkable
<PB N="113" REF="127"/>
Particulars, you may take these following,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. The Parish-Church receiv'd little dam∣mage,
tho' it stands high, the chief was in some
of the Windows on the N. side, and in the fall of
the Top-stone of one of the Pinnacles, which fell
on a House adjoining to the Tower with little
hurt to the Roof, from which glancing it rest∣ed
on the Leads of the South-Isle of the
Church. At the fall of it an aged Woman li∣ving
in the said House on which the Stone fell,
heard horrible Scrieches (as she constantly a∣verrs)
in the Air, but none before nor after∣wards.</P>
<P>2.
Two stone Chimney-tops were thrown
down, and 2 broad Stones of each of them lay
at even poize on the respective ridges of both
the Houses, and tho' the Wind sat full against
one of them to have thrown it off, (and then
it had fallen over a Door, in and out at which
several People were passing during the Storm)
and tho' the other fell against the Wind, yet
neither of the said Stones stirr'd.</P>
<P>3. A Stone of near 400 Weight, having
lain about 7 Years under a Bank, defended
from the Wind as it then sate, tho' it lay so
long as to be fix'd in the ground, and was as
much out of the Wind, as could be, being
fenced by the Bank, and a low Stone-wall up∣on
the Bank, none of which was demolish'd,
tho' 2 small Holms standing in the Bank be∣tween
the Wall, and the Stone, at the foot of
<PB N="114" REF="128"/>
the Bank were blown up by the roots; I say,
this Stone, tho' thus fenced from the Storm,
was carried from the place where it lay, into
an hollow-way beneath, at least seven Yards
from the place, where it was known to have
lain for 7 Years before.</P>
<P>4. A Widdow-woman living in one part of
an House by her self, kept her Bed till the
House over her was uncover'd, and she ex∣pected
the fall of the Timber and Walls; but
getting below Stairs in the dark, and open∣ing
the Door to fly for shelter, the Wind was
so strong in the Door, that she could neither
get out at it, tho' she attempted to go out
on her knees and hands, nor could she shut
the Door again with all her strenght, but was
forced to sit alone for several hours ('till the
Storm slacken'd,) fearing every Gust would
have buried her in the Ruins; and yet it
pleas'd God to preserve her, for the House
(tho' a feeble one) stood over the Storm.</P>
<P>5. Another, who made Malt in his Barn,
had been turning his Malt sometime before
the Storm was at its height, and another of the
Family being desirous to go again into the
said Barn sometime after, was disswaded from
it, and immediately thereupon the said Barn
was thrown down by the Storm.</P>
<P>6. But a much narrower Escape had one,
for whose safety the Collector of these Passa∣ges
has the greatest reason to bless and praise
the great Preserver of Men, who was twice
<PB N="115" REF="129"/>
in his Bed that dismal Night (tho' he had
warning sufficient to deter him the first time
by the falling of some of the Seiling on his
Back and Shoulders, as he was preparing to
go to Bed) and was altogether insensible of
the great danger he was in, 'till the next morn∣ing
after the Day-light appear'd, when he
found the Tiles, on the side of the House op∣posite
to the main Stress of the Weather,
blown up in two places, one of which was o∣ver
his Beds-head (about 9 foot above it) in
which 2 or 3 Laths being broken, let down
a Square of 8 or 10 Stone Tiles upon one
single Lath, where they hung dropping in∣ward
a little, and bended the Lath like a Bow,
but fell not: What the consequence of their
Fall had been, was obvious to as many as saw
it, and none has more reason to magnify God's
great Goodness, in this rescue of his Providence,
than the Relater.</P>
<P>7. A young Man of the same Parish, who
was sent abroad to look after some black Cat∣tle
and Sheep that fed in an Inclosure, in, or
near to which there were some Stacks of
Corn blown down, reports, That tho' he had
much difficulty to find the Inclosure in the
dark, and to get thither by reason of the Tem∣pest
then raging in the height of its fury;
yet being there, he saw a mighty Body of Fire
on an high ridge of Hills, about 3 parts of a
Mile from the said Inclosure, which gave <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
clear a Light into the Valley below, as that
<PB N="116" REF="130"/>
by it the said young Man could distinctly de∣scry
all the Sheep and Cattle in the said Pa∣sture,
so as to perceive there was not one
wanting.</P>
<P>8. At <HI>Ashegrove,</HI> in the same Parish (where
many tall Trees were standing on the steep side
of an Hill) there were two Trees of considerable
bigness blown up against the side of the Hill,
which seems somewhat strange, to such as
have seen how many are blown, at the same
place, a quite contrary way, <HI>i. e.</HI> down the
Hill; and to fall downwards was to fall with
the Wind, as upward, was to fall against it.</P>
<P>9. One in this Neighbourhood had a Pop∣lar
in his Back-side of near 16 Yards high
blown down, which standing near a small
Current of Water, the Roots brought up near
a Tun of Earth with them, and there the Tree
lay for some days after the Storm; but when
the Top or Head of the Tree was saw'd off
from the Body (tho' the Boughs were nothing
to the weight of the But End, yet) the Tree
mounted, and fell back into its place, and
stood as upright without its Head, as ever it
had done with it. And the same happen'd
at the Lady <HI>Banks</HI> her House near <HI>Shastsbury,</HI>
where a Wall-nut-Tree was thrown down
in a place that declin'd somewhat, and after
the greater Limbs had been cut off in the day
time, went back in the Night following, of it
self, and now stands in the same place and
pos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure it stood in before it was blown down.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="131"/>
I saw it standing the 16th of this Instant, and
could hardly perceive any Token of its hav∣ing
been Down, so very exactly it sell
back into it's place. This is somewhat the
more remarkable, because the Ground (as I
said) was declining, and consequently the
Tree raised against the Hill. To this I shall
only add, at present, that</P>
<P>10. This Relator lately riding thro' a neigh∣bouring
Parish, saw two Trees near two Hou∣les
thrown besides the said Houses, and very
near each House, which yet did little or no
harm, when if they had fallen with the Wind,
they must needs have fallen directly upon the
said Houses. And</P>
<P>11. That this Relator had two very tall
Elms thrown up by the Roots, which fell in
among five young Walnut Trees, without in∣juring
a Twig or Bud of either of them, as
rais'd the admiration of such as saw it.</P>
<P>12. In the same place, the Top of another
Elm yet standing, was carry'd of from the
Body of the Tree, a good part of 20 Yards.</P>
<P><HI>SIR;</HI> I shall trouble you no further at pre∣sent,
you may perhaps think this enough, and
too much; but however that may be, you, or
your ingenious Undertakers are left at liberty
to publish so much, or so little of this Narra∣tive,

<P>Publick notice being given of a designed

Power and Majesty, which as one Prophet

Ends of the Earth, and bringeth the Wind out of
his Treasures, and as the Priest saith, hath so
done his marvellous Works, that they ought to be
had in remembrance.</HI> As to these Villages of
<HI>Littleton</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> I can only give this
Information, that this violent Hurricane visi∣ted
us also in its passage, to the great Terror
of the Inhabitants, who although by the gra∣cious
Providence of God all escaped with their
Lives and Limbs, and the main Fabrick of
their Houses stood; tho' with much shaking,
and some damage in the Roots of many of
them: Yet when the Morning Light appea∣red
after that dismal Night, they were sur∣pris'd
with fresh apprehensions of the Dangers
escaped, when they discover'd the sad Havock
that was made among the Trees of their Or∣chards
and Closes, very many Fruit Trees,
and many mighty Elms being torn up, and
one Elm above the rest, of very great Bulk and
ancient Growth I observed, which might have
defied the Strength of all the Men and Teams
in the Parish, (tho' assaulted in every Branch
with Roaps and Chains) was found torn up
by the Roots, all sound, and of vast Strength
and Thickness, and with its fall (as was
<PB N="120" REF="134"/>
thought) by the help of the same impetuous
Gusts, broke off in the middle of the Timber
another great Elm its Fellow, and next Neigh∣bour.
And that which may exercise the
Thoughts of the Curious, some little Houses
and Out-houses that seemed to stand in the
same Current, and without any visible Bur∣rough
or Shelter, escaped in their Roofs, with∣out
any, or very little Damage: What Acci∣dents
of Note hapned in our Neighbouring
Parishes, I suppose you may receive from o∣ther
Hands. This, (I thank God) is all that
I have to transmit unto you from this place,

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Find in the Advertisments a Desire to have
an Account of what happen'd remarkable
in the late terrible Storm in the Country; the
Stories every where are very many, and seve∣ral
of them such as will scarce gain Credit; one
of them I send here an Account of being an
Eye Witness, and living upon the place: The
Storm here began on the 26th of <HI>Novem.</HI> 1703.
about 12-a-clock, but the severest Blasts were
between 5 and six in the Morning, and between
Eight and Nine the 27th I went up to the
Church, where I found all the middle Isle
clearly stript of the Lead from one End to
the other, and a great many of the Sheets
lying on the East End upon the Church, roll'd
up like a piece of Cloth: I found on the
Ground six Sheets of Lead, at least 50 Hun∣dred
weight, all joyn'd together, not the least
parted, but as they lay upon the Isle, which
<PB N="122" REF="136"/>
six Sheets of Lead were so carried in the Air
by the Wind fifty Yards and a Foot, mea∣sured
by a Workman exactly as cou'd be,
from the place of the Isle where they lay, to
the place they fell; and they might have been
carried a great way further, had they not hap∣pen'd
in their way upon a Tree, struck off an
Arm of it near 17 Yards high; the End of one
Sheet was twisted round the Body of the Tree,
and the rest all joyn'd together lay at length,
having broke down the Pales first where the
Tree stood, and lay upon the Pales on the
Ground, with one End of them, as I said be∣fore,
round the Body of the Tree.</P>
<P>At the same time at <HI>Marson,</HI> in the County

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours, and in Answer these are
to acquaint you; That we about us came
no ways behind the rest of our Neighbours
in that mighty Storm or Hurricane. As for
our own Parish, very few Houses or Outhou∣ses
escaped. There was in the Parish of <HI>Fare∣ham</HI>
six Barns blown down, with divers other
Outhouses, and many Trees blown up by the
Roots, and other broken off in the middle; by
the fall of a large Elm, a very large Stone
Window at the West End of our Church was
broken down; there was but two Stacks of
Chimneys thrown down in all our Parish that
I know of, and those without hurting any Per∣son.
There was in a <HI>Coppice</HI> called <HI>Pupal Cop∣pice,</HI>
an Oak Tree, of about a Load of Tim∣ber,
that was twisted off with the Wind, and
the Body that was left standing down to the
very Roots so shivered, that if it were cut in∣to
Lengths, it would fall all in pieces. Not∣withstanding
so many Trees, and so much Out∣Housing
was blown down, I do not hear of
one Beast that was killed or hurt. There was
on the <HI>Down</HI> called <HI>Portsdown,</HI> in the Parish of
<HI>Southwick,</HI> within three Miles of us, a Wind-Mill
was blown down, that had not been up
<PB N="124" REF="138"/>
very many Years, with great damages in the
said Parish to Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> by the fall of many
Chimneys and Trees. The damage sustained

to make use of Slit Deals to supply the
want of Slats and Tyles until Summer come

that it cannot be all repaired till after a∣nother
Harvest. As for Sea Affairs about us,
we had but one Vessel abroad at that time,

<P>OUR Church, tho' a very large one,
suffered no great discernable Damage.
<PB N="130" REF="144"/>
The Lead Roof, by the force of the Wind was
strangely ruffled, but was laid down without
any great cost or trouble. Two well-grown
Elms, that stood before a sort of Alms-house
in the Church-yard had a different Treatment;
the one was broken sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt in the Trunck, and
the head turn'd Southward; the other tore up
by the Roots, and cast Northward: Divers
Chimnies were blown down, to the great Da∣mage
and Consternation of the Inhabitants:
And one rising in the middle of two Cham∣bers
fell so violently, that it broke thro' the
Roof and Cieling of the Chamber, and fell by
the Bed of Mr. <HI>W. M.</HI> and bruised some part
of the Bed-teaster and Furniture; but himself,
Wife and Child were signally preserved: An
Out-house of Mr. <HI>F. M.</HI> (containing a Stable,
Mill-house, and a sort of Barn, judged about
40 Foot in length) standing at the end of our
Town, and much expos'd to the Wind, intire∣ly
fell, which was the most considerable Da∣mage:
Not one of our Town was killd, or
notably hurt; tho' scarce any but were terri∣bly
alarm'd by the dreadful Violence of it,
which remitted about five in the Morning:
The beautiful Cathedral Church of <HI>Glocester</HI>
suffer'd much; but of that I suppose you will
have an account from some proper Hand: This
I was willing to signifie to you, in answer to

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Perceive by an Advertisement in the <HI>Ga∣zette</HI>
of last <HI>Monday,</HI> that a Relation of
some considerable Things which happened in
the late Tempest is intended to be printed,
which design I believe will be well approved
of, that the Memory of it may be perpetua∣ted.
I will give you an Account of some of
the observable Damages done in this Parish:
The Church which was Til'd is so shattered,
that the Body of it is entirely to be ripp'd.
Two Barns, and a Stable have been blown
down; in the latter were 13 Horses, and
none of them hurt, tho' there was but one to
be seen when the Men first came. I have
number'd about 20 large Trees blown down,
which stood in the regular Walks in the Park
here. It is said, that all the Trees blown
down in both the Parks will make above an
hundred Stacks of Wood. A Summer-house
<PB N="132" REF="146"/>
which stood on the East-side of the Bowling-green
at <HI>Hatfield</HI>-House, was blown against
the Wall, and broken, and a large part of it
carried over the Wall, beyond a Cartway in∣to
the plowed Grounds. A great part of the
South-wall belonging to one of the Gardens
was levelled with the Ground; tho' it was so
strong, that great part of it continues cemen∣ted,
tho' it fell upon a Gravel-walk. Several
Things which happened, incline me to think
that there was something of an <HI>Hurricane.</HI>
Part of the fine painted Glass-window in my
Lord <HI>Salisbury's</HI> Chapel was broken, tho' it
looked towards the East. The North-side of
an House was untiled several Yards square.
In some places the Lead has been raised up,
and over one Portal quite blown off. In
<HI>Brocket-hall</HI> Park belonging to Sir <HI>John Reade,</HI>
so many Trees are blown down, that lying as
they do, they can scarce be numbred, but by
a moderate Computation, they are said to a∣mount
to above a Thousand. The Damages
which this Parish hath sustained, undoubtedly
amount to many hundred Pounds, some of
the most considerable I have mentioned to
you, of which I have been in great Measure
an Eye-witness, and have had the rest from
Credible Persons, especially the matter of
<HI>Brocket-hall</HI> Park. it being two Miles out of
Town, tho' in this Parish. I am,

The shorter Accounts which have been sent up
from almost all parts of <HI>England,</HI> especially to the
South of the <HI>Trent;</HI> tho' we do not transmit them
at large as the abovesaid Letters are, shall be
faithfully abridg'd for the readier comprising them
within the due compass of our Volume.</P>
<P>From <HI>Kent</HI> we have many strange Accounts of
the Violence of the Storm, besides what relate to
the Sea Affairs.</P>
<P>At <HI>Whitstable,</HI> a small Village on the Mouth
of the East Swale of the River <HI>Medway,</HI> we are
inform'd a Boat belonging to a Hoy was taken up by
the Violence of the Wind, clear off from the Water,
and being bourn up in the Air, blew turning conti∣nually
over and over in its progressive Motion, till
it lodg'd against a rising Ground, above 50 Rod
from the Water; in the passage it struck a Man,
who was in the way, and broke his Knee to pieces.</P>
<P>We content our selves with relating only the
Fact, and giving Assurances of the Truth of what
we Relate, we leave the needful Remarks on such
Things to another place.</P>
<P>At a Town near <HI>Chartham,</HI> the Lead of the
Church rolled up together, and blown off from the
Church above 20 Rod distance, and being taken
up afterwards, and weigh'd it, appear'd to weigh
above 2600 weight.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Ccording to your request, and my pro∣mise,
for the service of the publick, I
have here given you an Account of the Effects
of the late Tempestuous Winds in the Parish
of <HI>Brenchly,</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> as freely
and impartially as can be consistent with the
Damages sustained thereby, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>A stately Steeple, whose Altitude ex∣ceeded
almost, if not all, in <HI>Kent,</HI> the height
whereof, according to various Computa∣tions,
it never in my knowledge being exactly
measured, did amount at least to 10 Rods,
some say 12, and others more; yet this strong
and noble Structure by the Rage of the Winds
was levelled with the Ground, and made the
sport and pastime of Boys and Girls, who to
future Ages, tho' perhaps incredibly, yet can
boast they leaped over such a Steeple, the fall
thereof beardown great part of the Churchand
Porch, the damage of which to repair, as before,
will not amount to less than 800 or 1000 <HI>l.</HI>
This is the publick loss; neither does private
and particular much less bemoan their Con∣dition,
for some Houses, and some Barns,
<PB N="135" REF="149"/>
with other Buildings, are quite demolished;
tho' Blessed be God, not many Lives or Limbs
lost in the fall, and not one House, but what
suffered greatly by the Tempest. Neither were
Neighbouring Parishes much more favoured;
but especially, a place called <HI>Great Peckham,</HI>
whose Steeple also, almost as high as ours,
was then blown down, but not so much Da∣mage
to the Church, which God preserve safe
and sound for ever.</P>
<CLOSER>This is the nearest account that can
be given, by your unknown Ser∣vant,
<SIGNED>Tho. Figg.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>As the above Letter mentions the fall of the
Spire of <HI>Great Peckham,</HI> we have omitted a
particular Letter from the place.</P>
<P>In or near <HI>Hawkhurst</HI> in Sussex, a Waggon
standing in a Field loaden with Straw, and bound
well down in order to be fetch't away the next day,
the Wind took the Waggon, drove it backward
several Rods, force't it through a very thick Hedge
into the Road, and the way being dirty, drove it
with that force into the Mud or Clay of the
Road, that six Horses could not pull it out.</P>
<P>The Collector of these Accounts cannot but en∣ter
the Remarks be made, having occasion to
Traverse the Country of <HI>Kent</HI> about a Month after
<PB N="136" REF="150"/>
the Storm; and besides, the general Desolation
which in every Village gave almost the same pro∣spect;
he declares, that he reckoned 1107 dwel∣ling
Houses, Out-houses and Barns blown quite
down, whole Orchards of Fruit Trees laid flat upon
the Ground, and of all other sorts of Trees such a
quantity, that tho' he attempted to take an Ac∣count
of them, he found' twas impossible, and was
oblig'd to give it over.</P>
<P>From <HI>Monmouth</HI> we have a Letter, that a∣mong
a vast variety of Ruins, in their own
Houses and Barns; one whereof fell with a quan∣tity
of Sheep in it, of which seven were kill'd:
The Lead of the great Church, tho' on the side
from the Wind, was roli'd up like a roll of Cloth,
and blown off from the Church.</P>
<P>I chose to note this, because the Letter says,
it was upon the Norrh-side of the Church, and
which seems to confirm what I have observ'd be∣fore,
of the Eddies of the Wind, the Operation
whereof has been very strange in several Places,
and more Violent than the Storm it self.</P>
<P>At <HI>Wallingford,</HI> one <HI>Robert Dowell,</HI> and his
Wife, being both in Bed, the Chimmey of the
House fell in, demolish'd the House, and the
main Beam breaking fell upon the Bed, the Wo∣man
receiv'd but little Damage, but the Man
had his Thigh broke by the Beam, and lay in a
dangerous Condition when the Letter was wrote,
which was the 18th of <HI>January</HI> after.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE best account I can give of the
Storm in these Parts is as follows: Dr.
<HI>Towgood</HI> had his Court Gate, with a piece of
Wall blown to the other side of the Road, and
stands upright against the Hedge, which was 12
Foot over, and it was as big as two Horses
could draw: A sheet of Lead which lay flat
was carried from Sir <HI>William Drake</HI>'s quite o∣ver
a Wall into the Minister's Court, near three∣score
Yards: There was a Tree which stood
in Mr. <HI>John Whitty</HI>'s Ground which broke in
the middle, and the top of it blew over the
Hedge, and over a Wall, and over a top of a
House, and did not hurt the House: There was
a Mow of Corn that was blown off the Posts,
and sate upright without hurt, belonging to
<HI>William Oliver,</HI> at an Estate of <HI>Edward Seymour</HI>'s,
called <HI>Chappel Craft:</HI> A Maiden Oke which
stood in the <HI>Quille</HI> more than a Man could fa∣thom,
was broke in the middle: Several hun∣dred
of Apple-Trees, and other Trees blown
down: Most Houses damnify'd in the Tilth
and Thatch, but no Houses blown down, and no
Person hurt nor killed; neither did the Church
nor Tower, nor the Trees in the Church-yard
received much Damage: Our loss in the
Apple-Trees is the greatest; because we shall

want Liquor to make our Hearts merry; the
Farmer's sate them up again, but the Wind
has blown them down since the Storm.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to your request, I have made it
my business to get the exactest and tru∣est
account (I am able) of the damages and
losses sustain'd on this side the Country, by
the late Violent Storm. The Cathedral
Church of <HI>Ely</HI> by the Providence of God did, con∣trary
to all Men's expectations, stand out the
shock; but suffered very much in every part
of it, especially that which is called the Body
of it, the Lead being torn and rent up a con∣siderable
way together; about 40 lights of
Glass blown down, and shatter'd to pieces,
one Ornamental Pinacle belonging to the North
Ifle demolish'd, and the Lead in divers other
parts of it blown up into great heaps. Five
Chimneys falling down in a place called the
Colledge, the place where the Predendaries
<PB N="142" REF="156"/>
Lodgings are, did no other damage (prais'd
be God) then beat down some part of the
Houses along with them; the loss which the
Church and College of <HI>Ely</HI> sustain'd, being
by computation near 2000 <HI>l.</HI> The Sufferers
are the Reverend the Dean and Chapter of the
said Cathedral. The Wind Mills belonging
both to the Town and Country, felt a worse
fate, being blown or burnt down by the Vio∣lence
of the Wind, or else disabled to that de∣gree,
that they were wholy unable of answer∣ing
the design they were made for; three of
the aforesaid Mills belonging to one <HI>Jeremiah
Fouldsham</HI> of <HI>Ely,</HI> a very Industrious Man of
mean Substance, were burnt and blown down,
to the almost Ruin and Impoverishment of the
aforesaid Person, his particular loss being up∣ward
of a 100 <HI>l.</HI> these are the most remarka∣ble
disasters that befel this side of the Country.
The Inhabitants both of the Town of <HI>Ely</HI> and
Country general, receiv'd some small damages
more or less in their Estates and Substance,
<HI>viz.</HI> The Houses being stript of the Tiling,
Barns and Out-houses laid even with the
Ground, and several Stacks of Corn and Cocks
of Hay being likewise much damaged, the
general loss being about 20000 <HI>l.</HI> the escape of
all Persons here from Death, being generally
miraculous; none as we can hear of being
kill'd, tho' some were in more imminent
danger than others. This, Sir, is as true, and

he found he had left it at his Dwelling House,
and therefore returned thither to fetch it, and
coming back again to the Mill, found it blown
quite down, and by his lucky forgetfulness
saved his Life, which otherwise he most inevi∣tably
had lost. Several Stacks of Corn and
Hay were blown down and shattered a very

<P>I Cannot pretend to give you a particular
Account concerning the great Wind, but
here are a great many Houses blown down,
many Barns, and abundance of Trees. A
little Park three Miles from <HI>Basing Stoke,</HI>
belonging to Es{que} <HI>Waleps</HI> has a great quantity
<PB N="148" REF="162"/>
of Timber blown down, there is 800 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s worth
of Oak sold, and 800<HI>l</HI>'s worth of other Trees
to be sold, and so proportionably all over the
Country. Abundance of Houses until'd, and
a great many Chimneys blown down; but I
do not hear of any body kill'd about us. Most
of the People were in great Fears and Con∣sternation;
insomuch, that they thought the
World had been at an end. Sir,</P>

<HEAD>The following Letter from a small Town near Hel∣ford
in Cornwall is very Autheutick, and may
be depended on.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to your Request, in a lare Ad∣vertisement,
in which you desir'd an
Impartial Account of what Accidents hap∣ned
by the late Dreadful Storm, in order to
make a true and just Collection of the same,
please to take the following Relation, <HI>viz.</HI>
Between 8 and 9-a-Clock the Storm began,
with the Wind at N. W. about 10-a-Clock it
<PB N="149" REF="163"/>
veer'd about from W. to S. W. and back to
West again, and between 11 and 12-a-Clock
it blew in a most violent and dreadful manner,
that the Country hereabouts thought the great
day of Judgment was coming.</P>
<P>It continued thus blowing till 5-a-Clock, and
then began to abate a little, but has done a
Prodigious damage to almost all forts of
People, for either their Houses are blown down,
or their Corn blown out of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tack-yards,
(some Furlongs distance) from the same<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that the very Fields look in a manner, as if
they had shak'd the Sheaves of Corn over
them. Several Barns blown down, and the
Corn that was in the same carried clear a∣way.</P>
<P>The Churches here abouts have suffered
very much, the Roofs of several are torn in
pieces, and blown a considerable Distance
off.</P>
<P>The small Quantity of Fruit-Trees we had
in the Neighbourhood about us are so di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣member'd,
and torn in pieces, that few or none
are left fit for bearing Fruit.</P>
<P>The large Timber Trees, as Elm, Oak,
and the like, are generally blown down, ospe∣cially
the largest and highest Trees suffered
most; for few Gentlemen that had T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s a∣bout
their Houses have any left; and it is
generally observ'd here, that the Trees and
Houses that stood in Valleys, and most out of
the Wind, have suffered most. In short, the
<PB N="150" REF="164"/>
Damage has been so general, that both Rich
and Poor have suffered much.</P>
<P>In <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lford,</HI> a small Haven, not far from
hence, there was a Tin Ship blown from her
Anchors with only one Man, and two Boys on
Board, without Anchor, Cable or Boat, and
was forc'd out of the said Haven about 12-a∣Clock
at Night; the next Morning by 8-a∣Clock,
the Ship miracuiously Run in between
two Rocks in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sle of Weight,</HI> where the
Men and Goods were saved, but the Ship lost:
Such a Run, in so short a time, is almost Incre∣dible,
it being near 80 Leagues in 8 hours time,
I belive it to be very true, for the Master of the
said Ship I know very well, and some that were
concern'd in her Lading, which was Tin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Thus far our Letters.</HEAD>
<P>“IT has been impossible to give an exact
relation in the matter of publick Damage,
either as to the particulars of what is remar∣keable,
or an Estimate of the general loss.”</P>
<P>“The Abstract here given, as near as we
could order it, is so well taken, that we have,
<HI>generally speaking,</HI> something remarkable from
every quarter of the Kingdom, to the South
of the <HI>Trent.</HI>”</P>
<P>“It has been observ'd, that tho' it blew a
great Storm farther Northward, yet nothing
<PB N="151" REF="165"/>
so furious as this way. At <HI>Hull,</HI> indeed,
as the Relation Expresses, it was violent,
but even that violence was moderate, com∣par'd
to the Stupendious fury with which
all the Southern part of the Nation was At∣tack'd.”</P>
<P>“When the Reader finds an Account here
from <HI>Milford-haven</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> and from <HI>Hel∣ford</HI>
in <HI>Cornwall</HI> West, from <HI>Yarmouth</HI> and
<HI>Deal</HI> in the East, from <HI>Portsmouth</HI> in the
South, and <HI>Hull</HI> in the North, I am not to
imagine him so weak as to suppose all the
vast Interval had not the same, or propor∣tion'd
suffering, when you find one Letter
from a Town, and two from a County, it
is not to be supposed that was the whole
damage in that County, but, on the contra∣ry,
that every Town in the County suffered
the same thing in proportion; and it would
have been endless to the Collector, and tire∣som
to the Reader, to have Enumerated all
the Individuals of every County; 'twould be
endless to tell the Desolation in the
Parks, Groves, and fine Walks of the Gen∣try,
the general havock in the Orchards and
Gardens among the Fruit Trees, especially
in the Countries of <HI>Devon, Somerset, Here∣ford,
Gloucester</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI> where the ma∣king
great quantities of Cyder and Perry,
is the reason of numerous and large Orch∣ards,
among which, for several Miles toge∣ther,
there would be very few Trees left.”</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="166"/>
“In <HI>Kent</HI> the Editor of this Book has seen
several great Orchards, the Trees lying flat
on the Ground, and perhaps one Tree stand∣ing
in a place by it self, as a House might
shelter it, perhaps none at all.”</P>
<P>“So many Trees were every where blown
cross the Road, that till the People were
cal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to saw them off, and remove them, the
ways were not passable.”</P>
<P>“Stacks of Corn and Hay were in all places
either blown down, or so torn, that they re∣ceiv'd
great damage, and in this Article 'tis
very observable, those which were only blown
down receiv'd the least Injury; when the main
body of a Stack of Hay stood safe, the top
being loosen'd by the Violence of the Wind,
the Hay was driven up into the Air, and
flew about like Feathers, that it was entirely
lost, and hung about in the Neighbouring
Trees, and spread on the Ground for a great
distance and so perfectly seperated, that there
was no gathering it together.”</P>
<P>“Barly and Oats suffered the same casualty,
only that the weight of the Corn settled it
sooner to the Ground than the Hay.”</P>
<P>“As to the Stacks of Wheat, the Accounts
are very strange; from many places we have
Letters, and some so incredible, that we dare
not venture on the Readers faith to transmit
them, least they should shock their belief in
those very strange Relations already set down,
and better Attested, as of a great Stack of
<PB N="153" REF="167"/>
Corn taken from the Hovel on which it stood,
and without Dislocating the Sheaves, set up∣on
another Hovel, from whence the Wind
had just before remoy'd another Stack of
equal Dimensions; of a Stack of Wheat ta∣ken
up with the Wind, and set down whole
16 Rod off, and the like. But as we have
other Relations equally strange, their Truth
considered, we refer the Reader to them, and
assure the World we have several Accounts
of Stacks of Wheat taken clear off from the
Frame or Steddal, and set down whole,
abundance more over-set, and thrown off
from their standings, and others quite dis∣pers'd,
and in a great measure destroy'd.”</P>
<P>“'Tis true, Corn was exceeding cheap all
the Winter after, but they who bring that as
a reason to prove there was no great quan∣tity
destroy'd, are oblig'd to bear with me
in telling them they are mistaken, for the
true reason was as follows,”</P>
<P>“The Stacks of Corn in some Countries,
the West chiefly, where the People general∣ly
lay up their Corn in Stacks, being so
damnisy'd as above, and the Barns in all parts
being Universally uncovered, and a vast num∣ber
of them overturn'd, and blown down,
the Country People were under a necessity
of Threshing out their Corn with all possible
speed, least if a Rain had follow'd, as at that
time of Year was not unlikely, it might ha'
been all spoil'd.”</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="168"/>
“And it was a special Providence to those
People also, as well as to us in <HI>London;</HI> that
it did not Rain, at least to any quantity, for
near three Weeks after the Storm.”</P>
<P>“Besides this, the Country People were obli∣ged
to thresh out their Corn for the sake of
the Straw, which they wanted to repair the
Thatch, and covering of their Barns, in order
to secure the rest.”</P>
<P>“All these Circumstances forc'd the Corn to
Market in unusual quantities, and that by
Consequence made it Cheaper than ordina∣ry,
and not the exceeding quantity then in
Store.”</P>
<P>“The Seats of the Gentlemen in all places
had an extraordinary share in the Damage;
their Parks were in many places persectly
dismantled, the Trees before their Doors
levelled, their Garden Walls blown down, and
I could give a List, I believe, of a thousand
Seats in <HI>England,</HI> within the compass of
our Collected Papers, who had from 5 to
20 Stacks of Chimnies blown down, some
more, some less, according to the several Di∣mentions
of the Houses.”</P>
<P>“I am not obliging the Reader to comply
with the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>culations here following, and it
would have took up too much room in this
small Tract to name particulars; but accord∣ing
to the best estimate I have been able to
make from the general Accounts sent up by
Persons forward to have this matter recorded,
<PB N="155" REF="169"/>
the following particulars are rather under
thanover the real Truth.”</P>
<Q>25 Parks in the several Countries, who
have above 1000 Trees in each
Park, blown down.</Q>
<P>“<HI>New Forest</HI> in <HI>Hampshire</HI> above 4000, and
some of prodigious Bigness; above 450
Parks and Groves, who have from 200 large
Trees to 1000 blown down in them.”</P>
<P>“Above 100 Chuches covered with Lead,
the Lead roll'd up, the Churches uncover'd;
and on some of them, the Lead in Prodigi∣ous
Quantities blown to incredible Distances
from the Church.”</P>
<P>“Above 400 Wind-mils overset, and bro∣ken
to pieces; or the Sails so blown round,
that the Timbers and Wheels have heat and
set the rest on Fire, and so burnt them down,
as particularly several were in the Isle
of <HI>Ely.</HI>”</P>
<P>“Seven Steeples quite blown down, be∣sides
abundance of Pinacles and Battle∣ments
from those which stood; and the
Churches where it happened most of them
Demolish'd, or terribly Shattered.”</P>
<P>“Above 800 dwelling Houses blown down,
in most of which the Inhabitants received
some Bruise or Wounds, and many lost their
Lives.”</P>
<P>“We have reckoned, including the City of
<HI>London,</HI> about 123 People kill'd; besides
such as we have had no account of; the Num∣ber
<PB N="156" REF="170"/>
of People drowned are not easily Guest;
but by all the Calculations I have made and
seen made, we are within compass, if we
reckon 8000 Men lost, including what were
lost on the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> what in Ships
blown away, and never heard of, and what
were drowned in the Flood of the <HI>Severn,</HI>
and in the River of <HI>Thames.</HI>”</P>
<P>“What the Loss, how many poor Families
ruin'd, is not to be Estimated, the Fire of
<HI>London</HI> was an exceeding Loss, and was by
some reckon'd at four Millions sterling;
which, tho' it was a great Loss, and hap∣pened
upon the spot, where vast Quantities of
Goods being expos'd to the fury of the
Flames, were destroy'd in a hurry, and 14000
dwelling Houses entirely consum'd.”</P>
<P>“Yet on the other Hand, that Desola∣tion
was consin'd to a small Space, the
loss fell on the wealthiest part of the People;
but this loss is Universal, and its extent ge∣neral,
not a House, nor a Family that had any
thing to lose, but have lost something by this
Storm, the Sea, the Land, the Houses, the
Churches, the Corn, the Trees, the Rivers,
all have felt the fury of the Winds.”</P>
<P>“I cannot therefore think I speak too large,
if I say, I am of the Opinion, that the Da∣mage
done by this Tempest far exceeded the
Fire of <HI>London.</HI>”</P>
<P>“They tell us the Damages done by the
Tide, on the Banks of the <HI>Severn,</HI> amounts
<PB N="157" REF="171"/>
to above 200000 pounds, 15000 Sheep
drown'd in one Level, Multitudes of Cattle
on all the sides, and the covering the Lands
with Salt Water is a Damage cannot well be
Estimated: The High Tide at <HI>Bristol</HI> spoil'd
or damnisy'd 1500 Hogsheds of Sugars and
Tobaccoes, besides great quantities of other
Goods.”</P>
<P>“'Tis impossible to describe the general Ca∣lamity,
and the most we can do is, to lead
our Reader to supply by his Immagination
what we omit; and to believe, that as the
Head of the particulars is thus collected, an
infinite Variety at the same time happened in
every place, which cannot be expected to be
found in this Relation.”</P>
<P>“There are some additional Remarks to be
made as to this Tempests, which I cannot
think improper to come in here: As,”</P>
<P>1. “That in some Parts of <HI>England</HI> it was
join'd with terrible Lightnings and Flashings
of Fire, and in other Places none at all, as
to Thunder the Noise the Wind made, was
so Terrible, and so Unusual, that I will not
say, People might not mistake it for Thun∣der;
but I have not met with any, who
will be positive that they heard it Thunder.”</P>
<P>2. “Others, as in many Letters we have
received to that purpose insist upon it, that
they felt an Earthquake; and this I am
doubtful of for several Reasons.”</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="172"/>
1st. “We find few People either in City
or Country ventur'd our of their Houses, or at
least till they were forced out, and I can∣not
find any Voucher to this opinion of an
Earthquake, from those whose Feet stood
upon the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> felt it move, and will
affirm it to be so.”</P>
<P>2d, “As to all those People who were in
Houses, I cannot allow them to be competent
Judges, for as no House was so strong as not
to move and shake with the force of the Wind,
so it must be impossible for them to distin∣guish
whither that motion came from a∣bove
or below: As to those in Ships, they will
not pretend to be competent Judges in this
case, and I think the People within doors as
improper to decide, for what might not that
motion they felt in their Houses, from the
Wind do, that an Earthquake could do. We
found it rockt the strongest Buildings, and in
several places made the Bells in the Steeples
strike, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loosen'd the Foundations of the
Houses, and in some blew them quite down,
but still if it had been an Earthquake, it must
have been felt in every house, and every
place; and whereas in those Streets of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
where the Houses stand thick and well
Built, they could not be so shaken with the
Wind as in opener places; yet there the other
would have equally been felt, and better
distinguisht; and this particularly by the
Watch, who stood on the Ground, under
<PB N="159" REF="173"/>
shelter of publick Buildings, as in St. <HI>Paul's</HI>
Church, the Exchange Gates, the Gates of
the City, and such like; wherefore, as I
am not for handing to Posterity any matter
of Fact upon ill Evidence, so I cannot trans∣mit
what has its Foundation only in the
Amazements of the People.”</P>
<P>“'Tis true, that there was an Earthquake
felt in the <HI>North East parts of the Kingdoms,</HI>
about a Month afterwards, of which seve∣ral
Letters here inserted make mention, and
one very particularly from <HI>Hull;</HI> but that
there was any such thing as an Earthquake
during the Storm, I cannot agree.”</P>
<P>“Another remarkable thing I have observ'd,
and have several Letters to show of the Wa∣ter
which fell in the Storm, being brackish,
and at <HI>Cranbrook</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> which is at least
16 Miles from the Sea, and above 25 from
any Part of the Sea to windward, from
whence the Wind could bring any moisture,
<HI>for it could not be supposs'd to fly against the
Wind;</HI> the Grass was so salt, the Cattel
would not eat for several Days, from whence
the ignorant People suggested another Mira∣cle,
<HI>viz.</HI> that it rain'd salt Water.”</P>
<P>The answer to this, I leave to two Letters
printed in the <HI>Philosophical Transactions; as

account from a Clergy-man, an Intelligent

Storm made great desolations there abouts, but
also an odd Phoenomenon occasioned by it, <HI>viz.</HI>
“That a Physician travelling soon after the
Storm to <HI>Tisehyrst,</HI> about 20 Miles from <HI>Lewes,</HI>
and as far from the Sea, as he rode he pluckt
some tops of Hedges, and chawing them
found them Salt. Some Ladies of <HI>Lewes</HI>
hearing this, tasted some Grapes that were
still on the Vines, and they also had the
same relish. The Grass on the Downs in
his Parish was so salt, that the Sheep in the
Morning would not seed till hunger com∣pelled
them, and afterwards drank like
Fishes, as the Shepherds report. This he
attributeth to Saline Particles driven from

<HEAD>V. Part of a Letter from Mr. Anthony van
Lauwenhoek, F. R. S. giving his observa∣tions
on the late Storm.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Delft, <DATE>Jan. 8. 1704.</DATE> N. S.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Affirmed in my Letter of the 3d of <HI>No∣vember</HI>
last past, that Water may be so
dash'd and beaten against the Banks and Dikes
by a strong Wind, and divided into such
small Particles, as to be carried far up into
the Land.</P>
<P>Upon the 8th of <HI>December,</HI> 1703. N. S. We
had a dreadful Storm from the South West,
insomuch, that the Water mingled with small
parts of Chalk and Stone, was so dasht against
the Glass-windows, that many of them were
darkned there with, and the lower Windows
of my House, which are made of very fine
Glass, and always kept well scower'd, and
were not open'd till 8-a-Clock that Morning,
notwithstanding that they look to the North.
East, and consequently stood from the Wind;
and more over, were guarded from the Rain
by a kind of Shelf or Pent-house over them;
were yet so cover'd with the Particles of the
Water which the Whirl-wind cast against
them, that in less than half an hour they were
deprived of most of their transparency, and,
foral much as these Particles of Water were
not quite exhaled, I concluded that it must
<PB N="162" REF="176"/>
be Sea-water, which the said Storm had not
only dasht against our Windows, but spread
also over the whole Country.</P>
<P>That I might be satisfied herein, I blow'd
two small Glasses, such as I thought most
proper to make my Observations with, con∣cerning
the Particles of Water that adhered to
my Windows.</P>
<P>Pressing these Glasses gently against my
Windows, that were covered with the suppos'd
Particles of Sea-water, my Glasses were tin∣ged
with a few of the said Particles.</P>
<P>These Glasses, with the Water I had thus
collected on them, I placed at about half a
Foot distance from the Candle, I view'd them
by my Microscope, reck'ning, that by the
warmth of the Candle, and my Face together,
the Particles of the said Water would be put
into such a motion, that they would exhale
for the most part, and the Salts that were in
'em would be expos'd naked to the sight, and
so it happened; for in a little time a great ma∣ny
Salt Particles did, as it were, come out of
the Water, having the Figure of our common
Salt, but very small, because the Water was
little, from whence those small Particles pro∣ceeded;
and where the Water had lain very
thin upon the Glass, there were indeed a
great number of Salt Particles, but so exceed∣ing
sine, that they almost escaped the Sight
through a very good Microscope.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="177"/>
From whence I concluded, that these Glass∣windows
could not be brought to their former
Lustre, but by washing them with a great deal
of Water; for if the Air were very clear, and
the Weather dry, the watry Particles would
soon exhale, but the Salts would cleave fast to
the Glass, which said Salts would be again
dissolv'd in moist Weather, and sit like a Dew
or Mist upon the Windows.</P>
<P>And accordingly my People found it when
they came to wash the afore-mentioned lower
Windows of my House; but as to the upper
Windows, where the Rain had beat against
them, there was little or no Salt to be found
sticking upon that Glass.</P>
<P>Now, if we consider, what a quantity of
Sea-water is spread all over the Country by
such a terrible Storm, and consequently, how
greatly impregnated the Air is with the same;
we ought not to wonder, that such a quanti∣ty
of Water, being moved with so great a
force, should do so much mischief to Chim∣neys,
tops of Houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not to mention the
Damages at Sea.</P>
<P>During the said Storm, and about 8-a-Clock
in the Morning, I cast my Eye upon my Ba∣rometer,
and observ'd, that I had never seen
the Quick-silver so low; but half an hour af∣ter
the Quick-silver began to rise, tho' the
Storm was not at all abated, at least to any
appearance; from whence I concluded, and
said it to those that were about me, that the
<PB N="164" REF="178"/>
Storm would not last long; and so it hap∣pened.</P>
<P>There are some that affirm, that the scat∣tering
of this Salt-water by the Storm will do
a great deal of harm to the Fruits of the
Earth; but for my part I am of a quite diffe∣rent
Opinion, for I believe that a little Salt
spread over the surface of the Earth, especial∣ly
where it is heavy Clay-ground, does ren∣der
it exceeding Fruitful; and so it would be,
if the Sand out of the Sea were made use of to
the same purpose.</P>
<P>“These Letters are too well, and too judi∣ciously
Written to need any comment of
mine; 'tis plain, the watry Particles taken up
from the Sprye of the Sea into the Air, might
by the impetuosity of the Winds be carried
a great way, and if it had been much far∣ther,
it would have been no Miracle in my
account; and this is the reason, why I have
not related these Things, among the extraor∣dinary
Articles of the Storm.”</P>
<P>“That the Air was full of Meoters, and
fiery Vapours, and that the extraordinary
Motion occasion'd the firing more of them
than usual, a small stock of Philosophy will
make very rational; and of these we have
various Accounts, more in some places tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in others, and I am apt to believe these were
<PB N="165" REF="179"/>
the Lighntings we have been told of; for I am
of Opinion, that there was really no Light∣ning,
such as we call so in the common Ac∣ceptation
of it; for the Clouds that flew with
so much Violence through the Air, were not,
as to my Observation, such as usually are
fraighted with Thunder and Lightning, the
Hurries nature was then in, do not consist
with the System of Thunder, which is Air
pent in between the Clouds; and as for the
Clouds that were seen here flying in the Air,
they were by the fury of the Winds so sepera∣ted,
and in such small Bodies, that there was
on room for a Collection suitable, and necessa∣ry
to the Case we speak of.”</P>
<P>“These Cautions I thought necessary to set
down here, for the satisfaction of the Curi∣ous;
and as they are only my Opinions, I
submit them to the judgment of the Rea∣der.”</P>

<HEAD>Of the Damages on the Water.</HEAD>
<P>“AS this might consist of several Parts, I
was inclin'd to have divided it into
Sections or Chapters, relating particularly to
the publick Loss, and the private; to the
Merchant, or the Navy, to Floods by the
Tides, to the River Damage, and that
<PB N="166" REF="180"/>
of the Sea; but for brevity, I shall confine
it to the following particulars.”</P>
<Q><L><HI>“First,</HI> The Damage to Trade.</L>
<L><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Damage to the Royal Navy.</L>
<L><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Damage by High Tides.</L>
<L><HI>First,</HI> Of the Damage to Trade.”</L></Q>
<P>“I might call it a Damage to Trade, that
this Season was both for some time before
and after the Tempest, so exceeding, and so
continually Stormy, that the Seas were
in a manner Unnavigable and Negoce,
at a kind of a general Stop, and when the
Storm was over, and the VVeather began
to be tolerable; almost all the Shipping in
<HI>England</HI> was more or less out of Repair, for
there was very little Shipping in the Nation,
but what had receiv'd some Damage or
other.”</P>
<P>“It is impossible, but a Nation so full of
Shipping as this, must be exceeding Suffer∣ers
in such a general Disaster, and who ever
considers the Violence of this Storm by its
other dreadful Effects will rather wonder,
and be thankful that we receiv'd no farther
Damage, than we shall be able to give an
Account of by Sea.”</P>
<P>“I have already observ'd what Fleets were
in the several Ports of this Nation, and from
whence they came: As to Ships lost of
<PB N="167" REF="181"/>
whom we have no other Account than that
they were never heard of. I am not able to
give any Perticulars, other than that a∣bout
three and forty Sail of all Sorts are
reckon'd to have perished in that manner. I
mean of such Ships as were at Sea, when
the Storm began, and had no Shelter or Port to
make for their Safety: Of these, some were
of the <HI>Russia</HI> Fleet, of whom we had an Ac∣count
of 20 Sail lost the Week before the
great Storm, but most of them reach'd the
Ports of <HI>Newcastle, Humber</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI>
and some of the Men suffered in the general
Distress afterwards.”</P>
<P>“But to proceed to the most general Disa∣sters,
by the same Method, as in the former
Articles of Damages by Land. Several Per∣sons
having given themselves the Trouble to
further this Design with Authentick Parti∣culars
from the respective Ports. I con∣ceive
we cannot give the World a clearer
and more Satisfactory Relation than from
their own Words.”</P>

The Account is as follows,</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>REading the Advertisement in the <HI>Gazette,</HI>
of your intending to Print the many
sad Accidents in the late dreadful Storm, in∣duced
me to let you know what this place felt,
tho a very good Harbour. Her Majesty's
Ships the <HI>Cumberland, Coventry, Loo, Hastings</HI>
and <HI>Hec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or,</HI> being under my Command, with the
<HI>Rye</HI> a Cruizer on this Station, and under our
Convoy about 130 Merchant Ships bound a∣bout
Land; the 26th of <HI>November</HI> at one in
the Afternoon the Wind came at S. by E. a
hard Gale, between which and N. W. by W. it
came to a dreadful Storm, at three the next
Morning was the Violentest of the Weather,
when the <HI>Cumberland</HI> broak her Sheet Anchor,
the Ship driving near <HI>this,</HI> and the <HI>Rye,</HI> both
narrowly escap'd carrying away; she drove
very near the Rocks, having but one Anchor
left, but in a little time they slung a Gun,
with the broken Anchor fast to it, which they
let go, and wonderfully preserv'd the Ship
from the Shoar. Guns firing from one Ship or
other all the Night for help, tho' 'twas impossi∣ble
to assist each other, the Sea was so high, and
the Darkness of the Night such, that we could
not see where any one was, but by the Flashes
of the Guns; when day light appear'd, it was a
<PB N="169" REF="183"/>
dismal sight to behold the Ships driving up and
down one foul of another, without Masts,
some sunk, and others upon the Rocks, the
Wind blowing so hard, with Thunder, Light∣ning
and Rain, that on the Deck a Man could
not stand without holding. Some drove from
<HI>Dale,</HI> where they were shelter'd under the
Land, and split in pieces, the Men all drown∣ed;
two others drove out of a Creek, one on
the Shoar so high up was saved, the other on
the Rocks in another Creek, and Bulg'd; an
<HI>Irish</HI> Ship that lay with a Rock thro' her, was
lifted by the Sea clear away to the other side
of the Creek on a safe place; one Ship forc'd
10 Miles up the River before she could be
stop'd, and several strangely blown into holes,
and on Banks; a Ketch of <HI>Pembroke</HI> was drove
on the Rocks, the two Men and a Boy in her
had no Boat to save their Lives; but
in this great distress a Boat which broke from
another Ship drove by them, without any in
her, the two Men leap into her, and were sav'd,
but the Boy drown'd; a Prize at <HI>Pembroke</HI>
was lifted on the Bridge, whereon is a Mill,
which the Water blew up, but the Vessel got
off again; another Vessel carried almost into
the Gateway which leads to the Bridge, and
is a Road, the Tide flowing several Foot above
its common Course. The Storm continu'd till
the 27th about 3 in the Afternoon; that by
Computation nigh 30 Merchant Ships and
Vessels without Masts are lost, and what Men are
<PB N="170" REF="184"/>
lost is not known; 3 Ships are missing, that we
suppose Men and all lost. None of her Majesty's
Ships came to any harm; but the <HI>Cumberland</HI>
breaking her Anchor in a Storm which hap∣pen'd
the 18th at Night, lost another, which
renders her uncacapable of proceeding with us
till supply'd. I saw several Trees and Houses
which are blown down.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPon the Evening of <HI>Friday, Nov.</HI> 26.
1703. the Wind was very high; but
about midnight it broke out with a more than
wonted Violence, and so continued till near
break of day. It ended a N. W. Wind, tho'
about 3 in the Morning it was at S. W. The
loudest cracks I observed of it, were somewhat
before 4 of the Clock; we had here the com∣mon
Calamity of Houses shatter'd and Trees
thrown down.</P>
<P>But the Wind throwing the Tyde very
strongly into the <HI>Severn,</HI> and so into the <HI>Wye,</HI>
on which <HI>Chepstow</HI> is scituated. And the Fresh
in <HI>Wye</HI> meeting with a Rampant Tyde, over∣flowed
<PB N="171" REF="185"/>
the lower part of our Town. It came
into several Houses about 4 foot high, rather
more; the greatest damage sustained in Houses,
was by the makers of Salt, perhaps their loss
might amount to near 200 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>But the Bridge was a strange sight; it stands
partly in <HI>Monmouthshire,</HI> and partly in <HI>Glou∣cestershire,</HI>
and is built mostly of Wood, with
a Stone Peer in the midst, the Center of which
divides the two Counties; there are also Stone
Platforms in the bottom of the River to bear
the Wood-work. I doubt not but those Stone
Platforms were covered then by the great Fresh
that came down the River. But over these
there are Wooden Standards fram'd into Peers
42 Foot high; besides Groundsils, Cap-heads,
Sleepers, Planks, and (on each side of the
Bridge) Rails which may make about 6 foot
more, the Tyde came over them all: The
length of the Wooden part of the Bridge in
<HI>Monmouthshire</HI> is 60 yards exactly, and there∣about
in <HI>Gloucestershire;</HI> the <HI>Gloucestershire</HI> side
suffered but little, but in <HI>Monmouthshire</HI> side
the Planks were most of them carried away,
the Sleepers (about a Tun by measure each)
were many of them carried away, and seve∣ral
removed, and 'tis not doubted but the
great Wooden Peers would have gone too;
but it was so, that the outward Sleepers on
each side the Bridge were Pinn'd or Bolted to
the Cap heads, and so kept them in their
places.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="186"/>
All the level Land on the South part of <HI>Mon∣mouthshire,</HI>
called the <HI>Moors,</HI> was overflow'd;
it is a tract of Land about 20 miles long,
all Level, save 2 little points of High-land, or
3; the Breadth of it is not all of one size, the
broadest part is about 2 miles and 1/2. This
Tyde came 5 Tydes before the top of the
Spring, according to the usual run, which sur∣prized
the People very much. Many of their
Cattle got to shore, and some dy'd after they
were landed. It is thought by a <HI>Moderate
Computation,</HI> they might lose in Hay and Cat∣tle
between 3 and 4000 <HI>l.</HI> I cannot hear of any
Person drowned, save only one Servant Man, that
ventur'd in quest of his Master's Cattle. The
People were carried off, some by Boats, some
otherways, the days following; the last that
came off (that I can hear of) were on <HI>Tuesday</HI> E∣vening,
to be sure they were uneasy and asto∣nished
in that Interval. There are various reports
about the height of this Tyde in the <HI>Moors,</HI>
comparing it with that in <HI>Jan.</HI> 1606. But
the account that seems likeliest to me, is, that
the former Tyde ran somewhat higher than this.
'Tis thought most of their Land will be worth
but little these 2 or 3 years, and 'tis known,
that the repairing the Sea Walls will be very
chargeable.</P>
<P><HI>Gloucestershire</HI> too, that borders upon <HI>Se∣verne</HI>
hath suffered deeply on the Forrest
of <HI>Deane</HI> side, but nothing in comparison of
the other shore, from about <HI>Harlingham</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="187"/>
down to the mouth of <HI>Bristol</HI> River <HI>Avon,</HI>
particularly from <HI>Aust Cliffe</HI> to the Rivers
Mouth (about 8 miles) all that Flat, called
the <HI>Marsh</HI> was drowned. They lost many
Sheep and Cattle. About 70 Seamen were
drown'd out of the <HI>Canterbury</HI> Storeship, and
other Ships that were Stranded or Wreck'd.
The <HI>Arundel</HI> Man of War, <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Can∣terbury</HI>
Storeships, a <HI>French</HI> Prize, and a <HI>Dane,</HI>
were driven ashore and damnified; but the <HI>A∣rundel</HI>
and the <HI>Danish</HI> Ship are got off, the rest
remain on Ground. The <HI>Richard and John</HI> of
about 500 Tun, newly come into <HI>King-road</HI>
from <HI>Virginia,</HI> was Staved. The <HI>Shoram</HI> rode
it out in <HI>King-road;</HI> but I suppose you may
have a perfecter account of these things from
<HI>Bristol.</HI> But one thing yet is to be remem∣bred,
one <HI>Nelms</HI> of that Country, as I hear
his Name, was carried away with his Wife
and 4 Children, and House and all, and were
all lost, save only one Girl, who caught hold
of a Bough, and was preserved.</P>
<P>There was another unfortunate Accident
yet in these parts, one Mr. <HI>Churchman,</HI> that
keeps the Inns at <HI>Betesley,</HI> a pas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age over the
<HI>Severn,</HI> and had a share in the passing Boars,
seeing a single Man tossed in a Wood-buss off
in the River, prevailed with some belonging
to the Customs, to carry himself and one of
his Sons, and 12 Servants aboard the Boat,
which they did, and the Officers desired Mr.
<HI>Churchman</HI> to take out the Man, and come
<PB N="174" REF="188"/>
ashore with them in their Pinnace. But he,
willing to save the Boat as well as the Man,
tarried aboard, and sometime after hoisting
Sail, the Boat overset, and they were all
drowned, <HI>viz.</HI> the Man in the Boat, Mr.
<HI>Churchman,</HI> his Son and 2 Servants, and much
lamented, especially Mr. <HI>Churchman,</HI> and his

<P>OBserving your desire (lately signify'd
in the <HI>Gazette</HI>) to be further inform'd
concerning the Effects of the late dreadful
Tempest, in order to make a Collection there∣of.
I have prefum'd to present you with the
following particulars concerning <HI>Bristol,</HI> and
the parts near Adjacent, being an Eye-witness
of the same, or the Majority of it. On <HI>Sa∣turday</HI>
the 27th of <HI>Novemb.</HI> last, between the
hours of one and two in the Morning, arose
a most prodigious Storm of Wind, which con∣tinued
with very little intermission for the space
of 6 hours, in which time it very much shat∣tered
the Buildings, both publick and private,
by uncovering the Houses, throwing down
the Chimneys, breaking the Glass Windows,
overthrowing the Pinnacles and Battle∣ments
of the Churches, and blowing off the
<PB N="176" REF="190"/>
Leads: The Churches in particular felt the
fury of the Storm. St. <HI>Stephen's</HI> Tower had
three Pinnacles blown off, which beat down
the greatest part of the Church. The Cathe∣dral
is likewise very much defac'd, two of its
Windows, and several Battlements being blown
away; and, indeed, most Churches in the City
felt its force more or less; it also blew down
abundance of great Trees in the Marsh, <HI>Col∣lege-Green,</HI>
St. <HI>James</HI>'s Church-yard, and other
places in the City. And in the Country it
blew down and scattered abundance of Hay
and Corn Mows, besides almost Levelling ma∣ny
Orchards and Groves of stout Trees. But
the greatest damage done to the City was, the
violent over-flowing of the Tide, occasion'd
by the force of the Wind, which flowed an
extraordinary height, and did abundance of
damage to the Merchants Cellers. It broke
in with great fury over the Marsh Country,
forcing down the Banks or Sea Walls, drown∣ing
abundance of Sheep, and other Cattle,
washing some houses clear away, and break∣ing
down part of others, in which many Per∣sons
lost their Lives. It likewise drove most
of the Ships in <HI>Kingroad</HI> a considerable way
upon the Land, some being much shatter'd,
and one large Vessel broke all in pieces, and
near all the Men lost, besides several lost out
of other Vessels. To conclude, the Damage
sustein'd by this City alone in Merchandise,
Houses, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> is Computed to an Hundred
<PB N="177" REF="191"/>
Thousand Pounds, besides the great Loss in
the Country, of Cattel, Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which has
utterly ruined many Farmers, whose substance
consisted in their Stock aforesaid. So having
given you the most material Circumstances,
and fatal Effects of this great Tempest in these

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Parish of <HI>Huntspill</HI> hath receiv'd
great Damage by the late Inundation
of the Salt Water, particularly the West part
thereof suffered most: For on the 27th Day
of <HI>November</HI> last, about four of the Clock in
the Morning, a mighty Southwest Wind blew
so strong, as (in a little time) strangely
tore our Sea Walls; insomuch, that a conside∣rable
part of the said Walls were laid smooth,
after which the Sea coming in with great
Violence, drove in five Vessels belonging to
<HI>Bridgewater Key</HI> out of the Channel, upon a
<PB N="178" REF="192"/>
Whar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in our Parish, which lay some distance
off from the Channel, and there they were all
grounded; it is said, that the Seamen there fa∣thom'd
the depth, and found it about nine Foot,
which is taken notice to be four Foot above
our Walls when standing; the Salt Water soon
overflow'd all the West end of the Parish, for∣cing
many of the Inhabitants from their Dwel∣lings,
and to shift for their Lives: The Wa∣ter
threw down several Houses, and in one
an antient Woman was drown'd, being about
fourscore Years old: Some Families shelter'd
themselves in the Church, and there staid till
the Waters were abated: Three Window
Leaves of the Tower were blown down, and
the Ruff-cast scal'd off in many places: Much
of the Lead of the Church was damnify'd;
the Windows of the Church and Chancel
much broken, and the Chancel a great part
of it untiled: The Parsonage House, Barn
and Walls received great Damage; as also,
did some of the Neighbours in their Houses:
At the West end of the Parsonage House stood
a very large Elm, which was four Yards a
quarter and half a quarter in the Circumfer∣ence,
it was broken off near the Ground by
the Wind, without forcing any one of the
Moars above the Surface, but remain'd as
they were before: The Inhabitants (many of
them) have receiv'd great Losses in their
Sheep, and their other Cattle; in their Corn
and Hay there is great spoil made. This is
<PB N="179" REF="193"/>

this Parish hath sustain'd by the late dreadful
Tempest.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours, and in answer to it these
are to acquaint you, that all the Ships in
our Harbour except two (which were 23 or
24 in Number, besides Fishing Boats) were,
through the Violence of the Storm, and the
mooring Posts giving way, drove from their
Anchors, one of them was stav'd to pieces, nine
drove Ashoar; but 'tis hoped will be all got off
again, though some of them are very much
damnified: Several of the Fishing Boats like∣wife,
with their Nets, and other Necessaries
were destroy'd. Three Seamen were drown∣ed
in the Storm, and one Man was squeez'd
to Death last <HI>Wednesday,</HI> by one of the Ships
that was for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d Ashoa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, suddenly com∣ing
<PB N="180" REF="194"/>
upon him, as they were digging round
her, endeavouring to get her off.</P>
<P>Our Peer also was somewhat damaged, and
'tis thought, if the Storm had continued till
another Tide, it would have been quite wash∣ed
away, even level to the Ground; which
it so, would infallibly have ruined our Har∣bour:
Our Church likewise was almost all
untiled, the neighbouring Churches also re∣ceived
much Damage: The Houses of our
Town, and all the Country round about,
were most of them damaged; some (as I am
credibly informed) blown down, and several
in a great Measure uncovered: Trees also of
a very great Bigness were broken off in the
middle, and vast Numbers blown down; one
Gentleman, as he told me himself, having 2500
Trees blown down: I wish you good Success
in these your Undertakings, and I pray God
that this late great Calamity which was sent
upon us as a punishment for our Sins, may
be a warning to the whole Nation in general,
and engage every one of us to a hearty and
sincere Repentance; otherwise, I'm afraid we
must expect greater Evils than this was to
fall upon us.</P>

<P>I Receiv'd yours and accordingly have made
an enquiry in our Neighbourhood what
damage might be done in the late Storm, thro
Mercy we escap'd indifferently, but you will
find underwritten as much as I can learn to
be certainly true.</P>
<P>The Storm began here about 12 at Night,
but the most violent part of it was about 4
the next Morning, about which time the
greatest part of the Houses in the Town
were uncovered more or less, and one House
clearly blown down; the damage sustain'd to
the Houses is modestly computed at 200 <HI>l.</HI>
the South Is<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the Church was wholly un∣covered,
and considerable damage done to the
other Isles, and 4 large Stones weighing about
One Hundred and Fifty or Two Hundred
Pound each, was blown down from the end of
the Church, three of the four Iron Spears, that
stood with Vanes on the corners of the Tower,
were broke short off in the middle, and the
Vanes not to be found, and the Tail of the
Weather Cock, which stood in the middle of
the Tower was blown off, and found in a
Court near 400 yards distant from the Tower.
In <HI>Cline</HI> Wood belonging to the Duke of
<HI>Beaufort</HI> near this Town, there is about 100
large Trees blown down; as also in a Wood
<PB N="182" REF="196"/>
on our River belonging to Mr. <HI>Thomas Mansell</HI>
of <HI>Brittonferry</HI> about 80 large Oakes. The
Tydes did not much damage, but two
Ships were blown off our Bar, and by Provi∣dence
one came aground on the Salt House
point near our Harbour, else the Ship and Men
had perished; the other came on shore, but

<P>YOu desire to know what effect the late
dreadful Storm of Wind had upon this
Town; in answer to your desire, take the fol∣lowing
Account. This Town consists of at least
600 Houses, besides two great Churches, some
Publick Buildings, and many Shops standing
upon the Beach near the Sea, and yet by the
special Blessing and Providence of God, the
whole Town suffered not above 30 or 40 <HI>l.</HI>
damage in their Houses, Churches, Publick
Building and Shops, and neither Man, Wo∣man
or Child suffered the least hurt by
the said Terrible Storm. The Town stands
upon the Sea shore, but God be thanked
the Sea did us no damage; and the Tydes
were not so great as we have seen upon far
less Storms. The Wind was exceeding Boiste∣rous,
which might drive the Froth and Sea
moisture six or seven miles up the Country,
for at that distances from the Sea, the Leaves
of the Trees and Bushes, were as Salt as if
<PB N="186" REF="200"/>
they had been dipped in the Sea, which can be
imputed to nothing else, but the Violent
Winds carrying the Frofth and Moisture so
far. I believe it may be esteemed almost Mi∣raculous
that our Town escaped so well in
the late terrible Storm, and therefore I have
given you this Account. I am</P>

<P>THese Lines I hope in God will find you
in good Health, we are all left here in
a dismal Condition, expecting every moment
to be all drowned: For here is a great Storm,
and is very likely to continue; we have here
the Rear Admiral of the Blew in the Ship,
call'd the <HI>Mary,</HI> a third Rate, the very next
Ship to ours, sunk, with Admiral <HI>Beau∣mont,</HI>
and above 500 Men drowned: The
Ship call'd the <HI>Northumberland,</HI> a third Rate,
about 500 Men all sunk and drowned: The
Ship call'd the <HI>Sterling Castle,</HI> a third Rate,
all sunk and drowned above 500 Souls: And
the Ship call'd the <HI>Restoration,</HI> a third Rate,
all sunk and drowned: These Ships were all
close by us which I saw; these Ships fired
their Guns all Night and Day long, poor
Souls, for help, but the Storm being so fierce
and raging, could have none to save them:
The Ship call'd the <HI>Shrewsberry</HI> that we are in,
broke two Anchors, and did run mighty
fierce backwards, within 60 or 80 Yards of
the Sands, and as God Almighty would have
it, we flung our sheet Anchor down, which is
the biggest, and so stopt: Here we all pray'd
to God to forgive us our Sins, and to save us,
or else to receive us into his Heavenly King∣dom.
If our sheet Anchor had given way, we
had been all drown'd: But I humbly thank
<PB N="195" REF="209"/>
God, it was his gracious Mercy that saved
us. There's one Captain <HI>Fanel</HI>'s Ship, three
Hospital Ships, all split, some sunk, and most

Account, but of these four Men of War afore∣said,

out of <HI>Helford Haven</HI> to the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI>
in less than eight hours, <HI>viz.</HI> The Ship lay

Tin, which was taken on Board from <HI>Guague</HI>
Wharf, about five or six miles up <HI>Helford</HI>
River, the Commanders name was <HI>Anthony

Clock in the Evening before the Storm begun
the said Commander and Mate came on Board
<PB N="197" REF="211"/>
and ordered the Crew that he left on Board,
which was but one Man and 2 Boys; that if
the Wind should chance to blow hard (which
he had some apprehension of) to carry out the
small Bower Anchor, and moor the Ship by
2 Anchors, and gave them some other orders,
and his Mate and he went ashoar, and left
the Crew aforesaid on Board; about nine a
Clock the VVind began to blow, then they
carried out the small Bower (as directed) it
continued blowing harder and harder at West
North West, at last the Ship began to drive,
then they were forced to let go the best Bow∣er
Anchor which brought the Ship up. The
Storm increasing more, they let go the Kedge
Anchor, which was all they had to let go,
so that the Ship rid with four Anchors a head:
Between eleven and twelve a Clock the Wind
came about VVest and by South in a most
Terrible and Violent manner, that notwith∣standing
a very high Hill just to VVindward
of the Ship, and four Anchors ahead, she
was drove from all her Anchors; and about
twelve a Clock drove out of the Harbour with∣out
Anchor or Cable, nor so much as a Boat
left in case they could put into any Harbour.
In dreadful condition the Ship drove out clear
of the Rocks to Sea, where the Man with
the two Boys consulted what to do, at last
resolved to keep her far enough to Sea, for
fear of <HI>Deadman</HI>'s <HI>Head,</HI> being a point of Land
<PB N="198" REF="212"/>
between <HI>Falmonth</HI> and <HI>Plimouth,</HI> the latter of
which places they designed to run her in, if
possible, to save their Lives; the next morn∣ing
in this frighted condition they steer'd her
clear of the Land (to the best of their skill)
sometimes almost under VVater, and some∣times
a top, with only the bonet of her Fore∣sail
out, and the Fore yard almost lower'd to
the Deck; but instead of getting into <HI>Plymouth</HI>
next day as intended, they were far enough
off that Port, for the next morning they saw
Land, which proved to be <HI>Peverel</HI> Point, a lit∣tle
to the Westward of the <HI>Isle of Wight;</HI> so
that they were in a worse Consternation then
before, for over-running their designed Port by
seven a Clock, they found themselves off the
<HI>Isle of Wight;</HI> where they consulted again what
to do to save their Lives, one of the Boys was
for running her into the <HI>Downs,</HI> but that was
objected against, by reason they had no An∣chors
nor Boat, and the Storm blowing off
shore in the <HI>Downs,</HI> they should be blown on
the unfortunate <HI>Goodwin Sands</HI> and lost. Now
comes the last consultation for their lives,
there was one of the Boys said he had been in
a certain Creek in the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> were be∣tween
the Rocks he believed there was room
enough to run the Ship in and save their Lives
and desired to have the Helm from the Man,
and he would venture to steer the Ship into
the said place, which he according did, where
<PB N="199" REF="213"/>
there was only just room between Rock and
Rock for the Ship to come in, where she gave
one blow or two against the Rocks, and sunk
immediately, but the Man and two Boys
jumpt ashore, and all the Lading being Tin
was saved, (and for their Conduct and Risk
they run) they were all very well gratified,

“He found himself mov'd with Compassion
at the Distresses of the poor Creatures, whom
he saw as aforesaid in that miserable Condi∣tion
upon the Sands, and the first Thing he
did, he made Application to the Custom-House
Officers for the Assistance of their Boats and
Men, to save the Lives of as many as they
could come at, the Custom House Men rude∣ly
refus'd, either to send their Men, or to
part with their Boats.”</P>
<P>“Provoked with the unnatural Carriage of
the Custom House Officers, he calls the
People about him; and finding some of
the Common People began to be more than
ordinarily affected with the Distresses of
their Countrymen, and as he thought a lit∣tle
enclin'd to venture; he made a general
Offer to all that would venture out, that he
would pay them out of his own Pocket. 5 <HI>s.
per head</HI> for all the Men whose Lives they
could save, upon this Proposal several offer∣ed
themselves to go, if he would furnish 'em
with Boats.”</P>
<P>“Finding the main Point clear, and that he
had brought the Men to be willing, he with
their Assistance took away the Custom House
Boats by Force; and tho' he knew he could
not justify it, and might be brought into
Trouble for it, and particularly if it were
<PB N="202" REF="216"/>
lost, might be oblig'd to pay for it, yet he
resolv'd to venture that, rather than hazard the
loss of his Design, for the saving so many poor
Men's Lives, and having Mann'd their Boat
with a Crew of stout honest Fellows, he with
them took away several other Boats from o∣ther
Persons, who made use of them only to
Plunder and Rob, not regarding the Distres∣ses
of the poor Men.”</P>
<P>“Being thus provided both with Men and
Boats he sent them off, and by this means
brought on Shore above 200 Men, whose
Lives a few Minutes after, must infallibly
ha' been lost.”</P>
<P>“Nor was this the End of his Care, for
when the Tide came in, and 'twas too late to
go off again, for that all that were left were
swallow'd up with the Raging of the Sea, his
Care was then to relieve the poor Creatures,
who he had sav'd, and who almost dead
with Hunger and Cold, were naked and
starving.”</P>
<P>“And first he applied himself to the Queen's
Agent <HI>for Sick and Wounded Seamen,</HI> but
he would not relieve them with One Penny,
whereupon, at his own Charge, he furnish'd
them with Meat, Drink and Lodging.”</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="217"/>
“The next Day several of them died, the
Extremities they had suffer'd, having too
much Master'd their Spirits, these he was
forc'd to bury also at his own Charge, the A∣gent
still refusing to Disburse one Penny.”</P>
<P>“After their Refreshment the poor Men as∣sisted
by the Mayor, made a fresh Applicati∣on
to the Agent for Conduct Money to help
them up to <HI>London,</HI> but he answer'd he had
no Order, and would Disburse nothing,
whereupon the Mayor gave them all Mo∣ney
in their Pockets, and Passes to
<HI>Graves-End.</HI>”</P>
<P>“I wish I could say with the same Freedom,
that he receiv'd the Thanks of the Govern∣ment,
and Reimbursement of his Money as
he deserv'd, but in this I have been inform'd,
he met with great Obstructions and Delays,
tho' at last, after long Attendance, upon a
right Application I am inform'd he obtain'd
the repayment of his Money, and some
small Allowance for his Time spent in sollici∣ting
for it.”</P>
<P>“Nor can the Damage suffered in the River
of <HI>Thames</HI> be forgot. It was a strange sight to
see all the Ships in the River blown away,
the Pool was so clear, that, as I remember,
not above 4 Ships were left between the Up∣per
part of <HI>Wapping,</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff Cross,</HI> for
<PB N="204" REF="218"/>
the Tide being up at the Time when the
Storm blew with the greatest violence. No
Anchors or Landfast, no Cables or Moor∣ings
would hold them, the Chains which lay
cross the River for the mooring of Ships, all
gave way.”</P>
<P>“The Ships breaking loose thus, it must be
a strange sight to see the Hurry and Confusion
of it, and as some Ships had no Body at all
on Board, and a great many had none but a
Man or Boy left on Board just to look after
the Vessel, there was nothing to be done,
but to let every Vessel drive whither and
how she would.”</P>
<P>“Those who know the Reaches of the Ri∣ver,
and how they lye, know well enough,
that the Wind being at South West Wester∣ly,
the Vessels would naturally drive into the
Bite or Bay from <HI>Ratcliff Cross</HI> to <HI>Lime-house
Hole,</HI> for that the River winding about a∣gain
from thence towards the New Dock at
<HI>Deptford,</HI> runs almost due South West, so
that the Wind blew down one Reach, and up
another, and the Ships must of necessity
drive into the bottom of the Angle between
both.”</P>
<P>“This was the Case, and as the Place is not
large, and the Number of Ships very great,
the force of the Wind had driven them so in∣to
<PB N="205" REF="219"/>
one another, and laid them so upon one
another as it were in heaps, that I think a
Man may safely defy all the World to do
the like.”</P>
<P>“The Author of this Collection had the curi∣osity
the next day to view the place, and to ob∣serve
the posture they lay in, which neverthe∣less
'tis impossible to describe; there lay, by
the best Account he could take, few less than
700 sail of Ships, some very great ones be∣tween
<HI>Shadwel</HI> and <HI>Limehouse</HI> inclusive, the
posture is not to be imagined, but by them
that saw it, some Vessels lay heeling off with
the Bow of another Ship over her Waste,
and the Stem of another upon her Fore-Ca∣stle,
the Boltsprits of some drove into the
Cabbin Windows of others; some lay with
their Sterns tossed up so high, that the Tide
flowed into their Fore-Castles before they
cou'd come to Rights; some lay so leaning
upon others, that the undermost Vessels
wou'd sink before the other could float; the
numbers of Masts, Boltiprits and Yards split
and broke, the staving the Heads, and Sterns
and Carved Work, the tearing and destructi∣on
of Rigging, and the squeezing of Boats to
pieces between the Ships, is not to be reckon∣ed;
but there was hardly a Vessel to be
seen that had not suffer'd some damage or o∣ther
in one or all of these Articles.”</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="220"/>
“There was several Vessels sunk in this hurry,
but as they were generally light Ships, the
damage was chiefly to the Vessels; but there
were two Ships sunk with great quantity of
Goods on Board, the <HI>Russel</HI> Galley was sunk
at <HI>Lime-house,</HI> being a great part laden with
Bale Goods for the <HI>Streights,</HI> and the <HI>Sarah</HI>
Gally lading for <HI>Leghorn,</HI> sunk at an Anchor
at <HI>Blackwall;</HI> and though she was afterwards
weighed and brought on shore, yet her back
was broke, or so otherwise disabled, as she
was never fit for the Sea; there were several
Men drown'd in these last two Vessels, but
we could never come to have the particular
number.”</P>
<P>“Near <HI>Gravesend</HI> several Ships drove on shoar
below <HI>Tilbury</HI> Fort, and among them five
bound for the <HI>West Indies,</HI> but as the shoar
is ouzy and soft, the Vessels sat upright and
easy, and here the high Tides which follow'd,
and which were the ruin of so many in other
places, were the deliverance of all these Ships
whose lading and value was very great, for
the Tide rising to an unusual height, floated
them all off, and the damage was not so great
as was expected.”</P>
<P>“If it be expected I should give an account
of the loss, and the particulars relating to
small Craft, <HI>as the Sailors call it,</HI> in the River
<PB N="207" REF="221"/>
it is to look for what is impossible, other than
by generals.”</P>
<P>“The Watermen tell us of above 500 Wher∣ries
lost, most of which were not sunk only
but dasht to pieces one against another, or
against the Shores and Ships, where they
lay: Ship Boats without number were driven
about in every corner, sunk and staved, and
about 300 of them is supposed to be lost.
Above 60 Barges and Lighters were found
driven foul of the <HI>Bridge;</HI> some Printed ac∣counts
tell us of sixty more sunk or staved
between the <HI>Bridge</HI> and <HI>Hammersmith.</HI>”</P>
<P>“Abundance of Lighters and Barges drove
quite thro' the <HI>Bridge,</HI> and took their fate
below, where of many were lost, so that we
Reckon by a modest account above 100
Lighters and Barges lost and spoil'd in the
whole, not reckoning such as with small
damage were recovered.”</P>
<P>“In all this confusion it could not be, but
that many Lives were lost, but as the <HI>Thames</HI>
often times Buries those it drowns, there
has been no account taken. Two Water∣men
at <HI>Black Fryars</HI> were drowned, endea∣vouring
to save their Boat; and a Boat was
said to be Overset near <HI>Fulham,</HI> and five Peo∣ple
drown'd: According to the best account
I have seen, about 22 People were drown'd
<PB N="208" REF="222"/>
in the River upon this sad occasion, which
considering all circumstances is not a great
many, and the damage to Shipping computed
with the vast number of Ships then in the Ri∣ver,
the Violence of the Storm, and the
heighth of the Tide, confirms me in the Truth
of that Opinion, which I have heard ma∣ny
skilful Men own, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Ri∣ver
of <HI>Thames</HI> is the best Harbour of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI>”</P>
<P>“The highth of the Tide, as I have already
observ'd, did no great damage in the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> and I find none of the Levels of Marshes,
which lye on both sides the River overflowed
with it, it fill'd the Cellars indeed at <HI>Graves∣end,</HI>
and on both sides in <HI>London,</HI> and the
Alehouse-keepers suffered some loss as to
their Beer, but this damage is not worth
mentioning with what our Accounts give
us from the <HI>Severn;</HI> which, besides the par∣ticular
Letters we have already quoted, the
Reader may observe in the following, what
our general intelligenee furnishes us with.”</P>
<P>“The Damages in the City of <HI>Gloucester</HI> they
compute at 12000 <HI>l.</HI> above 15000 Sheep
drown'd in the Levels on the side of the
<HI>Severne,</HI> and the Sea Walls will cost, as these
Accounts tell us, 5000 <HI>l.</HI> to repair, all the
Country lyes under Water for 20 or 30
Miles together on both sides, and the Tide
<PB N="209" REF="223"/>
rose three Foot higher than the tops of the
Banks.”</P>
<P>“<HI>At Bristol</HI> they tell us, The Tide fill'd
their Cellars, spoil'd 1000 Hogsheads of Su∣gar,
1500 Hogsheds of Tobacco, and the
Damage they reckon at 100000 <HI>l.</HI> Above 80
People drown'd in the Marshes and River,
several whole Families perishing together.”</P>
<P>“The Harbour at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> the Castle at
at <HI>Pendennis,</HI> the Cathederal at <HI>Gloucester,</HI>
the great Church at <HI>Berkely,</HI> the Church of
St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s at <HI>Bristol;</HI> the Churches at
<HI>Blandford,</HI> at <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and
generally the Churches all over <HI>England</HI> have
had a great share of the Damage.”</P>
<P>“In <HI>King Road</HI> at <HI>Bristol,</HI> the Damage by
Sea is also very great; the <HI>Canterbury</HI> store
Ship was driven on Shoar, and twenty-five
of her Men drown'd, as by our account
of the Navy will more particularly appear,
the <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> the <HI>George,</HI> and the
<HI>Grace</HI> sunk, and the number of People lost is
variously reported.”</P>
<P>“These Accounts in the four last Para∣graphs
being abstracted from the publick
Prints, and what other Persons collect, I
desire the Reader will observe, are not par∣ticularly
<PB N="210" REF="224"/>
vouch'd, but as they are all true
in substance, they so far to be depended
upon, and if there is any mistake it relates
to Numbers, and quantity only.”</P>
<P>“From <HI>Yarmouth</HI> we expected terrible
News, nd every one was impatient till they
saw the Accounts from thence, for as there
was a very great Fleet there, both of lader
Colliers, <HI>Russia</HI> Men, and others, there was
nothing to be expected but a dreadful De∣struction
among them.”</P>
<P>“But it pleas'd God to order Things there
that the loss was not in Proportion like
what it was in other Places, not but that it
was very great too.”</P>
<P>“The <HI>Reserve</HI> Man of War was come i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but a day or two before, Convoy to the
great Fleet from <HI>Russia,</HI> and the Captain, Sur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>geon

went on Shoar with two Boats to refrest

Mortification to stand on Shoar, and see th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Ship sink before their Faces; she foundred a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout
11-a-Clock, and as the Sea went to

to them, so their own Boats being both o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Shoar, there was not one Man sav'd; on
<HI>Russia</HI> Ship driving from her Anchors, an
<PB N="211" REF="225"/>
running foul of a laden Collier sunk by his
side, but some of her Men were sav'd by
getting on Board the Collier; three or sour
small Vessels were driven out to Sea, and
never heard of more; as for the Colliers,
tho' most of them were driven from their
Anchors, yet going away to Sea, we have
not an account of many lost.”</P>
<P>“This next to the Providence of God, I give
this reason for, first by all Relations it ap∣pears
that the Storm was not so violent far∣ther
Northward, as it was there; and as it
was not so Violent, so neither did it conti∣nue
so long: Now those Ships, who found
they could not ride it out in <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roads,
but slipping their Cables went away to Sea,
possibly as they went away to the Northward,
found the Weather more moderate at least, not
so violent, but it might be borne with, to this
may be added, that 'tis well known to such
as use the Coast after they had run the
length of <HI>Flambro,</HI> they had the benefit of the
Weather Shoar, and pretty high land, which
if they took shelter under might help them
very much; these, with other Circumstances,
made the Damage much less than every Bo∣dy
expected, and yet as it was<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it was bad
enough as our Letter from <HI>Hull</HI> gives an
Account. At <HI>Grimsby</HI> it was still worse as
to the Ships, where almost all the Vessels
<PB N="212" REF="226"/>
were blown out of the Road, and a great
many lost.”</P>
<P>“At <HI>Plymouth</HI> they felt a full Proportion of
the Storm in its utmost fury, the <HI>Edystone</HI> has
been mention'd already, but it was a dou∣ble
loss in that, the light House had not
been long down, when the <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> a
homeward bound <HI>Virginia</HI> Man was split
upon the Rock, where that Building stood,
and most of her Men drowned.”</P>
<P>“Three other Merchant Ships were cast a∣way
in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Road, and most of their
Men lost: The <HI>Monk</HI> Man of War rod it
out, but was oblig'd to cut all her Masts by
the Board, as several Men of War did in o∣ther
places.”</P>
<P>“At <HI>Porsmouth</HI> was a great Fleet, as has
been noted already, several of the Ships
were blown quite out to Sea, whereof some
were never heard of more; the <HI>Newcastle</HI>
was heard off upon the Coast of <HI>Sussex,</HI>
where she was lost with all their Men but
23; the <HI>Resolution,</HI> the <HI>Eagle</HI> advice Boat,
and the <HI>Litchfield</HI> Prize felt the same fate,
only sav'd their Men: From <HI>Cows</HI> several
Ships were driven out to Sea, whereof one
run on Shoar in <HI>Stokes-bay,</HI> one full of Sol∣diers,
and two Merchant Men have never
<PB N="213" REF="227"/>
been heard off, as I could ever learn, abun∣bance
of the Ships sav'd themselves by cut∣ting
down their Masts, and other Stranded,
but by the help of the ensuing Tides got off
again.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Portsmouth, Plymouth, Weymouth,</HI> and most
of our Sea Port Towns look'd as if they
had been Bombarded, and the Damage of
them is not easily computed.”</P>
<P>“Several Ships from the <HI>Downs</HI> were driven
oyer to the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> and some sav'd
themselves there; but several others were
lost there.”</P>
<P>“At <HI>Falmouth</HI> 11 Sail of Ships were stran∣ded
on the Shoar, but most of them got off
again.”</P>
<P>“In <HI>Barstable</HI> Harbour, a Merchant Ship
outward bound was over-set, and the ex∣press
advice Boat very much shatter'd, and the
Key of the Town almost destroy'd.”</P>
<P>“'Tis endless to attempt any farther De∣scription
of Losses, no place was free either
by Land or by Sea, every thing that was ca∣pable
felt the fury of the Storm; and 'tis
hard to say, whether was greater the loss by
Sea, or by Land; the Multitude of brave
<PB N="214" REF="228"/>
stout Sailors is a melancholy subject, and if
there be any difference gives the sad Bal∣lance
to the Account of the Damage by Sea.”</P>
<P>“We had an Account of about 11 or 12
Ships droven over for the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI>
most of which were lost, but the Men saved,
so that by the best Casculation I can make,
we have not lost less than 150 sail of Ves∣sels
of all sorts by the Storm; the number
of Men and other damages, are Calculated
elsewhere.”</P>
<P>“We have several Branches of this Story
which at first were too easily credited, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd
put in Print, but upon more strict examina∣on,
and by the discoveries of Time, ap∣pear'd
otherwise, and therefore are not set down.”</P>
<P>“It was in the design to have Collected the
several Accounts of the fatal effects of the
Tempest abroad in Foreign Parts; but as
our Accounts came in from thence too im∣perfect
to be depended upon; the Collector
of these Papers could not be satisfied to offer
them to the World, being willing to keep
as much as possible to the Terms of his Pre∣face.”</P>

“We are told there is an Abstract to the same

<P>“If a particular of this can be obtained, the
Author Promises to put it into <HI>English,</HI> and
adding to them the other Accounts, which
the rest of the World can afford, together
with some other Additions of the <HI>English</HI> Af∣fairs,
which could not be obtain'd in time
here shall make up the second part of this
Work.”</P>
<P>“In the mean time the Reader may observe,
<HI>France</HI> felt the general shock the Peers, and
Ricebank at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> the Harbour at <HI>Haver
de Grace,</HI> the Towns of <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Bulloign</HI>
give us strange Accounts.”</P>
<P>“All the Vessels in the Road before <HI>Dun∣kirk,</HI>
being 23 or 27, I am not certain, were
dasht in pieces against the Peer Heads, not
one excepted, that side being a Lee shoar,
the reason is plain, there was no going off to
Sea; and had it it been so with us in the
<HI>Downs</HI> or <HI>Yarmonth</HI> Roads, it would have
fared with us in the same manner, for had
there been no going off to Sea, 300 sail in
<HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road had inevitably perisht.”</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="230"/>
At <HI>Diepe</HI> the like mischief happened, and
“in proportion <HI>Paris</HI> felt the effects of it, as
bad as <HI>Loudon,</HI> and as a Gentleman who came
from thence since that time, affirmed it to
me it was much worse.”</P>
<P>“All the N. East Countries felt it, in <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
our accounts in general are very dismal,
but the Wind not being N. W. as at former
Storms, the Tyde did not drown them, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
beat so directly upon their Sea Wall.”</P>
<P>“It is not very irrational to Judge, that had
the Storm beat more to the North West, it
must have d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en the Sea upon them in such
a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that all their Dikes and Dams
could not have sustained it, and what the
consequence of such an Inundation might ha'
been they can best judge, who remember the
last terrible Irruption of the Sea there, which
drowned several thousand People, and Cattle
without number.”</P>
<P>“But as our Foreign Accounts were not sa∣tisfactory
enough to put into this Collection,
where we have promised to limit our selves
by just Vouchers, we purposely refer it all
to a farther description as before.”</P>
<P>“Several of our Ships were driven over to
those parts, and some lost there, and the
story of our great Ships which rid it out, at
<PB N="217" REF="231"/>
or near the <HI>Gunfleet,</HI> should have come in
here, if the Collector could have met with any
person that was in any of the said Vessels,

in the time for the Impression, they were of
necessity left out.”</P>

<P>HER Majesty's Ship <HI>Association,</HI> a se∣cond
Rate of 96 Guns, commanded
by Sir <HI>Stafford Fairborne,</HI> Vice-Admiral of the
Red, and under him Captain <HI>Richard Canning,</HI>
sailed from the <HI>Downs</HI> the 24th of <HI>November</HI>
last, in Company with seven other Capital
Ships, under the Command of the Honou∣rable
Sir <HI>Cloudesley Shovel,</HI> Admiral of the
White, in their return from <HI>Leghorn</HI> up the
River. They anchored that Night off of the
<HI>Long-sand-head.</HI> The next Day struck Yards
and Top-Masts. The 27th about three in
the Morning, the Wind at West South West,
encreased to a Hurricane, which drove the <HI>As∣sociation</HI>
from her Anchors. The Night was
exceeding dark, but what was more Dreadful,
the <HI>Galloper,</HI> a very dangerous Sand, was un∣der
her Lee; so that she was in Danger of
striking upon it, beyond the Power of Man
to avoid it. Driving thus at the Mercy of
the Waves, it pleased God, that about five a
Clock she passed over the tail of the <HI>Galloper</HI>
in seven Fathom of Water. The Sea boiste∣rous
and angry, all in a Foam, was ready to
<PB N="219" REF="233"/>
swallow her up; and the Ship received at that
time a Sea on her Starboard-side, which beat
over all, broke and washed several half Ports,
and forced in the entering Port. She took in
such a vast quantity of Water, that it kept
her down upon her side, and every Body be∣liev'd,
that she could not have risen again,
had not the Water been speedily let down into
the hold by scuttling the Decks. During this
Consternation two of the Lower-Gun-Deck-Ports
were pressed open by this mighty weight
of Water, the most hazardous Accident, next
to touching the Ground, that could have hap∣pened
to us. But the Port, that had been
forced open, being readily secured by the Di∣rection
and Command of the Vice-Admiral,
who, though much indisposed, was upon
Deck all that time, prevented any farther
Mischief. As the Ship still drove with the
Wind, she was not long in this Shoal, (where
it was impossible for any Ship to have lived
at that time) but came into deeper Water,
and then she had a smoother Sea. However
the Hurricane did not abate, but rather seem∣ed
to gather Strength. For Words were no
sooner uttered, but they were carried away
by the Wind, so that although those upon
Deck spoke loud and close to one another, yet
they could not often distinguish what was
said; and when they opened their Mouths,
their Breath was almost taken away. Part

of the Sprit Sail, tho' fast furled, was blown
away from the Yard. A Ten-Oar-Boat, that
was lashed on her Starboard-side, was often
hove up by the Strength of the Wind, and o∣ver-set
upon her Gun-Wale. We plainly saw
the Wind skimming up the Water, as if it had
been Sand, carrying it up into the Air, which
was then so thick and gloomy, that Day light,
which should have been comfortable to us,
did, but make it appear more ghastly. The
Sun by intervals peeped through the corner of
a Cloud, but soon disappearing, gave us a
more melancholick Prospect of the Weather.
About 11 a Clock it dispersed the Clouds,
and the Hurricane abated into a more mode∣rate
Storm, which drove us over to the Bank
of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and thence along the Coast of
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Friesland</HI> to the entrance of the
Elb, where the 4th of <HI>December</HI> we had almost
as violent a Storm, as when we drove from
our Anchors, the Wind at North West, dri∣ving
us directly upon the Shoar. So that
We must all have inevitably perished, had not
God mercifully favoured us about 10 a Clock
at night with a South West Wind, which gave
us an opportunity to put to Sea. But being
afterwards driven near the Coast of <HI>Norway,</HI>
the Ship wanting Anchors and Cables, our
Wood and Candles wholly expended; no Beer
on Board, nor any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hing else in lieu; every

the Men, who had been harrassed at <HI>Belle Isle,</HI>
and in our <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Voyage, now jaded
by the continual Fatigues of the Storms, fall∣ing
sick every Day, the Vice-Admiral in this
exigency thought it advisable to put into <HI>Got∣tenbourgh,</HI>
the only Port where we could hope
to be supplied. We arrived there the 11th of
<HI>December,</HI> and having witout lost of time
got Anchors and Cables from <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and
Provisions from <HI>Gottenbourgh,</HI> we sailed thence
the Third of <HI>January,</HI> with twelve Merchant
Men under our Convoy, all loaden with
Stores for her Majesty's Navy. The Eleventh
following we prevented four <HI>French</HI> Privateers
from taking four of our Store-Ships. At
Night we anchored off the <HI>Long-Sand-Head.</HI>
Weighed again the next Day, but soon came
to an Anchor, because it was very hazy Wea∣ther.
Here we rid against a violent Storm,
which was like to have put us to Sea. But af∣ter
three Days very bad Weather, we weigh∣ed
and arrived to the <HI>Buoy of the Nore</HI> the 23d
of <HI>January,</HI> having run very great Risks a∣mong
the Sands. For we had not only con∣trary
Winds, but also very tempestuous
Winds. We lost 28 Men by Sickness, con∣tracted
by the Hardships which they endur'd
in the bad Weather; and had not Sir <HI>Stafford
Fairborne</HI> by his great care and diligence, got
the Ship out of <HI>Gottenbourgh,</HI> and by that pre∣vented
her being frozen up, most part of the

of the Winter, which is intolerable Cold in
those parts.</P>

<P>“This is a short but terrible Article, there
was one Ship called the <HI>York,</HI> which was lost
about 3 days before the great Storm off of
<HI>Harwich,</HI> but most of the Men were saved.”</P>
<P>“The loss immediately sustain'd in the Roy∣al
Navy during the Storm, is included in
the List hereunto annex'd, as appears from

<P>“The damage done to the Ships that
were sav'd, is past our Power to compute.
The Admiral, Sir <HI>Cloudesley Shovel</HI> with
the great Ships, had made sail but the day
before out of tho <HI>Downs,</HI> and were taken
with the Storm as they lay at or near the
<HI>Gunfleet,</HI> where they being well provided

<P>THO' this was some time after the Storm,

the East Riding of <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></P>
<P>The Letter from <HI>Hull,</HI> from the Reverend
Mr. <HI>Banks,</HI> Minister of the Place, is very parti∣cular,
and deserves intire Credit, both from the
extraordinary Character of the worthy Gentle∣man
who writes it, and from its exact Corre∣spondence

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Receiv'd yours, wherein you acquaint me
with a Design that (I doubt not) will meet
with that Applause and Acceptance from the
World which it deserves; but am in no capaci∣ty
to be any way serviceable to it my self, the
late Hurricane having more frighted than hurt
us in these Parts. I doubt not but your Intelli∣gence
in general from the Northern Parts of the
Nation, supplies you with as little Matter as
what you have from these hereabouts, it having
been less violent and mischievous that way.
Some Stacks of Chimneys were over-turn'd here,
<PB N="226" REF="241"/>
and from one of them a little Child of my own
was (thanks be to God) almost miraculously
preserv'd, with a Maid that lay in the Room
with him. I hear of none else this way that
was so much as in danger, the Storm beginning
here later than I perceive it did in some other
Places, its greatest Violence being betwixt 7 and
8 in the Morning, when most People were stir∣ring.</P>
<P>The
Earthquake, which the Publick Accounts
mention to have happen'd at <HI>Hull</HI> and <HI>Lincoln</HI>
upon the 28th <HI>ult.</HI> was felt here by some People
about 6 in the Evening, at the same time that
People there, as well as at <HI>Grantham</HI> and other
Places, perceived it. We have some flying Sto∣ries
about it which look like fabulous, whose
Credit therefore I wou'd not be answerable for;
as, that upon <HI>Lincoln-Health</HI> the Ground was
seen to open, and Flashes of Fire to issue out of
the Chasm.</P>
<P>I doubt this Account will hardly be thought
worth the Charge of Passage: Had there been
any thing else of note, you had been very readi∣ly
serv'd by,</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am afraid that you will believe me very
rude, that yours, which I receiv'd the 12th
of <HI>April,</HI> has not sooner receiv'd such an An∣swer
as you expect and desire, and truly I think
<PB N="227" REF="242"/>
deserve; for, a Design so generous, as to un∣dertake
to transmit to Posterity, A Memorial
of the dreadful Effects of the late terrible Tem∣pest
(that when God's Judgments are in the
World, they may be made so publick, as to in∣gage
the Inhabitants of the Earth to learn Righ∣teousness)
ought to receive all possible Encou∣ragement.</P>
<P>But
the true Reason why I writ no sooner,
was, Because, by the most diligent Enquiries I
cou'd make, I cou'd not learn what Harm that
dreadful Tempest did in the <HI>Humber;</HI> neither
indeed can I yet give you any exact Account of
it: for, the great Mischief was done in the
Night; which was so Pitch-dark, that of above
80 Ships that then rid in the <HI>Humber,</HI> about
<HI>Grimsby</HI> Road, very few escap'd some Loss or
other, and none of 'em were able to give a
Relation of any body but themselves.</P>
<P>The best Account of the Effects of the Storm
in the <HI>Humber,</HI> that I have yet met with, I re∣ceived
but Yesterday, from Mr. <HI>Peter Walls,</HI>
who is Master of that Watch-Tower, call<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the
<HI>Spurn-Light,</HI> at the <HI>Humber</HI> Mouth, and was
present there on the Night of the 26th of <HI>No∣vember,</HI>
the fatal Night of the Storm.</P>
<P>He did verily believe that his Pharos (which
is above 20 Yards high) wou'd have been
blown down; and the Tempest made the Fire
in it burn so vehemently, that it melted down
the Iron-bars on which it laid, like Lead; so
that they were forced, when the Fire was by
this means almost extinguished; to put in new
<PB N="228" REF="243"/>
Bars, and kindle the Fire a-fresh, which they
kept in till the Morning Light appear'd: And
then <HI>Peter Walls</HI> observed about six or seven and
twenty Sail of Ships, all driving about the
<HI>Spurn-Head,</HI> some having cut, others broke their
Cables, but all disabled, and render'd helpless.
These were a part of the two Fleets that then
lay in the <HI>Humber,</HI> being put in there by stress
of Weather a day or two before, some from
<HI>Russia,</HI> and the rest of 'em <HI>Colliers,</HI> to and from
<HI>Nowcastle.</HI> Of these, three were driven upon
an Island call'd the <HI>Den,</HI> within the <HI>Spurn</HI> in
the Mouth of the <HI>Humber.</HI></P>
<P>The first of these no sooner touch'd Ground,
but she over-set, and turn'd up her Bottom;
out of which, only one of six (the Number of
that Ship's Company) was lost, being in the
Shrowds: the other five were taken up by the
second Ship, who had sav'd their Boat. In this
Boat were saved all the Men of the three Ships
aforementioned (except as before excepted)
and came to Mr. <HI>Walls</HI>'s House, at the <HI>Spurn-Head,</HI>
who got them good Fires, and all Ac∣commodations
necessary for them in such a Di∣stress.
The second Ship having no body aboard,
was driven to Sea, with the Violence of the
Tempest, and never seen or heard of more.
The third, which was then a-ground, was (as
he supposes) broken up and driven; for no∣thing,
but some Coals that were in her, was
to be seen the next Morning.</P>
<P>Another Ship, the Day after, <HI>viz.</HI> the 27th
of <HI>November,</HI> was riding in <HI>Grimsby</HI> Road, and
<PB N="229" REF="244"/>
the Ships Company (except two Boys) being
gone a-shore, the Ship, with the two Lads in
her, drive directly out of <HI>Humber,</HI> and was lost,
tho' 'tis verily believ'd the two Boys were saved
by one of the <HI>Russia</HI> Ships, or Convoys.</P>
<P>The same Day, in the Morning, one <HI>John
Baines,</HI> a <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Master, was in his Ship, ri∣ding
in <HI>Grimsby</HI> Road, and by the Violence of
the Storm, some other Ships coming foul upon
him, part of his Ship was broken down, and
was driven towards Sea; whereupon he ancho∣red
under <HI>Kilnsey-Land,</HI> and with his Crew came
safe a-shore, in his Boat, but the Ship was ne∣ver
seen more.</P>
<P>The remainder of the six or seven and twenty
Sail aforesaid, being (as was before observed)
driven out of the <HI>Humber,</HI> very few, if any of
'em, were ever heard of; and 'tis rationally be∣liev'd,
that all, or the most of them, perished.
And indeed, altho' the Storm was not so vio∣lent
here as it was about <HI>Portsmouth, Yarmouth</HI>
Roads, and the Southern Coast, yet the Crews
of the three Ships above-mentioned declare, that
they were never out in so dismal a Night as that
was of the 26th of <HI>November,</HI> in which the con∣siderable
Fleet aforesaid rid in <HI>Grimsby</HI> Road in
the <HI>Humber;</HI> for most of the 80 Sail broke from
their Anchors, and run foul one upon another;
but by reason of the Darkness of the Night,
they cou'd see very little of the Mischief that
was done.</P>
<P>This is the best Account I can give you at
present of the Effects of the Tempest in the
<PB N="230" REF="245"/>
<HI>Humber;</HI> whereas had the Enquiry been made
immediately after the Storm was over, a great
many more of remarkable Particulars might
have been discover'd.</P>
<P>As to the Earthquake here, tho' I perceiv'd
it not my self (being then walking to visit a
sick Parishoner) yet it was so sensibly felt by so
many Hundreds, that I cannot in the least que∣stion
the Truth and Certainty of it.</P>
<P>It happen'd here, and in these Parts, upon
<HI>Innocent</HI>'s Day, the 28th of <HI>December,</HI> being
<HI>Tuesday,</HI> about Five of the Clock in the Even∣ing,
or thereabout. Soon after I gave as parti∣cular
Account as I cou'd learn of it, to that in∣genious
Antiquary Mr. <HI>Thorsby</HI> of <HI>Leeds</HI> in <HI>York∣shire,</HI>
but had no time to keep a Copy of my
Letter to him, nor have I leisure to transcribe a
Copy of this to you, having so constant a Fa∣tigue
of Parochial business to attend; nor will
my Memory serve me to recollect all the Cir∣cumstances
of that Earthquake, as I sent them
to Mr. <HI>Thoresby;</HI> and possibly he may have
communicated that Letter to you, or will upon
your least intimation, being a generous Person,
who loves to communicate any thing that may
be serviceable to the Publick.</P>
<P>However, lest I shou'd seem to decline the
gratifying your Request, I will recollect, and
here set down, such of the Circumstances of that
Earthquake as do at present occur to my Me∣mory.</P>
<P>It
came with a Noise like that of a Coach
in the Streets, and mightily shak'd both the
<PB N="231" REF="246"/>
Glass Windows, Pewter, <HI>China</HI> Pots and
Dishes, and in some places threw them down
off the Shelves on which they stood. It did ve∣ry
little Mischief in this Town, except the throw∣ing
down a Piece of one Chimney. Several Per∣sons
thought that a great Dog was got under
the Chair they sat upon; and other fell from
their Seats, for fear of falling. It frighted seve∣ral
Persons, and caus'd 'em for a while to break
off their Reading, or Writing, or what they
were doing.</P>
<P>They felt but one Shake here: but a Gentle∣man
in <HI>Nottinghamshire</HI> told me, that being then
lame upon his Bed, he felt three Shakes, like
the three Rocks of a Cradle, to and again.</P>
<P>At <HI>Laceby</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and in several other
Parts of that County, as well as of the Counties
of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the Earthquake was
felt very sensibly; and particularly at <HI>Laceby</HI> a∣foresaid.
There happen'd this remarkable Story.</P>
<P>On <HI>Innocent</HI>'s Day, in the Afternoon, several
Morrice-Dancers came thither from <HI>Grimsby;</HI>
and after they had Danc'd and play'd their
Tricks, they went towards <HI>Alesby,</HI> a little Town
not far off: and as they were going about Five
a Clock, they felt two such terrible Shocks of
the Earth, that they had much ado to hold their
Feet, and thought the Ground was ready to o∣pen,
and swallow 'em up. Whereupon think∣ing
that God was angry at 'em for playing the
Fool, they return'd immediately to <HI>Laceby</HI> in a
great Fright, and the next Day home, not da∣ring
to pursue their intended Circuit and Dan∣cing.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="247"/>
I think 'tis the Observation of Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> that
upon an Earthquake the Earth sends forth noi∣some
Vapours which infect the Air, as the Air
does our Bodies: and accordingly it has prov'd
here, where we have ever since had a most
sickly time, and the greatest Mortality that has
been in this Place for 15 Years last past: and so
I believe it has been over the greatest part of
<HI>England.</HI> This, SIR, is the best Account I can
give you of the Earthquake, which had com'd
sooner, but that I was desirous to get likewise
the best Account I cou'd of the Effects of the
Storm in the <HI>Humber.</HI> My humble Service to

<HEAD>Part of two Letters from Mr. Thoresby,
F. R. S. to the Publisher, concerning an
Earthquake, which happen'd in some Pla∣cos
of the North of England, the <DATE>28th of
December 1703.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>YOU have heard, no doubt, of the late
<HI>Earthquake</HI> that affected some part of the
<PB N="233" REF="248"/>
North, as the dreadful Storm did the South.
It being most observable at <HI>Hull,</HI> I was desirous
of an Account from thence that might be de∣pended
upon; and therefore writ to the very
obliging Mr. <HI>Banks,</HI> Prebendary of <HI>York,</HI> who
being Vicar of <HI>Hull,</HI> was the most suitable Per∣son
I knew to address my self unto: and he be∣ing
pleased to favour me with a judicious Ac∣count
of it, I will venture to communicate it to
you, with his pious Reflection thereupon. “As
to the Earthquake you mention, it was felt
here on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 28th of the last Month,
which was <HI>Childermas</HI> Day, about three or
four Minutes after Five in the Evening. I con∣fess
I did not feel it my self; for I was at that
moment walking to visit a sick Gentleman,
and the Noise in the Streets, and my quick
Motion, made it impossible, I believe, for me
to feel it: but it was so almost universally felt,
that there can be no manner of doubt of the
Truth of it.”</P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>Peers,</HI> my Reader, (who is an ingeni∣ous
good Man) was then at his Study, and
Writing; but the heaving up of his Chair and
his Desk, the Shake of his Chamber, and
the rattling of his Windows, did so amaze
him, that he was really affrighted, and was
forc'd for a while to give over his Work: and
there are twenty such Instances amongst
Tradesmen, too tedious to repeat. My Wife
was then in her Closet, and thought her <HI>China</HI>
would have come about her Ears, and my Fa∣mily
felt the Chairs mov'd, in which they were
<PB N="234" REF="249"/>
sitting by the Kitchen Fire-side, and heard such
a Rattle of the Pewter and Windows as almost
affrighted them. A Gentlewoman not far off
said, her Chair lifted so high, that she thought
the great Dog had got under it, and to save
her self from falling, slipt off her Chair. I
sent to a House where part of a Chimney was
shak'd down, to enquire of the particulars;
they kept Ale, and being pretty full of Com∣pany
that they were merry, they did not per∣ceive
the Shock, only heard the Pewter and
Glass-windows dance; but the Landlady's Mo∣ther,
who was in a Chamber by her self, felt
the Shock so violent, that she verily believed
the House to be coming down (as part of the
Chimney afore mention'd did at the same Mo∣ment)
and cried out in a Fright, and had fall'n,
but that she catched hold of a Table. It came
and went suddenly, and was attended with a
Noise like the Wind, though there was then a
perfect Calm.”</P>
<P>From other Hands I have an Account that it
was felt in <HI>Beverly,</HI> and other Places; at <HI>South
Dalton</HI> particularly, where the Parson's Wife
(my own Sister) being alone in her Chamber,
was sadly frighted with the heaving up of the
Chair she sat in, and the very sensible Shake of
the Room, especially the Widows, <HI>&amp; c.</HI> A Rela∣tion
of mine, who is a Minister near <HI>Lincoln,</HI>
being then at a Gentleman's House in the Neigh∣bourhood,
was amaz'd at the Moving of the
Chairs they sat upon, which was so violent, he
writes every Limb of him was shaken; I am
<PB N="235" REF="250"/>
told also from a true Hand, that so nigh us as
<HI>Selby,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Travers,</HI> a Minister, being in
his Study writing, was interrupted much as
Mr. <HI>Peers</HI> above-mentioned; which minds me
of worthy Mr. <HI>Bank</HI>'s serious Conclusion. “And
now I hope you will not think it unbecoming
my Character to make this Reflection upon it,
<HI>viz.</HI> that Famines, Pestilences and Earthquakes,
are joyned by our Blessed Saviour, as portend∣ing
future Calamities, and particularly the De∣struction
of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and the <HI>Jewish</HI> State; if
not the End of the World, St. <HI>Matth.</HI> 24. 7.
And if, as Philosophers observe, those gentler
Convulsions within the Bowels of the Earth,
which give the Inhabitants but an easie Jog,
do usually portend the Approach of some more
dreadful Earthquake; then surely we have
Reason to fear the worst, because I fear we
so well deserve it, and pray God of his infinite
Mercy to avert his future Judgments.”</P>
<P>SInce my former Account of the Earthquake
at <HI>Hull,</HI> my Cousin <HI>Cookson</HI> has procured to
me the following Account from his Brother,
who is a Clergyman near <HI>Lincoln, viz,</HI> That he,
being about Five in the Evening, <HI>December</HI> the
20th past, set with a neighbouring Minister at
his House about a Mile from <HI>Navenby,</HI> they
were surpriz'd with a sudden Noise, as if it had
been of two or three Coaches driven furiously
down the Yard, whereupon the Servant was
sent to the Door, in Expectation of some Stran∣gers;
but they quickly perceived what it was,
<PB N="236" REF="251"/>
by the shaking of the Chairs they sat upon; they
could perceive the very Stones move: the great∣est
Damage was to the Gentlewoman of the
House, who was put into such a Fright, that
she miscarried two Days after. He writes, they
were put into a greater Fright upon the Fast-day;
when there was so violent a Storm, they
verily thought the Church would have fallen up∣on
them. We had also at <HI>Leedes</HI> a much great∣er
Storm the Night preceding the Fast, and a
stronger Wind that Day, than when the fatal
Storm was in the South; but a good Providence
timed this well, to quicken our too cold Devo∣tions.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE short Account I now send to shew
the Providence of God in the late Dread∣ful
Storm, (if yet it comes not too late) I had
from the Mouth of the Gentleman himself,
Mr. <HI>Woodgate Gisser</HI> by Name, who is a Neigh∣bour
of mine, living in St. <HI>Martin's-street</HI> in the
Parish of St. <HI>Martins</HI> in the Fields, and a Suf∣ferer
in the common Calamity; is as follows,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Between Two and Three of the Clock in the
Morning, my Neighbour's Stack of Chimneys fell,
and broke down the Roof of my Garret into the
Passage going up and down Stairs; upon which,
I thought it convenient to retire into the Kitchen
with my Family; where we had not been above
a Quarter of an Hour, before my Wife sent her
Maid to fetch some Necessaries out of a Back
Parlour Closet, and as she had shut the Door,
and was upon her Return, the very same In∣stant
my Neighbour's Stack of Chimneys, on
the other Side of the House, fell upon my Stack,
and beat in the Roof, and so drove down the
<PB N="238" REF="253"/>
several Floors through the Parlour into the
Kitchen, where the Maid was buried near Five
Hours in the Rubbish, without the least Da∣mage
or Hurt whatsoever: This her miraculous
Preservation was occasion'd (as I afterwards
with Surprize found) by her falling into a small
Cavity near the Bed, and afterwards (as she
declar'd) by her creeping under the Tester that
lay hollow by Reason of some Joices that
lay athwart each other, which prevented her
perishing in the said Rubbish: About Eight in
the Morning, when I helped her out of the
Ruins, and asked her how she did, and why
she did not cry out for Assistance, since she was
not (as I suppos'd she had been) dead, and so
to let me know she was alive; her Answer was,
that truly she for her Part had felt no Hurt, and
was not the least affrighted, but lay quiet; and
which is more, even slumbred until then.</P>
<P>The Preservation of my self, and the rest of
my Family, about Eleven in Number, was,
next to the Providence of God, occasion'd by
our running into a Vault almost level with the
Kitchen upon the Noise and Alarm of the Fal∣ling
of the Chimeys, which breaking through
three Floors, and about two Minutes in passing,
gave us the Opportunities of that Retreat.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you for your charitable Visit not
long since; I could have heartily wish'd
your Business would have permitted you
to have made a little longer Stay at the
Parsonage, and then you might have taken
a stricker View of the Ruins by the late terrible
Wind. Seeing you are pleas'd to desire from
me a more particular Account of that sad Disa∣ster;
I have for your fuller Satisfaction sent you
the best I am able to give; and if it be not so
perfect, and so exact a one, as you may expect,
you may rely upon me it is a true, and a faith∣ful
one, and that I do not impose upon you, or
the World in the least in any Part of the follow∣ing
Relation. I shall not trouble you with the
Uneasiness the Family was under all the fore
Part of the Evening, even to a Fault, as I
thought, and told them, I did not then appre∣hend
the Wind to be much higher than it had
been often on other Times; but went to Bed,
hoping we were more afraid than we needed to
have been: when in Bed, we began to be more
sensible of it, and lay most of the Night awake,
dreading every Blast till about Four of the Clock
in the Morning, when to our thinking it seemed
a little to abate; and then we fell asleep, and
<PB N="240" REF="255"/>
slept till about Six of the Clock, at which Time
my Wife waking, and calling one of her Maids
to rise, and come to the Children, the Maid rose,
and hasten'd to her; she had not been up above
Half an Hour, but all on the sudden we heard
a prodigious Noise, as if part of the House had
been fallen down: I need not tell you the Con∣sternation
we were all in upon this Alarm; in a
Minutes Time, I am sure, I was surrounded
with all my Infantry, that I thought I should
have been overlay'd; I had not even Power to
stir one Limb of me, much less to rise, though
I could not tell how to lie in Bed. The Shrieks
and the Cries of my dear Babes perfectly stun'd
me; I think I hear them still in my Ears, I shall
not easily, I am confident, if ever, forget them.
There I lay preaching Patience to those little
Innocent Creatures, till the Day began to ap∣pear.</P>
<P><HI>Preces &amp; La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrimae,</HI> Prayers and Tears, the
Primitive Christians Weapons, we had great
Plenty of to defend us withal; but had the
House all fallen upon our Heads, we were in
that Fright as we could scarce have had Power
to rise for the present, or do any thing for our
Security. Upon our rising, and sending a Ser∣vant
to view what she could discover, we soon
understood that the Chimney was fallen down,
and that with its Fall it had beaten down a great
part of that End of the House, <HI>viz.</HI> the Upper
Chamber, and the Room under it, which was
the Room I chose for my Study: The Chim∣ney
was thought as strong, and as well built as
<PB N="241" REF="256"/>
most in the Neighbourhood; and it surpriz'd the
Mason (whom I immediately sent for to view
it) to see it down: but that which was most sur∣prizing
to me, was the Manner of its Falling;
had it fallen almost any other Way than that it
did, it must in all Likelihood have killed the
much greater part of my Family, for no less than
Nine of us lay at that End of the House, my
Wife and Self, and Five Children, and Two
Servants, a Maid, and a Man then in my Pay,
and so a Servant, though not by the Year: The
Bed my Eldest Daughter and the Maid lay in
joyned as near as possible to the Chimney, and
it was within a very few Yards of the Bed that
we lay in; so that as <HI>David</HI> said to <HI>Jonathan,</HI>
there seem'd to be but one single Step between
Death and us, to all outward Appearance. One
Thing I cannot omit, which was very remarka∣ble
and surprizing: It pleased God so to order
it, that in the Fall of the House two great Spars
seem'd to fall so as to pitch themselves on an
End, and by that Means to support that other
Part of the House which adjoined to the Upper
Chamber; or else in all Likelihood, that must
also have fallen too at the same Time. The
Carpenter (whom we sent for forth with) when
he came, ask'd who plac'd those two Support∣ers,
supposing somebody had been there before
him; and when he was told, those two Spars
in the Fall so plac'd themselves, he could scarce
believe it possible; it was done so artificially,
that he declar'd, they scarce needed to have been
removed.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="257"/>
In ssiort, Sir, it is impossible to describe the
Danger we were in; you your self was an Eye-witness
of some Part of what is here related;
and I once more assure you, the whole Account
I have here given you is true, and what can be
attested by the whole Family. None of all those
unfortunate Persons who are said to have been
killed with the Fall of a Chimney, could well be
much more expos'd to Danger than we were; it
is owing wholly to that watchful Provi∣dence
to whom we all are indebted for every
Minute of our Lives, that any of us escaped;
none but he who never sleeps nor slumbers
could have secured us. I beseech Almighty God
to give us All that due Sense as we ought to have
of so great and so general Calamity; that we
truly repent us of those Sins that have so long
provoked his Wrath against us, and brought
down so heavy a Judgment as this upon us. 0

<P>Another Account from a Reverend Ministe
in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> take as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<PB N="243" REF="258"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have desired an Account of the Di∣sasters
occasion'd by the late Tempest,
(which I can assure you was in these Parts very
Terrible) so I think my self oblig'd to let you
know, that there was a great Mixture of Mer∣cy
with it: For though the Hurricane was
frightful, and very mischievous, yet God's gra∣cious
Providence was therein very remarkable,
in restraining its Violence from an universal
Destruction: for then there was a Commotion
of the Elements of Air, Earth and Water,
which then seemed to outvie each other in Mis∣chief;
for (in <HI>David</HI>'s Expression, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22. 8.)
<HI>The Earth trembled and quak'd, the Foundations of
the Heavens mov'd and shook, because God was an∣gry:</HI>
and yet, when all was given over for lost,
we found our selves more scar'd than hurt; for
our Lives was given us for a Prey, and the
Tempest did us only so much Damage, as to
make us sensible that it might have done us a
great deal more, had it not been rebuk'd by the
God of Mercy; the Care of whose Providence
has been visibly seen in our wonderful Preserva∣tions.
My Self and Three more of this Parish
were then strangely rescued from the Grave:
J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>narrowly escaped with my Life, where I ap∣prehended
nothing of Danger; for going out a∣bout
Midnight to give Orders to my Servants to
secure the House, and Reeks of Corn and Fur∣ses
from being blown all away; as soon as I
<PB N="244" REF="259"/>
mov'd out of the Place were I stood, I heard some∣thing
of a great Weight fall close behind me,
and a little after going out with a Light, to see
what it was, I found it to be the great Stone
which covered the Top of my Chimney to keep
out the Wet; it was almost a Yard square, and
very thick, weighing about an Hundred and
Fifty Pound. It was blown about a Yard off
from the Chimney, and fell Edge-long, and cut
the Earth, about four Inches deep, exactly be∣tween
my Foot-steps; and a little after, whilst
sitting under the Clavel of my Kitchen Chim∣ney,
and reaching out my Arm for some Fewel
to mend the Fire, I was again strangely preser∣ved
from being knock'd on the Head by a Stone
of great Weight; it being about a Foot long,
Half a Foot braod, and two Inches thick: for
as soon as I had drawn in my Arm, I felt some∣thing
brush against my Elbow, and presently I
heard the Stone fall close by my Foot, a third
Part of which was broken off by the Violence
of the Fall, and skarr'd my Ancle, but did not
break the Skin; it had certainly killed me, had
it fallen while my Arm was extended. The
Top of my Wheat Rick was blown off, and
some of the Sheaves were carried a Stones Cast,
and with that Violence, that one of them, at
that Distance, strock down one <HI>Daniel Fookes</HI> a
late Servant of the Lady <HI>Napier,</HI> and so force∣ably,
that he was taken up dead, and to all Ap∣pearance
remain'd so a great while; but at last
was happily recover'd to Life again. His Mo∣ther,
poor Widow, was at the same time more
<PB N="245" REF="260"/>
fatally threatned at Home, and her Bed had
certainly prov'd her Grave, had not the first
Noise awaken'd and scar'd her out of Bed; and
she was scarce gotten to the Door, when the
House fell all in: The Smith's Wife likewise
being scar'd at such a Rate, leapt out of Bed,
with the little Child in her Arms, and ran hasti∣ly
out of Doors naked, without Hose or Shooes,
to a Neighbour's House; and by that hasty
Flight, both their Lives were wonderfully pre∣served.
The Sheets of Lead on <HI>Lytton</HI> Church,
were rolled up like Sheets of Parchment, and
blown off to a great Distance. At <HI>Strode,</HI> a
large Apple Tree, being about a Foot in Square,
was broken off cleverly like a Stick, about four
Foot from the Root, and carried over an Hedge
about ten Foot high; and cast, as if darted,
(with the Trunk forward) above fourteen
Yards off. And I am credibly inform'd, that at
<HI>Ellwood</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Abbotsbury,</HI> a large
Wheat Rick (belonging to one <HI>Jolyffe</HI>) was
cleverly blown, with its Staddle, off from the
Stones, and set down on the Ground in very
good Order. I would fain know of the Atheist
what mov'd his <HI>Omnipotent Matter</HI> to do such
Mischief, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A great Preservation in the late Storm.</HEAD>
<P>ABout Three of the Clock in the Morning,
the Violedce of the Wind blew down a
Stack of Chimneys belonging to the dwelling
House of Dr. <HI>Gideon Harvey,</HI> (situate in St.
<HI>Martin</HI>'s Lane over against the Street End) on the
back Part of the next House, wherein dwells
Mr. <HI>Robert Richards</HI> an Apothecary, at the Sign
of the Unicorn; and Capt. <HI>Theodore Collier</HI> and
his Family lodges in the same. The Chimney
fell with that Force as made them pierce thro'
the Roofs and all the Floors, carrying them
down quite to the Ground. The two Families,
consisting of Fourteen, Men, Women, and
Children, besides Three that came in from the
next House, were at that Instant dispos'd of as
follows, a Footman that us'd to lie in the back
Garret, had not a Quarter of an Hour before re∣mov'd
himself into the fore Garret, by which
means he escap'd the Danger: In the Room
under that lay Capt. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Child, of Two
Months old, in Bed with the Nurse, and a Ser∣vant
Maid lay on the Bed by her; the Nurse's
Child lying in a Cribb by the Bed-side, which
was found, with the Child safe in it, in the
Kitchen, where the Nurse and Maid likewise
found themselves; their Bed being shatter'd in
<PB N="247" REF="262"/>
Pieces, and they a little bruis'd by falling down
Three Stories: Capt. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Child was in about
Two Hours found unhurt in some Pieces of the
Bed and Curtains, which had fallen through
Two Floors only, and hung on some broken
Rafters in that Place, which was the Parlour:
In the Room under This, being one Pair of
Stairs from the Street, and two from the Kitchen,
was Capt. <HI>Collier</HI> in his Bed, and his Wife just by
the Bed-side, and her Maid a little behind her,
who likewise found her self in the Kitchin a lit∣tle
bruis'd, and ran out to cry for Help for her
Master and Mistress, who lay buried under the
Ruins: Mrs. <HI>Collier</HI> was, by the timely Aid of
Neighbours who remov'd the Rubbish from her,
taken out in about Half an Hours Time, having
receiv'd no Hurt but the Fright, and an Arm a
little bruis'd: Capt. <HI>Collier</HI> in about Half an Hour
more was likewise taken out unhurt. In the
Parlour were sitting Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> with his Wife,
the Three Neighbours, and the rest of his Family,
a little Boy of about a Year old lying in the Cradle,
they all run out at the first Noise, and escap'd;
Mrs <HI>Richards</HI> staying a little longer than the rest,
to pull the Cradle with her Child in it along
with her, but the House fell too suddenly on it,
and buried the Child under the Ruins, a Rafter
fell on her Foot. and bruis'd it a little, at which
she likewise made her Escape, and brought in
the Neighbours, who soon uncovered the Head
of the Cradle, and cutting it off, took the Child
out alive and well. This wonderful Preserva∣tion

<P>IN order to promote the good Design of your

signal Judgment on this Nation, by the late
dreadful Tempest of Wind, which has hurl'd so
many Souls into Eternity; and likewise his

several Persons can witness besides my self; and
if you think proper may insert the same in the
Book you design for that Purpose; which is as
follows. At the <HI>Sara<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en</HI>'s Head in <HI>Friday</HI> Street,
a Country Lad lodging three Pair of Stairs next
the Roof of the House, was wonderfully pre∣serv'd
from Death; for about Two a Clock that
<HI>Saturday</HI> Morning the 27th of <HI>November,</HI> (which
prov'd fatal to so many) there fell a Chimney
upon the Roof, under which he lay, and beat
it down through the Ceiling (the Weight of the
Tiles, Bricks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being judged by a Workman
<PB N="249" REF="264"/>
to be about Five Hundred Weight) into the
Room, fell exactly between the Beds Feet and
Door of the Room, which are not Two Yards
distance from each other, it being but small:
the sudden Noise awaking the Lad, he jumps out
of Bed endeavouring to find the Door, but was
stopt by the great Dust and falling of more
Bricks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and finding himself prevented, in
this Fear he got into Bed again, and remain'd
there till the Day Light, (the Bricks and Tiles
still falling between-whiles about his Bed) and
then got up without any Hurt, or so much as a
Tile or Brick falling on the Bed; the only thing
he complain'd of to me, was his being almost
choak'd with Dust when he got out of Bed, or
put his Head out from under the Cloaths: There
was a great Weight of Tiles and Bricks, which
did not break through, as the Workmen in∣form
me, just over the Beds Tester, enough to
have crush'd him to Death, if they had fallen:
Thus he lay safe among the Dangers that threat∣ned
him, whilst wakeful Providence preserv'd
him. And SIR, if this be worthy your taking

the Roof, and beat down two Floors above him,

Bed down to the Ground, without the least
hurt, his Cloaths, and every thing besides in the
Room, being buried in the Rubbish; it having
pleased God so to order it, that just so much of
the Floor and Ceiling of the Room (from which
he fell) as covered his Bed, was not broken
down. Of this great Mercy he prays he may
live for ever mindful, and be for ever thankful
to Almighty God.</P>

<P>THE Design of your Collecting the re∣markable
Accidents of the late Storm co∣ming
to my Hands, I thought my self obliged
to take this Opportunity of making a publick
Acknowledgment of the wonderful Providence
of Heaven to me, namely, the Preservation of
my only Child from imminent Danger.</P>
<P>Two large Stacks of Chimneys, containing
each five Funnels, beat through the Roof, in
upon the Bed where she lay, without doing her
the least Harm, the Servant who lay with her
being very much bruised. There were several
Loads of Rubbish upon the Bed before my Child
was taken out of it.</P>
<P>This extraordinary Deliverance I desire al∣ways
thankfully to remember.</P>
<P>I was so nearly touch'd by this Accident, that
I could not take so much notice as I intended of
this Storm; yet I observ'd the Wind gradually
to encrease from One a Clock till a Quarter after
Five, or thereabouts: at which time it seem'd
<PB N="252" REF="267"/>
to be at the highest; when every Gust did not
only return with greater Celerity, but also with
more Force.</P>
<P>From about a Quarter before Six it sensibly
decreas'd. I went often to the Door, at which
times I observ'd, that every Gust was preceded
by small Flashes, which, to my Observation,
did not dart perpendicularly, but seem'd rather
to skim along the Surface of the Ground; nor
did they appear to be of the same kind with the
common Light'ning Flashes.</P>
<P>I must confess I cannot help thinking that
the Earth it self suffer'd some Convulsion; and
that for this Reason, because several Springs,
for the space of 48 Hours afterwards, were ve∣ry
muddy, which were never known to be so
by any Storm of Wind or Rain before: nor in∣deed
is it possible, they lying so low, could be
affected by any thing less than a Concussion of
the Earth it self.</P>
<P>How far these small Hints may be of use to
the more ingenious Enquirers into this matter,
I shall humbly leave to their Consideration,
and subscribe my self,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis comes to let you know that I recei∣ved
yours in the <HI>Downs,</HI> for which I thank
you. I expected to have seen you in <HI>London</HI>
before now, had we not met with a most vio∣lent
Storm in our way to <HI>Chatham.</HI> On the 27th
of the last Month, about Three of the Clock in
the Morning, we lost all our Anchors and drove
to Sea: about Six we lost our Rother, and were
left in a most deplorable condition to the mer∣ciless
Rage of the Wind and Seas: we also sprung
a Leak, and drove 48 Hours expecting to pe∣rish.
But it pleased God to give us a wonder∣ful
Deliverance, scarce to be parallell'd in Histo∣ry;
for about Midnight we were drove into
shoul Water, and soon after our Ship struck up∣on
the Sands: the Sea broke over us, we expe∣cted
every minute that she would drop to pieces,
and that we should all be swallowed up in the
Deep; but in less than two hours time we drove
over the Sands, and got (without Rother or
Pilot, or any Help but Almighty God's) into
this Place, where we run our Ship on shore, in
order to save our Lives: but it has pleased God
also, far beyond our expectation, to save our
Ship, and bring us safe off again last Night.
We shall remain here a considerable while to re∣fit
our Ship, and get a new Rother. Our De∣liverance
is most remarkable, that in the mid∣dle
of a dark Night we should drive over a Sand
where a Ship that was not half our Bigness durst
<PB N="254" REF="269"/>
not venture to come in the Day; and then,
without knowing where we were, drive into a
narrow place where we have saved both Lives
and Ship. I pray God give us all Grace to be
thankful, and never forget so great a mercy.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to the publick Notice, I send
you two or three Observations of mine
upon the late dreadful Tempest: As,</P>
<P>1. In the Parish of St. <HI>Mary Cray, Kent,</HI> a
poor Man, with his Wife and Child, were but
just gone out of their Bed, when the Head of
their House fell in upon it; which must have
kill'd them.</P>
<P>2. A great long Stable in the Town, near the
Church, was blown off the Foundation entirely
at one sudden Blast, from the West-side to the
East, and cast out into the High-way, over the
Heads of five Horses, and a Carter feeding them
at the same time, and not one of them hurt, nor
the Rack or Manger touch'd, which are yet
standing to the Admiration of all Beholders.</P>
<P>3. As the Church at <HI>Heyes</HI> received great Da∣mage,
so the Spire, with one Bell in it, were
blown away over the Church-yard.</P>
<P>4. The Minister of <HI>South-Ash</HI> had a great De∣liverance
from a Chimney falling in upon his
<PB N="255" REF="270"/>
Bed just as he rose, and hurt only his Feet; as
blessed be God, our Lives have been all very
miraculously preserv'd, tho' our Buildings every
where damag'd. You may depend on all, as
certify'd by me,</P>
<CLOSER><HI>Thomas Watts,</HI>
Vicar of <HI>Orpington</HI> and St. <HI>Mary Cray.</HI></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>There are an innumerable variety of Delive∣rances,
besides these, which deserve a Memori∣al
to future Ages; but these are noted from the
Letters, and at the Request of the Persons par∣ticularly
concern'd.</P>
<P>Particularly, 'tis a most remarkable Story of a
Man belonging to the <HI>Mary,</HI> a fourth Rate Man
of War, lost upon the <HI>Goodwin Sands;</HI> and all
the Ship's Company but himself being lost, he,
by the help of a piece of the broken Ship, got
a-board the <HI>Northumberland;</HI> but the Violence
of the Storm continuing, the <HI>Northumberland</HI>
ran the same fate with the <HI>Mary,</HI> and coming
on shore upon the same Sand, was split to pieces
by the Violence of the Sea: and yet this Person,
by a singular Providence, was one of the 64
that were delivered by a <HI>Deal Hooker</HI> out of that
Ship, all the rest perishing in the Sea.</P>
<P>A poor Sailor of <HI>Brighthelmston</HI> was taken up
after he had hung by his Hands and Feet on the
top of a Mast 48 hours, the Sea raging so high,
that no Boat durst go near him.</P>
<P>A Hoy run on shore on the Rocks in <HI>Milford</HI>
Haven, and just splitting to pieces (as by Cap∣tain
<HI>Soam</HI>'s Letter) a Boat drove by, being
<PB N="256" REF="271"/>
broke from another Vessel, with no body in it,
and came so near the Vessel, as that two Men
jumpt into it, and sav'd their Lives: the Boy
could not jump so far, and was drowned.</P>
<P>Five Sailors shifted three Vessels on an Island
near the <HI>Humber,</HI> and were at last sav'd by a
Long-boat out of the fourth.</P>
<P>A Waterman in the River of <HI>Thames</HI> lying
asleep in the Cabbin of a Barge, at or near
<HI>Black-Fryers,</HI> was driven thro' Bridge in the
Storm, and the Barge went of her self into the
<HI>Tower-Dock,</HI> and lay safe on shore; the Man
never wak'd, nor heard the Storm, till 'twas
Day; and, to his great▪ Astonishment, he found
himself safe as above.</P>
<P>Two Boys in the <HI>Poultry</HI> lodging in a Garret
or Upper-room, were, by the Fall of Chimneys,
which broke thro' the Floors, carried quite to
the bottom of the Cellar, and receiv'd no Da∣mage
at all.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT my Return home on <HI>Saturday</HI> at Night,
I receiv'd yours: and having said nothing
in my last concerning the Storm, I send this to
tell you, that I hear of nothing done by it in this
Country that may seem to deserve a particular
Remark. Several Houses and Barns were stript
of their Thatch, some Chimneys and Gables
blown down, and several Stacks of Corn and
Hay very much dispers'd; but I hear not of any
Persons either kill'd or maim'd; A Neighbour

to secure the Thatch, and the Barn at
that instant was overturn'd by the Storm; but
by the good Providence of God, the Man recei∣ved
little or no harm. I say no more, not know∣ing
of any thing more remarkable. I am sorry

I pray God avert the like Judgments for the
future. I am</P>

<HEAD>From on board a Ship blown out of the Downs
to Norway.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot but write to you of the Particulars
of our sad and terrible Voyage to this Place.
You know we were, by my last, riding safe in
the <HI>Downs,</HI> waiting a fair Wind, to make the
best of our way to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and there to ex∣pect
the <HI>Lisbon</HI> Convoy.</P>
<P>We had had two terrible Storms, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on the
<HI>Friday</HI> before, and one on <HI>Thursday;</HI> the one the
18th, the other the 25th of <HI>November:</HI> In the
last I expected we shou'd have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounder'd at an
Anchor; for our Ground Tackle being new and
very good held us fast, but the Sea broke upon
us so heavy and quick, that we were in danger
two or three times of Foundring as we rod:
but, as it pleas'd God we rid it ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, we began
to think all was over, and the Bitterness of
Death was past.</P>
<P>There was a great Fleet with us in the <HI>Downs,</HI>
and several of them were driven from their
Anchors, and made the best of their way out to
Sea for fear of going on shore upon the <HI>Goodwin.</HI>
the Grand Fleet was just come in from the
<HI>Streights,</HI> under Sir <HI>Clou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Shovel;</HI> and the
Great Ships being design'd for the River, lay to
<PB N="261" REF="276"/>
Leeward: Most of the Ships that went out in
the Night appear'd in the Morning; and I
think there was none known to be lost, but one
<HI>Dutch</HI> Vessel upon the <HI>Goodwin.</HI></P>
<P>But the next Day, being <HI>Friday,</HI> in the Even∣ing,
it began to gather to Windward; and as
it had blown very hard all Day, at Night the
Wind freshen'd, and we all expected a stormy
Night. We saw the Men of War strcuk their
Top-masts, and rode with two Cables an-end:
so we made all as <HI>snug</HI> as we could, and prepar'd
for the worst.</P>
<P>In this condition we rid it out till about 12 a-clock;
when, the Fury of the Wind encreasing,
we began to see Destruction before us: the Ob∣jects
were very dreadful on every side; and tho'
it was very dark, we had Light enough to see
our own Danger, and the Danger of those near
us. About One a-clock the Ships began to drive,
and we saw several come by us without a Mast
standing, and in the utmost Distress.</P>
<P>By Two a-clock we could hear Guns firing in
several Parts of this Road, as Signals of Distress;
and tho' the Noise was very great with the Sea
and Wind, yet we could distinguish plainly, in
some short Intervals, the Cries of poor Souls in
Extremities.</P>
<P>By Four-a-clock we miss'd the <HI>Mary</HI> and the
<HI>Northumberland,</HI> who rid not far from us, and
found they were driven from their Anchors;
but what became of them, God knows: and
soon after a large Man of War came driving
down upon us, all her Masts gone, and in a
<PB N="262" REF="277"/>
dreadful Condition. We were in the utmost
Despair at this sight, for we saw no avoiding
her coming thwart <HI>our Haiser:</HI> she drove at last
so near us, that I was just gowing to order the
Mate to cut away, when it pleas'd God the Ship
sheer'd contrary to our Expectation to Wind∣ward,
and the Man of War, which we found
to be the <HI>Sterling Castle,</HI> drove clear off us, not
two Ships Lengths to Leeward.</P>
<P>It was a Sight full of terrible Particulars, to
see a Ship of Eighty Guns and about Six Hun∣dred
Men in that dismal Case; she had cut a∣way
all her Masts, the Men were all in the
Confusions of Death and Despair; she had nei∣ther
Anchor, nor Cable, nor Boat to help her;
the Sea breaking over her in a terrible Manner,
that sometimes she seem'd all under Water; and
they knew, as well as we that saw her, that
they drove by the Tempest directly for the
<HI>Goodwin,</HI> where they could expect nothing but
Destruction: The Cries of the Men, and the
firing their Guns, One by One, every Half Mi∣nute
for Help, terrified us in such a Manner,
that I think we were half dead with the Horror
of it.</P>
<P>All this while we rid with two Anchors a-head,
and in great Distress: To fire Guns for Help,
I saw was to no Purpose, for if any Help was
to be had, there were so many other Objects
for it, that we could not expect it, and the Storm
still encreasing.</P>
<P>Two Ships, a-head of us, had rid it out till
now, which was towards Five in the Morning
<PB N="263" REF="278"/>
when they both drove from their Anchors, and
one of them coming foul of a small <HI>Pink,</HI> they
both sunk together; the other drove by us, and
having one Mast standing, I think it was her
Main-Mast, she attempted to spread a little
Peak of her Sail, and so stood away before it;
I suppose she went away to Sea.</P>
<P>At this time, the Raging of the Sea was so
violent, and the Tempest doubled its Fury in such
a Manner, that my Mate told me, we had better
go away to Sea, for 'twould be impossible to ride
it out; I was not of his Opinion, but was for
cutting my Masts by the Board, which at last
we did, and parted with them with as little
Damage as could be expected, and we thought
she rid easier for it by a great deal; and I believe,
had it blown two Hours longer, we should
have rid it out, having two new Cables out,
and our best Bower and Sheet Anchor down:
But about Half an Hour after Five to Six, it blew,
if it be possible to conceive it so, as hard again as
it had done before, and first our best Bower An∣chor
came Home, the Mate, who felt it give
way, cried out, we are all undone, for the Ship
drove; I found it too true, and, upon as short a
Consultation as the Time would admit, we con∣cluded
to put out to Sea before we were driven
too far to Leward, when it would be impossible
to avoid the <HI>Goodwin.</HI></P>
<P>So vve slipt our Sheet Cable, and sheering
the Ship tovvards the Shore, got her Head about,
and stood avvay afore it; Sail vve had none, nor
Mast standing: Our Mate had set up a Jury
<PB N="264" REF="279"/>
Missen but no Canvass could bear the Fury of
the Wind, yet he fasten'd an old Tarpaulin so
as that it did the Office of a Missen and kept us
from driving too fast to Leeward.</P>
<P>In this Condition we drove out of the <HI>Downs,</HI>
and past so near the <HI>Goodwin,</HI> that we could see
several great Ships fast a ground, and beating to
Pieces. We drove in this desperate Condition
till Day-break, without any Abatement of the
Storm, and our Men heartless and dispirited,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir'd with the Service of the Night, and every
Minute expecting Death.</P>
<P>About 8 a Clock, my Mate told me, he perceiv'd
the Wind to abate; but it blew still such a Storm,
that if we had not had a very tite Ship, she must
have founder'd, as we were now farther off at
Sea, and by my Guess might be in the mid Way
between <HI>Harwi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h</HI> and the <HI>Brill,</HI> the Sea we
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound run longer, and did not break so quick
upon us as before, but it ran exceeding high,
and we having no Sail to keep us to rights, we lay
wallowing in the Trough of the Sea in a mise∣rable
Condition: We saw several Ships in the
same Condition with our selves, but could nei∣ther
help them, nor they us; and one we
saw founder before our Eyes, and all the Peo∣ple
perish'd.</P>
<P>Another dismal Object we met with, which
was an open Boat full of Men, who, as we may
suppose, had lost their Ship; any Man may sup∣pose,
what Condition a Boat must be in, if we
were in so bad a Case in a good Ship: we were
soon tost out of their Sight, and what became
<PB N="265" REF="280"/>
of them any one may guess; if they had been
within Cables Length of us we could not have
help'd them.</P>
<P>About Two a Clock in the Afternoon, the
Wind encreased again, and we made no
doubt it would prove as bad a Night as be∣fore;
but that Gust held not above Half an
Hour.</P>
<P>All Night it blew excessive hard, and the next
Day, which was Sabbath Day, about Eleven a
Clock it abated, but still blew hard: about three
it blew something moderately, compar'd with
the former; and we got up a Jury<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Main-Mast,
and rigg'd it as well as we could, and with a
Main Sail lower'd almost to the Deck, stood at
a great Rate afore it all Night and the next Day,
and on <HI>Tuesday</HI> Morning we saw Land, but could
not tell where it was; but being not in a Condi∣on
to keep the Sea, we run in, and made Signals
of Distress; some Pilots came off to us, by whom
we were inform'd we had reached the Coast of
<HI>Norway,</HI> and having neither Anchor nor Cable
on board capable to ride the Ship, a <HI>Norweigian</HI>
Pilot came on board, and brought us into a
Creek where we had smooth Water, and lay by
till we got Help, Cables, and Anchors, by which
means we are safe in Place.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEaring of your good Design of preserving
the Memory of the late Dreadful Storm
for the Benefit of Posterity, I cannot let you
want the Particulars as happen'd to us on board
our Ship.</P>
<P>We came over the Bar of <HI>Tinmouth</HI> about the
having had terrible blowing Weather
for almost a Week, insomuch that we were twice
driven back almost the Length of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> with
much Difficulty and Danger we got well over
that, and made the <HI>High-land</HI> about <HI>Cromer</HI> on
the North-side of <HI>Norfolk;</HI> here it blew so hard
the <HI>Wednesday</HI> Night before, that we could not
keep the Sea, nor fetch the Roads of <HI>Yarmouth;</HI>
but as the Coast of <HI>Norfolk</HI> was a Weather-shore,
we hall'd as close <HI>Cromer</HI> as we durst lie, the
Shore there being very flat; here we rode <HI>Wed∣nesday</HI>
and <HI>Thursday,</HI> the 24th and 25th of <HI>No∣vember.</HI></P>
<P>We
could not reckon our selves safe here, for as
this is the most dangerous Place between <HI>London</HI>
and <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and has been particularly fatal to
our Colliers, so we were very uneasy: I consi∣dered
that when such Tempestuous Weather
happen'd, as this seem'd to threaten, nothing is
more frequent than for the Wind to shift Points;
<PB N="267" REF="282"/>
and if it should have blown half the Wind from
the South East, as now blew from the South
West, we must have gone a-shore there, and
been all lost for being embayed; there we should
have had no putting out to Sea, nor staying
there.</P>
<P>This Consideration made me resolve to be
gon, and thinking on <HI>Friday</HI> Morning the Wind
slacken'd a little, I weigh'd and stood away for
<HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roads; and with great Boating and
Labour got into the Roads about One in the Af∣ternoon,
being a little after Flood, we found a
very great Fleet in the Roads; there was above
Three Hundred Sail of Colliers, not reckoning
above Thirty Sail which I left behind me, that
rode it out thereabouts, and there was a great
Fleet just come from <HI>Russia,</HI> under the Convoy
of the <HI>Reserve</HI> Frigate, and Two other Men of
War; and about a Hundred Sail of Coasters,
<HI>Hull</HI>-Men, and such small Craft.</P>
<P>We had not got to an Anchor, moor'd, and
set all to Rights, but I found the Wind freshen'd,
the Clouds gather'd, and all look'd very black
to Windward; and my Mate told me, he
wish'd he had staid where we were, for he
would warrant it we had a blowing Night
of it.</P>
<P>We did what we could to prepare for it,
struck our Top-mast, and slung our Yards, made
all tite and fast upon Deck; the Night prov'd
very dark, and the Wind blew a Storm about
Eight a Clock, and held till Ten, when we
thought it abated a little, but at Eleven it
<PB N="268" REF="283"/>
freshen'd again, and blew very hard; we rid it
out very well till Twelve, when we veer'd out
more Cable, and in about Half an Hour after,
the Wind encreasing, let go our Sheet Anchor;
by One a Clock it blew a dreadful Storm, and
though our Anchors held very well, the Sea
came over us in such a vast Quantity, that we
was every Hour in Danger of Foundring: About
Two a Clock the Sea fill'd our Boat as she lay
upon the Deck, and we was glad to let her go
over board for Fear of staving in our Decks: Our
Mate would then have cut our Mast by the
Board, but I was not willing, and told him, I
thought we had better slip our Cables, and go
out to Sea, he argued she was a deep Ship, and
would not live in the Sea, and was very eager
for cutting away the Mast; but I was loth to
part with my Mast, and could not tell where to
run for Shelter if I lost them.</P>
<P>About Three a Clock abundance of Ships
drove away, and came by us; some with all their
Masts gone, and foul of one another; in a sad
Condition my Men said they saw Two founder'd
together, but I was in the Cabin, and cannot
say I saw it. I saw a <HI>Russia</HI> Ship come foul of a
Collier, and both drove away together out of
our Sight, but I am told since the <HI>Russia</HI> Man
sunk by her Side.</P>
<P>In this Condition we rid till about Three a
Clock, the <HI>Russia</HI> Ships which lay a-head of me,
and the Men of War, who lay a-head of them,
fir'd their Guns for Help, but 'twas in vain to
expect it; the Sea went too high for any Boat
<PB N="269" REF="284"/>
to live. About Five, the Wind blew at that
prodigious Rate, that there was no Possibility
of riding it out, and all the Ships in the Road
seem'd to us to drive: Yet still our Anchors
held it, and I began to think we should ride it
out there, or founder; when a Ship's long Boat
came driving against us, and gave such a Shock
on the Bow that I thougbt it must have been a
Ship come foul of us, and expected to sink all at
once; our Men said there was some People in the
Boat, but as the Sea went so high no man dust
stand upon the Fore-castle, so no Body could be
sure of it; the Boat stav'd to pieces with the
Blow, and went away, some on One Side of us
and some on the other; but whether our Cable
receiv'd any Damage by it or not we cannot
tell, but our Sheet Cable gave Way immediate∣ly,
and as the other was not able to hold us a∣lone,
we immediately drove; we had then no
more to do, but to put afore the Wind,
which we did: it pleased God by this Time the
Tide of Ebb was begun, which something aba∣ted
the Height of the Sea, but still it went ex∣ceeding
high; we saw a great many Ships in the
same Condition with our selves, and expecting
every Moment to sink in the Sea. In this Ex∣tremity
we drove till Day light when we found
the Wind abated, and we stood in for the Shore,
and coming under the Lee of the <HI>Cliff</HI> near
<HI>Scarbro,</HI> we got so much Shelter, as that our
small Bower Anchors would ride us.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="285"/>
I can give you no Account but this; but sure
such a Tempest never was in the World. They
say here, that of Eighty Sail in <HI>Grimsby</HI> Road,
they can hear of but Sixteen; yet the rest are all
blown away, Here is about Twelve or Four∣teen
Sail of Ships come in to this Place, and
more are standing in for the Shore.</P>

<P>Abundance of other strange Deliverances have
been related, but with so small Authority as we

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor of this Book has labour'd un∣der
some Difficulties in this Account:
and one of the chief has been, how to avoid too
many Particulars, the Crowds of Relations which
he has been oblig'd to lay by to bring the Story
into a Compass tolerable to the Reader.</P>
<P>And tho' some of the Letters inserted are
written in a homely Stile, and exprest after the
Country Fashion from whence they came, the
Author chose to make them speak their own
Language, rather than by dressing them in other
Words make the Authors forget they were their
own.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="286"/>
We receiv'd a Letter, very particular, rela∣ting
to the Bishop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> and refle∣cting
upon his Lordship for some Words he
spoke, <HI>That he had rather have his Brains knock'd
out, than</HI> &amp;c. relating to his Inferiour Clergy.
The Gentleman takes the Disaster for a Judg∣ment
of God on him: But as in his Letter the
Person owns himself the Bishop's Enemy, fills
his Letter with some Reflexions indecent, at
least for us: and at last, tho' he dates from <HI>So∣merton,</HI>
yet baulks setting his Name to his Let∣ter:
for these Reasons we could not satisfie to
record the Matter, and leave a Charge on the
Name of that unfortunate Gentleman, which,
he being dead, could not answer, and we alive
could not prove. And on these Accounts hope
the Reverend Gentleman who sent the Letter
will excuse Us.</P>
<P>Also we have omitted, tho' our List of Parti∣culars
promis'd such a thing, An Account of
some unthinking Wretches, who pass'd over this
dreadful Judgment with Banter, Scoffing, and
Contempt. 'Tis a Subject ungrateful to recite,
and full of Horror to read; and we had much
rather cover such Actions with a general Blank
in Charity to the Offenders, and in hopes of their
Amendment.</P>
<P>One unhappy Accident I cannot omit, and
which is brought us from good Hands, and hap∣pen'd
in a Ship homeward bound from the <HI>West-Indies.</HI>
The Ship was in the utmost Danger of
Foundring; and when the Master saw all, as
he thought, lost, his Masts gone, the Ship leaky,
<PB N="272" REF="287"/>
and expecting her every moment to sink under
him, fill'd with Despair, he calls to him the
Surgeon of the Ship, and by a fatal Contract, as
soon made as hastily executed, they resolv'd to
prevent the Death they fear'd by one more cer∣tain;
and going into the Cabbin, they both
shot themselves with their Pistols. It pleas'd
God the Ship recover'd the Distress, was driven
safe into—and the Captain just liv'd to
see the desperate Course he took might have
been spar'd; the Surgeon died immediately.</P>
<P>There are several very remarkable Cases come
to our Hands since the finishing this Book, and
several have been promis'd which are not come
in; and the Book having been so long promis'd,
and so earnestly desir'd by several Gentlemen
that have already assisted that way, the Under∣takers
could not prevail with themselves to de∣lay
it any longer.</P>
