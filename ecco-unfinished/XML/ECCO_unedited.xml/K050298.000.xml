<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Jacobite CLUBS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>LUBS are a sort of <HI>Con∣venticles,</HI> wherein Men as∣semble together according to that agreement which is between their several Tem∣pers and Inclinations, and may properly be said to fall under the Pro∣tection of the Act of <HI>Toleration.</HI> But tho' this Act was made for the Benefit of such as are <HI>Scrupulous</HI> in their Conscience, and sepa∣rate themselves on account of a certain Ten∣derness of assenting to Principles which the Generality of the People entertain, and abide by, yet it never was intended to Counte∣nance any Persons whatsoever, in their De∣fection from Opinions that are almost uni∣versally receiv'd, and who have no manner of Grounds for their <HI>Scruples.</HI> The <HI>Creatures</HI> therefore, whose Atchievements I have taken upon me to give the Reader the Recital of, being
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
thus excluded from that Indulgence which the Law has granted to other Dissenters, 'tis to be hoped that it will be no Transgres∣sion of the Law, to drag them out of their unjustifiable Retirements, to uncase them of their pretended Zeal and Affection for the Wellfare and Tranquillity of their Country, and make known what they <HI>are,</HI> that they may no longer be taken for what they <HI>are not.</HI></P>
<P>These are the Miscreants, that are said in sacred Writ to cry <HI>Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace,</HI> and to these should be apply'd the Words of the Inspired Penman, WHAT PEACE, AS LONG AS THE WHORE∣DOMS OF YOUR MOTHER <HI>JEZE∣BEL,</HI> AND HER WITCHCRAFTS ARE SO MANY? <HI>As long as the re-establishment of Popery and Slavery is what you propose to your selves, by an end of the War, and you have nothing less in view, than the publick Tranquillity to arise from it?</HI> Not that they are harden'd into such an Effrontery of Im∣pudence, as yet, to dare openly avow these horrid and traiterous Conclusions, or have contracted such an Indolence of Apprehen∣sion, as not to skin over these Ulcerous Hopes and Expectations, with Films and Appearan∣ces of Loyalty to Her present Majesty: But since some among them, and those Men of no small Figure and Quality, have lately taken the Liberty, in Defyance of our Acts
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
of Settlement, to ridicule, and set at Nought the Anniversary of the next Protestant Suc∣cessor in one of the Publick Prints, without Impunity, it is highly to be feared, they will not only soon pull off their Disguise, but declare themselves in such a manner, as may be of the worst Consequence to the present Establishment, without it's timely Intervention in behalf of our Religion, Li∣berties, and Laws, without which we should be in the Condition of our Neighbours who are <HI>govern'd with Scorpions, and rul'd with Rods of Iron.</HI></P>
<P>To prevent this, Application should be made to those that sit at Helm, and have the Sterage of the Administration, which can be done after no better Manner than in Print, since it cannot be suppos'd that those Patri∣ots who are so diligent in their Enquiries after past Mismanagements and Abuses, will be anywise remiss in their Animadversions upon those that are Present, and of a few Days Growth. Tho', even this may be thought a Work of Super-Erogation, and justly enough, by such as have the same Deference for the present Ministry, as the Writer of this little Pamphlet declares him∣self to have, since the Peace that is now drawing to a Conclusion by their Means, provides for the Security of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Succession, by the <HI>French</HI> King's Recogni∣zing that wise Settlement in the <HI>Strongest</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<HI>Terms,</HI> and Banishing all Fears from the <HI>Pretender,</HI> in Removing him out of his Do∣minions. A Precaution sufficient of itself to discover the Weakness of their Intellects who give into the Expectation of new Schemes and Revolutions, and of Force e∣nough to put to Silence the Exaltations of a Party, <HI>who know not the Things that belong to their Peace,</HI> and, in all Probability, upon bringing the Treaty now on Foot to a Hap∣py Conclusion, will be far, very far, from finding their Account in it.</P>
<P>I am here to be understood, to speak of such Wretches only as are in the <HI>St. Ger∣mains</HI> Interest, and who, contrary to <HI>Oaths</HI> and <HI>Associations,</HI> to <HI>Protests</HI> and <HI>Abjurations,</HI> are in League, to Pray, Eat, and Drink, for the Prosperity of that Family, for I should do them Wrong to affirm any of them have Courage enough to Fight for it, since if they had, they would have long since been else∣where, and either number'd amongst the Dead, that lost their Lives ingloriously in Taking up Arms against their own Country, or among the poor Indigent Living, who comfort themselves with Starving (as they say) for Conscience sake, while that Con∣science of theirs permits them to go Hand in Hand, and join Hearts with a Religion contrary to the Faith they were Educated in.</P>
<P>Thus far by Way of Introduction, what
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
rests upon my Pursuit, is to give my Reader the Detail of Occurrences that come fresh into my Memory relating to the Clubs I stand engag'd to furnish him with. In Or∣der to this, I hold my self under a Necessity of Acquainting him, that tho' many Socie∣ties of this Nature were held long before the <HI>Peace,</HI> now upon the Anvil, was so much as thought of, insomuch as even to be ante∣cedent to the Proclamation of the War, which is now under a Cessation between us and the Common Enemy; yet, upon the Approach of this <HI>Visionary</HI> Blessing, (for I hope it will be no otherwise to the Persons I am treating of) the Malecontents, who en∣vied the late Harmony between Us and our Allies, and, without any Cause, gave in∣to the Belief that some Misunderstandings which had unhappily risen between them and us, would widen and increase upon our going into Measures without them, and to shew their Joy more, for what seem'd in their Opinion, and only their, (since the Court had other Sentiments) to be productive of another War, than their Contentment in the speedy Conclusion of the present, con∣sulted together how to try their Strength, and make an Estimate of the Number of People that were of the same Complection with themselves.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when their Friend <HI>Abel,</HI> who pretended to know more of the secret
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Springs of Affairs than those who Conducted them, and would be thought to be let into the most private Articles of the Negotiation, had given his <HI>Ipse dixit,</HI> that the Queen had ratify'd the Treaty between <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and was so particular, as to say that Mr. <HI>Thornborough,</HI> the Messenger, was order'd over with the Ratification to the <HI>French</HI> Court, and that the Peace was to be proclaim'd on the 25th of <HI>September,</HI> (a New Throne being provided in the House of Lords, for Her Majesty to declare the Terms of it to Her Parliament,) these <HI>Assem∣bly-Men,</HI> for they are more properly so cal∣led than the <HI>Whiggs,</HI> thought it high Time to exert themselves, and cheat the Govern∣ment into an Opinion of their Loyalty and Allegiance to their Sovereign, their Gra∣titude to the Ministry, and their Love to their Country. All Heads and Hands were at Work, for this Purpose, in every Quarter of the Town, but none signaliz'd themselves more than those who gave Notice in Print, of their Politick Designs to <HI>Eat</HI> and <HI>Drink</HI> upon this <HI>Glorious</HI> Occasion. These <HI>Mock-Patriots</HI> wisely foresaw, that Things of ill Consequence might fall out, should their Invitation be General, they therefore, at their several select Committees, clogg'd it with such and such Restrictions, lest an Ene∣my might be introduc'd under the Disguise of a Friend, and an Errant Well-Wisher to
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
the Reduction of <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>West-Indies</HI> to the <HI>Austrian</HI> Family, should be admitted in the Room of an honest <HI>Bourbonite.</HI> But none distinguish'd himself in a more extra∣ordinary Manner than the Sage, Casuistical, and Renowned <HI>Rubicundity-Tattle,</HI> Chairman to the <HI>Anti-Revolution Club</HI> in <HI>Ludgate-Street.</HI> A Man of Polemical Verbosity, that having run thro' all his Stock of Words (for Arguments he never had, or will have any) on the Side of the <HI>Whiggs,</HI> turn'd Tail, and for Talking sake, now discharges them without Fear or Wit, on the Part of the <HI>Tories:</HI> Not that he had no Retrospect to Preferment for so doing, since his best Friends must hold him an Enemy to <HI>Self-Denyal,</HI> by his late Accep∣tance of the Place of <HI>Scavinger</HI> to that Dung-Cart of Scandal call'd the <HI>Post-Boy:</HI> Tho' whether such an Office of Trust be Tenable with his Dignity of <HI>Chairman,</HI> or he must be Re-Elected, Time only, and the intended Session of the Society he is at the Head of, can only discover. Let that be as it will, notwithstanding he cannot strictly be call'd a Philosopher, Nature had done as much by him, towards making out the Truth of an Axiom in Philosophy, as any one Person whatsoever, and it appears by him that the <HI>Corruption of a good Thing is the Generation of a bad one.</HI> To come to the Business in Hand: This Incendiary, this Vehicle of Noise and Nonsense, this Master-Piece
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
of Defamation, in Conjunction with the rest of his Associates, to whom <HI>John Brazen,</HI> the Party's BULL-FINDER, who had got some very good Employments by Dint of Forehead, and for Want of Im∣pudence cannot lose them, and Gentle <HI>George</HI> the Linguist, whose Abilities are seen three Times a Week in the Translation of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Prints, came to this Resolution, That the Tickets for the Festival ensuing should be given out at Five Shillings each; and that every Purchaser might be throughly known to be of the same Stamp with them∣selves, this Proviso was made, <HI>That no one should be admitted, that had not the Attesta∣tions of Two or more Persons belonging to the Society, of his being Tooth and Nail for Inde∣feasible and Hereditary Right, i. e.</HI> For the Exclusion of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Line, and Drink∣ing the Healths of the Day, amongst which was to be that of their Idol the <HI>P—der.</HI> The next Thing they had to do, was to consult about a Bill of Fare, towards the making of which, some Booksellers, in and near <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s Church-Yard, that had treat∣ed Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> and others of the Clergy at <HI>Truby</HI>'s, were call'd in, who gave it as their Opinion, that, in Opposition to the <HI>Calves-Head</HI> Feast, a certain Number of <HI>Boars-Heads</HI> should be Roasted, and serv'd up as Part of the Entertainment, in Con∣tempt of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who were then said not
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
to Concur in the Peace they had so near a Prospect of. Dr. <HI>S—t</HI> was likewise to be borrow'd from his Attendance at <HI>Y—</HI>Build∣ings, to give a Blessing to this pious Act of Thanksgiving, and desir'd to compose a New-Grace before Meat, for the Members of this Society are wont to receive Benefits without giving Thanks for them, which was <HI>ready cut and dry'd</HI> like <HI>Sacheverell</HI>'s Ser∣mon in <HI>Bisset</HI>'s Pamphlet, and run in Verse as follows;</P>

<L>O Lord of—look upon</L>

<L>We had not on these Dainties fed:</L>

<L>Pray to no other Lord but Thee.</L>
<L>First, <HI>We beseech thee that these Dishes,</HI></L>
<L>Freighted with Pasties, Fowls, and Fishes,</L>

<L>Lest that, when their Accounts are stated,</L>
<L>They happen to be decollated.</L>
<L>Thirdly, and lastly, <HI>we entreat,</HI></L>
<L>Before we grasp our Knives and Eat,</L>
<L><HI>May this same</HI> Peace <HI>which Thou hast giv'n us,</HI></L>
<L>O'er to thy Measures further win us,</L>

</LG>
<P>As the Close of the last Distych may seem to want Explanation, for such as are not con∣versant enough with the Character of this Chaplain of the <HI>Boar's-Head-Feast,</HI> it will not be foreign to my Design to clear up the Meaning of it, by saying, That when the Earl of <HI>Wharton</HI> went Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> this grateful Clergyman, by his Birth and <HI>alert</HI> Behaviour, gain'd Admission into his Lordship's Family, where he was receiv'd with extraordinary Marks of Esteem; insomuch that he grew the Envy of Men of much more Merit than himself, whose Birth nor Quality could entitle them to such Caresses. But after he had in vain Sonetted my Lord, and found it Impossible to Rhime him or my Lady into a <HI>Conge de Elire</HI> for an <HI>Irish</HI> Bishoprick, after he had ridicul'd his sacred Office, by Writing the most abominable Fustian in Prose and Verse, and descended so low as to play at <HI>Crambo</HI> with, and petition in <HI>Doggrel</HI> for my Lady's Women, he assum'd the Spirit of Indigna∣tion,
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
and maugre all his Obligations to that Noble Family, and his Engagements in Point of Honour and Conscience, turn'd Renegado, unsaid what he had before given out in Print in their Behalf, and like his own <HI>Jack</HI> and <HI>Martin,</HI> in his Celebrated <HI>Tale of a Tub</HI> that inveigh'd against <HI>Peter</HI> for all his kind Offices to them, turn'd <HI>Grumble∣tonian,</HI> and from that Day forward commenc'd <HI>Malecontent</HI> to his Lordship only, till he was found to be a Fool fit for some Body else his Purpose. And then he had Money put in his Pocket, Promises of Ecclesiastical Preferments, and what not, made him to write against the Party that Noble Peer bravely espous'd; which he has very stre∣nuously done, as far as the most flagrant Un∣truths, and the most inveterate Rancour of a poison'd and inflam'd Pen could direct him.</P>
<P>This is a <HI>Digression</HI> which he will scarce ever write in <HI>Praise of,</HI> as he has done in the Book abovemention'd. To return there∣fore to the Place where I left off, and carry on the Thread of my Narration with that Regularity that becomes a Subject of this Importance: The Chairman, <HI>Rubicundo,</HI> had no sooner got possess'd of this Poetical Per∣formance, but he valued himself highly upon being at the Head of a Society whose Wit and Humour did no ways fall short of their Religion and Loyalty, and who, after ma∣king their Belly their God, had made one
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
that had no Right to the Succession, their King. Wherefore, having walk'd from Ta∣ble to Table at <HI>Sam</HI>'s to try the Goodness of his Lungs, and find Room with the <HI>City-Carpenter</HI> to Elbow in Invectives against the Late Ministry, put the Instrument-Maker in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-Yard out of Tune, and quite sour'd the <HI>Newgate-Market</HI> Cheese-Monger: He at last cast his Eye upon a lit∣tle squab <HI>Sham-Doctor,</HI> by whose Means, over a Pint of Wine, he furnish'd himself with <HI>Arguments</HI> in Defence of Hereditary Indefeasible Right, and who, for the sake of being admitted <HI>Gratis</HI> on the Day of Rejoy∣cing, equipp'd him with Materials for a Set-Speech upon that laudable Occasion. This Oration, had it come to Hand as well as the Grace before Meat, would undoubted∣ly have been very diverting, since it was Pen'd down by so Rhetorical a Speech-Ma∣ker, and Revis'd by so Learn'd an Assistant: But since the Publick has the Misfortune to be robb'd of it, by Reason of <HI>Rubicundo</HI>'s great Modesty, or his greater Prudence in not letting it see the Light, till it has un∣derwent the same Corrections as his Friend <HI>Abel</HI>'s Compositions; which the tall Gentle∣man at <HI>Scotland Yard</HI> Daily licks over: I shall stay the Reader's Appetite for a Sight of it, by a Copy of their Orders which luckily came to Hand by a mere Accident.</P>

<P>But, as <HI>many Things happen between the Cup and the Lip,</HI> and it is not in the Power of Humanity to prevent Accidents, so the Preparations they had made for the Solem∣nization of this Festival thro' the Interven∣tion of Fortune, who makes Sport with all Sublunary Affairs, and diverts herself with the Disappointments of such as depend upon her Smiles (as most of this Club did) turn'd to very little Account: For it seems they were out in their Calculation, and whatso∣ever Profession their Oracle, the <HI>Post-Boy,</HI> made, of being conversant with Intriegues of State, both he and his Agents had the Mortification to find them less acquainted with what was in Agitation among the Great Men Above, than they would have been taken to be; and the necessary Time
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
that was to be taken up in Assembling the Cortes of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Parliaments of <HI>France,</HI> to their Alternative Renunciations of the Union of those Two Crowns upon one and the same Head, put back the Pro∣clamation of Peace for some Time longer, so that it was but running to the several Pla∣ces where those Festivals were to be held, and you had all Manner of Provisions at half Prices, and might have as good Penny∣worths for your Money as at a certain House in <HI>Broad-Street,</HI> where, not long since, seve∣ral Sort of Knick Knacks were to have been Sold by a Set of Projectors, for much less than the first Purchase.</P>
<P>Alas and well-a-day for the poor dispiri∣ted <HI>Jacks!</HI> Not one among them but hung his Head like a Bull-Rush, and shrunk in his Horns like a Snail in cold Weather. <HI>Sam</HI>'s Coffee-House, upon their being baulk'd of their Peace, enjoy'd a perfect Tranquilli∣ty, and an honest <HI>Whigg</HI> was at Liberty to drink off his Dish quietly, without being hunted down with Noise and Clamour by the Chairman <HI>Rubicundity,</HI> or the <HI>City-Carpenter,</HI> who shot the Pit for some Time, till they recover'd their antient Assurance. Nor did the <HI>Whiggs,</HI> howsoever Discourag'd and Brow-beaten, fail of laying hold of this Opportunity to repay the <HI>Tories</HI> in their own Coin: For one of them who set up as an Advocate for the rest, and was very deep∣ly

Wherefore, I be∣took myself to the Duke of <HI>Bedford</HI>'s Head, hard by, where ruminating upon the Ad∣venture I had met with, I fell into a serious Meditation upon the Weakness of such Men of Birth and Quality, as by the Profuseness of their Living, and their unaccountable Extravagance, swell these <HI>Madams Coming-Sir</HI> into an Imposthumation of Pride and Greatness beyond their due Proportion: From thence I made a further Search into the deprav'd Understandings of some Illustrious Personages who suffer themselves to be drawn aside into an Opinion, that there is no Me∣dium between Joy and Madness, and that the Excess of Admiration is not the direct Road to Stupidity. Is it possible, thought I, that the best Blood in the Kingdom should so far forget the Channels from whence it flows, as to associate itself with the dirty Puddle that spreads its Filth from a Re∣tainer to a Gaming Table? Or shall the Captain of a Band of Thieves, call'd <HI>Bailiffs,</HI> be admitted as a Companion, or rather as a Director to them that preside over Gentle∣men?

the greatest and most important Services, not be asham'd of being seen with one who is under no Tyes of Service to any one but himself, and whose Business it is to Fish in troubled Waters? But whatsoever Horrour fill'd my Soul at the Apprehension of such a degenerate Procedure, I found it of no Use to my self, or them, to dwell upon Expostu∣lations, since the noble Gudgeons had taken the Hook which was baited for them; and it was in vain for me to blush for them, who would not give themselves Time to reflect, and be <HI>asham'd</HI> of being led by the Nose by a Man who knows not how to <HI>blush</HI> for him∣self, amidst all the Reasons he is encompass'd with for so doing. Therefore I only Copied out a List of the several Members of the abovemention'd Society, whereof the most noble Don <HI>Henrico de novo Forresto</HI> was Chairman, and after Transcribing the Health of the Day, which was written by that in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efatigable Pains-Taker, in Wine and Metre, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. <HI>Y-l-n,</HI> set forward towards <HI>Charing∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ross</HI> and <HI>St. James</HI>'s to get fresh Materials or this little Diatry, but found them all of Piece, and of the same Nature with those have been already particular in.</P>

<P>Having done with my short Account of Clubs, my Time, perhaps, will not be ill spent, at least I shall not think it so, to rea∣son a little with those that frequent them, who have all, or most of them, sworn to the present Government, and abjur'd the <HI>Preten∣der;</HI> and shew them their Mistakes in thinking that either the Peace now on Foot can pro∣mote the Interest of that abandant Claimant of the Throne, or that the Proceedings of the Present Ministry bear any Tendency to∣wards the Advancement of that Interest. In the first Place then, the Peace I am now speaking of (if these senseless People have either Manners or Understanding enough to give Credit to what the Queen has been graciously pleas'd to tell them, in her Speech to both Houses of Parliament, That the <HI>French</HI> King has engag'd his Royal Word, not only to acknowledge the Succession of the House of <HI>Hanover</HI> in the strongest Terms, but remove the Person who pretends to the Sovereignty of these Realms out of his Dominions) is so far from giving Grounds to the <HI>Jacobites</HI> Hopes, that it wholly extinguishes them. Wherefore those who are now propagating the Cause
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> place their Hopes no more in Foreign Power. They have, and with good Reason too, given over expecting that Phantome by the Sword of <HI>France.</HI> They have the same Experience of <HI>French</HI> Steadi∣ness, that we all say, we have in other Ca∣ses. They find he will do by them as he did by King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d, whom he Complimented out of his Kingdom, in Defe∣rence to <HI>Oliver Cromwell;</HI> and as he did by King <HI>James</HI> the 2d, whose Interest he gave up in Complyance to King <HI>William;</HI> and now does the like by the Person whom he abandons, to make his Peace with the Queen. They find the King of <HI>France</HI> may be beaten into any Thing, and indeed he has done enough, unless they would have him lose his Kingdom for them. They see then, that Force is not the Way to do this Work, and that if the People of <HI>Britain</HI> preserve their Integrity, they can never hope to come in, no, tho' the Power of <HI>France</HI> were with them. Finding this, I say, by long Expe∣rience, the wisest Heads among them (for those are but insignificant Tools that form themselves openly into Clubs, and under their Agency) have long ago taken new Mea∣sures, and fallen to Work with all the Arts and Jesuitical Subtilty, of their Party and Interest, to bring the People of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> to do this great Work themselves.
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
It is insinuated to them, especially since some little Misunderstandings between that Court and ours, relating to the Conduct in the last Campaign, that the M—y take Measures opposite to the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession, and the People are told strange Stories every Day, How fine a Gentleman the <HI>Pretender</HI> is, how Sweet a Disposition he is of, how Comely a Person, how Brave in the Field, how Affectionate to his Friends, how Ge∣nerous to his Enemies: How his Illegiti∣macy was never made out: How King <HI>William</HI> promis'd to prove it, but never did: That he is certainly King <HI>James</HI>'s Lawful Son, and that his Right is indisputable, how∣ever the unfortunate Conduct of his Father ruin'd him: That he was bred up a <HI>Papist,</HI> indeed, because his Father would have him Educated in that Religion, but that he is now a <HI>Protestant,</HI> and has declar'd himself such by taking a Divine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> for the Director of his Conscience, has discharg'd his <HI>Popish</HI> Servants, and as soon as he arrives here, will make a publick Renunciation of his former Errors. This back'd with the Article of the Ministry be∣ing of his Side, the Ministry who has done such great Things for them, deliver'd them from Plunderers, and State Robbers, put them in a Way to pay the National Debts, without any Burthen to the Subject, and are Procuring them the Blessings of a long wish'd
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
for Peace, is a Method that prevails but too much among the Common People, tho' it is far from being rational to suggest, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> is in the View of the Ministry. Be∣cause the Ministry enjoy more now, than ever they can be suppos'd to expect under the Reign of any Successor, and they know it; and Men who know their Interest sel∣dom Act against it.</P>
<P>To say our Ministry aim at the <HI>Preten∣der,</HI> is to say, they aim at Pulling themselves down; for as much as the Tyranny of a <HI>Tory</HI> Ministry is Threatening, the Tyranny of a <HI>Popish</HI> Pretender is quite another Thing; and I cannot believe our Ministry so bereav'd of Understanding, as not to know that the Tools of a <HI>Popish Reign</HI> would as certainly introduce new Favourites, new Management, a new Ministry, as ever this Ministry sup∣planted the Old; and no Benefaction can oblige them to such a Degree, as to secure it: And these are my Reasons why I cannot believe that the Present Ministry design to bring in the <HI>Pretender.</HI> Besides, they are too cautious, and Masters of too great a Fore∣fight to attempt Impossibilities, I mean such Things as cannot be brought to pass by any Appearance of Law and Constitution Right. I am indeed well aware of a Notion many People entertain, that the compleat Repre∣sentative of the Nation have all the Power that is possible to be vested in any Body of
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
Men vested in them, and that they can do all Things that a Parliament ever could do, but this is a great Mistake.</P>
<P>Nothing is more plain, than that the Par∣liament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is not vested with all the Power that the Two Parliaments of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> respectively enjoy'd. Those Parliaments had all the Power that it was possible for a Parliament to have; and this has not; <HI>for Example,</HI> The Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is limited by the Articles by which it is Constituted: These Articles, those Parliaments had Power to make, this had not Power to make them, for it had not then a Being; neither can this Parliament act beyond those Articles, but is limited and prescrib'd by them.</P>
<P>It has been said, indeed, That the <HI>British</HI> Parliament can dissolve those Articles: <HI>I de∣ny that;</HI> if the <HI>British</HI> Parliament should now declare the Union dissolved, and the Articles of it void, yet would not that Union be Le∣gally Dissolved, nor the Articles of it void, for nothing can destroy what it did not make. It is true, that by Declaring the Union dis∣solv'd, it would become <HI>Felo de se,</HI> and de∣story its own Being as a Parliament: It is in any Man's Power to destroy himself, but he has not a Right to do it: There is a great Distinction to be made between Power and Right. Upon this Foot I say, it is impossi∣ble to alter the present Constitution, of which
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
the <HI>Protestant</HI> Succession is now made a Part, because the <HI>British</HI> Parliament cannot alter the Union: When I say CANNOT, and <HI>Impossible,</HI> &amp;c. I am to be understood <HI>cannot</HI> LEGALLY, and <HI>impossible,</HI> LEGALLY: For the Parliament may justly be said to be unable to do what they cannot Legally do; so that the Meaning is, they cannot do it, without Trampling under Foot the <HI>Consti∣tution</HI> and the <HI>Law,</HI> which is the Founda∣tion of their very Being, and I will never charge a Parliament with doing this, till I see it in their profess'd Resolutions; much less a Ministry, with intending it to be done, who are liable to fall under the Cognizance of a Parliament for such a Design. For I would fain know on what Foundation do the Ministry stand, but on that of the <HI>Pro∣testant Succession:</HI> I look upon it Originally to be a Plot of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> upon the <HI>Mi∣nistry,</HI> and upon the Nation too, to suggest those that sit at the Helm of the Administra∣tion are for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> either to gain upon the Populace by the Prevalence of their Example, or to Arm the People against them, on a Supposition of their being Guilty, and then force them to fall in with the <HI>Preten∣der.</HI> But <HI>it will not do.</HI> When <HI>this Mini∣stry</HI> declares for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> they must ei∣ther be driven to some inextricable Laby∣rinth in their Affairs, or be forsaken of God and their Understanding; since it is evident
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
the Ministry can have no Prospect of their own Settlement but in <HI>Peace,</HI> which must exclude the Hopes of the <HI>Pretender.</HI> The Universal Quiet of their Affairs, is the Se∣curity of their Standing, and the Steps which they have taken to put an End to the War Abroad, testify that they are con∣vinced of this Truth.</P>
<P>Now, since it is evident, that the <HI>Preten∣der</HI> is foreclosed by Law; not the Queen, not the Parliament, less the Ministry, least of all the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, can Repeal or make Void that Foreclosure: By Law we are Empower'd to defend it if Attack'd by Violence: <HI>Where then,</HI> Starts up an An∣tagonist and says, <HI>is our Danger?</HI> I answer, We are in no Visible Danger, but in the subtle Party deluding the People to act against themselves, and to Imbibe <HI>Anti-Hanoverian</HI> Principles to discover Indiffe∣rencies to one, and Aversions to another, and so to weaken those Hands which may be at last wanting to resist Illegal Violences and Usurpations. Then may we be ruin'd by our own Hands, and the Succession blindly ruind by those who should defend it: And for this Reason, it is every Honest Mans Duty to prevent the Common People being impos'd upon, I mean such, all such as are in subordinate Stations, and keep off a Blow that Threatens us from another
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
Quarter than from the Peace or the Ministry.</P>
<P>To you then, good People, who are amus'd about the <HI>Pretender,</HI> when they cant about his Illegitimacy not being prov'd; when the Persons who resort to the <HI>Clubs</HI> I have been speaking of, tell you of his being turn'd Protestant; when you hear of the Justice in your Neighbourhood, that drinks his Health; the Parson that Toasts him under borrow'd Names and by Innu∣endo prays for him; the Soldier that wishes him Success with a great Oath that makes as much Noise as a Bomb, do your selves the Kindness but to ask those Gentlemen this Question, <HI>Pray Sirs have you not Abjured him?</HI> If they say no. Enquire how He came to be in the Commission; He a Soldier in the Army, or he a Minister in the Parish. And if they have Abjured him, ask them how they can talk of his Legita∣macy, drink his Health, pray for him, and the like.</P>
<P>Was ever poor deluded Nation so Re∣ligiously mock'd as this? What do these People think of Oaths? Alas, an <HI>Abju∣ration</HI> is a quite different Thing from an Oath of <HI>Allegiance.</HI> When you Swear TO a Prince, it is one Thing, and that Oath has been, and may be, determin'd
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
to be of no Force, when that Prince can no longer possess the Sovereignty: But to Swear against a Prince, is quite another Thing. There you promise peaceable Behaviour, and it is accepted in the usual Manner: But here you call God to Witness, that you never will sub∣mit to him, and that he has no manner of Right to demand it. From whence I argue, That although Allegiance may be transpos'd from one Prince to another, as Countries and Cities change Masters, which is frequent in the Case of Towns being Taken and Re-taken in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the Inhabitants always take an Oath to the Possessor. Yet when once a Nation Swears and calls God to Witness, that they will never submit to, or consent to be Govern'd by such or such a Prince, such an Oath can never be dispens'd with, no, not the <HI>Pope</HI> himself can absolve from it, but that Na∣tion stands convicted of the worst Sort of Per∣jury, nor can any Argument be brought to Pailiate or Excuse it.</P>
<P>Now let our People but consider, this Person we call the <HI>Pretender,</HI> is the very same we have all, except an Inconsiderable Number of Worthless Creatures, Abjur'd; You have lifted up your Hands to God, and Sworn by him that <HI>Liveth for</HI> ever, that this very Man shall never <HI>Reign over you,</HI> How will you come off of this Oath▪ It is not a Common Oath of Allegiance that Ends with any National Revolution; no, it is a Solemn Renouncing of your Allegiance to him for ever, and calling God to Witness against your Perjury, if ever you Submit to his Obedience.</P>
<P>Not all the Devils in <HI>Hell,</HI> nor all the Jesuits on Earth, can contrive a Shift for you to get of
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
from this Oath; not the Cunningest Sophister under Heaven can bring you out of it. You cannot say it was a Force upon you, for you swear in it you do it <HI>freely,</HI> Voluntarily, and of your <HI>own Choice:</HI> You cannot pretend the Death of the Queen quits you of it, for it is not an Oath to Her, but <HI>against him:</HI> Nothing can absolve you from it, there is not one Hole to Creep out at, no∣thing to vacate the Obligation, unless you will all turn Papists, get the Pope to Absolve you, and Di∣spence with it.</P>
<P>Thus National Perjury is the first thing that must attend your bringing in the <HI>Pretender:</HI> National Apostacy is the next, for the <HI>Pretender</HI> and <HI>Popery</HI> are the same. They say, indeed, that he is turn'd <HI>Pro∣testant:</HI> Pray, why then are all the <HI>Papists</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> for the bringing him in? Do you think they would side with an Apostate? For such they must account him to be: Would they be for one that should forsake their Church, and revolt to Heresie? They would as soon take Part with a Jew as such a King—But they know well enough what such a Conversion means, what it signifies, and how far it will extend.</P>
<P>Wherefore, good People, depend upon this, that to receive the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and to receive <HI>Popery,</HI> is the very same thing, and no appearing Change in the Person can give Satisfaction in that Parti∣cular.</P>
<P>National Dishonour comes in the Third Place, the Shame of a Blinded infatuated People, a Na∣tion that may be drawn into a Snare before your Face; Will ye be called Fools first, and then made Fools? This is to be more Sottish than the Fowls of the Air: The Text, says of them, <HI>Surely in vain is the Net spread in the Sight of any Bird:</HI> But this
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
Net is spread in your sight, and yet you run Head∣long into it.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Why all this yielded to a baffled, de¦feated Enemy, that has tryed 24 Years to beat you into it, and cannot do it? An Enemy you have brought so low, that some say, it is not safe to let him be brought any lower; and will you let him Master you thus? Has he Fought so many Years to bring in the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and been lustily thrash'd for his Pains, and shall he Wheedle you in at last by his Agents to do it your selves? This would be very hard, but if you will not Hear, if you will not Look about you, but be Deaf to all manner of Exhortation, the Pope's Bene∣diction is the properest for you; <HI>Si Populus vult decipi decipiatur,</HI> if the Nation will be gull'd into irretrievable Mistakes, let it be so. <HI>Liberavi Animam meam,</HI> I have done my Duty; and at your Doors the Fault will lie, for not doing yours.</P>
