Mr. DAHL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FInding Encouragement for a Sixth
Edition of the <HI>Ladies Travels,</HI>
as I had just Reason from your
Merits before, todedicate a part of them
to you, so the Continuation of your
particular Favours makes me take this
Opportunity to acknowledge them, and
now to Address the Whole. I found
the former Editions to have good Suc∣cess
under your Name; so that both
Profit and Gratitude oblige me again
to beg you to take this Work of the
Fair Sex into your further Protection
and Patronage. Your Great Skill in
that Excellent Art, which with so much
Life and Pleasure represents the La∣dies,
besides your other extraordinary
<PB REF="3"/>
Qualifications, endears you to them,
and I hope will influence them to help
me off with this Impression. They
will certainly for the Honour of their
Sex, contribute to let this Incompara∣ble
Lady's Productions have a more
extensive Spread and Acquaintance.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, and give me leave
to conclude with my humble Thanks
for all your Civilities and Kindnesses,
and my hearty Wishes for your Pro∣sperity.
I am,</P>

Your most Obliged humble Servant,

<HEAD>A
RELATION
OF A
Voyage to SPAIN,
IN
Several Letters.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>SEEING you are so earnest with me to let you know
all my Adventures, and whatsoever I have observed du∣ring
my Travels, you must therefore be contented (my
dear Cousen) to bear with a great many trifling Occur∣rences,
before you can meet with what will please you: I
know your fancy is so nice and delicate, that none but ex∣traordinary
Accidents can entertain you; and I wish I had no
others to relate: but recounting things faithfully, as they have
happened, you must be contented therewith.</P>
<P>I gave you an Account in my last, of what I met with
as far as <HI>Bayonne;</HI> you know this is a Town in <HI>France,</HI> Fron∣tier
to <HI>Spain,</HI> washed by the Rivers <HI>Dadour</HI> and <HI>Nivelle,</HI>
which joyn together, and the Sea comes up to them. The
Port and Trade are considerable: I came from <HI>Axe</HI> by Water,
and observed that the Boat-men of <HI>Adour</HI> have the same Custom
as those of <HI>Carrone;</HI> which is to say, That in passing by one
another, they set up a Hollowing; and they had rather lose
their Wages than to forbear these sort of shoutings, although
exceeding vexatious to those who are not used to them. There
are two Castles strong enough to defend the Town, and there
are about it several pleasant Walks.</P>
<P>At my Arrival there, I intreated the Baron <HI>de Castlenau,</HI> who
had accompanyed me from <HI>Axe,</HI> to bring me acquainted with
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
some Women, with whom I might spend my time with less
impatience till the Litters came, which were to be sent to me
from St. <HI>Sebastian.</HI></P>
<P>He readily complied with my Request: for being a Person of
Quality and Worth, he is much esteemed at <HI>Bayonne.</HI> He fail'd
not the next Morning to bring several Ladies to visit me.</P>
<P>These Women begin here to feel the Scorching Heats of the
Sun; their Complexion is dark, their Eye sparkling; they
are charming enough, their Wits are sharp: And I could give
you a farther Account of their Capacities, could I have better
understood what they said: not but that they could all speak
<HI>French,</HI> yet with such a different Dialect, as surpast my Under∣standing.</P>
<P>Some who came to see me, brought little sucking Pigs under
their Arms, as we do little Dogs: its true they were very
spruce, and several of them had Collars of Ribbons, of various
Colours: However, this Custom looks very odd, and I cannot
but think that several amongst themselves are disgusted at it▪
When they danced, they must set them down, and let these
grunting Animals run about the Chamber, where they made a
very pleasant Harmony. These Ladies danced at my Intreaty,
the Baron of <HI>Castleneau</HI> having sent for Pipes and Tabors.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who attended the Ladies, took each of 'em
her whom he had brought with him, and the Dance began in a
Round, all holding Hands: they had afterwards long Canes
brought them, and then each Spark taking hold of the Ladies
Handkerchief, which separated them from one another, moved
very gracefully at the Sound of this Martial sort of Musick, which
inspired them with such Heat that they seem'd not to be able
to moderate it. This seemed to me to resemble the <HI>Pyrric</HI>
Dance so much celebrated by the Ancients; for these Gentle∣men
and Ladies made so many Turns, Frisks and Capers, their
Canes being thrown up into the Air, and dextrously caught
again, that it is impossible to describe their Art and Agility:
And I had a great deal of Pleasure in seeing 'em, but methoughts
it lasted too long, and I began to grow weary of this ill ordered
Ball: When the Baron <HI>de Castleneau,</HI> who perceived it, caused se∣veral
Baskets of dried Fruit to be brought in. They are the <HI>Jews</HI>
who past for <HI>Portugueses,</HI> and dwell at <HI>Bayonne,</HI> who transport
them from <HI>Genoa,</HI> and furnish all the Country with them. We
wanted not for <HI>Limonade,</HI> and other refreshing Waters, of which
these Ladies drank heartily; and so the Entertainment ended.</P>
<P>I was carry'd the next Morning to see the Synagogue of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> in the Suburb of the Holy Spirit, but met with nothing
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
remarkable there. Monsieur <HI>de St. Pe,</HI> the Kings Lieutenant,
who came to see me, though much troubled with the Gout,
invited me to Dine at his House, where I was most deliciously
entertained; for this is a Country abounding with good Cheer,
and at cheap Rates. I found here Women of Quality, that
were very handsome, whom he had invited to bear me Compa∣ny.
The sight of the Castle, which faces the River, is very
pleasant, and has always a good Garrison in it.</P>
<P>At my return to my Lodging, I was surpriz'd to find several
Pieces of Linnen, which were brought to me from the Ladies
who came to see me, with Baskets full of dried Sweet-meats.
This Treatment seem'd to me very obliging, to a Lady whom
they had not known above four or five Days. But I must not
forget to tell you, there is not any finer Linnen in the World
than that which is made in this Country, some of which is
open like Net-work, and the Threads of it finer than Hair:
And I remember, that travelling thro' the Villages of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI>
which may be rather call'd Desarts, the poor Peasants living so
wretchedly; yet I found among them as neat Napkins as those
used amongst People of Quality at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I sailed not to send these Ladies such little Presents which I
thought might please them: I perceiv'd they were great Ad∣mirers
of Ribbons, and wear a great many on their Heads and
Ears, which made me send them a great many; to which I ad∣ded
several Fans: and they, by way of Return, presented me
with Gloves, and Thread-Stockings, most delicately knit.</P>
<P>In sending them to me, they desired me to go to the next
Chappel, which was not far from my Quarters, where they in∣tended
to Regale me with the best Musick the Town would af∣ford:
but though they were very good Voices, yet there is no
great pleasure in hearing them, because they want both Air
and Skill.</P>
<P>The Litters which I expected from <HI>Spain</HI> being come, I
prepared for my Departure; but I never met any thing dearer
than these sort of Equipages; for each Litter has a Master that
accompanies it, who keeps the Gravity of a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator,
being mounted on a Mule, and his man on another, with
which they release ever and anon those that carry the Litter.
I had two, I took the greatest for my self and my Child, and
had besides four Mules for my Servants, and two others for my
Biggage; to conduct them, there were other two Masters and
two Men. You see what Charge one is at, to go to <HI>Madrid,</HI>
seeing you must pay not only for their Attendance on you for∣wards,
but the same Price for their return back: However,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
we must submit to their Customs, and suffer our selves to be
peeled by them.</P>
<P>I found at <HI>Bayonne</HI> several <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> and I think a
worse sort of People, and these are Custom-House-Men: I had
caused my Trunks to be weighed at <HI>Paris,</HI> that I might have
the less to do with these sort of People, but they were more
subtle, or to speak better, more obsinate than I, so that I was
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rced to give them whatsoever they demanded. Scarcely
was I got clear from a them, when the Drums, Trumpets, Pipes,
and Violins of the Town, came thundring upon me, they fol∣lowed
me farther than St. <HI>Anthony's</HI> Gate, through which you pass
for <HI>Spain</HI> through <HI>Biscay:</HI> they p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayed each of them in their
way, and all together without any Harmony, which was e∣nough
to drive any one out of their Senses: I ordered some
M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ney to be given them, upon which they lef<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> persecuting me.
As soon as we had left <HI>Bayonne,</HI> we entered into a large bar∣ren
Heath, where we saw nothing but Chesnut-Trees; but we
afterwards past along by the Sea, whose Sand makes a delight∣ful
way, and a pleasant Prospect.</P>
<P>We arrived in good time at St. <HI>John de Lut:</HI> nothing can be
pleasanter than this Borough, which is the greatest in <HI>France,</HI>
and the best builts there are several smaller Cities: its Port
lies between two Mountains, which Nature seems to have ex∣presly
placed to defend it from Storm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: the River <HI>Nivelle</HI> dis∣gorges
it self therein; the Sea comes up very high in it, and
the greatest Barks come up commodiously to the Key. The
Seamen here are very skilful at catching Whales, and other
large Fish. We were here very well entertained, so that our
Tables were covered with all sorts of Wild Fowl, but our
Beds were not answerable, being stuck with Feathers whose
Piniou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ran into our sides, and we wanted Qui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts to lay on the
top of them: I thought when we were to pay, that I should
have had a large Reckoning, but they only demanded of me
half a <HI>Lewis Dor,</HI> when they would have cost more than five
Pistoles at <HI>Paris.</HI> The Situation of St. <HI>John de Luz</HI> is extream∣ly
agreeable.</P>
<P>In the most spacious part of the Town you see here a very
fine Church, built after the Modern Fashion, and here is a
Passage over the River <HI>Nivelle,</HI> on a Wooden Bridge of great
length. Here are Toll-Gatherers, who make you pay for eve∣ry
thing you carry with you, not excepting your Cloaths:
This Tax is demanded at their Pleasure, and it is excessive on
Strangers. I was weary with speaking <HI>French</HI> to them, and pro∣testing
I was no <HI>Spaniard;</HI> they feigning not to understand
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
me, sneering in my Face, and wrapping up their Heads in
their Hooded-Gowns, they seemed to me to be Thieves, dis∣guised
in <HI>Capuchins.</HI> In short, they taxed me eighteen Crowns,
and would perswade me they used me well, tho' I found the
contrary. But I have already told you (dear Cousen,) that
when you travel this Country you must stock your self with
Patience, and good store of Money.</P>
<P>I saw the Castle of <HI>Artois,</HI> which seems a strong place, and
a little farther <HI>Orognes,</HI> where the <HI>Biscay</HI> is spoken, without
either <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spanish.</HI> I designed to lye at <HI>Iron,</HI> which is
but three Leagues distant from St. <HI>John de Lut,</HI> and I had set out
that after Noon, but the Dispute which we had with the Watch
on the Bridge, the Difficulty we had in passing the Mountains
of <HI>Beotia,</HI> and the ill Weather, joyned to other little Difficul∣ties
which hapned, were the Cause that it was Night before we
arrived on the Borders of the River <HI>Bidassoa,</HI> which separates
<HI>France</HI> from <HI>Spain.</HI> I observed along the way from <HI>Bayonne</HI> thi∣ther,
little Carriages, on which they transport every thing,
which having only two Iron Wheels, and the Noise they make
is so great, that they are heard a Mile off, when they are ma∣ny
of them together, which often happen, for you often meet
with Sixty or Seventy at a time, they are drawn by Oxen.
I have seen the same in the Villages of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and especi∣ally
on the side of <HI>Axe.</HI></P>
<P>The River of <HI>Bidassoa</HI> is usually very small, but the Snows
melting, had increased it to such a degree, that we had no
small trouble to pass it, some in a Boat, and others swimming
on their Mules: The Moon shined very bright, by means of
which I was shewed on the right Hand <HI>the Isle of Conference,</HI>
where the Marriage of our King was made with <HI>Maria Therese,
Infanta of Spain.</HI> I saw a while after the Fort of <HI>Fontarabia,</HI>
which belongs to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> standing on the Mouth of
this small River, the Flux and Reflux of the Sea arrives here.
Our Kings heretofore pretended it belonged to them, there
have been such great Contests hereupon, especially by the
Inhabitants of <HI>Fontarabia,</HI> and those of <HI>Andaye,</HI> that they have
several times come to Blows. This obliged <HI>Lewis</HI> the Twelfth,
and <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> to agree, That it should be common to both Na∣tions,
the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> take Toll equally, these last
making those pay who pass into <HI>Spain,</HI> and the former doing
the like in relation to those who pass over to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>War does not hinder Commerce on this Frontier: it's true
they cannot subsist without it, seeing they must perish through
Want, did they not assist one another.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
This Country called <HI>Biscay,</HI> is full of high Mountains, where
are several Iron Mines: The <HI>Biscays</HI> climb up the Rocks as
easily, and with as great swiftness as Stags: Their Language
(if one may call such <HI>Jargon</HI> Language) is very poor, seeing one
Word signifies abundance of Things: there are none but those
born in the Country that can understand it, and I am told,
that to the end it may be more particularly theirs, they make
no use of it in Writing; they make their Children to read
and write <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> according to which Kings Sub∣jects
they are. Its certain, as soon as I past the little River of
<HI>Bydassoa,</HI> I was not understood, unless I spake <HI>Castilian:</HI> and not
above a quarter of an Hour before, I should not have been un∣derstood
had <HI>I</HI> not spoke <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>I found on the other side of this River a Banker of St. <HI>Se∣bastian,</HI>
to whom I was recommended, he carried for me with
two of his Relations, they were cloathed after the <HI>French</HI> man∣ner,
but ridiculously, their <HI>Justau Corps</HI> being short and large,
and their Sleeves hanging down very short, those of their Shirts
were so large, that they hung down below their <HI>Justau Corps:</HI>
they had Bands without Collars, and Periwigs, one of which had
enough Hair for four, and so frizled as made them look as if
they were frighted, isler drest People you cannot meet with.
Those who wear their own Hair, wear it very long and close,
parting it on the Crown, and pass part of it behind their Ears,
but what kind of Ears think you? those of <HI>Midas</HI> were not
larger, and I believe that to lengthen them, they are stretched
when they be young, without question they find some kind of
Beauty herein.</P>
<P>My three <HI>Spaniards</HI> made me in bad <HI>French</HI> most tedious and
dull Complements. We past through the Borough of <HI>Tran,</HI> which
is about a quarter of a League from the River, and came after∣wards
to <HI>Irun,</HI> which is distant about another quarter of a
League, this little Town is the first of <HI>Spain</HI> which you meet
with, leaving <HI>France:</HI> it's ill buil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the Streets are unequal,
and there's nothing one can speak of: We entered into the Inn
through the Stable, where are the Stairs on which you meet
ascend to your Chamber; this is the Countries Fashion. I
found this House very light, by a great many Candles, which
were as small as Pack thread; there were at least forty in my
Chamber, fixt on little bits of Wood; in the midst of them
stood a Pan of Coals burning, made of Olive Rhine, to take
away the scent of the Candles.</P>
<P>I had a great Supper, which my Gallants, the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
had caused to be made ready for me, but all was so full of Gar∣lick,
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
Saffron and Spice, that I could eat nothing: and I had
made very bad Cheer, had not my Cook made me a little Ragou
of what he could find.</P>
<P>Determining to go but to St. <HI>Sebastian</HI> the next Morning,
which is but seven or eight Leagues, I thought to Dine before
I set out: I was sitting at Table, when one of my Women
brought me my Watch to wind it up, as it was my Custom at
Noon, it was a striking Watch of <HI>Tompion</HI>'s make, and cost
me fifty <HI>Lewises:</HI> My Banker, who was by me, shew'd some
desire to see it, I gave it him with a customary Civility.
This was enough, my Blade rises, makes me a profound Reve∣rence,
telling me, “He did not deserve so considerable a Pre∣sent,
but such a Lady as I could make no other: That he
would engage his Faith and Reputation, that he would never
part with my Watch as long as he lived, and that he found him∣self
extreamly obliged to me. He kist it at the end of this
pleasant Complement, and thrust it into his Pocket, which
was deeper than a Sack.” You'll take me to be a very great Sot
in saying nothing to all this, and I do not wonder at it, but I
confess ingeniously, I was so surpriz'd at his Proceeding,
that the Watch was out of sight before I could resolve
on what I was to do. My Women and the rest of my
Servants which were about me, stared on me, and I on
them blushing with Shame and Vexation to be thus caught:
However I recollected my self, and considered, that this Man
was to pay me a good round Sum of Money for the Charge of
my Journey, and to return Money to <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> where I had
taken it up; that having Bills of Credit on him, he might use
several Tricks to me, and puts-off, which might make me spend
twice the Value of the Watch: In fine, I let him part with it,
and endeavoured to do my self Honour from a thing which gave
me great Mortification.</P>
<P>I have learnt, since this little Adventure, that 'tis the Custom
in <HI>Spain,</HI> when any thing is presented to one, if he likes it,
and kisses your Hand, he may take it with him. This is a ve∣ry
pleasant Fashion, and being sufficiently acquainted with it,
'twill be my Fault if I am Trapt again.</P>
<P>I left this Inn, where they peeled me sufficiently; for this
is a grievous dear Country, and every one strives to be Rich at
his Neighbours Cost. A while after we had left the Town,
we entered on the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Mountains, which are so high and
steep, that looking down you see not without Horror, the
Precipices which environ them, we went thus as far as <HI>Rentery.
Don Antonio</HI> (which was my Bankers Name) went before me,
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
and for my more commodious Passage, he obliged me to quit
my Litter; for although we had travest several Mountains,
yet there remained more difficult to pass, he made me to enter
into a little Boat, which he had prepared to go down the Ri∣ver
of <HI>Andaye,</HI> till we were near the Mouth of the Sea, where
we saw the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Gallions; there were three very
fine and large ones. Our little Boats were set forth with Gilt
Streamers; they were managed by Girls who were very lusty
and handsome; there are three in each, two that Row, and
one who holds the Rudder.</P>
<P>These Wenches are very well shaped, of Chesnut Complecti∣on,
have very good Teeth, Hair Black, which they tie up
with Ribbons, in Knots, and so let it hang behind them. They
wear a kind of Veil on their Heads, made of Muslin, em∣broidered
with Flowers of Gold and Silk, which hangs loose,
and covers their Breasts; they wear Pendants in their Ears of
Gold and Pearls, and Bracelets of Coral; they have a kind of
<HI>Justau Corps,</HI> like our <HI>Gypsies,</HI> whose Sleeves are very strait. I
can assure you they charmed me. I was told, these Wenches
swim like Fishes, and suffer neither Women nor Men among
them. This is a kind of a Republick, where they repair from
all parts, and where their Parents send them very young.</P>
<P>When they are willing to marry, they go to Mass at <HI>Fon∣tarabia,</HI>
which is the nearest Town to them; and there the
young Men come to chuse them Wives to their Humour. He
that will engage himself in <HI>Hymens</HI> Bonds, goes to his Mi∣stress's
Parents, declares to them his Intentions, regulates eve∣ry
thing with them. And this being done, notice of it is given
to the Maid, if she likes the Party, she retires to their House,
where the Nuptials are celebrated.</P>
<P>I never saw a more gay Air than that on their Countenances,
they have little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abitations along the Water-side, and there
are old Maidens, to whom the younger pay respect, as to their
Mothers. They related these Particulars to us in their Lan∣guage,
and we hearkened to them with great Delight, when
the Devil, who never sleeps, disturbed us with a vexatious Ad∣venture.</P>
<P>My Cook, who is a <HI>Gascon,</HI> and exactly of the Humour of
those of that Country, was in one of our Boats behind us, at
some distance, very near a young <HI>Biscaneer,</HI> who appeared
to him very handsome; he contented not himself with telling
her as much, but would have rudely turned up her Veil. She
being not used to this sort of plain Dealing, without any words
broke his Head with her Oar. Having done this Exploit, Fear
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
seizing on her, she threw her self immediately into the Wa∣ter,
tho' the Season was very cold, and swam with great swift∣ness;
but having all her Cloaths on, and it being far to the
Shoar, her strength began to sail her. Several of these
Wenches who saw this at Land, leapt immediately into their
Boats to her Assistance, when those who had remained in the
Boat with the Cook, fearing the loss of their Companion, fell
on him like two Furies, resolving by all means to drown him,
and had like two or three times to have overturned their little
Vessel, which we beholding from ours, had much a-do to part
and appease them.</P>
<P>I assure you, the foolish <HI>Gascon</HI> was so cruelly handled, that
he was all over blood; and my Banker told me, that these
young <HI>Biscaneers</HI> provoked, are worse than Lions. In fine,
we came to Land, but were scarcely on Shoar, but we saw this
Wench which was saved out of the Water, making up to∣wards
us, with near fifty others, each with an Oar on their
Shoulder, marching in Battle-ray, with Fife and Drum; when
she who was to be the Mouth of the Company, advanced, and
calling me several times <HI>Andria,</HI> which is to say, <HI>Madam,</HI>
(so that's all I could retain of her Speech) gave me to under∣stand,
That they would have my Cooks Skin, if Satisfaction
were not made proportionably to the Damage done their Com∣panions
Cloaths. At the ending of which words, the She-Drummers
fell loudly beating their Drums, and the rest of their
<HI>Amazons</HI> set up an Hollowing Leaping and Dancing, and Fencing
with their Oars in a most astonishing manner.</P>
<P><HI>Don Antonio,</HI> to make me amends for the Present he had
wrung from me, (I cannot but often mention it, lying on my
Heart as it does) undertook to make Peace. He found that my
Cook, who thought himself sufficiently beaten, had Reason to
give nothing; and therefore he distributed some Pieces of
Money among this Marine Troop: On receipt of which they set
forth lowder Hollows than before, and wished me a good
Journey, and speedy Return, each of them dancing and singing
at the sound of their Pipes and Tabors.</P>
<P>We entred into a very rough Way, and ascending a very
long narrow Path, on the side of which there are Precipices,
so that I was greatly afraid lest the Mules which carryed my
Litter should stumble: we afterwards past over a large Sandy
Field. I tarryed some time in the Convent of St. <HI>Francis,</HI>
which stands near the River of <HI>Andaye.</HI> We past over it on
a very long Wooden Bridge; and though we were near St.
<HI>Sebastian,</HI> yet we could not then perceive it, because a Moun-tain
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
of Sand hid the Town: it's situated on the Foot of a Moun∣tain,
which serves on one side as a Rampart against the Sea,
and the Vessels come to the Foot of this Mountain, to shelter
them from the Storms, for here arise extraordinary Tempests,
that the Ships at Anchor perish in the Port: it's deep, and
defended by two Moles, which leave only as much room as is
requisite for one Vessel passing at a time. They have raised here
a great four Square Tower, where there is ever a good Garrison
to defend the place in case of Assault, it was a fine Day for the
Season. I found the Town very pleasant, being surrounded
with a double Wall, there are mounted several Pieces of Can∣non
on that part towards the Sea, with Bastions and Half
Moons. The Town is situated in a Province of <HI>Spain,</HI> called
<HI>Guipuscoa,</HI> the Out-parts are exceeding pleasant, by reason that
the Sea, as I now said, serves for a Channel to it: the Streets
of this Town are long and large, paved with great White
Stones, which are always clean; the Houses are well enough,
and the Churches decent, in which the Altars are of Wood,
on which are hung little Pictures, from top to bottom. Mines
of Iron and Steel abound in this Country, finer and purer
perhaps than in any other Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> and this is the
greatest part of their Trade. Here the Wool which comes from
<HI>Castille</HI> is embarked, which makes a considerable part of their
Traffick. <HI>Bilbo</HI> and St. <HI>Sebastian</HI> are two of the most conside∣rable
Ports which the King of <HI>Spain</HI> has on the Ocean: The
Castle stands very high, and may make an indifferent Defence,
here are mounted several fine Pieces of Cannon, and there
are a great many along the Ramparts; but the Garrison is so
weak, that the Women might conquer them with their
Distaffs.</P>
<P>Every thing is as dear in this Town as in <HI>Paris,</HI> yet they fare
well here: Fish is excellent, and I was told Fruit was the same,
I lay in the best Inn, and when I had been there some time,
<HI>Don Ferdinand de Tolledo</HI> sent his Gentlemen to enquire whether
his Visit would not be troublesome to me. My Banker, who
knew him, and who was then in my Chamber, told me, he
was a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of great Quality, Nephew to the Duke <HI>de Alva,</HI>
that he came from <HI>Flanders</HI> and was going to <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>I received him with that Civility which was due to his Birth,
and soon thereunto adjoyn'd particular Respects to his own Me∣rit.
He is a Gentleman of good Presence, has Wit and Po∣liteness,
is Complaisant and agreeable; he speaks as good
<HI>French</HI> as I do; but understanding <HI>Spanish,</HI> and being desirous
to speak it better, we therefore discoursed only in that Lan∣guage.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14"/>
I was very well satisfied with his Carriage, he told me he
came Post hither from <HI>Brussels,</HI> and if I pleased, he would
increase my Train, and be one of my Company. I thought he
jested, and answered him accordingly; but he added, the
ways were so full of Snow, that indeed they could not ride
Post; that he could make more speed on Horses than in Litters,
but the Honour of accompanying me, made abundance Recom∣pence
for that. In a word, I say he was a civil Person, and
came no way short of the Gallantry natural to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Cava∣liers:
I therefore considered how advantageous it might prove
to have a Man of this Quality, and Country, who could make
himself be heard and obeyed by the Muletteers, who have Iron
Souls and no Consciences.</P>
<P>I told him, I was very glad I met with him, and the Fa∣tigue
of the Road would be lessened by his Company. He im∣mediately
thereupon ordered his Gentleman to find a Litter for
him. It being late, he took his leave of me, and I betook my
self to eat a good Supper; for my dear Cousen, I am none of
those Romantick Ladies that never eat.</P>
<P>Scarcely did I begin to sleep, when I heard some body
speak <HI>French</HI> so near me, that I thought at first 'twas in my
Chamber, but having hearkened with more attention, I found
'twas a Chamber separated from mine by only some thin
Boards, and those ill joynted. I drew my Curtain, and saw
Light through the Crevices, and at the same time two young
Women, the eldest of which appeared not to be above Seven∣teen
or Eighteen, neither of them were of those Beauties with∣out
Defect, yet were they so pretty, spake so sweetly, and had
such great sweetness on their Countenances, that I was much ta∣ken
with them.</P>
<P>The youngest, who seemed to continue the Conversation,
said to the other, <HI>No, my dear Sister, there is no Remedy to our
Misfortunes, we must die, or get them out of the Clutches of
this villanous Dotard. I am resolute for any thing,</HI> replyed the
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, in uttering a deep sigh▪ <HI>should it cost me my Life: What
remains? Have we not sacrificed all for them?</HI> Then considering
a while their Misfortunes, they mutually embraced, and began
to weep in a most pitious manner: And having consulted a
while, and spake some other Words, the greatest part of which
were interrupted by their Sighs, they concluded on Writing,
which they did, and here is most of what I heard them read
to one another:</P>
<P>Judge not of my Love and Grief by my Words, I have none can
express either the one or the other; but remember you Ruine me,
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
unless you betake himself to the greatest Extremities against him
that persecutes us. He has now sent me word, <HI>That if we delay
our Departure, he will have us seized.</HI> Consider what he deserves
from this base Ʋsage of us; and remember you owe me all, seeing
you owe me my Heart.</P>
<P>I think the other Billet was in these Terms,</P>
<P>Could I secure thee thy Happiness, in losing mine, I love thee
sufficiently to offer thee such a Sacrifice. Yes, I would fly from
thee, couldst thou be Happy without me; but I know thy Heart
too well to believe this. Yet thou remainest as Quiet in thy Pri∣son,
as if I were with thee. Break thy Chains without more de∣lay;
punish the Enemy of our Loves. My Heart shall be thy Recom∣pense.</P>
<P>Having made up these Billets, they went out together, and
I profess, I was not a little uneasie for them, and no less curious
to know these poor Ladies Misfortunes. This hindred me from
sleeping, and I was expecting their Return, when immediate∣ly
there was a great Uproar in the House. I saw an old Man
enter the Chamber attended by a great many Servants. He
held one of these young Women by the Hair of the Head,
which he had wound about his Arm, and drew her after him,
as a wretched Sacrifice. Her Sister was not treated with less
Cruelty, by those who led her. <HI>Perfidious Wretches,</HI> said he to
them, <HI>not content with the irreparable Injury you do my Nephews,
you would perswade them to be my Executioners? Had I not surpri∣sed
you with these seducing Letters what might have hapned? what
dreadful Tragedies might I not have expected? But you shall pay
once for all: as soon as ever the Day appears I will have you punisht
as you deserve. Ah Sir,</HI> said she whom he held, <HI>remember we are
Women of Quality, and that our Alliance can be no Dishonour to you,
that your Nephews have given us their Faith, and we them ours,
that in so tender an Age we have left all for their sakes; that we
are strangers, and have no Friends here: What will become of us?
We dare not return to our Relations: if you are for constraining us
to this, or for putting us in Prison, let us intreat you rather presently
to dispatch us out of the World.</HI></P>
<P>The Tears which they shed in such abundance, wrought in
me the greatest Compassion: And had the old Man been as
tender as I, he had soon freed them from their Trouble.</P>
<P>My Women, who had heard such a great Disturbance, and
so near my Chamber, arose, in the fear of some Mishap to∣wards
me. I made Signs to them to draw near softly, and
to behold through the Boards this sorrowful Spectacle. We
hearkened to what they said, when two Men, with their Swords
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
in their Hands, entred into my Chamber, the Door of which
my Women had left open: They had Despair painted on their
Faces, and Rage in their Eyes: I was so greatly frighted that I
cannot express it to you. They looked on one another with∣out
speaking a word; and having heard the old Man's Voice,
they ran on that side.</P>
<P><HI>I did not doubt but 'twas the two Lovers; and 'twas them
indeed, who entred like two Lions into this Chamber: They
struck these Servants with so great Terror, that never a one of
'em dared approach his Master, to defend him, when his Ne∣phews
advance towards him, and set their Swords to his Throat:</HI>
Barbarian, <HI>said they to him,</HI> can you thus use Women of Quality,
that are to be our Wives? Because you are our Gardian, must you
therefore be our Tyrant? And is not the separating of us from what
we love, the taking of our Lives from us? It's now in our Power
to take a just Vengeance of you; but we cannot do it to a Man of
your Age, who cannot defend himself: give us then your Word, and
swear by all that's Good and Holy, That in Acknowledgment for the
Life we give you, you will contribute to our Happiness, and suffer us
to perform what we have promis'd.</P>
<P>The poor old Wretch was so afrighted, that he could hardly
make any Answer; However, he swore more than they would
have him; he fell on his Knees, and kist an hundred times his
Thumb laid a-cross one of his Fingers, after the manner of <HI>Spain.</HI>
Yet he told them, <HI>whatever he had done, was only in regard to
their Interests; however, he would not in any sort, for the future,
oppose their Inclinations, in reference to this Marriage.</HI> Two of
the Domesticks took him under the Arm, and rather carried him
away than led him. Then the Gentlemen seeing themselves
free, threw themselves in their Mistresses Arms; they said to
one another, whatever Grief, Love and Joy do usually inspire
in such Occasions. But in Truth, one must have a Heart as af∣fected
and content as theirs, to repeat all these things: they are
only proper to Persons more tender than you are, my dear Cosen.
But I hope you will excuse this Relation; I was so tired, in ha∣ving
not yet slept, that I could scarce hear any more, but confu∣sedly:
and to hear no more, I got farther into bed, and threw
the Quilt over my Head.</P>
<P>The next Morning <HI>Don Fernando de Toledo,</HI> sent me some choice
Wines, with great quantity of Oranges and Sweet-meats. As soon
as he thought it a proper time to Visit me, he came: Having
thankt him for his Present, I ask'd him, Whether he had heard
nothing of what had past in the Night? He told me, <HI>No,</HI> for
he had lain in another part of the House. I was about relating
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
to him what I knew, when our Hostess entred into the Cham∣ber:
she came from the Two Gentlemen who had given me that
Disturbance, with the Swords in their Hands, intreating me to
receive their Excuses. She likewise told me, that two young
Ladies desired they might wait on me, and kiss my Hand. I
answer'd these Civilities as I ought; and they soon entred.</P>
<P><HI>What charming effects does the Return of Joy pro∣duce?
I found these Gentlemen very well shaped, and these
Ladies very lovely; neither one nor the other had any more
on their Countenances the Characters of Despair; an Air of
Gaiety display'd it self in all their words and gestures. The
Eldest of the two Brethren made the most handsome Excuse
as is possible for his Mistake in entring my Chamber: he ad∣ded,
“He had well observ'd the Fear he had caus'd me; but
told me, that in that Moment he was so transported, that
he was capable of no other Thought but the Rescuing his
Mistress.”</HI> You would have been to blame, <HI>said I to him,</HI> should
you have thought of any thing else: However, if it be true, you
are willing, to make me Satisfaction for the Alarum you have
giv'n me, you must not refuse the gratifying my Curiosity? With these
fair Ladies leave, inform me what has reduced all of you to these
Extremities you were in. <HI>He lookt on them, as if it were to
ask their Approbation, which they willingly granted; and he
thus began:</HI> We are two Brothers, Madam, Natives of <HI>Burgos,</HI>
and one of the best Families of this City. We were very young,
when we fell into the Hands of an Ʋncle, who took care of our
Education and Estates, which are so considerable, that we need
not envy others on that account. <HI>Don Diego</HI> (is our Ʋncle's
Name) he had made long since a firm Friendship with a Gentle∣man
living near <HI>Blaye,</HI> whose Merit is far above his Fortune, he
is call'd <HI>Monsieur de Messignac:</HI> Our Ʋncle resolving to send us
for some time into <HI>France,</HI> he wrote hereupon to his Friend, who
offered him his House, which he joyfully accepted. He made us
set out, and it is a Year since we were receiv'd there with great
Civility; <HI>Madam de Messignac</HI> used us as her own Children; she
has several, but of her four Daughters, those you see are the most
amiable. It would have been very difficult to have seen them eve∣ry
day, to dwell with them, and yet not to have loved them.</P>
<P>My Brother at first conceal'd from me his growing Passion, and
I hid mine from him; we were both of us very melancholly; the
trouble of loving, without being lov'd again, and the fear of dis∣pleasing
those who caus'd our Passion, all this cruelly tormented
us; but a new Vexation did greatly increase our Disquiet, which
was a restless Jealousie we had one of another: My Brother
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
plainly saw I was in Love, and thought 'twas with his Mistress;
I lookt on him likewise as my Rival; and we bore such Hatred to
one another, as might have transported us to the greatest Extre∣mities:
but that I resolutely determin'd one day to discover my
Sentiments to <HI>Mademoiselle de Messignac;</HI> but wanting Courage
to speak to her my self, I wrote some Verses in a little Book touch∣ing
my Passion for her, and dextrously slid it into her Pocket,
without her perceiving me. My Brother who had always an Eye
on me observ'd it, and playing with her, he took out the Verses,
and found them to contain a respectful and passionate Declaration of
Love to her: he kept them till Night, when being withdrawn
into my Chamber, with the greatest Inquietude, he came to me,
and tenderly embracing me, he told me, he was heartily glad at the
notice he had of my being in love with <HI>Mademoiselle de Messignac.</HI></P>
<P>I remain'd as one Thunderstruck; I saw my Papers in his Hands;
I imagin'd she had made them a Sacrifice to him, and that he
came to insult on my Misfortune. He saw in <HI>my</HI> Eyes and Counte∣nance
part of what I thought: <HI>Undeceive your self,</HI> continued he,
<HI>she gave 'em not to me; I have taken 'em without her seeing
them: I'll be serviceable to you for the obtaining her; be you
the same to me in relation to her elder Sister.</HI> I then embraced
him, and promised him all he desired. Thus we mutually rendred
good Offices to one another; and our Mistresses, who were not then
acquainted with the power of Love, began to accustom themselves
to hear talk of it.</P>
<P>It would be to abuse your Patience, to tell you, Madam, how
we came at length by our Cares and Assiduities to win their Hearts.
What happy Moments! what sweet Hours! to see without cea∣sing
what one loves, and to be beloved! to be together in the Fields,
where an Innocent and Country life, let's one taste, without distur∣bance,
the Pleasures of a growing Passion; this is a Felicity which
cannot be exprest.</P>
<P>Winter being come, <HI>Madam de Messignac</HI> was at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI>
where she had a House; we accompanied her thither; but this
House was not great enough to lodge us, with all our Family; we
took one near hers.</P>
<P>Though this Separation was only the Nights, yet we had lively
Resentments of it; we were not now every Moment with 'em; our
Visits were accompanied with a certain Air of Ceremonies, which
disturb'd us. But our Alarums were much increas'd when we saw
two rich handsome Sparks address themselves to <HI>Mademoselles de
Messignac,</HI> and earnestly Court them, and that with the Appro∣bation
of their Parents. Good God, how we look'd! Their Proceedings
went on at a great rate, and our dear Mistresses, who shared
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
in our Sorrow, mingled every day their Tears with ours. In fine,
having throughly tormented our selves, by devising a thousand fruit∣less
ways, I resolv'd to Address my self to <HI>Monsieur de Messig∣nac:</HI>
I spake to him, and told him what my Passion inspired me,
to perswade him to defer these Marriages. He answered, <HI>He ac∣cepted,
with the greatest Acknowledgments, the Offers my Bro∣ther
and I made him; but being not of Age, what we might
do at present might be afterwards Cancel'd: That his Honour
was dear to him, though his Estate was small; however, should
always esteem himself Happy, in living without Reproach:
That my Uncle, who had entrusted us to him, might justly
accuse him of Seducing us, and that in short, we must no more
think of these Matters.</HI></P>
<P>I withdrew in the greatest Affliction, which I shared with my
Brother; and this was a dreadful trouble among us. <HI>Monsieur
de Messignac,</HI> to compleat our misfortunes, sent an Account to my
Ʋncle, of what had past, and earnestly intreated him to lay his
Commands on us to be gone. He did so, and seeing no remedy to our
Misfortunes, we went, my Brother and I, to <HI>Mademoiselles
de Messignac,</HI> we threw our selves at her Feet; We told them,
what might perswade Hearts already pre-possest: We gave them
our Faith and Promises, Sign'd with our Blood: In short, Love made
an end of vanquishing them; they consented to go with us. In fine, we
took such Measures that our Passage was happy enough till our
Arrival here; and it is not two days since entring this House, the
first Person offering himself to us was <HI>Don Diego;</HI> He was impa∣tient
of our Return; and to satisfie himself, he came in quest of us.
How did we look at this sight! He caus'd us to be apprehended as
Criminals; and forgetting that <HI>Mademoiselles de Messignac,</HI>
were the Daughters of his best Friend, and Persons of Quality, he
loaded them with Injuries, and over-whelm'd them with Threat∣nings;
after he had learnt from one of my Servants, that we
had resolv'd to pass <HI>Incognito</HI> as far as <HI>Madrid,</HI> to some Relations
we had there, to tarry in this place for a full liberty of declaring
our Marriage. He lock't us up in a Chamber next to his; and we
were there, when these Ladies came by Moon light, coughing un∣der
our Windows. We heard them, and ran to them—They shew'd
us their Letters; and we were devising on our Deliverance, when
my Ʋncle, having notice of what past, silently came upon us with
all his Servants, and before our Faces misused these amiable Crea∣tures.
In the Excess of our Despair our Strength, without doubt,
increas'd. We broke open the Doors, which were fast shut on us,
and we ran to Succour them, when imprudently, Madam, we came
into your Chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="20"/>
The Gentleman here stopt, and I found he had related his
little History with great Ingenuity. I thank't him for it, and
offer'd these Ladies my Endeavours, and those of my Friends, to
appease their Family: Which Offers they accepted, and testifi'd
their Acknowledgments.</P>
<P>Some Ladies of the Town, who came to see me, wou'd stop
me; they proposed to me to go to the Religioses, whose Convent
is so pleasantly situated, that the Prospect has no Bounds: You
may see thence, at the same time, the Sea, Ships, Towns, Woods
and Fields. They spake much in praise of the Voices, Beauty,
and good humour of these Religioses. Add to this, that the ill
Weather was so increast, and the Snow fall'n in so great abun∣dance,
that no body advised me to proceed in my Journey. I
was in suspence a while, but the Impatience I had to be at <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI>
prevail'd over all these Considerations, and I parted the
next Morning. I have receiv'd of my Banker the Money I
want.</P>
<P>But I must not forget to tell you, that the Inhabitants of this
Town have a particular Priviledge, and of which they are not a
little proud; which is, That when they Treat of any Affairs
with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that it is directly with him, he is
oblig'd to speak with them bare-headed. I could not get the
Reason from 'em for this.</P>
<P>I am told I must furnish my self with good store of Provision,
to prevent starving in some places through which we must pass;
and Gammons of Bacon, dried Tongues, being much esteem'd
in this Country, I have therefore taken up a good quantity; and
as to the rest, we have sufficiently provided. Now this being
the Post-day, I would not omit this occasion of informing you
of what has hapned to me; and testifying that I am,</P>
<CLOSER>Yours.
<DATELINE>From St. <HI>Sebastian,</HI>
<DATE>Feb. 20. 1679.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I Re-assume, Dear Cousen, without any Compliments, the
Sequel of my Travels: In leaving St. <HI>Sebastian,</HI> we entred
into a very rough Way, which brings you to such terrible
steep Mountains, that you cannot ascend them without climb∣ing;
they are call'd <HI>Sierra de</HI> St. <HI>Adrian.</HI> They shew only
Precipices and Rocks, on which a puling Lover may meet
with certain Death, if he has a mind to it. Pine Trees of an
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
extraordinary heighth crown the top of these Mountains. As
far as the Sight will reach you see nothing but Desarts, cut
with Streams clearer than Chrystal. Near the highest part of
Mount St. <HI>Adrian,</HI> you meet with an elevated Rock, which
seems to have been placed in the midst of the way to Block up
the Passage, and thus separate <HI>Biscaye</HI> from the <HI>Old Castille.</HI></P>
<P>A tedious and painful Labour has pierced this mass of Stone
in manner of a Vault; you may walk forty or fifty Paces un∣der
it, without sight of Day, but what comes by the Over∣tures
at each Entry, which are shut by great Doors: You find
under this Vault an Inn, which is left in the Winter, by Rea∣son
of the Snows: You see here likewise a little Chappel of
St. <HI>Adrian,</HI> and several Caverns, where Thieves commonly re∣treat;
so that it is dangerous passing here without being in a
condition of Defence. When we had traverst the Rock, we
still a little ascended, to arrive to the top of the Moun∣tain,
which is held to be the highest of the <HI>Pyranea's;</HI> it
is wholly covered with great Ash Trees. There was never a
finer place of Solitude; the Springs run here as in the
Valleys: the sight is only bounded by the Weakness of the
Eyes; Shades and Silence here reign, and the Eccho's an∣swers
on every side. We began afterwards to descend down
faster than we climed up: We saw in some parts little barren
Plains, many sandy places, and ever and anon Mountains co∣vered
with great Rocks. It is not without Reason, that in
passing so near, you fear, lest some one of 'em should get loose,
which would certainly over-whelm one; for you see some
which are fall'n from the top, and hang in their passage on
other Clefts; and these finding nothing in the way, would give
a sorry Diversion to a Traveller. I made all these Reflections at
my ease; for I was alone in my Litter, with my Child, who
did not at all disturb my Thoughts. A River call'd <HI>Ʋrrola,</HI> big
enough, but which was increased by the Torrents, and melt∣ed
Snow slides along the Way, and breaks forth into parti∣cular
Streams in some places, which fall with a great impetuo∣sity
and noise, and make a very pleasant sound and sight.</P>
<P>We meet not here with those fine Castles to be seen on the
Banks of the <HI>Loire,</HI> which make Travellers call it the Country
of <HI>Faries.</HI> Here are on these Mountains only some Shepherds
Cottages, and some few Hovels, and at that distance, that you
must go a great way before you can find them; yet all these
Natural Objects; though very melancholly ones, yet have
something that is very taking in them. The Snows were so
high, that we had always twenty Men, who made way for us
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
with Shovels. You will perhaps imagine this cost me very
much; but here are so well establisht Orders, and those so
well observ'd, that the Inhabitants of a Village are oblig'd to
meet Travellers, and be their Guides to the next; and no one
being bound to give them any thing, the lest Liberality there∣fore
satisfies them. To this first Care there is added another,
which is that of Ringing the Bells without ceasing, to give no∣tice
to Travellers, where they may retreat in stormy Weather,
They told me, there had not fall'n this forty Years so much
Snow as we met with, there having been no Frost for a great
while in this Province.</P>
<P>Our Troop was so great, that we might count our selves no
ways inferiour to those Famous Caravans which go to <HI>Mecha;</HI>
for without reckoning my Train, and that of <HI>Don Farnand de
Toledo,</HI> there joyn'd with us near St. <HI>Sebastian,</HI> three Knights,
with their Attendants, who return'd from their Commander∣ships
of St. <HI>James;</HI> there were two of this Order, and one of
that of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cantara:</HI> The first wear Red Crosses, in form of an
embroidered Sword, on their Shoulders; and he of <HI>Alcantara</HI>
had a Green one. One of the two first is of <HI>Andalousia,</HI> the
other of <HI>Galicia,</HI> and the third of <HI>Catalonia;</HI> they are of good
Families; he of <HI>Andalousia</HI> calls himself <HI>Donesleve de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arvaial,</HI> he
of <HI>Galicia, Don Sancho Sanniento,</HI> and the other of <HI>Cata∣lonia,
Don Frederic de Cardonne;</HI> they are Persons of good
Mein, and well acquainted with the World. I receiv'd all pos∣sible
Civilities from them, having much of the <HI>French</HI> Humour
in them. They have travelled over the greatest Part of <HI>Europe;</HI>
and this has rendred them so Polite. We went to lye at <HI>Gala∣reta;</HI>
this is a Borough a little distant from Mount <HI>Adrian,</HI>
situated in the little Province of <HI>Spain,</HI> I now mention'd, na∣med
<HI>Alava,</HI> which makes a Part of <HI>Biscaye,</HI> we had there but
bad Entertainment. They reckon it eleven Leagues from
thence to St. <HI>Sebastian.</HI></P>
<P>We had better way from <HI>Galareta</HI> to <HI>Victoria</HI> than we had
before: The Country here yields much Corn and Grapes; and
the Villages lie very thick together: We found here Custom-House-Men,
who made us pay both for the Cloaths and Money
we carried with us: they were not very exacting with us, be∣cause
our Company was too large to be imposed on. <HI>Don Fer∣nand
de Toledo</HI> had inform'd me over Night, that we were to
travel near the Castle of <HI>Quebare,</HI> which was said to be haunt∣ed
with a Spirit, telling me a thousand extravagant Stories,
which were readily swallow'd by the Inhabitants of the Country,
and which were so effectually believ'd by them, that no body
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
would live there. I had a great desire to see this place; for
although I am naturally as fearful as another, yet am not afraid
of Ghosts; and if I were, our Company was so numerous, as
would animate the greatest Coward: we struck off a little to
the left, and came to the Borough of <HI>Quebara;</HI> the Master of
the Inn where we entred, had the Keys of the Castle; he told
us, in going along with us, <HI>That the</HI> Duende, which is to say
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Spirit, <HI>could not endure Company; yet if we were a thousand
together, he would, if he were minded, beat us all, in such a
manner, as to leave us for dead.</HI> I began to tremble; <HI>Don Fer∣nand
de Toledo,</HI> and <HI>Don Frederic de Cardonne,</HI> who gave me their
Hands, perceiving my Fear, burst out into Laughter: I grew a∣sham'd,
and pretended to gain Courage; and so we entred the
Castle, which might have past for a fine one, had it been kept
in order: it had no Furniture, except an old Tapistry Hanging
in a great Hall, which represented the Amours of <HI>Don Pedro the
Cruel,</HI> and <HI>Donna Maria de Padilla:</HI> she is represented sitting
like a Queen in the midst of other Ladies, and the King placing
on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Head a Crown of Flowers: In another part she sate un∣der
the shade of a Wood, the King shewing her a Hawk on his
Fist: And again, in another, she appears in a Warrier's Dress,
and the King in Armour presents her with a Sword; which
makes me believe that she had been in some Warlike Expedi∣tion
with him. She was very ill represented; and <HI>Don Fernand</HI>
told me, “He had seen her Effigies elsewhere, by which she ap∣peared
to be the most beautiful and most cruel Woman of her
time; and that the Figures in this Tapistry resembled nei∣ther
her nor the King, his Name, Cypher and Arms were eve∣ry
where on it.” We went up into a Tower, on the top of
which was a Dungeon, and 'twas there where the Spirit inha∣bited;
but without doubt he was abroad, for we neither saw nor
heard him, or any of his Companions; and having seen
sufficiently this great Building, we left it to pursue our Journey.
In approaching <HI>Victoria,</HI> we past over a most delightful Plain,
at the end of which s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands a Town situated in this Province of
<HI>Spain,</HI> I lately mention'd, call'd <HI>Alava;</HI> this is the Capital
Town of it, as well as the first of <HI>Castille:</HI> It is inclosed with
two Walls, one of which is old, and the other new; besides
this, it has no other Fortifications. After I had refresh'd my
self a while here, 'twas proposed to me to go to a Play, but in
tarrying till it began, I had no small Diversion, in seeing come
into the most spacious place of the Town, four Companies of
young Men, preceded by Drums and Trumpets, they marched
several times round, and in fine, immediately began the Fight
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
with Snow-balls, which they threw on one another with such
Fierceness, that they were all very well pelted in the end: they
were above two hundred who fought this Battle. To tell you
of those who fell, or recovered their Feet again, and the Shouts
and Acclamations of the People, will be needless; and I was
obliged to leave them thus engaged, to go to the place where
the Play was to be represented.</P>
<P>When I entred into the Room, the People set forth an hol∣lowing,
<HI>Mira, mira!</HI> which is to say, Look, look! The Decorati∣on
of the Theatre was not over Magnificent; it was rais'd on
Barrels, and ill-rang'd Planks; the Windows of the Room
were open, for they used no Candles or Flambeaux; whence
you may easily imagine this much takes away from the Beauty
of the Sight, They acted the Life of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> and when
the Players said any thing which pleas'd the Company, all the
People cryed out, <HI>Victoria, Victoria;</HI> I was informed this was
the Custom of the Country. I observ'd the Devil was no other
ways clad, than the rest, having only a pair of Stockins of a
Flame-colour, and a pair of Horns to distinguish him. This
Comedy consisted only of three Acts, and they are all no more:
at the end of which serious Act, another began of Farce and
Pleasantry, wherein appear'd him they called <HI>El Graciosa,</HI> which
is to say, the Buffoon, who, among much insipid Stuff, says
sometimes something that is less nauseous: The Interludes were
mixt with Dances, to the sound of the Harps and Guitars:
The Actors had Castagnets, and a little Hat on their Heads,
without which they never Dance, and then 'tis a Saraband;
they seem not to walk, they slip along so lightly. Their man∣ner
is wholly different from ours: they move too much their
Arms, and often pass their Hands on their Hats and Face▪
and that
with no ill Grace; they play admirable well on the Castagnets.</P>
<P>As to the rest, (dear Cosen) I would not have you think
these Actors, for being in a little City, do much differ from
those of <HI>Madrid.</HI> I was told, that those of the King are a
little better; but in a word, both act what they call <HI>Las Come∣dias
Famosas,</HI> which is to say, The finest and most famous
Comedies; which in truth are very ridiculous: For Example,
when St. <HI>Anthony</HI> said his <HI>Confiteor,</HI> which he did often enough,
all the Spectators fell down on their Knees, and gave them∣selves
such rude <HI>Mea Culpa's,</HI> as was enough to beat the breath
out of their Bodies.</P>
<P>Here would be a proper place to speak of their Habits, but
you had better excuse me till I come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> lest I tire
you with Repetitions: Yet I must tell you, that the Ladies I
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
say in this company, had a prodigious quantity of Red which
begins just under the Eye, and passes from the Chin to the Ears,
and Shoulders, to their very Hands; so that I never saw any
Radishes of a finer Colour.</P>
<P>The Lady Governess of the Town drew near to me; she just
toucht my Cloaths, and hastily drew back her Hand, as if she
had burnt her Fingers. I bid her in <HI>Spanish</HI> not to be afraid:
She at length familiariz'd her self, and told me, “'Twas not
through fear of any thing else but of displeasing me: that
'twas no new thing to her to see <HI>French</HI> Ladies: and that if
she might,” she would gladly dress her self after their fashion.
She ordered Chocolate to be brought her, with which she pre∣sented
me; which is far better here than in <HI>France.</HI> The Play
being ended, I took my leave of her, having thanked her for her
Civilities.</P>
<P>The next Morning, as I entred the Church to hear Mass I espi∣ed
an Hermit, who had the Air of a Person of Quality, and yet
begg'd an Alms of me, with such great Humility, that I was great∣ly
surpriz'd at it: <HI>Don Fernand</HI> having notice of it, drew near, and
said to me, <HI>The Person whom you behold, Madam, is of an illustrious
Family, and of great Merit, but his Fortune very Ʋnhappy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You raise in me,</HI> said I to him, <HI>a great Curiosity to know more;
and therefore I must beg your Favour to satisfie it. You may com∣mand
any thing of me,</HI> replied he, <HI>Madam; but I am not so
throughly inform'd of his Adventures, to undertake the relating them
to you; and I believe 'twere better I engage him into a Recital of
them himself.</HI> He left me, and went immediately to embrace
him, with the greatest Civilities and Tenderness: <HI>Don Frederic
de Cardonne,</HI> and <HI>Don Esteve de Carvajal,</HI> had already accosted
him, as their old Acquaintance; and when <HI>Don Fernand</HI> had
join'd them, they all earnestly intreated him to come with them
when Mass was over. He was earnestly excused himself; but be∣ing
told, I was a Stranger and much importuned, that I might
learn from himself, what had oblig'd him to turn Hermit; he
at length consented, on condition I would permit him to
bring one of his Friends, who was perfectly knowing in what
related to him: <HI>Do us Justice,</HI> continued he, <HI>and judge whether
'tis fit for me to relate such Particularities in this Habit I wear.</HI>
They found he had reason, and pray'd him to bring his Friend,
which he did a while after I was at my Lodgings: He presented
a very fine Cavalier to me; and taking leave of us very civilly,
he told him, “He should be oblig'd to him, if he would satisfie
the Curiosity which <HI>Don Fernand de Toledo</HI> had giv'n me, of
knowing the Spring of his Misfortunes. This Gentleman took
place by me, and began in these Terms:”</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26"/>
I think my self very Happy, Madam, that my Friend has chosen
me to satisfie the Desire you have of knowing his Adventures; but I
fear I shall not acquit my self so well as I would: The Person whose
History you wou'd learn, has been one of the finest Gentlemen in the
World; it would be hard to make a Judgment of him now; he is
buried, as it were in his Hermit's Habit. He was an exceeding
graceful Person, well shaped, of an excellent Mein, and noble Air:
And in fine, had all the Accomplishments, both Natural and Acqui∣red,
of a Person of Quality, being liberal, witty and brave. He was
born at <HI>Cagliari,</HI> Capital of the Isle of <HI>Sardagne,</HI> one of the most il∣lustrious
and richest Families of all that Country.</P>
<P>He was brought up with one of his Cosen Germans; and the sim∣pathy
which was found in their Humours, and Inclinations, was so
great, that they were more strictly united by Friendship than Blood:
they hid no Secret from each other. And when the Marquiss <HI>Bar∣baran</HI>
was married (which was his Cosen's Name,) their Friendship
continued in the same force.</P>
<P>He married one of the finest Women in the World, and the most
Accomplisht; she was then not above Fourteen: She was Heiress to
a very Noble Estate and Family. The Marquess every day discove∣red
new Charms in the Wit and Person of his Wise, which likewise
increased every day his Passion. He speaks without ceasing, of his
Happiness, to <HI>Don Lewis de Barbaron;</HI> which is the Name, Madam,
of my Friend; and when any Affairs oblig'd the Marquess to leave
her, he conjured him to stay with the Marchioness, thereby to lessen
the Trouble of his absence. But alas! how hard is it when one is
at an Age uncapable of serious Reflections, to see continually so fair
a Woman, so young and aimable; and to see her with Indifference!
<HI>Don Lewis</HI> was already desperately in Love with the Marchioness,
and thought then 'twas only for her Husband's sake: Whilst he was
in this Mistake, she fell dangerously sick; at which he grew so
dreadful melancholly, that he then knew but too late, this was
caus'd by a Passion which would prove the greatest Misfortunes of
his whole Life. Finding himself then in this condition, and having
not strength to resist it, he resolv'd to use the utmost Extremity, and
to fly and avoid a place where he was in danger of dying with Love,
or breaking through the Bonds of Friendship. The most cruel Death
wou'd have seemed gentler than the Execution of this Design: When
the Marchioness beginning to grow better, he went to her to bid her
Adieu, and see her no more.</P>
<P>He found her busied in choosing among several Stones of great
price, those which were the finest, which she intended to have set
in a Ring. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was scarce entred the Chamber, but she
desired him, with that Air of Familiarity usual among Relations,
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
to go and fetch her other Stones which she moreover had in her
Cabinet. He ran thither, and by an unexpected good hap, found
among what he lookt for, the Picture enamill'd of the Marchioness,
in little, set with Diamonds, and incircled with a Lock of her
Hair; it was so like, that he had not the power to withstand the
desire he had of stealing it: <HI>I am going to leave her,</HI> said he, <HI>I
shall see her no more; I sacrifice all my quiet to her Husband:
Alas! is not this enough? And may I not without a Crime,
search in my Pain a Consolation so innocent as this.</HI> He kist
several times this Picture; he put it under his Arm, he carefully
hid it, and returning towards her with these Stones, he trembling
told her the Resolution he had taken of Travelling. She appear'd
much amazed at it, and chang'd her colour. He lookt on her at
this moment; he had the pleasure of perceiving it; and their Eyes
being of Intelligence, spake more than their Words: <HI>Alas! What
can oblige you,</HI> Don Lewis, said she to him, <HI>to leave us? Your
Cosen loves you so tenderly: I esteem you, we are never pleas'd
without you, he cannot live from you: Have you not already
travelled? You have without doubt some other Reason for your
Departure, but at least do not hide it from me. Don Lewis,</HI>
pierc'd through with sorrow, could not forbear uttering a deep Sigh,
and taking one of the delicate Hands, of the Charming Person, on
which he fixt his Mouth, <HI>Ah Madam, what do you ask me?</HI> said
he to her, <HI>What can I say to you? And indeed, What can I say
to you, in the Condition I am in?</HI> The Violence he used, to conceal
his Sentiments, caus'd him such a great Weakness, that he fell half
dead at her Feet. She remained troubled and confused at this sight:
She oblig'd him to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it down by her; she dared not lift up her Eyes
to look on him; but she let him see Tears, which she could not for∣bear
shedding, nor resolve to conceal from him.</P>
<P>Scarcely were they come to themselves, when the Marquess en∣tred
into the Chamber. He came to embrace <HI>Don Lewis</HI> with all
the Testimonies of a perfect Friendship, and he was in the greatest
trouble, when he understood he parted for <HI>Naples.</HI> He omitted no
Arguments to perswade him from it, prest his stay with the great∣est
Earnestness, but all in vain. He there immediately took his
leave of the Marchioness, and saw her no more. The Marquess
went out with him, he left him not till the moment of his De∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rture.
This was an Augmentation of <HI>Don Lewis</HI>'s Sorrow, he
would have willingly remained alone to have an intire Liberty of
afflicting himself.</P>
<P>The Marchioness was sensibly afflicted at this Separation: She
had perceived he loved her, before he had known thus much himself,
and she had found in him such singular Merit, that for her part
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
too she had loved him without knowing it; but she found this to her
Cost after his Departure: Recovering but lately from a dangerous
Sickness, of which she was not perfectly cured, this unhappy Acci∣dent
made her fall into a languishing Indisposition, as soon rendred
her quite another body, her Duty, her Reason, her Vertue equally
persecuted her: She was greatly sensible of her Husbands Respects
to her, and she could not suffer but with great Sorrow, that ano∣ther
should take up her thoughts, and have so great a place in her
Affections. She dared not any more mention the Name of <HI>Don
Lewis,</HI> she never made any Inquiries after him, she made it an
indispensable Duty to forget him: This Violence which she used on
her self, was like a continual Martyrdom; she made one of her Wo∣men,
in whom she most confided, the Repository of this Secret:
<HI>Am I not very unhappy?</HI> said she, <HI>I must wish never again to
see a Man, towards whom it is impossible for me to be in a state
of Indifference; his Person is always before mine Eyes, nay,
I think sometimes I see him in the Person of my Husband, the
Resemblance which is between them, serves only to nourish my
Affection towards him. Alas!</HI> Mariana, <HI>I must die, to expi∣ate
this Crime, although it be an involuntary one: I have on∣ly
this means to get rid of a Passion of which I cannot hither∣to
be Mistress: Alas, what have I not done to stifle it, this
Passion which yet is dear to me.</HI> She accompany'd these Words
with a thousand Sighs: She melted into Tears, and though this
Woman had a great deal of Wit and Affection to her Mistress, yet
she could say nothing to her, could yield her any Comfort.</P>
<P><HI>The Marquess in the mean time, every day reproacht his Wife
with her Indifferency to</HI> Don Lewis: I cannot suffer, <HI>said he to
her,</HI> that you should think so little on the Man I love above
all the World, and who had so much Complaisance and Friend∣ship
for you: I must needs say, this is a kind of Hardness, which
would make one judge untowardly of the Tenderness of your
Heart: At least, you must grant, Madam, that he was scarce∣ly
gone, but you forgot him. What good would my remem∣bring
him do him? <HI>said the Marchioness with a languishing Air,</HI>
Do not you see he avoids us? Would he not have been still
with us, if he had any real Kindness for us? Believe me, my
Lord, he deserves a little that we should forsake him in our turn.
<HI>Whatever she could say, repel'd not the Marquess; he still impor∣turn'd
her to write to</HI> Don Lewis <HI>to Return. One Day among the
rest, she was gotten into his Closet to speak to him about some Af∣fairs,
she found him busied in reading a Letter of</HI> Don Lewis <HI>which
he lately receiv'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>She would have retir'd; but he took this opportunity to oblige her
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
to do what he would have her; he told her very seriously,</HI> That
he could no longer bear the Absence of his Cosen; that he was
resolved to go find him; that 'twas already two Years since
he had been gone, without intimating any desire of returning
to his Friends and Country; that he was perswaded he would
yield a greater Deference to her Requests than his; that he con∣jured
her to write to him: And that in fine, she might chuse
either to give him this Satisfaction, or be content to see him
part for <HI>Naples,</HI> where <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was to make some stay. <HI>She
remain'd surprized, and perplext at this Proposal; but knowing he
expected with great Impatience her Determination,</HI> What would
you have me say to him, my Lord? <HI>said she to him with a sor∣rowful
Countenance,</HI> Dictate this Letter to me, I will write it?
I can do no more; and I believe this is more than I ought. <HI>The
Marquess, transported with Joy, most affectionately embrac'd her;
he thank'd her for her Compliance and made her write these Words:</HI></P>
<P>IF you have any Kindness for us, defer not your Return; I
have very urgent Reasons to desire it. I am not a little con∣cern'd
that you shew such Indifference towards us, which is an
unquestionable Indication that you take no Delight in our Com∣pany.
Return, <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> I earnestly wish it; I intreat you:
And if it were fit for me to use more urgent Terms, I would say
perhaps, I command you to do it.</P>
<P><HI>The Marquess made a single Pacquet of this fatal Letter, to
the end</HI> Don Lewis <HI>might not think 'twas by his Order the Mar∣chioness
had wrote it; and having sent it to the Carrier, he ex∣pected
the Success with extraordinary Impatience. What became
of this Lover at the sight of so dear and unexpected an Order!
Although he had remarkt Dispositions of Tenderness in the Coun∣tenance
of this fair Person, yet he dared not promise himself she
could desire his return; his Reason revolted against his Joy:</HI> How
Unhappy a Wretch I am? <HI>said he,</HI> I Adore the most Amiable
of all Women, and yet I dare not offer to please her? she has
a Kindness for me, yet Honour and Friendship with-hold me
from making the least Advantage of it. What shall I do then,
O Heavens! What shall I do! I flatter'd my self, that Absence
would cure me, Alas! this is a Remedy which I have fruit∣lesly
tried; I have never cast mine Eyes on her Picture, but
have found my self more in Love, and more Miserable than
when I saw her every day. I must obey her, she commands my
Return; she desires to see me, and she cannot be ignorant of
my Passion: When I took my Leave of her, my Eyes decla∣red
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
to her the Secret of my Heart: And when I call to mind
what I saw in hers, all my Reflections then are to no purpose; for
I resolve rather to die at her Feet, than to live remote from her.</P>
<P>He parted without any delay, and without taking leave of his
Friends. He left a Gentleman to Excuse him towards them, and to
order his Affairs. He was in such great haste to see the Marchioness,
that he used such Diligence to be with her, that no body but he could
have done: arriving at <HI>Cagliary,</HI> Capital of <HI>Sardagne,</HI> he under∣stood
that the Marquess and his Wife were at a stately Country-house,
where the Vice-Roy was gone to give them a Visit, with all his Court.
He learnt moreover, that the Marquess de <HI>Barbaran</HI> prepared for
him a great Feast, where there were to be held Justs or Turnaments
after the Ancient Manner of the <HI>Mores:</HI> He was the Defendant,
and was to maintain, <HI>That a Husband beloved, is Happier than a
Lover.</HI></P>
<P>Several Gentlemen that were not of this Opinion, were preparing
themselves to go and dispute the Prize, which the Marchioness, at
the Vice-Queen's Intreaty, was to give to the Conqueror; 'Twas a
Scarf embroidered with her own Hands wrought with Cyphers: No
one was to appear but maskt and disguised, to the end all might be
freer and more gallant.</P>
<P><HI>Don Lewis</HI> had a secret Despight, in comprehending the Marquess
so well satisfied, <HI>He is belov'd,</HI> said he, <HI>I cannot but look on him
as my Rival, and as an Happy Rival; but we must endeavour to
disturb his Happiness, in triumphing over his vain Glory.</HI> Ha∣ving
formed this Design, he would not appear in Town; he caus'd
to be made a Suit of strip'd Green Satan, embroidered with Gold,
and all his Liveries were of the same Colour, to denote his new
hopes.</P>
<P>When he entred into the Lists, every body had their Eyes on him;
his Magnificence and his Air gave Emulation to the Cavaliers, and
great Curiosities to the Ladies. The Marchioness felt a secret E∣motion,
of which she could not discover the Cause: He was placed
very near the Belcony, where she sate with the Vice-Queen; but
there was no Lady there which did not lose all her Lustre near that
of the Marchioness; her youthful Air, which exceeded not eighteen
Years, her lovely white and red Cheeks, her Eyes so sweet and grace∣ful,
her Scarlet and little Mouth, agreeable Smile, and her Shape,
which surpast the Fairest, made her the Admiration of all the
World.</P>
<P><HI>Don Lewis</HI> was so ravish'd in seeing her so charming, and to ob∣serve
yet in her Countenance a languishing sorrowful Air, that he
flattered himself to have therein a part, and this was the first
Moment wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ein he thought himself Happy. When his turn came,
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
he ran against the Marquess, and smote him so dextrously, that he got
the Advantage all along of him: so that in a word, he gain'd the
Prize with a general Applause, and with every one's good liking.
He threw himself at the Marchioness's Feet, to receive it at her
Hands; he altered the Tone of his Voice, and speaking to her with
his Mask on, low enough not to be heard but only by her: <HI>Divine
Person,</HI> said he to her, <HI>be pleas'd to observe what Fortune de∣cides
in favour of Lovers.</HI> He dar'd not to say more to her; and
without knowing him, she gave him the Prize, with the natural
Grace with which all her Actions were accompanied.</P>
<P>He suddenly withdrew himself, for fear of being known; for this
might have been an occasion of Quarrel between the Marquess and
him: and without doubt he would not have easily pardon'd the Victo∣ry
he obtain'd over him This oblig'd him to keep himself still con∣ceal'd
for some Days. The Vice-Roy and his Lady return'd to <HI>Cagli∣ary,</HI>
and the Marquess and Marchioness accompanied them thither,
with the whole Court.</P>
<P>Don Lewis <HI>then shew'd himself; he pretended he just then ar∣riv'd,
and made as if he knew not what had past in the Field.
The Marquess</HI> de Barbaran <HI>was transported with Joy in seeing him:
and Absence had not at all altered the Affection, he had for this dear
Relation. He had no difficult task to find a favourable moment
wherein to entertain his amiable Marchioness, he had as much liber∣ty
in their Lodgings as in his own; and you may well judge, Madam,
that he forgot not to mention the Prize he had receiv'd from her fair
Hands:</HI> How wretched am I, <HI>said he to her,</HI> that you did not
know me? Alas, Madam, I flattered my self, that by some se∣cret
Presentiments you would learn that no one but I could su∣stain
with such Passion the Cause of Lovers against Husbands
No my Lord, <HI>said she to him, with an Angry and Disdainful Air
to take away all Hope from him,</HI> I could never have imagin'd
that you could have been Patroon of so foul a Cause; and I could
not have believ'd you could have taken such strong Engage∣ments
at <HI>Naples,</HI> that you should come as far as <HI>Sardagne</HI> to
Triumph over a Friend who maintain'd my Interests as well as
his own. I shall die with Regret, Madam, <HI>said</HI> Don Lewis, if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have displeas'd you in what I have done; and were you more
favourably disposed, and I might dare to make you my Confi∣dent,
it would be no hard matter for me to perswade you, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it is not at <HI>Naples</HI> I have left the Object of my Vows.</P>
<P>The Marchioness apprehending least he should speak more than sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was willing to hear, and appear livelily toucht with the Reproac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
she made him, she put on a more pleasing Countenance, and tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
the Conversation into a Tone of Railery, answer'd him, <HI>He took
too seriously what she had said to him.</HI> He dared not make use of
this occasion to declare his Love to her; for though he lov'd her above
all things, yet he respected her no less.</P>
<P><HI>When he had left her, he began to blame himself for his Fearfulness:</HI>
Shall I, <HI>said he,</HI> always suffer without seeking any Remedy! <HI>It was
some time before he could meet with a favourable occasion, because the
Marchioness studiously avoided him; but being come one Night where
she was, he found her alone in an inward Room, lying on a bed in a
most lovely manner, and most becoming Ʋndress, her Hair being fast∣ned
with Knots of Diamonds, hung carelesly about her Breasts: The
Trouble she felt in seeing</HI> Don Lewis, <HI>appear'd on her Countenance,
and rendred her yet more lovely: He drew near her with an Awful
and respectful Air, fell down on his Knees by her; he lookt on her
for some time, not daring to speak; but becoming a little more bold,</HI>
If you consider, Madam, <HI>said he to her,</HI> the pitious Condition
whereunto you have reduced me, you will easily comprehend
that it is no longer in my power to keep Silence: I could not a∣void
such inevitable Stroaks as you have given me; I have ado∣red
you as soon as I saw you: I have endeavour'd to Cure my
self in flying from you; I have offered the greatest Violence to
my self, in endeavouring to master my Passion. You have re∣call'd
me, Madam, from my Voluntary Exile, and I die a
thousand times a Day, uncertain of my Destiny: If you
be Cruel enough to refuse me your Pity, suffer at least,
that having made known to you my Passion, I may die
with Crief at your Feet. <HI>The Marchioness was some time
without resolving to answer him; but at length, gaining assu∣rance,</HI>
I acknowledge, <HI>said she, Don Lewis,</HI> that I am not
wholly ignorant of one part of your Sentiments, but I was wil∣ling
to perswade my self 'twas the Effects of an Innocent affecti∣on:
Make me not a Partner of your Crime; you commit one,
when you betray the Friendship due to my Husband: But, alas,
you will pay but too dearly for this; for I know that Duty forbids
you to Love me; and in respect, it does not only forbid me to
love you, but to fly from you: I will do it, <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> I will a∣void
you; and I do not know, whether I ought not to Hate you.
But, alas, it seems impossible to me to do it. What do you then,
Madam, <HI>answer'd he, interrupting her, being full of Grief and De∣spair,</HI>
when you pronounce the Sentence of my Death? You can∣not
Hate me say you: Do you not hate me, and do you not do
me all the Mischief you are able, when you resolve to avoid me?
Make an end, Madam, make an end, leave not your Venge∣ance
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
imperfect; sacrifice me to your Duty, and your Husband;
for my Life cannot but be odious, if you take from me the
Hopes of pleasing you. <HI>She lookt on him at this instant with
Eyes full of languishing: Don Lewis, said she to him,</HI> you re∣proach
me with what I would deserve. <HI>In ending these words,
she arose, fearing greatly, lest her Affection should triumph over
her Reason; and notwithstanding his endeavours to with-hold her,
she past into a Chamber where her Women were.</HI></P>
<P>She thought she had gained much on her self in forcing her way
out of this Conversation, without answering so favourably as her
Heart could have wisht; but Love is a Seducer, which must not
be in any sort hearkened to, if one will not be totally overcome by
him. From that day <HI>Don Lewis</HI> began to think himself Happy,
though he wanted many things to compleat his Felicity. The Mar∣chioness,
in effect, had a Principle of Virtue, which opposed it self al∣ways
with Success to the desires of her Lover.</P>
<P>He had no longer those Scruples of Friendship for the Marquess <HI>de
Barbaran</HI> which had so greatly disturbed his Mind; Love had per∣fectly
banisht Friendship; nay, he even secretly hated him.</P>
<P>In fine, <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> flattering himself, that perhaps he might find
a favourable moment to affect the Marchioness's Heart with some Pi∣ty;
he carefully sought it; and to find it, when one day when 'twas
very hot, knowing that the Marchioness was wont to retire to Repose
her self after Dinner, as it is customary, in that Country, he came to
her, doubting not but every body was asleep in the House.</P>
<P>She was in a Ground-Room which lookt into the Garden; all was
fast and shut close, save a little Window, whereby he saw on her Bed
this Charming Creature: She was in a profound Sleep, half un∣drest;
he had the time to discover such Beauties as still augment∣ed
the force of his Passion. He approacht so softly to her, that she
did not awake: It was already some moments that he had lookt
on her with all the Transports of a Man amazed, when seeing her
naked Breasts, he could not forbear kissing them. She arose on a
sudden, she had not her Eyes open, the Chamber was dark, and
she could never have believ'd <HI>Don Lewis</HI> could have been so bold.
I have already told you, Madam, that he resembled the Marquess
<HI>de Barbaran:</HI> She did not doubt then but it was he, and calling
him several times, <HI>her dear Marquess and Husband,</HI> she tenderly
embrac'd him. He well knew his Error, whatever Pleasure it
procured him, he could have wished to have ow'd this only to his
Mistress's Favours. But, O Heavens, how unfortunately it hap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed!
The Marquess came in this dangerous moment; and
'twas not without the greatest fury he saw the Liberty <HI>Don
Lewis</HI> took with his Wife. At the noise he had made in entring,
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
she had turn'd her Eyes towards the Door, and seeing her Husband
enter, whom she thought she had already in her Arms, it is im∣possible
to represent her Affliction and Astonishment.</P>
<P><HI>Don Lewis</HI> amaz'd at this Accident, flatter'd himself, that per∣haps
he was not known: He past immediately into the Gallery, and
finding a Window was opened into the Garden, he threw himself
out of it, and immediately past through a Back-door. The Mar∣quess
pursued him, without being able to overtake him: In return∣ing
the same way he came, he unhappily found the Marchioness's
Picture, which <HI>Don Lewis</HI> had dropt as he ran; he immediately
made most cruel Reflections hereupon: This Picture of his Wife,
which <HI>Don Lewis</HI> had let fall, and the sight of her embracing him,
all this made him no longer doubt of his Wives Falshood: <HI>I am be∣tray'd</HI>
Cry'd he, <HI>by her whom I loved dearer than my own
Life: Was there ever a more Unhappy Man in the World?</HI>
In ending these Words, he returned to his Wives Chamber. She im∣mediately
threw her self at his Feet, and melting into Tears,
would have justify'd her self, and made known to him her Innocency;
but the Spirit of Jealousie had so fully possest him, that he vio∣lently
represt her: He harkned only to the Transports of his Rage
and Despair, and turning away his Eyes, that he might not see so
lovely an Object, he had the Barbarity to strike his Dagger into the
Breast of the most Beautiful and most Vertuous Woman in the World.
She offered her self to be slaughtered as an innocent Sacrifice, and
her Soul issued out in a stream of Blood.</P>
<P>O God, <HI>cryed I,</HI> O Imprudent <HI>Don Lewis!</HI> Why did you
leave this Charming Lady to the Fury of an Amorous Husband,
transported with Jealousie! You might have snatch'd her out of
his cruel Hands. Alas, Madam, <HI>replied this Gentleman,</HI> he
knew not what he did; for what he would have done at another
time to have prevented such a Misfortune.</P>
<P>As soon as the unfortunate Marchioness had rendred her last
Breath,* her cruel Executioner shut her Apartment, took all the
Money and Jewels he had, mounted on Horseback, and fled with
all the speed he could. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> restless, and more Amorous
than ever, returned thither in the Evening, notwithstanding what∣ever
might befal him: He was surpriz'd when he was told the
Marchioness was still asleep, he immediately went into the Garden,
and entred into the Gallery, through the same Window which he
had found open, and from thence came into the Chamber: 'Twas
so dark, that he was fain to walk warily; when he felt some∣thing
which had like to have made him fall, he stooped down and
found it was a dead Body; he uttered a great Shriek, and doubt∣ing
not but it was that of his dear Mistress, he sunk down with
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
Grief: Some of the Marchioness's Women walking under the Win∣dows
of her apartment, heard <HI>Don Lewis</HI>'s Crys; they easily got up
through the same Window, and entred the Room. What a sad Specta∣cle,
what a lamentable sight was this? I cannot find Words to de∣note
to you the Horror of this Spectacle, <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was no sooner
come to himself, by the force of Remedies, but his Grief, Rage and
Despair, broke out with such Violence, that it was impossible to
calm him; and I am perswaded he had not out-lived her whose
loss he occasioned, if the desire of Vengeance had not re-animated
him.</P>
<P>He parted like one furious in search of the Marquess <HI>de Barbaran;</HI>
He sought him every-where without hearing any news of him, H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ran over <HI>Italy,</HI> traverst <HI>Germany,</HI> came into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and past in∣to
<HI>France.</HI> He was told that the Marquess was at <HI>Valentia</HI> in
<HI>Spain;</HI> he came there, and met not with him. In fine, three Years
being past, without finding the means of Sacrificing his Enemy to
his Mistress's Ghost, Divine Grace, which is irresistible, and par∣ticularly
on great Souls toucht his so efficaciously, that he imme∣diately
changed his Desire of Revenge into serious Desires of
leaving the World, and minded only the fitting himself for another
Life.</P>
<P>Being fill'd with this Spirit he returned into <HI>Sardagnia.</HI> He
sold all his Estate, which he distributed among some of his Friends,
who with great Merit were yet very poor; and by this means
became so poor himself, that he reduced himself to the begging of
Alms.</P>
<P>He had heretofore seen in going to <HI>Madrid,</HI> a place very fit to make
an Hermitage, (it is towards <HI>Mount Dragon</HI>) this Mountain is
almost inaccessible, and you cannot pass to it but through an Overture▪
which is in the midst of a great Rock; it is stopt up when the Snow
falls, and the Hermitage lies buried more than six Months under
it. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> made one be built here, where he was wont to pass
whole Years without seeing any one. He made such Provisions as
were necessary, having good Books, and thus remain'd in this disma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Solitude▪ but this Year his Friends forced him hither, by reason of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
great Sickness, which had like to have cost him his Life. It is fou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Years since he has led this Holy Spiritual Life, and so different from
that to which he was born, that it is with great trouble he sees any o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his Acquaintance.</P>
<P>As to the Marquess <HI>de Barbaran,</HI> he has wholly left the Isle of
<HI>Sardagnia,</HI> where he has not the Liberty to return. I am inform'd
he is married again at <HI>Anvers,</HI> to a Widow of a <HI>Spaniard</HI> name<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Fonccea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36"/>
And it is he himself that has related to one of my Friends the
Particularities of his Crime; and he is so furiously tortured with the
remembrance of it, that he imagines he continually sees his Wife dy∣ing,
and reproaching him with his Fury and Jealousie. In a word,
he has contracted such a deep Melancholy, that his Death is thought
by every one to be near, or at the least, the loss of his Sen∣ces.</P>
<P>The Gentleman here was silent; and I not being able to for∣bear
weeping at so Tragical a Relation, <HI>Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI>
who had observ'd it, and would not take notice of it, for fear of
interrupting the Relation, rally'd me about my Tenderness, tel∣ling
me how well he was pleased to find me so Compassionate,
and that I should not be long before I met with Objects fit to
exercise it on. I did not so much mind the returning an An∣swer
to him, as the Thanking this Gentleman, who was pleas'd
to entertain me with the Recital of so extraordinary an Adven∣ture:
I intreated him to make my Compliments to <HI>Don Lewis,</HI>
and to give him from me two Pistols, seeing he lived on Alms.
<HI>Don Fernand,</HI> and each of the Cavaliers, gave as much: <HI>Here is,</HI>
said the Gentleman to us, <HI>wherewith to enrich the Poor of</HI> Victoria;
<HI>for</HI> Don Lewis <HI>appropriates not such great Charities as these to him∣self.</HI>
We told him, he was the Master, and might dispose of
the Money as he pleased. But to return to my Adventures:</P>
<P>Although I had a Pasport from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the best
specified, and most general, as is possible, yet I was oblig'd to
take a Billet from the Toll-House; for without this Precaution,
all my Cloaths had been confiscated: <HI>To what purpose then is
my Pasport?</HI> said I to them. <HI>To none at all,</HI> replied they.
The Surveyers and Officers of the Customs would not so much
as cast their Eyes on it; they told me, the King must come
and assure them, that this Order was from him. It is to no
purpose for any one to alledge his being a Stranger, and igno∣rant
of the Usages of the Country: For they drily answer, <HI>That
the Stranger's Ignorance makes the</HI> Spaniard'<HI>s Profit.</HI> The ill
weather has kept me here two Days, during which I saw the
Governess, and the Play. The principal place of this Town
is adorn'd with a very fair Fountain standing in the midst: it
is incircled with the Town-House, the Prison, two Convents,
and several well built Houses: Here is a New Town and an Old
one; every body forsakes this latter to dwell in the other.
Here are very rich Merchants; their chief Trade is at St. <HI>Se∣bastian</HI>
or <HI>Bilbo;</HI> they send great store of Iron to <HI>Grenada, Estre∣madour,
Galicia,</HI> and other Parts of the Kingdom. I observ'd,
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
that the great Streets are set with fine Trees, which are water∣ed
with Streams running by them. From <HI>Mount St. Adrian</HI>
hither, it is seven Leagues. In fine, I am just setting out, and
must end this long Letter; it is late, and I have spoke to you
so much of what I have seen, that I have said nothing of my
Affections to you: Believe me, however, Dear Cosen, that I
am, and ever shall be</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>MY Letters are so long, that it is hard to believe when I
finish them, that I have any thing else more to tell you;
yet my dear Cosen, I never close any, but there remains still
sufficient for another: When I were only to speak to you of
my Friendship, this would be an inexhaustible Subject; you
may make some Judgment of it from the Pleasure I find in obey∣ing
your Commands. You are desirous to know all the Parti∣culars
of my Voyage, I will therefore go on to relate them:</P>
<P>I set out very late from <HI>Victoria,</HI> by reason of my stay at the
Governess's, whom I before mention'd: and we went to lie at
<HI>Miranda;</HI> the Country is very pleasant as far as <HI>Avigny;</HI> we
came afterwards by a difficult Way to the Banks of the River
<HI>Ʋrola,</HI> whose Noise is the greater, in that 'tis full of Rocks,
on which the Water dashes, beats up, and falls down, and
forms several Gascades in several places: We continu'd to as∣cend
the high Mountains of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> where we ran a thou∣sand
several Dangers: we saw the ancient Ruines of an old
Castle, where Ghosts and Spirits have their Apartments, as well
as in that of <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ara,</HI> it is near <HI>Gargason;</HI> and being to stop
there to shew my Pasport, because here certain Customs are
paid to the King, I learnt from the Alcade of the Borough,
who drew near my Litter to talk with me, that it is the com∣mon
Report of the Country, That there were formerly a King
and a Queen here, who had so fine and beautiful a Woman to
their Daughter, that she was rather taken for a Goddess than
a Mortal Creature: she was call'd <HI>Mira▪</HI> and it is from her
Name came the <HI>Mira</HI> of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which is to say, <HI>Look
you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> for as soon as ever she appear'd, all the People attentively
beheld her and cryed out, <HI>Mira, Mira;</HI> and here's the Etymo∣logy
of a Word drawn far enough. This Princess was never
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
seen by any Body who became not desperately in love with her;
but her Disdainfulness and Indifference made all her Lovers
pine away: The famous Basilisk never kill'd so many People as
the Beautiful and Dreadful <HI>Mira;</HI> she thus depopulated her Fa∣ther's
Kingdom, and all the Countries thereabouts were full
of the deceased and dying Lovers. After they had in vain Ad∣drest
themselves to her, they lastly applied themselves to Hea∣ven,
to demand Vengeance on her Cruelty: The Gods at length
grew Angry, and the Goddesses were not much behind them
in the Exercise of this Passion: so that to punish her, the
Scourges of Heaven finish'd the Destruction of her Father's
Kingdom: In this general Calamity he consulted the Oracle,
which told him, <HI>That all these Miseries would not have an end,
till</HI> Mira <HI>had expiated the Mischiefs which her Eyes had done:
and that she must be gone, that Destiny would conduct her to the
place where she was to lose her repose and liberty.</HI> The Princess
obey'd, believing it impossible for her to be touch'd with
Tenderness: She carried only her Nurse with her; she was
clad like a simple Shepherdess, lest she should be taken notice
of, whether at Sea or Land. She ran over a great Part of the
World, committing every Day two or three Dozen of Mur∣thers;
for her Beauty was not diminisht by the Fatigue of her
Travels: She arriv'd at length near this old Castle, which be∣long'd
to a young Count call'd <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os,</HI> endowed with a thousand
Perfections, but extream proud and Reserv'd: he spent his
time in the Woods; as soon as ever he perceiv'd a Woman,
he fled from her, and of all things he saw in the World, she
was his greatest Aversion. The beautiful <HI>Mira</HI> was resting
her self one day under the shade of some Trees, when <HI>Nios</HI> past
by, cloathed with a Lyon's Skin, a Bow at his Girdle, and a
Mace on his Shoulder, his Hair was all clotted together, and
his Face besmeared like a Chimney Sweeper's, (this Circum∣stance
is observable) yet the Princess thought him the most
handsome Man in the World; she ran after him as if she had
been mad, and he ran from her as if he had been in the same
condition; she lost the sight of him; she knew not where to
find him: she is now in the greatest Sorrow, weeping Day and
Night with her Nurse. <HI>Nios</HI> return'd to the Chase; she saw
him again, and would have follow'd him: as soon as he per∣ceiv'd
her, he did as at first, and <HI>Mira</HI> betook her self again to
her Lamentations; but her Passion giving her new strength,
she out-ran him, stopt him, taking hold of his Locks, intre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣ing
him to look on her, thinking this was enough to engage
him: He cast his Eyes on her with as much Indifference a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
if she had been an ordinary Person. Never Woman was more
surprized; she would not leave him; she came maugre him to
his Castle: where, as soon as she had entred, he there left
her, and was no more seen. The poor <HI>Mira,</HI> being not to be
comforted, died with Grief, and from that time you hear
deep Sighs and Groans, which come from the Castle of <HI>Nios.</HI>
The young Wenches of the Country are used to go there, and
carry her little Presents of Fruits and Milk, which they set down
at the Mouth of a Cave, where no body dares enter: they said,
this was to comfort her; but this has been abolisht as superstiti∣ons.
And though I believed not a word of whatever was told
me at <HI>Garganson,</HI> in Relation to <HI>Mira</HI> and <HI>Nios,</HI> yet I was pleas'd
in the Recital of this Story, of which I omit a thousand Particu∣lars,
for fear of tiring you by its length. My Waiting-Woman
was so affected with this Relation, that she was for having us re∣turn
back again, to set at the Mouth of the Cave some red Par∣tridges,
which my People had bought: she imagined the Prin∣cess's
Ghost would be mightily comforted in receiving this Testi∣mony
of our good Will; but for my part, I thought I should be
more content than her, in having those Partridges for my Sup∣per.
We past the River of <HI>Ʋrola,</HI> on a great stone Bridge, and
having went over another, with difficulty enough, by rea∣son
of the melted Snow, we arrived at <HI>Miranda d' Embro;</HI> this is
a great Village, or a little Town: here is a place adorned with a
Fountain; the River <HI>Ebro</HI> which is one of the most considerable
of <HI>Spain,</HI> traverses it. You see on the Top of a Mountain the
Castle, with several Towers; it appears to be of some strength;
and there issues out so great a Stream from a Rock on which it is
built, that it turns several Mills, I could not observe any thing
else worth writing to you.</P>
<P>The three Knights I spake of to you, were arrived before
me, and given all requisite Orders for Supper; so we eat to∣gether;
And tho' the Night appeared well advanced, because
the Days are short in this Season, 'twas not late; so that
these Gentlemen, who shewed me great Respect and Civility,
askt me, How I would pass the time? I proposed to them the
playing at <HI>Ombre,</HI> and that I would go Halyes with <HI>Don Fernand
de Toledo.</HI> They accepted the Offer: <HI>Don Fernand de Cardonne</HI>
said, He had rather Converse with me than Play: so the three
others began, and I for some time gave my self over to the
looking on them, with great Pleasure, for their Way is quite
different from ours: They never utter a word; I do not say,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o complain, (for this would be unworthy the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gravity)
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
but to demand a <HI>Gano,</HI> or to cut higher, or to shew that one
may take some other Advantage: In a word, they seem to be
Statues of Pieces of <HI>German</HI> Clock-work, never appearing trans∣ported
with either good or bad Luck. Among other Discourse
which I had with <HI>Don Frederick de Cardonne,</HI> he told me, There
were two observable things in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> one of which is a Moun∣tain
of Salt, partly white as Snow, and the other part clearer and
more transparent than Chrystal: that there is Blue, Green, Vio∣let,
Orange, and a thousand different Colours, which yet loses
its tincture when wetted, it continually forms it self, and grows
there: and though commonly the places where Salt is to be
found, are so barren, that you see not so much as an Herb, yet
there are here Pine-Trees of great height, and excellent Vine∣yards:
When the Sun darts its Rays on this Mountain, it looks
as if it wholly consisted of the most precious Stones in the World:
but the best of it is, that it yields a good Revenue.</P>
<P><HI>The other particular he mentioned to me, was of a Foun∣tain,
whose Water is very good, and of the same Colour as
Claret,</HI> I have never heard any thing of this, <HI>said I to him,</HI> but
one of my Relations, who has been in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> has assured me
there is a Fountain near <HI>Balut,</HI> whose Water is as others are for
Colour, and yet whatever you put therein, appears like Gold. I
have seen it, Madam, <HI>continued</HI> Don Fredric; and I remember
a Man that was tery covetous, and more foolish, went thither every
day to put therein his Silver, hoping in time 'twould be chang'd
into Gold: but he was so far from enriching himself, that he was
ruin'd; for some Peasants more subtle and crafty than he, having
perceived what he did, stood watching a little lower, and the
Stream of the Water would now and then brring some Pieces to
them. If you return into <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Catalonia, added he,</HI> you
will see this Fountain. It is not that which can draw me thither,
<HI>replyed I,</HI> but the desire of passing by <HI>Montfe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at,</HI> would make
me undertake a longer Journey. It is situated, <HI>said he,</HI> near
<HI>Barcelona,</HI> and is a place of great Devotion: It seems as if the
Rock were sawed through the middle; the Church stands high,
is small and obscure. By the help of Fourscore and Ten Lamps of
Silver, you perceive the Image of the Virgin, which looks very
duskish, and is held for Miraculous. The Altar cost <HI>Philip</HI> the
Second thirty thousand Crowns; and here is every day seen Pilgrims
from all Parts of the World, this Holy Place abounds with Her∣mitages,
inhabited by Persons of great Devotion: These are com∣monly
Men of good Birth, who have not left the World till they have
well tryed it, and who appear much taken with the Sweets of
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
their Retirements, though the Place be dismal; and 'twould been
impossible to have had Access to it, had not a Passage been cut
through the Rocks. Yet you find here several agreeable Objects,
a curious Prospect, various Springs, Gardens well drest by these
Religioses own hands, and every where a certain Air of Solitude
and Devotion, which mightly effect those who come there. We
have another famous place of Devotion, <HI>added he,</HI> and that is
<HI>Nuestra Senora del Pilar:</HI> it is at <HI>Saragossa,</HI> in a Chappel on a
Pillar of Marble, where our Lady holds the Babe Jesus in her
Arms. It is pretended, that the Virgin appeared on this same Pil∣lar
to Sr. <HI>James;</HI> and the Image is here worshipt with great Reve∣rence.
It cannot be well observ'd, because it stands so high, and
in a very dark place; so that without the Flambeaux it could not
be seen at all. Here are always Fifty Lamps burning; Gold and
precious Stones shine here on all sides; and the Pilgrims came here
in great Sholes. But yet, <HI>says he,</HI> I may truly say, in favour of
<HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ragosi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that 'tis one of the finest Towns you shall see; It is situa∣ted
along the <HI>Ebre</HI> in a vast Field, is adorn'd with great Build∣ings,
rich Churches, a stately Bridge, fine open Palaces, and the
most charming Women in the World, who love <HI>French,</HI> and will
omit nothing to oblige you to speak well of them, if you pass by there.
<HI>I told him, I had already heard several things spoken of them
to their commendation:</HI> But <HI>continu'd I,</HI> this Country is very
Barren, and the Souldiers can hardly subsist in it. In effect, <HI>re∣plied
he,</HI> whether the Air be bad, or that they want Necessaries
the <HI>Flemmings</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> cannot live there? and if they do not,
die there, 'tis because they run away. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Neopolitans</HI>
are more prone than they to desert; these last past through <HI>France,</HI>
to return into their Country; the others Coast the <HI>Pyrenees</HI> along
<HI>Langued<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c,</HI> and enter <HI>Castile</HI> by <HI>Navarre,</HI> or <HI>Biscaye.</HI> This is
a Course which the old Souldiers fail not to steer; for the new∣rais'd
ones, they perish in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> being not accustomed there∣to;
and 'tis certain, there's no place where War is more trouble∣some
to the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> He maintains his Forces here with
great Charge, and the Advantage which the Enemy gains of him
is not small; and I very well know they are more sensible at <HI>Ma∣drid</HI>
for the smallest Loss in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> than they would be for the
greatest in <HI>Flanders,</HI> or <HI>Milan,</HI> or else where. But at present,
<HI>continues he,</HI> we are going to be more at our Ease than we have
been, being expected at Court, that the Peace will be lasting,
because they talk much of a Marriage which will make a new Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iance;
and the Marquess <HI>de Los Balbares,</HI> Plenipotentiary at
<HI>Nimiguen,</HI> has receiv'd Orders to pass speedily to <HI>France,</HI> to de∣mand
of that King, <HI>Mademoiselle d' Orleans,</HI> therefore it is not
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
doubted but the Marriage will be concluded: But it is thought ve∣ry
strange, <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> should consent to this Marriage. You
will do me a singular Pleasure, <HI>said I, interrupting him,</HI> if you
would inform me of some Particularities touching this Prince: It is
natural for to have a Curiosity in relation to Persons of his Cha∣racter;
and when a body comes into a Court where one was never
before, that I may not appear a Novice, I should have some previous
Notices. <HI>He Answered me, it would be a great satisfaction to
him, if he could relate any thing might please me, and he began
thus:</HI></P>
<P>You will not, perhaps Madam, think it amiss, that I begin at the
Original of Things, and tell you, That this Prince was Son of one of
the finest Women in <HI>Spain,</HI> named <HI>Maria Calderona;</HI> she was a
Player; and the Duke <HI>de Medina de las Torres,</HI> became desperately
in love with her: This Cavalier had so many Advantages above others,
that <HI>Calderona,</HI> lov'd him no less than she was beloved by him.
In the Heat of this Intrigue, <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth saw her, and pre∣ferr'd
her to one of the Queen's Maids of Honour, and who was so
grieved at this Change of the King, whom she really loved, and had
a Son by, that she retired from the World, and betook her self to
<HI>Los del Calsas Reales,</HI> where she put on the Religio's Habit. As
for <HI>Calderonne,</HI> her Inclination lying wholly towards the <HI>Duke de
Medina,</HI> she would not hearken to the King, without the Duke
would thereto consent: She spake to him of it, and offered to with∣draw
secretly where he would; but the Duke fearing to incur the
King's Displeasure, answer'd her, He was resolv'd to yield up to his
Majesty a Treasure which he was not in a Capacity to contend for.
She made him a thousand Reproaches for this, she call'd him Traytor
to his Love, ingrateful towards his Mistress: And moreover, told
him, That though he was so Happy, as that he could dispose of his
Heart as he pleased, yet she could not do the same; and therefore he
must continue to visit her, or prepare to see her die with Despair▪
The Duke affected with so great a Passion, promised to feign a Journey
to <HI>Andalousia,</HI> and to remain with her hid in a Closet: he effectu∣ally
parted from the Court, and afterwards shut himself up (as it
was agreed) whatever Risque he ran by so imprudent Conduct. The
King, in the mean time, was very Amorous, and remain'd very well
satisfi'd: She had, during this, <HI>Don John<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d' Austria,</HI> and the
Resemblance he had with the Duke <HI>de Medina de las Torres,</HI> had
made it be thought that he was his Son; but tho' the King had other
Children, and particularly the Bishop of <HI>Malaga,</HI> good Fortune decided
in his Favour, and he has been only acknowledg'd.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI>'s Friends say, That 'twas by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Exchange
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
which had been made of the Son of <HI>Calderonna,</HI> for the Son of Queen
<HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and here's how they set forth this Change, which is a
Story made on purpose to impose on the World, and which I believe has
no ground of Truth: They pretend, the King being desperately in
love with this Player, she became big with Child at the same time as
the Queen; and seeing the King's Passion was so greatly towards her,
that she might expect any thing, she so ordered it, that she made him
promise
her, That if the Queen had a Son, and she likewise, he should
put hers in his place: <HI>What will you lose by this Sir?</HI> said she,
<HI>Will it not be your Son that will still Reign, only with this diffe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence,
that loving me, as you say you do, you will love him like∣wise
the better.</HI> She had Wit, and the King could deny her nothing;
be consented, and in effect the Business was manag'd with that Ad∣dress,
that the Queen being brought to Bed of a Son, and <HI>Calderonna</HI>
of another, the Exchange was made. He that should have Reign'd,
and who bore the Name of <HI>Baltazar,</HI> died at the Age of fourteen
Years: The King was told, 'twas with over heating himself at Ten∣nis;
but the truth is, this Prince was suffered to keep bad Company,
which procured him his Misfortunes; it is said likewise, That <HI>Don
Pedro de Arragon,</HI> his Governour, and chief Gentleman of his
Chamber, more contributed to this than any other, suffering him
to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng into his Apartment a Woman he loved; after this he was
taken with a violent Feaver, and concealed the Occasion: The Phy∣sicians,
who were ignorant of it, thought to ease him by frequent
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leedings, which put an end to what strength he had; and by this
means they ended his Life. The King knowing but too late, what
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, banisht <HI>Don Pedro</HI> for not hindring this Excess, or for
not having timely d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scover<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> who was brought up
as the Natural Son. changed not his Condition, though this ought to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been, had be been indeed the lawful Son; yet notwithstanding
this, his Creatures aff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m, He so exactly resembles Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat she needs no other Picture of her likeness. And this Opinion fails
not of gai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elief with the People, who run violently after Novel∣ties▪
and whose pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely loved this great Queen, that they bewail
her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as if she was but now deceas'd. It is true, that if <HI>Don
John</HI> of <HI>Austri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> would make his advantage of the favourable Dispo∣sitions
of the People, he has met with several Opportunities of ex∣tending
his Fortune very f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; but his only Aim is to serve the King,
and to keep his Subjects in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Sentiments of Fidelity they ought to
have for him.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lderonna:</HI> The King surprized one day the Duke
<HI>de Medi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> with her, and in the excess of his Rage, be ran to
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im with his Poynard in his Hand; he was about to kill him, when
this Woman placed her self between, telling him, He might strike her
if he would. Having the most extream Passion for her, he could not
but pardon him, contenting himself only with banishing him: But un∣derstanding
she continued to love him, and write to him, he st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diea on∣ly
how to get a new Passion; when he had one strong enough not to
apprehend the Charms of <HI>Calderonna,</HI> he sent word to her to retire in∣to
a Monastery, as is customary when the King forsakes his Mistress.
She put it not off, writing a Letter to the Duke to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him Adieu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
And she receiv'd the Veil of a Religio from the Hand of the Apost<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lick
Nuncio, who became since <HI>Innocent X.</HI> It is very likely the
King believ'd <HI>Don John</HI> was his real Son, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing he loved him so
dearly: One thing will appear to you very si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ular, which is, that
a King of <HI>Spain</HI> having natural Sons owned by him, they never en∣tred
<HI>Madrid</HI> during his Life: So <HI>Don John</HI> was brought up at <HI>O∣canna,</HI>
which is some Leagues distant from it. The King, his Father,
came oft thither, and he made him come even to the Gates of the
Town, where he went to meet him. This custom comes from that
the Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> dispute the Rank which these Princes would
hold. <HI>Don John,</HI> before he went into <HI>Catalonia,</HI> remained common∣ly
at <HI>Buen Retiro,</HI> which is the Royal Seat at one of the farthest
parts of <HI>Madrid,</HI> a little without the Gate: And he shew'd him∣self
so little, that he was never seen at any Publick Feast during the
Life of the late King: but since, times have changed, and his For∣tunes
stands on a different bottom.</P>
<P>Whilst the Queen, <HI>Maria Ann</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> Sister to the Emperour,
and the King's Mother, Govern'd <HI>Spain,</HI> and her Son was not yes
of Age to hold the Reigns of the State. She would have always <HI>Don
John</HI> keep from the Court, and moreover, found her self so capable
of Governing, that she had a mind to ease her Son for a long time of
the Burden of Ruling. She was not troubled to see him ignorant of
whatever might give a desire of Reigning: but though she brought
the greatest Precautions, to hinder him from feeling he was under too
strict a Tutelage, and suffering no Persons to come near him, but those
she was well assured of; yet this hindred not but some of the King's
Faithful Servants hazarded themselves, by giving him to understand
what he might do for his Liberty. He followed the Advice was gi∣ven
him, and in sine, having taken Measures accordingly, he stole a∣way
one Night, and went to <HI>Buen Retiro.</HI> He as soon sent from
thence an Order to the Queen his Mother, not to stir out of the Pa∣lace.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> is of a middle Stature, well shaped, Black and
lively Eyes, and a most Manly Countenance. He is Polite, Gene∣rous,
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
and very Brave. He is ignorant of nothing befitting his Birth,
being well verst in all Arts and Sciences. He writes and speaks ve∣ry
well five Languages, and understands yet more. He has for a
long time studied Judicial Astrology. There is no Instrument which he
cannot make, and use with the best Masters. He works on all kinds
of Mechanicks, makes Arms, and paints finely. He took a great
Pleasure in the Mathematicks; but being charg'd with the Govern∣ment
of the State, he has been oblig'd to lay aside all other Em∣ployments.</P>
<P>He came to <HI>Buen Betiro</HI> in the beginning of the Year 1677. and
as soon as he was the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he sent the Queen Mother to <HI>Toledo,</HI> be∣cause
she had declared against him, and hindred his return to the
King. <HI>Don John</HI> had an extream Joy in receiving from the King's
own Hand an Order to take Care of every thing, and to manage the
Affairs of the Kingdom: And 'twas not without occasion he discharg'd
himself on him, seeing he then was ignorant of the Art of Reigning.
It was alledg'd for a Reason of his slow Education, That the King
his Father was dying when he gave him Life: That when he came
into the World, they were fain to put him in a Box of Cotten, being
so tender and small, that he could not be swadled: That he was
brought up in the Arms, and on the Knees of the Ladies of the Palace,
till he was Ten Years old, without putting his Foot once all this
while on the Ground to walk: That in the Sequel the Queen his Mo∣ther,
who was engaged by all the Ties of natural Duty to preserve
this only Heir of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Branch, fearing to lose him, dared not
let him study, lest by too great an Application he should lose his Health,
which in truth was very unsound: And 'twas observ'd, that the
great Number of Women, with whom the King always was, and who
too sharply reprehended him for his Faults which he committed, had
inspired him with such a great Aversion to them, that as soon as ever
he had notice a Lady staid for him in any place he was to pass, he
stole another way, or kept himself shut up all day in his Chamber.
The Marchioness <HI>de Los Veles,</HI> who was his Governess, told me,
she waited for an Opportunity full six Months to speak with him,
and when Chance had brought them unavoidably to him, he took
their Requests from their Hands, but turn'd his H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad another way,
for fear he should see them. His Health is since so increased, that
his Marriage with the Arch-Dutchess, the Emperor's Daughter,
having been broke off by <HI>Don John,</HI> by reason 'twas the Queen-Mothers
Project, he has desired to marry <HI>Mademoiselle d' Orleans.</HI>
The Circumstances of the Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce which are lately concluded at <HI>Ni∣miguen,</HI>
made him cast his Eyes towards this? <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>incess, with whose
excellent Qualities, Madam, you are better acquainted than I.
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
It is hard to believe, that having Dispositions so far from Gallantry,
he should become so suddenly and vehemently in love with the Queen,
as he became on the only Rehearsal of her good Qualities, and at
the sight of her Picture in Minature, which was shew'd him. He
never lets it go out of his Hand; he always holds it to his Heart;
He Dialogues with it so prettily, as astonishes all the Courtiers, for he
speaks a Language he never spoke: His Passion for the Princes furni∣shes
him with a thousand Thoughts, which he dares not entrust any bo∣dy
with. He thinks no body makes hast enough, and therefore sends
fresh Curriers everyday to carry his Billets <HI>doux,</HI> and brings back
News of her.</P>
<P>When you come to <HI>Madrid, added he,</HI> you will hear Madam, se∣veral
particulars which have without doubt hapned since I was there,
and which will perhaps more satisfie your Curiosity than what I have
related to you. <HI>I am very much oblig'd to you,</HI> answered I, <HI>for
your Civilities, but do me the Favour to oblige me farther, in
giving me the true Character of the</HI> Spaniards: <HI>You know
them, and I am perswaded nothing has escap'd your Enquiries;
You speaking to me without Passion and Interest, I may reckon
my self sure of what you tell me.</HI> Why believe you, Madam, <HI>re∣plied
he smiling,</HI> that I shall speak to you more sincerely than another?
There are Reasons which may render me suspected: They are my Ma∣sters,
I must manage them; And if I be not Politick enough to do it,
the Vexation of being constrained to obey them, would tempt me to en∣tertain
Notions in their Respect contrary to Truth. <HI>However it be,</HI>
said I, interrupting him, <HI>pray tell me what you know of them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards, said he,</HI> have always past for Fierce and Glorious:
This Glory is mixt with Gravity; and they carry it so far, that one
may call it an extravagant Pride; They are Brave, without being
Rash, yet they are accused for not being daring enough; They are Cho∣lerick,
Revengeful, without shewing any Transport. Liberal with∣out
Ostentation, Sober in their Diet, very Presumptuous in Prosperi∣ty,
too Rampant in Adversity: They Idolize Women, they are so Pre∣possest
in their Favour, that they shew no Discretion in the Choice of
their Wives: They are patient to Excess, Obstinate, Idle, Singular,
Philosophisers: And as to the rest, Men of Honour keeping their
Words, tho' it cost them their Lives. They have a great deal of
Wit and Vivacity, easily comprehend, explain themselves in the same
manner, and in few words; They are Prudent, Jealous without mea∣sure,
disinterested, bad Oeconomists, Close, Superstitious, great Ca∣tholicks,
at least in appearance: They are good Poets, and write
Verses with great Facility. They would be capable of Nobler Sciences
would they vouchsafe to apply themselves thereto.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="47"/>
They have a Greatness of Soul, Elevated Wit, Constancy, a Na∣tural
Seriousness, and a Respect for Ladies, as is not seen elsewhere:
They have a Set Behaviour, full of Affectation, intoxicated with their
own Merit, hardly ever in this Particular doing Right to that of o∣thers.
Their Bravery consists in standing Valiantly in the Defensive
Part, without giving Ground, and without dreading Danger, but
they love not to seek it, which proceeds from their great Judgment:
They discern Danger, and avoid it. Their greatest Defect, in my O∣pinion,
is the Passion of Revenge and the Means they use for this:
Their Maxims hereupon are absolutely opposite to Christianity and
Honour: When they have receiv'd an Affront, they make him
be Assassinated who has offered it. They are not contented with this:
for they cause them to be Assassinated likewise whom they have offen∣ded,
in the Apprehension of being prevented, knowing well, that if
they do not kill, they shall be killed themselves. They pretend to ju∣stifie
themselves herein, when they say, That their Enemy having took
the first Advantage, they ought to; secure themselves of the second:
That should they fail herein, they would wrong their Reputation:
That you must not fight with a Man that has insulted over you, but
put your self in a Condition to punish him, without running half the
Dangers. It is true, that Impunity Authorises this Conduct, for the
Priviledge of Churches and Convents in <HI>Spain,</HI> is to give an assured
Retreat to Criminals; And as near as they can, they commit these
Villanies hard by a Sanctuary, so have the less way to an Altar;
Which you see oft embraced by a Villain, with his Poynard reeking
in his Hand, and besmeared with the Blood of the Murther which he
has committed.</P>
<P>As to their Persons, they are very lean, little, fine shape, come∣ly
Head, good Faces, fine Eyes, well set Teeth, yellow and duskish
Complexion; they will have one walk slowly, commend big Legs,
and a little Foot, Shooes without Heels, parting the Hair on both
sides, being strait cut, and kept behind their Ears with a great Two
handed Hat, an Habit always Black, instead of a Shirt, Taffity
Sleeves, or black Tabby, a Sword of a strange length, with a
black Frieze Cloak over all this, very strait Breeches, hanging
Sleeves, and a Poynard. All this must so disfigure a Man, let him
be otherwise never so well shaped, that they seem to affect a Garb the
most disagr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eable; And ones Eyes cannot with any Complacency ac∣cust<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m
themselves to this sight.</P>
<P><HI>Don Frederick</HI> would have continued on his Discourse,
and I had so much pleasure in hearing him, that I would
not have interrupted him, but he broke off himself,
having observ'd that the Play was at an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, and conside∣sidering,

that we were to set out early next Morning, he
thought I might be desirous of retiring, he therefore with the
other Gentleman, bad me good Night. I rose in effect very
soon next Morning, because 'twas a great Journey to <HI>Birbiesca,</HI>
where we intended to lie. We followed the River to avoid the
Mountains, and past at <HI>Oron,</HI> a great River, which falls into
the <HI>Ebre.</HI> We a while after entred into so strait a Way, that
our Litters could scarce pass: We ascended along, a very strait
Coast to <HI>Pancorvo,</HI> whose Castle I saw standing on a rais'd
Ground, not far distant: We traverst a great Plain; and this
was a Novelty to us, to see an even Country: This here is sur∣rounded
with several Mountains, which seem linkt together as
a Chain, and especially those of <HI>Oeca:</HI> We must again pass o∣ver
a little River, before we can come to <HI>Birbiesca:</HI> This is on∣ly
a Borough, which has nothing remarkable but its Colledge,
and some few pleasant Gardens along the Water. But I may
say, we came thither in worse Weather than any we had yet:
I was so tired, that as soon as I arriv'd I went to Bed: so that
I saw not <HI>Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI> and the other Gentlemen, till
the next Day, at <HI>Castel de Peones.</HI> But I should tell you how
one is serv'd in these Inns, they being all alike: When you
come into one of them, wearied and tired, roasted by the heat
of the Sun, or frozen by the Snows (for there is seldom any
Temperament between these Two Extreams) you see neither
Pot on the Fire, nor Plates wash'd: You enter into the Stable,
and from thence to your Chamber; this Stable is ordinarily
full of Mules and Muletteers, who make use of their Mules
Saddles for Pillows in the Night, and in the day-time they
serve them for Tables: They eat very friendly with their
Mules, and are very good Company together.</P>
<P>The Stair-Case by which you go up is very strait, and does
rather resemble a sorry Ladder: <HI>La Sennora de la Casa,</HI> receives
you with her Gown tuckt up, and her dangling Sleeves; she
takes time to put on her <HI>Sunday</HI>-Cloathes, whilsi you get out
of your Litter: and she never omits this, for they are all very
Poor and Vain-Glorious. You are shewed a Chamber whose
Walls are white enough, hung with a thousand little scurvy
Pictures of Saints; the Beds are without Curtains, the Co∣vertures
of Cotton, the Sheets as large as Napkins, and the
Napkins like Pocket-handkerchiefs; and you must be in some
considerable Town to find four or five of them; for in other
places there are none, no more than there are Forks! They
have only a Cup in the House; and if the Mule-Drivers get
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
first hold of it, which commonly happens, if they please, (for
they are serv'd with more Respect than those whom they bring)
you must stay patiently till they have done with it, or drink out
of an Earthen Pitcher. It is impossible to warm one at the
Kitchin-fire, without being choaked, for they have no Chim∣neys,
and 'tis the same in all the Houses on the Road; there is
an Hole made in the top of the Ceiling, and the Smoak goes
out thence, the Fire is in the midst of the Kitchin: They put
what you would have roasted on Tiles, and when 'tis well gril'd
on one side, they turn the other: when 'tis gross Meat, they
fasten it to a String, and so let it hang on the Fire, and turn it
with their Hands, so that the Smoak makes it so black, that it
would turn ones Stomack to look on it.</P>
<P>I think there cannot be a better Representation of Hell than
these sort of Kitchins, and the Persons in them, for not to speak
of this horrible Smoak, which blinds and choaks one, there are a
Dozen of Men, and as many Women blacker than Devils, nasty
and stinking like Swine, and clad like Beggars. There are al∣ways
some of 'em impudently grating on a sorry Guiter, and
singing like a Cat a roasting. The Women have all of 'em their
Hair about their Ears, and you would take 'em for <HI>Bedlamites,</HI>
they have Glass Necklaces, which hang twisted about their Necks
like Ropes of Onions, but however serve to cover the Nastiness
of their Skin. They are as great Thieves as any are in Jayl, and
they are urgent to serve you only to have an opportunity to steal
something of you, though it be but a Pin.</P>
<P>Before all things, the Mistress of the House brings you her
little Children, who are bare-headed in the midst of Winter,
though but of a Day old: she makes 'em touch your Cloaths, she
rubs their Eyes with them, their Cheeks, Throat, and Hands.
This seems as if one was become a Relick, and could heal all
Diseases. These Ceremonies over, you are askt, If you will
eat any thing, and though at Mid-night, you must send to the
Butchery, the Market, the Tavern, the Bakers, in fine, to all
parts of the Town, togather wherewith to make a sorry Meal.
For though the Mutton here be very tender, their way of fry∣ing
it with O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, is not to every Bodies Relish. Here are great
store of Partridges, and those very large; they are not very fat,
but dry, and to made them drier, they roast them to a Coal,
the Pidgeons here are excellent, and in several places here is
good Fish, especially Bessugosses, which have the taste of a
Trout, and of which they make Pasties, which would be good,
were they not stuff'd with Garlick, Saffron and Pepper. Their
Bread is white enough, and sweet, that one would think it
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
made up with Sugar; but it is ill wrought and so little baked,
that it is as heavy as Lead in the Stomach: it has the shape of
a flat Cake, and is not much thicker than one's Finger. The
Wine is good, and Fruits in their season, especially Grapes,
which are very large, and of delicate taste. You may reckon
your self certain of a good Desart. You have Sallads here of
such good Lettice as the World cannot afford better.</P>
<P>Do not think (Dear Cosen) 'tis sufficient to say, Go fetch
such things, to have them; for not very seldom you can meet
with nothing: But supposing you find what you would have,
you must give out your Money before-hand: so that your Meat
is paid for before you have begun to eat it; for the Master of
the Inn is only allowed to Lodge you: they alledge for a Rea∣son,
That it is not just one only Person should go away with
all the Profit from Travellers, it being better the Money should
be dispersed.</P>
<P>You enter not any Inn to Dine, but carry your Provision
with you, and stop at the Bank of some River, where the
Mule-Drivers bate their Mules; and this is with Oats or Barley,
with chopt Straw, which they carry with them in great Sacks;
for as to Hay they give them none. It is not allow'd a Wo∣man
to tarry above two Days in an Inn on the Road, unless she
can offer good Reasons. And here's enough in relation to Inns,
and the Manner of your Treatment therein.</P>
<P>After Supper these Gentlemen play'd at <HI>Ombre,</HI> and I not
being strong enough to play against them, I went shares with
<HI>Don Frederick de Cardonne;</HI> and <HI>Don Fernand</HI> drew near the Fire∣side
to me; he told me, He could have wish'd my time would
permit me to pass by <HI>Vailladolid;</HI> that it is the most pleasant
Town of <HI>Old Castille,</HI> it having been for a great while the Man∣sion
of the Kings of <HI>Spain;</HI> and that they have a Palace there
fit for them. That as to him, he had Relations there would
be infinitely pleased to entertain me; and would shew me the
<HI>Dominicans</HI> Church, which the Dukes of <HI>Lerma</HI> have founded;
that it was very Stately, and the Portal of singular Beauty, by
means of the Figures and Embossed Work, which enrich it:
That in the Colledge of the same Convent the <HI>French</HI> see there,
with great satisfaction, all the Walls full of <HI>Flower de Luces;</HI>
it being said, a Bishop who depended on the King of <HI>France,</HI>
had been at the Charge of Painting them. He added, They
would have carried me to the Religioses of St. <HI>Claire,</HI> to shew
me the Choire of their Church, the Tomb of a <HI>Castillan</HI>
Knight, whence 'tis said, issues out Accents and Groans every
time any of his Family are near their Deaths, I smiled at this,
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
as being doubtful of the Truth of such kind of Relations: “You
give not Credit to what I say, <HI>continued he,</HI> neither would I
engage for the Truth of it, though all the Country thereabouts
are so fully perswaded of it, that you would be suspected for
an Heretick should you question it. But it is certain there is a
Bell in <HI>Arragon,</HI> in a small Town call'd <HI>Villilla,</HI> on the <HI>Ebre,</HI>
which is about fifty Foot compass, and it happens sometimes
to sound of it self, it being not perceivable to be agitated
by any Wounds or Earthquakes: in a word, by no visible
thing. It first Tolls, and afterwards, by intervals, Rings
out, as well in the Day as the Night: When it is heard,
it is not doubted but it denounces some sad Accident: which
is what hapned in 1601, on <HI>Thursday</HI> the 13th of <HI>June,</HI> till
<HI>Saturday</HI> the 15th of the same Month; it ceased then to Ring,
but it began again on <HI>Corpus Christi,</HI> when they were on the
point of making the Procession. It was heard likewise when
<HI>Alphonsus</HI> the Fifth, K. of <HI>Arragon,</HI> went into <HI>Italy</HI> to take
Possession of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> It was heard at the
Death of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth. It denoted the Departure of
<HI>Don Sebastian,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> for <HI>Africk.</HI> The Extremity
of King <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, and the Decease of his last Wife
Q. <HI>Ann.</HI> You would have me to believe you, <HI>Don Fernand,
said I</HI> perhaps, I shall seem too obstinate in standing out
all this while, but you will agree there are Matters one may
lawfully doubt of. Nay, Madam, <HI>replied he, with a pleasant
Air,</HI> I tell you nothing but what I can have a thousand Wit∣nesses
to justifie; but perhaps you will sooner believe <HI>Don
Esteve de Carvajal</HI> in a thing as extraordinary in his Country.”
He at the same time call'd to him, demanding of him, “Whe∣ther
'twere not true, that there is in the Convent of <HI>Cardo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI>
a Clock which fails not to Ring every time a Religious is to
die; so that the time is known to a Day? <HI>Don Esteve</HI> con∣firm'd
what <HI>Don Fernand</HI> said: and though I remain'd not ab∣solutely
convinc'd,” yet I made a shew as if I was.</P>
<P>“You pass so quickly through <HI>Old Castille, continued</HI> Don Fer∣nand,
that you will not have time to see what's most remar∣kable:
The Picture of the Blessed Virgin is talkt of far and
near, which was found miraculously stampt on a Rock; it be∣longs
to the Religio's <HI>Augustines d' Avila,</HI> and several Persons
go there out of Devotion; but one has no less Curiosity to
see certain Mines of Salt, which are near there, in a Village
call'd <HI>Mengraville;</HI> you descend above two hundred Steps un∣der
Ground, and then enter into a vast Cavern form'd by
Nature, whose Top, or Roof, is upheld by one only Pillar of
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
Chrystalin Salt, of astonishing Largeness and Colour. Near
this place, in the Town of <HI>Soria,</HI> you see a great Bridge with∣out
a River, and a great River without a Bridge, the River
being forc'd out of its place by an Earthquake.”</P>
<P>“But if you go as far as <HI>Medina del Campo, added he,</HI> I am
sure the Inhabitants will give you a welcome Entrance, only
because you are of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, whom they much affect,
to distinguish themselves hereby from their Sentiments of the
other <HI>Castillians:</HI> Their Town is so priviledg'd, that the K.
of <HI>Spain</HI> has not the Power to create any Officers, nor the
Pope to confer Benefices: This Right belongs to the Towns∣men,
and they often fall together by the Ears, in chusing of
their Magistrates and Ecclesiasticks.”</P>
<P>“One of the Rarities of this Country is the <HI>Aquaduct</HI> of <HI>Sego∣via,</HI>
which is five Leagues in length, it has above two hun∣dred
Arches of extraordinary heighth, tho' in several places
there are two standing one on another; and 'tis all built on
Free Stone, there having been no Mortar, or any Cement
to joyn them: This is lookt on as one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Works,
or at least as worthy to be so. The River which is at the end
of the Town surrounds the Castle, and serves it for a ditch,
it is built on a Rock. Among several things remarkable, you
see the Effigies of the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> who have Reign'd for
several Years: And there is no Town but <HI>Segovia</HI> and <HI>Seville</HI>
where Money is Coyned, and the Pieces of Eight which are
made at the former Places are held to be the best; and this
is by means of the River which turns certain Mills that stamp
the Money. Here are likewise most curious Walks along a
Meadow planted with Elm Trees, whose Leaves are so thick
and large, that the greatest Heats of the Sun cannot pierce
them. I want not Curiosity, <HI>said I to him,</HI> for all things
which deserve it; but I at present want time to see them:
However, I should be very glad to arrive timely at <HI>Burgos,</HI>
to view the Town. Which is to say, Madam, <HI>replied Don Fer∣nand,</HI>”
we must lose your Company, and let you retire.</P>
<P>He gave notice thereof to the other Gentlemen, who gave
over their Play, and we thus separated.</P>
<P>I rose this Morning before Day; and I end this Letter as
<HI>Burgos,</HI> where I now arrived: Thus, Dear Cosen, I shall send
you nothing of this Day, but shall take the first occasion to ac∣quaint
you with what befals me.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>WE could sensibly perceive in arriving at <HI>Burgos,</HI> that this
Town is colder than any of those we past; and 'tis like∣wise
said, you have none of those excessive Heats which are
intollerable in other Parts of <HI>Spain:</HI> The Town stands where
you descend the Mountain, and reaches to the Plain as far as
the River, which washes the foot of the Wall: the Streets are
very strait and even: the Castle is not great, but very strong,
and is seen on the top of the Mountain: A little lower is the
triumphant Arch of <HI>Fernando Gonsales,</HI> which the Curious so
much admire. This Town was the first that was conquer'd from
the <HI>Mores;</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have long resided here;
'tis the Capital of <HI>Old Castille,</HI> it holds the first Rank in the
two States of the two <HI>Castilles,</HI> although <HI>Toledo</HI> disputes it
with her: You see her fine Buildings; and <HI>Velasco</HI>'s Palace is
very stately. Here are in all the Broad Streets and spacious
Places, Fountains, with Statues, some of which are good
Pieces; but the finest sight is the Cathedral, which is so large
that Mass is said in five several places of it, without any di∣sturbance
to each other: the Architecture is so exquisitely
wrought, that it may pass among the <HI>Gothick</HI> Buildings for a
Master-Piece of Art: and this is so much the more remarkable
in that they built very sorrily in <HI>Spain:</HI> in some places this is so
through Poverty, and in others want of Stone and Lime: I am
told that even at <HI>Madrid</HI> you see Houses of Earth, and the
finest are made with Brick, cemented with the same, for want
of Lime. To pass from the Town to the Suburbs of <HI>Bega,</HI>
you go over three Stone Bridges: the Gate which answers that
of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> stands high, with the Image of the Virgin
upon it: this Suburb contains the greatest part of the Convents
and Hospitals: there is a great one founded by <HI>Philip</HI> the Se∣cond
to receive the Pilgrims which go to St. <HI>James,</HI> and
which entertains them for a Day. The Abbey of <HI>Mille Flores,</HI>
whose Buildin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is very stately, is not far distant. You see
here in this Suburb several Gardens which are watered with
Fountains and pleasant Springs; the River serves for a Chan∣nel:
And you find in a great Park inclosed with Walls, plea∣sant
Walks at all times of the Year.</P>
<P>I would have seen the Crucifix in the <HI>Augustines</HI> Convent;
it is placed in a Chappel of the Cloyster, large and dark enough
so that you could hardly discern it, were it not for the Lamps
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
which are continually burning, they'r above an hundred; some
are of Gold, and others of Silver, of so extraordinary a size,
that they cover all the Vault of this Chappel: there are sixty
Silver Candlesticks of a length, exceeding the tallest Man,
and so heavy that two Men cannot lift them: they stand on the
ground on both sides of the Altar; those which are upon it are
of Massy Gold: You see between them two Crosses of the same,
set out with Precious Stones, and Crowns hanging over the
Altar, adorned with Pearls and Diamonds of great Lustre:
The Chappel is hung with Tapistry, wrought with Gold? it is
so laden with rich Gifts, that there's hardly room to put them
in, so that part of them are kept in the Treasury.</P>
<P>The Holy Crucifix stands on the Altar, near the natural big∣ness,
it is covered with three Curtains one on another, all
embroidered with Pearls and Diamonds: When they open
them, which is not done without great Ceremony, and for
Persons of Quality. Several Bells are rung, every one falls on
his Knees: and it must be granted, that this place and sight
strikes one with an Awful Regard: The Crucifix is of Carv'd
Work, and cannot be better made; its Carnation is very na∣tural;
it is covered from the Breasts to the Feet with a fine
Linnen, in several Foulds or Pleats, which makes it look like
a loose Jerkin, which in my Opinion, is not over agreeable.</P>
<P>It is commonly held, that <HI>Nicodemus</HI> made it; but those
who are for making every thing Miraculous, will have it brought
down from Heaven, they know not how nor when. I was
told, certain Monks of this Town had once stole it, and con∣vey'd
it away: but it took a convenient time to give them the
slip, and was found the next Morning in the Chappel, in its
usual place: These honest People being enraged, that it should
serve them such a Trick, mustered up their Forces, and violently
laid Hands on't the second time, but to as little purpose; for
'twould by no means stay with them: However, it works Mira∣cles,
and is one of the chief Objects of Devotion in <HI>Spain:</HI> The
Religious tell you, it sweats every <HI>Friday.</HI></P>
<P>I was going into my Inn, when we saw the <HI>Sieur de Car∣donnes
Valet de Cambre,</HI> running as fast as he could after us:
he was booted, and three Friers scowring after him: I was o∣ver
rash in my Judgment; for I could not but think he had
stole something in this rich Chappel, and was taken in the
Fact; but his Master, who was with me, having demanded of
him, What put him on such full Speed; He answer'd, He went
into the Chappel of the Holy Crucifix with his Spurs'on, and
the Fryers had kept him in custody, to get Money of him, but
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
that he was gotten out of their Clutches, but they were now
upon the Hunt for him. They make it a Forfeit as well as o∣thers,
for a Man to go with Spurs into these Holy Places.</P>
<P>The Town is not very great, it is adorned with a spacious
Place; here are high Pillars which bear up very fine Lodgings.
The Bull-Feasts are kept here, for the People are much delight∣ed
with this sort of Divertisement. There is also a very well-built
Bridge, long and large: the River which passes under it
bathes a Meadow, on the Bank of which you see Allies of
Trees, which form a most delicious Walk. Trade was hereto∣fore
considerable, but it is of late much diminisht. The best
<HI>Castillian</HI> is here spoken, and the Men are naturally Souldi∣ers,
so that when the King has need of them, he finds here
great Numbers, and better Men than elsewhere.</P>
<P>After Supper our company set to Play, as heretofore: <HI>Don
Sancho Sanniento</HI> was for yielding his place to any one, pretend∣ing
'twas his Right to entertain me this Evening. I knew he
had lately return'd from <HI>Sicily;</HI> I askt him, whether he had
been one of those who had help'd to Chastize those Rebellious
People? [Alas, Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> the Marquess <HI>de Los Navas</HI>
was sufficient to punish them beyond what their Crime deserv'd:
I was at <HI>Naples,</HI> in the design to pass into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where I
have Relations of the same Name. The Marquess <HI>de Los Veles,</HI>
Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples,</HI> engaged me to leave my first Project, and
embark my self with the Marquess <HI>de Los Navas,</HI> whom the
King sent into <HI>Sicily:</HI> We set Sail in two Vessels of <HI>Majorca,</HI>
and arriv'd at <HI>Messina</HI> the sixth of <HI>January.</HI> Having sent no
notice of his coming, and no body expecting it, he was not
receiv'd with the Honours paid commonly to the Vice-Roys:
But in truth, his Intentions were so cruel against these poor Peo∣ple,
that his Entrance should have been made in Tears.</P>
<P>Scarcely was he arriv'd, but he clapt up the two Sheriffs in
Prison, named <HI>Vicenzo Zuffo,</HI> and <HI>Don Diego:</HI> He put <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in their Places; he rigorously abolisht the Colledge of Knights
of the Star, and began to execute the Orders which <HI>Gonzaga</HI>
had long receiv'd, and which he had eluded through Favour or
Weakness. He immediately publisht an Order, by which the
King chang'd all the Form of Government of <HI>Messina,</HI> depriv'd
the Town of its Revenues, forbad its bearing for the future
the Glorious Title of <HI>Exemplary,</HI> dissolv'd the Senate, and put
into the place of six Sheriffs, six Officers, two of which should
be <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that these Officers should not for the future appear
in Publick with their Formalities, that they should no more
be preceded by Drums and Trumpets, ride no more together
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
in a Coach with four Horses, as they were wont; that they
should sit henceforward on a plain Bench; should have no
more Incense offered them in the Churches; go cloath'd after
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fashion; should Assemble on Publick Affairs in a
Chamber of the Vice-Roys Palace; and have no longer any
Jurisdiction on the Champian Country.</P>
<P>Every one was seized with such Consternation, as if he had
been Thunder-struck; but their Sorrow was much increased
on the fifth of the same Month, when the Camp-Master-Gene∣ral
went to the Town-house, and seized all their Charters, and
Original Copies of their Priviledges, and made them be burnt
publickly by the Hands of the common Hang-man. The Prince
<HI>de Condro</HI> was afterwards apprehended, to the great grief of
his Family, but particularly the Princess <HI>Elenora,</HI> his Sister,
whose Tears were not shed alone: this Princess is not above
Eighteen; her Beauty and Wit are miraculous, which astonish
those about her. <HI>Don Sancho</HI>'s Eyes grew red at the remem∣brance
of this Princess, and I plainly perceiv'd Pity had not all the
share in what he said; yet he continued on his Discourse to me
of <HI>Messina.</HI></P>
<P>The Vice-Roy, <HI>added he,</HI> publisht an Order, by which all
the Citizens were enjoyn'd, under penalty of ten Years Impri∣sonment,
and five thousand Crowns Fine, to bring their Arms
into his Palace. He at the same time caus'd the great Bell
in the Town-house to be taken down, and beaten to pieces
in their sight: He ordered all the Bells in the Cathedral to be
melted, to make a Statue of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> And the Prince
of <HI>Condro</HI>'s Children were taken into Custody: But their Fear
increased, when the Vice-Roy ordered <HI>D. V. Zuffo</HI>'s Head to
be cut off. This Example of Severity Alarum'd all the People;
and what appear'd most terrible, was, That in the late Trou∣bles,
some Families of <HI>Messinois</HI> having withdrawn themselves
into several Parts, the Marquess <HI>de Liche,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Embassa∣dor
at <HI>Rome,</HI> advised them, as a Friend, to return into their
own Country, assuring them all was Quiet, and that a General
Pardon was already publisht; and for their greater assurance,
gave them <HI>Passports.</HI> These poor People (who had not taken
up Arms, and being not of the number of the Revolters, know∣ing
their Innocency, could never have imagin'd they should
have been treated as Criminals) return'd to <HI>Messina;</HI> where
they had scarcely landed, but the Joy they had of seeing them∣selves
in their Native Country, and in the midst of their
Friends, was sadly disturb'd, when they were seised on, and
the next Morning, without any Quarter, or regard to Sex, or
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
Age, by the Vice-Roy's. Order, all hang'd. He afterwards,
sent to demolish the great Tower of <HI>Palermo;</HI> and the princi∣pal
Citizens of it, remonstrating against the excessive Impo∣sitions
on Corn, Silks and other Commodities, the Marquess <HI>de
las Navas</HI> sent them all to the Gallies, without being moved
by the Tears of their Wives, and the need so many poor Chil∣dren
might have of their Fathers.</P>
<P>I must acknowledge, <HI>continued Don Sancho,</HI> that my Nature
is so averse to the Rigors every day exercis'd on these poor
People, that I could not for all the World remain any longer
at <HI>Messina.</HI> The Marquess <HI>de las Navas</HI> was for sending to <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI>
to inform the King of what he had done. I intreated
him to charge me with this Commission; and in effect he
consented, and gave me his Letters, which I have delivered to
the King at <HI>Madrid;</HI> and at the same time my Intercessions
for the Prince <HI>de Condro:</HI> And I presume my good Offices will
not be wholly useless to him. I am perswaded, <HI>said I to him,</HI>
this was the principal Motive of your Journey: I am no pry∣ing
body, but methinks you are greatly concern'd for the In∣terest
of this Family. It's true, Madam, <HI>continued he,</HI> the In∣justice
done this Unfortunate Prince does sensibly affect me:
Were he not Brother to the Princess <HI>Eleonora, said I to him,</HI>
perhaps you would not much lay it to heart. But no more of
this; I perceive this Remembrance afflicts you. Pray let
me rather hear from you what is most remarkable in your
Country. Ah! Madam, <HI>cried he,</HI> you insult over me, for you
must needs know, that <HI>Galicia</HI> is so poor and mean a Country
that there's no place for bragging; not but that the Town of
St. <HI>James de Compestella</HI> is considerable enough: it is the Capi∣tal
of the Province, and scarce one in <HI>Spain</HI> that's superiour to
it in Riches and Greatness; Its Archbishoprick is worth Seventy
Thousand Crowns a Year, and the Chapter has as much, It
stands in an agreeable Plain, surrounded with little Hills of
moderate height: and it seems as if Nature had placed them
there to defend the Town from those deadly Blasts which arise
from other Mountains. Here is a University, fine Palaces,
stately Churches, publick Places, and an Hospital, one of the
most considerable, and best serv'd in <HI>Europe.</HI> It consists of
two Courts of Extraordinary greatness, with Fountains in the
midst, several Knights of St. <HI>James</HI> live in this Town, and
the Metropolis, which is dedicated to this Saint, keeps his Bo∣dy:
It is extream stately, and prodigiously rich: It is pre∣tended
you hear a kind of Clattering at his Tomb, as if Arms
were struck one against another: and this Noise is only heard
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are to undergo any great Loss. His Figure
is represented on the Altar, and the Pilgrims thrice kiss it,
and put their Hats on his Head: for this is the chief part of
the Ceremony: they have also another very singular one: they
ascend the Top of the Church, which is covered with great flat
Stones: In this place stands a Cross of Iron, whereon the Pil∣grims
ever fasten some Rag, or Scrap of what they wear: They
pass under this Cross by so strait a Passage, that they are forced
to crawl on their Bellies through it: and those who are not
slender, are in danger of being bursten. And there have been
some so ridiculous and superstitious, that having omitted to do
this they have expresly return'd back again three or four hun∣dred
Leagues, for you see here Pilgrims of all Nations. Here
is a <HI>French</HI> Chappel, of which great Care is taken: It is said,
the Kings of <HI>France</HI> have been always great Benefactors to it.
The Church which is under ground is better than that above,
there are stately Tombs, and Epitaphs of great Antiquity,
which exercise the Wits of Travellers. The Archiepiscopal
Palace is a vast Pile, and its Antiquity adds to its Beauty, in∣stead
of diminishing it. A Man of my Acquaintance, a great
Searcher into Etymologies, assured me the Town of <HI>Compo∣stella</HI>
was so called, because St. <HI>James</HI> was to suffer Martyr∣dom
in the place where he should see a Star appear at <HI>Compo∣stella.</HI>
It is true, <HI>continued he,</HI> that some People pretend it
to be thus: but the Peoples Credulity and superstition car∣ries
them further: for you are shew'd at <HI>Padron</HI> near <HI>Compostella,</HI>
an hollow Stone, and it is pretended this was the little Boat
in which St. <HI>James</HI> arriv'd, after he had past so many Seas in
it, which being of Stone, must have, without a signal Mira∣cle,
sunk to the bottom. I suppose, <HI>said I to him,</HI> you believe
this to be most true, <HI>He smiled, and continued his Discourse:</HI>
I cannot but give you the description of our <HI>Militia:</HI> They
are called together every Year in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> and all
the Young Men from the Age of Fifteen are oblig'd to march,
for should it happen that a Father, or any other Relation should
conceal his Son or Kinsman, and those who are Officers should
come to know it, they would condemn him who has so of∣fended,
to perpetual Imprisonment. There have been some
Examples of this, but they are rare, for the Peasants are so
infinitely pleas'd to see themselves Arm'd, and treated as <HI>Ca∣valieros
&amp; de Nobles Saldados del Rey,</HI> that they would not for
any Consideration be wanting to shew themselves on this oc∣casion.
You shall seldom see in an whole Regiment any Soul∣dier
that has more Shirts than that on his Back, and the Stuff
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
they wear seems for its Coarseness to be made of Pack-thread,
their Shooes are made of Cord; they wear no Stockings, yet eve∣ry
Man has his Peacock, or Dunghil Cock's Feather <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his Cap,
which is tied up behind, with a Rag about his Neck in form of
a Ruff; their Sword oftentimes hangs by their side tied with
a bit of Cord, and ordinary without a Scabbard; the rest of
their Arms is seldom in better Order: and in this Equipage
they march gravely to <HI>Tuy,</HI> where is the General Rendezvous,
it being a Frontier place to <HI>Portugal.</HI> There are three which
lie thus, the above-mention'd, <HI>Cindud-Rodrigro,</HI> and <HI>Badajor,</HI>
but <HI>Tuy</HI> is the best guarded, because it is over against <HI>Valantia,</HI>
a considerable Town belonging to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and
which has been carefully fortifi'd: These two Towns are so
near, that their Cannon will reach each other; and if the <HI>Portu∣gueses</HI>
have omitted nothing to put <HI>Valantia</HI> out of danger of
being insulted over, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend <HI>Tuy</HI> is in as good a
Condition to defend it self; It stands on a Hill, whose lower
part is wash'd by the River <HI>Minhio;</HI> it has good Ramparts,
strong Walls, and good store of Artillery. It is here, I say,
where these our Champions bid Defiance to the King's Ene∣mies,
and in a strutting Bravery, declare, they do not fear
them. Perhaps something of this may happen in time, for
here are form'd some Troops as in any other part of <HI>Spain.</HI>
However, this is a great loss to the Kingdom, the whole Youth
being thus taken up; for the Lands, for the most part lye un∣till'd,
and on the side of St. <HI>James de Compostella,</HI> you would
think you saw a Wilderness; on that of the Ocean, the Coun∣try
being better and more peopled, yields great Profit, and all
things necessary and convenient, as Oranges, Lemmons and
Pomgranates, several sorts of Fruits, and excellent Fish, especi∣ally
Pilchards, more delicate than those which come from <HI>Roy∣an</HI>
to <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI></P>
<P>One of the most remarkable things, in my mind, in this
Kingdom, is the Town of <HI>Doinse,</HI> one part of which always
enjoys the sweetness of the Spring, and the Fruits of Autumn,
by reason of several Springs of Boiling Water, which warm the
Air by their Exhalations; whilst the other part of this same
Town suffers the Rigors of the longest Winters, standing as
it does at the Foot of a very cold Mountain; so that you find
in the space of one only Season, all those which compose the
course of the Year.</P>
<P>You say nothing, <HI>replied I to him,</HI> of the marvellous Foun∣tain
call'd <HI>Louzano.</HI> Who have told you of it Madam? <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an∣swer'd
he.</HI> Persons that have seen it, <HI>added I.</HI> You have been
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
then told, <HI>continued he,</HI> that on the top of the Mountain of <HI>Cer∣bret,</HI>
you find this Fountain at the Source of the River <HI>Lours,</HI>
which has Flux and Reflux as the Sea, tho' it be at twenty
Leagues distance from it; that the greater the Heats are, the
more Water it casts, that this Water is sometimes cold as
Ice, and sometimes as hot as if it boil'd, there being no
Natural Cause to be giv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n for it. You learn, me Particulars I
was ignorant of, <HI>said I to him,</HI> and this is doing me a great
Pleasure, for I want not for Curiosity in relation to things un∣common.
I wish, <HI>replied he,</HI> 'twas not so late, I would give you
an account of several Rarities in <HI>Spain,</HI> and which perhaps you
would gladly learn. I leave you for to Night, <HI>said I to him,</HI>
but I hope before we come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> we shall have an
opportunity of discoursing of them. He very civilly made me
a Promise; and the Play being ended, we bad one another good
night.</P>
<P>When I would go to rest, I was led into a Gallery full of
Beds, as you see in Hospitals: I said, this was ridiculous,
and that needing only four, what occasion was there for shew∣ing
me forty, and to put me into such an open place to starve
me? I was answer'd, This was the best place in the House,
and I must take up with it. I caus'd my Bed to be made, when
scarce was I laid down, but some body knockt softly at my
Door; my Women opened it, and remained much surpriz'd
to see the Master and Mistress followed by a dozen of sorry
Creatures, and so cloath'd that they were half naked. I drew
my Curtain at the Noise they made, and opened more mine
Eyes at the sight of this Noble Company. The Mistress drew
near to me, and told me, These were honest Travellers, who
were coming into the Beds which remained Empty. <HI>How, lie
here?</HI> said I, <HI>I believe you have lost your Senses. I should have
lost them indeed,</HI> replied she, <HI>should I let so many Beds stand
Empty. Either, Madam, you must pay for them, or these
honest Gentlemen must lye in them.</HI> I cannot express my
Rage to you; I was in the mind to send for <HI>Don Fernand</HI> and
my Knights, who would have sooner made 'em pass through the
Windows than through the Doors: But I considered this could
not be done without some Disturbance, and therefore I came to
Terms, and agreed to pay 20<HI>d.</HI> for each Bed: they are hardly
dearer at <HI>Fontainbleau</HI> when the Court is there. These Illustrious
<HI>Dons,</HI> or, to speak better, <HI>Tatterdemalions,</HI> who had the Insolence
to come into my Room, immediately withdrew, having made me
several profound Reverences.</P>
<P>The next Morning I thought to have burst with laughter,
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
tho' it was at my Cost, when I discovered mine Hostess's Trick
to ruin me: For you must know in the first place, that these
pretended Travellers were their Neighbours, and that they are
accustomed to this Stratagem, when they see Strangers: But
when I would have reckoned the Beds to pay for them, they
were rowled all of them into the midst of the Gallery; there
were divers wretched Throughs of Straw pull'd out, which were
hardly good enough to entertain Dogs, yet I must pay for each
20 <HI>d.</HI> Four Pistoles ended our Dispute. I was not able to put
my self in a Passion, such singularity did I find in this Ma∣nagement.
I would not recount this little Accident to you, did
it not serve to give you some insight into the Humour of this
Nation.</P>
<P>We set out from <HI>Burgos</HI> very late, the Weather was so bad,
and there had fall'n in the Night such great quantity of Rain, that
I tarry'd there as long as I could, in expectation of its ceasing.
In fine, I came to a Resolution, and ascended my Litter. I
had not gotten far from the Town, but I repented of my leaving
it, no Track cou'd be seen, especially on a very high steep
Mountain, over which we must necessarily pass. One of our
Mule-drivers, who went before, struck too far on the Edge of
this Mountain, so that he fell with his Mule into a kind of Pre∣cipice,
where he broke his Head, and put his Arm out of joynt,
this being the famous <HI>Philip de St. Sebastian,</HI> the most intelli∣gent
of all his Profession, and who commonly carries Persons of
Quality to <HI>Madrid;</HI> he was therefore much bemoaned, and we
remain'd a great while before we could hale him out from the
scurvy place where he had fall'n. <HI>Don Fernand</HI> was so compas∣sionate
as to let him have his Litter. The Night came speedi∣ly
on us and we could have comforted our selves, could we have
return'd to <HI>Burgos,</HI> but it was impossible, the ways were no less
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over'd with Snow on that side, than all the rest; so that we
put in at <HI>Madrigalesco,</HI> which has not above a dozen Houses,
and I may say we were besieg'd without having any Enemies.
This Adventure gave us some disturbance, tho' we had brought
Provisions with us for several Days. The best House of the
Town was half uncovered; and I was scarce lodged there,
when a Venerable Old Man askt for me on the part of a La∣dy
who was just arrived: He made me a Compliment, and told
me, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inform'd this was the only place where there was
any tolerable Entertainment; and therefore entreated me to
spare her some room. He added, She was a Person of Quality
of <HI>Andalousia,</HI> was lately a Widow, and that he had the Ho∣nour
to belong to her.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62"/>
One of our Knights, named <HI>Don Esteve de Carjaval,</HI> who is
of the same Country, fail'd not to demand her Name of the Old
Gentleman: He told him, she was the Marchioness <HI>de Los Rios.</HI>
At this Name he turn'd towards me, and spake to me of her as
of a Person whose Merit and Fortune were very considerable;
I readily accepted of this good Company: She immediately
came in her Litter, out of which she had not descended, having
found no House where she could abide.</P>
<P>Her Dress seem'd to me very singular, had she not been so
handsome as she was, she could never have appear'd in any sort
tolerable: Her Gown and Petticoat was of black Serge, and
over them a kind of Linnen Surplice, which reacht down lower
than her Knees, the Sleeves were long, and strait in the Arms,
which hung over her Hands: This Surplice was fastned to
her Gown, and being not pleated behind, it seem'd like a Bib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
she wore on her Head a piece of Muslin, which covered her
Face, and one would have taken it for a Religiose's Hood;
this covered her Neck, and reach'd down very low: There
appear'd no Hair on her Head, they were all hid under this Mu∣slin:
She wore a great Mantle of Black Taffaty, which covered
her Heels, and over this Mantle she had an Hat, whose Brims
were very large, fastned under her Chin with silken Twist. I
was told they wear this but only when they travel.</P>
<P>This is the Habit of the Widows and <HI>Duenna's,</HI> a Dress which
is insupportable to my sight; and should one meet with a Wo∣man
in the Night thus cloath'd, one might be startled without
Reproach; yet the Lady was very beautiful in this Unseemly
Dress. They never leave it, unless they marry; and they are
oblig'd to bewail the Death of an Husband, whom they could
not endure when living.</P>
<P>I was inform'd they pass the first Year of their Mourning in
a Chamber hung with Black, wherein there is not the least glim∣mering
of Day-light to be seen, they sit cross-legg'd on a little
<HI>Holland</HI> Quilt. When this Year is ended, they retire into a
Chamber hung with Gray: they must have no Pictures, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Looking-Glasses, nor Cabinets, nor fine Tables, nor Plate, nei∣ther
must they have any Diamonds, or wear any Colours: How∣ever
modest they are, they must live so retired, that it must
seem their Soul is already in the other world. This Constraint
is the cause that several Ladies who are wealthy, and especially
in rich Houshold Goods, marry again to have the satisfaction
of making use of them.</P>
<P><HI>After the first Compliments I inform'd my self from this
mournful Widow where she was going; she told me, She had
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
not for a long time seen a Friend of her Mother's who was a
Religious at</HI> Lashuelgas de Burgos, <HI>which is a famous Nunnery,
wherein there are an hundred and fifty Nuns, most of them the
Daughters of Princes, Dukes, and Titulado's. She added, That
the Abbess is Lady of fourteen large Towns, and above fifty
other Places, wherein she chuses Governours and Magistrates;
that she is Superior of seventeen Convents; Collates to several
Benefices, and disposes of twelve Commanderships in favour of
whom she pleases. She told me she design'd to pass some time
in this Monastery:</HI> Can you, Madam, <HI>said</HI> I <HI>to her,</HI> accustom
your self to so retired a Life as is that of a Convent? It will be no
hard matter, <HI>said she,</HI> for I believe I see fewer People at my own
House than I shall see there; and in effect these Religious have Li∣berty
enough: They are commonly the handsomest young Women of the
Family who are there; these enter therein so young, that they know
not what they are made to leave, nor what they undertake at the
Age of six or seven, and it may be sooner. They are caused to make
Vows, when 'tis often the Father or Mother, or some near Relation,
who pronounce them for them, whilst the little Sacrifice disports her
self with Sugar-plums, and lets them dress her how they will:
Yet the Bargain holds, there's no unsaying it; however, they have
every thing which can be expected in their Condition. There are at
<HI>Madrid</HI> some whom they call the Ladies of St. <HI>James:</HI> they are
properly Canonnesses, who make their Tryals like the Knights of this
Order; they bear like them, a Sword made in form of a Cross,
embroidered with Crimson Silk; they have them on their Scapularies
and great Cloaks, which are white: These Ladies House is very
stately; all who come to visit them enter without any difficulty;
their Apartments are very fine, and every whit as well furnish'd
as if they were at large in the World; they enjoy great Pensions, and
each of them has three or four Women to wait on them: It's true,
they never stir out, nor see their nearest Relations, but through seve∣ral
Grates. This perhaps would look horrid in another Country, but
in <HI>Spain</HI> they are accustom'd to Confinement.</P>
<P>There are Convents where the Religious see more Cavaliers than
the Women who live at large, neither are they less gallant; It is
impossible for any to have more Gayety than they; and, as I have
already told you, Madam, here are more Beauties than abroad;
but it must be granted, there are several among them who are
deeply sensible at their having been so soon sacrific'd; they think of
the Pleasures which they have never tasted, as the only ones which
can make this Life Happy. They pass theirs in a Condition wor∣thy
of Compassion, always telling you, they are by Force;
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
and that the Vows they are made to repeat at the Age of five or six
Years are to be regarded like Childrens Plays.</P>
<P>Madam, <HI>said I to her,</HI> it would have been great pity, had your
Relations designed you for such a Life; and one may judge in be∣holding
you, that all the beautiful <HI>Spanish</HI> Ladies are not Religioses.
Alas, Madam, <HI>said she, in fetching a deep Sigh,</HI> I know not
what I wou'd be; it seems I am of a very odd Humour, not to be
contented with my Fortune: but one has sometimes Ʋneasinesses
which are unaccountable to reason. <HI>In ending these words, she
fastned her Eyes to the ground, and fell into such a deep fit of
Musing, that I cou'd easily perceive something disturb'd her.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever Curiosity I had to know the Subject, we had been
so little together, that I dared not desire to be her Confident;
but to draw her from the melancholy Posture she was in, I en∣treated
her to tell me some News of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> seeing
she came from <HI>Madrid.</HI> She did what she could to recover
her self: she then told me, There were great shews of Joy at
Court on the Queen's Birth-day: that the King had sent one
of the Gentlemen of his Chamber to <HI>Toledo,</HI> to Compliment
her from him: Yet these fine Appearances hindred not the
Marquess <HI>de Mansera,</HI> the Queens <HI>Major Domo,</HI> from receiving
Orders to retire twenty Leagues from the Court, which had
greatly mortified this Princess. She inform'd us, That the Fleet
which carried Troops to <HI>Galicia,</HI> was unhappily cast away on
the Coasts of <HI>Portugal.</HI> That the little Dutchess <HI>de Terra
Nova,</HI> was to Espouse <HI>Don Nicoli Pignatella,</HI> Prince <HI>de Monte∣leon,</HI>
her Uncle. That the Marquess <HI>de Laganez</HI> had refused the
Vice-royalty of <HI>Sardagnia,</HI> being in love with a fine Lady, whom
he could not find in his heart to leave. That <HI>Don Carlos de
Omodei,</HI> Marquess <HI>de Almanazid,</HI> was dangerously ill, at his
Disappointment of being admitted a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> to
which he pretended, having marry'd the Heiress of the House
and Grandeurship of <HI>Castle Rodrigue;</HI> and that which most sen∣sibly
afflicted him, was, that <HI>Don Adriel de Gusman,</HI> this Lady's
first Husband, had enjoyed this Honour; so th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he could not
but look on the Difficulties thrown in his way as a slighting of
his Person: <HI>In truth Madam,</HI> said I to her, <HI>I can hardly com∣prehend
how a Man of sence, can with such eagerness pursue, and
be so greatly dejected at a Disappointment of this Nature. We
are otherwise affected in</HI> Spain, replied the beautiful Widow,
<HI>and this Instance is a proof of it.</HI></P>
<P>Don Frederic de Cardonne, <HI>who greatly interested himself for
the Duke</HI> de Medina Celi, <HI>askt her News of him:</HI> The King
<HI>said she,</HI> has lately made him President of the <HI>Indies.</HI> The
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
Queen-Mother has wrote to the King, on the Report which runs,
that he is about Marrying; that she is surprized things are already
gone so far, and he has not acquainted her with them. She adds
in her Letter, she advised him in the mean time, whilst all things
were ready for this Ceremony, to make a Journey to <HI>Catalonia</HI>
and <HI>Arragon. Don John</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> sufficiently understands the
Necessity of this, and he presses the King to depart, to content these
People, in promising by Oath, according as is customary to new
Kings, to maintain all their ancient Priviledges. Have then
Madam, <HI>said I to her, interrupting her,</HI> the <HI>Arrogonois</HI> any
other Priviledges than the <HI>Castilians?</HI> Very particular ones, <HI>re∣plyed
she,</HI> and you being a Stranger, I believe you will be wil∣ling
to let me inform you of them. <HI>Here's what I learnt:</HI></P>
<P>The Daughter of Count <HI>Julien,</HI> named <HI>Cava,</HI> was one of the
most beautiful Ladies in the World: King <HI>Rodrigue</HI> became
so passionately in love with her, that his affections knowing
no Bounds, transported him beyond all Measure. The Father,
who was then in <HI>Affrica,</HI> informed of the Outrage done his
Daughter, who breathed nothing but Revenge, treated with
the <HI>Moors,</HI> and supplied 'em with the means
to enter into <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This hap∣pened in 714, after the Bat∣tle of St. <HI>Mar∣tin,</HI> wherein <HI>D. Rodrigue</HI> lost his Life; others say, he fled into <HI>Portugal,</HI> and Died in a Town there called <HI>Viscii.</HI></NOTE> and to make there, for
sundry Ages, all those Ravages set forth at large
in history.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arragonois</HI> were the first who shook off the Yoak of
these Barbarians; and finding no more among them any
Princes of the Race of the <HI>Gothish</HI> Kings, they agreed to
Elect one, and cast their eyes on a Lord of the Country, call'd
<HI>Garci Ximinez;</HI> but they being Masters, to impose Laws on
him, and finding himself sufficiently Happy that he might Rule
over them under any Condition, these People therefore con∣fin'd
him within narrow Bounds.</P>
<P>They agreed, That as soon as their Monarch should break
through any of their Laws, he should immediately forfeit his
Power, and they be at full liberty to chuse another, though he
were a Pagan: And to hinder him from violating their Privi∣ledges,
and to defend themselves against him, they establisht
a Soveraign Magistrate, whom they call'd the <HI>Justicia,</HI> whose
Office was to observe the Conduct of the King, the Judges, and
the People: but the Power of a Soveraign being likely to Awe
a meer Particular, to Assure the <HI>Justicia</HI> in the Execution of
his Office, they ordered, That he might not suffer either in
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
his Person or Goods, but by a compleat Assembly of the States,
which they call <HI>Las Cortes.</HI></P>
<P>They moreover provided, That if the King should Oppress
any one of his Subjects, the great and considerable Men of the
Kingdom might assemble themselves, and hinder his receiving
any of his Revenues, till the Innocent was acquitted, and re∣establisht in his former Rights. And to make <HI>Garci Ximinez</HI>
timely sensible of the Power this Man had over him, they set
him on a kind of a Throne, and made the King to kneel down
bare headed before him, to receive from him his Oath of keep∣ing
their Priviledges. This Ceremony ended, they acknow∣ledge
him their Sovereign, but in as odd and disrespectful a
Manner, for instead of promising him Fidelity and Obedience,
they say to him. <HI>We who are as good Men as your self, we make
you our King and Governour, on Condition you keep to us our Rights
and Properties, otherwise we Disacknowledge you.</HI></P>
<P>The King, <HI>Don-Pedro,</HI> in process of time coming to the
Crown relisht this Custom, as unworthy of the Regal State;
and it so greatly disgusted him, that by his Authority and In∣treaties,
and the Offers he made of bestowing several notable
Priviledges on the Kingdom, he procured the Abolishment of
this, in an Assembly of the States: he got this general Consent
in Writing, which was represented to him. As soon as he had
the Parchment, he drew out his Dagger, and pierced his Hand
with it, saying, <HI>'Twas fit a Law which gave Subjects the Liber∣ty
of chusing their Sovereign should be Effaced with their Sove∣reign's
Blood.</HI> His Statue is still seen in the Deputation-Hall of
<HI>Saragossa:</HI> he holds a Dagger in one Hand, and the Charter in
the other. The sate Kings have not been such Religious Obser∣servers
of their Priviledges as the first.</P>
<P>But there is a Law still in force, and which is very singular,
and this they call, <HI>The Law of Manifestation;</HI> which is, That
if an <HI>Arragono<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> had Wrong done him in Judgment, in con∣signing
500 Crowns he may bring his Cause before the <HI>Justicia,</HI>
who is obliged, after an exact Perquisition, to punish him who
has given a wrong Sentence: And if the fails therein, the op∣prest
Person may have recourse to the States of the Kingdom,
who Assemble and Nominate five Persons of their Body, which
is to say, of the Prime Nobility, the Ecclesiasticks, the Gen∣try
and Commonalty: they appoint three out of the first Rank,
and two from each of the others. But it is observable, they
choose the most Ignorant to Judge the most able Men in the
Gown, whether to disgrace 'em the more for their Fault, or
as they alledge, <HI>That Justice should be so clear, that the very
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
Plow-men, and those who understand the least, should discern it
without the help of Oratory.</HI> It likewise affirm'd, that the Judges
tremble when they pronounce a Sentence, fearing lest it turn
against themselves, to the loss of their lives or Estates, should
they commit the lest Fault therein, either wilfully, or through in∣advertency.
It were well if this Custom were observed in all
Kingdoms: but this is rather to be wished than expected.</P>
<P>Yet what is no less singular, is that Justice remains always
Soveraign; and though the Unjust Judge be punish'd severely
for his wrong Decree, yet it subsists in its full force, and is fully
executed: If then any unhappy Wretch be sentenced to
Death, he is not spared, tho' his Innocency be discovered, and
made as clear as Noon-day, but his Judges are executed too
before his Face, which, in my mind, is a poor Consolation.
If the Judge accused, as justly perform'd his Office, the Plain∣tiff
leaves the 500 Crowns which he had consign'd. But were
he to lose an 100000 Crowns of Annual Revenue, by the Sen∣tence,
he complains of, the Sentence or Decree remains good,
and the Judge is only condemned to pay him likewise 500
Crowns; the rest of this Judge's Estate is forfeited to the King:
which is in my Opinion, another Point of Injustice; for in
fine, he ought, above all others, to have Recompence made
him who suffers by a wrong Sentence.</P>
<P>These same People have another Custom, to distinguish by
the Punishment the Crime committed: for Example, a Cava∣lier,
who has kill'd another in Duel (for they are here strictly
forbid) he has his Head cut off before; and he that has Assassi∣nated,
his is cut off behind. This is to distinguish him who
has behaved himself like a brave Man, from him that kills you
Treacherously.</P>
<P>She added, That to speak in general of the <HI>Arragonois,</HI> They
have a Natural Pride, which is hard to be suppress'd: but like∣wise
to do them Justice, there are People of brave Minds to be
found among them; insomuch that they are easily discern'd
from all the rest of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Subjects: That they
have never wanted Great Men, from their first King to <HI>Ferdi∣nand:</HI>
That they counted such a great number of them, as
would scarce be believ'd. However, they are greatly recom∣mended
themselves by their Valour and Conduct, that as to
the rest, their Country was so little fruitful, that excepting
some Valleys which were watered by Channels, whose Water
came from the <HI>Ebre,</HI> the rest was so dry and sandy, that you
meet with scarce any thing else but stony and parched up pla∣ces:
That <HI>Sarragossa</HI> is a great City, the Houses siner than at
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
<HI>Madrid,</HI> the Publick Places adorn'd with Arches; That the
Holy Street, where the Courses are run, is so long and large,
as may make it pass for a great and vast place, having several
great Mens Palaces on it; that of <HI>Castelmorato</HI> being one of the
pleasantest: That the Vault of St. <HI>Francis</HI>'s <HI>Church</HI> was very
curious, for being of extraordinary Largeness, yet 'tis upheld
by no Pillars: that the City is not strong, but the Inhabitants
so stout, that it needed no Walls; that it has never a Foun∣tain,
this being one of its greatest Defects: That the <HI>Ebre</HI> car∣ried
no Boats, the River being full of dangerous Rocks. As
to the rest, the Archbishoprick was worth 60000 Crowns a
Year: That the Vice-Royalty brought in no Revenue, being a
Place of Honour, fit only for great Lords to bear the Expence
of it, to maintain their Ranks, and keep the People under,
who are Naturally Fierce and Imperious, not Affable to Stran∣gers;
and so little desirous of making Acquaintance, that they
chuse rather to stay at Home alone all their Life-time, than
stir out to procure Friendships: That here is a severe Inquisi∣tion,
who have a stately Palace, and a most Rigid Court of
Justice. Yet this does not hinder great Troops of Robbers, call'd
<HI>Bandoleros,</HI> from Ravaging, and dispersing themselves over all
<HI>Spain;</HI> who give no Quarter to Travellers, snatching up some∣times
Women of Quality, whom they afterwards set at Ran∣som,
for their Parents to Redeem; but when they are Hand∣some
they keep them: And this is the greatest Misfortune can
happen to 'em, being forc'd to spend their Days with the worst
of Men, who keep them in dreadful Caves, or carry them
along with them on Horse-back, being so furiously jealous of
'em, that one of their Captains having been lately set upon
by Souldiers sent into the Mountains to seize on him, being
mortally wounded, and having his Mistress with him, who was
of the Marquess <HI>de Camaraza</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Family:
When she saw him in this Condition, she thought only of ma∣king
Use of this favourable Opportunity of saving her self;
which he perceiving, dying, as he was, he catch'd hold of her
Hair, and struck his Dagger into her Breast, being not wil∣ling,
<HI>said he,</HI> that another should possess a Treasure which had
been so dear to him. And this is what himself acknowledg'd
to the Souldiers who found him, and saw this sad Spectacle.</P>
<P>The Beautiful Marchioness here held her peace; and I re∣turn'd
her all due Thanks for the favour she did me, in inform∣ing
me of these Curiosities; and of which, perhaps without
her I might have been Ignorant all my Life. <HI>I do not think,
Madam,</HI> said she to me, <HI>you owe me such Thanks; Irather fear
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
the having deserved Reproaches for so long and tire some a Conversation.</HI></P>
<P>I would not let her leave me to eat elsewhere; and I obliged
her to lye with me, she having no Bed. So Civil and Cour∣teous
a Proceeding made her much my Friend. She assured
me of this in such Affectionate Terms, that I could not doubt
of it; for I must tell you, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Women are more
Caressing than we, and are far more Kind and Tender to those
they profess Friendship. In fine, I could not forbear telling
her, <HI>That if she had all the Kindness for me she made Profession,
she must be so complaisant, to inform me what made her seem so
melancholly? That I had heard her fetch deep Sighs in the Night,
and appeared very Restless and disconsolate; That if she could
find any Comfort in sharing her Grief with me, I offered my Service
to her, as a most faithful Friend.</HI> She embraced me with great
Affection, and told me without delay, she would immediately
satisfie my Curiosity; which she did in these Terms:</P>
<P>Seeing you are so desirous to know me, I must without disguising to
you any thing, acknowledge my weakness to you: and by my Sincerity
and Open-heartedness, deserve a Curiosity as obliging as yours:</P>
<P>I come not of such a Family as may claim Nobility, my Father's
Name was <HI>Davila;</HI> he was only a Banker, but he was in good
Credit, and was moderately Wealthy: We are of <HI>Seville,</HI> Ca∣pital
of <HI>Andalousia,</HI> and we have ever dwelt there. My Mother
knew the World, she saw many People of Quality, and having
no Children but me, she took great care of my Education: It
did not appear ill bestowed on me; for I had the good For∣tune
to get the good Will of most that saw me.</P>
<P>We had two Neighbours who came often to our House,
who were very welcome both to my Father and Mother:
Their Condition and Age were in no sort alike: One was the
Marquess <HI>de los Rios,</HI> a Person Wealthy and Noble; he was a
Widower, and well advanced in years: the other was the
Son of a great Merchant, who traded to the <HI>Indies;</HI> he was
Young and handsome, he had Wit, and very graceful Beha∣viour,
his Name was <HI>Mendez;</HI> He was not long before he fell
passionately in Love with me; so that he omitted nothing
which might please me, and gain my affections.</P>
<P>He was in all places where he knew I was to pass; he spent
whole Nights under my windows, to sing Verses which he had
composed and set to my Praise, which he had very well accom∣panied
with his Harp.</P>
<P>But seeing his Attendancies had not all the effect he ex∣pected,
and having past some time in this manner, without
daring to mention his Affection to me, he at length resolved to
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
make use of the first occasion to acquaint me with it. I avoid∣ed
him ever since I had a Conversation with one of my Friends,
who had more Experience and Knowledge of the World than
I: I had felt, that <HI>Mendez</HI>'s Company gave me Joy, and that
my Heart had an Emotion for him, which it had not for others:
That when his Affairs, or our Visits hindred him from seeing
me, I grew restless; and loving this young Woman, above
others, and being as dear to her, she observed I was not so free
and gay as I was wont, and that my Eyes were sometimes at∣tentively
fixed on <HI>Mendez.</HI> One Day when she rally'd with me
about it, I said to her very innocently, <HI>My dear</HI> Henrietta, <HI>de∣fine
to me the Sentiments I have for</HI> Mendez: I <HI>knew not whe∣ther
I ought to be afraid of them, and whether I ought not to de∣fend
my self from them. I feel I know not what sort of Trouble
and Pleasure arising in my Breast.</HI> She began to laugh, she
embraced me, and said to me, <HI>my dear Heart you are in Love,
Who I in Love?</HI> replyed I, in amaze: <HI>You joke with me; I nei∣ther
am, nor will be in Love. This depends not always on us</HI> con∣tinued
she, with a more Serious Air, <HI>our Stars decide this be∣fore
our Hearts. But in earnest, what is it so much s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artles you:</HI>
Mendez <HI>is in a Condition equal to yours; he deserves well, a good
comely Man; and if his Affairs go on with the same Success as
they have done hitherto, you may live very happily with him. And
whence should I learn,</HI> applyed I, interrupting her, <HI>that he will
be happy with me, and that he so much as thinks this. O take my
Word for it</HI> answered she, <HI>whatever he has done has its Designs;
for Men are not wont to pass Nights under Windows, and the Days
in following a Person for whom they have nothing but Indifferency.</HI></P>
<P>After some other Discourse of this Nature, she left me, and I
resolved, maugre the Repugnance I felt in me, to give <HI>Mendez</HI>
no opportunity of speaking to me in particular.</P>
<P><HI>But one Night as I was walking in the Garden, he came to∣wards
me: I was perplext to see my self alone with him, and
he had the opportunity of observing it on my Countenance,
and in the manner after which I received him. This could not
divert him from the design he had of entertaining me:</HI> How
Happy am I, Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> to find you alone? But I do call my
self Happy! Perhaps I know not what I say: for it may be you will
not receive a Secret with which I would entrust you. I am as yet so
young, <HI>said I to him, blushing,</HI> that I would advise you to say nothing
to me, unless you would have me impart it to my Companions. Alas, <HI>con∣tinued
he,</HI> should <HI>I</HI> tell you, I adore you; that all my Happiness de∣pends
on the Inclinations you have towards me: That I cannot live
without some certainty, that I may one day please you; will you tell
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
this to your Companions? <HI>No, said I to him in great perplexity,</HI> I would
look on this Confide<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce as a Railery, and not believing it my self, <HI>I</HI>
would not hazard its being left to be believ'd by others.</P>
<P>We were interrupted as I ended these words; and he ap∣pear'd
to me not over-content with the Answer I made him;
and a while after he found an opportunity to reproach me with it.</P>
<P>I could not but give a favourable Ear to the Inclinations I had
towards him; every thing he told me seem'd to me to have its par∣ticular
Gracefulness: And it was no hard matter for him to per∣swade
me, that he lov'd me above all things in the World. In
the mean time, the Marquess <HI>de los Rios</HI> took such a liking to
me, and my Person and Behaviour ran so deeply in his Thoughts,
that he wholly applied himself to please me. He was very nice
and cautious; he could not resolve with himself to owe me
wholly to my Parents Authority: He well knew they would
receive as an Honour the Intentions he had for me; but he was
for gaining my Consent before he demanded theirs.</P>
<P>In this Design he said all to me he thought was like to take
with me. I answered him, I should always think it an indis∣pensable
Duty to obey my Father: yet our Ages were so diffe∣rent,
that I told him, I thought 'twere better he left off think∣ing
of me; that I should have an everlasting Acknowledgment
for the advantageous Intentions he had for me: and there∣fore
I would esteem him, tho' I could not love him. Ha∣ving
heard what I had said, he was sometime without speaking,
and immediately taking up a very generous Resolution: <HI>Lovely</HI>
Mariana, says he, <HI>you might have made me the happiest Man in
the World, and if you were ambitious, I had therewith to satisfie
you: But you refuse me, and I desire to be anothers: I consent to
it; I love you too well to be in suspence, whether you are to be satis∣fied
or I; I therefore wholly sacrifice my Happiness to you and leave
you for ever.</HI> In ending these Words he left me, and appear'd
so afflicted, that I could not forbear being concern'd.</P>
<P><HI>Mendez</HI> arriv'd a while after, and found me melancholly:
He was so earnest with me to know the Cause, that I could not
deny him this Proof of my Complisance. Any one but he
would have had a sensible Obligation at the Exclusion I came
from giving his Rival: But far from seeming to value it, he
told me, He saw in mine Eyes the Regret I had for a Lover,
who could place me in another sort of a Rank than he was able,
and that my Proceeding was very Cruel. In vain I endeavour∣ed
to make him sensible of the Injustice of his; but all I could
say, could not hinder him from charging me with Inconstancy.
I remain'd vext, and surpriz'd at this his way of Dealing, and
was several days without speaking to him.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="72"/>
He, in fine, at last understood he had no Reason to Com∣plain;
he came to me, begg'd my Pardon, and testified to me
a great Displeasure at his own Jealousie: He excused himself,
as all Lovers do, on the strength of his Passion. I had so much
Weakness as to be willing to forget the Trouble he had given
me: we made up the Matter between us, and he continued on
his Courtship.</P>
<P>His Father having understood the Passion he had for me,
thought he could not procure him a more advantageous Marriage:
he took notice of it to him, and came afterwards to my Father,
to open to him the Proposal: they had been long Friends; he
was favourably heard, and they easily agreed on the Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Mendez</HI> came to inform me of the News, with such Transports
as would have seem'd ridiculous to any other than a Mistress.
My Mother order'd me to look kindly on him, telling me this
Affair would be advantegous to me: and as soon as the <HI>India</HI>-Fleet should arrive, wherein he was greatly concern'd, the
Marriage should be concluded.</P>
<P>Whilst matters thus past, the Marquess <HI>de Los Rios</HI> had re∣tired
to one of his Country-Houses, where he scarcely saw any
one: He led a languishing Life; he still lov'd me, but hin∣dred
himself from telling me so, and from comforting himself
by this innocent Remedy.</P>
<P>In fine, his Body could not resist the Heaviness of his Mind;
he fell dangerously ill, and being told by the Physicians, there
wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no hope of his Recovery, he pluckt up his Spirits to write
me the most affectionate Letter imaginable, and sent at the
same time to me a Deed of Gift of all his Estate, in case he dy∣ed.
My Mother was in my Chamber, when a Gentleman present∣ed
this Packet from him; she would know what it contain'd.</P>
<P>I could not forbear at the same time, telling her what had
past; and we were both of us in the greatest surprize at the
Marquess's extream Generosity. She sent him word, that I
should go with my Family to thank him for a Liberality which I
had no ways deserved: And in particular, she sharply repre∣hended
me for having made a Mystery of a thing to her, with
which I ought to have immediately acquainted her. I threw my
self at her Feet, I excused my self the best I could, and testified
such great Sorrow for having displeased her, that she easily par∣doned
me. Leaving my Chamber, she went to my Father, and
having learnt him all which had past, they resolved to go the next
morning to see the Marquess, and to carry me with them.</P>
<P>I acquainted <HI>Mendez</HI> with this in the Evening; and the Fear
I had, lest my Parents should, in fine, make me marry this
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
old Man, if he chanced to escape out of his Sickness. Howe∣ver
sensible I appeared to him of this, he was so far transport∣ed,
and reproacht me so greatly with it, that I must have lov'd
him as much as I did, not to have broke off with him: But he
had such an Ascendant over me, though he was the injustest of
all Men, yet I thought him the most Reasonable.</P>
<P>We were at the Marquess <HI>de Los Rio</HI>'s, his Country-house was
not above two Leagues from <HI>Seville:</HI> Dying, as he was, he re∣ceived
us with such Joy as was easily observable. My Father testi∣fi'd
to him his Grief, to see him in so low a Condition, thankt him
for the Donation he made me, and assured him, if he could find a
fair and just Pretence, he would break off with <HI>Mendez,</HI> to whom
he had engaged his Word: That should this happen he promist
him solemnly I should be no Body's but his. He received this
Assurance in the same manner as if he had receiv'd a perfect
Felicity; but he knew well the Dolor I conceived thereat: I
became Pale, my Eyes were covered with Tears; and when
we were about leaving him, he desired me to draw near to
him; he told me with a languishing Tone: <HI>Fear nothing,</HI> Ma∣riana,
<HI>I love you too well to displease you; you shall have</HI> Men∣dez,
<HI>seeing your Affections are engaged to him.</HI> I answer'd him:
<HI>I had no particular Inclinations for him; but being commanded to
respect him, as a Man who was to be my Husband, I could do no o∣therwise;
however, I intreated him to be well.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This seem'd to me the least step I could take towards a
Person to whom I had so great Obligations. He appeared
thereat sufficiently satisfy'd, attempting to take my Hand and
kiss it:</HI> Remember, <HI>said he to me,</HI> you enjoyn me to live; and
that my Life being your Work you will be obliged to conserve it.
<HI>We return'd at Night, and the Impatient</HI> Mendez <HI>waited for
us, to make me new Reproaches: I took 'em as I was wont,
as Proofs of his Passion: and having justified my self, I askt
him, What News there was of the Fleet,</HI> Alas! <HI>said he to me,</HI>
my Father has receiv'd such as drives me to Dispair: I dare not
inform you. Have you any thing separate from me? <HI>said I to him,
looking tenderly on him:</HI> Would you have me to be reserved to
you? I am too Happy, <HI>replied he,</HI> in that you have such favoura∣ble
Disposition; and being not able to keep any Secret from you,
I must plainly tell you, that the Galion in which is our whole
Estate, is split and lost, running against a Rock. But <HI>I</HI> should be
less sensible, how greatly soever <HI>I</HI> am in Interest, did <HI>I</HI> not look on
the Ʋnhappy Consequences of this Loss: Your Presence will restore
the Marquess <HI>de Los Rios</HI> to his Health; his Sentiments for you
are known in your Family; he is Rich, and a great Lord: <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
become Miserable; and if you forsake me, my dear <HI>Mariana, I</HI>
shall have no more Hope but in speedy Death. <HI>I was pierced
with Sorrow at this sad News: I took one of his Hands, and
closing it with mine, I said to him,</HI> My dear <HI>Mendez,</HI> do not
think me capable of loving you, and yet leaving you, by the Effects
of your good or bad Fortune: if you be able to bear up against it,
believe me so too. <HI>I</HI> call Heaven to witness, <HI>continued I,</HI> provi∣ded
you love me, and be faithful to me, that <HI>I</HI> will never forsake
you; and let it punish me if ever <HI>I</HI> prove Inconstant.</P>
<P>He testifi'd all the acknowledgements he ought me for such
affectionate Assurances, and we resolved not to divulge this
Accident.</P>
<P><HI>I withdrew very melancholly, and shut my self up in my
Closet, ruminating on the Consequences of this sad Disaster.
I was still there, when I heard some Body knocking softly at
the Shutters of my Window: I drew near, and saw</HI> Mendez <HI>by
the Light of the Moon:</HI> What do you here, <HI>said I to him,</HI> at this
time of the Night: Alas, <HI>answer'd he to me, I</HI> was trying whe∣ther
I could speak with you before <HI>I</HI> departed: My Father has again
lately received News of the Galion, and will have me immediately
go where she is run a ground, to endeavour to save something: It
is a great way thither, and <HI>I</HI> shall be a great while without seeing
you. Ah, dear <HI>Mariana,</HI> during all this time will you be as good
as your Word to me? May <HI>I</HI> hope my dear Mistress will be faithful
to me? Wha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Reason have <HI>I</HI> given you, Mendez, <HI>said I, inter∣rupting
him,</HI> to doubt it? Yes, <HI>continued I, I</HI> will love you
the most Ʋnfortunate Man in the World.</P>
<P>It would be to abuse your Patience, Madam, to relate to you
whatsoever we said in this doleful Separation, and though
there appear'd no Danger, yet our Hearts had a foreboding of
what was afterwards to happen to us. The Day began to ap∣pear,
and we must bid Adieu: I saw him shed Tears which were
accompanied with mine.</P>
<P>I threw my self on my Bed, rowling a thousand sad Thoughts
in my Mind: and I appear'd the next Morning so out of Order,
that my Father and Mother were afraid I was falling into some
dangerous fit of Sickness.</P>
<P><HI>Mendez</HI> his Father came to make them a Visit, to excuse his
Son's parting without taking his Leave of them. He added, <HI>He
had a Business which required such hast, as would not suffer him a
Minute's time at his disposal.</HI> As to my self, Madam, I was
comfortless, being insensible to every thing. And if any thing
could ease me, 'twas some hours Conversation with my dear
<HI>Henrietta,</HI> with whom I freely vented my Thoughts touching
the long Absence of <HI>Mendez.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="75"/>
In the mean time the Marquess <HI>de Los Rios</HI> was out of Dan∣ger,
and my Father went often to see him: I observ'd one day
great Alteration on my Mothers Countenance, she and my Fa∣ther
having been long shut up by the Religioses, who came to
give 'em a Visit; and after a Conference of some time, they
called me, without my being able to divine the Cause.</P>
<P>I entred into their Apartment in such Disorder, that I knew
not what I did. One of these good Fathers, Venerable by his
Age and Habit, spake much to me about the Resignation we owe
to the Divine Will, on his Providence, in every thing which
relates to us: and the Close of his Discourse was, That <HI>Mendez</HI>
was taken by the <HI>Algerines,</HI> that he was a Slave; and by his
Misfortunes these Pyrates had learnt he was a rich Merchants
Son, which had occasioned the setting him at an extraordinary
Ransom: That they were at <HI>Algiers</HI> in the time he arriv'd;
they would have willingly brought him along with 'em, but the
Money which they had for all, was not sufficient for him alone.
That at their Return they had been at his Fathers to inform
him of this Vexatious Disaster; but found he had absented him∣self,
that the loss of a Gallion, on which was embarkt all
his Effects, without being able to save any thing, had induced
him to avoid his Creditors, who sought him every where, to
throw him in Prison. That things being in this Condition,
they saw no Remedy to poor <HI>Mendez</HI> his Misfortunes, being in
the hands of <HI>Meluza</HI> the most famous and covetous of all the
Corsaries; and that if I would follow their Advice, and that
of my Parents, I would think of taking another Party. I had
so far heard this Dreadful News in so ecstatic a Condition, that
I could only interrupt them by sad Sighs; but when he told
me, I must think of another Party; I burst out with Tears
and Shrieks, as made both my Father and Mother, and these
Religioses compassionate me.</P>
<P>I was carried into my Chamber as one nearer death than life;
and <HI>Donna Henrietta</HI> was sent for, and it was not without great
Affliction she beheld me in this sad Condition. I fell into a
most deep Melancholly, I tormented my self day and night, and
nothing was able to remove my dear <HI>Mendez</HI> out of my Mind.</P>
<P>The Marquess <HI>de Los Rios,</HI> having learnt what had past,
conceiv'd such strong Hopes, that he soon found himself in a
Condition to come and Claim of my Father and me the Effect
of the Words we had given him. I shewed him that mine
were not disengaged in respect of <HI>Mendez;</HI> that he was Un∣fortunate,
which no ways lessen'd my Engagements to him.
He heard me without being perswaded by me, and told me,
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
I had the same desire of destroying my self as others had of
saving themselves; that 'twas more my interest than his, which
made him act as he did. And being ravisht with having a Pre∣tence
which seemed to him plausible, he prest my Father with
such earnestness, that he at length consented to what he desired.</P>
<P><HI>It is impossible for me to represent to you, Madam, in
what an Abyss of Sorrow I was in:</HI> What is become of my Lord,
<HI>said I to the Marquess,</HI> of that Scrupulous Tenderness which hin∣dered
you from taking my heart from any other hand than my
own? Let me at least have some time to forget <HI>Mendez.</HI> Perhaps
his Absence and Misfortunes may prevail on me to some Indifferency
towards him. To this cruel Accident, which has snatched him so
lately from me, you add new Troubles when you expect I should so
speedily pass over from him to you.</P>
<P>I know not what I expect or may hope for, <HI>said he to me,</HI> but
this I am sure of, that my Complaisance had like to have cost me my
Life, that if you be not designed for me, you will be anothers,
and as to <HI>Mendez,</HI> his Fortune has been such, that he can no longer
pretend to you, and seeing you must be disposed of, I think you are
very hard hearted to refuse me. You cannot be ignorant of what
I have done hitherto to please you, my former Proceeding should
serve as a sufficient Testimony of my future Respects.</P>
<P>The Marquess made a greater progress in my Fathers Mind,
than mine. In a word, My Mother having one day sent for
me, told me, 'Twas to no purpose to use any longer Delays,
my Father being resolv'd I should obey his Orders. Whatever,
I could say to excuse my self, my Tears, my Remonstrances,
Entreaties were all to no purpose, and serv'd only to exaspe∣rate
my Mother.</P>
<P>All things necessary were prepared for my Marriage, the
Marquess would have every thing suitable to his Quality. He
sent me a Cabinet of Jewels and Precious Stones, to the value
of several thousand Crowns. The fatal Day for our Wedding
was set. Seeing my self reduced to this Extremity, I took a
resolution which will surprize you, Madam, and demonstrate
a great Passion.</P>
<P><HI>I went to</HI> Donna Henrietta; <HI>this Friend had been ever faith∣ful
to me, and threw my self at her feet, surprizing her by so
extraordinary a Carriage: My dear</HI> Henrietta, <HI>said I to her,
melting in Tears,</HI> there is no Remedy to my Misfortunes, unless
you have pity on me; do not abandon me, let me conjure you in the
sad Condition I am in; to morrow I must marry the Marquess <HI>de
Los Rios,</HI> I can no longer avoid it. If the Offers of Friendship
you have made me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Proof against all Tryal, and can make you
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
capable of a generous Resolution, you will not refuse to follow my
Fortune, and to accompany me to <HI>Algiers</HI> to pay <HI>Mendez</HI> his Ran∣som,
to redeem him from the Cruel Slavery he is in. You see me
at your Feet, <HI>continued I,</HI> I will never rise till you have given me
your Word, to do what I desire you. <HI>She seemed so concern'd at
my Posture, that I arose to make her answer me. She imme∣diately
embraced me with great Testimonies of Tenderness: I</HI>
will refuse you nothing, my dear <HI>Mariana, said she to me,</HI> were
it my very Life; but you are going to ruin your self and me with
you. How can two Girls execute what you project? Our Age, our
Sex, and your Beauty, will expose us to Accidents, the bare ima∣gination
of which makes me to tremble: this is certain, we are go∣ing
to overwhelm our Families with Shame and Confusion; and if
you had made serious Reflections hereon, it is not possible you could
have come to this Resolution. Ah, barbarous! <HI>cryed I,</HI> and more
barbarous than he that detains my Lover; you forsake me, but
tho' I am alone, yet that shall not hinder me from pursuing my
Point, neither can the assistance you should give me stand me in
much stead: Remain, remain, I consent, it is fit I should depart
without any comfort to affront all Dangers; I confess such an un∣dertaking
is fit only for a Desperate Creature.</P>
<P>My Reproaches and Tears moved <HI>Henrietta,</HI> she told me my
Interest had obliged her as much as her own to speak to me as
she had done; but in short, seeing I persisted in my first Re∣solution,
and nothing could divert me from it, she was resol∣ved
I should not go alone; That if I would be ruled by her,
we should disguise our selves; that she would undertake to get
two Suits of Mens Apparel, and as for the rest, it belong'd
to me to take care of it. I embraced her with a thousand
Testimonies of Thankfulness.</P>
<P>I afterwards askt her, Whether she had seen the Jewels
which the Marquess had sent me: <HI>I will bring them,</HI> said I to her,
<HI>to purchase</HI> Mendez'<HI>s Ransom with them.</HI> We resolv'd to lose
no time, and we neither of us fail'd in what we had projected.</P>
<P>Never were two Maidens better disguised under the Habit
of two Cavaliers. We parted that Night, and embarkt our
selves without the least Obstacle, but after some days Sail we
were overtaken by so violent a Storm, as made us despair of
our Safety. In all this Disorder and Peril, I was less concern∣ed
for my self, than for not having compassed my dear <HI>Mendez's</HI>
Liberty, and for having engaged <HI>Henrietta</HI> to follow my ill For∣tune:
<HI>It is,</HI> said I to her, in embracing her, <HI>it is my dear
Companion, that has rais'd this Storm, were I not on the Sea it
would be Calm; my Misfortune follows me where-ever I go.</HI> In fine,
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
we having been a Day and two Nights in continual Alarums,
the Weather chang'd, and we arriv'd at <HI>Algiers.</HI></P>
<P>I was so glad to see my self in a Condition to deliver <HI>Mendez,</HI>
that I reckon'd all the Dangers we underwent as nothing:
But alas, what became of me in disembarking, when after all
the search which could be made, I perceiv'd there was no
hope of finding the little Cabinet wherein I had put all I had
was most precious: I found my self seiz'd with such violent
Grief, that I thought I should have expired before I got out of
the Vessel. Without doubt this Cabinet, which was little, and
of which I took but small Care during the Tempest, fell into
the Sea, or was stole, which ever of these two it was, I had
a considerable Loss, and I had only remaining Jewels to the
value of a thousand Pounds, which I had kept for all Events
about me.</P>
<P>I resolv'd with this, to make a tryal with <HI>Mendez</HI>'s Patron:
As soon as we were in the Town, we enquired out his House,
(for <HI>Meluza</HI> was well known) and went thither clad as Gentlemen.</P>
<P>I cannot express to you, Madam, the trouble I was in draw∣ing
near this House, where I knew my dear Lover languisht in
Chains, what sad Reflections did I not make, how did I look
when I enter'd the Corsary's House, and saw <HI>Mendez</HI> Chain'd,
with several others, who were leading out to work in the Field.
I should have fallen at his Feet, had not <HI>Henrietta</HI> born me up,
I no longer knew where I was, nor what I did; I would have
spoken to him but Grief had so seiz'd on my Spirits, that my
Tongue could not utter a Word. As to him, he beheld me
not, he was so sad and deprest, that he could look on on body,
and one must love him as much as I did, to know him, so great∣ly
was he changed.</P>
<P>After having been some time coming to my self, I went into
a low Room, where I was told <HI>Meluza</HI> was, I saluted him, and
told him the occasion of my Voyage, that <HI>Mendez</HI> was my near
Relation, that he was undone by the Loss of a Gallion, and his
Captivity together, and that 'twas out of my own Money that
I would pay his Ransom. The <HI>Moor</HI> appeared to be a little con∣cern'd.
It was not his business to enquire whence I had my
Money, but this he certainly knew, that <HI>Mendez</HI> was Rich,
and to shew that he would not take all Advantages, he would
therefore set him at twenty thousand Crowns.</P>
<P>Alas, what would this have been, had I not lost my Jewels?
but this was too much in the Condition I was in. In fine, af∣ter
several long fruitless Disputes. I took on me immediately a
resolution which could only be inspired by an extream Love.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79"/>
Here's all I have, <HI>said I to to the Pyrate, in giving him my
Diamonds,</HI> they are not worth what thou demandest: take me for
thy Slave, and be perswaded thou wilt not keep me long. I am
the only Daughter of a Rich Banker of <HI>Seville;</HI> keep me for an
Hostage, and let <HI>Mendez</HI> go; he will soon return to Redeem me.
<HI>The</HI> Barbarian <HI>was surpriz'd to find me capable of so generous
and affectionate a Resolution.</HI> Thou art worthy, <HI>said he to me,</HI>
of a better Fortune. Be it so; I accept the Condition you offer me:
I will take care of thee, and be a good Patron to thee. Thou must
leave the Habit thou wearest, to put on one agreeable to thy Sex:
thou shalt keep thy Jewels if thou wilt, I can as well stay for the
whole as for a part.</P>
<P><HI>Donna Henrietta</HI> was so confused and dismayed at the Bargain
I came from concluding, that she could not sufficiently express
her Displeasure to me; but in fine, maugre all her Remon∣strances
and Entreaties, I held firm, and <HI>Meluza</HI> caus'd a Slaves
Habit to be brought me, which I put on.</P>
<P>He conducted me to his Wives Chamber, to whom he de∣livered
me, having recounted to her what I had done for my
Lover's Liberty.</P>
<P>She seemed to be much effected with it, and promised she
would shorten the time of my Servitude by all the good Treat∣ments
she could make me.</P>
<P>At Night, when <HI>Mendez</HI> returned, <HI>Meluza</HI> caused him to be
called, telling him, That being of <HI>Seville,</HI> he would there∣fore
shew him a Slave he had bought, because perhaps he might
know her.</P>
<P>Immediately I was brought before him; <HI>Mendez</HI> at this sight
losing all Countenance, came and cast himself at my Feet, and
taking my Hands, which he bathed with his Tears, he said
every thing which was most tender and affectionate to me.
<HI>Meluza</HI> and his Wife diverted themselves, in seeing the diffe∣rent
Motions of Joy and Grief with which we were agitated;
in fine, they inform'd <HI>Mendez</HI> of the Obligations he had to me;
that he was free, and that I would remain in his place. He
did whatever could be done to disswade me from taking this
Task on me: <HI>Alas,</HI> said he to me, <HI>you would have me load you
with my Chains, my dear Mistress; Shall I be free, when you
are not? I go then to do for you what you come from doing for me;
I will sell my self and Redeem you with this Money: for in fine,
consider that should I as soon as I arrive at</HI> Seville, <HI>find Assistance,
and return again to bring you back, yet how is it possible for me in
the mean time to leave you; judge how I can do this in in a time
wherein my Fortune promises me nothing, and am the most Ʋnhap∣py
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
of all men.</HI> I offered against all the Reasons of Tenderness
of my Father, who would soon Redeem me when he knew
where I was. In fine, I made use of all the Power I had over
his Mind, to make his Advantage of what I had done in his Fa∣vour.</P>
<P>What shall I say to you, Madam, of our Separation? It was
so dolorous, that words cannot express what we felt. I ob∣liged
<HI>Henrietta</HI> to part with him, to solicite and press my
Parents to do their part in my behalf.</P>
<P>In the mean time my Father and Mother were in an uncon∣ceivable
Affliction, and when they perceived my flight, they
thought to die with Grief.</P>
<P>They blamed themselves infinitely for forcing me to marry
the Marquess <HI>de Los Rios.</HI> He was for his part no less in Despair;
they caused me to be searcht for in vain, in all places where
they thought I might have hid my self.</P>
<P>Two whole Years were past without my receiving any News
or Succours from <HI>Mendez;</HI> which made me believe with great
likelihood, that both he and <HI>Henrietta</HI> were cast away on the
Sea: I had given them all the Jewels which <HI>Meluza</HI> had left
me; but it was not their Loss, nor that of my Liberty, which
I regretted: It was of my dear Lover and faithful Friend,
whose Remembrance continually possest me, and caused me an
unparallel'd Affliction: I could get no Rest nor Health; I wept
Day and Night, I refused to come out of my Slavery in neg∣lecting
to signifie to my Father my present Condition. I wisht
only for a speedy Death; which I would have willingly met
with, to put an end to my Troubles and Misfortunes.</P>
<P><HI>Meluza</HI> and his Wife began to pity me, they did not doubt
but <HI>Mendez</HI> was cast away: they treated me less cruelly, than
these sort of People are wont to use those Unhappy Wretches
who fall into their Hands.</P>
<P>One day, as <HI>Meluza</HI> came from Pyrating, he brought with
him several Persons of both Sexes which he had taken, and
among the rest a Young Woman of some Quality of <HI>Seville,</HI>
and whom I knew. This sight renewed my Grief: she was
much surprized to find me in this sad place. We affectionately
embraced one another, and observing a deep silence; <HI>How now
Beautiful</HI> Mariana, said she to me, <HI>are you so indifferent towards
your Relations and Country, that you have no Curiosity to make
any Enquiries about them?</HI> I lifted up mine Eyes to Heaven in
uttering a deep Sigh; I entreated her to tell me, If 'twere
known where <HI>Mendez</HI> and <HI>Henrietta</HI> were lost? <HI>Who has told
you they are lost?</HI> replied she, <HI>they are at</HI> Seville, <HI>where they
<PB N="78" REF="81"/>
lead a very happy Life.</HI> Mendez <HI>has re-establisht his affairs, and
makes it his great Delight and Honour to publish in all places the
Extream Obligations he has to</HI> Henrietta. <HI>Perhaps you are igno∣rant,</HI>
continued she, <HI>that</HI> Mendez <HI>was taken and made a Slave
by the</HI> Algerines; <HI>this generous young Woman disguised her self,
and came hither to redeem him, but he has not been ungrateful, for
he has married her. There is a most charming Ʋnion between them,</HI>
Hymen <HI>has not banisht Love in their Particular.</HI></P>
<P>As she was yet speaking, she perceiv'd my Countenance to
after on a sudden, and that I was ready to faint: my Strength
fail'd me, mine Eyes closed, and I sunk down between her
Arms, she was greatly troubled at this; she called my Com∣panions,
who put me to Bed, and endeavoured to recover me
from this pitious Condition.</P>
<P>This young Woman greatly concerned her self for me, and
when I came to my self, I began to complain; I uttered Sighs
and Groans able to move a Rock.</P>
<P><HI>Meluza</HI> was affected at the Recital of such a worse than bar∣barous
Instance of Treachery, and without any notice to me,
he informed himself, by his new Slave of my Fathers Name,
and immediately wrote to him what he knew of my Misfortunes.</P>
<P>These Letters were like to have been the Death of my Mo∣ther,
she could not imagine I could be in Chains at eighteen
Years of Age, without shedding a torrent of Tears: But that
which augmented her Grief, was, the Disorder of my Fathers
Affairs; several considerable Bankrupts had ruined him, his
Credit was gone, and it was impossible for him to procure
the 20000 Crowns which <HI>Meluza</HI> demanded for my Ransom.</P>
<P>The Generous Marquess <HI>de Los Rios,</HI> heard this News, came
to my Father, and offered him what lay in his Power: <HI>I do not
do this,</HI> said he, <HI>in design to force your Daughters inclinations
when she shall be here; I shall love her always, but I will never
displease her.</HI> My Father having no other way of Relief, thank∣fully
accepted of what was offered him; and in a word, em∣barkt
himself, and happily arrived at <HI>Algiers,</HI> in the time when
I thought only of dying.</P>
<P>He forbore all those Reproaches I deserv'd, he redeemed me,
and at my Intreaty, this young Woman of <HI>Sevelle,</HI> for a mo∣derate
Ransom. We return'd together, and my Mother re∣ceived
me with such Joy as is impossible to be exprest. I an∣swered
hereto as much as was possible; but I carried always in
my Heart, Madam, the fatal Stroke which had wounded me:
Whatever my Reason could represent to me, was not sufficient
to eface out of my Remembrance the Image of the Traitor
<HI>Mendez.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="82"/>
I saw the Marquess <HI>de Los Rios:</HI> he dared not mention the
inclinations he still had towards me; but I had such pressing
Obligations to him, that Gratitude made me do for him, what
my Inclinations would have made me do for another.</P>
<P>I gave him my Hand, and he his to me, with such Affection,
as if he had no solid Matter of Complaint against me.</P>
<P>In fine, I married him, and apprehending lest I should see
<HI>Mendez,</HI> that Ungrateful Wretch, to whom Lowe such Hor∣rour,
and for whom I had so little, I prayed the Marquess we
might dwell in the Country-house he had near <HI>Seville.</HI></P>
<P>He ever approved o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what I liked: he would have my Father
and Mother retire, he lessened the sad Condition of their
Fortune, by considerable Liberalities: and I may truly say,
there never was a greater Soul. Judge, Madam, of all the
Reproaches I made my Heart for its not being so tender to him
as it ought to have been: it was not in my power to forget
<HI>Mendez,</HI> and I always felt new Regrets, when I learnt his Feli∣city
with the unfaithful <HI>Henrietta.</HI></P>
<P>Having past two Years in a continual watching over my
self, that I might do nothing but what was agreeable to my
Husband, Heaven deprived me of him, of this Generous Hus∣band:
and he did for me in these last Moments, what he had
already heretofore done, giving me all he had, with such
Testimonies of Esteem and Affection, as much enhanced the
Price of the Gift: He made me the richest Widow of <HI>Andalou∣sia,</HI>
but he could not make me the happiest.</P>
<P>I would not return to <HI>Seville,</HI> where my Parents would have
had me been; and to avoid it, I pretended a Journey farther
into the Country, to look after some part of my Estate. I set
out; but there being a particular Fatality in whatever relates
to me, in arriving at an Inn, the first Object which struck
my sight, was the Unfaithful <HI>Mendez:</HI> he was in deep
Mourning, and had not lost nothing of whatever made me here∣tofore
fancy him too Lovely. It is impossible to express
the Condition I was in, for endeavouring to get speedily from
him, I found my self so weak and trembling, that I fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l at his Feet.
Although he knew me not at that instant, yet he earnestly en∣deavoured
to raise me up; but the great Veil under which I
was concealed, flying open, what became of him in seeing me?
He remained no less confused than I was: He would have drawn
near to me, but casting a furious Look on him: <HI>Darest thou,
Perjured Wretch!</HI> said I to him, <HI>darest thou approach me!
Art thou not afraid of the just Punishment of thy Perfidiousness?</HI>
He was some time without answering me, and I was about
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
leaving him when he stopt me: <HI>Confound and over-whelm me
with Reproaches, Madam,</HI> said he to me: <HI>Give me the worst
and most perfidious Names as is possible; they cannot be more than
I deserve: But my Death shall soon revenge your Quarrel: I
ought to die with Sorrow for having betray'd you; and if I regret
any thing in dying, it is only the having one Life to lose to expi∣ate
all the Crimes you can justly accuse me of.</HI> He appeared to me
much affected in ending these words; and would to Heavens
his Repentance were really sufficient and true? I would not
hazard a long Conversation with him: I le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t him, disdaining
to return him an Answer. And this Mark of Contempt and
Slighting, was, without doubt, more sensible to him, than all
the reproaches I might have made him,</P>
<P>He had some time since lost his Wife, that Unfaithful Crea∣ture,
who had helpt him to Revolt against all the Offices of
Love, Honour, and Gratitude. And from that time he fol∣lowed
me every where: he was like a Complaining Shadow,
ever fastned to my Feet; for he became so lean, pale, and
changed, that he was no longer discernable. Heavens! Ma∣dam,
what Violence did I not offer my self, in continuing to
ill Treat him: I found at last I wanted Strength to resist the
Weakness of my Heart, and the Ascendant this Wretch had o∣ver
me. Rather than to commit so shameful an Offence, and
to Forgive him, I parted for <HI>Madrid,</HI> where I have Relations,
and sought among them a She<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter against the Violence of mine
own inclinations.</P>
<P>I was not there long but <HI>Mendez</HI> found me out: I must con∣fess
to you, I was not heartily displeased at his Attendance on
me, but maugre my inclination towards him. I put on a firm
Resolution to avoid him, seeing I could not sincerely hate
him; and unknown to every Body, I took the Road to <HI>Burgos,</HI>
where I am going to Cloyster my self with a Religious there,
my Friend. I flatter my self, Madam, with the Hopes of
finding more Rest there, than I have hitherto met with.</P>
<P>The Beautiful Marchioness here held her peace; and I testi∣fied
to her my particular Acknowledgments for the Favour she
had done me: I assured her of the part I took in her Adven∣tures.
I conjured her to write to me, and to let me hear from
her at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and she promised it me in the most obliging
manner as is possible.</P>
<P>We found the next Morning we could not set out, it having
snowed all the Night, and no Path appearing on the Ground;
but we wanted not Company to pass the time in Play and Dis∣course.
Having been three days with the Marchioness <HI>de Los
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
Rios,</HI> without any Weariness at the length of the Time, through
the pleasure I had of seeing and hearing her talk (for she is one
of the most lovely Women in the World:) We parted with a
mutual Regret, and it was not without doubling our promises
of Writing to, and seeing one another hereafter.</P>
<P>The Weather mended, and I continued on my Journey to
<HI>Lerma:</HI> We had traverst dreadful Mountains, which bear the
Name of <HI>Sierra de Cogollos,</HI> and it was not without great trou∣ble
we got thither: This Town is small, she has given her
Name to the famous Cardinal <HI>de Lerma,</HI> Chief Minister to
<HI>Philip</HI> III: it is from him that <HI>Philip</HI> IV. took the great Reve∣nues
he had received from the King his Master. Here is a Castle
which I will see to Morrow, and of which I shall give you an
Account in my next. I am told an Extraordinary Express is
arrived, and will set out to Night: I will lay hold of this Op∣portunity
of sending to you, and ending this long Letter, for
in truth I am tired both with the Way, and with Writing, but
I shall never be weary of Loving you.</P>

<HEAD>A Relation of a Voyage to Spain, in
several Letters. Part II.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>MY Last was so long and I was so weary when I
ended it, that I could not add some Particulars,
which probably might not have been unwelcome
to you; I proceed then (dear Kinswoman) to re∣count
them, seeing you so much desired it.</P>
<P>I arrived late at <HI>Lerma,</HI> and resolved to tarry some time to
see the Castle which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> so highly esteem, that they
prize it next the <HI>Escurial;</HI> and it is indeed a very fine place.
The Cardinal <HI>de Lerma, Philip</HI> the Third's Favourite, was its
Founder. It stands on the side of an Hill, and in your way to
it you must pass through a spacious place, surrounded with
Arches and Galleries about it. This Castle consists of four vast
Piles of building, which makes a compleat Quadrangle of two
Ranges of Porches within the Court, which are near as high as
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
the Roof, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inder the apartments from Prospects on that
side. The Windows of all the Chambers look forward into the
Country; the Rooms are spacious, and the Lodgings very fine
and curiously gilt. There are a Prodigious number of them,
and very well furnisht. Near the Castle you have a great Park
which extends it self along the Plain, through which runs a Ri∣ver,
and several le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er Springs: On the side of the River, there
are rows of great Trees, and not far hence a Wood, so that
I believe, in fine weather this is a delightful place.</P>
<P>The keeper of the Castle askt me, whether I would see the
Religioses, whose Convent is adjoyning thereunto. I told him
most willingly; so that he made us pass through a Gallery, at the
end of which you meet with a Grate which reaches from top to
bottom. The Abbess, having been advertised of it, came here
with several Religioses, who were very entertaining, handsome,
witty and young, discoursing with great exactness of every
thing. I was not weary of their Conversation, when a young
Girl came and whispered the Abbess in the Ear, who afterwards
told me there was a Lady of great Quality, who had retired in∣to
their House, being the Daughter of Don <HI>Mandrica de Lara,</HI>
Count <HI>de Valine,</HI> and eldest Son to the Duke <HI>de Naxara;</HI> That
she was Widow of Don <HI>Francisco Fernandez de Castro,</HI> Count <HI>de
Lemos</HI> Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Duke <HI>de Tauresano;</HI> that when
she knew of <HI>French</HI> Ladies passing through <HI>Lerma,</HI> she was great∣ly
desirous of entertaining them. I made answer, I should be
glad of the honour of seeing her: Whereupon this young Girl
was sent to her.</P>
<P>This Lady soon came in a Dress used by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> this
hundred years; she had a kind of Pattins on, or rather Stilts,
which made her look prodigious Tall, so that she was fain to
lean on two Persons Shoulders when she moved. She leaned
likewise on two Daughters of the Marquess <HI>del Carpio,</HI> one of
them is of a very fair Complexion, which is rare in this Coun∣try,
and the others Hair is as black as Jet. Their Beauty sur∣prized
me, and they wanted only, in my mind, to be a little
fat. But this is not reckoned a Defect in this Country, where
they fancy leanness so much, that they desire only to have Skin
and Bone. The singular Dress of the Countess <HI>de Lemos,</HI> ap∣peared
to me so extraordinary, that I could hardly get mine
eyes off of it. She wore a kind of Black Sattin Gold embroider∣ed
Bodice, and buttoned with great Rubies of considerable
value. This Bodice came down from her Neck just like a
Doublet; her Sleeves were strait, with large Wings about her
shoulders, and other Sleeves hanging as low as her Gown, which
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
were fastened on each side with Roses of Diamonds; She had
a dreadful Virdingal, which hindred her from sitting, other∣wise
then on the Ground. She wore a Ruff, and several Chains
of great Pearls and Diamonds; her Hair was white, which she
hid under a Coverture of black Lace, for she was no less than
75 years old. She seemed to me to have been a great Beauty
in her time; her face had not a wrinkle, and her eyes were
still sparkling, and her white and red Paint became her very
well: Her wit and Personage, as I have been told, were
not a little famous in the World. I lookt upon her as a curious
Piece of Antiquity.</P>
<P>She told me she had the honour to Accompany the Infanta
when she espoused <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth. That she became ac∣quainted
with the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> when he was in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
and the Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> came thither. You have seen this
Queen, <HI>said I to her, interrupting her,</HI> be pleased, Madam, to
favour me with a Relation of some Particulars of her humor.</P>
<P>You must know then, <HI>said she,</HI> that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> sent
Don <HI>Antonio Pimentel</HI> in quality of Ambassador to <HI>Stockholm,</HI>
to discover, as much as in him lay, the Intentions of the
<HI>Swedes.</HI> They had been long Enemies to the House of <HI>Austria,</HI>
and it was not doubted but they would make new attempts to
thwart it, in the design of making the Emperours Son King of
the <HI>Romans; Pimentel</HI> was charged to carry on this Affair with
great Circumspection. He was a gallant, witty and handsome
Person, and he succeeded better than could be expected. He
immediately discovered the Queens <HI>Genius,</HI> and easily made
himself her Confident. He soon perceived she was mightily
charmed with Novelties, and that of the crowd of Strangers
which she drew to the Court, the last come was the most fa∣voured.
He made it his Task to please her, and gained so far
on her Affections, that he became informed by her self of the
most secret Affairs, and which she ought the most to conceal
from him. But what cannot he do, who has found a way to
the heart. The Queens was so inclined to him, that he became
the sole Disposer of the Affections of this Princess, and by this
means was able to write to the Emperour, and to the Electors,
things so certain and agreeable, as made them easily judge that
the Queen of <HI>Sweedlands</HI> Council had no part in the Declara∣tion
she made in favour of the King of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>This Intrigue being at an end, 'twas thought the King would
recal <HI>Pimentel,</HI> there appearing no occasion requiring the Pre∣sence
of an Ambassador: But if it were needless for the King
of <HI>Spain,</HI> that he should remain at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> 'twas not the same
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
with the Queen, she neglecting nothing whereby to retain him
near her. He attended where-ever she went since, and many,
who were led by outward Appearances, judged when she left
the Crown to her Cosen, she did it with great Satisfaction, be∣cause
she did it with dry Eyes, and had the Courage to harangue
the States with great Force and Eloquence; but the People
were greatly mistaken in the secret Motives of this Princess.
Her soul at that time was pierced with the most lovely sorrow;
she was not a little grieved to yield to the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> a
Scepter which she thought her self worthy to wield alone, and
of which she was Lawful Heiress.</P>
<P>This Prince had the Address to get it declared, that if she
married she should chuse him for her Husband.</P>
<P>Assoon as this Declaration was made, she began to feel the
weight of the subjection wherein she was placed; and on the
other hand, the People did not well relish the being governed
by a Woman. They insisted more on her Defects than they
minded her Vertues. The Prince contributed under-hand
thereto, and the Queen, who was penetrating, soon per∣ceived
it; she observed the Inclination the People had to him,
and the wishes which were made to see him in the Throne;
she grew every day more and more jealous of this, and past
from hence such a deadly Hatred, that 'twas impossible for
her to stop the Course of it. The Princess presence became so
insupportable to her, that perceiving it, he withdrew into an
Island which belonged to him. But he set not out till he had
left good <HI>Memoires</HI> to his Creatures against the Queens Conduct.</P>
<P>When she saw her self delivered from an Object, whose sight
was so great an Eye sore, she drew off her Mind from the too
intent pursuit of the Affairs of the Kingdom, and gave way to
her Inclinations to Books. Her marvellous Wit made, in a
short time, admirable Progresses in the most profound Scien∣ces;
but these were not so needful to her as a good Conduct
in the management of her Honour and Interest. It often hap∣pens,
that having spent several days in her Study, she would
appear disgusted with her Books, saying, They were good for
nothing but to wast the Spirits, and mislead Mens Judgments.
When the Great Men of the Court saw her in this Disposition,
they approacht her with more familiarity, and then the whole
Business was to follow the Pleasures of Love, of Plays, Balls,
Turneys, Huntings, and all other Diversions. She gave up
her self entirely to them, and nothing could bring her off them;
but she added to this Defect that of enriching Strangers, at the
Expence of her own Subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="88"/>
The <HI>Swedes</HI> began to murmur at this; the Queen was ad∣vertised
of it; their Complaints appeared to be unjust, and
little respectful; and being not a little offended at them, she
was so unwise as to take Vengeance on her self. In effect, at
the time when 'twas least expected, and when she was in a Con∣dition
to find less violent Remedies, she abandoned at one
stroak her Crown and Kingdom to her Cosen; to this Cosen,
I say, whom she was so far from loving, that she wish'd him all
the ill she was able; and yet to whom she did so much good,
she thought 'twas impossible for any to penetrate into the Mo∣tives
of this. She pretended by this great stroak of Generosi∣ty,
to distinguish her self from among the Heroina's of the most
famous Ages: But in effect, the Conduct she held afterwards,
distinguished her only to her Disadvantage.</P>
<P>She was seen to set out from <HI>Swedeland</HI> in a very odd Dress for
a Woman with a kind of Justaucorps, a short Petticoat, with
Boots and Cravat, in a Perriwig, a Hat covered with Feathers,
and this Perriwig tied up in a lock behind, which seemed then
very ridiculous. She forbad all her Women to follow her,
choosing only Men to serve her, and attend her. She was
wont ordinarily to say, That she did not love Men as Men,
but because they were not Women. So that she seemed to
have renounced her Sex in renouncing her States, although she
had sometimes such Weaknesses, as would have made the mean∣est
Women ashamed.</P>
<P>The trusty <HI>Pimentel</HI> past over into <HI>Flanders</HI> with her, and I
being then there, <HI>continues she,</HI> I saw him arrive; he procured
me the honour to kiss her hand, and there needed no less than
his Credit to obtain this: for she sent word to all the Ladies of
<HI>Brussels</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> she would excuse them for their Visits.
Yet she received me very well, and the little she said to me,
appeared full of Wit and extraordinary Vivacity; but she swore
at every turn like a Souldier, and her Words and Actions were
so free, not to say so dishonest, that were it not for her Rank,
her Person would have been little regarded.</P>
<P>She spake before every Body of the passionate desire she
had to see the Prince of <HI>Conde;</HI> that his great Actions had
charmed her, and that she was desirous to learn the Trade of
War nnder him. The Prince had no less desire to see her, than
she testified to see him. In the midst of this mutual Impati∣ence,
the Queen stopt on a sudden on some Formalities and
Steps which she refused to take, when he should come to sa∣lute
her. These Reasons hindred her from seeing her with the
usual Ceremonies. But one day, when the Queen's Chamber
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
was full of Courtiers, the Prince slipt therein; whether she
had seen his Picture, or that his Martial Ayr had distinguished
him from among other, she had singled him out, and knew
him. She would immediately hereupon have testified as much
to him, by extraordinary Civilities. He presently retired,
and she followed to conduct him. Then he stopt, and content∣ed
himself with saying these words, <HI>Either All, or Nothing.</HI>
Some few days after, an Interview was set on foot to be be∣tween
them in the <HI>Mall</HI> in the Park at <HI>Brussels,</HI> where they spake
together with great Civility and much Coldness.</P>
<P>As to Don <HI>Antonio Pimentel,</HI> the Favours she has had for
him, have made noise enough to come to your Ears, and if
you be ignorant of them, Madam, I believe I ought not to un∣dertake
to learn you the Particulars, of which perhaps I my
self may have been ill informed. She held her peace, and I
made my profit of this moment to thank her for Complaisance
in giving me an account of a Queen, who has ever given me
such a great Curiosity. She askt me afterwards, whether I had
seen the Castle of <HI>Lerma.</HI> He that built it, <HI>said she,</HI> was Fa∣vourite
to <HI>Philip</HI> the Third, whose Death hapned very strange∣ly.
This Prince, <HI>continued she,</HI> was writing Letters in his Clo∣set,
and it being very cold that day, they had placed very
near him a quick fire of Coals, whose reverberation struck so
much on his face, that he was all in water, as if a great quanti∣ty
of it had been poured on his Head. The easiness of his tem∣per
hindred him from complaining, and even speaking of it;
for he never found fault with any thing. The Marquess <HI>de Po∣bar</HI>
having observ'd the incommodiousness which the King re∣ceived
by this extream heat, advertised the Duke <HI>de Alva's</HI> Gen∣tleman
of his Chamber of it, to the end he might remove the
Fire away: He replied, It was not his Office, and that the
Duke <HI>Duesda</HI> ought to be made acquainted with it whose pro∣per
Business it was. The Marquess <HI>de Pobar</HI> being troubled to
see the King thus suffer, and not daring himself to ease him,
for fear of invading anothers Province, left the fire still in its
place; but he sent to give notice of it to the Duke <HI>Duesda,</HI> who
was by Misfortune gone near <HI>Madrid</HI> to see a stately House he
was there building. Word was brought of this again to the Mar∣quess
<HI>de Pobar,</HI> who proposed again to the Duke <HI>de Alva</HI> the taking
away the fire. But he found him so inflexible hereunto, and chose
rather to send into the Country, to the Duke <HI>Duesda,</HI> so that be∣fore
he was come, the King was almost spent, and that very
Night he fell into a violent Fever, accompanied with an Erisi∣pellis,
which inflamed, and the inflammation degenerated into the
Purples, which caused his Death.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="90"/>
I must confess, <HI>said she,</HI> that having seen when I was abroad
in the World, other Courts besides our own, I could not for∣bear
blaming these kind of Ceremonies and Punctilio's which
hinder the taking of one step faster than another, tho' life de∣pended
thereon. The old Countess of <HI>Lemo's</HI> loved to talk, and
continuing her Discourse, and among other names mentioned
that of the Count <HI>de Villa Mediana.</HI> I have heard, said I <HI>inter∣rupting
her,</HI> that this Gentleman, being one day in the Church
of our Lady <HI>de Arocha,</HI> and finding there a <HI>Religio's,</HI> who begged
for the Souls in <HI>Purgatory,</HI> he gave them a piece of four pounds.
<HI>Ah my Lord,</HI> said the good Father, <HI>you have now delivered a
Soul.</HI> The <HI>Count</HI> drew out again a like piece and put it into
the Bason. <HI>Here's,</HI> continued the <HI>Religioso, another Soul deli∣ved:</HI>
He gave him in this manner six, one after another, and at
the droping of each piece, the <HI>Monk</HI> cryed <HI>Here's a Soul deli∣vered
from</HI> Purgatory. <HI>Will you be positive in it,</HI> replyed the
<HI>Count. Yes, my Lord</HI> replyed the <HI>Monk, I am certain they are
now in</HI> Heaven. <HI>Give me now then back again my six pieces,</HI> said,
he, <HI>for they signifie nothing to you, seeing the Souls are already got
to</HI> Heaven, <HI>there's no danger of their returning again to</HI> Purgatory.
It was as you relate, <HI>Added the Countess,</HI> but he took not again
his Money, for this would have been among us an horrid <HI>Sacri∣ledge.</HI>
And I knew a man of good quality, who being much
behind in the World, yet when he was dying, would have
fifteen thousand Masses to be said for him. His last Will was
executed, and his poor Creditors defrauded, for how just soe∣ver
their Debts be, they can expect to receive nothing, till such
time as all the Masses which are left in the Will be said. And
this has given occasion to that common saying among us, <HI>That
such an one has made his Soul his Heir;</HI> whereby is meant, that
he has left his Estate to the <HI>Church</HI> to say Prayers for him.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth ordered in his will an hundred thou∣sand
<HI>Masses</HI> to be said for him; farther declaring, That should
he cease needing them, they should serve for his Father and
Mother, and in case they were got to <HI>Heaven,</HI> they should be appli'd
to the Souls of those who were slain in the Wars of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>But what I have already told you of the Count <HI>de Villa Me∣diana,</HI>
brings to my mind, that he being one day at Church with
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> he saw a great deal of Money on the Altar,
which was given for the Souls in <HI>Purgatory.</HI> He drew near,
and took it up in his hand, saying, <HI>My Love will last for ever,
my Pains will be likewise</HI> Eternal, <HI>those of the Souls in</HI> Purgatory
<HI>will have an end; alas, mine will never end: This hope comforts
them; as for me, I am without hope and comfort, so that these
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
Charities are more due to me, than they.</HI> However, he took
nothing away, only speaking these words as an occasion to
bring in his Passion before this beautiful Queen, who was
there present: For in effect, his was so violent for her, that
there is some reason to think she was not wholly insensible of
it, if her rigid Virtue had not preserved her heart against the
Count's Merit. He was young, well shaped, handsome, brave,
magnificent, gallant and witty; every Body knows how he ap∣peared
to his Misfortune in a <HI>Carosel</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> with a Suit em∣broidered
with pieces of new Money called <HI>Realles,</HI> and which
he bore for a Device;
<Q>MIS AMORES SON REALES.</Q>
making an allusion to the word <HI>Realles,</HI> which is to say <HI>Royal,</HI>
with the Passion he had for the Queen. This is siner in <HI>Spanish,</HI>
and signifies in <HI>English, My Love is Royal.</HI></P>
<P>The Count Duke <HI>de Olivarez,</HI> the Kings Favourite, and the
secret Enemy to the <HI>Queen</HI> and the <HI>Count,</HI> made his Master
take notice of the boldness of the Subject, who dared even in
his Presence declare the Sentiments he had for the <HI>Queen;</HI> and
in this moment he perswaded the King to be revenged on him.
An Occasion was waited for which should make no noise. But
here's what hastned his Ruine; applying his Mind only to di∣vert
the <HI>Queen,</HI> he wrote a <HI>Comedy</HI> which every Body likes,
and the <HI>Queen,</HI> more than others, found therein such moving
and delicate stroaks in it, that she would act apart in it her self
on the <HI>Kings Birth-Day.</HI> It was the Amorous Count, who ma∣naged
and took care of the Festival, he ordered the Cloaths,
and provided Machines, which cost him above Thirty thou∣sand
Crowns. He had caused a great <HI>Cloud</HI> to be painted, un∣der
which the <HI>Queen</HI> was concealed in a Machine. He stood
very near it, and at a certain sign he gave a Man who was
faithful to him, he set fire to the linnen work of the Cloud.
The whole House valued at an hundred thousand Crowns, was
in a manner consumed; but he comforted himself, when ma∣king
his advantage of this favourable Opportunity, he took
his Soveraign in his Arms, carryed her into a little by-place,
and there stole from her some Favours; and that which is
much taken notice of in this Country, is, that he touched her
foot. A little Page who saw him, informed the Count Duke of
it, he did not doubt but when he saw the fire, but this was an
effect of the Count's Passion. He made such an exact En∣quiry,
that he laid before the King certain Proofs of it; and
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
his Proofs so greatly enraged the King, that 'tis pretended he
caused him to be shot with a Pistol one night, as he was in his
Coach with Don <HI>Lewis de Haro.</HI></P>
<P>Here's a very Tragical end, <HI>said I to her, interrupting her;</HI> but
whilst, <HI>said she,</HI> I am speaking to you of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, I
cannot but I must tell you, that he was vehemently in love with
the Dutchess <HI>Dalberkerke.</HI> He could never meet with a favou∣rable
opportunity of Entertaining her. The Duke her Husband
kept strict guard over her, and the more Obstacles the King
met with, the more his Desires increased; but when Night
came, and when he was at play, he feign'd to call to mind he
had a Letter to write of the greatest Consequence. He called
the Duke <HI>Dalburkerke,</HI> who was in his Chamber, and desired
him to take his place, and continue his Game. He immediately
hereupon entred into his Closet, disguised himself, and went down
by a back Stairs, and came to the young Dutchess with the Count
Duke his Favourite.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>Dalburkerke,</HI> whose mind ran on his Domestick
Interests more then on his Game, easily believed his Master
would not have committed it to him, without some secret De∣sign.
He began then to complain of an horrid Collick, and uttering
Cries and making Faces enough to fright one, he gave the Cards
to another, and without any stop ran home. The King had only
just arrived there without any Train, he was then in the Court,
and seeing the Duke come he hid himself; but there is nothing so
clear sighted as a Jealous Husband. He perceived the King, and
being not willing to have Lights brought that he might not be ob∣liged
to acknowledge him, he made up to him with a great Cane
which he commonly walked with: <HI>Ha! Ha! Villain,</HI> said he
to him, <HI>thou comest to rob my House;</HI> and without more words
he laid on him with all his strength. The Count Duke was no
more spared, who fearing least worse might happen, cried, out
several times, <HI>'Twas the King,</HI> to stop the Duke's Fury: but this
was so far from effecting it, that he redoubled his blows both
on the Prince and his Minister, crying in his turn, <HI>That this was
a stroak of the greatest Insolence, to make use of his Majesty's Name
and his Favourites in such an occasion, that he could find in his heart
to (end them to the Palace, because he well knew the King would
cause them to be hanged.</HI> In all this Fray the King said not a
word, and at length got away half mad, in having received so
many blows, and not one favour from his Mistress.</P>
<P>This produced no ill Consequences to the Duke <HI>Dalburkerke,</HI>
but on the contrary, the King being cured of his Love to the
Dutchess made a Jest of it some time after. I know not whe∣ther
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
I do not abuse your patience by the length of this Con∣versation,
<HI>added the Countess</HI> de Lemos, and I fall insensible in∣to
the defect of persons of my Age, who forget themselves
when they tell of things done in their time. I saw she was for
retiring, and having again thankt her for the honour she had
done me, I took my leave of her, and returned to my Inn.</P>
<P>The Weather was so foul, that we with great difficulty set
out, but being resolved on it, we marcht as long as the day
lasted, falling down and getting up as well as we could. We
could hardly see four Paces before us, the Storm was so great,
that it blew off several Stones off the Rocks, which fell into our
way, and hurt one of our Company; he had been killed, had
he not stept on one side. In fine, after having made about
eight Leagues, according to our reckoning, we were much a∣stonisht
to find our selves at the Gates of <HI>Lerma,</HI> without ha∣ving
advanced or gone back. We had still turn'd about the
Town, without perceiving it, as it were by Enchantment,
sometimes farther, sometimes nearer; and we were all of us
not a little out of humour at having taken so much pains to so
little purpose.</P>
<P>The Hostess transported at the sight of us, she who could
have been glad with all her heart we should thus Travel as long
as we lived, to return to lye at her House every night, tarried
for me at the top of her little Stair-case. She told me she was
very sorry she could not let me have my Room again, but would
give me another commodious enough, and that mine was ta∣ken
up by a <HI>Seignora,</HI> the greatest in <HI>Spain. Don Fernand</HI> askt
her name, she told him, she was called Don <HI>Eleonora</HI> of <HI>Toledo;</HI>
he as soon informed me she was his near Kinswoman. He could
not comprehend by what chance she should come there.</P>
<P>To be satisfied in the matter, he sent his Gentlemen to make
her a Compliment, and to know whether his visit would not
be troublesome. She sent word, she had a great Satisfaction
at this happy Meeting, and that he would do her a great deal
of honour. He went up immediately to her Chamber, and
was informed by her of several particulars which related to
him. He came afterwards to me, and told me very civilly,
that were not Donna <HI>Eleonora</HI> excessive weary and indisposed,
she would have given me the first Visit. I in short, desired
him to conduct me to her Chamber, where she received me in a
most obliging manner; and I observed in the first moment of
our Conversation, that she had a great deal of Wit and Polite∣ness.
I found her very neat and handsome, her Eyes were
lively and so glistring, that one could not without pain endure
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>
their brightness. <HI>Don Fernand</HI> told her, who I was, and that
I went to see one of my near Relations at <HI>Madrid.</HI> He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame
was not unknown to her, no more than her Person, she told me
'twas not long since the King had made her <HI>Titularia</HI> and <HI>Mar∣chioness
of Castille.</HI> I should be greatly obliged to you, Madam,
<HI>said I to her, interrupting her,</HI> if you would be pleased to give
me some Account of this Title; she having mentioned it in her
Letters, without explaining to me what it means, no more
than that of <HI>Grandee,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I shall take a pleasure to inform you of what I know, <HI>replied</HI>
Donna <HI>Eleonora,</HI> and I have always heard, that in the time of
the first <HI>Kings, Doviedo, de Galicia</HI> and <HI>Austuria,</HI> they were elected
by the <HI>Prelates</HI> of the Kingdom, and by the <HI>Ricos-homes.</HI> These
Lords having not yet obtain'd the Titles of <HI>Dukes, Marquisses</HI>
and <HI>Counts,</HI> which distinguish them from <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> they
were called <HI>Ricos-homes,</HI> which were as the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>
now. The <HI>Ricos-homes,</HI> stood covered before the <HI>King,</HI> en∣tred
among the States, and had their <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>Passive</HI> voice.
And the <HI>Titulado's</HI> at present, are the same which were then
called <HI>Ricos-homes;</HI> but their Priviledges are not so large, and
most of these Honours, as I shall tell you, have been reserv'd
to the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> The <HI>Titulado's</HI> may have a Canopy
or Cloth of State in their Chamber, a Coach in <HI>Madrid</HI> with
four Horses, with <HI>los tiros largos,</HI> which are long Traces of Silk
which fasten the last Horses to the foremost. When there
are <HI>Bull-Feasts,</HI> they have Balconies in the great place, where
their Wives are regaled with Baskets full of Sweetmeats,
Gloves, Ribbons, Fans, Silk-hose, and this at the King or
Towns charge, which gives the Feast. They have their Seat
set out in their Ceremonies, and when the King makes a <HI>Titu∣lado,</HI>
Marquess of <HI>Castille, Arragon,</HI> or <HI>Grenada,</HI> he enters into
the States of this <HI>Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Grandees,</HI> there are three different Ranks of them;
and the manner in which the King speaks to them in making
them, distinguishes them. The one are those whom he bids
be <HI>covered,</HI> without adding any thing thereto; their Grandure
is only fixt to their Person, and is not conserved to their Family.</P>
<P>The others, whom the <HI>King</HI> qualifies with the Title of one
of their Lands, as for Example, <HI>Duke</HI> or <HI>Marquess</HI> of such a
place, <HI>Cover your self, for you, and for yours,</HI> are <HI>Grandees</HI> in a
more advantagious manner than the first, because their Gran∣dure
being fixt to their estates, passes to their eldest Son, and
if they have none, to their Daughter or Heir.</P>
<P>The last are not covered till after they have spoken to the
<PB N="92" REF="95"/>
King; and the difference between these is observed in saying,
<HI>They are Grandees for Life, or in their Race.</HI> It is farther to be
observed, That there are some whom the King makes be co∣vered
before they speak to him, in saying to them <HI>Cubridos;</HI> and
they speak, and hear the King speak, ever covered. Others
who are only covered after they have spoke to him, and he
has answered them. And the third, who are only covered
when they have withdrawn themselves from the King towards
the Wall, but when they be altogether in publick Offices, or at
Chappel, there is no difference between them they sit down and
are covered before him. And when he writes to them, he treats
them as if they were <HI>Princes,</HI> they have the Titles of <HI>Excellency</HI>
given them. When their Wives go to the Queen, she receives
them standing, and instead of sitting on the Foot cloth, they
have Cushions brought them to sit on.</P>
<P>Here's Madam, <HI>continued Donna Eleonora,</HI> what you desired to
know; after due thanks for her Civility, the hour of withdraw∣ing
being come, I took my leave of her, entreating her to con∣tinue
me in her Friendship.</P>
<P>I arose before day, because we had a great Journey to
make to lye at <HI>Arando de Duero.</HI> The Weather growing milder,
it became very misty, which at length turned to Rain; and
in arriving at Night, our Host told us we were very welcome
to him, but we must make a shift without Bread. This is, <HI>re∣plied
I,</HI> a thing one cannot easily be without. And in effect,
this News put me a little out of humour. I enquired how
hapned this Scarcity; 'twas answered me, The <HI>Alcaid Major</HI> of
the Town (who is he that orders every thing) and who is both
<HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI> had sent for all the Bread and Meal which
was at the Bakers, and had brought it into his House to make
an equal Distribution of it, proportionable to the Necessities
of each particular Person, and that which had occasioned this,
was that the River of <HI>Duero,</HI> which passes about the Town, was
frozen, and the Rivers of <HI>Leon, Suegra, Burgos, Tormes</HI> and <HI>Sa∣lamanca,</HI>
which threw and lost themselves therein, had like∣wise
ceased their Courses, so that no Mills could grind, which
made them apprehend a Famine: This obliged us to address our
selves to him for to have the Bread we needed: <HI>Don Fernand</HI>
sent him one of his Gentlemen in the Name of us all, and imme∣diately
we had so much Bread sent us, that we gave part to
our Host and his Family, who much wanted it.</P>
<P>Scarce were we at Table, when one of my Servants brought
into my Chamber several Packets of Letters, which they had
found on the Stairs in the Inn. He that carried them having
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
drank more than he needed, had fallen there asleep, by which
means all his Letters lay exposed to the Curiosity of all that past
by. Here is in this Country a very ill order touching Com∣merce,
and when the <HI>French</HI> Currier arrives at St. <HI>Sebastian,</HI> all
the Letters he brings are delivered to others who are good Foot∣men,
and ease one another. They put these Packets into a
Sack, tied with rotten Cords to their shoulders, by which
means it oft happens, that the secrets of your Heart and Fami∣ly
are open to the first curious Body who makes drunk this Foot
post; and this is what hapned in this Occasion; for Don <HI>Fre∣deric
de Cardonne</HI> having lookt on the Superscriptions of several
Letters, he at last met with one from a Lady in whom he was
apparently interessed, at least I so judged from the emotion of
his Countenance, and earnestness with which he opened the
Packet. He read the Letter, and was willing to shew it me,
without telling me from whom it came, nor for whom it was;
but he promised to inform me further about it at <HI>Madrid,</HI> fin∣ding
it well writ, it came into my mind that you would be
perhaps glad to see the style of a <HI>Spanish Lady,</HI> when she writes
to what she loves. I prayed the <HI>Knight</HI> to let me take a Copy
of it; but 'tis certain the Translation takes away much of the
beauty of the Original. Here it is.</P>
<P>EVery thing contributes to afflict me in the unfortunate Ambassy
you have undertaken, not to mention that distance is the bane
of the strongest Friendship. I cannot flatter my self, that a Rup∣ture
between the Sovereigns, may abridge the time of your ab∣sence,
and restore me a Good without which I can no longer live.
Of all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> he to whom you are sent, is the
most at Vnion with us. I can foresee no War with him, and this
Scourge with which Heaven punishes the guilty, would be to me a
thousand times more welcome than Peace: Yes, I would be glad to
bear alone all the Disasters of it, to see my Lands wasted, my Houses
burnt, to lose my Estate and my Liberty, provided we could be to∣gether,
and that without you share in my Disgraces, I could enjoy
the pleasure of seeing you; you may judge by these Dispositions of
the Condition I am in, when I think that you are really going away,
that <HI>I</HI> remain at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that I dare not follow you, that my
Duty stifles immediately the Projects I might make to comfort my
self, and that I lose you, in fine, in a time wherein I have most rea∣son
to be perswaded of yours, and wherein I feel more the Marks you
gave me of it; I should conceal from you my Grief, and add <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore
to yours; but how can I weep and weep without you. Alas, Alas <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I shall be soon forced to weep alone, are you not afraid so lively an
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
Affliction will kill me, and can you not feign your self sick, that
you may not leave me, think of all the Advantages which are in∣cluded
in this Proposition; but I am a Fool to make it you, you
will prefer the King's O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ders before mine, and 'twould bring me into
new Vexations to put you on such a proof. Adieu, I ask you nothing,
because I have too much to ask you; I was never so afflicted.</P>
<P>As I ended the Translating of this Letter which I send you, the
<HI>Alcade</HI>'s Son came to see me; he was a young man who had a
good Opinion of himself, and who was a true <HI>Guap.</HI> Let not
this word offend you (<HI>dear Cosen</HI>) <HI>Guap</HI> is the same in <HI>Spanish,</HI>
as a brave Gallant and Spark is with us; his Hair was parted
on the Crown of his Head, and tied behind with a blue Ribond
about four singers breadth, and about two yards long, which
hung down at its full length; his Breeches were of black Velvet,
buttoned down on each Knee with five or six Buttons, he had
a Vest on so short, that it scarce reacht below his Pockets, a
Scollopt Doublet with hanging sleeves about four fingers breadth,
made of white embroidered Sattin. His Cloak was of black
Bays, and he being a Spark had wrapt it round his Arm,
because this is more gallant, with a very light Buckler in his
hand, and which has standing out in the midst of a steel Pike;
they carried it with them when they walk in the Night on any
Occasion, he held in the other hand a Sword longer than an
Half-Pike, and the Iron for its Guard was enough to make a
Breast and Back-plate. These Swords being so long, that they
cannot be drawn out, unless a Man has the Arms of a Giant:
the Sheaf therefore flies open in laying the finger on a little
Spring. He had likewise a Dagger, whose Blade was very nar∣row,
it was fastned to his Belt on his back; he had such a strait
Collar, that he could neither stoop nor turn about his Head.
Nothing can be more ridiculous than what they wear about
their Necks, for it is neither a Ruff nor a Band, nor a Cravat.
His Hat was a prodigious size, with a great Band twisted about
it, bigger then a mourning one. His Shoo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s were of as fine
Leather as that whereof Gloves are made, and all slasht and
cut, notwithstanding the cold, and so exactly close to his Feet,
that they seemed rather pasted on, and having no Heels. He
made me in entring a Reverence after the <HI>Spanish</HI> fashion, his
two Leggs cross one another and lowly stooping as Women
do when they Salute one another, he was strongly perfumed,
and they are all so; his Visit was not long; he was very brisk,
he forgat not to tell me he went oft to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that
there were no Courses of Bulls, wherein he ventured not his
life. But as the little Care which was taken of Letters, run in
<PB N="95" REF="98"/>
my mind, and troubled me; I told him of the <HI>Courrier</HI> whom
my People had found asleep on the Stairs. He answered me,
this hapned from the neglect of the great Post-master, or to
speak better, in that he would gain too much, and that if the
King knew of it, he would not suffer it. This Name of <HI>Great
Post-master</HI> made me enquire of him, whether any one rode
Post in <HI>Spain.</HI> He told me, yes; provided they had the
King's leave, or of the Great Master, who is always a Person
of a distinct Birth; and that unless you have an Order well
signed, and in good form, you can have no Horses. But, <HI>said
I to him,</HI> a Man who has fought a Duel, or has other Reasons
to hasten away, What does he? Nothing, Madam, <HI>said he to
me,</HI> if he has good Horses he makes use of them, and if he has
not, he is perplext enough, but when one will go Post, and
parts not directly from <HI>Madrid,</HI> it is sufficient to take a Billet
from the <HI>Alcade,</HI> which is to say, Governour of the Towns
where you pass. My Curiosity being satisfied on this Subject,
the gallant <HI>Spaniard</HI> withdrew, and we supt altogether, as we
were wont.</P>
<P>I had been some time in Bed and asleep, when I was awake∣ned
by the ringing of Bells, and by a confused Noise of dread∣ful
Voices. I knew not as yet what was the Cause, when Don
<HI>Fernand de Toledo,</HI> and Don <HI>Frederic de Cardonne,</HI> without
knocking at my Door, burst it open, and calling out to me,
as loud as they could to make me hear (for they had Light)
came both of them to my Bed, and throwing my Gown upon
me, they carried me away, with my Daughter, as quick as
they could to the top of the House. It is impossible to repre∣sent
to you my astonishment and fear, I askt them at length,
what was the matter? They told me the Thaw was come
down all of a sudden, with such a great violence, that the Bi∣vers
being swelled by the Torrents which fell from all sides of
the Mountains, with which the Town is surrounded, had fallen
on it, and overflowed it, that at the instant when they came
to take me, the Water had already got to my Chamber, and
that all was in horrid Confusion, they needed say no more, for
I heard dreadful Cries and Shrieks, and the Water shook the
whole House. I was never so seized with Fear in all my life;
I affectionately regretted my dear Country! <HI>Alas!</HI> said I, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>have travelled a long way to come to drown my self on the Fourth
Story of an Inn in</HI> Aranda. All Raillery apart, I thought seri∣ously
my last hour was come, and I was so troubled, that I was
twenty times thinking to entreat these Gentlemen to hear me
in Confession. I believe that in the sequel they would have
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
more laught at it than I. We were till Day in continual A∣larms;
but the <HI>Alcade,</HI> and the Inhabitants of the Town so
speedily and effectually bestirred themselves in turning aside the
Torrents, and making the Water<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s pass, that we were only
affrighted, two of our Mules were drowned, my Litters and
Cloaths were so soakt in Water, that to dry them, we were
sorced to tarry one whole Day; and this was no easie matter,
for there are no Chimneys in the Inns, they heated the Oven,
and put my Cloaths in it. I can assure you, I have not gained
any thing in this unhappy Inundation, I lay down after this,
or to speak better. I bathed my self, my Bed being as wet as
any thing else.</P>
<P>My fellow Travellers thought fit to let me rest a little; I
have employed one part of my leisure time in writing to you.
Adieu dear Cosen, it is time to finish: I am ever, more yours,
than any Bodies in the World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Exactness I observe in giving you an Account of things
which I judge worthy of your Curiosity, puts me often
times on Enquiries into several Particulars which I should have
otherwise omitted, had you not perswaded me that you are a
great lover of Novelties, and that you love to Travel without
going out of your Closets.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Aranda</HI> in a time of Thaw, which as it ren∣dred
the Air warmer, so it made the ways more troublesome.
We came a while after to the Mountain <HI>de Samoziorra,</HI> which
parts the <HI>Old Castille</HI> from the New, and we traverst it not
without difficulty, as well for its heighth, as the quantity of
Snow, with which the bottoms were filled, and into which
we sometimes fell as from Precipices, believing the way even.
They call this Pass the <HI>Puerto,</HI> which name methinks should be
only given to a part, where one Embarks on the Sea, or a
River, but it is thus, they call the Passage from one Kingdom
to another, and you make your way to your cost, for the <HI>Kings
Officers</HI> wait for Travellers in the Road, and let them not go till
they have paid what they require.</P>
<P>In arriving at <HI>Buitrago,</HI> we were as wet as the night of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nundation at <HI>Aranda,</HI> and tho' I kept my Litter, I felt no
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
less the Incommodiousness of the Weather, than if I had been
on foot or Horseback, because the Litters are so ill closed and
made in this Country, that when the Mules pass through any
Water, they throw up with their Feet part of the Water into
the Litter, which there remains. So that I was forced in ar∣riving,
to change my Linnen and Cloaths. Afterwards Don
<HI>Fernand,</HI> the three Knights, my Daughter, and my Women,
went with me to the Castle I had been so often told of.</P>
<P>It appeared to me as regularly built as that of <HI>Lerma,</HI> not so
large, but every whit as pleasant: The Apartments are better
contrived, and the Furniture is richer and very singular as
well for its Antiquity as Magnificence. This Castle, as well
as that of <HI>Lerma,</HI> belongs to Don <HI>Rodrigo de Silva de Mendosa,</HI>
Duke <HI>de Pastrana</HI> and <HI>de L'infantada.</HI> His Mothers Name is
Donna <HI>Katherina de Mendosa &amp; Sandoval,</HI> Heiress of the Dutchy's
of <HI>Infantada</HI> and <HI>Lerma.</HI> It descends from Father to Son of
<HI>Ruy Gomes de Silva,</HI> who was made Duke of <HI>Pastrana,</HI> and
Prince of <HI>Eboly</HI> by King <HI>Philip</HI> the Second. This Princess
<HI>de Eboly,</HI> who has been so much talkt of for her Beauty, was
his Wife, and the King was passionately in love with her:
They shewed me her Picture, she is represented at her whole
length, sitting under a Tent fastned to some Boughs of Trees,
she seems as if she were rising, for she has only a fine Linnen∣cloth
on her, which lets one part of her body be seen. If she
were as handsome as her Picture makes her, and if her Features
were so regular, she must be judged the most charming Wo∣man
in the World; her Eyes are so lively and full of Spirit,
that it seems as if she was about speaking to you; her Neck,
Arms, Feet, and Leggs are naked; her Hair falls down on her
Breasts, and little Cupids which appear every where about her,
press on one another to serve her, some had her Slippers,
others are ready to strew flowers on her, and some hold her
looking Glass. Others are seen farther off, who are sharpning
their Arrows, whilst others fill their Quivers with them, and
bend their Bow: A Fawn looks on her through Boughs, she
sees him and shews him to a little Cupid, who is leaning on her
Knees, and weeps as if she was afraid of it, at which she seems
to smile. I remained a great while looking on this Picture
with the greatest pleasure, but I was made to pass into a Gal∣lery,
where I saw her again. She was painted in a large Piece
attending Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> the Second King
of <HI>France,</HI> whom <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Spain</HI> espoused,
instead of giving her to Don <HI>Carlos</HI> his Son, to whom she had
been promised. The Queen made her Entrance on Horseback,
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
as 'tis the Custom, and I found the Princess <HI>Eboly</HI> less shining
near her than she appeared to me when alone. You may hereby
judge of the Charms of this young Queen, she had a blue Sattin
Gown, but as to the rest, just as I represented to you the Coun∣tess
of <HI>Lemos.</HI> The King stood in a Balcony to see her pass by.
He had a black Suit with a Collar of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> His Hair
reddish and gray, long visage, pale, old, wrinkled and ugly.
The Insant <HI>Don Carlos</HI> accompanied the <HI>Queen,</HI> he was very
white, a fine head, his Hair of a light yellow, his Eyes blue,
and he lookt on the Queen with so moving an Air, that it ap∣peared
the Painter knew the Secret of his heart, and would ex∣press
it: His Habit was white, embroidered with precious
Stones; he was in his Doublet, with his Hat buttoned upon
one side, and covered with white Feathers. I saw in the same
Gallery another piece which much affected me, which was the
Prince <HI>Don Carlos</HI> dying, he was sitting in a Chair, leaning on
his Arm on a Table before him, holding a Pen in his Hand, as
if he would have wrote something; there was a Vessel by him,
wherein appeared a sort of black Liquor, which apparently was
designed for Poyson. A little further you see the Bath prepa∣ring
for him, where his Veins were to be opened; the Pain∣ter
had perfectly well represented the Confusion of so sad an
Occasion, and having read this History, and being much af∣fected
with it, methoughts I saw him really dying. I was told these
Pieces was of inestimable value. I was afterwards conducted
into a Chamber, whose Furniture had belonged to the Arch-Dutchess
<HI>Marguerita</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> Governess of the Low Coun∣tries,
and it is pretended she had workt it her self, there is a
neatly wrought Bed of Flowers, Woods, Animals, and Fea∣thers
of all Colours, the hangings are the same, and the diffe∣rent
Colours therein do make a very agreeable shew. And this
is what I sound most remarkable in the Castle of <HI>Buitrago,</HI> and
it growing late we left it.</P>
<P>It was several days since I had the pleasure of seeing the play∣ing
at <HI>Hombre,</HI> I therefore caused the Cards to be brought.
Don <HI>Fernand</HI> with two of the Knights, began the Game, and
I intrested my self, as I wont, and Don <HI>Estreve de Carvajal</HI>
did the like; so that after we had seen them play some time,
I demanded of him to whom of the three Knights was the
<HI>Commandership,</HI> whence they came when I met them. He an∣swered
me, It did not belong to any one of them, that he had
been to see one of their common Friends on a vexatious Ac∣cident
which had hapned to him in Hunting. Falling on the
Subject of <HI>Commanderships,</HI> I intreated him to inform me whe∣ther
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
the Orders of St. <HI>James, Calatrava,</HI> and <HI>Alcantara</HI> were
ancient. He answered me, 'Twas above 500 years they had
subsisted, that heretofore the Order of <HI>Calatrava</HI> was called
the <HI>Gallant,</HI> that of St. <HI>James,</HI> the <HI>Rich,</HI> and that of <HI>Alcantara</HI>
the <HI>Noble.</HI> That which made them be called thus, was that or∣dinarily
there entred only young <HI>Cavaliers</HI> into <HI>Calatrava;</HI>
that St. <HI>James</HI>'s was richer than the two others, and that to
be received a Knight of <HI>Alcantara,</HI> one must make his Proofs
of our Races, whereas to enter into the others, there needed
only two. In the first times, when these Orders were establisht,
the Knights made Vows, lived most regularly in Community,
and wore Arms only to Combat the <HI>Moors,</HI> but afterward the
greatest Lords of the Kingdom entred into it, who obtained
the liberty to marry, under this Condition, that they should be
obliged to demand an express Dispensation, from the Holy
See, one must have the King's Letter, make his proofs of No∣bility,
and likewise prove he comes of <HI>old Christians,</HI> which is
to say, there have entred no <HI>Jews</HI> nor <HI>Moors</HI> into his Fathers
and Mothers Family. Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the Eighth gave 1489. to
King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and his Successors, the disposal of all the Com∣manderships
of these three Orders, which are called <HI>Military.</HI>
The King of <HI>Spain</HI> disposes of them in effect under the Title of
<HI>Perpetual Administrator;</HI> and he enjoys three great <HI>Masterships,</HI>
which brings him in above four thousand Crowns a Year.
When he holds a Chapter, as Great Master of the Order, or
any other assembly, the Knights have the Priviledge to sit and
be covered in his Presence. Don <HI>Esteve</HI> added, That the Order
of the <HI>Calatrava</HI> had 34 Commanderships, and 8 Priories, va∣lued
at 120 thousand Ducats a year; that <HI>Alcantara</HI> had 33
<HI>Commanderships, 4 Alcaydies,</HI> and 4 <HI>Priories</HI> which yielded 80
thousand <HI>Ducats,</HI> and that the 87 <HI>Commanderships</HI> of St. <HI>James,</HI>
as well in <HI>Castille,</HI> as in the Kingdom of <HI>Leon,</HI> were valued at
272000 Ducats. You may hereby judge, Madam, <HI>continued he,</HI>
that there are some helps for the poor Gentlemen of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>I agree, <HI>said I to him,</HI> that this would be very advantageous
for them, were they the only Persons admitted into these
three Orders. But I think you now told me, that the greatest
Lords possess the best <HI>Commanderships.</HI> This is by a general
Rule, <HI>said he,</HI> that <HI>those who have much will have more,</HI> and
there's the greatest Justice others should have a share; and the
eldest of great quality might have wherewith to satisfie them
in obtaining the Order of the <HI>Fleece,</HI> which extreamly distin∣guishes
those whom the King honours with it. However, this
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
being a Favour accompanied with no Revenue, and being not
easily obtained, few People seek it, and you see ordinarily none
but <HI>Princes</HI> have it. If you know who instituted this Order of
the <HI>Fleece, said I to him,</HI> you will oblige me in informing me.
It is pretended, <HI>replied he,</HI> that in the time when the <HI>Moors</HI> pos∣sest
the best and greatest part of <HI>Spain,</HI> a pious <HI>Peasant,</HI> pray∣ing
one day earnestly to <HI>God</HI> to deliver the Kingdom from these
<HI>Infidels,</HI> perceived an <HI>Angel</HI> coming down from Heaven who gave
him a <HI>Fleece of Gold,</HI> and commanding him to make use of it to
gather Troops, because at this sight he would not be refused to
be followed for the fighting the Enemy. This holy man obey'd,
and several Gentlemen took up Arms in effect on what he told
them.</P>
<P>The Success of this Enterprize answered the hope conceived
of it. So that <HI>Philip the Good,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> instituted the
Order of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> in the honour of <HI>God,</HI> of the <HI>Virgin,</HI>
and St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> in the year 1429. and the Day of his Marriage
with <HI>Isabella</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> was chosen for
this Ceremony. It was made at <HI>Bruges,</HI> it ordained, that the
Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> should be perpetual Chief of the Order, be∣cause
St. <HI>Andrew</HI> is Patron of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> Those who have it are
called <HI>Cav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liero's del Tuzon,</HI> which is to say, <HI>Knights of the Fleece,</HI>
and one may hence remark, that there is a difference in relati∣on
to this Order, saying, when one speaks of the others, That
such a one is Knight of the order of St. <HI>James,</HI> of the Order of
<HI>Calatrava.</HI></P>
<P>In the time when we were thus talking, we heard a noise,
as of a Coach and Attendants that stopt, not long after, Don <HI>Fre∣deric
de Cardone's Valet de Chambre</HI> entred into my Chamber, to
tell his Master, that the Arch-bishop of <HI>Burgos</HI> was arrived.</P>
<P>This is an happy Encounter for me, <HI>said he,</HI> for I parted ex∣presly
from <HI>Madrid</HI> to see him, and having not found him at <HI>Bur∣gos.</HI>
I was not a little troubled at it.</P>
<P>Fortune is always on your side, <HI>said Don</HI> Sancho <HI>smiling to him,</HI>
but not to retard the pleasure of seeing this Illustrious Kinsman,
we will leave off our Game. Don <HI>Fernand</HI> and Don <HI>Sancho</HI> arose.
Undoubtedly, <HI>says Don</HI> Esteve, Don <HI>Frederic</HI> will not be of our
Company this Night. I am of another mind, <HI>replied</HI> Don Fer∣nand,
the Archbishop is one of the most obliging Persons in the
World, assoon as ever he knows here's a <HI>French</HI> Lady, he will
give her a Visit. He will do me a great deal of honour, <HI>answered
I,</HI> but yet I shall be a little perplext, for we must sup and go to
rest betimes. I had scarce ended these words, when Don <HI>Frede∣ric</HI>
returned again.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="104"/>
As soon as ever the Archbishop knew there was a strange
Lady at <HI>Buytrago, said he to me,</HI> he no more minded me; and
if you please, Madam, he will come and offer you whatever de∣pends
on him in this Country.</P>
<P>I answered this Civility as I ought; and Don <HI>Frederic</HI> being
returned to him, conducted him a while after into my Chamber.
I found him extraordinary civil, he spake little, and observed
the <HI>gravity</HI> befitting his Character, and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation. He
much bewailed my making so long a Journey in so rigorous a
Season, entreating me <HI>to lay my Commands on him in something
wherein he might obey me.</HI> This is the usual Compliment in this
Country, he had a long Cassock over his other Cloaths of pur∣ple
Velvet, with high ruffled Sleeves, which reacht to his very
Ears, and a pair of Spectacles on his Nose.</P>
<P>He sent for a little Monkey, which he would needs give my
Daughter, and though I was troubled at it, I could not resist
his instances, and the Desires my Daughter had of accepting
it. Every time the Archbishop took Tobacco, which he often
did, this little Ape reacht out his Paw to him, and he put
some on it, which he made as if he would take. This Prelate
told me the King of <HI>Spain</HI> expected with extream impatience
the Answer of the Marquess <HI>de Los-Balbares,</HI> on the Orders he
had given him on the Demand of <HI>Madamoiselle</HI> from the <HI>French</HI>
King. If his most Catholick Majesty's Greatness be considered,
<HI>continued he,</HI> this Marriage must needs be esteemed very ho∣nourable,
for when the Sun goes down in one part of his Do∣minions,
it rises again in another. And this Monarch enjoys
not alone his Grandure, he has the Pleasure of sharing it to his
Subjects, he is in a Condition to recompence them, to make
them happy, to put them into high places, where their whole
Ambition is satisfied, wherein they receive the same Honour as
<HI>Soveraigns,</HI> and this is not what a <HI>King</HI> ought to wish, to be in
a Capacity to recompence magnificently the Services which are
rendred him, and force even an unthankful Person to become
grateful. It is a surprizing thing, the number of Employs for
Men of the Sword and the Gown, which his Majesty every day
bestows.</P>
<P>Several Persons have spoken to me of this, as you do, my
Lord, <HI>said I to him,</HI> but I hope to be perfectly instructed in it
at <HI>Madrid.</HI> I am able to inform you, at least in part of what
you would know, <HI>replied he,</HI> some Reasons have obliged me to
take a little Abstract, and which I think I have about me, he
immediately delivered it to me, and having kept the Copy of
it, and it appearing curious to me, I shall therefore hear, dear
Cosen, translate it for you.</P>

pretends to the <HI>Primacy</HI> of all <HI>Spain,</HI> and disputes it with the

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>WE can easily perceive that we are not far from <HI>Madrid,</HI>
the Weather is fair notwithstanding the Season, and we
have no more need of Fire; but it seems very strange to us,
that in the Inns which are the nearest to this great Town, you
are worse used than in those which are an hundred Leagues
distant; you would think you came rather into <HI>Desarts,</HI> then
near a Town where resides so great a <HI>Monarch:</HI> and I can
assure you (dear Cosen) that in our whole Course, I have not
met with an House or Castle that has pleased me: I am much
amazed at it, for I thought that in this Country as in ours,
I should find fine Walks, and curious Seats, whereas you can
scarcely see any Trees, save some few which grow in spight of
the Soil: And at this time, when I am but Ten Leagues from
<HI>Madrid,</HI> my Chamber stands even with the Stable; it is an
Hole that needs a Light at Noon, but what kind of Light think
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
you better have none at all, for this is a Lamp which banishes all
Chearfulness by its glimmering light, and your Health by its stin∣king
scent: and go where you will, tho' to the Curate of the
Parish for a Candle, you will not find one, and I doubt much
whether there be any in his <HI>Church.</HI> Here every where a sad
Scene of <HI>Poverty</HI> presents it self to your sight; <HI>Don Fernand de
Toledo,</HI> who took notice of my Astonishment, assured me, I
should see very fine things at <HI>Madrid,</HI> but I could not forbear
telling him, I could not easily imagine it: It is true, the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
bear up under their Indigency with such an Air of Gravity
as would cheat one, the very <HI>Peasants</HI> telling their steps as they
walk, they are mighty inquisitive after News, as if their whole
Being depended thereon; I have had many of them come into
my Chamber without any Ceremony, and without Cloaths on
their backs, or Shooes on their Feet, entreating me to tell them
what I knew of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> after I had spoke to them,
they have examined what I have said, and argued on it among
themselves in such a manner, as shewed great sense, and a lively
apprehension: This Nation has ever had something extraordi∣nary
among them above others.</P>
<P>There came to see me among others one of the Townsmens
Wives, a good likely Woman, she carryed her Child in her
Arms, which was a dreadful lean one; he had above an hun∣dred
little hands like those of Joynted Babies hanging about his
Neck, and all sides of him. I askt his Mother what this meant?
She answered me, this was good against <HI>Evil Eyes.</HI> How, said
I to her, do these little hands hinder one from any Distemper of
the Eyes? Undoubtedly, replied she, but not as you mean;
for you must know if you please, there are People in this Coun∣try,
who have such a <HI>Poyson</HI> in their <HI>Eyes,</HI> that in looking sted∣fastly
on a Person, and especially on a young Child, they make
him pine away to death. I saw a Man who had an <HI>Evil-Eye,</HI> and
doing mischief when he lookt with this Eye, he was obliged to
cover it with a great Plaister: As to the other <HI>Eye,</HI> it had no
<HI>Malignity,</HI> yet it sometimes hapned that being with his Friends,
when he saw a great many <HI>Fowls</HI> together, he would say, choose
which of these you would have me kill. He was shewed one, he took
off his Plaister, lookt fixedly on the <HI>Fowl,</HI> and a while after she
turned several times round as giddy, and tell down dead. This Wo∣man
likewise would perswade me there are <HI>Magicians,</HI> who look∣ing
on any one with an <HI>Evil</HI> intention, strikes them with such a
La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guishment, as makes them become lean like <HI>Skeletons,</HI> and her
Child, she told me, has been struck in this manner, and the common
Remedy is these <HI>little hands.</HI> Shemoreovertold me, it is the custom,
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
when they see any one look attentively upon them, and the
Party has a look ill enough to fear she should give the <HI>Evil de
Ojos.</HI> (it is thus called, because it is done by the Eyes) to pre∣sent
her one of these Hands, or even her own shut, and to say
to her <HI>Toma la mano,</HI> which is to say, <HI>Take this hand;</HI> to which
the Party suspected must answer, <HI>Dios le benediga, God bless you,</HI>
which if she does not, she is judged to be ill intentioned, and
thereupon he or she may be denunciated to the inquisition, or
if you be the stronger, you may beat them till they say <HI>Dios le
Benediga.</HI></P>
<P>I do not assure you as a thing certain, that the Relation of
the <HI>Fowls</HI> is positively true; but this is certain, that they are
here strongly perswaded there are Persons who can do you hurt
by <HI>bare looking on you,</HI> and here are even <HI>Churches</HI> to which they
go in <HI>Pilgrimage</HI> to be cured of it. I askt this young Woman
if there appeared nothing extraordinary in those they call <HI>mis∣chievous
Eyes.</HI> She told me no, except that they are full of
such a shining Vivacity, that they seem to be all on fire, and
would make one think they will pierce you like a Dart. She
moreover told me, that of late the <HI>Inquisition</HI> had caused an Old
Woman to be seized on, who was accused to be a <HI>Witch,</HI> and she
believed 'twas she who had put her Child in that piteous condi∣tion
I saw it. I askt her what they would do to this Woman,
she told me if there were Proofs strong enough, she would be
infallibly burnt, or left in the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> and that the best
treatment she could choose would be to be delivered thence by
being whipt along the Streets. That these Witches are tied to
an Asses Tail, or that they are placed on these Beasts coifed
with a Paper <HI>Mitre</HI> painted with all colours, with Writings
which denoted the Crimes they have committed: That in this
fine Equipage they are led about the Town, where every one
has the liberty to strike them, or throw dirt at them. But, said
I to her, how know you their condition would be worse if they
remained still in Prison? O <HI>Madam,</HI> said she to me, I see you are
not yet informed what the <HI>Inquisition</HI> is, whatever can be said
of it, comes not near the Rigourous exercises therein. You are
seized on, and thrown into a Dungeon; you lye there two or
three Months, sometimes more, and sometimes less, without a
word being said to you; at the end of this time you are led
before the Judges, who with a terrible look ask you why you
are there? It is natural to answer, you know not. They
say no more to you, but send you back again to this dismal
Hole, wherein is every day suffered a thousand times more
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
trouble than Death it self, yet you are not suffered to dye there,
but remain many times a Year in this condition. At the end
of this time, you are brought again before the same Judges, or
before others, for they change, and go into several Countries,
these demand of you again, why you are detained? You An∣swer,
you have been Apprehended, but you know not for what.
You are sent again into your Dungeon without any more words.
In short, sometimes you pass over your whole Life there. And
demanding of her, if it were the Custom for one to accuse him∣self,
she answered, that as to some Persons, 'twas the best and
shortest way, but that the Judges held only this course with those
against whom they had no certain Proofs: for commonly, when a∣ny
one accuses a Person of Capital Crimes, the Accuser was
wont to remain in Prison with the Criminal, and this is the rea∣son
of their being a little more moderate. She related to me
the particular punishments, and the wholemanner of them, with
which I will not fill this Letter, nothing being more dreadful.
She moreover told me, she knew a <HI>Jew</HI> named <HI>Ishmael,</HI> who
was put into the Prison of the <HI>Inquisition</HI> of <HI>Seville,</HI> with his
Father, who was a <HI>Rabbin</HI> of their Law. It is four years since
they were there, when <HI>Ishmael,</HI> having made an hole, climbed
up to the top of a Tower, and making use of Ropes he had pro∣vided,
he slid down along the Wall with a great deal of danger,
but having got down, he reproached himself for having abando∣ned
his Father, and without considering the Risk he had ran af∣ter
more than one manner, seeing his Father and he were con∣demned,
and were to be led in a few days to <HI>Madrid</HI> with seve∣ral
others, to suffer there the greatest Torment, yet this hin∣dred
him not from determining himself, he generously climbed
up the Tower, descended into the Dungeon, drew thence his
Father, made him escape before him, and got away himself. I
found this Action very brave, and worthy to be set as an Exam∣ple
to <HI>Christians</HI> in an Age wherein the most indispensable Obli∣gations
are slighted. I continued entertaining my self with this
<HI>Spanish</HI> Woman, when <HI>Constance</HI> one of my Women, whom you
know, came to tell▪ me with earnestness, that she now saw
<HI>Monsieur Daucort,</HI> and that if I would, she would step out and
call him: This is a Rich Gentleman, whom I knew at <HI>Paris,</HI>
a civil Man, and of good Sense, and of comely Personage:
I knew that he had a Brother at <HI>Madrid</HI> belonging to <HI>Don Juan
of Austria.</HI> Having shewed I should be glad to speak with him,
<HI>Constance</HI> went out in quest of him, and brought him to me.
After the first Civilities, and informing my self of the News
<PB N="111" REF="114"/>
of my Kinswoman whom I believed he knew, I askt him of his
own Affairs, and whether he was content with his Journey. Ah,
<HI>Madam,</HI> speak to me no more of my Journey, cryed he, there
was never a more unfortunate, and had you come some days
sooner, you might have seen me hang'd. How said I to him,
what do you mean by this? I mean, said he to me, that I had
all the fear of it, and this is the most unpleasant Country in the
World for Strangers: But, Madam, if you are at leisure, and
would know more, I will relate to you my Adventure. It is
singular and will fully prove to you what I have told you. You
will do me a great deal of pleasure, said I to him, we are here
in a place where such a Relation will much divert us, he began
it in this manner.</P>
<P>Some Affairs wherein I was concerned, and the Desire of see∣ing
a Brother whom I had been away from some years, obliged
me, Madam, to undertake this Journey to <HI>Madrid:</HI> I was little
acquainted with the Customs of that place, I imagined one
might go to Women without difficulty, and that one might
play and eat with them; but I was astonished to learn, that e∣very
one of them is more retired in her House, than a <HI>Carthusian</HI>
in his Cell, and that there are Persons who have been mutually
in Love for two or three years, and yet had never spoke to one
another. Such singular Manners seemed ridiculous to me, I said
thereupon freely whatever came into my Head, but I treated
the matter more seriously, when I understood these Women
who were so closely confined, were the most amiable Women
in the World, that they had such a Delicacy, Vivacity, and
Manners, as are no where to be met with but among them, that
Love always appeared new, that no one would change a <HI>Spanish</HI>
Woman but for another. I was in the greatest despair at the
difficulties there were to get at them. One of my Friends,
named <HI>Belleville,</HI> who was my Companion in my Journey, and
who is a brisk Lad, was no less troubled on his side than I on
mine: My Brother, who feared lest some Vexatious Accident
should befal us, continually inculcated into us how Jealous Hus∣bands
are in this Country, great Murtherers, and no more va∣lued
the killing of a Man than a Fly. This did not agree very
well with two Men who were not as yet weary of living.</P>
<P>We went into all parts where we thought we might see La∣dies;
we saw some in effect, but this did not satisfie us, all the
bows and cringes we made them brought forth nothing, we each
of us returned home every Night very weary and disgusted at
our fruitless Circuits.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="115"/>
One Night, <HI>Belleville</HI> and I went upon Design to the <HI>Prado,</HI>
which is a Walk adorned with great Trees, and several Foun∣tains,
they throw their Water a great heighth, and in great
gushes it falls into Basins, from whence it runs (when they have
a mind) into the Courses to Water them, and so to make them
fresh and pleasant. It was the finest Weather this Evening
that one could wish. After we had light out of our Coach, and
sent it away, we began to walk softly, and having made a few
turns, we sat us down on the side of one of the Fountains, and
then began to make our usual Complaints. Dear <HI>Belleville,</HI> said
I to my Friend, shall we never be so happy to meet with one of
these Witty and Charming <HI>Spanish</HI> Women, so much boasted
of? Alas! says he, I desire it too much, but dare not hope it:
Hitherto we have met with nothing but such ugly Creatures, as
run after Folks to fright them, and who under their white
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are more Tauny and Loathsom than the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> such
as these, I swear to you, do not please me at all, and notwith∣standing
their sprightfulness, I cannot consent to enter into a
near conversation with them.</P>
<P>At the very instant these words were out of his Mouth, we
spyed coming out of a Door hard by, two Women; they had
left off their upper Garments, which were always very plain;
and when they opened their Manta's, the light of the Moon
made the glory of their Gold and Precious Stones appear. As
God's true, cries our <HI>Belleville,</HI> here's at least two Fairies. Nay,
said I let's be juster, and think them not other than two An∣gels.
When they came near us, we stood up, and made them
the lowest Bow that ever we did in our lives. They past by us
softly, and with those little Apish Tricks, which become the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> so well, they lookt at us, first with one Eye, and then
with to'ther. They went on a little; we were in pain what
to think, whether they would return back the same way, or
whether we should follow them, but while we were deliberating,
we perceived them to approach us, when they were near us,
they stood still, one of them began to speak, and askt us, if we
could speak <HI>Spanish.</HI> I see by your Habits, said she, that you
are strangers. But I pray tell me of what Country are you?
We told her we were <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and that we spoke <HI>Spanish</HI> ill
enough, but we had a great mind to learn to speak it well:
That to succeed therein, we were perswaded we must love a
<HI>Spanish</HI> Woman, and we heartily wished we might find one that
desired to be beloved. The matter is nice replyed the other
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which had not yet spoke, and I should be sorry for her
who engage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in such a Design, for I have heard that <HI>Frenchmen</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="116"/>
are not Faithful. Oh! Madam, says <HI>Belleville,</HI> this was some
body which had a mind to do us an ill turn, and put us out of
your good opinion, but it will be easie to wipe off this Asper∣sion.
Though I may soon give my Heart to a pretty Woman,
yet I am very sensible I cannot so easily call it back again.
What! says she that spoke to me before, dare you without fur∣ther
consideration, enter into such an Engagement at first sight?
I should not have quite so good an Opinion of you. Oh! Ma∣dam,
cries he, why should we loose precious Time? If it is
good to love at all, it is good to begin as soon as 'tis possible:
Hearts that are born to Love, languish and decay when they
are not exercised therein. Your Maxims are fine, replyed she,
but they seem dangerous, it is not only necessary to avoid fol∣lowing
of them, but even the hearing of them, and then in∣deed
they would have been gone, but we begged them with great
earnestness to tarry a few moments longer in the <HI>Prado.</HI> We
said all the pretty things to them both, which might oblige
them to discover themselves, and give us the satisfaction of
seeing them without their Vails. Our Conversation was very
brisk, and pleasant enough: they had abundance of Wit; and
as they knew how to manage all their Advantages, so without
affectation, they shewed us their Hands as they had an occasion
to mend the sitting of their Head-dresses, and they were whi∣ter
than the Snow. In spight of their seeming care to hide
themselves, yet we saw enough to observe their delicate Com∣plexion,
their brisk Eyes, and their Features very regular. You
may be sure we left them as late as we could, and that we con∣jured
them to make that Walk Happy sometimes with their Pre∣sence,
or else give us leave to wait on them at their House.
They agreed to nothing, and indeed, we were several times
after that at the <HI>Prado,</HI> and near that Fountain where we first
saw them, without being able to perceive them. Here's a deal
of time lost said we; what must we do to pass our Lives in this
great want of Employment, for we must renounce the thoughts
of Ladies, whose Access is so difficult? This was our Resoluti∣on,
but it held not long, for scarcely had we made it, but we
see come out of the same House the two <HI>Incognito's.</HI> We drew
near them, full of Respect, and our civil Carriage did not dis∣please
them. <HI>Belleville</HI> took the least by the hand, and I the
biggest. I endeavoured to perswade her with what impati∣ence
I expected her. I blamed her a little, at which she seemed
somewhat concerned; but taking more courage, I discoursed
to her of the thoughts she had inspired me with, and assured
<PB N="114" REF="117"/>
her that it was in her power to engage me for my whole Life.
She seemed extream careful not to give the least mark of Fa∣vour.
At length, amongst other things, she told me, that she
was Heiress to a great Estate, that her Name was <HI>Ines,</HI> that her
Father was a Knight of the Order of St. <HI>James,</HI> and was of
a considerable Quality, that she which was with her was called
<HI>Isabella,</HI> and that they were Cosens. All these particulars plea∣sed
me well, finding her a Person of Birth and therein my Vani∣ty
flattered. At parting, I begged her to give me leave to
come to see her. What you desire of me, says she, is the Cu∣stom
of your Country, and if I were there, I would please my
self to observe it, but we have different, and tho' I do not
conceive any Crime in what you ask me, yet I am obliged to
observe certain Rules of Decency, which by no means I will
transgress. I will contrive some other way to see you, and of
this, depend upon me, and do not take it ill, that I refuse you
a thing, which is not in my power to grant. Adieu, continu∣ed
she, I will think of what you desire, and will let you know
what I can do. I kist her Hand, and so withdrew extreamly
touched with her way, as well as at her Wit and her prudence.</P>
<P>As soon as I was alone with <HI>Belleville,</HI> I askt him if he was
pleas'd with the Conversation he had enjoy'd. He answered me,
that he had a great cause to be so, and that <HI>Isabella</HI> seemed to
be of a Nature sweet and amiable. You are very happy, said
I already to have found so much kindness. <HI>Ines</HI> gives me no
room to hope for any. She's of a gay Humour, and turns eve∣ry
thing I say to her into Jest, and I despair ever to make her
serious. Some days past, before we either saw or heard from
them: But one Morning as I was at Mass, an Old Woman, hid
under a Vail, comes up to me, and presents me a Billet in which
I read these words.</P>
<P>YOV appear too amiable to me to see you often, and I must needs
confess to you, that I a little mistrust my own Heart: If yours
is truly touched for me, Marriage must be thought on. I have told
you that I am Rich, and I have told you the truth: That part which
I offer you, is not inconvenient to take: But consider of it, and in
the Evening I shall be in the Banks of <HI>Mansanarez,</HI> where you may
let me know your thoughts.</P>
<P>As the place where I was did not allow me to write her an
Answer, so I contented my self to Note only on my Table-Book
these Lines:</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="118"/>
YOƲ have power to make me take what Journey you please. I
am very sensible, that I Love you too well to be at ease, and
that I have more cause to suspect my own Weakness, than you have
to be afraid of yours; however, I shall be at <HI>Mansanarez,</HI> being re∣solved
to obey you, whatever you Command me.</P>
<P>I gave my Table-Book to this honest Messenger, which had
the looks tho', to steal off the Plates and Clasps before she would
deliver it. I desired <HI>Belleville</HI> to let me go alone to this As∣signation.
He told me, he was very glad of it, for <HI>Isabella</HI> had
given him Notice, that she desired to speak with him alone at
the <HI>Florid.</HI> It was with impatience that we waited for the ap∣pointed
hour, and then we quitted each other, after having
wished our selves good Success in our Adventure.</P>
<P>As soon as I came to the River-side, I carefully lookt at all
the Coaches which past by, but it was hard for me to discover
any thing, because they had double Curtains drawn. But at last,
there came one and stopt, and I perceived some Woman in't,
who gave me a sign to approach. There was <HI>Ines,</HI> who was
more concealed than usual, and I could not know her but by
her Voice. How industriously you hide your self, said I to
her. Do you think, Madam, that the thoughts of not being
able to see you, and the violent desires I have for it are not
enough to kill me with Grief? If you'l come along with me,
says she, you shall see me. But for the present I must hood∣wink
you. To be free with you, said I to her, till now, you
have appeared very amiable to me; but this Mysterious Car∣riage,
which serves to no end, but to make me suffer, is trouble∣some.
If I am so unhappy to be thought by you an unfaithful
man, you ought not at all to trust me, but if on the contrary,
I am in your good Opinion, you ought to declare it, by a
more ingenuous proceeding. Interrupting me, says she, you
ought to be perswaded, that I have strong Reasons for what I
do, since notwithstanding what you have now told me, I al∣ter
not my Resolution. The thing however is at your choice,
but for my own part, I will not let you come into my Coach,
but upon that Condition. As the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally ob∣stinate,
I rather chose to suffer my Eyes to be covered than to
break off with her. I must needs own, that these appearances
of Good Fortune, had filled me with some sort of Vanity, and I
fancyed my self with some Princess, which for the present had
no mind I should know her, but afterwards, that I should find
her, one of the most perfect and rich Women of <HI>Spain.</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
This conceit hindered me any longer to oppose her will. I
told her, I submitted to her, to be hood-winked, and even to
be blinded by her, if she could please her self in the Action.
She tyed a Handkerchief about my Head so hard, that at first she
put me in terrible pain: I sat me down by her, it was now dark,
I knew not whether we were going, but I gave my self up en∣tirely
into her power.</P>
<P>She had with her two other Women, the Coach moved so
long, that I believe we pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> through most of the streets of
<HI>Madrid.</HI> She entertained me with such witty Discourse, that I
had no need to think the time or way long, and I was even
charmed with hearing her, when our unlucky Coach, which
was but a mean one, run upon another, and all on a sudden was
overturned. And we happened to fall in a place called the <HI>Maree,</HI>
which is one of the greatest and nastiest Ditches in the City. I
was never so vexed in my life; the three Ladies fell upon me,
they almost stiried me, and I was even deaf with their noise.
Having my Eyes bound, and my Head turned about after a
strange fashion, I could not have my share of making a noise,
without swallowing a great deal of this stinking Water. I then
began to make some Reflections on the unlucky hours of a
Man's Life; and though I dearly loved <HI>Ines,</HI> yet I found that
I loved my self more, and wished I had never seen her. I can∣not
positively tell how things past, but I felt my self delivered
from that heavy weight which so oppressed me; and when,
by the help of some People which drew me out, I got upon my
leggs, I could neither see <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes</HI> nor her Companions. The Folks
which stood about me, laughed like so many Fools, to see me
hood-winked and so covered with this black Water, that I looked
as if I had come out of an Ink-tub. I askt the Coach-man where
his Mistress was. He told me the Lady with whom I was, was
none of his Mistress, and that she went away cursing of me; that
she was very dirty, that he knew her not, and that she only
said to him at going away, that I must pay him. And prithee
said I, where didst thou take her up? He answered me, At the
Gate <HI>Delcalcas Reales,</HI> and that an Old Woman came for him,
and brought him to that place where he took her up. For my
Money I got him to carry me home. I expected <HI>Belleville</HI>
with a mixture of impatience and Grief: It was late before he
came, and he was extreamly satisfied with <HI>Isabella,</HI> in whom he
found abundance of good Nature, and an infinite deal of Wit.</P>
<P>I related to him my Adventure, he could not but laugh
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artily a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it; and as he was filled with an extraordinary Joy,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he told me a hundred pleasant Stories, which put me in∣deed
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>
into a very bad Humour: It was day-light before we went
to Bed, and I had not got up, but to take a walk with him in
the <HI>Prado.</HI> As we were going along by some very low Win∣dows,
I heard <HI>Ines</HI> cry out to me. <HI>Cavallero,</HI> go not so fast,
it is at least fit to ask you how you do after your fall last Night.
Advancing to the Window, pray, said I to her, what became of
you, fair <HI>Ines?</HI> And had not I misfortunes enough, but I must
loose you too. You had not lost me, replyed she, but that a
Lady, who was my Relation, passing by in that moment knew
my voice, and I was obliged against my mind, to go with her
in her Coach, for I was unwilling she should see us together;
though the Coach-man told me another story, yet I durst not
examine any further into the matter, for fear of making her
uneasie, and with abundance of kindness I askt her, when I
should have an Opportunity without any restraint to let her
know what a mighty Passion and Respect I had for her. It
shall be very quickly, says she, for now I begin to think you love
me; but yet time must confirm me in this Opinion. Oh!
you are very cruel, said I, and must have very little Love for
me, thus to defer what I so earnestly beg. Speak the truth
freely, says she, and tell me whether you will Marry me? Yes,
said I, if you will, I'll Marry you, notwithstanding I never yet
had a full sight of you, nor have had the happiness to know you.
I am Rich, says she, and am of Birth, and they tell me, I have
some Personal Merits. I replyed, You have all the things which
please me, beyond any Person in the World: Your Wit hath
charmed me, but you make me often despair, and I had much
rather choose to dye at once, than suffer what I do. She fell a
laughing, and after that, there were few Evenings that we did
not converse together, either at the <HI>Prado,</HI> or at <HI>Mansanarez,</HI> or
else at some House unknown to me, whither I was conducted. I
must confess I never went into the Chamber with her, and I
only talkt to her through the Grates of the Window, where
for four hours together I used to make the most impertinent Fi∣gure
in the World. To speak freely, one must live in <HI>Spain</HI> to
be able to endure such ways and Customs; but yet really I loved
<HI>Ines;</HI> I observed in her something that was very smart and ta∣king,
which surprized and affected me.</P>
<P>One time I met her in a Garden, where she had appointed
me to be, and where she shewed me more kindness than she
used to do. When she saw it begin to be dark, she desired me
to be gone; I unwillingly obeyed her, and as I went along a
narrow Street, I perceived three Men with Sword in hand, set
<PB N="118" REF="121"/>
upon one single Man, who defended himself valiantly: I could
not endure to see so unequal a Match, and I run to second him,
but just as I came up to him, they made a pass at him, and he
fell upon me like a dead Man. These Murderers run away as
fast as they could, and by this time the noise had drawn out a
great many People, who seeing me with my Sword in hand,
made no question that I was one of the Criminals. They pre∣pared
to seize me, but perceiving their ill intentions, I thought
it was better to provide for my safety by flight, than to trust
to my Innocence. I was closely pursued, and which way soe∣ver
I took, still they met with me. In this distress, I had a
glimpse of a Door half open, I slipt into it without any body's
seeing me, and groping along. I came at last into a very dark
Hall, I perceived Light through a door, I could not tell whether
it was best to open it, nor what I should say, if there were
People in it. I considered with my self, that I had the looks
of one affrighted, and that I should be taken for a Man that came
from doing some ill Action, and sought for an Opportunity to
do some other: I deliberated a long time, I listened with great
Attention to hear some body talk, and hearing none, at last I
ventured, and softly opened the Door, and saw no body; I
nimbly looked about where to hide my self; methought the
Hangings stuck out in some places, and really I got behind
them in a little corner: I had been there but a very little while,
when I espyed coming in, <HI>Ines</HI> and <HI>Isabella.</HI> I cannot express
to you, Madam, what a pleasant Amazement I was in, to find
my self in my Mistress's House: I no ways doubted, that For∣tune
favoured my Design; I was in no fear of those who might
search after me, and as I was even ready to go and throw my
self down at her feet. I heard <HI>Isabella</HI> begin to Discourse. Says
she, What hast thou been doing to day, dear <HI>Ines,</HI> Hast thou
seen <HI>Daucourt?</HI> Yes, says <HI>Ines,</HI> I have seen him, and I have
reason to believe he loves me desperately, unless all my Rules
deceive me; he talks very seriously of Marrying me, that which
perplexes me, is, that he will first see and know me. And
how is it possible for thee to deny either the one or the other?
replies <HI>Isabella.</HI> No, I do not pretend to do it, answers <HI>Ines,</HI>
only I'll take the most favourable Opportunies, I fancy I shall
not think it cunning to set my self in a full light, and all the Cur∣tains
open; no▪ I intend they shall be close drawn, and that
the Windows shall only let in some glimmering Rays of the Sun,
which shall serve to set me off. As to my Birth, I have got my
Pedigree Authentically drawn, which cost me nothing but a
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>
little Old Parchment gnawed by the Mice. And as to ready
Money, thou knowest my Old Lover, honest <HI>Don Diego,</HI> will
furnish me, when <HI>Daucourt</HI> has told and received it, he will lit∣tle
think, that Thieves appointed to take it away from him up∣on
our very Wedding-Night: I have this day taken very fair
Lodgings ready Furnished, so that thou wilt yield, I have neg∣lected
nothing which might contribute to the success of a business
so advantagious to me, and which I so much desire. Says <HI>Isa∣bella,</HI>
thy precautions seem very wise, but yet I fear the disco∣very
of the Intrigue. But says <HI>Ines,</HI> Prethee my Dear, what
dost thou do? As to Marriage I make but a small Progress, says
<HI>Isabella,</HI> but to speak truth that is not my Design: I find <HI>Bel∣leville</HI>
an honest Man, I am sensible that I love him, I only
desire the possession of his Heart, and I fancy, I should be sor∣ry
if he would Marry me. Thou art of an odd sort of Humour,
says <HI>Ines,</HI> thou lovest him, thy Fortune is none of the greatest,
thou mightest be happy with him, and yet thou durst not de∣sire
to be his Wife. But Prethee, says <HI>Isabella,</HI> who told thee
that I should be happy with him? Love is so unconstant a thing
that hardly are the first moments of Marriage pleasant; I tell
thee, Love must have something continually to provoke and spur
it. Novelty is a grateful Dish to it, and how is it possible for a
Wife always to be new? And how can a Mistress either, cries
<HI>Ines,</HI> be so? Go, <HI>Isabella,</HI> thy Modish Maxims are not reasona∣ble.
Neither, says <HI>Isabella,</HI> can I like of what thou designest,
and if thou would'st take my Advice, thou should'st seriously
consider thine own Age, for to speak freely, thou art Old, very
Old: Is it just for sixty Years, to put a Cheat upon a Man of
thirty? He will be enraged at thee, he will certainly forsake
thee, or else he'll break thy Bones, nay, it may happen he'll
knock thy Brains out before he leaves thee. <HI>Ines</HI> was of a
Quick Apprehension and brisk; she took it hainously that <HI>Isa∣bella</HI>
should reproach her with her Age, and immediately she
gave her the greatest box on the Ear which perhaps was ever
given. The other, of as hasty a Nature, returned her two,
<HI>Ines</HI> lent her a dozen good cuffs with her fist, which were spee∣dily
repaid: So that my two Female Champions entred the
Field of <HI>Mars.</HI> The Combat was so extream pleasant between
them, that I almost broke mysides with laughing in my little Hole.
I had much ado to hinder my self from breaking out aloud, for you
may easily believe, Madam, that I had very little concern for either
of them, after the Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k which I understood was to be put upon
<PB N="120" REF="123"/>
me with so much Malice, and when I must necessarily look up∣on
<HI>Ines</HI> as a common Jilt. <HI>Isabella,</HI> who knew all the weak
places of her Enemy, took her Opportunities, and being both
younger and stronger, tore off her Head-dress, and left her all
bald. In my whole Life I was never more surprized, than to
see the Hair fall off, which before appeared so lovely to me, and
which I thought had been her own: But this was nothing to
what followed, for with one blow of her fist she not only made
several of her Teeth leap out of her Mouth, but also two little
Cork plumpers, which served to fill out her hollow Jaws. And
here the Fray ended, for their Chamber-Maids, who had heard
the noise of the Skirmish, run in, and with much ado parted
them. They said the bitterest things one against the other, and
even threatned to reveal to the inquisition most terrible Crimes,
with which they reproached each other.</P>
<P><HI>Ines</HI> finding her self with her Chamber-maid only, looked at
her self a long time in a great Glass, and protested that there
was nothing so injurious, which she had not said to <HI>Isabella,</HI>
that she might be revenged of her for the Abuses she had re∣ceived
from her: At last she sat her down and rested her self a
while; a little Table was brought and set before her, and upon
it she lays an Artificial Eye, which used to fill up the place of a
Natural one she wanted; afterwards, she takes off her Face as
much white and red Colour, as without any Hyperbole, would
have covered a Mask. It would be hard to describe to you, Ma∣dam,
the extraordinary ugliness of this Woman, who till now,
had appeared to me very pretty. I rubbed my Eyes, I was like
a Man that could not tell whether he doted or had some idle
Dream. To be short, she undrest her self and was almost na∣ked:
and here I shall forbear representing to you this frightful
Carcass. But certainly, Love never met with a better Cure;
in all those parts where other Folks are fat and plump, she was
lean and hollow, she lookt perfectly like a Skeleton, which by
some secret Spring was made to move about the Room: She
was in a Gown with a white Mantle upon her Shoulders, her
Head bald and her Arms appeared extream little and lean; she
bethought her self, that in the Scuffle her Pearl Bracelets broke,
she had a mind to gather them up, but had enough to do to
find them; her Chamber-maid came to help her, they counted
them, and found they had all but two which were well cursed
for my sake: <HI>Ines</HI> swore by St. <HI>James,</HI> Patron of <HI>Spain,</HI> that
she would not go to Bed till she had found them: Her Maid
and she lookt in every corner and hole, removing the Tables,
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>
tumbling the Chairs, and throwing this way and that way eve∣ry
thing they came near, for <HI>Ines</HI> was in a very ill Humour: As
I saw her make towards my corner, fear of being discovered by
such a Fury, made me lye as close as 'twas possible; but unluck∣ily
as I drew back, I threw down several Bottles which stood
there upon Shelves, and these made a mighty noise: <HI>Ines</HI> belie∣ving
it was the Cat which had done this mischief, with all her
might cryed out, <HI>Gat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Gat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,;</HI> that is Cat, Cat; and lifting up
the Hangings to chastise the Cat, with an amazement and rage
which almost struck her dead upon the spot, she espyed me, she
fell violently upon me, and pulled the Hair off my Head, she
reviled me grievously, she was like one Frantick, the Veins of
her Neck were so swelled, and her wrinkles and surrows were
so frightful, that methought I saw the Head of <HI>Medusa;</HI> and in
this my great Terror, I considered my escape, when on a sud∣den
I heard a strange noise upon the Stairs which gave me a fresh
Alarm: But <HI>Ines</HI> left me, and run down to know what was the
matter, and by that time, the whole House was filled with cries
and weeping: The Officers of Justice, who had found this
Young Man (of whom I told you before, Madam) lying
upon the Ground, and was the cause I was so hotly pursued, after
some diligent search, found that he was the Son of a Lady who
lived in the same House, they brought him thus with his Body all
wounded and bloody, at which sad sight she fell into a desperate
condition. And as I had told <HI>Ines</HI> something of my Adventure,
that I might give her some satisfaction why I came into her Cham∣ber,
so this lean Hag, would not keep my Secret, but to be re∣venged
on me for having discovered her crafty tricks, was re∣solved
to inform against me. I have the Murderer in my pow∣er,
cries she, come along with me, and I'll deliver him up to
you. Immediately she opens her Chamber-door, and being
followed by a Troop of <HI>Alquazils,</HI> that is to say, Serjeants or
Bayliffs, delivered me up to them with all the necessary Evi∣dence
for my speedy Tryal. Says she, I saw this wretch with
his naked Sword all bloody with the wound he came from giv∣ing;
he ran into my Chamber to save himself, and threatned
me with Death if I would not conceal him. Whatever I
could say in my Justification was all in vain, they would not so
much as hear me; they bound my Hands with Cords, and so
led me to Prison as a wretched Malefactor, whilst good <HI>Ines,</HI>
and the Mother and Sister of the wounded, loaded me with
blows and curses; they caused me to be put in a Hole, where
I was several days without having the liberty to give notice to
<PB N="122" REF="125"/>
my Brother or my Friends of what has past, they likewise were
in mighty pain about me, concluding for certain, that I was
murdered in some corner of a Street, or else at some of my Night-Intrigues.</P>
<P>At last, <HI>Belleville,</HI> who still continued to see <HI>Isabella,</HI> acquain∣ted
her with his grief, and begged her to assist him to discover
at least, what they had done with my Body: She was so indu∣strious
to get information about it, that <HI>Ines</HI> Chambermaid, who
had been ill enough used by her Mistress, told her the whole
Secret of the History, altho' her good Lady had strictly forbid
her. Upon this News, my Brother ran to beg the King to have
pity on me, and to command them to remove me out of that
hole, which seemed more like Hell than a Prison: I swooned
away when I saw light: I was so wasted and weak that I fright∣ed
folks, but yet I could not come out of Prison for some time,
because of certain Formalities, and I leave you to think, Madam,
what I meditated against the perfidious <HI>Ines,</HI> but yet I know
not whether ever I should be in a condition to put in execution
all the Projects of my just Revenge, for the Gentleman, who
was wounded, continued very ill, and his Life was despaired of,
mine depended upon such a ticklish point, that I put up most
ardent Prayers for him, and in such a melancholy uncertainty,
I past a great many hours. But my Brother, who was perswa∣ded
of my Innocence, omitted nothing for the discovery of the
Authors of this Murderous Act. At last, he understood that
this young and wounded <HI>Cavallero</HI> had a Rival, and he made so
diligent a Search and Examination, that he certainly new that
the Blow came from thence, he was so fortunate to get him ap∣prehended,
and this Man freely owned the Fact, which acquit∣ted
me. I was therefore set at Liberty, and I conceived so much
Joy at it, that I was sick for several days after, or rather per∣haps,
it was an effect of that unwholsome Air which I received
in the Prison.</P>
<P>In the mean while, wicked <HI>Ines,</HI> who to be sure was not much
at ease, for fear of what might happen upon her serving me such
a pleasant Trick, having notice that I was set free, and in a condi∣tion
to Reward her according to her Merits, packed up her Bag∣gage,
and one Night privately runs away, and no body knew
whither she was gone, so that when we wanted her, at least to
make her an Example among the cheating <HI>Jilts,</HI> we were dis∣appointed.
But I was easily satisfied, because naturally I do not
love to do any hurt to Women. But lest she might play me
some other pranks, I left <HI>Madrid,</HI> that I might also avoid those
of <HI>Spain.</HI> I am now returning into <HI>France,</HI> Madam, continued
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
he, whither I shall be very glad to carry your Commands, if
you'll do me so great an Honour to lay any upon me.</P>
<P>Though I have some trouble at what happened to this Gentle∣man,
yet I could not chuse but laugh at some Circumstances of
this Adventure, and I am willing to believe, Dear Cosen, that
you will not be displeased, that I make you partake with me. I
shall write to you no more till I come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> where I pro∣mise
my self to see things far more worthy of your Notice, than
hitherto I have been able to acquaint you.</P>

<P>I Would not, if you please, Dear Cosen, have you angry,
that I did not write to you as soon as I arrived at <HI>Madrid:</HI>
I thought it was better to tarry till I was in a condition to tell
you something more exactly and curious. I knew that my
Kinswomen was to go before me, as far as <HI>Alcouendus,</HI> which
is about six Leagues distance from <HI>Madrid.</HI> As she was not yet
come, and I had a mind to stay for her, <HI>Don Frederic de Car∣donne</HI>
proposed to me to go Dine at a very fine House, the
Master whereof was his particular Acquaintance; So that in∣stead
of going into this little Village, we crossed by it, and
through a Walk pleasant enough, we came to the House of <HI>Don
Augustin Pacheco.</HI> This Gentleman is ancient, and yet he is
lately marryed to <HI>Donna Thoresa de Figucroa.</HI> This is his Third
Wife, and she is but Seventeen Years of Age; but of such an
agreeable Humour, and so ingenious, that we were perfectly
Charmed with her Wit and her Person: It was then Ten a
Clock when we got there. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally Lazy,
and love to rise late; and these Two were yet in Bed. Her
Husband gave us such a frank and civil Reception, as suffici∣ently
testified how much he was pleased that we came to see
him. He went to walk in his Gardens, whose Exactness yields
in nothing to ours. I accompanied him without delay; for
the Weather was very inviting, and the Trees in this Country
are as forward in the Month of <HI>March,</HI> as they are in <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>
at the latter end of <HI>June.</HI> Indeed this is the most Charming
Season for the enjoyment of what they call <HI>La Prima Vera,</HI>
that is to say, the Beginning of the Spring: For when the
Sun begins to have more Force and Heat, it scorches and wi∣thers
the Leaves, as if they had passed through Flames. These
Gardens of which I speak, were adorned with Bowling-Greens,
Fountains and Statues, and <HI>Don Augustin</HI> was not backward to
shew us all the Rarities. He is much taken with them, and
values not spending Money thereon; for he is very rich. He
led us into a Gallery, where there were divers Tables of Ce∣dar
Wood, set full of Books. He immediately led us up to
the Biggest of them, and told us, they contained an nestima∣ble
Treasure, and that there was a Collection of Plays of the best
Authors: Heretofore, <HI>continued he,</HI> Vertuous persons could not
think fit to go to Plays; there was nothing to be seen but
Actions contrary to Modesty; they heard Discourses which
were offensive; the Actors made honest People ashamed, there
Vice was flattered, and Vertue condemned; the Scenes became
bloody with Combats, the weakest was always opprest by the
strongest, and Custom gave continuance to Crimes. But since
<HI>Lopes de Vega</HI> hath so successfully laboured to reform the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Theatre, there is now nothing suffered contrary to good Man∣ners:
Both the Favourite, the Footman, and the Ploughman, with∣out
disguise, keeping to their Native Simplicity, and making that
pleasant by an ingenuous turn, find the Secrets to cure Princes,
and even our Kings, of that common Disease to hear Truth, when
their own Faults are represented. It was he who gave Rules
for these Ascents, and who taught them to divide their Plays
into Three <HI>Jordana</HI>'s, or Acts. Since his time, we have seen
flourish the <HI>Montalvanes,</HI> the <HI>Mendoza'n,</HI> the <HI>Rojas Alarcones,</HI>
the <HI>Veles,</HI> the <HI>Mira de Mescuas,</HI> the <HI>Coellos,</HI> and the <HI>Villaizanes.</HI>
But above all, <HI>Don Pedro Calderonne</HI> excelled as to the Serious
and Grave Part, and even in the Comick Part he surpassed
all those that went before him. I could not forbear telling him,
That at <HI>Victoria</HI> I saw a Play, which to me seemed bad enough:
And if I might speak my Judgment freely, I would not have
them intermixt with <HI>Holy Tragedies</HI> (which require great Re∣spect,
and according to their Subjects should be worthily ma∣naged)
any idle or silly Jests. He replyed, That by this I had
said to him, he knew the Genius of my Country; that he
had seldom observed the <HI>French</HI> to like what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did,
and as this Thought carryed him to some displeasing Reflections,
I assured him, That Naturally we have no Antipathy for any
Nation; That we even thought our selves obliged to do Justice
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>
to our Enemies. And as to plays, though I had yet found
none to my Fancy, it did not follow but that there might be o∣thers
much better and more agreeable to me. The manner of
my talking to him did a little compose him; so that he desired
me to go into his Wifes Apartment, which was at the end of
the Gallery.</P>
<P><HI>Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI> and the three other Knights, tarryed
there, because it is not the Custom in <HI>Spain</HI> for Men to go in∣to
Womens Chambers while they are in Bed. A Brother has
not this Priviledge unless his Sister be sick. <HI>Donna Theresa</HI> re∣ceived
me in as kind and obliging a manner, as if we had been
long acquainted. And this must be confessed, in praise of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> that nothing of that sort of Familiarity which comes
from want of, or a mean Education, appears in their En∣tertainments;
for with great Civility and Earnestness they are
very careful to pay what they owe to others, and at the same
time do not forget what's due to themselves. She was in Bed
without any Coife or Cornet; her Hair was parted in the mid∣dle
of her Forehead tyed behind with a Ribbon, and wrapt up
with Carnation coloured Taffety. Her Shift was very fine, and
of so vast a largeness, that it lookt like a Surplice, the Sleeves
were as big as Mens, and buttoned at the Hands with Diamonds.
Instead of narrow Point at the Neck and Hands, she had hers
wrought with Blue and Flesh coloured Silk in Flowers; her
Ruffles were of White Taffety Pinkt.—She had several lit∣tle
Pillows tyed with Ribbons, and trimed with very broad
and fine Lace; she had Basses all of Flowers of Point <HI>de Spain</HI>
in Silk and Gold, which lookt very pretty? Her Bed was all of
Copper, Guilt with little Balls of Ivory and Ebony; her Bed-Head
was adorned with four Rows of little Copper Ballisters,
very well wrought.</P>
<P>She asked me leave to rise, but when she came to put on her
Stockings and Shooes, she caused the Key to be taken out of the
Door, and that to be bolted. I enquired the Reason of this
Barricading: She told me, That she knew there was with me
some <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentlemen, and that she had rather lose her Life
than they should see her Feet. I broke out into Laughter, and
begged her to let me see them; for that I could not apprehend
that the thing was of that moment. It is true indeed, that for
their Littleness they are something extraordinary; for I have
seen Children of six Years old have as great. As soon as she
was up, she took a little Cup full of <HI>Red,</HI> and with a good big
Pencil she laid it on, not only upon her Cheecks, her Chin▪ un∣der
her Nose, above her Eye-brows, and the Edges of her E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;
<PB N="126" REF="129"/>
but she also bedaubed the inside of her Hands, her Fingers, and
her Shoulders. She told me that every Night at going to Bed,
and every Morning at rising, they laid this Colour on; That
she did not paint, and that she was willing enough to leave the
use of this <HI>Red,</HI> but that it was such a General Custom, that it
could not be dispenced with, for let one be of never so fresh
a Colour, they would look pale and sickly when they were near
others, if they did not use this <HI>Red.</HI> One of her Women per∣fumed
her from Head to Foot, with excellent Pastrils, the
Smoak whereof she made to ascend to her, another took O∣range
Flower-Water in her Mouth, and dexterously through
her Teeth she sprinkled it like Rain upon her; and this they
call <HI>Roussia.</HI> She told me, That there was nothing that spoiled
the Teeth more than this was of squirting it, but that the Wa∣ter
smelt better for it. Of this I doubted, and I thought it ve∣ry
ugly, that an Old Woman such as that was which I saw there,
should come and spurt Water out of her Mouth, in my Face.</P>
<P><HI>Don Augustin</HI> having known by one of his Wife's Servants,
that she was drest, did not stand upon the Custom of the
Countrey, but lead <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> and the Knights into her
Chamber. The Conversation was not long in common, but we
divided; for my part, I discoursed with <HI>Donna Theresa,</HI> and she
told me, she was born at <HI>Madrid,</HI> but was brought up at <HI>Lisbon</HI>
with her Grand-mother, who was Sister to <HI>Don Augustin Pache∣co,</HI>
so that her Husband was her great Uncle, and these sort of
Alliances are often contracted in <HI>Spain.</HI> She talkt to me much
of the Young <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and boasted mightily of
her Wit, and told me▪ if I would go into her Closet, I might
judge of her Beauty, for she had her Picture there. I immedi∣ately
went, and was surprized with the Charms I observed in
this Princess. She had her Hair cut and curled like the Peri∣wig
of an Abbot, and an Invention for preserving Children
from falling, so big, that there were upon it▪ Two Baskets of
Flowers, and little Vessels of a Medicinal Earth, of which they
eat a great deal in <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> although 'tis an Earth
that hath little Taste. <HI>Donna Theresa</HI> shewed me the Skin of a
Serpent, which her Husband killed in the <HI>Indies;</HI> and though
it was dead, yet I was afraid of it. Those of this kind are ex∣tream
dangerous; but it seems as if Providence had taken care
to preserve Men from them, for these Serpents have a sort of
Bell about their Head, which rings when they move, and so
gives notice to Travellers to secure themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="130"/>
This young Lady, who is a great Lover of <HI>Portugal,</HI> discour∣sed
to me much in its Favour: She told me, That the Sea,
which flows up into the <HI>Tagus,</HI> renders that River capable to
bear the greatest Gallions, and the fairest Ships upon the Ocean.
That the City of <HI>Lisbon</HI> stands upon the side of a little Hill, which
insensibly descends to the very Brink of the <HI>Tagus:</HI> So that the
Houses being built one above another, are all seen at once, and
so becomes a very pleasant Prospect. The old Walls which the
<HI>Moors</HI> built about it, are yet standing: There are of them four
Rounds, built at divers times; the last may have about six
Leagues Circumference. The Castle, which stands upon a Hill,
hath its particular Beauties: In it you see <HI>Palaces, Churches,
Fortifications, Gardens, Armories and Streets:</HI> There's always a
good Garrison with a Governour: This Fortress commands the
City, and from thence they may thunder upon it, in case it
proves rebellious. The Palace where the <HI>King</HI> lives, is more con∣siderable,
if not for its Strength, yet for the Uniformity of its
Buildings: Every thing there is Great and Magnificent, the
Prospect it has to the Sea hath made them take so much care
to beautify it. She discoursed to me afterwards of the Publick
Places, which are adorned with Vaults and Arches, and of the
great Houses round about the <HI>Dominicans</HI> Convent, where the
<HI>Inquisition</HI> is, before the Gate of which there is a Fountain, with
a great many Statues of White Marble, which throw the Wa∣ter
every way. She added, That the Fair of <HI>Reucio</HI> is kept on
the <HI>Tuesday</HI> of every Week, in a Place which might be taken
for an <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI> because 'tis environed with little Hills,
upon which are built several fair Palaces. There's another Place
on the side of the <HI>Tagus,</HI> where the Market is kept, and there
one may meet with every thing which can be desired, of the
best in his kind, either in Fowl, Fish, Fruits, Herbs or Pulse.
The <HI>Custom-House</HI> stands a little higher up, where there is infi∣nite
Riches and Rarities, and some Fortifications are lately made
to preserve them. The Metropolitan Church is not eminent
for any thing but its Antiquity: It is dedicated to St. <HI>Vincent,</HI>
it is pretended that after he had suffered Martyrdom, they re∣fused
him Burial, and that the Ravens watcht over his Body, till
some pious Persons came and took it up, and carried it to <HI>Valen∣tia</HI>
in <HI>Spain,</HI> to have it worshipt, and for this Reason there are
Ravens kept in the Church, and there is a Box for them, into
which are are put the Alms to buy them Food.</P>
<P>Although <HI>Lisbon, continued she,</HI> is a very pleasant place to live
in, yet we dwelt at <HI>Alcantara:</HI> This Village is not above a
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>
quarter of a League from the City: There's in it a <HI>Royal</HI> House
not so fine for its Buildings, as for its Situation; the River sup∣plies
the place of a Channel: There one sees admirable Gar∣dens,
all filled with Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts and Cataracts, or great Falls of Wa∣ter,
as well as Spouts of Water. <HI>Belem</HI> is not far from hence:
it is the place designed for the <HI>Sepulture</HI> of the Kings of <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI>
in the Church of the <HI>Hieronomites:</HI> it is all covered over
with White Marble; the Pillars and Statues are of the same; the
Tombs are in even Rows in three different Chappels, amongst
which there are some well wrought. <HI>Belem, Feriera, Sacavin,</HI>
and some other places about the City, are remarkable for the
vast quantities of Oranges and Lemons growing there; the Air
you smell there is all perfumed; you can hardly sit down under
the Trees, but you are covered with their Flowers, one sees
running amongst them a Thousand little Rivulets, and it may
be affirmed, that there is nothing more sweet in the Night,
than the Murmurs and Harmony which are there frequently
heard. At <HI>Belem</HI> there are great Magazines of Oranges, both
sweet and four Lemmons, Pom-Citrons and Lemmons. They
load them on small Vessels, and so transport them into most
parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise she told me of the Knights <HI>del Habito de Christo, of
the Habit of Christ,</HI> whose multitude made them less considera∣ble,
and also of the <HI>Counts</HI> of the Kingdom, which have the
same Priviledges as the <HI>Grandees of Spain;</HI> they are possessed of
<HI>Las Comarcas,</HI> which are certain Lands belonging to the Crown,
and divided into Counties of a considerable Value. She told
me, that when the <HI>King</HI> intended to go abroad, the People
had notice of it by a Trumpet, which sounds very early in the
Morning in the place through which his Majesty is to pass.
For the <HI>Queen,</HI> 'tis a Flute and a Drum; for the <HI>Infanta,</HI> a
Hautboy. When they all go abroad together, the Trumpet, the
Drum, the Flute, and the Hautboy, march in a Company, and
by this means, if any one which cannot get into the <HI>Palace</HI> to
present a Petition, he need only wait for the King's coming by.
Eight Leagues from <HI>Coimbri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> there's a Fountain in a place cal∣led
<HI>Cedima,</HI> which draws in, and swallows down every thing
which touches its Water. Experiments are often made from
great branches of Trees, and sometimes of Horses, which they
cause to be brought there, from whence they cannot get back,
but with great difficulty.</P>
<P>But that which causes the greatest wonder, added she, is the
<HI>Lake</HI> of the Mountain of <HI>Strella,</HI> where there are often found
the Wrecks of Ships, broken Masts, Anchors, and Sails, and yet
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>
the Sea is above twelve Leagues off, and this is upon the top
of a very high Hill too, it cannot be imagined by what means
all these things should come there. Whilst I was hearing with
great delight <HI>Donna Theresa</HI> relate these things, her Husband
and the rest of the Company came and interrupted us. <HI>Don
Augustin</HI> was a Man of Understanding, and for all his Age, was
very pleasant. If my Curiosity is not indiscreet, pray Madam,
says he, tell me, what Subject this Child has entertained you
with? <HI>Mi Tio,</HI> replied she, that is my Uncle, you may easily
believe it was <HI>Portugal?</HI> Oh! I thought as much, cryed he;
There it is she always choses her Field of Action. Dear <HI>God,</HI>
says she, every body has some place they love, and when once
you are got to your <HI>Mexico,</HI> one cannot draw you from thence.
You have been in the <HI>Indies,</HI> resumed I, and <HI>Donna Theresa</HI> hath
shewed me a Serpent, which she says you killed there. It is
true, Madam, continued he, and if it were not time for you
to Dine, it would not, it may be, be unpleasant to you to hear
of what I have seen there. But, says he, I should go to <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI>
and if you please I'll bring to you <HI>Donna Theresa:</HI> It is
there indeed, where I should lay the Scene of Discourse, and
where I could tell you of things which I believe you would not
be unwilling to know. I assured him, that he would do me a
particular favour to give me so signal a mark of his kindness;
and that I should be over joyed to see the fair <HI>Donna Theresa,</HI>
and to hear her talk of the <HI>Indies,</HI> she that discoursed so admi∣rably
of every thing. He took me by the Hand and led me
down into a Hall pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with Marble, which was hung with
Pictures instead of Tapistry, and set round with Cushions.
Cloth was laid there upon a Table for the Men, but upon a Car∣pet
on the Floor, it was laid for <HI>Donna Theresa,</HI> my self, and my
Daughter.</P>
<P>I was surprized at this Fashion, not having been used to Dine
so; however I took no notice of it, and I had a mind to try it,
but I was never more uneasie; my Leggs aked most horribly:
one while I leaned upon my Elbow, and then upon my Hand:
In a word, I could not Dine, and yet the good Lady was not
sensible of it, for she thought the Women in <HI>France</HI> were used
to eat upon a Floor, as they did in <HI>Spain.</HI> But <HI>Don Fernand
de Toledo,</HI> who observed me uneasie, rose from Table with <HI>Don
Frederic de Cardonna,</HI> and both of them told me, that absolute∣ly
I should sit with them. I was willing enough, provided <HI>Don∣na
Theresa</HI> would do so too; but she durst not, because there
were Men, upon whom she did not so much as lift up her Eyes
but by stealth. <HI>Don Augustin</HI> bid her come without Ceremony
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>
and told her, that they must let me know, that they were glad
to see me at their House. But that which was very pleasant,
was when this Lady was set upon a Chair, she was no less at
ease, then I was when I sat upon the Carpet, she protested
with a pretty sort of freedom, that she never before sat in a
Chair, and that she had never once thought on't. Thus we
dined very merrily, and there was nothing which could be ad∣ded
to the obliging manner of my Reception in this House. I
gave to <HI>Donna Theresa</HI> some Ribbons, Pins, and a Fan. She was
mightily pleased, and gave me as many thanks, as if the Present
had been of value. Here thanks were not common, one could
not observe in them any thing that was low or covetous. And
to speak truth, they have abundance of Wit and Sense in this
Country, it appears even in the smallest trifles.</P>
<P>I had not been gone an hour from this House, when I saw
coming towards us two Coaches drawn by six Mules apiece,
which galloped a great pace, and faster than the best Horses could
do. I could hardly have believed that Mules could run so fast.
But that which I wondred most at, was the manner of their
being harnassed. These two Coaches and their Furniture took up
almost a quarter of a League of room. There was one with
six Glasses indifferent large, and made like ours, except that
the upper part is very low, and so Inconvenient. Within it
had a Cornish or Wood gilt but so large, that it lookt like one
for a Chamber. The Coach was guilt on the out-side, which is
only allowed to Embassadors and Strangers. The Curtains were
of Damask and Cloth sewed together. The Coach-man rode
upon one of the four Mules, they do not sit in the Coach-box,
although there is one; and upon my asking the Reason of it,
<HI>Don Frederick de Cardonne</HI> told me, that he had been assured,
that this Custom had been ever since the Coach man of the
Lord Duke <HI>De Olivares</HI> drove his Master, who over-hearing
something of great importance which the Duke told to one of
his Friends, revealed it, the matter having made a great noise
at Court, (for it seems the Duke accused his Friend of some in∣discretion,
which nevertheless he was innocent of) ever since,
they have been so cautious to make the Coachman ride upon the
first Mule. Their Traces are silk and Hempen Cords, so exces∣sive
long, that from one Mule to another, there's above three
Ells distance, and I cannot understand, but every thing should
break at the rate they run. It is true, that though they run
very fast in the Country, yet they go very softly in the City, and
'tis a tiresome thing to go so slowly as if they told their steps.
And though at <HI>Madrid</HI> they have but four Mules, yet they have
<PB N="131" REF="134"/>
a Postilion. My Relation was in the first of these Coaches, with
three <HI>Spanish</HI> Ladies. The Gentlemen and the Pages were in
the other, which was not made after the same manner. It had
Boots, as formerly our Coaches had, they are to let down, and
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eather is open at bottom, so that when the Women come
out (if they have no mind their Feet should be seen) the Boot
is let down to the ground to hide their Shooes. It had Glasses
twice as big as my hand, made fast to each end of the Coach,
for the conveniency of calling to the Footmen. Nothing
more resembles our Garret-windows than the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> do. The top
of the Coach is covered with Gray <HI>Parragon,</HI> and the Curtains
are of the same, large and long, hang without and draw round,
and are fastned with Buttons and Loops: This looks very ill,
and you are inclosed within as if you were in a Box.</P>
<P>My Relation was drest, half <HI>French</HI> and half <HI>Spanish:</HI> she seem∣ed
over joyed to see me, and I was no less to see her. As to her
Person, I found her not at all changed, but I could not forbear
laughing at her way of speaking: She now understands very lit∣tle
<HI>French,</HI> although she continually speaks and loves it so much,
that it is impossible for her to learn any other Language: But
she now mixes <HI>Italian, English,</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> with her own Natu∣ral
Language, and this makes such a <HI>Jargon,</HI> as is very strange
to one, who knew her, as I did, to have the <HI>French</HI> Language,
in its purity, and able to read Lectures of it to the Learned. She
cannot endure to be told, that she has forgot it, and indeed she
does not believe it, having never left off speaking it, either with
some of her own Women, or with Ambassadors and Strangers,
who generally understood it. Nevertheless, she speaks very ill.
And if one is not at the Fountain-head, it is difficult long to
speak a Language well, which is every day changing, and con∣tinually
making new progresses.</P>
<P>I found the Ladies which were with her extream pretty: I
do assure you, that there are in this Country some very hand∣some
and amiable. We embraced each other often, and went
back to <HI>Madrid.</HI> Before we came there we past over a sandy
Plain, of about Four Leagues, but so uneven, that every mo∣ment
we fell into Holes big enough to bury the Coach, and
which hindred it from going very fast. This uneven way lasted
till we came to a little Village called <HI>Mandes,</HI> which is but half
a League from <HI>Madrid.</HI> All the Country here is dry, and very
open; you can scarcely see a Tree on any side you look: The
City is scituated in the middle of <HI>Spain,</HI> which is <HI>New Castile.</HI>
It is above an Age since the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have chosen to keep
<PB N="132" REF="135"/>
their Court in it, because of the purity of the Air, and the
goodness of the Water, which really is so good and so light,
that the <HI>Cardinal Infanta</HI> would drink no other when he was in
<HI>Flanders;</HI> and he caused it to be brought by Sea in Earthen
Jars well stopt. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend, that the Founder of
<HI>Madrid</HI> was a Prince named <HI>Ogno Bianor,</HI> Son of <HI>Tiberino,</HI> King
of the <HI>Latines,</HI> and of <HI>Manto,</HI> who had a <HI>Queen,</HI> more Famous
for the Science of <HI>Astrology,</HI> which she understood to a won∣derful
degree, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an for her Birth. 'Tis thought, that <HI>Madrid</HI>
must be in the Heart of <HI>Europe,</HI> because the little Village of
<HI>Pinto,</HI> which is not above Three Leagues from it, is called in
<HI>Latine, Punctum;</HI> and that is reckoned to be in the Center of
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The first thing I observed was, that the City is not enclosed
either with a Wall or Ditch; the Gates, as one may say, are
only made fast by a Latch; those which I have already seen,
are all broken; there is not seen any place of Defence, nei∣ther
Castle, nor in a word, any thing which might not be for∣ced
with throwing of Oranges and Lemmons; but yet it might
be necessary to sortifie this City: The Mountains which are
round it, are of some use for its Defence. I have passed through
some places of them, which are so narrow, that one might shut
them up with a good big Stone, and with a hundred Men op∣pose
the passage of a whole Army. The Streets are long and
straight, and of a good largeness, but there's no place wose
paved; let one go as softly as 'tis possible, yet one is almost
jumbled and shaken to pieces; there are more Ditches and dirty
places than in any City in the World, the Horses go up to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Bellies, and the Coaches up to the middle, so that it dashes all
Gipon you, and you are spoyled unless you either pull up the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asses, or draw the Curtains which I have spoke of: very of∣ten
the Water comes into the Coaches at the bottom of the
Boots, which are open.</P>
<P>The Houses there have rarely any great Gates to them, those
which have are without Courts. The Doors indeed, are pret∣ty
large; and for the Houses, they are very graceful, spacious
and convenient, though they are only built of Earth and Brick.
I think they are altogether as dear at <HI>Paris.</HI> The first Story
which they raise belongs to the <HI>King,</HI> and he can either let,
or sell it, unless the Owner of the House buy it off, which is
almost constantly done, and this is a considerable Revenue to the
<HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>There is commonly in every House Ten or Twelve Rooms
on a Floor; in some Twenty and more; they have their <HI>Sum∣mer</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="136"/>
and their <HI>Winter</HI> Apartments, and very often, one for Au∣tumn,
and another for Spring-time: So that having very great
Families, they are forced to Lodge them in some Neighbouring
Houses, which they hire on purpose for them.</P>
<P>You must not wonder, Dear Cosen, that they have so many
Domesticks: There are two Reasons for it. The first is, that
both for Food and Wages the <HI>Spaniards</HI> give but two <HI>Rials</HI> a
day, which is not above Six pence of our Money. I say the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> do this, for Strangers pay after the rate of four <HI>Rials,</HI>
which is about Twelve pence of our Money. Neither do the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> give to their Gentlemen above Fifteen Crowns a
Month, with which they must wear Velvet in Winter, and Taf∣fety
in Summer: But then they live only upon Onions, Pease,
and such mean stuff, and this makes the Pages and Footmen as
greedy as Doggs. But I should speak of the other Domesticks as
well as the Pages, for in this matter they are all alike, let them
have what Wages they will. They are kept so very hungry,
that in carrying the Dishes to the Table, they eat half the
Victuals that is in them; they throw it into their Mouth so
burning hot, that you shall observe their Teeth all rotten with
the Practice. I advised my Kinswoman to get a little Silver
Stew-Pan made and fastened with a Padlock, that I saw of
the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Burgos,</HI> and she did so, and now after the
Cook hath filled it, he looks through a little Grate to see whe∣ther
the Soupe does well; and thus the Pages get nothing of
it but the Steam. Before this Invention, it happened a hun∣dred
times, that when we thought to have taken up some
Broth, we found neither that, nor any Flesh; for you must
know that if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Temperate, 'tis when the Ex∣pence
is their own; they are not so, when they eat at another's
cost. I have seen Persons of the Highest Quality eat with us
like so many Wol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, they were so hungry: They were sensi∣ble
enough of it themselves, and prayed us not to wonder at it,
for they found the <HI>Ragoas</HI> after the <HI>French</HI> way, so excellent,
that they could not forbear.</P>
<P>There are Cooks-shops almost at every corner of a Street:
These have great Kettles set upon Trevets. There folks may
have such ordinary things as Beans, Garlick, Leeks, or a little
Broth, in which they steep their Bread. The Gentlemen and
Waiting-women go thither as other People, for at home they
only dress Victuals for the Master and Mistriss, and their Chil∣dren.
They are strangely Temperate in Wine; the Women
never drink any, and the Men so little, that a quarter of a Pint
will serve one a whole day. You cannot affront a Man worse,
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>
than to call him a <HI>Drunkard.</HI> Here's indeed, a great many
things to make up the first Reason why they keep so many Ser∣vants.
Now follows the second.</P>
<P>When a great Man dies, if he had a hundred Servants, his
Son keeps all he found in the House, without putting one away:
When the Mother happens to dye, either her own Daughter
or her Daughter-in-law takes into her Service all the Women-Servants,
and this Custom holds to the fourth Generation, for
they are never turned away. They are put, as I have told you,
into neighbouring Houses, and have their <HI>Ration,</HI> or Allowan∣ces.
They come often to their Master or Mistresses House, but
'tis rather to shew they are not dead, than to do any Service.
I was to see the Dutchess of <HI>Ossona,</HI> which is a very great Lady,
and I was amazed to see so many Chambermaids and Women,
for every Room was full of them. I askt her how many she
had? She told me, she had now only 300, but that very lately
she had 500 more. If particular Persons have this Custom of
keeping of so many Servants, the <HI>King</HI> must needs keep abun∣dance
more, which without doubt is very chargeable to him,
and must hurt his Affairs. I have been told that in <HI>Madrid</HI> only,
if the Pensions which he gives are reckoned, he gives <HI>Ration</HI> or
Allowances to above Ten Thousand Persons.</P>
<P>As to the Kings House, the Provision for it is daily brought
in, and it is regulated according to the Quality of the Persons.
There is distributed both tame and wild Fowl, Fish, Chocolate,
Fruit, Ice, Charcoal, Wax-Candles, Oyl, Bread, and in a word,
every thing that is necessary for Life.</P>
<P><HI>Embassadours</HI> have their certain Expences, and so have some
<HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> There are Persons appointed to Sell at their
Houses whatever I have just now named, and that without pay∣ing
any Custom or Excise: And this saves them a great deal of
Money, for the Duties upon all sorts of Goods and Wares are
excessive high.</P>
<P>None but Embassadours and Strangers are allowed to have a
great many Footmen and Pages to follow them: For by the
<HI>Pragmatic</HI> (by which name they call all their Edicts of Re∣formation,
they are forbidden to have any more than two Foot∣men
to follow.) It is somewhat strange, that they who keep
four or five hundred Persons, may not be allowed above three
to accompany them. This third, you must know, is a Groom,
which goes on foot, and keeps near the Horses, to hinder them
from putting and intangling their Leggs in their long Traces,
and he does not wear a Sword as the Footmen do: And I must
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
needs say, that if Age is a recommendable Quality, these three
Men have that in a good degree. I have seen Footmen of Fif∣ty
Years of Age, and never any under Thirty. They are very
unpleasant to look at, being very tawny, and of a Clownish As∣pect:
They cut their Hair close on the top of their heads, only
let a Round be a little long, but very greasie, and seldom comb∣ed.
The Hair they cut on the top of their heads, is done in
the shape of a Wild Boar's Head. They wear long Swords,
with Shoulder-Belts and Cloaks. They are all cloathed either
in Blew or Green, and often their green Cloth Cloaks are lined
with blew Velvet cut in Flowers, their Sleeves are either of
Velvet, Sattin, or Damask. One would think that
these should be handsome Liveries, but yet I assure you, nothing
is uglier, and their ill Looks disparage their Cloaths. They
wear Bands, but without any Collar, which is ridiculous. And
upon their Coaches they have neither Galloons, nor tufted But∣tons
and Loops, nor any sort of Lace or Trimming.</P>
<P>Their Gentlemen and their Pages always go in a Coach that
follows; these wear black Cloaths in all Seasons. In Winter
they wear Velvet, with Cloth Cloaks very long, but when they
Mourn, they draw upon the ground. Although they are Pages,
they wear no Swords, only most of them have a little Poniard
hid under their Cloaths. In Summer they wear either Damask
or Taffety, with Cloaks of a black Stuff very light.</P>
<P>It is only the great <HI>Lords,</HI> and the <HI>Titulado's,</HI> or Men of
<HI>Title,</HI> which are permitted to have four Mules to their Coaches
with those long Traces in the City. If any Person, without
the distinction of some Character, let him be as Rich as he will,
should appear in the same Equipage, he would be affronted
and abused in the open Street, his Traces would be cut, and
himself Fined very high. Here it is not enough to be Rich, a
Man must also be of some Quality. The <HI>King</HI> only, can have
six Mules to his own Coach, and to those of his Attendants;
which Coaches are not like others, and are distinguished by this,
that they are covered with green Oyl-Cloth round, as well as on
the top, just as the Stage-Coaches in <HI>France,</HI> except that they
are not of Wickers, but the carved Work is very coarse, and
ill done, and they have falling Boots, and all is very ugly, and
one would wonder how so great a <HI>King</HI> can make use of them.
But I have been told, that these fashioned Coaches were in use
in <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth times, that his were just like them; and
that it is in imitation of so great an <HI>Emperour,</HI> that all the
<HI>Kings</HI> which have Reigned since, will have no other. Without
<PB N="136" REF="139"/>
doubt there must be some such great Reason; for notwithstand∣ing
this, the <HI>King</HI> has as fine Coaches as any are in the World,
some made in <HI>France,</HI> and others in <HI>Italy,</HI> and other Parts. The
great Persons have also very stately ones; but after the <HI>Kings</HI>
Example, they do not use them four times a Year. All Coach∣es
are kept in large Courts, in which there are several Partitions
enclosed. There are it may be to the number of two hundred
in one Yard, and there are several of these Yards or Courts in
divers parts of the City. The Reason why they set them a∣broad
is, because they have no room for them at home, their
Houses being built, as I have already said, without Courts or
great Gates, Of late, they begin to alter their Fashion, and
use Horses instead of mules. And to be just, these Horses are
extream beautiful, there is nothing wanting to them, and it
would be difficult for the best Painters to draw any in greater
Perfection. But 'tis a piece of Cruelty to make them draw such
huge Coaches, which are almost as heavy as a House; besides
the Streets are so very ill paved, that their Feet are quite spoy∣led
in two Years time. They cost very dear, and are not big
enough for their Coaches. But I have seen some draw their
pretty little <HI>Calashes,</HI> which were all painted and gilt, like those
which are made in <HI>Holland,</HI> and nothing looked more pleasant,
and by their swift running, and handsome carrying of their
Heads, you would take them for Stags. As soon as you are
out of Town you may put six Horses to your Coach. Their Har∣ness
is very neat, and they trim their Manes, which hang to
the ground, with Ribbons of divers colours; and sometimes
they dress up their Manes with a great many puffs of Silver
Gauze, which makes a very pretty shew. The Harness for their
Mules, are made of Leather, flat and broad, with which they
cover them almost all over.</P>
<P>Two days ago I went with my Kinswoman to walk without
St. <HI>Barnardine</HI>'s Gate. 'Tis a place they frequent in Winter.
<HI>Don Antonio</HI> of <HI>Toledo,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> was there,
with the Duke of <HI>Vzeda,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Altamire.</HI> He had
a Harness for his Horses of an <HI>Isabella</HI> colour, which so pleased
me, that I could not forbear speaking to him of it when his
Coach came near ours. According to Custom, he told me, that
he laid them all at my Feet, and at Night when we got home,
I was told, that his Gentleman desired to speak with me. He
made me a Complement, and told me, that his Master's six
Horses were in my Stable. My Kinswoman fell a laughing, and
made Answer for me, that I was so lately arrived at <HI>Madrid,</HI>
that I did not yet understand, that one must not praise any
<PB N="137" REF="140"/>
thing which belonged to so generous a <HI>Cavaliero</HI> as <HI>Don Antonia,</HI>
but however, 'twas not the Fashion to receive Presents of so
great value, and desired him to take them back again. But this
he would not do, we sent them back immediately, he return∣ed
them, and so did we. To be short, the whole Evening past
thus in sending backwards and forwards; and at last we were
forced to write him a Letter, and give our selves a great deal
of Trouble to perswade him not to take it ill, that I would not
accept them.</P>
<P>I am told, that after the <HI>King</HI> has once made use of a <HI>Horse,</HI>
in Respect to him, no body afterwards will ride on him. It
happened, that the Duke of <HI>Medina de las Torres</HI> had bought a
Horse worth Five and Twenty Thousand Crowns, he was the
handsomest and the bravest which was ever seen. He caused
his Picture to be taken. <HI>King Philip</HI> the Fourth saw it, and had
a mind to see the Horse. The <HI>Duke</HI> begged him to accept of
him, but he refused him, and gave this Reason, that as he
should seldom ride on him, and that no body would make use
of him after he had mounted him, so the strength and useful∣ness
of the Horse would be lost.</P>
<P>It is usual here for good Families to put their younger
Daughters to <HI>Ladies;</HI> by whom they are employed for the most
part to Embroider in Gold and Silver, or in Silk of various co∣lours,
about their Shift-Necks or Hands: But if they are left to
follow their own Natural Inclination, they work very little, and
talk much. They keep also both Male and Female Dwarfs,
and very ugly ones: The Females particularly have very fright∣ful
looks, their Heads are bigger than their Bodies; they always
wear their Hair loose about t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir Ears, and hanging down to
the ground: At first sight, one would wonder what these little
Figures were when they present themselves before ones Eyes.
They wear Rich Cloaths; they are their Mistresses Confidents,
and for this Reason, they are denyed nothing they have a mind
to.</P>
<P>In every House at a certain stated hour, all the Women meet
with the Mistress of the Family in the Chappel, there to re∣peat
their <HI>Rosary</HI> aloud; they make use of no Book to say their
Prayers by; indeed it is very seldom they have any. The
Count of <HI>Charny,</HI> who is a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> very handsom, and of
great worth, and is the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s General of his Horse in
<HI>Catalonia,</HI> told me, that the other day being at <HI>Mass,</HI> and as
he was saying his Prayers by his Book, an Old <HI>Spanish</HI> Woman
came and snatched it from him, and with great indignation
threw it to the ground, saying to him, <HI>Let this alone, and make
<PB N="138" REF="141"/>
use of your Beads.</HI> It is a strange thing to consider how conti∣nually
fond they are of their <HI>Beads,</HI> every Woman there has a
pair fastned to her Girdle, and so long, that they almost touch
the ground. They are perpetually without ceasing using them,
in the Street, as they play at <HI>Ombre,</HI> as they Discourse, nay,
when they are making Love, when they are telling Lies, or
speaking evil of their Neighbours. They are continually mut∣tering
over their <HI>Beads,</HI> let them be in never so much Compa∣ny,
nothing of this hinders them still to keep on their pace.
I leave you to judge what Devotion there can be in this, but
Custom has a great Power in this Country.</P>
<P>Till of late, Women wore Vertingales of a prodigious big∣ness,
this Fashion was very troublesome to themselves as well as
others. There were hardly any doors wide enough for them
to go through: But they have left them off now, and only wear
them when they go to appear in the Queen's or the King's
Presence: Commonly in the City they wear a certain sort of
Vestment, which to speak properly, is a <HI>young or little Vertin∣gale.</HI>
They are made of thick Copper Wyre in a round form,
about the Girdle, there are Ribbons fastned to them, with
which they tye another round of the same form, which falls
down a little lower, and which is wider; and of these they
have five or six rounds which reach down to the ground, and
bear out their Petticoats and other Garments. They wear a
vast number of this Device; and one would hardly believe that
so little Creatures as the <HI>Spanish</HI> Women are, could bear such a
load. Their upper Garment is always of a cosrse black Taffety,
or of a grey plain Stuff made of Goats-hair, with a Trass or
Fardle coming down a little above the Kneees, and round the
upper Garments; and if you ask them to what end this serves?
they'll answer you, that with this they can make it longer as it
wears out. The <HI>Queen-Mother,</HI> as well as others, use this to
all her Garments. Even the <HI>Carmelites</HI> wear them in <HI>France</HI> as
well as in <HI>Spain.</HI> But as to Women, it is rather a Fashion
which they follow, than any Frugality; for they are neither
Covetous nor good Housewifes, and of these things, they have
two or three new ones a Week. These upper Garments are
so long before and on the sides, that they draw a great deal
upon the ground, but behind, they do not draw at all. Though
they wear them down so low, yet they will tread upon them,
that their Feet may not be seen, which are the parts they most
industriously hide. I have heard say, that after a Lady has
Obliged her Gallant by all possible Civilities and Compliance, to
confirm to him her Kindness, she will shew him her foot; and
<PB N="139" REF="142"/>
this here, they call the highest Favour; one must needs own,
that in its kind, there is nothing prettier. As I have already
told you their Feet are so small, that their Shooes look like
those of our Babies. They are made of black <HI>Spanish</HI> Leather,
cut upon coloured Taffety, without Heels, and as strait as a
Glove. When they go, you would think they flew; we should
not in a hundred Years learn their way of walking, they keep
their Elbows close to their sides, and go without raising their
Feet just as one slides. But to return to their Habit; under
this plain upper Garment, they have a dozen more, one finer,
than another, of rich Stuffs, and trimed with Galloons and Lace
of Gold and Silver, to the Girdle. That I have told you a
dozen, pray do not think that I exceed the Truth: During the
excessive Heats of the Summer, they only wear seven or eight, of
which some are of Velvet, and others of thick Sattin. They
wear at all times a white Garment under all the rest, which
they call <HI>Sabengua;</HI> it is made either of the fine <HI>English</HI> Lace,
or of Muslin embroidered with Gold, and so wide, that they are
four Ells in compass. I have seen of these worth five or six
hundred Crowns. At home they wear neither the little Vertin∣gale
nor Patens, these last are a sort of little Sandal, made of
Brocado or Velvet, set upon Plates of Gold, which raise them
half a Foot, and when they have these, they walk very ill, and
are apt to fall. They use but very little Whale-bone in their
Stays, the midst of which are a third part of an Ell. One can
hardly see in other Countries Women so slender. They shape
their Bodies before pretty high, but behind, you may see them
to the middle of the back, they are so naked, and yet this is
no Charming sight, for they are all dreadful lean, though they
would be very sorry to be fat. And this is a great Error among
them. Besides, they are very swarthy; so that this brown
Skin which is glewed to their backs, must necessarily be dis∣pleasing
to those who are not used to it. They put <HI>Red</HI> upon
their Shoulders, which are all naked, as well as on their
Cheecks. Neither do they want there for <HI>White,</HI> which is very
good, but there are few which know how to use it; at first sight
you can discern it. I have seen some of a very clear Com∣plexion
that was Natural. Most of them have very fine and
exact Features; in their Looks and all their Actions you may
see a little affectation of being Courted, which their Humour
does not dissemble. It's reckoned beautiful among them to have
no Breasts, and they take care very early to hinder them from
growing big. As soon as they begin to appear, they bind thin
pieces of Lead upon them, as close as one would swaddle a Child.
<PB N="140" REF="143"/>
And indeed their Breasts are as flat and even as a sheet of Pa∣per,
except the holes and hollowness, which their leanness cau∣ses,
and those are pretty many. Their hands have no defect,
they are little, white, and well shaped. Their large Sleeves, which
they fasten at the bottom of their wrists, still contribute to make
them appear less. These Sleeves are made of Taffety of all co∣lours,
like those of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> with Ruffles of broad Lace.
Their Stays are commonly of Gold and Silver Stuffs, mixed
with lively colours; the Sleeves of them are very strait, and
their Silk Sleeves appear instead of their Shifts. Nevertheless,
People of Quality wear very fine Linnen; but all others wear
little or none. It is scarce and dear, besides, the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have that foolish Vanity to desire it very fine; insomuch that
they had rather have but one such Shift than half a dozen a lit∣tle
coarse; and either lie in Bed till 'tis washed, or else dress
themselves without any, which they frequently enough do. They
use this fine Linnen after an ill manner when they wash it; for
the Women lay it upon rough Stones, and so beat it hard with
a stick, by which means, there shall be a hundred holes in't im∣mediately.
There's no difference between the best and the
worst Landress; all these Creatures are very aukward.</P>
<P>But to return to the Womens Cloaths, which I have often left,
that I might give an Account of several things which occurred
to me. I must tell you, that they wear about their Necks Bone∣lace,
embroidered over either with red or green Silk, or Gold
or Silver. They wear Girdles all of Medals and Reliques. There
are divers <HI>Churches</HI> which have not so many; they wear also the
Cord of some <HI>Order,</HI> either of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> or
some other. It is a small Cord, made either of black, white,
or brown Wool, and is worn on the out-side of their Stays, and
hangs down before to the edge of their Petticoats. They are
full of knots, and commonly upon every knot there's a Dia∣mond-stone
fastned. They make Vows to some Saint or other
to wear their Cords; but if the reason of these Vows was enqui∣red
into, it would not be found very good.</P>
<P>They have great store of <HI>Jewels,</HI> the finest that can be seen.
Neither is it enough to have one Sett of <HI>Jewels,</HI> as our Ladies
in <HI>France</HI> have, but these must have Eight or Ten; some of
<HI>Diamonds,</HI> others of <HI>Rubies, Emeralds, Pearls, Turkey-stones;</HI>
and in short, of all sorts. But the work-men set them very
ill, for the greatest part of the <HI>Diamond</HI> is hid, very little of
it is seen. I asked the reason of it, and they told me, that to
them, the Gold looked as well as the Stones. But I am of
<PB N="141" REF="144"/>
Opinion, that their Lapidaries do not understand how to set
them better. I must except <HI>Verbec,</HI> who can do them well if
he will take the pains.</P>
<P>The Ladies wear at the top of their Stays a broad knot of
<HI>Diamonds,</HI> from whence there hangs a Chain of <HI>Pearl,</HI> or ten
or twelve knots of <HI>Diamonds,</HI> which they fasten at the other
end, to their sides. They never wear any Necklace, but they
wear Bracelets, Rings, and Pendants; which last are longer
than ones Hand, and so heavy, that I have wonder'd how they
could carry them without tearing out the hole of their Ears.
To which they add whatever they think pretty. I have seen
some have good large Watches hanging there, other Padlocks
of Precious Stones, and even your fine wrought <HI>English</HI> Keys,
and little Bells. They also carry upon their Sleeves, their Shoul∣ders,
and all about their Bodies. <HI>Agnus Dei</HI>'s, and little Images.
They have their Heads stuck full of Bodkins, some made of
Diamonds in the shape of a Flye, and others like Butterflies,
whose colours are distinguished by various Stones. They dress
their Heads after several Fashions, but still they must be naked;
they part their Hair on the sides of their Heads, and lay it cross
on their foreheads; it shines so, that without lying, one may
see themselves in it. Formerly they wore a Tress or Lock of
Hair, the worst made that one should see, and this fell all spread
upon their Shoulders, lest their own Hair should mix with it,
which indeed is very fine. They have usually five-broidered
Rolls, to which they fasten Knots of Ribbons, or else Pearls,
and these they tye altogether to their Girdles, and in Summer
when they are at home, they wrap them up in a piece of co∣lour'd
Taffety, trim'd with Thred Bonelace. They never wear
any sort of Coif, either Night or Day. I have seen some which
had their Heads drest up with Feathers like little Children:
These Feathers are very curious, and spotted with different
colours, which made them much more beautiful. I cannot
imagine, why they do not make such in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The young Women, or new marry'd, have very Rich Cloaths,
and their upper Garments are coloured and embroidered with
Gold. I was to see the Princess of <HI>Monteleon:</HI> She's a little
Body not above Thirteen Years old, and she is lately marry'd
to her Cousin-German, named <HI>Don Nicholas Pignatelli;</HI> her
Mother is the Daughter of the Dutchess of <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> nomi∣nated
to be <HI>Camarera major,</HI> or first Maid of Honour to the
new Queen. These, that is to say, the Dutchess of <HI>Terra No∣va,
D'Hijar</HI> and <HI>Monteleon,</HI> which the Young Princess of the
same Name, and her little Sisters, dwell all altogether. The Dut∣chess
<PB N="142" REF="145"/>
of <HI>Terra Nova</HI> may be about Threescore Years old; my
Kinswoman is one of her intimate Friends, and she receiv'd us
with such Civility and Kindness as is not usual with her: For
it may be, there is not in the World a more haughty Spirit,
which her very looks declare. Her voice is harsh, she speaks
little, and would be thought of a kind and good Nature; but
if what is said, be true, she is not really so: One shall hardly
meet with a greater share of Wit, and a more piercing Judg∣ment,
than she has; she discoursed to us much of the Place she
was going to take upon her in the Queen's House. Says she,
I'll neglect nothing to make my self acceptable to her, I'll en∣deavour
to discover every thing that may please her; I am sen∣sible
that a young Princess born in <HI>France,</HI> must be allowed
a greater Liberty than an <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> born at <HI>Madrid.</HI>
So that by me, she shall not be able to find any difference be∣twixt
this and her own Country. She presented me with a pair
of Beads of <HI>Paulo d' Aguila,</HI> which is a curious sort of Wood
that comes from the <HI>Indies.</HI> Really they are so long, that when
I hold them in my hands they reacht to the ground. They are
trim'd with two bunches of small green Taffety Ribbon, each
bunch has about three hundred Ells in it. She gave me also
some <HI>Pucatos</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> which are Pots and Dishes made of
that Medicinal Earth, and are adorn'd with Filigrane Work:
And she presented me likewise with several other pretty Toys▪</P>
<P>One can hardly see any thing that looks more splendid than
this House of theirs; they use the upper Apartments, which are
hung with Tapistry all done with rais'd Work of Gold. In one
great Chamber, which is longer than 'tis broad, you may see
several Glass doors which go into Closets or little Cells. The
first of which is the Dutchess of <HI>Terra Nova</HI>' s hung with grey,
and a Bed of the same, and all other things very plain. On
one side lodges her Daughter, the Dutchess of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> who
is a Widow, and has her Room furnish'd like her Mother's.
Afterwards you come to the Princess of <HI>Monteleon</HI>'s Chamber,
which is not larger than the others, but her Bed is of Gold and
green Damask, lin'd with Silver Brocade, and trim'd with Point
<HI>De Spain.</HI> The Sheets were lac'd about with an <HI>English</HI> Lace
of half an Ell deep. Over against it were the Chambers of
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nteleon</HI> and <HI>Hijar</HI>'s Children, which were Furnish'd with white
D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mask. Next to these is the little Chamber of the Dutchess
<HI>Ai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r,</HI> Furnish'd with Crimson-colour'd Velvet upon a Gold
Ground. Their Rooms were no otherwise divided than by
Partitions of a certain Sweet Wood; and they told me, that
six of their Women lay in their Chambers, upon Beds brought
thither at Night.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="146"/>
The Ladies were in a great Gallery, spread with a very rich
Foot-cloth; there were set round it Crimson-colour'd Velvet
Cushions embroidred with Gold, and they are longer than they
are broad: There were also several great Cabinets in-laid, and a∣dorn'd
with Precious Stones, but they are not made in <HI>Spain;</HI>
and between them were Tables of Silver, and admirable Look∣ing-Glasses,
both for their largeness and rich Frames, the worst
of which were of Silver. But that which I thought finest,
were their <HI>Escaparates,</HI> which is a certain sort of a close Cabinet
with one great Glass, and fill'd with all the Rarities which one
can imagine, whether it be in <HI>Amber-grease, Porceline, Crystal,
Bezoar-stone, Branches of Coral, Mother of Pearl, Fillagran in
Gold,</HI> and a thousand other things of Value. There I saw a
Fish, and upon its Head there was a little Tree; it was neither
of Wood nor of Moss; it grew on the top of the Fish's Scull,
which is very small. This seem'd to me a great Curiosity.</P>
<P>We were above threescore Women in this Gallery, and not
so much as one Man among us. They all sat down upon the
Floor cross-legg'd. This is an Old Custom, which they have
deriv'd from the <HI>Moors.</HI> There was only one great Elbow-Chair
of <HI>Spanish</HI> Leather stitch'd with Silk, and very ugly. I
ask'd for whom it was design'd? They told me it was for the
Prince of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> who came not in till after all the Ladies
were retir'd. I could not long sit after this Fashion, and there∣fore
I got some Cushions under me, five or six of which were
fastued together by a Silver Brace full of Olive-stones, that it
might not break through. When any Lady comes to Visit, the
<HI>He</HI> or <HI>She-Dwarf</HI> comes to gives notice, by kneeling down up∣on
one Knee, upon which all the Company rises, and the young
<HI>Princess</HI> walks before as far as the Door to receive her which
comes to see her after her Marriage. In Saluting each other,
they do not kiss, perhaps, that is, because they will not rub off
the colour from one anothers Faces; but they shake hands with
their Gloves off, and in Discourse, they say <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee;</HI> and
without calling one another either, <HI>Madam,</HI> or <HI>Lady,</HI> or <HI>High∣ness,</HI>
or <HI>Excellency,</HI> they only say, <HI>Donna Maria, Donna Clara,</HI> or
<HI>Donna Theresa.</HI> I was willing to know the reason of this Familiar
way, and I learnt it was to avoid all occasion of Offence a∣mongst
them; and that as there were different ways of speaking
to distinguish the great difference of Quality and Degree, and
that it was not easie to observe all the Rules about them, with∣out
sometimes giving distaste; therefore to prevent which,
they have chosen to speak to each other without any Ceremo∣ny
at all. I must also add, that the Women here do not in∣termix,
<PB N="144" REF="147"/>
and so these are always Persons of Quality together.
The Wives of the Long Robe never so much as to go to visit the
Court-Ladies, and a Man of Birth never marries with a Wo∣man
of Quality: Here one never sees those which are not
Gentlemen mix with the Nobility, as in <HI>France;</HI> so that there
can be little danger, as long as they associate together. If
there comes in a hundred Ladies one after another, every one
rises up as o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten, and they go, as in Procession, as far as the
Anti-Chamber to receive them. I was so tyr'd that day, that
I was in a very ill Humour.</P>
<P>They were all very well dress'd; and as I have already told
you, they have very rich Cloaths, and their Jewels are extream
fine. There were two Tables for the Game of <HI>Ombro,</HI> at which
they play'd very high, and without any Noise. I could not un∣derstand
their Cards; they are as thin as Paper, and painted
after a quite different way from ours. One of those Cards look
as if one held a Letter; when they have a good Game in hand,
it were easie for a Cheating Gamester to discover several of
their Cards, if not the whole Game.</P>
<P>While they play'd, they discours'd of News, of the Court
and the City: Their Conversation is free and pleasant, and it must
needs be confess'd, that they have a certain quickness of Wit,
which we cannot come up to. They are very kind and friend∣ly,
they love to praise, and do it after a gentile way, very in∣geniously,
and with great Judgment. I am amaz'd to find such
strength of Memory joyn'd with so great a degree of Wit and
Understanding. They are compassionate, even almost to a
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t. They read little and write not much; but yet by that
little which they do read, they improve much, and that little
they write is both exact and concise.</P>
<P>Their Features are very regular and delicate; but their ex∣cessive
leanness offends one that is not us'd to it. They are of
a brown Complexion, and their faces very smooth: The Small-Pox
must needs not do them so much hurt here, as in other
Countries, for I have seldom seen any mark'd with them.</P>
<P>Their Hair is a black as Jett, and very shining, notwithstan∣ding
there is cause to think that they comb long with one and
the same Comb, for t'other day I saw at the Marchioness of <HI>Al∣con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>zas</HI>
(who is Sister to the Constable of <HI>Castille,</HI> and whose
first Husband was the Count and Duke of <HI>Olivares</HI>) her Toylet
spread; and although she is one of the neatest and richest La∣dies,
and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was laid upon a little Silver Table, yet it
was only <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a little bit of Callico, a Looking-Glass
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bigger <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ones Hand, two Combs, and a little Box, and
<PB N="145" REF="148"/>
in a small <HI>China</HI> Cup some White of an Egg beat together with
Sugar-candy. I ask'd one of her Women what she did with
this; she told me, this was to take the dirt off her Face, and to
make it shine. I have seen some whose Faces were so bright,
that you would wonder. One would think that they were Var∣nish'd
over; and the Skin is so pull'd and rub'd, that I am con∣fident
it does a great deal of hurt. Most of the Women make
themselves Eye-brows, and they have only as 'twere a little
thred of Hair, which in my mind looks very ugly; but that
which is yet worse, is they comb the middle of their Fore∣heads
so much till they make their Eye-brows meet; and this
with them is extream Beautiful.</P>
<P>But yet there are a great many whose Fancies do not lye
this way, I have seen some <HI>Spanish</HI> Women more exact to the
Rules of Beauty than our <HI>French</HI> Women, notwithstanding their
way of dressing cross-wise, and the little advantage which they
give to their Faces. One may say, that they are like things
made out of Rule, for they have neither Hair, nor Cornet, nor
any Ribbon, to set them o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f; and yet, what Country can shew
such Eyes as theirs? They are so very sprightly, and declare
so much Wit, and by them, talk to one in a Language so kind
and intelligible, that if they had no other Charms, these alone
would make them pass for handsome Women, and unavoidably
steal away ones Affections. Their Teeth are very even, and
would be white enough, if they took a little care of them, but
they neglect them; and besides, their frequent use of <HI>Sugar</HI>
and <HI>Chocolate</HI> does them much hurt. They have all a bad Cu∣stom
here, the Women as well as the Men, which is to pick
their Teeth, let them be in what Company they will: This
they reckon as a Diversion▪ and do it with grave looks. They
do not so much as know what belongs to having them cleans'd
by an Artist, there is no such Trade there, and when they need
them to be drawn out, they get the Surgeons to do it, if they
can.</P>
<P>At my first coming in to Visit the <HI>Princess</HI> of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> I
was surpriz'd to see so many young Ladies with great Specta∣cles
on their Noses, and fastned to their Ears; but that which
yet seem'd strangest to me, was, that they made no use of them
where it was necessary: They only discours'd while they had
them on; I was disturb'd at it, and ask'd the Marchioness <HI>De la
Rosa</HI> (with whom I have contracted a dear Friendship) the rea∣son
of it: She's a pretty sort of Woman, and understands how
to live. She has a neat Wit, and is a <HI>Neapolitan.</HI> She fell a
<PB N="146" REF="149"/>
Laughing at my Question, and told me, that it was done to
make them look grave, that they did not wear them for any
need, but to draw Respect. Do you see that Lady, says she to
me? meaning one that was near us, I do not believe, that since
she was ten Years Old, she ever left them off, but when she
went to Bed. Without lying, they both eat with them, and
in the Streets and Assemblies you can never fail of meeting a∣bundance
of Men and Women with their Spectacles. Upon
this Occasion, I must needs tell you, continued she, that some
time ago, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Friars had a Suit in Law of high Im∣portance;
the success of which they were too much concerned
for, to neglect any means. One of the Young <HI>Fathers</HI> of the
Convent had some Kindred of the greatest Quality, which upon
his Account did sollicit very hard on their behalf. The <HI>Prior</HI>
assur'd him, that if through his Credit and Interest they should
get the better of the Suit, he could ask nothing that should not
be granted him for an Acknowledgment: At last, they gain'd
their Point, and the Young Father, transported with Joy, im∣mediately
ran to tell the News, and at the same time prepar'd
himself to ask a Favour which a long time he had had a migh∣ty
desire to obtain. But the <HI>Prior,</HI> after having embrac'd him,
with grave looks and tone, said to him, <HI>Hermano, ponga las
Ojalas,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Brother, Put on Spectacles.</HI> The Honour
of this Permission filled the Young Monk with a strange Joy;
he thought himself and his care too highly recompensed, and
had nothing else to ask. The Marquess of <HI>Astorgas,</HI> Vice-Roy
of <HI>Naples,</HI> added she, had his Statue to the middle cut in
Marble, upon which he was very careful to cause his best
Spectacles to be put. It is so common a thing to wear them,
that I have heard, there are different Spectacles, according to
the different Qualities and Degrees of Men and Women. Pro∣portionably
as a Man's Fortune rises, he increases in the large∣ness
of his Spectacle-Glasses and wears them higher upon his
Nose. The <HI>Grandees of Spain</HI> wear them as broad as one Hands,
which for distinction, they call <HI>Ocales.</HI> They fasten them be∣hind
their Ears, and leave them off as seldom as they do their
Collars. Heretofore they had the Glasses of them from <HI>Venice,</HI>
but ever since their Enterprize of the Marquess of <HI>Cueva,</HI> which
was called the <HI>Triumvirat,</HI> because they were three Persons who
undertook to fire <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Arsenal of <HI>Venice</HI> with Burning-Glasses,
and by this means to make the King of <HI>Spain</HI> Master of that
City: The <HI>Venetians,</HI> to be reveng'd, caus'd a vast number of
those <HI>Ocales</HI> to be made, and sent to their Embassador at <HI>Ma∣drid.</HI>
He presented of them to the whole Court, and all that
<PB N="147" REF="150"/>
us'd them were almost blinded with them; for they were made
of burning Glass, and very artificially done, and set in certain
Frames made of combustible Matter, which with the least Rays
of the Sun would put all in a Flame. It happen'd upon a
Council-day, that in the Room where they sat, one of the
Windows was left open, and the Sun shining perpendicularly
upon their Spectacles, all on a sudden they perceiv'd a dange∣rous
sort of fire contriv'd against their Eye-brows and Hair;
one can hardly imagine what a Fright these venerable old Men
were in. I could wish, said I to the <HI>Marchioness,</HI> that this sto∣ry
were credible, for 'tis very pleasant. As I did not see it, re∣ply'd
she in smiling, so I cannot positively assure you that 'tis
true: But the bus'ness of the <HI>Jacobite Friars</HI> which I have rela∣ted
to you, I had from the best Authority. I have since, ob∣serv'd
several Persons of Quality in their Coaches, sometimes
alone, and sometimes in Company, with these great Spectacles
hung upon their Noses, which in my Mind, is a strange sight.</P>
<P>This Princess gave us a Collation, her Women, to the num∣ber
of eighteen, brought every one of them a great Silver Ba∣son
full of dry Sweet-meats, wrapt up in a Paper, for that pur∣pose
cut and guilt. In one, there was a Plum, in another a
Cherry or an Apricock, and so in all the rest accordingly.
This to me seem'd very neat, for by this way, one might either
eat or carry away, without soyling the Fingers or Pockets.
There were some ancient Ladies, who after they had eat of
these Sweet-meats till they were ready to burst, fill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d five or six
Hankerchiefs full, and they bring them on purpose; and al∣though
they are well observ'd, yet no notice seems to be taken,
but they are suffer'd to take as much and as oft as they will;
they tye these Handkerchiefs with strings quite round their lit∣tle
Vertingales: This is like the hook which is us'd in a Pan∣try,
upon which is hung all sorts of Flesh and Fowl. After∣wards
they present you with Chocolate, every one a China Cup
full upon a little Dish of Agat set in Gold, with sugar in a
Box of the same. There was some Chocolate order'd with Ice,
and some hot, and some made with Milk and Eggs: One drinks
it with some Bisket, or else with some thin bread as hard as if
it were toasted, which they make so on purpose. There are
some Women which will drink six Cups one after another, and
this they do very often, twice or thrice a day. One should not
wonder that they are so dry, since nothing is hotter than this
Liquor; and besides, they eat every thing so very high sea∣son'd
with Pepper and Spice, that one would think it impossible
they are not burnt up: There were several also, which eat
<PB N="148" REF="151"/>
great pieces of the Medicinal Earth. I have already told you
that they have even a great passion for this Earth, which fre∣quently
causes in them great Obstructions; their Stomachs and
their Bellies will be swelled with it, and become as hard as a
Stone, and they themselves as yellow as Saffron. I had a mind
to taste this <HI>Ragoue,</HI> which is so much esteem'd beyond its
worth, but I declare I had rather eat a piece of a Stone.</P>
<P>If one had a mind to oblige them, one must treat them with
such kind of things which they call <HI>Barros;</HI> and very often
their Confessors enjoyn them to no other <HI>Pennance,</HI> than to for∣bear
one whole day from eating thereof. It is said to have a
great many Properties; and is good against Poyson, and cures
abundance of Diseases. I have a great Cup made of it, which
holds a pint; it spoils Wine that's put into it, but it makes
Water excellent, which seems as if it boyl'd in it, at least one
may observe it to work and fret, if it is proper to say so; and
if one leaves it a little while, the Cup shall be quite empty, the
nature of the Earth makes it so full of Pores; it has a strong
sent. We drank Water there, which was very well order'd;
one may truly say, that in no place they drink it cooler: They
make use only of Snow, and are of Opinion that it cools much
better than Ice; It is the custom here to drink very cold water
before they take their Chocolate, which otherwise they think
would be unwholsome.</P>
<P>After the Collation was ended, Flamboys were brought in;
there came in first a little simple Fellow, white with Age, who
was Governour of the Pages: He had a great Gold Chain and
a Medal about his Neck; this was the present he had at the
Prince of <HI>Monteleon</HI>'s Marriage: He kneel'd down upon one Knee
in the middle of the Gallery, and aloud, said, <HI>Let the most Holy
Sacrament be prais'd;</HI> to which every body answer'd, <HI>For ever:</HI>
This is their Custom, when Light is brought in. Next came
in four and twenty Pages following two by two, and in the
same manner kneel'd upon one Knee; every one of them
brought two great Flamboys, or one Branch, and when they
had plac'd them upon the Tables, went out with the same Ce∣remony.
And then all the Ladies made to each other a low
bow, accompany'd with a wish, as when they sneeze. It is fit
I should tell you, that these Branches are full of Lamps fastned
to a Silver Pillar, whose Foot is very broad; there are most
times eight and twelve Pipes to every Lamp, in which the
Week burns, so that this gives a very great Light. And to
encrease it yet more, they fasten a silver Plate to it, in such
manner, that the Light reflects upon it. One is not troubled
<PB N="149" REF="152"/>
with the Smoak, and the Oyl they burn is altogether as good as
that of <HI>Provence,</HI> which is eat with Sallads. I lik'd this fashion
very well. When all the Lights were put in their proper pla∣ces
in the Gallery, the young Princess of <HI>Monteleon</HI> bid her Wo∣men
bring her Wedding-cloaths, that I might see them; they
brought thirty silver Baskets full, which were as deep and as
wide, as Table Baskets; they were so heavy, that there were
four Women to carry one Basket. In them there was, what
ever is possible to be seen that is fine and rich, according to
the fashion of the Country; amongst other things, there were
six of a certain sort of close Coat of Gold and Silver Brocard,
made like Vests to wear in a Morning, with buttons, some of
Diamonds, and others of Emralds, and of these every one had
six dozen. The Linnen and the Lace were not inferiour to the
rest. She shewed me her Jewels also, which were admirable,
but so ill set, that the biggest there made no better a shew than
a Jewel set in <HI>Paris,</HI> which one might buy for thirty <HI>Lew</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I will not write to you often, because I will always have a
stock of News to tell you, which in this place, is pretty long
in picking up. Pardon this tedious Letter, and the little Me∣thod
which I have observ'd in it; I set things down just as
they come into my Mind, and that's ill enough; but in your
Love, dear Cosin, I am safe from all my faults.</P>

<P>I Fear you'll take it ill that I have omitted writing to you one
Post; but dear Cousin, I was willing to be inform'd of di∣vers
things, which I am now going to relate.</P>
<P>And first, I will speak of the Churches of <HI>Madrid,</HI> which I
find extream beautiful and neat: The Women of Quality sel∣dom
go to them, because they all have their Chappels in their
Houses; but there are certain days in the
year, they never fail to be at them, of which
number are all the days in the <HI>Passion-week;</HI>
and there also they make their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Go to receive their Indulgences.</NOTE> <HI>Stations,</HI>
and sometimes go to Confession.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="153"/>
Our Ladies Church of <HI>Atocha,</HI> that is to say, our Lady of the
<HI>Bush,</HI> is indeed a very fine one. It stands within a vast <HI>Con∣vent,</HI>
which is fill'd with <HI>Religious</HI> Women, who seldom or ne∣ver
go out of it, that being one of their Rules they are to ob∣serve.
They lead an austere Life; and from all parts, People
come to pay their Devotion here; and when the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI>
have gain'd any Victories or happy Success, thither they go to
sing <HI>Te Deum.</HI> There you'll see a <HI>Virgin</HI> holding a young <HI>Je∣sus,</HI>
which they report to be miraculous. She's of a black
Complexion, and very often they dress her up like a Widow;
but upon great Festivals she is richly cloathed, and so adorn'd
with Jewels, that nothing can be seen more magnificent. She
hath in a particular manner the Sun drawn round her Head,
whose Beams shine admirably. She always has a vast pair of
Beads either in her Hand, or hung at her Girdle. This Chap∣pel
is on one side of the Body of the Church, and in such a
place, as it would be very dark, were it not that there's con∣tinually
burning above an hundred great Lamps of Gold and
Silver. The King has his Gallery there, whose fore-part is
made up with a Lattice Window. In all their Churches they
make use of Hassocks to kneel on; and when a Person of Qua∣lity,
or a strange Lady comes in, the Sexton spreads a large
Carpet before 'em, upon which he either sets an Oratory with
Cushions, or else he leads 'em to certain little Closets, all painted
and gilt, with Glass-windows round, where one is very conve∣niently
placed. There never fails a Sunday that the Altar is not
illuminated with above an hundred thick Wax Candles. It is
likewise adorn'd with a prodigious quantity of Plate, and so
are all the Churches in <HI>Madrid.</HI> Here are abundance of fine
Walks made of your green Turf; and set full of Flowers, in
which they place a great many Fountains, from whence the
Water falls into Basins, either of Silver, or Marble, or Porphi∣ry
stone. Round about them they plant great numbers of
Orange-Trees, as high as a Man, and these are set in very fine
Boxes; and among these they turn loose several Birds, which
make a pretty sort of Musick. And this as I have described to
you, lasts almost all the year, neither are their Churches ever
without Orange or Jessamin Trees, which perfume them much
better than their Incense.</P>
<P>In the Chappel which they call our Lords of <HI>Almunada,</HI> you
see a <HI>Virgin,</HI> which they tell ye St. <HI>James</HI> brought from <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI>
and hid in a Tower which is in the middle of <HI>Madrid.</HI>
The <HI>Moors</HI> having besieg'd the City, the Inhabitants were redu∣ced
to so great a want of Provisions, that they were delibera∣ting
<PB N="151" REF="154"/>
to Surrender, when on a sudden they found this Tower
full of Corn; they concluded such a plentiful and seasonable
Supply could be no less than the effect of a Miracle; this fill'd
them with Joy and new Courage, and made them so vigo∣rously
defend the City, that the <HI>Moors</HI> toyl'd with a long Siege,
were force to retire. Afterwards they found the Image of
the <HI>Virgin,</HI> and in gratitude, they built a Chapel for her, upon
the Walls of which, this whole History is painted in <HI>Fresco.</HI> The
Altar, Rayles, and all the Lamps are of solid Silver.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minime</HI> Fryars have a Church near this, in which is the
Chappel of our <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Soledad,</HI> where the <HI>Salutation</HI> is every
night said; this is a place of great Devotion; I mean for those
that are truly devout, for there are a great many Persons which
make it their Rendezvouz for other ends.</P>
<P>But St. <HI>Isidore</HI>'s Chappel surpasses all in beauty. He is the
Patron of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and he was but a poor Labourer. The Walls
of the Chappel are all cased with Marble of divers Colours, and
its Pillars are of the same, and so are some Statues of certain
Saints: This Tomb is in the middle, and four Pillars of Porphi∣ry
supports over it a Crown cut in Marble, in which are repre∣sented
Flowers, whose Colours are so very natural, that one may
say, Art has outdone Nature. The <HI>Cupulo,</HI> without is adorned
with the Images of the Twelve Apostles, which stand round
it.</P>
<P>I saw at St. <HI>Sebastines,</HI> (which at present is my Parish) a
Canopy which the Queen-Mother caus'd to be made, for the
carrying the holy Sacrament to the Sick in bad Weather: It is
made of Crimson Velvet embroider'd with Gold, it is cover'd
with Chagrin, and nail'd with Gold Nails; it has several great
Glasses about it, and in the middle of its roof, there is rais'd a
sort of Steeple, which is full of little Bells of Gold, Four Priests
carry it when any Person of Quality is sick, and desires to re∣ceive
the Sacrament, and all the People at Court attend it.
There are about a thousand Flamboys of white Wax to give
Light, and several musical Instruments play before it. They
make some stay at all the great Places in their way, to give
leave to the People to kneel and receive the Benediction, and
to let the Musicians play upon their Harps and Guittars, and
sing to them. It is generally in the Night-time that they car∣ry
it with so much Ceremony and Respect.</P>
<P>When they are to celebrate a Festival in some Church, the
Evening before they set up a long Pole fastned in the Ground,
on the top of which is a kind of a deep Chaffing-dish, which
they fill with wooden Chips mixt with Brimstone and Oyl:
<PB N="152" REF="155"/>
This burns a long while, and gives a very great Light; they
place these Poles in the form of Allies, which make a delight∣ful
sort of an Illumination.</P>
<P>The Women which go abroad to <HI>Mass,</HI> hear a dozen of them,
but shew so much Distraction and wandring of Thoughts, that
one may easily perceive their Minds are employ'd on some other
thing than their Prayers. They wear Muffs that are above half
an Ell long; they are made of the finest Martins and Sables
which can be seen, and are worth 4 or 5 hundred Crowns a∣piece.
They must stretch back their Arms as far as possible they
can, to be able only to put their fingers ends into the entrance
of their Muffs. I fancy, I have already told you that the Wo∣men
are extream little, and these Muffs are very little less than
themselves. They always wear a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an too, and be it in Summer
or Winter, they never cease fanning themselves all the time of
<HI>Mass.</HI> In the Church they all sit upon their Legs, and are con∣tinually
taking of Snuff, and yet never smut themselves with it,
as 'tis usual; for in this, as in all other things, they have very
neat and dexterous ways of management. Every time the <HI>Ele∣vation</HI>
is made, both the Women and Men give themselves a
score of blows with their fifts upon their Breasts, which makes
such a noise, that the first time I heard it, I was very much
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffrighted, and thought they were beating one another.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Cavalleros,</HI> (I mean those which by Profession are
Gallants, and wear a piece of Crape round their Hats) as soon
as <HI>Mass</HI> is ended, they march up to the place where the <HI>Holy
Water</HI> is kept, and ranging themselves round it, they present
of it to all the Ladies, who also come thither, and at the same
time say something to them that's kind; to which the Women
make a pertinent answer in few words; for it must needs be
granted, that they speak precisely what they should, and that <HI>ex∣tempore,</HI>
without any trouble of studying for words. But the
<HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Nunci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> has upon pain of Excommunication, forbid the
Men to present the Women any <HI>Holy Water.</HI> And 'tis said, that
this Prohibition was obtained at the Intreaty of some jea∣lous
Husbands. However it be, it is observed, and they say,
the Prohibition even forbids the Men to give each other any
<HI>Holy Water.</HI></P>
<P>Let the <HI>Spanish</HI> Women be of what Quality they will, they
neither have Cushions, in the Church, nor any kind of Train
held up. For our parts, as soon as we appear there in our
<HI>French</HI> Cloaths, every body gets round about us; but the most
troublesome of all, are the big belly'd Women, which are more
inquisitive than the others, and for whom they have here, the
<PB N="153" REF="156"/>
greatest respect and complaisance; for 'tis pretended, that if
they long for any thing, and miss of it, they receive so much
hurt that they immediately miscarry; so that they have a li∣berty
to pull off ones Gloves, and to tugg, hale, and examine
every body as they list.</P>
<P>At first, I could not take such kind of Jesting, and talkt to
them so roughly, that some of them went away weeping, and
durst not return: But there were others which were not so ea∣sily
put out of Countenance; they would see my Shooes, my
Garters, and what I had in my Pocket; my Kinswomen seeing
I would not permit them, told me that if the People once took
notice of me they would certainly stone us, and bid me let
them have their humour. My Women and Chamber maids were
yet worse tormented than I; and I am asham'd to tell you,
how far the curiosity of these big-belly'd Woman proceeded.</P>
<P>I was told that there was a young man at Court, who was
desperately in love with a very fine Woman, whose Husband
continually kept her under his Eyes, so that finding no other way
to speak to her, he disguised himself like a Woman big with
Child, and so went to her House; he address'd himself to the
jealous Husband, and told him, he had the <HI>Lantajo</HI> (which is
the word for Longing) to discourse with his Wife in private.
The Husband deceiv'd by this appearance, made no question
that this was a young big belly'd Woman, and immediately
consented that his Wife should make this Person happy with a
long and pleasant audience.</P>
<P>When any of these Women long to see the King, they give
him notice of it, and he has the Goodness to come into a great
Balcon, which looks into the Palace Court, and there he tarries
as long as they desire.</P>
<P>Not long since a <HI>Spanish</HI> Woman just come from <HI>Naples,</HI> sent
to beg the King that she might see him, and when she had
lookt upon him as long as she had a mind in a transport of Zeal,
with hands lifted up, she said to him, <HI>I beseech God, Sir, that
of his Mercy, he would one day make you Vice-Roy of Naples.</HI> 'Tis
said, that this Passage was acted before the King, to inform us
that the Magnificence of the then <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> who was not be∣loved
far exceeded his. Very frequently there comes into my
Relation's House, Women which are perfect Strangers, to
whom nevertheless she is very kind and civil, because they are
big with Child, and such we must not vex.</P>
<P>Thanks to Heaven, Lent is over, and though I only observ'd
the Passion-Week, yet that was more tedious to me, then a
whole Lent kept at <HI>Paris,</HI> for there's no Butter here; that little
<PB N="154" REF="157"/>
which one meets with, is brought about Thirty Leagues off,
wrapt up like Sausages in Hogs Bladders. It is full of Worms,
and very dear. But the Oyl makes amends, for 'tis very ex∣cellent;
only you know, every body loves it not, and I am
one of those, which cannot eat it, without being very sick.</P>
<P>That which makes it yet worse here, is, that Fish is very
scarce; it is impossible to have any sweet which is caught in the
Sea, for that is distant from <HI>Madrid</HI> above Fourscore Leagues.
Sometimes there is a Salmon brought, of which they make Pies,
which being season'd with Spice and Saffron, is eatable. There's
very little Fresh water Fish, and yet for all this, they do not
suffer much Inconvenience, for indeed, there's hardly any body
keeps Lent, neither Master nor Servant, because of the great
want of Provisions. They take a License from the Pope's <HI>Nun∣cio,</HI>
which costs about a Shilling, which gives them leave to eat
Butter and Cheese all <HI>Lent,</HI> and the Heads, Feet, and Inwards
of Fowl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> every Saturday throughout the Year. And it
seems to me pretty odd, that on this day they should eat the
Feet, Head, and Inwards, and yet dare not eat of any other
part of the same Creature.</P>
<P>The Shambles are as open in <HI>Lent,</HI> as they are in the <HI>Carna∣val.</HI>
Their way of selling Meat is very troublesome; it is close
shut up in the Butcher's Shop, one speaks to him through a
little Window, and desires of to buy him half a Calf, or the
like; he neither vouchsafes to answer you, nor to shew you the
least bit of Meat; at last, you are content with a Loyn of Veal;
but he makes you pay your Money down before-hand, and then
through his little Window he gives you a Leg Mutton; you
return it, and tell him, this is not what you ask for; he takes
it again, and instead thereof he gives you a short Rib of Beef;
then you make a noise for your Loyn, but he concerns himself
no further than to throw you your Money, and shut the Win∣dow
upon you. This vexes one, and you go to another, and
he treats you after the same manner, if not worse; so that it is
best, to tell them how much Meat you would have, and leave
the rest to them. The Flesh is ill for the Stomach, it is so
lean, dry, and black; but as bad as 'tis, yet there's less requir'd
of it than of ours in <HI>France,</HI> to make good Soup. Every thing
here nourishes so extreamly, that an Egg does one more good
than a Pigeon elsewhere; and this I take to be an Effect of the
Climate.</P>
<P>As to their Wine, it does not please me; this is not the Coun∣try
where the Excellent <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine is drank, that comes from
<HI>Andalousia</HI> and the <HI>Canary-Islands,</HI> which must pass the Sea too,
<PB N="155" REF="158"/>
to gain that strength and pleasantness which we find in it. At
<HI>Madrid</HI> the Wine is strong enough, if not too strong, but it
wants that delicious Taste. Add to this, that they keep it in
Bags made of Buck-skin, and fitted up for that purpose, so that
it always smells and tastes either of Pitch, or as if it was burnt.
I now begin not to wonder that Men are so temperate with
such Liquor. They'll sell as little a quantity of it as one will, even
to the value of a <HI>French Double:</HI> But that which is so retail'd out
to the poor People, is yet made worse than it would be, by their
letting it stand all day in an open Earthen Bason, out of which
they sell to those who have a mind. It grows sour, and smells
so strong, that it make one's Head ake in passing by.</P>
<P>Lent makes no alteration in their Pleasures, indeed they are
so moderate, or at least those they use make so little noise, that
they enjoy them at all times.</P>
<P>No body fails of going to their <HI>Station</HI> in Passion-week, but
particularly from Wednesday to Friday. In these three days,
there is acted very different things, by real <HI>Penitents, Lovers,</HI>
and <HI>Hypocrites.</HI> There are divers Women, which under pre∣tence
of Devotion, constantly go to certain Churches, where
for a Year before, they are assur'd to meet him they Love;
and though they are attended with several of their Women,
which they call <HI>Duennas,</HI> yet as the Crowds are great, and Love
makes them ingenious, so they make a shift in spight of all the
<HI>Argus</HI>'s, to slip on one side into a little adjoyning House, which
by a private sign they know, and is hired for that purpose, and
without the help of any body, but at that very moment of time.
When they have done, they return to the same Church, where
they find their Women busie in searching for them; they fall a
chiding them for their carelesness in losing them; and thus the
Husband, who for a whole Year hath industriously watch'd his
dear Wife, loses her at that very season when she is obilged to
be the most faithful to him: The great Constraint they live
under, put violent desires in them to enjoy some freedom, and
their very Amorous Nature makes them Witty to find out means
to bring about their Designs.</P>
<P>'Tis an unpleasant thing to see the <HI>Disciplinarians:</HI> The first
time I met one of them I thought I should have swooned a∣way.
The unexpectedness of such a terrible sight seized me;
fancy a Man coming so near you, that he'll cover you all over
with his Blood; this, it seems, is one of their Pastimes: there
are certain Rules by which to Discipline themselves handsomly,
and Masters to teach the Art, just as to Dance and to Fence.
They have a sort of a Gown made of their <HI>Baptist</HI> Cloth very
<PB N="156" REF="159"/>
fine, which comes down to their Shooes; it is laid in small
plights, and so prodigiously wide, that it contains at least fifty
Ells of Cloth. They wear upon their Heads a Cap three times
higher than a Sugar-loaf, and of the same Shape: It is cover'd
with Holland, and from it falls a great piece of Cloth which
hides all the Face and the forepart of the Body; there's two
little holes in't to see through: On the back of their Wastcoats
they have two great holes upon their shoulders; they wear
white Gloves and Shooes, and abundance of Ribbon which tyes
their Wastcoat-sleeves, but hanging down, and not in knots.
They also tye one to their Whip; commonly 'tis their Mistress
which honours them with this Favour: And to be the more
admired, they must not lift up their Arms, only the Wrist and
the Hand, and the blows must not follow hastily, nor the
Blood which runs out spoil their Cloaths. They give them∣selves
most terrible cuts and slashes upon their Shoulders, from
whence runs streams of Blood. They walk so softly in the
Streets as if they counted their steps; they present themselves
before their Mistress's Window, and there with wonderful pa∣tience
lash themselves. The Lady through the Lettice of her
Chamber sees this fine sight, and by some sign encourages her
Gallant to flea himself alive, and lets him know how very kind∣ly
she takes this Action of his. When they meet a handsome
Woman, they whip themselves after such a rate, as to make
the Blood flie upon her: This is esteemed a particular Civility,
and the Lady acknowledges and thanks them for it. When once
they have begun to give themselves this Discipline, the preser∣vation
of their Health obliges them afterwards to use it every
Year, otherwise they would be sick. They have also little
Needles stuck in Sponges, with which they prick their Shoul∣ders
and their sides so eagerly, as if it did not hurt them. But
I'll tell you something yet stranger. Several Courtiers often
take this Walk in the Night: But they are commonly the
young Fools, and they give notice to all their Friends of their
Design, who immediately come to them very well arm'd. The
Marquess <HI>De Villa Hermosa</HI> was one of them this Year, and the
Duke <HI>De Vejar</HI> was the other. This Duke went out of his
House about Nine a Clock at Night, he had a hundred Flam∣boys
of White Wax carry'd before him, two by two. Three∣score
of his Friends went before, and a hundred follow'd after
him, and every one had his Page and Footmen; and it was a
very long Procession. It is known when Men of this Quality
are to walk; so that all the Ladies are in their Windows, and
hang out their Carpets in their Balconies; and that they may
<PB N="157" REF="160"/>
the better see and be seen, they have Flamboys fastned to the
sides. The <HI>Knight of Discipline</HI> with his Guard, passes along
and salutes the Spectators. But that which often causes a great
deal of Mischief, is, when the other <HI>Disciplinarian,</HI> who stands
upon his Honour and Reputation, marches with his great Com∣pany
in the same Street. This happened to these Persons I
have now mentioned. Each of them would have the upper
hand, and neither would yield it. The Footmen with their
Flamboys began to lay one another over the Faces, and burn
their Wiskers and Hair; the Friends of each Party drew their
Swords against one another. Our two <HI>Heroes</HI> who were only
Armed with this Instrument of Penance, search for each other,
and being met, begin a most terrible Battel. After they have
used a little Discipline about one anothers Ears, and covered the
Ground with the ends of their Whip-cords, they fall down∣right
Fifty-cuffs like any Porters: Though after all, there's but
little matter to laugh at in this piece of Mummery, for they
beat one another well favouredly; they wound, and often
kill; and here old Enmities revive and are revenged. But at
last, the Duke <HI>de Vejar</HI> yielded to the Marquess <HI>De Villa Hermo∣sa,</HI>
they gathered up their broken Whips, and mended them
as well as they could: The great Cap, which was thrown into
the <HI>Canal,</HI> was wiped and put upon the <HI>Penitent</HI>'s Head again;
the wounded were carried home, and the Procession began a∣gain,
and they walked more gravely than ever, through a great
part of the City.</P>
<P>The <HI>Duke</HI> had a great mind the next Morning to be revenged,
but the <HI>King</HI> commanded both him and the <HI>Marquess</HI> not to stir
out of their Houses. But to come to what they do upon these
Occasions: You must know, that after these Servants of <HI>God</HI>
are returned home, there's a magnificent Supper prepared of all
sorts of Meats; and observe that this is on the last day of <HI>Pas∣sion
Week.</HI> But after so good a Work, they think they may do
a little Evil. Immediately the <HI>Penitent</HI> causes his shoulders
to be a long time rubbed with Sponges dipt in Vinegar and Salt,
lest there should remain any bruised Blood, after that, he sets
himself at the Table with his Friends, and receives from them
the Elogies and Applauses which he believes he has merited.
Every one in his turn, tells him, that in the Memory of Man,
none was ever seen to receive the Discipline with so good a
grace. They magnifie all his Actions, but above all, the Hap∣piness
of that Lady for whose sake all this Bravery was per∣formed.
The whole Night is spent in such kind of Discourse,
and sometimes he that has been so well flogged, is so sick, that
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>
he cannot go to <HI>Mass</HI> on <HI>Easter-day.</HI> Do not think that I use
any Art to set out the History of this matter to make you merry,
it is all literally true, and I tell you nothing, which you may not
be satisfied in, from every body that has been at <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>But there are also true <HI>Penitents,</HI> which indeed troubles one
extreamly to look on them, they are drest just as those who
give themselves the <HI>Discipline,</HI> except that they are naked from
the shoulders to the middle, and with a kind of a narrow Matt
are swadled and bound so very hard, that all the Flesh which
appears is black and blew, their Arms stretched out, are wrapt
about with the same Matt. They carry to the number of seven
Swords sticking in their Backs and Arms, which hurt them
grievously when they stir too much, or happen to fall, which
they often do, for they going bare-foot, and the Stones in the
Streets being sharp, and cutting their Feet, they cannot possi∣bly
always keep themselves up. There are others, who instead
of these Swords carry Crosses so very heavy, that they are even
born down with them, neither would I have you think that
these are of the ordinary People, some of them are of the high∣est
Quality. They are forced to have several of their Servants
to accompany them, but they are disguised, and their Faces co∣vered,
lest they should be known. These carry Wine, Vine∣gar,
and other things, to give their Master from time to time,
who very frequently drop down dead with the extream pain
and toil they endure. Generally these <HI>Penances</HI> are enjoyned
by their Confessors, and they are so very severe, that he which
undergoes them seldom out-lives the Year. The Popes <HI>Nuncio</HI>
told me that he had forbid all <HI>Confessors</HI> to impose them, yet I
have seen divers, though in likelihood it proceeded from their
own Devotion.</P>
<P>From the beginning of <HI>Passion-Week</HI> to <HI>Low-Sunday,</HI> one can∣not
stir out of Doors without seeing an infinite number of <HI>Peni∣tents</HI>
of all sorts, and on <HI>Good-Friday</HI> they all come to the <HI>Pro∣cession,</HI>
which is but one general one for all the City, and is
composed of all the <HI>Parishes</HI> and <HI>Convents.</HI> Upon this day, the
Ladies are more finely dressed than on their Wedding-days;
they place themselves in their Balconies, which are set out with
rich Carpets and Cushions. Sometimes there's above an hundred
Women together. The Procession begins about four a Clock,
and is not ended till past eight; for I cannot express to you
the numberless Number of People I have seen, counting from
the <HI>King, Don John,</HI> the <HI>Cardinals, Embassadors,</HI> the <HI>Grandees,</HI>
the <HI>Courtezans,</HI> to all sorts of Folks, both of the Court and City.
Every one holds a Wax Candle in his Hand, and all their Ser∣vants,
<PB N="159" REF="162"/>
which are numerous, carry Torches and Flamboys. In
their <HI>Procession,</HI> all their Banners and Crosses are covered with
Crape, and there's a vast number of Drums covered with the
same, and they beat, as at the Death of a General. The Trum∣pets
sound some melancholy Tune. The <HI>King</HI>'s Guards, which
are four Companies of different Nations, to wit, <HI>Burgundians,
Spaniards, Germans,</HI> and <HI>L'Ancillians,</HI> have their Arms covered
with Mourning, and trail them upon the ground. There are
certain Machins set upon Theatres, which represent the My∣steries
of the Life and Death of our Lord; the Figures are as
big as Life, but very ill made and drest: There are some so
heavy, that a hundred Men can but lift them, of which there's
a vast number, for every Parish has some. I observed that of
the Blessed <HI>Virgin</HI> flying into <HI>Egypt,</HI> she was upon an Ass which
had good Furniture; the Housing was all over embroidered
with fine Pearls, the Figure was very great and heavy.</P>
<P>Here they are afraid lest sometimes the People should fail in
their Devotion at <HI>Easter,</HI> and therefore for that reason, each
Parish-Priest goes to every House, and enquires of the Master,
how many Communicants he has? Being informed, he notes
the Number in his Book: To every one that has received the
Communion, they give a Printed Certificate. After <HI>Low-Sunday</HI>
they visit all the Houses again, and demand to see the Certifi∣cates,
which they ought to have according to the first Account
taken of them, and if they can shew none, there's a strict en∣quiry
made after him or her who has not Communicated. At
this time the Poor who are sick, hang out a Carpet at their
Door, and the Sacrament is brought to them in a very fine and
Devout Procession.</P>
<P>Since my being at <HI>Madrid,</HI> I have seen very few stately Fu∣nerals,
except one for the Duke de <HI>Medina Celi</HI>'s Daughter. Her
Coffin was made of rare <HI>Indian</HI> Wood, put into a blue Velvet
Bag and crost with Silver Mohair with Cords of Silver Thread,
and the Strings were of the same, and fastned the Bag at each
end, like a stuff Cloak-bag. The Coffin was in a Hearse co∣vered
with white Velvet, set round with Garlands and Coronets
curiously made of Flowers. And thus they carried her to <HI>Me∣dina
Celi,</HI> the Capital City of the Dutchy of that Name.</P>
<P>Commonly they dress up the dead in the habit of some <HI>Re∣ligious
Order,</HI> and carry them all bare-faced into the Church
where they are to be buryed. If it is a Woman, they put her
on the habit of the <HI>Carmelites.</HI> This Order is in great Vene∣ration
here; the Princesses of the Blood retire to their Convent.
The Queens themselves, when they are Widows, are obliged
<PB N="160" REF="163"/>
to spend the rest of their Life there, unless the King otherwise
appointed before his Death, as <HI>Philip</HI> IV. did in favour of
Queen <HI>Mary Ann</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> his Wife. And in case a Queen is
Divorced, she must go into a <HI>Religious House;</HI> for Divorced or
Widow, she has not the Liberty to marry again.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> presume so much above other <HI>Kings,</HI> that
they will not endure a <HI>Princess</HI> who has once been their Wife,
should ever be so to another, let her have the greatest Passion
in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> hath a natural Daughter, a professed <HI>Carmelite</HI> at
<HI>Madrid.</HI> She is wonderful handsome, and 'tis said she had no
mind to take the Habit; but 'twas her Fate, as 'tis of divers o∣thers
of her Quality, who like it no more than she.</P>
<P>They call them the <HI>De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>calcas Reales,</HI> which is to say, <HI>The
Royal-barefeet.</HI> This reaches even to the King's Mistresses,
whether they be unmarried or Widows, when he can love them
no longer, they must turn <HI>Nuns.</HI></P>
<P>I have seen some of the Works of St. <HI>Theresa,</HI> writ with her
own Hand, the Character is Legible, large, and indifferent fair.
<HI>Donna Beatrix Carillo,</HI> who is her Neece's Neece, keeps them
very choicely. It was she that shewed them to me. They con∣sist
of a Collection of Letters, I do not believe they were ever
Printed; there's a great deal of Perfection in them, and through∣out
one may discover a certain air of chearfulness and sweet∣ness
of Nature, which sufficiently declares the Character of that
great Saint.</P>
<P>All the time of <HI>Lent,</HI> and even at other times, one meets with
Preachers at every corner of a street, whose Sermons are ill
enough contrived, and do as little good, but however, in prea∣ching
as they do, they both satisfie their zeal and their desire.
Their most constant Auditors are the blind Folks, which resem∣ble
our singers upon <HI>Pont-Neuf.</HI> Every one of them being led
by a little Dog which does it very well, they go about singing
of <HI>Romances</HI> and <HI>Cacara,</HI> which are certain old Stories or Mo∣dern
Events, which the People are very glad to know. They
have a little D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um, and a Flute, on which they play. They of∣ten
sing a S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng on King <HI>Francis</HI> the First, it beginning, <HI>When
the King left</HI> France, <HI>to his Sorrow he left it,</HI> &amp;c. Now, I doubt
you know it, dear Cosen, for who does not: This song is
sung in very had <HI>French,</HI> and by Folks that do not understand
one word of it. All that they understand is, That the King
was taken by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and as this Prince was much for
their Glory, so they are willing to convey the Memory of it
down to Posterity. There's a <HI>Flower de-Luce</HI> all gilt upon the
<PB N="161" REF="164"/>
roof of the Chamber where this King was Prisoner; and I must
not omit telling you, that the Prison is one of the fairest Buil∣dings
in <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Windows are as large as those of other
Houses. There are indeed Iron Bars, but they are all gilt, and
set at a distance great enough, to make any one think they
were not designed to hinder escapes. I stood amazed at the
seeming neatness of a Place which in reality is unpleasant e∣nough,
and I thought that in <HI>Spain,</HI> they had a mind to con∣tradict
the <HI>French</HI> Proverb, which says, <HI>That there's neither any
handsome Prison, nor ugly Love.</HI> Pardon this Proverb, I do not
love them so well to trouble you often with them.</P>
<P>All the Houshold-stuff one sees here, is extream rich, but not
so neatly made as ours in <HI>France,</HI> and they come altogether short
of our skill. It consists of Tapestry, Cabinet, Paintings,
Looking Glasses, and Plate. The <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> and the
Governours of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> have had most admirable
Tapistry▪ the <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Sardinia,</HI> shew most ex∣cellent
Embroideries and Statues, those of the <HI>Indies,</HI> Precious
Stones, and Vessels of Gold and Silver. So that several return∣ing
home from time to time, laden with the Riches of another
Kingdom, cannot chuse but to have enriched this City with abun∣dance
of valuable things.</P>
<P>They change their Furniture several times a year; their
Winter-beds are of Velvet trimed with thick Galoons of Gold,
but they are so low, and the Valens so deep, that one is as if
they were buryed in them; and when one is in Bed, the border
of the Valens lying almost upon the Counterpain, one can hard∣ly
be seen. In Summer they have neither Curtains, nor any
thing else about the Bed, this looks very ill. Sometimes they
hang coloured Gauze to keep off the Gnats.</P>
<P>In Winter they have their Apartments very high, some∣times
in the fourth Story, according as the cold encreases, to
keep them from it. At present they use their Summer Lodg∣ings,
which are low and very commodious. All their Houses
have a great many Rooms on a floor; you go through a dozen
or fifteen Parlours or Chambers one after another. Those which
are the worst lodged have six or seven, the Rooms are general∣ly
longer than they are broad, the Floors and Seilings are nei∣ther
painted, nor gilt, they are made of Plaister quite plain,
but so white that they dazle ones Eyes, for every year they are
scrapt, and whited as the Walls, which look like Marble, they
are so well polisht. The Court to their Summer Apartments
is made of certain matter, which after it has had ten Pails of
<PB N="162" REF="165"/>
Water thrown upon it, yet is dry in half an hour after, and
leaves a pleasant coolness, so that in the Morning they water
all, and a little while after, they spread Matts or Carpets made
of very fine Rushes which cover all the Pavement. The whole
Apartments are hung with the same small Matt about the
depth of an Ell, to hinder the coldness of the Walls from hur∣ting
those which lean against them. On the top of these
Matts, there are hung Pictures and Looking-Glasses. The
Cushions which are of Gold and Silver Brocado, are placed up∣on
the Carpet, and the Tables and Cabinets are very fine, and
at little distances there are set Silver Cases or Boxes, filled with
Orange and Jassamin-Trees. In their Windows they set things
made of Straw, to keep the Sun out, and in the Evenings they
walk in their Gardens. There are several Houses which have
very fine ones, where you see Grotta's and Fountains in abun∣dance,
for they have great plenty of Water here, and 'tis very
good. In the number of these fine Houses they reckon the
Duke <HI>Ossona</HI>'s, that of the Admiral of <HI>Castile's</HI> Lady, the
Countess of <HI>Ognate,</HI> and the Constable of <HI>Castile;</HI> but I do
wrong in particularizing of them, for there are a considerable
number of them.</P>
<P>For the rest, it seems to me, that the great care they take,
prevents the heats (let them be never so excessive) from being
troublesome to them. But do not fancy, I beseech ye, that on∣ly
the great Lords have their low Apartments, for indeed every
body else has them according to their Ability; though it be on∣ly
a little Cellar they'll live in it contentedly.</P>
<P>There are but few ordinary People at <HI>Madrid,</HI> one seldom
sees any but Persons of Quality, if seven or eight Streets which
are full of Tradesmen, are excepted. You see no Shops in this
City, unless it be those where Sweet-meats, Liquors, Ice, and
Pastry are sold.</P>
<P>I will not neglect telling you, that a thousand People here,
have their <HI>Canopys,</HI> for without reckoning the Princess and the
Dukes, the <HI>Tituled</HI> (of which there is a vast number) have theirs
also. These <HI>Tituled,</HI> are those they call the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI>
the real <HI>Marquises,</HI> and the real <HI>Counts.</HI> If there be thirty
Chambers on a floor in a house, you shall there see as many <HI>Ca∣nopys.</HI>
My Kinswoman has twenty in her House: The King
has made her Marchioness of <HI>Castille.</HI> You cannot imagine how
gravely I look under a <HI>Canopy,</HI> particularly when they bring me
my Chocolate; for three or four Pages clothed in black like
Lawyers, serve me upon Knee. This is a Custom I had much
<PB N="163" REF="166"/>
ado to bring my self to, for methinks this Respect ought to be
paid to <HI>God</HI> only. But it is so common here, that if a Coblers
Prentice should present an old Shooe to his Master, he must do
it with knee upon the Ground. This quality of <HI>Titulos</HI> gives
them divers Priviledges of which I have already told you, and
particularly that of having a <HI>Canopy.</HI> They use no Ballisters a∣bout
their Beds.</P>
<P>I have observed to you before, Dear Cosen, that our
Houses are not near so well furnished in <HI>France,</HI> as the Per∣sons
of Quality here are, but chiefly as to Vessels of Silver, the
difference is so very great, that one which had not seen it
could hardly believe it: They use no Vessel of Tin or Pewter,
but either Silver or Earthen-ware only, is what they make use
of; and you must know their Plates here, weigh little less
than our Dishes in <HI>France,</HI> every thing is made so strangely
heavy.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Alburquerque</HI> dyed some time ago. I have
been told, that they were six Weeks in weighing his Vessels
of Gold and Silver, and writing them down; during this time
they employed two whole hours every day; this was very char∣geable.
Amongst other things, there were fourteen hundred
dozen of Plates, five hundred great Dishes, and seven hundred
little ones, and of every thing else proportionably, there were
also forty Silver Ladders to set things on the Cup-board, which
was made to ascend by little Steps, like your Altars in a great
Hall. When they told me of such great Wealth of a particular
Man, I thought they jested with me, and therefore desired the
Confirmation of it from <HI>Don Antonio de Toleda▪</HI> Son to the Duke
of <HI>Alba,</HI> who was in the same House; he assured me it was
very true, and that his Father, who did not esteem himself
rich in Vessels of Silver, had three hundred dozen of
Silver Plates, and eight hundred Dishes. The migh∣ty
Meals which they make do not require such great store, un∣less
it be at their Marriages, where every thing is magnificent.
But that which causes such great abundance of Vessels, is, that
they are brought from the <HI>Indies</HI> ready made, and pay no Cu∣stom
to the King. The truth is, they are little better shaped
than their pieces of four <HI>Pistols,</HI> which they stamp in the
Galleon as they come from that Country.</P>
<P>It would grieve a body to see the ill management of some
great Lords, there are divers which will never go to their E∣states
(for so they call their Lands, their Towns and Castles)
but pass all their Lives at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and trust all to a Steward,
<PB N="164" REF="167"/>
who makes them believe what he judges most for his own Inte∣rest.
They will not so much as vouchsafe to enquire whether
he speaks true or false; this would be too exact, and by con∣sequence
below them. This methinks is one considerable fault,
the strange profusion of Vessels only for an Egg and a Pigeon, is
another.</P>
<P>But it is not only in these things which they fail, but 'tis al∣so
in the daily Expences of their Houses, they know not what
it is to lay up stores, or make Provision of any thing, but eve∣ry
day they fetch in what they want, and all upon trust, at the
Bakers, Cooks, Butchers, and all other Trades; they are even
ignorant what they set down in their Books, and they put
down what price they will for every thing they sell, this mat∣ter
is neither examined into, nor contradicted. There are of∣ten
fifty Horses in a Stable, without either Corn or Straw, and
they perish with Hunger; and when the Master is in Bed,
and should be taken ill in the Night, he would be at a great
loss; for they let nothing remain in his House, neither
Wine nor Water, Charcoal nor Wax-Candle, and in a word,
nothing at all; for though they do not take in Provisions so
near that there is nothing left, yet his Servants have a
Custom of carrying the overplus away to their own Lodgings,
and the next day they furnish themselves with the same things
again.</P>
<P>They observe no better Rules with the Tradesmen, a Man
or Woman of Quality had rather dye, than to haggle for,
or ask the price of a Stuff, or Lace, or any other thing,
or to take the remainder of a piece of Gold; they rather
choose to give it the Tradesman for his pains of having
sold them that for ten Pistols, which was not worth five.
If there is a reasonable price made, he that sells to them
is so honest not to take the advantage of their easiness to give
whatever is askt them; and as they have Credit given them
for ten years together without ever thinking of paying, so at
last they find themselves under great difficulties with their
Debts.</P>
<P>It is very rare they engage in tedious Suits at Law, or let
things come to extremity, they bring themselves to account,
call their Creditors, and make over to them a certain part of
their Lands, which for a limited time they enjoy. Some∣times
they give up every thing, and reserve only a Pension
for Life, which cannot be medled with by any Creditors, who
may afterwards sell or lend any thing to them; and to the
<PB N="165" REF="168"/>
end they be not defrauded of it, they publish the agreement
between the Lord and his Creditors.</P>
<P>All Law-paper is marked, and costs more than the other.
There's a certain time when they make a distribution of
Law-Suits; they give the instructions at <HI>Madrid,</HI> but there
are few judged there; all the Papers of one side are put in∣to
a Bag, and those of the other, into another Bag, and the In∣structions
into a third; and when the time to distribute the
Law-Suits is come, they send them to some distant Parliaments,
so that very often one's Cause is tryed and judged without
knowing any thing of it. It is writ in a Register whether the
Cause was sent, which is kept very secret. When Judgment
is given, it is sent back to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and is signified to the Par∣ties.
This Method saves a great deal of Trouble and Sollicati∣ons,
which in my Opinion ought always to be forbidden. As
to business here, it is excessive tedious, whether it be at Court
or in the City, and ruines one in a little time. The <HI>Spanish</HI>
Practitioners are great Knaves in their Trade.</P>
<P>There are several different Councils, all composed of Persons
of Quality, and the greatest part are Councellors of the Sword.
The first is the Council of State, the others are called the su∣pream
Council of War, the Royal Council of <HI>Castille,</HI> the Al∣caides
of Court, the Council of the Holy <HI>Inquisition,</HI> the Council
of Orders, the Sacred, Supream and Royal Council of <HI>Arragon,</HI>
the Royal Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> the Council of the Chamber of
<HI>Castille,</HI> the Council of <HI>Italy,</HI> the Council of the <HI>Finances,</HI> the
Council of the <HI>Croisado,</HI> the Council of <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Court for
the Duty of Horse, the Court for his Majesties Woods, and the
Courts of the Millions.</P>
<P>They understand so little how to manage things to the best
advantage, that when a Father dyes and leaves ready Money,
and some Children under Age, that they lock the Money up in
a Chest, and never put it out to be improved. For Example,
The Duke <HI>de Frias,</HI> whose Widow is marryed to the Constable
of <HI>Castille,</HI> left three Daughters, and six hundred thousand
Crowns in ready Money, they put it into three Chests, with
the Name of each Daughter. The Eldest was not seven
years old; she is now marryed in <HI>Flanders</HI> to the Prince <HI>de
Ligne.</HI> The Guardians constantly kept the Keys of these Chests,
and never opened that of the Eldest, but to compt it to her
Husband. Observe what a loss there is of Interest: But they
tell you it would be much worse, if the Principal happened to
be lost; sometimes when one thinks they have put it se∣curely
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
out, it proves quite otherwise: That a Bankrupt makes
one lose all, so that is is better to gain nothing, than to hazard
the Pupils Estate.</P>
<P>It is time to come to an end, Dear Cosen, I shall be afraid
to tire you with a longer Letter: I beseech you cause all those
I send you, to be delivered, and pardon the freedom I take;
Adieu, I embrace and constantly love you with all my Heart.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<P>YOU did me a particular Kindness in letting me know
that all my Letters come to your hands, for I was
a little concerned for the Two last: And since you
still desire it (dear Cosen) I shall continue to in∣form
you of every thing that passes, and of all that I observe in
this Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal</HI> Palace is built upon a Hill which insensibly de∣scends
to the very Banks of the River called <HI>Manzanarez.</HI> It
looks several ways upon the Country, which is very plea∣sant
there. One goes to it through the <HI>Callemayor,</HI> that is
to say, the great Street, which indeed is both very long and
broad, several considerable Houses add to its Beauty. There's
a large open place before the <HI>Palace,</HI> no body of what Qua∣lity
soever, is allowed to come with a Coach into the Court,
<PB N="168" REF="171"/>
but they stop under the great Arch of the Porch, except it
be when Bonefires are made there, or when there are <HI>Masque∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ades,</HI>
and then Coaches go in, a very small number of Halbar∣deers
stand at the Gate, upon my asking, why so great a King
had so small a Guard, why, Madam, says a <HI>Spaniard</HI> to me, <HI>Are
not we all his Guard?</HI> He reigns too absolutely in the Hearts of
his Subjects, either to fear any thing, or distrust them. The
Palace stands at the end of the City towards the South, it is
built of very white Stone. Two Pavilions compleat the Front,
the rest is not regular. Behind it, there are two square Courts,
each consisting of four sides, the first is adonred with two great
Tarrass-walks, which run quite through, they are raised upon
high Arches, and are beautified with Ballisters and Statues;
That which I observed very singular, was, that the Womens
Statues had <HI>Red</HI> upon their Cheecks and Shoulders, you go
through fine Porches which bring you to the Stair-case, which
is extream large, the Apartments are furnisht with excel∣lent
Pictures, admirable Tapistry, most rare Statues, stately
Houshold Goods, and in a word, with every thing suitable to
a <HI>Royal-Palace.</HI> But there are divers of the Rooms dark, I saw
some which had no Window, and received Light only when
the Door opened, those which have Windows are but little
lighter, because of their smalness, they alledge that the Heat
is so excessive, that they are willing to hinder the Sun from co∣ming
in, as much as they can. But there's yet another Reason,
for Glass is very scarce and dear; and as to other Houses, there
are many which have Windows without any Glass; and when
they would describe a compleat House, they'll tell you in one
word, that <HI>'tis Glazed.</HI> This want of Glass does not appear
without, because of the Latices. The Palace is adorned with
divers gilt Balconies, which indeed looked very fine. All the
<HI>Councils</HI> sit there, and when the <HI>King</HI> has a mind to be present,
he passes through certain Galleries and little Entries unpercei∣ved.
There's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great many People perswaded, that the Castle
of <HI>Madrid,</HI> which <HI>Francis</HI> the Fifth caused to be built near the
Wood of <HI>Bologn,</HI> was after the Model of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Pa∣lace,
but 'tis a mistake, and nothing is less alike. The Gardens
are not suitable to the Dignity of the Place, they are neither
large enough, nor so well improved as they should be, the Ground
as I have observed, reaches to the very Brink of <HI>Manzanarez,</HI>
the whole is inclosed with Walls, and if these Gardens have any
Beauty, they owe it purely to Nature. They work hard to get
the Young <HI>Queens</HI> Apartment ready for her Reception, all her
<PB N="169" REF="172"/>
Servants are named, and the King expects her with the great∣est
Impatience.</P>
<P>The <HI>Buen Retiro</HI> is a Royal House near one of the Gates of
the City, the Count Duke caused at first, a little House to be
built there, and called it <HI>Galinera,</HI> it was for keeping his rare
Poultry in, which had been presented to him, and as he often
went to see them, and the Scituation of the Place was on the
descent of a little Hill, and there was a pleasant Prospect, so he
was invited to undertake a considerable Building. Four great
Apartments and four great Pavillions make a perfect Square. In
the middle there's a Flower-Pot, well furnished with Flowers
and a Fountain, whose Statue (which throws the Water when
they have a mind) Sprinkles the Flowers and the Cross-Walks,
which goes from one Apartment to another. This Building
has the fault of being too low, the Rooms are large, stately, and
adorned with curious Paintings. Every thing shines with Gold
and lively Colours, with which the Ceilings and Floors are
beautified. I took notice in the great Gallery, of the Entry
of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Mother to the late Queen, she's on Horse∣back,
with a Ruff and Fardingal, she has a Hat trimmed with
Jewels, a Plume of Feathers, she is fat, fair and pleasing, she
has fine Eyes, and her Looks are sweet and ingenuous. The
Room for acting Plays in, is well designed, very large, all well
set out, with Carving and Guilding, there may be fifteen in a
Box without inconvenience to each other, they have all Latice
Windows, and the King's is richly guilt, there's neither Galle∣ries
nor Amphitheatre, every body sits upon Benches on the
Floor. On the side of the Terrass is the Statue of <HI>Philip</HI> the II.
upon a Horse of Brass, this Piece is of great Value, those that
are curious please themselves in taking a draught of him. The
Park is above a good League in compass, there are in it divers
seperate Lodges, very pretty, and which have good Accommo∣dation
of room, there's a Canal which is supplyed with Water
from Springs at a vast Charge, and another square Place in which
the King has little Gundoloes painted and gilt, thither he goes
during the great Heats of the Summer, the Fountains, Trees
and Meadows making that Place more cool and pleasant than a∣ny
other, there's Grottos, Cataracts, Ponds, Shades, and in some
parts even something of the wild Fields, which shews the sim∣plicity
of the Country, and is extream delighful.</P>
<P>The <HI>Casa del Campo</HI> is for rural Affairs, it is not great, but
its Scituation is fine, being upon the Bank of <HI>Mansanarez,</HI> the
Trees in't are high, and yield a Shade at all times. I speak
<PB N="170" REF="173"/>
of the Trees of this Country, because one fines very few of
them, there's Water in divers parts of it, particularly one
Pond which is surrounded with great Oaks. The Statue of
<HI>Philip</HI> the IV. is in the Garden, this Place is a little neg∣lected.
Here I saw Lions, Bears, Tigers and other wild
Beasts, which live very long in <HI>Spain,</HI> because the Climate is
little different from that from which they come, many People
go there to think, and the Ladies usually choose this Place
to walk in, because 'tis less frequented than others. But to
return to <HI>Mansanarez,</HI> this River does not run up to the City,
at certain times it is neither River, nor so much as a Brook,
tho' at other times, it is so big and rapid, that it carries before
it all that stands in its way, all the Summer People walk in
it, there's so little water in't at this season, that one can hardly
wet ones foot, and yet in Winter, all on a sudden, it over∣flows
the adjacent Country, this is caused by the melting of the
great Quantities of Snow which covers the Hills, and so de∣scends
into the <HI>Mansanarez</HI> in violent Torrents of Water.
<HI>Philip</HI> the II. caused a Bridge to be built over it, which they
called the <HI>Segovia Bridge,</HI> it is a very lofty one, and every way
as fine as the <HI>Pont-neuf,</HI> over the River <HI>Seine</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> when
Strangers see it, they fall a laughing, they think it ridiculous
to have caused such a Bridge to be built, where there's no Wa∣ter.
Hereupon there was one said wittily enough, <HI>he would
advise them to sell the Bridge, and buy some Water.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Florid</HI> is a most pleasant House, and its Gardens are
infinitely delightful; there are in great numbers <HI>Italian</HI> Sta∣tues
by the best Masters: The Water there makes a pretty so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
of a murmur, which with the sweet swell of the Flowers (of
which they have a Collection of the rarest and best scent) is
very charming. From thence we come to the <HI>Prado Nuevo,</HI>
where there are several spouting Fountains, and Trees there
are of an extraordinary height; this is a Walk, which though
it be not even Ground, yet is not less agreeable; its descent
is so easie, that one hardly perceive the unevenness of the
Place.</P>
<P>There is also the <HI>Carzuela,</HI> which affords nothing but Con∣trary
delights, and some cool Rooms, where the King comes
and rests himself after Hunting; but 'tis the Prospect which
yields the Pleasure, and very fine things might be there
made.</P>
<P>That I may tell you of something else besides the Kings
Houses, you must know, dear Cosen, that on <HI>May-day,</HI> they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esort to a Place without the Gate of <HI>Toleda.</HI> This is called
<PB N="171" REF="174"/>
<HI>El Sotillo,</HI> and no body excuse themselves from going thither,
to be sure then I went, but it was more to see then be seen,
tho' my <HI>French</HI> Dress made me very remarkable, and drew a
great many Eyes upon me. The Women of great Quality ne∣ver
go abroad to take the Air in their whole Life, except it be
in the first year of their Marriage, I mean into publick Walks
and Places; and then too, 'tis under the very noses of their
Husbands, the Wife at the lower, and the Husband at the up∣per
end of the Coach; the Curtains all open, and she finely a∣dorned:
but 'tis a ridiculous thing to see these two Creatures
sit like Statues, looking at each other, and without speaking
a word in an hours time. There are certain days set apart for
walking and taking the Air, all <HI>Madrid</HI> go abroad then; the
King is seldom there, but except the King and a few Courtiers
no body else fail of going. That which makes it very trouble∣some
is, their long Traces, which take up a great compass of
Ground, and occasions the Horses often to entangle. Several
Ladies which are not of the highest Rank, resort thither, but
with their Curtains close drawn; they only look through little
Glasses which are fastned into the sides of the Coach, but at
Night the Ladies of great Quality come <HI>Incognito;</HI> and when
'tis dark they please themselves so far as to walk a foot: They
wear white Mantles upon their Heads, these are a kind of a
Hood made of Woolen Stuff, which covers them all over:
they Embroider them with black Silk: they are only the or∣dinary
Women, and such as go upon some Intreague, which
wear them; yet sometimes, as I have said, certain <HI>Court-La∣dies</HI>
will go in this Dress. The <HI>Cavallero's</HI> also alight and
walk, and say some odd thing or other to them, but they meet
with their Match.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Berka,</HI> the <HI>German</HI> Envoy, told me, that
t'other night as he was at Supper, and his Windows (because
of the cold) being shut, some body knocked at the Lattice of
his Hall, he sent to see who it was; they found three Wo∣men
in white Mantles, who desired to have the Windows o∣pened
that they might see him. He sent them word, that they
would be more conveniently in the Hall. They came in all
concealed, and placed themselves in a corner, and so stood all
the while he was at Table. He intreated them (but in
vain) to sit down and eat some Sweetmeats, but they would
neither do one nor t'other; but after they had said a great ma∣ny
merry things to him, in which they abundantly shewed a
strange quickness of Wit, they went away. He discovered
that these were the Dutchesses <HI>de Medina Celi, de Ossona</HI> and
<PB N="172" REF="175"/>
<HI>Ducado,</HI> having seen them at their own Houses; for <HI>Ambas∣sadors</HI>
have the priviledge sometimes to go to the great Ladies,
and to give them a visit of <HI>Audience;</HI> but he was willing to have
yet a greater certainty, and therefore caused them to be fol∣lowed,
and they were seen to go into one of their Houses by a
false Door, at which some of their Women waited for them.
These little Disguises are not always attended with over much
Innocence.</P>
<P>As to the Men, when Night comes, they walk a foot in the
<HI>Prado,</HI> they make up to the Coaches in which they see Wo∣men,
and leaning upon the Bouts, they either throw Flowers,
or sprinkle sweet Water upon them, and when they are per∣mitted,
they go into the Coach to them.</P>
<P>But as to the meeting on <HI>May-day.</HI> It is certainly a great
pleasure to see the Citizens and the People how they sit▪ some
upon the young Corn, some upon the sides of the <HI>Mansana∣rez,</HI>
others playing at <HI>Ombre,</HI> and others either with their
Wives, Children, Friends or Mistresses, basking themselves
in the Sun; some are eating of a Sallad with Leeks and Oni∣ons,
and others, hard Eggs; and others Gammon of Bacon,
and even <HI>Galinas de Loche,</HI> which are Sea-Hens, and every ex∣cellent.
They all drink Water like Ducks, and play either up∣on
the Guittar or Harp. The <HI>King</HI> came there with <HI>Don John,</HI>
the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> the Constable <HI>de Castile,</HI> and the
Duke <HI>de Pastratie.</HI> I only saw his Coach of green Oyl-cloth
drawn by six pyed Horses, the finest in the World; and all co∣vered
over with Gold-spangles, and knots of Rose-coloured
Ribon: The Curtains of the Coach were of green Damask,
with a fine gold Fringe, but so close drawn, that one could per∣ceive
nothing but through the little Glasses on the sides of the
Coach. It is the Custom, when the King passes by, to stand
still, and in respect, to draw the Curtains; but we, according
to the <HI>French</HI> Fashion, let ours be open, and were satisfied in
making a very low Bow. The <HI>King</HI> took notice of a Spanil∣bitch
I had in my Arms, and which the Marchioness <HI>de Alvi,</HI>
who is a very pretty Lady, desired me to carry to the Con∣stable
of <HI>Colonna's</HI> Lady; and as I loved it mightily, she sent
it to me very often. The <HI>King</HI> sent the Count <HI>de los Arcos,</HI>
Captain of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Guards, to ask me for it; he came up
to the Coach side on Horse-back. I immediately gave it to
him, and the Creature had the Honour to be made much of by
his Majesty, was mightily pleased with the little Bells about her
Neck, and the Buckles upon her Ears. He had a Bitch which
he loved extreamly, and he sent to ask me if I would be wil∣ling
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
that he should keep mine for <HI>Daraxa,</HI> which was the
Name of his.</P>
<P>You may easily imagine, Dear Cousin, what answer I made.
He returned me the Spaniel, but without either her Collar or
Buckles, and he ordered the Count <HI>de los Arcos</HI> to give me a
gold Box full of Pastrils, which he had about him, and desired
me to keep it. It is but of a small value, but coming from
such a hand, I mightily esteem it.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Don John,</HI> who is my Kinswoman's Friend, which ob∣tain'd
this mark of the <HI>King</HI>'s bounty to me; for he knew of
my being in <HI>Madrid,</HI> though I had not had the Honour yet to
see him.</P>
<P>Two days afterwards, as I was all alone in my apartment,
busie in painting a small Piece, I saw come in, a Man whom I
knew not; but one, who by the air of his Face, I could easily
judge to be of Quality: He told me, that not having met with
my Kinswoman, he was resolved to tarry till she came, for
he had Letters to give her. After some little Discourse, he
gave occasion to talk of <HI>Don John,</HI> and told me that he doubt∣ed
not that I frequently saw him. I reply'd, that indeed,
since my arrival, this <HI>Prince</HI> came often to visit my Kinswo∣man,
but he never ask'd for me. The reason of that perhaps,
adds he, was, because you were sick that day. I was not sick,
reply'd I, and I should have been very glad both to have seen
and heard him, for I have been told both good and ill of him,
and I have a mind to know whether they do him right or
wrong. I have signify'd my desire to my Kinswoman, but
she told me, there was no way to gratifie me, for he was so
devout, that he would speak to no Woman. Is it possible,
says he, in smiling, that his Devotion should so much disturb
his Mind? for my part, I am confident he ask'd for you, and
was assur'd that you were ill of a Feaver; Of a Feaver! cry'd
I, that's very strange! I beseech ye, how do you know it?
But just then, my Kinswoman came in, she was extreamly a∣mazed
to find <HI>Don John</HI> with me, and so was I, for I little
thought it was he. He told her several times, that he knew
not how to pardon her for the Idea she had given me of him,
that he was no Bigot, and that he was perswaded, true Devo∣tion
did not make a Man rude and inhumane.</P>
<P>I think him very handsome, of a noble Carriage, very well
bred, and extream witty, and of a mighty quickness of Mind.
As my Kinswoman has a great share of Wit, so she clear'd
her self well enough from what he taxt her with. But when
he was gone, she was ready to eat me for anger, because I
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>
deny'd having had a Feaver. I desired her to excuse me,
because I was ignorant what she had said to him, and that
I could not <HI>divine:</HI> She answer'd me, that at Court, one must
either be able to <HI>divine,</HI> or else they would act a very silly
part.</P>
<P>She ask'd the Prince, if it was true, that the <HI>Queen</HI>-Mother
had writ to the <HI>King,</HI> and beg'd that she might see him, and
that he had refus'd her. He agreed it was, and also, that that
was the only reason which hindred his Majesty from going to
<HI>Aranjus,</HI> lest she should come to him there, contrary to the
Prohibition for her not stirring out of <HI>Toleda.</HI> What, my
<HI>Lord,</HI> said I, will not the <HI>King</HI> see the <HI>Queen</HI> his Mother? Say
rather, replies he, that 'tis <HI>State Policy</HI> which forbids <HI>Sovereigns
to follow their Inclinations when they do not suit with the publick
good.</HI> We have a constant Maxim in the <HI>Council of State,</HI> al∣ways
to consult the Spirit of <HI>Charles</HI> V. in all difficult Matters;
we enquire what he would have done upon such an occasion,
and that we endeavour to practice in our turn. For my
part, I am of Opinion with a great many others, that he
ought not to see his Mother, since it was fit for him to banish
her; and the <HI>King</HI> himself is so fully perswaded of this, that
he answered her, it could not be. But it was not difficult for
me to see, that <HI>Don John</HI> fitted the Genius of <HI>Charles</HI> V. to his
own.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> is gone to <HI>Buen Retiro,</HI> where I had the Honour
to see him first, at a Play, for he open'd the Lattice of his
Box to look at us in ours, because we were drest after the
<HI>French</HI> way. The <HI>Danish</HI> Ambassador's Lady was drest after
the same fashion, and so handsome, that he told the Prince of
<HI>Monteleon,</HI> he was mightily taken with us, only it was pitty
that our Heads were not trim'd, and our Bodies clad after the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Mode; that the more he look'd at the <HI>French</HI> Ladies
Cloths, the more they displeas'd him, that the Mens did not
so much offend him. The <HI>Opera</HI> of <HI>Alcinus</HI> was acted before
him, but I gave little Attention to it, looking so earnestly at
the <HI>King,</HI> that I might be able to describe him to you. I must
tell you then, that his Complexion is delicate and fair, he has
a broad Fore-head, his Eyes are fine, and have a great deal of
sweetness in them; his Face is very long and narrow, his
Lips like those of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> are very thick, and his
Mouth is wide, his Nose is very much hawk't, his Chin is
sharp and turns up, he has a great Head of Hair, and fair,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank and put behind his Ears, his Stature is pretty high,
straight and slender, his Legs are small, and almost all of a
<PB N="175" REF="178"/>
thickness: He is naturally very kind and good, he is inclin'd
to Clemency, and of the <HI>great variety of Council he has given
him, he takes that which is most for the advantage of his People,
for he loves them extreamly.</HI> He is not of a Vindicative Spirit,
he is sober, liberal and pious; his Inclinations are Vertuous, he
is of an even temper, and of easie access: He hath not had all
that Education which is requisite to form the Mind, but yet
he does not want any neither. I will now note some of his
merry Humours which have been told me, and though they
are of no great importance, yet it may still be pleasant to
know them.</P>
<P>It is not long since the Lady <HI>Connestable de Collona,</HI> who is
in a <HI>Religious House</HI> at St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> got out of the <HI>Abbey</HI> from
whence she had made several Escapes; the <HI>Nuns</HI> tyr'd with
her proceeding, resolved to admit her no more; and indeed
the last time she endeavoured to get in, they plainly told her,
that she might either betake her self to the World, or choose
some other place than their House for a Retirement. She was
extreamly offended at this refusal, which by no means suited
with a Person of her Quality and Merit. She got some of her
Friends to apply themselves to the <HI>King,</HI> and he sent Orders to
the <HI>Abbess</HI> to receive her in again. The <HI>Abbess</HI> and all the
<HI>Nuns</HI> were obstinate in their refusal, saying, that they would
themselves represent their Reasons to his Majesty, and in their
Persons go to him. When this Answer of the <HI>Nuns,</HI> was re∣lated
to the <HI>King,</HI> he burst out a laughing, and said, It will be
pretty sport to see this <HI>Procession</HI> of the <HI>Nuns,</HI> who will come
along singing, <HI>Libera nos Domine de la Contestabile.</HI> But yet
they did not go, and chose rather to obey, which is always
safest.</P>
<P>Some days ago it rain'd and thunder'd most terribly; the
<HI>King,</HI> who sometimes pleases himself in playing little Tricks
with his <HI>Courtiers,</HI> commanded the Marquis <HI>d' Astorgas</HI> to wait
for him upon the Terras Walk in the Palace. The good old
Man said to him in smiling, <HI>Sir, will it be long before you come?</HI>
Why do you ask, said the <HI>King?</HI> that your Majesty, reply'd
he, may send a Coffin to put me in, for there's no likelyhood
that I should be able to contend with such Weather as this▪
Go, go <HI>Marquess,</HI> says the <HI>King,</HI> I'll come to you. The <HI>Mar∣quess</HI>
went out, and without any Scruple, stept into his Coach
and went directly home. Two hours afterwards, the <HI>King</HI>
said, <HI>for certain the good old Man is wet to the Skin, let him
be call'd in, I have a mind to see him in such a Condition.</HI> But
they told the <HI>King</HI> that he did not expose himself at all,
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
upon which he said, that he was not only old, but very
wise.</P>
<P>There was taken a little while since uear the Palace disguis'd
in Man's Clothes, one of the handsomest <HI>Misses</HI> of <HI>Madrid,</HI> she
had set upon her Gallant, of whom she believed she had cause
to complain, he knowing her by her Voice and the manner of
handling her Sword, would not make use of his to defend him∣self,
so far from it, that he opened his Wast-coat, and gave
her free leave to thrust at him, thinking perhaps, that she ei∣ther
was not angry, or had not Courage enough to do it; but
he deceiv'd himself, for with all her strength she made a Pass
at him, which made him drop drown, she no sooner perceiv'd
his Blood, but she threw her self upon the ground, and cri'd
out most dreadfully, tore her Skin off her Face, and pull'd
her Hair off her Head: the People which were got about her
very well perceiv'd by her Looks, and her long Hair, that she
was a Woman, the Officers of Justice seiz'd her, and some
<HI>Lords</HI> passing by at that time, seeing her, related to the <HI>King</HI>
what had happen'd: He had a mind to speak with her, she was
brought before him; Art thou she, said he, to her, that has
wounded a Man near the Palace, Yes, <HI>Sir,</HI> answered she, I
was resolv'd to be revenged of an ungrateful Man; he promis'd
I should have his Heart, yet I am assured he gave it since
to another. But why art thou so afflicted, repli'd he, since thou
hast got thy Revenge? Ah, <HI>Sir,</HI> continued she, in seeking my
Revenge, I have punisht my self, I am now upon the brink of
Despair, I beseech your Majesty to command them to put me
to death, for I have deserv'd the severest Torment. The <HI>King</HI>
took pity of her, and turning to those about him, Well, really,
said he, I can hardly believe that there's in the World so mi∣serable
a State, as to love and not to be beloved. Go, said he,
thou hast more Love than Reason, But endeavour to be wiser
for the future, and do not abuse that Liberty I restore to thee.
And thus she withdrew without being carri'd to the Place where
they keep miserable Wretches that have led ill Lives.</P>
<P>All this that I have told you of the <HI>King</HI> has carri'd me from
the <HI>Opera</HI> of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> the first time I saw it was, with so much
wandring of Mind, that when I saw it again, it appear'd
quite new to me, there was never seen more sorry Machines,
they m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de the <HI>Gods</HI> come down on Horseback upon a Beam
which reacht from one end of the Theater to the other; the
Sun shin'd by the help o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a dozen of oyl'd Paper Lanthorns, in
each of which there was a Lamp: when <HI>Alcinous</HI> practis'd her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>chantments, and invok'd the <HI>Demons,</HI> they came conveni∣ently
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>
out of <HI>Hell</HI> by Ladders: <HI>Le Gratiosa;</HI> that is to say, the
<HI>Jack-Pudding</HI> said a thousand Impertinences, the Singer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had
indifferent good voices, only they sang too much in the Throat.
Heretofore there was a Liberty for several sorts of People to
come into the great Room, but this Custom is chang'd, and
now there's only suffer'd to come in, the Great <HI>Lords,</HI> and at
the most, <HI>Tituladoes</HI> and the <HI>Knights</HI> of the Three <HI>Military</HI>
Orders. This Room is certainly a very fair one, it is all paint∣ed
and gilt; the Boxes, as I have already told you, are al∣ways
barr'd with Lattices like those we have at the <HI>Opera;</HI> but
they reach from top to bottom, and look as if they were
Chambers, that side where the <HI>King</HI> sits is magnificent. As
for the rest, the finest Comedy in the World (I mean those
that are acted in the City) very often receives it Fate from the
weak Fancy of some ignorant Wretch or other. But there is
one particularly, and a Shoomaker, which decides the matter,
and who hath gain'd such an absolute Authority so to do, thar
when the <HI>Poets</HI> have made their Plays, they go to him, and as
'twere, sue for his Approbation, they read to him their Plays,
the Shoomaker with grave Looks thereupon, utters abundance
of Nonsence, which nevertheless the poor <HI>Poet</HI> is forced to put
up, after all, if he happens to be at the first Acting of it, every
body has their Eyes upon the Behaviour and Actions of this
pitiful Fellow, the Young People of what Quality soever imi∣tate
him. If he Yawns, they yawn, if he laughs so do they.
In a word, sometimes he grows angry or weary, and then
takes a little whistle and falls a whistling, at the same time you
shall hear a hundred whistles, which make so shrill a noise that
'tis enough to confound the heads of the Spectators. By this
time our poor <HI>Poet</HI> is quite ruin'd, All his Study and Pains
having been at the Mercy of a Blockhead, according as he was
in a good or bad humour.</P>
<P>In this Play-house, there is a certain part of it, which is
call'd <HI>La Casuela,</HI> it is like the Amphitheater, all the Women
that are not over-vertuous sit there, and thither the great
Lords go to talk with them, sometimes they make such a noise
that they would outdo the Thunder, and they say things so ve∣ry
pleasant, that they would make one die with laughing: for
their Wit is free from all restraint of Decency. Besides, they
are inform'd of all things that happen in the Town; and if
they had a merry Jest to break upon their <HI>Majesties,</HI> they had
rather be half hanged than lose it.</P>
<P>It may be said, that the Women <HI>Players</HI> are a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in this
Court, there's hardly any that is not the Mistress of some great
<PB N="178" REF="181"/>
Person, and for whom several Duels have been fought, and a
great many People kill'd. I do not know how charming their
Discourse may be, but I am sure their Persons are the ugliest
in the World, they are extravagantly expensive▪ and sooner
must a whole Family perish with Hunger and Thirst, than one
of those beggarly <HI>Players</HI> should want the least Superfluity.</P>
<P>We are now in a Season that's troublesome enough, for
'tis the Custom here to put their Mules to Grass, and every
body almost walks a foot. At this time you can see nothing
but Grass brought from all Parts, and the greatest <HI>Lord</HI> hardly
keeps two Mules to draw him, for this reason they often go on
Horseback.</P>
<P>Those Horses which have been at the <HI>Bull-baitings,</HI> and are
good for these sort of Sports, are dear, and much in request.
The King had a mind to divert himself, and ordered a <HI>Bull-Feast</HI>
to be on the Twenty second of this Month. I was very
glad of it, for though I had heard much talk of them, I never
saw any yet; and the young Count <HI>De Conismark,</HI> who is a
<HI>Swede,</HI> would <HI>Taurise,</HI> or Bait the Bull for a young Lady of my
Acquaintance. So that I was the more eager to go to the <HI>Pla∣ca-Major,</HI>
where my Kinswoman, as she was a <HI>Titulada</HI> of
<HI>Castille,</HI> had her Balcony set up with a <HI>Canopy,</HI> a Carpet and
Cushion of State. To give you a particular Account of all that
passes at these <HI>Feasts,</HI> I must tell you, that after the <HI>King</HI> has
appointed one of them, there are some Cows, which they call
<HI>Mandarines,</HI> led into the Forests and Mountains of <HI>Andalousia.</HI>
It is known that the most furious Bulls are in these Places, and
as they are train'd up for this purpose, so they run into the
Wood; the Bulls spy them out, and eagerly court them, those
fly and these pursue them▪ and so are decoy'd into certain Pal∣lisadoes,
set on purpose along the way, which is sometimes
Thirty or Forty Leagues in Length, several Men are armed
with Half Pikes and well mounted, hunt these Bulls and hin∣der
them from coming back, but it is not seldom that they are
forc'd to fight them within these Pales, and frequently they
are kill'd or wounded.</P>
<P>There are People placed all along the Road, which bring ad∣vice
when the <HI>Bulls</HI> will arrive at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and there also they
set Pallisadoes in the Street to prevent any Mischief.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarines,</HI> who are real traitors, go constantly before,
and the poor Bulls quietly follow after into the very place de∣sign'd
for baiting them, where there are great Stables built on
purpose with Shutters, contriv'd to keep them in, there are
sometimes 30, 40, or 50 together, this Stable has two Doors,
<PB N="179" REF="182"/>
the <HI>Mandarines</HI> go in at one, and escape at the other; and
when the Bulls think to follow them still they are hindred by
a Trap, in which they are caught.</P>
<P>After they have rested a few hours, they are one after ano∣ther
let out of the Stable into the great <HI>Place,</HI> where there are
a great many young, lusty, strong Peasants, some of which
take the Bull by the horns, and others by the tail, and because
they mark him upon the Buttock with a hot iron, and slit his
ears, they call them <HI>Hiradores.</HI> This is not so easily done,
for there are frequently divers Persons kill'd, and this is the
beginning of the <HI>Shew,</HI> which always mightily delights the Peo∣ple,
whether it be upon the Account that Blood is shed, or
else, that they love to see something extraordinary, and at first
sight surprizing, and which afterwards furnishes with matter
for long Reflections; but though unlucky Accidents do happen
at these Feasts, yet it does not appear that they take any War∣ning
from them, for they are still forward to expose them∣selves
at every Baiting that's made.</P>
<P>The Bulls are fed, and the best of them are pickt out for the
Baiting; they can even distinguish those that are either Sons
or Brothers of those Bulls which made a great slaughter in for∣mer
<HI>Feasts,</HI> they tie to their horns a long Ribbon, and by the
colour of that every body knows them again, and recites the
History of their Ancestors; that the Grandsire or great Grand∣sire
of these Bulls bravely kill'd such and such a one, and they
expect no less from those that then appear.</P>
<P>When they have sufficiently rested, the <HI>Placa Major</HI> is co∣vered
with Sand, and round it are placed Bars as high as a Man,
upon which are painted the Arms of the <HI>King</HI> and his King∣doms.
I fancy this <HI>Place</HI> to be larger than the <HI>Place Royal</HI> at
<HI>Paris,</HI> it is longer than it is broad, and about it are Houses
built upon Pillars and Arches like Towers, five Stories high,
and to each a row of Balconies, into which there are great
Glass-doors. The <HI>King</HI>'s stand more forward than the rest, is
more spacious, and all guilt. It is in the middle of one of the
sides, with a Canopy over it; over against it are the <HI>Ambas∣sadours</HI>
Balconies who have a place when the <HI>King</HI> goes to Chap∣pel,
that is the <HI>Nuncio,</HI> the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Ambassadour, that of
<HI>France,</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> the <HI>Venetian,</HI> and that of <HI>Savoy;</HI> those of
<HI>England, Holland, Swedeland, Denmark</HI> and other <HI>Protestant</HI>
Princes, have none there. The Councils of <HI>Castille Arragon,</HI>
the <HI>Inquisition, Italy, Flanders,</HI> the <HI>Indies,</HI> the <HI>Orders, War,</HI> the
<HI>Croisado,</HI> and of the <HI>Finances,</HI> are on the right hand of the <HI>King:</HI>
they are distinguisht by their Arms upon their Crimson Velvet
<PB N="180" REF="183"/>
Carpets which are all embroider'd with Gold. After these, are
placed the City Companies, the Judges, the <HI>Grandees</HI> and <HI>Titu∣lados,</HI>
according to their several Degrees, and at the <HI>King</HI>'s
Charge, or else at the City's, who hire these Balconies of pri∣vate
Persons that dwell there.</P>
<P>For all those I have now nam'd the <HI>King</HI> makes a Collation;
and it is given in very neat Baskets, to the Women as well as
the Men, it consists of Fruits dry'd, Sweet-meats, and Water
cool'd with Ice, of Gloves, Ribbons, Fans, Pastiles, Silk-stockings,
and Garters, insomuch that these Feasts always cost
above a hundred thousand Crowns, and this Expence is defray'd
out of the Fines and Forfeitures adjudg'd to the <HI>King,</HI> or to the
City, this is a Fund which must not be medl'd with, tho' 'twere
to save the Kingdom from the greatest Danger, the doing of
it might cause a Sedition. So bewitcht are the People with
this kind of Pleasure.</P>
<P>From the Level of the Pavement to the first Balcony, there
are Scaffolds made for the rest of the People, they give from
Fifteen to twenty Pistols for a Balcony; and there is not any
but what are let, and adorn'd with rich Carpets, and fine Ca∣nopies.
The People are not seated under the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony,
that Place is fill'd with his Guards, there's only Three Gates
open into it, through which the Persons of Quality pass in their
richest Coaches, and particularly the <HI>Ambassadors;</HI> and they
make several turns round it, a little before the <HI>King</HI> comes.
The <HI>Cavaliers</HI> salute the Ladies who stand in the Balconies,
without being cover'd with their Mantles or Vails, they are
deck'd out with all their Jewels, and whatever they have that
is finest. One can see nothing but extream rich Stuffs, with
Tapistry, Cushions and Carpets, all of rais'd work in Gold. I
never saw any thing more glorious, the King's Balcony is hung
round with Green and Gold Curtains, which he draws when he
will not be seen.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> came about four a clock, and immediately all the
Coaches went out of the Place. Generally the Ambassadour of
<HI>France</HI> is the most taken notice of, because he and all his Train
are dress'd after the <HI>French</HI> mode; and he is the only <HI>Ambassa∣dor</HI>
that has this Priviledge here, for the others are in the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Dress. There's five or six Coaches go before the <HI>King</HI>'s, in
which are the Officers, the Gentlemen and Pages of his Cham∣ber.
The Coach of Honour, in which there goes no body,
marches immediately before his Majesty's own, whose Coachman
and Postillion are always barehead, a Footman carrying their
Hats; the Coach is surrounded with Foot-Guards. Those which
<PB N="181" REF="184"/>
they call the Life-Guard have Partisans, and march very near
the Coach, and next the Boots go a great many of the <HI>King</HI>'s
Pages, cloath'd in Black, and without Swords, which is the on∣ly
mark to know them from other Pages. As the Ladies that
are design'd to be about the young <HI>Queen,</HI> are already nam'd,
so they all came under the Conduct of the Dutchess of <HI>Terra
Nova,</HI> in the <HI>King</HI>'s Coaches, they march by the Mens Bouts of
the highest Quality, some on Foot that they might be nearer,
others mounted on the finest Horses in the World, train'd up
for that purpose, and which they call <HI>Horses of Motion.</HI> That
they may perform this piece of Gallantry, they must have leave
from their Mistresses, otherwise 'tis a great Blemish to their
Reputation, and even engages the Ladies Kindred in Trouble,
for they take their Honour to be concern'd in this Liberty:
But when she approves of it, they may practise all the pleasant
Humours for which these sort of <HI>Feasts</HI> minister occasion. But
though they need fear nothing from the Ladies they serve, nor
their Relations, yet they are not freed from all uneasiness, for
the <HI>Duegno</HI>'s or Women of Honour, of which there's too great
a Provision in each Coach, and the <HI>Guardadamas</HI> which go on
Horseback, are troublesome Observers▪ hardly can one begin to
discourse, but these old Haggs will draw the Curtain, and the
<HI>Guardadamas</HI> will tell you, that that Love which is fullest of
Respect is the most discreet, so that very often one must be
content to let the Eyes speak, and to sigh so loud, that one
may be heard at a Distance.</P>
<P>All things being thus dispos'd, the Captain of the Guards and
the other Officers mounted upon very fine Horses, enter the
Place, at the Head of the <HI>Spanish, German,</HI> and <HI>Burgundian</HI>
Guards, they are cloathed in Yellow Velvet or Sattin, which is
the Livery of the <HI>King,</HI> trim'd with tufted crimsom Galoon
mixt with Gold and Silver. The Yeomen of the Guard, which
I call the Life-Guard, wear only a short Cloak of the same Live∣ry,
over black Cloaths. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> wear Breeches tuckt up
after the old way. The <HI>Germans,</HI> which are called <HI>Tudesques</HI>
wear them like the <HI>Switzers,</HI> they stand in Ranks near the
<HI>King</HI>'s Balcony, while the two Captains and the two Lieute∣nants,
who carry each of them a Staff of Command in their
Hands, and are follow'd by a great many Liveries, march all
four in a Rank at the head of the Guards, several times round
the Place, to give the necessary Orders, and to salute the La∣dies
of their Acquaintance; their Horses curvet and bound con∣tinually,
they are covered with knots of Ribbons, and embroi∣dered
Housings: they are called <HI>Pissadoyes</HI> for Distinction. Up∣on
<PB N="182" REF="185"/>
this day every one of these <HI>Lords</HI> affect to wear that colour
which their Mistresses love most.</P>
<P>When the People are come without the Bars, and are seated
upon their Scaffolds, the place is watered with forty or fifty
Tuns of Water which is brought thither in little Carts. Then
the Captains of the Guards come back, and take their Posts un∣der
the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony, where all the Guards are likewise pla∣ced,
and make a sort of a Fence, standing very close together;
and although the Bulls are sometimes ready to kill them, yet they
must not go back nor stir from their place; they only present to
them the point of their Halberds, and so with a great deal of
hazard defend themselves.</P>
<P>I do assure you that this strange number of People (for every
place is full, even the tops of the Houses as well as the rest) the
Balconies so richly set out, and so many beautiful Women in
them, this great Court, the Guards, and in a word, the whole
place makes one of the finest shews that ever I saw.</P>
<P>As soon as the Guards are possessed of the quarter where the
<HI>King</HI> is, six <HI>Alguazils,</HI> or City Door-keepers enter the place,
each holding a white Rod: Their Horses are excellent, har∣nass'd
after the <HI>Morisco</HI> fashion, and cover'd with little Bells.
Their Habit is white, they wear Plums of Feathers, and put the
best Looks on they can, in so much danger as they are in; for
they are not allow'd to stir out of the <HI>List:</HI> and 'tis their busi∣ness
to fetch the <HI>Knights</HI> that are to fight.</P>
<P>I should tell you, before I proceed any further in this short
Description, that there are certain Laws established for this
sort of <HI>Baiting,</HI> which are call'd <HI>Duelo,</HI> that is, <HI>Duel,</HI> because
one Knight assaults the <HI>Bull,</HI> and fights him in single Combat.
These are some of the things which are observed: One must
be a Gentleman born, and known for such, that he may fight
on Horseback. It is not allowed to draw the Sword upon the
Bull, unless he has insulted over you; they call it insulting
when the Bull breaks or forces the Garrochion or Lance out of
the Hand, or if he make your Hat fall off, or your Cloak, or
has wounded you or your Horse, or any of your Company. In
this case the <HI>Knight</HI> is oblig'd to push his Horse directly upon
the Bull; for this is au <HI>Empenno,</HI> that is to say, an affront that
engages one to be reveng'd, or to dye; and he must give him
<HI>Vna Cachilada,</HI> or a back stroke upon his head or neck. But
if the Horse on which the <HI>Cavellero</HI> rides, refuses to go up to
the Bull, then immediately he alights, and couragiously marches
up a foot to this fierce Animal. The Sword is very short, and
about three fingers broad. The other <HI>Knights</HI> which are there
<PB N="183" REF="186"/>
to fight, are also oblig'd to alight off their Horses and accom∣pany
him, that is under the <HI>Empenno;</HI> but they do not second
him, so as to assist him in the least against his Enemy. If they
all march up in this manner towards the Bull, and he flies to the
other end of the Place instead of tarrying for them, or meeting
them, after they have pursued him some time, they have sa∣tisfied
the Laws of <HI>Duelling.</HI></P>
<P>If there be in the Town any Horses that have been at a <HI>Bait∣ing,</HI>
and are dextrous at it, though they do not know the Ow∣ners,
yet they'll borrow them; nay, though they do not desire
to sell them, nor the others in a condition to buy them, yet
they never refuse them. If by mischance the Horse is killed,
and they offer to pay for him, it is not accepted; because, to
receive Money upon such an occasion would not be agreeable to
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Generosity. Nevertheless, it would vex a Man to
have a Horse that he had taken pains to breed up, without any
more ado taken from him by the first Stranger, and through
his means be kill'd. This sort of Combat is reckoned so dange∣rous,
that the <HI>Indulgencies</HI> are expos'd in several Churches for
those days, because of the great <HI>Massacre</HI> that is then made.
Several <HI>Popes</HI> would have quite abolish'd such barbarous sights,
but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> begged the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> so earnestly to let
them continue, that their Humour has been comply'd with and
to this day they are tolerated.</P>
<P>The first day I was there, the <HI>Alguazils</HI> came to the Gate,
which is at the end of the <HI>List,</HI> to fetch the six <HI>Knights</HI> (of
whom the Count <HI>de Conismark</HI> was one)▪ which offered them∣selves
to Combat. Their Horses are handsome to admiration,
and most richly harnass'd: Besides those they ride on, they had
each of them a dozen led by Grooms, with as many Mules
loaded with <HI>Rejones</HI> or <HI>Garochons,</HI> which are, as I have said, Laun∣ces
made of very dry Fir, about four or five foot long, painted
and gilt, and the Iron-work very well polish'd; and the Mules
were covered with Velvet Cloths of the same colour of the
Combatants, with their Arms embroider'd in Gold: This is
not practis'd at all <HI>Feasts,</HI> when the City orders one, there's
far less Magnificence; but as the <HI>King</HI> commanded this, and
it was upon his Marriage, nothing was omitted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cavalleros</HI> were drest in black, embroider'd either with
Gold and Silver, Silk or Bugles, they had white Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes of feathers
spotted with several colours, and a rich knot of Diamonds,
with a Hatband of the same. They had Scarfs, some white,
and other crimson, blew and yellow, embroidered with Gold.
Some wore them round their Wast, others over their Shoul∣ders
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="184" REF="189"/>
like a Belt, and others about their Arm; these last were
narrow and short, without doubt their Mistresses presented
them, for commonly they run to please them, and to shew that
there's no danger to which they would not expose themselves
for their diversion. They had also a black Cloak which wrapt
them about. But the ends being thrown behind them, it did
not hinder her Arms: they wore little white Buskins, with
long guilt Spurs, which have only one sharp point after the
<HI>Moors</HI> fashion; they also sit a Horse like them, which is called
<HI>Cavalgas a la gineta.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cavalleros</HI> were handsomly mounted, and lookt grace∣fully
enough for this Country; they were nobly born, and eve∣ry
one had forty Foot-men, some cloath'd in gold Mohair trim'd
with Lace; others in Carnation-colour'd Brocado, stript with
Gold and Silver, and the rest in some other fashion. Every one
of them was drest like a Stranger, whether 'twas <HI>Turk, Hunga∣rian,
Moor, Indian,</HI> or wild People. Several of the foot-men
carried a bundle of these <HI>Garachons</HI> I have mentioned, and this
lookt very well: Thus with all their Train they crost the <HI>Plaza
Mayor,</HI> conducted by the six <HI>Alguazils,</HI> and the Trumpets
sounding. They came before the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony, and made a
profound Reverence to him, and desired leave of him to fight
the <HI>Bulls,</HI> which he granted them, and wisht them Victory.
Then the Trumpets every where began to sound again, and this
is done, as 'twere, in defiance of the Bulls. All the People fall
a shouting, and repeat <HI>Viva, viva los bravos Cavalleros:</HI> After
this they separate, and salute the Ladies of their Acquaintance.
All the Foot-men go out of the <HI>List,</HI> except two for each
Knight, which are left to carry their <HI>Rejoues;</HI> they keep close
to their Masters, and 'tis very seldom that they forsake them.</P>
<P>Several young Men enter into the place, and they come a
great way off to fight on these days: These I now speak of are
a foot, and not being nobly born, they use no Ceremonies with
them. Whilst one <HI>Cavallero</HI> is fighting, the rest withdraw, but
not out of the Bars; and they do not assault that Bull which
another has undertaken to fight, unless he makes at them. The
first to whom the Bull comes when they are altogether, is he
that fights him. When he has wounded the <HI>Knight,</HI> they cry
out <HI>fileno de Empenno,</HI> that is to say, it is an Obligation upon
such an one to revenge the <HI>Affront</HI> he has received from the
Bull; and indeed Honour engages him, either on Horseback,
or a foot, to attack the Bull, and give him a cut with his
Sword, as I have said, either upon his Head or Throat, without
striking him in any other part. Afterwards he may fight him
<PB N="185" REF="190"/>
as he will, and strike him where he can; but in doing this,
ones Life is a thousand times in danger. When this blow is
given, if the Knights are a foot, they may mount their Hor∣ses.</P>
<P>When the King thought it was time to begin the <HI>Baiting,</HI>
two <HI>Alguazils</HI> come under his Balcony, and he gives to <HI>Don John</HI>
the Keys of the Stable where the Bulls are secur'd; for the King
keeps the Key, and when it must be thrown, he delivers it into
the hands of a <HI>Privado,</HI> or Chief Minister, as a Favour. Im∣mediately
the Trumpets sound, the Timbrels and the Drums,
the Fifes and the Haut-boys, the Flutes and Bag-pipes make a
noise round the Place one after another, and the <HI>Alquazils,</HI>
who are naturally great Cowards, go trembling to open the
Doors where the Bulls are kept. There was a Man hid behind
the door, who shut it as fast as he could, and then by a Ladder
climbed up to the top of the Stable; for 'tis usual with the Bull,
in coming out, to look behind the door, and to begin his Ex∣pedition
by killing, if he can, the Man that stands there: after
that he falls a running with all his might after the <HI>Alguazils,</HI> who
spur their Horses to save themselves, for they are not allow'd to
stand upon their defence, and their best play is to run away.
Those Men which are on foot, throw at him Arrows and very
sharp Darts, which are trim'd with Cutt-paper; these Darts
stick in him in such a manner, that the pain causing him to stir
much makes the Iron enter deeper; besides when he runs,
the Paper makes a noise, and being on fire, vexes him extream∣ly;
his Breath looks like a thick mist about him, his Eyes and
his Nostrils are like fire, he runs swifter than a Race-horse, and
holds it much better; to speak truth, he strikes Terror. The
Knight who is to fight him comes near him, takes a <HI>Rejon,</HI>
holds it like a Ponyard, the Bull makes up to him, he declines
his blow, and thrusts his <HI>Gorachon</HI> at him; the Bull so thrusts it
back, that the Wood being weak, it breaks, immediately his
Foot-men, who holds ten or twelve dozen, present him with
another, which the <HI>Cavallero</HI> thrusts also into his body; with
this the Bull falls a bellowing, grows angry, runs, leaps, and
wo be to them that stand in his way: And if at any time he
is ready to run at a Man, a Cloak or Hat is thrown at him,
and this stops him; or else, one falls down on the Ground, and
the Bull in running, passes over him. They have also great
Figures made of Past-bords, with which they deceive him, and
so gain time to escape. That which helps them further is that
the Bull constantly shuts his Eyes just before he pushes with his
Horns, and they are so quick in that moment to avoid the
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>
blow; but yet this is not so certain, but that a great many
perish.</P>
<P>I saw a <HI>Black,</HI> with a short Poniard, go directly to the Bull,
when he was in the height of his Fury, and between his Horns
thrust it into the very seam of his Skull, which is a place very
soft and easie to be pierced, but withal, very small to hit. This
was one of the boldest and most dextrous blows that can be
imagin'd. The Bull fell down dead upon the spot; and pre∣sently
the Trumpets sounded, and several <HI>Spaniards</HI> ran with
their Swords in their Hands, to cut in pieces the Beast that
was no longer able to hurt them. When a Bull is kill'd, four
<HI>Alguazils</HI> go out to fetch four Mules, which some Grooms,
cloath'd in yellow, and Carnation-colour'd Satin, lead in. They
are covered with Feathers and little silver Bells; they have sil∣ken
Traces, with which they tye the Bull, and so draw him
away; upon which the Trumpets and People make a prodigi∣ous
noise: There were twenty baited the first day. There came
out a furious one which very dangerously wounded <HI>Count Co∣nismark</HI>
in his Leg, and yet the force of the blow did not
light upon him, but upon his Horse, whom it burst, he quickly
got off him, and though he is no <HI>Spaniard,</HI> yet he would not
be excus'd from any of the Laws: It would have drawn pity
from any body to see one of the finest Horses in the World in
such a condition; he ran violently about the place, striking
fire with his feet, and kill'd a Man with a blow upon his Head
and Breast: The great Rayle was open'd for him, and he went
out. As for the <HI>Count,</HI> as soon as he was wounded, a very fine
<HI>Spanish</HI> Lady, who believ'd that he fought for her sake, stood
forward in her Balcony, and with her Handkerchief made seve∣ral
signs, in all likelihood to encourage him, but he did not
seem to need being animated; and although he had lost abun∣dance
of Blood, and was forc'd to lean upon one of his Foot-men,
who held him up, yet with great fierceness he advanc'd
with his Sword in his hand, made a shift to give a very great
wound to the Bull on his Head; and then presently turning
himself towards that side where this young Lady, for whom
he fought, was, he kiss'd his Sword, and suffer'd himself to be
carry'd away by his People half dead.</P>
<P>But you must not think that these sort of accidents interrupt
the <HI>Feasts,</HI> 'tis said, that it will not end but by the King's Or∣der;
so that when any <HI>Knight</HI> is wounded, the others accom∣pany
him to the Bars, and immediately they return to fight.
There was a <HI>Biscanier</HI> so bold, as to throw himself off his Horse
upon the back of the Bull, held him by his Horn, and in spight of
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
all the endeavours of the Animal to throw him off, yet the <HI>Bis∣caneer</HI>
set upon him for above a quarter of an hour, and broke
one of his Horns. If the Bulls defend themselves too long, and
that the King would have others come out, (for fresh ones af∣ford
more delight, because every one has his particular manner
of fighting) they turn loose some <HI>English</HI> Dogs; these are not
so big as is generally seen there, but 'tis a Breed something like
those the <HI>Spaniards</HI> carry'd into the <HI>Indies</HI> when they con∣quer'd▪
them; they are small and low, but so strong, that
when they once seize the Throat, you may sooner cut them in
pieces than make them let go their hold. They are very fre∣quently
kill'd, the Bull takes them upon his Horns, and tosses
them up in the Air like Foot-balls; sometimes they hamstring
the Bull with certain Irons made cross-wise, which they put at
the end of a long Pole, and this they call <HI>Jaretar al toro.</HI></P>
<P>There was another <HI>Cavallero</HI> under the <HI>Empenno,</HI> because in
fighting his Hat fell off; he did not alight, but drew his
Sword, and pushing his Horse upon the Bull which expected
him, gave him a Wound in his Neck; but as it was a slight
one, so it serv'd only to enrage him the more: He tore up the
Earth with his Feet, he roar'd, and he leapt about like a Stag.
I cannot well describe to you this Combat, nor the Acclamations
of every body, the claping of hands, nor the multitude of Hand∣kerchiefs
which are thrown up in the air, for an Expression
of Admiration, some crying out, <HI>Victor, Victor,</HI> and others <HI>Ha
Toro, Ha Toro,</HI> the more to excite the Bulls fury. Neither can I
tell you my particular disturbance, and how my Heart fail'd me
every time I saw these terrible Creatures ready to kill those
brave <HI>Cavallero's:</HI> These things are equally impossible to me.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Toledian,</HI> both young and handsome, which could
not avoid being wounded by the horns of the Bull, who toss'd
him up very high, he immediately died; there were two others
mortally wounded, and four Horses either kill'd or desperately
hurt, and yet every body said, it had not been a <HI>fine Baiting,</HI>
because there was so little Blood shed; and to have been such,
there should have been at the least, ten Men kill'd upon the
spot. It is hard to describe the Dexterity of the <HI>Cavalleros</HI> in
fighting, and that of the Horses in avoiding the Bull. They'll
turn sometimes an hour about him, and tho' they be not a foot
distant from him, yet he is not able to touch them, but when
he does hit them, he wounds them cruelly. The King threw
Fifteen Pistols to the <HI>Black</HI> that kill'd the Bull with his <HI>Ponyard,</HI>
and he gave as much to one that had subdu'd another, and said,
he would remember the Knights that had fought.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="195"/>
I observ'd a <HI>Castillian,</HI> who knew not how to defend himself,
jump upon a Bull, as nimble as a Bird. These <HI>Feasts</HI> are fine,
great and magnificent; 'tis a noble Sight, and costs abundance;
One cannot give a just Description of it, it must be seen to be
well understood. But I assure you that all this did not please
me; Do but think if a Man that is very dear to you, should be
so rash to go and expose himself against a furious Beast, and
that for your sake, (for generally that's the Motive) you see
him brought back weltering in his Blood, and half dead, is it
possible I say, for you or any one, to approve of such Actions and
these Customs? Nay suppose one had no particular concern,
would one desire to be present at such Sports, that cost the
Lives of so many Men? For my part, I wonder that in a King∣dom,
where their King bears the name of <HI>Catholick,</HI> there should
be such barbarous Diversions permitted. I am satisfi'd that 'tis
very ancient, because they derive it from the <HI>Moors;</HI> but yet
methinks this, as well as divers other Customs which they have
from those <HI>Infidels</HI> ought to be entirely abolisht.</P>
<P><HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> observing me very much disturbed and uneasie
during the <HI>Baiting,</HI> and taking notice, that I was sometimes as
pale as death, I was so much frighted to see some of those kill'd
which fought, said to me in smiling, what would you have
done Madam, if you had seen what had happen'd some years
ago? A <HI>Cavallero</HI> of worth, passionately lov'd a young Woman,
who was only a Jeweller's Daughter, but a perfect Beauty, and
was to have a great Estate. This <HI>Cavallero</HI> having understood,
that the most furious Bulls of the Mountains were taken, and
thinking it would be a very glorious Action to vanquish them,
resolved to <HI>Taurize</HI> as they call it; and for that end desired leave
of his Mistress. She was so surprized at the bare proposal only
which he made, that she swooned away, and by all that Power
which he had given her over himself, she charged him not to
think of it, as he valued his Life. But in spite of this Charge
he believed he could not give a more ample proof of his Love,
and therefore privately, caus'd all things necessary to be got rea∣dy
in order thereunto. But as industrious as he was to hide his
design from his Mistress, she was informed of it, and used all
means to disswade him from it. In fine, the day of this <HI>Feast</HI> be∣ing
come, he conjur'd her to be there, and told her, that her
very presence would be sufficient to make him conquer, and to
acquire a Glory, which would render him yet more worthy of
her. Your Love, says she, is more ambitious than 'tis kind, and
mine is more kind than 'tis ambitious. Go where you think
Glory calls you, you have a mind I should be there, you will
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
fight before me; well, I do assure you, that I will be there,
but yet perhaps my presence will afford you more matter o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Trouble than Emulation. However he left her, and went to
the <HI>Placa Major</HI> where there was already a mighty Assembly,
but scarce had he begun to defend himself against the fierce
Bull which assaulted him, when a Country Youth threw a dart
at this Terrible Creature, which pierced him so deep, that it put
him to a great deal of pain. He immediately left the <HI>Cavallero</HI>
that was fighting him, and roaring ran directly after him that
wounded him, this Youth thus frighted would have saved him∣self,
when his Cap which covered his head fell off, and then the
loveliest and the longest hair which could be seen appeared up∣on
his shoulders, and this discovered it to be a Maid of about
Fifteen or sixteen Years of Age. Fear had put her in such a
Trembling, that she could neither run, nor any way avoid the
Bull. He gave her a desperate push on the side, at the same
instant her Lover knew that it was she, and was running to
assist her. Good God! what a grief it was for him to see his
dear Mistress in this sad Condition! Passion transported him,
he no longer valued his Life, and grew more furious than the
Bull, and performed things almost incredible. He was mor∣tally
wounded in divers places. On this Day, certainly the
People thought the <HI>Baiting fine,</HI> they carried these two unfor∣tunate
Lovers to her unhappy Fathers House, they both desired
to be in the same Chamber, and though they had but a little
time to live, yet begged the Favour they might be married, ac∣cordingly
they were married, and since they could not live
together, yet at last they were buried together, in one and
the same Grave. The Story has mightily increased the Aver∣sion
I had already conceived against these sort of <HI>Feasts,</HI> and I
told <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> so, after I had thanked him for his pains in
relating it to me.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have said nothing to you concerning the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Language, in which I am endeavouring to make some Pro∣gress.
It pleases me extreamly, it is expressive, noble, and
grave, Love finds it commodious for its work, and can play
the fool prettily enough in it. The Courtiers speak more
concisely than others, they make use of such abstracted Com∣parisons
and Metaphors, that unless one is used to hear them,
half their meaning is lost. I have learnt several Languages, or
at least understand the first Rudiments of them, but yet in my
mind, it is only our <HI>own</HI> which exceeds the <HI>Spanish.</HI></P>
<P>I come just now from seeing Ten <HI>Gallies</HI> which are arrived,
this is somewhat strange in a City that is Eighty Leagues from
<PB N="190" REF="197"/>
the Sea, but these are Land-<HI>Gallies;</HI> for if there be Sea horses
and Dogs, why not Land ones: They are shaped like a Charior,
but four times longer, and have six Wheels, three on a side,
and do not go much slower than a Chariot, the upper part is
round, and is very like a Gally, they are covered with Canvas,
and may contain forty Persons; there one sleeps and dresses
victuals, indeed 'tis a Moving-house, they put eighteen or
twenty Horses to draw it, the Machine is so long that it can∣not
be turned but in a field, they come usually from <HI>Galicia</HI> and
<HI>Manca,</HI> the Country of the brave <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> they set out
eight, ten or twelve in a Company, to be helpful to one ano∣ther
in case of need. For when one overturns, it makes a
great havock, and the best that can happen, is a broken Arm
or Legg, there must be above a hundred to raise it up again.
In it there is carried all sorts of Provisions, for the Country
through which they pass is so very barren, that on Mountains
which are fourscore Leagues broad, the biggest tree one meets
with is a little wild Tyme, there's in't neither Inn nor Inn-keep∣ers,
you sleep in the <HI>Gally,</HI> and 'tis a miserable Country for
Travellers.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur Mollini,</HI> the <HI>Popes Nuncio,</HI> consecrated the <HI>Patriarch</HI>
of the <HI>Indies</HI> on Trinity-Sunday, and the <HI>King</HI> was there. I
saw him come in, he had a Black Suit and a gold coloured Silk
Belt on, and little Pearls were set round the flowers, his hat
was so broad which they never cock here, that the Brims laid
upon his shoulders, and lookt ill. I observed, that during the
Ceremony he eat of something which was held to him in a Pa∣per,
they told me it was either Leeks or Shallots, of which he
eats very often. I was too far off, to see him well, he did not
return to <HI>Buen retiro,</HI> because of <HI>Corpus Christi day,</HI> at which
Ceremony he would assist. In coming out of the <HI>Church,</HI> I
knew a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman whose Name is <HI>Juncas,</HI> he is of <HI>Bur∣deaux,</HI>
where I saw him. I asked him how long he had been
here, he told me but a little while, and that his first Business
had been to have seen me, had he not been engaged at <HI>Bayon,</HI>
not to lose a minutes time, in the search of a very wicked Fel∣low,
which was supposed to be hid at <HI>Madrid.</HI> That it was not
the Curiosity to see the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI> consecrated,
which drew him to the <HI>Hieronomites,</HI> (otherwise the Daugh∣ters
of the <HI>Conception</HI>) but that having desired to speak with
one of the <HI>Nuns,</HI> he was told, that he could not see her till the
<HI>King</HI> was gone. He added, that this was one of the handso∣mest
Women in the World, and hath been the cause of a great
unhappiness in the Family of <HI>Monsieur De Lande.</HI> I remember
<PB N="191" REF="198"/>
to have seen her as I have gone by, and intreated him to tell
me the matter. <HI>It is,</HI> says he, <HI>too long and melancholy a Mis∣chance
to relate presently, but if you will see the young</HI> Nun <HI>I speak
of, I am perswaded she'll not be unpleasant to you.</HI> I willingly
accepted his Offer, because I have so often been told, that they
have so much more wit in <HI>Monasteries,</HI> then elsewhere in the
world. We went into a Parlour, which had three such ter∣rible
Iron doors with spikes, as made me wonder. How is
this, said I? It has been told me, that the <HI>Nuns</HI> in this Coun∣try
are very amorous, but I cannot be perswaded, that <HI>Love</HI>
is bold enough to venture over these long Spikes, and through
these little holes, where one must undoubtedly perish. <HI>You are
deceived,</HI> Madam, cry'd <HI>Juncas, at the Appearances of things,
if the Lady which is coming, can spare me so much time, I'll pre∣sently
tell you, what I learnt of a Friend of mine a</HI> Spaniard, <HI>the
first Journey I made thither.</HI> But at the very instant <HI>Donna
Isidora</HI> came into the Parlour. I found her much handsomer,
than I had fancyed her in my own Mind to be. <HI>Monsieur De
Juncas,</HI> told her, that I was a <HI>French</HI> Lady which had a great
mind to be acquainted with her, upon his report of her Merits.
She thankt me in a very modest manner, and afterwards told
us, that is was very true, that the Wretch after whom Enqui∣ry
was made, had been lately at <HI>Madrid;</HI> but that she was
certain he was not now there, and that he had even had the Im∣pudence
to write to her by the Hands of a Man where he lodged,
that the Letter was brought to her after his Departure, and that
she would not receive it. It seems to me, said I, inter∣rupting
of her, that he could not be taken, supposing he were
yet here. Sometimes, says <HI>Donna Isidora,</HI> Permission is ob∣tained
from the <HI>King.</HI> There are certain Crimes for which
there is no <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> and that is one of them. She fell a
weeping, and notwithstanding all her endeavours to hinder her
tears, and added, that thanks be to Heaven, she could not re∣proach
her self with any thing in the late Business, but yet she

cause of it. We talked together a good while longer, and I

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>ONE must love you as mightily as I do dear Cousen to re∣solve
to write to you in a Season when the Weather is so
excessive hot: Whatever has been told me, and whatever I
could imagine of it, is nothing in comparison to what I now
feel. To defend my self from the heat, I leave open all my
Windows all night long, without fearing the <HI>Gallick</HI> Winds
which criples a body. I sleep bare-head, I put my hands and
Feet in Snow, enough to kill one; but I think 'tis much at
one to dye, as to be smothered with heat, as they are here.
'Tis Mid-night before one feels the least breath of Air from the
Western <HI>Brizes.</HI></P>
<P>In going to take the Air, one is sufficiently puzled; for if
the Glasses are open, one's choaked with the Dust, of which the
Streets are so full that one can hardly see, and although the
Windows of the Houses are shut, the Dust finds a way through
and spoils all Houshold Goods; so that what with the ugly
smell in the Winter, and the dust in the Summer, all things
of Silver, and every thing else is so tarnished and spoyled, that
little can be kept handsome any considerable time: Notwith∣standing
all care at present, ones face will be covered with sweat
and dust, like those Wrestlers which are represented to us in a
Ring.</P>
<P>I should now tell you that I have seen the Ceremony on <HI>Cor∣pus
Christi-day,</HI> which is very solemnly kept here: There's a
general <HI>Procession</HI> of all the Parishes and Monasteries, which are
very numerous; the Streets thro which the <HI>Holy Sacrament</HI> is
to pass, are hung with the richest Tapistry in the World; for
I do not only speak of that which belongs to the Crown which
is there, but also of that which belongs to a thousand particu∣lar
Persons which have most admirable Tapistry. All the Bal∣conies
are then without their Lattices adorned with Carpets,
rich Cushions, and Canopies: They hang Ticking cross the
Streets to hinder the Sun from being troublesome, and they
throw water upon it, to make the Air cooler: All the Streets
are spread with Sand, well watered, and filled with so great a
quantity of Flowers, that one can hardly tread upon any thing
else. The Repositories are extraordinary large, and adorned
with the greatest splendor.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="200"/>
No Women go in the <HI>Procession:</HI> the <HI>King</HI> was there in a
black Lute-string Taffety Suit, a Shoulder-belt of blue Silk edged
with white; his Sleeves were of white Taffety, embroidered
with Silk and Bugles, they were very long and open before, he had
little Sleeves hanging down to his Waste, his Cloak was wrapt
about his Arm, and he had on his Collar of Gold and precio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
Stones, at which there hung a little sheep in Diamonds. He had
also Diamond Buckles at his Shooes and Garters, and a great
Hat-band of the same, which shined like the Sun; he had like∣wise
a knot which buttoned up his Hat, and at the bottom of
that a Pearl which they call the <HI>Pereagrine,</HI> it is as big as the
Russet-Pear, and of the same shape; it is pretended to be the
finest in <HI>Europe,</HI> and that both its colour and kind is in perfecti∣on.
The whole <HI>Court</HI> without exception, followed the Holy
Sacrament, the <HI>Councils</HI> walked after it without any Order or
Precedency, as they happened to be, holding white Wax
Candles in their hands; the <HI>King</HI> had one, and went foremost,
next the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> where the <HI>Sacrament</HI> was. It is certainly
one of the finest Ceremonies that can be seen. I observed that
all the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber had a great Gold Key by
their side, it opens the <HI>King's</HI> Chamber, into which they can
go when they will; it is as big as a Cellar-door Key: I there
saw several <HI>Knights of Malta,</HI> who wore every one of <HI>Cross</HI> of
<HI>Malta,</HI> made of <HI>Holland,</HI> and embroidered upon their Cloaks;
it was near two a Clock, and the <HI>Procession</HI> was not yet gone
in; when it past by the <HI>Palace,</HI> they fired several Rockets, and
other Inventions.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> went to meet the <HI>Procession</HI> at St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, which
is a Church near the Palace. Upon this day all the Ladies be∣gin
to wear their Summer Garments, they make their Balco∣nies
very fine, in which they have either several Baskets of
Flowers, or Bottles filled with sweet Water, which they throw
about whilst the <HI>Procession</HI> passes by. Commonly the three Com∣panies
which guard the <HI>King,</HI> are new cloathed. As soon as
the <HI>Holy Sacrament</HI> is gone back to the Church, every body
goes home to eat, that they may be at the <HI>Autos,</HI> which are
certain kinds of Tragedies, upon <HI>Religious Subjects,</HI> and are od∣ly
enough contrived and managed: They are acted either in the
Court or Street of each President of a <HI>Council,</HI> to whom it is
due. The <HI>King</HI> goes thither, and all the Persons of Quality re∣ceive
Tickets over Night to go there; so that we were invited,
and I was amazed to see them light up abundance of Flamboys,
whilst the Sun beat full upon the Comedians Heads, and melted
the Wax like Butter; they acted the most impertinent piece
<PB N="194" REF="201"/>
that ever I saw I my days. This the Subject of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knights</HI> of St. <HI>James</HI> are assembled, and our <HI>Lord</HI> comes
and desires them to receive him into their <HI>Order;</HI> there are
divers of them that are very willing to it, but the <HI>Seniors</HI> re∣present
to the others, the wrong they should do themselves,
if they should admit into their Society, a Person of ignoble
Birth, that St. <HI>Joseph</HI> his Father, was a poor Carpenter, and that
the <HI>Holy Virgin</HI> wrought with her Needle: Our <HI>Lord</HI> with great
impatience expects their Resolution, at last they determine
with some unwillingness, to refuse him; but at the same time
propose an expedient, which is to institute on purpose for
him. The <HI>Order de Christo,</HI> and with this every body is satisfied.
This is the <HI>Order,</HI> that is in <HI>Portugal,</HI> but yet these things are
not done with a wicked design; no, they had rather dye than
in the least to fail of the respect due to <HI>Religion.</HI> These <HI>Autos</HI>
last for a Month; I am so we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry of going to them, that I ex∣cuse
my self as oft as I can. They use Sweet-meats and Water
cooled in Ice very much, and they have need of them, for the
heat almost kills one, and the dust choaks a body: I was ravish'd
with Joy to meet <HI>Don Augustin Pacheco,</HI> and his Wife (of
whom I have formerly told you) at the <HI>President de Hazienda's</HI>
House; they came thither, because they are related to the <HI>Pre∣sident.</HI>
We were placed near one another, and when the Cere∣mony
was over, we went to take the Air in the <HI>Prado,</HI> after
the <HI>French</HI> Mode, that is Men and Women together in the same
Coach. <HI>Don Frederic de Cardonne</HI> was one; our Curtains were
close drawn whilst there was a great many folks, because of our
beautiful and young <HI>Spanish</HI> Women; but as we tarryed later
than others, the <HI>Nuncio,</HI> and <HI>Frederic Cornaro</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> Am∣bassador,
caused their Coaches to drive up to ours, and talkt
with us; when all on a sudden we saw a great <HI>Illumination</HI> all
along the Walk, and at the same time appeared sixty <HI>Cardinals</HI>
upon Mules, in their Habits and red Caps; after them followed
the <HI>Pope,</HI> he was carryed upon a certain Machine all covered with
a foot Carpet; he sat under a Canopy in a great Chair, and St.
<HI>Peter</HI>'s Keys laid upon a Cushion, with a Vessel full of holy Wa∣ter
of Orange<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Flowers, with which he sprinkled every body.
The show marched on gravely; and when they were come
to the end of the <HI>Prado,</HI> the <HI>Cardinals</HI> began to play a thou∣sand
cunning tricks to make his <HI>Holiness</HI> merry; some threw
their Hats upon the Trees, and standing directly under, they
fell upon their Heads again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and others stood upright upon the
Saddles on their Mules, and made them run as fast as they could.
There was a vast number of People followed them; we asked
<PB N="195" REF="202"/>
the <HI>Popes</HI> Nuncio what this meant, and he assured us he under∣stood
nothing of it; and that he did not like this sort of Mirth.
He sent to enquire from whence the <HI>Holy Colledge</HI> came in
that manner; and we understood it was the <HI>Bakers Holy-day,</HI>
and that every year they used to make this fine shew. The
<HI>Nuncio</HI> had a great mind to have disturbed them with a Volly of
Cudgels, and had already commanded his Attendants to begin
the Fray, but we interceded in the behalf of these poor People,
who had no other, intention than to celebrate the Festival of
their <HI>Saint.</HI> In the mean time, some that had over heard the
Orders which were given, and were Disturbers of the publick
Peace, gave Information thereof to the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Cardinals,</HI> this
was enough to put all in confusion, everyone escaped as well as
he could, and their fear made our Pleasure short lived. In <HI>France</HI>
such <HI>Mascarades</HI> would not be suffered, but perhaps there are
many things innocent in one Country, which would not be so
in another.</P>
<P>My Kinswoman knowing how very civilly I had been received
by <HI>Don Augustin Pacheco,</HI> invited him to Supper at her House.
I desired him to remember his promise of giving me a Relation
of what he knew of the <HI>Indies,</HI> immediately I'll tell you, says
he, concerning those they call the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> in which a part
of <HI>America</HI> is comprised.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Ferdinand King</HI> of <HI>Castille</HI> and <HI>Arragon, Chri∣stopher
Columbus</HI> a <HI>Genoway,</HI> discovered this Part of the World
in the Year 1492. As the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were the first that found
this fortunate Country, unknown to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> so King
<HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Queen <HI>Isabel,</HI> had the Propriety of it by a Bull
from Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. He established them and their Suc∣cessors
<HI>perpetual Vicars</HI> of the <HI>Holy See,</HI> over this vast Coun∣try;
so that the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> are both <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal
Lords,</HI> and nominate <HI>Bishops</HI> and other <HI>Ecclesiasticks,</HI> and re∣ceive
<HI>Tenths</HI> from them. Their power there, is of a larger ex∣tent
than in <HI>Spain,</HI> for you must know that <HI>America</HI> alone is
one of the four Parts of the World, and that we possess more
Land there, than all other Nations together besides. The Coun∣cil
of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which is establisht at <HI>Madrid,</HI> is one of the
most considerable of the Kingdom, and there being so great a
necessity of holding a very frequent Correspondence between
<HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> to send Orders to maintain the <HI>Court</HI>
Authority, they were obliged to establish beside, a particular
<HI>Chamber,</HI> which is composed of the eldest Counsellors of the
Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and they are to take Cognizance of all
things concerning the <HI>Revenues,</HI> and cause Expeditions by
the Secretaries of the Council.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="203"/>
Besides this <HI>Chamber</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> there's another at <HI>Seville,</HI>
called the House of <HI>Contrataction,</HI> it is composed of several
Counsellors both of the <HI>Robe</HI> and the <HI>Sword,</HI> with other ne∣cessary
Officers. Those of the <HI>Sword,</HI> take Cognizance of
things which concern the <HI>Fleet</HI> and the <HI>Galleons.</HI> The other
Counsellors take Care of matters of Justice. Appeals from
this Tribunalare made to the Council of the <HI>Indies</HI> at <HI>Madrid.</HI>
There are Registers kept in the House of <HI>Contrataction</HI> at <HI>Se∣ville,</HI>
in which are writ all the Merchandize that are sent to
the <HI>Indies,</HI> and all that come from thence, that so the <HI>King</HI>
may not be cheated of his Customs; but this signifies little, the
Merchants are so cunning, and those who keep the Accounts
are so easily drawn to share with them, that the <HI>King</HI> is not a
whit the better for them, and the Duty to him, which is only
the fifth Part, is so ill paid, that he does not receive the fourth
Part of what is due to him.</P>
<P>It is the Council of <HI>Madrid</HI> which proposes Subjects to the
<HI>King</HI> to fill up the vacant <HI>Vice-Royalties</HI> of <HI>New-Spain</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI>
they are granted for five Years, and so are all other Places, of
which the most considerable, are these following, <HI>viz.</HI> The

and the Governour of the great <HI>Caxamarca.</HI></P>
<P>I do not hear mention the places of <HI>Judicature,</HI> nor the <HI>Be∣nefices,</HI>
which are very numerous. But it must be observed, that
all the Employmetns I have spoken of, are given either from
three to three Years, or from five to five Years, that so one Man
alone may not grow rich, whilst there are so many others that
stand in need to partake of the <HI>King's</HI> Kindness.</P>
<P>In those Places where there is no <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> he that is Pre∣sident,
is also Governour, and when a <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> dies, the Pre∣sident
of the <HI>Vice-Royalty</HI> for the time being, takes the Govern∣ment
upon him, till another <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> is sent from <HI>Spain.</HI> It
is his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty which gives those great Posts and the
most considerable Governments. The <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> fill up the les∣ser,
and these <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> make a shift very easily in five Years
time, to bring home two Millions of Crowns all charges paid,
the Governours of the Principal Places, get in the same Com∣pass
of time about five or six hundred thousand Crowns; none
goes thither, but what grows rich, and this is so certain, that
even the <HI>Fryers</HI> which are sent thither to preach the <HI>Faith,</HI> and
convert the <HI>Indians,</HI> make such a Profitable <HI>Mission,</HI> that they
bring home every one of them, thirty or forty thousand
Crowns. The <HI>King</HI> disposes of divers Pensions paid by the <HI>Vil∣lages</HI>
of the <HI>Indies.</HI> And from these they draw from two to
six thousand Crowns <HI>per Annum.</HI> And this is another way the
<HI>King</HI> has to gratifie his Subjects.</P>
<P>The <HI>Phillipine</HI> Islands which lie near the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI>
depend upon the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Trade there is in Silk:
these places cost him more to keep, than they bring him in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Castillians</HI> had their Reasons why they would not let
any sort of <HI>Manufactures</HI> be set up in the <HI>Indies,</HI> nor any Stuffs
made there, nor any of those things else, which are indispen∣sibly
necessary. This Policy causes every thing to go from <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
and make the <HI>Indians,</HI> who passionately love all the Com∣modities
and Ornaments which come from thence freely to sa∣crifice
their Silver to their Satisfaction: by this means, they
are put out of a Capacity to grow rich, because they are forced
at very dear rates to buy the least Trifle they want, and with
which they amuse them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flota</HI> consists of divers Vessels loaden with rich Merchan∣dizes
which are sent to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are other great
Ships of War which are called <HI>Galleons,</HI> which the <HI>King</HI> sends
to convoy them. These Men of War ought not to carry any
Merchants Goods, but the Lucre of Gain tempts them against
the express Prohibition of the <HI>King,</HI> and sometimes they are so
<PB N="199" REF="206"/>
full laden, that if they should happen to be attacked, they could
not defend themselves. When these Vessels are ready to sail,
the Dispatch which the Merchants obtain from the Council of
the <HI>Indies</HI> at <HI>Madrid</HI> for leave to send them, cost for each of
them, from three to six thousand Crowns, according to the
bigness of the Vessel. It is easie to imagine, that since they
give so much, they are sure of gaining a great deal more.</P>
<P>The <HI>Galleons</HI> go no further than <HI>Porto Velo,</HI> whither they
bring all the Silver of <HI>Peru,</HI> the <HI>Flota</HI> leaves them at this Place
and continue their Voyage to <HI>New-Spain.</HI> The <HI>Galleons</HI> sail
from <HI>Sanlucar</HI> to <HI>Carthagena</HI> in six Weeks or two Months at
most, they tarry there a little while, and in five or six Days
they come back to <HI>Porto velo;</HI> it is a Town Scituated on the
Coast of <HI>America,</HI> the Air there is very unwholsome, and the
Weather excessive hot. On the other side of the <HI>Isthmus</HI> some
ten Leagues distance only, is the City of <HI>Panama,</HI> whether is
brought from <HI>Peru</HI> a vast quantity of Silver in Bars or Wedges,
and divers Merchandizes which are conveyed by Land-carriage
to <HI>Porto velo,</HI> where the <HI>Galleons</HI> are, and where there is kept
one of the greatest Fairs in the World, for in less then forty
or fifty Days there is sold of all sorts of <HI>European</HI> Goods to the
value at least of twenty Millions of Crowns ready Money. Af∣ter
the Fair is done, the <HI>Galleons</HI> return to <HI>Carthagena,</HI> at which
place there's a considerable Trade for <HI>Indian</HI> Goods, and those
of the Kingdom of St. <HI>Foy,</HI> as well as for those, from <HI>Mori∣genta:</HI>
After this, they go to the <HI>Havana</HI> to take in necessary
Provisions for this Voyage, and from thence they are common∣ly
two Months in Sailing to <HI>Cadiz.</HI> But as to the <HI>Flota,</HI> it
stops at <HI>Porto Rico</HI> to refresh, and arrives at <HI>Vera Cruz</HI> in five
Weeks, there they unload their Merchandizes, which is after∣wards
carryed by Land fourscore Leagues beyond to the great
City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the Sale of them is quickly over, and the <HI>Flo∣ta</HI>
parts afterwards to go to the <HI>Havana;</HI> but this must be past
only in the Month of <HI>April</HI> or <HI>September,</HI> because of the North
Winds. The <HI>Galleons</HI> are commonly Nine Months in their
Voyage to <HI>Peru,</HI> and the <HI>Flota</HI> is thirteen or fourteen Months,
some particular Persons go thither also at their own Charge,
after they have obtained Leave from the <HI>King,</HI> and have Re∣gistred
themselves at the <HI>Contrataction</HI> at <HI>Seville,</HI> these go to the
the Coasts of St. <HI>Domingo, Honduras, Caracas,</HI> and <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI></P>
<P>The Money which comes directly from the <HI>King</HI> from the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
must be brought in one <HI>Galleon,</HI> this Silver is delivered to
one of the Masters of the Mint, who pays to the <HI>King</HI> every
Voyage he makes, six thousand Crowns, and he keeps one <HI>per
<PB N="200" REF="207"/>
Cent.</HI> Of all the Silver that goes through his Hands, which ari∣ses
high. As to the Silver which belongs to particular Persons,
that is brought in what Vessels they will choose; and it is the
Captain that is responsible for it.</P>
<P>There's a certain Duty which is called <HI>Avarie,</HI> and it is ta∣ken
for all Goods Registred, and for all the Silver which is
brought from the <HI>Indies.</HI> This Duty is so considerable, that
it suffices to fit out the <HI>Galleons</HI> and the <HI>Flota</HI> for their Voyage,
although the Charge amounts to nine Millions of Crowns; but
that of the <HI>Flota</HI> is not so great.</P>
<P>He that the <HI>King</HI> chooses to be <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Galleons,</HI> ad∣vances

is repaid him in the <HI>Indies</HI> with great Interest. Every other

Gulph <HI>Delas Yequas</HI> she goes to the Isles of <HI>Marguerita</HI> to fish
for Pearls, of which they pay to the King a fifth part, that is
of all the Pearl they take, and afterwards she comes to

<P>Within these few Years, there is discovered Seventy Leagues
from <HI>Lima,</HI> some <HI>Mines</HI> which yield a vast Revenue, those of
<HI>Peru,</HI> and all the others in the <HI>West Indies</HI> pay the <HI>King</HI> the
fifth part, as well of the <HI>Gold,</HI> as the <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Emeraulds.</HI>
There is at <HI>Potosi</HI> greater plenty of <HI>Mines</HI> than any where else,
the Silver they get there is brought to <HI>Port de Ariga,</HI> and
from thence, it is sent to <HI>Callao.</HI> It is one of the Ports of <HI>Lima,</HI>
whether the <HI>Galleons</HI> come to fetch it. The Kingdom of <HI>Peru</HI>
yields every Year in Gold and Silver to the Value of eleven
Millions of Crowns. From <HI>New Spain</HI> is brought five Millions
of Crowns, besides Merchandizes which are commonly Emer∣aulds,
Gold, Silver, Chochenil, Tobacco, Wool of <HI>Vivogne,
Campecha</HI> Wood and Hydes.</P>
<P>It was a long while before they would suffer in <HI>New Spain</HI>
any Workmen that wrought in Silk or Wool; there are some

are sent from <HI>Europe,</HI> they are not allowed to plant there any
<HI>Olive</HI> Trees or <HI>Vines,</HI> that so the Oyl and Wine which is car∣ried
thither may sell the better. The King has the Power in
the <HI>Indies</HI> as well as <HI>Spain,</HI> to sell the <HI>Bull</HI> of the <HI>Crusado,</HI> which

<PB N="201" REF="208"/>
No Strangers are suffered to go to the <HI>Indies,</HI> but if at any
time some happen to go, there must be a special Permission ob∣tained
which is very rarely granted.</P>
<P>How is it possible for me, continued <HI>Don Augustine,</HI> to ex∣press
to you the Beautifulness of the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the Church∣es,
the Palaces, the Publick Places, the Riches, the Profusion,
the Magnificence and the Pleasures, a City that is so happily
Scituated that in all Seasons it enjoys a continual Spring, and
where the Heats are not at all excessive, where they feel not
the Severity of Winter. The Country is no less charming, and
Flowers and the Fruits at all times equally loading the Trees.
There you gather more than one Crop in a Year; the
Lakes and Ponds are full of Fish, the Grounds are well stockt
with Cattel, the Forests and Woods afford excellent Fowl and
wild Beasts, the Earth seems to open her Bowels on purpose
to give up the Gold she encloses, there are Mines or Rocks of
precious Stones discovered, and Pearl are there taken. Oh!
said I, let us all go dwell in that Country. This Description
Charms, but as 'tis a long Voyage it may be convenient, if
you please, Madam, said I, to <HI>Donna Theresa</HI> in smiling, to
get our Supper before we go; I immediately took her by the
hand, and we came into a Parlour, where I had provided the
best Musicians, which are bad enough, and which in my Opi∣nion,
have nothing to recommend them but their dearness. My
Cook made us some <HI>Ragous</HI> after the <HI>French</HI> way, which <HI>Donna
Theresa</HI> found so excellent, that she desired I would let her
have the Receipt how to do them. <HI>Don Augustin</HI> intreated me
also, to let him have some of my <HI>Larding Pins,</HI> of which really
one may look all over <HI>Spain,</HI> and not find so much as one. We
tarryed very late together, for in this Season they set up till
four or five a Clock in the Morning because of the heats, and
that the best time is in the Night.</P>
<P>There are certain days in the year, that every body goes
out to take the Air upon the Bridges which cross the River
<HI>Mansanarez;</HI> but at present all Coaches are laid up, the Gravel
and some little Brooks help to make it very cool and pleasant.
The Horses endure a great deal in these Walks, for nothing
can be more prejudicial to their Feet than the Flints upon
which they continually tread. In certain places of this River
they make a stand, and there remain till two or three a Clock
in the Morning; there is very often a thousand Coaches: Some
particular People bring Victuals to eat there, and others sing
and play upon several Instruments; all this is very pleasant in
a fine Night: There are some Persons which wash or bath
<PB REF="209"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/>
<HI>Castile</HI> successively from Father to Son. Here's one thing very
singular, and that which is not allowed of in any other Coun∣try;
and that is, That <HI>Foundlings,</HI> or Children found by chance
are reckoned <HI>Noble,</HI> and bear the Title of <HI>Hidalgos,</HI> and enjoy
all the Priviledges annext to the Nobility; but to this end,
they must prove, that they were <HI>Foundlings,</HI> and were main∣tained
and bred in the <HI>Hospital</HI> where such Children are kept.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Spain</HI> some great Families which hold almost all
their Estates by the Title of <HI>Mayorargo;</HI> and when it happens
that all of the Name are dead, and that the next akin is a Male,
though he be a natural Son, yet he shall inherit, and for want
of such, the eldest Domestick shall take the Name and the Arms
of his Master, and inherit his Estate: And this is one reason
why the younger Brothers of others Houses, as Noble and Illu∣strious,
do not scorn to be Servants to these, and their hopes
are pretty well grounded; for it often happens that Families
are extinct, because the <HI>Spanish</HI> Women have fewer Children
than the Women of other Countries.</P>
<P>There lately happened a very great misfortune to a young
Woman of Quality called <HI>Donna Clara;</HI> she could not preserve
her Heart against the Charms of <HI>Count de Castrillo,</HI> a Man of
the Court, very witty and handsome; the <HI>Cavellero</HI> had the se∣cret
to please her without designing it; he was ignorant of the
Inclinations she had for him, and so did not improve his Happi∣ness:
<PB REF="210"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/>
an angry look, <HI>That it is not to me you ought to address your sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon such a design <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yours. Here take the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter which I will
not so much as open.</HI> The <HI>Count</HI> had too much Wit not to ap∣prehend
presently the favourable intention of this fair one.
You need not complain, Madam, says he to her, that I have not
made use of your Advice; he quickly withdrew to read a Let∣ter
which must needs give him abundance of Pleasure: by this
means he was informed of <HI>Donna Clora's</HI> Intentions, and what
he must do to see her. He omitted nothing, he became des∣perately
in Love, and thought himself, as he had reason, one
of the happiest <HI>Cavalleros</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> They impatiently expected
the return of her Father, that they might propose the Marriage
to him, which in all likelihood must have been very acceptable
to him.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all the Precautions that these young Lo∣vers
took both certainly to fix and continue a Conversation,
which was the Joy of their Life; yet the suspicious and watch∣ful
<HI>Henriques</HI> discovered their Intreague. He believed her Cri∣minal,
and in the excess of his Rage, without signifying or ma∣king
the lest shew, he one Night went into the Chamber of
the unfortunate <HI>Donna Clara,</HI> and as she was in a deep sleep, he
strangled her in the most barbarous manner imaginable.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="211"/>
Nevertheless, though it was known, that he was the Author
of so wicked an Action, yet he was not prosecuted, for he had
too much Credit and Interest; and besides, this poor Gentle∣woman
had no kindred but what was his, and they were un∣willing
to encrease the Misfortunes of their Family, which were
already but too great.</P>
<P>After this wicked Fact, <HI>Henriques</HI> feigned a great fit of Devo∣tion;
he appeared no more in Publick, and had <HI>Mass</HI> said at his
House, and saw very few People; for he was very apprehensive
that <HI>Count Castrillo</HI> (who had not dissembled his Grief, but had
let it visibly appear) would at last be revenged for his Mistress,
for indeed he most carefully sought all Opportunities. At length,
after having attempted all imaginable ways, he found out one
which succeeded.</P>
<P>He disguised himself like an <HI>Aguador,</HI> that is, a Water-bearer,
these sort of People load an Ass with several great Pitchers, and
so carry them about the City; they wear thick coarse Cloath,
their Legs are naked, and their Shooes are either cut or slasht,
or else they have Soals made fast with Strings. Our Lover thus
disguised waited all day long, leaning upon the side of a <HI>Spring∣well,</HI>
whose Waters he increased by his Tears; for this <HI>Well</HI> was
just against the House where he had so often seen his dear and
fair <HI>Clara,</HI> and there it was also, where the inhumane <HI>Henriques</HI>
dwelt. As the <HI>Count</HI> kept his Eyes continually upon this House,
he perceived one of the Casements half open, and at the same
time his Enemy to draw near it, he had a Looking-Glass in his
Hand, in which he was looking himself. Immediately the cun∣ning
<HI>Aquator</HI> threw some Cherry-stones at him, in a jesting
way, and some of them having hit his Face, <HI>Don Henriques</HI> af∣fronted
at the Insolence of a Man, which appeared to him to be
only a poor <HI>Aguador,</HI> and transported with the first motions of
his Anger, came down alone to chastize him: But he was hard∣ly
in the Street, when the <HI>Count</HI> discovered himself, and draw∣ing
his Sword, which for his purpose he kept hid, cryed out,
<HI>Traitor that thou art, think of defending thy Life.</HI> The surprize
and the fright had so amazed <HI>Don Henriques,</HI> that he was only
able to ask quarter; but he could not obtain it from this enra∣ged
Lover, who came to revenge the Death of his Mistriss up∣on
him that had so cruelly murdered her. This <HI>Count</HI> would
have found it very hard to have escaped, upon his doing such an
Action just at the door of a Man of note, and that had abun∣dance
of Servants; but in that very moment that all <HI>Don Hen∣riques</HI>
People were sallying out upon the <HI>Count,</HI> happily for
him, the Duke <HI>Duzeda</HI> came by with three of his Friends, they
<PB N="205" REF="212"/>
immediately came out of their Coach, and rescued him so seaso∣nably,
that he made his Escape, and we do not yet hear where
he is. I am concerned for him, because I know him, and that
he is a very honest Man.</P>
<P>It is very common in this Country, to assassinate one for se∣veral
Causes, and Custom even authorizes the Fact, for every
angry Difference; for example, if one give another a Box o'th
Ear, or strikes him on the Face with his Hat, his Handkerchief,
or his Glove, or has wronged him, in calling him <HI>Drunkard,</HI> or
lets drop any words that reflects on the Virtue of his Wife, these
things I say must be no otherwise revenged than by Assassina∣tion;
but they give this Reason, that after such Affronts, it
would not be just for a Man to venture his Life in single Com∣bate
upon equal terms, where the <HI>Offended</HI> might perish by the
hand of the <HI>Agressor.</HI> They'll keep a revenge twenty Years
together, if they cannot sooner meet with a fit Occasion to exe∣cute
it: And if they happen to die before they have got Satis∣faction,
they leave their Children Inheritors of their Resent∣ments
as well as of their Estates, and the best way for a Man
that hath given any Affront to another, is for ever to forsake his
Country. I was lately told of a considerable Man, that after he
had lived twenty Years in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to avoid an ill turn from
another to whom he had given some Offence, and having un∣derstood
that not only he but his Son was dead, believed him∣self
secure. He returns to <HI>Madrid,</HI> after he had taken care to
change his Name that he might not be known; but all this was
not able to save him, for the Grandson of him that thought
himself abused, though he was but twelve Years old, caused this
Person to be murdered quickly after his return.</P>
<P>The Men that committed these horrid Actions are commonly
hired from <HI>Valentia.</HI> It is a City in <HI>Spain,</HI> whose People are
wicked to excess; there's not any Crime which they will not de∣liberately
commit for Money; they wear <HI>Stillettos,</HI> and Fire
Arms which go off without any noise. There are two sorts of
these <HI>Stillettos,</HI> one about the length of a short Ponyard, but
not thicker than a thick needle, and made of an excellent Steel,
square and sharp edged. This Instrument wounds mortally for
entring very deep, and making no bigger an Orifice than an
needle; no Blood comes out, nay hardly can one perceive the
place where it entred, and so being impossible to dress it, they
almost constantly die. The other sort is longer, and no thicker
than the little finger, but so hard and strong that I have seen one
of them at one blow struck through a thick Walnut-Tree Table.
These sort of Arms are forbidden to be carryed in <HI>Spain,</HI> as

<HI>Bayonnets</HI> are in <HI>France;</HI> neither is it lawful to carry those Poc¦ket-Pistols
which fire without noise; but yet notwithstanding
the Prohibition, several Persons make use of them.</P>
<P>I have been told, that a Person of Quality thinking he had
a just cause to destroy one of his Enemies, went to a <HI>Bandolero</HI>
of <HI>Valentia,</HI> and gave him a Sum of Money to murder him, but
afterwards he was reconciled to his Enemy, and being willing
to use a good Conscience, he made it his first business to acquaint
the <HI>Bandolero</HI> with what had past, that so he might have a care
not to kill this Man. The <HI>Bandolero</HI> seeing his Service needless,
offered to return the Money, but he that gave it, entreated him
to keep it; <HI>Well,</HI> says he, <HI>I am a Man of Honour, I shall keep
your money and I will kill your Man.</HI> The other earnestly begged
him to do nothing, seeing they were now Friends. <HI>Look you,</HI>
says he to him, <HI>all that I can do, is to give you your choice, whe∣ther
it shall be you or him, for to gain your Money honestly, there's
a necessity I must kill one of you.</HI> And notwithstanding all the
Entreaties of this Person, he persisted in his design, and execu∣ted
it. It had been an easie matter to have seized him, but
there was too much danger in't, for those <HI>Bandoleros</HI> are so nu∣merous
and united, that if any one of them should be executed,
the Death of him is certainly and quickly revenged. These
Wretches are never without a List of their wicked Actions they
have committed, and count it an honour to them; and when
any one would set them on work, they shew that, and ask,
whether they desire them quickly dispatched, or to give them a
languishing Wound. These are the most pernicious People in
the Universe. Indeed if I should tell you all the Tragical Stories
which I hear every day, you would grant that this Country is
the very Theatre of the most horrid Scenes in the World. Love
frequently furnishes the matter, either for its Satisfaction or Re∣venge.
There is nothing that a <HI>Spaniard</HI> will not undertake,
nor nothing that is above either his Courage or Compassion.</P>
<P>'Tis said, that <HI>Jealousie</HI> is their prevailing Passion, yet they
do not pretend it so much out of Love, as Resentment and
Pride, for they cannot bear to see another prefer'd before them,
and every thing which contributes to affront them, makes them
desperate; let these things be how they will, one thing is cer∣tainly
true, that is a most furious and barbarous Nation in this
Affair. The Women keep not company with Men; but yet
they very well understand how to write and appoint Meetings
when they have a mind; notwithstanding the danger is great
both for themselves, the Lover and the Messenger; but in spite
of all that, by their Wit and their Money, they make a shift to
deceive the most cunning <HI>Argus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="216"/>
It is unaccountable that Men who put every thing in practice
to satisfie their Revengeful Minds, and who are guilty of such
abominable Actions, should even be scrupulously <HI>Religious,</HI> at
the same time they are going to stab their Enemy. And that
they may not fail in their Enterprize, they must forsooth, per∣form
their <HI>nine days task of Devotion for the Souls in Purgatory,</HI>
and recommend themselves to the <HI>Relick<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> they carry about
them, which they often kiss. I would not be thought to fix
this Character upon the whole Nation; it may be affirmed that
there's as good People as in any part of the World, and that
they are endowed with a mighty <HI>Greatness of Mind.</HI> I'll give
you some Instances of this last, which perhaps though you'll
look upon as Follies, for every thing has two handles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Connestable de Castille</HI> is for certain, one of the richest
Lords of the Court in Lands; but as he has the same fault as
others like himself, which is to be careless in looking after
his Interest, so he is ill furnished with Money. The Pensions
which the King allows him, as he is <HI>Doyen</HI> or Chief of the <HI>Coun∣cil
of State, Connestabile of Castille,</HI> and <HI>Grand Falconer,</HI> are so
considerable, as to supply all his wants, but he is so haughty,
that he will not receive any thing upon that Account. He
gives these Reasons, <HI>That when a Subject has Estate enough to live
upon, he ought not to be chargeable to his Prince, but ought to serve
him, and esteem himself happy; that to be paid for what he does
is mercenary and slavish.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Arcas,</HI> alias <HI>de Avero,</HI> hath like wise another ob∣stinate
humour, he pretends that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> has u∣surped
the Crown from his Family, and therefore when he
speaks of him, he never calls him any thing, but Duke <HI>de Bra∣gance;</HI>
in the mean while, this Man has forty thousand Crowns
a year in <HI>Portugal,</HI> of which he does not enjoy a Farthing, be∣cause
he will not submit to kiss the Kings hand, nor to do him
homage.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> hath sent him word, that he will dis∣pense
with his coming himself, provided he will send in his
stead one of his Sons, either the eldest or the youngest, which
he will, and that he will then let him receive his Rents; and
moreover, will pay him all the Arrears, which amount to an
immense Sum. The Duke <HI>de Avero</HI> will not so much as hear it
mentioned. He says, that seeing he has lost the Crown, it
would be a shame for forty thousand Crowns a year, to submit
to the Usurper, that the greater evil takes away the sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of
the lesser; that the Glory the King would receive from his
Homage, would exceed the profit be gets from his Revenue▪
<PB N="208" REF="217"/>
and that he would have cause to reproach him, for having done
an honour to him which was not his due.</P>
<P>The last I reserve for you, is the Prince <HI>Destillano;</HI> he hath
Places and Commissions to dispose of at the <HI>Contrataction</HI> in
<HI>Seville,</HI> to the value of fourscore thousand <HI>Livers</HI> a year. He
had rather lose them, than so much as set his hand to the ne∣cessary
dispatches, saying, it is not agreeable to the Generosity
of such a <HI>Cavallero</HI> as he is, to trouble himself to sign his Name
for so small a matter; for you must know that these fourscore
thousand <HI>Livers</HI> are not in Article, it may be there is above
thirty; and when his Secretary presents to him a dispatch or
grant of a Place, worth four or five thousand <HI>Livers,</HI> he will
refuse to sign it, and alledges his Quality, always saying, <HI>Esto
es una Mineria,</HI> that is, it is but a Trifle. The King however
is not so nice in the matter, for he fills up the Places for him, and
receives the profit to himself.</P>
<P>You'll say now, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Fools with this their
fantastick Grandeur; and perhaps you are in the right, but for
my part, and I think I know them pretty well, I am not of that
Opinion; yet nevertheless I'll own, that whatever difference
can be found in comparing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> it must
be to our advantage; but it does not seem fit for me to med∣dle
in determining the matter, for my Interest is too much
concerned to let me judge impartially, but yet I am perswaded
that there are very few rational Persons, who would not make
the same Judgment.</P>
<P>There are fewer Strangers that come to <HI>Madrid</HI> than to any
City in the World, and they have reason; for unless they have
somebody to procure them some Lodging in some private House,
they'll run the hazard of being very ill lodged, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
are not very ready to offer their Houses to any body, because
of their Wives, of whom they are extream jealous. I do not
know, that in all this City, there's any more than two <HI>Inns,</HI>
whereof at one of them, they eat after the <HI>French</HI> mode; and
when these are full (which they are very quickly, being very
little) one knows not what to do; add to this, That there's no
conveniency for passing to and fro in the Town, H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckney, or
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches are scarce enough, but one may have as many
Chairs as one will, yet it is seldom that Men are carryed in
them▪ unless they be very old or infirm. But after all, why
should Strangers come to <HI>Madrid?</HI> That which is finest and
the most amiable, is always hid. I mean the Women, there's
no conversing with them; those Women that may be seen, are
such dangerous Creatures for a Man's Health, that it must be a
<PB N="209" REF="218"/>
great Curiosity indeed, that a Man can resolve to satisfie at so
much risque; yet in spight of all this, the only Pleasure, and
the sole Enjoyment of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is to contract some
League; even Youths of Quality that are rich, begin at the
Age of twelve or thirteen years to entertain a Concubine-Mi∣stress,
which they call <HI>Amancebade,</HI> for whom they neglect
their Studies, and make away with whatever they can catch up
in their Fathers House, but 'tis not song before those Creatures
give them cause to repent of their Folly.</P>
<P>But that which is terrible is, That there are few Persons in
this Country, either of one or t'other Sex, and even of those
whose Quality distinguishes them, that are free from that cur∣sed
Disease; their Children either bring it into the World with
them from their Mother's Womb, or suck it from the Nurse;
a Virgin may justly be suspected to have it, and they are hardly
perswaded to be cured of it they are so certain of falling again
into the same Condition. But doubtless this Disease is not so
dangerous in <HI>Spain</HI> as in other Countries, for they still preserve
their Hair very fine, and their Teeth very good: At <HI>Court,</HI> and
amongst the Women of the highest Quality, they discourse of
it as they do of a Fever, or the Meagrim, and they all bear the
Distemper patiently, without so much as troubling themselves
one minute about it. As they know not but that the most ver∣tuous
Women, and the youngest Child may have it, so they
never let blood in the Arm, but always in the Foot; they'll let
a Child three Weeks old blood in the Foot, and this is so con∣stant
a Custom amongst them, that unless it be some very able
Surgeon, they know not how to let Blood in the Arm. I was
indisposed, and was forced to make use of the <HI>French</HI> Ambassa∣dor's
<HI>valet de Chambre,</HI> to let me Blood in the Arm. By all
that I have told you, it is easie to judge, that this is the <HI>Nup∣tial</HI>
present which a <HI>Spaniard</HI> makes to his Wife, and that
though they marry, they do not quit their Mistresses, be they
never so dangerous. Every time these Mistresses are l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t blood,
their Gallants are obliged to give them a compleat new suit of
Apparel; and yet you must observe they wear ten or twelve
Petticoats at a time; so that this causes no ordinary Expence.
The Marquess <HI>de Liche</HI> understanding that his Mistress was just
let blood, and so could not tarry till the Tailor made her a suit
which he intended for her, he sent her one that was just
brought home for the <HI>Marchioness</HI> his Lady, who is extream
beautiful. It is a common saying with him, <HI>That to be the hap∣piest
Man, he would only wish a Mistress as handsome as his Wife.</HI></P>

The great Lords which return very rich from their Govern∣ments
(whether for the most part they go poor enough, and
where they pillage and extort all they can, because they are
but for five years time) do not lay out their Money when they
come home, in the purchase of Lands; they keep it in their
Chests, and as long as it lasts, they live at a great rate, for
they think it is below them to improve their Money. Following
this Method, it would be very hard for the greatest Treasure
not to be quickly exhausted; but the future disturbs them but
little, for every one of them hopes either for some <HI>Vice-Royalty,</HI>
or some other <HI>Post,</HI> which will effectually repair all their ill
Husbandry, and restore them to a good Condition: And it
must be owned that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is capable both to satisfie
the Ambition of his Subjects, and to reward their Services;
and indeed many of his Subjects fill up the Places of divers <HI>So∣vereign
Princes,</HI> which were the most eminent Men of their
Age.</P>
<P>The difference is very remarkable between those <HI>Sovereigns</HI>
heretofore, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at present; it is less to their
Birth, than as to their Merit; for the Families of the great
Lords are very Illustrious, there's many of them that are de∣scended
from the Kings of <HI>Castille, Navarre, Arragon</HI> and <HI>Por∣tugal;</HI>
but yet this does not hinder several of them (for I make
an exception) from contradicting the vertue of their Ancestors,
but then let's see how these are educated: They do not study,
neither have they any able Masters; as soon as they are designed
for the Sword, no further care is taken to teach them either
Latin or History; but one would think they should at least be
taught what belongs to their Art, such as the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> to
<HI>Fence,</HI> and <HI>Ride</HI> the Horse; but they do not so much as think of
these matters. Here are no <HI>Academies,</HI> nor Masters to teach
such things; the young Men pass that time which they should
employ for their Instruction, in a wretched Laziness, either in
walking about, or courting some Lady; and yet in spight of
all this, they are perswaded, that there are not any People in
the World which deserve publick Admiration more than they
do. They believe <HI>Madrid</HI> to be the very Center of all Glory
and Happiness, of all Arts and Sciences, and of all Delights and
Pleasure; in dying, they only wish their Children the enjoy∣ment
of <HI>Paradise,</HI> and afterwards that of <HI>Madrid;</HI> by this means
you see they exalt this City above <HI>Paradise,</HI> with so much satis∣faction
do they live in't. And 'tis this which hinders them from
visiting other Courts, and there acquiring that <HI>Politeness</HI> which
they have not amongst themselves, and to which they are per∣fect
<PB N="211" REF="220"/>
Strangers. And 'tis this also which makes them so eager to
return home to <HI>Madrid,</HI> let them be where they will, whe∣ther
they be sent by the King, or let them be there in what
Rank or Station they will; let them be never so much honoured,
and heap up never so much Wealth, yet the love to their Coun∣try,
and the Prepossession for that, hath such a power over
them, as to make them renounce every thing; and they had
rather choose to lead a mean poor Life, (so it be not observed)
without any Train, Grandeur or Distinction, provided it be
but at <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>It is very seldom that a Father lets his Son travel abroad but
keeps him at home, and suffers him to take up what Customs
he pleases; you may easily believe, that generally these are none
of the best; for there's a certain Age, when Youth aims at no∣thing
else, but to gratifie their Appetite, and enjoy Pleasures.
One entices and draws another, and that which ought to be
severely reproved, is authorized by the Example of those, on
whom they depend. Add to this, That they make them marry
as one may say, as soon as they are out of the Cradle.
At the Age of sixteen or seventeen years they turn into
the World a young Man with a Wife that is but a Child, and
this at once makes him less capable to know his Duty, and puts
him upon being more debauched, because he is his own Master
under no controul: By this means, he passes his Life in a Chim∣ney-corner,
like a Man in his decriped old Age; and because
this gentle Sluggard is of an Illustrious Family, he must be cho∣sen
to govern a People that must suffer through his Ignorance,
but that which is yet worse, is, That such a Man taking himself
for some great and knowing Person, acts only by his own head,
without consulting or advising with any body, and so does every
thing Aukwardly and absurdly. The Wise it may be, is not
better stored with Wit and Parts, her mighty greatness, with
which she prides her self, is the only thing that can make her
be regarded, and thus Persons of the highest Capacity, must be
subject to two Animals, which are made their Superiours.</P>
<P>But on the other hand, let us be just, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and render to <HI>Cesar</HI>
his due. It must be owned, that when Heaven hath been so
kind to a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> as to give him a good Education, and let
him travel and see the World, he makes a better improvement
than any body. Nature has been kinder to them than they are
to themselves, they are born with more Wit than others, they
have a great quickness of Mind joyned with great Solidity, they
speak and deliver their words with ease, they have a great Me∣mory,
their Style is ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and concise, and they are quick of
<PB N="212" REF="221"/>
Apprehension. It is easie to teach them whatever they have
mind to; they are perfect Masters in Politicks, and when there's
a Necessity for't, they are temperate and laborious. Without
question, several great Qualities may be found amongst them,
such as Generosity, Secresie, Friendship, Bravery, and in a
word, all those Endowments of Mind, which go to make up a
perfect, good, and vertuous Man. And here methinks, I have
a fair opportunity to conclude this Letter, and to beget in you
an esteem of these People. I should not be sorry, if I could
procure them this Happiness; for their Manners do not suit so
ill with me, as with a great many others, who cry out against
them, and condemn them, before they have either examined or
known them. For my part, I must needs say, that there is
here, both good and bad, as there is in all other parts of the
World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>HEre's a general rejoycing since the arrival of the Mar∣quess
<HI>de los Balbaces,</HI> who brought certain News that the
most <HI>Christian King</HI> had granted <HI>Mademoisel</HI> to the King of
<HI>Spain.</HI> He so impatiently expected these Tydings, that there
was hardly an hour passed, that he did not ask if the <HI>Courrier</HI>
was not come; and as soon as he knew it, he immediately went
to hear <HI>Te Deum</HI> at our Lady <HI>de Atocha's</HI> Church. As the Ladies
do not go thither, so they are content to dress themselves
very fine, and place themselves in their Windows. I chose
this, and I thought I should have been both choaked and blind∣ed,
it was so excessive dusty. I saw the King in his Coach of
green Oyl-cloth; he had but a small attendance, for some twen∣ty
Halbardiers clothed in yellow with trust breeches like the Pa∣ges,
made up his Guard, marching before and behind him.
The Courtiers Coaches indeed that accompanyed him, were so
numerous that they could hardly be told; the People every
where crowding, even to the tops of the Houses, cryed out
<HI>Viva el Roy Deos le Bendiga,</HI> and several added, <HI>Viva el Reina
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uestra Seinnora.</HI> There was not the least House or Street with∣out
<PB N="213" REF="222"/>
out its spread Tables; every body had their Garlick, Leeks and
Onions in their hands, insomuch that they perfumed the Air
with them, and they were even debauched with drinking their
Majesty's Health in Water. For dear Cousen, though I have al∣ready
mentioned it to you, yet methinks I may repeat it here,
That there never was People more temperate as these, especially
in Wine; and they have so strange an abhorrence for those
that are guilty of Intemperance, that by their Law, a Man that
can be proved but once to have been drunk, is refused for being
a Witness in any Court of Justice where he is offered, and after
a sharp reproof is sent away. And if it happen, that one calls
another <HI>Boracho,</HI> that is <HI>Drunkard,</HI> this Injury is sure to be re∣venged
with Murther.</P>
<P>That Night the King was at <HI>Antocha;</HI> we illuminated all our
Houses with great Flamboys of white Wax which they call <HI>Ha∣chas;</HI>
they are longer than those that are used in <HI>Paris,</HI> to light
the Coaches at night, but withal, they are a great deal dearer,
not only because the Wax is brought at great Charges from o∣ther
Parts of the World, but also because there is a prodigious
quantity of it consumed in <HI>Spain.</HI> And when they make Illu∣minations,
they are not contented to set up four or six Flam∣boys,
but they must put two in every Balcony, and two at each
Window up to the highest Story; there are some Houses which
thus require four or five hundred. Every where there were
Bonefires made, and we went to the Palace to see a <HI>Masquerade</HI>
of a hundred and fifty Lords, which they said was to be there.
I cannot imagine why they call this Diversion by that Name,
for they were not all <HI>maskt;</HI> commonly they choose the
darkest Night. All the Courtiers are mounted upon their finest
Horses, every Horse was covered with Silver Gauze and Hou∣sings
embroidered with Gold and Pearl. The <HI>Cavalleros</HI> were
cloathed in Black, with coloured Taby Sleeves, embroidered with
Silk and Bugles; they wore little Hats buttoned up with Dia∣monds,
and in them a Plume of Feathers, they had rich Scarfes
and many Jewels; but with all this, their Black Cloaks and their
ugly Collars strangely disfigure them. They ride a Horseback
like the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> that is, they as call it a <HI>Genita,</HI> their
Stirrups are so short, that their knees are even with, and rest
upon the Tops of the Horses shoulders. I cannot yet reconcile
my Eyes to this Fashion; they say, that thus they can better
raise and put themselves forth against any that assaults them.
But to return to the <HI>Masquerade,</HI> they all met together at an
appointed Place, which usually is at one of the Gates of the City.
The Streets through which they were to go, were all strewed
<PB N="214" REF="223"/>
with Sand, and on each side there was a kind of Chaffing
dishes set upon Poles, which besides the white Wax Flamboys
gave a great Light, there were also placed several very clear
Lanthorns in Windows, which made a very fine Show. Every
<HI>Cavallero</HI> had a great many Footmen, which were cloathed in
Cloath of Gold and Silver, they went by their Masters sides with
Flamboys. The Masters marcht four in a rank very softly, each
holding a Flamboy also, they went all over the City attended
with Trumpets, Timbrels, Bagpipes and Flutes, and when they
came to the Palace which was illuminated, and the Court co∣vered
with Sand, they took several Turns, and run and pusht
against one another with a Design to throw each other down
with these tricks. Prince <HI>Alexander de Parma,</HI> who is of a
prodigious bigness fell down, and the fall of him made as great
a noise as the shouting of a moderate high-hill, they had much
ado to carry him off, for he was grievously bruised with his
Fall, there were several of them with their great Spectacles
on, but particularly the Marquess <HI>De Astorgas,</HI> who does not
only wear them for gravity sake, but for need, for he is old,
but yet for all that, he is frolicksome, he will be <HI>Major Domo</HI> to
the young Queen, and he is a <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>And now I speak of a <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain, Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI>
told me t'other day a thing pleasant enough. His Father in
Law, who is the Marquess <HI>De Palacios,</HI> lives at a horrid pro∣fuse
rate, for it seems he is one of those profest Gallants of the
Ladies of the <HI>Palace,</HI> and to arrive to that, one must both
have a great deal of Wit, and shew abundance of Magnificence,
I mean a certain peculiar sort of Wit, that's neat and refined, he
must have choice Phrases and Expressions, and some ways and
modes not common, he must understand how to write both
in Prose and Verse, and that too better than another. In a
word, one must both talk and do in this <HI>Pallace</HI> Gallantry af∣ter
quite another rate than is used in the City. But to return
to the Marquess <HI>De Palacios.</HI> There was a publick Festival
appointed by the <HI>King,</HI> this Marquess wanted Money to ap∣pear
there, he is Lord of several Towns, it came into his head
to go down post to them, assoon as he arrived, at the first, he
caused Papers to be set up, That all those of that Town
which desired to be made <HI>Grandees,</HI> should immediately come to
him. There was not either Justice, Burgess or Tradesman,
which was not presently filled with vehement Ambitious de∣sires
for the <HI>Grandeza,</HI> his House was crowded with all sorts of
People, he agreed with them every one severally in private,
and got as much as he could of them, and afterwards he made
<PB N="215" REF="224"/>
them all be covered before him, and gave them Patents in
Form just as the <HI>King</HI> does, when he makes any one a <HI>Grandee.</HI>
His Invention succeeded too well in the first Town, not to
practise it in the rest. He found amongst them the same Dis∣position
to give him Money, that through his means they
might be <HI>Grandees,</HI> with this trick, he got a considerable Sum,
and away he comes, and makes a splendid shew at Court. But
as a Man is never without Enemies, so they were some Per∣sons
that had a mind to make use of this pleasant Frolick to
put him out of the <HI>King's</HI> Favour. His Majesty was told of it,
and the Marquess justified himself well enough, in saying all
those to whom he had granted permission to be covered before
him, being born his Vassals, they owed more respect than to
dare to take this liberty without his leave, and that therefore he
had made them <HI>Grandees,</HI> as to himself. And after this the
thing was only lookt upon as a merry jest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marquess</HI> comes often to see us, and as he belonged to the
late Court, so yesterday he told me, that a famous <HI>Astrologer</HI>
being one day with the late <HI>King</HI> in the Terrass-walk of the
Pallace, the <HI>King</HI> asked him the height of that Place, he gazed
up into the Air, and named a certain Height. The <HI>King</HI> pri∣vately
ordered them to raise the Pavement of the <HI>Terrass</HI> about
three or four fingers, and in the Night it was done. The next
Morning he caused the <HI>Astrologer</HI> to come to him, and being up∣on
the Terrass with him, says he to him, <HI>I</HI> spoke last night of
the height you told me of this Walk, but there was some that
maintained that you were mistaken. Sir says he, I dare say, I
was not mistaken. But consider it well says the <HI>King,</HI> and after∣wards
we'll make him ashamed, which boasts himself to be a more
knowing man than you. Immediately he began again to make
his Observations, the <HI>King</HI> saw him change his colour, and seem
to be at a great loss, but at last he drew nigh the <HI>King,</HI> and
said, what I told your Majesty Yesterday was true, but to day
I find that either the <HI>Terrass</HI> is raised, or the Heavens are sunk
down a little lower. The <HI>King</HI> smiled, and told him the trick
he had put upon him.</P>
<P>That I may give you an Account of others matters. I must
tell you that the <HI>King</HI> has in his Family three Persons which
by way of Eminency are called, the great Officers, the <HI>Mayor
Domo Mayor,</HI> the <HI>Sumiller of the Body,</HI> and the <HI>Master of the Horse.</HI>
These three Places are thus distinguisht, the <HI>Mayor Domo</HI> com∣mands
in the <HI>Palace,</HI> the Business of the <HI>Sumiller</HI> of the Body,
is in the <HI>King's</HI> Chamber, and the Master of the Horse, orders
all things in every Place, except the <HI>Palace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="225"/>
After these come the Gentlemen of the <HI>Kings</HI> Bed-chamber,
they wear at their Girdle for a mark of their Dignity, a gold∣en
Key. There are three sorts of these Keys; the first, gives
the Employment of the Gentleman of the Bed-chamber; the
second, the Entrance with the Employment; and the third is
called <HI>Clava Capona,</HI> which only gives Entrance into the Anti-chamber.
The Number of these Gentlemen is great, there are
Forty of those for Service, which take it in turns every day,
and for the most part they are <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> The <HI>Mayor
Domo,</HI> that is to say, the <HI>Steward</HI> in Ordinary, have the same
Access as the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber. The Persons of
highest Quality fill up these Places, for the most part they are
the second Sons of the <HI>Grandees,</HI> they wait in turns every
Week, and when the High-Steward is absent, they are invest∣ed
with his Power, these also introduce <HI>Foreign</HI> Ministers when
they have Audience, there are eight of them, sometimes more,
but seldom fewer.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> hath three Companies for his Guards, but they
have not any thing that agrees with one another. The Mar∣quess
<HI>De Falces</HI> commands the <HI>Flemish</HI> or <HI>Burgundian</HI> Guard, it
consists of a hundred <HI>Halbardiers,</HI> and although here, they call
them the Yeomen of the Guard, yet they may be called the Life
Guard; the <HI>German</HI> Guard consists of the same Number, <HI>Don
Pedro De Arragon</HI> is Captain of it, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Guard is also com∣posed
of a hundred Halbardiers, and are commanded by the
Count <HI>De los Arcos.</HI> He is likewise Captain of another Company
of a hundred <HI>Spaniards,</HI> called the Guards of the <HI>Lancilla,</HI> and
this never appears, but at great Ceremonies, and at the Funerals of
Kings. The Affairs of the State are managed by a chief Minister
which they call <HI>Privado,</HI> he hath under him a Secretary of
State, whose Office is in the Pallace. All Business that comes
to the King and the Minister, ought not to pass directly through
his hands, and as he dispatches also what ever the King orders,
so he is called <HI>Secretario del despacho Vniversal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Council</HI> of State, and divers other <HI>Councils</HI> examine all
matters, and the <HI>King</HI> or the <HI>Chief Minister,</HI> afterwards de∣termine
them, there are a great many Counsellors. Here fol∣low
the Names of those which at present compose the Coun∣cil
of <HI>State, Viz.</HI> The <HI>Constable de Castile</HI> of the Family of
the <HI>Valesaco's,</HI> is the President, the Duke <HI>De Albe,</HI> the Duke
<HI>De Medecina Celi, Don Pedro de Arragon,</HI> the Admiral of <HI>Cast∣ile,</HI>
the Marquess <HI>De Astorgas,</HI> the Prince <HI>De Stillano,</HI> the Duke
<HI>De Ossuna,</HI> the Count <HI>De chincon, Don Vincent Gorzaga,</HI> Prince
<HI>De Guastalla, Don Lewis Portocarrero</HI> Cardinal Archbishop of
<PB N="217" REF="226"/>
<HI>Tolledo,</HI> the Marquess <HI>De Liches,</HI> the Marquess <HI>De los Balbaros,
Don Diego Sarmituto, Don Melchios Navarre,</HI> the Marquess <HI>De
Losveler,</HI> the Marquess <HI>De Mansera,</HI> and the Duke <HI>De Albur∣querque.</HI></P>
<P>Besides this Council, which is the principal, there is that
of the <HI>Inquisition of War,</HI> of the Orders of <HI>Arragon,</HI> of the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
of <HI>Italy,</HI> of <HI>Hazienda,</HI> of the <HI>Croisado,</HI> and of <HI>Flanders,</HI>
there is also the Chamber of <HI>Castile,</HI> of the <HI>Alcades de Corta,</HI>
of the <HI>Contraduria, De Aposento, Delas Bosques Reales, De Mil∣liones,</HI>
and <HI>De Competancias.</HI> But do not think, dear Kinswo∣man,
that the Salleries and Profits of those Places are small.
For instance, The Counsellors of the Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI>
make from eighteen to twenty thousand Crowns a Year of their
Places. And here it is pertinent to tell you, that 'tis thought
no Places are sold in this Country, at least it is not known; in
all appearance they are bestowed upon Merit or Birth, but yet
understand, there are such considerable Presents made, that
to get a <HI>Vice Royalty,</HI> they'll give Five thousand Pistols, and
sometimes more. That which would be called <HI>Bying</HI> in ano∣ther
Countrey, at <HI>Madrid</HI> is termed giving a <HI>Regalio,</HI> that is,
making a Present, and one is equivalent to the other, with this
difference, that a Place, or a Government which one <HI>buys,</HI> is
yours as long as you live, and sometimes passes by Inheritance
to your Children, either by natural Right, or the Concession
of the Prince; but in <HI>Spain</HI> they enjoy a Place which cost
them very dear, only three or five Years at most. It is easie
to believe that those who advance so much, are very certain
to reimburse themselves both Principal and Interest. From
this Practice the People are horribly opprest, they have perpe∣tually
upon them, either a new <HI>Vice Roy,</HI> or Governour, which
comes from draining him, of all the ready-Money which he
could either make of his own and sometimes of his Friends, to
bribe the <HI>Court.</HI> Thus he comes hungry, and he has but a short
time to enrich himself, and so the poor People are on all hands
pillaged, without so much as being able to have their Com∣plaints
heard. But it is yet quite another thing in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
where Gold is so plentiful, and they are so far from the <HI>King</HI>
and his Ministers. It is certain they bring from thence im∣mense
Sums, as I think, I have already intimated to you, even
the <HI>Religious</HI> as they call them, who are sent to preach there,
return not without forty and fifty thousand Crowns, which
they have heaped up in four or five Years time; so notwith∣standing
their <HI>Vow of Poverty,</HI> they find out the secret of grow∣ing
rich; and during their Life they are suffered to enjoy the
Fruit of their <HI>Mission.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="227"/>
The <HI>Monasteries</HI> here, have yet another piece of Craft, which
commonly succeeds, when a <HI>Religious</HI> Person or <HI>Fryer</HI> happens
to be the only Son, if his Father is rich, they beg him to
leave his Estate to the <HI>Convent,</HI> where his Son has taken the
Habit, upon condition that he shall manage and enjoy it whilst
he lives, but after his Death that the <HI>Monastery</HI> shall inherit it,
and put up Prayers and say <HI>Masses</HI> for the Father and the Son.
By this means there are professed <HI>Fryars</HI> which have ten thou∣sand
Crowns a Year, at their disposal. This Affluence in a
Country where reason has but little power over the Affections,
does not always make them more holy; and if there are any
that use it well, there are abundance which abuse it.</P>
<P>It is known, that every year there comes from the <HI>Indies,</HI> a∣bove
five and thirty Millions of Crowns, but yet not a quarter
part of this ever goes into the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain's</HI> Coffers. These
Treasures spread themselves over all <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>French, English,
Dutch,</HI> and the <HI>Genoeses</HI> draw away the best shares of it. Methinks,
this does not suit with the refined Policy of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to
waste their own Subjects in digging Gold out of the Mines, to
let other Nations, with whom they are often at War, reap the
Profit; but the natural Laziness which hinders them from wor∣king,
and having no Manufactures of their own, obliges them
to have recourse to those who can furnish their Country with
the Merchandizes they want.</P>
<P>As Strangers dare not venture to go there, because it is upon
no less penalty than hanging, so they contrive to send their
effects in the Names of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchants, with whom
they meet with all the Fidelity imaginable; and if the <HI>King</HI>
would, he could not hinder Strangers from receiving what is
properly theirs; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon this occasion, had
rather loose their Lives, than any wrong should come to ano∣ther.
There's one thing remarkable, and that is, when the
<HI>Flota</HI> comes to an Anchor at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> there are Men who make
publick profession to assist in cheating the <HI>King</HI> of his Customs
upon Silver and other Merchandizes. It is as much their Trade
and livelihood, as for a Banker to deal in Money. They call
them <HI>Metadors;</HI> and as much Knaves as they are towards the
<HI>King,</HI> yet one must do them the right to say, they are not so
to the private men which agree with them for a certain reward,
securely to lodge their Silver in such a place of the City as
they shall desire. And this practice is so certain and safe,
that one never hears of any that have violated their Trust: It
were easie to punish these men for the Frauds they are guilty
<PB N="219" REF="228"/>
of against the <HI>King,</HI> but there would be inconveniences to the
prejudice of Trade, perhaps far greater, than the Punishments
would bring Advantage; so that the Government and Magi∣strates
take no notice of what passes. There might also be an
easie remedy found out to hinder the <HI>King</HI> from losing all upon
this occasion; and that is, to abate the Duties a little, which
indeed are very high, and so what is given to these <HI>Metadors,</HI>
and somewhat more, might be paid to the <HI>Contrataction,</HI> for na∣turally
the Merchants do not love cheating, and are continually
afraid of paying at once, what they have been saving for
half a score Voyages; but 'tis humour of the <HI>Spaniards, To have
all or nothing,</HI> and very often they have <HI>nothing.</HI> As to <HI>Madrid,</HI>
it is impossible to find there any greater Robbers and Cheats
than the Magistrates and Officers themselves; these are the Men,
that with Impunity appropriate to themselves the <HI>Kings</HI> Customs,
and who cheat him after such a rate, that 'tis no wonder if he
so often wants Money: but they are not satisfied with cheating
their <HI>Sovereign,</HI> they must also abuse and pillage the <HI>People;</HI>
and although the Laws of this Nation are not only very just,
but equitable, yet no Body seems to be sensible of them:
Those very Persons into whose Hands they are put, and who are
set on purpose to execute them, are the first that break and cor∣rupt
them.</P>
<P>If you'll but give Money to an <HI>Alcade,</HI> or to an <HI>Alguazil,</HI>
you may have the most innocent Persons in the World arrested
or seized, and then thrown into some nasty dark hole of a
Prison, and there perish with hunger, without any proceeding
or coming to a Tryal, and without any Order and Decree; and
when the poor wretch is let out of Prison, he must not so much
as think of doing himself right against this wicked Officer of
Justice. This sort of People are generally much favoured e∣very
where, but here they are beyond all measure, and righteous
<HI>Judges</HI> in this Country are more scarce than in any Country
whatever.</P>
<P>Thieves, Murderers, Poysoners, and the greatest Criminals
imaginable, remain safe and quiet at <HI>Madrid,</HI> provided they
are not rich, for if they be, they are sure to be disturbed for the
sake of that.</P>
<P>They do not judge <HI>Criminal</HI> Matters above twice or thrice a
year; it is with the greatest difficulty that they bring them∣selves
to cause any Criminal to dye, who is, say they, a man
like them, their Country-man, and the <HI>King's</HI> Subject; they
send most either to the Mines, or to the Gallies, and when a∣ny

Wretch is condemned to be hanged, he is carryed upon an
Ass, with his Face to the Tail; he is cloathed in black, and
a Scaffold is erected for him, that he may make a Speech to
the People, who are all upon their Knees, and in Tears, beat∣ting
themselves upon their Breasts▪ After he has spent what
time he will in his Harangue, he is dispatched with a great deal
of Gravity; and as these Examples of Justice are very rare, so
they make a mighty impression upon the Spectators.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the vast Riches, and the excessive haughti∣ness
and Presumption of the great <HI>Lords,</HI> yet they obey the
least Order of the <HI>King,</HI> with that exactness, and respect which
cannot be sufficiently praised. Upon the first Command, they
depart, they return, go to Prison, or into Banishment, with∣out
murmuring. It is not possible to find a more perfect Sub∣mission
and Obedience, nor a more sincere Lover, than that of
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for their <HI>King.</HI> This Name is Sacred with them,
and to bring them to whatever one has a mind, it is sufficient
to say, <HI>The Kings Will it is;</HI> 'tis under his Name, that the poor
People of both the <HI>Castiles</HI> are so horribly opprest with Taxes,
the other <HI>Kingdoms</HI> or <HI>Provinces</HI> are not so loaded, but boast
themselves for the most part, that they are a free People, and
pay what they had a mind to.</P>
<P>I have already hinted to you, dear Cousen, that in every
thing they exactly follow the <HI>Politicks</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> V. without
considering that the difference of times makes a mighty altera∣tion
in the Events of things, although they may seem to be
alike, and in the same Circumstances; and that what with∣out
the imputation of rashness might have been undertaken
120 years ago under a flourishing reign, would be impudent
to practise now under a Reign that is far less so: but a Vanity
that is natural to them, hinders them from seeing, that <HI>Pro∣vidence</HI>
sometimes permits <HI>Empires,</HI> as well as particular <HI>Fami∣lies</HI>
to have their Revolutions and Periods. The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
believe themselves to be just the same People, and in the same
Circumstances they ever were; but though I never knew their
Ancestors, yet I dare say they deceive themselves.</P>
<P>But not to make any farther Reflexions, which perhaps are
too serious and high for me, I will tell you, that here's a ge∣neral
rejoycing at <HI>Madrid</HI> for the arrival of the <HI>Flota</HI> from
the <HI>Indies.</HI> As 'tis not their humour here to treasure up
Wealth, so this prodigious quantity of Silver, which comes
all at a lump, is spread over all the World. One would think
that these immense Sums cost nothing, and that it is Money
which chance sent them. Hereupon the great <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds</HI> summon
<PB N="221" REF="230"/>
their Creditors, and pay them with a profuseness, which yet
without lying, has something in't that is both noble and very
generous; for there are but few Countries where Liberality is
so natural, as 'tis in this; and I must also add, that they are
patient even to admiration. They have been known to endure
most long and toilsome <HI>Sieges,</HI> in which besides the Fatigues
of War, they had nothing to support them but Bread made of
rotten Corn, and stinking Water for their Drink; and yet
there are no Men in the World more nice about good Water.
I say, notwithstanding all this, and that they have been ex∣posed
to the Severities of the Weather, were half naked and
had hard Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging, yet in spight of all these things, they have
been found more brave and couragious, than when they en∣joyed
Plenty and Prosperity. It is true, that that Temperance
which is so natural to them, is a mighty help to them to en∣dure
hunger when they are sorced to it, they eat very little,
and scarcely will they drink any Wine. The Custom they have
of eating all alone, contributes something to make them so fru∣gal;
for indeed, neither their Wives nor their Children, ever
eat with them. The Master has his Table to himself, and the
Mistress with her Children sit on the Floor upon a Carpet after
the <HI>Turkish</HI> and <HI>Moorish</HI> way. They seldom or never invite
their Friends to feast together, so that they are not guilty of a∣ny
excess. Upon this account it is their saying, <HI>That they
only eat to live,</HI> whereas there are People, <HI>which only live to eat.</HI>
Nevertheless there are some rational People, which finds this
affection too great; and as they admit of little familiarity
in Conversation, so they perpetually live at a distance, and as
'twere in Ceremony with one another, without enjoying that
freedom which makes that true Union, and produces that desi∣rable
openness of Heart.</P>
<P>This great Retirement gives them up to a thousand Illusions,
which they call <HI>Philosophy;</HI> it makes them singular, dull, fan∣tastick,
melancholy and Jealous, whereas if they governed them∣selves
otherwise, there's nothing they would not be capable
of, since they have a wonderful vigour of Mind, an excellent
Memory, good Sense, a solid Judgment, and great Patience,
than which, there needs no more to make a Man wise, to grow
in Perfection, to be agreeable in Conversation, and to distin∣guish
himself from the most Polite Nation. But they are so far
from being what naturally they might be, though at never so
little pains, that they affect a certain Indolency which they call
greatness of Mind; they neglect their most important business,
and the advancement of their Fortunes. Provision for the fu∣ture,
<PB N="222" REF="231"/>
gives them not the least disturbance; the only matter
they are not indifferent in, is Jealous; they improve that to
the utmost, the bare suspicion is enough to make them stab
their Wife or their Mistress. Their Passion of Love is always
furious, and yet the Women please themselves in it; they say,
they would not for all the mischief that may befal them, have
them less sensible of their unfaithfulness; that their desperate
Temper is a certain proof of a true Passion, and that they
themselves are not more moderate when they are in Love.
They leave nothing unattempted to be revenged of those they
love, if they forsake them without cause; so that these sort of
amorous Engagements have commonly a fatal end. For in∣stance,
not long since, a Woman of Quality, who had a cause
to complain of her Gallant, contrived to get him into a House
where she commanded, and after she had sufficiently reproach'd
him, against which he did but weakly defend himself, for he
was guilty; she presented to him a Ponyard, and a Cup of poy∣soned
Chocolate, leaving him only the liberty which sort of
Death he would choose: He did not waste one minute to move
her pitty, he very well saw, that in this Place she was the
strongest, so that he tamely drank off the Chocolate without
leaving a drop. After he had drunk it, says he to her, it had
been better if you had put a little more. Sugar in't, for the Poy∣son
made it very bitter; remember to do so the next time
you prepare another. He was immediately seized with Convul∣sions;
it was very violent poyson, and killed him in an hours
time; and for all this Lady still loved him passionately, yet she
had the barbarity not to stir from him till he was dead.</P>
<P>The <HI>Venetian</HI> Ambassador, who is a very well accomplished
Man, being lately at home, they brought him word, that a
Lady covered with a Mantle desired to speak with him, and that
she hid her self so close, they could not possibly see what she
was: she had with her two Gentlemen Ushers, and a conside∣rable
Attendance. He invited her to his Chamber of <HI>Audience,</HI>
and she desired he would cause every body to go out. When
she was alone with him, she unveiled her self, and appeared to
him extream handsome. <HI>I am of an Illustrious Family,</HI> says she
to him, <HI>my Name is</HI> Donna Blanca de Gusman; <HI>I have despised
all the Laws of Decency, in Favour of that Passion I have for you,
I came to declare to you, my Lord, and to tell you, that I must
needs remain here this Night.</HI> From such an impudent Speech,
the Ambassador could not in the least doubt, that this was some
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that had borrowed a great Name, to draw him into some
Snare, but yet with abundance of kindness, told her, that
<PB N="223" REF="232"/>
till now he had never thought himself unhappy in the Service
of the <HI>Republick,</HI> that he could wish he were not an <HI>Ambassa∣dor,</HI>
that so he might embrace the Favour she offered him; but
that being in such a Station, there was little likelyhood that he
could give Entertainment to a Person of her Eminent Quality,
that this might bring him into great trouble, and therefore
begged her that she would withdraw. Immediately she was like
a Fury, and after she had reviled and reproached him, she drew
out a <HI>Stilletto,</HI> and run upon him to have stab'd him. He easily
prevented her, and having called one of his Gentlemen, bid
him give five or six Pistols to this Woman. She so little de∣served
this Generosity, and it so appeased her, that she really
told him, she was one of those Creatures he took her for, and
that the reason why she had been so desperate, was, that the
Gentlemen Ushers, who waited for her below, were her Gal∣lants,
and would have broke her bones if she had made no ad∣vantage
of the Plot they had laid; that besides, she was to
pay for the Equipage she came in, which was hired purposely
for this design, and that she had much rather have dyed, than
to have endured all those Abuses. The Ambassador was so taken
with her pleasant Confession, that he caused ten Pistols more to
be given her; for, says he to her, since so many honest Folks
must share with you, your part will be too small. She succeeded
so well here, that she went directly to the <HI>French</HI> Embassadors,
but she was not so courteously received there: For upon the first
Apprehension of her Design, she and her Attendance escaped
very narrowly of being entertained with the Strapado. He gave
her not a Sous, happy was she that got out as she came in, for
he had an aversion for all these Creatures.</P>
<P>This Morning we tarried a while in the <HI>Placa Mayor,</HI> for an
Answer of a Message my Kinswoman had sent to a Gentleman
that dwelt there. In this Place Fish is sold, and there was a
Woman which had some little bits of Salmon to sell, which she
said was fresh; she made a horrid noise in crying it, and in
calling Customers to buy it, at last comes a Shooemaker, which
I knew for such, because she called him <HI>Sinior Capatero;</HI> he askt
her for a Pound of her Salmon (and by the way, you must ob∣serve,
that every thing here is bought by the pound, even
Wood and Charcoal) says she to him, you do not enquire after
the price, because you think 'tis cheap, but do not deceive your
self, assure you, I must have a Crown for every pound. The
Shooemaker vext that she questioned his thoughts and ability,
with an angry tone said to her, <HI>had it been very cheap I would
have had but one pound, but since 'tis dear, I'll have three,</HI> and im∣mediately
<PB N="224" REF="233"/>
he gives her three Crowns, and then thrusting down
his little Hat (for you must know that the Tradesmen wear
them as narrow as the People of Quality wear them broad, and
turning up his <HI>Mustachios</HI> by way of Rodamentade, he raised
the point of his formidable Sword almost to the top of his shoul∣der,
and haughtily lookt at us, having well observed that we
took notice of him and overheard his Discourse and were Stran∣gers;
but the pleasantness of the thing lies here, perhaps these
three Crowns was all that ever this vain-glorious Fool had in the
World, that this was his whole Weeks profit, and that to morrow,
himself, his Wife and poor Children, would have a more severe
Fast, than with Bread and Water, but such is the vain humour
of these People here, nay there are some of them which will
take the legs of a Capon, and will let them hang down under
their Cloaks, that they may look as if they really had a Capon,
whilst they have nothing but the Legs and Feet.</P>
<P>You cannot see a Joyner, a Sadler, or other sort of Shop∣keeper,
without his Velvet and Sattin Suit like the Kings, with
his long Rapier and Dagger, and his Guattar hang up in his
Shop. They work as little as ever they can, for I have more
than once told you, that they are naturally lazy. Indeed no∣thing
but <HI>over-ruling Necessity</HI> drives them to do any thing at all,
and then they work upon Sundays and other Festivals, without
any scruple, as well as upon any other Days, and afterwards
they carry their Goods abroad. If 'tis a Shoomaker and he has
two Prentices, he takes them both with him, and each of them
carry a Shooe, nay if he has three, they must all go along with
him, and 'tis with much ado, that he'll stoop to try the Shooes
he made; when he has done, he goes and sits him down in the
Sun (which is call'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Fire) with a Company of such
Idle Fellows as himself, and there with a sovereign Authority
they determine matters of State, and Settle the Interest of Prin∣ces;
very often they fall out about them, some one of them
that takes himself to be a more able Politician than the rest, will
have them yield to his Judgment, but another as conceited as
himself will not submit, and so they fall together by the Ears
without Mercy. I was two days ago to see the <HI>Danish</HI> Embas∣sadors
Lady, and there was brought in thither a poor Wretch
which was just then wounded in the Street; he was a Coster∣monger,
and it seems had maintained that the <HI>Grand Senior</HI>
would not be reckoned a cunning Politician if he did not cause
his Brother to be strangled; another to whom that young Prince
was not so displeasing, stood up in his defence, and thereupon
these two fell a fighting; but after all to give them their due,
<PB N="225" REF="234"/>
all these People talk of Government and Politicks with a great
deal of Judgment, and give good Reasons for what they say.</P>
<P>Here is in this City several Houses which are a sort of Acade∣mies,
where People meet some to Play, and others for Conver∣sation.
They play there with great honesty, and let them lose
what Sum they will upon Honour, they never fail to pay it in
twenty four hours. If there should be any failure, their Ho∣nour
and Reputation is for ever lost. No reason whatsoever
will be admitted against the necessity of paying in that time.
They play there very high and very fairly, without noise or
shewing the least vexation or concern: If they win, it is the Cu∣stom
to give the <HI>Barato;</HI> this I think is also used in <HI>Italy,</HI> that is
to say, you give Money to those that are present, to some more
to others less, and this whether you know them or no. He to
whom you present the <HI>Barato</HI> must never refuse it, let him be a
hundred times richer and better Quality than the Donour, nay
one may demand it of a Gamester that is winning, and he'll not
deny to give it. There are People that have no other Subsistance
than this, but yet this is no good Custom, for though a Man does
win, yet sometimes he hardly carries any thing of his gains away
with him, and if he begins to play again, he often loses his own.</P>
<P>Further, if a Man is found to have cheated, he has as good
betimes to forsake all Company; for no honest Person will
have any thing to do with him, and if he is taken in the fact,
he may think himself happy if he comes off with some <HI>Cuchilla∣des,</HI>
that is, some Cuts, but not Thrusts with a Sword.</P>
<P>As to the Conversation in these Academies, there's of it that
is very ingenious, and very knowing Persons that frequent them,
for in a word they are here just as in other Places, and there
are some that write very fine things. What they call <HI>Novels</HI>
seem to me to be of a Stile, and to have an Air that charms,
they never advance any thing but what's probable, and the Sub∣jects
they take is so well managed, and their Narration so con∣cise
and plain, neither mean nor lofty, that one must needs
grant they have a Genius, which surpasses all others, in these
sort of pieces. I will endeavour to get some of this kind, and
will translate, and send them to you, that so you may judge of
them your self. As I have not capacity enough to speak of
things which treat of more sublime matters, so shall I say no∣thing
of them till I have been informed by those that are com∣petent
Judges, and then I shall only pretend to be their Eccho.
But after all I must needs say, that I think them extravagant in
their Elogies, and that in them they keep not near to probabi∣lity,
their Imagination, which is very lively and active, some
<PB N="226" REF="235"/>
times runs too fast. I was t'other day reading in a Book, where
speaking of <HI>Philip</HI> the VI. the Author said, that his Virtues and
great Qualities were so many, that there was not Paper enough
in the World to write them down; that a common Pen was not
worthy to describe such divine things, and therefore they de∣served
to be writ by the Rays of the Sun upon the surface of the
Heavens. You'll grant me that this is really losing a Mans self
in the Clouds, and that with endeavouring to exalt his <HI>Hero,</HI>
our poor Author fell and breaks his own Neck. Their Books
are very ill printed, their Paper is not white, and they are very
ill bound, being cover'd with Parchment or Sheep-skin Leather.</P>
<P>I must not forget to tell you one thing, and 'tis very material,
and that is the Policy of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which perswades them
rather to be at the charge of a hundred false Informations, than
to neglect the Opportunity of receiving one true Advice: nei∣ther
the distance of the Country from whence they come, nor
their Agents are suspected by them, they will know every thing
and liberally recompense those that serve them, nay they'l hardly
tarry till the Service is accept'd, before they will reward them. You
cannot believe how much advantage this Maxim has gain'd them,
they have been sometimes taken for Fools, but that has not dis∣couraged
them, and in the end they always had what they in∣tended.
It is likewise true, that though they have but very
slender ground to beg a Favour of the King, yet provided they
are not disheartened with Repulses, but pursue their first Design
with Perseverance, sooner or later they obtain what they wisht
for. The Ministers of State think it not suitable to the Grandeur
of so mighty a Monarch to refuse a small matter, and tho' there's
but little Justice in pretending to a favour which one has not de∣served
by some Service, yet if it is sued for without intermission,
it is always obtained. I see Examples of it every day.</P>
<P>I have not yet told you, dear Cosen, that upon my Arrival
here all the Ladies did me the Honour to visit me first. It is
the Custom here to prevent Strangers, when once they know
they are of Quality and their good Conduct, concerning both
which they are very nice. When I returned them their Visit,
every one made me a Present; sometimes in one House I re∣ceived
a Dozen, for even the Children of four Years old will
treat you. I was presented with great Baskets of guilt Silver, a∣dorned
with Coral curiously wrought in Flowers; these are
made at <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Millan:</HI> I had also amber Boxes set with
Gold, ennamell'd and full of Pastrils; divers presented me
with Gloves and with Silk-Stockings and Garters in abundance,
but these Gloves are singular, in that they are as short as the
<PB N="227" REF="236"/>
Mens, for the Women wear their Sleeves down to their Wrists,
the Fingers are so long that they look as if they were nothing
else, and are ridiculous. The Stockings are made of <HI>Polo,</HI> that
is raw Silk; they are made so short and so little in the Foot,
that I have seen several Babies that they would not fit; the
Garters are of a broad Ribbond, made very light and thin, like
those our <HI>Peasants</HI> give at their Weddings; they are trimed at
each end with some <HI>English</HI> Thread Lace. They presented me
also with several Cups of that Mineral Earth, and a thousand
other things of this kind. If ever I go from hence, and make
another Journey hither, it will be my turn to present: But
alas! any thing pleases them, Needles, Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, a little Ribbond,
but above all, any thing made of their false Stones ravishes them
with Joy; they that have so many that are right and so excel∣lent,
yet wear a prodigious quantity of these false ones, which
in reality are nothing neither, but bitts of Glass sett, and just
like those our Chimney-sweepers sell to our <HI>Provincials,</HI> who
never saw more than their <HI>Curate</HI> and their Flock. The Ladies
of the greatest Quality are loaded with these false Stones which
they buy at dear rates; and when I askt them why they were so
fond of these counterfeit Diamonds, they told me it was because
they could have of them as big as they desired. And indeed
they have of them in their Pendants, as big as an Egg, and all
these come to them either from <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Italy;</HI> for as I have
told you, few things are made at <HI>Madrid,</HI> Idleness reigns too
much there.</P>
<P>There's no good Painters in this City, the greatest part of
those that draw, are not of this Country; they are either <HI>Flem∣mings,
Italians</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> which come and settle here; but yet
they do not grow rich, for Money does not come and move in
the circle of Trade. For my part, I must needs say, I never
saw less stirring. My Kinswoman receives pretty considerable
Sums all in <HI>Quartos;</HI> it is <HI>Copper</HI> Money, and as nasty as our
<HI>Doubles;</HI> but as bad as 'tis, yet it comes out of the <HI>Royal</HI> Trea∣sures;
it is delivered by Weight (for how is't possible to count
such sorry stuff?) and Men bring it upon their backs in great
matted Baskets; when these sort of Payments come, the whole
House is employed for eight days together in taking an Account
of these <HI>Quartos</HI> in three or four thousand Crowns, there's not
a hundred Pistols, either in Gold or Silver.</P>
<P>They have here great numbers of Slaves, which are bought
and sold at great rates, these are <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Turks;</HI> there are
some of them worth four or five hundred Crowns, heretofore
they had power of Life and Death over them, a <HI>Pat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> might
<PB N="228" REF="237"/>
have killed his Slave as he might have killed his Dog, but it was
thought that these Barbarities did not agree with the Maxims
of the Christian Religion, and now that Practice is forbid, but
yet they beat them till they cripple them, without ever being
called to account for't. It's true, there are but few Masters that
are thus severe; and if a Man happen to love his female Slave,
and she grants his desires she becomes immediately free. As
to the other Domesticks it would be somewhat dangerous to
use them ill; they pretend for the most part, to be of as good
Families as the Masters they serve; and if they should be a∣bused,
they would be in a capacity to revenge themselves, either
by Treacherously Murdering, or Poysoning of them, there are
many Examples of this, they say, that a Man ought not to in∣sult
over them, because they are poor, that though they are
reduced to serve, yet they have not renounced their Honour,
and that they should forfeit it, if they should take blows from
any body whatever.</P>
<P>The Beggars are even proud, and when they ask an Alms, it
is an imperious and domineering way; if one refuses them,
it must be done civilly, in saying to them, <HI>Cavallero, Per∣done,
us<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed no tanga moneda;</HI> that is, Pardon me <HI>Cavallero,</HI> I
have no Money. If you give them a rough Denial, they'll be∣gin
to argue with you, and undertake to prove to you, that
you do not deserve that Estate God has blest you with, and
will never let you alone, but if one speaks courteously to them,
they seem well enough content and desist.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally gentle and kind; they marry
their Slaves, and if it be with another Slave, the Children they
have are not free, but like their Fathers, are subject to the <HI>Pa∣tron,</HI>
but if these Children marry, their Issue shall not be Slaves.
And so it is, if a Woman Slave marry a Free-man, their Chil∣dren
follow the Condition of the Father. One is mighty well
served by these unhappy Wretches, they are far more diligent
laborious and humble than other Servants, there are few of
them that will change their Religion. I have one that is not
above nine years old, she is as black as Jett, and would be
reckoned in her own Country a wonderful Beauty, for her Nose
is quite flat, her Lips prodigiously thick, her Eyes of a white
and red colour, and her Teeth admirable in <HI>Europe</HI> as well as
in <HI>Africa.</HI> She understands not a word of any other Language
than her own, her Name is <HI>Zayde,</HI> we have got her baptized,
this young Christian has been so used to throw off her white
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antle, and to be quite naked when she was exposed to sale,
that I have had much ado to hinder her from doing so now.
<PB N="229" REF="238"/>
and t'other day, when we had a great deal of Company, I sent
for her, and truly Mrs. <HI>Zayde</HI> was pleased to appear before them
all with her little Black Body as naked as she was born. I am
resolved to have her whipt, to make her know that this sort of
fashion does not please me, for there is no other way to make
her understand. Those that sold her to me, told me she was
a Girl of <HI>Quality,</HI> and the poor Child will come often and fall
down on her Knees before me, hold her hands together, cry,
and point towards her Country. I would willingly send her
thither, if she could there be a Christian; but this impossibility
obliges me to keep her. I would fain understand her, for I be∣lieve
she is witty, all her Actions shew it, she dances after her
fashion, and 'tis so pleasantly, that she makes us very merry. I
make her wear white Patches, with which she is mightily taken.
She is drest as they are at <HI>Morocco,</HI> that is, with a short Gown
almost without any plights, great Shift-sleeves of fine Cloth,
striped with different colours, like those of our <HI>Bohemians</HI> or
<HI>Gypsies,</HI> a pair of Stays which are only made of a slip of Crim∣son
Velvet with a gold ground, and are made fast at the sides
with silver Buckles and Buttons, and a Mantle of very fine
white woollen stuff very large and long, in which she wraps her
self, and with one corner of it covers her Head. This dress is
handsome enough, her short Hair, which looks like Wool, is
cut in several places, on each side like a Half-moon, on the
Crown a Circle, and before a Heart; she cost me twenty
<HI>Pistols,</HI> my Daughter hath made her Governess of her <HI>Marmo∣sett;</HI>
it is the little Monkey which the Arch-bishop of <HI>Burgos</HI>
presented to her. I do assure you, that <HI>Zayde</HI> and the <HI>Marmo∣sett</HI>
are well met, and understand one another very well.</P>
<P>But to come to other things, here's arrived a Man which has
been fetched from the farthest parts of <HI>Galicia,</HI> he is such a
Saint, that he has done many Miracles, as 'tis pretended: The
Marchioness <HI>de loz Veloz,</HI> heretofore Governess of the King,
was like to dye, and she sent to have him come in all haste, but
they were so long upon the Journey, that she was well again
before he came. It was known what day he would arrive, and
while she was then expecting him, <HI>Don Fernand de Tolledo,</HI> who
is her Nephew, and had not seen her since his return from
<HI>Flanders,</HI> because of her having been sick, knowing that she was
then much better, happened to go to her House much about the
time the Saint of <HI>Galicia</HI> was to be there. The Marchioness's
People seeing him, and not knowing him at all (for he had
been absent several years) without considering that there were
few Men of his Age and Looks so happy as to work Miracles,
<PB N="230" REF="239"/>
concluded, at first sight, that he was the Saint: immediately
they threw open the great door, and rung the Bell for the sig∣nal,
as the Marchioness had ordered them; all the <HI>Duennas</HI> and
the maids came to receive him with every one a Wax-Candle
in her hand; several of them fell upon their Knees, and would
not let him stir till he had given them his blessing. He thought
they made a fool of him, to give him such a reception; he
knew not whether he was bewitched, or whether he dreamt,
and do what he could, he could not perswade himself that all
this was real, it was to no purpose to talk to them, they mind∣ed
him not at all, the noise and the crowd was so great; they
brought their Beads to touch him, and those that were far off
him, threw them at his Head, with a hundred Medals fastened
to them. The most zealous began to cut his Cloak and his
Cloaths, and now his fear began to be very great, lest through
a desire to multiply his <HI>Relicks,</HI> they did not cut him to pieces.
The Marchioness <HI>de Loz Veloz,</HI> who was carried between four in
a great Elbow-Chair, came to meet the Holy Man: and truly
when she perceived the mistake, and saw it was her Nephew,
she fell a laughing so loud and so long, that she far exceeded
the strength every body thought she had. When he came from
her House, he came to see us, all torn, and just as the devont
People had left him.</P>
<P>I should tell you, that all is mighty private and retired in this
Court; but here's the way and manner how some particular
Persons live. In the Morning as soon as they are up, they
drink Water cooled with Ice, and presently after Chocolate;
when Dinner time is come, the Master sits down to Table, his
Wife and Children, as I have already observed, eat upon the
Floor near the Table; this is not done out of respect, as they
tell me, but the Women cannot sit upon a Chair she is not
accustomed to it; and there are several ancient <HI>Spanish</HI> Wo∣men
which never sat upon one in their whole Life: they make
a light meal, for they eat little Flesh; the best of their food are
Pigeons, Pheasants, and their <HI>Olio's</HI> which are excellent; but
the greatest Lord has not brought to his Table above two Pi∣geons,
and some very bad Ragou, full of Garlick and Pepper,
and after that some Fennel and a little Fruit, when this little
Dinner is over, every one in the House undress themselves, and
lye down upon their Beds, upon which they lay <HI>Spanish</HI> Lea∣ther-Skins
for coolness; at this time you shall not find a soul
in the Streets; the Shops are shut, all Trade ceased, and it looks
as if every body were dead. At two a Clock in the Winter,
and at four in the Summer, they begin to dress themselves a∣gain,
<PB N="231" REF="240"/>
then eat Sweet-meats, drink either some Chocolate, or
Waters cooled in Ice, and afterwards every body goes where
they think fit; and indeed they tarry out till eleven or twelve
a Clock at Night, I speak of People that live regularly. Then
the Husband and Wife go to Bed, a great Table-Cloth is spread
all over the Bed, and each fastens it under their Chin; the <HI>He</HI>
and <HI>She</HI> Dwarfs serve up Supper, which is as frugal as the Din∣ner,
for it is either a Pheasant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en made into a Rago<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or some
Pastry business, which burns the Mouth, it is so excessively
Peppered. The Lady drinks her belly full of Water, and the
Gentleman very sparingly of the Wine, and when Supper is
ended, each goes to sleep as well as they can.</P>
<P>The unmarryed, or those who observe but few rules with their
Wives, after they have been taking the Air in the <HI>Prado,</HI> where
in Summer they go half naked in their Coaches; I mean when
'tis dark they get a light Supper, mount their Horses, and take
a Foot-man behind them, they do this that they may not lose
him: for going in the darkest Night through so many Streets
very quick, how should a Foot-man be able to turn and wind,
and follow his Master? But they are also afraid of being assault∣ed
behind, the Footman having no other care than to look a∣bout
him, is as it were the Sentinel, and ready to defend his
Master. There may be some which will do this, but most of
them in such cases run away, for they are not stout. This no∣cturnal
Ramble is upon the Ladies account, they then visit
them, and to gain an Empire, they would not neglect that op∣portunity.
They talk to them through the Lattice of their
Windows, sometimes they go into their Gardens, and when
they can into their Chambers. Their Passion is so violent, that
they'll look the greatest danger in the face; they'll go to the
very place where the Husband sleeps, and I have been told that
they'll see one another years together without daring to speak
one word, for fear of being heard. They are ignorant in <HI>France</HI>
what 'tis to love at the rate these People are said to love. And
not to mention the cares, the earnest desires, the nicety, and
the devoting of themselves up even to death, (for the Husband
and the Relations give no quarter) that which I admire is their
Fidelity and Secresie. It is never known, that a <HI>Cavallero</HI>
boasts of having received Favours from a Lady, they speak of
their Mistresses with so much respect and value, as if they were
their Soveraigns. And on the other hand, these Ladies never
desire to oblige any other than their Gallants, they are entirely
taken up with him, and although they cannot see him in the
day time, yet they have opportunity to employ several hours
<PB N="232" REF="241"/>
about him, either in writing to, or speaking of him with some
she Friend who is privy to the Intrigue; or else in waiting all
the day long, and looking through their Lattices to see him go
by. In a word, upon all that I have been told about these Mat∣ters,
I can easily believe, that <HI>Love</HI> had its Birth in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst the <HI>Cavalleros</HI> are with their Mistresses, their Foot∣men
look after their Horses at some distance from the House;
but there are very often unpleasant Mischances happen to them,
for there being no necessary places in their Houses, all night
long they throw that out of their Windows, which decency
hinders me from naming to you; so that the amorous <HI>Spaniard</HI>
which goes silently along the Street, is many times in a nasty
condition from head to foot, and though at his coming out he
was curiously perfumed, yet he is forced to return as fast as he
can to change his Cloths. This is one of the greatest Inconve∣niencies
in this City, and which renders it so stinking and filthy,
that in the Morning, one can hardly pass along the Streets. I
say in the Morning, for the Air is here so subtile and hot, that
all this nastiness is consumed before Noon. When a Horse, or
any other Animal dies, they throw him into the Street where he
happens to be, though it were before the Pallace-Gate, and the
next day you'll find him reduced to dust. They are perswaded,
that if they did not throw out their Filth and Carrion in this
manner into their Streets, <HI>Madrid</HI> would not be long without
the Plague, and it never is there.</P>
<P>But besides those ways that I have mentioned, that Gallants
have to see their Mistresses, they have yet others; for the La∣dies
visit one another frequently, and there is nothing more
easie for them than to wear a Vail, and by the back door go in∣to
a Chair, and be carryed where they will. And this is the more
practicable, because all the Women agree to keep one anothers
Secrets inviolably, let there be what Differences there will a∣mongst
them, and let them never be so angry one against ano∣ther,
yet they never open their lips to make the least Discove∣ry;
their Discretion cannot be sufficiently praised. It is true
indeed, the consequences would be more fatal if they did other∣wise,
since they make nothing here of murthering upon a bare
Suspicion.</P>
<P>After this manner, the Ladies make their Visits to one ano∣ther,
you must not go to see your Friend when you have a
mind, you must tarry till you are desired to come, and the Lady
that has a mind to be visited, writes a Letter in the Morning,
and invites you, you are carryed in a Chair which is extream
large every way, and that they may be the lighter, they are
<PB N="233" REF="242"/>
made only of a thin stuff hung upon a wooden frame, these
stuffs are always mixt with Gold and Silver, and are very rich,
they have in them three great Glasses, and the top is made of
a very thin Leather, lined as the rest, and it opens upwards, that
so one may go in and out very conveniently; to every Chair
there's four Bearers, which relieves one another, and a Footman
carries the Hat of the foremost; for let it be what Weather it
will, he must not be covered before his Mistress. The Lady is
set as fast in her Chair, as a Diamond-stone in a Ring; she ei∣ther
wears no Mantle or Vail then, or if she does, it has a black
<HI>English</HI> Lace set on it, half an Ell deep very fine and dear; this
is becoming enough: she has also a Coach with four Mules in
those long Traces I have formerly mentioned, which follows
softly after the Chair, that is commonly filled with old Gentle∣men-Ushers,
and five or six Pages, for every body has these, my
Banker's Wife has two. The Ladies never take any of their
Women with them, and though several of them are going to the
same place, yet they each of them take a Chair to themselves,
and do not go together in any one of their Coaches. I hap∣pened
t'other day, to be in a stop there was in a Street, and there
came by me fifty Chairs, and as many Coaches one after ano∣ther,
they came out of the Dutchess <HI>De Frias,</HI> and went to the
Dutchess <HI>De Ʋzeda</HI>'s House, I'll tell you why they went thither,
when I have first told you that when the Lady is come to her
House whom she goes to visit, the Chairmen carry her as far as
the Anti-chamber, the Stairs are made purposely very wide and
low, for the greater ease, assoon as she is set down, she sends
away all her People and her Coach, and appoints them what
hour to come and fetch her home, which is usually between
ten and eleven a Clock, for their Visits are long enough to tire
the greatest Patience.</P>
<P>There never comes any Men where they are met, a jealous
Husband would have little to do to seek his Wife among them,
he would be laught at, and they would not vouchsafe to give
him any other Satisfaction, than telling 'him, <HI>That she is where he
is not.</HI> The good Women are cunning enough, and they make
use of this liberty; for you must know that every House has its
back doors, by which they can steal out, and never be seen. Be∣sides
this, every one has a Brother at her Sisters, a Son at her
Mothers, or a Nephew at her Aunts, and this is another pretence
they make use of to see their Lover. Love in this Country is
very ingenious, nothing is neglected to gratifie their Passion,
and the Mistress meets with Fidelity; there are Intrigues that
last one's Life, and yet there has not been an hours time lost to
<PB N="234" REF="243"/>
accomplish them, all Opportunities are improved, and there
needs no more after seeing and liking one another.</P>
<P>I was some days ago at the Marchioness <HI>De Alcannizas,</HI> she's
one of the greatest and most vertuous Ladies of the Court, dis∣coursing
of these things, she very freely said to us, I must needs
confess, that if a <HI>Cavallero</HI> should be conveniently alone with me
half an hour, and did not ask me all that a Man could ask, I should
resent it so briskly that I could stab him if I could. And would you
grant him all the Favours he might ask you, interrupted the Mar∣chioness
<HI>De Liche,</HI> who is young and handsome? That does not
follow, replied my Lady <HI>De Alcannizas,</HI> on the contrary, I have
reason to believe, that I should grant him nothing at all, but
then I could not reproach him with any thing, whereas if he
made no attempt upon me, I should conclude he despised me.
There are few, I believe, but what are of the same Opinion
in this matter.</P>
<P>There's one thing I find very odd, and not to look well, me∣thinks
in a Catholick Kingdom, and that is the tollerating of
Men, that keep Mistresses so openly, without the least disguise,
it is very true that they are forbid by the Laws, but they value not
the Laws, and only obey their own Inclinations, and yet no body
offers to call them to account, or to reprove them in the least.
These Mistresses are called <HI>Amancebades,</HI> though a Man is mar∣ried,
yet he must have one of these Creatures, and often the <HI>na∣tural</HI>
Children are brought up with the <HI>legitimate</HI> in the sight of
the poor Wife, who patiently bears all this without so much as
speaking a word. It is very seldom one hears of any Differences
between Husband and Wife, and yet seldomer, that they separate
as in <HI>France.</HI> Of an infinite number of Persons that I know here, I
have only seen the Princess <HI>Duella Rocea,</HI> that does not live with
her Husband, but in a <HI>Convent,</HI> the Courts of Justice are not
much troubled with Domestick Quarrels.</P>
<P>It seems extraordinary to me that a Lady who loves, and is be∣loved
by a <HI>Cavallero,</HI> is not jealous of his <HI>Amancebade,</HI> she looks
upon her as a second Wife, and believes she cannot stand in com∣petition
with her, so that a Man has his <HI>Wife,</HI> his <HI>Amancebade,</HI> and
his Mistress, this last is generally a Person of Quality, 'tis she that
is visited in the Night, and for whom they venture their Lives.</P>
<P>It happens sometimes that a Lady cover'd with her great plain
Mantle or Vail, and not shewing any more of her Face than half
an Eye, and being ordinarily dres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, because she would not be
known, and having no mind to take a Chair, walks a foot to the
place of Rendezvous, either her being little used to walk, or ve∣ry
often, her manner and way distinguishes her, a <HI>Cavallero</HI> fol∣lows,
and begins to talk to her, uneasie to have such a Compani∣on
<PB N="235" REF="244"/>
on which it is hard to get rid of, she addresses her self to the first
she meets, and without farther discovery of her self, I conjure
you, says she to him, to hinder this importunate Man to follow me
any longer, his curiosity may injure my affairs, this Request a∣mounts
to a command with a brave <HI>Spaniard,</HI> he asks him against
whom the Lady complains, why he will press upon her against
her mind, and if he meets with an obstinate Person, the Sword
must be drawn, and sometimes they kill each other, without
knowing for whom they have so exposed themselves. In the mean
while, the Lady makes the best of her way, leaves them fighting
together, and goes where she's expected, but the jest is, that
very often this proves either to be the Husband or the Brother
that asserts her Cause, and by defending her from the Pursuit
of the inquisitive, gives her an Opportunity to enjoy the embra∣ces
of her Gallant.</P>
<P>Some time ago, a young Lady who dearly loved her Husband,
being informed that he did not live so regularly as he should, dis∣guised
her self, put on her Vail, and standing in a Street he used
often to pass through, she spyed him and gave him an Opportu∣nity
to speak to her. After he had accosted her, she began to
<HI>thou</HI> him, and 'tis commonly in this familiar way that the Wo∣men
in this Country make known their Inclinations. He made a
Proposal to her, which she accepted, but upon condition that he
should not be desirous either to see her or know who she was:
he promised he would not, and so led her to a Friend of his, at
their parting he assured her, that he thought himself the happiest
of Men, and that Fortune had never been so kind to him before,
and then gave her a very fine Ring, and begged her to keep it for
his sake. I'll keep and love it dearly, and will meet <HI>thee</HI> here
again when thou wilt, says she to him, for I had as good have thy
Jewels as another. When she had ended these words, she open∣ed
her Vail, and the Husband seeing 'twas his Wife, was in the
greatest confusion imaginable at his Adventure; but he consi∣dered,
that since she had so well contrived the matter as to get
out of her House to watch him, she might also find a way to
play him some other trick less pleasant; and therefore to be
secure of her, he appointed two <HI>Duennas</HI> constantly to look af∣ter
her, and they never after left her.</P>
<P>It happens also sometimes, that when a Man's House is not
near the Place, where by chance he meets his Mistress, he goes
without Ceremony into the next he comes at, whether he is ac∣quainted
there or no, he civilly intreats the Master to let him have
a Room to himself, because he has now an Opportunity to dis∣course
with a Lady, which if he loses, he shall not have the like
in a long time; this is enough to make the Master grant an Ac∣commodation
<PB N="236" REF="245"/>
to the Gallant and his Mistress, and sometimes, I
assure you, 'tis the very Wife of the Fool that goes away so kind∣ly;
in a word, they will venture strangely for an Opportunity
of seeing each other, though but for a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>I remember a <HI>French</HI> Lady, discoursing of a certain Man to one
of her Friends, said, <HI>Shew me an amorous Man, and I'll shew you
one ruined.</HI> This Maxim is verified here, more than in any place
in the World; a Lover or a Gallant has nothing that he can call
his own. It is no matter whether she either sees, or has a real
occasion for a thing, 'tis sufficient if she does but barely desire it,
they are never denyed any thing, and the manner of giving it, en∣haunses
their Liberality. I find them nothing near so amicable
as our <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> but 'tis said they know how to love at a greater
rate. Besides their Behaviour is a thousand times more respect∣ful,
nay this extends so far, that when a Man, let him be of what
Quality he will, presents any thing or gives a Letter to a Lady,
he kneels upon one knee, and he does the same, when he re∣ceives
any thing from her hand.</P>
<P>I said I would tell you, why so many Ladies went to the Dut∣chess
of <HI>De Ʋzeda's,</HI> she is very amiable, and Daughter to the Duke
<HI>De Ossuna,</HI> her Husband has had a Quarrel with the Prince <HI>De
Stillano,</HI> about a Lady which they both love; they drew their
Swords, and 'tis like to be an ill business. The King has caused
them to be arrested, that is, they are not made Prisoners, but
he has confined them to their Houses; unless they privately go
abroad in the Night to pursue their usual amorous Pleasures.
And that which is strange, the poor Wife must not fet her foot
out of door as long as her Husband is under these Confinements,
though it is almost constantly for some piece of Infidelity he is
guilty of towards her. And it is the same also, if they be banisht,
or sent to remain upon some of their own Estates in the Country,
which frequently happens. In all the time of their Absence, their
Wives keep house without so much as once going abroad. I have
been told, that the Dutchess De <HI>Ossuna,</HI> was a Prisoner after this
manner for above two Years, this is the Custom, but it makes
ones Life very dull and tedious.</P>
<P>But 'tis not only the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ladies, who are so tired and un∣easie
here, the <HI>French</HI> find but little diversion: We are in a few
days to go to <HI>Arranjues</HI> and <HI>Toledo</HI> to kiss the Queen Mothers
hand; I'll write you, dear Cosen, the particulars of that small
Journey, and I wish with all my Soul I were in a condition to
give you more essential marks of my Affection.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>BY my last Letter, I told you, Dear Cousin, that we were
to kiss the Queen Mother's Hand; I have had this Honour,
but before I conduct you thither, give me leave to tell you of
something else. I would not go from <HI>Madrid</HI> till I had seen
the Entry of the Marquiss <HI>De Villars,</HI> he made it on Horse∣back
which is the Custom here, and if a Man be handsome, it is
very advantagious for him: When the <HI>Venetian</HI> Embassador
made his, it was happy for him that he was not in his Coach;
he had one that was worth twelve thousand Crowns, which in
going from his House was overturn'd, and as it was in Winter,
the <HI>Marée</HI> (which is that nasty black dirt that stands in great
puddles in the Streets, and through which a Horse goes up to his
Girts) so spoil'd the Velvet with a Gold ground, and the rich
Embroidery it was set off with, that it could never serve again.
I thought it strange that for such usual Sights as these <HI>Entries</HI>
are, the Ladies should all be in their Balconies, in their rich
Apparel, and with the same earnestness as if it was to see the
greatest King upon earth; but they have so little liberty, that
they are glad to embrace all occasions to shew themselves, and
as their Lovers and Gallants hardly ever speak to them, so they
take care to place their Coaches as near their Mistresses Balco∣ny
as they can, that so they may the more easily discourse with
them by their Eyes and their Fingers; this is a Practice that
is very useful to them for the understanding one anothers
Minds, and they do it more readily than with their Voice, this
silent Language seems to me very difficult unless one were long
us'd to it; but they are early acquainted with it, about two
days since, I saw a Girl of about six years old, and a Boy of the
same Age, which understood by this way to tell one another a
thousand pretty things. <HI>Don Frederick de Cardona,</HI> who ob∣serv'd
them as well as I, but understood them far better, ex∣plained
to me every thing they said; and if he did not add
to the Discourse of these two Children, one must need confess,
that in this Country, they are born for <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Courtship.</HI></P>
<P>The Marchioness <HI>De Palacio,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Don Fernand de
Tolleda,</HI> is one of my Kinswoman's best Friends; she has a sine
House call'd <HI>Igarica,</HI> upon the Banks of <HI>Xanama,</HI> and though
<PB N="238" REF="247"/>
this Lady is now very old, yet she never was there, notwith∣standing
it is but eight leagues from <HI>Madrid.</HI> It is not lookt
upon in this Country to be according to Grandeur to go visit
their Lands, except they lie in some Principality or some City,
and then they call them by the Name of their <HI>State.</HI> I chid this
Lady for her Carelesness, and my Kinswoman engag'd her to
make one in the Company of her Daughter <HI>Donna Mariguita,</HI>
who is a little Woman, pale, fat and fair; these three Qualities
are equally rare here, and she's admir'd by every body that sees
her; the young Marchioness <HI>De la Rosa,</HI> would also be of our
Company, her Husband, with <HI>Don Fernand de Tolleda, Don San∣che,
Sarmiento,</HI> and <HI>Esteve de Garjaval,</HI> went on Horseback;
<HI>Don Frederick de Cardonna,</HI> would have not fail'd of being there
too, had not the Archbishop of <HI>Burgos</HI> writ him to come to him
in all haste: When he told it me, I desir'd him to go see the
fair Marchioness <HI>De los Rios alas Huelgas.</HI> I gave him a Letter
for her, in which I taxt her with her silence, and I desir'd to
know particularly how all things went. We set forward in two
Coaches the sixth of <HI>August,</HI> at ten a Clock at Night, in the fi∣nest
Weather that could be; the Heats were so excessive, that
unless one would venture their Lives, it was impossible to tra∣vel
in the day-time; but the Nights are cool, and the Coaches
are in the Summer all open; the sides of the Coach were turn∣ed
up quite round, with fine large Holland Curtains, trim'd
with fine <HI>English</HI> Bone-lace, and ty'd with Knots of colour'd
Ribbon, and as they often change them, they look very neat.
We went so swift, that I was almost dead with fear least some∣thing
about our Coach should break; for it is certain, that we
might have been all kill'd a hundred times over, before the
Coachman would have known any thing of the matter, I fancy
they run so, to make amends for their slow going in <HI>Madrid;</HI>
for even the Foot-pace of the Mules is too quick there, because
of the ill pavement, the holes, the dirt in Winter, and the dust
in Summer, with which the Streets are extreamly troubled. The
Marchioness <HI>De Palacios</HI> wore a little Hat, trim'd with Feathers,
according to the mode of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ladies when they go into
the Country; and the Marchioness <HI>De la Rosa</HI> lookt very pretty
in her short close-coat, strait sleeves, and her other Ornaments,
upon-sight of which, we cried out, that we thought her <HI>Muy
Bizzara,</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y de Gela,</HI> that is, very gallant and very splen∣did.</P>
<P>It was very odd methinks that these Ladies should oblige us
in three several Places upon the Road to alight out of our
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oach, and hear the Marchioness <HI>de la Rosa's</HI> two Gentlemen
<PB N="239" REF="248"/>
play upon the Guittar, whom it seems they brought on pur∣pose,
and it was pretty comical to see these Blades gallop with
their Guittars hanging behind their Backs. This ordinary con∣sort
of Musick was nevertheless ravishing to them, and they
were extreamly charm'd, with the pleasantness of the Country
in so fine a Night. Indeed, I never saw Women so infinitely sa∣tisfy'd.
We arrived at <HI>Arranjues</HI> about five a Clock in the
Morning, and I was amaz'd at its wonderful Situation; half a
League on this side the <HI>Tagus</HI> we passed over a wooden Bridge,
which is made to shut up; and after that we came into some
Walks of Elm and Lyme Trees, which were so high, green and
shady, that the heat of the Sun is never felt. It is an extraor∣dinary
thing to find so near <HI>Madrid,</HI> Trees so perfect in their
kind, for the Soyl is very barren, and they will not grow there;
but yet near <HI>Aranjues,</HI> one cannot perceive this defect I speak
of, for all along the Walks, and near the Trees, there are lit∣tle
Pits and Trenches made, into which the Water of <HI>Tagus</HI>
runs and moistens the roots of the Trees. These Avenues are
so long, that when one is in the middle, one cannot see to the
end of 'em. Several Alleys come into these, and every way
make the perfect figure of a Star. People walk on the Banks
of the <HI>Tagus</HI> and <HI>Xamara,</HI> which are two famous Rivers that
environ the Island in which <HI>Arranjues</HI> stands, and which sup∣plies
it with Water, and extreamly contributes to its beautiful∣ness.
To speak truly, I never saw a more delightful place. I
must confess the Gardens are too close, and several of their Al∣leys
too narrow, but yet it ravishes one to walk there; and at
our coming into them, I fancy'd my self in some enchanted
Palace. The Morning was cool, every where the Birds made
a sweet Melody, and the Waters a pleasant murmuring noise,
the Trees and Hedges were loaden with excellent Fruit, and
the <HI>Parterres</HI> were cover'd with most odoriferent Flowers, and
I enjoy'd all this in most pleasant Company. We had an Order
from <HI>Don John</HI> to be lodg'd in the Castle, so that the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cade</HI>
receiv'd us with great Civility, and was very careful to shew us
every thing that was the most remarkable. The Fountains are
in that number, and there are so very many of them, that it is
impossible to pass through an Alley, to go into an Arbor, or
upon a <HI>Paterre</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errass without taking notice of five or six
with brasen Statues, and marble Basin: The Spouts throw up
their Water to a vast height, they are not fed from Springs, but
from the <HI>Tagus.</HI> Amongst others, I'll give you an account of
the Fountain of <HI>Diana;</HI> It stands upon an ascent, from whence
it is seen at a great distance; the Goddess is in the midst, en∣viron'd
<PB N="240" REF="249"/>
with Bucks, Does, and Dogs, and every one of them
spouts out Water. A little lower is a circle of Myrrh, cut in
several fashions, and little <HI>Cupids</HI> peeping out half way, and
through the Water against those Animals which stand about the
Fountain. The Mountains of <HI>Parnassus</HI> raises up its head in the
midst of a great Pond, with <HI>Apollo,</HI> the <HI>Muses, Pagassius</HI>'s
Horse, and a fall of Water which represents the River of <HI>Heli∣con.</HI>
Out of a Rock there issues out a thousand several Spouts
of Water, some lanching out, others winding in and out like a
Serpent upon the Surface of the Pond; some gliding gently,
and others, either falling like Flowers in the Air, or else like
Rain. The Fountain of <HI>Ganymedes</HI> is also very pretty, this beau∣tiful
Child sitting upon <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Eagle, seems frighted with its
flight; the Bird sits on the top of a Pillar with its Wings
spread; he throws out the Water by his Beak and his Tallons;
the Fountain of <HI>Mars</HI> is near this: That of the <HI>Harpyes</HI> is fine,
they are placed upon very high Marble Pillars; at the four cor∣ners
they throw out Water every way, they seem to have a
mind to drown a little Youth who sits in the middle of the
Fountain, picking a Thorn out of his Foot. But the most plea∣sant
of all is, the Fountain of <HI>Love;</HI> this little God seems to rise
with his Body all full of Darts, from every one of which comes
out a Spout of Water. The three <HI>Graces</HI> sit at the Feet of the
<HI>God of Love;</HI> but that which is most extraordinary, is the Water
which falls from four high Trees like Fountains, whose noise is
very delightful and surprizing, it not being natural for Water
to come out of Trees.</P>
<P>I should be afraid to tire you, did I undertake to tell you the
vast number of Cataracts, Falls, and Fountains of Water which
I have seen here, I will only in general assure you, that it is a
Place worthy of the curiosity and attention of every body. At
eight a Clock the Sun began to be too hot, and some went in
to the House, which comes far short of that Beauty it should
have, justly to answer all the other things; and when the King
goes there, those that attend him are so ill accommodated with
Lodging, that either he must be contented to go there in all
haste, and keep his Court a little, or else go as far as <HI>Tolledo;</HI>
for there are only two bad Inns, and a very few private Houses.
If we had not taken care before hand for Provisions, even to
Bread, I am confident we had met with none, unless the <HI>Alcade</HI>
would have given us some of his. And by the way I'll inform
you the difference there's between the <HI>Alcade</HI> and <HI>Alcalde,</HI> that
so you may not confound them; the first signifies the Gover∣nor
of a Castle or Place, and the other a Serjeant. Although
<PB N="241" REF="250"/>
the most curious Pictures are at the <HI>Escurial,</HI> yet I found some
excellent ones in the King's Apartment at <HI>Arranjues;</HI> it is fur∣nisht
according to the Season we are now in, that is to say, the
Walls are all white, have only a Matt that is very fine and thin
about three foot deep with some Looking-glasses and Pictures.
In this Building there are divers little Courts, which takes from
the grace of it. We eat our Breakfast all together, and they
perswade me to eat some of a Fruit they call <HI>Pimento,</HI> which
is as long as one's finger, but as hot as Pepper, the least bit of
which puts one Mouth in a Flame, they let it lie steeping in
Vinegar and Salt, to get out the Virtue: This Fruit is brought
into <HI>Spain</HI> growing upon a Plant; and I never saw any of it in
other Conntries where I have been. We had an <HI>Olio,</HI> some
Ragous made of cold Partridges with Oyl, Canary Wine, fat
Pullet, and Pigeons which are excellent here, and also several
sorts of Fruit, which was extraordinary fair. When this Repast,
which was worth a Dinner, was ended, we went to Bed, and
went not a walking till about seven a Clock in the Evening.
The Charms of this Place were as new to me as if I had not seen
them in the Morning, but particularly, I still admir'd the Si∣tuation,
which indeed ravishes, on what side soever one turns
the Eyes. The King is there, with half a dozen of his Guards,
in great safety, because there's no getting at him but over
Bridges, which are all drawn up, and the <HI>Xamara,</HI> which in
this Place, swells the Waters of <HI>Tagas,</HI> fortifies <HI>Aranjues.</HI> After
we had walkt till ten a Clock at Night, we came back into a
great Hall, paved with Marble, and supported with Pillars of
the same. It was all enlightned with d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers brancht Candle∣sticks,
and <HI>Don Esleve de Carvajal</HI> had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vately got thither se∣veral
Musicians, which was a pleasant sort of a surprize to us,
at least the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ladies and my Kinswoman were mightily
delighted with them. For my part, I thought they sung too
much in the Throat, and Divisions and Shakes were so long,
that they were tedious; not but that their Voices are good,
but their manner of singing is not good, and generally the
greatest part in <HI>Spain,</HI> do not sing as they do in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI>
When Supper was done, we went to the great Canal, where
there's a small <HI>Gallion</HI> painted and gilt, we went aboard her,
and tarry'd till two a Clock in the Morning, and then we set
forward on our way to <HI>Tolleda.</HI></P>
<P>I took notice when we came out of <HI>Aranjues,</HI> that the ground
was all Heath and Ling, and yet the Air was perfum'd with
wild and mother Tyme, with which these Plains were all co∣ver'd.
They told me there were a great many Rabits, Stags,
<PB N="242" REF="251"/>
Does, and Fallow Deer, but it was not then their time to ap∣pear.
Our Conversation was for some time general, and for
two Leagues together from <HI>Arranjues,</HI> I did not speak one
word to <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> tho' he sat just close by me; But being
willing to imploy the time, in thoroughly informing my self
about all the Particulars of the cruel <HI>Inquisition,</HI> which he had
promis'd to acquaint me with, I desir'd him to let me know
something of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Inquisition,</HI> says he, has not been known in <HI>Europe,</HI> but
since the beginning of the Thirteenth Century. Before that
time, the Bishops and <HI>Civil</HI> Magistrates, enquired after <HI>Here∣ticks,</HI>
and either condemn'd them to Banishment, or to the
Forfeiture of their Goods and Estates, or else, to some other
Penalties, which never almost extended to <HI>Death:</HI> But the
vast number of <HI>Heresies</HI> which appear'd towards the end of the
Twelfth Age, caus'd that Tribunal to be Establish'd: The <HI>Pope</HI>
sent several <HI>Religious</HI> Persons to the <HI>Catholick</HI> Princes and Bi∣shops,
to exhort them, to take an extraordinary Care, in the
Extirpation of <HI>Heresies,</HI> and to bring obstinate <HI>Hereticks</HI> to
punishment: and thus things continued till the Year 1250.</P>
<P>In the Year 1251. <HI>Innocent</HI> IV. Authoriz'd the <HI>Dominican</HI>
Fryars, with the assistance of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> to take Cognizance
of these sort of Crimes. <HI>Clement</HI> the IV. confirm'd these Tribu∣nals
in the Year 1265. Afterward, there were several Courts
erected in <HI>Italy,</HI> and in the Kingdoms which were dependants
of the Crown of <HI>Arragon,</HI> till such time, that the <HI>Inquisition</HI>
was establish'd in the Kingdoms of <HI>Castille,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI>
and <HI>Isabel,</HI> and after that in <HI>Portugal,</HI> by King <HI>John</HI> the
III. in the Year 1557.</P>
<P>To that time the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> had a limited Power, and it was
often contested by the <HI>Bishops,</HI> to whom the Cognizance of
<HI>Heretical</HI> Crimes belong'd. According to the <HI>Canons,</HI> it was
contrary to the Rules of the <HI>Church,</HI> for <HI>Priests</HI> to sentence any
Criminals to <HI>Death,</HI> much more for those Crimes, which the
<HI>Civil</HI> Laws often punish'd with far less severe Penalties: But
ancient Right yielding to new Power, the <HI>Dominican</HI> Fryars by
the <HI>Popes</HI> Bulls have been for these two Ages, in Possession of
this extraordinary Jurisdiction; from which the Bishops have
been excluded, the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> now only wanted the Authority
of the <HI>Prince,</HI> to enable them to execute their Sentences. Be∣fore
<HI>Isabella</HI> of <HI>Castille</HI> came to the Crown, the <HI>Dominican, John
de Torquemada,</HI> her Confessor, and afterward <HI>Cardinal,</HI> made
her promise him to <HI>persecute</HI> all <HI>Infidels,</HI> and <HI>Hereticks,</HI> as soon
as it should be in her Power to do so. She prevail'd over <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="252"/>
her Husband to obtain, in the Year 1483. <HI>Bulls</HI> from
Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the IV. to constitute an <HI>Inquisitor</HI> General, over
the Kingdoms of <HI>Arragon</HI> and <HI>Valentia,</HI> for these two Kingdoms
were his <HI>Fee</HI> held in <HI>Capite:</HI> and it is to be noted, that <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI>
disposed of the Places in his Estates, and <HI>Isabel</HI> of those
that were in hers: but the <HI>Queen</HI> got this Place for <HI>Torquemada.</HI>
Afterwards the <HI>Pope</HI> extended his Jurisdiction over all the States
and Countries of the <HI>Catholick</HI> Kings, and then <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and
<HI>Isabel</HI> establisht a Supream Council of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> of which
they made him <HI>President:</HI> It is compos'd of an <HI>Inquisitor-Gene∣ral,</HI>
(who is nominated by the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and confirm'd
by the <HI>Pope</HI>) of five Counsellors, whereof one is to be a <HI>Do∣minican,</HI>
by a Privilege granted to this Order, in the Year
1616. by <HI>Philip</HI> the III. Of a <HI>Procurator,</HI> two <HI>Secretaries</HI> of
the <HI>King</HI>'s Chamber, two Secretaries of the <HI>Council,</HI> an <HI>Algua∣zil
Mayor,</HI> a Receiver, two Reporters, and two Qualificators,
and Consulters. The Number of the <HI>Familiars</HI> and small Offi∣cers
is very great, because all that belong to the <HI>Inquisition</HI> be∣ing
not subject to or tryable by any other Jurisdiction, shelter
themselves from the ordinary Courts of Justice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Supream</HI> Council hath a full and sole Authority over the
other <HI>Inquisitions,</HI> which cannot perform any <HI>Auto</HI> or Executi∣on,
without leave from the Great and General <HI>Inquisitor:</HI> The
particular <HI>Inquisitors</HI> are those of <HI>Sevile, Tolleda, Grenada,
Cordua, Cuenca, Vailladolid, Marcia, Derena, Logronno, St. James,
Saragossa, Valentia, Barcelona, Majorque, Sardaigna, Palermo,
Canaries, Mexico, Cartagena,</HI> and <HI>Lima.</HI></P>
<P>Every one of these <HI>Inquisitions</HI> is compos'd of three <HI>Inquisitors,</HI>
three <HI>Secretaries,</HI> one <HI>Alguazil Mayor,</HI> and of three Receivers
Qualificators and Consulters.</P>
<P>All Persons that take any of these Employments upon them
are oblig'd to make out their Proofs <HI>De causa Limpia,</HI> that is,
that their Family is not stain'd with any thing of <HI>Judaism,</HI> or
<HI>Heresie,</HI> and that they are <HI>Catholicks</HI> from the beginning.</P>
<P>The Proceedings of this Tribunal are very unusual. A man
is Arrested and lies in Prison, without knowing the Crime he
is accus'd of, or the Witnesses which depose against him: He
cannot come out thence, unless he will own the Fault, of which
often he is not guilty, and which the desire of Liberty forces
him to confess, for they do not put one to death for the first
time; but then the Family is markt for Infamy, and this first
Judgment makes the Persons uncapable of any Employment.</P>
<P>There's no confronting of Witnesses, nor any means for a
Man to defend himself, because this Tribunal above all things
<PB N="244" REF="253"/>
affect an inviolable Secrefie. It proceeds against all <HI>Hereticks,</HI>
but chiefly against <HI>Judaizing Christians,</HI> and secret <HI>Mahomitans,</HI>
of whom the Expulsion of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and
<HI>Isabel,</HI> has fill'd all <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The severity of this Court was so excessive, that the <HI>Inqui∣sitor
Torquemada</HI> try'd above a hundred thousand Persons, of
which six thousand were condemned to be burnt in the compass
of Fourteen Years.</P>
<P>It is pretended that the sight of so many Criminals con∣demn'd
to so terrible a Death, without any regard either to
their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Quality, confirms and keeps the People in the <HI>Ro∣mish</HI>
Religion, and that 'tis the <HI>Inquisitor</HI> alone, that has hin∣dred
the wickedest <HI>Heresies</HI> from spreading<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves in
<HI>Spain,</HI> even in that time when all <HI>Europe</HI> besides was infected
with them. For this reason, the <HI>Kings</HI> have given such Arbi∣trary
Authority to this Tribunal, which is called the <HI>Tribunal</HI>
of the <HI>Holy Office.</HI></P>
<P>The general Acts of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> which by the greatest
part of <HI>Europe,</HI> are lookt upon, only as a bare Execution of
Criminals, amongst the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are esteem'd a <HI>Religious</HI> Ce∣remony,
by which his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty gives publick Proofs of
his <HI>Zeal</HI> for Religion. And therefore, are called by 'em <HI>Autos
de Fe, Acts of Faith;</HI> commonly they are performed either
at the Accession of the <HI>Kings</HI> to the Crown, or at their coming
to Age, that so they may be the more Authentick: The last
was in the Year 1632. and there is one now making ready for
the <HI>Kings</HI> Marriage. As there has not been one of a long time,
so there are great preparations making to render this as Solemn
and as Magnificent as 'tis possible for those sorts of Ceremonies
to be. One of the Counsellors of the Inquisition has already
drawn a Project of it, which he has shewed me: Here's the
Contents of it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>great Place</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> there shall be a Theater erected
fifty Foot long; It shall be rais'd as high as the Balcony, de∣sign'd
for the <HI>King,</HI> and no higher.</P>
<P>On the right side of the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony, quite cross the
Theater, there shall be rais'd an Amphitheater, of twenty five
or thirty steps, designed for the Council of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> and
the other Councils of <HI>Spain,</HI> on the uppermost of which shall
be placed the <HI>Chairs</HI> under a Canopy, for the <HI>General Inquisitor</HI>
a great deal higher than the King's Balcony. On the left of
the Theater and the King's Balcony, there shall be another
Amphitheater as big as the first, upon which the Criminals
shall be placed.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="254"/>
In the middle of the great Theater, there shall be rais'd a∣nother
very little one, on which shall be made two Cages,
where the Criminals shall be kept while their Sentence is
reading.</P>
<P>There shall be likewise placed upon the great Theater, three
Chairs for the Readers of the Judgment, and for the Preacher,
before whom there shall be an Altar erected.</P>
<P>The Places for their <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesties shall be so ordered,
that the <HI>Queen</HI> shall be on the left hand of the King, and on
the right of the <HI>Queen-Mother.</HI> All the Queen's Ladies of Ho∣nour,
shall take up the rest of the length every way of the
same Balcony; there shall be other Balconies prepared for the
Ambassadors, Lords and Ladies of the Court, and Scaffolds
for the People.</P>
<P>The Ceremony shall begin by a Procession from St. <HI>Maries</HI>
Church. A hundred Charcoal-men arm'd with Pikes and
Muskets, shall march before, because they provide the Wood,
which is to burn those that are condemned to the Fire. Next
them shall follow the <HI>Dominicans</HI> with a white Cross carry'd be∣fore
them; the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> shall carry the Standard
of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> according to a Privilege that's Hereditary to
his Family: This Standard is of red Damask, on one side of it,
is represented a naked Sword, in a Crown of Lawrel, and on
the other the Arms of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>After that, shall be carry'd a green Cross, wrapt about with
black Crape: and after it shall march several <HI>Grandees</HI> and o∣ther
Persons of Quality of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> covered with Cloaks,
that have black and white Crosses upon them, embroidered
with Gold Thread. The march shall be brought up by fifty
Halberdiers or Guards to the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> cloathed in black and
white, and commaded by the Marquis <HI>De Pouar,</HI> Hereditary
Protector of the <HI>Inquisition</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Tolleda.</HI></P>
<P>After the Procession has in this order past by the <HI>Pallais,</HI> it
shall come to the <HI>great Place;</HI> the Standart and the green Cross
shall be fixt upon the Altar, and the <HI>Dominicans</HI> only, shall
remain upon the Theater, and spend part of the Night in Sing∣ing
Psalms, and as soon as day breaks, they shall celebrate seve∣ral
<HI>Masses</HI> upon the Altar.</P>
<P>The <HI>King,</HI> the <HI>Queen</HI> and the <HI>Queen-Mother,</HI> and all the La∣dies
must be in their Balconies about seven a Clock in the Mor∣ning;
at eight, the Procession shall begin to march, as it did
the day before, by the company of Charcoal-men, who shall
place themselves on the left hand of the King's Balcony, the
right shall be for his Guards. Afterwards several Men shall
<PB N="246" REF="255"/>
bear certain Past-board Effigies as big as Life; some of them
representing those that dy'd in Prison, whose Bones shall also
be carr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d in Coffers with Flames painted round them, and the
rest shall represent those who have escap'd and who have been
condemn'd for Contumacy: These Figures shall be placed at
one end of the Theater. After that, their Sentence shall be
read, and they shall be executed. But I should tell ye, added
he, That the Supream Council of the <HI>Inquisition</HI> is more abso∣lute
than all the others: It is believ'd that the King himself has
not Power to release those which shall be accus'd before it, be∣cause
this <HI>Tribunal</HI> acknowledges the <HI>Pope</HI> only to be above it,
and that there has been a time, when upon some occasions the
<HI>King</HI>'s Power, was found too weak to contend with that of the
<HI>Inquisition. Don Diego Sarmiento</HI> is <HI>Inquisitor General;</HI> he is a
mighty honest and good Man; and is about threescore Years
of Age: The <HI>King</HI> nominates the President of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI>
and his <HI>Holiness</HI> confirms him; But as for the <HI>Inquisitors,</HI> the
President proposes them to the King, and after he has approv'd
of them, he then puts them in their Places.</P>
<P>This Tribunal takes Cognizance of every thing concerning
the <HI>Faith,</HI> and it is absolutely invested both with the <HI>Pope</HI>'s
and the <HI>King</HI>'s Authority, there's no appealing from its Judg∣ment;
and the two and twenty Tribunals of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI>
which are in all the <HI>Estates</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and which depend upon
this at <HI>Madrid,</HI> every Month render an Account to it, of their
<HI>Finances,</HI> and Revenues, and every Year of their Causes and
Criminals: But those of the <HI>Indies</HI> and the other distant Places,
only give an Account at the end of every Year. As to the
Places of these inferior Tribunals, they are fill'd by the <HI>General
Inquisitors,</HI> with the Approbation of the Counsellors. It would
be pretty difficult to be able precisely to reckon up the num∣ber
of the Officers, which belong to the <HI>Inquisition;</HI> for in
<HI>Spain</HI> alone, there are about two and twenty thousand <HI>Familiars</HI>
of the <HI>Holy Office.</HI> They are call'd by this Name, because they
are as 'twere Spies, scattered up and down every where, which
are continually giving true or false Information to the Inquisi∣tion,
upon which those are seized and taken up, which they
accuse.</P>
<P>Whilst with the greatest Attention I was listening to <HI>Don
Fernand,</HI> the Marchioness <HI>De Palacios</HI> interrupted us, to let us
know that we were come near <HI>Tolleda,</HI> and that certain old
Ruines of an ancient Castle which we saw upon our left hand,
were those of an enchanted <HI>Palace.</HI> I seem'd to <HI>Don Fernand</HI>
to doubt of what she affirm'd, upon which he said, you may
<PB N="247" REF="256"/>
think what you please; but certain it is, that there's for it a
very ancient <HI>Tradition</HI> in this Country; and moreover, they
pretend that there is a <HI>Cave</HI> shut up, and a Prophesie which
threaten'd <HI>Spain</HI> with the greatest Miseries, whenever this Cave
was open'd: Every body terrify'd with this threat, had no
mind to draw upon themselves the said Effects, so that this
place did for several Ages remain very close. But <HI>Don Rodigue,</HI>
the <HI>King,</HI> less credulous, or more curious, caus'd it to be o∣pen'd,
upon which there were heard most terrible Noises; e∣very
body thought that the very Elements themselves were go∣ing
into confusion, there was so violent a Tempest: This did
not hinder him from going into it, where by light of several
Flamboys, he saw the Figures of divers Men, whose Cloaths
and Arms were very strange: There was one held a Copper
Blade in his hand, and upon it was writ in <HI>Arabick,</HI> that the
Time drew near, for the Dissolation of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that the
Persons, whose Statues were there, would ere long come. It
never was in any place, said I smiling, where they rely'd so
much on fabulous Tales, as they do in <HI>Spain: Says rather,</HI> replied
he, <HI>that there never was any Woman so incredulous as you; and
in telling you this Story, I did not think</HI> I <HI>should alter your Judg∣ment;
But as much as one can be assured of a thing by the Testi∣mony
of Men, this Story is credible.</HI></P>
<P>It was now light enough, very plainly to observe all the
Charms of the Country. We past the <HI>Tagus</HI> over a very great
and fine Bridge, of which I had heard, and a little after disco∣ver'd
<HI>Tolleda</HI> all surrounded with Hills and Rocks, which com∣mand
it; There are very neat Houses built amongst those
Hills, design'd for the pleasure of Solitude: The Arch-Bishop
of <HI>Tolleda</HI> has one there, whether he goes often: The City
stands upon the Rock, the unevenness of which in divers pla∣ces
contributes to make it high and low; the Streets are nar∣row,
ill pav'd and troublesome, which is the reason, that all
the People of Quality go there, either in Chairs or Litters: And
as we were in a Coach, we took up our Quarters in the <HI>Placa
Mayor,</HI> because that is only the part to which one can pass with
a Coach; as soon as we were arriv'd, we alight at the Hospital
of <HI>Foira,</HI> which stands in the Suburbs, whose Buildings consists
of three Sides, within which is a great square Court, and the
Church makes up the fourth side, and there we heard <HI>Mass:</HI>
This Hospital was built by an Arch-bishop of <HI>Tolleda,</HI> whose
Monument and Statue in Marble are in the midst of the body of
the Church: The Walls of the City were rebuilt by the <HI>Moors;</HI>
on the Sides stands a great many little Towers, which hereto
<PB N="248" REF="257"/>
heretofore serv'd to defend it; And it would be a strong Place,
being almost encompast with the <HI>Tagus,</HI> and having extream
deep Ditches, did not the adjacent Hills command it, from
whence it were easie to batter it down. It was not eight a
Clock when we got thither; and we would spend the rest of
the Morning in seeing the Church, which as 'tis said, is the
finest in <HI>Europe:</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it <HI>Holy,</HI> whether 'tis upon
the Account of the <HI>Relicks</HI> which are there, or for some other
reason which they did not tell me, I know not: If it was as
long and high as 'tis broad, it would be much better. It is
beautify'd with divers Chappels as big as Churches; they all
shine with Gold and Paintings; the chief of which are those
of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> St. <HI>James,</HI> St. <HI>Martin, Cardinal Sandoual</HI> and the
<HI>Connestable De Luna.</HI> In the Quire, I saw a <HI>Niche,</HI> or hollow
place, from whence 'tis pretended there issued out for several
days together, a Spring of Water with which the Soldiers and
Citizens quencht their thirst in the time they maintain'd the
Sieges against the <HI>Moors,</HI> when they were half dead with thirst.
For without digressing from my subject, I must tell you, that
in the City there is not so much as a Well or a Spring, and
that they fetch all their Water from the <HI>Tagus,</HI> which is so ve∣ry
troublesome, that one would wonder how <HI>Tolleda</HI> comes to
be so full of People as 'tis. Near the entrance into the Church,
there's a Marble Pillar, which they Reverence, because the Holy
<HI>Virgin</HI> appeared upon't to St. <HI>Alphonsus.</HI> It is enclosed with
an Iron Gate, and through a little Window they kiss it, and
upon it is writ, <HI>Adorabimus in loco ubi fleterunt pedes ejus.</HI> Be∣tween
every <HI>Canons</HI> Seat there is a Marble Pillar, and the
Sculpture of the Church is fine and curiously wrought. I was
amazed when I saw the <HI>Treasury.</HI> There must be thirty Men to
carry the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> upon <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> day. It is made of Sil∣ver
guilt, and there is exquisitely wrought upon't several Spires
of Steeples, with abundance of Angels and Cherubims: within
this, there's also another of Massy-gold, and such a vast quan∣tity
of precious Stones that their value is inestimable; the
<HI>Chalacies,</HI> the <HI>Patins</HI> and the <HI>Pyxes</HI> are no less beautiful, In∣deed
every thing shines there, with great Diamonds and Ori∣ental
Pearls; the Sun, where the Holy Sacrament is kept, the
Crowns and Robes of the <HI>Virgin</HI> are the most splendid things, that
I ever saw in my days. But indeed this Archbishoprick is so
very rich, that it is but just every thing should be answer∣able
to it. I have told you, dear <HI>Cousin,</HI> that the Archbishop of
<HI>Burgos</HI> informed me, that the Bishoprick of <HI>Tolleda</HI> had three
hundred and Fifty thousand Crowns a Year. I must now add
<PB N="249" REF="258"/>
that the Revenue of the Church it self, is a Hundred thousand
Crowns. Forty <HI>Canons,</HI> which have every one a thousand
Crowns; the Grand <HI>Arch-deacon,</HI> Forty thousand, three <HI>Arch∣deacons,</HI>
the first of which has fifteen thousand, the second
twelve thousand, and the third ten thousand, and the Dean ten
thousand Crowns a Year.</P>
<P>There is besides, an infinite number of Chaplains, Clarks of
the Chappel, and other Persons, to whom daily allowances are
given.</P>
<P>There is the Chaplain <HI>Mayor</HI> of the Chapel <HI>de los Rios,</HI> who
enjoys twelve thousand Crowns a year, and six others that are
under him, have a thousand Crowns <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>After we had spent a great deal of time in considering the
fine things with which this Court was filled, we resolved to re∣turn
to our Inn, where we had left our Coach; and just when
we were going away, there came to us an Almoner and a
Gentleman that belonged to Cardinal <HI>Porto Carrero,</HI> who sent
them to complement us, and to assure us that by no means we
must lodge any where else than at the <HI>Arch-bishops</HI> Palace. They
chiefly address'd themselves to the Marchioness <HI>de Palacios</HI> who
was near a kin to him, and who earnestly desired us to go thi∣ther.
We excused our selves upon our being in such Disorder,
not having slept that Night, and being in an undress: She or∣dered
her Son to go to the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> and to beg him to accept
our excuses. <HI>Don Fernand</HI> returned in a moment, attended
with abundance of Pages, some of which brought Umbrellos
of Gold and Silver Brocado. He told us that his <HI>Eminence</HI>
mightily desired we would go to his House, and that he had
shewed so much concern at our refusal, that indeed he had pro∣mised
to bring us; and thereupon he commanded them to bring
Umbrellos to defend us from the Sun, and that they had
watered the place which we were to cross from the Church to
the Palace. And immediately we spied two Mules drawing a
little Cart, in which there was a Tub full of Water; and we
were told that as oft as the <HI>Cardinal</HI> was to come to the Church,
it was the Custom to water the way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-bishops</HI> Palace is very ancient and large, most rich∣ly
furnished, and every way suitable to the Person that posses∣ses
it. We were conducted into a very fine Apartment, where
immediately they brought us Chocolate, and afterwards, all
sorts of Fruits, Wine, Water and other Liquors cooled with
Ice. We were so sleepy, that after we had eat a little, we
begged the Marchioness <HI>de Palacios</HI> to see the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> and
to excuse us to him, if we defer'd giving our selves that honour,
<PB N="250" REF="259"/>
for that we were not able any longer to live without sleep.
And indeed, the young Marchioness <HI>de la Rose,</HI> my Kinswo∣man
and my self, chose to go to Bed, and in the Evening, we
drest our selves to see the <HI>Queen-Mother.</HI> The Marchioness
<HI>de Palacios,</HI> who had always been extreamly devoted to her,
went to the <HI>Alcacar,</HI> which is the Name of the Castle, and
made her a visit whilst we slept; so that she told her, she
would give us Audience at eight a Clock in the Evening,
that was the first time I was drest according to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mode.</P>
<P>I do not think there's a more troublesome dress; ones Shoul∣ders
must be so squeez'd, that it hurts one; there's no lifting up
ones Arm, hardly can you get it into the Sleeve. I had on a Far∣dingal
of a dreadful bigness, (for one must wear that in the
Queen's Presence) I know not what to do with my self with
this strange invention; there's no sitting down in it, and I be∣lieve
if I should wear it all my Life, I should never be recon∣cil'd
to it. My Head was drest after the <HI>Melene</HI> fashion, that
is, the Hair all spread over the Neck, and ty'd at the end with
some Non-pareil Ribbon, this is a great deal hotter than a Pa∣tine;
so that being now in the Month of <HI>August,</HI> and in
<HI>Spain,</HI> you may easily guess how I pass away my time. But
this being a Ceremonial Dress of the Head, there was nothing to
be omitted upon such an occasion; besides, I wore their <HI>Patins</HI>
which are fitter to break ones Neck, than to walk with. When
we were all in a Condition to appear, for my Kinswoman and
my Daughter were both also drest after the <HI>Spanish fashion,</HI> we
were led into a Chamber of State, where the Cardinal came to
see us; his Name is <HI>Don Luis Porto Carrero,</HI> he may be about
two and forty years old, he's very civil, is of a sweet complai∣sant
Temper, and hath well learnt the polite Breeding of the
Court of <HI>Rome;</HI> He stay'd an hour with us, and afterwards
there was serv'd up to us a very plentiful Meal; but every
thing was so full of Amber, that I never tasted any Sauces so
rich, and less pleasant. I fancy'd my self at this Table, like
<HI>Tantalus,</HI> in the midst of Victuals, and yet starv'd with hunger,
because I could not eat; for either all the Meat was perfum'd,
or else full of Saffron, Garlick, Onion, Pepper and Spices: but
with searching about, I found some Jellies and white Meats,
which were admirable, and with which I sav'd my self harmless.
There were also brought to Table a Ham of Bacon, which came
from the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and which is better than either
those they boast so much of at <HI>Bayonn,</HI> or those of <HI>Ments:</HI> but
it was spread all over with certain little Comfits, which in
<HI>France</HI> we call Non-pareil, the Sugar of which melted in the
<PB N="251" REF="260"/>
Fat; it was drawn full of Limon-peel, which abated much of
its goodness. The Fruit was the best and the pleasantest thing
one can see, for whole Trees, with their Fruit were Iced over
with Sugar after the <HI>Italian</HI> way; you'll easily believe the Trees
were not very big. There were Orange Trees thus order'd,
with little artificial Birds fastned in them. There were like∣wise
Cherry Trees, Rasberry and Gooseberry Bushes, and others
set in little Cases of Silver.</P>
<P>We did not sit long at Table, because the hour for seeing the
Queen was near; we were carry'd thither in Chairs, though it
is a pretty distance, and very much up Hill; for the <HI>Alcacar</HI> is
built upon a Rock of a Prodigious height, and the Prospect is
admirable. Before the Gate there is a very wide Place, after∣wards
one comes into a Court an hundred and sixty foot long,
and an hundred and thirty broad, adorn'd with two rows of
Piazza's, ten rows of the Pillars which made the length, were
all of one entire Stone; and the breadth had eight rows of Pil∣lars,
and this made a fine show. But that which pleases much
better, is the Stair-case at the bottom of the Court, which is an
hundred and thirty foot wide, like the Court. After one has
gone up some steps it parts in two, and to speak the Truth, I
believe 'tis one of the fairest in <HI>Europe.</HI> We went through a
great Gallery, and vast Apartments, but met in them so few
People, that it did not look as if one could have met with the
Queen-Mother of <HI>Spain</HI> there; she was in a great Hall, whose
Windows were all open, and which had a Prospect to the Val∣leys,
and the River. The Hangings, Cushions, Carpets and Ca∣nopy
were all of gray Cloth; the Queen was standing and lean∣ing
upon a Balcony, having in her hand a great pair of Beads.
When she saw us, she turn'd towards us, and received us with
a Countenance merry enough. We had the Honour to kiss her
Hand, which is little, lean and white: She is very pale, her
Complexion pure, her Face a little long and flat, her Looks are
agreeable, and her Stature is of a middle size; she was drest as
all the Widows in <HI>Spain</HI> are, that is, like a <HI>Nun,</HI> without so
much as one Hair appearing; and there are many, (though
she's not of that number) that cause all their Hair to be cut off
when they lose their Husbands, for a greater expression of their
Grief. I observ'd that her Gown was tuck'd up quite round,
that so it might be let down as it wears out; yet I do not be∣lieve
she practices this, but such is the fashion of the Country.
She ask'd me how long I had been come from <HI>France,</HI> and I
gave her an account; she enquir'd if they discours'd then of
a Marriage between her Son and <HI>Mademoselle d' Orleance,</HI> and
<PB N="252" REF="261"/>
I told her no; then she said she would show me her Picture
which was drawn from that the King her Son had, and she bid
one of her Ladies, who was an old Duenna, and very ugly,
bring it. It was drawn in Water Colours, in the bigness of
ones hand, in a Box covered with black Sattin, and lined with
green Velvet. Do you find, says she, that it is like her? I as∣sured
her that there were not any of her Features; for indeed
it seemed to squint, the Face was awry, and nothing could less
resemble a Princess so perfect as <HI>Mademoiselle.</HI> She asked me
whether she was more or less handsome than this Picture. I
told her, that she was handsomer beyond comparison. <HI>The
King my Son then,</HI> reply'd she, <HI>will be pleasantly cheated, for he
believes this Picture is just like her, and no body can be better sa∣tisfied
than he is with her. For my part, her Eyes that look askew
were troublesome to me, but to comfort my self, I considered that
she had a great share of Wit, and divers other good Qualities. Do
not you remember,</HI> says she, to the Marchioness <HI>de Palacios, to have
seen my Picture in the late King's Chamber? Yes Madam,</HI> an∣swered
the Marchioness, <HI>and very well remember also, that as soon
as we saw your Majesty, we all wondred extreamly, why the Pain∣ter
would do you so much wrong, that's what I would have said to
you,</HI> reply'd she, <HI>for when I arriv'd here, and cast my Eyes upon
that Picture which they said was made for me, I in vain try'd to
believe it, but I could not do't.</HI> A little she Dwarf, but thick as
a Tun, and no taller than a good big Mushroom, cloth'd all in
Gold and Silver Brocade, with long Hair hanging down to her
Feet, came in, and kneeling before the Queen, asked her if she
would please to have Supper; upon which we offered to with∣draw,
but she told us, we might follow her, and she went into
a Parlour all of Marble, she sat down to Table all alone, and we
all stood round her. Her Maids of Honour, with the <HI>Camera
Mayor,</HI> who looked very sad, came to wait on her. I saw some
of them, which methinks were very handsome; they talkt to
the Marchioness <HI>de Palacios,</HI> and told her, that they were hor∣ribly
tyr'd with that sort of Life, and that they lived at <HI>Tolleda,</HI>
as if they were in a Desart. These were called <HI>Damas de Pa∣lacio,</HI>
and they wear <HI>Patins;</HI> but for the little <HI>Menines,</HI> they
wear Shooes quite flat; the <HI>Menines</HI> are Children of the highest
Quality, and neither wear Cloak nor Sword.</P>
<P>There were several Dishes brought before the Queen, the first
were Melons cooled with Ice, and some Sallets and Milk, of
which she eat plentifully before she touched any of the Flesh,
which looked ill enough. She does not want a Stomach, and
she drank a little Wine pure, saying that was to digest her Fruit:
<PB N="253" REF="262"/>
When she called for Drink, the first <HI>Menine</HI> brought her Cup
covered upon a Salvar, and kneeling gave it to the <HI>Camarera,</HI>
who also kneeled when the Queen took it from her hands; and
on the other side, a Lady of the Palace presented upon Knee a
Napkin to the Queen to wipe her Mouth with▪ She gave some
dryed Sweet-meats to <HI>Donna Marguerita de Palacios,</HI> and to my
Daughter, in saying to them, they must not eat much of such
things, because they spoiled the Teeth of young Girls. She
asked me divers times how the Most Christian Queen did, and
how she diverted her self? She said, that she had lately sent
her some Boxes of Amber Pastils, some Gloves, and some Cho∣colate:
She was above an hour and half at Table, speaking little,
but seemed merry enough. We desired to know her Commands
for <HI>Madrid,</HI> whereupon she expressed a great deal of Kindness
and Civility, and after that we took our leave of her. It cannot
be denyed, that this Queen has abundance of Understanding as
well as Courage and Vertue, to take as she does, so tedious a
Banishment.</P>
<P>I must not forget to tell you, that the first <HI>Menine</HI> brings the
Queens Patins and puts them on; this is so great an Honour in
this Country, that they would not change it for the best place
belonging to the Crown. When the Ladies of the Palace mar∣ry,
and with the Queens consent, she adds to their Portions
fifty thousand Crowns, and commonly some Government or
Vice-Royalty is given to their Husbands.</P>
<P>When we came back to the Cardinals House, we found a
Theater prepared in a mighty great Room, and abundance of
Ladies on one side, and Cavalleros on the other, and that
which seemed pretty odd to me, was a Damask Curtain which
was drawn all the length of the Room to the very Theater, and
so hindred the Men and the Women from seeing one another:
They only stayed for us, to begin the Comedy of <HI>Pyramus</HI> and
<HI>Thisbe;</HI> this was a new Play, but the worst that I have yet seen
in <HI>Spain.</HI> Afterward the Comedians danced very well, and
the Diversion lasted till after two a Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>There was given a stately Supper in a great Hall, where
there were divers Tables; and when the Cardinal had placed
us, he went back to the Cavalleros, who had the same things
on their side as we had: There was an excellent <HI>Italian</HI> Con∣sort
of Musick, for his Eminence had brought with him Musi∣cians
from <HI>Rome,</HI> to whom he gave large Pensions. It was six
a Clock in the Morning before we could retire to our Apart∣ments,
and as there were divers things for us yet to see, instead
of going to bed, we went to the <HI>Placa Mayor,</HI> which they call
<PB N="254" REF="263"/>
<HI>Secodebet;</HI> the Houses which environ it are of Brick, and all
uniform, with Balconies. It is of a round Figure, and has Pi∣azzas
about it, under which People walk, and this is a fine Place.
We went back to the Castle to view it better and more leisurely,
the Building is after the <HI>Gothick</HI> fashion, and very ancient, but
there's something in't that looks so great, that I do not won∣der
that <HI>Charles</HI> V. had rather have lived there, than in any o∣ther
City under his Obedience. It contains in a square, four
great Apartments with their several Wings and Pavilions;
there's room enough conveniently to lodge the whole Court of
a great King. We were shewed a Machine that was very strange
before it was broken; it was to draw up the Water from the
<HI>Tagus,</HI> and to make it rise to the top of the <HI>Alcacar,</HI> the House
where it stood is yet whole, though it be several Ages since it
was built. There's above five hundred steps from it to the
River side; when the Water was come into the Receiver, it
ran by certain Channels into all parts of the City where there
were Fountains. This was a mighty Conveniency, for now
they are forced to draw the Water thirty fathom deep.</P>
<P>We went and heard Mass in the Church <HI>de los Reyes:</HI> It is
fair and large, and all full of Oranges and Pomegranet Trees,
Jassamin and Mirtles that are very high, and they are set in Cases,
and are formed into walls up to the very high Altar, whose Or∣naments
are extraordinary rich, so that looking through all these
green Boughs, and the Flowers of different Colours, upon the
shining Gold, Silver, Embroidery, and great lighted Candles
which adorn the Altar, it seems as if the Rays of the Sun play'd
before your Eyes. There are also some Cages painted and gilt,
and filled with Nightingales, Canary Birds and others, which
make a charming noise. I should be very glad that in <HI>France</HI>
they would imitate them in adorning our Churches. The Walls
of this Church is all over covered on the outside with the Chains
and Irons of the Captives which have been redeemed out of <HI>Bar∣bary.</HI>
In this part of the Town I observed that most of the
Houses had upon their Doors a square piece of Earthen Ware,
upon which was set the Angelical Salutation in these words,
<HI>Maria sue concebida sin peca lo original.</HI> I was told that these
Houses belonged to the Arch-bishop, and that none but those
that work in Silk dwell in them, of which there are very many
at <HI>Tolleda.</HI> The two stone Bridges cross the River are very high,
broad and long. If they would but take a little pains with the
<HI>Tagus,</HI> Boats might come up to the City, this would be a con∣siderable
Conveniency; but they are naturally too lazy, to con∣sider
that the Profit and Advantage of a work is to be prefer'd
<PB N="255" REF="264"/>
before the trouble of undertaking it. We also saw the Hospital
of <HI>Los Linnos,</HI> that is of Foundlings, and the City-House which
is near the Cathedral; and at last our Curiosity being satisfied,
we came back to the Archiepiscopal Palace, and we went to
Bed and laid till Night, when again we had another Feast as
splendid as the former. His Eminence eat with us, and when
we had returned him all due thanks, we set forward towards the
Castle of <HI>Ignarica:</HI> The Marquess <HI>de Palacios,</HI> with all his Fa∣mily,
was there waiting for us; so that we were so obligingly
received, that nothing can be added to the good Chear and to
the Pleasure, with which we were entertained for six days, ei∣ther
in Fishing upon the River <HI>Xarama,</HI> or in Hunting, in Walk∣ing,
or in common Conversation: Every one was Emulous to
appear good humoured, and one may say, that when the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
go so far as to lay aside their Gravity, and know and love
you, they contribute hugely to ease and recreate the Mind. They
become sociable, obliging, earnest to please you, and the best
Company in the World. This is what I have found in this little
Journey I have made, of which I should not have given you so
particular an Account; but yet I am perswaded, Dear Cosen,
you desire it so, and that you set some value upon my Complai∣sance.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ceremony of Swearing to the Treaty of Peace con∣cluded
at <HI>Nimmiguen,</HI> between the Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and
<HI>Spain,</HI> was performed here the last of <HI>August.</HI> I had a great
desire to have seen what past then; but as Women are not to
be present there, so the <HI>Connestable De Castille</HI> promised to get
us into the <HI>King's</HI> Chamber, as soon as he should be gone into
the great Hall, Madam <HI>Gueux</HI> the <HI>Danish</HI> Ambassadors Lady,
and Madam <HI>De Chais,</HI> the Envoy of <HI>Hollands</HI> Lady, were there
also. We went up at a private Pair of Stairs, where one of the
<HI>Constable's</HI> Gentlemen waited to receive us, and we tarried for
some time in a very fine Closet full of <HI>Spanish</HI> Books well bound
and very diverting: There are amongst others, I found the Histo∣ry
of <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> the famous <HI>Knight of the Manca,</HI> in which
<PB N="256" REF="265"/>
the plainness and the subtilty of the Expression, the weigh
and strength of Proverbs, and that which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call
<HI>El pico,</HI> that is the smartness and nicety of a Language, appeared
quite otherwise, then the Translations which we have in <HI>French.</HI>
I was so pleased in reading it, that I hardly thought of see∣ing
the Ceremony. It began as soon as the Marquess <HI>De Villars</HI>
came, and through a Lattice-window which was opened, we
saw what past. The <HI>King</HI> placed himself at the end of the
great Guilt-Hall, which is one of the most stately in the Palace.
The <HI>Alcove</HI> was spread with a wonderful fine Carpet; the
Throne and the Canopy were embroidered with Pearls, Dia∣monds,
Rubies, Emeraulds and other precious Stones.
Cardinal <HI>Portocarrero</HI> sat in a great Chair below the <HI>Alcove,</HI> on
the right hand of the Throne; the Constable of <HI>Castille</HI> sat up∣on
a Stool; the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador was seated on the left
hand of the Throne upon a Bench covered with Velvet, and the
<HI>Grandees</HI> were placed near the Cardinal; when every body was
seated according to their Quality, the <HI>King</HI> came in, and
when he was in the Throne, the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> the <HI>Ambassador,</HI> and
the <HI>Grandees</HI> set down and covered themselves. A Secretary
read aloud, the Power which the most <HI>Christian</HI> King had
sent to his Ambassador. After that, a little Table was brought
and set before the <HI>King,</HI> with a Crucifix and a Book of the <HI>E∣vangelists,</HI>
and whilst he held his hand upon it the <HI>Cardinal</HI>
read the Oath, by which he swore to keep the Peace with
<HI>France:</HI> There are some other little Ceremonies, but I did not
mind them well enough to be able to give you an Account of
them. A little after the <HI>King</HI> returned to his Lodgings, but
we were gone out of them before: We stayed in the same Clo∣set
where we stopt at first: It was so near his Chamber, that
we heard him say, that he was never so hot, and that he would
put off his Collar: And indeed, the Sun does shine very hot in
this Country. At my first coming hither, I was afflicted with a
strange Meagrim, and could not imagine the cause of it, but
my Kinswoman told me 'twas because I wore too much upon my
Head, and that if I did not take care I might loose my sight so,
I immediately threw off my Bonnets and my Cornets, and since
that time I have never had any pain in my Head. For my
part, I cannot believe that there is in any part of the World
more serene Air than there's here: It is so pure, that you can∣not
perceive so much as one Cloud; and it is affirmed to me,
that even the Weather here in Winter, is like the finest Wea∣ther
in any other Country? That which is most dangerous here
is a certain Wind <HI>De Galiegue,</HI> which blows off the Mountains of
<PB N="257" REF="266"/>
<HI>Gallicia:</HI> It is not violent, but 'tis so piercing, that it reaches
the very Bones, and sometimes causes a Lameness in a Leg or
an Arm, and often in half the Body, which lasts for ones life:
It is more frequent in Summer than in Winter. Strangers
take it for the Western Briezes, and are ravisht when they
feel it, but experience convinces them of its Malignity. The
Seasons in <HI>Spain</HI> are much more convenient and pleasant than
either in <HI>France, England, Holland,</HI> or <HI>Germany.</HI> For not to rec∣kon
that purity of Air, which cannot be imagined so fine as 'tis
from the Month of <HI>September</HI> to the Month of <HI>June,</HI> 'tis not so
cold, but one can make a shift without fire; and this is the
reason why there's no Chimneys in any of their Apartments,
and that they make use only of Chafindishes. But 'tis a great
Happiness that Wood being so scarce as 'tis in this Country,
they have no occasion for't; It never freezes thicker than the
thickness of two Crowns, and there falls little Snow. But the
adjacent Mountains furnish <HI>Madrid</HI> with it all the Year round.
The Months of <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> are indeed excessive hot.</P>
<P>I was lately in a Company where all the Ladies were sadly
frighted: One of them said, that she had received a Letter from
<HI>Barcelona,</HI> which advised, that a Bell there, which was only
rung upon some publick Calamity, or upon some occasion of
the highest Consequence, had all alone rung several times:
This Lady came from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and she assured me, that when∣ever
any Misfortune and Misery is to befal <HI>Spain,</HI> or that any of
the House of <HI>Austria</HI> is to die, this Bell rings; that for a quar∣ter
of an Hour together, the Clapper of the Bell moves with a
strange quickness, and strikes in turning round: I would not
believe it, neither do I yet: But all the Company confirmed
what she said: If it is a Lye, there were above twenty that con∣spired
with her in it. They began to think upon what, and on
whom this unhappiness which by this sign is foretold was to
fall; and as they are very Superstitious, the beautiful Marchio∣ness
<HI>De Liche,</HI> increast their fears, by telling them, that <HI>Don
John</HI> was very sick.</P>
<P>In their deep Mourning, they are attired like Fools, but chief∣ly
on the first days; for the Foot-men as well as the Masters
have long Cloaks trailing, and instead of Hats, they wear a
high Past-board Cap covered with Crape, their Horses are all in
black Trappings, and Houssings which cover their Heads and all
their Bodies. Nothing looks uglier, their Coaches are so ill co∣vered
that the Cloth which covers the Roof hangs almost down
to the Boots. No body that sees this doleful Equipage but
would think, that some Corps is a carrying to be buryed; the
<PB N="258" REF="267"/>
People of Quality wear their Cloaks of black Bays, very thin
and rotten, the least thing tears it in pieces: And that Mourn∣ing
is most graceful, that is most ragged and tattered. I have
seen some <HI>Cavalleros</HI> which tore their Cloaths on purpose, and
I assure you, that through some of their Cloaths, you may see
their Skin as ugly as 'tis to look on: For though their Children
when they are young, are as white as Alabaster, and so pret∣ty,
that you would take them for Angels, yet it must be grant∣ed,
that as they grow bigger, they alter very strangely, the
heat of the Sun roast them, the Air tans them, and it is easie
to know a <HI>Spaniard</HI> from any other Nation: Their Features are
nevertheless regular, but still there wants methinks our Air and
Meen as well as our Skin and Complexion.</P>
<P>All the Scholars wear long Robes, with a little Border of
Linnen about their Necks instead of a Collar; they are habited
very like the Jesuits; there's of them above thirty Years old,
they are known to be Students by their Habits.</P>
<P>I fancy this City to look like a great Coup, in which they
feed Poultry: For really from the Level of the Street to the
fourth Story, one can see nothing but Lattices whose holes are
very small, and their very Balconies have them. There's always
to be seen some of the poor confined Women standing behind
them, to look upon Passengers, and when they dare, they open
them, and with great delight snew themselves; there's not a
Night passes without four or five hundred Consorts of Musick,
in several parts of the Town, it's true they are at a moderate
rate, and it is sufficient if a Gallant has only his Guittar or his
Harp, and sometimes both joyn'd with a Voice hoarse enough
to awake the most drowsie body, and affords them the pleasure
of a Queen. If either they do not understand what is most ex∣cellent,
or cannot obtain it, they are content with what they
can get: I never saw any Virginals or Theorba's here.</P>
<P>In every Street, and at every corner House, there's an Image
or Statue of our Lady dress'd after the Fashion of the Country,
with a Pair of Beads in her Hands, and either a great Wax
Candle or a Lamp burning before her: I have seen three or four
in my Kinswoman's Stable, with other pieces of Devotion, for
you must know, that every Groom will have his Oratory as well
as his Master, though perhaps neither one nor t'other often
pray there. When one Lady goes to visit another, if it be in
the Night, four Pages comes to receive her with great Flam∣boys
of white Wax, and in the same manner conduct her out
again, and while she's going into her Chair, they commonly
kneel upon one Knee: This is something more splendid, than
<PB N="259" REF="268"/>
the small Wax Candles enclosed in Links which are used in
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Here are Houses on purpose for Women of lewd Lives, like
the <HI>Madelennottes</HI> at <HI>Paris:</HI> They use them very severely, and
there is not a day passes that they are not whipt several times;
in a certain time they are released, but come out worse than
they went in, what they suffered making them not a bit the
better. They live almost altogether in a particular part of the
Town, where vertuous Women never go, but if by chance any
one does go that way, they run and pursue after her, as if she
was their Enemy, and if it happens that they are the strongest,
she is sure to be cruelly used, and for the <HI>Cavalleros</HI> they run
the Risque of being torn in pieces as oft as they pass that way,
that is to say, who shall have 'em. One takes him by the Arm, ano∣ther
by the Legs and a third by the Head, and if he grows angry,
they altogether fall upon him and rob him, and even strip him of
his Cloaths. My Kinswoman has a Page who was ignorant of the
Tricks of the wretched Wenches, and went innocently through
their Quarters, but they stript him as naked as common Thieves
in a Wood could have done; and yet a Man must be content
with this Treatment, for to whom shall he go for Restitution?</P>
<P>The Bell of <HI>Barcelona</HI> hath been but too true in its Progno∣sticks,
for <HI>Don John</HI> was the first of this Month brought down so
very low with his sickness, that the Physicians despaired of him,
and he was advised to prepare himself for Death: He received the
News with so much Tranquility and Resignation, as very much
confirmed the Belief that several Persons that before entertained,
that he had taken some private disgust, which made him rather
wish to die than live: The King came every moment into his
Chamber, and spent several hours at his Bed-side, notwithstand∣ing
his earnest Prayers that he would not so expose himself to a
Feaver: He received the Blessed <HI>Viaticum,</HI> made his Will, and
writ a Letter to a Lady whose name I could not learn: He com∣manded
<HI>Don Antonio Ortis</HI> his chief Secretary to carry it with a
little Box lockt, which I saw; it was made of <HI>China</HI> Wood, and
light enough to make one think there was in't nothing but Let∣ters
and perhaps some Jewels, while he was so dangerously sick,
a Courrier arrived with the News of the King's Marriage with
<HI>Mademoiselle,</HI> the Joy of which did not only fill the Palace, but
all the City shewed Expressions of it, for there were over the
whole Town Artificial Fire-works and Illuminations for three
Days together. The King could not contain himself, but run
into <HI>Don John's</HI> Chamber, and although he was very drousy and
heavy to sleep, and wanted rest, yet he awaked him to tell him
<PB N="260" REF="269"/>
that the Queen would quickly be here, and intreated him to
think of nothing but being well again, that he might assist at her
reception. Ah <HI>Syre,</HI> answered the Prince to him, <HI>I shall never
have that Satisfacti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, I should be content to die, if I had had the
Honour to have seen her once:</HI> The King fell a weeping, and told
him, <HI>That seeing him in that Condition, was the only thing that di∣sturbed
his Happiness.</HI> There was to have been a Bull-Feast, but
the Prince's sickness has caused it to be put off, and the King
would not have suffered any Fire-works in the Palace-Court,
had not <HI>Don John,</HI> notwithstanding he had a violent pain in his
Head begged him to permit them. In fine, the 17<HI>th</HI> of this
Month he dyed, extreamly regretted by some, and as little by o∣thers.
This is the fate both of Princes and Favourites, as well
as of Persons that move in an ordinary Sphere; and as his Cre∣dit
was already declining, and the Courtiers now thought of no∣thing
else but the Queen-Mothers return, and the Arrival of the
new Queen, so it is a mighty strange thing to observe with what
indifference the sickness and Death of <HI>Don John</HI> was taken, they
did not so much as talk of him the very next day, it seemed as
if he had never been in the World. Alas, Dear Cosen, does
not this deserve a little to be reflected on? He governed all the
Kingdoms of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> his very name struck Terror, he
caused the Queen-Mother to be banisht, he drove away Father
<HI>Nitard</HI> and <HI>Valenuela,</HI> who were both Favourites, he had for
the most part a greater Court than the King: And yet four and
twenty hours after he was dead, I believe <HI>I</HI> saw in different pla∣ces
fifty Persons of the highest Quality, which did not so much
as speak one word of this poor Prince, notwithstanding divers
of them had very great Obligations to him: And yet after all,
he had very great personal Qualifications and Virtues: He was
of a middle Stature, and a well shaped body, his Features were
regular, his Eyes black and lively, he had black Hair, a great
deal of it and very long: He was well bred, of a great Wit and
Judgment, very generous, brave and beneficent, and had a Ca∣pacity
for the highest Affairs. He was not ignorant of any thing
that was suitable to his Birth, nor of any of the Arts and Sci∣ences.
He both spoke and writ very well five several Languages,
and understood more: He was perfectly well read in History, he
could both make and play upon any Instrument as well as the
best Master. He understood how to turn several things; he
could forge Arms, and he much delighted in the Mathematicks,
but being called to the management of the Government, he was
obliged to take his thoughts off of all these Exercises. The face
of things changed in a moment, his Eyes were scarce closed,
<PB N="261" REF="270"/>
before the King (moved only by his own kind and easie Nature
for the Queen his Mother) run to <HI>Tolleda</HI> to see her, and to in∣treat
her to return, she consented to it with all the Joy she had
to see the King. They wept not a little, while they embraced
each other, and we saw them come back together. All the Per∣sons
of Quality went to meet their Majesties, and the People
shewed abundance of Joy. I should enlarge a great deal more
upon this return, did I not intend to be very particular in the
Memoirs I am writing.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> laid three days in his Bed of State, and in the same
Cloaths which he had made to go meet the young Queen, after
that he was carried to the <HI>Escurial:</HI> The Funeral had nothing
of Greatness, the Officers of his House, with a very few Friends
accompanyed him: He was laid in the little Vault near the <HI>Pan∣theon,</HI>
which is reserved solely for the Princes and Princesses of
the Royal Blood, for there are none bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed in the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> you
must know, but Kings, and those Queens that have had Chil∣dren,
those that have had none, are buryed in that particular
Vault. In a few days we are to go to the <HI>Escurial,</HI> which will
be when the King goes there; but he is so taken up with his
young Queen, that he can think of nothing but going towards
the Frontiers to meet her. In every place where I come, they
are continually ringing it aloud in my Ears, that she'll quickly
be Queen of two and twenty Kingdoms. In all likelihood there's
eleven of them in the <HI>Indies;</HI> for I only know those of the old
and new <HI>Castille, Arragon, Valentia, Navarre, Murcia, Grenada,
Andalousia, Gallicia, Leon,</HI> and the Isles <HI>Majorques.</HI> In these
Places there are some parts of them admirable, upon which it
seems as if Heaven had a mind to spread abroad its most benign
Influences. There are others again so barren, that there is nei∣ther
Corn, Herbs, Vines, Fruit, Meadows, nor Springs, and of
these one may say, there's more than of the others. But gene∣rally
speaking, the Air there is good and wholsome. In certain
parts the Heats are excessive, and in others the Cold and the
Winds are insupportable, although 'tis in the same Season. There
are a great many Rivers, but that which is pretty singular, is,
that the biggest of them is not Navigable, particularly those of
<HI>Tagus, Gurdiana, Minchio, Duero, Guadalguiver,</HI> and that of <HI>E∣bre;</HI>
for either because of the Rocks, the falls of Water, the
Gulphes, or the Turnings, Vessels cannot pass upon them, and
this is one of the greatest Difficulties of Trade, and which most
of all hinders those things from coming to Cities which there's
need of; for if there was an easie Communication between
them, those Places and Towns that want a great many Wares
<PB N="262" REF="271"/>
and Good, might be supplyed from those that abound, and so
every body might be furnished with necessary things at a reaso∣nable
price; whereas the Charges by Land-carriage being so
high one must want divers Conveniencies, unless you are in a
Condition to pay three times more for a thing than 'tis worth.</P>
<P>Amongst the several Cities which belong to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
these are esteemed, either for Beauty or Riches, <HI>viz. Madrid,
Sevelle, Grenada, Valentia, Sarragousa, Tolleda, Vailladolid, Cor∣doua,
Salamancha, Cadiz, Naples, Milan, Messina, Palermo, Cag∣liari,
Bruxelles, Antwerp, Gant,</HI> and <HI>Mons.</HI> There are a great
many others, which nevertheless are very considerable; and
several of the Towns are as big as Cities; but there are not in
them those multitudes of People, which are both the Riches and
Strength of a King. And there are divers Reasons to be given
why there is this defect. <HI>First,</HI> When King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> drove a∣way
the <HI>Moors</HI> out of <HI>Spain,</HI> and established the Inquisition,
what through the Punishments they inflicted upon some <HI>Jews,</HI>
and the banishing of others, there dyed and went out of the
Kingdom in a little while, above nine hundred thousand Persons,
besides, the <HI>Indies</HI> draw away abundance; the Unfortunate go
there to enrich themselves, and when they have done so, they
remain to enjoy the fruit of their Labour, and the Pleasures of
the Country. Again Soldiers are raised in <HI>Spain,</HI> and sent away
to Garison other Cities under the obedience of the King, these
Soldiers marry and settle in the Places where they happen to be,
and never return to those from whence they came. Add to this,
that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Women bear but few Children; if they have
three 'tis reckoned abundance, and Strangers do not come to in∣habit
there, as in other parts of the World, because they are not
loved there, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally <HI>recatados,</HI> that is sin∣gular,
and reserved to themselves, and will not be communicative
and open with other Nations, which they either envy or scorn.
And thus having examined into all those means which help to
depopulate the Country under his Catholick Majesty, one may
rather wonder that there are so many People remaining.</P>
<P>There grows but little Corn in <HI>Castille,</HI> it is brought from <HI>Si∣cily,
France</HI> and <HI>Flanders;</HI> and indeed, how should it grow, un∣less
the Earth would produce it of it self, as the Land of <HI>Pro∣mise</HI>
did? The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are too idle to take the pains to Till and
improve it, for being the meanest Peasant is perswaded that he
is <HI>Hidalgo,</HI> that is to say, a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> that in every little Fami∣ly
there's an Apocryphal History, composed within an hundred
Years, which he leaves to his Children and Nephews of a Vil∣lage
as an Inheritance, in which fabulous History they are all
<PB N="263" REF="272"/>
made to descend from ancient <HI>Chivalry,</HI> whose Ancestors have
done wonderful things; reciting that their Great Grandfather,
<HI>Don Pedro,</HI> and <HI>Don John,</HI> performed such and such Services to
the Crown. I say, they having taking up these vain Conceits of
themselves, no wonder if they will neither derogate from the
<HI>Gravidad,</HI> nor <HI>Decendentia.</HI> At this rate do they talk, and they
will more willingly endure Hunger, and all Severities of Life,
than work (say they) like Mercinaries, which belongs only to
Slaves. And thus Pride seconded by Sloth, hinder the most
part of them to sow their Land, unless some Strangers come
and help them to till their Ground, which by a special directi∣on
and guidance of Providence always happens. Strangers that
are more laborious and wordly minded, being moved thither
by the gain they find; so that you shall have a sorry Peasant
sitting in his Chair reading of a mouldy <HI>Romance,</HI> whilst these
Strangers are working for him, in order to carry away his
Money.</P>
<P>There's no Oats to be seen, Hay is scarce, their Horses and
Mules eat Barley in the Straw chopt small. The Hills and
Mountains in these Kingdoms I speak of, are of such a prodi∣gious
heighth and length, that I do not believe there's the like
in any other part of the World, one meets with some of an hun∣dred
Leagues in length, which joyn one to another in a con∣tinued
Chain, and which without Hyperbole, are higher than
the Clouds, they are called <HI>Sierras,</HI> amongst which are reckoned
the Mountains of <HI>Pyrenea, Granada, Astura, Alcantara, Morena, Tol∣leda,
Doua, Molina</HI> and <HI>Albanera.</HI> These Hills render the way
so very difficult, that no Waggons can pass, which obliges
them to carry all upon Mules, who are so sure footed, that in
two hundred Leagues continual travelling amongst Rocks, and
great Flint Stones, they will not so much as once stumble.</P>
<P>I have been shewed some of the <HI>Patents</HI> the <HI>King</HI> Grants,
I never read so many Titles, I'll set them down here. He calls
himself King of <HI>Spain, Castelle, Leon, Navarre, Arragon,
Grenada, Tolleda, Valentia, Gallicia, Seville, Murcia, Jaen,
Hierusalem, Naples, Sicily, Majorque, Minorque,</HI> and <HI>Sardagnia,</HI>
the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Indies,</HI> the <HI>Isles</HI> and <HI>Terra Firma</HI> of the
great <HI>Ocean,</HI> Arch Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundia, Bra∣bant,

Marquess of the <HI>Holy Empire,</HI> Lord of <HI>Friezland, Salines,
Vtrecht, Malines, Overissel</HI> and <HI>Groningen;</HI> and Grand Seignior
of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI> I have been told, that <HI>Francis</HI> I. laught
at these, when he received a Letter from <HI>Charles</HI> V. stuft with
<PB N="264" REF="273"/>
such arrogant Titles, and in his Answer gave himself no other
Title than <HI>Citizen</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Gentilis.</HI></P>
<P>They do not trouble their Heads to study much here, that
little they do know bears them out, for with the help of their
Wit and Grave looks, they seldom betray their ignorance by
being at a loss about any matters; when they speak, they
always seem to know more than they do; and when they are
silent, you would think them wise enough to resolve the most
knotty Questions. Nevertheless there are some famous Uni∣versities
in <HI>Spain,</HI> amongst which they reckon, <HI>Saragossa, Bar∣celona,
Salamanca, Alcala, Santiago, Grenada, Seville, Coim∣bra,
Terragona, Evora, Lisben, Madrid, Marcia, Majorque, Tol∣leda,
Lerida, Valantia</HI> and <HI>Occa:</HI> There are but few famous
Preachers; here and there you'll meet with some that are Pa∣thetical:
But indeed, let these Sermons be good or bad, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> that hear them will perpetually beat their breasts with
an Extraordinary fervour, and even disturb the Preacher with
the grievous Cry which their troubled Consciences make them
utter. I am willing to believe that there are a few that have
some compunction, but in my Conscience, I doubt far less than
they make shew of: They never leave off their <HI>Swords,</HI> either
when they go to Confession or the Sacrament; they say,
they wear them to defend <HI>Religion;</HI> and in the Morning before
they put them on, they kiss them and make the sign of the <HI>Cross</HI>
with them; they pay an excessive Devotion to the Blessed
<HI>Virgin,</HI> and put an extraordinary confidence in her; there's
hardly any Man that does not wear a <HI>Scapular</HI> or some em∣broidered
<HI>Image</HI> that hath toucht some of those that are held to
be <HI>miraculous;</HI> and tho' otherwise they do not lead lives very
regular, yet they will not forbear praying to <HI>her</HI> with a trust,
that 'tis <HI>she</HI> that must protect and save them from the greatest
Evils; they are very charitable, not only upon the account of
the Merits by Alms Deeds, but also by a natural Inclination
they have to give, and a real pain they endure if either through
Poverty, or for any other reason they are forced to refuse any
thing that is askt them; they have also another good Quality,
which is never to forsake their Friend in Sickness, their care
and their concern is far greater in such a time, when doubtless
the Presence as well as the Assistance of a Friend is most want∣ed.
So that Persons that do not see one another four times in
a Year, yet are constant in their Visits three or four times every
day; when one is under any affliction, and that they can
become useful to each other: But as soon as they are well,
they resume the same way of living they used before they
were sick.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="274"/>
<HI>Don Frederick de Cardonna,</HI> of whom I now talk to you,
Dear Cousen, as if he and you were well acquainted, is returned,
He hath brought me a Letter from the fair Marchioness <HI>De los
Rios,</HI> who without doubt is still one of the prettiest Women
in the World, and who is not weary of her retirement. I also
by him heard from the Arch-bishop of <HI>Burgos,</HI> whose Merits are
uncommon; and he added, that he came back in the company
of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentleman, who had told him some very wonder∣ful
things; amongst others, that every <HI>Spaniard</HI> who is born on
<HI>Good-Friday,</HI> whenever they go by or through any Church yard,
in which there has been any body buryed that was murdered,
or if they pass through any place where a Murder has been
committed, altho' the Man who was kill'd has been taken away,
yet for all that he appears to them all bloody, and in the same
manner and condition he happened to be in when he was
murdered, and this too, whether they knew one another or no:
This certainly is a very unpleasant thing to those it happens,
but in requital they can cure the Plague with breathing upon
the Party, and do not receive the Infection, altho' they be with
those that have the Plague upon them: Many People, said he,
wondred that <HI>Philip</HI> the IV. held his head so high, and staired
up with his eyes, the reason was, he was born on <HI>Good Friday,</HI>
and when he was very young he had several Apparitions of
these Persons that had been murdered; so that with the
fright of them, he had got a custom (very seldom) to hold down
his head: But, said I to <HI>Don Frederic,</HI> did he talk seriously, and
as if these things were allowed of every body without any doubt.
And just as I was saying, that it would be worth while to en∣quire
of some creditable Person about these Matters; <HI>Don Fer∣dinand
de Tolleda</HI> came into my Chamber, and so he askt him,
and he assured me that he had very frequently heard folks talk
thus of these Matters, but yet he would not answer for the
Truth. It is also said, continued he, that there are a certain
People which can kill a mad Dog with breathing upon him,
and that they have a Power to remain in the Fire without be∣ing
burnt; and yet I could never see any of them that cared to
trust themselves there, but they give this reason, that tho' they
could safely do it, yet there would be something of Vanity in
it by such peculiar Favours from Heaven to distinguish them∣selves
from other Men; and for my part, said I laughing, I am
of Opinion these Men have more Prudence than Humility:
They are afraid (as 'tis but reasonable) of the biting of the Dog,
and the Heat of the Furnace. I am altogether of your mind,
<HI>Madam,</HI> replyed <HI>Don Frederick,</HI> I can give little Faith to
things above nature.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="275"/>
<HI>I</HI> do not pretend to make you believe it, says <HI>Don Fer∣nand,</HI>
tho' I must tell you, I do not find any thing in this Matter
more extraordinary than in a thousand Prodigies which we e∣very
day see. Do you think, for instance, that you ought less
to wonder at that <HI>Lake</HI> which is near <HI>Gaudalajora</HI> in <HI>Anda∣lousia,</HI>
which foretells approaching Tempests, by most horrid
bellowing and roaring, that is heard above twenty thousand
Paces distance? and what do ye say of that other <HI>Lake</HI> which
is found upon the very top of the Mountains <HI>Clavio,</HI> in the
<HI>Comte</HI> of <HI>Roussilon</HI> near to <HI>Perpignan?</HI> It is extream deep, there's
in't Fishes, both for bigness and shape that are monstrous;
when a Stone is thrown into it, there are Vapours seen to
come out with a mighty noise, and to ascend into the Air,
and there convert into the Clouds, which produce most ter∣rible
Storms, accompanyed with Thunder, Lightning and Air,
Is it not likewise true, continued he, in addressing himself to
<HI>Don Frederick,</HI> that near the Castle of <HI>Gracimanos,</HI> in a Cavern,
which is called <HI>Judea,</HI> not far from the Bridge <HI>Talayredas,</HI>
there's a Spring whose Water freezes as it drops, and grows
so hard, that it becomes a perfect Stone, which cannot easily
be broken, and with which in that Country they build fine
Houses? You have a good Stock of Examples, said <HI>Don Frede∣rick,</HI>
but if you will, I'll furnish you with some others for
your purpose. Do you remember the Mountain of <HI>Monrayo</HI> in
<HI>Arragon;</HI> If the sheep feed upon't before the sun rise they die,
but if they are sick, and feed there after the Sun is up they are
cured. I must not forget neither the Spring in the Isle of <HI>Ca∣diz,</HI>
which is dry when 'tis high Water, and runs when the
Tide ebbs: You shall not be the only Person, said I, in inter∣rupting
him, that shall second <HI>Don Fernand</HI> in these sorts of Re∣lations,
I must tell him, that in the same <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> there's
a certain Plant which withers upon the first appearance of the
Sun, and grows green again as soon as Night comes. <HI>Ah, pret∣ty
Plant,</HI> cries <HI>Don Fernand</HI> in Laughing. <HI>Well, I have enough
now to be revenged for all the sport you have made at my Stories for
this Hour together: I declare open War against you about this Plant,
and if you do not send for one hither, I know what I'll believe.</HI>
The facetious Humour of this <HI>Cavallero</HI> made us very pleasantly
pass the Evening, but we were interrupted by my Kinswoman
who returned out of the City, where she had spent some part
of the day at her Lawyers, who was at the point of Death, he is
very old, and a very knowing Man in his Profession: She told
us, that all his Children stood round his Bed, and that the only
thing which he recommended to them, was always to preserve a
<PB N="267" REF="276"/>
good stock of <HI>Gravity;</HI> and after he had blest them, says he to
'em, what greater good can I now wish you, my dear Children,
than to lead your whole Lives at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and never to quit this
<HI>Earthly Paradice,</HI> but for the <HI>Heavenly:</HI> This may shew con∣tinued
she, the strange Prepossession the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have for
<HI>Madrid,</HI> and the Happiness they enjoy in that Court: For my
part said I, in interrupting her, I am perswaded there's a∣bundance
of Vanity in that fondness that they express for their
own Nation, for certainly they have too much Sense not to know
that there are many other Countries far more agreeable. Is it
not true, said I, in addressing my self to <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> that
tho' you will not say as I say, that you have the same thoughts?
what my thoughts are, said he in smiling, is no rule for other
folks; I must tell you, that since my return, I am upbraided by
every body with being no longer a <HI>Spaniard:</HI> But certain it is,
that People being so bewitcht with the Delights and Charms
of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and not having power to forsake it in any season of
the Year, no body has thoughts of Building pretty Houses in the
Country whither they might sometimes retire; so that all adja∣cent
parts about the City, which should be filled with delicious
Gardens and splendid Seatslook like so many little Deserts, and this
is the reason also, why the City in Summer as well as in Win∣ter,
is equally crowded with People: Hereupon my Kinswoman
said, she would have me to the <HI>Escurial,</HI> and that it was agreed
on by the Marchioness of <HI>Palacios</HI> and <HI>La Rosa,</HI> to go two
days hence; the Lady your Mother, added she, in speaking to
<HI>Don Fernand,</HI> designs you to make one, and I indeed to secure
<HI>Don Frederick</HI> for another, they both declared, that with abun∣dance
of Joy, they would go this little Journey; and indeed,
the next day we went to kiss <HI>Queen-Mothers</HI> hand, and to know
her commands for the <HI>Escurial:</HI> For you must know, 'tis the
Custom, when one is to go out of <HI>Madrid,</HI> first to pay their re∣spects
to the <HI>Queen.</HI> But we had not seen her since her return,
she looks merrier than she did at <HI>Tolleda,</HI> and told us, she did
not think of coming back so soon to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that now it
seemed, as if she had never been out of it. There was brought
before her a <HI>Gyant-Woman</HI> that came from the <HI>Indies:</HI> As soon
as she saw her, she caused her to be taken away, she was so af∣frighted
at her. Her Ladies would make this <HI>Colossus</HI> dance,
who held in each hand two <HI>She Dwarfs</HI> that played upon the
Castinets and the <HI>Biscay</HI> Drum, all this was ugly in the highest
degree. My Kinswoman observed in the <HI>Queen Mothers</HI> Apartment,
things which had been <HI>Don John's,</HI> amongst others an admira∣ble
Pendulum Clock, all set with Diamonds, he made her in
<PB N="268" REF="277"/>
part, his Heir, in all likelihood 'twas to testifie his regret for
having troubled and vexed her.</P>
<P>The Journey to the <HI>Escurial</HI> was performed with all imagina∣ble
Satisfaction, the desire of entertaining you with it, hindred
me from sending you the Letter I begun before I went thither,
the same Ladies that went to <HI>Arranjus</HI> and <HI>Tolleda,</HI> were very
glad to embrace the occasion of taking the Air a little in so fine
a Season, and we went first to the <HI>Prado,</HI> which is a Royal House,
the Building like the rest in <HI>Spain</HI> is handsome enough, that is, it
consists of a square of four several Apartments separted by Gal∣leries
of Communication, which are supported with Pillars, the
Furniture of it, is not indeed stately, but there are good Pictures,
amongst others, those of the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> in odd sorts of
Dresses.</P>
<P>We were shewed a little Closet, which the late King used to
call his beloved, because in it he was wont sometimes to enter∣tain
himself with his Mistresses, this Prince who was seemingly
so cold and grave, that he was hardly ever seen to laugh, was
really the most amorous and the pleasantest of Men. There is
a Garden well enough kept, and a Park of a considerable extent,
whether the King frequently goes to hunt, we were afterwards
at a Convent of the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> which stands on the top of a
Hill, this is a Place of great Devotion, because of a Crucifix
which it seems was taken from the true Cross, and which often
works Miracles: After we had said our Prayers there, we de∣scended
on the other side of the Hill, to a certain Hermitage
where there was a Recluse, that would neither see us, nor speak
to us, but he threw a Ticket to us through his Grate, in which
we found it writ, that he would recommend us to God. We
were all extream weary, for we were forced to walk a foot up
the Hill, and it was very hot Weather, we perceived in the
bottom of the Hill a very little Cottage by the side of a Brook,
which runs amongst Willow Trees, we steered our Course that
way, and when we were yet a great way off, we could see a Man
and a Woman very well drest, rise up nimbly from the foot of
a Tree where they were set, and run into that Cottage, and shut
the Door as hastily as if they had taken us for thieves, but
doubtless it was fear of being known, which made them avoid us,
we went to the Place they had left, being set on the Grass, we
fell to eating some Fruit we brought with us, we were so nigh
this little House, that they could easily see through their Win∣dows
what we were doing; there came out a very pretty Coun∣try
Lass, and with a Sea-Rush Basket addrest her self to us, and
kneeling, begged some of the Fruit of our Collation for a Big∣bellye'd
<PB N="273" REF="278"/>
Woman, that would die if we refused her. Immediate∣ly
we sent her some of the fairest, and quickly after the same
young Girl came again with a Gold Snuff-box, and told us the
<HI>Senora</HI> of the <HI>Casita,</HI> that is the Lady of the little House, in∣treated
us to accept of some Snuff for an Acknowledgment of
the Favour we had done her. It is the Fashion here to present
Snuff when they have a mind to express their Friendship; we
stayed so long by the Water-side, that we resolved to go no
further that the <HI>Carcuela,</HI> which is another of the King's Hou∣ses,
but not so handsom as the <HI>Pardo,</HI> and so neglected, that
there's nothing worth commending, but the Waters; we were
ill enough lodged there, though we laid in the very same Beds
his Majesty did; and we were very lucky in taking along with
us all Necessaries for Supper. After that we went into the
Gardens, which are in bad Order, the Fountains run Day and
Night, the Water there is so good and in such plenty, that for
as little almost as one would desire, it might be made as plea∣sant
a Dwelling as any in the World. But 'tis not the Custom
in this Country, from the King to private Persons, to keep se∣veral
Country Houses in good Repair, they let them go to ruin,
for want of some very small Reparations. Our Beds were so ill,
that we were not loath to leave them early the next Morning to
go to the <HI>Escurial.</HI> We went by <HI>Monareto,</HI> where the Woods
begin, and a little further is the Park which belongs to the Con∣vent
of the <HI>Escurial:</HI> For in effect it is one which <HI>Philip</HI> the II<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
built among the Mountains, that so he might the more easily get
the Stone which he needed, of which there is such a prodigious
Quantity, that without seeing it, one cannot conceive it, and
certainly it is one of the vastest Buildings we have in <HI>Europe:</HI>
We went up to it through a very long Walk of Elm Trees,
which are planted in four Rows, the great Gate is stately adorn'd
with divers Marble Pillars rais'd one upon another, till they
reach up to the Statue of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> which stands on the top,
the King's Arms are cut upon a certain Stone which is called the
Thunder-Stone, and is brought from <HI>Arabia,</HI> the cutting of
which cost threescore thousand Crowns. It is easie to believe,
that having been at so considerable a Charge for a thing so little
useful, they would not spare any Cost for others which might
be necessary and contribute to the Beauty of the Place. It is a
great Square Pile of Building; but beyond the Square there
runs out a Length, which contains the Buildings of the En∣trance,
and are contriv'd to represent the Form of the <HI>Gridiron</HI>
on which St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> (who is the Patron of the Monastery)
suffered Martyrdom. It is build according to the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order▪

<PB N="273" REF="280"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="274" REF="281"/>
and very plain; the Square is divided in the middle, and one
of those Divisions which looks upon the Order, opens it self
both ways into four other lesser Squares, which are four Cloy∣sters
built also according to the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order, and who sees one
of them, sees all the rest, the Building has nothing in it, either
as to its Design or Architecture, that is extraordinary; that
which is to be admired, is the Vastness of it, being Three hun∣dred
and eighty Paces in the Square, for besides those four
Cloysters I have mentioned, the other Division of the Square,
subdivided into two, makes two other Piles of Building, one of
which is, the King's Quarters, and the other is the Colledge;
for there are in it abundance of Pensioners, whom the King
maintains to study: The Friars that live in it are <HI>Hieronomites,</HI>
this Order is unknown in <HI>France,</HI> and it is abolisht in <HI>Italy,</HI>
because a certain <HI>Hieronomite</HI> Fryar attempted at <HI>Milan</HI> the Life
of St. <HI>Charles Borromeo:</HI> But he did not hurt him, though he
shot at him, and the Bullets pierced his Pontifical Habit; but
nevertheless this Order is here in great Esteem, there are three
hundred Monks in the Convent of the <HI>Escurial,</HI> they live much
after the same way of the <HI>Carthusians,</HI> they speak little, and
pray much, and Women never come into their Church, but be∣sides
they ought to study and preach.</P>
<P>But there's another thing yet, which makes this Building con∣siderable,
and that is, the nature of the Stone of which it is
built. It was taken out of the neighbouring Quarries, it is of
a grayish colour, the sharpest Air and severest Weather makes
no impression on't, it does not soil or grow dirty, but constant∣ly
preserves that colour it had when it was taken up. <HI>Philip</HI> II.
was two and twenty years in building it, he enjoyed it thir∣teen,
and then dy'd in't, This Structure cost him six Millions
of Gold. <HI>Philip</HI> IV. added the <HI>Pantheon</HI> to it, that is to say a
<HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulchre,</HI> like the <HI>Pantheon</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> contrived under the great
Altar of the Church, all of Marble, Jasper and Perphiry, in
which there are six and twenty most stately Tombs inchased in
the Walls, and one goes down into it by a pair of Stairs all of
Jasper. I fanceyd my self descending into some of those en∣chaun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
places which our Romances and Books of Chevalry talk
of. The Tabernacle, the Architecture of the Altar, the steps
by which one ascends to it, the Pyx or Box in which the Host
is kept, are made all of one single Agat, are so many Wonders.
The Riches that are there, in precious Stones and Gold, is in∣credible.
One single Cupboard of Relicks (for there are four
in the four Chappels of the Church) infinitely exceeds the Trea∣sure
of St. <HI>Mark</HI> at Ven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. The Ornaments of the Church
<PB N="275" REF="282"/>
are embroider'd with Pearls and precious Stones; and so are the
Chalices and Vessels of precious Stones. The Candlesticks and
the Lamps are of pure Gold. There are forty little Chappels,
and as many Altars, upon which are put every day forty several
Cloaths and Attires. The forepart of the great Altar is com∣pos'd
of four Ranks of Jasper Pillars, and one goes up to the
Altar by seventeen Steps of Porphiry Stone. The Tabernacle
is beautified with several Pillars of Agat, and divers curious
Figures of Metal and Chrystal. One can see nothing about the
Tabernacle but Gold, Azur Stone, and other Stones so transpa∣rent,
that through them the Sacrament (which is kept in an A∣gat
Vessel) is easily perceived. This Tabernacle is esteemed at
a Million of Crowns. There are eight pair of Organs, the Chairs
or Seats in the Quire are made of rare Wood, which comes from
the <HI>Indies,</HI> curiously wrought after the pattern of those of St.
<HI>Dominick</HI> at <HI>Boulogne.</HI> The Cloysters of the Monastery are ex∣tream
fine, in the middle there's a Flower Garden, and a Chap∣pel
which opens four ways▪ whose Roof is supported with Por∣phiry
Pillars, between which there are Niches in which are pla∣ced
the four Evangelists with an Angel, and the several Crea∣tures
made of white Marble bigger then Nature, who throw out
Torrents of Water into Marble Basins. The Chappel is arch'd
with curious Architecture, and pav'd with black and white Mar∣ble.
There are divers Pictures of an inestimable value, and in
the Chapter-Room, which is very large there is besides most
excellent Pictures, two Bass-Reliefs all of Agat, two foot and a
half long, which cannot be valued. As to the Church, it has
nothing extraordinary in its Structure, it is bigger than that of
the Jesuits in St. <HI>Anthony's</HI> Street at <HI>Paris,</HI> but of the same form,
except that like their House, it is of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order. <HI>Bra∣manto</HI>
the famous <HI>Italian</HI> Architect, drew the Model and De∣sign
of it. The King and Queens Apartments are not stately,
but <HI>Philip</HI> II. intended this only for a House of Prayer and Re∣tirement,
the Church and the Library were the things he took
most care to adorn. <HI>Titian</HI> the famous Painter, and divers o∣thers
besides have exhausted all their Art and Skill in curiously
painting the Galleries of the Library, which indeed are admira∣ble,
not only for the excellent Painting, but for a hundred thou∣sand
Volumes that are there, without reckoning the original
Manuscripts of several Fathers and Doctors of the Church, which
are delicately bound and gilt. You'll easily guess at the bigness
of the <HI>Escurial,</HI> when I have told you that there are in it seven∣teen
Cloysters, two and twenty Courts, eleven thousand Win∣dows,
above eight hundred Pillars, and an infinite number of
<PB N="276" REF="283"/>
Parlours, Halls and Chambers. A little after the Death of <HI>Phi∣lip</HI>
II. there was taken from the Fryars of the <HI>Escurial,</HI> a certain
Estate in Lands (called <HI>Campillo</HI>) which the late King had given
them, and was worth eighteen thousand Crowns <HI>per Annum,</HI> and
this was done by virtue of a Clause in his Will, by which he
revoked all the immense Donations, which in his Life time he
had given.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bragance</HI> being at Court in King <HI>Philip</HI> the Se∣con'ds
time, he had a mind they should go with him to the
<HI>Escurial,</HI> that he might see that stately Pile of Building. And
as he had the care of shewing it to him, told him, It was
built in performance of a Vow which <HI>Philip</HI> II. made at the
Battel of St. <HI>Quintin,</HI> the Duke replyed, <HI>He that made so great
a Vow, must needs have a great Terror upon him.</HI> And now in
mentioning this King, I remember to have heard, that <HI>Charles</HI> V.
recommended to him the preservation of the three Keys of
<HI>Spain.</HI> These were the <HI>Streights-mouth, Flushing</HI> in <HI>Zealand,</HI>
and <HI>Cadiz.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Moors</HI> have the first, the <HI>Dutch</HI> the
second, and the <HI>English</HI> had the last, but the King of <HI>Spain</HI> soon
recovered it from them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Escurial</HI> is built upon a descent of some Rocks in a de∣sert
and barren Place, and environed with Hills; the Village
stands below it, and has but few Houses in't; it's in a manner
always cold Weather there. The extent of the Gardens and
the Park is a prodigious thing to see, in which one meets with
Woods, Plains, and a vast House in the midst, in which the
Keepers lodge; it abounds with all sorts of Deer and Fowl.</P>
<P>After having seen a Place which so highly deserves our admi∣ration,
we all left it, and as we had visited the Royal Houses of
<HI>Pardo</HI> and <HI>Carcu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la,</HI> we return'd over the Mountains, which is
a nearer way, but very troublesome. We came by <HI>Colmenar,</HI>
and coasting along the little River of <HI>Guadarana,</HI> we past
through <HI>Rozas</HI> and <HI>Aravaca,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Madrid,</HI> where we
learnt that the Queens Houshold were just going away to meet
her upon the Frontier. We immediately went to the Palace to
bid a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iew to the Dutchess <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> and the other Ladies.
The King had made them all be mounted, that he might see
after what manner they would be on the day of her Entry;
for this reason all the Gardens, and Doors every way were kept
close shut and guarded, and no Man was to enter there. The
young Court Ladies lookt well enough, but good God! what
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ures were the Dutchess <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> and <HI>Donna Maria
de Alarcon,</HI> who were the Governantes of the Queens Maids;
they rid every one upon a Mule shod with Silver, and all friz'd
<PB N="277" REF="284"/>
with a large housing of black Velvet, like that the Physicians
in <HI>Paris</HI> ride with upon their Horses. These Ladies, drest like
Widows, (which I have already describ'd to you) very old
and ugly, with morose and imperious Looks, wore broad Hats,
tyed with strings under their Chin; and twenty Gentlemen
which walkt a foot by their sides, held them up, lest they should
fall. They would never have suffered these Men to have
touch'd them in that manner, had not they fear'd breaking their
Necks. For you must know, dear Cousen, that though every
Lady has two Gentlemen Ushers, and that they go with them
where ever they go, yet they never give them their Hand.
They walk by their sides, and present to them their Elbows
wrapt in their Cloaks, which makes their Arms look monstrous
thick. The Ladies do not come near them; but that which
is yet more strange, if the Queen in walking should happen to
fall, unless her Ladies were near her to help her up, though
there were an hundred Gentlemen there, she must be pleased,
either to rise by her self, or lie all day upon the Ground, for
none dare take her up.</P>
<P>We spent part of the Afternoon in looking at these Ladies;
the Equipage they had indeed was very rich, but very poorly
and dully contriv'd. The Dutchess of <HI>Terra Nova</HI> had alone,
six Litters of Velvet of various colours, and all embroider'd, and
forty Mules, whose houssings were as costly as ever I saw any.
You will not hear from me again, dear Cousen, before the
Queen is come hither. While the King is gone to meet her,
and the whole Court is absent, my Kinswoman will go into
<HI>Andalousia,</HI> about some business she has there. I might send you
a short Relation of our little Journey, if I could be assur'd it
would please you. I most heartily embrace you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole Court is return'd, and in my Memoirs you'll find,
dear Cousen, the particulars of the Queens Journey. The
King and she were both together in one Coach, and the Curtains
being all open, I saw her at her arrival here: She was drest af∣ter
<PB N="278" REF="285"/>
the <HI>Spanish</HI> way, and I did not think that she lookt less hand∣some
in this, than in her <HI>French</HI> Garb, but the King was drest
<HI>a-la-Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mberg,</HI> which is the <HI>Spanish</HI> Habit for the Country, and
'tis almost like the <HI>French.</HI> I have heard it told how strangely
the Queen was surpris'd the first time she had the Honour to see
him, he had on a close body'd Coat of grey <HI>Barragon,</HI> very short
and wide, Velvet Breeches, Stockings of <HI>Pel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that is, raw Silk,
which they work so very loose, that their Skin appears through
them; this Silk is as small as a Hair, and though they be very
strait, yet the King pulls them on at once, and so he'll tear some∣times
twenty pair one after another. He had also a very fine
Cravat, which the Queen sent him, but it was tyed a little too
loose: His Hair was put behind his Ears, and he wore a grey
Hat. All the Journey, which was very long, they sat close to
each other in a large Coach, and seldom could understand one
another but by some certain signs, for the King cannot speak a
word of <HI>French,</HI> and the Queen could speak but very little <HI>Spa∣nish.</HI>
Upon their arrival at <HI>Madrid</HI> they went to sing <HI>Te Deum</HI>
at our Lady <HI>de Atocha</HI> attended by all the Persons of Quality, and
a multitude of the People, that made the Air resound with Ac∣clamations
of Joy. Afterwards their Majesties went to <HI>Buen
Retiro,</HI> because the Apartments in the Palace were not yet
ready, and that the Queen was not to remain there till she had
made her Entry. This time must needs have been very tedi∣ous
to her, for she saw no body but the <HI>Camerera Major</HI> and her
Ladies. She's forc'd to lead a Life so much against her Incli∣nations,
that she has need of all that Discretion and Sweetness
of Temper she's possess'd of to be able to endure it. She has
not so much as the Liberty to see the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador, to be
short, 'tis a perpetual <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orment. All the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ladies love
her dearly, and amongst themselves pity her.</P>
<P>I was sometime ago at the Countess of <HI>Villambrosa</HI>'s, and in a
great deal of Company. The Marchioness <HI>de la Fuenta</HI> came in
there, and as they are extream superstitious in this Country, so
she told them, like one affrighted, that being with the Queen,
who looking her self in a great Glass, and laying her hand gent∣ly
upon't, it crackt from top to bottom, and that the Queen be∣held
it without being in the least moved, but even laught at the
Consternation that all the Ladies about her were in, telling
them, it betrayed a weakness of Mind to take such notice of
things and Accidents as might proceed from natural Causes.
They discoursed and argued a great while upon this matter, and
with deeps sighs said, that their Queen would not live long.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="286"/>
She also told us, that the <HI>Queen</HI> was much more disturbed at
the incivility of the <HI>Camerera Major,</HI> who seeing some of her
Hairs out of place on her Forehead, spit on her fingers to lay
them smooth, upon which the Queen stayed her Arm, telling her
in a Majestick way, that the best Essence there, was not too
good, and that taking her Handkerchief, she was a great while
a cleaning that part of her Hair which this piece of Antiquity
had so unhandsomely wet. It is no uncommon thing here, to
wet ones head all over, the better to smooth and make the Hair
shine, the first time my Head was drest after the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mode,
one of my Relations Women undertook this curious piece of
work, she was no less than three hours tugging and pulling my
Head, and finding that my Hair, which is naturally curling,
would not comply, without saying a word to me, she dipt a
great Spunge twice in a Bason of Water, and baptized me so
handsomly, that I was laid up with a Cold for a Month.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Queen,</HI> it would draw pity from one to
see how this <HI>Camerera</HI> treats her, I am well assured, that she
neither suffers her to have so much as a single Hair curled, nor
to come near her Chamber Windows, nor to speak to any body,
and yet the <HI>King</HI> loves the <HI>Queen</HI> with all his Heart, and for the
most part eats with her, and that without Ceremony, so that
very often when the <HI>Maids of Honour</HI> are laying the Cloth, the
<HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> will divert themselves in helping them, one
will lay the Cloth, and t'other a Napkin: The <HI>Queen</HI> has her
Meat drest after the <HI>French</HI> way, and the <HI>King</HI> his after the <HI>Spa∣nish.</HI>
He has a Woman Cook to dress all his Victuals, but the
<HI>Queen</HI> endeavours to bring him to like the <HI>Ragous</HI> that are made
for her, but he cannot abide them. But now you must not ima∣gine,
that their <HI>Majesties</HI> are surrounded with their <HI>Courtiers</HI>
when they are at Dinner, at the most, there's only some <HI>Ladies</HI>
of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> a few <HI>Menins,</HI> but a great many Male and Fe∣male
<HI>Dwarfs.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Queen</HI> made her Entry the 13<HI>th</HI> of <HI>January;</HI> after all
the Passages and Avenues of the great Road which leads to <HI>Buen
Retiro</HI> were stopt, and all Coaches forbid to come that way,
there was a <HI>Triumphal Arch</HI> built, and the <HI>Queen</HI> painted upon't.
It was also covered with divers Garlands, and had several Em∣blems
and other things painted, it was set in the way by which
the <HI>Queen</HI> must pass to go into <HI>Madrid,</HI> on each side there was
a sort of a Gallery which had places contriv'd in them, to shew
the Arms of the several Kingdoms under the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominion,
joyning one to another, by certain Pillars which supported some
gilt Statues, every one of which represented Crowns and In∣scriptions
<PB N="280" REF="287"/>
which had relation to those Kingdoms.</P>
<P>This Gallery reached to the Triumphal Gate on the great
Boad, which was very rich and adorned with several Statues,
where likewise there were four beautiful and young Maids drest
like <HI>Nymphs</HI> waiting for the Queen, and holding in their hands
Baskets of Flowers, ready to strow them on the Ground as she
past, hardly was one out of this Gate or Arch but a second ap∣peared,
and so for a great way one after another was seen. These
were adorned with the <HI>Kings Council,</HI> that of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI>
the <HI>Council</HI> of the <HI>Indies,</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> of <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
and other Places, under so many gilt Statues; that of
Justice was higher raised than all the rest. A little further was
represented the <HI>Golden Age,</HI> accompany'd with the <HI>Law, Re∣wards,
Protection</HI> and <HI>Punishments.</HI> The Temple of <HI>Faith</HI> was
exhibited in a Picture, <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Fidelity</HI> opened the Gate, and
<HI>Joy</HI> came forth to receive the new <HI>Queen.</HI> There was besides,
a Picture which shewed the Reception <HI>Solomon</HI> gave the <HI>Queen</HI>
of <HI>Sheba,</HI> and another where <HI>Deborah</HI> was giving of Laws to her
People. There were also the Statues of <HI>Ceres, Astrea, Ʋnion,
Vertue, Life, Safety, Time,</HI> the <HI>Earth, Tranquility, Peace, Great∣ness,
Rest, Themis,</HI> and <HI>Liberality.</HI> Amongst all the Paintings
I took notice of, that where <HI>Aeneas</HI> is descending into Hell;
<HI>Cerberus</HI> chained by the <HI>Sybile,</HI> the <HI>Elysian Fields,</HI> where <HI>An∣chises</HI>
shewed his Son who should succeed him in his Posterity.
The rest were filled with an infinite number of <HI>Hierogliphicks.</HI>
The Queen stopt at the third Arch, which was over against a
very fine <HI>Parterre</HI> in her way, in it were falls of Water, Grot∣tas,
Fountains and white Marble Statues. Nothing could be
more pleasant than this Garden: It belonged to the <HI>Fryars</HI> of St.
<HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Paulo,</HI> who built it. The fourth Gate was in the
middle of the Place called <HI>Del Sol,</HI> it was no less glorious than
the others by the Gold, Pictures, Statues and Motto's about it.</P>
<P>The Street where the <HI>Furriers</HI> dwelt was all full of seeming A∣nimals,
though their Skin was so artificially stufft, that any Bo∣dy
would have taken them for living Tygars, Lions, Bears, and
Panthers. The fifth Gate, which was that of <HI>Guadalajara</HI>
had its peculiar Ornaments, and after that, the <HI>Queen</HI> past in∣to
the Goldsmiths Street, the side of which, was set full of An∣gels
of pure Silver, there were seen also divers Bucklers of Gold,
upon which were contrived the <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Queens</HI> Names with
their Arms, in Pearls, Rubies, Diamonds, Emeraulds, and other
Stones so fine and rich, that the Skilful said, there was to the
value of above twelve Millions. In the <HI>Placa Mayor</HI> there was
an Amphitheater set full of Statues, and adorned with Paint∣ings.
<PB N="281" REF="288"/>
The last Gate was near that, in the middle of the first
Front of the <HI>Queen</HI> Mothers Pallace, was seen <HI>Apollo,</HI> all the
<HI>Muses,</HI> the Picture of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> on Horseback, and
divers others things which I did not mind so much to give you
an Account of them. The <HI>Pallace</HI> Court was surrounded with
young Men and Maids, which represented all the Rivers both
great and small of <HI>Spain,</HI> they were Crowned with Reeds and Wa∣ter
lillies, with Pots overturn'd, and the rest of their Attire sui∣table.
They complimented the <HI>Queen</HI> in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Spanish,</HI> there
were also erected in this Court, two Castles of artificial Fire∣works.
All the <HI>Pallace</HI> was hung the richest Tapistry
that belonged to the Crown, and there are but few Places in
the World where there is finer seen, two Chariots full of <HI>Musi∣cians</HI>
went before their Majesties.</P>
<P>The Magistrates of the City came out of their <HI>Publick</HI> House
in their Robes, which were made of <HI>Brocado</HI> embroidered with
Gold; they wore little Hats buttoned up with Plumes of Fea∣thers,
and were mounted upon very fine Horses, they came to
present the Keys of the City to the <HI>Queen</HI> and to receive her
under a Canopy. The <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Queen</HI> Mother went in a
Coach all open that the People might see them, as far as the
Countess of <HI>Ognates</HI> House, where the <HI>Queen</HI> came to them.</P>
<P>Six Trumpeters in black and red Suites in company of the
City Kettle Drums mounted upon fine Horses, whose Houssings
were of black Velvet, marched before the <HI>Alcade</HI> of the <HI>Court,</HI>
the <HI>Knights</HI> of the three <HI>Military</HI> Orders, namely, St. <HI>James,
Calatrava,</HI> and <HI>Alcantara</HI> followed after in Cloaks all embroid∣er'd
with Gold, and their Hatts covered with Plumes of Fea∣thers;
after them went the <HI>Tutulados De Castille,</HI> and the Of∣ficers
of the <HI>Kings</HI> Houshold, they wore white Robes, and most
of them were <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> their Hatts were trim'd with
Diamonds and Pearl, and their Magnificence appeared every
way; they had most admirable Horses, every one had abun∣dance
of Liveries, and their Footmens Suits were of Gold
and Silver <HI>Brocado</HI> mixt with coloured Silk, which lookt very
well.</P>
<P>The <HI>Queen</HI> rid upon a curious Horse of <HI>Andalousia,</HI> which
the Marquess <HI>De Villa Mayna,</HI> her first Gentlemen Usher, led by
the Reins, her Cloaths were so richly embroidered, that one
could see no Stuff, she wore a Hat trim'd with a Plume of Fea∣thers,
and the Pearl called the <HI>Peregrina,</HI> which is as big as a
small Pear, and of an inestimable Value, her Hair hung loose
upon her Shoulders, and upon her Forehead, her neck was a
little bare and she wore a small <HI>Fardingal,</HI> she had upon her</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="289"/>
Every <HI>Courtier,</HI> and even the <HI>Embassadors</HI> are obliged when
they go into the King's Chamber to put on certain little Lawn
Cuffs, which they wear quite flat upon their sleeves, there are
Shops in the Guard-room, where the <HI>Lords</HI> hire them, and re∣turn
them when they come out. In like manner all the Ladies
are to wear <HI>Patins</HI> when they go into the <HI>Queens</HI> pre∣sence,
I think I have already told you that these are a kind of
<HI>Sandals</HI> into which the Shooe is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astned, and which raises them
up very high, if they should appear before the Queen without
these <HI>Sandals,</HI> she would take it very ill.</P>
<P>The Queens of <HI>Spain</HI> have none but Widows and Maids a∣bout
them, the <HI>Pallace</HI> is so full of them, that one can see no∣thing
else through the Latices and in the Balconies. And here's
one thing seems to me very singular, which is, That a Man al∣though
he be Married is allowed to declare himself a <HI>Lover</HI> or
<HI>Gallant</HI> of a <HI>Lady</HI> of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> and for her sake to commit
all the Follies and to spend all the Money he can, without being
in the least blamed for it. One shall see these <HI>Gallants</HI> in the
<HI>Court,</HI> and all the Ladies in the Windows, where 'tis their dai∣ly
Employment to discourse with, and entertain one another
by their Fingers: For you must know that their <HI>Hands</HI> speak a
Language that is perfectly intelligible; and as it might be
guest as if it was always alike, and that the same Signs always
meant the same things, so they agree with their <HI>Mistresses</HI> upon
certain private Signs and Actions, which no body else under∣stands.
This kind of <HI>Love</HI> is publick, a Man must be of a pe∣culiar
sort of Wit and Humour dextrously to manage these In∣trigues
and to be accepted by the Ladies, for they are wonder∣ful
delicate and nice, they do not talk like other People. In
the <HI>Pallace</HI> there reigns a certain Genius and Strain of Wit,
quite different from that in the City, and so peculiar, that one
must learn it as they do an Art or a Trade. When the <HI>Queen</HI>
goes abroad, all, or however the greatest part of the <HI>Ladies</HI>
go with her; then the <HI>Gallants,</HI> who are constantly upon the
Watch, go a foot by their Coach sides, that they may enjoy
their Conversation. It is really a good Sport to see how these
poor Lovers dirty themselves, for the Streets are horrid nasty;
but then, the more dirty the more gallant. When the <HI>Queen</HI>
returns home late, there are carried before the Coaches where
her <HI>Ladies</HI> are, forty or fifty <HI>Flamboys</HI> of white Wax, and this
sometimes makes a very glorious Illumination; for there are
several Coaches, in every one divers <HI>Ladies,</HI> so that fre∣quently,
one may see above a thousand <HI>Flamboys,</HI> besides
those the Queen has.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="290"/>
When the Ladies of the <HI>Pallace</HI> are let Blood, the Chyrurge∣on
takes a mighty care of the Ligature, Fillet, or any Cloth or
Handkerchief upon which any of the Blood of the fair one has
fallen; for he never fails to make a rich Present of it to the <HI>Ca∣vallero</HI>
that loves her, and this is lookt upon to be a worthy Oc∣casion
for a Man to ruine himself to all intents; there have
been some so extravagantly foolish, as to give the Chyrurgeon
a Spoon, a Fork, or a Knife, which may be the Stock of a great
many we know; no, no, I assure you, this extends to the va∣lue
of Three or four thousand Crowns, and this is a Custom
so rooted amongst them, that a Man had rather feed upon no∣thing
but Radishes and Leeks all the Year long, than not to
perform what he is obliged to do upon these sort of Occasions.</P>
<P>Few of the Ladies of the Palace leave it without being very
advantageously married; there are also the Queens <HI>Menines,</HI>
who are so very Young when they come to her, that she has
some not above six or seven Years old; these are Children of
the highest Quality. I have seen some of them more beautiful
than the <HI>God of Love</HI> himself was ever painted.</P>
<P>On some solemn Days, when the Ladies of the <HI>Pallace</HI> go a∣broad,
or when the Queen gives Audience, every Lady has the
Priviledge to place by her sides two <HI>Cavalleros</HI> who put on their
Hats before their <HI>Majesties,</HI> although they be not <HI>Grandees</HI> of
<HI>Spain;</HI> they are called <HI>Embevecidos,</HI> that is, <HI>Drunk with Love,</HI>
and so transported with their Passion, and the Pleasure of being
near their <HI>Mistresses,</HI> that they are uncapable of minding any
thing else, they are permitted to be cover'd for the same Reason
that mad Men are, who understand not their Obligation to De∣cency
and good Manners, but yet to enjoy this Liberty, they must
have leave from their Ladies, otherwise they dare not presume
to attempt it.</P>
<P>There is no other Diversion at Court, than Plays; but during
the Carnaval, they empty Eggs by a little hole in the Shell,
and fill them full of sweet scented Water, and
then stop them up again with Wax, and when the King is at
a Play, he throws these at every body, and every one in imita∣tion
of his Majesty throw them likewise at one another; this
perfumed Rain makes the Air very sweet, but withal wets People
pretty handsomly, and this is one of their greatest Pastimes,
there's hardly any body at this season but what carries a hun∣dred
of these Egg-shells, that are either filled with Orange flow∣er,
or some other sweet scented Water, and as they go along in
their Coaches throw them in Folks Faces: At this time the Peo∣ple
also please themselves after their fashion; for example,
<PB N="286" REF="291"/>
they'll break off the neck of a Bottle, and tye the part that is
within the Wicker to the Tail of a Dog, and sometimes you
shall see above two thousand run after him.</P>
<P>The King's Dwarf is the prettiest that ever I saw, his Name
is <HI>Lovisillo;</HI> he was born in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he is extream little, and
exactly well proportion'd, he has a handsome Face, an admira∣ble
Complexion, and not only wittier than one can imagine, but
withal very wise and knowing. When he goes to take the Air,
there's a Groom to wait on him, who rides upon one Horse, and
carries another before him, which is so very small, that he may
properly be termed a <HI>Dwarf</HI> Horse, and is as handsome for his
kind as his Master is for his. This Horse is brought to the
Place where <HI>Lovisillo</HI> is to mount him, for he would be almost
tyred if he was to walk so far; and it is really a great pleasure
to see the Dexterity of this little Animal and his Master, when
he orders him like a managed Horse. I do assure you that when
he is upon his Back, they do not both make above three quar∣ters
of an Ell in height. He said very seriously t'other day,
that he would fight the Bull at the first <HI>Bull Feast,</HI> for the sake
of his Mistress <HI>Donna Elvire.</HI> This is a little Girl about seven
or eight years of Age, but wonderful beautiful. The Queen
commanded him to be her Gallant. It is a great Happiness for
this Child that she is fallen into the Queens hands. I'll tell
you how it happened.</P>
<P>The Fathers of Mercy went to redeem a certain number of
Slaves which they brought to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and according to their
Custom of coming through the City in Procession, the Queen
chanced to cast her Eyes upon a Captive Woman which led two
little Girls by the hand, they seemed to be Sisters, but there was
this difference between them, that one was extream handsome,
and the other as ugly. The Queen made her come to her, and
asked her if she was the Mother of those two Children; she
answered that she was Mother only to the ugly one. And how
came you by the other, said the Queen? Madam, reply'd the
Woman, we were in a Vessel in which there was a great Lady big
with Child, but we did not know who she was only by her At∣tendance
and the Richness of her Cloaths, it was easie to think
she must be of Quality. After a long and sharp fight we were
taken, the greatest part of her People were killed, and she was
so frighted, that she fell in Travail, and as soon as she was de∣livered
dyed. I was by her, and seeing this poor little Creature
without a Nurse and ready to perish, I resolved to nourish it up
with my own, if 'twas possible. As soon as the <HI>Corsaire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> were
Masters of our Ship, they divided the booty amongst them∣selves;
<PB N="287" REF="292"/>
they were in two Vessels, and so each took away with
them the Lot that was fallen to them. Those remaining Women,
and other Servants which belonged to this Lady were on one
side of the Vessel, and I on the other; so that, Madam, conti∣nued
the Woman, I was never able to learn what or who the
Person was, whose Child I saved. I now look upon her as my
own Daughter, and she believes I am her Mother. So charita∣ble
a Deed, says the Queen, shall not go unrewarded; I shall
take care of you, and the little <HI>Incognito</HI> I will keep. And in∣deed
the Queen loves it so extreamly, that the Girl always
wears very rich Cloaths. She follows her Majesty every where,
and talks to her with that grace and freedom as sufficiently de∣clares
her to be of no mean Original. Perhaps time may disco∣ver
who she is.</P>
<P>Here are none of those solemn and pleasant Festivals which
are at <HI>Versailles,</HI> when the Ladies have the honour to eat with
their Majesties. All is very reserved in this Court, and in my
Opinion, nothing but a general and constant habit could pre∣vent
abundance of things from being extream tedious to them.
Those Ladies which do not actually dwell at Court, never come
to it, but when the Queen sends for them, and she is not allow'd
to send for them often neither. She lives for the most part with∣out
any other Company than her Women, there was never any
Life more melancholy than hers.</P>
<P>When she goes a hunting (and you must know, that of all
the Queens that have reigned in <HI>Spain,</HI> she's the first that has had
this Liberty) and is come to the place appointed for mounting on
Horseback, she must set her feet upon the Coach boot, and so
throw her self upon her Horse. It is not long since she had one,
that being a little shy and skittish, would start away as she leapt
upon him, and so she had a most grievous fall. When the King
is there, he assists her, but no body else dare come so near the
Queens of <HI>Spain</HI> as to touch them and help them on Horseback,
they had rather they should be hurt, and that their Lives should
be exposed to the greatest danger.</P>
<P>She has fourteen Matresses or Quilts upon her Bed; there's
neither Flocks nor Feather-beds used here, these <HI>Quilts</HI> being
made of <HI>Spanish</HI> Wool, which is the finest in the World; they
are not above three fingers thick, so that her Bed is no higher
than one of ours in <HI>France.</HI> They make these Matresses so thin
that they may the more easily be turned and removed, and in∣deed
I have observed that they keep hollower, and are not near
so hard.</P>
<P>It is the Custom▪ in <HI>Madrid,</HI> for the Master or Mistresses of
<PB N="288" REF="293"/>
the House to go before those that come to see them, they think
this is a piece of great Civility, to leave, say they, a Person in the
possession of all that is in the Room. As to the Women they do
not kiss one another in their Salutation, they only present their
hand without Glove.</P>
<P>They have another Custom, which I think odd and peculiar e∣nough,
and that is, when a Daughter has a mind to be marry'd,
and is the eldest, and has already made her choice, though both
her Father and Mother are against the Match, she need only go
to the Curate of the Parish and tell him the Matter, and the busi∣ness
is done. Immediately he takes her from her Parents House,
and either puts her into a Convent, or to some devout Lady,
where she remains for a little time; afterwards, if she perse∣veres
in her Resolution, the Father and Mother are obliged to
give her a Portion suitable to her Quality and their Estate, and
in spight of them she is marry'd. Partly upon this Account it
is, that such care is taken to keep their Daughters close, and to
let no body speak to them, and so to make it difficult for them
to take any measures for the management of an Intreague. O∣therwise,
provided the <HI>Cavallero</HI> be a Gentleman, it is suffici∣ent,
and he may marry his Mistress, though she should prove to
be the Daughter of a <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Since my being in this Country, I think I have not neglect∣ed
informing you of every thing; I will now proceed to finish
my Memoirs of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> seeing those I first sent you
please you so well. I shall send you the rest as fast as any thing
happens and offers it self, that is worth your Curiosity and no∣tice.
I do also promise you to write you that Relation you de∣sire
of me. But for all these little Trifles, I must beg you, dear
Cousen, to grant me something that is considerable, and that is,
the Continuation of your Friendship, for which I have a just
value.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OF THE
Present State of SPAIN,
To the Year 1700.</HEAD>
<P>YOU desired in your last some Account of the Court of
<HI>Spain,</HI> and more particularly touching the Nobility
thereof, which I shall endeavour to satisfie you in so
far as is come to my knowledge, for you must understand the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> are a proud reserv'd sort of People, with great opi∣nion
of their own, and as mean of other Nations, that makes
them very difficult of access, and so by consequence, a hard
thing for a Stranger to make that Friendship among Persons of
Quality, which is necessary for a due Information of matter
concerning Persons of the first rank, which consideration joy∣ned
to the natural jealousie, of the Men of that Country, as well
as the accustomary reservedness of the Women, makes me often
smile to hear our travelled Gallants relate their Friendship with
the Gentlemen, and Intreagues with the Ladies with so much
falshood and confidence.</P>
<P>The present King is <HI>Charles</HI> the II. the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> V.
of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> his Ancestor being born the first of that
Name: This Prince was born Sunday the sixth of <HI>November</HI> 61,
at 12 ½ at Noon, to the great joy of his Father <HI>Phillip</HI> IV.
and Mother <HI>Donna Mariana de Austria</HI> Sister of the present Em∣perour,
his Nephew the Dauphin of <HI>France</HI> being born the
first, his Father died the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November</HI> 65. The next
day the Councels went in State, and proclaimed the new King
and kist his Hand. On the 8<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November</HI> the Town of <HI>Ma∣drid</HI>
lift up the Standard for the new King, by the Hands of
<HI>Don Ramin De Gusman,</HI> Duke of <HI>Medina de los Tores,</HI> accom∣panied
by the Nobility, King at Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Having mounted
<PB N="286" REF="295"/>
a Scaffold richly covered in the great <HI>Piazza,</HI> the oldest King
of Arms having proclaimed silence three times, the Duke lifts up
the Standard crying three times (<HI>Castilla</HI> for the Catholick
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second of that name, whom God preserve)
all the People crying out <HI>Viva.</HI> They not using to Crown
their-Kings at present, a day or two after. <HI>Don Lui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de Arra∣gon</HI>
Duke of <HI>Cardonna</HI> and <HI>Segorbe,</HI> the most ancient Knight
of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> Knighted him in the presence of several
Knights of that Order, put on him the Collar of the <HI>Golden
Fleece,</HI> with the usual Ceremonies; the Princes of <HI>Astiliano
Auclino</HI> and <HI>Montalte,</HI> doing him Homage for <HI>Italy,</HI> Prince of
<HI>Barbancon</HI> for <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Ambassadour for <HI>Germany,</HI> and the
Duke of <HI>Cardonna</HI> for <HI>Spain,</HI> he remained under the Tutulage
of his Mother, till the year 1675. when he took on him the
Government; he is an easie Man, tall and thin, fair, with the
<HI>Austrian</HI> great under Lip, but of mean Capacity, and not at all
Active; which makes the <HI>Spaniards</HI> often cry out, when shall
we have a King of our own Complexion, they speak very slight∣ly
of him, as of an Innocent, but yet are very loyal, laying
all the miscarriages in the Government on the Ministers, who
are changed often enough.</P>
<P>As to the Nobility of this Kingdom, they may be divided
into the higher and lower, the former comprehending only such
as are <HI>Grandees,</HI> who are covered in Presence of the King, they
were so ordered by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, to avoid the competitions
between the great Men of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> and
in some sort to make them equal, there are said to be three
degrees of Preheminence. Herein, the First come into the
Kings presence, speak to him covered, and then put on their
Hat; the Second speak to the King, and put not on their Hat;
till the King has spoke to them; the Third speak to the King,
and stand by, till the King commands them to cover. The
Names and Titles of these <HI>Grandees,</HI> follow hereafter, in an

<P>Of these <HI>Grandees</HI> there are some more eminent than others,
that Family the Duke of <HI>Medina Celi, Don Louis de la Cerda,

may well be esteemed the first, as that by the <HI>Corda,</HI> he
is Lineally descended from the Kings of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and
by the <HI>Arragon,</HI> the Mothers Family from the Kings of <HI>Arragon,</HI>
all whose Royal ensigns he carries in his Arms: There is uni∣ted
in his Person seven <HI>Grandeesships,</HI> as enjoying the Titles and
Estates of <HI>Medina Celi, Cardonna, Segorbe, Lerma, y Alcala,</HI>
being five Dukedoms, <HI>Comares</HI> and <HI>Denia,</HI> two Marquisates,
besides a great many other Titles, which only carry the prehe∣minence
of Titles of <HI>Castile,</HI> of which we shall speak hereafter,
to these Titles he has the support of above 400000 Ducats <HI>per
Annum,</HI> above 100000 Pound <HI>Sterling,</HI> so that I doubt not,
but he may justly deserve the appellation of the most Illustrious
Subject in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<HI>Gusman</HI> Duke of <HI>Medina Sidonia</HI> was in very high esteem, till
his concern in the Revolt of <HI>Portugal</HI> from <HI>Spain,</HI> the Duke of
<HI>Braganca</HI> after King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> having married his Sister, who
were Parents of our Queen <HI>Katherine,</HI> his revenue was 100000 Du∣cats
by Customs of his Port St. <HI>Lucar,</HI> and 100000 Ducats by his
Fishery of Tunny-Fish at <HI>Cortes,</HI> 100000 Ducats by Rents of Lands,

de Olivares,</HI> and <HI>Conde de Onnate,</HI> by which last his Name is
<HI>Ladronde Guevara,</HI> and is Hereditary Postmaster General of <HI>Spain.</HI>
This Family came to their Grandeur by marriage, and being
chief Ministers to <HI>Philip</HI> IV. they are counted the richest
Subjects the King of <HI>Spain</HI> has, possessing near 120000—Du∣cats
<HI>per Annum</HI> Revenue. <HI>N.</HI> B. a Ducat is about 4 <HI>s. Sterling.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Velasco,</HI> Duke of <HI>Frias,</HI> better known by the Title of Consta∣ble
of <HI>Castile,</HI> esteemed the most Ancient, from whence that of
the Poet, <HI>Ian Hidalgo como el Rey y mas Vicio que Valasco,</HI> as much
a Gentleman as the King, and more ancient than <HI>Velasco,</HI> an Hiper∣bolical
speech to express the Antiquity of that Family. The la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
Constable being one day at Dinner with the <HI>Marquess del Prie∣go,</HI>
who is also Duke of <HI>Feria,</HI> as the custom was, the Marquess's
Cook set the last Dish on the Table, the Constable commend∣ing
his civilities, the Marquess replyed, he did well to com∣mend
him for he was of his Family, upon which the Constable
demanding his Name, which was <HI>Pedro Velasco,</HI> returned
on the Marquess. Here you see the old Proverb confirmed <HI>Ma∣jores
Pedro que su Amo, Peter,</HI> is a better Man than his Master.
The first Gentleman of the Family of <HI>Velasco;</HI> is the <HI>Marquess
del Pico,</HI> Governour of the Cittadel of <HI>Antwerp</HI> at this time.</P>
<P><HI>Henriques,</HI> Duke of <HI>Medina Riosca;</HI> better known by the
Titles of Admiral of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Mendosa,</HI> Duke of <HI>Infantado,</HI>
by that of Admiral of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and several of these are united
to other Families. The Lower Nobility of <HI>Spain,</HI> are such as
though they enjoy the Titles of Dukes, Marquesses, Princes,
Earls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet they have not the priviledge of covering in the
King's presence, and are called Titles of <HI>Castile;</HI> among which
the <HI>Grandees</HI> eldest Sons are chief. The <HI>Grandees</HI> have all the
Style of excellency; but these only of Lordship, unless other∣wise
graduated by Offices or Places; these Titles are very nu∣merous,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being very Ambitious of Honour, and
by consequence many very poor. A Friend of mine in
<HI>Sevil</HI> told me, that in one Year in that City only, they had
above 30 new Titles of Earls and Marquesses, made which
before as he told me (no Comian) did not dine, and I asking
<PB N="292" REF="301"/>
him what they did now, he made answer, <HI>que no Cenavan,</HI> (they
did not Sup,) so true it is, they will starve their own Carcas∣ses
and their Families, for an empty Title, and yet they will
have a Coach and good Cloaths whatsoever become of the
rest.</P>
<P>The Gentry are as numerous in <HI>Spain,</HI> as in any Country in
the World, and their Families are very ancient, the reason of
their preserving them so well, is that all Estates in Land are
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tailed, and cannot be alienated, but in case of failure of
Issue, and that then not without a great deal of charge and
trouble, which is the occasion that Land is so very dear, there
worth 39 to 40 years purchase. Also in every City in the Ar∣chives
they keep a register of all the Families that belong there∣to
with the Alliances they make, which are also the more neces∣sary,
because no one can be made a Knight without full proofs
of his being clear for four Generations, by Father and Mother
of the Blood of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> with whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have been very much mixed in former times, especially in <HI>An∣dalousia,</HI>
therefore Men of Estates in <HI>Spain</HI> are extream Am∣bitious
of Knighthood, because then their Blood is out of que∣stion,
and every younger Brother of a good Family, is also ve∣ry
desirous thereof; both because that Honour may maintain
him in that respect in the World, which his want of Estate
would loose, and also for that thereby they are capacitated more
readily to obtain Offices and places, Civil and Military. I have
known several made Knights, that all their Estate and Credit,
would hardly amount to make up 60 Pound, for the charge of
being invested therewith, and I remember to have seen 14
Knights in the Retinue of the Marquess of <HI>Laguna,</HI> when he
went <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> to <HI>Mexico</HI> in his Livery, so that we may well
put the Knights of <HI>Spain,</HI> into the old List of the poor Com∣panions.</P>
<P>The orders of Knighthood in <HI>Spain</HI> are these; (for that of
the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> nor that of St. <HI>John's</HI> cannot be reckoned <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Orders; the former being given only to some very great
Men▪ and that <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> as well as <HI>Spain,</HI> and is
peculiar to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> as Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and Head
of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> the last is common to all the Papist
Gentry in <HI>Europe,</HI>) therefore the <HI>Spanish</HI> Orders are St. <HI>Jago,
Calatrava,</HI> and <HI>Alcantara.</HI> There is hardly any Grandee or
Nobleman in <HI>Spain,</HI> that is not of one of these Orders, and it
is beneficial as well as honourable; they having many Commenda∣ries
belonging to them.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="302"/>
The First Order of St. <HI>Jago</HI> is the eldest, though not esteemed
the best, because they in producing the proofs of clean Blood,
pardon the quarter part on the Mothers side which the others
does not. The Habit is a long white Robe, and the Badge is
a red Dagger, which they wear wrought on their Cloaks, and
enameled on a golden Scollop Shell, which Shell you see St.
<HI>Jagos</HI> Pilgrims wear.</P>
<P>This Order hath 42 Commendaries in the Province of <HI>Castile,</HI>
and 45 in <HI>Leon,</HI> besides 10 Alcaidies and Lieutenancies.</P>
<P>The Second Order is <HI>Calatrava,</HI> whose Badge is four red
Flower de Luces Cross wise. It has 34 Commendaries, and eight
Priories.</P>
<P>The third Order is <HI>Alcantara,</HI> whose Badge is the same with
<HI>Calatrava</HI> but green. It has 33 Commendaries, four Alcaidies,
four Priories. All these Orders yields to the Possessors of the
several Commendaries, 440000 Ducats Yearly rent, besides
the Master-ships which are worth 300000 Ducats <HI>per Annum,</HI>
which are at present possessed by the King. Those Offices by the
Power and influence they have over the Knights of their several
Orders, for some time past, were thought too great for Subjects to
enjoy as formerly they did over and above these Rents the several
Orders allow all their several Knights, Professors, that have not
Commendaries, and that will demand it 120000 Marvedies a
Year for Bread and Water.</P>
<P>Further, for the employment and advancement of this nume∣rous
Nobility and Gentry, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> has to bestow
about 17000 Offices Ecclesiastical, Civil and Military, amongst
which some of the chief are, Nine Vice-Royships of <HI>Naples, Si∣cily,

<P>In <HI>Spain,</HI> in <HI>Castile</HI> alone are 5 Archbishops, 31 Bishops; the

there has entred into <HI>Spain</HI> from these parts, from the Year

which there always comes a great quantity out of Register, at

Priors, and Dignities without number, of all which the Pope
has not the spoils of the Dead, nor the Fruits of the vacant

<P>The Government of <HI>Spain</HI> by its Constitution is a limited
Monarchy, Successive in a right Line both Males and Females,
the Male Line ended in <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who united <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Arra∣gon,</HI>

the limitation of the Monarchy is by the Cortez (or Parliament)

Aldermen, or Common councils of the respective Cities, who
are Heriditary. These Deputies must bring decisive Procura∣tions

covered in the Kings presence, and sit and take an Oath of Fideli∣ty

President or Speaker, but no Act can pass without the consent of
all. If it be matter of grant to the King, and then their Votes
are cast or given privately, but if it be matters of Justice, or
private concerns which is first determined, they give their
Votes publickly, and then the Majority carries it; when any
Acts pass they carry it to the King for his consent, they are cal∣led

Council of the Chamber, and dissolved by a notefaction of the
President of the said Council: But they leave a deputation at
Court of eight Members, four for Action, and four for Absence
or Infirmities. The Cortes have never been called since the
Year 1647. when they gave the King the Millions or general
Excise, and will not be called any more, unless upon the ut∣most
exigences of Affairs, their Power being so great in
calling Ministers to account, examining into all Male administra∣tion
since their last Session. But their Acts only bind the
Kingdoms of <HI>Castile</HI> and its Dependants; that of <HI>Arragon,</HI> ha∣ving
its States and Justice apart, but are now also discontinued,
so that now the whole of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Government lies, in the
Power of the King and his several Councils, who resides at <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI>
and whose Pragmaticas or Proclamations in the Kings
Name, have the force of Laws in their several Provinces, and
are, <HI>viz.</HI> The Supream Council of <HI>Castile,</HI> the Council of <HI>Ar∣ragon,</HI>
the Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> the Council of <HI>Italy</HI> and
of <HI>Flanders,</HI> Council of the Chamberer Cabinet, which is on∣ly
the President and three or four of the Councils of <HI>Castile</HI> at
the Kings pleasure, and these are they that have the chief ma∣nagement
of all Affairs of Government, though there is also
the Council of State, which is above all in Title, though in
reality it is more for State then use. Besides these, there is the
Councils of War, of Revenues of the Inquisition, of Orders
of Knighthood, of the Crusado, which are for the Management
of these several matters.</P>
<P>The Law of the Land, where the Kings Proclamations do
not intervene; or the Despotick Power of the Inquisition is
purely Civil, where in Criminal Cases, no Man is condemned by
Witnesses alone without his own confession, which however
is extorted by Torment of the Wrack, and in Cases of <HI>Meum</HI>
and <HI>Tuum,</HI> all Suits are managed before Alcades or Judges of
the respective Towns or Cities, by way of Bill and answering
<PB N="296" REF="305"/>
writing, from which there are appeals to the Supream Courts of
Chancery at <HI>Granada, &amp;c.</HI> where there are Pleadings. But there
are a great many exemptions from the common Course of Law,
on account of Priviledges, as all Churchmen, all that belong
to the Inquisition all Soldiers, all Knights and all Persons be∣longing
to the Kings Revenue, all whom will appeal in case of
prosecution, Criminal or Civil, to their own Judges, or finally
to their respective Councils at <HI>Madrid,</HI> besides the Power of
the Church in preserving any other Person, that flyes to it
from the ordinary Justice in any Case, from whence he cannot
be taken, but by order of the Popes Nuncio or Legat, who is usual∣ly
the Archbishop of <HI>Tolleda,</HI> Primate of <HI>Spain,</HI> and generally
a Cardinal, and a <HI>Spaniard.</HI> Thus have you a brief account of
what has occurr'd to my notice touching <HI>Spain,</HI> or more pro∣perly
<HI>Castile,</HI> wherein I had my Residence some Years; but
the Government of <HI>Arragon,</HI> is or was very distinct, which I am
not acquainted withal.</P>
