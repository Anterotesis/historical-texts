<L>Present fresh Horrors to their sick'ning Eyes;</L>
<L>Trembling with Fear, the naked Bosom glows,</L>
<L>Their outward Gestures paint their inward Woes;</L>
<L>Their Conscience all its gnawing Terrors darts,</L>
<L>Intolerable Anguish wounds their Hearts:</L>

<L>On the deaf Rocks, importunately call,</L>

<L>The Mountains stand regardless to their Cries,</L>

<LG>
<L>The Trumpet sounds afresh, the Mountains bend▪</L>
<L>The Works of Ages in a Moment end:</L>
<L>Vast Sheets of red'ning Blaze refulgent play,</L>

<L>'Midst all this Wreck of Worlds; the Just, serene</L>

<L>In ev'ry Face a pale Destraction's seen,</L>

<L>Now Earth no more!—Flames (in Confusion all!)</L>
<L>Spread thro' the Whole, and revel thro' the Ball!</L>
<L>A Waste of Flames! that ever curling grow!</L>
<L>Till kindling Empires all confus'dly glow:</L>
<L>Crackles at once, the Cottage and the Dome,</L>
<L>And Dust, and Diamonds, to one Mass are run.</L>
<L>The Vallies smoak;—th' eternal Mountains bend,</L>
<L>Loud bellowing Flames, Earth's deep Foundations rend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In one red Ruin, Hills and Deserts lie,</L>
<L>Tost, thro' the Flames, Thrones, Kingdoms, Scepters fly.</L>
<L>Mixt in one Blaze, till all the Flames conspire,</L>
<L>And the whole Frame in one great Groan expire.</L>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>ET now, once more, the Muse the Scene pursue</L>
<L>And endless Scenes of Bliss or Torment view,</L>
<L>Eternal Depths! and Seas without a Shore!</L>
<L>Where Bliss runs smooth, or fiery Billows roar!</L>
<L>With chilling Horror view the Depths below,</L>
<L>And trace the Gulph of everlasting Woe.</L>
<L>Regions of Sorrow! doleful Shades! where Peace,</L>
<L>And all its balmy Comforts ever cease!</L>
<L>No Bound controuls th' unwearied Space, but Hell,</L>
<L>Endless as those dire Pains that in it dwell;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
No rosy Morn does its kind Dawn display;</L>
<L>Nor Sun auspicious glad the op'ning Day:</L>
<L>Nought there but dreary Desolation's found,</L>
<L>Intolerable Anguish stalks around.</L>
<L>Wide flames the burning Bottom of the Pool,</L>
<L>And fiery Seas of fuming Sulphur roll.</L>
<L>Here flames a Furnance, there the rattling Chain</L>
<L>Confines a Wretch to everlasting Pain.</L>
<L>These, these the Regions, where the Bad must dwell,</L>
<L>Their Bliss, their Heaven on Earth, exchang'd for Hell.</L>
<L>Each recollected Pleasure makes them smart,</L>
<L>And every Transport stabs them to the Heart.</L>
<L>Speechless and fixt in all the Depth of Woe,</L>
<L>What mingling Torments in their Bosom glow!</L>
<L>Where'er they throw their baleful Eyes around,</L>
<L>Flames roar tremendous, rattling Chains resound.</L>
<L>Flames—greedy to devour, and Chains to close</L>
<L>In endless Circuits of eternal Woes.</L>
<L>Welt'ring in Wreaths of everlasting Fire,</L>
<L>Rack'd are their Souls, nor can their Souls expire.</L>
<L>Ten Thousand Thousand Years the Torment flows,</L>
<L>And with fresh Force the fiery Furnace glows.</L>
<L>In every Soul a fiery Deluge reigns,</L>
<L>And mad'ning Fevers revel in their Veins.</L>
<L>Rack'd with Remorse! what Millions wou'd they give</L>
<L>For one Day more, one Trial more to live.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21" MS="y"/>
By Tears, and Groans, and never ceasing Care,</L>
<L>By all the pious Violence of Prayer,</L>
<L>To bid their Souls in tender Meltings flow,</L>
<L>For Scenes of by-past Sin, and present Woe;</L>
<L>Deep Anguish!—But too late, they now repent,</L>
<L>Too late bemoan their Sins, and Life mispent!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gnashing the Teeth, and rattling of the Chain,</L>
<L>Are all the Musick, to the Damn'd, in Pain.</L>
<L>Without, the Sheets of flaming Sulphur roll,</L>
<L>Within, Damnation flashes on the Soul;</L>
<L>Damnation, which Almighty Wrath inspires,</L>
<L>Daemons inflict, and Conscience feeds the Fires.</L>
<L>Thought! giddy Thought, recoiling, backward flows,</L>
<L>And leaves unfinish'd their excessive Woes.</L>
<L>Shrieks! doleful Shrieks! and Groans are heard around,</L>
<L>And Plaints in these, or Words like these, resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“Almighty Father! Heav'ns eternal Sire!</L>
<L>O hear my Prayer, from boiling Seas of Fire.</L>
<L>Oh! must my Soul, that Soul thou didst inspire!</L>
<L>And warm'd with sacred Seeds of heavenly Fire!</L>
<L>Must it be doom'd to Scenes of endless Pain,</L>
<L>To roul in Flames, and wrestle with its Chain;</L>
<L>With Fires malignant, ever to engage,</L>
<L>Powerful to bear; and satisfy their Rage?”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“When thousand Times, ten Thousand Years are run,</L>
<L>Oh! must my Sorrows still be but begun!</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
Why didst thou speak me into Misery,</L>
<L>And bad me wretched, when thou badst me be?</L>
<L>Why didst thou curse me with a second Frame,</L>
<L>Rais'd from the Grave, to everlasting Pain?”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“Dread Sire! I've sinn'd, 'tis just I feel thine Ire,</L>
<L>And breath my Groans in agonizing Fire:</L>
<L>But can't an Age of Misery attone,</L>
<L>For a few Years of Sin, so swiftly gone?</L>
<L>But oh! these Pangs! oh! must they never end?</L>
<L>Still, still endure! and Thought's last Verge transcend?</L>
<L>For ever! oh! for ever must I dwell,</L>
<L>In these dreadful Agonies of Hell?”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“But if in vain, I wish my Pangs may cease,</L>
<L>Then grant at least, one Hour, one Moment's Ease!</L>
<L>One Drop of Water to allay this Pain,</L>
<L>This mad'ning Fever in each boiling Vein!”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus they with fervent Prayer, to grant, implore</L>
<L>That they, or all their Torments, be no more.</L>
<L>In vain! o'erwhelm'd in Seas of fell Despair,</L>
<L>Excessive Agonies their Bosoms tear!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, cou'd'st thou, Caitif! brave Almighty Ire,</L>
<L>And lie content, in everlasting Fire?</L>
<L>With Fiends eternal, ever cou'dst thou dwell,</L>
<L>With all the damn'd, despairing, Souls in Hell?</L>
<L>Bear all the Woe, that centers in the Load</L>
<L>Of Wrath Almighty, and an injur'd GOD?</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23" MS="y"/>
All this, say, cou'dst thou bear?—and vastly more</L>
<L>Than Reason can, or human Thought explore?</L>
<L>No sure!—each Sense with wild Amazement's fraught,</L>
<L>And thy Blood shivers at the distant Thought.</L>
<L>Must it be so?—and shall the fading Toy,</L>
<L>The fleeting Dream of false deluding Joy:</L>
<L>The Flash of Pleasure lasting for a Day,</L>
<L>Shall these, to endless Rounds of Woe betray?</L>
<L>For these, deluded Fool, your Soul resign</L>
<L>To Flames, to Devils, and to Hell consign?</L>
<L>The Hour, the fatal Hour shall hast'ning come,</L>
<L>That shall for Ages fix the fatal Doom.</L>
<L>But Words are vain to fright; the Wretch will find</L>
<L>Hell's truer Image pictur'd in his Mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These Pangs excessive, let the Wicked view,</L>
<L>Trace ev'ry Groan, and ev'ry Shriek pursue;</L>
<L>Behold the racking Pain, the twinging Smart,</L>
<L>The bleeding Anguish of the tortur'd Heart!</L>
<L>Tremendous as they are: these Tortures view,</L>
<L>Then think ye Bad, this Hell is made for you;</L>
<L>For you the fiery Chain, and Furnace glow,</L>
<L>And all the tort'ring Ministers of Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now emergent from the Depths below,</L>
<L>Muse leave these gloomy Shades and Realms of Woe:</L>
<L>To Heaven's bright Court direct the gladn'd Wing,</L>
<L>And heavenly Glories all enraptur'd sing:</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="24"/>
With vast Delight, o'er the bright Mansions roam,</L>
<L>And raptur'd, hail the ever blissed Home.</L>
<L>How pure! how glorious all! and how divine!</L>
<L>How lovely where th' immortal Court does shine!</L>
<L>For tho' thro' all the undivided God,</L>
<L>Thro' vast Immensity diffus'd—Abroad,</L>
<L>Thro' Air, and Earth, and Seas, and the wide Ball,</L>
<L>The Universal Presence swells o'er All.</L>
<L>Yet here <HI>Jehovah</HI> all his Pomp displays,</L>
<L>And pours his Glory, one unclouded Blaze;</L>
<L>Here keeps his Court, superior and alone.</L>
<L>And Suns and Worlds the Pavement of his Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more the Sun's faint Rays the Day adorn,</L>
<L>Nor Evening Cynthia swells her Silver Horn:</L>
<L>No more the Day and Night alternate reign,</L>
<L>Nor Darkness spread o'er Heav'n her deep Domain;</L>
<L>But GOD himself shall shine eternal Day,</L>
<L>And each blest Soul drink an immortal Ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! say ye Seraphs, frequent in his Sight.</L>
<L>What Flows you feel, of ever fresh Delight!</L>
<L>For, who but you, can tell these Joys Abroad,</L>
<L>Felt from the blissful Vision of the GOD?</L>
<L>How does his Presence, cloudless, calm, impart,</L>
<L>And smile eternal Joy on every Heart!</L>
<L>To him, inraptur'd, all th' immortal Choir</L>
<L>Stretch the full Note, and strike the sounding Lyre.</L>

<PB N="23" REF="25" MS="y"/>
<L>From Age to Age, the grateful Lay prolong,</L>
<L>And in rich Consort swell th' immortal Song:</L>
<L>Bid vast Immensity his Praises sound,</L>
<L>And wond'ring Worlds thro' all their Spheres resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus they pour their Soul in ev'ry Lay,</L>
<L>Some roam Abroad and tread the milky Way;</L>
<L>Wand'ring thro' all the Mazes of the Sky,</L>
<L>And, where no Thought can reach, unbounded fly.</L>
<L>Admire the Wonders of th' Eternal round,</L>
<L>And Suns and Worlds profusely flung around;</L>
<L>Thro' all the vast Magnificence explore,</L>
<L>Infinite Depths; and Seas without a Shore!</L>
<L>Some, wrapt in Wonder, silently admire</L>
<L>Th' Almighty's Works, warm'd with celestial Fire;</L>
<L>Others, retir'd, by Contemplation's Eye,</L>
<L>Into the Depths of Fate, intensely pry:</L>
<L>At once look through, the whole, the great Design!</L>
<L>And see th'Almighty's Hand in ev'ry Line;</L>
<L>Resolve of Providence, the secret Maze!</L>
<L>And trace the pathless Wonders of his Ways;</L>
<L>See to what Point the artful Windings tend,</L>
<L>And where the regular Disorders end.</L>
<L>At once the Mists, which now surround us fly,</L>
<L>And Truth's fair Fields, unbounded, fill the Eye:</L>
<L>Congenial Ardour ev'ry Breast inspires,</L>
<L>And glows, refin'd, with Friendship's purest Fires;</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="26"/>
While Saints and Seraphs mingle Flame with Flame,</L>
<L>Mutual each Transport, and each Wish the same.</L>
<L>There Truth and Innocence for ever spring,</L>
<L>And Peace still hov'ring, spreads her candid Wing:</L>
<L>The Streams of Life from Springs perennial roll.</L>
<L>And pours the Floods of Bliss on ev'ry Soul;</L>
<L>Pleasures! that with Increase of Ages grow,</L>
<L>As Rivers roll, and widen as they flow!</L>
<L>Wide as their Wish, and spotless as their Mind,</L>
<L>Unmixt as God, and as Heav'ns Fires refin'd!</L>
<L>Eternal!—there th' audacious Thought restrain,</L>
<L>Nor pry thro' all the boundless Gulphs in vain,</L>
<L>Search back-past Records, all the Periods scan;</L>
<L>Since first shone forth the Sun, and Time began:</L>
<L>To these add Thousand Thousand Ages more,</L>
<L>Till lab'ring Fancy sinks, and Thought can grasp no more.</L>
<L>Heap Age on Age, and when the Period's run,</L>
<L>A whole Eternity is but begun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But why this Toil, to swell the tuneful Strain,</L>
<L>In Words, at best, but elegantly vain?</L>
<L>Immortal Joys o'erpower a mortal Breast</L>
<L>Too great, till felt, by Words to be exprest.</L>
