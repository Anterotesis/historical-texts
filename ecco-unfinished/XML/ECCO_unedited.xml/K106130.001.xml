<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TEN years have elapsed since I gave to the Public
a volume of Letters under the title of, “<HI>Sketches
on the Natural, Civil, and Political State of Switzer∣land.</HI>”
The favourable reception of that work in∣duced
me, in 1779, to make a journey through the
country of the Grisons, a part of Switzerland hitherto
little known. Having, in 1785 and 1787, opportu∣nities
of revisiting the same spots which I had before
described, I was anxious to revise and augment my
former publication. With this view I compared my
descriptions at the very places, which I attempted to
delineate; attentively perused the criticisms of suc∣ceeding
travellers; and in many of the principal towns,
I entreated several persons, of political or literary emi∣nence,
to correct any errors, or to suggest any improve∣ment,
with respect to those particular parts, with
which, from situation, they were most conversant.</P>
<P>THE materials collected from these and other
sources, increased by my own observations and re∣searches,
encourage me to hope, that the present im∣proved
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
account of so interesting a country as Switzerland,
will not be unacceptable to the Public, and will be
considered as a new work.</P>
<P>IT may be proper to apprise the purchasers of the
former editions, that it was my intention to have sepa∣rately
printed the corrections and additions, for their
convenience; but it is presumed, that a comparison of
the present publication with the former editions, will
sufficiently prove, that the design was impracticable.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN regard to the former publication on Switzerland, the
Author acknowledges his obligations to Colonel Floyd,
for the use of the accurate journal which he kept during
their joint tour, and to the judicious animadversions of the
elegant writer to whom these Letters are addressed. For
this improved work he holds himself no less indebted for
various communications from Thomas Pennant, Esq. and
David Pennant, Esq.; and to the kind assistance of Dr.
Pulteney, the Rev. Thomas Martyn, Professor of Botany in
the University of Cambridge, and the Rev. Richard Relhan.</P>
<P>As it was inconsistent with the nature of letters, to in∣terrupt
the reader by perpetual references to authorities, I
have subjoined, in an appendix to the second volume, a
catalogue of the principal works which I have occasionally
consulted in the course of this publication.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Doneschingen, <DATE>July 21, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now at Doneschingen, in my way towards Switzer∣land;
a country long celebrated for the peculiarities of its
different governments, and for the singular beauties con∣ferred
upon it by nature. If it will not be trespassing upon
your patience, I propose to trouble you with some account of
my tour. For I am persuaded, that I shall travel with much
greater prosit to myself; as the reflection that my observa∣tions
are to be communicated to you, will render me more
attentive and accurate in forming them.</P>
<P>WE quitted Strasburgh yesterday, and crossed the Rhine to
Kehl, formerly an important fortress belonging to Strasburgh
when an imperial city. It was also strongly fortisied by the
French, who took possession of it in 1648: being coded to
<PB N="2" REF="18"/>
the Empire at the peace of Ryswic, the Emperor consigned
it to the house of Baden, reserving, however, to himself the
right of a garrison. Since that period, it has been twice at∣tacked
by the French: and as during the last siege, in 1733,
the works were considerably damaged, the imperial garrison
has been withdrawn. At present, there are only the ruins
of the ancient fortifications; and by way of garrison, a few
invalids belonging to the Margrave of Baden. From thence
we proceeded to Offenburgh, a small imperial town; and
soon after, entered the beautiful valley of Kinsing: we passed
through Gengenbach, another small imperial town, finely
situated; and continued our journey by the side of the small
river Kinsing; rising gradually for several leagues together,
until we found ourselves in the midst of the Black Forest.
As we ascended, the country became more wild and romantic,
and the river more rapid; on each hand mountains, whose
acclivities were finely cultivated, and whose tops were richly
covered with a continual forest. Several small streams of the
clearest water rolled down the sides of the mountains, in
numberless cascades; and uniting, fell into the Kinsing.
The views were so exceedingly diversified; the villages so
delightfully situated; and the cottages so extremely pictu∣resque,
that we almost seemed to have anticipated the ro∣mantic
beauties of Switzerland.</P>
<P>DONESCHINGEN is the principal residence of the prince
of Furstenberg: in the court-yard of his palace, the Danube
takes its rise. I am this moment returned from visiting the
spot; the description of which may be comprised in a few
words. Some small springs bubbling from the ground, form
<PB N="3" REF="19"/>
a bason of clear water, of about thirty feet square: from this
bason issues the Danube, which is here only a little brook.
And though the two small rivers of Bribach and Brege,
uniting below the town, are far more considerable than this
stream, which flows into them soon after their junction; yet
the latter alone has the honour of being called the Source of
the Danube. After we had gone through the ceremony of
striding across the stream, in order to say, that we had <HI>slepped</HI>
over the Danube, we soon satisfied our curiosity; the object
itself being in no respect extraordinary, but deriving its prin∣cipal
consideration from being the source of so noble a river.
Indeed, it was this circumstance alone that induced us to
enter Switzerland by the way of Suabia.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE>
very affectionately Yours,</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER 2.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ARRIVAL IN SWITZERLAND—SCHAFFHAUSEN—FALL OF THE RHINE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Schaffhausen, <DATE>July 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I FEEL great delight in breathing the air of liberty; every
person here has apparently the mien of content and satis∣faction.
The cleanliness of the houses, and of the people, is
peculiarly striking; and I can trace in all their manners,
behaviour, and dress, some strong outlines, which distinguish
this happy people from the neighbouring nations. Perhaps
it may be prejudice and unreasonable partiality; but I am the
more pleased, because their first appearance reminds me of
my own countrymen, and I could almost think, for a mo∣ment,
that I am in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On again entering Schaffhausen, the 18th of July, 1786, I was not so much struck with its neatness as in 1776. The reason is obvious. In my former expe∣dition I emerged from the wilds of Suabia, on the latter occasion I had just quitted the cultivated parts of Bavaria.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SCHAFFHAUSEN, a tolerably well-built town, situated upon
the northern shore of the Rhine, is the capital of the canton,
and owes its origin to the interruption of the navigation of
that river by the cataract at Lauffen: huts being at first con∣structed
for the convenience of unloading the merchandize
from the boats, it by degrees increased to a large town.
Schaffhausen was formerly an imperial city, and governed by
<PB N="5" REF="21"/>
an aristocracy: it was mortgaged in 1330, by the Emperor
Louis of Bavaria, to the Dukes of Austria, and was released
from its dependency by the Emperor Sigismond, when Fre∣derick
Duke of Austria was put under the ban of the empire.
In 1501, it was admitted a member of the Helvetic confede∣racy;
and is the twelfth canton in rank. Of all the cantons,
it is the least in size, being only five leagues in length and
three in breadth: its population is supposed to amount to
thirty thousand souls; of which, the capital contains about
six thousand.</P>
<P>THE whole number of citizens or burgesses (in whom the
supreme power ultimately resides) is about sixteen hundred.
They are divided into twelve tribes: and from these are
elected eighty-five members, who form the great and little
council. To these two councils combined, the administra∣tion
of affairs is committed: the senate, or little council of
twenty-five, being entrusted with the executive power; and
the great council, comprising the senate, finally deciding all
appeals, and regulating the more important concerns of
government.</P>
<P>THE revenues of the state are not very considerable, as will
appear from the salary of the burgomaster, or chief of the
republic; which barely amounts of £. 150 <HI>per ann.</HI> The re∣formation
was introduced in 1529: the clergy are paid by the
state, but their income is scarcely sufficient for their main∣tenance;
the best living being only about £. 100, and the
worst £. 40 <HI>per ann.</HI> The professors of literature also, who
are taken from the clergy, are paid by government; and a
<PB N="6" REF="22"/>
school is supported at the public expence. Sumptuary laws
are in force here, as well as in most parts of Switzerland; and
no dancing is allowed, except upon particular occasions.
The principal article of exportation is wine; of which a large
quantity is made, the country abounding in vineyards: and
as the canton furnishes but little corn, it is procured from
Suabia in exchange for wine. In the town there are a few
manufactures of linen, cotton, and silk.</P>
<P>IT will perhaps give you some idea of the security of the
Swiss republics, when I inform you, that Schaffhausen,
although a frontier town, has no garrison; and that the for∣tifications
are but weak. The citizens mount guard by turns;
and the people of the canton being divided into regular com∣panies
of militia, which are exercised yearly, are always pre∣pared
to act in defence of their country. This canton has
some troops in France, Sardinia, and Holland; the only
foreign services into which the subjects of the Protestant
cantons enlist.</P>
<P>BEFORE I take leave of this town, I must not omit men∣tioning
the bridge over the Rhine; justly admired for the
singularity of its architecture. The river is extremely rapid,
and had already destroyed several stone bridges of the
strongest construction; when a carpenter of Appenzel
offered to throw a wooden bridge, of a single arch, across the
river, which is near four hundred feet wide. The magi∣strates,
however, required that it should consist of two arches,
and that he should for that purpose preserve the middle pier
of the old bridge. Accordingly, the architect was obliged
<PB N="7" REF="23"/>
to obey; but he has contrived to leave it a matter of doubt,
whether the bridge is supported by the middle pier, and
whether it would not have been equally safe if formed solely
of one arch.</P>
<P>IT is a wooden bridge, of which the sides and top are
covered, and is what the Germans call a <HI>haengewerk,</HI> or hang∣ing
bridge; the road, which is almost level, is not carried,
as usual, over the top of the arch; but, if I may use the ex∣pression,
is let into the middle of it, and there suspended.
The pier is not in a right line with the buttresses; as it
forms with them an obtuse angle pointing down the stream,
being eight feet out of the rectilinear direction. The distance
of this middle pier from the side that lies towards the town,
is a hundred and seventy-two feet, and from the opposite
bank, a hundred and ninety-three; in all, three hundred and
sixty-four feet; making in appearance two arches of a sur∣prising
width, and forming a beautiful perspective when
viewed at some distance. A man of the slightest weight feels
it almost tremble under him; yet waggons heavily laden
pass over without danger. It has been compared to a tight
rope, which trembles when struck, but still preserves its firm
and equal tension. I went under this bridge, in order to
examine the mechanism; and could not avoid being highly
pleased with the simplicity of the architecture: I was not
capable of determining whether it rests upon the middle pier,
though many judges agree that it does not.</P>
<P>ON considering the greatness of the plan, and the boldness
of the construction, it is matter of astonishment that the
<PB N="8" REF="24"/>
architect was originally a carpenter, without the least tincture
of literature, totally ignorant of mathematics, and not versed
in the theory of mechanics. The name of this extraor∣dinary
man was Ulric Grubenman, a native of Tuffen, a small
village in the canton of Appenzel. Possessed of uncommon
natural abilities, and a surprising turn for the practical
part of mechanics, he raised himself to great eminence;
and may justly be considered as one of the most inge∣nious
architects of the present century. This bridge was
finished in less than three years, and cost ninety thousand
florins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About £. 8000 sterling.—Mr. Andrae, in his Letters upon Switzerland, has given two engravings of this bridge, to which he has added a very accurate description of its mechanical construction, communicated by Mr. Jetzler of Schaffhausen. In this de∣scription he represents it as consisting of two arches, and resting upon the middle pier. Several persons well skilled in architecture, maintained a contrary opinion; and in the former editions I was induced to adopt it, for the following reasons. The architect himself constantly maintained, that the bridge was not supported by the pier; his nephew, who was employed in its construc∣tion, confirmed the same assertion; and as, at first, it did not even touch the pier, it must therefore, at that time, have been con∣sidered as forming but one arch. I must, however, candidly own, that in my subse∣quent visits to Schaffhausen in 1785 and 1786, I had reason to change my opinion. At those periods the bridge was supported on piles, in order to undergo a thorough repair. Mr. Spengler, a native of the town, and lately returned from Russia, where he had passed many years in the capacity of an architect, fortunately discovered, that much ill-seasoned wood having been employed in its construction, many of the timbers were absolutely decayed; and that one side had greatly swerved from its original direction. This ingenious artist, after having expa∣tiated on the simplicity and boldness of the design, informed me, that the bridge un∣doubtedly consists of two arches: and that although Grubenman, of whose abilities he spoke with deserved encomium, affected to place the timbers in such a manner as to resemble but one arch, and always asserted that it was not supported by the pier; yet that the whole fabric would undoubtedly have fallen if that pier had been taken away. He obligingly shewed me his plan for re∣pairing the bridge, and for strengthening it by means of additional timbers, in order to render it able to support its own weight, when the piles should be removed.—Vid. <HI>Briefe aus der Schweiz nach Hannover ges∣chrichen.</HI> Zuric, 1776.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="9" REF="26"/>
THIS morning we rode about a league, to the Fall of the
Rhine at Lauffen, a small village in the canton of Zuric. Our
route lay over the hills which form the banks of the river:
the environs are picturesque and agreeable; the river beau∣tifully
winding through the vale. Upon our arrival at
Lauffen, we dismounted; and advancing to the edge of the
precipice which overhangs the Rhine, we looked down per∣pendicularly
upon the cataract, and saw the river tumbling
over the sides of the rock with amazing violence and preci∣pitation.
From hence we descended till we were somewhat
below the upper bed of the river, and stood close to the fall;
so that I could almost have touched it with my hand. A
scaffold is erected in the very spray of this tremendous cata∣ract,
and upon the most sublime point of view:—the sea of
foam rushing down—the continual cloud of spray scattered
to a great distance, and to a considerable height—in short,
the magnificence of the whole scenery far surpassed my most
sanguine expectations, and exceeds all description. Within
an hundred feet of the scaffold, two crags rise in the middle
of the fall: the nearest is perforated by the continual action
of the river; and the water forces itself through in an ob∣lique
direction, with inexpressible fury, and an hollow sound.
After having contemplated the awful sublimity of this won∣derful
landscape, we descended; and crossed the river, which
was extremely agitated.</P>
<P>HITHERTO I had only viewed the cataract obliquely; but
here it opened by degrees, and displayed another picture,
which I enjoyed at my leisure, as I sat down upon the oppo∣site
bank. The most striking objects were, the castle of
<PB N="10" REF="27"/>
Lauffen, erected upon the very edge of the precipice, and
projecting over the river; near it, a church and some cot∣tages;
a clump of cottages close to the fall; in the back
ground, rocks, planted with vines, or tufted with hanging
woods; a beautiful little hamlet upon the summit, skirted
with trees; the great body of water, that seemed to rush out
from the bottom of the rocks; the two crags boldly advanc∣ing
their heads in the midst of the fall, and in the very
point of its steepest descent, their tops sprinkled with shrubs,
and dividing the cataract into three principal branches. The
colour of the Rhine is extremely beautiful, being of a clear
sea-green; and I could not but remark the fine effect of the
tints, when blended with the white foam in its descent.
There is a pleasing view from an iron foundery close to the
river, which is dammed up, in order to prevent its carrying
away the works and neighbouring cottages: by means of
this dam a small portion of the river is diverted, turns a mill,
and forms a little silver current, gliding down the bare rock,
and detached from the main cataract. Below the fall the
river widens considerably into a more ample bason; at the
fall, the breadth seemed to be about three hundred feet.
In regard to its perpendicular height, travellers differ: those
who are given to exaggeration compute it a hundred feet;
but I should imagine about fifty or sixty feet will be nearer the
truth. I stood for some upon the brink of the cataract; be∣held
with admiration; and listened in silence; then crossed the
river; remounted my horse; and returned to Schaffhausen.</P>
<P>SOME writers have asserted that the Rhine precipitates it∣self
in one sheet of water; and, as I before observed, from
<PB N="11" REF="28"/>
a perpendicular height of a hundred feet. In former ages
this account might be agreeable to fact; as it is probable
that the space between the banks was once a level rock, and
considerably higher; and that the river has insensibly un∣dermined
those parts, on which it broke with the utmost
violence: for, within the memory of several inhabitants of
this town, a large rock has given way, that has greatly alter∣ed
the appearance. Indeed I am convinced that the perpen∣dicular
height of the fall is diminished every year, by the
continual friction of so large and rapid a body of water; and
have no doubt but that the two crags, which now rise in the
midst of the river, will in time be undermined and carried
away. The Rhine, for some way before the fall, even near
the bridge, dashes upon a rocky bottom, and renders navi∣gation
impracticable for any kind of vessel.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ISLE OF REICHENAU—CONSTANCE—GENEVAN
ESTABLISHMENT—ISLE OF MEINAU—LAKE OF
CONSTANCE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Constance, <DATE>July 24.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY morning we quitted Schaffhausen, and
crossed the Rhine at Diessenhoffen, a small town in
Thurgau; a country dependent upon the eight antient can∣tons:
from thence to Stein the road lay by the side of that
river. Stein is an independent town under the protection of
Zuric, but governed by its own laws and magistrates. At
this place we took a boat to carry us to Constance. A little
above the town of Stein the river widens considerably, and
forms the inferior lake of Constance, or the <HI>Zeller See;</HI>
which is divided into two branches; from Stein to Constance
is about sixteen miles, and from the latter to Zell, its greatest
breadth, about ten.</P>
<P>A FINE breeze soon carried us to the island of Reichenau,
which belongs to the Bishop of Constance: it is about three
miles long, and one broad; contains about sixteen hundred
inhabitants, all Catholics; three parishes; one village; and
a rich abbey of Benedictines, of which the bishop is abbot.
The superior was exceedingly civil, and shewed us all the
relics and curiosities of the convent: among the latter was a
carious tooth of Charles Le Gros. That monarch, who was
<PB N="13" REF="30"/>
emperor and king of France, and who possessed dominions
as extensive as those of Charlemagne, lived to want the com∣mon
necessaries of life, and to depend for his subsistence
upon the charity of an archbishop of Mentz. He was pub∣licly
deposed in 887, at a meeting of the principal French,
German, and Italian barons, whom he himself had sum∣moned:
after having languished a year, in extreme want
and misery, he died at a small village near Mentz, in Ger∣many,
and his remains were conveyed to this convent. The
next remarkable curiosity, was an emerald, as it is called, of
an extraordinary size, which, according to the annals of the
convent, was a present from Charlemagne. Take its dimen∣sions,
and then judge whether it can be an emerald: it has
four unequal sides; the longest of which is near two feet,
and the broadest about nine inches; it is one inch thick, and
weighs about twenty-nine pounds. The superior valued it
at £. 4500; but if it is, as I conjecture, nothing more than a
transparent green <HI>spath-fluor,</HI> its value will be reduced to a
few shillings. Upon our return to the inn, where we dined,
we found a present from the superior, more valuable than
all the relics and curiosities of his convent—two bottles of
excellent wine, the growth of the island, which is almost a
continued vineyard.</P>
<P>IN the evening we arrived at Constance; the situation of
which upon the Rhine, between the two lakes, is most de∣lightful.
I was much affected with the solitary appearance
of a town once so flourishing in commerce, and so celebrated
in the annals of history. A dead stillness reigns through∣out;
grass grown in the principal streets; in a word, it wears
<PB N="14" REF="31"/>
the melancholy aspect of being almost totally deserted; and
scarcely contains three thousand inhabitants. This city has
endured a sad reverse of fortune: it was formerly in alliance
with Zuric and Basle; and, supported by their assistance,
had expelled the bishop, and embraced the reformation.
But the Protestant cantons being worsted in 1351; and the
league of Smalcade, of which Constance was a member, be∣ing
defeated by Charles V. the town was obliged to submit
to the emperor, and to re-admit the Catholic religion. From
this period it lost its independence; and being neglected by
the house of Austria, fell by degrees into its present almost
annihilated state; exhibiting to some of the neighbouring
Swiss cantons, an instructive contrast, which must sensibly
endear to them their own invaluable happiness, in the com∣merce
and liberties which they enjoy.</P>
<P>WE paid a visit to the chamber where the council of Con∣stance
was held in 1415, and had the honour of sitting in the
two chairs, in which sat pope John XXIII.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was deposed in this council.</NOTE> and the emperor
Sigismond; if any honour can be derived from a turbulent
ecclesiastic, and a perjured sovereign. It was by a sentence
of this council, that the celebrated reformer John Huss (hav∣ing
embraced the doctrines of our Wickliffe, and trusting to
the protection of the emperor, who violated his word) was
burnt as an heretic. The house is still shewn where he was
seized, and upon which is fixed his head, carved in stone,
but now almost defaced; with an inscription under it in
German. Jerome of Prague, his disciple, had the weakness
to recant before the same council, but this weakness was am∣ply
<PB N="15" REF="32"/>
compensated by the greatness of soul with which he again
retracted this recantation, and by the calm and intrepid mag∣nanimity
which he displayed in his last moments at the stake.
From the top of the cathedral we had a superb view of the
town, and of the two lakes; with the rugged Alps of Tyrol
and Appenzel, their tops covered with perpetual snow.</P>
<P>CONSTANCE may again become a commercial town,
through the permission granted by the emperor, to the emi∣grants
from Geneva, of settling and carrying on their trade
and manufactures, with very considerable privileges. Messrs.
Roman and Meilly, watchmakers of Geneva, were the first
persons, whom the troubles of their native republic drove to
Constance. They received from the emperor the following
immunities for themselves and countrymen.</P>
<P>THE right of purchasing or building houses; free exer∣cise
of religion, entirely independent of the Catholic clergy;
the power of erecting a tribunal for the purpose of deciding
all affairs relative to their manufactures and commerce; ex∣emption
from serving in the militia and quartering soldiers;
from all contributions during the space of twenty years;
from duties on their tools and utensils; and the standard of
the gold and silver employed in their manufactures to be in∣variably
fixed. These favourable terms, signed on the 30th
of June, 1785, attracted many settlers to Constance; and in
my second visit to this place, on the 25th of October, 1787,
the new colony of Genevans consisted of seventy families,
comprising three hundred and fifty persons; among these
<PB N="16" REF="33"/>
were fifty-four watchmakers, who had introduced the dif∣ferent
branches of manufacture which belong to their trade.
Four hundred watches were already finished, and above
fourteen hundred more were preparing. The emperor has
also granted to Mr. Macaire the convent of Dominicans lately
secularized, towards establishing a manufacture of printed
linens and cottons. The refectory is appropriated for the
chapel of the new colony.</P>
<P>I DID not omit visiting a small dungeon, about eight feet
long, six broad, and seven high, in which John Huss was
confined, and wherein I observed the very stone to which he
had been chained. I entered it however with very different
sensations from those which I experienced in 1776, when
this convent was the asylum of monkish superstition. It is
now the seat of trade and industry: and it must suggest a
pleasing reflection to a philosophic mind, that a successor of
Sigismond, who violated his word, should have consigned to
a reformed establishment that very convent in which the Bo∣hemian
divine was imprisoned, and from which he was ex∣ultingly
led to the stake; and that the most enlarged princi∣ples
of toleration should be manifested in the same place,
where persecution was inculcated by precept and example.
It is the triumph of reason and religion over bigotry and in∣tolerance.</P>
<P>I AM just returned from a pleasant expedition to the small
island of Meinau, in a bay of the superior lake: this island,
about a mile in circumference, belongs to the knights of the
<PB N="17" REF="34"/>
Teutonic order. The bailiff shewed us the house of the
commander, which is prettily situated, and has a fine prospect
of the lake, but contains nothing remarkable but the cellars,
which are well stocked with wine; an article from which the
chief revenue of the commandery arises. Our good friend
the bailiff was very free in offering it; and we, not to appear
insensible of his civility, were constrained to taste several
different sorts, which he successively presented, always prais∣ing
the last as the oldest and most exquisite. The wine was
indeed excellent, the glasses large, and a most formidable
row of enormous casks still remained untasted; so that, after
having duly extolled several specimens, we found it expe∣dient
to decline the farther solicitations of our generous
host: for, had we performed the whole ceremony, we must
have taken up our abode in the castle for the night.</P>
<P><DATE>July 25.</DATE></P>
<P>WE set sail about two hours ago from Constance. This
superior lake, or, as it is sometimes called, the <HI>Boden See,</HI> is
about fifteen leagues in length and six in its greatest breadth:
it is one of the great boundaries that separate Switzerland
from Germany. The borders on each side consist of gently
rising hills; on the left hand Suabia, and on the right Thur∣gau,
with a variety of scattered towns, villages, and monas∣teries:
the form of the lake inclines to an oval, and the
water is of a greenish hue. I am now writing aboard the
vessel; and have been for some time in vain attempting to
distinguish (what some travellers have assirmed to be dis∣cernable)
the waters of the Rhine from those of the lake;
though indeed I was before almost convinced of the impos∣sibility.
<PB N="18" REF="35"/>
For the river in its course from the superior lake,
being exactly of the same beautiful greenish colour as the
inferior lake into which it flows; it is evident that the one
can never be distinguished from the other. Probably, upon
its first entrance into the superior lake it is troubled, and
consequently, for some way, its current may easily be traced:
but it purifies by degrees, and becomes an indistinct part of
the great body of water.</P>
<P>THIS lake, like all the other lakes of Switzerland, is con∣siderably
deeper in summer than in winter; a circumstance
owing to the first melting of the snow from the neighbour∣ing
mountains: it abounds in fish of various sorts. Yester∣day
evening, in our expedition to Meinau, there was scarcely
a breeze stirring, and the lake was as smooth as chrystal; a
brisk gale has now raised a fine curl upon the surface; and
the surrounding landscape forms an assemblage of the most
beautiful objects. In short, the several views which present
themselves are so truly enchanting, as to make me regret
every moment that my eyes are called off from the delight∣ful
scenes. You will not wonder, therefore, if I am tempted
to bid you adieu somewhat abruptly.</P>
<CLOSER>Yours, &amp;c.</CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>P. S. The following description of the great trout, which
frequents all the Swiss lakes, but more particularly abounds
in the lake of Constance, was communicated by Thomas
Pennant, Esq. This species of trout is called in this neigh∣bourhood
<HI>Illankin,</HI> and by Linnaeus, <HI>Salmo Lacustris.</HI> The
<PB N="19" REF="36"/>
head is conical, and larger in proportion than that of a sal∣mon.
The dorsal fin has twelve rays; pectoral, fourteen;
ventral and anal, twelve each. The under jaw, in full-grown
fish, ends in a blunt hook. The colour, as low as the lateral
line, of a deep blue, brightening as it approaches the line;
beneath that, of a silvery white; all the upper part is spotted
irregularly with black. This kind grows to the weight of
forty or forty-five pounds.</P>
<P>THESE fishes quit the deeps of the lake in April, and go
up the Rhine to deposit their spawn. The inhabitants of
the shores form wears across the river, in which they take
them in their passage. They are also caught in nets. The
fishery lasts from May to September; the fishermen avoid
taking any on the return, as they are then very lean and
quite exhausted. In spring and summer their flesh is of a
fine red, and very delicate; but after they have spawned, it
turns white and becomes very indifferent. They feed on
fish, worms, and insects; and are particularly destructive to
the graylings. Their great enemy is the Pike, which will
attack an Illankin four times as large as itself. For a fur∣ther
account, the reader may consult the elegant Icthyolo∣gie
by Mr. Block, vol. iii. p. 155, who is the first naturalist that
has given satisfactory account of this gigantic species</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 4.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ST. GALLEN—CANTON OF APPENZEL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>July 26.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I WRITE to you from the midst of the Alps, under the
shade of a grove of beeches, while a clear stream of wa∣ter,
flowing at my feet, forms a natural cascade down the
rock. I have just made a hearty meal upon some bread and
cheese; which I found to be a most delicious repast, after
walking six miles over the mountains of Appenzel.</P>
<P>WE this day quitted St. Gallen, and walked to Appenzel.
The country is singularly wild and romantic; consisting of a
continued series of hills and dales, vallies and mountains, the
tops of which are crowned with most luxuriant pastures. I
could not have conceived it possible, without having been
an eye-witness, that any district within the same compass
could have exhibited so numerous a population; the hills
and vales being thickly strewed with hamlets, scattered at
small distances from each other. The picturesque moun∣tains,
the forests, the currents which we crossed, over bridges
resembling those I have observed in some of the best land∣scapes,
added to the beauty of the scenes, and diversisied
every step with the most pleasing objects. After having re∣posed
for a short time in this delightful spot, I cannot em∣ploy
myself more to my satisfaction than by continuing my
journal.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="38"/>
IN my last letter I took my leave of you upon the lake of
Constance: we landed at Roshach, a small burgh in the do∣minions
of the abbot of St. Gallen, agreeably situated in the
midst of a bay at the edge of the lake, and at the bottom of
a rising hill, richly covered with wood and pasturages. From
Roshach we went to St. Gallen, the whole territory whereof
does not exceed a mile and a half in circumference; and in∣cluding
the town contains near eight thousand inhabitants.
There every thing was alive; all persons wore the appear∣ance
of industry and activity; exhibiting a striking opposi∣tion
to Constance, which we had just quitted.</P>
<P>THE abbot and town of St. Gallen are both allies of the
Swiss cantons, and each enjoys the privilege of sending de∣puties
to the general diet. The abbot of St. Gallen is titular
prince of the German empire, and is chosen by the seventy-two
Benedictines, who compose this chapter. He formerly
possessed the sovereignty of the town; but the inhabitants
shook off his authority, and became independent: and the
various disputes which, since that period, have arisen be∣tween
the two rival parties, have been compromised by the
interposition of the Swiss cantons. The town is entirely
Protestant, and its government aristo-democratical: the sub∣jects
of the abbot (whose territory is very extensive) are
mostly Catholics. It is remarkable, that the abbey in which
the prince resides, is situated close to the town, and in the
midst of its territory; as the town is also entirely surrounded
by the possessions of the prince.</P>
<P>ST. GALLEN owes its flourishing state to the uncommon
industry of the inhabitants, and to a very extensive com∣merce,
<PB N="22" REF="39"/>
arising chiefly from its manufactures of linen, muslin,
and embroidery. In a place so entirely commercial, I was
astonished to find the arts and sciences cultivated, and litera∣ture
in the highest esteem. In the library there are thirteen
volumes in folio, containing manuscript letters of the first
German and Swiss reformers. Luther ends a letter to Me∣lancthon
as follows:
<Q>Pestis eram vivus, moriens ero mors tua, Papa.</Q>
These letters would probably throw much light on the history
of the reformation.</P>
<P>THE library belonging to the abbey is very numerous and
well arranged; and, among a number of monkish manu∣scripts,
contains several of the classic writers, which engaged
my chief attention. To this library we owe Petronius Ar∣biter,
Silius Italicus, Valerius Flaccus, and Quintilian, copies
of which were found in 1413: it was formerly very rich in
curious manuscripts; but several being borrowed, during
the council of Constance, by the cardinals and bishops, were
never returned.</P>
<P>THE transition from the abbot of St. Gallen to the canton
of Appenzel will not appear abrupt, as Appenzel once be∣longed
to the abbot: the inhabitants, however, being loaded
with exorbitant and oppressive taxes, revolted in 1400; and
maintained their independence with the desperate courage
of a spirited people, who sight for their liberties. In 1452
they entered into a perpetual alliance with some of the neigh∣bouring
Swiss republics; and in 1513 were admitted into the
<PB N="23" REF="40"/>
Helvetic confederacy: they hold the last rank among the
thirteen cantons.</P>
<P>BEFORE the reformation the whole canton was under
one government; but since that period, part of the inhabi∣tants
having embraced the Protestant religion, and the other
part continuing Catholics, violent disputes were kindled be∣tween
them; which, after much contest, were at length
compromised. By an agreement in 1597, the canton was
divided into two portions; <HI>Rhodes Exterior,</HI> and <HI>Rhodes In∣terior:</HI>
it was stipulated, that the former should be appro∣priated
to the Protestants, and the latter to the Catholics.
Accordingly the two parties finally separated, and formed
two republics; their government, police, and finances, being
totally independent of each other. Each district sends a de∣puty
to the general diet: the whole canton, however, has
but one vote, and loses its suffrage if the two parties are not
unanimous. In both divisions the sovereign power is vested
in the people at large; every male, who is past sixteen, hav∣ing
a vote in their general assembly, held yearly for the crea∣tion
of their magistrates and the purposes of legislation: and
each voter is obliged to appear armed on that particular oc∣casion.
The Landamman is the first magistrate: in each
district there are two, who administer the office alternately,
and are confirmed yearly. They have each a council, which
possesses jurisdiction in civil and criminal causes, has the care
of the police, the management of the finances, and the ge∣neral
administration of affairs. The Landamman regent
presides; and the other, during the year in which he is out
of office, is banneret of chief of the militia.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="41"/>
THE <HI>Rhodes Exterior</HI> is much larger, and more peopled
in proportion, than the <HI>Interior;</HI> and the Protestants are in
general more commercial and industrious than the Catho∣lics.—The
Protestants are supposed to amount to thirty-seven
thousand; the Catholics to twelve thousand: an extraordi∣nary
number in so small a canton, entirely mountainous, and
of which a great part consists of barren and inaccessible rocks.
But the industry of the inhabitants amply compensates for
any disadvantages of soil: for, the people are frugal and labo∣rious;
their property is secured; and they are exempted
from all burdensome and arbitrary taxes. These circum∣stances,
joined to the right of partaking of the legislation,
and of electing their magistrates, inspire them with such ani∣mated
sentiments of their own importance and independence,
as excite the most active and vigorous industry: and those
necessaries, to which this industry is not sufficient, are abun∣dantly
supplied by their neighbours, in exchange for manu∣factures
and other articles of domestic commerce. The chief
part of the habitable country consists of rich pastures; and
of course their principal exports are cattle and hides, toge∣ther
with cheese and butter. Their manufactures are coarse
callicots and muslins in great quantities, which are entirely
made in the houses of the inhabitants. The cotton is spun
with the common wheel. The web is bleached at home;
and afterwards sent to be printed in the neighbourhood of
Neuchatel. The greatest bleachery I saw in the Alps was
near Appenzel, which extended over three or four acres of
ground. Part of the river Sitler is diverted to turn the mill,
which is of the simplest construction. A large wheel on the
outside works a long cylinder within; on which are sixed a
<PB N="25" REF="42"/>
number of cogs to raise the hammers which beat the webs.
In the same place are the boilers and other conveniences for
the business. The only water-mills for spinning cotton which
I saw in Switzerland, were near Neuchatel and Geneva; but
greatly inferior in size and ingenuity of machinery to those
of England. The flourishing state of the cotton manufac∣tory
has rendered many persons in the Protestant districts
easy in their circumstances, and even wealthy; if wealth is
to be estimated from the general state of the natives, and not
from the comparative view of distant and greater opulence
in large commercial cities. The villages of Trogen and Un∣devil
announce, by their superior neatness, the well-being
of their inhabitants.</P>
<P>THIS canton contains no enclosed towns, but only two or
three open burghs, of which Appenzel is the largest in the
Catholic, Trogen, Undevil, and Herisau, in the Protestant
district, and a few villages: indeed the whole country, ex∣cept
amongst the barren rocks, is almost a continued village,
being thickly covered with excellent cottages. Each cottage
has its little territory, or a field or two of fine pasture ground,
which are frequently skirted with trees. The mountains are
for the most part beautifully wooded; and the canton is sup∣plied
with water in such abundance, that we could hardly
walk two hundred paces without seeing a spring bubble from
the ground, or a torrent rush down the sides of a rock.</P>
<P>IN our way to Appenzel, we entered several houses,
which are all built of wood; neatness and convenience being
the principal object of the owners: such a remarkable clean∣liness
<PB N="26" REF="43"/>
prevailed throughout, as afforded a most striking proof
of the general attention which the people pay to that essen∣tial
article. A continued chain of these cultivated moun∣tains,
richly clothed with wood, and thickly studded with
hamlets, which appear to have been placed by the genius of
taste in the very spots where they would form the most
striking effect, exhibit a series of landscapes inexpressibly
pleasing: it seemed as if they belonged to independent clans;
independent but social, uniting for the great purposes of le∣gislation,
and for the general preservation of their liberties.</P>
<P>AMONG the chief part of the inhabitants, the original
simplicity of the pastoral life is still preserved; and I saw se∣veral
venerable figures with long beards, that resembled the
pictures of the antient patriarchs. The natives of this can∣ton,
in common with the inhabitants of democracies, possess
a natural frankness, and peculiar tone of equality, which
arise from a consciousness of their own independence. They
also display a fund of original humour, and are remarkable
for great quickness of repartee, and rude sallies of wit,
which render their conversation extremely agreeable and in∣teresting.</P>
<P>IN our way to Appenzel we passed through Tuffen, the
birth-place of Ulric Grubenman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 8.</NOTE>: he has been dead some
years: but his abilities and his skill in practical architecture
are, if I may use the expression, hereditary in his family.
We inquired for one of the same name, who was either his
<PB N="27" REF="44"/>
brother or his nephew, whom we found at the alehouse;
his usual place of resort when he has no particular employ∣ment.
He is a heavy, coarse-looking man, dressed like a
common peasant; has a quick and penetrating eye, and a
surprising readiness of conversation. We told him that we
were Englishmen, who were making the tour of Switzer∣land;
and that we could not pass through Tuffen without
desiring to see a man who was so much celebrated for his
skill in architecture. He struck his breast, and replied in
German, “Here you see but a boor.” Upon our talking
with him about the bridge of Schaffhausen, in the building
of which he was employed, he assured us, that it does not
rest upon the middle pier, but is in reality a single arch.
Near Appenzel we observed an old man with venerable
white hair hanging over his shoulders, who looked like a
substantial farmer: he inquired with a tone of authority,
but with perfect civility, who we were; and upon our ask∣ing
the same question respecting himself, of our guide, we
were informed, that he was the <HI>Landamman,</HI> or chief of the
republic. Happy people, the nature of whose country, and
the constitution of whose government, both equally oppose
the strongest barriers against the introduction of luxury!</P>

<P>WE are this moment arrived at the village of Salets;
where we propose passing the night: while supper
is preparing, I will continue my journal. We could procure
but three horses at Appenzel, and as one of them was ap∣propriated
to the baggage, I preferred walking. After hav∣ing
traversed a league in the canton, over a continued range
of mountains, enriched with beautiful meadows, and dotted
with cottages, I arrived at its boundary; here the scene sud∣denly
changed into a wild forest of pines, without the least
appearance of any habitation. The road is scarcely more
than three feet broad; and is either paved with large uneven
pieces of rock, or formed with thick stakes laid closely toge∣ther:
but as the ground is in many parts soft, these stakes
in some places sink deeper, and form a succession of uneven
steps. The mountain by which we descended into the plain,
is very steep; which circumstance, added to the unevenness
of the stakes, makes the ascent and descent exceedingly dif∣ficult
for horses. Those who are pleased with an uniform
view, may continue in the plain; while others, who delight
in the grand and the sublime, and are struck with the wan∣tonness
of wild, uncultivated nature, will prefer this road to
the smoothest turnpike in Great Britain.</P>

I WALKED slowly on, without envying my companions
on horseback: for I could sit down upon an inviting spot,
climb to the edge of a precipice, or trace a torrent by its
sound. I descended at length into the <HI>Rheinthal,</HI> or Valley
of the Rhine; the mountains of Tyrol, which yielded nei∣ther
in height or in cragginess to those of Appenzel, rising
before me. And here I found a remarkable difference: for
although the ascending and descending was a work of some
labour; yet the variety of the scenes had given me spirits,
and I was not sensible of the least fatigue. But in the plain,
notwithstanding the scenery was still beautiful and pictu∣resque,
I saw at once the whole way stretching before me,
and had no room for fresh expectations: I was not therefore
displeased when I arrived at Oberried, after a walk of about
twelve miles, my coat slung upon my shoulder like a peri∣patetic
by profession. Here we procured a narrow cart; in
which, the roads being rough and stony, you will readily
believe we were not much at our ease. The evening how∣ever
being fine, and the moon exceedingly bright, our jour∣ney
was not altogether disagreeable; as it led us through a
delightful country abounding in vines, fruit-trees, flax, and
pasturage.</P>
<P>THE Rheinthal is a bailliage belonging to Appenzel and
the eight antient cantons, which alternately appoint a bailif.
The people are of both religions, but the Protestants are the
most numerous.</P>

<P>WE quitted Salets this morning, in the same cart in
which we arrived; and it would have afforded matter of
some speculation, to observe how we contrived to arrange
ourselves, our servants, a large Newfoundland dog, and the
baggage, in so narrow a compass: indeed we were so wedged
in, that, after we had once fixed ourselves in our several
places, it was almost impossible to stir. The day was sultry,
and the sun powerful, the road bad, and the cart went barely
at the rate of three miles an hour; but the country still con∣tinued
so picturesque and mountainous; and our attention
was so entirely engaged with the perpetual variety of objects
presented to our view, as to make us forget the inconvenien∣cies
of our equipage, and the excessive heat of the weather.
From Trivabach, a small village upon the Rhine, we walked
to Sargans, the capital of a bailliage of the same name, be∣longing
to the eight antient cantons.</P>
<P>LET me here remark, that in Switzerland there are two
sorts of bailliages: the one consisting of certain districts, into
which all the aristocratical cantons are divided; and over
these a particular officer, called a <HI>bailif,</HI> is appointed by go∣vernment,
to which he is accountable for his administra∣tion:
the other sort are the territories that do not make part
of the cantons, but are subject to two or more of them, who
by turns appoint a bailif. This officer, when not restrained
by the peculiar privilege of certain districts, has the care of
the police, jurisdiction in civil and criminal causes, with some
limitations; and enjoys a stated revenue arising in different
<PB N="31" REF="48"/>
places from various duties and taxes. In case of exaction or
mal-administration, an appeal always lies from the bailif to
the cantons, to which the bailliage belongs: and the place,
the time, and the members who receive the appeal are regu∣lated
with the utmost exactness. With respect to this of Sar∣gans,
and the others belonging to the eight antient cantons
conjointly; at the conclusion of the general diet held annu∣ally
at Frauenfield in Thurgau, the deputies of these cantons
resolve themselves into a Syndicate, examine the accounts of
the public revenues as delivered by the bailifs of the respec∣tive
districts, and receive and judge all appeals; in some cases
finally; but in the more important causes an appeal lies from
this assembly to the superior tribunal of each canton. The
theory of this institution, has a plausible appearance of im∣partiality:
but how far the practice accords with the theory,
I cannot pretend to determine. Whether a bailif, who is
guilty of extortion, is easily brought to justice, or more easily
screened? how far the members of the Syndicate are liable
to influence, or open to corruption? how far the expence of
appeals renders them in many cases impracticable to the
poorer inhabitants? are questions which cannot be answered
but by a person well informed concerning these courts of
justice.</P>
<P>WE arrived late at Wallenstadt, a town incorporated into
the bailliage of Sargans, but enjoying several distinct privi∣leges:
it derives its existence from the passage of the mer∣chandise
transported from Germany through the Grisons to
Italy. This communication occasions the frequent resort of
Italian merchants; and that language is understood by many
<PB N="32" REF="49"/>
of the inhabitants. Our landlord speaks Italian, and has
been very accurate in his answers to my questions relating
to the number of inhabitants, the government of the town,
its dependence upon the bailif, and its privileges. Nor is this
a matter of wonder: for the innkeepers in Switzerland are
mostly <HI>burghers,</HI> and are frequently members of the sove∣reign
council; and, from the very nature of their govern∣ments,
the Swiss in general are well informed of their parti∣cular
constitutions. I have also held a long conversation
with a native of Glarus, who has furnished me with much
information in relation to that canton: which we purpose
visiting to-morrow.</P>

<P>THE lake of Wallenstadt, about twelve miles in length,
and two in breadth, is entirely bounded by high mountains,
except to the east and west. From this situation, a breeze
generally blows from those two quarters, beginning at break
of day, and continuing for some hours; then changes from
west to east till sun-set: this breeze is very convenient for
the transportation of the merchandise. Sometimes however
a violent north-wind rushes down from the mountains, and
renders the navigation dangerous. We were assured by the
inhabitants, and by the waterman who rowed us from Wal∣lenstadt
to this place, that the breeze was generally constant:
but we cannot attest it from our own experience; as we set
out this morning about eight, and the wind was directly
contrary the whole way, blowing from west to east. The
weather, it is true, was heavy, overcast, and rainy, which
might cause perhaps this occasional variation.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="50"/>
THE scenery of the lake is uncommonly wild and pictu∣resque,
and affords a perpetual variety of beautiful and
romantic scenes. On the side of Glarus, the mountains
which form its borders, are chiefly cultivated; enriched with
wood or fine meadows; and studded with cottages, churches,
and small villages; the Alps of Glarus rising behind, their
tops covered with snow. On the other side, for the most
part, the rocks are grotesque, craggy, inaccessible, and per∣pendicular:
but here and there a few cultivated necks of
land are formed at the very edge of the lake, and at the
bottom of these very rocks; exhibiting a beautiful contrast
to the barrenness above and around them. Numberless
water-falls, occasioned by the melting of the snows, fall down
the sides of the mountains from a very considerable height,
and with an almost inconceivable variety; some of them
seeming to glide gently in circular directions; others forming
vast torrents, and rushing into the lake with noise and
violence: all of them changing their form and their position
as we approached or receded from them. The lake is ex∣ceedingly
clear, deep, and cold, and, as we were informed,
is never frozen.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing remarkable in this place; being a small
village situated almost upon the point where the Mat issues
from the lake of Wallenstadt: that little river is joined by
the Linth, and both united fall, under the name of Limmat,
into the lake of Zuric.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE CANTON OF GLARUS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Glarus, <DATE>July 29.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE canton of Glarus was formerly subject to the
abbess of the convent of Seckinguen in Suabia: the
people however enjoyed very considerable privileges, and a
democratical form of government, under the administration
of a mayor, appointed by the abbess, but chosen among the
inhabitants. Towards the latter end of the thirteenth
century, the emperor Rodolph I. obtained the exclusive ad∣ministration
of justice; and not long afterwards his son
Albert, having purchased the mayoralty, which had gradually
become hereditary, re-united in his person the whole civil
and judicial authority. Accordingly that prince, and his
immediate descendants the dukes of Austria, oppressed the
people, and ruled over them with an absolute sway. In 1350,
Schweitz, assisted by Zuric, Lucerne, Uri, and Underwalden,
expelled the Austrians from the canton of Glarus, and re∣established
the democracy. Glarus then entered into a per∣petual
alliance with its deliverers, and was received into the
Helvetic confederacy with some restrictions, which were not
abolished until 1450. At that time it was the sixth canton,
but is now the last in rank of the eight <HI>antient</HI> cantons, as
they are called; being so distinguished, because, from the
accession of Zug and Berne in 1352, more than a century
clapsed before a new member was admitted. These <HI>antient</HI>
<PB REF="52"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="35" REF="53"/>
cantons have also several privileges superior to the five others;
the latter having submitted to some particular restrictions,
upon their reception into the Helvetic league.</P>
<P>THE people of Glarus enjoyed their liberties unmolested
till 1388, when the Austrians made an irruption into the
canton, with a force sufficient, as they arrogantly thought,
totally to subdue it; pillaging the country, and massacring
the inhabitants. It was then that three hundred and fifty
troops of Glarus, and thirty Switzers, posted advantageously
upon the mountains, resisted the whole strength of the
Austrian army, to the number of fifteen thousand, at a village
called Naefels. In this situation the Austrians began the
attack; but were soon compelled to retreat with great pre∣cipitation,
by a shower of stones poured upon them from the
heights: in this moment of confusion, the inhabitants rushed
down upon the enemy with such fury, that they broke their
ranks; and, after an immense slaughter, forced the remainder
to retire from the canton. Such surprising victories, gained
by a handful of men against an enemy so much superior in
number (instances of which are by no means rare in the
history of Switzerland) render the wonderful combats of
Marathon and Plataea, when the Greeks repulsed the nu∣merous
hosts of the whole Persian empire, perfectly credible.
The same love of independence, the same dread of slavery,
and the same attachment to their country, animated the re∣spective
nations to the same deeds of heroism; and in both
instances victory was followed by the same glorious con∣sequences:
for the Swiss, as well as the Greeks, owe the rise
and preservation of their liberties to that magnanimous and
<PB N="36" REF="54"/>
determined valour, which prefers death to living under the
servile domination of an arbitrary despot. The people still
celebrate the anniversary of this victory, which insured their
independence: and I saw near the village of Naefels several
stones, with no other inscription than 1388: an inscription
which no more requires explanation, to an inhabitant of the
canton, than the glorious aera of 1688, to an Englishman.</P>
<P>IN the sixteenth century, the reformation was introduced
into this canton, but not exclusively: both religions are
tolerated, and the two sects live together in the greatest
harmony; an union the more remarkable, when we consider
the fatal quarrels that have been kindled in Switzerland on
account of religious tenets; and that in Appenzel the division
between the two sects is distinctly marked by their inhabiting
different districts, and living under separate governments.
In several parts of this canton, the Protestants and Catholics
successively perform service in the same church; and all the
offices of state are amicably administered by the two parties.
During the present and preceding century, the Protestants
have increased considerably in number; and their industry,
in every branch of commerce, is greatly superior: an evident
proof how much the tenets of the Roman Catholic church
fetter the genius, and depress the powers of exertion.</P>
<P>THE government is entirely democratical: every person at
the age of sixteen has a vote in the <HI>Landsgemeind,</HI> or general
assembly, which is annually held in an open plain. This
assembly ratifies new laws, lays contributions, enters into
alliances, declares war, and makes peace. The <HI>Landamman</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="55"/>
is the chief of the republic, and is chosen alternately from
the two sects; with this difference, that the <HI>Protestant</HI> remains
three years in office, the <HI>Catholic</HI> only two. The manner of
election is as follows: five candidates chosen by the people
draw lots for the charge. The other great officers of state,
and the bailiffs, are taken also by lot from a certain number
of candidates proposed by the people. The executive power
is vested in the council of regency, composed of forty-eight
Protestants, and fifteen Catholics: each sect has its particular
court of justice; and it is necessary, that in all law-suits
between two persons of different religions, the person having
the casting voice among the five or nine judges, who are to
determine the cause, should be of the same religion as the
defendant.</P>
<P>CATTLE, cheese, and butter, constitute the principal com∣merce
of the canton. The cattle are fed in summer upon
the Alps: and it is computed, that ten thousand head of
large cattle, and four thousand sheep, are pastured during
that season upon the mountains belonging to the canton.
The inhabitants also manufacture linen and muslins.</P>
<P>AMONG the exports a considerable article is slate; with
which the canton abounds. The principal quarry is in the
valley of Sernft, where large slates are dug up that serve for
tables. These quarries, as I am informed by Mr. David
Pennant, once furnished Great Britain with slates for writing,
or accomptants slates; but this trade is entirely lost. Of late
they have been prepared from the great slate quarries in
Caernarvonshire, the property of Lord Penryn; and with
<PB N="38" REF="56"/>
such success, as bids fair to extend this article of commerce
over most part of Europe.</P>
<P><DATE>July 30th.</DATE></P>
<P>I AM just returned to Glarus, after having made an ex∣cursion
towards the extremity of the canton: it is entirely
enclosed by the alps, except towards the north; and there is
no other entrance but through this opening, which lies
between the lake of Wallenstadt and the mountains sepa∣rating
this canton from that of Schweitz. Passengers indeed
may in summer traverse these alps to the Grisons on one
side, and to Uri on the other: but these paths are in winter
absolutely impracticable. At the entrance above-mentioned,
the canton reaches, from the banks of the Linth to the
farthest extremity of its alps, about thirty miles; forming a
valley, which becomes narrower as you advance, and is
scarcely more than a musket-shot in breadth at the burgh of
Glarus. It afterwards opens by degrees; and about a league
from Glarus, is divided by the Freyberg mountains: at the
point of this division the two rivers, Linth and Sernft,
unite.</P>
<P>WE continued through the largest of these vallies, which,
though very narrow, is exceedingly populous. You have
been at Matlock in Derbyshire, and I remember your admi∣ration
of its beautiful and romantic situation: the scenery of
this valley is of the same cast, but infinitely more picturesque,
more wild, more varied, and more sublime. The Linth is
much broader and more rapid than the Derwent; and the
hillocks of the Peake are mere mole-hills to the alps of
<PB N="39" REF="57"/>
Glarus. These stupendous chains of rocks are absolutely
perpendicular, approach one another so near and are so high,
that the sun may be said to set, even in summer, at four in
the afternoon. On each side are numbers of those water∣falls
we so much admired during our passage over the lake
of Wallenstadt; one in particular, near the village of Ruti,
foamed down the steep sides of a mountain, from the midst
of a hanging grove of trees. I was so captivated with these
enchanting scenes, that I could not help stopping every
moment to admire them: and our guide, not conceiving it
possible, that these delays could be owing to any other cause
than the laziness of the horse, never failed to strike the poor
beast; and continually awakened me out of my rapturous
contemplations; and it was some time before I could make
him comprehend, that I stopped by choice, and wished to
continue my own pace. After having rode about ten miles,
we quitted our horses and walked. Near Leugelbach, a con∣siderable
rivulet is formed by two streams bursting from the
ground at the foot of a mountain, which after a few paces
unite, and fall into the Linth: beside these two principal
branches, several smaller springs, and numberless little foun∣tains,
gush from the rock.—The clearness of the streams;
their rapidity and murmuring sound; the trees that hang
over the point from whence they issue; the rude rocks above;
the rich meadows and scattered hamlets—all together form
an assemblage of the most lively and pleasing objects that
ever entered into a beautiful landscape.</P>
<P>I AM informed by David Pennant, Esq. that Salmons
force their way annually from the sea as high as this river,
<PB N="40" REF="58"/>
to deposit their spawn. Their progress is up the Rhine, and
out of that noble river up the Aar, and through the lake of
Zuric into the Linth; a course of many hundred miles.
They are taken in these distant parts in September and
October, and about the size of seventeen or twenty pounds
weight.</P>
<P>WE crossed the Linth several times, which rushes with
all the violence of a torrent; and came at length to an am∣phitheatre
of mountains, where the valley ended: on our
right-hand a torrent more considerable than any we had yet
seen, tumbling perpendicularly over a bare rock in a large
body of water; the alps on each side crowned with inac∣cessible
forests, and covered with everlasting snow; before
us a pyramidical mountain, bare and craggy; and the glaciers
of Glarus closing the view. Here the valley, and the ha∣bitable
part of the canton terminate. We then quitted the
plain, and ascending through a wild forest of beech and pines,
continued more than an hour mounting a very steep and
rugged path, till we came to the Panten-Bruck, a bridge
over the cataract that forms the Linth, which is here called
the Sand-bach: it roars from the glacier down the steep
mountain in one unbroken fall; and, a little way before its
arrival under the bridge, works itself a subterraneous passage
through the rock, where it is lost only to appear again with
increased violence. The bridge is a single arch of stone,
about seventy feet in length, thrown over a precipice more
than three hundred feet in depth. It serves as a communica∣tion
with the upper alps, and is the passage for the cattle which
are fed there during the summer months; on the other side
<PB N="41" REF="59"/>
some goats came jumping around us, and seemed to welcome
us to their dreary habitations. These mountains are covered
with a great variety of rare plants, which made me regret,
that I had not pursued my botanical studies. As I leaned
upon the parapet of the bridge, and looked down into the
chasm, my head almost turned giddy with the height. The
rock, down which the Sand-bach drives, is composed of slate.
After we had continued some time admiring the sublime
horror of the scenery, we descended into the valley, and
made a hearty meal upon some excellent bread, honey,
butter, and milk, which a neighbouring cottage supplied.
As the canton almost entirely consists of rich meadows, the
milk and butter are delicious; and the honey of these moun∣tainous
countries is most exquisite. Nothing delights me
so much as the inside of a Swiss cottage: all those I have
hitherto visited, convey the liveliest image of cleanliness,
ease, and simplicity; and cannot but strongly impress upon
the observer a most pleasing conviction of the peasant's
happiness.</P>
<P>IF I had never seen these little democratical states, I could
have formed no idea of the general equality and indistinction
that prevails among the inhabitants. All the houses, like
those of Appenzel, are built of wood; large, solid, and com∣pact,
with great penthouse roofs that hang very low, and
extend beyond the area of the foundation. This peculiar
structure is of use to keep off the snow; and, from its
singularity, accords surprisingly with the beautiful wild∣ness
of the country. The houses of the richer inhabitants
<PB N="42" REF="60"/>
in the principal burghs, are of the same materials: the only
difference consists in their being larger.</P>
<P>IF that sort of government be confessedly the best, which
constitutes the greatest good of the greatest number in the
community; these little states, notwithstanding the natural
defects of a democratical constitution, may justly claim a large
share of our approbation. General liberty, general indepen∣dence,
and an exemption from arbitrary taxes, are blessings
which amply compensate for a want of those refinements
that are introduced by opulence and luxury. But it is only
in these small republics, and in such a state of society, that
this kind of general democracy can have place. Although
the machine of government is considerably clogged by the
variety of wheels required to put it into motion; yet it is
not necessary that its decisions should be sudden and expe∣ditious:
for, as there is no fear of an invasion, and as the
people have no conquests either to make or to defend; their
principal policy consists in maintaining their independence,
and in preserving the public tranquillity. The police is well
regulated throughout Switzerland; and even in these demo∣cratical
states, liberty does not often degenerate into licen∣tiousness:
we may except, perhaps, the day of their general
assemblies, when it is impossible to prevent some degree of
confusion in a meeting where there is scarcely any distinction
of persons; and where every peasant considers himself as
equal to the first magistrate.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="61"/>
OUR host is an open-hearted, honest Swiss: he brings his
pint of wine, sits down to table with us, and chats without
the least ceremony. There is a certain forwardness of this
kind which is insupportable when it apparently is the effect
of impertinent curiosity, or fawning officiousness; but the
present instance of frank familiarity, arising from a mind
conscious of natural equality, and unconstrained by arbitrary
distinctions, is highly pleasing; as the simple demeanour of
unsophisticated nature is far preferable to the false refine∣ments
of artificial manners.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE ABBEY OF EINSIDLIN—RAPPERSCHWYL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Einsidlin, <DATE>July 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE could not pass through this part of the country,
without making a pilgrimage to Einsidlin, and
paying our respects to this celebrated shrine: an object of
much devotion among the Catholics. Einsidlin, or <HI>Notre
Dame des Hermites,</HI> is a rich and magnificent abbey of Bene∣dictines
in the canton of Schweitz, which owes its celebrity to
the miraculous image, as it is called, of the Virgin Mary.
The ridiculous tales they relate of the origin and aggran∣dizement
of this abbey, are so many melancholy instances of
the credulity of the darker ages: that they are still believed
in the present enlightened century, must be attributed to
the force of habitual prejudice; and at the same time proves,
how difficult it is for the human mind to shake off those
superstitutious errors, which it has early imbibed under the
name of religion.</P>
<P>IN the ninth century a certain hermit called Meinrad,
was the first who retired to this place, where he built a
chapel, and was assassinated by robbers. But shall I tell you,
or (what is more to the purpose) will you believe me if I tell
you, that this murder was discovered by two crows, who fol∣lowed
the assassins to Zuric, where they were seized and exe∣cuted?
<PB N="45" REF="63"/>
Soon after, the dead body of St. Meinrad of course
works miracles; and all the world pilgrimises to his bones.
The sanctity of this place being thus established, some one
(for whether it were St. Benno or St. Eberhard, or what
other saint I cannot precisely determine) constructed another
chapel, which he dedicated to the Virgin, and laid the first
foundation of the abbey; having bequeathed for that purpose
his whole fortune: and the pious fund was soon considerably
augmented by subsequent donations. Shall I tell you also,
that in 948, Conrad, bishop of Constance, as he was going to
consecrate the chapel, heard a voice from heaven, assuring
him, that God himself had consecrated it? Whatever was
its origin, and whoever was its founder; crouds of pilgrims
resort hither from all quarters to adore the Virgin, and to
present their offerings: and it is computed, that upon the
most moderate calculation, their number amounts yearly to
100,000. The circumjacent country was formerly a conti∣nued
forest, which since the foundation of the abbey has been
gradually converted into rich pastures and beautiful mea∣dows:
and this is a miracle which the Virgin, in a certain
sense, may be truly said to have performed.</P>
<P><DATE>August 1.</DATE></P>
<P>I HAVE just been visiting the abbey, the chapel of the
Virgin, and her immense treasures. The church of the
abbey is a large and magnificent building, but exhibits a re∣markable
specimen of false taste, by being loaded with bad
paintings, and superfluous ornaments. In the aile not far
from the entrance, is a small and clegant marble chapel of
the Corinthian order: this is the celebrated shrine of the
<PB N="46" REF="64"/>
Virgin, to which the pilgrims resort. On the outside an
angel supports the following inscription:
<Q>Hic est plena remissio peccatorum omnium a culpâ et poenâ.</Q>
Over the door is a plate of silver with five holes, into which
I saw several persons thrusting their fingers, and praying at
the same time with great fervour: upon inquiry I found,
that the credulous people believed these holes to be the marks
of God's fingers. In the inside of this chapel is the image of
the Virgin, which vies with the Lady of Loretto in <HI>beauty</HI> of
countenance; her face, as well as that of the child she holds
in her arms, being black. She is richly apparelled, and
changes her garment every week; her wardrobe consisting
of fifty-two different suits.</P>
<P>THE riches of the treasury are immense; containing
numberless offerings of gold, silver, and precious stones,
arranged in the most ridiculous manner; skulls and bones
sumptuously ornamented; whole skeletons of saints in mas∣querade,
and of ladies with ruffles, fly-caps, and splendid ap∣parel
as if dressed for a ball. What a wretched insult upon
poor human nature! I could not help considering them
with a mixture of pity and indignation, as the offerings of ig∣norance
before the shrine of bigotry and superstition. The
miracles which the Virgin has wrought in this country are
infinite, if we may judge from the numerous figures of ears,
eyes, legs, arms, heads, &amp;c. presented by those, who fancied
themselves respectively cured in those several members, by
the power of this wonder-working image.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="65"/>
I WAS glad however to find, in the midst of this super∣stitious
trumpery, a good library, which contained some fine
editions of the classics.</P>
<P>IN this place there is a considerable traffic in rosaries,
crosses, and little images; and there are rows of shops, where
nothing is to be purchased but these necessary appendages of
the Roman Catholic religion: it has all the appearance of a
fair. There is also a room in the abbey, where the same
kind of merchandise is exposed to sale; and one of the friars
attends to receive your money, and very gravely assures you,
that the several articles have touched the sacred image.
Among other curiosities of this kind, I purchased two rib∣bands,
for two-pence each, with the following inscription
upon them: <HI>Ce Ruban entier, est la longueur; jusqu'au trait
est l'epaisseur, de l'image de Notre Dame des Hermites. Il a
touché l'image miraculeuse.</HI> This abbey is very rich, and
has considerable revenues in the canton of Zuric. The
abbot, who is titular prince of the German empire, is elected
by sixty Benedictines, that form the chapter.</P>
<P>AS I walked to this celebrated convent, I found the whole
way furnished with stalls provided with cakes, whey, and
other refreshments for the numerous pilgrims then on their
road. I saw several hundreds, in groups of different num∣bers.
Some consisted of a whole parish, attended by their
spiritual pastor. More than once, I observed some grievous
sinner driven from the flock, and walking at a distance
counting his beads, bare-footed and bare-headed, doing full
penance for his crimes. I also saw several bevies of merry
<PB N="48" REF="66"/>
damsels, who seemed to enjoy the pilgrimage as much as
Welsh lasses relish a wake. They often turned into the
little chapels which lay open on the way, and wantonly
sprinkled each other with holy water. This day's journey

<P>THE evening, yesterday, being fine and cool, I walked
from Einsidlin to this place. After we had ascended about
three miles, a view of the lake of Zuric, and of the adjacent
country, opened upon us at once. The prospect was ex∣tensive
and beautiful: the solemn stillness of the evening, the
calmness of the lake, and the tints of the setting sun, which
glowed around the horizon, very much improved its charms.
When we arrived at the lake, the moon began to rise; and
throwing its beams across the water, formed another scene,
more mild indeed, but not less affecting. We then crossed
the bridge of Rapperschwyl, built over the narrowest part of
the lake: it measured near 1700 paces. The town is plea∣santly
situated upon a neck of land or promontory. It for∣merly
threw itself under the protection of Uri, Schweitz,
Underwalden, and Glarus, with a reserve of all its privileges:
but these cantons shamefully oppressing the inhabitants, and
<PB N="49" REF="67"/>
encroaching upon their liberties; Zuric and Berne took pos∣session
of the town in 1712, and restored its antient immuni∣ties.
From that period Rapperschwyl has continued under
the protection of Zuric, Berne, and Glarus; the latter having
preserved its right by its neutrality. By this treaty the
town having recovered its former prerogatives, the inhabi∣tants,
in testimony of their gratitude, placed the following
inscription over the gates: <HI>Amicis Tutoribus floret libertas.</HI></P>
<P>THIS small republic is governed by a great and little
council, consisting of forty-eight members. The town con∣tains
two hundred burghers, and about a thousand inhabi∣tants,
all Catholics. Its territory is about a league in cir∣cumference,
and comprehends three parishes.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY we dined luxuriously with the Capuchin
friars at Rapperschwyl, who seldom treat their guests
in so sumptuous a manner. It was one of their great feast-days;
and they regaled us with every variety of fish, with
which the lake and the neighbouring rivers abound. The
convent stands upon the edge of the water, and commands
an agreeable prospect: the library is by far the pleasantest
apartment, though not the most frequented. The cells of
the monks are small, and yet not inconvenient; but cleanli∣ness
does not seem to constitute any part of their moral or
religious observances. Indeed the very habit of the order
is ill calculated for that purpose, as they wear no shirt or
stockings, and are clothed in a coarse kind of brown drugget
robe, which trails upon the ground. Strange idea of sanctity!
as if dirt could be acceptable to the Deity. I reflected with
particular satisfaction, that I was not born a member of the
Roman Catholic church; as perhaps the commands of a
parent, a sudden disappointment, or a momentary sit of
enthusiasm, might have sent me to a convent of Capuchins,
and have wedded me to dirt and superstition for life.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner we took leave of our hosts, and departed
for Zuric by water: the lake is near ten leagues in length,
<PB N="51" REF="69"/>
and one in breadth. This body of water is of an oblong
form, and not near so large as that of Constance; but the
borders are studded more thickly with villages and towns.
The adjacent country is finely cultivated and well peopled;
and the southern part of the lake appears bounded with the
high stupendous mountains of Schweitz and Glarus: the
scenery is picturesque, lively, and diversified.</P>
<P>ZURIC was formerly an imperial city, and obtained from
the emperor Frederic II. very considerable privileges; which
were acknowledged and augmented by several of his suc∣cessors.
The civil war between the magistrates and the peo∣ple,
in 1335, nearly reduced the city to ruins; but the magi∣strates
being banished, the citizens, in 1337, established a new
form of government, which was confirmed by the emperor
Louis of Bavaria. The exiles, after several fruitless attempts,
were at length re-admitted; but, engaging in a conspiracy
against the citizens, were discovered and put to death. In
consequence of this transaction, the nobles in the neighbour∣hood
took up arms; and Zuric, after having ineffectually ap∣plied
for assistance to the emperor Charles IV. formed an alli∣ance
with Lucerne, Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, and was
admitted a member of their confederacy. This event hap∣pened
in the year 1351. The four cantons yielded the pre-emi∣nence
to Zuric: a privilege it enjoys at present; being the first
canton in rank, and the most considerable in extent both of
territory and power next to Berne. In the same year Zuric
was assisted by the four cantons against Albert duke of
Austria, who besieged the town, and was repulsed with great
loss.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="70"/>
ZURIC was the first town in Switzerland, that separated
from the church of Rome; being converted by the arguments
of Zuingle. Of all the reformers (the mild and elegant
Melancthon alone excepted) Zuingle seems to merit peculiar
esteem: he possessed, to a great degree, that spirit of meek∣ness,
moderation, and charity, which are the characteristics
of true Christianity; and, amid all the disputes between the
Lutherans and the reformed churches, was a constant advocate
for peace and reconciliation. He appears to have been as
perfectly free, as well from that narrow bigotry which makes
no distinction between points of the merest indifference, and
objects of the greatest importance; as from that overbearing
pride, which, while it violently condemns the opinions of
others, assumes to itself infallibility with respect to its own.
In a word, it was his persuasion, that, provided Christians
agree in the most essential articles; they ought meekly to
bear with any difference upon subjects less uncontrovertible,
and which do not necessarily influence morals.</P>
<P>ULRIC Zuingle was born Jan. 1, 1484, at Wildhausen, a
small village in the Tockenburgh; and, in the twentieth
year of his age, was appointed minister of Glarus. Even
before the publication of the sale of indulgences by Leo X.
which was the more immediate cause of the reformation▪
Zuingle had exposed at Glarus several superstitions of the
church of Rome; and had gained additional credit, by preach∣ing
at Einsidlin against vows, pilgrimages, and offerings.
After the publication of the sale of indulgences; while Luther
was undermining the fabric of papal authority in Germany,
Zuingle was no less successful in Switzerland. By his zeal
<PB N="53" REF="71"/>
and intrepidity, and by the irresistible force of truth, he
gained so many converts at Zuric (where he had been invited
to preach) that in 1524 the magistrates abolished the mass,
and other Catholic ceremonies, and introduced the reformed
religion. Zuingle had taken such wise precautions, and
acted with such extreme moderation, that the disputes
between the two sects were carried on with more temper
than is usual in religious controversies. The change, which
had been some time in agitation, was finally determined by
a plurality of voices in the sovereign council; and the people
readily and cheerfully obeyed the decision of their magistrates.
The example of Zuric was soon followed by Berne, Schaff∣hausen,
Basle, with part of Glarus and Appenzel; the other
cantons continuing to adhere to the religion of their an∣cestors.
From this period the two persuasions have been
established in Switzerland; but that harmony, which had
hitherto subsisted between the cantons, has been occasionally
interrupted. In 1531, religious disputes broke out with so
much violence, as to occasion a civil war; in which the Pro∣testants
were defeated, and Zuingle lost his life, in the forty-eighth
year of his age, at the battle of Cappel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been urged against Zuingle, as a proof of his persecuting principles, that he was personally engaged in this war against the Catholics. To this it may be answered, That he had used every argument in his power to reconcile the contending parties; that he even openly arraigned the impatient and turbulent zeal of his fellow-citizens; that he acted in obedience to one of the fundamental laws of the republic; and that he accompanied the army by the express command of the magistrates.</NOTE>. Since that
period two other religious wars have been kindled; one in
1656, in which the Catholics gained the advantage; and the
other in 1712, when the Protestants proved victorious. The
peace of Arau, which terminated these unhappy disputes,
<PB N="54" REF="72"/>
has, it is to be hoped, finally composed all religious animosi∣ties.
By that treaty, which may be considered as a code of
toleration among the Swiss; the treatment of the Protestants
and Catholics in the common bailliages, is regulated. The
first article stipulates, that in all the provinces, which are
subject to cantons of different religion, there shall be a
perfect equality between the two sects, and that they shall
both enjoy the same privileges: to which is added an ex∣press
prohibition to each party, not to use any terms of
raillery or contempt, in speaking of their respective modes
of worship.</P>
<P>THE canton of Zuric abounds in corn, wine, and excellent
pasture. The proportion of grain to the other productions
of the earth, will appear from the following calculation.
There are 217,424<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of 36,000 square feet each.</NOTE> acres tilled, 14,466 in vines, 94,553 in
meadows, 42,549 in pasturage, and 103,772 in forest.</P>
<P>As sufficient corn is not produced for the interior con∣sumption,
the deficiency is chiefly supplied from Suabia. In
order to prevent a scarcity of this material article, a public
granary is maintained at the expence of government. The
grain is retailed at the common price; but, in seasons of
scarcity, is sold considerably cheaper than it can be purchased
at the market. The good effects of this establishment ap∣peared
at the dearth in 1771; when, on account of the dear∣ness
of corn, a pound of bread was sold for ten pence, the
same quantity was delivered by government for four pence.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="73"/>
THE wine made in the canton forms an inconsiderable
object of foreign commerce; the greatest part being con∣sumed
in the country. In 1779 were exported 10,029 casks,
each containing 180 bottles; in 1781, 24,568, and in 1782,
11,354.</P>
<P>THE canton contained, in 1784, 174,572 souls, including
10,500 in the capital. This large population, in proportion
to the size of the canton, is owing to the trade of Zuric; as
at least two thirds of the inhabitants derive their livelihood
by spinning thread and silk, and making linen for the ma∣nufactures
of the town.</P>
<P>THE sovereign power resides exclusively in the burgesses
of the town, consisting of about two thousand. Here I can∣not
but remark, that a very narrow spirit of policy reigns
throughout most of the states in Switzerland; as they seldom
confer the burghership. This rule, however, in some of
the republics is less scrupulously observed than in others.
But in Zuric a new citizen has not been admitted during these
last hundred and fifty years.</P>
<P>IT is curious to trace the restrictions which have been
gradually laid on granting the burghership. On the 26th of
May, 1540, the Sovereign Council issued a decree, importing,
that whosoever was desirous of becoming a citizen, should
be obliged to produce a certificate of good behaviour, pro∣perly
witnessed and signed, and bearing the seal of the ma∣gistrates
of the place in which he formerly resided; and
should, before he was enrolled among the burghers, pay ten
<PB N="56" REF="74"/>
florins, near £. 1, if a native of Switzerland, and double that
sum if a stranger. An inhabitant of the town or canton was
taxed only at three florins for his admission; and all artists and
persons of learning, necessary or useful to the state, were to
be received gratis. In 1549, it was enacted, that the burgh∣ership
should be refused to all who were not possessed of
considerable riches, or who did not introduce new arts and
trades. This decree was repeatedly confirmed; and, in 1593,
it was added, that a new citizen should not be entitled to a
share in the government but on the following conditions. If
an inhabitant of the canton, he must have resided in the
town during ten years; if a native of Switzerland, twenty;
if a foreigner, forty; and that he must build or purchase a
house within the walls of Zuric: this last article was repealed
in 1612. In 1597, the reception of new citizens was delayed
for the first time, but only for two years; and in 1610, the
admission-money was augmented. In the commencement
of the 17th century, government refused to receive into the
Sovereign Council the noble families of Orel, Peffaluzz, and
Muralt; which, in 1555 and 1557, had quitted Italy and
settled at Zuric: these families, partly on account of having
embraced the reformed religion, and partly as persons of ca∣pacity
and industry, had been received into the burghership,
but rendered incapable of enjoying a share in the administra∣tion
of affairs. This exclusion, again confirmed in 1592, was
revoked in 1673, in favour only of the family of Muralt,
which exception was obtained by considerable largesses. In
1674, the family of Orel offered to disburse ten thousand
florins towards the expence of repairing the fortifications, on
condition of being rendered capable of election into the
<PB N="57" REF="75"/>
Sovereign Council: their petition was then refused, but
generously granted in 1679, without the smallest equivalent.
Finally, on the 7th of January, 1661, the Council determined
to make no more burghers; which resolution has been in∣variably
followed.</P>
<P>THE burghers, beside the advantage of electing their ma∣gistrates,
and of aspiring to the administration of affairs, enjoy
the sole right of commerce; all strangers, and even subjects,
being excluded from establishing manufactures in the city,
or in any part of the canton.</P>
<P>THE burghers of Zuric, are divided into thirteen tribes;
one of which is called <HI>Constaffel,</HI> or the tribe of nobles, al∣though
at present not absolutely confined to persons of that
description: it enjoys the privilege of giving eighteen mem∣bers
to the Sovereign Council, and six to the Senate, whereas
each of the other tribes only supply twelve to the former,
and six to the latter.</P>
<P>THE legislative authority is vested by the burghers, in
the Sovereign Council of two hundred; consisting, however,
of two hundred and twelve members drawn from the thir∣teen
tribes, and comprising the Senate or Little Council.
This<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Formerly the Senate was separated into two equal divisions, which alternately admi∣nistered the office during six months; and although these divisions still continue, yet, for some time past, they have re-united and acted together.</NOTE> Senate, composed of fifty members, including the two
burgomasters, has jurisdiction in all causes civil and criminal:
in civil cases, when the demand is of a certain importance, an
<PB N="58" REF="76"/>
appeal lies to the Council of two hundred; but in criminal
affairs, their sentence is final, and, when once passed, there
is no possibility of obtaining any reversal or mitigation. An
excellent maxim! provided the judges are cautious and cir∣cumspect,
and the laws mild: for there is no greater encou∣ragement
to the commission of crimes, than the frequency of
pardons. Such an institution, however, ought necessarily to
exclude severity of punishment; and could never be admit∣ted
in a state, where by the letter of the law the same punish∣ment
is inflicted upon a sheep-stealer as upon a parricide.</P>
<P>IT is to be regretted, that in this republic, as in most other
states of Switzerland, there is no precise code of criminal law.
The Caroline, or code of Charles V. is ostensibly followed;
but on account of its obsolete usages and extreme severity,
the sentence is ultimately left to the discretion of the magi∣strates.
For notwithstanding the most perfect integrity, and
upright intentions, yet it is hardly possible to suppose, that
party, friendship, connections, and family, should not fre∣quently
influence the judges and occasion partial proceedings.
It would perhaps well become the wisdom of this enlightened
and equitable government, to form a penal code, and to as∣certain,
with precision, the punishment for each offence.
The example of such a republic would in time be followed
by the remaining cantons and states of Switzerland; and
posterity would bless the name of Zuric for having occasioned
the introduction of more settled principles in the criminal
courts of justice. Some late decisions have rendered this
arrangement more obviously necessary. Several persons dis∣ordered
in their understandings committed suicide; and,
<PB N="59" REF="77"/>
although the circumstances of the crime were nearly similar,
yet the most opposite sentences were pronounced on these
occasions: so that the families of those, to whom a greater
degree of severity was shewn, were necessarily more distressed
on account of the mildness manifested to the others. Every
judge of delicacy and honour would undoubtedly experience
great satisfaction, to find himself restrained by precise laws
from listening to solicitations from friends and party, and
from being biassed by those feelings, of which it is almost
impossible to be divested.</P>
<P>THE power of the Senate, considered in a collective capa∣city,
is very considerable: it judges finally in all criminal
causes, has the care of the police, and supplies the principal
magistrates. But, as too great a power of individuals is
dangerous in a republic; the members of this assembly are
liable to be changed: and a revision or confirmation is an∣nually
made, in some instances by the Sovereign Council, in
others by the particular tribes to which the senators belong.
This annual revision is a great check to mal-administration;
and at the same time prevents the Senate from gaining so
great an influence, as to be detrimental to the liberties of the
people. A burgher is qualified to vote at twenty; is eligible
into the Sovereign Council at thirty; and into the Senate at
thirty-five. By these wise regulations, a man must have
formed some experience in public affairs, before he is capable
of holding an important charge. The revenues of govern∣ment,
though not exceeding £. 65,000 <HI>per ann.</HI> are more than
proportionate to the expences; which are regulated with the
strictest oeconomy. The state is not only without debts, but
<PB N="60" REF="78"/>
an annual saving is deposited in the public treasury, for a
resort upon any sudden emergency. From this fund go∣vernment
supported the whole expence of the war, in 1712,
against the Catholic cantons, without imposing any additional
tax.</P>
<P>THE canton of Zuric is divided into districts or bailliages,
which are governed by bailifs nominated by the Sovereign
Council. These bailifs, excepting those of Kyburgh and
Groningen, cannot pass capital sentence, or order torture.
They can arrest and interrogate the delinquent, and punish
small misdemeanors by whipping, or banishment from the
bailliage. In capital cases, they examine, make out the verbal
process, and send the felon to Zuric for further trial. On in∣quiring
into the state of criminal jurisprudence, I learned
with satisfaction, that the question had not been inflicted in
the capital for these last nine years, which may be presumed
to be a prelude to its total abolition; but it is much to be re∣gretted,
that whipping, which is a species of torture, is not
unfrequently applied, in order to force confession, both in
Zuric and in the bailliages; an abuse of justice repugnant to
the wisdom of so enlightened a government.</P>
<P>THE city of Zuric stands at the northern extremity of the
lake, and occupies both sides of the rapid and transparent
Limmat. Its environs are extremely delightful; an amphi∣theatre
of hills gradually sloping to the borders of the water,
enriched with pasture and vines; dotted with innumerable
villas, cottages, and hamlets; and backed on the west by the
Utliberg, a bold and gloomy ridge stretching towards the
<PB N="61" REF="79"/>
Albis, and that chain of mountains which rises gradually to
the Alps.</P>
<P>THE town is divided into two parts; the old part, sur∣rounded
with the same antient battlements and towers which
existed in the thirteenth century, and the suburbs, which
are strengthened by fortifications in the modern style, but
too extensive. The ditches, instead of being full of stagnant
water, are mostly supplied with running streams. The
public walk is pleasantly situated in a lawn, at the junction of
the Limmat and the Sil, an impetuous and turbid torrent,
which descends from the mountains of Einsidlin: two rows
of lime-trees planted by the side of the Limmat, and follow∣ing
its serpentine direction, afford an agreeable shade in the
heat of summer. The inhabitants are very industrious; and
carry on with success several manufactures: the principal are
those of linens and cottons, muslins, and silk-handkerchiefs.
The manufacturers do not in general dwell within the walls;
but the materials are mostly prepared, and the work is com∣pleted
in the adjacent districts. For this reason Zuric does
not exhibit the activity and numbers of a great commercial
city. The environs, on the contrary, are so extremely po∣pulous,
that perhaps few districts in the neighbourhood of a
town, whose population scarcely exceeds ten thousand inha∣bitants,
contain within so small a compass so many souls. The
streets are mostly narrow; the houses and public buildings
accord more with plainness and convenience, than with the
elegance and splendour of a capital.</P>
<P>THE town contained in 1780, 10,559 souls, in the following
proportions; 2583 male burghers, 3464 female burghers: 860
<PB N="62" REF="80"/>
foreign clerks, 250 foreigners; 372 male inhabitants, 444 fe∣male
inhabitants; 223 men-servants, 1734 maid-servants;
and 629 patients in the hospital. The gradual decrease of
the population in the town, which arises from the difficulty
of obtaining the burghership, will appear from the following
table.</P>

</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>THE increase of luxury and opulence will appear from
considering, that in 1357, the number of men-servants
amounted to only 84, and of maid-servants to 263; whereas
in 1780, the former were 223, and the latter 1734; or near a
fifth of the whole population.</P>
<P>THE manners of the inhabitants are in general simple,
and may perhaps in these times be esteemed antiquated.
Dinner is usually served at twelve: in the afternoon the
gentlemen assemble in clubs or small societies, in the town
during winter, and at their respective villas in summer.
They frequently smoke, and partake of wine, fruit, cakes,
and other refreshments. The women, for the most part
employed in their domestic occupations, or devoted to the
improvement of their children, are not fond of visiting.
When they go out, they generally assemble in separate
coteries, to which only a few men, and those chiefly the
<PB N="63" REF="81"/>
nearest relations, are admitted: many of the ladies indeed,
from a consciousness of their provincial accent, and a diffi∣culty
of expressing themselves in French, seldom make their
appearance when strangers are received. It has more than
once happened to me, that on being shewn into the apart∣ment
wherein the ladies were assembled, the master of the
house has taken me by the hand, and led me into another
room, where he would have detained me, if I had not re∣quested
to be reconducted to the ladies. This reserve, how∣ever,
among the ladies begins greatly to abate, and to give
place to a more sociable intercourse. Such, however, is the
prevalence of national habit, that a few families, which form
a more agreeable mixture of company, are considered as
differing from the established customs, and are still known
by the name of the <HI>French Society.</HI></P>
<P>SUMPTUARY laws, as well as those against immorality,
are here well enforced. The former indeed may exist, and
be carried into execution even among a people much cor∣rupted;
for it may be the policy of government to enforce
their observance. But the severest penalties will not be suf∣ficient
to prevent crimes of an immoral tendency, amidst a
general dissoluteness of manners: the popular principles can
alone invigorate such laws, and give to them their full opera∣tion.
Secret crimes cannot be prevented; but it is an
evident proof of public virtue, when open breaches of mo∣rality
are discountenanced. Among their sumptuary laws,
the use of a carriage in the town is prohibited to all sorts of
persons except strangers: and it is almost inconceivable that,
in a place so commercial and wealthy, luxury should so
little prevail.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="82"/>
AT Zuric the original Swiss spirit of independence pre∣vails
more than in any of the large towns in this country.
The magistrates, less influenced by foreign courts, and above
corruption, generally consult the real advantage of their
canton, and of the Helvetic confederacy. Zuric still preserves
in the general diet a very considerable sway; which she
derives more from the opinion entertained of her integrity,
than from her power: she is looked up to as one of the
most independent and upright of the thirteen cantons.</P>
<P>THE militia of the canton amounted, in 1781, to 25,718
infantry, 1025 artillery, 886 dragoons, and 406 chasseurs; in all
28,235 effective men. There is a military chest at Zuric,
established in 1683, and supported by the members of the
great council, who, instead of giving an expensive enter∣tainment,
are bound on their election or farther promotion
to pay a certain sum. From this fund, which has been
considerably augmented, £. 2000 was taken, in 1770, for the
purpose of establishing a magazine of uniforms and arms,
which are either distributed, or sold at a low price to the
poor peasants who cannot afford to purchase them at their
full value; each peasant, according to the military laws of
the canton, being obliged to be provided with arms and an
uniform.</P>
<P>THE arsenal is well supplied with cannon, arms, and am∣munition;
and contains a reserve of muskets for thirty thou∣sand
men. We saw there, and admired, the two-handed
swords and weighty armour of the old Swiss warriors; and
the bow and arrow with which William Tell is said to have
shot the apple placed on the head of his son. This canton
<PB N="65" REF="83"/>
has a regiment and some companies in the service of France,
a regiment in that of Holland, and some companies in the
service of the king of Sardinia. The king of France pays
annually for a regiment of fusiliers, consisting of 1292 men,
£. 20,348. The colonel receives about £. 840 <HI>per ann.</HI> a
captain £. 360: and a common soldier £. 7. The pay of a
regiment of twelve companies, in the Dutch service, is
£. 25,377.</P>

<P>IN ecclesiastical affairs the Senate is supreme: the canton
is divided into fourteen districts, each governed by a
dean, chosen by the synod, from three candidates proposed
by the clergy of the diocese. The synod, composed of the
whole clergy, and several assessors on the part of the Little
Council, meets twice a year. In the last century it had a
more democratical form, and exercised jurisdiction over its
members: it examined causes between ecclesiastics, and be∣tween
the ministers and their parishioners; gave decisions;
enjoyed the power of imprisoning, deposing, and reinstating
the ministers; and exercised an authority dangerous to the
state. By degrees their exorbitant prerogatives were an∣nulled;
and, in 1700, the clergy of Zuric succeeded in the
establishment of a more aristocratical form.</P>
<P>THE principal ministers and professors in the town con∣stitute,
in conjunction with several magistrates and other
assessors deputed by the civil power, an ecclesiastical and
academical council: to this committee the deans have re∣course,
in all concerns which seem to exceed their jurisdic∣tion:
it determines lesser affairs, and refers cases of impor∣tance
<PB N="67" REF="85"/>
to the Senate. The fourteen deans assemble twice a
year in Zuric, and compose a <HI>prosynode;</HI> in which they
depute one of their own body to deliver their requisitions,
or <HI>pia desideria,</HI> first to the Ecclesiastical Council, and after∣wards
to the General Synod. The Ecclesiastical Council takes
their requests into deliberation, lays them before the Synod,
and if recommended, they are presented by the assessors to
the final decision of the Senate.</P>
<P>THE ecclesiastical benefices in this canton are extremely
moderate. The best living may be worth £. 140 <HI>per ann.</HI>
and the worst about £. 30. The salary of the canonries in
the capital amount to £. 120. But in general, a clergyman
of the town, who has merit, is certain of obtaining a pro∣fessorship,
which adds £. 50 or £. 60 <HI>per ann.</HI> to his other
appointments.</P>
<P>THE charitable establishments at Zuric, are the orphan∣house,
which is regulated with great attention and care; an
alms-house for poor burghers; an hospital for incurables,
and that for the sick of all nations, which usually contains
between six or seven hundred patients; and the <HI>Allmosen-Amt,</HI>
or foundation for the poor: this excellent institution
puts out children as apprentices; and distributes money,
clothes, and books of devotion to poor persons, as well in the
town as in different parts of the canton, at the recommen∣dation
of the respective ministers. In 1697 it distributed
£. 300; in 1760, £. 5010; in 1770, £. 4796; and in 1778,
£. 5451.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="86"/>
AMONG the particular institutions must not be omitted the
chirurgical seminary: it is formed by voluntary subscriptions,
and chiefly supported by Dr. Rhan, an eminent physician,
who reads lectures gratis, and gives the profits of a publi∣cation,
called the <HI>Magazine of Health,</HI> towards maintaining
this seminary, for the instruction of young physicians and
surgeons, destined to settle in the country.</P>
<P>AT Zuric public education is a state concern, and under
the immediate protection of government. The office of a
professor gives rank and estimation, and is often held by a
member of the Senate and of the Great Council. The prin∣cipal
literary establishments for the instruction of youth are,
the Caroline College for students in divinity; <HI>Collegium
Humanitatis,</HI> or the college for polite literature; and the
school of arts: the first has twelve professors, the second
two, and the last seven. The learned languages, divinity,
natural history, mathematics, and in short every species of
polite learning, as well as abstruse science, is taught at a small
expence in these respective seminaries.</P>
<P>IN consequence of the unremitted attention which, since
the reformation, government has paid to the education of
youth, many eminent persons have flourished in all branches
of literature; and there is no town in Switzerland, where
letters are more encouraged, or where they have been cul∣tivated
with greater success. A learned professor of Zuric
has, in a very interesting publication, displayed the impor∣tant
services which erudition and science have derived from
the labours of his countrymen. In these biographical
<PB N="69" REF="87"/>
memoirs appear, among many others, the names of Zuingle
and Bullinger, Conrad Gesner, Hottinger, Simler, Spon,
Scheutzer, Heydegger, Breitinger, Bodmer, Hertzel, and
Solomon Gesner.</P>
<P>OF all the luminaries which Zuric, fertile in great ge∣niuses,
has ever produced, Conrad Gesner perhaps occupies
the first place. He was born at Zuric in 1516, and died in
1564, in the 48th year of his age. Those who are con∣versant
with the works of this great scholar and naturalist,
cannot repress their wonder and admiration at the amplitude
of his knowledge in every species of erudition, and the
variety of his discoveries in natural history, which was his
peculiar delight. Their wonder and admiration is still further
augmented, when they consider the gross ignorance of the
age which he helped to enlighten, and the scanty succours
he possessed to aid him in thus extending the bounds of
knowledge; that he composed his works, and made those
discoveries which would have done honour to the most en∣lightened
period, under the complicated evils of poverty,
sickness, and domestic uneasiness. A detail of his life and
writings, by an author capable of appreciating his multi∣farious
knowledge, would be a just tribute to the merits of
this prodigy of learning (<HI>Monstrum Eruditionis</HI>) as he is
emphatically stiled by Boerhaave.</P>
<P>BODMER, born in 1698, was alive in 1776, when I first
visited Switzerland; but I was at that time ignorant of the
German language, and unacquainted with his great merits in
reforming the taste of his contemporaries, and familiarizing
<PB N="70" REF="88"/>
them to the sublime beauties of Homer and Milton. He
died in 1783. I now regret that I did not cultivate the ac∣quaintance
of a man, whom the unanimous voice of his con∣temporaries
deservedly styles the Father of German litera∣ture;
whose just criticisms and correct judgment animated
the poetical genius of Clopstock, Haller, and Gesner.</P>
<P>I DID not, however, omit waiting upon Solomon Gesner,
the celebrated author of the Death of Abel, and of several
idyls, justly esteemed for their delicate and elegant simplicity.
They abound with those nice touches of exquisite sensibility,
which discover a mind warmed with the finest sentiments;
and love is represented in the chastest colouring of innocence,
virtue, and benevolence. Nor has he confined his subjects
merely to the passion of love: paternal affection, and filial
reverence; gratitude, humanity, in short every moral duty
is exhibited and inculcated in the most pleasing and affecting
manner. He has for some time renounced poetry in order
to assume the pencil; and painting is at present his favourite
amusement. A treatise which he has published on landscapes,
discovers the elegance of his taste, and the versatility of his
genius; while his compositions in both kinds prove the
resemblance of the two arts; and that the conceptions of the
poet and of the painter are congenial. His drawings in
black and white are preferable to his paintings; for, although
the ideas in both are equally beautiful or sublime, the co∣louring
is inferior to the design. He has published a hand∣some
edition of his writings in quarto, in which every part
of the work is carried on by himself: he prints them at his
own press; and is at once both the drawer and engraver of
<PB N="71" REF="89"/>
plates. It is to be lamented that he has renounced poetry;
for, while ordinary writers spring up in great plenty; authors
of real genius are rare and uncommon. His drawings are
seen only by a few: but his writings are dispersed abroad,
translated into every language, and will be admired by future
ages, as long as there remains a relish for true pastoral sim∣plicity,
or taste for original composition. He is plain in his
manners; open, affable, and obliging in his address; and of
singular modesty. Gesner died of an apoplexy, March 2d,
1788.</P>
<P>I CALLED also on Mr. Lavater, a clergyman of Zuric,
and celebrated physiognomist, who has published four
large volumes in quarto on that fanciful subject. That
particular passions have a certain effect upon particular
features, is evident to the most common observer; and it
may be conceived, that an habitual indulgence of these pas∣sions
may possibly, in some cases, impress a distinguishing
mark on the countenance: but that a certain cast of features
constantly denotes certain passions; and that by contem∣plating
the countenance, we can infallibly discover also the
mental qualities, is an hypothesis liable to so many excep∣tions,
as renders it impossible to establish a general and
uniform system. Nevertheless Mr. Lavater, like a true en∣thusiast,
carries his theory much farther: for he not only
pretends to discover the characters and passions by the
features, by the complexion, by the form of the head, and
by the motion of the arms; but he also draws some in∣ferences
of the same kind even from the hand-writing.
Indeed his system is founded upon such universal principles,
<PB N="72" REF="90"/>
that he applies the same rules to all animated nature, extend∣ing
them not only to brutes, but even to insects. That the
temper of a horse may be discovered by his countenance,
will not perhaps strike you as absurd: but did you ever hear
before, that any quality could be inferred from the physiog∣nomy
of a bee, an ant, or a cock-chafer? While I give my
opinion thus freely concerning Mr. Lavater's notions, you will
readily perceive that I am not one of those who are initiat∣ed
into the mysteries of his art. Mr. Lavater has not merely
confined himself to physiognomy. He has composed sacred
hymns and national songs, which are much esteemed for
their simplicity. He has also given to the public numerous
works on sacred subjects. I am concerned to add, that the
ingenious author extends to religion the same enthu∣siasm
which he has employed in his researches on physiog∣nomy,
and in his poetical compositions: the warmth of his
imagination hurries him on to adopt whatever is most fanci∣ful
and extraordinary; to outstep the limits of sober reason;
to be an advocate for the efficacy of absolute faith; for
inward illuminations; for supernatural visions; and for the
miraculous effects of what is called <HI>animal magnetism</HI> in the
cure of disorders. The insinuating address of Mr. Lavater,
the vivacity of his conversation, the amenity of his manners,
together with the singularity and animation of his style, have
contributed more to diffuse his system and principles, than
sound arguments or deep learning, which are not to be
sound in his lively but desultory compositions.</P>
<P>AMONG the eminent men of Zuric, must not be omitted
Dr. Hirtzel, a learned physician, who is deservedly stiled the
<PB N="73" REF="91"/>
Swiss Plutarch, and has, among various publications, more
particularly distinguished himself by the <HI>Socrate Rustique,</HI>
and by the lives of Sultzer and Heydegger.</P>
<P>LEONHARD Meister, professor of history and morality in
the School of Arts, deserves to be mentioned among the
learned men of Zuric. The versatility of his talents will be
collected from a bare catalogue of his principal works: which
are written in the German tongue.—On Fanaticism; the
History of the German Language and Literature; Lives of
the celebrated men of Zuric; Swiss Biography; the most
memorable Events of the Helvetic History, in Chronolo∣gical
Order; Instances of Intolerance and Fanaticism in
Switzerland; Public Law of Switzerland; History of the
Town and Canton of Zuric; Panegyric on Bodmer; Excur∣sions
through various Parts of Switzerland; Character of the
German Poets, in Chronological Order, with their Portraits;
Abridgment of Antient History, particularly of the Greeks,
with an Introduction on the Fine Arts and Polite Literature.
In all his writings the judicious author has displayed great
zeal for the promotion of learning, correctness of taste, li∣berality
of sentiment, and much historical and biographical
knowledge. But in his observations on fanaticism and in∣tolerance,
he has treated those subjects in a new light: he
has illustrated their dreadful effects on government and civil
society by historical events, and in a political view; he has
appealed from theory to experience, and exemplified ques∣tionable
arguments by unanswerable facts. In this instance
he has been no less singularly useful in combating perse∣cution,
than in repressing that spirit of fanaticism that pre∣vailed
<PB N="74" REF="92"/>
among many of his countrymen, and which is diffused
by men of lively abilities and popular manners.</P>
<P>THE curiosity of the naturalist will be amply gratified by
a view of the library and cabinet of Mr. John Gesner, pro∣fessor
of physics, and canon of the cathedral, who inherits
the zeal for natural history which characterised his great an∣cestor
Conrad Gesner. His proficiency in the study of nature,
and particularly his accurate skill in botany, has been
abundantly testified by the repeated acknowledgments of
Haller, whom he accompanied in his herborising excursions
through the mountains of Switzerland, and who confesses
himself indebted to Mr. Gesner for various observations and
important discoveries. Mr. Gesner's cabinet is extremely
rich in fossils, and remarkable for the drawings of the prin∣cipal
specimens in his museum; and for numerous repre∣sentations
of insects admirably painted by Schellenberg.
But one of the most curious parts of his collection, is a great
botanical work, which Haller calls <HI>vastissimum et pulcherri∣mum
opus;</HI> and which, it is much to be regretted, he has
hitherto withheld from the public. He has exhibited, in
eighty tables, a thousand generical characters of plants, ac∣cording
to the Linnaean system, together with many of the
specific characters. These tables, intended to illustrate a
general history of plants, which, as appears by his own
letters to Haller, the author meditated, were drawn and en∣graved
by Geisler, the same person who distinguished him∣self
by painting the shells of Regenfuss<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Coxe's Travels into Poland, &amp;c. Book viii. chap. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="93"/>
AMIDST the various occupations of Gesner, botany, to
which he had an early and strong attachment, has engaged a
great share of his attention; besides two or three early pro∣ductions
in this line, he began, in the year 1759, to publish
a work which he has extended to eight publications, in the
quarto form. The first seven parts bear the title of <HI>Phy∣tographia
Sacra Generalis;</HI> the remaining that of <HI>Phyto∣graphia
Sacra Specialis.</HI> In this work the author treats on
philosophy, of vegetation in general, and on the circulation
of the sap through the particular parts of plants; on the
Linnaean system against the objections of Alston; on the uses
of plants as food to man, and gives a detail of upwards of a
hundred edible kinds, with a compendious account of the
specific properties of each; on the medicinal uses of plants;
on the various oeconomical uses of vegetables, illustrating in
a particular manner, among many others, those of the Palm∣tree,
Flax, and Aloes. In the latter volumes of this work,
the author treats on other advantages derived to mankind
from the vegetable world. He speaks, for instance, on the
nature and constituent parts of turf and peat, and enume∣rates
the species of bog and fen plants which enter into the
composition of each; on the kinds of shrubs proper for
hedges; on timber for building, and particularly such as
were used for those purposes by the ancients. In the first
part, which is all that is hitherto published, of what he
names <HI>Phytographia Sacra Specialis,</HI> he has given an account
of those authors who have written on the plants of the holy
scriptures, and enters upon the history of each.</P>
<P>THE Society of Physics owes its origin to Messrs. Hey∣degger,
Schultetz, and John Gesner, who first assembled
<PB N="76" REF="94"/>
in 1745, and admitted others, in order to attend a course of
lectures on natural history. This course was read by Mr.
John Gesner, professor of physics, who so greatly excited the
attention, and animated the zeal of his audience, that in a
short space of time the members were increased to seventy.
The first regular meeting was held in 1745, in a private
house; and in a few years they deserved and received the
protection of government, which granted the profits of a
lottery towards establishing a fund. There are now about
a hundred and twelve members: each pays on his admittance
eight florins, or about seventeen shillings, and the same sum
annually. Since 1757, a suite of apartments, in a house be∣longing
to one of the tribes, has been assigned for holding
their assemblies, and for containing their library and ap∣paratus.
The society is divided into five departments.
1. Physics. 2. Mathematics. 3. Natural history. 4. Me∣dicine.
5. Application of physics to arts and trades. But
the grand and principal object of this society, is the encou∣ragement
and improvement of practical agriculture. For
this purpose the members correspond with the land-holders
in different parts of the canton; visit various districts in ro∣tation;
summon to Zuric some of the best informed farmers;
acquaint themselves with the state of husbandry; give
them instructions; offer prizes for improvements in culti∣vation;
furnish small sums of money to the poorer peasants:
and communicate to the public the result of their inquiries
and observations.</P>
<P>THE public library at Zuric contains about 25,000 vo∣lumes,
and a few curious manuscripts. Among the manu∣scripts,
the following principally attracted my attention.
<PB N="77" REF="95"/>
1. The original manuscript of Quintilian, found in the li∣brary
of St. Gallen, and from which the first edition of that
great rhetorician was printed. 2. The psalms in the Greek
tongue, written on parchment dyed of a violet colour. The
letters are silver, excepting the initials, which are in golden
characters, and the marginal references, which are red. It
is similar to the celebrated <HI>Codex Argenteus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Travels into Poland, Russia, &amp;c. Book vii. chap. vi.</NOTE> in the library
of Upsala. It is supposed to have once formed part of the
<HI>Codex Vaticanus,</HI> preserved in the Vatican library at Rome:
as both of these manuscripts are similar, and the Roman
volume is deficient in the psalms. The learned Breitinger
has published a dissertation on this codex<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De Antiquissimo Turicensis Bibliothecae Graeco Psalmorum Libro Turici. 1748.</NOTE>. 3. Several ma∣nuscripts
of Zuingle, which prove the indefatigable industry
of that celebrated reformer. Among these I particularly
noticed his Latin Commentary on Genesis and Isaiah, and a
copy of St. Paul's Epistles from the Greek Testament pub∣lished
by Erasmus. At the end is written an inscription in
the Greek tongue, signifying, “Copied by Ulric Zuingle,
1415.” It was presented to the public library by Ann Zuingle,
the last survivor of his illustrious racc. 4. Three Latin
letters from Lady Jane Grey to Bullinger, in 1551, 1552, and
1553. These letters, written with her own hand, breathe a
spirit of the most unaffected piety, and prove the extraor∣nary
progress which this unfortunate and accomplished
princess, though only in the sixteenth year of her age, had
made in various branches of literature. The Greek and
Hebrew quotations shew that she was well acquainted with
<PB N="78" REF="96"/>
those languages. These letters, though given in several
publications, yet are not printed with that accuracy, which
the relics of such a personage deserve. This library is rich
in the best editions of the classics; and particularly in the
early impressions of the 15th century.</P>
<P>THE library of the cathedral belonging to the Caroline
College contains several manuscripts of the reformers, Bul∣linger,
Pelican, Bibliander, and Leon Juda; particularly the
translation of the Talmud by Pelican and Bibliander, which
has never been printed; also sixty volumes of letters from Zuin∣gle
and the early reformers, with a complete index. This col∣lection,
so interesting to ecclesiastical history, was formed by
Henry Hottinger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was born in 1620; and was drowned in the Limmat, 1667.</NOTE>, the learned author of the History of the
Reformation, renowned for his extensive erudition, and par∣ticularly
for his profound skill in oriental literature. The
librarian pointed out an antient manuscript of the Latin
Vulgate, called <HI>Codex Carolinus,</HI> and supposed to have been a
present from Charlemain; but without foundation, for it is
certainly of much later date, probably of the eleventh cen∣tury.
Among the rare books is the Latin Bible, translated
by Pelican, Bibliander, and Leon Juda, printed at Zuric
in 1545.</P>
<P>THE lover of literary and ecclesiastical history will not fail
to visit the Reverend Mr. Simler's ample collection of letters
which passed between Zuingle and the other reformers of
Zuric, and their correspondents in different parts of Europe.
<PB N="79" REF="97"/>
The learned professor proposed to have printed by subscrip∣tion,
in two volumes in folio, the letters of the English re∣formers,
several of which Burnet has published in his History
of the Reformation, but with many errors. Not finding,
however, sufficient subscribers for so expensive a publication,
he was obliged to relinquish his plan, to the regret of all
lovers of biography.</P>
<P>THE library of Mr. de Heydegger, senator of Zuric, de∣serves
the notice of the learned traveller. The ingenious
possessor inherited from his father only 3000 volumes, which
he has extended to 15,000. His principal aim is directed to
those books that were unknown to Maittaire, which might
assist in correcting his typographical annals, and in forming
an accurate and connected history of printing. In this col∣lection
are found many rare and elegant impressions by the
Alduses, Juntas, Giolitos, Torzentino, Stephens, Elzivers,
Comino, Tonson, Wetstein, Baskerville, Bodoni, Barbot, and
Didot. It is particularly rich in the earliest impressions, of
which there are no less than seven hundred that were printed
in the fifteenth century. Among many rare books, I noted
down the following: Ciceronis Officia. Fust et Sheiffer
1465. pet. in folio.—Jo. Sanuensis Catholicon, folio. Aug.
Vindel. Gunther, Zeiner et Reutlingen, 1469.—First edition
of Petrarcha Venet. Vindel. de Spira, 1470. See Cat. de la

Gregor. de Gregorii fratelli, 1492, folio, wooden cuts. The
Decameron translated into German about 1475, folio.—
Mamontreclus Beronae p. Helian Heliae, 1470, folio. This
book was printed at Munster, in the canton of Lucerne, and
is curious, because it is the first instance of typography in
Switzerland.</P>

EXCURSION TO REGENSBERG, AND TO
THE SUMMIT OF THE LAGERBERG.</HEAD>
<P>DURING my first tour through Switzerland, I passed
too short a time at Zuric to have an opportunity of
visiting its delightful environs, which, for the mild beauties
of nature, the numerous population, and the well-being of
the peasantry, is scarcely surpassed by any spot on the globe.
Having, on subsequent occasions, resided longer at Zuric, I
did not omit making several excursions into various parts of
the canton; an account of which will form the subject of
the present letter.</P>
<P>THE weather clearing up after several continued and
heavy rains, on the 24th of June, 1785, I accompanied Mr.
de Bonstet of Berne, Professor Meister, and some other gen∣tlemen
of Zuric, in a delightful tour round the lake. We
had no need of guides, as the country was well known to my
companions; and we had no incumbrance of baggage.
Having made an early dinner, according to the custom of the
place, we departed at mid-day; and walked about three miles,
through vineyards and corn-fields, to Kussnach, a small vil∣lage
<PB N="82" REF="100"/>
on the east side of the lake. Here we paid a visit to a
gentleman, and were served with tea, slices of bread and
butter, and cherries.</P>
<P>IN 1778, Kussnach was considerably damaged by the rise
of a small torrent, which poured down from the mountains,
carried away twenty-five houses, and destroyed about sixty
persons. This torrent, now only a little rill, swelled to
such a degree, as to rise at least thirty feet above its usual
level: an increase owing to the sudden melting of the snow
on the neighbouring heights. Every assistance was instantly
afforded to the wretched inhabitants, and a collection of
£. 3000 was raised in one Sunday at the different churches of
Zuric: an astonishing collection for a town which does not
contain 11,000 souls.</P>
<P>I AM indebted to Professor Meister for the following ob∣servations
on the population, industry, and productions of
Kussnach, and the neighbouring villages. Kussnach contains
about 1700 souls, and the neighbouring villages are no less
peopled: this astonishing population in so small a compass is
occasioned by the trade of the capital, which employs so many
hands. The proportion between the produce of the soil and
the profits derived from working for the manufactures, may
be estimated from the following calculation: Five parishes
and two villages, situated near the lakes of Zuric and Greiffen,
contain 8498 souls; and comprehend only 6050 acres<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The acre used in this letter contains from 32,600 to 36,000 square feet.</NOTE> of
arable land, 698 of vines, and 3407 of pasture, or scarcely an
<PB N="83" REF="101"/>
acre and a quarter for each person. Their subsistence is
principally supplied by 2016 looms, by means of which they
prepare silk and cotton for the merchants of Zuric. In these
parts an acre is sold for £. 100 or £. 120; whereas the same
quantity in the interior part of the canton is worth only £. 20
or £. 30.</P>
<P>IN sixteen parishes, situated on the borders of the lake,
the number of inhabitants, in 1784, were 32,581. There
were 271 marriages, 1135 births. The proportion of the
marriages to the births, as 1000 to 4188; of the births to
the deaths, as 1000 to 882; of the births to the living, as
1000 to 18,705; of the deaths to the living, as 2000 to 32,515;
of the males to the females, as 1000 to 1097.</P>
<P>HAVING reposed ourselves about an hour at Kussnach,
we continued our walk through vineyards and corn-fields,
sometimes on the sloping banks of the lake, sometimes on a
small foot-path formed on terraces upon a level with the
water; or along narrow roads that resemble gravel-walks
winding through pleasure-grounds and parks in England.
We enjoyed, during great part of the way, the most agreeable
shade from large beech and oak, walnut and other fruit∣trees,
that overhang like weeping willows; many of which are
planted almost horizontally, either stretching from the sides of
the hill, or from the very edge of the water, their boughs
dipping into the lake: the scattered cottages, the numerous
villages, the picturesque villas placed on the banks of the
lake, and several neat churches, added to the beauty of the
ever-changing scenery.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="102"/>
HAVING walked about three miles further, we stopped at
a peasant's house in Meile, who regaled us with our usual
fare, milk and cherries, but would receive no recompense.
Here we embarked and crossed the lake, enjoying a most
agreeable view of each border studded with villas, churches,
and villages, many of which look like large towns, as they
were half concealed by the intervening trees. As we passed
near a bold promontory, richly covered with wood, we ob∣served
the sun, which was hid under a cloud, gilding the
distant town of Rapperschwyl, the hills towards Zuric
silvered by a milder ray, and the gloomy but sublime moun∣tains
of Glarus boldy rising to the south.</P>
<P>WE landed at Weddenschweil, which is agreeably situated
on the west side of the lake. It is the capital of a bailliage,
that stretches to the limits of the cantons of Zug and
Schweitz, and was formerly an independent lordship. In
1287 it was sold by Rhodolph of Weddensch weil to the knights
of Jerusalem; and became a commandery until 1459, when
Zuric purchased it from the master of that order for 20,000
florins. The inhabitants having revolted in 1466, and being
compelled to submit, were deprived of several privileges,
and particularly the criminal jurisdiction, which was trans∣ferred
to the senate of Zuric. Notwithstanding the loss of
these immunities, the mildness of government is sufficiently
manifested, by the considerable increase of the population
within this last century. The number of souls, which in
1678 consisted of only 4867, amounted in 1782 to 8188.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="103"/>
NEAR Weddenschweil I observed a beautiful meadow,
prettily skirted with wood, and fertilized by a lively stream,
which tempted me to quit the road. I had scarcely proceeded
fifty paces, before I saw a silver rill gushing from the crevice
of a rock sprinkled with wood. As we were contemplating
this pleasing landscape, we heard the noise of falling waters,
and caught a glimpse of a torrent tumbling from an elevated
rock, glistening through the dark foliage, and richly illumi∣nated
by the rays of the sun, which was concealed from our
view. Having penetrated by the side of the torrent, we saw
it bursting from the height, amid surrounding trees, fall
about six feet upon a ridge, and then roll fifty feet in mid
air, without touching the sides of the precipice. The effect
was peculiarly striking. Nor could we sufficiently admire
the amphitheatre of rock, the beeches suspended on its top
and sides, the beams of the sun darting on the falling waters,
and the noise of the torrent contrasting with the mild and
tranquil beauties of the lake we had just quitted.</P>
<P>OUR walk to Richliswick, where we passed the night, was
no less agreeable than that on the other side of the lake.
The road ran sometimes through meadows, at a little distance
from the lake, sometimes close to the water, under the shade
of trees planted casually by the hand of nature, in the most
capricious shapes: we scarcely advanced a hundred steps
without passing a neat cottage, and meeting with peasants,
who saluted us as we went along. Every spot of ground is
cultivated in the highest perfection. At Richliswick, which
like Weddenschweil contains many good houses of stone,
plaistered and white-washed, ornamented with green window∣shutters,
and Venetian blinds, we found an inn with com∣fortable
<PB N="86" REF="104"/>
accommodations. This place is the passage of much
merchandize; and is greatly resorted to by the pilgrims, in
their way to Einsidlin.</P>
<P>EARLY the next morning we embarked, and sailed to the
Isle of Ufnau. The weather was uncommonly fine, the lake
was quite still, the reflection of the white houses quivered
on the surface of the water; and the hollows of the distant
mountains seemed to be filled with a transparent vapour,
which induced me to cry out, in the language of poetry,</P>
<Q><L>“Pleasant the sun,</L>
<L>When first on this delightful land he spreads</L>
<L>His orient beams on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,</L>
<L>Glist'ring with dew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton's Paradise Lost.</NOTE>.”</L></Q>
<P>ABOUT a mile from Richliswick is a single house standing
on a gentle acclivity, the walls of which divide the canton
of Zuric from that of Schweitz, and at the same time set
instant bounds to that industry and population which had
hitherto attracted our wonder and delight.</P>
<P>IN about two hours we landed at Ufnau, a pleasant island,
about an English mile in circumference, belonging to the
abbey of Einsidlin. It has only a single house, inhabited by
a peasant's family, two barns, a kind of tower or summer∣house,
seated on the highest point, a chapel which is never
used, and a church in which mass is said only twice in the
year. Within is the tomb of St. Alderic, who built an her∣mitage
<PB N="87" REF="105"/>
on the island, to which he retired. He died in 1473,
and must have been highly revered for his supposed sanctity;
as a Latin inscription informs us, that “he was fed with
bread from heaven, and walked upon the surface of the
waters.” This island is sometimes called Hutten's island,
in memory of that extraordinary person, who retired and
died in this obscure spot.</P>
<P>HUTTEN, descended from an illustrious family, was born
at Seckenberg in Franconia, and receiving an education
suitable to his birth, prosecuted his studies with that im∣petuous
zeal which was the leading mark of his character.
He passed a life of almost unparalleled vicissitude; sometimes
in the camp, signalized for personal courage; sometimes in
universities, where he distinguished himself by various pub∣lications;
sometimes in courts, received with respect, or
driven away for insolence; and sometimes wandering over
different parts of Europe in extreme indigence. Having, at
an early period of his life, embraced the opinions of Luther,
he drew both his pen and his sword in defence of the new
doctrines; was so intemperate in his ardour, that he was
frequently imprisoned; and alarmed even the daring spirit
of Luther by his repeated outrages. Having rendered him∣self
an object of terror to both Lutherans and Catholics, his
overbearing temper in vain sought an asylum, until he found
it in this sequestered island. He expired in 1523, in the 36th
year of his age: a man as remarkable for his genius and
learning, as for his turbulence and presumption.</P>
<P>THE island is agreeably broken into hill and dale; is ex∣tremely
fertile in pasture; produces hemp, flax, a few vines,
<PB N="88" REF="106"/>
and a small tufted wood, which overhangs the edge of the
water. It is the only island in the lake of Zuric, except an
uninhabited rock, which yields a small quantity of hay.</P>
<P>HAVING reimbarked, we soon landed at Rapperschwyl,
and continued ascending amid hanging enclosures of pasture
and corn, commanding a fine view of the lake, hills, moun∣tains,
and alps. Having passed the little territory belonging
to Rapperschwyl, we came into the canton of Zuric. On
entering a neat cottage, to inquire the road, we saw a peasant
teaching about thirty children to read and write. On ex∣pressing
my surprize and satisfaction, I was informed that
each village has a peasant schoolmaster, either entirely or
partly paid by government; and that in this canton there is
scarcely a child who is not instructed in reading and writing.
A little further we entered another cottage, where the mis∣tress
of the house offered us milk and cherries, and placed
upon the table nine or ten large silver spoons.</P>
<P>WE continued our walk through an enclosed, hilly, and
well-wooded country, and arrived about mid-day at Grunen∣gen,
a small burgh, capital of the bailliage. After dinner we
paid a visit to the bailif, who resides in the castle, which
stands on an elevated rock, overlooking an extensive pro∣spect;
towards the south wild and romantic, towards the
west rich and well cultivated, watered by a lively stream
which flows from the lake of Pfessikon. The bailif pos∣sesses
considerable authority. He judges civil and criminal
affairs, in the presence of certain jurymen and the under∣bailif;
but can pass sentence without their concurrence, as
neither of them enjoys a vote. He can punish all crimes
<PB N="89" REF="107"/>
which are not capital; can order whipping, or even the torture
to be inflicted, when the criminal is convicted, and will not
confess: I was greatly shocked to find that this horrid expe∣dient
had been lately practised. Even in capital cases he can
condemn to death, provided he summons eighty jurymen
from the different districts to be present at the trial; but as
this custom is attended with much expence, he usually
remits the culprit to Zuric. In civil proceedings an appeal
lies from his decision to the senate of Zuric. If the bailif
abuses his power, the senate readily listens to the complaints
of the oppressed inhabitants, and would not fail to punish
the unjust judge. An instance of this impartiality occurred
in 1754, when the bailif being proved guilty of extortions,
though he was son-in-law to the burgomaster, was fined and
banished from Switzerland. I learned this fact, on observing
a vacant place in the series of coats of arms belonging to the
several bailifs, which are painted in the hall of the castle;
the arms of the extortioner, which once filled this vacant
place, had been erased by order of government.</P>
<P>FROM Grunengen we pursued our course through lanes,
fields, and enclosures, along a most delightful country,
abounding in vines, corn, pasture, and wood. As the setting
sun gradually descended below the horizon, we frequently
looked back upon the distant alps, whose lower parts were
dusky and gloomy; and whose sumits were</P>
<Q><L>“Arrayed with reflected purple and gold,</L>
<L>And colours dipt in heav'n.”</L></Q>
<P><PB N="90" REF="108"/>
AT the close of the evening I arrived at Ustar; regretting
that our day's journey was concluded, and not feeling in the
least fatigued with a walk of eighteen miles, from Rapper∣schwyl
to Ustar; so greatly had I been occupied and delighted
with the beauties of this romantic country. Ustar is a large
parish, containing 3000 souls; the wooden cottages are neat
and commodious, resemble those in the canton of Appenzel,
and are dispersed in the same manner over the hills and
dales.</P>
<P>THE sun had scarcely risen before we quitted our beds,
and walked to the castle of Ustar. It stands boldly on an
elevated rock, planted to its very summit with vines, and
commands a most extensive view, bounded by the Jura, the
mountains of the Black Forest, and the chain of alps stretch∣ing
from the canton of Appenzel to the confines of the
Vallais. Below and around, the country resembled the most
cultivated and enclosed parts of England; a small lively stream
winded through an immense plain; while the lake of Greiffen
appeared like a broad river, washing the bottom of the ad∣jacent
hills. This castle was formerly the residence of the
counts of Ustar, who held it and the district as a fief from
the counts of Ravenspurgh, and was at that time a strong
fortress. On the extinction of that house, in the middle of
the fourteenth century, it was transferred to the family of
de Bonstet; and in 1552 was purchased by Zuric, and united
to the bailliage of Greiffensee. M. de Bonstet, whom I have
mentioned as one of our party, derived great satisfaction in
tracing the antiquity and history of this seat, formerly pos∣sessed
by his ancestors, and in observing the family arms
<PB N="91" REF="109"/>
painted upon the glass windows. This castle is now a pri∣vate
gentleman's house, and belongs to Mr. Teyler of Wed∣denschweil.</P>
<P>FROM Ustar we crossed the fields, and arrived at the lake
of Greiffen. We walked for some way upon the turf, along
its borders, under the pendulous branches of oak, beech, and
elms. This lake is of an oblong shape, about six miles long,
and a mile broad. On one side the shores are flat, or gently
rising; on the other, hills richly wooded. The dearth of
cottages and inhabitants, in this delightful but solitary spot,
formed a striking contrast with the numerous villages we had
recently quitted; while the southern extremity of the lake
seemed almost bounded by that magnificent chain of alps,
which constantly engaged our attention.</P>
<P>HAVING embarked in a small boat, we passed the village
of Greiffen, pleasingly situated on a small promontory embo∣somed
in a wood, and landed at the northern extremity of
the lake. Here I bathed, and walked on gently, ascending
through fertile grounds, delightfully planted with oak,
beech, and poplars, and innumerable fruit-trees. At a small
village we stopped at the parsonage. You can scarcely form
to yourself on adequate idea of the neatness and simplicity
which reign in these parts. The clergyman's two daughters,
about fifteen or sixteen years of age, politely brought milk
and cherries for our refreshment. They were neatly drest,
like the peasant girls, in straw hats, their shift-sleeves tied, as
is the custom of the country, above their elbows. From this
retreat of innocence and simplicity we ascended about a mile,
<PB N="92" REF="110"/>
then burst upon a charming view of Zuric, the lake, and en∣virons;
and, gently descending, arrived at Zuric, quite en∣chanted
with this short expedition.</P>
<P>AN expedition to the summit of the Lagerberg was no
less agreeable than the former excursion. I procured a guide
and a horse; but the weather proving very fine, I gave the
horse to my servant, and preferred walking across the corn∣fields,
meadows, and thickets. The fields were enlivened by
the numerous persons employed in harvest. In these parts,
as well as the neighbouring countries, I observed with plea∣sure,
that the oxen, which are chiefly used for draught, are
not yoked to the teams or ploughs, but harnessed like horses.
This custom enables those animals to perform their labour
with much more ease, and with greater effect. It has lately
been introduced into some parts of England; and all unpreju∣diced
farmers allow its superior advantage, as the yoke is ex∣tremely
galling; and four oxen harnessed with collars will do
as much work as six when yoked by the neck. A few miles
from Zuric, I passed through the village of Affholteren, near
the church, which is prettily situated in the middle of a large
field; skirted the small lake of Kasten, at a little distance
from the picturesque ruins of Old-Regensberg; and gently
ascended to New-Regensberg, which stands on an elevation,
at the foot of the Lagerberg.</P>
<P>THE counts of Regensberg were powerful barons during
that period of anarchy and confusion which distinguished
the 12th and 13th centuries. They were involved in con∣stant
wars, or rather desultory skirmishes, with the town of
<PB N="93" REF="111"/>
Zuric, until they were finally repulsed by Rhodolph of Habs∣burgh,
then captain-general of the troops of Zuric. On the
extinction of the counts of Regensberg, in the 14th century,
their territory devolved to the House of Austria, and in 1409,
became subject to Zuric.</P>
<P>THE present burgh is inhabited by about 200 persons:
who enjoy considerable privileges. They have their burgo∣master,
and a council of six members, who form the civil
court of justice, from whose decision an appeal lies directly
to Zuric. The criminal jurisdiction belongs to the bailif,
who resides in the castle. This building was formerly of
great strength, and frequently defied the attacks of Zuric.
The greatest part of the present edifice was constructed in
the last century; the only remains of the antient fortress
being some stone walls and a round tower, which commands
a distant prospect. A well in the middle of the burgh, hol∣lowed
in the rock to the depth of 216 feet, which is now
dry, furnished formerly water to the garrison, during the
obstinate sieges it maintained before the invention of gun∣powder.
Near this well is a copious fountain, which is sup∣plied
from a spring that rises in the Lagerberg. The adja∣cent
country is a most delightful intermixture of hill and
dale. The rock on which Regensberg is built, and which
terminates in an abrupt precipice, forms the eastern extre∣mity
of that vast chain of mountains known by the general
name of Jura, the branches of which are distinguished by
different appellations. The branch that rises from this point
is called the <HI>Lagerberg,</HI> to the summit of which I mounted
on horseback. I passed for some way through cultivated
<PB N="94" REF="112"/>
enclosures, and afterwards through forests of pine, fir, and
beech, until I reached the highest point, on which stands a
signal-house. From this point, which overlooks the whole
country, I enjoyed one of the most extensive and uninter∣rupted
prospects, and particularly the finest distant view of
the Alps, which I had yet seen in Switzerland.</P>
<P>To the north, the eye expatiates freely over the wilds of
the Black Forest; to the east, beyond the confines of Ba∣varia;
towards the west, traces the branches of the Jura ex∣tending
in multifarious directions; to the south, looks down
upon the fertile and enclosed regions in the canton of Zuric,
on the lake and its populous banks, and admires the vast
expanse of country swelling from plains to acclivities, from
acclivities to hills, from hills to mountains, and terminating
in those stupendous alps,</P>
<Q><L>“Whose heads touch heaven.”</L></Q>
<P>THIS wonderful and sublime prospect detained me insen∣sibly
till the close of evening, when I descended, through
the gloomy forests of pine, fir, and beech, that clothe the
sides of the Lagerberg; and, filled with those pleasing but
melancholy reflections which the indescribable beauties of
nature leave upon the mind, I rode slowly on, and did not
arrive at Zuric till the gloom of night had overspread the
horizon.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 11.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WINTERTHUR—CASTLE OF KYBURGH.</HEAD>
<P>WINTERTHUR stands about twelve miles from
Zuric; a town which, although situated in the can∣ton,
and under the protection of Zuric, yet retains its own
laws, has its own magistrates, and is in a great measure inde∣pendent.
Winterthur was formerly governed by its own
counts, who were probably a branch of the Kyburgh family,
for both houses bore the same coat of arms. In the 14th
century it was possessed by Hartman, count of Kyburgh, who
first surrounded it with walls; and upon his death it de∣volved
to his nephew Rhodolph of Habsburgh. Rhodolph,
afterwards emperor, conferred upon the inhabitants consi∣derable
privileges, for assisting him in the war in which he
was engaged with Ottocar, king of Bohemia. It continued
subject to his descendants until 1424, when the inhabitants
claimed the protection, and obtained the alliance, of Zuric.
In 1467, the archduke Sigismond having sold his rights to
Zuric, that canton succeeded to his prerogatives. A deputy
from Zuric resides at Winterthur, but for no other pur∣pose
than for collecting the toll, half of which belongs to
Zuric.</P>
<P>THE government of Winterthur is aristocratical. The
supreme power, in all things not interfering with the claims
of Zuric, resides in the Great and Little Council. These two
<PB N="96" REF="114"/>
tribunals united are final judges in all criminal procedures,
and pass sentence of death without appeal. The Little
Council is invested with the general administration of af∣fairs,
and determines civil causes in the first resort. From
their decision an appeal lies to the Great Council, and in
all processes between a stranger and a burgher, to the senate
of Zuric.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the town is considered as independent, and
only under the protection of Zuric, yet that canton claims the
right of restricting the inhabitants from manufacturing silk,
and from establishing a printing-press, as interfering with the
natives of Zuric. This restriction has occasioned, and still
continues to excite, ill-will between the two towns, and has
given rise to much litigation. And though Zuric did not
prohibit the manufactures of silk, yet by forbidding the pea∣sants
of the canton from preparing and spinning the mate∣rials,
this order amounted to a virtual prohibition. At pre∣sent
a similar dispute is in agitation concerning the establish∣ment
of a printing-press at Winterthur. The right will
scarcely be controverted; but as the cause will be finally
determined by Zuric, it remains a doubt whether that go∣vernment
will be sufficiently disinterested to decide in favour
of Winterthur against its own burghers. In all other re∣spects,
excepting in these two articles of trade so profitable to
Zuric, the commerce of Winterthur lies under no restraint.
The principal manufactures are muslins, printed cottons, and
cloth. Some vitriol-works are carried on with considerable
success.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="115"/>
THE town is small, and its inhabitants amount to about
two thousand; who are for the most part remarkably indus∣trious.
The schools in this petty state are well endowed
and regulated. The public library contains a small collec∣tion
of books, and a great number of Roman coins and
medals, chiefly found at Ober-Winterthur; among the most
rare I observed a Didius Julianus and a Pertinax. Ober-Winterthur,
or Upper Winterthur, at present only a small
village near the town, in the high road leading to Frauen∣field,
is the site of the antient <HI>Vitodurum,</HI> a Roman station,
and the most considerable place in this neighbourhood. No
other remains of its former consequence subsist but the
foundations of antient walls, and the numerous Roman coins
and medals which have been discovered. The Roman road,
which once traversed the marshes between Winterthur and
Frauenfield, is no longer visible, because it forms the founda∣tion
of the present high-road.</P>
<P>THE castle of Kyburgh, towering on the summit of
an eminence which overlooks Winterthur and the adja∣cent
district, is a picturesque object; and remarkable in the
history of this country, during the times of confusion
which preceded and followed the interregnum of the em∣pire.
In the beginning of the 12th century, the counts
of Kyburgh possessed the counties of Kyburgh, Lentz∣burgh,
and Baden; and their territories were further in∣creased
by the accession of Burgdorf and Thun, which fell to
Ulric<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some authors assert that Werner, son of Ulric, was the husband of Anne. Great confusion reigned in the early history of the Counts of Kyburgh, until Fuessli cleared it up. See article Kyburgh in Fuessli's Erdbeschreibung.</NOTE> in right of his wife Anne, sister of Berchtold V. duke
<PB N="98" REF="116"/>
of Zaeringen, upon the demise of the latter without issue male.
These domains devolved, in 1273, to Rhodolph count of
Habsburgh, on the death of his uncle Hartman the elder, the
last count of Kyburgh. This inheritance rendered Rhodolph
one of the most powerful princes in these parts; and proba∣bly
opened his way to the imperial throne. Before his de∣cease,
the emperor ceded to his son Rhodolph and his heirs
the county of Kyburgh, and his other dominions in Swit∣zerland;
and, on the demise of his son, confirmed this grant
to his grandson John, the same who assassinated his uncle,
the emperor Albert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 14.</NOTE>, and was called the Parricide.</P>
<P>UPON Albert's assassination, the sons of that emperor
seized and kept possession of Kyburgh and the other hereditary
domains in Switzerland, and transmitted them to their poste∣rity.
In 1414, the emperor Sigismond put under the ban of
the empire Frederic duke of Austria, and granted for a sum
of money the county of Kyburgh to Zuric. In 1442 it was
restored to the House of Austria; but, in 1452, was finally
ceded to Zuric by Sigismond, archduke of Austria, in order
to liquidate a debt which he owed to the canton. From
that time it has formed a bailliage in the canton of Zuric; but
the title of Count of Kyburgh has been always retained by
the House of Austria, and is still assumed by its present illus∣trious
descendant Joseph the Second.</P>
<P>THE castle of Kyburgh, which stands in a romantic and
wild situation, has been constructed at different periods.
Part is antient, and not improbably the same as existed in the
<PB N="99" REF="117"/>
time of Rhodolph; although I could not discover a date an∣terior
to 1424, the year in which it was granted to Zuric. In
an apartment which was formerly a stable, I observed the
portraits of all the bailifs who have resided in the castle from
the time of its cession to Zuric. The bailif enjoys greater
powers than are usually delegated by an aristocratical govern∣ment.
In criminal proceedings, he is only required to con∣sult
the jury of the district, though he is not bound by their
opinion, and can inflict capital punishment without the
necessity of referring the sentence to be confirmed by Zuric.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FRAUENFIELD—OF THE HELVETIC CONFEDE∣RACY
—DIETS.</HEAD>
<P>FROM Winterthur I passed to Frauenfield, a small town,
or rather village, the capital of Thurgau, containing
scarcely a thousand, inhabitants; and only remarkable as
being the place where, since 1712, the deputies of the Swiss
cantons assemble at the general diet.</P>
<P>THE Helvetic confederacy owes its origin to the treaty
contracted in 1308, between Uri, Schweitz, and Underwal∣den,
at the memorable revolution of 1308<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 25.</NOTE>. The accession
of Zuric, Berne, Lucerne, Zug, and Glarus, gave strength
and solidity to this union, and a century and a half elapsed
before a new member was admitted. At length, in 1501,
Friburgh and Soleure being, after much difficulty, received
into the league; upon that occasion the eight antient cantons
entered into a covenant, called the <HI>Convention of Stantz,</HI> by
which the articles of union and mutual protection were
finally settled<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Letter 26.</NOTE>. No change therein has been effected by the
subsequent reception of the three other cantons, Basle, Schaff∣hausen,
and Appenzel; they having subscribed to the same
terms which Friburgh and Soleure had accepted. Without
entering into a minute detail, I shall endeavour, in this
<PB N="101" REF="119"/>
letter, to lay before you a short view of the Helvetic con∣federacy.</P>
<P>THE code of public law, if I may so express it, between
the combined republics of Switzerland, is founded upon the
treaty of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This treaty, which regulates the ar∣ticles of war, was contracted between the eight antient cantons, in conjunction with the republic of Soleure. It ordains, that no Swiss soldier shall quit his ranks in time of action, even although he should be dan∣gerously wounded:</P>
<P>“Nous entendons aussi que si quelqu'un s'estoit blessé en quelque façon que ce fust en combatant ou en assaillant, de sorte qu'il seroit inutile pour se deffendre; il demeurera non obstant aussi avec les autres, jusques à ce que la bataille soit ex∣pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ée: et pour cela ne sera estimé fuyard et ne l'en faschera-t-on en sa personne ny en son bien aucunement.”</P></NOTE> Sempach in 1393; upon the convention of Stantz;
and upon the treaty of peace concluded in 1712, at Arau, be∣tween
the Protestant and Catholic cantons. It appears from
these several treaties, which include or enlarge those that
preceded, that the Helvetic union is a perpetual <HI>defensive</HI>
alliance between the thirteen independent contracting powers,
to protect each other by their united forces against all foreign
enemies. Accordingly, if any member of the union should
be attacked, that particular canton has a right to demand
succours from the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The respectable author of the <HI>Account of Switzerland,</HI> has fallen into a mistake in his description of the Helvetic union; and his error has been adopted by the Abbè Ma∣bly, in his <HI>Droit Public de l'Europe;</HI> by the compilers of the <HI>Encyclopédie;</HI> and by seve∣ral other writers of distinction.</P>
<P>After having given a description of the Helvetic union, he concludes the relation as follows:</P>
<P>“So far are they (the thirteen cantons) from making one body or one common∣wealth, that only the three old cantons are directly allied with every one of the other twelve. There is indeed such a connection established between them, that, in case any one canton were attacked, all the other twelve would be obliged to march to its succour; but it would be by virtue of the relation, that two cantons may have a third, and not of any direct alliance subsisting between every one of them. As for example: of the eight old cantons, Lucerne has a right of calling but five to its succour, in case of attack; but then some of those five have a right of calling others, with whom they are allied, though Lucerne be not; so that at last all must march by virtue of particular allian∣ces, and not of any general one amongst them all.”</P>
<P>The above-cited account of the Hel∣vetic union, would better have suited the league of the eight cantons before the con∣vention of Stantz; when the confederate states were not so absolutely and directly united together as they are at present; and their alliance did not perhaps totally exclude every treaty of the same kind with other powers. It was only by the articles of that celebrated convention, and the alliance of the eight cantons with Friburgh and Soleure, that the union became absolutely fixed and general. It must be confessed, however, that several Swiss historians have given the same idea of the Helvetic union as that above-mentioned: and that even now, au∣thors differ considerably upon some impor∣tant articles of the league.</P></NOTE> whole confederate body; and in case of
<PB N="102" REF="120"/>
war, the several forces to be supplied by each canton are
precisely specified. It appears, however, from the stipula∣tions
to which the five cantons agreed, that they do not, in
every respect, enjoy equal prerogatives with the eight an∣tient
cantons. For, the latter reserved to themselves a right,
if the question for declaring war against any foreign state
should be <HI>unanimously</HI> carried in their assembly, to require
the assistance of the five other cantons, without assigning the
motive: whereas the sive cantons cannot commence hostili∣ties
without the consent of the confederates; and if the
enemy should be willing to enter into a negociation con∣cerning
the matter in dispute, it must be referred to the arbi∣tration
of the eight antient cantons. It is further stipulated,
that if a rupture should ensue between the eight cantons, the
five are to observe a strict neutrality.</P>
<P>THE next essential object of the league, is to preserve ge∣neral
peace and good order. It is therefore covenanted, that
all public disputes shall be finally settled between the con∣tending
<PB N="103" REF="121"/>
parties in an amicable manner; and for this purpose
particular judges and arbiters are appointed, who shall be
empowered to compose the dissensions that may happen to
arise. To this is added, a reciprocal guarantee of the forms
of government established in the respective commonwealths:
for, in order to prevent internal factions, and revolts in any
of the allied cantons, it was agreed by the convention of
Stantz, that, in case of rebellion, the magistracy of such can∣ton
should be assisted by the forces of the others. Ac∣cordingly,
the history of Switzerland affords many instances
of protection and assistance reciprocally given between the
confederates, in defence and support of the respective go∣vernments.</P>
<P>No separate engagement, which any of the cantons may
conclude, can be valid, if inconsistent with the fundamental
articles of this general union: or in other words, the reci∣procal
contract between the members of the league, super∣sedes
every other species of public obligation. With these
exceptions, the several combined states are independent of
each other: they may form alliances with any power, or
reject the same, although all the others have acceded to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The five cantons which agreed not to conclude any treaty without the consent of the eight, are necessarily excluded from this power, together with those particular cantons, which have bound themselves by private treaties not to contract any foreign alliance, without the reciprocal consent of the others; as for instance, Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, by the alliance at Brun∣nen in 1315. But this depends upon par∣ticular treaties, and has no relation to the general union. In fact, every canton is re∣strained by the general articles of the Hel∣vetic union: but, conforming to those, no one republic is in any other instance con∣trouled by the resolutions of the majority among the confederate cantons.</NOTE>;
may grant auxiliary troops to foreign princes; may prohibit
the money of the other cantons from being current within
<PB N="104" REF="122"/>
their own territories; may impose taxes; and, in short,
perform every other act of absolute sovereignty.</P>
<P>THE public affairs of the Helvetic body and their allies
are discussed and determined in the several diets: and these
are, 1. General diets; or general assemblies of the thirteen
cantons, and of their allies. 2. Particular diets; as those of
the eight antient cantons; those of the Protestant cantons,
with the deputies of the Protestants of Glarus and Appenzel,
of the towns of St. Gallen, Bienne, and Mulhausen, called the
<HI>evangelical conferences;</HI> those of the Roman Catholic cantons,
with the deputies of the Catholics of Glarus and Appenzel,
of the abbot of St. Gallen, and of the republic of the Vallais,
called the <HI>golden alliance:</HI> as also the diets of particular
cantons, which, beside being members of the general con∣federacy,
have distinct and separate treaties with each other.</P>
<P>THE ordinary meetings of the <HI>general</HI> diet are held once
a year, and continue sitting one month; the extraordinary
assemblies are summoned upon particular occasions. It is
principally convened in order to deliberate upon the best
measures for the security of the Helvetic body. The canton
of Zuric appoints the time and place of meeting; and con∣venes
the deputies by a circular letter. The deputy of
Zuric also presides, unless the diet is held in the territory of
any other canton; in that case, the deputy of that canton is
president.</P>
<P>THIS diet formerly met at Baden; but since the conclu∣sion
of the civil war in 1712, between Zuric and Berne on
<PB N="105" REF="123"/>
one side, and Lucerne, Uri, Schweitz, Underwalden, and
Zug, on the other, (when the five latter renounced the co∣regency
of Baden) it has been assembled at Frauenfield in
Thurgau. Each canton sends as many deputies as it thinks
proper.</P>
<P>IT would be descending into a tedious detail, were I to
enter into the particular connections of the several allies,
either with the whole Helvetic body, or with some of the
cantons; and the different nature of these respective alliances.
Suffer me only to remark, that the allies may be divided into
<HI>associate,</HI> and <HI>confederate</HI> states: of the former, are the abbot
and town of St. Gallen, Bienne, and Mulhausen; of the latter,
are the Grisons, the republic of the Vallais, Geneva, Neu∣chatel,
and the bishop of Basle. The states thus comprized
under the general denomination of associates and confe∣derates,
enjoy, by virtue of this union, a total independence
on all foreign dominion; and partake of all the privileges
and immunities granted to the Swiss in other countries.
And notwithstanding some of these states are allied only with
particular cantons; yet if any of them should be attacked,
those cantons with whom they are in treaty would not only
supply them with succours, but would require the joint
assistance of the remaining cantons: should therefore any
part of the whole body be invaded, all the other members
would unite in its defence, either as immediate guarantees,
or as auxiliaries of the actual guarantees.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 13.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ROUTE BY WATER FROM ZURIC TO BADEN—
BRIDGE OF WETTINGEN—BADEN—CASTLE
OF HAPSBURGH.</HEAD>
<P>INSTEAD of following the usual route by land from
Zuric to Basle, we proceeded the greatest part of the way
by water. We embarked about two in the afternoon on the
Limmat. The navigation of that river has been described
as extremely hazardous, yet it is only dangerous upon the
melting of the snow, or after violent rains, when in several
places the rocks and shoals are covered with water. At other
times there is no danger, provided the watermen are sober
and experienced. Our boat was flat-bottomed and long, and
was rowed, or rather steered by three watermen, who used
their oars merely to direct the vessel; the stream being suf∣ficiently
rapid to carry us along at the rate of six, eight, and
sometimes even ten miles in the hour. The water is beau∣tifully
transparent; and its surface was occasionally raised
and agitated with high waves by a wind opposite to the cur∣rent.
The borders of the Limmat are at first somewhat flat,
afterwards gently rise into hills clothed with pasture and
wood, or divided into vineyards; are lastly quite perpendicu∣lar,
and fringed to the water's edge with hanging trees.
About a mile from Baden, where the Limmat flows with the
greatest rapidity, we shot under the bridge of Wettingen
with such velocity, that in the moment of admiring its bold
<PB REF="125"/>
<FIGURE>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="107" REF="126"/>
projection on one side, I imperceptibly found myself on the
other. This beautiful piece of mechanism is a wooden bridge,
two hundred and forty feet in length, and suspended above
twenty feet from the surface of the water: it was the last
work of Grubenman, the self-taught architect, whom I men∣tioned
in a former letter, and is far superior in elegance to
that of Schaffhausen.</P>
<P>WE landed at Baden, and walked to Hapsburgh, Schintz∣nach,
Konigsfelden, and Windish; of which places I shall
give you a short description. Baden derives its name from
the neighbouring warm baths, which are mentioned by the
antients under the appellations of <HI>Aquae</HI> and <HI>Thermae Helve∣ticae.</HI>
Baden was a Roman fortress, erected to curb the <HI>Alle∣manni</HI>
or Germans; and was rased to the ground, when
the Helvetians, who supported Otho, were routed by Caecina,
general to Vitellius. Being rebuilt, it was taken by the Ger∣mans;
fell afterwards under the dominion of the Franks;
was, in the tenth century, incorporated in the German em∣pire;
became successively subject to the dukes of Zaeringen,
to the counts of Kyburgh, and to Rhodolph of Hapsburgh.
In 1415, when his descendant Frederic, duke of Austria, was
put under the ban of the empire, the canton of Zuric took
possession of the town and county; and, having purchased
them from the emperor Sigismond, admitted to a joint share
in the sovereignty, Lucerne, Uri, Schweitz, Underwalden,
and Zug, Berne in 1426, and Uri in 1445.</P>
<P>BADEN continued a bailliage of these eight cantons until the
year 1712, when the civil war breaking out between the Pro∣testant
<PB N="108" REF="127"/>
and Catholic cantons, it was besieged and taken by
the troops of Zuric and Berne; and at the peace of Arau
was ceded to those two cantons and Glarus, which, on ac∣count
of its neutrality, preserved its right of joint-sove∣reignty.
Zuric and Berne did not, however, prove their
disinterestedness, when, not content with finally settling
the religious disputes in favour of the Protestants, they
exacted from the Catholic cantons the cession of Baden,
contrary to the convention of Stantz, which forms the
basis of the Helvetic constitution. The umbrage conceiv∣ed
by the Catholic cantons at this step, was the principal
inducement to conclude a perpetual alliance with France
in 1715, and to throw themselves under the protection of
that power. And this separate league has not been an∣nulled
by the general treaty which Louis XVI. contract∣ed
with the thirteen cantons in 1776. Until 1712, the
diet of the thirteen cantons assembled at Baden; but has
been since transferred to Frauenfield. The three cantons
alternately appoint a bailif, who resides in the castle. The
inhabitants elect their own magistrates, and have their own
judicial courts. In civil proceedings, an appeal lies to the
bailif, and from his decision to the syndicate, composed of the
deputies of the three cantons, and in the last resort to the
three cantons themselves. In penal causes, the criminal court
condemns, and the bailif enjoys the power of pardoning, or
mitigating the sentence. The county or bailliage contains
about 24,000 souls.</P>
<P>FROM Baden we walked through an agreeable and well∣wooded
country for some way along the side of the Limmat,
<PB N="109" REF="128"/>
whose steep banks are covered with vines to the edge of the
water; and in about two hours crossed the Reuss into the
canton of Berne. Having passed through a plain, we arrived
at the baths of Schintznach, a place remarkable for its agree∣able
position on the banks of the Aar, and its tepid mineral
waters. It is also well known as being the first place where
the Helvetic society assembled. This society, formed by
some of the most learned men in Switzerland, both of the
Catholic and Reformed religion, first helped to extend the
spirit of toleration, and to lessen that antipathy which sub∣sisted
between the members of the two persuasions. Its pub∣lications
have tended to promote a general zeal for the dif∣fusion
of polite literature. The meeting of this liberal so∣ciety
is now transferred to Olten, a small town in the canton
of Soleure.</P>
<P>NEAR Schintznach stands, on a lofty eminence, the ruins
of the castle of Hapsburgh, to which we ascended through a
wood of beech, that seemed almost coeval with the date of
the castle. The ruins consist of an antient tower, constructed
with massy stones, in a rude style of architecture, and part of
a small building of much later date. It was erected in the
beginning of the eleventh century, by Werner, bishop of
Strasburgh, came to his brothers Radebot and Latzelin, and
devolved to their descendants. Otho, grandson of Radebot,
was probably the first person upon record who styled himself
count of Hapsburgh, and it continued to be the principal title
by which his posterity was distinguished, until it was lost in a
greater dignity, when Rhodolph of Hapsburgh was elevated
to the imperial throne. His successors granted the castle and
<PB N="110" REF="129"/>
its dependencies as a fief, to the lords of Wildeck, and after∣wards
to the lord of Wolen: in 1415 it was occupied by
Berne, during the contest between the emperor Sigismond
and Frederic of Austria, and given to the family of Segesern
of Bruneck. In 1469, it was sold to the convent of Konigs∣felden;
on the dissolution of that monastery, at the reforma∣tion,
was secularised, and seized by government; has gradu∣ally
gone to decay; and is now inhabited by a peasant's fa∣mily.</P>
<P>THIS castle commands an unbounded view over hills and
dales, plains and forests, rivers and lakes, towns and villages,
mountains and alps, emblem of that extent of power to which
the talents of <HI>one man,</HI> who derived his title from this castle,
raised himself and his descendants. You will readily perceive
I allude to Rhodolph of Hapsburgh, who, from a simple ba∣ron
of Switzerland, became emperor, and founded the House
of Austria. Rhodolph was born in 1218. After signalizing
his youth in a constant scene of warfare and contention, he
was, in 1273, unexpectedly raised to the dignity of emperor,
and conferred honour on that exalted station, no less by his
political sagacity than by his military prowess. He died
in 1291, after a long and glorious reign, and in the seventy-third
year of his age.</P>
<P>IMPRESSED with these ideas, as I considered, on the very
spot, the origin of the House of Hapsburgh, and its gradual
progress towards that height of power which it has since at∣tained
under the more distinguished appellation of the House
of Austria; I could not but compare it to a small rill in the
<PB N="111" REF="130"/>
Alps, whose source is uncertain; which having received
numberless streams, forms no inconsiderable river. Flowing
through Switzerland, still almost unknown to its neighbours,
it no sooner enters Germany, than it loses its name by its
junction with the Danube; and, having collected the tribute
of numberless rivers, rolls, with accumulated and still in∣creasing
waters, through an immense extent of country, and
falls by a hundred mouths into the Euxine Sea;</P>
<Q><L>—et pare</L>

<P>RHODOLPH, during his residence in this castle, would not
have given credit to a person endowed with the spirit of pro∣phecy,
who should have informed him, that, in little more
than a century, a few small republics would drive his de∣scendants
from their hereditary dominions in Switzerland;
and erect upon their ruins, and on the basis of equal liberty,
a formidable confederacy, which would be courted by the
most powerful sovereigns. Still less perhaps would he have
believed, that he himself should possess the imperial throne,
and found the House of Austria; that his lineal descendants
should rule over Germany, Hungary, Bohemia, Austria,
Spain, Burgundy, the Low Countries, Milan, Naples, and
Sicily, and extend their dominion and influence from the
shores of the Euxine to a New World beyond the Atlantic.</P>

<P>HAVING satisfied our curiosity at the castle of Haps∣burgh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is also a castle of Hapsburgh, situated near the lake of Lucerne, which I visited in 1779. Some authors have erro∣neously asserted, that this was the castle from which the counts derived their titles. But Hergot has refuted this opinion; and un∣questionably proved that honour to be due to the castle of Hapsburgh, which I have de∣scribed in the preceding letter. See Hergot Gen. Dipl. Augs. Domus Habsb.</NOTE>,
that cradle of the House of Austria, which
still confers a title on the present emperor, we descended into
the plain of Konigsfelden, to a convent of the same name,
built by Elizabeth, on the spot where her husband, the em∣peror
Albert I. was assassinated. The occasion of this assas∣sination,
and the circumstances attending it, were as follow.
Albert, as guardian to his nephew John of Hapsburgh, had
taken possession of his hereditary dominions in Switzerland,
and refused, under various pretences, to deliver them up to
him. At length, wearied with repeated and fruitless solici∣tations,
John entered into a conspiracy against the emperor,
with Rhodolph de Warth, Ulric de Palme, Walther de Eschen∣bach,
and Conrad de Tagerfeld.</P>
<P>THE emperor dined at Baden, in his way to Rheinfelden,
a town in the circle of Suabia, where the empress his con∣sort
had collected a considerable body of troops, with which
<PB N="113" REF="132"/>
he proposed invading the three cantons of Uri, Schweitz,
and Underwalden, which had revolted against him. Con∣temporary
historians, who have recorded the minutest cir∣cumstances
in this whole transaction, relate, that Albert was
in high spirits during the repast; and that, his nephew again
entreating to be put into possession of his hereditary domi∣nions,
the emperor, with an air of banter, placed a garland of
flowers upon his head, adding, at the same time, “This will
be more suitable to you, for the present, than the cares
of a troublesome government.” This taunt had such an
effect upon the young prince, that he burst into tears, flung
away the flowers, and could not be prevailed upon to sit
down to table. After dinner, Albert continued his journey
on horseback, accompanied by his son Leopold, the conspi∣rators,
and his usual attendants; and came near the town of
Windish, in the canton of Berne, to the Reuss, over which
river passengers were usually ferried upon a raft. The con∣spirators
passed over first, and were followed by Albert: as
he was riding gently on, expecting his son Leopold, and the
remainder of his suite, he was suddenly beset by the assassins.
One of them seizing his horse's bridle, John of Hapsburgh
reproached him for his injustice in detaining his dominions;
and struck him on the neck with his sword: Rhodolph de
Warth wounded him in the side; and Ulric de Palme clove
his head with a sabre. In this condition, they left him expir∣ing
upon the ground.</P>
<P>THIS assassination was committed the first of May 1308,
in the open day, and in the sight of his son Leopold, and the
rest of his court, who had not as yet passed the river; and
<PB N="114" REF="133"/>
who, though witnesses to the murder, yet could not assist
the emperor. The field lies between the Aar and the Reuss,
not far from the junction of those two rivers; and the very
spot, where he was massacred, is marked by a convent, erected
by his wife Elizabeth and his daughter Agnes: the place
was called <HI>Konigsfelden,</HI> or King'sfield; a name it retains to
this day. The remains of the emperor were buried in the
convent of Witterling, from whence they were afterwards
transported to Spire, and there interred.</P>
<P>THE assassins escaped into the cantons of Uri, Schweitz,
and Underwalden, expecting to find a sure asylum in a na∣tion,
which Albert was preparing to invade. But the gene∣rous
natives, detesting a crime of so atrocious a nature, al∣though
committed upon the person of their greatest and
most formidable enemy, refused to protect the murderers.
D'Eschenbach concealed himself in the disguise of a common
labourer during thirty years, nor was his rank discovered till
he confessed it upon his death-bed; De Palme, destitute of com∣mon
necessaries, died in extreme poverty; De Warth, tied to a
horse's tail, like a common malefactor, and dragged to the
place of execution, was broken upon the wheel. John of
Hapsburgh, commonly known by the appellation of <HI>parri∣cide,</HI>
from this assassination, did not reap the expected bene∣fits
of the crime; for, by order of the emperor Henry the
Seventh, he retired into a monastery of Augustine friars,
where he died in 1313.</P>
<P>THE widow of Albert turned her whole thoughts towards
revenging the death of her husband; and in this pursuit in∣volved
<PB N="115" REF="134"/>
the innocent as well as the guilty; all, who had the
smallest connection with the assassins, being sacrificed with
undistinguished cruelty to the manes of the emperor. Mean
while the three cantons were, for a few years, left to the
undisturbed enjoyment of their liberties, and to strengthen
themselves against any future attack; and thus they inno∣cently
reaped the sole advantage which was derived from
this assassination.</P>
<P>THE convent or abbey of Konigsfelden comprized, with∣in
its extensive precincts, a nunnery of the order of St. Clare,
and a monastery of monks of the order of minorites, se∣parted
from each other by a wall. It was richly endowed
by Elizabeth, her five sons, and her daughter Agnes queen
of Hungary, who assumed the habit of a nun, and here
passed the remainder of her days. At the reformation the
abbey was secularized, and its lands appropriated by govern∣ment:
part of the building became the residence of the
bailif, part was converted into an hospital, and part was suf∣fered
to fall to ruin. Many of the cells, formerly occupied
by the nuns, still exist in their original state; and one, in
particular, is distinguished as the habitation in which queen
Agnes lived and died. The chapel still remains entire, but
is no longer used for divine service. The glass windows are
beautifully coloured, and painted with various histories of the
Old Testament; with the portraits of Elizabeth and Agnes, of
the emperor Albert, and his sons. On the walls also are
coarsely represented the figures of Leopold duke of Austria,
and the principal nobles who perished at the battle of Sempach.
Elizabeth and Agnes, and several princes and princesses of the
<PB N="116" REF="135"/>
House of Austria, were buried in this chapel; but their
bones were a few years ago removed to the abbey of St.
Blaise, in the Black Forest, where they were deposited with
great pomp, and magnificent sepulchres erected to their
memory.</P>
<P>NEAR Konigsfelden is the small village of Windish,
standing at the conflux of the Aar and the Reuss, and sup∣posed
by antiquarians to occupy the site of <HI>Vindonissa,</HI> a Ro∣man
fortress mentioned by Tacitus. In traversing the place
I did not observe the least signs of any antiquities; but vari∣ous
lapidary inscriptions, mile-stones, sepulchral urns, me∣dals,
coins, and gems, which have been found in great abun∣dance,
sufficiently prove, that it must have been the station
of a large Roman colony. The reader, who is inclined to
reflect on the vicissitudes of human possessions, will recollect
with pleasure a quotation, which so happily relates to the
present subject: “Within the antient walls of Vindonissa,
the castle of Hapsburgh, the abbey of Konigsfeld, and the
town of Bruck, have successively arisen. The philosophic
traveller may compare the monuments of Roman con∣quest,
of feudal or Austrian tyranny, of monkish supersti∣tion,
and of industrious freedom. If he be truly a philo∣sopher,
he will applaud the merit and happiness of his
own time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. iii. p. 563.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>EARLY the next morning we embarked on the Aar, which,
though here a trifling stream, yet, being considerably swelled
<PB N="117" REF="136"/>
by the tribute of waters from the Reuss and the Limmat,
soon becomes a considerable river. Its banks are agreeably
enlivened with meadows and woods, and spotted occasionally
with villages, castles, and ruins, hanging on the water's
edge. Having made a small turn, it falls by a strait channel
into the Rhine, vying in size and rapidity with the great
river in which it loses its name: its waters, which are of a
silvery hue, are for a long way distinguished from those of
the Rhine; which, being transparent, and of a sea-green co∣lour,
seem to disdain the union.</P>
<P>THE banks of the Rhine are far superior in wildness
and beauty to those of the Aar, in many parts rising perpen∣dicularly,
yet feathered with wood; in others sloping in
gentle declivities, richly bordered with vines, forest, and pas∣tures;
and exhibiting a continual succession of towns and
villages. The rapid stream carried us above eighteen miles
in three hours, and we disembarked at Lauffenburgh, where
the Rhine forms a small cataract, which though greatly in∣ferior
to the fall of the same river near Schaffhausen, yet
deserves to be visited by travellers for the beauties of the
scenery. As I stood upon the crags of the northern shore,
the principal objects were, a high bridge, partly open and
partly covered, supported by three lofty stone piers; on the
south a row of houses, with an old ruined castle on the sum∣mit,
boldly overhanging the water; a perspective of woods
and meadows under the arcades of the bridge; and the river
dashing over its craggy bed, in a sloping cataract, until it
loses itself suddenly among the rocks which close the view.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="137"/>
ABOUT half a mile below this fall we re-embarked, and
found the waters in many parts more agitated than those of
the Limmat; particularly near Rheinfelden, where they rush
with such increasing velocity, that they were troubled like
the waves of the sea, and, beating against the boat, turned it
obliquely by their violence. Here we were hurried along
with such rapidity, that though I had a pencil in my hand, I
had no time for observation, much less for description; I
could only catch a general glance of the romantic scenery, as
we passed under a picturesque bridge of several arches, sus∣pended
high above the surface of the river, and joined to a
steep rock, on which towered some majestic ruins. In many
parts, and for a considerable way, our vessel passed within a
few inches of the shelving rocks, and was only prevented
from striking against them by the dexterity of the pilot.
As we approached Basle the stream became gradually less
rapid; and we disembarked highly delighted with our
expedition.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 15.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE TOWN OF BASLE—ERASMUS—LIBRARY—HOLBEIN.</HEAD>
<P>I Arrived at Basle, as I supposed, about twelve at noon;
but was much surprized to find, that all the clocks in
the town actually struck one: and, on inquiry, I was in∣formed,
that they constantly go an hour faster than the real
time. Different reasons have been assigned for this singula∣rity:
some assert, that it was first practised during the
council of Basle, in order to assemble, at an earlier hour, the
cardinals and bishops, who being very lazy and indolent,
always arrived too late. Others maintain, that a conspiracy
being formed to assassinate the magistrates at midnight; one
of the burgomasters, who had notice of the design, advanced
the town-clock an hour; by which means the conspirators,
imagining they had missed the appointed time, retired;
and that the clocks are still kept in the same advanced state,
as a perpetual memorial of this happy deliverance. But
there is a third reason given for this strange custom, which
seems the most probable. It is well known that the choirs
of cathedrals are constructed towards the east: that of Basle
declines somewhat from this direction; and the sun-dial,
which is placed upon the outside of the choir, and by which
the town-clock is always regulated, partakes of this declina∣tion;
a circumstance which, according to the celebrated
Bernoulli, occasions a variation from the true time of above
five-and-forty minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="139"/>
THE inhabitants of Basle are still so strongly attached to
this whimsical custom, that, although it has been often pro∣posed
in the sovereign council to regulate their clocks pro∣perly,
yet the motion has been invariably rejected; and the
people would suspect that their liberties were invaded, if
their clocks were to agree with those of the rest of Europe.
A few years since, several leading men of the town deter∣mined
to alter the hand of the sun-dial half a minute a day,
until the shadow should imperceptibly point to the true
hour. This expedient was accordingly practised, and the
clock had already lost near three-quarters of an hour, when
an accident discovered the design: the magistrates were ac∣cordingly
compelled to place the hand of the sun-dial in its
former position, and to regulate the hours by it as usual.
Indeed, long-established customs, however indifferent or ri∣diculous,
are apt to make so strong an impression upon
vulgar minds, as to become sometimes dangerous, and always
difficult to be abolished; especially among a people, like
those of this country, who are averse to any change, even
in the minutest articles. I need not remind you, how long
it was before we could be persuaded in England, to reckon
our years according to the general mode of computation
received by the rest of Europe.</P>
<P>BASLE is beautifully situated upon the banks of the Rhine,
near the point where that river, which here becomes very
broad, deep and rapid, after flowing for some way from east
to west, turns suddenly to the north. It consists of two towns
joined together by a long bridge; the <HI>large</HI> town lies on the

of the river. It stands very favourably for commerce; an
advantage which the inhabitants have by no means neglected:
for they have established a great variety of manufactures,
particularly of ribbands and cottons; and an extensive trade
is carried on by the principal merchants.</P>
<P>THE cathedral is an elegant gothic building, but strangely
disfigured by a daubing of rose-coloured paint spread over
the whole edifice. This cathedral contains the ashes of Ger∣trude
Anne countess of Hohenburg, and wife of the emperor
Rhodolph I. She died at Vienna, in 1281, and her body was
conveyed to Basle. Her two christian names gave rise to
much confusion, and led many historians to conclude that
Gertrude and Anne were two different personages, and suc∣cessive
wives of that emperor; while others ridiculously sup∣posed
that both were married to him at the same time:
nor were these erroneous opinions confuted, and the contro∣versy
finally settled, till Hergot, the laborious genealogist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hergottii Geneal. Diplom. Dom. Aust. vol. i. p. 125.</NOTE>
of the House of Austria, proved, from the most unques∣tionable
authorities of antient diplomes, the identity of this
divided personage; and that the mistake arose from her
being uniformly styled Gertrude before her coronation, and
Anne after the performance of that ceremony. She bore to
her husband fourteen children; and though the mother of
so large a family, yet such was her extreme sensibility, that
the grief which she suffered at the departure of her daughter
Clementina to Naples, on her marriage with Charles Martel,
hurried the afflicted parent to her grave.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="141"/>
IN the same church are deposited, under a marble tomb,
the venerable remains of the great Erasmus. That distin∣guished
writer joined to superior learning, and a peculiar
elegance of style, the keenest wit, which he pointed, not
only against the vices and ignorance of the monks, but the
general corruptions and disorders of the Roman church. He
was indeed the forerunner of Luther, in his first attacks
upon the Catholics, respecting the sale of indulgences: but
afterwards, when the controversy appeared more serious, and
an open breach with the church of Rome seemed inevitable;
he condemned the proceedings of that bold reformer. He
considered them, indeed, as altogether unwarrantable; and,
although he had himself censured and exposed the corrup∣tions
that infected the Catholic religion; yet he zealously
inculcated submissive obedience to the decrees of what he
called the “universal church.” Agreeably to these senti∣ments,
he advised the Protestants to endeavour at obtaining,
by mild and patient measures, what they might indiscreetly
lose by a warmer and more violent opposition.</P>
<P>SUCH temperate councils were ill suited to the daring and
impetuous spirit of Luther. Accordingly, while Erasmus
was acting the part of a mediator, and endeavouring to mo∣derate
and allay the flame on each side, he drew upon him∣self
the displeasure of both parties: and, in allusion to this
temporising conduct, one of his adversaries applied to him,
not unaptly, that line in Virgil,</P>
<Q>Terras inter caelumque volabat.</Q>
<P>The impartial truth seems to be, that he was by no means
disposed to become a martyr in the cause: the natural
<PB N="123" REF="142"/>
timidity of his temper, a too great deference to persons of
superior rank and power, and perhaps also the fear of losing
his pensions, probably induced him to take a decided part
against the reformers, and condemn their separation from
the church of Rome.</P>
<P>But it would be uncandid to impute his conduct wholly
to selfish considerations: something may fairly be ascribed to
the powerful impressions of early prejudices; and some∣thing
to that rooted love of peace and studious tranquillity,
which seems to have been the governing principle of all
his actions. But, whatever imperfections may be discovered
in some particular parts of his character, his memory must
ever be revered by every friend of genius, learning, and mo∣deration.
Liveliness of imagination, depth and variety of
erudition, together with great sagacity of judgment, were in
him eminently united. He infused a spirit of elegance even
into theological controversies; and contributed to disen∣cumber
literature from that scholastic jargon with which it
was disgraced. Erasmus reflected much honour upon this
town, by choosing it as the favourite place of his residence,
and publishing from hence the greatest part of his valuable
works. In the public library are preserved, with great ve∣neration,
several of his letters, and his last testament, written
with his own hand; as also his hanger and seal.</P>
<P>THE university of Basle was formerly eminent in the
literary history of Europe. Who, in the least conversant in
letters, is unacquainted with the celebrated names of Occo∣lampadius,
Amerbach, the three Bauhins, Grynaeus, Bux∣torf,
<PB N="124" REF="143"/>
Wetstein, Iselin, the Bernoullis, and Euler? If it has
fallen from its pristine state of renown, its decline must be
principally imputed to the casual method of electing the
professors; but it still boasts several members who do honour
to their native town by their learning and abilities.</P>
<P>THE public library contains a small collection of books,
chiefly remarkable for several rare and valuable editions;
particularly of those printed in the fifteenth century. The
most curious manuscripts are numerous letters of the first
reformers, and of other learned men in the fifteenth, six∣teenth,
and seventeenth centuries; and an account of the
proceedings at the council of Basle. The minutes of that
council were taken by John of Segovia; and are supposed to
be the same which are preserved either in the library, or in
the archives of the town: the former is written on paper,
the latter on parchment. A question has arisen which of
these two is the original. Some conclude in favour of that
in the archives, on account of the many false readings and
mistakes in the other, which are plainly the faults of a
copyist. Others give the preference to that in the library,
because it is written in different hands, and with different
ink, which seem to imply that it was noted down at various
intervals, according as the acts of the council were passed;
whereas that in the archives, being penned on parchment,
in the same hand, and with the same ink, was probably
copied from the original minutes; for who, it is urged,
would take minutes on parchment? A third opinion still
more probable, is, that neither of these are the original. Se∣veral
passages are wanting in both; which omission may
<PB N="125" REF="144"/>
have proceeded from the transcriber's not being able to read
every part of the original. It is probable also that John
of Segovia took away the minutes, and deposited them at
Rome; and that one of these manuscripts was the copy
transcribed by order of the council; of these, the manu∣script
on parchment appears to be the most authentic.</P>
<P>IN a suite of rooms belonging to this library, is a cabinet
of petrifactions, collected in the canton of Basle by the Rev.
Mr. Annoni; some antient medals and gems; a few anti∣quities
found at Augst; a large number of prints; and some
fine drawings and paintings, consisting chiefly of originals
by Holbein, who was a native of this town. These pictures
are, most of them, in the highest preservation: the con∣noisseur
can here trace all the different manners of Holbein,
and compare the productions of his youth with those of his
maturer age. A few are here preserved, which he painted
before he had reached his sixteenth year; and one ex∣tremely
curious, which he drew upon a sign for a writing∣master.
The portraits of himself, his wife, and children, in
the same group, are much admired for nature and simplicity
of expression. The most valuable of these paintings is an
altar-piece, in eight compartments, which represents the
passion of our Saviour▪ a performance, in which this ad∣mirable
artist has carried to the highest perfection, that sin∣gular
brilliancy of colouring so peculiar to his best compo∣sitions.
I was much struck with a profile of his friend and
patron Erasmus, writing his commentary upon St. Matthew:
there is a spirit and animation in the countenance, finely
expressive of the great author's sagacious and penetrating ta∣lents.
<PB N="126" REF="145"/>
Among the works of Holbein, that discover the live∣liness
of his fancy, must be mentioned the sketches which he
drew, on pursuing the Eulogium of Folly by Erasmus, on
the margin of that work, which he received as a present
from the author. This curious volume is preserved in the
library; and has been lately published by Mr. Haas, in
French, Latin, and German, with fac-similes of the original
designs, engraved on wood.</P>
<P>THE dance of death, in the church-yard of the predi∣cants
of the suburbs of St. John, is frequently shewn to
strangers as being of Holbein's pencil. It is painted in oil∣colours
upon a wall which encloses the burial-ground: but,
as it has several times been retouched, no traces are disco∣verable
of that great master's hand. In fact, the Hon. Ho∣race
Walpole, and other unquestionable judges, have proved,
that this performance was painted before Holbein was born,
and that he was not employed even in retouching it. It is
probable, however, that, from this antient painting, he took
the first hint towards composing his famous drawings on the
dance of death. In treating this subject, he has displayed such
wonderful richness of imagination, and discovered so much
judgment in the disposition, and so much spirit in the exe∣cution
of the figures, that Bubens studied them with particu∣lar
attention, and took drawings from them. The originals of
Holbein's dance of death were purchased by Mr. Fleichman of
Strasbourg, at the sale of the famous collection of Crozat, at
Paris; of which Mariette has published a catalogue. They
are now in the possession of prince Gallitzin, minister from
the empress of Russia to the court of Vienna. They consist
<PB N="127" REF="146"/>
of forty-four small drawings: the outlines are sketched with
a pen, and they are slightly shaded with Indian ink. I had
frequent opportunities of seeing them, during my con∣tinuance
at Vienna; and particularly admired the variety of
attitudes and characters in which death is represented.</P>
<P>PRINTS have been taken from some of these drawings by
Hollar, which are very scarce. Mr. de Mechel, a celebrated
artist of this place, has already engraved them after the ori∣ginal
designs; a work which cannot fail of being highly ac∣ceptable
to the admirers of the fine arts. He has added four
engravings, which are not in the prince's collection, and
which are taken from the prints of Hollar. Mr. de Mechel
ingeniously conjectures, from the dresses and characters of
several of the figures in the dance of death, that the author
sketched them while he was in England. They were, pro∣bably,
in the Arundelian collection when Hollar engraved
them. He has finished also a set of prints from the sine
paintings of the Dusseldorf gallery, and likewise engravings
of the famous Hedlinger's medals. This able artist has a
small but well-chosen collection of paintings: and his maga∣zine
of prints (in which article he carries on a very consider∣able
trade) is perhaps one of the largest and most complete
in Europe. I am acquainted with no person to whom the
curious traveller can address himself with greater advantage
than to Mr. de Mechel, nor from whom he can receive more
useful information. To a particular knowledge of the phy∣sical
beauties of Switzerland, he joins a thorough acquaint∣ance
with the different governments, customs, and manners
of the several cantons. As he is intimately connected with
<PB N="128" REF="147"/>
the principal men of learning in this country, his letters of
recommendation are the most desirable, and the most bene∣ficial,
that can be procured: and he enjoys as much satis∣faction
in conferring, as can be received by accepting, his
good offices. He indeed possesses a great fund of good∣humour,
an amiable frankness of disposition, and a certain
originality of manner, which, together with his other va∣luable
qualities, recommend him as a no less pleasing than
useful acquaintance.</P>
<P>I VISITED also the small but pleasing collection of pictures,
mostly of the Flemish and Dutch schools, belonging to Mr.
Facsch, member of the Great Council. In the court-yard
before his house is a wooden statue of Rhodolph I. sitting on
a throne, and clothed with the imperial insignia; under∣neath
I observed the date of 1273, the aera of that emperor's
coronation; and the rudeness of the sculpture renders it pro∣bable
that it is an original of that great emperor, who was
besieging Basle when he received the unexpected news of
his election. The gates were immediately thrown open;
and he was instantly admitted as a friend into that town,
which had shut its gates against him as their enemy. On
this occasion he resided a short time at Basle, and, as tradi∣tion
relates, in this very house.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 16.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOVERNMENT OF BASLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE bishops of Basle once possessed the sovereignty
over the city and canton; but were gradually de∣prived
of their prerogatives; and, in 1501, finally quitted
this town, when the canton joined the Helvetic confederacy.
They at first retired to Friburgh in Brisgau, and afterwards,
establishing their residence at Porentru, entirely lost the tri∣fling
authority and inconsiderable prerogatives which re∣mained
to them. Upon the introduction of the reforma∣tion
in 1525, the constitution was in some measure changed;
and the power of the aristocracy limited.</P>
<P>IT would seem in theory scarcely possible to divide the
aristocratical and democratical commonwealths into so many
different species as exist in Switzerland: for, in this country,
every republic has its peculiar modification; and there is
none more singular than that of Basle. To view the general
outlines of the constitution, it has the appearance of an ab∣solute
aristocracy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An aristocracy (strictly speaking) means that form of government, which places the supreme power in the nobles, exclusively of the people; but here I mean by it, the consining of the sovereign au∣thority to a certain limited number of per∣sons, without considering whether they are particians or plebeians, nobles or commons: for at Basle every citizen who is noble, and who chuses to retain his title of nobility, is incapable of being elected a member of the sovereign council.</NOTE>; but, upon considering it in detail, it will
be found to incline towards a democracy. The supreme
<PB N="130" REF="149"/>
legislative power resides in the Great and Little Councils,
consisting of about three hundred members: and the autho∣rity
of these two councils combined, is without controul.
They enact laws, declare war and peace, contract alliances,
and impose taxes: they elect the several magistrates, appoint
their own members, nominate to all employments, and con∣fer
the right of burghership. The general administration of
government is committed by the Great Council to the Se∣nate,
or Little Council; that is, to a part of its own body.
This Senate, composed of sixty members, together with the
four chiefs of the republic, two burgomasters, and two great
tribunes, is divided into two bodies, which act by rotation.
The acting division continues in office one year, decides
finally in all criminal causes, superintends the police, and ex∣ercises
several other powers subordinate to the Sovereign
Council. The collective body of citizens assembles only
once a year, when the magistrates publicly take an oath to
maintain the constitution, and preserve the liberties and im∣munities
of the people, inviolate. The reciprocal oath of
obedience to the laws, is administred to the citizens in their
respective tribes.</P>
<P>BUT, notwithstanding the great and boundless preroga∣tives
of the Great Council; yet the meanest citizen is legally
capable of being admitted into that body; and, by the sin∣gular
method of election, may possibly be chosen. For, the
vacancies in the councils are supplied from all ranks of citi∣zens,
one class only excepted, the members of the univer∣sity.
These citizens are divided into eighteen tribes, called
in German <HI>Zuenste;</HI> fifteen of which belong to the larger
<PB N="131" REF="150"/>
town, and three to the smaller: each of the first-mentioned
fifteen tribes, returns four members to the Senate; and each
of the whole eighteen, sends twelve to the Great Council.
Formerly these elections were determined by a plurality of
voices: but, as by these means the richest person was always
certain of being chosen; a <HI>ternaire</HI> was established in 1718;
that is, three candidates were nominated, and from these the
successor was appointed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fifteen tribes in the great town are called <HI>Zuenste,</HI> and the three in the small town <HI>Gesellschaften,</HI> or companies. It may also be remarked, that the citizens of the small town enjoy more advantages than those of the great town; inasmuch as the former may be appointed to public employ∣ments either in the tribes or in the com∣panies; whereas a citizen of the great town cannot be admitted into the companies, unless he resides in the small town.</NOTE> by lot.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH this mode of election in some measure put a
stop to corruption; yet it was not sufficient to counteract
entirely the influence of the wealthy: and, as the poorer
citizens could seldom succeed to the most honourable or lu∣crative
employments; they procured an act to be passed in
1740, changing the <HI>ternaire</HI> into a <HI>senaire:</HI> by which six
candidates, instead of three, were put in nomination, and
drew lots for the charge. Six tickets, containing the names
of the respective candidates, and separately placed in silver
eggs, are inserted into one bag; and the same number of
tickets, five of which are blanks, and one is marked with
the vacant employment, are placed in another. The reign∣ing
burgomaster and the great tribune, appointed to be the
drawers of this <HI>official</HI> lottery, both at the same instant take
<PB N="132" REF="151"/>
a ticket from each bag; and the candidate whose name
comes out at the same time with the ticket on which the
employment is written, obtains the post.</P>
<P>IT would be too tedious, and indeed too uninteresting, a
detail, to enter into a minute account of the forms and cir∣cumstances
requisite to be observed in selecting the several
candidates. To give, however, some general idea of this
matter:—Upon a vacancy in the Great Council, for instance,
the six candidates must be taken from the citizens of that
tribe, to which the person who occasioned the vacancy be∣longed;
and must be nominated by such of the members of
the Great and Little Councils, as are of the same tribe. The
candidates for the senate and for the tribunes or chiefs of
each tribe, called in German <HI>meister,</HI> are appointed by the
Great Council. There is but one case, in which the <HI>senaire</HI>
is not practised: for, upon the death of a burgomaster, his
colleague, who is the great tribune, succeeds of course. It
should seem, that many inconveniences must necessarily flow
from this absurd method of supplying vacant posts in the
government; as they are left intirely to the capricious dis∣posal
of fortune. In fact, it has not unfrequently happened,
that a candidate, whose knowledge and abilities rendered
him capable of being serviceable to the state, has never ob∣tained
the successful ticket; while fortune has bestowed it
upon another by no means qualified to fulfil the duties of
the employment. However, notwithstanding the ill effects
resulting from this casual method of election; the manage∣ment
of public affairs is in general tolerably well conducted;
<PB N="133" REF="152"/>
and there are few instances of civil justice being unwisely
administred, or of innocence being sacrificed to superior
wealth or power.</P>
<P>BUT the counsellors of state and the several magistrates, are
not the only persons chosen by lot; even the professors in the
university are elected in the same manner. The three can∣didates
however, (for in this instance the <HI>ternaire</HI> is still in
use) must be nominated from those who have taken the de∣gree
of doctor. Hence nothing is more common than for a
candidate to offer himself for the professorship of a science,
which he has never made the peculiar object of his studies;
if the chair of that particular branch of literature in which
he excels is already occupied: for, under these circum∣stances,
the respective unqualifred professors change places
with each other. Thus (to mention an instance from a fa∣mily
well known) John Bernoulli, the famous mathematical
professor in this university, who died in 1748, left three sons,
Nicholas, Daniel, and John, all justly celebrated for their
skill in that science, in which their father and uncle so emi∣nently
excelled. Nicholas died at St. Petersburgh, member
of the Imperial Academy of Sciences; and Daniel, having fol∣lowed
his brother into Russia, returned to Basle on obtaining
the professorship of anatomy, which he afterwards had an op∣portunity
of happily exchanging for that of natural philo∣sophy,
and died in 1782. A similar circumstance happened
to the third son John: after being several times appointed
an unsuccessful candidate in the lottery of professorships,
chance at length conferred on him the chair of <HI>rhetoric;</HI>
but, upon his father's death, he changed with Mr. Rum∣speck,
<PB N="134" REF="153"/>
to whom fortune, with her usual judgment, had
assigned the professorship of mathematics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following curious epitaph on a lawyer, interred in the cathedral, com∣plains, that the deceased, notwithstanding his advanced age of 84, which had afford∣ed many opportunities of being nominated candidate for various offices of state, had been continually excluded by fortune.

<P>THE sumptuary laws are very strict at Basle. The use
of coaches in the town is not indeed prohibited, as at Zuric;
but, what is more singular, no citizen or inhabitant is allow∣ed
to have a servant behind his carriage. Laws of this kind
may be carried, in some instances, to a scrupulous and even
ridiculous minuteness; upon the whole, however, they are
excellent regulations, and not only useful but necessary in a
small republic. They have certainly operated with great
advantage in this town: for, although it contains several fa∣milies
who are considerably rich; yet a happy simplicity of
manners is still so predominant, that you would smile, if I
were to particularise those articles which pass under the op∣probrious
denomination of <HI>luxury.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="154"/>
THE lower rank of citizens are in general so strongly
prejudiced in favour of their own country, as to seem con∣vinced
that true felicity is only to be found at Basle: and
indeed that class of people are in no part of the world more
happy. Every person boasts that he is free, and is so in rea∣lity:
and, as the citizens not only possess very considerable
privileges and immunities, but each individual may also
indulge the hope of being one day chosen into the sovereign
council; he enjoys a certain degree of respect and considera∣tion
extremely flattering to his self-importance. In fact,
there are several among the magistrates who exercise the
meaner trades; and the present treasurer, whose name is
Muench, is a baker: he is indeed a person of distinguished
knowledge and merit; and has been twice appointed one of
the candidates for the office of great tribune; which, if
fortune had favoured him, would have been followed, on
the next vacancy, by his succession to the office of burgo∣master.</P>
<P>IN general the burghers sons receive an excellent edu∣cation:
they always learn the Latin, and not unfre∣quently
the Greek tongue; and it is by no means unu∣sual,
even for the lower sort of tradesmen, to employ
their leisure hours in the perusal of Horace, Virgil, and
Plutarch.</P>
<P>THE conduct of magistrates is no where more freely, nor
more severely, criticised than at Basle. The people may
sometimes, no doubt, extend this privilege beyond its proper
<PB N="136" REF="155"/>
limits; but they can never be totally restrained from exer∣cising
it, without striking at the vitals of their liberty: it is
essential to its existence, and no free government can long
survive its extinction.</P>
<P>BASLE is the largest, and seems formerly to have been
one of the most populous, towns in Switzerland: its extent is
capable of containing above a hundred thousand inhabi∣tants;
whereas it can scarcely number more than fourteen
thousand. Many particular causes may have concurred to
occasion this remarkable decrease of people; but I will men∣tion
only one or two reasons to which it may be assigned.
It is proved, from undoubted calculations, that, in all great
cities, the number of burials exceeds that of births; conse∣quently,
unless this unequal proportion is compensated by a
constant accession of new inhabitants, in process of time
every great town must necessarily become depopulated. Now
the citizens of Basle are so jealous of the burghership, and
pride themselves so much upon the privileges which ac∣company
it, that they seldom deign to confer it upon fo∣reigners:
a supply therefore to balance that gradual waste
of people I have mentioned, can never be derived from
an influx of strangers, where they are not permitted to
carry on commerce, or to follow any trade. A few years
ago, some of the magistrates, sensible of the impolicy at∣tending
this unlimited prohibition, procured a law, by
which the freedom of the town and the right of burgh∣ership
was allowed to be conferred upon strangers; but it
was clogged at the same time with so many restrictions, as
<PB N="137" REF="156"/>
by no means to answer the purpose for which it was in∣tended.
Every principle, indeed, of private interest and
ambition, concurred to prevent its efficacy: and no won∣der;
for, bodies of men are seldom actuated by so gene∣rous
a spirit as to sacrifice their personal and immediate
advantages, to the future welfare and prosperity of their
country.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">COMBAT AT THE HOSPITAL OF ST. JAMES, BETWEEN
THE FORCES OF LOUIS DAUPHIN OF FRANCE, AND
A CORPS OF SWISS TROOPS—RUINS OF AUGST—
MULHAUSEN.</HEAD>
<P>CURIOSITY led me, during my continuance at Basle,
to visit the hospital and burying-ground of St. James,
not far from the town, and near the small river Birs, cele∣brated
for a desperate combat, in 1444, between the Swiss
and the dauphin of France, afterwards Louis the Eleventh:
and never was Swiss valour and intrepidity so signally dis∣played,
as by a few battalions of their troops on that me∣morable
day.</P>
<P>THIS famous battle was fought in consequence of some
disputes, which arose between the canton of Zuric and those
of Schweitz and Glarus. Zuric refusing to abide by the
mediation of the five neutral cantons, who had decided in
favour of Schweitz and Glarus, a civil war ensued: upon
which occasion, Zuric formed an alliance with the emperor
Frederic the Third. The seven antient cantons, in order to
obtain a renunciation of this alliance, which they justly con∣sidered
as an infringement of their league, laid siege to that
town. Frederic, unable to send a sufficient body of troops to
its relief, applied for additional succours to Charles the
Seventh, king of France; who, as well with a view of dissolv∣ing
<PB N="139" REF="158"/>
the council of Basle, as for the particular purpose re∣quired,
ordered a considerable army to march, under the com∣mand
of his son Louis. Accordingly the dauphin entered
with his forces into Alsace; and, after laying waste and haras∣sing
the adjacent provinces, appeared before Basle. Upon
this occasion, a detachment of fifteen hundred Swiss from
the army of the confederates (at that time employed in be∣sieging
Farnspurg) were ordered to throw themselves into
the town of Basle, which was but slightly garrisoned.</P>
<P>THIS handful of men advanced without interruption to
the plain of Brattelen; where they charged, with such de∣termined
and well-conducted valour, eight thousand of the
enemy's cavalry, that the latter were driven back as far as
Muttenz; at which place the repulsed were joined by another
corps: but, notwithstanding this reinforcement, the Swiss
renewing the assault with fresh intrepidity, forced them to
repass the river Birs; where the main body of the army was
chiefly drawn up. Such was the firmness and solidity of the
Swiss in these several rencounters, that, to use the expression
of an old French chronicle, when the cavalry charged
“they could make no more impression, than if they had
attacked a rock, or an impenotrable wall.” The Swiss,
encouraged by this wonderful success, and exasperated with
the most spirited indignation against the invaders of their
country, disregarded the remonstrances of their officers, and
rashly attempted to force their passage over a bridge, which
was guarded by a large body of the enemy: but this effort of
inconsiderate valour proving ineffectual, these gallant sol∣diers,
throwing themselves into the river, gained the oppo∣site
<PB N="140" REF="159"/>
shore, in the face of a battery of cannon that was play∣ing
against them.</P>
<P>WHAT could the desperate courage of so small a number
avail, against an army of thirty thousand men advantageously
posted in an open plain? They had no alternative but either
to throw down their arms, or gloriously expire. They
bravely preferred the latter: accordingly five hundred took
possession of a small island near the bridge, and, after reso∣lutely
defending themselves to the last extremity, were cut
to pieces. A like number forced their way through the
ranks of the enemy, and were making towards Basle; when
they were opposed by a large body of horse, posted there to
prevent the inhabitants of the town from sallying to the re∣lief
of their countrymen. Being now surrounded on all
sides, they threw themselves into the hospital of St. James;
and, lining the walls of the burying-ground, resisted for some
time the united assaults of the whole French army. At
length the hospital being set on fire, and the cannon having
battered down the walls of the burying-ground, they fought
no longer in hopes of victory; but still resolving to sell their
lives as dear as possible, they continued to defend themselves
to the last gasp.</P>
<P>AENEAS SYLVIUS (afterwards pope Pius II.) relates, among
other actions of singular valour, exerted by this heroic troop,
a particular instance, which I cannot forbear mentioning.
Four French soldiers assaulted a single Swiss, and having killed
and stripped him, proceeded to insult the corpse: one of
his companions, incensed at this brutal action, seized a bat∣tle-ax,
<PB N="141" REF="160"/>
rushed upon the four, slew two of them, and drove
the others to flight; then flinging the dead body of his
friend upon his shoulders, carried it to a place of security;
and returning to the attack, fell by the hand of the enemy.
Of the whole number but sixteen escaped from the field of
battle; and these, agreeably to the old Spartan discipline,
were branded with infamy, for not having sacrificed their
lives in defence of their country. Among those who were
desperately wounded, and left upon the field of action, only
thirty-two were found alive. The names of many of these
glorious combatants were carefully registered, and still re∣main
upon record.</P>
<P>IT is not easy to ascertain the number of forces on both
sides in this ever-memorable engagement. As far as we can
judge, by comparing the several relations of the French and
German historians, the army of the dauphin consisted of at
least thirty thousand. Charles and his son Louis, in their
letters to the German princes on this occasion, assert, that
three thousand Swiss fell on the field of battle; and perhaps
that account is not much exaggerated. With respect to the
slain on the side of the dauphin, the amount is still more
uncertain: his loss, however, must have been very conside∣rable,
for he remained three days upon the field of battle;
and, the better to conceal the number of the killed, he
ordered the dead bodies to be secretly interred in different
parts of the neighbourhood. Add to this, that he was ef∣fectually
prevented from prosecuting his designs upon
Switzerland, and compelled to retire wich his shattered army
into Alsace. Louis himself, indeed, declared, that such
<PB N="142" REF="161"/>
another victory would ruin his army; and generously con∣fessed,
that he derived from it no other advantage, than to
know and esteem the valour of the Swiss. Accordingly,
this combat may be considered as forming a remarkable aera
in the history of the Swiss: for, it gave rise to their treaty
with Charles the Seventh, the first alliance which they con∣tracted
with France.</P>
<P>THE war, however, between the House of Austria and
Zuric on one side, and the seven cantons on the other, con∣tinued
until the year 1446, when a peace was concluded by
the mediation and decision of certain arbiters: Zuric re∣nounced
its connection with the House of Austria; and the
Helvetic Confederacy was again solemnly renewed and con∣firmed
between the eight cantons. Upon this occasion, two
very important articles in the public law of Switzerland,
were finally settled: First, that all disputes between any par∣ticular
cantons, should be decided by the mediation of the
neutral cantons; and if either of the two contending parties
should decline to acquiesce under their judgment, the neu∣tral
cantons are empowered to have recourse to arms, in
order to compel the recusant to abide by their determina∣tion:
Secondly, notwithstanding the right which either of
the cantons might have reserved to itself, of contracting alli∣ances
with foreign powers, yet the other confederates are to
judge, whether such alliance is contradictory to, or incom∣patible
with, the articles of the general union; and if it
should appear to be so, it is declared utterly null and void.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="162"/>
THE Swiss still talk of this famous action with the
warmest enthusiasm. Accordingly, the inhabitants of Basle
form parties every year, to an inn situated near the hospital
and burying-ground of St. James, in order to commemorate,
in a red wine produced from some vineyards planted on the
field of battle, the heroic deeds of their brave countrymen,
who so gloriously sacrificed their lives upon the occasion.
This wine, which they called the “<HI>Blood of the Swiss,</HI>” is
highly prized by the Basileans, though it has little to re∣commend
it in point of flavour; nevertheless, I am much
mistaken, if that famous line of Horace,
<Q>Non missura cutem nisi <HI>plena</HI> cruoris,</Q>
was more applicable to the teazing poet he mentions, than
it is to those jovial patriotic parties, at the anniversary com∣potations
of the “<HI>Blood of the Swiss.</HI>”</P>
<P>NEAR Basle are the ruins of <HI>Augusta Rauricorum,</HI> for∣merly
a large town under the dominion of the Romans, now
a small village in the canton of Basle, close to the Rhine.
Its antient remains are very inconsiderable, consisting of a
few columns of marble, still standing, and some scattered
fragments of pillars, together with a semicircular range of
walls upon a rising ground, the greatest part of which has
fallen, and is almost entirely overgrown with underwood.
From the present appearance of these ruins, I should hardly
have conjectured that they once composed part of a theatre,
capable of containing above twelve thousand spectators.
But the celebrated Schaefflin has given, in his <HI>Alsatia Illu∣strata,</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="163"/>
a particular description of this theatre, and of the
temple, to which the marble columns formerly belonged.
I noticed also the remains of some small aqueducts, which
conveyed water to the town from the distance of above
twelve miles: but none of these antient relics are sufficiently
remarkable to merit the trouble of a particular visit.</P>
<P>THE peasants, in turning up the ground where these
ruins are situated, frequently find medals of the Roman em∣perors,
from Augustus to Constantine; and are become, by
repeated experience, able to distinguish, with some degree of
precision, those that are rare from the more common coins.
I purchased of a labourer two medals, which he had just
found; a Trajan and an Albinus: and though the former
was by far the most perfect, yet he exacted three times as
much for the latter, because he had never seen it, he said,
before.</P>
<P>FROM Basle I made an excursion to Mulhausen, a town
in alliance with the Swiss cantons; which, though situated
at the distance of several miles from the frontiers of Switzer∣land,
and entirely enclosed within the dominions of France,
is yet considered and respected as a part of the Helvetic Con∣federacy;
and entitled to all the privileges enjoyed by that
body.</P>
<P>MULHAUSEN stands in Sundgau, a district of Alsace,
about fifteen miles from Basle; in a fertile plain, at the
bottom of a ridge of hills, and at a small distance from the
Voges. The walls of the town enclose a circumference of
<PB N="145" REF="164"/>
not more than two miles, and its whole territory is com∣prised
within a precinct of eight miles. This little republic
maintained its privileges, which had been granted by the
emperors, during the times of feudal tyranny, by contracting
an alliance, at different intervals, with Basle, Strasburgh, and
the towns of Alsace and Suabia; and afterwards, in the
middle of the fifteenth century, with Berne, Friburgh, and
Soleure. At length, in 1515, it was received into the Hel∣vetic
Confederacy; which league has preserved its liberty
and independence from the encroachments of the empire,
on one hand, and, on the other, from the attacks of France.
The inhabitants are of the Reformed religion. The town
contains about eight hundred houses, and six thousand souls,
and there are two thousand subjects in the villages within
its little territory. Mulhausen owes its present flourishing
state, to its manufactures, which consist principally of
printed linens and cottons. The government is aristo-demo∣cratical.
The supreme power resides in the Great and
Little Councils, consisting both together of seventy-eight
persons, and drawn from the burghers, whose number
amounts to seven hundred, distributed into six tribes.</P>
<P>Mr. Koehlin's commercial school deserves to be mention∣ed.
It is a private institution for about thirty scholars, who
are instructed in the German, French, and Latin languages;
in fencing, dancing, and all polite accomplishments; and
more particularly in accounts and book-keeping. The ex∣pence,
including an uniform, amounts to £. 50 <HI>per annum.</HI>
The plan is very judicious, and the whole appeared to me to
be well conducted.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 18.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BISHOPRIC OF BASLE—PORENTRU—ABBEY OF
BELLELAY—ARLESHEIM—DELMONT—VALLEY
OF MUNSTER—PIERRE PERTUIS—VALLEY OF
ST. IMER.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the greatest part of the dominions
subject to the Bishop of Basle, or as he is called by
the Protestants, the Prince of Porentru, is not comprised
within the limits of Switzerland; yet as, till lately, he was
in alliance with the Catholic cantons, and as many of his
subjects, even in those districts which lie within the German
empire, are comburghers with Berne, and under the pro∣tection
of that republic, his territory is usually included in
all the topographical accounts of Switzerland. It merits also
the notice of the traveller for its romantic scenes, of the
mineralogist for the variety of its petrifactions and fossils,
and of the politician for the peculiarity of its government,
and the numerous and complicated immunities of the
people.</P>
<P>HAVING made various excursions into this country, I
shall lay before you a general account of its political state,
and a particular description of those parts which I had an
opportunity of visiting.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="166"/>
THE bishopric of Basle may be classed under two general
divisions: the first lies to the south of Pierre Pertuis, and
forms a part of Switzerland; the second, to the north of the
same boundary, includes that district situated within the
German empire.</P>
<P>THE sovereign of this country is chosen by the chapter
of eighteen canons, resident at Arlesheim, and confirmed by
the pope. He is prince of the German empire; and does
homage to the emperor for that part of his territory which
lies in the Circle of the Upper Rhine. He was always con∣sidered
as an ally of the Swiss, by his union with the Catho∣lic
cantons, first formed in 1579, and renewed at different
intervals, particularly in 1671 and 1697; and by being in∣cluded
in the treaty which those cantons contracted with
France in 1715. But as he was not comprised among the
allies of the Swiss, in the league between the thirteen can∣tons
and Louis the Sixteenth, in 1777, he can at present
scarcely be esteemed a member of the Helvetic Confederacy.
The first particular alliance with France was concluded in
1739, between the bishop and Louis the Fifteenth; and
was renewed in 1780. By virtue of this treaty the bishop
has troops in the French service; and his subjects enjoy all
the privileges which are granted to the natives of the thir∣teen
cantons. In case of a rupture between France and the
Empire, he is bound to remain neuter. But this neutrallity
did not, in 1675, prevent the French troops from being
quartered in his dominions, as forming part of the empire;
and they were only removed at the intercession of the Ca∣tholic
cantons. If a misunderstanding should arise between
France and the Emperor, the bishop's situation would be ex∣tremely
<PB N="148" REF="167"/>
embarrassing; as his doubtful connection with the
Swiss would scarcely preserve his territory from being in∣vaded
by one of those two powers.</P>
<P>THE form of government is a limited sovereignty: the
bishop being bound, on all important occasions, to consult
his chapter; and his prerogative being confined by the
great immunities enjoyed by his subjects in general, and
particularly by those of the Reformed communion. He no∣minates
to all employments, both civil and military, and
appoints the bailifs or governors; penal justice is admini∣stered
in his name; and he has the power of pardoning cri∣minals.
In civil proceedings, he receives an appeal from
the inferior courts; but in his German dominions, when the
cause exceeds the value of a stipulated sum, it may be car∣ried
to the chambers of Wetzlar or Vienna. The subjects of
the bishop are partly Protestants and partly Catholics. The
Protestants, of whom a more particular account will be
given, inhabit the greatest part of the valley of Munster,
and the whole district to the south of Pierre Pertuis, and are
about 15,000; the Catholics amount to 35,000.</P>
<P>THE French and German languages being both spoken
in the bishop's dominions, several places have two names,
that scarcely resemble each other; namely, <HI>Munster</HI> and
<HI>Moitier, Dachfeld</HI> and <HI>Tavannes, Delmont</HI> and <HI>Delsberg, Cor∣randelin</HI>
and <HI>Rennendors, Elay</HI> and <HI>Seehof.</HI></P>
<P>PORENTRU, capital of the bishop's dominions, and his
principal residence, is situated in the bailliage of Elsgau,
about three miles from the frontiers of France. It is a
<PB N="149" REF="168"/>
small but neat town; and its position, in an oval plain, sur∣rounded
by well-wooded hills, and watered by a serpentine
rivulet, is exceedingly pleasant. The episcopal palace, which
has been lately repaired and augmented, stands on an emi∣nence
overlooking the town, and the environs fertile in
corn and pasture. One of the towers, built of stone, and
said to be of Roman workmanship, still remains a monu∣ment
of its antiquity.</P>
<P>THE high roads, which lead from all quarters to Poren∣tru,
and have been formed at a considerable expence, do
honour to the sovereigns of this country. The way to Bel∣lelay
and Bienne, is a magnificent causeway: it traverses a
mountainous district; is carried over hanging terraces;
through “twilight groves,” and along continued acclivities
and declivities. I pursued the latter part by moonlight;
and the reflection of the rays quivering through the thick
foliage was inconceivably beautiful. Bellelay, which I
visited in my journey from Bienne to Porentru, is a rich
abbey of Benedictines, about twenty miles from the capital,
in a solitary but not unpleasant situation, surrounded by
mountains, and sheltered by forests. This abbey is not
merely confined to religious purposes; the late abbot,
Nicholas de Luce, having instituted a military academy for
the young nobility and gentry. For this purpose he erected
a large building near the abbey, and provided suitable
masters and professors. When I was at Bellelay, the number
of scholars amounted to forty. They are instructed in
various branches of polite literature; they wear uniforms;
and are trained to military manoeuvres and exercises. The
<PB N="150" REF="169"/>
cheapness of this school, and its distance from the dissi∣pation
of large towns, renders it of great public utility.
The whole expence of each scholar, for his board, lodging,
instruction, and various lessons, scarcely exceeds £. 20 <HI>per
annum.</HI> It is curious to find a military academy established
in the midst of rocks and forests, and within the walls of a
convent; and to observe Benedictine friars, instead of wast∣ing
their time in monkish ignorance and supersitition, ren∣dering
themselves beneficial to society.</P>
<P>THE chapter, composed of eighteen canons, who, upon a
vacancy in the see, possess the right of electing the bishop,
was fixed at Friburgh in Brisgau from the period of the re∣formation,
which drove them from Basle, to 1677, when
Friburgh was occupied by the French troops. In the fol∣lowing
year the chapter was transferred to Arlesheim,
where it now resides. The vacant canonries are filled al∣ternately
by the pope and chapter.</P>
<P>ON the 14th of August 1786, I made an excursion, in
company with several friends, to Arlesheim, which is a small
but agreeably situated place, almost four miles from Basle.
We had the honour of dining with the Baron de Ligertz,
one of the canons. After a repast, no less elegant than agree∣able,
our host politely accompanied us to a garden styled
The Hermitage, about a quarter of a mile from Arlesheim;
which was laid out at the joint expence of the baron and of
Madame d'Andlau, the bailif's lady, with a view to employ
the poor in a time of great scarcity, and to provide walks for
the inhabitants of the town. The grounds are very exten∣sive;
<PB N="151" REF="170"/>
and pleasant. The walks are carried along the sides
of the rocks, which are richly wooded, and through a de∣lightful
semicircular plain, bounded by fertile hills, and wa∣tered
by a small lake, the borders of which are peculiarly
wild and picturesque. Several caverns, hollowed and arched
by the hand of nature, add to the romantic singularity of the
scenery; while many transparent streams, conveyed from a
considerable distance, fall in small cascades, or bubble from
the ground like real springs. A fastidious observer might
perhaps remark of this enchanting spot, that in a few cir∣cumstances
nature has been too much sacrificed to art; and
that there are some buildings less calculated to please than to
surprise. The following elegant inscription for this charm∣ing
hermitage was extemporarily composed by professor
Oberlin of Strasburgh, one of our party.</P>

<P>I SHALL close this letter with an account of my journey
from Basle to Bienne, through the vallies of Lauffen, Del∣mont,
Munster, and St. Imier, a tract of country in the
bishopric of Basle, which is not inferior in beauty to the
most delightful parts of Switzerland.</P>
<P>WE quitted Basle early in the morning; and passed
through a fertile plain watered by the Birs, and bounded by
<PB N="152" REF="171"/>
two chains of the Jura; one whereof terminates abruptly,
supporting on its summit the castle of Wertenburgh. As
we continued our route, the plain gradually narrowed; the
mountains approached each other; and we entered the rich
valley of Lauffen, enclosed between the rocks, sprinkled
with groves of oak and beech, exhibiting many romantic
points of view. Lauffen, which gives name to the valley,
has its own magistrates, and inferior courts of justice. The
natives are industrious: those who are not employed in agri∣culture,
gain a comfortable livelihood from making cloth,
spinning yarn, and knitting worsted stockings. The inhabi∣tants
of the valley talk German, and those of Sautier, a small
neighbouring village, French, which language is spoken
through the vallies of Delmont, Munster, and St. Imier.
About three leagues from Lauffen we came to a narrow pass,
entered the valley of Delmont, near Sautier; quitted the
high road, and gently ascended to Delmont, which stands
pleasantly on an acclivity, backed by a ridge of rocks em∣browned
with firs.</P>
<P>IN this small town reside the provost and canons, who
compose the chapter formerly established at Munster;
which was removed here, in 1630, on the introduction of the
Reformed religion in the valley of Munster. At the extre∣mity
of the town is the episcopal palace, built in 1718, by
Conrad Baron of Reinach, and bishop of Basle: it com∣mands
a sine view of the adjacent country. The bailif, who
holds his court in this town, has jurisdiction over the valleys
of Delmont and Munster. In criminal proceedings he ar∣rests
and examines; and can inflict small penalties for tri∣fling
misdemeanors; but in all cases of notoriety, the delin∣quent
<PB N="153" REF="172"/>
is either tried at Porentru, or the bailif's sentence must
be confirmed or amended in that supreme tribunal. Civil
causes are first adjudged in the provincial courts; from
whose decision an appeal lies to the episcopal tribunal at
Porentru; and from thence to the imperial chambers of
Wetzlar or Vienna. Delmont contains eight hundred inha∣bitants,
who are all Catholics: they have their own magis∣trates
and inferior tribunals.</P>
<P>ABOUT a mile from Delmont I stopped at Corrandelin, a
small village in the Catholic district of the valley of Munster,
in order to examine an iron foundery belonging to the
bishop. The ore is drawn from the valley of Delmont, near
the villages of Corou, Wick, Recolens, and Sepres; it is
taken from the ground in small pieces, seldom larger than
the size of a pea. The director informed me that it is
usually found in that state, and very rarely in masses. The
largest he ever remembered to have seen, was ten feet long,
two thick, and two broad. He added, that the mountains in
the neighbourhood abound with ore, which would yield
considerable quantities of iron, if sufficient charcoal could be
procured for the smelting furnaces. As he was but lately
appointed director, he could not give any accurate intelli∣gence
concerning the annual quantity of iron smelted in
this foundery; but informed me, in general, that the differ∣ent
ores yielded altogether two thirds of pure mineral, the
quality whereof was extremely sine, and scarcely inferior to
the best iron exported from Sweden.</P>
<P>CORRANDELIN, together with the villages of Chatillon,
Rossemaison, Vellerat, Courchappois, Corbaon, Mervellier,
<PB N="154" REF="173"/>
and Elay, though connected as to ecclesiastical affairs with
the valley of Delmont, form that part of the valley of Mun∣ster,
which is called the <HI>Catholic,</HI> or <HI>Lower</HI> District. It is de∣nominated
the <HI>Catholic</HI> District, because the inhabitants are
exclusively of the Romish church; and <HI>Lower</HI> District, be∣cause
it is situated <HI>unter den felsen,</HI> or <HI>below</HI> the ridge of
rocks which separate it from the <HI>Upper,</HI> or <HI>Protestant</HI> Dis∣trict.
But before I proceed further, it will be necessary to
describe the general divisions of this valley, and the civil and
religious immunities of the natives, that you may be enabled
to comprehend its complicated topography, and its curious
political state, by which, though subject to the bishop of
Basle, it is under the protection of the canton of Berne.</P>
<P>THE valley of Munster, or Moitier, extends from the
valley of Delmont to Pierre Pertuis; and is included in that
part of the bishop's dominions which lie within the Ger∣man
empire. But, as the inhabitants have, for above three
hundred years, been in alliance with Berne, and under the
protection of that republic, the valley is considered by many
authors as forming part of Switzerland. It is divided into
two principal districts; the <HI>Catholic</HI> or <HI>Lower</HI> District, which
lies at the extremity of the valley of Delmont, and comprises
the eight villages above-mentioned; the <HI>Protestant</HI> or <HI>Upper</HI>
District, which stretches from the chain of rocks near Cor∣randelin,
to Pierre Pertuis, its southern boundary; and con∣taining,
1. The Greater Valley, or Valley of Tavannes;
and 2. The Lesser Valley, which is subdivided into Grand-Val,
or the Great-Valley, and the Little Valley, or the Valley
of Sornetan.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="174"/>
THE inhabitants of both districts are comburghers with
the canton of Berne. The first treaty of comburghership was
contracted in 1484. In that year, Berne and the bishop of
Basle respectively supporting two candidates for the provost∣ship
of Munster; the former marched an army into these
parts, took possession of the whole valley, and exacted ho∣mage
from the inhabitants. These disputes being compro∣mised
at the treaty of Corrandelin, Berne restored the valley
to the bishop on the following conditions: that the inha∣bitants
should be maintained in all their privileges; con∣tinue
as comburghers with Berne, under the protection
of that republic; remain neuter in case of a war be∣tween
Berne and the bishop; and follow the standard of
Berne, when the latter was engaged in hostilities against any
other power. This treaty of comburghership, renewed at
different intervals, has excited frequent disputes between
Berne and the bishop, and particularly in 1705 and 1711 oc∣casioned
an open rupture. These disputes were finally ad∣justed
at the pacification of Arau; when the bishop ratified
the treaty of comburghership, confirmed all the rights and
immunities of the inhabitants, and consented to the media∣tion
and interference of Berne.</P>
<P>THE affairs of religion excited for some time no less con∣test
between the bishop and Berne than the treaty of com∣burghership.
The reformation being adopted, in 1531, by a
considerable number of the inhabitants in the valley of Mun∣ster,
civil commotions ensued; Berne intersered in behalf of
the Protestants, and the bishop protected the antient church
<PB N="156" REF="175"/>
establishment. It was at length, amicably settled between
both parties; that the majority of each parish should
freely decide, whether the inhabitants should profess the
Roman Catholic or the Reformed religion; and that the
chapter of Munster should continue to receive the tythes, on
condition of discharging the salaries of the Protestant minis∣ters.
In consequence of this rational compromise, the eight
villages, which now form the <HI>Lower</HI> district, voted for the
maintenance of the Catholic religion; and the parishes of
the Upper district for the Reformed church. Accordingly
the two persuasions were respectively established in these
two districts; the chapter retained its estates and tythes, but
quitting Munster, where the new doctrines were admitted,
retired first to Soleure, and afterwards settled at Delmont:
but, as several Protestants and Catholics continued promis∣cuously
to inhabit the two districts, disturbances were occa∣sionally
renewed. Nor were the religious differences en∣tirely
composed till the peace of Arau; which enjoined, that
all the members of the two persuasions should be finally se∣parated;
that all the inhabitants of the <HI>Upper</HI> district, who
then professed or should hereafter profess the Catholic reli∣gion,
should retire to Elay; and that in the same manner
the Protestants in the <HI>Lower</HI> district should remove to the
<HI>Upper</HI> district. Since this period, the most perfect harmony
has subsisted between them.</P>
<P>BY virtue of the alliance with Berne, that republic an∣nually
deputes one of its magistrates to this valley, for the
purpose of inquiring if the civil and religious immunities
<PB REF="176"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="157" REF="177"/>
have been preserved inviolate; and an ecclesiastic: the latter,
called inspector of the churches in the valley of Munster, ex∣amines
into the state of ecclesiastical discipline; and distri∣butes
among the inhabitants of the <HI>Upper</HI> district catechisms
and psalters. Berne also approves the nomination of the
ministers to the vacant benefices, some of whom are ap∣pointed
and paid by the bishop, others by the chapters of
Delmont and Bellelay; as the bishop or chapters possess the
tythes in the respective parishes.</P>
<P>BUT to return from this digression.—Soon after quitting
Corrandelin, I entered the <HI>Protestant</HI> district, through a pass
between two rocks, which nearly approach each other, and
just leave an opening sufficient for the Birs and the road.
This pass leads into a narrow glen, about four miles in
length, and in many places almost resembling a subterrane∣ous
abyss. The road winds by the side of the impetuous Birs,
and at the bottom of two ranges of rocks: these rocks are of
white limestone, of inaccessible height; and though in most
places absolutely perpendicular, yet are agreeably feathered
with trees, and particularly towards their summits, which
overhang, and scarcely admit the light of the sun. In the
midst of this glen is La Roche, the first Protestant village in
the valley of Munster; the houses whereof stand on both sides
of the Birs, where the rocks recede a little, and present a
gentle slope. On issuing from this glen, we entered a fertile
plain encircled by hills, in the midst of which is situated the
village of Munster or Moitier: it takes that appellation from
the chapter of canons, who upon the reformation, quitted
<PB N="158" REF="178"/>
this place of their residence and settled themselves at
Delmont.</P>
<P>ABOUT half a mile from Munster we came into another
glen, near three miles in length: it is called <HI>Chaluet,</HI> of a
similar nature with that which we traversed between Cor∣randelin
and the plain of Munster, but still wilder and more
craggy, deeper and more obscure. It is also divided by the
Birs, which rushes through it with great impetuosity; and is
so narrow, that the road occupies the whole space between
the torrent and the mountain, and the wheels of our car∣riage
frequently on one side brushed the rock, and on the
other ran close to the precipice which overhangs the river.
This causeway, over broken crags and steep precipices, does
honour to the prince who carried it into execution. The
following inscription, which I observed near a bridge in the
midst of this obscure glen, may perhaps seem exaggerated,
to a person unacquainted with the natural impediments of
the country; but to me, on the spot, appeared strictly conso∣nant
to truth.</P>

ALTHOUGH in various parts of Switzerland I had fre∣quently
observed the justness of the remark, that in all deep
vallies which intersect the mountains, the salient angles on
one side alternately correspond with the cavities on the
other; and that parallel strata of rock answer to each other,
in all directions and at all heights; yet I never saw this fact
more strongly exemplified than in the two ridges of lime∣stone
that border this glen. They are of a stupendous
height; and the strata horizontal, inclined, or almost per∣pendicular
on one side, are exactly similar and of the same
thickness on the other: a circumstance, which, joined to the
corresponding situation of the angles, seems to prove, that
they were formerly united, and have been either rent asun∣der
by some sudden convulsion, or separated by the gradual
attrition of the waters. At the extremity of the Chaluet we
entered another plain, well cultivated, and agreeably spotted
with villages; and arrived towards the close of the evening
at Molleray, where we passed the night. The people in these
parts appear happy and contented, and are extremely indus∣trious.
The greatest part are employed in agriculture; a
few, encouraged by their neighbours of Locle and Chaux de
Fond, have lately introduced several trades into these moun∣tains;
and Belleval, a small neighbouring village, already
contains five watchmakers.</P>
<P>FROM Molleray we continued along a fertile plain by the
side of the Birs; through several pleasant and well-looking
villages, of which Tavannes, in German <HI>Dachseld,</HI> is the
largest. In about two miles we arrived at the extremity of
the plain, which is closed by a rock, through which opens
<PB N="160" REF="180"/>
the celebrated pass called <HI>Pierre Pertuis.</HI> At the bottom of
this rock, the Birs bursts from the ground in several copious
springs, and turns two mills within a few paces of its princi∣pal
source.</P>
<P><HI>Pierre Pertuis</HI> is a large arched aperture through a solid
rock, about thirty feet long, forty-five broad, and thirty
high in the lowest part, which some aver to have been
formed by nature, others by art. A Roman inscription over
the arch, extremely defaced, has given sufficient employ∣ment
to the ingenuity of antiquaries. Having seen several
fac-similes, greatly differing from each other, I copied it as
exactly as the height would permit.</P>

<HI>per montem durvum,</HI> some antiquarians have en∣deavoured
to prove, that he cut through the rock; and
consequently, that the arch is the work of art, not of nature:
while others maintain, that it by no means follows, even
from this reading, that the rock was pierced by order of Pa∣ternus;
but merely that the road was carried through the
rock<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader, who wishes to examine this subject with attention, is referred to Schaefflin's <HI>Alsatia Illustrata,</HI> and to a dissertation on the subject published by Buxtorf.</NOTE>. Not to detain you, however, with fanciful con∣jectures,
I shall only add, that on examining the inscription
with attention, the words which antiquarians have supplied,
to support their particular systems, are extremely doubtful;
and that to me, who observed the arch without partiality or
prejudice in favour of any hypothesis, it appeared to have
been originally a great cavern, either totally formed by
nature, or if assisted by art, that only a small part of its
southern extremity was opened by the labour of man.</P>
<P>THE southern extremity of <HI>Pierre Pertuis</HI> leads into the
valley of St. Imier, sometimes called Enguel, which com∣prises
the bishop's dominions lying in Switzerland. The in∣habitants
are Protestants, and governed by a bailif appointed
by the bishop. He resides at Courtelari; but his authority
is exceedingly limited by the various privileges, both civil
and religious, possessed by the natives. Their religious im∣munities
confirmed by the bishop, are guarantied by the
four Reformed cantons. The whole district lies within the
Jura mountains; and is fertile in pasture. The inhabi∣tants
are industrious. On arriving on the extremity of
<PB N="162" REF="183"/>
mount Jura, a glorious prospect bursts upon the view, com∣manding
the undulating country fertilised by the Aar,
backed by the majestic chain of Alps extending beyond the
frontiers of Savoy. Descending gently into the plain with
this glorious prospect before us, and which was heightened
by the luminous splendour of the mid-day sun, we crossed
the Sure, and finished our delightful expedition at Bienne.
From Pierre Pertuis to Bienne, a superb causeway is carried
along a continual descent for about six miles; it winds
through thick forests, and over-hangs the deep abyss, in
which the Sure, a turbid and impetuous torrent, precipi∣tates
its course, always roaring, and frequently unseen, in its
rocky channel.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 19.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE TOWN OF BIENNE.</HEAD>
<P>THE small territory of Bienne, containing scarcely six
thousand inhabitants, lies between the lake and a
chain of the Jura mountains: it is surrounded by the
cantons of Berne and Soleure, the bishopric of Basle, and
the principality of Neuchatel. The town is situated at the
foot of the Jura, and at a little distance from the lake; which
is here about nine miles in length, and four in breadth:
the borders are pleasing and picturesque; and the town
of Nidau forms a very beautiful object upon its eastern
side.</P>
<P>THE bishop of Basle is the sovereign of this little state: his
power, formerly considerable, is at present exceedingly li∣mited.
Indeed the constitution of Bienne is of so very peculiar
a nature, that I know not well by what name it can be distin∣guished:
it cannot properly be called either a limited mo∣narchy,
or an independent republic; but seems rather to be
a mixed government, partaking somewhat of both. The
bishop of Basle receives, upon his promotion to the see,
the homage of the citizens and militia of this town, with all
the apparent ceremonials of the most absolute submission;
but at the same time, he confirms, in the strongest manner,
all their privileges and franchises. He is represented by a
mayor of his own appointing, whose power and office
<PB N="164" REF="185"/>
consist in convoking, and presiding in, the Little Council,
as the chief court of justice; in collecting the suffrages,
and declaring the sentence; but without giving any vote
himself. And, although justice is carried on, and executed,
in the name of the bishop, yet neither that prince nor the
mayor, has the prerogative of pardoning criminals, or of
mitigating the sentence. All causes, civil as well as criminal,
are brought before this council in the first instance; and in
more important proceedings, an appeal lies to the Sovereign
Council: in both cases, each party chooses a member of
the council to act as his advocate; which office he is obliged
to discharge without see or recompence.</P>
<P>THE sovereign's revenue amounts only to about £. 300
a year: but, mean as his civil list is, it is still more consider∣able
than his power; for he does not possess the least share
of the administration. The legislative authority resides in
the Great and Little Councils combined: the former consists
of forty members; and the latter, in which the executive
power is vested, is composed of twenty-four; the members
of each must be married men. Both these councils elect
their respective members; and so far the constitution is
entirely aristocratical. The burgomaster, or chief of the re∣gency,
is chosen by the two councils, and presides at their
meetings. He continues in office during life; in which,
however, he, as well as the several magistrates, must be
confirmed annually by the two councils. The salaries an∣nexed
to these posts are exceedingly moderate: and, indeed,
the general expences of government are so very small, that,
in proportion to them, its revenues may well be considered
as abundantly ample.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="186"/>
IT appears, therefore, that this Protestant republic, not∣withstanding
the sovereignty of its Catholic bishop, enjoys in
the fullest extent the power of imposing taxes, contracting
alliances, declaring war and peace; and, in short, of exer∣cising
every other act of absolute and independent legisla∣tion.
This singular constitution is guarantied by Berne,
Friburgh, and Soleure, with whom the town is closely allied;
in consequence of which, it becomes a member of the Hel∣vetic
Confederacy. And, what is somewhat remarkable,
this alliance between those cantons and the town of Bienne,
is of a superior nature to that of the same cantons with the
bishop of Basle: for the town enjoys the right of sending
deputies to every general diet, ordinary and extraordinary;
whereas the bishop does not possess the same privilege. The
language of the country is a provincial German; but, as the
territory borders upon the principality of Neuchatel, the in∣habitants
speak also a kind of corrupted French. They are
a very active and industrious people: several manufactures
are established in the town, which, considering its size, car∣ries
on a tolerable trade.</P>
<P>I HAVE often had occasion to observe, that the common
people of Switzerland are far more intelligent than the same
rank of men in any other country. Accordingly, I invited
last night my landlord of the Crown inn to sup with me;
and found him by no means disposed to be a silent guest.
He gave me a long account of the late ceremony, when the
citizens did homage to their new bishop. I was pleased to
hear him expatiate, with all the enthusiasm of national pride,
<PB N="166" REF="187"/>
upon the beauty and grandeur of the scene; the magnifi∣cence
of the procession; the number of spectators, as well
strangers as natives, who were assembled; together with the
entertainments and balls that were given upon that occasion.
By the lofty terms in which he spoke of this procession, you
would have imagined, at least, that he had been describing
the coronation of the emperor of Germany, or the king of
France: and, in truth, to an inhabitant of Bienne, whose go∣vernment
is administered without the least degree of external
pomp, and where luxury has as yet made but little progress,
the ceremony must have appeared a very striking spectacle.
My host's narrative recalled to my remembrance the accounts
of those antient feudal sovereignties, when the great vassals
of the crown did homage to their liege lord; and, while in
<HI>terms</HI> they promised him unlimited obedience, maintained,
in <HI>fact,</HI> every essential of independence.</P>
<P>I HAVE just been amusing myself in some pleasant walks,
that lie by the side of the lake, which is here prettily skirted
with country houses. In my way I passed over a plain be∣tween
the town and the lake, which the Sovereign Council,
by a kind of agrarian law that does honour to the legislature,
lately allotted, in distinct portions, to each burgher, for his
own particular use: it is entirely laid out in little kitchen-gardens.
The general government, indeed, of this minia∣ture
state, is well administered. It has lately adopted the
liberal policy of conferring the burghership at an easy rate:
a wise regulation, which cannot fail of increasing the popu∣lation
of the town, and extending its commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="188"/>
I KNOW your sentiments much too well, my dear sir, to
apologize for calling your attention in the present instance,
as in some others, to these diminutive commonwealths. The
various modifications of government, into which civil society
is divided, is a speculation that will always afford matter both
of entertainment and reflection, to a philosophic mind: and
I am persuaded, that you consider the meanest spot of this
globe consecrated by liberty, to be an object worthy, not only
of your curiosity, but your veneration.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE TOWN AND CANTON OF SOLEURE—DETAIL OF
THE GOVERNMENT—ANTIENT AND NEW BURGH∣ERS—
ASSEMBLY OF THE ROSENGARTEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE direct road from Basle to Soleure lies through the
midst of the Jura mountains, along the romantic vale
of Balstal, remarkable for its richness and fertility: and
though the country is in general exceedingly rocky, yet in
many places it is highly cultivated. The road from Bienne
to Soleure traverses a well-cultivated valley, watered by the
Aar, at the foot of a piked ridge, which forms a branch of
mount Jura; its sides, from the bottom to the summit, are so
embrowned with overhanging forests of pine and fir, as to
exhibit only occasional intervals of naked rock, remains of
torrents, and a few solitary specks of pasture, and are so
steep as, within the extent of five leagues, scarcely to display
the appearance of a single house, or a trace of the slightest
foot-way. Near Soleure this chain of the Jura, called <HI>Weis∣senstein,</HI>
abruptly diminishes in height, becomes gradually
sloping, and is checkered to its very summit with fields of
corn and pasture.</P>
<P>SOLEURE is pleasantly situated upon the Aar, which here
expands its banks and opens into a fine and broad river. I
will not exert the privilege of a traveller, and tell you, what
some extravagant antiquaries do not scruple to assert, that
<PB N="169" REF="190"/>
Soleure was built by the patriarch Abraham; but you will
have no difficulty, perhaps, in believing what others main∣tain,
that it was one of the twelve towns which were de∣stroyed
upon the emigration of the original inhabitants into
Gaul. It appears also probable, from a great number of in∣scriptions,
medals, and other antiquities, which have been
found in the neighbourhood, that it was re-peopled by a Ro∣man
colony; and it certainly was a Roman fortification, as its
antient appellation, <HI>Castrum Salodurenese,</HI> necessarily implies.
Little more of its history is known, during that period of
ignorance and barbarism which succeeded the downfal of the
Roman empire, than that it was sacked and destroyed by
those northern nations, who over-ran the greatest part of Eu∣rope.
From the time of its re-establishment, until its admis∣sion
into the Helvetic Confederacy in 1481, its state was simi∣lar
to that of many other imperial towns, which acquired a
gradual accession of territory, and after various struggles
finally secured to themselves an absolute independence.</P>
<P>SOLEURE is a small but extremely neat town, and is sur∣rounded
by regular stone fortifications, erected in the begin∣ning
of the present century; these walls enclose a circumfe∣rence
of scarcely more than fifty square acres, and, including
the suburbs, contain about four thousand souls. Among the
most remarkable objects of curiosity in the town is the new
church of St. Urs, which was begun in 1762, and finished
in 1772. It is a noble edifice, of whitish-grey stone, drawn
from the neighbouring quarries, which admits a polish, and
is a species of rude marble. The lower part of the building
is of the Corinthian, the upper of the Composite order: the
<PB N="170" REF="191"/>
façade, which consists of a portico, surmounted by an ele∣gant
tower, presents itself finely at the extremity of the
principal street. Pizoni was the architect, and the expence
amounted to at least £. 80,000; a considerable sum for so
small a republic, whose revenues scarcely surpass £. 12,000
<HI>per annum.</HI> The interior is simple yet elegant, and deco∣rated
with a few modern paintings of inconsiderable merit;
of which the most esteemed is the Last Supper, by Corvi, a
Roman artist. A picture by Rubens and his scholars, in the
church of the Cordeliers, and one by Le Sueur, in that of
the Capuchins, deserve perhaps to be noticed by the travel∣ler,
who is fond of the fine arts. The town-house is not in
itself worthy of observation, but is mentioned only as being
the place of meeting for the Great Council and Senate.
The public prison, newly constructed, is a solid edifice of
stone, and is well adapted to the purpose of the building; the
prisoners being confined in separate cells. Although the penal
laws are severe in theory, yet the judicial sentences, in cri∣minal
affairs, are so remarkably mild, that a prisoner, on his
acquittal, wrote the following inscription on the wall of his
cell: “He who is inclined to rob, and escape hanging, let
him rob in the canton of Soleure.”</P>
<P>THE public library deserves to be mentioned, not for the
number or rarity of the volumes, but for the literary zeal of
the Abbé Herman, canon of the cathedral, to whom it owes
its origin. On my first visit to this town, in 1776, there was
no public collection of books; but a few years ago that in∣genious
ecclesiastic amassed about four hundred volumes from
his own and his friends stock, obtained from government
<PB N="171" REF="192"/>
an apartment in the town-house, where he deposited them,
and requested to be appointed librarian, but without a salary.
His petition being granted, he continued to augment his
little collection; and from this small beginning has increased
it already to eleven thousand books, among which are above
a hundred and fifty printed in the fifteenth century. At the
two extremities of the room are inscribed the names of the
benefactors to this library. As yet there is no fund
established for the support or augmentation of this collec∣tion.
The Abbé has also begun to form a cabinet of medals;
which, though at present extremely small, will increase like
the library. He pointed out to me a very rare medal, that
was discovered in digging the foundation for the new cathe∣dral.
It is in bronze, of the middle size. On one side is the
head of Septimius Severus, with the following inscription,
<HI>L. Septimius Severus Pius Aug. P. M. Tr. P. xviii. Cos. iii.
P. P.</HI> On the reverse, a figure sitting, before it a prow of a
ship, and a genius or little boy. Great merit is due to the
Abbé for having given birth to this collection, at first alone
and unsupported, and in so disinterested a manner, as his in∣come
does not exceed £. 60 <HI>per annum;</HI> and in a town
where literature is not much encouraged. This learned
ecclesiastic is now employed in writing an account of Soleure
at the period of the Reformation; and is collecting ample
materials for a complete history of the canton. With respect
to natural history, the only cabinet in the town is that
formed by Senator Wallier: it is a small collection, but well
chosen, and particularly interesting to the naturalist who
travels into these parts, because the ingenious collector has
<PB REF="193"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="172" REF="194"/>
chiefly confined himself to the minerals and petrifactions of
the canton.</P>
<P>THE circumjacent country is exceedingly pleasing and
diversified, and exhibits several points of view, which are as
agreeable as wild, and as pleasing as romantic. Among
these we were particularly struck with the situation of the
hermitage called des Croix, about half a mile from the town,
near the stone quarry: it is a most agreeable recess at the ex∣tremity
of a small wood, and between two ridges of bare
perpendicular rocks, watered by a lively stream; one extre∣mity
is closed by a small wood, and the other opens into
fertile grounds backed by the dark Jura. Among the villas,
in the environs, remarkable for their position, may be men∣tioned
Ricaberg, built by Mr. de Vigur; it stands at the bot∣tom
of a gentle hill, declining towards the winding Aar, and
commands a view of Soleure, half hid by the intervening
trees; and Bleikenberg, belonging to Major de Roll, situated
amid waving grounds divided into enclosures, similar to the
fertile counties of England; the dark Jura rising like the
highlands of Scotland; and at a distance the sublime alps,
which characterise this romantic country.</P>
<P>THE canton of Soleure, which holds the eleventh rank in
the Helvetic Confederacy, stretches partly through the plain,
and partly along the chains of the Jura, and contains about
50,000 souls, including the inhabitants of the capital. The
soil is, for the most part, exceedingly fertile in corn, and
those districts which lie within the Jura, abound in excellent
<PB N="173" REF="195"/>
pastures. The trade, both of the town and of the canton, is
of little value, although they are very commodiously
situated for an extensive commerce. It is divided into
eleven districts or bailliages, called Interior and Exterior;
the former are governed by bailifs, who are senators, and
remain in the towns: the latter, by bailifs drawn from the
members of the Great Council, who reside in their bail∣liages.</P>

<P>THE inhabitants of the canton are Catholics, except∣ing
those in the bailliage of Buckegberg, who profess
the Reformed religion. In spiritual affairs, the Catholics
depend on three bishops: the greatest part of the capi∣tal,
the bailliages of Laeberen and Flamenthal, are in the
diocese of the bishop of Lausanne, resident at Friburg; the
remainder of the capital, the bailliage of Kriegstetten, and
the villages in the bailliage of Olten, in that of the bishop of
Constance; while the other bailliages, and the town of Olten,
depend on the bishop of Basle. But neither of these bishops
<PB N="174" REF="196"/>
can issue any ordinance, or even visit their dioceses, without
the approbation of the Senate. There are two chapters in
this canton; one at Soleure, founded, in 930, by Queen Ber∣tha,
widow of Rhodolph II. King of Burgundy, is composed
of a provost, whose salary amounts to £. 360 <HI>per annum;</HI>
and of eleven canons, each of whom enjoys a revenue of
£. 160. The provost is chosen by the Senate, and the canons
are appointed alternately by the Pope and Senate. The
other chapter, of Schoenenwerth, founded by the antient
counts of Falkenstein, consists of a provost and five canons,
nominated by the Senate. The annual salary of the provost
is £. 125, and of each canon £. 100. There are also one
abbey of Benedictines, four convents, and three nunneries:
the revenues of these religious houses amount to £. 2,250.
The principal charitable institutions are, an hospital at
Soleure, and another at Olten, for the reception of burghers,
subjects, and foreigners; the foundation of Thurigan, for
old persons of both sexes, belonging to the burghership; a
foundling hospital for orphans, and for children of poor
burghers; and the hospital of St. Catharine, for the insane
and incurables.</P>
<P>THE only persons in the canton of Soleure, who profess
the Reformed religion, are those who inhabit the bailliage
of Buckegberg. In ecclesiastical affairs, the inhabitants,
though subject to Soleure, are under the protection of Berne.
Formerly this complication of political and religious interests
created frequent misunderstandings between the two can∣tons,
but matters were amicably and finally adjusted, on the
18th of November 1681, at the treaty of Winingen. The
<PB N="175" REF="197"/>
inhabitants take the oath of fidelity, every third year, to the
government of Soleure; but if aggrieved in their religious
establishment, can have recourse to Berne. The Senate of
Berne nominates to the vacant benefices, but the priests
are under the necessity of obtaining the confirmation of the
chapter of Soleure. A deputy from Berne presents the new
minister to his parishioners; but the bailif is obliged to be
present at this ceremony, as deputy from the republic of
Soleure. Berne enjoys also supreme jurisdiction in criminal
affairs. If a criminal is arrested for any capital offence, he
is tried by the bailif of Buckegberg, and the jury of the
bailliage: and, if condemned to death, he is delivered for
execution to Berne, provided that republic defrays the ex∣pence
of the trial. Soleure enjoys all the other rights of
sovereignty; such as the power of levying taxes, appeals in
the last resort; and even decides all matrimonial and eccle∣siastical
concerns, with this proviso, that the decision shall
be regulated according to the articles of the treaty of Wi∣ningen.
Among the natives in the canton, several inhabit∣ing
the bailliages of Thierstein and Gildenberg, were serfs,
but, in 1785, their servitude, so contrary to the principles
of that equal liberty which pervades this country, was
abolished, to the honour of the present government.</P>
<P>THE canton furnishes France with two companies for
the Swiss guards, and several companies in the different
marching regiments, according to the capitulation concluded
between the King of France and the Catholic cantons, and
their co-allies, in 1764, for the term of twenty-five years.
It has also a regiment in the Spanish service; of which the
<PB N="176" REF="198"/>
colonel and the companies of fusileers can be filled only by
the <HI>antient</HI> burghers. With respect to the militia of the
canton, all the subjects, from the age of fifteen to that of
sixty, are enrolled into six regiments, forming altogether
about 8000 men, exclusive of 240 dragoons, and the corps
of artillery, amounting to 600 men. The colonel of each
regiment is always a senator, and the major a member of
the Great Council, who is usually an officer retired from
foreign service; the captains are either members of the
Great Council or <HI>antient</HI> burghers; the first lieutenants are
usually <HI>antient</HI> burghers, while the rank of second lieute∣nants
and ensigns is usually filled by the principal peasants.</P>
<P>THE militia are assembled and reviewed in May and
September; and in the spring and autumn are exercised in
their respective villages by the under-lieutenants and en∣signs.
According to a plan of defence, regulated in 1668,
between the members of the Helvetic Confederacy, the can∣ton
of Soleure is bound to furnish 600 for its first contin∣gency;
for this supply 100 men, together with officers, are
annually selected from each of the six regiments, who are
to hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment's
warning. In case of necessity, this contingency may be
doubled or tripled in the same manner. The burghers are
incorporated in the company of fusileers, and exercise them∣selves
on Sundays and saints days, after divine service, by
shooting at marks: government furnishes powder and ball,
and distributes prizes to the best marksmen. The re∣maining
inhabitants of the capital and environs, who are not
burghers, form a separate body, commanded by the captain
<PB N="177" REF="199"/>
of the town: they are also occasionally exercised, and
mount guard on the day of St. John the Baptist, when the
<HI>Rosengarten,</HI> or the general meeting of the burghers, is
assembled.</P>
<P>THE sovereign power resides in the Great Council, which,
comprizing the Senate or Little Council of thirty-six, con∣sists
of a hundred and two members, chosen by the Senate,
in equal proportions, from the eleven tribes or companies
into which the <HI>antient</HI> burghers are distributed: and in all
instances the new member is taken from the company to
which the last member belonged.</P>
<P>THE prerogatives of the Great Council are, to enact and
abrogate laws; to explain any obscure parts of the constitu∣tion;
and even make alterations in the form of government,
should the circumstances require it; to levy taxes; to declare
war and conclude peace; to contract alliances; to receive
appeals in criminal causes from the burghers of the capital;
and in civil processes, above the sum of 100 Swiss livres, or
£. 6. 3<HI>s.;</HI> to confer the <HI>new</HI> burghership; to elect the trea∣surer,
or the fourth chief of the republic, from the antient
eleven senators; to nominate to the seven exterior bailliages,
and to the four Italian governments of Lugano, Locarno, Men∣drisio,
and Valmaggia, when the turn of appointing to those
governments belongs to Soleure; to choose the deputies for
the diet of Frauenfield, and those for any extraordinary
meetings of the Helvetic Confederacy; though in both these
cases it is the custom to appoint a senator, and usually either
of the four chiefs, the reigning advoyer excepted, who is
<PB N="178" REF="200"/>
not permitted to be absent during the year of his admini∣stration.</P>
<P>THERE are generally a few supernumerary members in
the Great Council, which circumstance proceeds from the
method of appointing the bailifs. On the nomination of a
bailif, his seat in the Great Council being esteemed vacant, is
on the next day filled up by a member of the same company
in which he is inscribed. At the conclusion of his bailliage
he again takes his seat, preserving his antient rank, though
considered as a supernumerary, until one of the six members
of his tribe makes a vacancy. The qualifications for a re∣ception
into the Great Council are, that the candidate shall
be twenty years of age, an <HI>antient</HI> burgher, and member of
the same tribe in which the vacancy happens: and with re∣spect
to the last-mentioned qualification, it is necessary that
the candidate, if inscribed in a company different from that
of his father, must, according to a decree passed in 1764,
have been a member of that company during a full year.</P>
<P>THE Great Council assembles ordinarily once every
month; and extraordinarily, on being convened by the Se∣nate.</P>
<P>THE Senate, or Little Council, a constituent part of the
Great Council, is composed of the two advoyers or chiefs of
the republic, who annually alternate; the chancellor or se∣cretary
of state, who has no vote either in the Senate or Great
Council; and thirty-three senators drawn from the remaining
sixty-six members of the Great Council, in equal proportion
<PB N="179" REF="201"/>
from the eleven tribes. The appointment and annual con∣firmation
of the advoyers and banneret by the assembly of
burghers, as well as the confirmation of the senators and
members of the Great Council, in their several charges, will
be hereafter described, under the article of <HI>Rosengarten.</HI></P>
<P>THE thirty-three senators who, in conjunction with the
two advoyers and chancellor, form the Senate, are divided into
eleven seniors, and twenty-two juniors. From the eleven
seniors the four principal magistrates are always chosen, the
two advoyers, the banneret, and treasurer. Upon a vacancy
among the eleven, the right of election, though said to
reside in the twenty-three juniors, is always exercised ac∣cording
to seniority: the most antient in rank among the
three junior counsellors, who are of the same tribe to which
the late member belonged, presents himself of course, and is
immediately appointed, or rather confirmed, by the twenty-three
juniors. Upon the death or promotion of one among the
latter, his place is immediately filled up by the two advoyers
and eleven seniors. The Senate is entrusted with the ex∣ecutive
power, and with the care of the police; has supreme
and final jurisdiction in all criminal causes, those only ex∣cepted
in which a burgher of the capital is concerned, who
may appeal from their decision to the Great Council; and gives
judgment in all civil processes not exceeding the value of a
hundred Swiss livres. The Senate convokes the Great
Council; examines and digests all affairs before they are
laid before that supreme assembly; fills up the vacant places
therein; and in their own body; either directly or indirectly,
<PB N="180" REF="202"/>
nominates to almost all the important charges of the re∣public;
appoints to the principal ecclesiastical benefices; re∣ceives
all appeals, in the first instance, from the inferior
courts of justice; judges all civil causes in the last resort,
whose value does not exceed a certain sum; has supreme
and final jurisdiction over all criminal affairs, excepting those
which concern the burghers of the capital. The qualifi∣cations
of a senator are, that he shall be twenty-four years of
age, a member of the Great Council, and drawn from the
same company to which the last senator belonged. This
body assembles three times in the week, and extraordinarily,
as often as occasion requires; and it is convoked by the reign∣ing
advoyer. The salaries of the senators are as follows;

<P>GOVERNMENT draws its principal revenues, which do
not amount to more than £. 12,500 <HI>per ann.</HI> from the fol∣lowing
sources. 1. A tax called the tax on fortifications;
laid on the funds of the tribes and monasteries in the town,
and on those of parishes in the bailliages. 2. Tythes, and
<HI>rentes foncieres</HI> belonging to the state. 3. Tolls. 4. Excise
on wine. 5. Interest of money placed out in the canton and
in foreign countries. 6. Monopoly of salt. 7. Revenues
<PB N="181" REF="203"/>
from the bailliages. 8. Subsidy from France; about £. 1108.
9. Sundry small sources, such as demesnes, estates, salaries of
vacant benefices, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE principal departments of government are, 1. The
tribunals; which comprise the inferior courts of justice, and
the Secret Council, consisting of seven members, namely,
the two advoyers, the banneret, the treasurer, the first senior
senator, the chancellor, and the attorney-general; in case any
of these persons should be absent, their places are supplied
by the antient senators, according to seniority. 2. The
boards of war. 3. Of those rights, called <HI>droits regaliens.</HI>
4. For finances, agriculture, and public buildings. 5. For
the police. 6. For ecclesiastical affairs, charitable institu∣tions,
and schools.</P>
<P>THE burghers of Soleure are divided into <HI>antient</HI> and
<HI>new;</HI> the former of whom are alone capable of being elected
members of the Great Council, or of enjoying any share in
the administration of affairs. The origin of this distinction
is to be dated from the year 1681, from the following causes.
Several foreign families, which settled at Soleure and obtain∣ed
the right of burghership, being admitted into the Great
Council, gave umbrage to those antient and illustrious fami∣lies,
whose ancestors had, by their valour and prudence, laid
the foundation of the republic. In order to prevent the far∣ther
participation of honours and emoluments, to which
they conceived themselves solely entitled, the Great Council
issued an edict, in 1681, that those families only, which at
that epoch enjoyed the rights of burghership, should be ex∣clusively
<PB N="182" REF="204"/>
qualified to hold any office of government; and
that, for the future, no person should be admitted to that
right, until the families then existing should be reduced to
twenty-five. It was at the same time enacted, that these
families and their descendants should be distinguished by the
name of <HI>antient</HI> burghers, and that those, who from that
period should be received into the burghership, should be
called <HI>new</HI> burghers. It was also added, that any burgher
who should make any proposition contrary to this law,
should be banished from the canton, and that his goods
should be confiscated.</P>
<P>BESIDE the exclusive privilege of being entitled to any
office of government, the <HI>antient</HI> burghers enjoy also the
right of being solely appointed canons in the chapters of
Soleure and Schoenenworth, and of holding any ecclesiastical
benefice in the gift of the Senate. But as there are at
present a great deficiency of clergymen among the <HI>antient</HI>
burghers, it will probably soon be thought necessary to dis∣pense
with the law on this article, and to permit the <HI>new</HI>
burghers, and every subject of the canton, to be candidates
for vacant livings. There are about eighty-five families
who possess the right of <HI>antient</HI> burghership, and of these
about thirty-four of the most illustrious, supply the mem∣bers
of the Great Council, and fill all the various depart∣ments
of government.</P>
<P>THE rights of the <HI>new</HI> burghers consist in nominating
and annually confirming the advoyer, the banneret, and
<HI>grand sautier,</HI> or lieutenant of the police; but, as they al∣ways
<PB N="183" REF="205"/>
choose those persons, who are selected by the Senate,
as they exercise this privilege in conjunction with the <HI>an∣tient</HI>
burghers, and as, by the edict of 1681, they must retire
from the assembly if there should be any difficulty or op∣position;
this right of election may be considered as little
more than a mere formality. In all other instances, ex∣cepting
in those concerns which relate to government, the
<HI>new</HI> burghers enjoy the same privilege as the <HI>antient</HI> burgh∣ers;
such as freedom of trade and commerce; of being
proprietors of houses and land in the capital and its district.
They are also entitled to hold such ecclesiastical benefices as
are in the gift of the chapters and of individuals.</P>
<P>THE burghers, both <HI>antient</HI> and <HI>new,</HI> are distributed into
eleven tribes or companies, each whereof furnishes three
senators and six members of the Great Council. Every per∣son
may choose the company into which he inscribes his
name; but having once inscribed himself, he cannot change
it. For the purpose of obtaining a place as soon as pos∣sible
in the government, a young noble selects that com∣pany
in which there is soon likely to be a vacancy; but if
he fixes upon one different from that in which his father
is incorporated, he must have been received a member
during a whole year, before he can be a candidate for ad∣mission
into the Great Council.</P>
<P>THE general assembly of <HI>antient</HI> and <HI>new</HI> burghers,
called <HI>Rosengarten,</HI> which meets on St. John the Baptist's
day, for the purpose of electing or confirming the charges
of advoyer, banneret, and <HI>grand sautier,</HI> is a ceremony
<PB N="184" REF="206"/>
which deserves to be described for its singularity; particu∣larly
as it will convey to you some idea of those annual elec∣tions,
or rather confirmations, of the principal officers,
which take place in most of these aristocratical states. This
assembly is held in the church of the Cordeliers, and is de∣nominated
<HI>Rosengarten,</HI> or Garden of Roses; either because
a nosegay of flowers, which every burgher carries in his
hand, was formerly composed of roses; or, as others pretend,
because this meeting used to be convened in the garden of
the Cordeliers, which is said to have been called the Garden
of Roses. But, instead of searching into fanciful etymo∣logies,
I shall describe what passes at this annual meeting.</P>
<P>ABOUT six in the morning, the advoyer out of office, the
senators, members of the Great Council, and the <HI>antient</HI>
and <HI>new</HI> burghers, assemble in their respective companies.
After the repetition of certain signals, the reigning advoyer,
accompanied by the chancellor, the secretary of the finances,
and several other officers of state, repair, with drums beating
and trumpets sounding, from the town-house to the church
of the Cordeliers; where, after presenting his offering upon
the altar of the Virgin, he seats himself on a throne, which
is placed near the altar. Soon afterwards the senators and
remaining members of the Great Council make their appear∣ance
at the head of their respective tribes; and having pre∣sented
their offerings, keep the same rank and stations,
which they maintained on entering the church; the ad∣voyer,
out of office excepted, who places himself near his
colleague on the throne. At the conclusion of mass accom∣panied
with music, all but the burghers retire, and the
<PB N="185" REF="207"/>
doors of the church are closed. The advoyer, with his scep∣ter
in his hand, pronounces an harangue; then delivering
up the scepter and seals, resigns his dignity, and receives the
thanks of the assembly, by the mouth of the attorney-gene∣ral,
for his zeal and attention during the year of his govern∣ment.
Next follow, in the same manner, the resignations of
the banneret and of the attorney-general; the former of
whom is thanked, in the name of the assembly, by the attor∣ney-general,
and the latter by the advoyer who has just re∣signed.</P>
<P>THIS ceremony being finished, the two advoyers, ban∣nerets,
attorney-general, and antient senators, retire from the
choir to another part of the church; and the chancellor
summoning the junior senators into the choir, reads over the
name of each antient senator, and of the attorney-general,
and demands, if the junior senators are pleased to confirm
them in their charges for another year. This approbation
being obtained, the chancellor and junior senators repair to
the assembly in the body of the church, were the chancellor
reads over the names of the senior senators and attorney-general
confirmed by the juniors, and demands the approba∣tion
of the whole assembly of burghers. Upon this, the ad∣voyer
who has just resigned, and all the senators, except the
advoyer out of office and the banneret, come into the
church, and take their respective oaths. The chancellor
then acquainting the assembly, that they must proceed to the
election of the reigning advoyer; the advoyer, who has just
resigned, proposes his colleague: the officer of state, called
<HI>Grand Sautier,</HI> cries out, “Let all those who choose to elect
<PB N="186" REF="208"/>
the right noble A. B. the reigning advoyer, hold up their
hands under oath;” and immediately informing the ad∣voyer
of his election, the latter comes into the church, takes
the oath from the chancellor, and receives the oath from the
<HI>Grand Sautier.</HI> The election of the banneret is made in the
same manner: the same person, who had just resigned his
office, being proposed to the assembly by the reigning ad∣voyer,
and accepted, gives his hand to the reigning ad∣voyer,
as he never takes the oath but in time of war. The
<HI>grand sautier</HI> then retiring, is proposed and recommended
by the reigning advoyer, and re-entering the church, he also
takes the oath to government.</P>
<P>AT the end of these elections, several decrees of the Great
Council are read, and particularly that which relates to the
right of <HI>antient</HI> burghership, and the election of the ad∣voyer,
banneret, and <HI>grand sautier;</HI> by which it is enacted,
that in case any opposition should be made to the regular
order of appointment, the <HI>new</HI> burghers shall retire from
the assembly, and the election be vested solely in the <HI>antient</HI>
burghers. The same magistrates are always re-elected or
confirmed in their several places: the advoyer out of office
is nominated reigning advoyer; on the death of either of
the advoyers, the banneret is of course appointed to the va∣cant
office, and is succeeded by the treasurer, only under∣going
the formality of a nomination.</P>
<P>AT the conclusion of this ceremony, the reigning ad∣voyer,
at the head of the Senate, passes through two lines of
troops under arms to the town-house, where the first magis∣trate
<PB N="187" REF="209"/>
and the antient senators confirm the junior senators;
after which he returns to his own house, accompanied by
the Senate and members of the Great Council, and is com∣plimented,
first by the banneret, and afterwards by the
chancellor.</P>
<P>FROM the consideration of this detail we may conclude,
that those authors have erred who call the government of
Soleure aristo-democratical, for it is certainly a most com∣plete
aristocracy: inasmuch as the supreme government re∣sides
in the Great Council, the members whereof are exclu∣sively
taken from the <HI>antient</HI> burghers; as there are only
eighty-one families which enjoy that right, and no more
can be added until they are reduced to twenty-five; as of
these scarcely more than thirty enjoy any share in the
government; and lastly, as the election and annual con∣firmation
of the principal magistrates is confined to the <HI>an∣tient</HI>
burghers, if there should be any opposition in the ge∣neral
assembly called Rosengarten. The government, how∣ever,
under whatsoever title it may be classed, is mild and
equitable; and the people are tranquil and contented.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 21.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TREATIES WITH FRANCE—REFLECTIONS ON FO∣REIGN
SERVICE.</HEAD>
<P>THE French embassador to the Helvetic body resides
in Soleure, and distributes those annual pensions
which the king his master has stipulated by treaty to pay to
the Catholic cantons. Louis the Eleventh was the first
French monarch who employed Swiss troops; and granted
subsidies to the states, which have since been considerably
augmented by his successors. The perpetual alliance which
Francis the First concluded with the Swiss cantons, soon
after the battle of Marignano, is considered as the basis of
every subsequent treaty between the two contracting powers.
Several of that king's successors derived considerable advan∣tages
from the Swiss infantry in their service: they aided
Henry the Fourth in establishing himself upon the throne of
his ancestors; and assisted both Louis the Thirteenth and his
son, in the several wars in which they were engaged. No
troops indeed have ever been more justly distinguished for
their fidelity, valour, and excellent discipline.</P>
<P>THE general alliance between France and the whole Hel∣vetic
union, ratified by Louis the Fourteenth in 1663, was to
remain in force during the joint lives of that monarch, and
his son the dauphin, and for eight years after the death of
either. Towards the end of his reign, when Louis, on ac∣count
<PB N="189" REF="211"/>
of his son's death, proposed to renew the treaty in his
own and his successor's name, the Protestant cantons refused
their consent: and it was concluded only with the Catholic
cantons, and the republic of the Vallais.</P>
<P>THIS alliance differed from the former treaties in the fol∣lowing
very essential articles: It stipulated that, if the king∣dom
of France should be invaded, the contracting republics
should permit an additional levy to be raised at his majesty's
expence, not exceeding sixteen thousand men; that if the
Helvetic body, or any particular canton, should be attacked
by a foreign power, the king engaged to assist them with as
many forces as should be judged necessary: and finally, that
if any dissensions should arise between the contracting can∣tons,
his majesty should, at the request of the aggrieved
party, try all gentle methods of effecting a reconciliation;
but if these should fail, the king agreed, both in his own
name, and in that of his successor, to compel the aggressor
to abide by the treaties concluded between the cantons and
their allies. This last article, as it seemed, in some measure,
to authorize the interference of the king of France with the
politics of Switzerland, appeared dangerous to many of the
Swiss, and inconsistent with that absolute independence,
which they had hitherto prized above all other advantages.</P>
<P>FRANCE having long in vain attempted to persuade the
Protestant cantons to accede to the alliance, that a general
treaty with the whole Helvetic body might be renewed, at
length, after much opposition and repeated negociations,
succeeded in effecting the measure. This important league
<PB N="190" REF="212"/>
was concluded at Soleure in May 1777, between the king of
France on one side, and the thirteen cantons and their allies
on the other, to continue in force during fifty years. By this
treaty it is agreed, that if the kingdom of France should be
invaded, the cantons and their allies shall furnish an addi∣tional
levy of six thousand men; and if the cantons, or any
of their allies, should be attacked, the king, if required,
engages to furnish them, at his own expence, with such suc∣cours
as may be deemed necessary. That article of the treaty
with the Catholic cantons in 1715, which related to the me∣diation
of the king, if any disputes should arise between the
thirteen cantons, is very properly and wisely omitted.</P>
<P>BEFORE this alliance, none of the Protestant states re∣ceived
any pensions from France: but by the sixteenth arti∣cle,
the Protestants of Glarus and Appenzel, and the town of
Bienne, have agreed to accept <HI>les argents de paix et d'alli∣ance,</HI>
as these subsidies are here called. The acceptance of
pensions derogates greatly from that spirit of absolute inde∣pendence,
which all the Protestant cantons and states of
Switzerland have hitherto affected to profess; and it would
have reflected much greater honour on the Swiss nation, if
the whole body had imitated Zuric, Berne, Basle, and Schaff∣hausen,
in forming the league upon terms of perfect equa∣lity,
and rejecting the proffered pensions, which give an air
of venality to their treaties with France.</P>
<P>IT has long been a controverted question, whether Swit∣zerland
gains or loses by furnishing, according to the tenor
of her alliance with France, Sardinia, Naples, and Holland,
<PB N="191" REF="213"/>
such numbers of her natives to serve in foreign armies.
That the fidelity of these troops is so well recognised, as to
be chosen to be the life-guards of several sovereigns, is a cir∣cumstance
which undoubtedly redounds much to the ho∣nour
of the national character: but, on the other hand, to
traffic with the blood of subjects, and, for paltry subsidies, to
fight the battle of any king, in any cause, seems to betray a
mercenary spirit, uncontrouled by considerations of justice
and humanity. It has been urged, that if Switzerland did
not furnish these supplies to foreign nations, she would be
over-stocked with inhabitants; and that the natives would
be obliged, like the northern hives of old, to emigrate for
subsistence: for in many parts there is no commerce, and
the mountainous tracts cannot supply sufficient provision for
such a numerous people. In reply to this reasoning, it may
be alledged, that the Swiss do not use all the resources in
their power: commerce might be more generally cultivated
and encouraged; as there is no part of Switzerland far re∣moved
from the principal rivers and great lakes, most of
which have a direct communication with the sea.</P>
<P>BUT, to be convinced that they have not exhausted all
the advantages to which they might resort, let them look
back on antient Greece, and the immense populousness in so
confined a country; or, what is more open to their observa∣tion,
let them consider the present state of the United Provin∣ces,
and the abundance which those industrious people en∣joy
on a tract of land snatched from an element perpetually
reclaiming its prior occupancy. But the Swiss need not be
reminded of antient or foreign examples: Geneva and St.
<PB N="192" REF="214"/>
Gallen are, for their extent, exceedingly populous; and yet
the natural productions of their lands are by no means suf∣ficient
to support all the inhabitants. Appenzel and Vallen∣gin
are entirely mountainous; nevertheless both those dis∣tricts
are remarkably well peopled, and derive, by means of
commerce and industry, all the necessaries of life in great
plenty. Indeed Switzerland is so far from being over-stock∣ed
with people, that in most of the great towns there is a
manifest deficiency of inhabitants; and in several parts of
their country, hands are frequently wanting for the common
purposes of agriculture.</P>
<P>THESE reflections seem to prove the mistaken policy of
Switzerland, in letting out her troops to foreign states. On
the contrary, many circumstances may be alledged in its fa∣vour.
This practice has tended to keep up the military
spirits of the Swiss, even during a state of profound peace,
which has now continued, with few interruptions, for three
hundred years. The several cantons not only have in con∣stant
reserve, and without the least expence, a body of well-disciplined
forces, which they can recal at a moment's warn∣ing;
but it becomes the interest, for that reason, of those
foreign powers, whom they furnish with men, not to fo∣ment
any divisions among them, which might render the
presence of their troops necessary at home. Add to this,
that the privileges which the Swiss enjoy in France, and the
very advantageous articles, relating to commerce, secured to
them in all their treaties, seem to strengthen the argument
for continuing their connections of this kind with that king∣dom.
This argument, however, would be more conclusive,
<PB N="193" REF="215"/>
if those privileges were still preserved in the same latitude
as was granted by the ninth article of the Perpetual Peace
concluded with Francis I. in 1516, and confirmed by several
successive treaties. But the case is far otherwise. These
immunities have been gradually and almost imperceptibly
violated: the Swiss merchants were subjected to the poll-tax;
and fresh duties, contrary to the tenor of their rights, were
imposed on their merchandise. During the administration
of the Duke d'Aiguillon, the Swiss complaining of these in∣fractions;
a negociation was begun at Soleure with the
French embassador, which produced, however, no other
effect than a short letter from the minister, declining, in
the most positive manner, to redress the grievances, though
founded on the faith of treaties.</P>
<P>ON the late renovation of the Perpetual Peace, in 1777,
it was expected that this matter of dispute would be ami∣cably
adjusted; and the Count de Vergennes insinuated, that
such was the intention of the court of Versailles. Many
cantons, and particularly Zuric, were principally induced by
these motives and these expectations to accede to the alli∣ance;
but not wholly trusting, however, to the promises of
the French cabinet, it was insisted that an article explaining
and confirming the said privileges should be inserted in the
new treaty. The minister, with his usual address, eluded a
direct mention of the demanded rights; but, in order not
to lose the confidence of a nation, at a time when he
most wished to obtain it, the king engaged, by the 18th
article, to <HI>preserve to the Swiss those privileges and advan∣tages
to which they had a legitimate right, and which they had
<PB N="194" REF="216"/>
hitherto enjoyed in France.</HI> And the Swiss agreed to postpone
<HI>the precise determination of the nature and extent of the said
privileges to future conferences, wherein those matters should
be regulated with fidelity and equity.</HI> It must appear astonish∣ing
that the Swiss should be contented with so ambiguous a
declaration; or could be led to believe, that the French court
would preserve to them their legitimate immunities, in the
moment when that legitimacy was a subject of contention.
The Helvetic body had soon occasion to repent of their cre∣dulity.
For, in 1781, the king of France issued an edict irre∣vocably
subjecting the Swiss, who possess lands in France, to
the poll-tax, and to all the national imposts: and laid the
same duties on their merchandise imported into France, as
are paid by the merchants of other countries, cheese and
linens excepted, which were taxed at a reduced value.</P>
<P>BUT a still severer blow was levelled against the Swiss in
1786; when, notwithstanding the express reservation granted
in the Perpetual Peace, the importation of linens was pro∣hibited
in France. The prohibition of this branch of com∣merce,
which furnished employment to so many hands in
various parts of Switzerland, particularly in the cantons of
Zuric, Glarus, and Appenzel, and was almost the sole re∣source
of the natives, spread a sensible alarm among them;
but was not productive of any serious consequences. After
the first surprise and agitation were past, the industry of
the Swiss was not abated; and the linens found their way
into France, either by contraband trade, or by contract with
the French East India Company.</P>

<P>WE yesterday quitted Zuric<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have in this part arranged the pre∣ceding letters differently from the former editions, and according to the journal of my tour in 1785; though I did not at that time proceed from Soleure to Zuric, yet I have thought proper to resume the order of my first journey in 1776, and to bring the reader back to Zuric, from whence I take my departure, as before, to Zug. The traveller who enters Switzerland at Schaff∣hausen, and quits it at Geneva or Neu∣chatel, will perhaps find this itinerary from Zuric to Basle, Bienne, Soleure, and thence to Berne and Lucerne, more convenient than that from Zuric immediately to Zug and Lucerne; while those who quit Switz∣erland at Basle will prefer the latter.</NOTE>, and walked to Albis, a
small village about three leagues distant, situated
near the summit of a mountain, much visited by travellers,
who are attracted by the variety and extent of the prospect.</P>
<P>WE fortunately escaped a violent shower of rain, accom∣panied
with a storm of thunder and lightning, which had
threatened for some time, and began immediately upon our
arrival: but we were well housed; and our host gave us a
good supper and an excellent bottle of Muscat wine. We
were abroad this morning by five, and had a very agreeable
walk to Zug; the weather, which had of late been very sul∣try,
being cooled by the lightning and rain. We passed
over the field of battle at Cappel, where Zuingle was slain;
regretting this instance of disunion between the Swiss repub∣lics,
<PB N="196" REF="218"/>
and lamenting the premature death of that great re∣former,
who was killed in the 48th year of his age. We
pursued our journey through a pleasant country, so thickly
planted with fruit-trees, that I could hardly distinguish any
other sort. Indeed, we had before remarked the prodigious
number of fruit-trees in several other parts of Switzer∣land;
the country being in many places almost a continued
orchard.</P>
<P>ZUG, the capital of this canton, stands delightfully upon
the edge of a beautiful lake, in a fertile valley, abounding
with corn, pasture, and wood. This canton formerly be∣longed
to the House of Austria: and continued faithful to
that family, when the other neighbouring states had form∣ed
themselves into independent republics. As it lies between
Zuric and Schweitz, the communication between those two
cantons was maintained with difficulty; and by this means
frequent opportunities were afforded to the House of Austria
of invading and harrassing the Swiss. Under these circum∣stances,
the six allied cantons, in 1351, laid siege to Zug, which
was resolutely defended by the inhabitants; but as Albert
duke of Austria was in no condition to assist them, the
town at length surrendered upon the most honourable con∣ditions.
The generosity of the conquerors was equal to the
courage and magnanimity of the vanquished: for, in con∣sequence
of this submission, the canton of Zug was delivered
from the yoke of a foreign master; obtained the most assured
liberty and independence; and was admitted into the Helve∣tic
Confederacy upon equal terms.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="219"/>
THE government of this little canton is exceedingly com∣plicated;
and the inhabitants of the town have somewhat
more influence, and enjoy a greater share in the administra∣tion
of affairs, than those of the capital burghs in the five
other democratical cantons. The supreme power resides in
the inhabitants of the four districts of Zug, Bar, Egeri, and
Meutzingen; who assemble yearly to enact laws, and to
choose their magistrates. The Landamman, reciprocally
elected from each of the four communities, is nominated by
the suffrages of the whole collective districts: he continues
three years in office, when taken from Zug, and but two
years when chosen from each of the three other districts.
The general administration of affairs is entrusted to the
council of regency, composed of forty members: of whom
thirteen are supplied by the district of Zug, and twenty-seven
are selected equally from the three remaining com∣munities.
This council, as well as the Landamman, resides
always in the capital.</P>
<P>OSWALD, one of our old British kings, is the titular Saint
of this place; and in the church is his statue, with the fol∣lowing
inscription:</P>
<Q>Sanctus Oswaldus Rex Angliae Patronus hujus Ecclesiae.</Q>
<P>THIS Oswald<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of this Oswald, who was defeated and slain in 624, by Peuda, king of the Mercians, in Pennant's Tour to Wales, vol. i. p. 258.</NOTE> was a king of Northumberland in the
seventh century; and is much renowned among the
monkish writers for his chastity, piety, and power of work∣ing
<PB N="198" REF="220"/>
miracles. I have been endeavouring to discover the con∣nection
between a British king, under the heptarchy, and a
small canton of Switzerland; without reflecting, how fruit∣less
is the attempt to give any reason for long-established
customs. In the church of Rome, saints are easily trans∣planted
into any soil; and caprice, as well as superstition,
may have inclined the inhabitants of Zug to adore a saint,
whose name is barely known in his own country.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 23.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE TOWN AND CANTON OF LUCERNE—GENERAL
PFIFFER'S MODEL.</HEAD>
<P>WE took boat at Zug, and being rowed across the lake
(which is about three leagues long, and one broad)
were landed at a village in the canton of Schweitz. From
thence we walked to Kussnacht; and in our way passed by a
small chapel sacred to William Tell, erected on the spot
where, it is said, he shot the Austrian governor. At Kuss∣nacht,
we embarked upon the lake of Lucerne; and were
much struck upon our approach with the fine situation of
that town, and the noble amphitheatre of mountains, which
border the lake.</P>
<P>LUCERNE, originally subject to the House of Austria, was
exposed to the inroads of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden,
when those cantons had secured their liberty and indepen∣dence.
Her commerce to Italy was interrupted; her fairs
unfrequented; and her citizens compelled to be continually
under arms, in order to protect their territory from incessant
depredations. Under these circumstances, the House of Aus∣tria
imprudently loading the citizens with additional taxes,
as exorbitant as they were unjust, Lucerne made her peace
with the consederate cantons: and, having soon after expel∣led
the Austrian party, entered into a perpetual alliance with
Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, and became a member of
the Helvetic union.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="223"/>
THE accession of Lucerne gave additional credit and
power to the confederacy; and enabled it, in 1386, to resist
all the efforts of a great and implacable enemy. In that
year, Leopold duke of Austria invaded the canton with a
numerous army; when the combined troops gained a bloody
victory at Sempach, in which Leopold lost his life. In the
accounts of this battle, an instance of private valour is re∣corded,
which would have done honour even to a Grecian or
a Roman name; and only requires the pen of a Thucydides
or a Livy to equal in same the exploits of the most admired
heroes of antiquity. The Austrian army, far superior in
number, was drawn up in firm battalion, accoutred in heavy
armour, and furnished with long pikes, which they present∣ed
before them. The Swiss troops were led to the attack in
the form of a wedge, in order to open their way into the
ranks of the enemy, and to break the solidity of the bat∣talion.
The Austrians continued for some time impenetra∣ble;
when Arnold de Winkelried rushed alone upon the
enemy to certain death; and, seizing as many pikes as he
could grasp, endeavoured to force through the ranks: but
he was killed in the attempt. His patriotic valour was not
exerted in vain: it inflamed the Swiss with new courage,
and taught the only method of penetrating into the bat∣talion;
which they at length effected, after the most despe∣rate
efforts of invincible resolution.</P>
<P>LEOPOLD himself might have escaped, when his troops
first began to give way; but, with a magnanimity worthy of
a better fate, he determined, after having been a witness to
the total rout of his army, not to survive so ignominious a
<PB N="201" REF="224"/>
day: accordingly he rushed into the thickest of the enemy,
and was slain. In the arsenal of this place are still preserved
his armour, together with a large quantity of cords; with
which, according to tradition, he intended to have bound the
citizens of Lucerne. The keeper of the arsenal displayed them
with the same kind of triumph, as the man, who shews the
Tower of London, points out the chains that were taken on
board of the Spanish armada; which Philip the Second is
said to have destined for the principal nobility of England.</P>
<P>THE government of Lucerne is entirely aristocratical.
or rather oligarchical. The sovereign power resides in the
Council of one hundred, comprising the Senate or Little
Council. The former is the nominal sovereign; but the
whole power actually resides in the latter, consisting of
thirty-six members, who are formed into two divisions,
which exercise the office by rotation. The members of
this Senate are neither confirmed by the Sovereign Coun∣cil,
nor by the citizens, but are only dependent upon them∣selves;
the division which retires at the end of six months,
confirming that which comes into office. Besides, the va∣cant
places in the Senate are filled by its own body; so that
the power remains in the possession of a few patrician fami∣lies:
and, as the son generally succeeds his father, or the
brother his brother, the senatorial dignity may be consider∣ed,
in some measure, as hereditary.</P>
<P>THE administration of the current affairs, the care of the
police, the management of the finances, and the whole ex∣ecutive
power, resides in the Senate, which sits constantly;
<PB N="202" REF="225"/>
whereas the Sovereign Council is assembled only upon parti∣cular
and important occasions. The Senate has cognizance
of criminal causes; but in case of capital condemnation, the
Sovereign Council is convoked in order to pronounce the
sentence: a practice worthy of imitation! for the condem∣nation
of a criminal cannot be too maturely weighed; and
great solemnity used in pronouncing the sentence, must im∣press
a strong effect upon the minds of the people. In civil
causes, an appeal lies from the Senate to the Sovereign
Council; but this must be a mere formality: as, in fact, it is
an appeal from the senators in one court to the same senators
in another. Indeed, their influence over the Sovereign
Council must necessarily be absolute: for they themselves
constitute above a third of that body: choose their own
members; and confer the principal charges of government.
They nominate also to the ecclesiastical benefices, which are
very considerable; near two-thirds of the revenues of the
canton belonging to the clergy.</P>
<P>THE chiefs of the republic are two advoyers, who are
chosen from the Senate by the Sovereign Council, and are
confirmed annually. In all elections, the relations of the
candidates, to the third degree, are excluded from voting;
and neither the father and the son, nor two brothers, can be
members of the Senate at the same time. Excellent institu∣tions,
one should think, to prevent the too great influence of
family-connections! excellent indeed in theory, but useless
in practice: and this circumstance proves, that when the
spirit of the constitution is purely oligarchical, any laws
enacted for the purpose of counteracting the power of the
<PB N="203" REF="226"/>
nobles, are mere cyphers. In some few instances, how∣ever,
the authority of the nobles is controuled: for, in de∣claring
war and peace, forming new alliances, or impos∣ing
new taxes, the citizens must be assembled, and give
their consent.</P>
<P>LUCERNE being the first in rank and power among the Ca∣tholic
cantons, is the residence of the Pope's nuntio; and all
affairs relative to religion are treated in the annual diet
which assembles in this town, composed of the deputies of
those cantons. The town contains scarcely three thousand
inhabitants; has no manufactures of any consequence, and
little commerce: and with respect to learning, it no where
meets with less encouragement, and consequently is no
where less cultivated. What a contrast to Zuric! Yet, under
these disadvantages, a few persons have made no inconsider∣able
progress in literature. Among these the most conspi∣cuous
is Mr. Balthasar, member of the Senate: he possesses a
library that is rich in books relative to the history of Swit∣zerland,
in which he is extremely conversant; and the pub∣lications
which he has already given to the world, and those
which he is now preparing for the press, prove that he
knows how to use them. His works are, for the most part,
in the German and Latin tongues; they contain biographical
aneodotes of several illustrious Swiss; elucidate various im∣portant
parts in the general history of Switzerland; but more
particularly relate to the canton of Lucerne. His son, a
member of the Great Council, deserves to be mentioned for
his collection of English books; and the zeal with which he
endeavours to propagate a knowledge of our literature. I
<PB N="204" REF="227"/>
have also no less satisfaction in adding, that, since my first
expedition into these parts, science is more cultivated; that
the principles of toleration are better understood and more
widely diffused; and that a literary society is established for
the promotion of polite learning. The population of the
canton has considerably increased within this century: a
sure proof of a mild and equitable government. The inha∣bitants
are, as I am informed, almost totally engaged in agri∣culture.
The southern parts of the canton are chiefly
mountainous, and furnish for exportation cattle, hides,
cheese, and butter. The northern district is fruitful in
corn; the crops of which being more than sufficient for the
consumption of the whole canton, there is a constant expor∣tation
of this article from the weekly market held in the
town, to which the inhabitants of the neighbouring demo∣cratical
cantons resort, in order to purchase that and other
necessaries in which their own country is deficient. This
commerce, which, together with the passage of the merchan∣dise
for Italy, is the chief support of the town, might be ex∣ceedingly
improved and augmented, considering its advan∣tageous
situation: for the Reuss issues from the lake, passes
through the town: and, having joined the Aar, falls into the
Rhine.</P>
<P>THE cathedral and the Jesuits church, are the only pub∣lic
buildings worthy of observation; but they are too much
loaded with rich ornaments, and disgraced by bad paintings.
In the cathedral is an organ of a sine tone, and of an extra∣ordinary
size: of the latter you may judge by the dimen∣sions
of the center pipe; which, as the priest assured me, is
<PB N="205" REF="228"/>
forty feet in length, near three in breadth, and weighs
eleven hundred pounds. The bridges which skirt the town,
round the edge of the lake, are the fashionable walks of the
place, and remarkable for their length. Being covered at
top, and open at the sides, they afford a constant view of this
delightful and romantic country. They are decorated with
coarse paintings, representing the histories of the Old Testa∣ment,
the battles of the Swiss, and the dance of Death.</P>
<P>UPON our arrival at Lucerne, we sent a letter of recom∣mendation
to General Pfiffer, a native of this town, and an
officer in the French service. He received us immediately,
with his usual civility, and shewed us his topographical re∣presentation
of the most mountainous part of Switzerland,
which well deserves the accurate attention of the curious
traveller. It is a model in relief; and what was finished
in 1776, comprised about sixty square leagues, in the cantons
of Lucerne, Zug, Berne, Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden.
The model was twelve feet long, and nine and a half broad.</P>
<P>THE composition is principally a mastic of charcoal, lime,
clay, a little pitch, with a thin coat of wax; and is so hard as
to be trod upon without receiving the least damage. The
whole is painted with different colours, representing the ob∣jects
as they exist in nature. It is worthy of particular ob∣servation,
that not only the woods of oak, beech, pine, and
other trees, are distinguished; but also that the strata of the
several rocks are marked; each being shaped upon the spot,
and formed with granite, gravel, calcareous stone, or such
<PB N="206" REF="229"/>
other natural substances as compose the original mountains.
The plan is indeed so minutely exact, that it comprises not
only all the mountains, lakes, rivers, towns, villages, and
forests; but every cottage, every torrent, every bridge,
every road, and even every path is distinctly and accurately
represented.</P>
<P>GENERAL PFIFFER has already been employed in this
work about ten years, with the most astonishing patience
and assiduity: he has himself made the plans upon the spots,
taken the elevations of the mountains, and laid them down
in their several proportions. In the prosecution of this la∣borious
performance, he has been twice arrested for a spy;
and in the popular cantons has frequently been forced to
work by moon-light, in order to avoid the jealousy of the
peasants, who think their liberty would be endangered,
should so exact a plan be taken of their country. As he is
obliged to remain some time upon the tops of the Alps,
where no provision can be procured; he generally carries
with him a few she-goats, whose milk supplies him with
nourishment. Indeed his perseverance in surmounting all
the difficulties, that necessarily have arisen in the course of
this undertaking, is almost inconceivable. When he has
sinished any particular part, he sends for the peasants and
<HI>chasseurs</HI> who reside near the spot, and bids them examine
accurately each mountain; whether it corresponds, as far as
the smallness of the scale will admit, with its natural ap∣pearance:
then, by frequently retouching, he corrects the
deficiencies. He takes his elevations from the level of the
<PB N="207" REF="230"/>
lake of Lucerne; which, according to Mr. de Saussure, is
about fourteen hundred and eight feet above the Mediter∣ranean.</P>
<P>THIS model, exhibiting the most mountainous parts of
Switzerland, conveys a sublime picture of immense alps
piled one upon another: as if the story of the Titans were
realized, and they had succeeded (at least in one spot of the
globe) in heaping Ossa upon Pelion, and Olympus upon Ossa.
The general informed me, that the tops of the alps which
crossed Switzerland in the same line, are nearly of the same
level; or, in other words, that there are continued chains of
mountains of the same elevation, rising in progression to the
highest range; and from thence as gradually descending to∣wards
Italy.</P>
<P>THE general is exceedingly polite and affable to strangers,
and ever ready to be of any service to travellers, in pointing
out the best roads, and in acquainting them with the places
most worthy of observation.</P>
<P>NEAR Lucerne is Mount Pilate, formerly called Mons <HI>Pi∣lcatus,</HI>
from the Latin word <HI>pilea;</HI> its top being generally
covered with a cloud or cap. This word has been corrupted
into <HI>Pilatus;</HI> and from this alteration a thousand ridiculous
stories have been invented; among others, that Pontius Pi∣late,
after having condemned our Saviour to death, was
seized with remorse; made an excursion into Switzerland;
and drowned himself in a lake, which is at the top of that
<PB N="208" REF="231"/>
mountain. This corruption of a word, and the absurd le∣gend
fabricated from its alteration, will naturally remind you
of several fables of similar absurdity, which are seriously re∣lated
by the Greek writers: a circumstance which my very
worthy and learned friend Mr. Bryant, has so amply and
ably discussed, in his <HI>Analysis of antient Mythology.</HI></P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in three successive visits to Lucerne, observed
the progress of General Pfiffer's model, and in August 1786
seen it finally completed, I am enabled to add the following
particulars, partly from my own observation, and partly
communicated by the ingenious artist himself.</P>
<P>THE model is composed of a hundred and forty-two
compartments of different sizes and forms: they are respec∣tively
numbered; and the whole can be taken to pieces and
united with almost as much ease (if we may compare great
things with small) as the diffected maps, by which children
are instructed in geography.</P>
<P>THE lake of Lucerne, nearly the center of Switzerland,
forms also the center of the plan, which lays down part of
the circumjacent cantons of Zuric, Zug, Schweitz, Under∣walden,
Lucerne, and Berne, and a small portion of the
mountains of Glarus. It comprehends a space of 18 1/2
<PB N="209" REF="232"/>
leagues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A league is equal to 2,288 toises, or 13,728 French feet, or 14,643 English feet.</NOTE> in length, and 11 in breadth; and the dimensions
of the model being 20 feet<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">French feet.</NOTE> and a half in length, and 12 in
breadth; 203 1/2 square leagues are represented on a parallelo∣gram
of 246 feet; or about two English miles and 1/4 by a
square English foot. The highest point of the model from
the level of the center, is about ten inches; and as the most
elevated mountain represented therein rises 1475 toises, or
9440 feet, above the lake of Lucerne, at a gross calculation,
the height of an inch in the model is equivalent to about
900 feet. In regard to myself, though I received consider∣able
satisfaction from the first view of this extraordinary
performance, yet I again contemplated it with much more
pleasure, and still greater astonishment, when I was able to
trace on it many of my various expeditions, and to acknow∣ledge
the surprising accuracy with which the most stupen∣dous
works of nature are delineated on so small a scale, and
with so perfect a resemblance.</P>
<P>THE general began this elaborate work at the age of
fifty, and though now in the seventieth year of his age,
continues his annual expeditions into the alps, with a spirit
and ardour that would fatigue a much younger person. It
is no less entertaining than instructive, to hear him expa∣tiate,
with an agreeable vivacity, on the most interesting
objects, which are observed on the model. He kindly sup∣plied
me with the following remarks, which I transcribe
from my journal. According to a rough calculation, the
<PB N="210" REF="233"/>
height which snow usually remains during summer, may be
estimated at 1360 toises, or 8704 English feet, above the level
of the sea; and on which it never melts, at 1448, or 9264
feet. As a curious instance of divided property, he pointed
to the promontory called Kieman, on the western shore of
the lake of Zug, of which the ground belongs to Lucerne,
the timber to Zug, and the leaves to Schweitz. Among the
phaenomena of nature he mentioned the Rigi, an insulated
mountain near the lake of Lucerne, twenty-five miles in cir∣cumference,
and rising to a perpendicular height of more
than four thousand feet above the surface of the lake: it is
entirely composed of gravel and pudding-stone, and must
have been formed by the waters. The Rigi joins to a small
ridge of sand-stone running towards Schweitz.</P>
<P>MOUNT PILATE offers a most singular curiosity. At the
elevation of five thousand feet, and in the most perpendicu∣lar
part of the mountain, near the pasture of Brunlen, is ob∣served,
in the middle of a cavern hollowed in a black rock, a
colossal statue, which appears to be of white stone. It is the
figure of a man in drapery standing, leaning one elbow on a
pedestal, with one leg crossed over the other, and so regu∣larly
formed, that it cannot be a <HI>lusus naturae.</HI> This statue
is called Dominic by the peasants, who frequently accost it
from the only place in which it can be seen, and when their
voices are re-echoed from the cavern, they say, in the sim∣plicity
of their hearts, “Dominic has answered us.” It is
difficult to imagine by whom, or in what manner, this statue
could be placed in a situation, which has hitherto proved in∣accessible
to all who have endeavoured to approach it.
<PB N="211" REF="234"/>
About the beginning of the present century, Huber, a native
of Krientz, a neighbouring village, attempted to descend
into the cavern by means of ropes let down from the sum∣mit
of the rock: he succeeded so far as to gain a near view
of this singular phaenomenon, and was again drawn up in
safety. On a second trial, as he was suspended in the air,
and was endeavouring to draw himself into the cavern by
fixing a grapple to the statue, the rope broke, and he was
dashed to pieces. Since that dreadful accident no one has
ventured to repeat the experiment from the same quarter.
Another trial to penetrate to the statue was made in 1756, by
General Pfiffer and eight persons, from a small opening on
the opposite side of the mountain, in which the natives col∣lect
a white substance called <HI>mond-loch,</HI> or cream of the
moon. As this opening is supposed to communicate with
the cavern, the general and his companions crept on their
hands and knees, one behind the other, and winding in the
bed of a small torrent, through several narrow passages, they
at length discovered the light of the sun through a remote
chasm; but as the distance seemed very considerable, and as
the fall of a single stone might have obstructed their return,
they thought it imprudent to venture any further, and re∣treated
without having effected their purpose.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VALLEY OF ENTLIBUCH—ZOFFINGEN—LAKE OF
SEMPACH—ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE.</HEAD>
<P>IN my first expedition to this country, I had no opportu∣tunity
of visiting the interior parts of the canton of
Lucerne, which I afterwards traversed in 1785 and 1786. On
both those occasions I passed from Berne to Lucerne, one
time along the high road leading through Zoffingen, Surzee,
and by the lake of Sempach; at the other, through Lange∣nau,
the Emme-thal, and the valley of Entlibuch, a district
which, though not usually frequented by travellers, yet
highly deserves their attention.</P>
<P>IN the 13th century, Entlibuch was subject to the counts
of Wolhausen, and came by purchase, in 1299, to the em∣peror
Albert. In the following century it was held as a fief
from the House of Austria by several successive counts; of
these the last, Peter of Torrenberg, having grievously op∣pressed
the natives, they revolted, and in 1386 threw them∣selves
under the protection of Lucerne. That republic con∣tinued
to possess Entlibuch, as a feudal tenure under the
House of Austria, until 1405; when the archduke Frederic
renounced all the rights of sovereignty in favour of Lucerne.
For above a century and an half subsequent to that period,
the inhabitants, inflamed with a spirit of independence, and
<PB N="213" REF="236"/>
excited by the example of the neighbouring popular can∣tons,
frequently rose in arms, and attempted to establish
a democracy; but without success. Their last insurrection
broke out in 1653; since which time they have continued in
a state of perfect tranquillity, under the wise administration
of Lucerne; and have enjoyed, with contentment, the con∣siderable
privileges with which they are endowed.</P>
<P>THE bailliage of Entlibuch extends from the Emme-thal
in the canton of Berne, to the bridge near Wertenstein, about
fifteen miles in length, and nine in its greatest breadth; and
contains at least 11,000 souls. It is governed by a bailif,
who is always a senator of Lucerne: he continues in office
two years, and generally resides in that capital. The inhabi∣tants
enjoy considerable immunities, which they know how
to prize.</P>
<P>THE bailliage is divided into three districts; the Upper,
or Eschlismat; the Middle, or Shuepfen; the Lower, or
Entlibuch; each whereof has its separate courts of justice,
from which an appeal lies to Lucerne.</P>
<P>THAT part of the bailliage which I traversed, is a valley,
watered by several lively rivulets, winding for some way
between two ridges of well-wooded hills, and abounding in
picturesque scenery. Afterwards the country was undu∣lating,
and the road, which was narrow and rugged, ran
along continual acclivities and declivities, through well-cultivated
fields of pasture. I passed through several villages,
of which the principal were Eschlismat, Shuepfen, and En∣tlibuch,
<PB N="214" REF="237"/>
which takes its name from the rivulet Entle, and
gives it to the whole district. These places are small; but
the whole country is strewed with cottages, and seems a
continued village. The inhabitants chiefly follow agricul∣ture;
they rear large quantities of horned cattle, sheep,
goats, and swine; make and export cheeses in great abun∣dance.
Though usually richer than the inhabitants in the
other parts of the canton, yet they did not appear so well
clothed, or to possess such neat cottages, as their neighbours
in the Emme-thal. The peasants of Entlibuch are much
esteemed for their independent spirit, vigour, and strength;
remarkable for keenness and vivacity, for great quickness in
repartee, for a peculiarity of garb, and for many striking
customs which distinguish them from the natives of the
circumjacent districts. Of various usages, which escaped my
notice during my short stay among them, I chanced to gain
information of one custom, which reminds me of the <HI>Fescen∣nina
Licentia</HI> mentioned by Horace, that prevailed among
the Roman peasants. Two neighbouring parishes send a
challenge to each other; and, at the conclusion of the car∣nival,
each dispatches a man, <HI>bedizened</HI> with flowers and
shells, called <HI>shrove-monday-embassador;</HI> who rides to the
neighbouring village, and reads, or rather sings, two satiri∣cal
compositions in verse: the one, a general satire against
the parish, usually begins by celebrating a period of Swiss
history accommodated to the circumstances of time and
place; then draws a comparison between the two parishes,
giving the preference to his own, either for the superior
learning and piety of the priest, the wisdom and impartiality
of the president, the industry and spirit of the men, the
<PB N="215" REF="238"/>
beauty and chastity of the women, and the education of the
children. The second composition consists of a string of
epigrams in ridicule of particular persons; in which any
scandalous adventures, or ludicrous circumstances, which
have happened since the last year, are recorded with much
exaggeration. The poet finishes his harangue with ex∣pressing
a wish, that on the next Shrove-monday the inha∣bitants
may improve, and not deserve such a severe re∣primand.</P>
<P>ON the conclusion of this lecture, which creates much
laughter, the <HI>mock embassador</HI> returns; and the men of the
two parishes repair, with drums beating and colours flying,
to an open place, called the <HI>Field of Battle,</HI> followed and en∣couraged
by the inhabitants of their respective parishes.
When the two <HI>armies</HI> are drawn up in order of battle; the
<HI>combatants,</HI> in imitation of the old Swiss custom, fall down
upon their knees, offer up a short prayer, and start up at
the sound of the trumpet. Having formed themselves into
two columns of several ranks, they march arm in arm, with
uniform step and military attitude; both the foremost lines
meet in front and jostle against each other, being supported
and pushed forwards by the hinder files, frequently assisted
by the women, until one <HI>phalanx</HI> is broke. The victorious
party is dignified with the name of the <HI>Swiss,</HI> and those who
gave way are called <HI>Austrians,</HI> in allusion to the antient ani∣mosity
between those two powers. The jurymen of the
district are present as umpires, and to prevent any violent
disputes and quarrels. After the rencounter both parties
sit down to table, and the day is concluded with feasting.
<PB N="216" REF="239"/>
As those satirical compositions occasionally created much ill-will
between the two neighbouring parishes, and the ren∣counters
were attended with various accidents, the govern∣ment
of Lucerne abolished the custom; but has lately per∣mitted
it to be revived, with certain restrictions calculated to
prevent any future mischief.</P>
<P>THE valley of Entlibuch may be considered as one of
those parts which unite the mild and cultivated, with the
more wild and rugged scenery of Switzerland; its acclivi∣ties
gradually ascend and terminate in Mount Pilate, whose
barren top is seen towering above the fertile and well-wooded
hills.</P>
<P>ON quitting this valley we crossed the Emme over a co∣vered
bridge, admired the romantic position of Wertenstein,
a convent of Cordeliers, overhanging the perpendicular
banks of that torrent; and passed through a very steep and
rocky country to Malters, a small village within a league of
the capital. Here being a considerable fair, I stopped and
dined at the <HI>table d' hote,</HI> in company with several gentlemen
from Lucerne. In walking through the fair, I observed
several booths for the sale of artificial flowers; which were
purchased by the country girls. With these flowers, and
with four bows of ribbands, they ornament their hats, which
they adjust obliquely, with a degree of rustic coquetry that
is not unbecoming.</P>
<P>ANOTHER district of this canton, is that part which I
visited in 1786, along the high road leading from Berne to
<PB N="217" REF="240"/>
Lucerne. I passed the night at Zoffingen, a small town in
the canton of Berne, the inhabitants whereof enjoy greater
immunities than any other place in that whole canton.
They have their own magistrates; and what is peculiar, their
own courts of justice, both civil and criminal, which decide
in the last resort, without an appeal to Berne. A bailif re∣sides
there; but his whole employment consists in collecting
the tythes. The town contains about two thousand souls.</P>
<P>NEAR Zoffingen I entered the canton of Lucerne, and
passed through a narrow valley bounded by a chain of hills
remarkable for the richness and variety of the hanging
woods. As we proceeded the valley expanded; we traversed
a gently waving country, and descended to Surzee, a small
neat town near the lake of Sempach. From thence we
coasted the west-side of that lake, which is a small but beau∣tiful
piece of water, about three miles in length, and one in
breadth. The grounds on each side slope gently to the edge
of the water, and are prettily checkered with wood. On
the opposite banks of the lake, I observed the town of Sem∣pach,
celebrated for the battle which established the liberty
of the Swiss; and which I have already mentioned in the
preceding letter. The anniversary of that battle, which
happened on the 9th of July, 1386, is still commemorated
with great solemnity, both at Sempach and Lucerne; and
supplies a copious subject for many poems and ballads in the
numerous collection of national songs.</P>
<P>ON that anniversary, a large body of persons of all ranks
assemble on the spot where the battle was fought; a priest
<PB N="218" REF="241"/>
ascends a pulpit erected in the open air, and delivers a
thanksgiving sermon on the successful efforts of their an∣cestors
on that happy day, which ensured to their country
liberty and independence. On the conclusion of this ser∣mon,
another priest reads a description of the battle, and
commemorates the names of those brave Swiss who gloriously
sacrificed their lives in defence of their freedom. Having
exhorted those who are present to pray for the souls of their
countrymen, and of the enemies, who fell in that battle;
they all repair instantly to a small chapel, where masses are
sung for the souls of the deceased. During this service, the
people, falling on their knees, pray for their glorious an∣cestors,
either in the chapel, on whose walls are painted the
deeds of the Swiss who immortalized themselves in this
conflict, or before four stone crosses which distinguish the
place of combat.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 25.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE LAKE OF LUCERNE—GERISAU—SCHWEITZ—ORIGIN
OF THE HELVETIC CONFEDERACY—WILLIAM
TELL—ALTDORF.</HEAD>
<P>THE Waldstaetter See, or the Lake of the Four Can∣tons,
is, from the greatness and sublimity as well as
variety of scenery, perhaps the finest body of water in Swit∣zerland.
The upper branch, or the lake of Lucerne, is in
the form of a cross; the sides of which stretch from Kuss∣nacht
to Dallenwal, a small village near Stantz. It is bound∣ed
towards the town of Lucerne by cultivated hills sloping
gradually to the water, contrasted on the opposite side by an
enormous mass of barren and craggy rocks. Mount Pilate
rises boldly from the lake, and is perhaps one of the highest
mountains in Switzerland, if estimated from its base, and not
from the level of the sea. According to General Pfiffer, its
elevation above the lake is more than six thousand feet: ne∣vertheless
its height above the Mediterranean is trifling, in
comparison with that of the alps we are going to visit; nor
indeed does the snow continue all the year upon its summit.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of this branch, the lake contracts into
a narrow creek scarcely a mile across; soon after, it again
widens, and we entered the second branch, or the lake of
Schweitz: on the western side the canton of Underwalden,
on the eastern that of Schweitz. Here the mountains are
<PB N="220" REF="243"/>
more lofty, and infinitely varied: some covered to their very
summits with the most lively verdure; others perpendicular
and craggy; here forming vast amphitheatres of wood; there
jutting into the water in bold promontories.</P>
<P>ON the eastern side of this branch, is the village of Geri∣sau,
at the foot of the Rigi: it is the smallest republic in
Europe. Its territory is about a league in breadth, and two
in length; situated partly on a small neck of land at the edge
of the lake, and partly lying upon the rapid declivity of the
Rigi. It contains about 1200 inhabitants: they have their
general assembly of burgesses, their Landamman, their
council of regency, their courts of justice, and their militia.
I was informed, that there is not a single horse in the whole
territory of the republic; as indeed might well be supposed:
for the only way of arriving at the town is by water, except∣ing
a narrow path down the steep sides of the mountain,
which is almost impassable. Gerisau is entirely composed of
scattered houses and cottages of a very neat and picturesque
appearance. Each dwelling is provided with a field or small
garden. The inhabitants are much employed in preparing
silk for the manufactures of Basle. This little republic, is
under the protection of the four cantons, Lucerne, Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden: and in case of war furnishes its
quota of men. To the ambitious politician, who judges of
governments by extent of dominion and power, such a dimi∣nutive
republic thrown into an obscure corner, and scarcely
known out of its own contracted territory, must appear un∣worthy
of notice; but the smallest spot of earth on which civil
freedom is cultivated and flourishes, cannot fail to interest
<PB N="221" REF="244"/>
those who know the true value of liberty and independence;
and are convinced, that political happiness does not consist in
great opulence and extensive empire.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of this branch the lake forms a bay;
in the midst of which lies the village of Brunnen, celebrated
for the treaty, concluded, in 1315, between Uri, Schweitz,
and Underwalden. Here I landed, and walked through an
agreeable and fertile plain, laid out in meadows, and planted
with fruit-trees, to Schweitz, which stands on the slope of a
hill, at the bottom of two high, sharp and rugged rocks,
called the <HI>Schweitzer-Haken.</HI> Its position is extremely
agreeable. The church, which is a large magnificent build∣ing,
stands in the center of the place: near it the houses are
contiguous to each other: but in the other part they are
prettily dispersed about the gentle acclivities, in the midst of
lawns and meadows, and sheltered by groves of trees. The
principal object of curiosity in Schweitz, is a complete collec∣tion
of the celebrated Hetlinger's medals, possessed by his
nephew. This collection, which he inherited from his un∣cle,
is very valuable, the medals being all of the finest im∣pressions,
and several extremely rare. From these medals
Mr. de Mechel published his much esteemed engravings, to
which he has prefixed a life of the artist, who was born in
the canton of Schweitz, on the 28th of March 1691, and died
in 1771, in a very advanced age.</P>
<P>HAVING reimbarked at Brunnen, we soon entered the
third branch, or the lake of Uri; the scenery of which is so
grand and sublime, that its impression will never be erased
<PB N="222" REF="245"/>
from my mind. Imagine to yourself a deep and narrow
lake about nine miles in length, bordered on both sides with
rocks uncommonly wild and romantic, and, for the most part,
perpendicular; with forests of beech and pine growing down
their sides to the very edge of the water: the rocks are so
entirely steep and overhanging, that we scarcely observed
more than four or five spots, where we could have landed.
On the right-hand, upon our first entrance, a detached piece
of rock, at a small distance from the shore, engaged our at∣tention.
This rock is wholly formed by stones of the size
and shape of bricks, so as to appear quite artificial. The
same kind of natural masonry may be observed in the lofty
cliffs which impend over this lake, not far from Brunnen.
It rises to about sixty feet in height; is covered with under∣wood
and shrubs; and reminded me of those crags that shoot
up in the fall of the Rhine near Schaffhausen: but here the
lake was as smooth as chrystal; and the dead silence and so∣lemn
gloom which reigned in this place, were not less awful
and affecting than the tremendous roaring of the cataract at
Schaffhausen. Somewhat further, upon the highest point of
the Seelisberg, we observed a small chapel that seemed inacces∣sible;
and below it, the little village of Gruti, near which the
three heroes of Switzerland are said to have taken reciprocal
oaths of fidelity, when they planned the famous revolution.</P>
<P>ON the opposite side appears the chapel of William Tell,
erected in honour of that hero, upon the very spot where (it
is said) he leaped from the boat, in which he was conveying
as a prisoner to Kussnacht. It is built upon a rock that pro∣jects
into the lake under a hanging wood: a situation amid
<PB N="223" REF="246"/>
scenes so strikingly awful, as must strongly affect even the
most dull and torpid imagination! On the inside of this
chapel, the several actions of William Tell are coarsely
painted. While we were viewing them, we observed the
countenances of our watermen glistening with exultation,
and they related to us, with much spirit and sensibility, the
cruelties and tyranny of Gesler, governor of Uri, and the in∣trepid
behaviour of their glorious deliverer. Indeed I have
frequently remarked with pleasure, the national enthusiasm
which so generally prevails in this country; and have great∣ly
admired the fire and animation with which the people
discourse of those famous men among their ancestors, to
whom they are indebted for that happy state of indepen∣dence
which they now enjoy. This laudable spirit is con∣tinually
supported and encouraged by the number of statues,
and other memorials, of the antient Swiss heroes, which are
so common in every town and village throughout Switzer∣land.
Among these, Tell is the most distinguished, and he
seems to be the peculiar favourite of the common people:
the reason is obvious; for his story partakes greatly of the
marvellous.</P>
<P>A FEW years ago a treatise, entitled <HI>Fable Danoise</HI> was
published at Berne; in which the author calls in question
the history of William Tell. Tho' his arguments in general
are by no means conclusive; yet he mentions two circum∣stances
which, if true, are convincing proofs, that much
fiction is interwoven with the whole account: for, the
author asserts that the incident of Tell's shooting the apple
from the head of his son, is not recorded in any of the con∣temporary
<PB N="224" REF="247"/>
historians, although they give the minutest ac∣counts
of the governor's tyranny; and that the first writer
who takes notice of it, is Petermann Etterlin of Lucerne,
who lived in the latter end of the fifteenth century, near
two hundred years after the fact is supposed to have hap∣pened.
Besides, a story of the same kind is related in the
Danish annals by Saxo Grammaticus, with scarcely any dif∣ference
but that of names: Harold king of Denmark sup∣plies
the place of the governor of Uri; and Tocco that of
William Tell; and this event, which is said to have hap∣pened
in 965, is attended also with nearly the same incidents
as those recorded in the Swiss accounts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Saxo Grammaticus is an author but little known, and the passage in ques∣tion is exceedingly curious; the reader will find it inserted at the end of this vo∣lume. It is but justice to add, that some persons question the authenticity of this pas∣sage, and suppose it to be spurious.</NOTE>. Nevertheless, it
is far from being a necessary consequence, that, because the
authenticity of the story concerning the apple is liable to
some doubts; <HI>therefore</HI> the whole tradition relating to Tell
is fabulous. Neither is it a proof against the reality of a
fact, that it is not mentioned by any contemporary histo∣rians.
The general history of William Tell is repeatedly
celebrated in several old German songs, so remarkable for
their antient dialect and simplicity, as almost to raise the
deeds they celebrate above all reasonable suspicion: add to
this, the constant tradition of the country, together with two
chapels erected some centuries ago, in memory of his ex∣ploits.
The three cantons were so much offended with the
author for throwing any doubt upon the exploits of their
antient hero, that they presented a remonstrance to the so∣vereign
<PB N="225" REF="248"/>
council of Berne: and the pamphlet was publicly
burnt at Uri. In this instance their national prejudices (if
they really deserve that name) become, in some measure,
meritorious and respectable.</P>
<P>UPON our landing at Fluellen, I had an opportunity of
observing that the cross-bow is still much used in these parts,
as I saw several very young boys, each with that instrument
in his hand. Observing a butt at a small distance from the
place, I gave them to understand, that those who hit the
mark should receive a penny for their dexterity. Upon this
intimation, three boys took aim successively, two of whom
touched the very center of the butt, and obtained the prize:
but, the third missing, I made him shoot till he hit the
mark; which, after two or three trials, he at length per∣formed.</P>
<P>FROM Fluellen we walked to Altdorf, the capital burgh
of the canton of Uri, situated in a narrow vale almost en∣tirely
surrounded by stupendous mountains. It contains se∣veral
neat houses; the tops whereof are covered with large
stones, in order to prevent the roofs being carried away by
those violent hurricanes which are frequent in these moun∣tainous
countries.</P>
<P>WHEN the greatest part of Helvetia was subject to the
empire; the inhabitants of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden,
had long enjoyed the most considerable privileges, particu∣larly
the right of being governed by their own magistrates:
the clergy and many of the nobles, indeed, had siefs and
<PB N="226" REF="249"/>
subjects in those respective territories; but the bulk of the
people formed several communities almost totally indepen∣dent.
During the twelfth century, various disputes between
these three cantons and the emperors, united them more
firmly than ever; and they were accustomed, every ten
years, to renew formally their alliance. Such was their
situation at the death of Frederick II. In 1250. From this pe∣riod,
or soon afterwards, commences the interregnum in the
empire: during which time of anarchy and confusion, the
nobles and bishops endeavouring to extend their power, and
to encroach upon the privileges of the people; Uri, Schweitz,
and Underwalden, put themselves under the protection of
Rhodolph of Hapsburgh, who, in 1273, being chosen em∣peror,
terminated the interregnum. Rhodolph received a
small revenue from these cantons, and appointed a governor,
who had cognizance in all criminal causes: the rights,
however, and privileges of the people were expressly re∣served.</P>
<P>RHODOLPH, some time after his accession to the imperial
throne, listened to the ambitious schemes of his son Albert,
who was desirous to form Helvetia into a dutchy. For this
purpose the emperor purchased the domains of several ab∣beys,
and other considerable fiefs in Switzerland, as well in
the canton of Schweitz as in the neighbouring territories.
The three cantons, induced by the great increase of power,
which the emperor gained by this acquisition, prudently re∣newed
their alliance, and obtained a confirmation of their
privileges: which, upon the death of Rhodolph, was con∣firmed
by his successor Adolphus of Nassau. But when Al∣bert
<PB N="227" REF="250"/>
was afterwards elected emperor, he refused to ratify
their rights: and, in order totally to subdue the people,
placed over them two governors, who were guilty of many
flagitious acts of tyranny and oppression.</P>
<P>UNDER these circumstances Werner de Staffach of
Schweitz, Walther Furst of Uri, and Arnold de Melchthal of
Underwalden, planned the famous revolution, which took
place January 13, 1308, and restored liberty to the three can∣tons.
Albert, while he was preparing to attack them, was
assassinated by his nephew John of Hapsburgh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter 14.</NOTE>. In 1315,
Leopold duke of Austria marched against the confederate
cantons, at the head of twenty thousand troops, and, endea∣vouring
to force his way into Schweitz at the streights of
Morgarten, received a total defeat from thirteen hundred
Swiss, who were posted upon the mountains. If we may be∣lieve
contemporary historians, the Swiss lost but fourteen
men in this memorable engagement, which insured their
independence. In the same year, the three cantons con∣tracted
a perpetual alliance, which was ratified at Brunnen;
and is the grand foundation of the Helvetic Confederacy.
Such were the feeble beginnings of a league, since become
so formidable by the accession of ten more cantons, and by
the additional strength of its numerous allies: and it is re∣markable,
that Switzerland is the only country which, on the
one side, has consined the limits of the German empire;
and, on the other, has set bounds to the French monarchy,
which the latter has never transgressed.
<PB N="228" REF="251"/>
THE name of Schweitzerland, or Switzerland, which
originally comprehended only the three cantons of Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden, was afterwards extended to
all Helvetia. It derived that appellation either from the
canton of Schweitz, as having particularly distinguished itself
in the revolution of 1308, and also at the battle of Morgar∣ten;
or because the Austrians called all the inhabitants of
these mountainous parts, by the general denomination of
Schweitzers.</P>
<P>SWITZERLAND was the rock on which the House of Au∣stria
split, during more than a century. Blinded with re∣sentment
against their former subjects, and anxious to reco∣ver
their lost domains; the several dukes led in person con∣siderable
armies to subdue a nation, whose spirit was uncon∣querable;
and to obtain possession of a country, which,
from its situation, was easily defended by a handful of men
against the most numerous troops. Within the period
above-mentioned, they neglected several opportunities of
aggrandizing themselves in other parts; and, slighting
what was more feasible, bent their whole efforts to acquire
what in its very nature was unattainable. The consequence
of this mistaken policy, was, a continued succession of de∣feats,
attended with a prodigious expence, and the loss of
their bravest troops: until at length, convinced of their
error, they totally relinquished an attempt, in which they had
expended so much fruitless blood and treasure. But al∣though
several emperors of that House occasionally made
alliances with the Swiss cantons; yet it was not till the treaty
of Westphalia in 1648, that their independence was fully
<PB N="229" REF="252"/>
and finally acknowledged, by Ferdinand III. and the whole
empire.</P>
<P>THE government of Uri and Schweitz is entirely demo∣cratical,
and nearly the same. The supreme power resides
in the people at large, who are divided into several com∣munities,
from which are chosen the councils of regency.
In the <HI>Lands-gemeind,</HI> or general assembly, the Landamman,
and the principal magistrates, are elected; and every burgh∣er,
at the age of fourteen, in the cantons of Uri and Under∣walden;
and of fifteen in Schweitz, has a right to vote.
The councils of regency in Uri and Schweitz consist each of
sixty members, and reside at the capital burghs. In this
council the executive power is vested, and from this body
the principal magistrates are chosen.</P>
<P>THESE two cantons contain, including their subjects,
about fifty thousand souls, and in case of necessity could
furnish above twelve thousand militia. All the Catholic
cantons enjoy considerable subsidies from France. Every
burgher, at the age of fourteen, in Uri, receives annually
about six livres, or five shillings; the Landamman and the
magistrates more in proportion. The canton of Schweitz
being for some time discontented with France, withdrew its
troops from that service: but this year (1776) the matter has
been accommodated; and the king pays annually to every
male child of a burgher four livres, commencing from the
time of his birth.</P>
<P>THE same kind of soil, and the same sort of productions,
are common to the two cantons: the whole country being
<PB N="230" REF="253"/>
rugged and mountainous, consists chiefly of pasture, raises
little corn, and has no vines. We cannot but observe with
astonishment, to what a degree of fertility the natives have
improved a land, naturally barren, and for which they
fought with as much zeal and intrepidity, as if they con∣tended
for the richest plains of Sicily or Asia Minor. In
these little democratical states, sumptuary laws are not neces∣sary;
for, they scarcely know, even in idea, what luxury is.
Such indeed is the purity, or (as some perhaps would call it)
the austerity of morals, which still prevails among these peo∣ple,
as cannot easily be imagined by the inhabitants of great
and opulent cities: and I cannot reflect on that affectionate
patriotism which so strongly attaches them to their country,
without calling to mind that beautiful description of the
Swiss peasant, in Goldsmith's Traveller:
<Q><L>“Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,</L>
<L>And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms:</L>
<L>And as a child, when scaring sounds molest,</L>
<L>Clings close and closer to the mother's breast;</L>
<L>So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind's roar,</L>
<L>But bind him to his native mountains more.”</L></Q></P>
<P>EVERY step we now advance is treading, as it were, upon
sacred ground; monuments continually occurring of those
memorable battles, by which the Swiss rescued themselves
from oppression, and secured the enjoyment of their inva∣luable
freedom. I am now indeed in the very center of civil
liberty; would I could add of religious too! but the church
of Rome is here exclusively established. It must be acknow∣ledged,
however, that this intolerant spirit is not wholly con∣fined
<PB N="231" REF="254"/>
to the Catholic cantons; for, in those where the Pro∣testants
prevail, Calvinism is alone admitted: and thus a na∣tion,
who prides herself upon her freedom, denies the free
exercise of religion to every other sect except that which
predominates. Is not this striking at the first principle, and
most valuable privilege, of genuine liberty?</P>
<P>LONG as my letter already is, I cannot forbear mention∣ing
a peculiar custom observed in some of these democratical
states: every person who is chosen for a bailliage, or any lu∣crative
office, is obliged to pay a certain stipulated sum into
the public fund. This practice is attended with one ill con∣sequence
at least; as the successful candidate is in some mea∣sure
authorised to stretch his prerogatives, in order to swell
the profits of his charge. Accordingly it is a general re∣mark,
that in the common bailliages the bailifs, appointed
by the popular cantons, are more apt to be guilty of exac∣tions
than those of the aristocratical republics.</P>

<P>HAVING dispatched my baggage by water to Altdorf, I
walked, in company with Mr. Meyer, member of the Great
Council of Lucerne, through a pleasant plain, lying between
Mount Pilate and an opposite ridge of hills, to Winke, a vil∣lage
situated on an inlet of the lake of Lucerne. There I
took boat, and rowing across the inlet, disembarked near
Alpnach, in the canton of Underwalden, and continued along
a foot-way, which winds through enclosures of rich pasture∣land,
browsed by numerous herds of fine cattle, and prettily
checkered with scattered cottages. Having crossed a small
river, I arrived at Sarne, the capital burgh of that division of
the canton called Oberwalden, wherein the <HI>Land-rath,</HI> or
supreme court of judicature, assembles for the purpose of
deciding civil and criminal processes. This tribunal is com∣posed
of fifty-eight judges, who are chosen by the people,
<PB N="233" REF="256"/>
and continue in office for life. In criminal affairs of any
notoriety, each of these fifty-eight is empowered to bring
into court two individuals; and this whole tribunal, thus
consisting of a hundred and seventy-four members, assembles
in a large open hall in the town-house, and passes final sen∣tence.</P>
<P>AT Sarne I embarked upon the Aa, and ascending its
stream, entered the lake of Sarne: this piece of water, about
three miles long, and one and a half broad, is pleasantly en∣closed
between the mountains, and its rising borders are
richly variegated with pastures and trees. I landed at Saxe∣len,
which stands on its western shore; a neat village much
frequented in these parts, as being the native place of the
celebrated saint and patriot Nicholas de Flue, to whose ho∣nour
a church has been lately erected at a considerable ex∣pence.
The interior is ornamented in a pleasing style of ar∣chitecture.
Ten elegant columns of black marble support the
roof: they are about twenty-four feet in height, and many
of them are of a single piece. They were hewn out of a
quarry in the Melchthal, about nine miles from Saxelen, and
were dragged from thence by the peasants, who voluntarily
performed this task, which they considered as an act of reli∣gious
duty: a laborious enterprise, to convey such heavy
burdens down steep precipices and over rugged pathless rocks,
where they could neither be assisted by horses or oxen!</P>
<P>UNDER a glass-case in the midst of this church, are de∣posited
the bones of this favourite object of national worship,
fantastically ornamented, according to the Roman Catholic
<PB N="234" REF="257"/>
custom, with gold and precious stones. His real burial place
is still to be seen in a small adjoining chapel: it is a simple
grave-stone, on which his figure is coarsely carved in stone,
the work of the age in which he lived. At a small height
over this ancient monument, is placed another grave-stone,
bearing also his figure, executed in later times, less rude, but
still of coarse workmanship. On entering this chapel, I ob∣served
numerous pilgrims of both sexes, who were kneeling
before his tomb, and praying with the greatest fervency.
Many, in the ardour of devotion, threw themselves between
the two grave-stones, and stretching themselves upon the
most antient figure, repeatedly kissed and embraced it.</P>
<P>NICHOLAS de Flue, this object of national enthu∣siasm,
was born at Saxelen in 1417. Descended from an
antient family, he signalized himself in defence of his
country, and particularly during the war which the Swiss
supported against Sigismond archduke of Austria. He was
no less remarkable for humanity than valour. He remon∣strated
to his countrymen preparing to pillage and burn the
convent of St. Margaret near Diessenhosen. He exclaimed:
“If God grants you the victory over your enemies, use it
with moderation; and spare those edifices which are con∣secrated
to him.” This remonstrance was attended with
effect, and the convent was saved from destruction. To the
most excellent qualities of the heart and understanding, to
great political sagacity he added the exterior graces of figure,
dignity of character, and the most winning affability of
manners. Raised by his countrymen to several high em∣ployments
in the state, he repeatedly declined the office of
<PB N="235" REF="258"/>
landamman from motives of delicacy, because he disapprov∣ed
the principles of the governing party. At length,
hurried away by his detestation of evil, and a zeal for
monkish devotion, he quitted his family in the fiftieth year
of his age, and retiring from the world, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of gloomy
superstition turned hermit. The place of his retreat was at
Ranft, a few miles from Saxelen; there he built an her∣mitage
and a small chapel, and practised all the severities
required by that austere mode of life with the strictest ob∣servance.</P>
<P>BUT the flame of patriotism, although smothered in his
breast by an ill-directed zeal for mistaken duties, was not
extinguished; and he was the happy instrument in restoring
Switzerland from the impending horrors of civil discord.
At the conclusion of the war with Charles the Bold, Fri∣burgh
and Soleure contracted an alliance with Zuric, Berne,
and Lucerne. This treaty being considered by Uri, Schweitz,
Underwalden, Zug, and Glarus, as a breach of the former
union, those five cantons refused to receive them. After
various disputes and fruitless conferences, the deputies of
the eight confederate cantons assembled, in 1481, at Stantz,
in order to compromise the differences.</P>
<P>BOTH sides were so heated with mutual animosities,
that the deputies were on the point of separating without
effecting a reconciliation, and a civil war appeared inevita∣ble.
In this crisis of affairs, de Flue no sooner heard, in
the depth of his solitude, of those public dissentions which
threatened a fatal rupture between the confederate cantons,
<PB N="236" REF="259"/>
than his patriotism prevailed over his superstition; and he
quitted his unprofitable hermitage, in order to exert those
active and public virtues, the very lowest of which singly
outweighs whole years of useless and unrequired mortifica∣tions.
Accordingly this extraordinary man, having, in the
64th year of his age, travelled during the night, arrived at
Stantz on the very morning in which the deputies were
preparing for their departure. He earnestly conjured them
to remain; and, having prevailed upon them once more to
assemble, he so forcibly represented to them the destructive
consequences which would attend their disunion, that they
chose him arbiter of the dispute. By his sole mediation all
differences between the contending parties were amicably
adjusted; and Friburgh and Soleure were, by his advice, in∣stantly
received into the Helvetic Confederacy: such was the
effect of his persuasive and conciliatory eloquence! Having
thus happily composed the public dissensions, he returned to
his hermitage, where he died, in 1487, in the 70th year of
his age, regretted and esteemed by all Switzerland. Such
a general opinion of his extreme piety prevailed among
his contemporaries, that the bigotry of those times as∣cribed
to him an exemption from the common wants of
humanity.</P>
<P>IN the register of the church of Saxelen, the following
notice is inscribed for 1485, the year antecedent to his death.
“In 1417, Nicholas de Flue, a saint, was born in the
parish of Saxelen; who afterwards retired into a desart
called Ranst, where God sustained him during eighteen
years, without eating or drinking for a long time, namely,
<PB N="237" REF="260"/>
when this was written; and he is now in good estate, and
of holy life.”</P>
<P>ON his tomb is inscribed the following epitaph: “Ni∣cholas
de Flue quitted his wife and children to go into
the desert; he served God nineteen years and a half with∣out
taking any sustenance. He died 1487.” This frivo∣lous
epitaph strongly marks the bigotted spirit of that dark
age in which it was composed: the narrow-minded author,
totally overlooking the patriot in the hermit, saw nothing
so truly meritorious in the life of the deceased, as his having
suppressed those social and public energies which dignify
human nature, in order to practise the debasing austerities of
a superstitious religionist.—He ought to have inscribed,
“To the memory of Nicholas de Flue, who quitted his her∣mitage
to appear again in the world; restored peace and
harmony to the republics of Switzerland, and served God
by serving his country.”</P>
<P>FROM Saxelen we intended to have visited Ranft, de
Flue's hermitage, and from thence to have proceeded down
the Melchthal and over the mountains to Engelberg; but
as the evening was already beginning to close, we durst not
venture along so difficult a passage, which would have em∣ployed
us at least five hours; we thought it, therefore, most
prudent to continue our route towards Stantz. We fol∣lowed
the foot-paths, which wind agreeably, sometimes
through forests, sometimes over the fields and meadows; and
passed through a fertile but wilder and more romantic part
of the canton, than that which we traversed in the morning.
<PB N="238" REF="261"/>
We continued for some way at the foot of the Stantzberg,
crossed a small plain that was formerly a lake, in which
staples for mooring vessels are occasionally discovered; and,
in about three hours after our departure from Saxelin, ar∣rived
at Stantz, in the dusk of the evening.</P>
<P>ABOUT three miles from Stantz is a small wood called
the <HI>Kern-wald,</HI> which we passed through in our route from
Saxelen: it would not have been worthy of mention, if it
did not separate the canton into two divisions, called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Above the wood, and Below the wood; <HI>wald</HI> in German signifying a wood.</NOTE> <HI>Ober∣wald</HI>
and <HI>Underwald.</HI> Formerly the whole canton was under
the same general administration; but the inhabitants of the
two districts separating upon some dispute, have since
formed two republics, and have each their <HI>lands-gemeind,</HI> or
general assembly, their landamman, and council of regency:
for the management of external affairs, there is a joint∣council,
chosen equally by the two divisions; at the Hel∣vetic
Diet they send but one deputy, and regulate their vote
by mutual consent.</P>
<P>STANTZ is the seat of civil and criminal judicature; and
it is worthy of remark, that every male of the age of thirty
is permitted to give his vote for the acquittance or condem∣nation
of a criminal. Stantz, the capital of Underwalden, is
situated in a beautiful plain of pasture, about two or three
miles in breadth, at the foot of the Stantzberg, and at a little
distance from the lake of Lucerne. The town and environs,
which are delightfully sprinkled with numerous cottages,
<PB N="239" REF="262"/>
are, for so small a place, extremely populous, comprising,
perhaps, not less than five thousand souls. The church is
a tolerably handsome building, and is decorated in the inside
with ten black marble pillars of large dimensions, but not
so beautiful as those at Saxelen. The women in these parts
dress their heads in a singular manner, and extremely un∣becoming:
they wear black-beaver cocked hats, similar to
those of the men, with black ears to their caps, which almost
conceal their hair.</P>
<P>THE next morning the abbot of Engelberg, having been
previously informed of our intended visit, politely sent
horses to Stantz; and we rode through a fertile valley, en∣closed
between the Stanzberg and a chain of hills, until we
arrived at Graffen-ort, a small villa belonging to the abbot,
about two leagues from Stantz. Here we began to ascend
along a road winding by the side of a steep precipice, and
through “<HI>unsunned sorests</HI>” of beech intermingled with
poplar, mountain-ash, Spanish chesnuts, and pines, the tor∣rent
Aa impetuously foaming in a stony channel, and
forming a succession of cataracts. The wild horrors of the
circumjacent rocks, the incessant roaring of the waters, and
the solitary gloom of the forest, reminded me of Gray's
beautiful Ode on the Grande Chartreuse, in which he de∣scribes
similar scenes with a sublimity and truth which every
person of taste, who travels through these magnificent
regions, must feel and admire.</P>
<Q><L>Per invias rupes, fera per juga,</L>
<L>Clivosque praeruptos, sonantes</L>
<L>Inter aquas, nemorumque noctem.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="240" REF="263"/>
ISSUING from the dark forest, we descended for a little
way; and unanimously broke into an exclamation of sur∣prise
and delight, as we suddenly looked down upon a pictu∣resque
plain of an oval shape beautifully wooded, watered by
several lively streams, enclosed within a circle of gentle hills,
and terminated by a majestic amphitheatre of “<HI>cloud-capt
alps:</HI>” toward the extremity of this plain, the abbey, a
large quadrangular building of stone, is situated, at the foot
of the <HI>Engelberg,</HI> or Mountain of <HI>Angels,</HI> from which the
whole district takes its name. On alighting from our horses,
the abbot politely received and conducted us into a large sa∣loon,
where soon afterwards dinner was served with all the
plenty of feudal times, and all the comforts of the present age.
The company at table consisted of the abbot, five or six be∣nedictines,
ourselves, and our servants, who, according to the
custom of the place, sat down to the same hospitable board
with their masters. This intermixture of society, the polite∣ness
of the worthy abbot, and the facetious cheerfulness of
one among the fathers, rendered the repast as agreeable as it
was uncommon. After dinner we visited the library, which
contains about ten thousand volumes; and, among many
rare editions, above two hundred printed in the fifteenth
century. I noticed a much larger collection of modern his∣torical
and miscellaneous works, than are usually found
within the walls of a monastery; which does honour to the
taste of the abbot, and proves him to be a warm friend to
polite literature.</P>
<P>THE weather being sine and clear, I strayed about the
environs; admiring the scattered hamlets, the beautiful tufts
<PB REF="264"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="241" REF="265"/>
of wood, and the lively streams which murmur through the
plain: of these, one called the Melt-bach, which I observed
issuing copiously from the ground, begins to flow on the
first melting of the snow in the month of May, and ceases to∣wards
the end of September; and the Griesen-bach, that
rises at the foot of Mount Blake, runs only from mid-day to
the setting sun. Several other torrents, that pour down
from the neighbouring glaciers, and numerous springs that
burst from the ground near the abbey, help to supply the
Aa, which rushes from Suren alps, and, swelled with these
tributary waters, hastens to throw itself into the lake of
Lucerne. The amphitheatre of cloud-capt mountains, is
formed by the Melkleberg, the Arniberg, the Blakeberg, the
Spitze-stock, the Suren alps with their brown peaks boldly
rising from the bosom of the snow, the Engelberg towering
in naked majesty, and, the most elevated and most beautiful
in the whole chain, Mount Titlis, supporting on its top an
immense glacier.</P>
<P>ABOUT seven in the afternoon we sat down to supper; in
the midst of the repast we were suddenly struck with an
awful thunder-storm, which, though it could not be called
the music of the spheres, or such as, according to the legends
of the abbey, was performed on the top of the Engelberg,
by a choir of angels, at the consecration of the convent; yet
produced a most sublime effect, when re-echoed by the sur∣rounding
mountains.</P>
<P>THE abbot of this convent, chosen by a majority of six∣teen
benedictines, who compose the chapter, is sovereign
<PB N="242" REF="266"/>
lord over the land of Engelberg, a small tract of country
about sixty miles in circumference, and under the protection
of Lucerne, Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden. The only ha∣bitable
part of this district is the small plain in which the
abbey is situated, that contains fifteen hundred souls: the
remaining portion, being entirely mountainous, affords in
summer a retreat to numerous herds of cattle. The abbot,
to whom we were indebted for so polite a reception, is Leo∣digar
Saltzman, a native of Lucerne, who, since his elevation
to his present dignity, has been a kind and indulgent master:
finding many of his subjects extremely poor and indolent, he
has excited them to industry; and, in order to assist them
during the winter months, when agriculture is suspended,
he employs them in winding silk, which he imports from
Italy. He possesses very considerable power, which renders
him nearly absolute. In all criminal cases he arrests and im∣prisons;
appoints the person who examines; can order, if he
thinks it necessary, the infliction of torture; and can pardon
or mitigate the sentence given by the tribunal of the coun∣try,
called <HI>landsgericht.</HI> In civil causes his influence is very
considerable; he appoints, from twelve candidates selected
by the people, the seven judges, who, in conjunction with
the <HI>thalamman</HI> and <HI>stathalter,</HI> form the above-mentioned
<HI>landsgericht,</HI> which decides in the first resort: he can also
displace them if he pleases; and absolutely nominates all the
judges of the <HI>geistlichen-gericht,</HI> or ecclesiastical court, which
receives appeals from the decisions of the former tribunal.
His power is restricted in the following instances. If he is
engaged in a law-suit with an individual, the award of the
country tribunal is final; and if with the whole community,
<PB N="243" REF="267"/>
the question is decided by the four cantons of Lucerne, Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden.</P>
<P>HIS revenues amount to about £. 5000; and are derived
partly from tythes of certain estates in the free bailliages of
Switzerland, from a few feudal rights, but principally from
the exportation of cheeses. Beside those which are made on
the pastures belonging to the abbey, he purchases others
from the peasants of his little territory, and disposes of the
whole on his own account. About eighteen hundred cows,
including those which are the property of the convent, are
possessed by the natives of Engelberg, and annually supply
cream for about 10,000 cheeses, each weighing from 25 to
50 pounds, and selling, on an average, for fifteen florins, or
one pound five shillings per hundred weight: and it may be
calculated that the abbot circulates annually to the value of
£. 4000. This revenue, however, cannot be considered as
his own private property; for he pays the current expences
of the abbey.</P>
<P>SEVERAL ineffectual expeditions having been made to∣wards
attaining the summit of Mount Titlis, the most ele∣vated
mountain in these parts, and perhaps scarcely inferior
to the Schreckhorn and Jungfrauhorn; it was for a long
time considered as inaccessible: but, as tradition reported,
that in the year 1739, three men had ascended it, Mr. Frey∣grabend,
a native of Engelberg, and physician to the abbot,
a few days after my departure from the convent, succeeded
in a similar attempt. The following account of this expe∣dition
<PB N="244" REF="268"/>
is extracted from a German letter, written by Frey∣grabend
to a friend at Lucerne.</P>
<P>“EARLY in the morning on the 14th of September,” the
weather being fine and clear, I set out with eleven compani∣ons,
among whom were Jerom Dopler and Conrad Stocher,
two friars of the convent. About two in the morning, after
ascending through Gerschne, and Unter and Ober-laub, we
reached, at break of day, the summit of the Laubergrat. Here
we enjoyed a fine view over the canton of Underwalden, the
lake and canton of Lucerne, the free bailliages of Switzer∣land,
and the canton of Zug. Having taken some refresh∣ment,
and reposed ourselves a quarter of an hour, we put
on our crampons, and pursued our route, eager like the
giants of old, to scale the steep sides of Mount Faulblatten.
We continued for about an hour along the picked ridge of
this mountain, tottering by the side of tremendous preci∣pices,
and twice climbing an ascent almost perpendicular.
We could not observe any trace of the smallest vege∣tation.
Having gained the highest point of the Faulblat∣ten,
we arrived at a glacier, which being fortunately co∣vered
with fresh snow, rendered the ice less slippery than
usual.</P>
<P>“HITHERTO our course had been attended with some
danger, but from hence we ascended, and reached, with little
difficulty, the top of the Titlis, called <HI>Nollen.</HI> But here we
were obliged to cross a deep chasm, and to mount the sides
of the ice, which were as perpendicular as a wall, by form∣ing
<PB N="245" REF="269"/>
steps for our feet with the iron spikes of our poles: be∣low
us was a valley of ice about sixteen miles in length, de∣scending
rapidly towards Oberhasli. It was now about ten
in the morning, and the sun was extremely bright. Having
walked a few paces, the prospect was on all sides open and
unbounded. This sublime, yet dreary scene, though it sur∣passes
all description, made an impression on my mind which
I shall never forget.”</P>
<P>“HERE the painter and poet would find ample and end∣less
employment, if the colours of the former and the con∣ceptions
of the latter could resist the effects of the extreme
cold. The first objects which caught our attention, were
the alps of the Vallais, Berne, and Savoy, with their glaciers
and vallies of ice, a majestic and tremendous scene. Among
numerous mountains which rose before us, Mont-Blanc,
though at some distance, reared its head above the rest; near
us towered the Schreckhorn, Wetterhorn, and Jungfrau∣horn,
but less elevated in appearance than the point on
which we stood. Below us we observed a valley of ice about
two miles in breadth, and of such immense length, that one
extremity seemed to join Mont-Blanc, and the other to be
closed by the Titlis. To the east, the Rothstock, the Plan∣gen,
and the mountains of Uri, neither so wild nor so ele∣vated
as those to the south; and towards the north-west, the
eye reposed itself over the less dreary and more cultivated
parts of Switzerland, as far as the borders of Alsace and Sua∣bia.
Immediately below us we noticed the abbey; and we
heard the sound of several mortars, which the abbot ordered
to be fired as a signal that we were also seen: by means of a”
<PB N="246" REF="270"/>
small telescope I observed the fire and smoke; and five mi∣nutes
elapsed before the sound reached us, not in a strait di∣rection,
but re-echoed between the surrounding rocks. We
had proposed to kindle a fire, and to let off some hand-gre∣nades,
but the cold prevented us from striking fire. Not
being able to support its extremity more than three quar∣ters
of an hour, although the sun shone very bright, and we
kept ourselves in continual motion, we placed a black flag on
the highest point.</P>
<P>“WE were as fortunate in descending as in mounting.
We came to the Under-Titlis at half past eleven; to the
Laubergrat at one, where we again took some refreshment;
and having let off our grenades, we reached the abbey at five
in the afternoon. We felt no other inconvenience from this
expedition, than that our faces were swelled and our skins
peeled, from the reflection of the sun; and that for some
hours after my return to Engelberg, I lost my sight and my
hearing, both which however I soon recovered. Undoubt∣edly
the Titlis is the highest mountain in Switzerland, ex∣cepting
Mont-Blanc, to which it is not much inferior.”</P>
<P>IT is to be regretted, that this expedition was only a mere
object of curiosity; and that the ingenious physician carried
with him neither thermometer nor barometer. His assertion
that the Titlis is higher than any mountain in Switzerland,
will, for this reason, and without farther proofs, admit of
much doubt; and its elevation, though very considerable,
must be greatly inferior to that of Mont-Blanc; as will ap∣pear
by considering that the expedition from the plain of
<PB N="247" REF="271"/>
Engelberg to the top of the Titlis was performed in eight
hours; whereas Dr. Paccard and James Balma employed
fifteen in attaining the summit of Mont-Blanc; and the place
from which they took their departure, is probably much
higher above the level of the sea than the valley of En∣gelberg.</P>
<P><DATE>August 25.</DATE></P>
<P>TRAVELLERS, in going from Engelberg to Altdorf, usual∣ly
return to Stantz or Buochs, embark on the lake of Lu∣cerne,
and proceed the rest of the way by water; but as I
had already visited those places, I preferred following the
route across the mountains. The morning being obscure
and rainy, we were detained till nine o'clock, when the
weather clearing up I set out, in company with Messrs. Bal∣thazar
and Meyer, of Lucerne. Passing through the plain of
Engelberg, we admired, on our left, a fine waterfall which
precipitates itself from mount Engel, and in about a league
arrived at a cottage belonging to the abbey, where we found
two peasants employed in making cheeses, and where we re∣galed
ourselves with some excellent cream. From this point
we mounted gently by the side of the Aa, leaving on our
right the high Suren alps, whose pointed tops occasionally
burst forth amid the clouds and vapours; about a mile from
the cottage we quitted the abbot's horses, walked up a gra∣dual
ascent, passed a superb cataract of the Aa, and reached a
chapel noted in these parts for a small bell, which, according
to tradition, was the gift of a French traveller. Near this
chapel we observed a hut, which is in the canton of Uri, and
from thence the ascent was steeper, but not difficult; we
<PB N="248" REF="272"/>
crossed many drifts of snow, and were incommoded by a
keen wind and frequent showers of sleet, hail, and rain.
At length, in about four hours after our departure from the
abbey, we reached a cross planted on the highest point;
from which elevation we should have enjoyed a most superb
view, greatly admired by travellers, on one side towards Uri
and the chain of the St. Gothard, and on the other towards
Engelberg and the lake of Lucerne, if the weather had not
totally obscured the prospect. From this point the Titlis is
much extolled for its beautiful and majestic appearance.</P>
<P>FROM hence we descended the Enkeberg into a most
barren region, amid a harvest of pointed rocks, and over
numerous drifts of snow, and fallen fragments of stone, in∣termixed
with small patches of russet herbage, which contri∣buted
to render the scene still more dreary. Our descent
along a bare slippery rock of slate, or in the beds of torrents,
or over large masses of ice and snow, continued above an
hour and an half, when we observed several huts lying in
a small plain. From their first appearance we concluded that
we should presently reach them, but the precipices were so
steep, the paths so rugged, and the distance so much greater
than we at first imagined, that it employed us above an hour
and an half.</P>
<P>THE little valley, in which these huts are situated, is call∣ed
<HI>Wald-nacht Alp,</HI> contains a small quantity of underwood,
and feeds a hundred and thirty-three cows, beside a few
sheep, goats, and hogs. The peasants employed in tending
the cattle and making cheese, usually arrive on the 20th of
<PB N="249" REF="273"/>
June, and remain about a hundred days: the owner of the
hut in which we dried our clothes, makes every day, during
that period, two cheeses of twenty-five pounds each, from
the milk of eighteen cows. Having taken some refresh∣ment,
and recovered our fatigue, we continued along the
valley, through some groves of poplars and firs, and at its
furthest extremity we came to a single cottage seated on an
eminence, the first house on this side which is habitable in
winter. A little further we had a prospect of the town and
environs of Altdorf; the fertile vale of Schackeren, which,
though a very steep ascent, yet from this elevation seemed a
level plain; the lake of Uri, scarcely visible, which looked
like a small rivulet; and the distant mountains reaching be∣yond
the St. Gothard. The descent, through rich fields and
pastures, was extremely steep and tedious, as the grass was
rendered slippery by the rain; and we did not arrive at Alt∣dorf
till seven in the evening, wet and exceedingly fatigued,
but much pleased with our expedition. This passage from
Engelberg to Altdorf is estimated at seven leagues. A <HI>chas∣seur</HI>
may perform it in four hours; a traveller accustomed to
mountains, in six; and a person unused to such fatigue, will
require eight or ten hours.</P>

<P>SWITZERLAND, indeed, is a most delightful country,
and merits the particular observation of the traveller,
as well for the diversity of the several governments, as for
the wonderful beauties of nature: but the impositions of
the innkeepers, and the difficulty of procuring horses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would recommend to all travellers, who traverse the canton of Uri in order to visit the alps, either to hire horses at Lu∣cerne, or to bespeak them against their arrival at Altdorf. If we fortunately had not taken the latter precaution, we should have sound no less difficulty in procuring horses in 1785, than in 1776; notwith∣standing all the good offices of our landlord at the Black Lion; who, knowing that I was the author of Letters on Switzerland, was extremely andious to wipe away certain aspersions, which, in the beginning of this letter, seem to glance at his native town. The two Mr. Cliffords, whom we met at Engelberg, and who, to our great satisfaction, accompanied us in our tour as far as Geneva, were obliged to pursue their journey on foot, not being able to procure more than one horse, which was appropriated to their bag∣gage.</NOTE>, are
inevitable taxes for the enjoyment of these its <HI>delights.</HI>
These little inconveniences, however, should be borne with
patience and good humour; nor will I trouble you with any
splenetic complaints of those unpleasant circumstances which
must occur to all travellers.</P>
<P>ON quitting Altdorf, we passed at first through a fertile
plain of pasture, in which the inhabitants were employed in
<PB N="251" REF="275"/>
mowing the second crop of hay; and in about nine miles
began ascending. The road winds continually along the
steep sides of the mountains; and the Reuss in many places
entirely fills up the bottom of the valley, which is very
narrow: that river sometimes appeared several hundred
yards below us; here rushing a considerable way through a
forest of pines; there falling in cascades, and losing itself in
the valley. We passed it several times, over bridges of a
single arch, and beheld it tumbling under our feet in chan∣nels
which it had forced through the solid rock; innumera∣ble
torrents roaring down the sides of the mountains; which
were sometimes bare, sometimes finely wooded, with here
and there some fantastic trees clothing the sides of the pre∣cipice,
and half obscuring the river from our view. The
darkness and solitude of the forests; the occasional liveliness
and variety of the verdure; immense fragments of rock
blended with enormous masses of ice; rocks of an astonish∣ing
height piled upon one another, and shutting in the
vale;—such are the sublime and magnificent scenes with
which this romantic country abounds. Near Wasen, is the
valley of Meyen; the torrent that dashes through it, and
falls into the Reuss, forms a series of most superb cataracts,
which the traveller may enjoy by venturing to the edge of
the precipice, and supporting himself against an impending
pine, that overlooks the gulf.</P>
<P>WE set out this morning early from Wasen, a small vil∣lage
where we passed the night; and continued advancing
for some way on a rugged ascent, through the same wild
and beautiful tract of country, which I have just attempted
<PB N="252" REF="276"/>
to describe. We could scarcely walk a hundred yards
without crossing several torrents, that rolled with violence
from the tops of the mountains. This being one of the
great passages into Italy, we met many pack-horses laden
with merchandise: and as the road in particular parts is
very narrow, it required some dexterity in the horses to pass
one another without jostling. These roads, impending over
precipices, cannot fail of inspiring terror to those travellers,
who are unaccustomed to them; and more particularly as the
mules and horses do not keep in the middle of the track,
but continue crossing from the side of the mountain towards
the edge of an abyss, then turn aslant abruptly; thus form∣ing,
if I may so express myself, a constant zig-zag.</P>
<P>THUS far the valley of Schoellenen appeared to be
tolerably well peopled; and we passed through several vil∣lages
situated towards the bottom and less narrow part of the
valley: the sides of the mountains were occasionally strewed
with cottages; covered with forests; or enriched with pas∣tures.
Still continuing to ascend, the country beyond Wasen
suddenly changing, became more wild and perfectly desert:
there were no traces of any trees, except here and there a
stubbed pine; the rocks were bare, craggy, and impending;
not the least sign of any habitation; and scarcely a blade
of grass to be seen. We then came to a bridge thrown
across a deep chasm over the Reuss, which here forms a
considerable cataract down the shagged sides of the moun∣tain,
and over immense fragments of rock which it has un∣determined
in its course. This bridge is called <HI>Teusels-bruck,</HI>
or the Devil's bridge. As we stood upon the bridge ad∣miring
<PB N="253" REF="277"/>
the cataract, we were covered with a kind of drizz∣ling
rain; the river throwing up the spray to a considerable
height. These are sublime scenes of horror, of which those
who have not been spectators, can form no competent idea:
they defy the representations of painting or poetry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many travellers have been disap∣pointed on the <HI>first</HI> view of the Devil's bridge. It ought therefore to be remarked, that the bridge itself, though of difficult ex∣ecution, is a trifling object, and not so stupendous as many others in Switzerland; and that it is the wild and majestic scenery that astonishes and exalts the beholder.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOT far from this desolate landscape, the road led us into
the <HI>Urner-loch,</HI> a subterraneous passage hollowed through a
rock of granite<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This passage was hollowed in 1707, by Peter Moretini, a native of Val-Maggia, at the expence of the inhabitants in the valley of Urferen. It is nine feet in breadth, ten in height, and two hundred and twenty in length.</NOTE>, which opened at the opposite entrance into
the serene and cultivated valley of Urseren: the objects that
presented themselves were, a village backed by a high
mountain, on the sides of which was a wood of pines; pea∣sants
at work in the fields; cattle feeding in the meadows;
and the Reuss, which lately dashed over rude fragments of
rock in a continual cataract, now flowed silently and smooth∣ly;
while the sun, which had been hidden from us in the
deep valley, here shone in full splendour. In general there
is a regular gradation from extreme wildness to high culti∣vation;
but here the transition was abrupt, and the change
instantaneous: it was like the lifting up a curtain, and
had all the appearance of enchantment.</P>
<P>IN this valley are four villages, Urseren, Hopital, Realp,
and Zundorf; forming a small republic under the protection
<PB N="254" REF="278"/>
of Uri. The territory of this little commonwealth is about
nine miles in length and two in breadth, and contains about
thirteen hundred souls. The people elect, in their general
assembly, their <HI>Talamman</HI> or chief, as also some other magis∣trates:
and there is a permanent council of fifteen members,
who assemble in each of the different districts. The inhabi∣tants
enjoy great privileges; but are not absolutely indepen∣dent:
for in civil causes an appeal lies from their courts of
justice to Altdorf; and in criminal proceedings, two deputies
from the government of Uri are present at the trial, and de∣liver
to the judges of the valley the opinion of the council of
Altdorf.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the considerable elevation of this
valley, and the coldness of the air even at this season of the
year, it produces excellent pasture. The only wood therein,
is the small plantation of pines above the village of Urseren,
which is preserved with uncommon care and reverence, and
a small quantity of under-wood and stubbed willows, that
feather the banks of the Reuss. In the adjacent country
there are several mines of chrystal; of which a considera∣ble
quantity is exported. The language of the country is a
kind of provincial German, but almost every person speaks
Italian.</P>
<P>THE valley of Urseren is a small plain surrounded by high
mountains, covered with pasture to a considerable height,
whose tops are barren rocks, in many parts capped with
snow. Near the middle of this beautiful plain we turned to
the left, and entered the valley of St. Gothard, filled with
<PB N="255" REF="279"/>
the ruins of broken mountains; the Reuss, a most rapid and
vehement torrent, bursting through it; on each side, im∣mense
shattered blocks of granite, of a beautiful greyish co∣lour
(and of which the summits of these alps are composed)
confusedly piled together.</P>
<P>THE valley of St. Gothard, though not so wild as that of
Schoellenen, is yet exceedingly dreary. It does not contain a
single shed, or produce a single tree; and the sides of the
mountains are barely sprinkled with short herbage. The
extremity is closed by the still ruder and naked rocks of the
Feudo, supporting in its hollows vast masses of snow, while
the superb glacier of the Locendro towers above the adjacent
heights. It is about two leagues from Urseren to this place;
but the road, considering the ruggedness of the rocks and
the steepness of the ascent, is not incommodious: it is from
nine to twelve feet broad; and is almost as well paved as the
streets of London.</P>
<P>WE are now lodged at a house inhabited by two Italian
friars from the convent of Capuchins at Milan, who receive
all strangers that pass through these inhospitable regions. One
of the friars is absent, so that I am in possession of his bed∣chamber:
it is a snug little room, where any man may sleep
very well without being an anchorite; and which, after the
fatigues of our journey, I enjoy with a satisfaction much too
sensible to envy the luxury of a palace. Our host has just
supplied us with a dinner, consisting of delicious trout, with
which the neighbouring lake of Locendro abounds, eggs,
<PB N="256" REF="280"/>
and milk, together with excellent butter and cheese; both
made in this dreary spot.</P>
<P>UPON our arrival we were rejoiced to find a good fire;
the weather being so exceedingly cold, that I, who was only
clad in a thin camlet coat, entered the house half frozen. It is
singular to find, at the distance of only a day's journey, such
a difference in the climate: the air is absolutely in a freezing
state; and I just now passed a boy at work, who was blowing
his fingers to warm them. If the cold is so piercing in the
midst of summer, how intolerable must it prove in Decem∣ber?
The snow begins to fall the latter end of September;
and the lakes about this spot are frozen during eight months
in the year.</P>
<P>I AM just returned from visiting the sources of the Tesino
and the Reuss; which rise within a short distance of each
other. The Tesino has three principal sources in the chain
of the St. Gothard. The first is a spring which rises towards
the bottom of the Prosa, and is entirely covered with frozen
snow, or, when that is melted, with fallen fragments of rock,
through which it trickles in numerous currents, that unite
and help to form a small lake: from this piece of water it
communicates with two other lakes, and issues in a more
considerable torrent. The lake of La Sella, in another part
of the eastern chain, supplies the second source; and the
third is furnished by the snows of Mount Feudo. These
three sources uniting with another branch, that flows from
the Furca through the valley of Bedreto, form one great
torrent, which takes its course towards the south, enters the
<PB N="259" REF="281"/>
lake of Locarno, and traversing part of the Milanese, falls
into the Po. The source of the Reuss is the lake of Locen∣dro,
an oblong piece of water about three miles in circum∣ference,
which is embosomed between the mountains of Pe∣tina
and Locendro, and is almost entirely supplied by the im∣mense
glaciers which crown the summit of the Locendro.
The stream issuing from this lake rushes down the valley of
St. Gothard, and joining in the vale of Urseren the two
branches which come from the Furca on one side, and from
the Grison mountains on the other, flows towards the north
into the lake of Lucerne, and from thence throws itself into
the Aar. In allusion to the opposite courses of the Tesino
and the Reuss, M. de Boufflers said, that from the top of the
St. Gothard, a man might spit into the ocean and the Medi∣terranean.</P>
<P>WITHIN a day's journey is the source of the Rhine in the
Grisons; and about the distance of three leagues, that of the
Rhone in the Furca: which mountain we shall pass to∣morrow.
We are still surrounded by very high, rugged
rocks, and inaccessible glaciers; so that our view is much
confined; and though I walked above a league towards Italy,
in hopes of enjoying an extensive prospect over that de∣lightful
country, yet I could observe nothing but rocks, pre∣cipices,
and torrents.</P>
<P>I AM at this instant near<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to Mr. de Saussure, the spot upon which the house of the Capuchin <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i iars is built, is 1,061 French toises above the sea.</NOTE> seven thousand feet perpendi∣cular
above the level of the sea: no inconsiderable height,
<PB N="260" REF="282"/>
most certainly. Nevertheless, if I gave credit to those, who
assert, that this mountain is the loftiest point of Europe, I
should raise myself in idea above twice as high: but I have
reason to think, that this opinion is founded upon false cal∣culations.
Mikeli, who measured the principal mountains
of Switzerland, but who is very inaccurate in his calcula∣tions,
considers the St. Gothard as the highest; and he esti∣mates
its elevation above the sea as equal to 17,600 feet. But
the truth is, that, so far from being of that height, it is by
no means the highest ground of Switzerland; and there is
probably not one mountain, either in Europe, Asia, or Afri∣ca,
of that altitude. According to General Pfiffer, the sum∣mit
of the St. Gothard rises above the sea 9,075 feet: an ele∣vation
considerably less than that of Aetna and Teneriff; and
still inferior to several mountains in the great chain of alps,
to which we are bending our course.</P>

<P>ON my entrance into the little plain in which the friar's
house is situated, although the air was exceedingly keen, I
did not experience that piercing cold which I felt in 1776:
but the day was fine, and the sun shone unclouded. When
we arrived at the house, the friar was saying mass to an au∣dience
of about twenty persons; many of whom descend
from the neighbouring alps, where they are tending cattle,
to divine service on Sundays and festivals. At the conclu∣sion
of mass, the friar, whose name is Francis, immediately
recollected, and received me with great satisfaction. He is
<PB N="261" REF="283"/>
well known to all travellers that pass this way, having al∣ready
inhabited this dreary spot above twenty years. Since
my last expedition, he has considerably enlarged his house,
and rendered it extremely commodious. It contains at pre∣sent,
beside several sitting-rooms, kitchens, and one apart∣ment
for the family, nine small but neat bedchambers ap∣propriated
to travellers. The expence of this addition has
already amounted to £. 300, part of which he collected in
various districts of Switzerland; and an equal sum is re∣quired
to discharge the present debts, and to make the fur∣ther
necessary improvements; which sum he intends to pro∣cure
by another collection. Friar Francis obligingly accom∣panied
me about the environs, and favoured me with the fol∣lowing
particulars, in addition to my former account.</P>
<P>THE chain of mountains, which immediately surround
this place, takes the general appellation of St. Gothard; and
its particular parts are called by different names; of which
the principal are, the Salla, Prosa, and Surecha, to the east;
the Feudo, the Petina, and the Locendro, to the west; to the
north, the Ursino; and to the south, the ridge of naked and
piked rocks of the Val-Maggia. Of these the Feudo is the
most elevated: its highest point rises above 2,000 feet above
the plain in which stands the friar's house, and requires three
hours to reach it. There are six pastures on the neighbour∣ing
heights; on which are fed two hundred cows, a hundred
and fifty goats, and thirty horses.</P>
<P>ON examining, at mid-day, Reaumur's thermometer,
placed in the shade in a northern aspect, I was much sur∣prised
to find, that the mercury stood at 6 6/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> above freezing
<PB N="262" REF="284"/>
point, or 46 of Fahrenheit, although the northern wind was
exceedingly keen, and, if I had judged from my own feel∣ings,
I should have concluded that the air was in a freezing
state.</P>
<P>ABOUT four years ago, the elector of Bavaria sent to the
friar several barometers, thermometers, and other meteorolo∣gical
instruments, which has enabled him to note the va∣riations
of the atmosphere, and to form a series of observa∣tions,
of which he favoured me with the following result.
In the most extreme cold he ever experienced in these parts,
the mercury in Reaumur's thermometer fell to 19 degrees
below freezing point, or—10 of Fahrenheit. In 1784.
Greatest heat on the 13th of September, it stood at 13, or
61 1/2 of Fahrenheit. Greatest cold at—17, or—8 1/2 of Fahren∣heit.

OF THE RHONE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Munster in the Vallais, <DATE>August 11.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Arrived here late yesterday evening; and so fatigued
that I was incapable of writing: but I am this morning
quite refreshed with a comfortable sleep, and in spirits to
continue my journal. I took leave of our host of St. Go∣thard,
after having wished him a pleasant winter in that
dreary situation; and walked alone, for about two leagues,
down the valley of St. Gothard. I frequently quit my com∣pany,
and either go before, or stay behind, that I may enjoy
uninterrupted, and with a sort of melancholy pleasure, these
sublime exhibitions of Nature in her most awful and tre∣mendous
forms. I entered the valley of Urseren at Hopital;
and was again struck with the strong contrast between that
cultivated vale and the desolate country I had just quitted.
At the same time I enjoyed a magnificent view of the high
chain that encloses the vale of Urseren; and particularly no∣ticed
the towering rocks, which stand in the country of the
Grisons, one of them supporting on its rugged top a glacier,
from which the Rhine takes its rise. We passed through
the small village of Zundorf; and stopped at Realp, to pro∣cure
refreshment, and bait our horses. From thence we
soon arrived at the extremity of the valley of Urseren;
where we began ascending a path so narrow, steep, and
rugged, that I could not forbear suspecting we had missed
<PB N="264" REF="286"/>
our way, as it seemed almost impracticable for horses: upon
their arrival, however, I mounted, being fatigued with my
walk from St. Gothard to Realp. It was a single path, up a
steep mountain, where a horse, with some dexterity, could
just put one leg before the other: and this path sometimes
lay upon the edge of a precipice, very craggy and stony;
where, if the steed had happened to stumble, we must both
inevitably have perished. But as I knew he had no more
fancy than myself to roll down the precipice, I flung the
bridle upon his mane, and entrusted myself to his direction.
Nor had I any reason to repent of my confidence: for, in
the bad and dangerous parts, he never once tripped; where
it was smoother and safer, indeed, he knew he had a licence
to be more careless.</P>
<P>WE came at length to a torrent, which we passed by
means of a plank, after having got our horses over with
some difficulty: a little way farther we arrived at another,
deeper and more violent than the former, over which there
was no bridge; nor the least appearance of any track on the
other side; a considerable distance from any habitation; and
our guide unacquainted with the road. After some observa∣tion
we discovered, that the mountain had lately fallen down,
and overwhelmed the path; leaving only a very faint narrow
track on the side of the precipice: along which my compa∣nions
scrambled upon their hands and knees. While I was
crossing the torrent on horseback, I heard a scream; and
turning round, saw one of our servants seized with a panic
on the very edge of the precipice, and vehemently exclaim∣ing,
that he could neither get backwards or forwards. Ne∣vertheless,
<PB N="265" REF="287"/>
with some assistance, he passed over; declaring,
at the same time, that he would take care never to put him∣self
again in a similar situation. We now regained a kind of
path, but so extremely steep, that we prudently dismounted,
and suffered the horses to make their own way. With much
difficulty, and after having crossed several large drifts of ice
and snow, the torrents at the same time rumbling under our
feet; we reached, by a very steep ascent, the summit of the
Furca. A number of rugged and forked rocks, piled one
above another, have occasioned, it is said, this chain to be
called the <HI>Furca.</HI> The country immediately around was as
dreary and desolate as the valley of Schoellenen; all vegeta∣tion
seemed to have ceased: lower down, the mountains
were covered with h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbage and sweet-scented flowers; near
us, but higher, on the left, between the Blaueberg and the
Lungnetz, lay a large body of ice, from which issued a tor∣rent
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was informed by a friar of Realp, who is much used to travel in these parts, that this torrent, which is turbid in sum∣mer, is, in winter, as transparent as the clearest spring; and that when the accumu∣lation of the snow prevents it from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowing under the glacier of the Furea, it then forms a lake, runs over the ice, and rushes to the Vallais with the waters it receives in its course.</NOTE>, probably one of the first sources of the Rhone. In a
word, the several majestic objects that presented themselves
to our view, formed a most astonishing scene.</P>
<P>FROM hence we descended broken rocks and craggy pre∣cipices
for a considerable way. By this time I was so consi∣derably
fatigued, that I was glad to sit down, and take some
refreshment, consisting of bread, cheese, and hard eggs; the
only provision we could procure at Realp. We were seated
by a stream of clear water ripling down the side of a moun∣tain,
<PB N="266" REF="288"/>
so exceedingly steep, that our humble repast would
have rolled away, if it had not been well supported. In full
view before us was the glacier of the Furca; an immense
valley of ice, extending at least three miles in length, and
near a mile in breadth between the Gletcherberg and the
Satzberg, rocks more shagged, if possible, than any of the
neighbouring mountains: it stretches from their feet, fills
up the intervening chasm, and reaches almost to their sum∣mits.
The sun shining in an opposite direction, it glistened
like chrystal; while the blue tints, reflected on the surface,
appeared inexpressibly beautiful. The ice seemed to break
in several parts, as we heard some loud and deep cracks; the
torrent of the Rhone at the same time roaring beneath.
That river is chiefly formed by this glacier: the small tor∣rent,
which bursts from the body of ice between the Blaue∣berg
and the Lungnetz, being joined by several streams,
loses itself under the vast arch of ice that forms the bottom
of the glacier; issues considerably augmented; and is the
great and principal source from whence the Rhone takes its
rise. The range of mountains on which we were sitting,
was overspread with underwood and herbage; and some
cattle were feeding along the heights: a fine contrast to the
sterility of the opposite chain; which appeared, for some ex∣tent,
nothing but bare rock, except where it was covered
with ice and frozen snow.</P>
<P>AFTER we had finished our banquet, and reposed our∣selves
for a short time, contemplating the singularity of the
scene; we descended to the bottom of the glacier, where we
admired the Rhone breaking forth with violence from the
<PB N="267" REF="289"/>
bed of ice, near the huge fragments of a fallen rock. We
followed the course of that river, and proceeded down a
mountain so steep, that several parts of the road winding
along its sides, were frequently parallel to each other. The
scenery of the valley, which we now entered, was of the
same nature as that of Schoellenen; the Rhone foaming
with amazing rapidity, and falling in a continual cataract at
the foot of irregular and immeasurable alps. We travelled
through this valley above two leagues, perpetually ascending
or descending the rugged sides of rocks; one monent close
to the river, and the next some hundred yards above it. At
first the rocks were either bare, or studded with a few strag∣gling
pines; but as we advanced, they became more clothed
with wood and verdure: still, however, we observed no
traces of any habitation; and we had now measured at least
fifteen miles, from our first quitting the valley of Urseren,
without having seen a single dwelling. I was here so struck
with the beauty of the forests through which we passed, and
the luxuriance of the pasture, that I could not avoid expres∣sing
my astonishment on observing no appearance of any
habitation in these delightful spots. I had scarcely made the
remark, when four or five cottages, situated on the other
side of the Rhone, upon a beautiful declivity, announced our
approach to the Vallais. Not long afterwards, we unexpect∣edly
came to an opening which commanded an extensive
view of that fertile vale, containing several scattered vil∣lages.
In this very spot a peasant of taste, has built his
cottage. Here we quitted the bad road; and descended into
the Vallais.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="290"/>
WE had proposed passing the night at Oberwald, after
the fatigues of the day: but, upon inquiry, we found it
could supply us with no refreshment. The master of a little
hovel, which was called an inn, pointed to a large cheese,
and told us that was all his provision; it was his bread, his
fish, and his meat. Meeting with no better reception at
Obergestlen, we continued on to Munster, where we did not
arrive till late: here we found an excellent inn for this
country, which afforded good bread, and even some meat;
but what was far more comfortable to me, a quiet room and
a clean bed.</P>

<P>THE Vallaisans are remarkably attached to their li∣berty.
Upon our quitting Munster, this morning,
we joined company with a peasant, with whom we had a
long conversation. He demanded our opinion of the coun∣try;
and, pointing to the mountains, exclaimed: “Behold
our walls and bulwarks; Constantinople is not so strong∣ly
fortified.” This upper part of the Vallais, I should
imagine, is not much frequented by travellers, if we may
judge from the curiosity of the people, who all came out to
gaze upon us; and when they discovered that we were Eng∣lishmen,
they observed us with greater attention. But
what particularly surprised us was, that the peasant above∣mentioned
inquired concerning the state of our war with the
Americans. It seemed indeed somewhat extraordinary, that
a common peasant of the Vallais, should know there was
such a place as Constantinople; but it was not less surpris∣ing,
that he should ever have heard of the contest between
Great Britain and her American colonies.</P>
<P>AFTER returning about a league through the same fertile
and well-cultivated country which we traversed yesterday,
we left the plain, and ascended the Grimsel: one of those

alps which separate the Vallais from the canton of Berne.
We employed four hours in climbing a steep and craggy
road to the summit; and should have considered the attempt
as scarcely practicable, had we not been encouraged by the
experience of yesterday. We crossed the several shades of
vegetation: in the valley, and the lower parts of the moun∣tain,
corn and rich meadows; then forests of larch and pine;
next, short grass, together with several species of herbs, that
afford exquisite pasture to the cattle; to these succeeded the
various tribes of mosses and lichens; and then bare rock and
snow. It would be curious to construct, or at least to ima∣gine,
a scale of vegetation, according to the idea of a French
writer; who asserts, that excessive cold and excessive heat
are equally pernicious. The tops of these high mountains
are barren, and produce no plants; and at certain heights
nothing but mosses and lichens will vegetate: the same oc∣curs
in climates where the heat is intolerable; as no other
vegetable productions are observed in the burning sands of
Africa. The lichens and mosses then, which support the
cold better than other plants, would form the first degree of
a scale adjusted to determine, how far vegetation accords
with the temperature of the atmosphere. The same families
of plants, as they bear also the heat much better than any
other, would occupy the last degree in the scale above-men∣tioned.
Thus, according to this fanciful scale, the two ex∣tremes
touch each other surprisingly.</P>
<P>FROM the top of the Grimsel we descended about two
miles, and arrived at a small plain or hollow in the midst of
the mountains; containing one solitary hovel: and from
<PB N="271" REF="293"/>
this hovel I am now writing to you. Notwithstanding the
wretched appearance it made at first sight, we found in this
desert spot all the accommodations we could wish for, ex∣cept
beds; and these are the less necessary, after our sound
sleep last night. Not to mention excellent cheese, butter,
and milk (our ordinary fare) we obtain some good wine, a
small portion of kid, and a boiled <HI>marmot</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of the Marmot in Vol. iii.</NOTE>, which we have
just devoured; although at another time we should have
revolted at the very idea. The landlord is stationed in this
forlorn region by the canton of Berne, and he resides in it
about nine months. He usually arrives here on the first of
March, and retires in the beginning of December. His
business is to receive all travellers; upon condition, however,
that they pay for their accommodations. When he quits the
place, he leaves a certain quantity of cheese, hard bread,
salted provision, and fuel, in case any unfortunate wanderer
should happen to come this way, when the winter has set
in; and we observed long poles fixed on both sides of the
track, at small distances from each other, in order to point
out the path to travellers, who may chance to pass this
mountain after the snow has begun to fall. The road is
seldom open for horses before the first of June. Near the
house, upon the top of a small rock, our host has contrived a
kind of little garden, by bringing some earth from the
neighbouring pastures: and this small piece of ground sup∣plies
him tolerably well with turnips and cabbages; al∣though,
on account of the height of the circumjacent moun∣tains,
it does not long enjoy the warmth of the sun.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="294"/>
NUMEROUS herds of goats are kept, during the summer
months, upon these mountains: they are let out every
morning to feed upon the pastures; and return every even∣ing
before sun-set to be milked and housed. It was a pleas∣ing
sight to observe them marching homeward in the same
herd; and following each other down the broken precipices,
and along the rugged sides of the rocks.</P>
<P>THIS hovel, beside the storehouses for cheeses, contains
only a small kitchen, a bed-chamber appropriated to the fa∣mily,
and a room, in which we are now sitting. We occupy
nearly one side; the other is taken up by our servants, the
landlord and his wife, and half a dozen honest labourers:
the latter are partaking of their homely supper, with all the
relish of well-earned hunger; and are enjoying a short re∣spite
from their toil, with that noisy mirth which character∣ises
this class of people.</P>
<P>THE sources of the Aar are in these mountains. Near
our hovel are three lakes that supply waters to that river,
which rolls down in an impetuous torrent from the neigh∣bouring
glaciers. While dinner was preparing, I walked by
the side of that river searching for crystals; which are very
common in these parts: we found pieces of divers colours,
white, black, yellow, and green. These mountains certainly
abound also in rich veins of gold, and other metals; a consi∣derable
quantity of gold-dust being found in the bed of the
Aar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been suggested to me, that no gold-dust is found in the Aar, until it has re∣ceived the Reichen-bach.</NOTE>, and in the various torrents. I can conceive nothing
<PB N="273" REF="295"/>
more fatal to the interests of Switzerland, nor more repug∣nant
to the liberties of the people, than to have these mines
of gold or silver traced and opened. A sudden overflow of
riches would effectually change and corrupt their manners:
and it is an incontestable truth, that the real power of a
country, not ambitious of making conquests, is derived less
from the wealth than from the industry of its subjects; the
happiness of a people, as well as of an individual, consisting
in being contented. What a chaos of mountains are here
heaped upon one another! a dreary, desolate, but sublime
appearance: it looks like the ruins and wreck of a world.</P>

<DIV2>
<OPENER><DATELINE>On the Grimsel, <DATE>August 29, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will recollect that, in 1776<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the preceding Letter.</NOTE>, I described the passage
of the Furca as extremely difficult, and attended with some
danger. But that was my first essay over the less frequented
alps. How different are our sensations at different intervals!
To-day, on measuring the same ground, though I did not
find the road as <HI>smooth as a bowling-green,</HI> I yet never once
dismounted; but rode with my Letters on Switzerland in my
hand, occasionally making notes and observations: it must,
however, be confessed, that in many parts, where a faint
path along the crags and impending precipices were scarcely
obvious, my situation was not very favourable for accurate
composition.</P>
<P>FROM the top of the Furea, instead of immediately de∣scending
and pursuing the same road which I followed in
1776, we sent our horses forwards, and ascended the Galle∣berg
<PB N="274" REF="296"/>
to the upper part of the glacier of the Furca: from
thence we looked down upon the Vallais and the Rhone
flowing through it, as upon a small field watered by a rill;
above and around, as far as the eye could reach, we observed
numberless pointed alps, and particularly that stupendous
chain called the <HI>Aar-Gletchers,</HI> which comprises, among
many others, the Finster-aar-horn, the Wetter-horn, the
Jung-frau-horn, and the Schreck-horn.</P>
<P>THE upper part of this glacier of the Furca, is far more
beautiful than the lower extremity; the snow is of a more
virgin white; the pyramids of ice more bold; and the blue
tints more lively and animated. Having enjoyed in different
directions this icy scene, we descended near the edge of the
glacier, and refreshed ourselves with some water from two
transparent springs called <HI>Aughstweicht-brunnen,</HI> that burst
from the sides of the rock, at a small distance from each
other. We then went down a very steep descent, till we
joined the track which I pursued in 1776. I recollected,
with a pleasing satisfaction, the torrent, near which we ate
on that occasion our humble repast; and came to the Rhone
about half a mile below the spot where it bursts in two
streams from the bottom of the glacier. In order to have
a nearer view, we crossed the streams, which, though
scarcely three feet in depth, rushed with such violence, as
almost to overturn the guide, who conveyed me across on
his shoulders. Having admired the arch of ice, and paid
our ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isance to the majestic habitation of the River-God,
we walked at the foot of the Satzberg, and noticed several
lively springs issuing from the ground, which the inhabitants
call <HI>cold waters;</HI> and a little further three warm sources, in
<PB N="275" REF="297"/>
which the mercury in Reaumur's thermometer stood at ten
degrees above freezing point, or 55 of Fahrenheit. These
sources, uniting with several cold springs, fall, within a few
paces from their rise, into the great torrent that flows from
the glacier, and are usually considered as the <HI>true</HI> sources
of the Rhone. That honour is appropriated to these little
rills, because, being of an equal temperature in all seasons of
the year, they do not owe their origin, like the <HI>cold waters,</HI>
to the melted snow and ice, and are as abundant in winter as
in summer. It appears, however, extremely inconsistent, to
dignify these little streams with the <HI>exclusive</HI> title of the
sources of the Rhone; for that river undoubtedly owes its
origin and greatness to the perpetual and inexhaustible sup∣plies
from the surrounding glaciers.</P>
<P>WE had now employed above nine hours from the time
of our quitting the valley of Urseren; and should have con∣tinued
much longer amid these majestic scenes, if the de∣clining
sun had not reminded us of approaching night.
Being still at a considerable distance from any habitation, we
continued our route, and began ascending the Grimsel, near
the warm sources of the Rhone. The track, though ex∣tremely
steep, and as perpendicular as a man could well
mount, was not dangerous, because the rocks were thickly
covered with small shrubs, herbage, and mosses. After
an hour and a quarter's t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dious ascent, we reached the sum∣mit
of the Grimsel, and descending a rugged ridge of gra∣nite
rocks, we looked down upon a lake, from which issues
a stream that falls into the Rhone. A little further we
passed several small rills and dark lakes which supply the
Aar; in less than an hour we entered the road which leads
<PB N="276" REF="298"/>
to the Vallais, and came to the place of our destination, the
same hovel on the Grimsel, where I passed the night on my
former expedition. We arrived there about eight in the
evening, after a journey which employed us more than
twelve hours.</P>
<P>No situation can exceed the solitary horror of the scenery
on the top of the Grimsel. Its appearance resembled the in∣side
of a mine, and seemed as if the bowels of the earth had
been violently rent asunder; reminding me of that sublime
description in the Aeneis, when the inside of Cacus's cave is
instantaneously laid open by the arm of Hercules.</P>
<Q><L>At specus, et Caci detecta apparuit ingens</L>

<P>ON entering the hovel I immediately recognized the same
landlord, who was stationed here in 1776, to whom, at that
<PB N="277" REF="299"/>
time, I never expected to have owed a second reception in so
forlorn a spot. While supper was preparing, a peasant and
our guide, forgetful of his great fatigue, suddenly started up
at the sound of their favourite air, the <HI>Renz des vaches,</HI> play∣ed
upon a rebec by a shepherd, and danced several <HI>alle∣mandes,</HI>
perfectly in time, and not without grace; a pictu∣resque
group of spectators looking on and applauding.</P>
<P><DATE>August 30.</DATE></P>
<P>THIS morning we made a short excursion to the source of
the Aar, which takes its rise in the neighbouring glaciers.
In less than half an hour we entered a small plain, skirted by
high mountains, and entirely closed by a rugged chain of
alps, over which tower the Finster-Aar and Lauter-Aar∣horns,
and at whose feet stretches a glacier so entirely covered
with earth and stones, as to bear, at a small distance, the ap∣pearance
of a sand-hill. From this glacier issues a “<HI>torrent
roaring loud</HI>” of troubled waters, which is the source of
the Lower Aar, and joins, in a few hundred paces, another
stream called the Upper Aar, that falls from the Zinkeberg:
the union of these two torrents forms the Aar, which rushes
over a stony bed with great impetuosity. At present it runs
in a narrow channel; but at the first melting of the snow in
spring, it overflows the whole space between the mountains,
and becomes a temporary lake.</P>
<P>OUR guide is a <HI>chasseur,</HI> who frequently ranges over this
vast chain of alps, in pursuit of the chamois, an animal re∣markable
for its activity in scouring along the craggy rocks,
and in leaping over the precipices. He informed me, that
<PB N="278" REF="300"/>
this glacier is the extremity of a valley of ice about twelve
miles in length, and from one to four in breadth: it then
divides into two branches; one extends towards the Schreck∣horn,
and the other towards the Vallais. He expatiated with
great enthusiasm on the profession of a chasseur, though ex∣tremely
laborious, and at times dangerous. He usually kills
from six to fifteen chamois in a year: with the flesh, which
is very delicate, he helps to support his family, and disposes
of each skin for a guinea. He uses a rifle-barrelled gun, and
generally shoots them at the distance of three or four hun∣dred
yards.</P>
<P>THE chamois are very timorous, and consequently watch∣ful
animals. They usually go out in herds of twenty or
thirty; and while they are feeding, one of them posted on
an adjacent height stands <HI>centinel,</HI> and is relieved at short
intervals by another. The <HI>centinel</HI> looks around with
great solicitude and attention; and on the least suspicion of
danger, alarms the herd by a shrill cry; instantly the whole
troop decamp, one following the other. The chamois feed
on various kinds of herbage, and particularly on the <HI>Lichen
Rangiserinus,</HI> or rein-deer lichen, which is found in such
great quantities, as in many parts to cover the summits and
sides of the mountains. In order to procure their favourite
food in winter, they, like the rein-deer, clear away the
snow with their fore-feet, frequently thawing it with their
breath, for the purpose of loosening it more easily. But
when, either from the depth or hardness of the snow, they
cannot penetrate to the lichens, they browse on the saplings
of pine and sir. In summer their bodies are of a yellowish
<PB N="279" REF="301"/>
brown, and whitish under the throat; the hair is short and
smooth: in winter their coat lengthens and grows dark, so
as to resemble that of a bear, and entirely to disfigure them.
Sometimes, but very rarely, they have been found speckled,
or of variegated colours; and lately, a chamois, entirely
white, was shot upon the Engelberg. It was in all other re∣spects
similar to a common chamois; and it is uncertain,
whether it owed its colour to age or accident.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS has classed the chamois in the goat genus,
under the name of <HI>rupicapra,</HI> or mountain-goat; his ac∣quaintance
with the antelopes having been too slender to en∣able
him to form a genus of antelopes, which Pallas first
constructed, and where he has judiciously placed this animal.
The example of Pallas has been followed by Pennant and
succeeding zoologists.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VALLEY OF THE AAR—LAND OF HASLI—
MEYRINGEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>August, 1786.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I FOUND the cold upon the Grimsel more piercing than
upon the St. Gothard; and last night it even deprived
me of my sleep. But then circumstances were very diffe∣rent
in the two lodgings: for on the St. Gothard I had a
comfortable bed; whereas, last night, I lay in the hay-loft,
without any covering: I declare, my blood has scarcely re∣covered
its circulation. Take notice this is the twelfth of
August.</P>
<P>HAVING quitted our wretched abode on the Grimsel, we
passed along the valley of the Aar, through an uninterrupted
chain of wild, rugged, and uninhabitable alps. The road
along this valley, though much narrower than that from
Altdorf to the St. Gothard, is formed in the same manner
along the steep acclivities and declivities, sometimes laid
on arches, and sometimes carried over bridges thrown
across the tremendous precipices. It is paved with flat
pieces of granite, so smooth and slippery, that the horses
would have perpetually stumbled, if they had not been
rough-shod. In some parts this road ran along the bare
and rugged ridges; in others, down steps, either cut in the
rock, or formed by large stones, so that for several paces
it resembled a stair-case. The whole surface of the valley
<PB N="281" REF="303"/>
was thickly strewed with vast fragments of rock; while
those, which still hung on the sides of the mountains, seemed
threatening to overwhelm us; the river, during the whole
way, thundering along in a continual fall. This valley exhi∣bits
the same kind of scenes to which we have been long ac∣customed;
except that the Aar rushes with more impetuous
rage even than the Rhone or the Reuss, and is frequently so
swelled with the torrents it receives in its course, as to ravage
all the adjacent country: we saw many marks of these terri∣ble
devastations. We crossed it in several places, over stone
bridges of a single arch, one of which equalled, in the length
of its span and dreariness of the landscape, the Devil's Bridge
in the valley of Schoellenen. About three leagues from
Spital, we had a glimpse, through the trees, of the Aar falling
from a considerable height. In order to gain a nearer view,
we climbed along the sides of a steep rock, well covered with
moss: I leaned against a tree that impended over the preci∣pice,
and saw the river rushing from the rock, and spreading
into a semicircular expansion in its descent. It fell with fury
into a deep and narrow gulf, and then lost itself in the midst
of the forest. The body of water was very considerable,
and its perpendicular fall, as far as I could judge by the eye,
at least one hundred and fifty feet. The scenery also was
solemnly majestic; the grey rocks on each side rising per∣pendicularly,
and totally bare, except their tops, which were
fringed with pines. This picturesque scene appeared to re∣alize
a favourite image of classic antiquity: as I viewed the
Aar pouring its flood of waters from a crevice of the rock, I
sigured to myself the Nile or the Tiber bursting at once from
the urn of a River-God.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="304"/>
IN our way to Meyringen, we traversed large forests of
beech and pines, the Aar roaring along the valley, and the
road, which was as craggy and rugged as usual, incessantly
ascending and descending. We now passed through several
small villages, which afforded a pleasing sight, after the de∣solate
country we had so lately quitted; and entered a beau∣tiful
little valley of a most lively verdure, and delightfully
planted. All was calmness and repose: neither rapid river
nor roaring torrent to interrupt the unusual stillness and
tranquillity of the scene. This short interval of silence, ren∣dered
us more sensibly affected with the turbulence of the
Aar and the loud clamour of the cataracts.</P>
<P>FROM this silent and sequestered spot, we descended to
a larger valley on the banks of the Aar. Perhaps no other
part of Switzerland would yield more delight and occupation
to the landscape-painter than this picturesque valley, from
the agreeable and ever-changing colour of the rocks which
bound it, their summits finely broken into irregular and
fantastic forms, and from the variety and size of the frag∣ments
dispersed near the banks of the river. Each frag∣ment,
each cottage, each shed, each shrub, is a picture;
and the effect is considerably heightened by the transparency
of the air, and the grandeur of the back-ground.</P>
<P>WE have now visited the sources of three great rivers in
Switzerland, and traced their impetuous progress through a
tract of country, in which nature has exhibited the grandest
and most august of her works. But how impossible have I
found it to lay before you adequate descriptions of these ma∣jestic,
<PB N="283" REF="305"/>
variegated, and astonishing scenes! They must all of
them upon description necessarily appear much the same: yet,
in fact, every river and cataract, every rock, mountain, and
precipice, are respectively distinguished by an infinite diver∣sity
of modifications, and by all the possible forms of beauty,
or magnificence; of sublimity, or horror. But these discri∣minating
variations, though too visibly marked to escape
even the least observing eye, elude representation, and defy
the strongest powers both of the pen and pencil. In a word,
you must not judge of this romantic country, from the faint
sketches I have attempted to delineate: for they can no
more convey an idea of these wonderful scenes, than if I
were to aim at giving some notion of the pictures of Claude
or Salvator by informing you, that they are composed of
paint and canvass.</P>
<P>MEYRINGEN, a large and neat village, is the capital burgh
of Hasliland, a district in the canton of Berne, which enjoys
considerable privileges. The people are governed by their
own magistrates, and only take oaths of fidelity to the Sove∣reign
Council of Berne. All the authority, which the bailifs
in the other parts of this canton enjoy, is possessed in a great
measure by the Landamman; who resides at Meyringen.
He is always a native of Hasliland, and is appointed by the
Sovereign Council of Berne, at the recommendation of the
bailif of Interlaken. Most of the other magistrates are elect∣ed
by the people, who assemble as occasion requires, and are
convoked by the Landamman.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants are a sine race of people: the men in
general remarkably strong and well made; the women tall
<PB N="284" REF="306"/>
and handsome. The women have an elegant manner of wear∣ing
their hair, which is commonly of a beautiful brown: it
is parted from the top of the forehead, from thence brought
round and joined to the locks behind, which either hang
down their back in long tresses, are braided with ribband, or
woven round the head in a simple plait. But the other
part of the dress does not in the least correspond with this
elegance; as their shapes, naturally fine, are spoiled by an
absurd fashion of wearing their petticoats so high, that they
all appear as if they were far advanced in pregnancy.</P>
<P>MEYRINGEN is situated near the Aar, in a very romantic
vale; surrounded by meadows of a most luxuriant verdure,
and sprinkled with cottages, which are occasionally separated
from each other by huge intervening stones and deep chan∣nels,
the remaining effects of storms and inundations.
Close to the village, the Alp-bach, a torrent so called, falls
from mount Housli, in two perpendicular cascades, but
with so much violence, and in so large a body of water, as
to cause frequent inundations: indeed the burgh itself has
been in danger of being overwhelmed and destroyed by
its repeated ravages; against which, however, it is now pro∣tected,
by a wall of considerable height and solidity. Near
this torrent another fall of water, called the Dorf-bach,
glides gently down the bare rock; and further on, the
Mille-bach glistened as it descended through a hanging grove
of pines, that feather the sides of the mountain.</P>
<P>As I stood on a platform of rock, about fifty feet above
the bottom of the Alp-bach, I looked over the delightful vale
of Hasli, observed Mount Sheidec rising from the banks of
<PB N="285" REF="307"/>
the Aar, and bending itself in one part, as if on purpose to
discover three tremendous peaks, rising in regular gradation
one above the other; the one a naked conical rock; the
second tapering and sprinkled with snow; and the third,
which is the highest point of the Wetterhorn, of a pyra∣midal
form, mantled with glistening ice.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>By this statement you will perceive, that, in proportion,
bread is much dearer than the other articles; and the reason
is obvious: for these mountainous parts consist almost en∣tirely
of pasturages, and produce little corn. The peasants,
inhabiting the mountainous districts of Switzerland, live
chiefly upon milk and potatoes, which are here much cul∣tivated.
According to the price of provisions in England,
those articles will appear exceedingly reasonable: but then it
<PB N="286" REF="308"/>
ought at the same time to be considered, that money is
very scarce in these parts. Nor indeed is it so much neces∣sary
in a country, where there is no luxury; where all the
peasantry are tolerably well provided with every necessary
of life from their own little domains. I had, to-day, a long
conversation with one of the lads who accompanied us from
Altdorf, and who takes care of our horses. He lives upon
the mountains of Uri; and, as the winter lasts near eight
months, during some part of which time there can be little
communication between the several cottages, every family
lays in sufficient provision for the whole winter. His own
family consists of seven persons, and is provided with the
following stores: seven cheeses, each weighing twenty-five
pounds; a hundred and eight pounds of hard bread, twenty-five
baskets of potatoes, each weighing about forty-pounds;
seven goats, and three cows, one of which is killed. The
cows and horses are fed with hay, and the goats with the
boughs of firs; which, in a scarcity of fodder, are given also
to the other cattle. During that dreary season, the family
are employed in making linen and cloth: and, for this pur∣pose,
a small part of the ground belonging to each cottage,
is generally sown with flax. That plant has lately been
much cultivated, and with increasing success, in the moun∣tainous
districts of Switzerland.</P>
<P>THE houses, like those of Appenzel and Glarus, are ge∣nerally
of wood; and it was a natural observation of one
of our servants, in passing through a continued chain of
rocks, that, as there was no deficiency of stone, it seemed
extraordinary, wood alone should be employed for the pur∣poses
<PB N="287" REF="309"/>
of building. But it may be remarked, that these
wooden houses are sooner constructed and easily repaired;
and being formed in a compact manner, with small rooms,
and low ceilings, are sufficiently warm even for so cold a
climate. The chief objection to them arises from the danger
of fire; which, however, is in some measure obviated by
the method of building their cottages detached from each
other. But this observation does not hold with respect to
some of their largest burghs: which must consequently be
exposed to the ravages of this dreadful calamity.</P>

<P>WE left Meyringen this morning, crossed the Aar,
and mounted the Sheidic through a beautiful forest
of beech, poplars, mountain-ash, and pines. About two
miles from Meyringen we dismounted at a small village, and
passed along some fields in order to view the fall of the
Reichenbach, which is deservedly celebrated for its variety
and beauty.</P>
<P>THE Reichenbach has its source at the foot of the Wetter∣horn;
and rolls in numerous cataracts down the steep sides
of Mount Sheidec, until it unites with the Aar near Mey∣ringen.
The fall of the Reichenbach may be divided into
three principal parts.</P>
<P>THE first, which alone is usually visited by travellers,
precipitates itself from an overhanging rock, is reduced into
spray and foam, and in that state falls in a perpendicular co∣lumn,
at least from an elevation of two hundred feet, into
a natural bason, from which it overflows, and is soon lost in
<PB N="289" REF="311"/>
the abyss beneath. The rock itself is concave, arched,
totally bare, excepting its summit, which is feathered with
shrubs; and being of black marble, forms a striking con∣trast
with the pure whiteness of the descending foam. Part
of the spray rebounds on the rock, and glides gently into
the bason in many a silvery current.</P>
<P>THE second cataract begins from the overflowing of the
bason; and is most advantageously seen from a large tree
which impends on the sides of the precipice. In this part
the torrent forms a second perpendicular column of water,
which is half obscured, as it dashes through a chasm of pro∣jecting
rocks.</P>
<P>THE best point of view for seeing the third cataract is in
a meadow at the bottom of the second. From that situation
the whole of Reichenbach seems one immense water-fall:
the bottom of the first, and the top of the second cataract,
being concealed by the intervening hills. From thence it
rolls nearly in a horizontal direction; is divided into two
streams by a rocky island beautifully sprinkled with trees,
and impetuously descends in two unequal bodies. It then
dashes over broken crags of black marble, through groves of
beech, mountain-ash, and pines, and rich grounds inter∣spersed
with hamlets.</P>
<P>ON viewing the various parts of this stupendous fall, I
was as much interested and affected, as Aristaeus is repre∣sented
by Virgil, when his mother Cyrene points out of him
<PB N="290" REF="312"/>
the sources of the principal rivers bursting at once from
the earth.</P>

<P>WE next ascended by the side of the Reichenbach, crossed
that torrent over a bridge; and, having traversed several
plains, or rather undulating vallies, beautifully sprinkled
with ash, poplar, and other large trees, we continued our
<PB N="291" REF="313"/>
route at the foot of some enormous mountains, which are
called by the general name of Wetterhorn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The several peaks of this mountain go under different appellations; and are not ascertained without much difficulty, the peasants usually mistaking and confounding them. One is called the Wetter-horn, an∣other the Nager-horn, a third the Engel-horn, and the highest point takes the deno∣mination of Jungfrau-horn, or Virgin's-horn, for the same reason as the mountain of that name in the valley of Lauterbruen∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, because its summit is inaccessible. Hence several travellers have mistaken this peak for the real Jungfrau-horn.</P>
<P>I have mentioned th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se circumstances, in order to prevent the confusion of names puzzling future travellers as they once puz∣zled me.</P>
<P>The word <HI>horn</HI> in German, which bears the same signification as in the English tongue, is applied to the highest peaks, as in French <HI>aiguille,</HI> or needle.</P></NOTE>, or <HI>Stormy Peak.</HI>
This enormous group, which forms the Wetterhorn, is pe∣culiarly
striking, as well from the naked majesty and gran∣deur
of its rugged peaks, as from its being more insulated
than the neighbouring mountains, and because, in passing
from Meyringen to Grindelwald, it presents itself the first of
this stupendous chain<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To those who go from Grindelwald to Meyringen, the Wetterhorn is the last of this chain. Hence the traveller will not, perhaps, be so much affected with its ma∣jesty and grandeur, as if he first observed it in ascending from Meyringen. I mention this circumstance, because all descriptions are <HI>comparative.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER having ascended about three hours from the time
of our quitting Meyringen, we refreshed ourselves and our
horses in a delightful vale strewed with hamlets; a sloping
hill, adorned with variegated verdure and wood, on one side;
on the other, the Rosenlavi and Schwartz-wald glaciers
stretching between impending rocks; and before us the
highest point of the Wetterhorn lifting its pyramidical
top capped with eternal snow. As we were taking our re∣past,
we were suddenly startled by a noise, like the sound of
thunder; occasioned by a large body of snow falling from
the top of the mountain, which, in its precipitate descent,
<PB N="292" REF="314"/>
had the appearance of a torrent of water reduced almost into
spray. These <HI>avalanches</HI> (as they are called) are sometimes
attended with the most fatal consequences: for, when they
consist of enormous masses, they destroy every thing in their
course; and not unfrequently overwhelm even a whole vil∣lage.
The best security against their effects being the fo∣rests,
with which the alps abound; there is scarcely a village,
if situated at the foot of a mountain, that is not sheltered by
trees; which the inhabitants preserve with uncommon reve∣rence,
as their common protector. Thus, what constitutes
one of the principal beauties in the country, affords also safe∣ty
to the people.</P>
<P>WE continued our course at the foot of the Wetterhorn,
which in this part is so extremely perpendicular and tapering
as to appear like half of an immense pyramid. Here we
conceived it impossible, that any scenes could be more rude
and majestic than those before us; but on reaching the top
of the Sheidec, we burst upon a view which so far exceeded
them in wildness and horror, that we unanimously exclaim∣ed,
“There is the <HI>Schreckhorn,</HI> or the <HI>Peak of Terror.</HI>” The
descent from hence to Grindelwald is gentle but tedious:
that village, consisting of numerous cottages, dispersed
over the plain and upon the rising hills, exhibits an agree∣able
and picturesque scene, heightened at the same time by
a view of the vallies of ice, which stretch along the steep
sides of the mountains in a regular curve, and are beautiful∣ly
skirted with wood.</P>
<P>THE two vallies of ice, which extend into the plain of
Grindelwald, are called the Superior and Inferior Glaciers.
<PB N="293" REF="315"/>
The former lies between the Wetterhorn and the Metten∣berg;
the latter between the Mettenberg and Eger-horn.
The Mettenberg is the base of the Schreckhorn; and the
Eger-horn, or <HI>Pointed peak,</HI> borders on the valley of Grindel∣wald,
and slopes gradually from barren rock and snow to
fertility and cultivation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a further account of this chain of alps, which are contiguous to the vallies of Grindelwald and Lauterbruennen, see Letter on the Chain of Alps observed from Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>DARE I confess to you, that I am somewhat disappointed,
and that a nearer view of the glacier has not sufficiently com∣pensated
for the fatigue and trouble of the expedition? But I
have promised to write from my own feelings, and not to
send an account taken from exaggerated descriptions.—We
sallied forth this morning full of impatience; and arrived at
the bottom of the Inferior glacier, forming a majestic arch of
ice; from whence issued a loud torrent of snow-water just
melted. This glacier is composed of numerous pyramids,
which are more elevated towards the plain; being from
about forty to fifty feet high, and gradually shortening, un∣til
they terminate in a broad surface broken into deep and
wide chasms. We mounted a very difficult path at the edge
of the frozen region, occasionally passing over the steep and
craggy parts of rock almost perpendicular, along the very
sides of the precipice: the danger of which makes me shud∣der
even now. This glacier is several miles in length, and is
supposed, by many travellers, to join the glacier of the Aar,
which I visited in my expedition to the top of the Grimsel.
<PB N="294" REF="316"/>
But the reverend Mr. Wyttenbach of Berne, who has fre∣quently
examined its direction from the adjacent heights,
assured me, that those two glaciers are separated from each
other by a chain of abrupt and perpendicular mountains.</P>
<P>AFTER having employed above two hours in ascending,
we were prevented from continuing our progress by rugged
rocks, and a rising hill of ice; our guide assuring us at the
same time, that it was impossible to proceed any farther. Of
this we were by no means convinced; but not having any
conductor who could lead the way, and not daring to explore
these unknown regions by ourselves, we descended with
heavy hearts; much disappointed, that what we had seen,
though certainly a very curious and sublime sight, did not
equal our expectations: and it added to our chagrin, on
being afterwards informed, that though we could scarcely
have proceeded further in the direction which we took, yet,
that if we had followed another path, we might have pene∣trated
to the Superior glacier, and have reached the base of
the Schreckhorn. In that part between the mountains, now
occupied by the Inferior glacier, there was formerly a road
which communicated with the Vallais, but is at present im∣passable;
and a spot was pointed out to us, now covered with
ice, where once stood a small chapel.</P>
<P>WHAT peculiarly distinguishes the glacier of Grindel∣wald
from that of the Furca, is, that the latter lies amid bar∣ren
and craggy rocks, in a most desolate, dreary, and uninha∣bited
country; whereas this valley of ice joins to a very fer∣tile
plain, and borders upon cultivation: in other respects the
<PB N="295" REF="317"/>
Furca was a much more striking object. Not far from this
glacier of Grindelwald, pines, willows, ash, and oaks, grow
and come to perfection: and near the borders of the ice I
gathered strawberries and wild cherries, and observed hazel∣nuts,
barberries, and mulberry-trees. The valley of Grin∣delwald
is extremely fertile; it produces barley, rye, hay,
hemp, and fruit-trees in great abundance, and feeds above
two thousand large cattle.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VALLEY AND GLACIERS OF LAUTERBRUENNEN—
FALL OF THE STAUBBACH.</HEAD>
<P>THE road from Grindelwalden to this place is good,
and we met a cart, which to us is become a remark∣able
object, not having seen any thing that moves upon
wheels since we quitted Lucerne. The country is pleasingly
diversified with hanging woods, immense rocks, deep preci∣pices,
and violent torrents. But I suppose you are by this
time as much accustomed to rocks, precipices, and torrents,
as the readers of Fingal to blue mists and hollow winds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A nearer and more interesting, but more difficult passage, conducts over the Scheidee from Grindelwald to Lauterbru∣ennen. In my second expedition into these parts I proposed traversing this passage, and had actually set off for that purpose; but a violent shower obliging me to change my resolution, I continued my journey along the same road as on the former occasion.</P>
<P>It may be proper to apprize the traveller, that there are two Sheidees, the one separat∣ing the vallies of Grindelwald and Meyrin∣gen, the other those of Grindelwald and Lau∣terbruennen.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE valley of Lauterbruennen is embosomed in the
midst of the alps. The western boundary of the valley,
from which the Staubbach falls, would in any other country
be called an enormous mountain: it here appears only a
trifling hill in comparison with the opposite chain, of which
the highest point is the beautiful Jungfrau-horn, that
stretches in a semicircular direction, and overlooking the
adjacent peaks, rises to a stupendous height.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="319"/>
WE are now lodged at the house of the clergyman of
Lauterbruennen; a little village, or rather collection of cot∣tages,
sprinkled, like those of Grindelwald, about the valley
and accessible parts of the hills. Near the house, is the cele∣brated
fall of the Staubbach, which I am just returned from
viewing. This torrent rolls perpendicularly from so consi∣derable
a height, as to resolve itself into fine spray; the
greatest part of it falls clear of the overhanging mountain,
during its whole descent; but the remainder dashes about
half way against a projection from the rock, and flies off
with great violence. The clergyman measured, a short time
ago, its perpendicular height, and found it nine hundred and
thirty feet. The sun shining in an opposite direction, a
miniature rainbow was reflected towards the bottom of the
fall: while I stood at some distance, the rainbow assumed a
semicircular figure; as I approached, the extreme points
gradually coincided, and formed a complete circle of the
most lively and brilliant colours. In order to have a still
finer view, I ventured nearer and nearer; the circle at
the same time becoming smaller and smaller; and as I
stood quite under the fall, it suddenly disappeared. When
I looked up to the torrent, in this situation, it resembled
a cloud of dust: and from this circumstance indeed it takes
its name; Staubbach signifying, in the German language,
a spring of <HI>dust.</HI> I paid for my curiosity, by being extreme∣ly
wet; but then I had the satisfaction, at the same time,
of seeing a rainbow in miniature: no uncommon phaeno∣menon,
as it may be observed in any cascade, upon which
the sun shines directly in a certain position. In the present
<PB N="298" REF="320"/>
instance, however, it was some consolation to me, that the
object happened to be peculiarly striking.</P>
<P>THE next morning we rode to the extremity of the vale,
in which there are some noble points of view, and ascended
to the glaciers, which stretch from the feet of the Breit-horn
and Gross-horn. In this delightful valley many streams<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From which circumstance it receives its name, <HI>Lauterbruennen,</HI> in German, signify∣ing <HI>many springs.</HI></NOTE> of
the clearest water gush from the earth like small rivers, and
numberless torrents precipitate themselves from the moun∣tains.
I noticed two in particular which fall from a greater
height than even the Staubbach, but as their descent is not
so direct, they are less extraordinary.</P>
<P>AFTER mounting above three hours, we reached a small
hut, which in summer is inhabited by herdsmen, who make
excellent cheeses, and tend numerous herds of cows, goats,
and swine. Here we feasted upon cold chamois, which our
host had provided for us, and concluded our repast with a
desert of delicious cream. From thence we ascended still fur∣ther,
with considerable difficulty arrived at the borders of
the glaciers, and were entirely surrounded by rugged and
almost impassable rocks. We wished to proceed; but our
host assuring us, that we had but just time to return before
night, we sat down close to the ice, and contemplated, with
rapture and astonishment, part of the great central chain of
the alps; rocks towering above rocks, and mountains rising
above mountains, not more distinguished for their stupen∣dous
<PB N="299" REF="321"/>
heights, than for the immense variety and rudeness of
their forms. One of the peaks, which is called the Gross-horn,
is of a pyramidal shape, and capped with frozen
snow; another, the Breit-horn, is conical, and seems crown∣ed
with an enormous mass of transparent ice, from which
the reflection of the sun-beams were inexpressibly beau∣tiful.
But the most elevated and most majestic of the
whole group, is the Jungfrau-horn, or Virgin's-horn,
which takes its name of <HI>virgin,</HI> because its summit is in∣accessible.</P>
<P>THE hollows between the mountains are filled with large
vallies of ice, broken into a great variety of shapes; and seve∣ral
torrents bursting from the snow, and uniting in their
course form the Weiss-Lutchine, a river which rolls rapidly
through the valley of Lauterbruennen, joins the Schwartz-Lutchine,
which flows from Grindelwald, and falls into the
Aar. Many of the mountains are covered to a great height
with verdure, on which the eye reposes with delight amid
the horrors of such wintry scenes. We observed also, at
considerable elevations, several small villages, the access to
which must be almost as difficult as to the glaciers to which
we ascended.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING, however, the magnificence and
variety of this curious scenery, and the uncommon phaeno∣menon
of ice and snow in the midst of summer, bordering on
forests and cultivation; yet I must again repeat, that the
ideas which we had previously conceived, from exaggerated
<PB N="300" REF="322"/>
accounts, concerning the boundless extent and magnificent
appearance of the glaciers, were not sufficiently answered.
It is remarkable, that every object in Switzerland has more
than gratified our expectations, except the glaciers; which
must, nevertheless, be considered as forming one of the most
interesting phaenomena in the whole country. This disap∣pointment
seems to have been occasioned by the turgid
accounts which we had heard and read of the glaciers of
Grindelwald and Lauterbruennen; and we were led to
suppose, that the glacier of the Furca was much inferior
in magnitude to those of Grindelwald and Lauterbruen∣nen;
when, in fact, it was in all respects equal, if not
superior, to them.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="postscript">

<P>IN 1785, I was considerably more delighted and astonish∣ed
with the vallies of Grindelwald and Lauterbruennen than
in 1776; because my imagination was not, in this as in the
first instance, exalted by exaggerated descriptions, and led to
expect more than could be reached, even by nature herself,
however prodigal in these her sublimest works. But the vallies
of ice still appear to me inconsiderable objects, when viewed
at some distance, and compared with the surrounding moun∣tains,
whose summits and sides are clothed with vast regions
of ice and snow. On a nearer approach they become more
interesting, particularly when they are broken into abrupt
<PB N="301" REF="323"/>
ridges, and immense chasms; and when their aggregate
mass, and numerous branches, are observed from the sur∣rounding
heights. Still, however, the traveller may be dis∣appointed,
whose imagination has been previously filled
with turgid descriptions; or who apply to the vallies of ice
that sublimity and magnificence, which are only due to the
alps above and around them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LAKES OF THUN AND BRIENTZ—PASSAGE OF
MOUNT GEMMI—BATHS OF LEUK.</HEAD>
<P>THE nearest route from Lauterbruennen to the Baths
of Leuk, leads across the mountains to Kandersteig.
It is called <HI>le chemin vert,</HI> or the <HI>green way,</HI> because the rocks
are, for the most part, covered with herbage. It is only
practicable to foot-passengers; and I was informed by a
Swiss gentleman who passed it, though steep and diffic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt,
that it is not dangerous. Its distance may be about three
leagues, and, to a person not wholly unaccustomed to alpine
passages, would require about five or six hours. A <HI>chasseur</HI>
would perform it in less than half the time. In my second
expedition, in 1785, I had proposed crossing this way; but
was obliged to decline it, as I could not procure a guide who
was acquainted with the road.</P>
<P>I PURSUED, therefore, the usual route, which runs from
the entrance of the valley of Lauterbruennen, through a
fertile plain, between the lakes of Thun and Brientz. About
two leagues from Lauterbruennen, I came to the Aar, near
the spot where it issues from the lake of Brientz, and follow∣ed
its course until it entered the lake of Thun, so called from
a town of that name, situated upon its north-western extre∣mity.
This lake is about four leagues long and one broad;
and, if we may judge from the steepness of the mountains
<PB REF="325"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="303" REF="326"/>
with which it is bounded, must be very deep: the borders
are richly variegated; and present several fine points of
view, greatly heightened by many rugged rocks rising boldly
from the edge of the water. We coasted this lake, through
a delightful country, to the small village of Leisingen; then
ascended to Aeschi, from whence we looked down upon the
lakes of Thun and Brientz. In all the maps of Switzerland,
which have fallen under my observation, these two lakes are
represented as if they extended almost in a strait line; where∣as
they are situated nearly at right angles to each other. You
may judge of their true position, by the annexed engraving,
communicated to me by the Reverend Mr. Wyttenbach of
Berne.</P>
<P>HAVING descended from Aeschi, we soon entered the rich
valley of Frutigen, parallel to that of Lauterbruennen, and
enjoyed, for a considerable way, a prospect of those glaciers
we had visited the day before. This valley ends at the small
town of Frutigen: from thence commences that of Kander,
watered by a river of the same name, and bounded by mount
Kander. In all these vallies, the rudeness and height of the
mountains, which almost enclose them, contrasted with the
beauty and fruitfulness of the plains, always fertilized by
some lively torrent, form a thousand picturesque scenes, ever
changing, and impossible to be described: and they are still
further embellished by the number of ruined castles perched
upon points seemingly inaccessible.</P>
<P>THE road continued good as far as the village of Kander∣steg;
from whence delicate travellers, who do not chuse to
<PB N="304" REF="327"/>
mount a rugged ascent, either on foot or on horseback, are
carried in an arm-chair supported by means of poles upon
men's shoulders. We proceeded, however, on horseback,
having before rode up steeper and more difficult paths. Af∣ter
having ascended about an hour and a half, we arrived at
the summit of the Kander, where a wooden cross marks the
entrance into the Vallais; then traversed a waving plain of
pasture, in which we observed a few huts and several herds
of cattle; and at length reached a single house on the Gem∣mi,
where we procured some refreshment: here we saw
nothing but immense rocks piled upon one another, with no
appearance of vegetation; and the weather was exceedingly
cold. We then passed over a large drift of snow, and came
to a lake called the Dauben See, about a league in circumfe∣rence,
supplied by a considerable torrent from a neighbour∣ing
glacier. This lake has no visible outlet; but doubtless
finds a subterraneous passage into the <HI>Vallais.</HI></P>
<P>THE chain of mountains, which here separates the canton
of Berne from the Vallais, is called the Gemmi: from the
point of which, overlooking and almost over-hanging the
Vallais, we had at once a most extensive prospect over
that fertile country, and the rugged alps of Savoy. The
mountain which we descended, is in many places almost per∣pendicular;
and yet a horse-road has been formed in the
hard rock down this very formidable descent. It was begun
in 1736, and finished in 1741, at the joint expence of the Val∣lais,
and the canton of Berne: an astonishing work! which
proves that nothing is impracticable to human industry.
More than a league has been blown up with gunpowder, and
<PB N="305" REF="328"/>
a way formed which seems dangerous to those, who are un∣used
to mountainous countries, or whose heads are apt to turn
giddy. It is about nine feet broad, and hangs over the preci∣pice:
in some parts, for a considerable space, it is a hollow
way, open only at one side, the rock above projecting over it,
of the same breadth, and in the same direction. The effect
is peculiarly singular: for, as the road winds continually, the
scene also continually changes; so that one moment we com∣manded
an extensive view, and the next were enclosed with
barren rock.</P>
<P>THE descent from the top to the plain, is about two
leagues: when you are arrived at the bottom, and look up,
you cannot observe the smallest traces of a road; so that a
stranger would hardly believe it possible, that a passage has
been formed down the rock, until convinced by his own ex∣perience.
About thirty years ago, the troops of Berne de∣scended
this road for the purpose of assisting the canton of Uri
against the inhabitants of the valley of Levino, who had re∣volted;
and, what is almost incredible, they descended with
heavy artillery.</P>
<P>THIS place is famous for its hot medicinal springs; and is
much frequented by invalids of various kinds, during this
season of the year: the patients either bathe or drink the
waters. As far as I can judge from the accounts which I
have received concerning their warmth, their analysis, the
method of using them, and their efficacy in curing the gout,
rheumatism, obstructions, and cutaneous disorders; they
seem nearly to resemble those of Bath. There are several
<PB N="306" REF="329"/>
springs, of different warmth and of different qualities: ac∣cording
to the most accurate experiments made by the Rev.
Mr. Wyttenbach, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermome∣ter,
when plunged into the principal source, stood at 115;
and at 120 in the spring which flows near the bridge over
the Dala.</P>
<P>THE accommodations for the company are very incon∣venient:
each person having for his own use a small apart∣ment
not more than a few feet square; in which there
is just room for a bed, a table, and two chairs. The
public dining-room is upon rather a larger scale, as is also
an apartment where the company occasionally assem∣ble.
Formerly the accommodations were tolerably good;
but unfortunately, in 1719, an <HI>avalanche</HI> fell with such
impetuosity from a neighbouring glacier, upon the vil∣lage,
as to overwhelm the greatest part of the houses and
the baths, and to destroy a considerable number of the in∣habitants.</P>
<P>THE company, consisting of persons from different quar∣ters
of Switzerland, are exceedingly affable and obliging:
insomuch that several of them have invited us to their re∣spective
houses; and this invitation was made with that
openness and unaffected frankness so peculiarly characteristic
of the Swiss. We dined this morning at eleven; the bell for
supper is now ringing, and it is scarce seven. These are
primitive hours: but we have travelling appetites; and,
provided we meet with refreshment, the hour and place are
of little consequence.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="330"/>
YOU are now probably drinking tea in your with∣drawing
room at Bath, from whence you are enjoying that
beautiful prospect I have so often admired. The situation of
this spot is more romantic, and the waters perhaps not less
efficacious: yet this village contains only a few miserable
houses, while Bath is one of the finest towns in Europe. I
had a conversation to-day upon this topic, with a very in∣genious
and well-informed gentleman of the Vallais. I ob∣served
to him, that, considering the great credit and efficacy
of these waters, I could not forbear wondering, that the
chiefs of the republic had not considered the improvement
of the accommodations, an object worthy of their attention;
for, if they were rendered more convenient for the reception
of invalids, it would undoubtedly be the means of drawing a
great number of strangers; and consequently must be highly
beneficial to the country. He assured me, it had more than
once been in contemplation; but that some persons of great
credit and authority opposed all improvements, upon a
principle similar to the policy of Lycurgus; conceiving that
a concourse of strangers would only serve to introduce luxury
among the inhabitants, and insensibly destroy that simplicity
of manners, for which the <HI>Vallaisans</HI> are so remarkably dis∣tinguished.</P>
<P>How far the ignorance of a people contributes to their
true felicity? or how far a simplicity of manners may be
corrupted by <HI>national</HI> improvement? are questions which
have been much agitated; and will never be decided, so long
as it shall be held just reasoning to argue from the abuse
against the use. But it will readily be allowed, that super∣stition
<PB N="308" REF="331"/>
is ever the companion of ignorance; and that a peo∣ple
who are both ignorant and superstitious, must necessarily
be benefited by an intercourse with nations more improved
and enlightened than themselves.</P>
<P>WE walked to a spot not far from hence, where a com∣munication
has been formed with the village Albenen.
Where the mountain inclines towards a slope, a foot-path
has been cut; but in those parts where the rock is directly
perpendicular, ladders are placed; and the peasants ascend
and descend with heavy burdens upon their shoulders. We
counted seven of these ladders. I mention this circumstance,
not as being an object so remarkable, perhaps, as is repre∣sented
by some travellers; but as it will convey to you an
idea of the extreme ruggedness and singularity of the
country.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 34.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">REPUBLIC OF THE VALLAIS—CARDINAL SCHINNER
—TOWN OF SION—MARTIGNY—ST. MAURICE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Sion, <DATE>August 19.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SION being nearly the point where the German lan∣guage
terminates, and where the French begins; the
natives in this part of the Vallais consequently speak both
tongues. We set out this morning at five, and came down
a very steep valley to Leuk, a small town built upon an emi∣nence
near the Rhone: that river is here very rapid; and,
if we may judge by the breadth of the channel, often over∣flows
its banks. We crossed it at this place, and continued
for some way through a forest of firs, till we again passed the
river to Siders: from thence we coasted its banks to Sion,
the capital of the Vallais.</P>
<P>THERE is another road leading from the Baths of Leuk
to Siders, which I traversed in 1785, more steep and incom∣modious,
but far more interesting to the traveller, who
delights in picturesque views. It is called the <HI>galleries;</HI> is
cut along the sides of an abrupt and rugged rock, in a zig∣zag
direction, and protected by a wooden railling, which
overhangs a dreadful abyss, so deep and obscure, that the
river Dala, which rolls impetuously through it, is neither
seen nor heard. The opposite chain of mountains is clothed
with dark forests, enlivened with pastures, and interspersed
<PB N="310" REF="333"/>
with occasional villages, which are situated one above the
other, to a considerable height, and seem scarcely accessible
but to foot passengers.</P>
<P>THIS tract of country called the Vallais, stretches from
east to west about a hundred miles; and contains about
100,000 inhabitants, who all profess the Roman Catholic re∣ligion.
It is divided into Upper and Lower Vallais: the for∣mer
reaches from the Furca to the Morge, below Sion; and
the latter from that river to St. Gingou, situated upon the
lake of Geneva.</P>
<P>THE Upper Vallais is sovereign of the Lower Vallais; and
comprises seven independent <HI>dixains</HI> or commonwealths;
namely, Sion, Goms, Brieg, Visp, Leuk, Raren, and Siders:
of these Sion is aristocratical, and the others democratical.
They are called <HI>Dixains,</HI> because the Upper Vallais being
divided into seven, and the Lower into three districts, each
division is a <HI>dixain,</HI> or <HI>tenth</HI> of the whole.</P>
<P>THE bishop of Sion was formerly absolute sovereign over
the greatest part of the Vallais; but his authority is at present
limited to the following prerogatives. He has the sole
power of pardoning criminals; and signs all the warrants for
execution: the money is coined in his name, and with the
arms of the republic. In his acts he stiles himself bishop of
Sion, prince of the German empire, and count and praefect
of the Vallais: in days of high ceremony he dines in pub∣lic,
and is waited upon by the first noble of the Vallais, who
is hereditary treasurer. He nominates the bailifs or gover∣nors
<PB N="311" REF="334"/>
of the two bailliages of Martigny and Arden; and pos∣sesses
considerable influence from his patronage of church
preferment. Upon a vacancy in the see, the canons of the
chapter of Sion present from their own body four candidates,
from whom one is appointed bishop by the <HI>Landsrath,</HI> or
general diet.</P>
<P>THE seven dixains form, conjointly with the bishop, the
republic of the Vallais; and all affairs are transacted in the
diet, called <HI>Landsrath,</HI> which meets twice every year at Sion.
This assembly consists of nine voices; the bishop; the <HI>lands-hauptmann,</HI>
who is chosen or confirmed by the diet every
two years; and the seven communities. The bishop pre∣sides,
and the <HI>lands-hauptmann</HI> collects the votes; and all
resolutions are decided by the majority. Each dixain, al∣though
it has but one vote, sends as many deputies as it
pleases: they generally consist of four;—a judge, a banneret,
a captain, and a lieutenant. The judge and the lieutenant
are appointed every two years; the two others hold their
offices for life. In all civil causes of a certain importance,
an appeal lies to the diet in the last resort, from the inferior
courts of justice in the several dixains. Thus, by the insti∣tution
of this supreme council, the several communities in
this country are firmly united, and form in conjunction one
body politic, or republic, for the general affairs of the na∣tion.
In other cases, each of the commonwealths is governed
by its own particular laws and customs.</P>
<P>BOTH the Upper and Lower Vallais were formerly de∣pendent
upon the bishop of Sion; but the inhabitants of the
<PB N="312" REF="335"/>
two districts united in order to limit his power; and, having
succeeded in the attempt, they quarrelled among themselves
for the superiority. A bloody war ensued; which termi∣nated,
in 1475, by the total defeat of the Lower Vallaisans.
Since that period, they have continued subject to the Upper
Vallais; enjoying however some very considerable pri∣vileges.</P>
<P>THE republic of the Vallais is an ally of the thirteen can∣tons;
and has formed a particular league with the seven
Catholic cantons, for the defence of their common religion.</P>
<P>THE bishops of Sion had formerly a considerable in∣fluence
over the political affairs of Switzerland; and Matthew
Schinner, the cardinal bishop, is famous in history for his
great abilities, his daring spirit of intrigue, and his turbulent
and restless ambition. He was born at Milbach, in the dix∣ain
of Goms; and in 1500 was appointed bishop of Sion. It
was entirely owing to his representations and influence,
that the Swiss troops gave a singular instance of infidelity
to their public engagements, by breaking a treaty which
they had just contracted with Francis the First. When
that monarch invaded the Milanese, he endeavoured to gain
the Swiss; who having taken the duke of Milan under their
protection, were the only obstacles to the progress of his
arms. After much hesitation, they were prevailed upon, by
the offer of considerable subsidies, to enter into a treaty: but
the alliance was no sooner concluded, than the cardinal of
Sion persuaded them to break it, and continue the war.
The Swiss historians however record, with triumph, the
<PB N="313" REF="336"/>
patriotic conduct of two officers upon this occasion; who,
remonstrating against this breach of faith, drew off eight
thousand troops; and returning to Switzerland, in some
measure retrieved the honour of the nation. The re∣mainder
of the army, instigated by the plausible and artful
eloquence of the cardinal, engaged Francis the First near
Marignano, in one of the most furious and obstinate battles
that was fought during the bloody wars of Italy. Night
alone put a stop to the engagement, without separating the
combatants; both armies were blended upon the field of
battle: and Francis slept upon the carriage of a cannon, at
no great distance from a battalion of the enemy. At day∣break
the Swiss renewed the charge with their usual cou∣rage,
and were received with equal bravery. At length the
intrepidity of the king, and the desperate valour of the
French, rose superior to the furious and repeated attacks of
the Swiss; who retreated to Milan, leaving Francis in pos∣session
of the field of battle: an advantage, however, which
he gained by the loss of his bravest troops.</P>
<P>THE cardinal, actuated by the most inveterate enmity to
the French, occasioned also, by his sole intrigues, the loss
of the Milanese to Francis. Lautrec, in the year 1521, com∣manded
a body of 12,000 Swiss, who formed the principal
strength of his army. On the other side, the cardinal had
obtained, by his influence over his countrymen, a secret
levy of the like number, to join the enemies of France: and
thus, for the first time, the Swiss were seen combating under
opposite banners, and ready to commit hostilities against
each other. Upon this occasion the cantons immediately
<PB N="314" REF="337"/>
dispatched messengers, with peremptory orders for the
Swiss in both armies, to return to their country. The car∣dinal
bribed the messengers to conceal these orders from the
Swiss in the army of the confederates, and to deliver them
only to those who were in the French service. The latter
obeyed accordingly; and this desertion weakening the army
of Lautrec, Milan, and the principal towns, surrendered to
the confederates. Soon after this additional instance of his
intrigues and influence, the cardinal ended his turbulent life
in the conclave, which assembled on the death of Leo the
Tenth, for the election of a new pope.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of this part of the Vallais are much
subject to <HI>goiters,</HI> or large excrescences of flesh that grow
from the throat, and often increase to a most enormous size:
but what is more extraordinary, idiocy also remarkably
abounds among them. I saw many instances of both kinds
as I passed through Sion: some idiots were basking in the
sun with their tongues out, and their heads hanging down;
exhibiting the most affecting spectacle of intellectual imbe∣cility
that can possibly be conceived. The causes which
produce a frequency of these phaenomena in this country,
is a curious question, which very much excites my in∣quiry:
but I shall defer giving my opinion, until I shall
have obtained farther information.</P>
<P>THE weather in this enclosed vale is so exceedingly hot,
that I am at this instant, although the evening is far ad∣vanced,
quite oppressed with the extreme sultriness. This lan∣guid
heat is probably one of the causes, which occasion the
<PB N="315" REF="338"/>
inconceivable laziness and indolence of the inhabitants:
much, however, must at the same time be attributed to the
richness of the soil; which prevents labour by almost spon∣taneously
producing the fruits of the earth. In fact, the
people assist nature very little: we passed several vineyards,
in which the vines were suffered to trail upon the ground;
whereas, if the branches were properly raised and supported,
the owner would be well rewarded by the superior quantity
and quality of their produce.</P>
<P>THE uncleanliness of the common people is disgusting
beyond expression. I have just been holding a conversation
upon this subject with my landlord; who, though himself a
notorious example, yet severely censured the dirtiness of his
countrymen; and seemed to assign it as one cause of <HI>goiters.</HI>
This assertion induced me to examine the person of my host
with somewhat more attention, in order to discover how it
stood with himself in that respect; and I was rather disap∣pointed
to find, that he proved an exception to his own re∣mark.
Let me not, however, be understood as insinuating
that the inhabitants in general are either goitrous, indolent,
or dirty; like that traveller who asserted, that all the women
of a certain town were crooked, red-haired, and pitted with
the small-pox, because his landlady happened to be so. In∣deed,
I look upon national reflections in general, to proceed
from the narrowest and most illiberal turn of mind; and
have always been cautious not to judge of the physical, or
moral character of any people from a partial and superficial
view. But as to the singular prevalency in the present in∣stance,
<PB REF="339"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="316" REF="340"/>
of goiters and idiocy, it is a fact which I can venture
to affirm, both from my own experience, and from various
conversations I have held with several men of learning and
observation of this country; and the general dirtiness and in∣dolence
of the common people are too notorious to escape
the observation of the most careless traveller.</P>
<P>SION is situated near the Rhone, at the foot of three in∣sulated
rocks, that rise immediately from the plain. The
highest, called Tourbillon, supports the ruins of the old epis∣copal
palace, still containing two or three untenanted apart∣ments,
in one of which are the portraits of the several
bishops. On the second rock, denominated Valeria, are ob∣served
the remains of the old cathedral, and a few houses
belonging to the canons. On Mayoria, the third rock, stands
the episcopal palace, an antient edifice of stone, built in 1547.
On seeing the apartments, I was greatly struck with their plain∣ness,
and could not avoid reflecting with pleasure on the simpli∣city
of manners, which must necessarily prevail in this country;
when the rooms, inhabited by the sovereign, instead of bespeak∣ing
the magnificence of a court, are scarcely superior to the
dwelling of a peasant. Two apartments principally engaged
my attention. The first is that in which the Diet assembles:
at the upper end are two armed chairs for the bishop and the
<HI>lands-hauptmann,</HI> and on each side a row of smaller seats for
the deputies of the seven <HI>dixains.</HI> The other apartment is
the hall, in which the bishop holds his court, like the feudal
lords of antient times: at the further extremity is a raised
seat, called a throne, surrounded by a wooden balustrade;
<PB N="317" REF="341"/>
and, as an incitement to wisdom and impartiality, the figures
of Justice, and the story of Solomon's judgment, are coarsely
painted upon the walls.</P>
<P>SION is an antient town, and was formerly the capital of
the <HI>Seduni,</HI> who inhabited this part of the country in the
time of Julius Caesar. A few remaining inscriptions still
prove its antiquity; and, among others, so obliterated that I
was not able to decypher them, I observed one which is more
legible: it is in honour of the emperor Augustus, during his
eleventh consulship. In this inscription the town is called
<HI>Civitas Sedunorum.</HI></P>
<P>AT Sion we parted with our horses and guides, who had
accompanied us from Altdorf; and procured a piece of luxury,
to which we had been for some time unaccustomed; I mean
a coach. But, notwithstanding the concentrated heat of the
climate, and the great sultriness of the air, I prefer riding or
walking; as by that means I enjoy a more unobstructed view of
the country: and indeed the scenes are so beautiful, and so per∣petually
changing, that the attention is every moment engaged
by a variety of new objects that strongly demand admiration.</P>
<P>UPON entering the Lower Vallais, I perceived as much
uncleanliness, but a greater appearance of industry; and I
am informed, that the natives are not altogether so indolent
as the inhabitants of Sion and its environs. This imputation
of indolence will not hold good with respect to all the in∣habitants
of the Upper Vallais: for in the eastern part of
that district, which we entered after having crossed the
<PB N="318" REF="342"/>
Furca, the soil, though far inferior in richness and fertility,
was much better cultivated; and the people seemed indus∣trious.
Some physical reasons may be assigned for this differ∣ence;
for, <HI>there</HI> the weather is not so sultry, the water is
not unwholesome, and the air is remarkably salutary. Ac∣cordingly,
upon our first entering the Vallais, we did not ob∣serve
any of those goitrous persons or idiots, who struck us
so much in the midland parts.</P>
<P>WE stopped at the village of Martigny, which, according
to antiquarians, was the antient <HI>Octodurum.</HI> It is said, that
near this place may be traced the site of Sergius Galba's
camp, one of Julius Caesar's lieutenants, who was sent by
that general to subdue the <HI>Veragri,</HI> the <HI>Nantuates,</HI> and the
<HI>Seduni;</HI> the antient inhabitants of these districts. It seems
evident indeed from Caesar's description, in the third book
of his Commentaries, that <HI>Octodurum</HI> could not be far from
the present situation of Martigny; which stands in a small
plain, encircled by high mountains, and divided by the
Dranse, that falls into the Rhone. I cannot however ascer∣tain
from my own observation, whether any traces of a Ro∣man
encampment still remain; nor could I gain the least
information from the inhabitants; so that the conjecture
concerning the situation of <HI>Octodurum</HI> rests only upon the
faith of antiquarians, and on the general position of the
country.</P>
<P>MARTIGNY is a place much frequented by travellers: it
leads to the valley of Chamouny, to St. Maurice and the lake
of Geneva, and is the passage of the merchandize, which is
<PB N="319" REF="343"/>
conveyed over the Great St. Bernard into Italy. Near Mar∣tigny
we passed under the majestic ruins of La Bathia, an old
episcopal castle, standing upon the summit of a craggy rock,
and impending over the impetuous Dranse. The road from
hence to St. Maurice runs under a chain of rocks, the Rhone
flowing at a small distance through the middle of a fertile
vale. Having crossed the Trient, a turbid torrent which
issues from a narrow and obscure glen, remarkable for its
rugged and romantic scenery, we arrived at the Pisse-Vache,
a cataract much noticed by travellers. The characteristic
beauty of this fall is, that it seems to burst from a cleft in
the middle of the rock, through hanging shrubs that start
abruptly from the crevices, and forms a perpendicular co∣lumn
of water about two hundred feet in height. The
body of water being very ample, and the elevation not so
considerable as to reduce it entirely into spray, render the ef∣fect
very striking. I enjoyed also the additional pleasure of
seeing the sun rise opposite to this water-fall. The regular
expansion of the rays enlightening the different parts of the
column of water; and the gradual descent of the rainbow
formed by the spray, were inexpressibly beautiful. These
torrents are my delight: but perhaps they recur too often in
my letters to continue to be yours. Formerly travellers pas∣sed
close to the Pisse-Vache; but a few years ago part of the
rock falling down totally obstructed the road, which now runs
through the middle of the valley. I now traversed on foot,
not without some difficulty, amid the fallen fragments, where,
on a former occasion, I had passed in a carriage.</P>
<P>AT the extremity of the Lower Vallais, the two chains of
mountains that bound this country, approach towards the
<PB N="320" REF="344"/>
Rhone, which nearly fills the interval between them. In
this spot is situated the town of St. Maurice, built almost to∣tally
upon the rock, at the foot of some steep mountains, and
at a small distance from the river. Its antient appellation
was <HI>Agaunum:</HI> it takes that of St. Maurice from an abbey,
erected in the beginning of the sixth century, by Sigismond
king of Burgundy, in honour of a saint, who is supposed to
have suffered martyrdom in this place. This saint was the
leader of the famous Theban legion, which is recorded to
have been massacred by order of the Emperor Maximin, for
not renouncing Christianity. This history has given rise to
much controversy: while some authors have treated it as a
mere forgery; others have contended for its authenticity,
with as much warmth and zeal, as if the truth of Christiani∣ty
depended upon the decision. Without entering into the
merits of the controversy; I cannot but remark, that the
cause of Christianity has suffered more from weak and im∣prudent
defenders, than from the sharpest attacks of its most
inveterate adversaries. Indeed, the question concerning the
number and sufferings of the martyrs, has occasioned much
idle disputation: for, reduce the popular accounts of both as
low as probability can reasonably carry them, there will still
remain sufficient evidence of the wonderful constancy and
calm resolution of those primitive victims: and whether a
hundred thousand, or only fifty, suffered for the cause of
Christianity, it will equally stand upon the same firm and
immoveable foundation. Nor is the inquiry more material
concerning the motives that actuated its powerful and cruel
adversaries. It matters not whether Decius ordered the
Christians to be massacred, because they had been favoured
<PB N="321" REF="345"/>
by his predecessor Philip, or from his attachment to the Pa∣gan
rites; whether Maximin persecuted them from interest∣ed
motives; Dioclesian as introducing innovations in his go∣vernment;
or whether Constantine protected them from
conviction or policy. For the truth of Christianity is in
no respect affected either by the imprudence of its early
professors (if with any they were justly chargeable) or
the political reasons that influenced the conduct of those
emperors.</P>
<P>A FEW Roman inscriptions, chiefly sepulchral, and two
defaced columns, are the only uncontroverted remains of the
antiquity of St. Maurice. It is principally distinguished as
being the chief entrance from the canton of Berne into the
Vallais. This entrance is formed by a narrow pass, so
strongly fortified by nature, that a handful of men might
defend it against a considerable army.</P>
<P>THE stone bridge over the Rhone is much admired for its
bold projection: it is of a single arch, and the span is a hun∣dred
and thirty feet. Half of this bridge belongs to the Val∣lais,
and the remainder to the canton of Berne.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF THE VALLAIS—GOITERS AND IDIOTS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Trient, <DATE>August 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now writing from the village of Trient, on my way
to Mont Blanc and the alps of Savoy. From the moun∣tain
of the Furca, its eastern boundary, two vast ranges of
alps enclose the Vallais: the southern chain separates it from
the Milanese, Piedmont, and part of Savoy; the northern di∣vides
it from the canton of Berne. These two chains, in
their various windings, form several small valleys, watered
by numerous torrents that rush into the Rhone, as it tra∣verses
the whole district from the Furca to St. Maurice. A
country thus entirely enclosed within high alps, and con∣sisting
of plains, elevated valleys, and lofty mountains, must
necessarily exhibit a great variety of situations, climates, and
productions. Accordingly, the Vallais presents to the cu∣rious
traveller a quick succession of prospects, as beautiful as
they are diversified. Vineyards; rich pasture-grounds co∣vered
with cattle; corn, flax, fruit-trees, and forests, occa∣sionally
bordered by naked rocks, the summits whereof are
crowned with everlasting snow. This strong and striking
contrast between the pastoral and the sublime, the cultivated
and the wild, cannot but affect the mind of an observer with
the most pleasing emotions.</P>
<P>As to the productions of the Vallais; they must evident∣ly
vary, according to the great diversity of climates, by
<PB N="323" REF="347"/>
which this country is so peculiarly distinguished. It supplies
more than sufficient wine and corn for interior consump∣tion:
and indeed a considerable quantity of both are yearly
exported; the soil in the midland and lower districts being
exceedingly rich and fertile. In the plain, where the heat
is collected and confined between the mountains, the harvest
is usually finished in July: whereas, in the more elevated
parts, barely is the only grain that can be cultivated with
any success; and the crop is seldom cut before November.
About Sion, the fig, the melon, and all the other fruits of
Italy, come to perfection: in consequence of this singular
variety of climates, I tasted in the same day, strawberries,
cherries, plums, pears, and grapes; each of them the <HI>na∣tural</HI>
growth of the country.</P>
<P>WITH respect to manufactures; there are none of any
consequence; and indeed the general ignorance of the peo∣ple
is no less remarkable than their indolence; so that they
may be considered, in regard to knowledge and improve∣ments,
as some centuries behind the Swiss, who are certainly
a very enlightened nation. The peasants seldom endeavour
to meliorate those lands where the soil is originally bad; nor
to draw the most advantage from those which are uncom∣monly
fertile: having few wants, and being satisfied with the
spontaneous gifts of nature, they enjoy her blessings without
much considering in what manner to improve them.</P>
<P>BEFORE I take leave of the Vallais, I shall communicate
to you the result of my inquiries concerning the causes,
which contribute to render goitrous persons and idiots so re∣markably
common in these parts: premising, at the same
<PB N="324" REF="348"/>
time, that I must stand greatly in need of your candour,
when you peruse the following considerations on a subject so
extremely complicated; and on which so many different opi∣nions
have been advanced by naturalists and physicians.</P>
<P>FIRST, with respect to goiters. The notion that snow-water
occasions these excrescences, seems totally void of
foundation. For on that supposition, why are they common
in the midland and lower parts, and extremely unfrequent
in the higher regions of Switzerland; and particularly what
reason can be assigned, why the natives of those places that
lie most contiguous to the glaciers, and who drink no other
water than what descends immediately from those immense
reservoirs of ice and snow, are not subject to this malady?
Why are the inhabitants of those countries in which there
is no snow, afflicted with it? For, these guttural tumours are
to be found in the environs of Naples, in the island of Su∣matra,
and at Patna and Purnea, in the East-Indies, where
snow is unknown.</P>
<P>BUT as it would be needless to mention the various opi∣nions
on this subject, I shall at present confine myself to
what, from repeated inquiries, from my own particular obser∣vations,
and from positive facts, appears to be the <HI>primary</HI>
cause of goiters. The springs that supply drink to the na∣tives
are impregnated with a calcareous matter, called in
Switzerland <HI>tuf</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>The Porus of the older authors.</L>

<PB N="325" REF="349"/>
in Derbyshire, so minutely dissolved as not in the least
to affect the transparency of the water. Will it be deemed
improbable, that the impalpable particles of this substance,
thus dissolved, should introduce themselves into the glands of
the throat, and produce goiters? I ground this opinion on the
following observations and facts.</P>
<P>To speak in general: during my travels through Eu∣rope,
I never failed to observe that <HI>tuf,</HI> or this calcareous de∣position,
abounds in all those districts wherein goiters are
common. I noticed goitrous persons and much <HI>tuf</HI> in Der∣byshire,
in various parts of the Vallais, in the Valteline, at
Lucerne, Friburgh, and Berne, near Aigle and Bex, in seve∣ral
places of the Pays de Vaud, near Dresden, in the vallies
of Savoy and Piedmont, near Turin and Milan.</P>
<P>To descend to particular instances. The inhabitants of
Friburgh, Berne, and Lucerne, are much subject to guttural
excrescences. With respect to Friburgh, I observed that one
of the principal springs which supplies the town with water
issues from a neighbouring stone-quarry, and has formed
large depositions of <HI>tuf</HI> on the rock from which it bubbles.
The pipes, also, which convey water to the public fountains
at Berne, are extremely charged with the same calcareous
sediment; and a gentleman, on whose veracity I can depend,
assured me, that he is subject to a small swelling in the
throat, which usually increases in winter, when he is
chiefly resident at Berne, and diminishes in summer, on
his removal to other places, where the waters are not loaded
with <HI>tuf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="350"/>
I WAS, moreover, informed by General Pfiffer, that at Lu∣cerne
all the waters, excepting one spring, are impregnated
with <HI>tuf,</HI> and that the natives, who dwell near that spring,
are much less subject to goiters than the other inhabitants;
that the same difference is observed among the members of
the same family, between those who drink no water but
what is drawn from that spring, and the others who do not
use that precaution. The General shewed me also the tin
vessel, in which water was every morning boiled for his use,
and which was so speedily and thickly incrustated as to ren∣der
it necessary to have it cleansed twice a week. The water
which yields this deposition, is as transparent as chrystal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Although it appears that wherever there are goiters there is tuf-stone; yet the reverse is by no means true, that wherever the waters deposit tuf, there are <HI>always</HI> goiters. For perhaps the natives do not drink of the springs which are loaded with <HI>tuf;</HI> or that substance is not sufficient∣ly dissolved in the waters; absolute solution being, perhaps, necessary to produce these swellings.</NOTE>.
I may add likewise, that I visited many places which border
upon those districts wherein goiters and <HI>tuf</HI> are frequent, and
which have precisely the same situation and climate, yet
whose inhabitants were not goitrous, and where I did not
observe any appearance of <HI>tuf.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the strongest proof, in favour of this opinion, is de∣rived
from the following facts. A surgeon, whom I met at
the Baths of Leuk, informed me, that he had not unfre∣quently
extracted concretions of <HI>tuf-stone</HI> from several goi∣ters;
and that from one in particular, which suppurated, he
had taken several flat pieces, each about half an inch long.
He added, that the same substance is found in the stomachs
of cows, and in the goitrous tumors to which even the dogs
<PB N="327" REF="351"/>
of the country are subject. The same gentleman assured me,
that in the course of an extensive practice, he had diminished
and cured the goiters of many young persons by emollient
liquors and external applications; that his principal method,
in order to prevent them in future, consisted in removing the
patients from the places where the springs are impregnated
with <HI>tuf;</HI> and, if that could not be contrived, by forbidding
the use of water which was not purified. He confirmed the
report, that infants are occasionally born with guttural swel∣lings;
particularly those whose parents are goitrous; and
remarked, that one of his own children had at its birth a goi∣ter
as large as an egg, although neither he nor his wife, who
were both foreigners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the former instance, goiters may, though perhaps erroneously, be esteemed hereditary; but in the latter, where the parents are both foreigners and not goi∣trous, can scarcely be derived from any other cause than the aliment of the mo∣ther.</NOTE>, were afflicted with that malady. He
had dissipated it by external remedies; and since that period,
had invariably prohibited his family from tasting the spring
waters, unless they were distilled, or mixed with wine or
vinegar; by which means he was able to preserve them
from those tumours in the throat, that were extremely com∣mon
among the natives of the town which he inhabited.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH it is by no means my intention to trouble you
with the various opinions which have been advanced on this
subject; yet it would be unjust to withhold from you that of
M. de Saussure, whose accurate researches and profound in∣vestigation
on philosophical subjects, deserve to be weighed
with the greatest attention. That able naturalist, in a recent
<PB N="328" REF="352"/>
publication<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voyages dans les Alpes, ch. 48. vol. ii. p. 480.</NOTE>, attributes the production of goiters not to the
waters, but principally to the concentrated heat of the cli∣mate,
and stagnation of the air. He informs us, that in all
his travels through the Alpine countries, he never observed
goiters in any places, which are elevated more than 500 or
600 toises<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">3200 and 3840 English feet.</NOTE> above the level of the sea: he noticed them in
those vallies where the heat is concentrated, and the air stag∣nates;
and that they usually cease wherever the valley termi∣nates,
and the country expands into a large plain. With
great deference, however, to his opinion, may I be permitted
to observe, that the conclusion does not absolutely follow
from these premises? For it may be remarked, that in places
elevated more than 500 or 600 toises above the level of the
sea, the springs are too near their sources, to have dissolved a
sufficient quantity of calcareous matter, or so minutely as
may be requisite for the generation of goiters; and that
when the valley expands into a plain, the waters may deposit
their sediment by mixing with the rivers and lakes, or by
filtrating through the earth and gravel. But although the
two causes mentioned by M. de Saussure do not produce,
they may <HI>assist</HI> in producing guttural excrescences, by relax∣ing
the fibres, and disposing the glands of the throat to admit
more easily the introduction of the impalpable parts which are
dissolved in the water. For it is observable, that women and
children, whose frames are more relaxed than those of men,
are most liable to be afflicted with these swellings; and that
the natives of those districts most remarkable for the size and
<PB N="329" REF="353"/>
number of goiters, are extremely wan and livid, much sub∣ject
to intermitting fevers, and other disorders which are
judged to proceed from relaxation. In fine, although the
concentrated heat, and stagnation of the air, may be allowed
to affect the human body to a considerable degree; yet they
do not of themselves seem sufficient for the effect in question,
without the intervention of some more powerful agent:
and this agent <HI>seems</HI> to be the water; if the facts already
stated, prove consonant to truth and experience.</P>
<P>IT may be necessary, however, to obviate an objection
which maintains, that goiters must rather originate from
climate and situation; because foreigners established in the
country, are <HI>never</HI> afflicted with those tumours, while their
children are no less subject to them than the natives. But is
it an uncontrovertible fact, that <HI>no</HI> foreigner has ever been
afflicted with this malady? The question, I should presume,
can scarcely be replied to in the affirmative. And all that
can be established, with any degree of certainty, is, that
foreigners are <HI>less</HI> subject to these swellings than their chil∣dren
or the natives. In this respect the answer is evident.
Persons who usually settle in foreign countries are adults;
and adults are doubtless much less liable than children to an
endemial malady, whose operation is gradual, and which
requires much length of time, before its effects are in the
least visible. And it is remarked, that, among the natives
themselves, those persons, who have escaped this disorder
during their infancy, are seldom attacked by it to any con∣siderable
degree at a more advanced age.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="354"/>
IN reasoning upon this, as well as on similar subjects,
where a cause is sought for, capable of producing a certain
effect; it is necessary to establish a primary and general
cause, which <HI>always</HI> and <HI>necessarily</HI> exists, wherever that
effect is produced; and to exclude those circumstances,
which do not <HI>always</HI> and <HI>necessarily</HI> exist, wherever that
effect is produced. Thus, in the present instance: If snow-water
occasions goiters, wherever there are goiters, there
<HI>must</HI> be snow-water; which is contrary to fact and ex∣perience.
If the concentrated heat of the climate, and stag∣nation
of the air, are <HI>necessary</HI> to the formation of goiters,
those excrescences could never be formed where these causes
are wanting; which is not confirmed by fact and experience.
If waters, impregnated with <HI>tuf,</HI> or with certain calcareous
substances, produce goiters; wherever there are goiters, the
natives must drink waters so impregnated; and this <HI>seems</HI>
agreeable to fact and experience.</P>
<P>THE same causes, which generate goiters, <HI>probably</HI>
operate in the case of idiots: for, wherever the goiters pre∣vail
to a considerable degree, idiots also invariably abound.
As such is the nice and inexplicable connexion between our
bodies and our minds, that the one almost invariably sym∣pathises
with the other; it is by no means an ill-grounded
conjecture, that the same causes which affect the body
should also affect the mind; or, in other words, that the
same waters, which create obstructions and goiters, should
also occasion mental imbecility and disarrangement.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="355"/>
ALTHOUGH these idiots are frequently the children of
goitrous parents, and have usually those swellings them∣selves;
yet they are sometimes the offspring even of healthy
parents, whose other children are properly organized, and
are themselves free from guttural excrescences. I observed
several children, scarcely ten years of age, who had very
large goiters. These tumours, when they increase to a con∣siderable
magnitude, check respiration, and render those
who are afflicted with them exceedingly indolent and lan∣guid.
Some persons have, in opposition to the opinion which
I have ventured to advance, supposed, that the small guttural
swellings, which are common in many other parts, and the
large excrescences, which are more particularly observed in
the Vallais, in the Valley of Aost, and in some other places,
do not proceed from the same cause, and are not the same
disorder. But sufficient reasons have not been assigned for
this opinion. During my expedition through the Vallais and
other parts of Switzerland, I noticed some of all proportions,
from the size of a walnut to almost the bigness of a peck
loaf. As the same gradation may be also observed in the
species of idiots; by a similar mode of argument, those who
possess some faint dawnings of reason might be discriminated
from others, who are totally deaf and dumb, and give no
proof of existence but the more animal sensations. Whereas
it is probable, that in both instances, the greater or lesser
disarrangement of the body or mind does not indicate a
difference of complaint, but only greater or lesser degrees of
the same complaint.</P>
<P>IT is to be presumed, that a people accustomed to the
sight of these excrescences, will not be shocked at their de∣formity;
<PB N="332" REF="356"/>
but I do not find, as some writers assert, that they
consider them as beauties. To judge from the accounts of
many travellers, it might be supposed, that the natives,
without exception, were either idiots or goitrous: whereas,
in fact, the Vallaisans, in general, are a robust race; and all
that with truth can be affirmed, is, that goitrous persons,
and idiots, are more abundant in some districts of the Vallais;
than perhaps in any other part of the globe.</P>
<P>IT has been asserted also, that the people very much
respect these idiots, and even consider them <HI>as blessings from
Heaven;</HI> which is strongly contradicted by others. Upon
my questioning some gentlemen of this country, at the
baths of Leuk, they treated the notion as absurd and false:
but whether they delivered their real sentiments, or were
unwilling to confirm what might lower their countrymen in
the opinion of a stranger, will admit perhaps of some doubt.
For having, since that time, repeatedly inquired among the
lower ranks, I am convinced, that the common people esteem
them as blessings. They call them “<HI>Souls of God, without
sin:</HI>” and many parents, from superstition, prefer these idiot-children
to those whose understandings are perfect; because,
as they are incapable of intentional criminality, they consider
them as certain of happiness in a future state. Nor is this
opinion entirely without its good effect; as it disposes the
parents to pay greater attention to such helpless beings.
These idiots are suffered to marry, as well among them∣selves
as with others.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PASSAGE OF THE TETE NOIRE—COL DE BALME—
MONT BLANC—ITS GREAT ELEVATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Geneva, <DATE>August 28.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>UPON quitting Trient, we traversed some narrow val∣lies,
through forests of pines, by the side of a small
but impetuous torrent, which takes its rise from the glacier
of the same name. The road, which is very rugged, is car∣ried
over the steep crags of a mountain called <HI>La Tete Noire.</HI>
A little way from Trient we entered the duchy of Faucigny,
subject to the king of Sardinia. Our road was very rough,
till we arrived at the vale of Chamouny; the great moun∣tains
and glaciers of Savoy rising majestically before us.</P>
<P>ANOTHER way leads from Trient to Chamouny over the
<HI>Col de Balme.</HI> I passed it on a mule the 7th of September
1785; it is exceedingly steep, but not dangerous, for I did
not even find it necessary to dismount. The path, which is
in no part bare rock, runs through a thick wood that clothes
the sides of the mountain. We set off from Trient on this
expedition about half past four, with the expectation of see∣ing
the sun rise of the summit of Mont Blanc, but were dis∣appointed;
for we did not reach the Col de Balme in less
than two hours, and day had already begun to break. We
enjoyed, however, from the summit an extensive prospect,
which many travellers consider as the most sublime view in
all Switzerland: on one side it commands the Vallais, the
<PB N="334" REF="359"/>
alps of St. Bernard, and the distant mountains of the cantons
of Underwalden and Berne; the other comprehends Mont
Blanc and the circumjacent heights. I observed the <HI>Point de
Mousson;</HI> the <HI>Mortine,</HI> supporting on its top the glacier of
<HI>Buet,</HI> on which M. de Luc made his celebrated experiments
to ascertain the state of the atmosphere; the <HI>Point de la Tour;
Les Aiguilles d'Argentiere;</HI> the <HI>Aiguille de Midi,</HI> a piked rock
starting out of a large mass of snow; and, lastly, <HI>Mont Blanc</HI>
itself. The highest point of this gigantic mountain is in the
shape of a compressed hemisphere, and is called from its form
<HI>La Bosse du Dromedaire;</HI> from that point it gradually sinks,
presents a kind of concave surface of snow, in the midst of
which is a small pyramid of ice; it then rises into a second
hemisphere, called by some <HI>Little Mont Blanc,</HI> but with more
propriety by others <HI>Le Dome du Milieu,</HI> or the <HI>Middle Dome;</HI>
thence it descends into another concave surface terminating
in a point, indiscriminately styled by the natives <HI>Aiguille de
Gouté, Point de Gouté,</HI> and <HI>Dome de Gouté,</HI> and which I shall
name the <HI>Dome of Gouté:</HI> from that dome it ends abruptly,
and loses itself amid the mountains that bound the vale of
Chamouny.</P>
<P>MONT BLANC is particularly distinguished from other
mountains, by having its summit and sides clothed to a con∣siderable
depth with a mantle of snow, almost without the
intervention of the least rock to break the glare of the <HI>while</HI>
appearance; from whence its name is derived. This cir∣cumstance
frequently deceives the eye unaccustomed to such
objects, and in many situations renders it less lofty in appear∣ance,
than it is in reality. Although its summit was elevated
<PB N="335" REF="360"/>
more than seven thousand feet above the spot where I stood,
yet it did not impress me with that astonishment which
might be expected from its superior height and magnitude
above the circumjacent mountains. I was indeed more
struck with the first view of the Schreckhorn from the top
of the Scheidec, than of Mont Blanc from the Col de Balme.
The summit of Mont Blanc being of a roundish form, and
covered with snow, unites beauty with grandeur; whereas
the Schreckhorn being piked, naked, and its shagged sides
only streaked with snow, its grand characteristics are rug∣gedness
and horror; and hence, indeed, it derives its name
of Schreckhorn, or the <HI>Peak of Terror</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The traveller will recollect, that I am here describing Mont Blanc, as ob∣served from the Col de Balme, and the vale of Chamouny. Those who have seen it from the valley of Aost assure me, that it is not on that side covered with a mantle of snow, but exceeds even the Schreckhorn in ruggedness and horror.</NOTE>. But Mont Blanc
soon re-assumed its real importance, seemed to increase in
size and height, and solely attracted our attention, until we
entered the vale of Chamouny.</P>
<P>YOU, who are totally unacquainted with alpine scenes,
may, perhaps, conceive a faint idea of the elevation of this
gigantic mountain, on being informed, that the mantle of
snow, which appears to cover its top and sides, exceeds an
altitude of four thousand feet perpendicular, and nine thou∣sand
feet in a horizontal direction from the <HI>Dome of Gouté</HI>
to the summit; and that the height of the snow and ice, esti∣mated
from the source of the Arveron, at the bottom of the
glacier of Montanvert, to the summit of Mont Blanc, cannot
be less than twelve thousand perpendicular feet, or near
three times as high as Snowdon, in North Wales.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="361"/>
FIVE glaciers extend into this vale of Chamouny, and are
separated from each other by forests, corn-fields, and mea∣dows;
so that large tracts of ice are blended with cultivation,
and perpetually succeed each other in the most singular and
striking vicissitude. These glaciers, which lie chiefly in the
hollows of the mountains, and are some leagues in length,
unite at the foot of <HI>Mont Blanc;</HI> the highest mountain in
Europe, and probably of the antient world.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the calculations of Mr. de Luc, (by whose
improvement of the barometer, elevations are taken with a
degree of accuracy before unattainable), the height of this
mountain above the level of the sea is 2,391 ⅓ French toises,
or 15,304 English feet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In reducing the French toise, which is equal to six French feet, to English measure, I have considered the proportion of the English to the French foot as 15 to 16. Its real proportion, according to the accurate calculation of Sir George Schuck∣borough, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or 15 to 16 and a small fraction: but the error in my calculation being not one toise in a thousand, in order to prevent confusion, I have omitted the small fraction.</NOTE>; or, according to Sir George
Schuckborough, of 15,662 feet; which gives a difference of
only 358 feet. Mr. de Luc having found the altitude of the
<HI>Buet,</HI> from thence took geometrically the elevation of <HI>Mont
Blanc.</HI> The labours of this celebrated naturalist, and his
rules for computing heights by the barometer, are to be
found in his very valuable treatise, “<HI>Sur les Modifications de
l'Atmosphère.</HI>” These rules are explained, and his tables
reduced to English measure, by Dr. Maskelyne, R. A.; and
still more fully by Dr. Horsley: both these treatises are
published in the Philosophical Transactions for the year
1774.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="362"/>
THE accuracy of the barometrical measurements made
by Mr. de Luc, was verified by Sir George Schuckborough,
in a number of ingenious experiments towards ascertaining
the elevation of several mountains of Savoy, a short time be∣fore
I arrived at Geneva. He followed Mr. de Luc's method;
computed the heights of several mountains, reciprocally, by
barometrical and geometrical observations; and perceived
that the former coincided almost exactly with the latter.
Having found the elevation of the summit of the <HI>Mole</HI> above
the surface of the lake of Geneva, he took from thence the
geometrical altitude of <HI>Mont Blanc.</HI> During the course of
these experiments, he was enabled to correct some trifling
errors that had crept into Mr. de Luc's calculations; to im∣prove
still further the discoveries of the latter; and has faci∣litated
the means of taking elevations, by simplifying the
tables and rules necessary for that purpose.</P>
<P>I AM convinced, from the situation of <HI>Mont Blanc,</HI> and
from its superior altitude above the surrounding mountains,
that it exceeds the loftiest point in Switzerland, which,
beyond a doubt, is, next to <HI>Mont Blanc,</HI> the most elevated
ground in Europe. That it is higher than any part of Asia
and Africa, is an assertion which can only be proved by com∣paring
the judicious calculations of modern travellers, with
the exaggerated accounts of former writers; and by shewing,
that there is probably no mountain in those two quarters of
the globe, the altitude whereof, when accurately taken, sur∣passes
15,000 feet.</P>
<P>PERHAPS in no instance has the imagination of man
been more given to amplification, than in ascertaining the
<PB N="338" REF="363"/>
heights of the globe. Gruner, in his description of the
Swiss glaciers, has mentioned the elevation of some remark∣able
mountains, agreeably to the calculations of several
famous geographers and travellers, both antient and modern:</P>

<P>BUT these calculations are evidently so extravagant, that
their exaggeration must strike the most common observer.
If we consult more modern and rational accounts; it appears,
that the Peak of Teneriff and Aetna have been frequently
supposed to be the highest points of the globe. The former
is estimated by some natural philosophers, to be 3,000 toises,
or 19,200 feet above the level of the sea; but, according to
Feuillé, this elevation is reduced to 2,070 toises, or 13,248
feet; whereas Aetna, by the accurate computations of Mr.
de Saussure, rises only<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>According to Sir George Schuck∣borough, 1,672 toises, or 10,954 feet: who says, “I have ventured to compute the height of this celebrated mountain from my own tables, though from an obser∣vation of Mr. de Saussure, in 1773, which that gentleman obligingly communicated to me. It will serve to shew that this volcano is by no means the highest mountain of the old world; and that Ve∣suvius, placed upon Mount Aetna, would not be equal to the height of Mont Blanc, which I take to be the most ele∣vated point of Europe, Asia, and Africa.” I am happy to find my conjectures cor∣roborated by that ingenious and accurate observer.

the sea. Hence it will appear, that there are no mountains,
<PB N="339" REF="364"/>
except those in America, the elevation whereof, according to
Condamine, surpasses 3,000 toises, or 19,200 feet, which are
equal to the altitude of Mont Blanc.</P>
<P>IN order, however, to determine with absolute certainty
that Mont Blanc is the highest point of the whole world, it
would be necessary to estimate, by the same mode of mensu∣ration,
Mont Blanc, the Schreckhorn, the Peak of Teneriff,
the mountains of the Moon in Africa, the Taurus, and the
Caucasus. The chain of the Caucasus has long been deemed
the highest mountains of Asia; and some philosophers,
upon considering the great superiority of the eastern rivers
over the European, both in depth and breadth, have drawn
a presumptive argument, that the Asiatic mountains are
much more lofty than those of Europe. But conjectures are
now banished from natural philosophy: and, until it shall
be proved from undoubted calculations, that the highest
part of the Caucasus rises more than 15,000 feet above the
level of the sea, Mont Blanc may be fairly considered as
more elevated.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">GLACIER OF BOSSON—MONTANVERT—EXPEDITION
ACROSS THE VALLEY OF ICE.</HEAD>
<P>AUGUST 23d, we mounted by the side of the glacier
of Bosson, to <HI>les Murailles de glace,</HI> so called from their
resemblance to walls: they form large ranges of ice of pro∣digious
thickness and solidity, rising abruptly from their
base, and parallel to each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1785, these <HI>murailles de glace</HI> no longer existed.</NOTE>. Some of these ranges ap∣peared
to us about a hundred and fifty feet high; but, if
we may believe our guides, they are four hundred feet above
their real base. Near them were pyramids and cones of ice
of all forms and sizes, shooting to a very considerable height,
in the most beautiful and fantastic shapes. From this
glacier, which we crossed without much difficulty, we en∣joyed
a fine view of the vale of Chamouny.</P>
<P>THE 24th. We had proposed sallying forth this morning
very early, in order to visit the valley of ice, in the glacier
of Montanvert, and to penetrate as far as the time would
admit; but the weather proving cloudy, and likely to rain,
we deferred our departure till nine. Having procured three
guides, we ascended on horseback about three miles: we
<PB N="341" REF="367"/>
were then obliged to dismount, and scrambled up a steep and
rugged path, called “the road of the <HI>crystal-hunters.</HI>”
From the summit of the Montanvert we descended to the
edge of the glacier; and made a refreshing meal upon some
cold provision which we brought with us. A large block
of granite, called “<HI>La pierre des Anglois,</HI>” served us for a
table; and near us was a hovel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since my first expedition, Mr. Blair, an English gentleman, has built a more com∣modious wooden hut, which, from him, is called Blair's Cabin.</NOTE>, where those, who make
expeditions towards Mont Blanc, frequently pass the night.
The scene around us was magnificent and sublime; num∣berless
rocks rising boldly above the clouds, some of whose
tops were bare, others covered with snow. Many of these
peaks gradually diminishing towards their summits, end in
sharp points, and are called <HI>Needles.</HI> Between these rocks,
the valley of ice stretches several leagues in length, and is
nearly a mile broad; extending on one side towards Mont
Blanc, and, on the other, towards the plain of Chamouny.
The names of the principal needles are, Aiguilles de Midi,
de Dru, de Bouchard, de Moine, de Tacul, de Charmeaux;
and the five glaciers, that stretch towards the plain of Cha∣mouny,
and unite at the foot of Mont Blanc, are called
Tacona, Bossons, Montanvert, Argentiere, and Tour.</P>
<P>AFTER we had sufficiently refreshed ourselves, we pre∣pared
for our adventure across the ice. We had each of us a
long pole spiked with iron; and, in order to secure us as
much as possible from slipping, the guides fastened to our
shoes <HI>crampons,</HI> or small bars of iron, provided with four
small spikes. The difficulty of crossing these valleys of ice,
<PB N="342" REF="368"/>
arises from the immense chasms. We rolled down large
stones into several of them; and the great length of time be∣fore
they reached the bottom, gave us some conception of
their depth: our guides assured us, that in some places they
are not less than five hundred feet deep. I can no otherwise
convey to you an image of this body of ice, broken into ir∣regular
ridges and deep chasms, than by comparing it to
waves instantaneously frozen in the midst of a violent storm.</P>
<P>WE began our walk with great slowness and deliberation,
but gradually gaining courage and confidence as we ad∣vanced,
we soon found that we could safely pass along those
places, where the ascent and descent were not very consider∣able,
much faster even than when walking at the rate of our
common pace: in other parts we leaped over the clefts, and slid
down the steeper descents. In one place, where we descend∣ed
and stepped across an opening upon a narrow ridge of ice
scarcely three inches broad, we were obliged to tread with
peculiar caution: for on each side were chasms of a great
depth. We walked some paces sideways along this ridge;
stept across the chasm into a little hollow, which the guides
contrived on purpose for our feet; and got up an ascent by
means of small holes which we made with the spikes of our
poles. This account appears terrible; but at the time we
had not the least apprehensions of danger, as the guides
were exceedingly careful, and took excellent precautions.
One of our servants had the courage to follow us without
<HI>crampons,</HI> and with no nails to his shoes; which was cer∣tainly
dangerous, on account of the slipperiness of the lea∣ther
when wetted.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="369"/>
WE had now almost reached the opposite side, when
being stopped by a broad chasm, we were obliged to make a
circuit of above a quarter of a mile, in order to get round it.
This will give you some idea of the difficulty attending ex∣cursions
over some of these glaciers: and our guides inform∣ed
us, that when they hunt the chamois and the marmots,
these unavoidable circuits generally carry them six or seven
miles, when the direct distance is only two miles, if they
could proceed in a strait line. A storm threatening every
moment, we were obliged to hasten off the glacier as fast as
possible: for rain renders the ice exceedingly slippery; and
in case of a fog, which generally accompanies a storm in
these upper regions, our situation would have been extreme∣ly
dangerous. And indeed we had no time to lose; for we
had scarcely quitted the ice before the tempest began, and
soon became very violent, attended with frequent flashes of
lightning, and loud peals of thunder, which being re-echoed
within the hollows of the mountains, added greatly to the
awful sublimity of the scene. We crawled for a consider∣able
way upon our hands and feet along a steep and bare
rock, and down one of the most difficult and rugged preci∣pices
I ever descended in Switzerland; the thunder at the
same time roaring over us, and rendering the rock ex∣tremely
slippery. After much difficulty, but without the
least accident, we gained the valley of Chamouny, and re∣turned
to the inn, as wet as if we had been plunged into
water; but perfectly satisfied with our expedition.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IN my second expedition to the valley of Chamouny,
in 1785, instead of crossing the glacier, I ascended, in
company with three Englishmen and a Swiss gentleman,
from Blair's Cabin, about an hour and a half, over the
bare and rugged rocks, to a summit under the <HI>Aiguille
des Charmox,</HI> near the spot from which a Genevan un∣fortunately
fell and was dashed to pieces. On this sum∣mit,
at the very edge of the fearful precipice which over∣looks
the vale of Chamouny, stood a collection of stones,
about three feet high, called by the natives <HI>le bon homme.</HI>
We immediately raised this heap to the height of six feet,
and piled up another of the same elevation, which we styled,
in the language of the country, <HI>le monument de quatre An∣glois,</HI>
in memory of the four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Whitbread, the two Mr. Cliffords, and myself. We were accompanied and assisted by M. Exchaquet, a Swiss gentleman, remarkable for his numerous expeditions into these alps.</NOTE> Englishmen who amused
themselves in forming it. I employed an hour in ascending
part of the Montanvert on horseback; the same time in
walking up to Blair's Cabin; an hour and a half to the <HI>mo∣nument
de quatre Anglois;</HI> half an hour in descending to
Blair's Cabin, and three quarters of an hour in passing from
thence to Chamouny.</P>
<P>I MADE this expedition in company with M. Exchaquet,
a Swiss gentleman, native of Aubonne, and director-general
of the mines of Savoy. His repeated expeditions into these
<PB N="345" REF="371"/>
regions have enabled him to execute a model in relief of the
valley of Chamouny, Mont Blanc, the circumjacent alps, and
glaciers. In order to render these models still more valuable
to the naturalist, he collects specimens of the different species
of stones which compose the mountains represented on the
plan. M. Exchaquet is now employed by the government of
Berne in constructing a model of the district of Aigle. M.
Exchaquet has discovered a more commodious route, than
that hitherto followed, to ascend the Buet and Mount Bre∣ven,
which are described by M. van Berchem, secretary to
the Society of Sciences at Lausanne, in his letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Excursion dans les Mines de Haut Faucigny, &amp;c. Lausanne, 1787.</NOTE> to Mr.
Wyttenbach of Berne, relating an expedition to the mines of

<HEAD TYPE="sub">EXCURSION TOWARDS THE SUMMIT OF THE
COUVERCLE.</HEAD>
<P>IN my subsequent expedition to the valley of Chamouny,
I had proposed pushing my course still further towards
the glacier of Talefre, but particularly to the Couvercle, of
which I had read a very curious description in Mr. de Saus∣sure's
work. But having hurt my foot in ascending the
Montanvert, I was prevented from executing my intended
purpose. You will, however, have no reason to regret my
disappointment, on receiving the following account of that
expedition, extracted from notes communicated by a friend.</P>
<P>WE quitted the Priory at six in the morning, accom∣panied
by Michael Paccard and Marie Coutet, two guides of
Chamouny, traversed the plain, and ascended the Montan∣vert
through a wood of pines. We had fine views of the
glacier which gives rise to the Arveron, and of the vale of
Chamouny, chequered in a most singular manner with alter∣nate
rows of arable and pasture land. After continuing
about an hour, we quitted our mules, proceeded on foot, and
in about an hour and a half reached Blair's Hut, on the top
of the Montanvert, where we rested for a few minutes. We
then descended to the glacier, coasted it by the path of the
chrystal hunters, and in about half an hour came to some
difficult passes called <HI>Les Ponts,</HI> or the Bridges, which run
<PB N="347" REF="373"/>
over a perpendicular rock, at the edge of a frightful preci∣pice.
These passages, though still difficult, were extremely
dangerous, until, by order of M. de Saussure, the rock was in
some parts blown away with gunpowder, and small holes
formed for the hands and feet. The first bridge was about
forty paces in length, and the two other passes somewhat less
difficult, of about ten paces each. In about a quarter of an
hour we arrived at a fountain which drops from the roof
and sides of a natural grotto, the inside whereof is over∣grown
with large tufts of the <HI>Ranunculus glacialis.</HI> Having
walked about eight miles since our departure from Chamou∣ny,
we sat down in this sequestered grotto, and made our
first repast.</P>
<P>FROM hence we crossed some snow, the remains of a last
winter's <HI>Avalanche,</HI> and immediately got upon the <HI>Moraine,</HI>
the term given to the stones and earth which the glaciers
disgorge on each side, after having received them from the
superimpending mountains: they are very treacherous and
difficult to walk upon. The ice upon which these stones
rest is harder than that of the rest of the glacier; and the
earth is laid in such regular and equable heaps, as to give the
appearance of art. As we looked from hence over the valley
of ice, a passage seemed impracticable; so numerous and
broad were the chasms which intersected it in every direc∣tion,
many bearing a tremendous appearance, and of an
astonishing depth: but we soon found that it only required
courage and activity. Instead of <HI>crampons,</HI> we had large
nails in our shoes, which more effectually answered our pur∣pose,
and our spiked sticks were particularly serviceable.
<PB N="348" REF="374"/>
Having descended upon the glacier, we found the ice soften∣ed
by a warm wind, which rendered it less slippery than
usual. We continued along it about a quarter of an hour,
then regained and walked along the Moraine near half an
hour. We now embarked upon the great valley of ice called
<HI>Glacier des Bois,</HI> I own not without emotion to see our∣selves
upon this extraordinary desert, broken into frightful
chasms, through the maze of which we were to pass. It
was curious to observe the numerous little rills produced by
the collection of drops occasioned by the thawing of the ice
on the upper part of the glacier: these little rills hollow out
small channels, and torrent-like precipitate themselves into
the chasms with a violent noise; increasing the body of
waters formed by the melting of the interior surface, and
finding an outlet under the immense arch of ice in the val∣ley
of Chamouny, from which the Arveron rushes. This
ice-water was agreeable to the palate, and extremely refresh∣ing
from its coolness.</P>
<P>THE field of ice, which at first sight seemed impervious
to all but the chamois and marmot, and scarcely practicable
even for the daring footsteps of man, is traversed by flocks
of sheep, driven to the scanty pasturage which the opposite
rocks afford. The shepherds leave them in these desolate
spots, and visit them at different intervals. We traced their
track over the ice, and saw a flock returning. One shepherd
preceded as a guide, and another followed the herd. We
had the good fortune to preserve one sheep which had
strayed from the flock.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="375"/>
As we were continuing our course, we were surprized
by a loud noise; and, looking round, perceived a large frag∣ment
of rock which had detached itself from one of the
highest needles: it bounded from precipice to precipice with
great rapidity, and, before it reached the bottom, was
pounded almost entirely into dust. Having proceeded about
an hour, we were astonished with a view far more magnifi∣cent
than imagination can conceive: hitherto the glaciers
had scarcely answered our expectations, but now they far
surpassed them. Nature had clad herself in all her terrors.
Before us was a valley of ice twenty miles in extent, bound∣ed
by a circular glacier of pure unbroken snow, called Tacu,
which leads directly to the foot of Mont Blanc, and is sur∣rounded
by large conical rocks, terminating in sharp points
like the towers of an ancient fortification; to the right rose
a range of magnificent peaks, their intervals filled with gla∣ciers;
and far above the rest, the majestic summit of Mont
Blanc, his highest point obscured with clouds. He appear∣ed
of such immense magnitude, that at his presence the cir∣cumjacent
mountains, however gigantic, seemed to shrink
before him, and “<HI>hide their diminished heads</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE>.” In half an
hour we arrived at the Moraine, which forms a boundary
of the valley, crossed it, and proceeded upon a body of ice
about three quarters of a mile broad. Here the ice was
more even and free from chasms than in the great valley.
We then passed a second Moraine, and beyond that another
mass of ice to a third Moraine: descending from thence, we
came upon the last ridge of ice, broader considerably than
<PB N="350" REF="376"/>
the two former, and full of large chasms: it is separated
from the rock only by a very narrow Moraine. These Mo∣raines
contain great quantities of chrystal.</P>
<P>HERE we turned a little to the right, and ascended the
valley of ice, the scene every moment increasing in magnifi∣cence
and horror. In a short time we arrived at the foot of
the Couvercle, having walked about six miles on the ice.
We now found it difficult to quit the ice; and the first part
of the descent was really perilous. One step was truly
dreadful: a bulging rock entirely smooth, and presenting a
precipice of very considerable depth, which was terminated
by an immense chasm in the ice, seemed to forbid our pro∣gress;
a small hollow, however, in the middle served for one
foot, and from thence we bounded over to the firm ground.
One guide went first, and held out his hand on the opposite
side, whilst the other helped and directed us where to place
our feet. We continued ascending a path which now seem∣ed
without danger, though very narrow and steep, and car∣ried
along the ridge of precipices. The scenery around was
indeed so sublime as to banish all ideas of fatigue and appre∣hension.
Half an hour more brought us to the side of a
fountain, where we sat down to our dinner. We had now
employed five hours and a half from Chamouny, and not∣withstanding
all difficulties and necessary halts, had walked
fifteen miles, but none of us complained of fatigue.</P>
<P>THE clouds beginning to gather, warned us to hasten to
the top of the Couvercle. From that station we had the
view of three stupendous vallies of ice, the glacier of Talefre
<PB N="351" REF="377"/>
to the left, in front that of l'Echaut, and the Tacu to the
right; all uniting in one great valley of ice called the <HI>Glacier
des Bois,</HI> which stretched under our feet, and was surround∣ed
and ornamented by the rugged needles. The dead
silence, which reigned in this place, was only interrupted by
the bounding of distant chamois, and the cries of alarm
which the marmots gave to their tribes at our approach.</P>
<P>HAVING refreshed ourselves, we proceeded to the top of
the Couvercle, a most extraordinary rock, having the ap∣pearance
of a large irregular multilateral building placed on
a mountain. The rock is granite, the ascent was laborious,
but perfectly secure. Towards its foot we found a bottle
containing the names of two Englishmen who had reached
that place about a fortnight before, and probably flattered
themselves that no stranger would go beyond them. We
wrote our names on the reverse of the paper, and carried the
bottle with us to the summit of the Couvercle. Three quar∣ters
of an hour brought us to the point, and we reached a rock
overhanging a precipice which my eyes dared not measure.
In this situation we were surprized with a thunder-storm,
which added great horror and magnificence to the scene.
We took shelter under an impending rock, and listened to
the roaring of the storm with a mixed sensation of fear and
pleasure. On reflecting in this place that we were to mea∣sure
back the same ground, and to undergo a repetition of
the same difficulties, we were not exempted from alarm: but
recollecting, that it is the duty of man to encounter some
dangers, in order to behold such glorious scenes, we from
that moment banished all apprehensions.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="378"/>
OUR view from the top of the Couvercle comprehended
the same sublime scenes we had enjoyed from its base, but
considerably heightened and enlarged; and the stupendous
extent of ice appeared like a rugged expanse of frozen sea,
bounded by the most gigantic rocks, and terminated by
Mont Blanc, the Atlas of the globe. Although we were thus
entirely enclosed between ice and snow, and barren crags,
where all vegetation might be supposed to cease; yet our
eyes reposed on a triangular rock, clothed with grass and
alpine plants, and starting up like a fertile island in the midst
of a desolate ocean. It is known by the name of the <HI>Garden,</HI>
and exhibits a curious contrast to the surrounding dreariness.
During our expeditions into the Alps, we had frequently
found occasion to remark the peculiarly deep shade of the
blue colour in the “<HI>pure Empyreal</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE>;” and to-day we were
more particulaaly affected with this circumstance. It con∣veyed
a most sublime idea of the infinity of space: the higher
we ascended, the more beautiful it seemed; and we were
informed by a person accustomed to alpine scenes, that on
considerable elevations he had frequently observed the stars
at noon-day.</P>
<P>OUR descent from these icy regions was no less fortunate
than our ascent; we reached the Priory at seven in the after∣noon,
without the least accident, and wrapt in astonishment
on the recollection of scenes, which surpass the imagination,
as much as they defy description.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO REACH THE SUMMIT OF
MONT BLANC—SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION OF
JAMES BALMA AND DR. PACCARD—OF MON∣SIEUR
DE SAUSSURE—HIS PHYSICAL OBSER∣VATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS attempts having been made to reach the
summit of Mont Blanc, as well by the guides of Cha∣mouny,
as by Messieurs de Saussure and Bourrit; a chrono∣logical
account of the principal expeditions, which have at
length terminated successfully, will not, perhaps, be un∣interesting.</P>
<P>THE first enterprize was formed by Mr. Couteran and
three guides of Chamouny, Michael Paccard, Victor Tissay,
and Marie Coutet. On the thirteenth of July 1776, these
adventurers set off from the Priory about eleven in the even∣ing.
They passed between the glaciers of Bosson and Ta∣cona;
and after having employed above fourteen hours in
mounting rugged and dangerous ascents, in crossing several
vallies of ice, and large plains of snow, they found them∣selves
upon the top next to Mont Blanc. At first sight, that
mountain appeared scarcely a league distant; but they soon
discovered that the clearness of the air, the extraordinary
whiteness of the snow, and its great height, made it seem
nearer than it was in reality: and they perceived with re∣gret,
<PB N="354" REF="380"/>
that it would require at least four hours more to reach
the summit, even supposing it practicable. But as the day
was far advanced, and the vapours towards the summit of
Mont Blanc began to gather into clouds, they were obliged
to relinquish their enterprize. As they were returning
in great haste, one of the party slipped in attempting to leap
over a chasm of ice. He held in his hand a long pole, spiked
with iron, which he had struck into the ice; and upon this
he hung dreadfully suspended for a few moments, until he
was released by his companions. The danger he had just
escaped, made such an impression upon him, that he fainted
away, and continued for some time in that situation: he was
at length brought to himself, and, though considerably
bruised, sufficiently recovered to be able to continue his
journey. They arrived at Chamouny about eight that
evening, after having employed two-and-twenty hours: as
some sort of recompence for so much fatigue, they enjoyed
the satisfaction, at least, of having approached nearer to
Mont Blanc than any former adventurers.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to Sir George Schuckborough, the summit to
which they arrived is more than 13,000 feet above the Medi∣terranean.
These persons, however, did not take the neces∣sary
precautions for so perilous an enterprize: for the expe∣dition
was not only extremely hazardous, but was also far
too fatiguing and difficult to be accomplished within twenty-four
hours. They ought to have set out in the morning,
and to have found some proper place in which they might
pass the night, they would then have been sufficiently re∣freshed
the next morning to pursue their expedition; and
<PB N="355" REF="381"/>
would not have found themselves, after advancing within four
hours of Mont Blanc, unable to proceed, and in danger of being
overtaken by darkness in so dreary a situation. The failure
of this expedition seemed for some time to repress all future
attempts to attain the top of Mont Blanc, until the indefati∣gable
Mr. Bourrit infused a new spirit into the inhabitants
of Chamouny. After reiterated though unsuccessful at∣tempts,
on the 11th of September 1784, Mr. Bourrit, accom∣panied
by six guides, departed from Bionasay; and was <HI>sca∣ling,</HI>
as he expresses himself, the <HI>rampart</HI> of Mont Blanc,
when he suddenly found himself so extremely affected by
the intense cold, that he was unable to proceed.</P>
<P>MARIE COUTET and Francis Guidet, two of the guides
who attended him in this expedition, had preceded their
company, and ascended to the Dome of Goutè, which is
about 9,400 feet in a strait horizontal direction from the
summit. Marie Coutet informed me, that they passed the Mid∣dle
Dome, and walked along the ridge between that dome and
the summit as far as some high rocks, which appear from
the vale of Chamouny like small points rising out of the
snow; but night approaching, obliged them to return. On
the 4th of September 1785, Marie Coutet and James Lambat
reached a place under a rock at a considerable elevation,
where they passed the night. Setting off before sun-rise,
found themselves about seven on the Dome of Goutè; and
were proceeding towards the summit, with a fair prospect of
success, when a violent storm of hail ensued, accompanied
with such a strong wind, as compelled them to return.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="382"/>
ON the 13th of September, Messieurs de Saussure and
Bourrit, attended by twelve guides well provided with baro∣meters,
thermometers, and other instruments, for the pur∣pose
of making the necessary observations, departed from
Bionasay, and arrived at a hut, which they had ordered to be
constructed at <HI>Pierre Ronde</HI> 7,808 feet above the level of the
sea. Here they passed the night, and early the next morn∣ing
reached the Dome of Goutè without the least accident,
and without much difficulty; where they were stopped by
a fresh fall of snow, into which they sunk so deep, that all
farther progress was impracticable. Mr. de Saussure informs
us, that the mercury in the barometer sunk eighteen inches
and a half, and that he reached an elevation of 1,290 toises,
or 8,256 English feet.</P>
<P>AT length, in July 1786, six guides of Chamouny having
failed in another attempt, James Balma, one of the party, be∣ing
overtaken by darkness, as he was rambling upon the ice,
missed his way, and passed the night in a spot above the
Dome of Goutè, elevated more than 12,000 feet above the
level of the sea. His youth, and the strength of his consti∣tution,
having preserved him from the effects of the noctur∣nal
cold in so severe an atmosphere, at the approach of morn
he reconnoitered the situation, and observed a part which
appeared to him more easy of access than any of the others
that had been hitherto attempted. On his arrival at Cha∣mouny
he was seized with a very severe indisposition, the
effect of extreme fatigue, and of the intense cold. Being at∣tended
by Doctor Paccard, a physician of the place, James
Balma communicated his observations; and, in gratitude for
<PB N="357" REF="383"/>
his attendance, offered to conduct him to the summit of
Mont Blanc.</P>
<P>ON the 7th of August, these two daring adventurers sal∣lied
from Chamouny upon this memorable expedition, and
reached before dark the mountain of <HI>La Cote,</HI> which over∣hangs
the upper part of the glacier of Bosson. Here they
passed the night; and at three in the morning pursued their
route over the ice, ascended the Dome of Goutè, passed under
the Middle Dome, and at the last pyramid of rock turned to
the east, and continued along the ridge, which is seen from
Geneva, and lies on the left of the summit. Here they first
began to experience such intense cold, and such extreme fa∣tigue,
that Dr. Paccard was almost induced to relinquish the
enterprize: being, however, encouraged by James Balma,
more accustomed to such fatiguing and dangerous expedi∣tions,
he followed his companion. The wind was so violent
and piercing, that in order to avoid its blowing in their faces,
they were obliged to walk sideways for a considerable time.
About six in the afternoon, they at length attained the sum∣mit
of Mont Blanc; and stood triumphantly on a spot of
ground, which no one had reached before, and at the ele∣vation
of 15,662 feet above the sea, which is undoubtedly
the highest point in the antient globe. They remained on
the summit no more than half an hour, the cold being so
intense, that the provision was frozen in their pockets, the
ink congealed in their inkhorns; and the mercury in Fah∣renheit's
thermometer sunk to 18 ½ degrees. Doctor Paccard
had just time to observe the state of the barometer, which he
has not communicated to the public.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="384"/>
THEY had employed fifteen hours in ascending; and
though they again reached the mountain of La Cote in five
hours, yet they found great difficulty in descending, their
sight being debilitated by the reflection from the snow.
They arrrived at La Cote about midnight, after twenty
hours unremitted fatigue. Having reposed themselves two
hours, they again sallied forth, and returned to Chamouny
at eight in the morning. Their faces were excoriated, and
their lips exceedingly swelled; Dr. Paccard was almost blind,
and his eyes continued to be affected for a considerable time.
We cannot expect any accurate experiments from these two
persons, to whom the glory of having first ascended the
summit of Mont Blanc is undoubtedly due. But they pre∣pared
the way for the observations and discoveries of fu∣ture
naturalists, and particularly of M. de Saussure, whose
indefatigable zeal did not permit him to rest, until he had
reached the top of Mont Blanc, and made those experiments
which cannot fail greatly to elucidate the theory of the
atmosphere.</P>
<P>THAT able naturalist set out on this successful expedition,
from the valley of Chamouny, on the 13th of August 1787.
He was accompanied by eighteen guides, who carried a tent,
matrasses, all necessary accommodations, and instruments of
experimental philosophy. They passed the first night on
the top of the mountain of La Cote, in a hut previously
constructed for that purpose. At four o'clock in the follow∣ing
afternoon they reached an elevation of 9,312 feet above
the Priory, or 12,762 above the level of the sea. Here they
encamped, and formed an excavation in the congealed snow,
<PB N="359" REF="385"/>
which they covered with a tent. In this icy habitation,
instead of suffering from the cold, M. de Saussure felt such
a suffocating heat, from the closeness of the tent, and the
number of persons crouded in so small a compass, that he
was frequently obliged to go into the open air in order to
breathe.</P>
<P>THE next morning the whole company departed at
seven; and found the ascent in some places so steep, that the
guides who preceded were obliged to hew out steps with a
hatchet. At eleven they reached the summit of Mont Blanc.
Here they continued three hours and a half, during which
time M. de Saussure enjoyed, with rapture and astonishment,
a view the most extensive as well as the most rugged and
sublime in nature; and made those observations which
will render this expedition no longer a matter of mere cu∣riosity.
Until a complete and ample detail of those obser∣vations
shall be communicated to the public, you will per∣haps
not be displeased with the following particulars selected
from a temporary publication of M. de Saussure himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A translation of this account, by the Rev. Mr. Martyn, professor of botany in the university of Cambridge, printed by Kearsley, forms an Appendix to his Sketch of a Tour through Switzerland, which I would recommend to the traveller.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE did not find the cold so extremely piercing as was
experienced by Dr. Paccard and James Balma. By compa∣ring
his experiments on Mont Blanc with those made at the
same time by M. Senebier at Geneva, he was enabled to
make the following observations. Reaumur's thermometer
stood in the shade at 2<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>10</SUB> below freezing point, or 27 of
<PB N="360" REF="386"/>
Fahrenheit; at Geneva at 22. 6, or 82 of Fahrenheit, which
gives a difference of near 25 degrees of Reaumur, or 45 of
Fahrenheit, between the state of the atmosphere at both
places. De Luc's barometer fell to 16. 0 <SUP>1</SUP><SUB>1</SUB> <SUP>4</SUP><SUB>0</SUB> <SUP>4</SUP><SUB>0</SUB>, and as it stood
at Geneva at 27. 2 <SUP>1</SUP><SUB>1</SUB> <SUP>0</SUP><SUB>6</SUB> <SUP>8</SUP><SUB>0</SUB> <SUP>5</SUP><SUB>0</SUB>, it gives a difference of 11. 2, without
regarding the fraction. On estimating the height of Mont
Blanc from barometrical experiments, he found it almost
exactly correspond with that given by Sir George Schuck∣borough,
or 15,662 English feet above the level of the sea,
and which reflects the highest honour on the accuracy of the
English observer.</P>
<P>BY experiments with the hygrometer, the air on the top
of Mont Blanc contained six times less humidity than that
of Geneva; and to this extreme dryness of the atmosphere,
he imputes the burning thirst which he and his compa∣nions
experienced. It requires half an hour to boil water on
the top of Mont Blanc, fifteen or sixteen minutes are suffi∣cient
at Geneva, and fourteen or fifteen by the sea-side. By
experiments on the electrometer, the balls diverged only
three lines; the electricity was positive. On the summit he
noticed two butterflies on the wing; observed, at the eleva∣tion
of 11,392 feet above the sea, the <HI>Silene Acaulis,</HI> or moss
campion, in flower; and still higher up, on the most ele∣vated
rocks, the <HI>Lichen Sulphureus</HI> and <HI>Lichen Rupestris</HI> of
Hoffman. He adds, that the summits of Mont Blanc and the
adjacent mountains are composed of granite; and that, next
to Mont Blanc, the Schreckhorn and Mount Rosa in Pied∣mont,
appeared the most elevated points. M. de Saussure,
as well as many of his party, found themselves extremely
<PB N="361" REF="387"/>
affected by the rarefaction of the air; and at two began re∣turning.
They descended a little lower than the place in
which they passed the preceding night, arrived the next
morning at the valley of Chamouny without the least acci∣dent,
and, as they had taken the precaution to cover their
faces with crape, their skins were not excoriated, nor their
sight debilitated.</P>
<P>ON the eighth of August, a few days after M. de Saus∣sure's
expedition, Mr. Beaufoy, an English gentleman, suc∣ceeded
in a similar attempt, though it was attended with
greater difficulty, arising from the enlargement of the
chasms in the ice. An account of this expedition was read
before the Royal Society on the 13th of December 1787, and
will probably be communicated to the public.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">CONJECTURES ON THE FORMATION AND STATE OF
THE GLACIERS.</HEAD>
<P>NO subject in natural history is more curious than the
origin of these glaciers, extending into fields of corn
and pasture, and lying, without being melted, in a situation,
where the sun is sufficient to bring vegetation to maturity:
for it is almost literally true, that with one hand I could
touch ice, and the other ripe corn. As in my first expedition
to the alps my stay was exceedingly short, I declined en∣tering
upon a subject too important to be superficially treated,
and only threw together a few hasty remarks, which oc∣curred
to me on the spot. But I find that these remarks,
however hasty and superficial, served to excite your curiosity;
and have induced you to inquire, “<HI>Which is the most ra∣tional
system concerning the formation of the glaciers? Are
they in a state of augmentation or diminution; or do they re∣main
within the same limits?</HI>” Although in my subsequent
journeys to the alps I made this subject a particular object of
research; and although I have attentively perused the prin∣cipal
systems, which have been laid down concerning the for∣mation
of glaciers; yet it is not without great dissidence, that
I can presume to reply to your very arduous questions.</P>
<P>THE theory of Gruner, confirmed and amended by that
able naturalist M. de Saussure, appears the most simple and
rational; and I do not know how I can better satisfy your
curiosity, than by forming an extract from his much
<PB N="363" REF="389"/>
esteemed work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyages des Alps, v. i. c. 7.</NOTE>, interspersing it with a few additional re∣marks
drawn from my own particular observations.</P>
<P>IF a person could be conveyed to such an elevation as to
embrace at one view the alps of Switzerland, Savoy, and Dau∣phiné,
he would behold a vast chain of mountains, intersected
by numerous vallies, and composed of many parallel chains,
the highest occupying the center, and the others gradually
diminishing in proportion to their distance from that center.
The most elevated, or central chain, would appear bristled
with pointed rocks, and covered, even in summer, with ice and
snow, in all parts that are not absolutely perpendicular. On
each side of this chain he would discover deep vallies clothed
with verdure, peopled with numerous villages, and watered
by many rivers. In considering these objects with greater
attention, he would remark, that the central chain is com∣posed
of elevated peaks and diverging ridges, whose sum∣mits
are overspread with snow; that the declivities of the
peaks and ridges, excepting those parts that are extremely
steep, are covered with snow and ice; and that the interme∣diate
depths and spaces between them are filled with immense
fields of ice, terminating in those cultivated vallies which
border the great chain. The branches most contiguous to
the central chain would present the same phenomena, only
in a lesser degree. At greater distances no ice would be ob∣served,
and scarcely any snow, but upon some of the most ele∣vated
summits; and the mountains diminishing in height
and ruggedness, would appear covered with herbage, and
gradually sink into hills and plains.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="390"/>
IN this general survey, the glaciers may be divided into
two sorts; the first occupying the deep vallies situated in the
bosom of the alps, and termed by the natives <HI>Vallées de Glace,</HI>
but which I shall distinguish by the name of <HI>Lower Glaciers;</HI>
the second, which clothe the summits and sides of the moun∣tains,
I shall call <HI>Upper Glaciers.</HI></P>
<P>1. THE Lower Glaciers are by far the most considerable
in extent and depth. Some stretch several leagues in length;
that of des Bois in particular is more than fifteen miles long,
and above three in its greatest breadth. The Lower Glaciers
do not, as is generally imagined, communicate with each
other; and but few of them are parallel to the central chain:
they mostly stretch in a transverse direction, are bordered at
the higher extremity by inaccessible rocks, and on the other
extend into the cultivated vallies. The thickness of the ice
varies in different parts. M. de Saussure found its gene∣ral
depth in the glacier des Bois from eighty to a hun∣dred
feet; but questions not the information of those who
assert, that in some places its thickness exceeds even six hun∣dred
feet.</P>
<P>THESE immense fields of ice usually rest on an inclined
plain: being pushed forwards by the pressure of their own
weight, and but weakly supported by the rugged rocks be∣neath,
are intersected by large transverse chasms; and pre∣sent
the appearance of walls, pyramids, and various fantastic
shapes, observed at all heights and in all situations, wherever
the declivity exceeds thirty or forty degrees. But in those
parts, where the plain on which they rest is horizontal, or
only gently inclined, the surface of the ice is nearly uni∣form;
<PB N="365" REF="391"/>
the chasms are but few and narrow, and the traveller
crosses on foot, without much difficulty.</P>
<P>THE surface of the ice is not so slippery as that of frozen
ponds or rivers: it is rough and granulated, and is only dan∣gerous
to the passenger in steep descents. It is not transpa∣rent,
is extremely porous and full of small bubbles, which
seldom exceed the size of a pea, and consequently is not so
compact as common ice: its perfect resemblance to the con∣gelation
of snow impregnated with water, in its opacity,
roughness, and in the number and smallness of the air-bubbles,
led M. de Saussure to conceive the following simple
and natural theory on the formation of the glaciers. An im∣mense
quantity of snow is continually accumulating in the
elevated vallies which are enclosed within the alps, as well
from that which falls from the clouds during nine months
in the year, as from the masses which are incessantly rolling
from the steep sides of the circumjacent mountains. Part of
this snow, which is not dissolved during summer, impreg∣nated
with rain and snow-water, is frozen during winter,
and forms that opaque and porous ice of which the Lower
Glaciers are composed.</P>
<P>2. THE Upper Glaciers may be subdivided into those
which cover the summit, and those which extend along the
sides of the alps.</P>
<P>THOSE which cover the summits of the alps, owe their
origin to the snow that falls at all seasons of the year, and
which remains nearly in its original state, being congealed
into a hard substance, and not converted into ice. For al∣though,
<PB N="366" REF="392"/>
according to the opinion of some philosophers, the
summit of Mont Blanc, and of other elevated mountains, is,
from the glistening of the surface, supposed to be covered
with pure ice; yet it appears, both from theory and expe∣rience,
that it is not ice but snow. For, in so elevated and
cold a region, there cannot be melted a quantity of snow
sufficient to impregnate with water the whole mass, which
remains undissolved. Experience also justifies this reasoning.
M. de Saussure found the top of Mont Blanc only encrusted
with ice, which, though of a firm consistence, was yet penetra∣ble
with a stick; and on the declivities of the summit he disco∣vered,
beneath the surface, a soft snow without coherence.</P>
<P>THE substance which clothes the sides of the alps is nei∣ther
pure snow like that of the summits, nor ice which
forms the Lower Glaciers, but is an assemblage of both. It
contains less snow than the summits, because the summer
heat has more power to dissolve it, and because the liquefied
snow descending from above, the mass is penetrated with a
larger quantity of water. It contains more snow than the
Lower Glaciers, because the dissolution of the snow is com∣paratively
lesser. Hence the ice is even more porous,
opaque, and less compact than the ice of the Lower Glaciers;
and is of so doubtful a texture as renders it, in many parts,
difficult to decide, whether it may be called ice or frozen
snow. In a word, there is a regular gradation from the snow
on the summits to the ice of the Lower Glaciers, formed by
the intermediate mixture of snow and ice, which becomes
more compact and less porous in proportion as it approaches
the Lower Glaciers, until it unites and assimilates with them.
And it is evident, that the greater or lesser degree of density
<PB N="367" REF="393"/>
is derived from the greater or lesser quantity of water, with
which the mass is impregnated.</P>
<P>IN regard to your second question, “<HI>Whether the glaciers
are in a state of increase or diminution,</HI>” though I declined
on a former occasion to enter minutely upon a subject,
which required much accurate observation and repeated ex∣perimental
investigation; yet I ventured to make one re∣mark,
which seemed to prove the occasional increase and dimi∣nution
of the glaciers; contrary to the opinion of some philo∣sophers,
who maintain, that they continue always the same,
and of others, who assert, that they are constantly increasing.</P>
<P>THE borders of the glacier of Montanvert, are mostly
skirted with trees: towards its base a vast arch of ice rises
near a hundred feet in height; under which the Arveron
rushes with considerable force, and in a large body of water.
As we approached the ice, we passed through a wood of firs:
those trees which stand at a little distance from the arch are
about eighty feet high, and are undoubtedly of a very great
age. Between these and the glacier, the trees are of a later
growth; as is evident from their texture and inferior size.
Others, still smaller, have been overturned and enveloped
in the ice: there seems to be a kind of regular gradation in
the age of these several trees, from the largest which are
standing to the smallest that lie prostrate. These facts justly
lead to the following conclusions:—that the glacier once ex∣tended
as far as the row of tall firs; that, upon its gradual
dissolution, a number of trees shot up in the very spots
which it formerly occupied; that, since that period, the ice
has again advanced; and has overturned the trees of later
<PB N="368" REF="394"/>
growth, before they had attained considerable height. To
these circumstances, the following fact may be added.
Large stones of granite are usually found at a small distance
from the extremities of the glacier. These stones have cer∣tainly
fallen from the mountains upon the ice, have been
carried on in its progress, and have tumbled into the plain
upon the dissolution or sinking of the ice which supported
them. These stones, called by the inhabitants <HI>Moraine,</HI> form
a kind of border towards the foot of the valley of ice, and
have been pushed forward by the glacier in its advances: they
extend even to the place occupied by the larger pines.</P>
<P>AS several writers upon Switzerland have, in contradic∣tion
to these facts, endeavoured to prove, that the snow and
ice are continually accumulating in the alps, I shall here
throw together a few additional remarks, that may tend to
confirm the contrary opinion.</P>
<P>THE Inferior Glacier of Grindelwald was so considerably
diminished since my first expedition in 1776, that the spot
which its extremity then occupied was, in 1785, removed at
least four hundred paces from its former site. In the val∣ley
of Chamouny, the <HI>Murailles de Glace,</HI> which I described
as forming the border of the glacier of Bosson, no longer ex∣isted;
and young trees had shot up in the parts which
were then covered by the glacier of Montanvert.</P>
<P>THE advocates for the increase of the glaciers, admitting
these facts, yet deny that any judgment can be formed con∣cerning
the state of the more elevated regions, from what
passes in the vallies, where the sun has power to bring the
<PB N="369" REF="395"/>
fruits of the earth to maturity. They assert that it appears,
both from theory and fact, that more snow falls, and more ice
is annually formed in the alps than can be annually dissolved.
To judge from theory; they argue, that the cold occasioned
by the mass of ice already formed ought to augment it still
further; and in regard to experience, it is evident, that within
the memory of the present generation, many mountains
have been covered, many pastures and habitations invaded,
and many passages irrecoverably obstructed by the ice.</P>
<P>IN considering the arguments drawn from theory, we
may observe, that the causes which tend to the diminution
of the ice, are no less powerful than the augmentation of the
cold, which is supposed to occasion its indefinite increase.
These causes are principally; 1. rain and sleet in the less ele∣vated
regions; 2. evaporation; 3. descent of the snow and
ice, both precipitous and gradual; 4. heat of the atmo∣sphere;
5. mean temperature of the earth.</P>
<P>1. THE rain and sleet, which fall during summer upon
the Lower Glaciers, not only thaw the ice, but increase those
rills that collect on the surface, excavate channels, descend
into the clefts, and assist in forming them. 2. Evaporation
is a still more powerful cause; as it acts at all heights, and in
all seasons. 3. The descent of the snow and ice, as distin∣guished
by precipitous and gradual. The precipitous, or
continual fallings of congealed snow, termed by the natives
<HI>avalanches,</HI> are detached either by their own weight, soften∣ed
from their hold by the heat of the sun or the warm air
which blows from the south, or overthrown by the violent
hurricanes that are extremely common in the upper alps.
<PB N="370" REF="396"/>
When these masses are precipitated into a milder region,
though they may sometimes indeed resist the influence of
heat, and form valleys of ice, yet they are more usually dis∣solved.
These <HI>avalanches</HI> are most common in the Upper
Glaciers; whereas the gradual descent of the ice is chiefly
confined to the Lower Glaciers, and is a very powerful agent
in lessening the aggregate mass.</P>
<P>ALL the Lower Glaciers, or vallies of ice, rest on an in∣clined
plain, are arched or hollow, and are undermined and
weakened by the torrents, which are constantly flowing, as
well from the Upper Glaciers, as from their own interior
surface. The natural tendency of a heavy body in such a
position is to descend; and its progressive motion is accele∣rated
in proportion to its own weight, and the greater incli∣nation
of its basis. This progressive motion, which acts,
though imperceptibly, yet gradually and uniformly, carries
the ice into those cultivated plains and vallies, where the sun
ripens the fruits of the field; and where a period is neces∣sarily
put to its farther increase. If you require a proof of
this imperceptible descent, the answer is obvious. It is to be
collected from the facts which I have already enumerated;
namely, from the trees which are occasionally overturned by
the ice in its progress, and by the moraine of stones which is
observed at the bottom of the Lower Glaciers. These stones
being similar to the mountains of the upper alps, and essen∣tially
different from the rocks below, must have been con∣veyed
by the ice in its descent from the Upper Glaciers.</P>
<P>4. THE heat of the atmosphere, or the effect of the sun's
rays on the outward surface of the glaciers, is too evident to
<PB N="371" REF="397"/>
require any proof, even to those who have never been in the
Alps. Another cause of a thaw, derived from the heat of the
atmosphere, which will not be suspected by those who have
not visited these icy regions, is the warm winds which blow
by night as well as by day in the Upper no less than in the
Lower Glaciers. These warm winds are, during summer,
so common in these parts, that I never crossed a glacier with∣out
feeling, in some particular positions, a warmth similar to
the air of a hot-bath.</P>
<P>5. BUT as these two causes only operate in summer; and
as the sun's rays do not produce sufficient effect in the high∣est
parts, we must have recourse to the mean temperature of
the earth, which seems to be the greatest and most powerful
agent in preventing an indefinite augmentation of ice and
snow. This mean temperature, termed by some philoso∣phers
the internal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some philosophers impute this constant thaw, which takes place in the lower sur∣face of the glaciers, to an internal source of heat in the earth; but that opinion has been very ably refuted by several modern natu∣ralists; the mean temperature of the ground being sound sufficient to account for <HI>all</HI> the phenomena, local circumstances excepted, which have been usually assigned to an inter∣nal heat of the earth.</NOTE> heat of the earth, is always above the
freezing point, as is evident from the heat of the springs
which issue from the bowels of the earth. In winter, there∣fore,
or in those high regions of the globe where the cold is
usually below the freezing point, when any spot of ground is
covered with only a thin coat of snow, it may be so far cool∣ed,
to a certain depth, by the influence of the external air, as
not to be capable of dissolving any part of the surperincum∣bent
snow. But when the mass of snow is of such a thick∣ness
<PB N="372" REF="398"/>
as to protect the surface of the ground from the effects
of the atmospherical cold, the mean temperature, which is
always above the freezing point, will be sufficient to melt
the contiguous surface of snow, and to occasion a constant
thaw, which supplies those currents of water, that flow, at
all seasons, from the Upper and Lower Glaciers.</P>
<P>IN regard to the argument derived from experience, it is
sufficient to observe, that while I admit the facts which
prove the progress of the ice, it by no means seems to follow
that its sum is perpetually increasing. For the advocates
who support this opinion, while they scrupulously enume∣rate
the places which have been invaded by the ice, do not
take any notice of those parts, no less numerous, from which
the ice has receded. During my second expedition into the
Alps, I also made this point of controversy a particular object
of my researches; and on inquiring from the <HI>chasseurs,</HI> and
other persons who frequent the mountains, the greatest part
were of opinion that the collection of ice and snow, even in
the elevated regions, was by no means in a continual state of
augmentation; but that while it gained in some places it di∣minished
in others; and that upon an average, the aggregate
quantity was nearly the same.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 41.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ACCOUNT OF THE BOUQUETIN, OR MOUNTAIN-GOAT.</HEAD>
<P>I OBSERVED at Michael Paccard's, a guide of Chamouny, a
head and horns of the male <HI>bouquetin,</HI> or mountain-goat,
and stuffed specimens of a female and a young one. As this
animal is extremely rare, and inhabits the highest and almost
inaccessible mountains, the descriptions of it have been very
inaccurate and confused. But a new light has been lately
thrown on the subject by Dr. Girtanner of St. Gallen, and by
M. van Berchem, secretary to the Society of Sciences at Lau∣sanne;
and although these two naturalists differ in some in∣stances,
yet their joint labours have assisted in ascertaining
the nature and oeconomy of this curious animal. The fol∣lowing
account, therefore, of the bouquetin, is drawn prin∣cipally
from their observations in Rozier's Journal, and from
additional information obligingly communicated to me by
M. van Berchem.</P>
<P>THE elder naturalists speak of the bouquetin as of an ani∣mal
well known, and in their time by no means uncommon
<PB N="374" REF="401"/>
on the high alps of Switzerland, especially in the canton of
Glarus and in the country of the Grisons. On the town-hall
at Glarus, there is still a pair of horns of an extraordi∣nary
length, belonging to an animal of this species, for∣merly
killed in the canton. These horns are probably
the same which Ray saw in the last century, when the
natives informed him, that the breed was extinct in that
canton.</P>
<P>THAT this animal was found among the Grisons, appears
from a letter in the possession of M. de Salis Seervis, dated
the 14th of October, 1574, in which the Archduke Ferdinand
of Austria requires from his bailif of Castels, in the Pretigau,
two bouquetins alive; adding, that he had received several
from his predecessors. About forty years after the date of
this letter the animal began to be rare; for a decree in the
year 1612 prohibits the chace of the bouquetin under a fine
of fifty crowns, and that of the chamois from New-year's
day to St. John, under the penalty of ten crowns. Sprecher,
in his <HI>Pallas Rhetica,</HI> published in 1617, relates, that the chace
of the bouquetin was not uncommon in his time, in the val∣lies
of Pregalia, Vals, and Upper Engadina. Another law of
1633, confirmed in the following year, inflicts corporal pu∣nishment
on those who kill a bouquetin. But these severi∣ties
could not preserve the breed; and it is probable that
this was the epoch of their destruction, when the fear of
their being extinct prompted government to forbid the
<PB N="375" REF="402"/>
chace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Franciscus Niger, in his description of the Grisons, as quoted by Conrad Gesner, says, that they spare this animal in hunting, because it is the armorial bearing of the country.
<Q><L>“Parcitur hic Capricorne tamen tibi, Panos amice,</L>
<L>Arma quod exornes, et pulchra insignia gentis,</L>
<L>Hinc longam hinc vitam vivens, ingentia jactas</L>
<L>Cornua, perque plicas rugosa, repandaque in armos,</L>
<L>Formosusque nigris villis in montibus erras.”</L></Q></NOTE>. And it is certain, that within the memory of the
present generation, no bouquetins have been found in a wild
state in the country of the Grisons.</P>
<P>THIS animal is now chiefly found upon that chain which
stretches from Dauphiné through Savoy to the confines of
Italy, and principally on the alps bordering on Mont Blanc,
which is the most elevated part of that chain. Its particular
haunts are the valley of Cormayor to the south of Mont
Blanc, those heights which lie between Mont Blanc and the
frontiers of the Vallais, and the mountains which border the
Val Saverenche; but it is met with more abundantly in the
mountains of the valley of Cogne, which is the frontier of
the valley of Dent in Piedmont; and almost always frequents
those parts that have a southern aspect.</P>
<P>THE several names by which the bouquetin is known in
different languages, are, in Greek, by Homer and Aelian, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Most naturalists affirm that Homer calls this animal <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, whereas he stiles it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the wild-goat, adding the epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or wanton. Iliad <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, v. 105.</NOTE>; Latin, <HI>Ibex,</HI> which name has been adopted by most
modern naturalists; Italian, <HI>Capra Selvatica;</HI> German and
<PB N="376" REF="403"/>
Swiss, <HI>Steinboch,</HI> or Rock-goat, the female, <HI>Etagne,</HI> or <HI>Ybschen</HI>
and <HI>Ybschgeiss,</HI> perhaps from the Latin Ibex; Flemish, <HI>Wild∣gheit;</HI>
French, <HI>Bouquetin,</HI> antiently <HI>Bouc-estain,</HI> the German
name reversed. Belon named it <HI>Hircus ferus;</HI> Brisson, <HI>Hir∣cus
Ibex;</HI> Linnaeus, <HI>Capra Ibex;</HI> Pennant, the <HI>Ibex;</HI> and
Dr. Girtanner, <HI>Capra Alpina.</HI> I have adopted the name of
Bouquetin, because it is the provincial appellation of the ani∣mal
in the Alps. The systematic naturalists agree in taking
the specific character of the bouquetin from the beard, and
the horns, which they describe as knobbed along the upper
or anterior surface, and reclining towards the back.</P>
<P>THE male bouquetin is larger than the tame goat, but re∣sembles
it much in the outer form. The head is small in
proportion to the body, with the muzzle thick, compressed,
and a little arched. The eyes are large, round, and have
much sire and brilliancy. The horns large, when of a full
size weighing sometimes 16 or 18 pounds, flatted before and
rounded behind, with one or two longitudinal, and many
transverse ridges; which degenerate towards the tip into
knobs; the colour dusky brown. The beard long, tawny,
or dusky. The legs slender, with the hoofs short, hollow on
the inside, and on the outside terminated by a salient border,
like those of the chamois. The body short, thick, and
strong. The tail short, naked underneath, the rest covered
with long hairs, white at the base and sides, black above and
at the end. Space under the tail in some tawny, in others
white. The coat long, but not pendent, ash coloured, mixed
with some hoary hairs: a black list runs along the back; and
<PB N="377" REF="404"/>
there is a black spot above and below the knees. Its colour,
however, like that of other animals, must necessarily vary ac∣cording
to its age and local circumstances.</P>
<P>THE female has been little noticed among naturalists.
She is one-third less than the male, and not so corpulent:
her colour is less tawny: her horns are very small and not
above eight inches long. In these, and in her figure, she re∣sembles
a goat that has been castrated whilst young. She

beard, unless, perhaps, in an advanced age. The young
ones are of a dirty grey colour, and the list along the back is

<P>THOSE in the second and third columns certainly belong
to the bouquetin of the alps. Their colour is a dusky
brown. The first of these is very flat before; the second is
not so flat; neither the longitudinal nor transverse ridges
are so very strongly marked: these are evidently the horns
<PB N="379" REF="406"/>
of a very old animal. The horns in the fourth column
belong also to the bouquetin; but probably from some other
country. Their colour is black; they are much flatter on
the sides, and narrower before than the others; the longitu∣dinal
ridge is very strongly marked, and the transverse
ridges stronger and more numerous. I cannot observe more
than one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Most naturalists affirm, that the horns are marked with <HI>two</HI> longitudinal ridges; all those that have fallen under my obser∣vation have only <HI>one</HI> interior longitudinal ridge, and a faint mark on the exterior edge, which is probably taken for the <HI>second</HI> lon∣gitudinal ridge.</NOTE> longitudinal ridge in any of the horns which I
have examined, the exterior part of the front being univer∣sally
rounded off, and the transverse ridges run very little
into the sides. The horns in the fifth column belong un∣questionably
to the Aegagrus of Pallas, which is not impro∣bably
a variety of the bouquetin. Two fine pairs of these
horns were given to the Museum by the late duke of Nor∣thumberland.
They have no anterior flat face, but a sharp
ridge, with a few knobs in front, about nine in number, and
very distant from each other; they are streaked transversely,
more evidently towards the end. Their extremities are
much arched, with the points turning inwards. The colour
is the same with those of the alpine bouquetins.</P>
<P>IT is a common notion of the hunters, adopted by many
naturalists, that the age of a bouquetin may be estimated by
the number of transverse ridges or knobs in the horns. M.
van Berchem, however, assures me, from his own observa∣tions,
that this is a vulgar error; and that its age can only
be ascertained by the number and form of the teeth, as in
<PB N="380" REF="407"/>
sheep and goats. This mistake has also occasioned its term
of life to be supposed much longer than it really is. This
animal increases in bulk to the age of four years; according,
therefore, to the system of the Count de Buffon, that the
age is about seven times the growth, its life is twenty-eight
or thirty years.</P>
<P>IN a state of tranquillity, the bouquetin commonly car∣ries
the head low; but in running holds it high, and
even bends it a little forward. He mounts a perpendicular
rock of fifteen feet at three leaps, or rather three suc∣cessive
bounds of five feet each. It does not seem as if he
found any footing on the rock, appearing to touch it merely
to be repelled, like an elastic substance striking against a hard
body. He is not supposed to take more than three successive
leaps in this manner. If he is between two rocks which
are near each other, and wants to reach the top, he leaps
from the side of one rock to the other alternately, till he has
attained the summit. He also traverses the glaciers with
rapidity; but only when pursued, for otherwise he avoids
them.</P>
<P>THE bouquetins feed, during the night, in the highest
woods: but the sun no sooner begins to gild the summits,
than they quit the woody region, and mount, feeding in
their progress, till they have reached the most considerable
heights. They betake themselves to the sides of the moun∣tains
which face the east or south, and lie down in the highest
places and hottest exposures: but when the sun has finished
more than three-quarters of its course, they again begin to
<PB N="381" REF="408"/>
feed, and to descend towards the woods; whither they retire
when it is likely to snow, and where they always pass the
winter. The bouquetins assemble in flocks, consisting at the
most of ten, twelve, or fifteen; but more usually in smaller
numbers. The males which are six years old and upwards,
haunt more elevated places than the females and younger
bouquetins; and as they advance in age are less fond of
society; they become gradually hardened against the effects
of extreme cold, and frequently live entirely alone.</P>
<P>IN summer they feed principally on the <HI>genipi</HI> and other
aromatic plants which grow in the high alps; and in
winter they eat the lichens, and brouse on bushes and the
tender shoots of trees. They prefer those spots where the
dwarf birch and alpine willows grow, and where <HI>rhododen∣dron,
thalictrum,</HI> and <HI>saxifrages,</HI> abound. The bouquetins
having their fore legs somewhat shorter than the hind legs,
naturally ascend with greater facility than they descend;
for this reason nothing but the severest weather can engage
them to come down into the lower regions; and even in
winter, if there are a few fine days, they leave the woods
and mount higher.</P>
<P>WINTER is the season of love with them, and principally
the month of January. The females go with young five
months, and consequently produce in the last week of June,
or the first of July. At the time of parturition they separate
from the males, retire to the side of some rill, and generally
bring forth only one young, though some naturalists affirm
that they occasionally produce two. The common cry of
<PB N="382" REF="409"/>
the bouquetin is a short sharp whistle, not unlike that of the
chamois, but of less continuance: sometimes it makes a
snort, and when young bleats.</P>
<P>THE season for hunting the bouquetin is towards the
end of summer, and in autumn, during the months of
August and September, when they are usually in good con∣dition.
None but the inhabitants of the mountains engage
in the chace; for it requires not only a head that can bear to
look down from the greatest heights without terror, address
and sure-footedness in the most difficult and dangerous
passes, and to be an excellent marksman, but also much
strength and vigour to support hunger, cold, and prodigious
fatigue. The most determined hunters of bouquetins live
in the mountains of the Lower Vallais; for instance, the
natives of Servan, a village in a wild and picturesque situa∣tion,
four leagues from Valorsine, and two or three from
Martigny, are hunters, and the bouquetins being no longer
found in their mountains, they hunt in those of the valley of
Aost, obtaining a permission for that purpose from the in∣habitants.</P>
<P>Two or three hunters usually associate in this perilous oc∣cupation:
they are armed with rifle-barrelled guns, and fur∣nished
with small bags of provisions; they pass the night
among rocks at considerable heights; they erect a miserable
hut of turf, where they lie without fire or covering, and on
waking not unfrequently find the entrance blocked up with
snow three or four feet in depth. Sometimes, in the pursuit
of a bouquetin, being overtaken by darkness amid crags and
<PB N="383" REF="410"/>
precipices, they are obliged to pass the whole night standing
embraced, in order to support each other, and to prevent
themselves from sleeping. As the bouquetins ascend into the
higher regions very early in the morning, it is necessary to
gain the heights before them, otherwise they scent the hunter
and betake themselves to flight: it would then be in vain to
follow them, for when once they begin to escape, they never
stop till they think themselves entirely out of danger, and
will even sometimes run for ten or twelve leagues.</P>
<P>THE female shows much attachment to her young, and
even defends it against eagles, wolves, and other enemies:
she takes refuge in some cavern, and presenting her head at
the entrance of the hole, thus opposes the enemy. When
a bouquetin is shot, the hunters let it cool upon the spot,
and then embowel it, putting the blood into one of the
entrails, which is esteemed by the peasants a sovereign re∣medy
in plurisies and some other disorders. A large bou∣quetin
thus embowelled will weigh 180 or 200 pounds. A
female weighs only from 70 to 80 pounds.</P>
<P>SOME naturalists are of opinion, that the diminution of
the race of bouquetins in the Alps is owing to his size, the
monstrous length and weight of the horns, which impede
him in his course; because he is driven into places where
he can scarcely procure sufficient nourishment during great
part of the year, where his sight becomes debilitated, and is
frequently lost by the strong reflection of the sun from the
ice and snow. They consider this animal rather as a native
of the subalpine regions, which are covered during summer
<PB N="384" REF="411"/>
with the finest herbage, and where the bouquetins and cha∣mois
probably pastured in tranquillity, when only the lower
vallies and plains were inhabited.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, it is maintained by others, that the
bouquetin is endued with strength proportionate to his size:
and though he is inferior to the chamois in liveliness and
agility, yet he is by no means deficient in activity; that his
horns, though large and weighty, yet from their reclined
position do not seem to be any impediment, but rather
render him essential service when he happens to fall, or pur∣posely
throws himself down precipices to avoid his pursuers.
They add also, that his natural food is rather lichens than
herbs; that he is particularly fond of the young shoots of
trees and shrubs; and that in all the places where he in∣habits,
he is found in the coldest and rudest mountains, and
on the steepest rocks. From these circumstances, it is not
improbable, that his present situation and manner of life is
an effect of nature rather than necessity. Besides, why do
the chamois, who are more hunted than the bouquetin, still
inhabit the less elevated regions; and why are they not
driven among the glaciers? To account for the present
scarcity of the bouquetin, we need only consider the number
of its enemies, in men, beasts, and birds of prey. Nor is
there much cause for apprehensions, that the race will be
extinct even in the Alps. But allowing that the bouquetin
was no longer found in his native Alps, still we could not
affirm with so much propriety that the race was extinct, as
that it had migrated into a milder climate, and, with a state
of domestication and more succulent food, had acquired softer
<PB N="385" REF="412"/>
manners, a form less rude, smaller and smoother horns. For
it is even not improbable, that the <HI>hircus ferus</HI> or bouc-estain
of Belon, the bouquetin of the Alps, the Siberian ibex, and
aegagrus, both so accurately described by Pallas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps also the <HI>capra caucasica,</HI> de∣scribed by Pallas, from the papers of Gul∣denstaedt, and which he represents as differ∣ing from the aegagrus, with which it has been confounded by some naturalists. See Act. Petr. for 1779.</NOTE>, and the
tame goat in all its different forms, are only varieties of the
same species. Their difference in shape and manners may
be sufficiently accounted for from a change of climate, situa∣tion,
and food; they are found to couple freely with each
other; and are asserted to produce an offspring which is
fertile.</P>
<P>THEY all have a beard, which seems to be the great cha∣racteristic
distinction of this genus. They differ more or less
from each other in the shape of their horns, size, and coat,
none of which can be esteemed certain specific distinctions.
The greatest difference undoubtedly consists in the horns,
none of them, perhaps, except the bouquetin, having a lon∣gitudinal
ridge, and some of them being even without the
transverse ridges. But this difference is less perceptible, in
comparing the bouquetin with the Siberian ibex, the ibex
with the aegagrus, and the aegagrus with the tame goat.
Nor are the horns of the Alpine bouquetin so much weigh∣tier,
longer, and larger, than those of the Siberian ibex and
aegagrus, as to form a <HI>certain</HI> specific distinction<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The horns of the bouquetin, as has been before observed, are sometimes found to weigh sixteen or eighteen pounds, to be three feet in length, and to have twenty∣four transverse ridges. A single horn of a Siberian ibex weighed, according to Pallas, eight Russian pounds, which is one-tenth less than an English pound, and had sixteen or eighteen transverse ridges. The horns of another full grown Siberian ibex measured 2 feet 5 inches and 5 lines, along the cur∣vature, and 1 foot 2 inches and 1 line, in a rectilinear direction. The horns of an aega∣grus measured 2 feet 2 inches and 9 lines along the curvature, and 1 foot 4 inches in a linear direction. The horns of a full grown Cau∣casan goat, were 2 feet 4 inches along the curvature, and 1 foot 6 inches in the linear direction. The longitudinal ridge or ridges remain then as the <HI>only</HI> specific difference between the horns of the alpine bouquetin and those of the other species. See the measurements in Pallas Spic. Zool. and in his Description of the Capra Caucasica, in Act. Petr. for 1779.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="413"/>
BUT even were this difference still greater, it could never
be admitted as forming a specific distinction. For the horns
not only vary in individuals of the same species, but in the
same individuals at different ages. If we were to attempt to
arrange animals <HI>solely</HI> by their horns, the discriminations
would be as endless as uncertain. But if, in the present in∣stance,
the alpine bouquetin and the other species of the
goat genus should be excepted from this general assertion,
we have only to add, that M. van Berchem possesses the
horns of a young one, produced from the union of the bou∣quetin
and she-goat, that are exactly similar to the horns of
the aegagrus, which, as Pallas asserts, resemble those of the
tame goat. Climate and nutriment must have a great effect
upon the horns of animals. The female of the bouquetin
has horns very like those of the tame goat. It is no
wonder, therefore, if a long servitude, an inactive life,
an exchange from the aromatic plants and pure air of
the mountains to a gross nutriment and a moister atmo∣sphere,
should diminish the horns, alter their shape, sub∣due
the longitudinal ridge, and convert the knobs into
wrinkles.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="414"/>
THE Count de Buffon extends the goat genus still fur∣ther,
and comprehends under it even the chamois; conjec∣turing,
that the bouquetin is the male in the original race of
goats, and the chamois the female. The French naturalist
having, at the time when he described the bouquetin, never
seen it in a full grown state, was probably induced to enter∣tain
this opinion from a faint resemblance between the fe∣male
bouquetin and the chamois. But there does not seem
the least foundation for this notion, the chamois being an
animal totally distinct from the goats, never coupling with
them, and judiciously classed by Pallas and Pennant in the
genus of antelopes. His conjecture, however, that the bou∣quetin
is the original source of all the tame goats seems to
be well founded; and has been adopted by the greatest part
of succeeding naturalists. And as, according to the just ob∣servations
of Pallas, the aegagrus approaches nearer than
the bouquetin to the tame goat in its form and horns, the
aegagrus may be the link which unites the bouquetin and
the tame goat. May not the aegagrus be considered as a
race produced from the bouquetin and the she-goat, or the
goat and female bouquetin? Pallas also conjectures, that
the tame goat may possibly have been propagated from the
aegagrus and Siberian ibex, which is allowed by most natu∣ralists
to be the same as the bouquetin; and Pennant re∣marks,
with no less sagacity, that the tame goats may be de∣rived
from both, as we are assured that the ibex and she-goat
will produce a similar offspring. It is also probable, that the
bouquetin is the origin of all the goat genus, because it is
the largest, strongest, and dwells in the most inhospitable
regions. For, according to the observation of the same great
<PB N="388" REF="415"/>
zoologist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pallas.</NOTE>, whom we have so often quoted, those animals
who are natives of the coldest mountains must, on descend∣ing
into the warm plains, be liable to greater changes than
those who are formed for milder climates; and this circum∣stance
seems sufficient to account for the great variety observ∣able
in the goat genus.</P>
<P>SOME naturalists pretend, that the bouquetin cannot be the
original stock from whence the goats have been produced, be∣cause,
as he inhabits only the loftiest summits and rocks cover∣ed
with eternal snow, and feeds only on plants peculiar to high
regions, he cannot be domesticated in a variety of climates.
But this opinion is contradicted by fact and experience.
Stumpf, the historian of Switzerland, informs us, that the Val∣laisans
near Sion bred up tame bouquetins with their goats;
and Belon relates, that the Cretans tamed the young bouc∣estains
by giving them to be suckled by the goats. Dr. Pal∣las
also relates, that he has frequently seen the Siberian ibex
among the tame goats, and mentions one in particular at
Orenburgh, which was leader of a flock, and father of a nu∣merous
offspring more resembling the females than himself.
He was very different from the tame he-goats, scarcely in∣ferior
in size to a bouquetin two years old: in colour and
strength he resembled the wild animal; had thick horns,
knobbed, not keeled above, and a long rough coat, but the
hair no where pendent, except in the beard: the black list
on the back was almost obliterated. And lastly, Mr. van
Berchem saw several tame bouquetins at Aigle. They were
<PB N="389" REF="416"/>
gentle and familiar; and, without being remarkably lively,
were active and graceful in all their motions. They bred
with different she-goats, and Mr. van Berchem saw the
young ones, which seemed to form a new race.</P>
<P>IF these observations should be well founded, the goat
genus, or race of the bouquetin, is found in a wild state
along the chain of mountains that traverses the temperate
parts both of Europe and Asia; on the Alps, Pyrenees, and
Carpathian mountains; on the Taurus and Caucasus; on
the mountains of Siberia and Tartary; in Kamtchatka; on
the islands of the Archipelago; in Hedsjaeas in Arabia; in
India; perhaps in Aegypt and Lybia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>HAVING quitted the delightful vale of Chamouny and
its magnificent scenery, we continued our route to∣wards
Geneva. As we proceeded, the height of the moun∣tains
gradually diminished; and the several vallies, through
which we passed, were agreeably diversified in their figures
and productions. We followed the course of the sonorous
and violent Arve; and near Salenche we came to a descent,
where on our right hand we descried a small lake, the situ∣ation
whereof is extremely picturesque; and whose borders,
skirted with wood, are pleasing and diversified. From hence
we descended into the plain, which continues almost per∣fectly
level to Geneva. Salenche lies at the bottom of a
broad valley, which here contracts to a narrow pass. Tra∣dition
says, that this little plain was once a lake; and indeed
its form, and the quality of the soil, seem to justify tradition:
great part is laid waste by the unruly Arve, which frequent∣ly
overflows its banks; and the rest is mostly covered with
fruit-trees.</P>
<P>NOT far from Magland we stopped to admire a beautiful
fall of water, called the cascade of Arpenas, which rushes,
<PB N="392" REF="419"/>
like the Staubbach, from an impending rock. When I saw
it, there was a considerable wind, which drove the torrent,
soon after its leaving the rock, at least an hundred yards out
of the perpendicular direction, into an almost imperceptible
spray: I then beheld it trickling down the side of the moun∣tains
in a thousand little streams, which united at a ridge;
and from thence formed three cascades. The body of water
was much more considerable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be necessary to apprize the traveller, that, in dry summers, this cascade is sometimes almost destitute of water, lest, seeing it under that circumstance, he should conceive the description in the text to be too much exaggerated.</NOTE> than that of the Staubbach;
and the fall appeared to me altogether as high. Between
Magland and Cluse we took a guide to conduct us to the cave
of <HI>la Balme.</HI> Though the ascent was not very long, yet it
was so steep that we were nearly an hour in reaching it; we
then scrambled along a precipice, from which we mounted a
ladder; and by the aid of the branches of a nut-tree growing
from the rock, we pulled ourselves into a natural cavern
more than a quarter of a mile in length, and forming va∣rious
branches that led into lofty vaults and spacious open∣ings;
but the sight of which did not answer the trouble re∣quired
to enter it.</P>
<P>WE passed the night at Cluse, which is situated by the
side of the Arve; and the next morning came down the
banks of that river to Bonneville, the capital of Faucigny: it
stands also upon the Arve, at the bottom of a chain of rocks,
which from this place diminish into hills. All this part of
Faucigny, as also a small strip of Chablais through which
we passed, is a rich plain, that produces wine and corn in
<PB N="393" REF="420"/>
great plenty; but is neither populous nor well cultivated.
By the little village of Chene we entered into the territory of
Geneva: the sudden change from the poverty of the Sa∣voyards
to the neatness and ease of the Genevans, the popu∣lousness
of the country, the richness of its cultivation, and
the number of country-seats scattered about the fields, were
circumstances that affected me with a pleasing satisfaction.
As I propose visiting Geneva again, in my way to the south
of France, I will defer giving any account of that interesting
town until my return.</P>
<P>WE went from Geneva to Crassi, a small village in the
Pays de Vaud, where we passed a day with an English gen∣tleman,
who has taken a house for the summer in that de∣lightful
spot. In our way to Crassi we passed through Ver∣soi,
a little village in the French territories, upon the lake of
Geneva, known by the name of <HI>Choiseul's Folly.</HI> Geneva ha∣ving
fallen under the displeasure of France; that minister
endeavouring to take advantage of the troubles in 1768, laid
a plan to ruin the town, and to monopolise the whole trade
of the lake. Accordingly he fixed upon Versoi as a situa∣tion
the most proper, upon which to build a large town.
For this purpose, he began by sinking a pier and making an
harbour: he constructed also a frigate; marked out the
streets; sent a considerable quantity of stone to build the
houses; ordered a garrison, and erected huts for them, in
which they continued some time. Nevertheless, when the
harbour was nearly finished, and government had expended
about £. 125,000, the scheme was relinquished.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="421"/>
THE road from Geneva to Lausanne runs through the
<HI>Pays de Vaud,</HI> a region of which historians and travellers
speak with rapture; particularly of that part which borders
upon the lake of Geneva: and indeed a more delightful
country cannot well be imagined. It is, almost the whole
way, a gradual ascent from the edge of the lake, richly laid
out in vineyards, corn-fields, and luxuriant meadows; and
checquered with continued hamlets, villages, and towns:
the shores are generally of the cleanest gravel; and the water
is of so fine a transparency, that you may see the bottom to a
very considerable depth. We passed through Nyon, which
stands delightfully upon the edge of the lake, and in the
very point where it begins to widen. It was formerly called
<HI>Colonia Equestris Noiodunum;</HI> and as a proof of its antiquity,
several Roman inscriptions, and other antient remains, have
been frequently discovered in the out-skirts of the town. In
this part the lake forms a beautiful curve, happily alluded
to by Lucan, where he mentions the army of Julius Caesar
striking their tents, which were posted on the borders.</P>
<Q>Deseruere <HI>CAVO</HI> tentoria fixa Lemano.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>“They strike their tents and quit the <HI>hollow bend</HI></L>
<L>Of Leman's lake.”</L></Q></NOTE></Q>
<P>ALL the possessions in this country formerly belonging to
the duke of Savoy, were wrested from him in the war, which
the canton of Berne declared against him, in 1536, in defence
of Geneva: and in the same year the reformation was intro∣duced.
From that period all the Pays de Vaud, excepting
<PB N="395" REF="422"/>
the common bailliages of Granson, Orbe, and a small portion of
it which was ceded to Friburgh, has been subject to Berne,
and makes part of that canton.</P>
<P>MORGES, which is situated at the extremity of a beauti∣ful
bay, is the neatest town in these parts. The environs
are extremely pleasant; the banks of the lake form an am∣phitheatre
gently rising to the Jura; and Mont Blanc pre∣sents
itself through an immense opening in the opposite
chain of rocks, which seems to have been formed by nature
in order to exhibit a sublime perspective of that beautiful
mountain. Near the town is a lime-tree of a great size, be∣ing
twenty-four feet four inches in circumference, and with
branches of magnificent extent; it has a companion about
three feet less in girth. Mr. Pennant informs me, that
“this tree is a native of Switzerland, and of many other
parts of the continent; that it was imported into England
before the year 1562; one being described by Dr. William
Turner as growing in a park near Colchester; that one
thirty-six feet in circumference grew near the great church
at Berne; it was planted about the year 1410; and its hollow
trunk, still putting forth leaves, was to be seen in the year
1702<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A large lime is to be seen on the heights above Villars, a seat belonging to Mr. Graffenred of Berne, near Morat. Its girth measures at least thirty-six feet in cir∣cumference, and its height is not less than ninety feet. It is very antient, as it was lopped in 1550, for the sake of the bark. The traveller who visits this tree, will be no less gratified with an extensive prospect, commanding the lakes of Morat, Neuchatel, and Bienne, and that stupendous chain of snowy alps which is represented on the en∣graving inserted in this volume.</NOTE>. The Germans, in old times, were fond of planting
the lime before their churches and in the market-places, on
<PB N="396" REF="423"/>
account of its grateful shade. This tree is now grown much
out of use; yet the Romans esteemed it so highly, as to say
that it was employed for a thousand purposes, <HI>tiliae ad mille
usus petendae.</HI> A sweet juice exudes from the leaves and bark,
from which the Poles extract a honey called by them Lie∣piz<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—cogere pressis</L>
<L>Mella favis; illi tilia, atque uberrima pinus.</L></Q></NOTE>. Bees are also fond of the flowers; for that reason Virgil,
in his beautiful description of the industrious Corycian, places
the lime and the pine in the neighbourhood of his hives.”</P>
<P>LAUSANNE contains about seven thousand inhabitants:
it is built upon an ascent so steep, that in some places the
horses cannot, without great difficulty, draw up a carriage;
and foot-passengers ascend to the upper part of the town
by steps. But these inconveniences are amply compensated
by the sublimest views in nature, commanding the lake
of Geneva, the Pays de Vaud, and the rugged coast of
Chablais.</P>
<P>THE same year in which part of the Pays de Vaud was
conquered from the house of Savoy, the bishop of Lausanne,
retiring from the town, the inhabitants put themselves under
the protection and sovereignty of the canton of Berne;
which confirmed and augmented their privileges. At
present, Lausanne is governed by its own magistrates; has
its own courts of justice; and, what is very singular, the
citizens, who possess houses in the principal street, enjoy
the privilege of pronouncing sentence in criminal causes.
<PB N="397" REF="424"/>
The criminal is tried by the civil power: if he is found, and ac∣knowledges
himself guilty, the burghers of this street assem∣ble;
one of the magistrates pleads in defence of the prisoner,
and another against him; the court of justice give their opinion
upon the point of law; and the majority of the citizens, pos∣sessing
houses in the principal street, determine the penalty.
If the punishment is capital, there is, according to the letter
of the law, no pardon, unless obtained within twenty-four
hours from the sovereign council of Berne; although it
generally happens, that eight days are granted for that pur∣pose.
When the criminal is seized within the jurisdiction of
the town; the fact is tried, and the burghers pronounce
sentence, in the town-hall: in this case there is no appeal.
But, when he is taken within the district of the bailif, they
assemble in his house; and an appeal lies from their deter∣mination
to Berne. I have been the more particular in my
inquiries concerning the mode of this criminal process, from
the strong resemblance it bears, in some respects, to our trial
by juries. Here is an academy for the students of this coun∣try:
professors in every science are appointed by govern∣ment;
and there is a tolerable library for the use of the
public.</P>
<P>I HAVE several times had the good fortune to meet
Tissot, the celebrated physician of this place; well known
in the literary world for his excellent writings upon several
medical subjects. His conversation is uncommonly interest∣ing;
as, besides his skill in his profession, he is well versed
in every branch of polite literature. His private character is
no less respectable than his public; and he is as much
<PB N="398" REF="425"/>
esteemed for his great humanity as for his superior know∣ledge.</P>
<P>THE church of Lausanne, formerly the cathedral, is a
magnificent gothic building, standing on the most elevated
part of the town. It contains, among many other sepulchres,
the tomb of Amadeus the Eighth, duke of Savoy, styled the
Solomon of his age; but more known by the name of the
anti-pope Felix the Fifth; who exhibited a singular instance
in the annals of Europe, of a personage <HI>twice</HI> abdicating the
pomp of sovereignty, and <HI>twice</HI> retiring to a private station.
Having passed his early youth and opening manhood in the
pursuits of ambition, he enlarged his dominions by the ac∣quisition
of the Genevois and Piedmont, and obtained an
increase of rank by the erection of Savoy into a dutchy. Yet
in the midst of his greatest success, and when fortune seemed
most propitious, the sudden death of a beloved wife, and a
narrow escape from assassination, inspired him with such a
disgust of the world, that he resigned, in 1434, the admini∣stration
of his estates to his eldest son; and, accompanied
with a few lords of his court, retired to a palace at La Ri∣paille,
on the borders of the lake of Geneva. In this palace,
which he called an <HI>hermitage,</HI> he enjoyed, with an apparent
indifference to the affairs of the world, a calm and tranquil∣lity
that seemed incompatible with his former aspiring am∣bition;
until he was suddenly called forth to public notice in
a more exalted station.</P>
<P>THE council of Basle having deposed Eugenius the
Fourth, induced, according to some authors, by the reputa∣tion
<PB N="399" REF="426"/>
which Amadeus had acquired for sanctity, influenced,
according to others, by his largesses and intrigues, raised the
<HI>hermit</HI> of La Ripaille to the papal throne. This event took
place in 1439: the new pontiff quitting his favourite retreat,
accepted the proffered dignity, either with a real or affected
reluctance, and assumed the name of Felix the Fifth. The
aera of his disputed pontificate was marked with turbulence
and anarchy. In order to avoid the storms which agitated
Europe, and to favour the natural indolence of his temper,
he frequently retreated to his beloved hermitage, and direct∣ed
the affairs of the church from that sequestered corner.
Conscious at length that his acceptance of the papacy served
to widen instead of healing the schism of the church; find∣ing
that he was opposed by the most powerful princes of
Europe; that, on the death of his rival Eugenius, the car∣dinals
of Rome had chosen another pope; and being ill
supported by the remains of the council of Basle, he termi∣nated
the schism by resigning the papal tiara in favour of
Nicholas the Fifth. In this transaction he proved his ta∣lents
for negotiation by obtaining the following conditions:
that he should enjoy the next rank to the pope; that he
should be appointed vicar of the Roman see; and that all
the acts passed in his pontificate should be valid. On his
resignation he sixed his residence at La Ripaille, and died
in 1451.</P>
<P>FELIX the Fifth has shared the fate of many equivocal
characters. By some he is represented as a saint, by others
as covering the most ambitious designs under the mask of
sanctity; by the former, his residence at La Ripaille is
<PB N="400" REF="427"/>
described as the retreat of religious austerity; by the latter,
as the seat of luxury. In this, as in most other cases, both
parties seem to have exceeded the truth. On reviewing the
principal events of his life, we may conclude, that a pa∣lace
built by a sovereign prince, in which he was accom∣panied
by many lords of his court, where he instituted an
order of knighthood, and where he resided with the pomp
and dignity of a sovereign pontiff, could be no common
<HI>hermitage;</HI> and that he assumed the name, rather than
passed the life, of a <HI>hermit;</HI> while the power and rank
which he secured to himself, on his resignation of the papa∣cy,
sufficiently demonstrate, that he never intended to re∣nounce
the world. On the contrary, should we admit, that
his life at La Ripaille was not embittered by penance and
mortifications; yet as no contemporary authors, even those
who were by no means partial to his character, have stigma∣tised
his retirement, we ought not hastily to conclude, that it
was the retreat of a mere voluptuary. But in whatever
light his moral qualities may be considered, no one can
withhold from him the character of an able politician.</P>
<P>IT is not my intention to enter into a general or particu∣lar
description of the Roman antiquities, which have been
found in Switzerland; if you are curious in researches of
that sort, I must refer you to Bochart, Miller, Spon, and
other antiquarians, who have treated minutely of that sub∣ject.
I cannot, however, avoid mentioning two lately∣discovered
Roman monuments, which are placed in the
garden of Mr. Levade, near the church at Lausanne. The
first is an altar of white marble with red veins, and was
<PB N="401" REF="428"/>
found, in 1782, by some workmen in digging the founda∣tions
of a house in the town of Vevay. It is broken in a
horizontal direction; and what remains is a foot and a half
long and a foot high. The inscription, though not entire,
proves it to be an altar erected by the twentieth legion to the
god Silvanus.</P>
<Q>DEO SILVANO
ESPER URSUL.
FICIO LEG. XX.
DIC</Q>
<P>THE second monument is a Roman mile-stone, which
was discovered in a vineyard near Pauda, a few paces from
the high road. It bears the following inscription:</P>
<Q>Imp.
Caes T. Ae. Avg
Antonino
Pio <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> PM. Krib—
Cos. III. P. P.
Avent: M. P. T.
XXXVIII.</Q>
<P>THIS inscription ascertains a fact long unknown to the
Swiss antiquarians. Bochart, among others, expresses his
surprise, that no inscription, bearing the name Antoninus
Pius, who was so great a benefactor to the antient Helve∣tians,
has been as yet found in Switzerland. But this mile∣stone,
which was put up in the third consulship of that em∣peror,
<PB N="402" REF="429"/>
proves the existence of such an inscription; and is
probably the prelude to the discovery of other monuments
erected in his honour.</P>
<P>THE road from Lausanne to Vevay, runs along the sides
of the mountains, between continued ranges of vineyards.
The industry of the Swiss is no where more observable than
in these parts: the mountains in many places, though natu∣rally
consisting of a bare steep rock, are thickly covered
with vines. The mould has been brought from other
grounds, in order to create a soil, and is supported by rows
of stones ranged in strait lines like walls. But this mode of
culture, however advantageous, and even necessary to the
natives, occasions a disagreeable uniformity in the face of
the country. The vines also do not form a pleasing and pic∣turesque
appearance, like those of the Valteline<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. ii.</NOTE>, which
are carried in beautiful festoons from tree to tree. The plants
are low, and fastened to poles about four feet in height; and
the high walls which enclose them, and border the road,
frequently interrupt the view. This district between Lau∣sanne
and Vevay is called <HI>La Vaux,</HI> and contains the two plea∣sant
little towns of Lutry and Cully; and the villages of St.
Saphorin<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the church of St. Saphorin, is an antient Roman mile-stone, found near that village, with the following inscription:
<Q>TI. CLAVDIVS. DRVSI. F.
CAES. AVG. GERM.
PONT. MAX. TRIB. POT. VII.
IMP. XII. P. P. COS. IIII.

This inscription ascertains two circum∣stances, which have been frequently called in question; namely, that the banks of the lake of Geneva, which border this part of Switzerland, were comprized within a Roman province, even so early as the time of Claudius; and also, that <HI>Aventi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um</HI> was the chief town of this part of Helvetia: for, the mile-stones always referred to the capital town of the province in which they were placed. From St. Saphorin to <HI>Avenches</HI> is exactly 37,000 paces; which answer to the 37th mile-stone.</NOTE> and Corsier: it is entirely hilly, rising abruptly
<PB N="403" REF="430"/>
from the lake. Above the vineyards, are rich meadows, and
a continued forest.</P>
<P>VEVAY, the antient <HI>Vibiscum,</HI> is the principal town of
the bailliage of that name: it is clean and well built, stands
in a small plain at the foot of the mountains on the edge of
the water, and is one of the few towns in the canton of
Berne which carry on any trade. The borders of this part of
the lake are much more contrasted, wild, and picturesque, than
those about Geneva: the mountains of the Vallais and Savoy
boldly project into the water, and form a semicircular chain
that encloses the lake, except where they are divided by the
Rhone; which flows into it a few leagues from Vevay.</P>
<P>VEVAY is distinguished as being the residence of Edmund
Ludlow, the famous parliamentary general, whose name
stands foremost among the few persons, who, in those times
of misrule and confusion, uniformly acted with consistency
and dignity. True to his republican principles, he no less
violently opposed the daring usurpation of Cromwell, than
the arbitrary measures of Charles the First; and could never
be prevailed upon, either by threats or promises, to desert
the cause, which he considered as the cause of justice and
liberty. Being excepted, as one of the king's judges, from
<PB N="404" REF="431"/>
the act of indemnity passed at the restoration of Charles the
Second, he wandered, without any fixed place of residence,
until he found an asylum from the base attempts of his ene∣mies
at Vevay, under the protection of Berne.</P>
<P>AT the important period of the revolution, he returned
to England, anxious to serve his country under our great de∣liverer;
and William the Third, whose mind rose superior to
the narrow prejudices of party, was no less desirous to em∣ploy
a general of such approved experience and fidelity.
But the king being addressed by the House of Commons to
issue a proclamation for apprehending Ludlow, at the
moment his majesty was going to employ him; he was ac∣cordingly
compelled to quit England at this critical period,
and again settled at Vevay. We may collect from his ge∣neral
character and conduct, that if he had been permitted to
serve his country, he would have successfully employed his
great military talents against the assertors of bigotry and
despotism; and with the same zeal, which he had displayed
in opposing an arbitrary government, would have supported
the new administration; when the enormous prerogatives of
the crown, against which he had unsheathed his sword,
were abolished by law; and the freedom of the subject was
established on the basis of equal liberty under the authority
of a limited monarch. He died in 1693, in the sixty-fourth
year of his age; and was interred in the church of Vevay.
His monument is a plain grave-stone of black marble, con∣taining
a Latin inscription, which is printed in Addison's
Travels. The house which he formerly inhabited stands
near the gate leading to the Vallais, and the following motto is
<PB N="405" REF="432"/>
inscribed over the door, which is still preserved out of respect
to his memory. <HI>Omne solum forti patria est, quia patris.</HI></P>
<P>THE Memoirs of Ludlow are written in a simple and per∣spicuous
stile; with the fidelity of a man who was actually
engaged in the scenes which he describes, and with the spirit
of a general zealous in the cause which he had espoused and
defended. Perhaps his animated detail of the trial and exe∣cution
of the Regicides, is scarcely surpassed by any narrative
in antient or modern history.</P>
<P>NATURE can scarcely form a position more delightful
than that of Chatillard or Clarens. It stands, not far from
Vevay, above the village of Clarens, on an eminence, whose
gentle declivity slopes gradually towards the lake: it com∣mands
a view of that majestic body of water, its fertile
borders, and the bold rocks and alps of Savoy. The ad∣jacent
scenery consists of vineyards, fields of corn and
pasture, and rich groves of oak, ash, and Spanish chesnut∣trees.
Although the situation and environs harmonize with
the animated scenery in the Eloise of Rousseau, yet the castle
by no means accords with the description in the same work.
The traveller sees an oblong building with antient towers
and a penthouse roof; in the inside a large hall that looks
like a prison; and the whole bears rather the antiquated ap∣pearance
of a feudal mansion inhabited by some turbulent
baron, than the residence of the elegant and impassioned
Julie.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to Clarens, on the other shore of the lake, are
the dark gloomy rocks of Meillerie. That village lies in the
<PB N="406" REF="433"/>
recess of a small bay, at the foot of impending mountains,
in some parts gently sloping, and clothed to the water's edge
with dark forests; in others naked and perpendicular,
bringing to recollection the fancied rocks of Leucate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Je n'ai plus qu'un mot à vous dire, ô Julie. Vous connoissez l'antique usage du <HI>rocher de Leucate,</HI> dernier resuge des amans malheureux. Ce lieu-ci lui ressem∣ble à bien des égards. La roche est escarpée l'eau est prosonde, &amp; je suis au desespon.</NOTE>.
These are the scenes of the Nouvelle Eloise. Having ob∣tained
that novel at a circulating library in Lausanne, I con∣tinued,
during these expeditions, to examine the position of
the country, and compare it with the descriptions of
Rousseau. Small objects may be magnified; but no pencil,
however animated, can delineate the wonderful and sublime
works of nature; even the warm colouring of Rousseau has
not equalled the beauty of the situations. I read with at∣tention
the principal parts of that singular performance;
and having now the scenery before me, I dwelt more par∣ticularly
upon that letter, in which St. Preux relates his ex∣pedition
to Meillerie; wherein love and despair are worked
up almost to madness. Open that performance, read that
letter, and consider that part of it, where St. Preux points
out the number of towns and villages, the continued fertility
and high cultivation of the Pays de Vaud, and contrasts it
with the gloomy coast of Chablais, exhibiting only a few
towns lying on the edge of the water; you will then see the
happy and superior effects of liberty under a mild and equi∣table
government, like that of Berne.</P>

<P>TRAVELLERS not unusually make an agreeable
excursion from Vevay to the salt-works of Bex and
Aigle.</P>
<P>THE road continues along a plain, with hills on one side,
and the lake on the other. Haller's judicious distinction
of the elevated part of this country, may from this spot
be well exemplified. The rocky alps are seen with their
pyramidal tops shooting into the heavens, and incrusted with
eternal ice and snow. Snow likewise, at various intervals,
covers the steep slopes beneath the aspiring peaks; rich
pasturage succeeds; and the bottoms are verdant with forests
of firs. The mountains, such as the Jura and those rising
towards Denis and Gruyeres, are fertile in grass, well wooded,
their tops even, extensive and arable; and though with little
appearance of rock on the surface, yet internally filled with
a hard yellowish stone fit for building, but impatient of the
chissel. The <HI>collines,</HI> or little hills, are frequent at the foot
of the mountains, and separated by little vallies watered by
small brooks.</P>
<P>THE further I advanced, the nearer the mountains ap∣proached
the lake; their nature changed, their height in∣creased,
and their craggy tops and wooded sides convinced
me, that I was approaching the genuine alps. Above the
woods soared, in a most picturesque manner, a lofty pyra∣midal
<PB N="408" REF="435"/>
crag called <HI>Le Dent de Jamant.</HI> The woods were
firs mixed with oak. The road lay close to the water's edge.
The castle of Chillon, or rather the castellated house, a large
pile with round and square towers; stands on a rock in the
lake, and is connected to the land by a draw-bridge. The
vaults are very fine; the arched roofs and the pillars which
support it, are in a neat gothic stile. This castle, in 1536,
was wrested from Charles the Third of Savoy by the canton
of Berne, assisted by the Genevans, who furnished a frigate
(their naval force) to besiege it by water. In a deep dun∣geon,
below the level of the lake, the conquerors found
Bonivard, prior of St. Victor, the intrepid antagonist of the
dukes of Savoy, and the great assertor of Genevan indepen∣dence.
He had been imprisoned by the Savoyards during
six years; and, by constant walking in his short limits, had
worn a hollow in the rock. This castle was for a short time
the residence of a bailif from Berne, until a more convenient
house was purchased for that officer in Vevay. About half
a league further is Villeneuve, a small town at the extremity
of the lake. I travelled along the concave side of this mag∣nificent
piece of water from Geneva to Villeneuve fifty-four
miles. It is in the shape of a crescent; Switzerland forms the
hollow; Savoy the convex part; its greatest breadth is from
St. Sulpice to Grande Rive, where it is twelve miles wide.
Savoy affords a rude an awful boundary of aspiring alps,
craggy and covered with the ice of ages. The country from
Geneva to the environs of Lausanne, slopes for a considerable
way to the margin of the lake, and is enriched with all the
varieties which nature can bestow. The long ridge of
the Jura, fertile in pasturage, and varied with woods, backs
this beautiful tract. Near Lausanne the banks rise very con∣siderably,
<PB REF="436"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="409" REF="437"/>
and form a most charming terrace. A few miles
beyond Lausanne is a rapid descent. Near Vevay begins
a plain, which is continued far beyond the end of the lake,
but contracting, by the approach of the mountains, towards
the water. The colour of the water is extremely beautiful,
clear, and at a distance seems of a most lovely blue.</P>
<P>NEAR Geneva the coast abounds in small pebbles covered
with a brown incrustation. From Geneva as far as Lau∣sanne
the shores are sandy; but from Lausanne to Chillon
appear ledges of rocks hard and calcareous: the extremity
of the lake is a marsh formed by the collected mud of the
Rhone. The depth is various. M. de Luc asserts, that on
sounding it he had found the greatest depth to be a hundred
and sixty fathoms: like all inland lakes enclosed within high
mountains, it is subject to sudden storms.</P>
<P>I AM uncertain whether any birds frequent the lake
which are not common to the rest of Switzerland. The
tippet grebes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pennant's Brit. Zool. vol. ii. No. 222.</NOTE> appear here in December and retire in Fe∣bruary.
The skins are an elegant article of luxury, and sell
for about twelve or fourteen shillings each. These birds are
obliged to breed in other places, this lake being almost
totally destitute of reeds and rushes, in which they form
their floating nest. From Villeneuve the road runs through
a beautiful valley, consisting of the richest meadow and corn
land, very populous and sinely wooded, and expanding to
the breadth of four miles. The alps bound each side, with
<PB N="410" REF="438"/>
tops broken into vast crags of various forms. I passed near
La Roche, where a director of the salt-works is deputed by
the government of Berne; and which is rendered memo∣rable
by the residence of Haller, who filled that office from
1758 to 1766. During his retirement in this place, that
distinguished man prepared for public inspection many of
his numerous publications, and particularly his immortal
work on physiology.</P>
<P>I LEFT at a little distance Yvorne, ruined, in 1584, by the
fall of a mountain occasioned by an earthquake; crossed the
torrent called La Grande Eau, and halted at Aigle, a good
town, seated at the seet of some small round hills prettily
covered with firs. This country was conquered from the
Savoyards by Berne in 1475, and was made a distinct govern∣ment
consisting of four <HI>Mandemens.</HI> The governor resides
at Aigle. It formerly had its particular heads, the family of
Torrens; but the last count formally resigned his pretensions
at Berne in 1553. This government of Aigle reaches to the
Pays de Vaud; and, when under the dominion of the house
of Savoy, was comprised within that district; at present it is
classed under the German division of that canton, although
French is the language of the natives. Further on the val∣ley
is greatly contracted, and so filled with trees as to appear
a great forest. The laburnum abounds here in a wild state.
The wood is beautifully veined, of great strength, and much
used for wedges aud musical instruments. The variety with
short spikes of flowers has the most elegant veins, and is cal∣led
the <HI>ebony</HI> of the Alps: Pliny says its wood is the hardest
next to the ebony. The cornelian cherry is common in the
<PB N="411" REF="439"/>
hedges, and the fruit is frequently preserved with sugar. The
<HI>Machaleb</HI> cherry, or <HI>Prunus Machaleb,</HI> is to be found in these
parts; the wood is red, of fine scent, and in request for
handles of knives; it is known among cutlers by the name of
<HI>Bois de St. Lucie.</HI> A pleasant scented water is distilled from
this tree; and the seeds are used to give a fragrancy to soap.
Between Aigle and Bex is a most picturesque view of the
castle of St. Tryphon, on the summit of a lofty insulated
rock in the middle of the plain; it is surrounded with wood,
and realises Milton's description of an antient castle,</P>
<Q><L>“Bosom'd high in tufted trees.”</L></Q>
<P>I am informed it is built of marble, which is no wonder, as a
beautiful black species is found very near. St. Tryphon
was a Phrygian, who is said to have suffered martyrdom at
Nice in 251, at the time of the persecution under the em∣peror
Decius.</P>
<P>BEX is a small town at the foot of the mountains, five
miles from the salt-works at Bevieux. Between Bex and
Bevieux, I observed the larch in great plenty. Painters,
from the time of Pliny to that of Raphael, trusted their
works to this wood, which the Roman naturalist stiles <HI>im∣mortale
lignum.</HI> The wood is reckoned excellent for all works
which are to lie under water; and the borderers on the lake of
Geneva prefer it for building their vessels. In these parts I
saw most beautiful woods of chesnut. Haller says that they
extend some leagues; he also informs us, that they are found
in other parts of Switzerland, and even in desert places in
<PB N="412" REF="440"/>
some of the transalpine parts; accident must have brought
them thither, as it appears from Pliny, that these trees were
first introduced into Europe from Sardis.</P>
<P>UPON our arrival at the salt-springs, I put on a work∣man's
jacket, and went into the mountain about 3,000 feet
almost horizontally. The gallery is about six feet high, and
four broad, and is as nicely hollowed as if it had been cut
with a chissel: it is hewn in a black rock, veined in some
places with white gypsum. The salt is procured from
some springs, which are found within a solid rock, perfo∣rated
at a great expence: the richest source yields twenty-eight
pounds of salt <HI>per cent.</HI> and the poorest but half a
pound in the same quantity. Near these springs are se∣veral
warm sources, strongly impregnated with sulphur;
some of which contain a mixture of salt, and will flame
when a lighted candle is put into the pipe through which
they flow. No solid salt, excepting a few small cubes, has
been yet discovered; but the mountain is replete with
particles. Rocks of white gypsum or alabaster, mixed with
bluish clay, are common near the springs, in the same
manner as may be observed in the pits of Northwich,
in Cheshire.</P>
<P>AFTER travelling in this subterraneous passage near
three quarters of a mile, I observed a great wheel of thirty-five
feet diameter, which serves to raise the brine from the
depth of about seventy feet. From this place is a shaft three
hundred feet high, which is cut through the mountain to
the surface, for the purpose of introducing fresh air. I no∣ticed
<PB N="413" REF="441"/>
two reservoirs hollowed in the solid rock for holding
the brine; one whereof was a hundred and sixty feet square,
and nine in depth. Since my first expedition to these pits
in 1776, the workmen had pierced the rock twenty-five feet
deeper, and cut a gallery a hundred feet in length. They
had also began to form a third reservoir, which is to contain
5,500 cubic feet; and of this nearly half was finished. The
brine deposited in these reservoirs is conveyed, by means of
two thousand pipes, about a league to Bevieux, where the salt
is extracted. The brine pits near Aigle contain only from
two to one-half <HI>per cent.;</HI> and yield annually about a third
as much as those of Bevieux, or about 5,000 quintals. The
salt is much whiter and heavier than that of Bevieux, and
consequently bears a higher price.</P>
<P>THESE, which are the only salt-works in Switzerland,
scarcely yield a neat yearly profit of more than £. 3,000;
and furnish only one-twelfth of the annual consumption in
the canton. The remainder is procured chiefly from France,
which is obliged by treaty to provide the Swiss states with
this commodity at a moderate price: and indeed so high is
the tax upon salt in that kingdom, that even the French
salt is sold two-thirds cheaper in Switzerland, than in many
parts of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Paris, where it is the dearest, a pound of salt is sold for about 13 sols, or about six-pence of our money: in some other parts of France, for instance in Franche Comté, a pound costs only 4 or 5 sols; but it is furnished to the Swiss at the rate of 2 1/2 sols.</NOTE>. The ordinary price of common salt
throughout the canton, is at the rate of three-half-pence
per pound.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VALLEY AND LAKE OF JOUX—ORBE—ST. BAR∣THELEMI—YVERDUN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Yverdun, <DATE>Sept. 7.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE chain of mountains called the <HI>Jura,</HI> begins in the
canton of Zuric, extends along the Rhine, into the
canton and bishopric of Basle, stretches into the canton of
Soleure and the principality of Neuchatel, branches out to∣wards
the Pays de Vaud, separates that country from
Franche Comté and Burgundy, and continues beyond the
frontiers of the Genevois as far as the Rhone. In va∣rious
parts of the Pays de Vaud this chain forms many
elevated vallies much visited by travellers, amongst which,
not the least remarkable, is the valley of the lake of Joux,
upon the top of that part of the Jura called Mont Joux;
and which lies in the bailliage of Roman Motier. This
valley contains several neat and well-peopled villages, and
is beautifully checkered with wood, arable, and pasture
ground. It is watered by two picturesque lakes; the largest
of which is called the lake of Joux. One shore is high rock,
covered with wood; the opposite banks form a gentle ascent,
well cultivated and producing grain, backed by an abrupt
ridge adorned with pines, beech, and oak. The smaller
lake, called Lac Brenet, is in its shape more oval, and richly
bordered with corn-fields and cottages. These two lakes
are divided by a narrow neck of land; and over the channel
<PB N="415" REF="443"/>
or little streight is a wooden bridge of a single arch, which
leads to the village of Charbonniers.</P>
<P>NEAR the small village of Abbaye, a rivulet gushes from
the bottom of the rock, and loses itself in the largest lake. From
the smaller lake descends a stream, which is lost in a hollow
gulph called <HI>L'Entonnior,</HI> or the Funnel, a name common to
several others in this place. In this gulph several mills are
placed, and turned by the force of the current. About two
miles further, on the opposite side of the mountain, the river
Orbe bursts forth, and is probably produced by the stream here
ingulphed. This little vale is very populous, containing about
three thousand inhabitants, who are remarkably industrious.
Some make watches, but the greatest part are employed in
polishing crystals, granites, and marcasites. In the small
village of Pont, where we lodged, the greatest part of the in∣habitants
bear the surname of Rochat; a name which runs
through the village of Charboniere, with the exception of
only two or three families; and is prevalent likewise in that
of Abbaye: the whole number of these Rochats amounts to
above a thousand. I inquired whether, like the Scottish
clans, they took the appellation from any chief; or whether
they were supposed to be descendants of the same family: I
was assured, that the latter is the fact, and that their ances∣tors
came originally from France. These parts are much in∣fested
with bears and wolves. In our ascent to this delight∣ful
vale, and as we descended through a variety of hill, val∣ley,
wood, and lawn; we had a most extensive prospect,
comprehending great part of the Pays de Vaud, the lake of
Geneva with its mountainous boundary, and that of Neucha∣tel.
<PB N="416" REF="444"/>
These two lakes appear, from that high point of view,
to be nearly upon the same level<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to Mr. de Luc, the lake of Neuchatel is 159 French feet above that of Geneva.</NOTE>, with no considerable swell
of the country intervening.</P>
<P>WE passed through a beautiful and picturesque country
from Romain Motier to Orbe; which, according to anti∣quarians,
was the most antient town, and once the most
powerful, of all Helvetia. It was called <HI>Urba,</HI> and was the
capital of the <HI>Pagus Urbigenus:</HI> no remains however exist
at present of its antient splendour. Some antique fortifica∣tions,
an old castle, and a round tower, are works probably
of later and more turbulent times; erected, perhaps, when
this country was divided into a number of feudal sovereign∣ties.
I am greatly pleased with the romantic situation of this
town, the boldness of the single-arched bridge projecting
over the Orbe, the wild scenery on the banks of that river,
its frequent cataracts, and with various picturesque views in
the environs.</P>
<P>MR. VENEL, an eminent surgeon of this town, has form∣ed,
under the protection of the government of Berne, an
establishment which well deserves the attention of the hu∣mane
and curious traveller. It is an infirmary for the re∣ception
of those objects, who are born with distorted limbs,
or have by accident acquired that misfortune. The children
are lodged and boarded in the house, under the care of his
assistant, who charges himself with all the detail of house∣keeping,
<PB N="417" REF="445"/>
and of instructing those, whose age renders it re∣quisite,
that their education should not be neglected. Mr.
Venel's skill in improving and simplifying those machines
necessary for his purpose, has been sufficiently attested by
various cures.</P>
<P>THOUGH he chiefly confines his attempts to infants and
children, yet he has performed several cures on adult per∣sons.
His most efficacious remedy is a machine which he
has invented to embrace the patient's limbs when in bed,
and which is so contrived as to act without disturbing their
rest. Ingenious as his method is, yet he acknowledges, that
much of his success depends on the mild treatment of the
patients, and on having them continually under his inspec∣tion.
I was convinced indeed of the mildness of his treat∣ment,
by observing several of these children, from four to
ten years of age, crawling about the ground, and diverting
themselves with great cheerfulness, although cased up in
their machinery. It may not perhaps be unworthy of re∣mark,
that Mr. Venel, on the admission of a miserable object,
takes in plaister of Paris the mold of the distorted limbs, in
order to demonstrate the change that takes place. Such an
establishment redounds highly to the honour of Mr. Venel,
and the government who protects it, and is worthy of imi∣tation
in all countries.</P>
<P>ORBE, which is governed by its own magistrates, is com∣prised
within the bailliage of Echalens, belonging to Berne
and Friburgh: these two cantons alternately send a bailif,
who resides at Echalens, and remains in office during five
<PB N="418" REF="446"/>
years. When Berne appoints the bailif, an appeal lies from
his decisions to the sovereign council of Friburgh; and to
the government of Berne, when he is nominated by Fri∣burgh.
By these means a great check is laid upon the ex∣actions
of the bailif: and I am informed, that justice is no
where more equally administered than in these common
bailliages of the two cantons.</P>
<P>PERHAPS one of the most beautiful and finest positions in
Switzerland is the castle of St. Barthelemi, the seat of Count
d'Affry, colonel of the Swiss guards; and now inhabited by
his son, count Louis d'Affry, to whom I was indebted for a
most kind and friendly reception. This antient family-seat
stands on an eminence in the bailliage of Echalens, about
three miles from Orbe, near the high road which leads from
Lausanne to Yverdun. The sides of the eminence are fea∣thered
with wood; and below are rich fields and meadows
of the finest verdure, watered by two lively torrents which
unite and form the Falun. Upon the high road, the count
has reared an obelisk, on which he has inscribed, in the
true spirit of toleration and forbearance, the following words,
“<HI>Praise God, all ye nations,</HI>” in the English, Latin, French,
and German languages.</P>
<P>THE castle commands a prospect of a most fertile and
well-wooded country, gently broken into hill and dale; on
one side appears a distant view of the Jura and the hills of
Burgundy and Franche Comté; and, on the other, the
horizon is bounded by the rugged alps in the canton of
Berne and in the Vallais, by Mount Velain, the highest point
<PB N="419" REF="447"/>
of St. Bernard and Mont Blanc, whose superior elevation
above the surrounding heights is such, that its summit reflects
the rays of the rising sun several minutes sooner, and retains
those of the setting sun several minutes later than any of the
circumjacent mountains.</P>
<P>FROM St. Barthelemi we descended into the plain, which
stretches to the lake of Yverdun. This plain was formerly
covered as far as Entreroches (three leagues from its present
position) and probably further, by that lake: it is now, for
a considerable part, a great swamp. Within a quarter of a
mile of the town, are warm baths which are strongly sulphu∣reous,
and much frequented during the summer months.
Yverdun is large, airy, and well-built with stone, like the
towns in the Pays de Vaud; it stands near the lake, in a small
island formed by the two branches of the river Thiele. Be∣tween
the town and the lake there is a pleasant lawn extend∣ing
to the water, and planted with avenues of lime-trees.
Yverdun carries on scarcely any trade, and its principal sup∣port
arises from the passage of the merchandise between Pied∣mont
and Germany. This town is celebrated for its print∣ing-press,
established in the beginning of the present cen∣tury;
but entirely neglected until, some years ago, it was
renewed by <HI>Felice,</HI> a Neapolitan of learning and abilities.</P>
<P>THE lake of Yverdun, or of Neuchatel, stretches from
south to north about twenty miles in length, and in some
places about five in breadth. Its shores near Yverdun are
covered with country-houses. It is somewhat extraordinary,
that the dull and tasteless uniformity of the French gardens
<PB N="420" REF="448"/>
should have been adopted by the Swiss, whose country
abounds with noble and picturesque situations, and where
nature wantons in the most luxuriant varieyt. I have fre∣quently
observed, in the midst of the most romantic scenes, a
majestic forest sliced into regular alleys; and at the very
borders of the finest lakes, artificial pools of water edged
with sun-burnt parterres. Should any person, in this, accuse
me of national prejudice, let me exclaim with Voltaire, who
certainly cannot be convicted of partiality to the English:</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">GRANSON—NEUCHATEL—MR. PURY'S BENE∣FACTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>WE skirted the west side of the lake of Neuchatel
through Granson, the principal town of a bailliage
of that name, belonging to Berne and Friburgh, and re∣markable
for the battle in which Charles the Bold, duke of
Burgundy, was defeated by the Swiss in 1476. We entered
the principality of Neuchatel about six miles from that
town, and passed through St. Aubin, Boudri, Colombier,
lying pleasantly upon the borders of the water. The road
runs along the side of the Jura, through a country that re∣sembled,
in some measure, the district of La Vaux, between
Lausanne and Vevay: the sides of the Jura are almost the
whole way covered with vines, supported in many parts by
low stone-walls. The borders of this lake are more uniform
than those of the lake of Geneva; and do not rise into such
high, irregular, and grotesque alps as the coast of Chablais.
Towards Granson and St. Aubin, the country is more diver∣sified
with meadows and corn-fields; nearer to Neuchatel,
the summits of the mountains are clothed with forest, and
the midland and lower parts entirely planted with vines. Be∣tween
the lake and the Jura several rivers burst from the
rock in considerable streams; and, after turning several
mills, fall into the lake at a little distance from their source.
The largest is that of La S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rriere, near a small village of the
<PB N="422" REF="450"/>
same name, which we crossed in our way to Colombier, where
we dined with a family whose acquaintance we had formed at
the baths of Leuk. We passed a very agreeable day with
these amiable persons; by whom we were received with
that frankness and unaffected ease which characterises true
politeness.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner some musicians of the country performed
the <HI>Renz des vaches:</HI> that famous air which was forbidden
to be played among the Swiss troops in the French service;
as it awakened in the soldiers such a longing recollection of
their native country, that it often produced in them a settled
melancholy, and occasioned frequent desertion. The French
call this species of patriotic regret, <HI>la maladie du pays.</HI> There
is nothing peculiarly striking in the tune; but, as it is com∣posed
of the most simple notes, the powerful effect of its me∣lody
upon the Swiss soldiers, in a foreign land, is the less
surprising. Nothing indeed revives so lively a remembrance
of former scenes, as a piece of favourite music which we
were accustomed to hear amid our earliest and dearest connec∣tions:
upon such an occasion, a long train of associated ideas
will necessarily arise in the mind, and, if not totally selfish, melt
it into tenderness. To use the language of poetry,</P>
<Q><L>There is in souls a sympathy with sounds.</L>
<L>Wherever I have heard</L>
<L>A kindred melody, the scene recurs,</L>
<L>And with it all its pleasures and its pains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cowper's Task, book vi.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="423" REF="451"/>
IT is observable, that those who inhabit mountainous
countries are most subject to this <HI>maladie du pays,</HI> because
their habits of life are essentially different from the customs
and manners of other people. Accordingly, the Scotch high-landers,
and the Biscayans, as well as the Swiss, when absent
from their country, are peculiarly apt to be affected with
every circumstance that recalls it to their minds.</P>
<P>THE town of Neuchatel is small, and contains about 3,000
souls. It lies partly upon the little plain between the lake
and the Jura, and partly upon the declivity of that moun∣tain:
in consequence of which situation, some of its streets
are very steep. At the commencement of the present cen∣tury,
commerce was almost wholly unknown in this town;
as the ridiculous pride of its being deemed degrading, gene∣rally
prevailed among the inhabitants. The senseless preju∣dice
is now, however, nearly extinguished. The chief article
of exportation is wine, produced from the neighbouring
vineyards, and much esteemed. Manufactures also of print∣ed
linens and cottons have been established with success: and
within these few years, several merchants have raised large
fortunes.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="postscript">
<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>Oct. 3, 1786.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THE mildness of the government, and the general well∣being
of the inhabitants, are visibly demonstrated from the
increase of population among the natives, and the prodigious
<PB N="424" REF="452"/>
influx of settlers. The number of souls in the principality
of Neuchatel and Vallengin being, in 1752, only 28,017 sub∣jects,
and 4,318 aliens, amounted, in 1784, to 31,576 subjects,
and 9,704 aliens, which gives an increase of near a fourth
part within the space of thirty-two years. The facility of
acquiring the burghership of Neuchatel, has also prevented
any decrease of its inhabitants. Thus the magistrates, be∣tween
the years 1760 and 1770, admitted forty-one burgh∣ers;
from 1770 to 1780, forty-six; from 1780 to 1785, fifty∣one;
in all, a hundred and thirty-eight. Many of these set∣tlers
had children before they purchased the burghership;
and thirty-eight were foreigners, either German, French, or
Swiss. Several public works and buildings have been lately
executed at Neuchatel, at an expence far exceeding the re∣venues,
or even wants of this little state. Amongst others I
shall mention a superb causeway leading towards the valley
of St. Imier, an alms-house and a town-house, which is
built of such solid materials, as if it was intended to survive
to the most distant posterity, and to rival the duration of the
much-famed Roman capitol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Capitoli</HI> IMMOBILE <HI>saxum.</HI> Virgil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE person, to whom the burghers of Neuchatel princi∣pally
owe the embellishment of their town, is Mr. David
Pury, late banker of the court at Lisbon. He was a citizen
of Neuchatel, and was born in 1709: his father was mayor
of Lignieres, afterwards colonel and justice of peace in South-Carolina,
and founder of Purisburgh. Having received his
education in his native town, he quitted it, as some say, in
<PB N="425" REF="453"/>
great poverty, and repaired to Geneva, where he passed his
apprenticeship, but in what house, or in what trade, the
person, who obligingly furnished me with these anecdotes,
does not mention. From Geneva he went to London, and
acted as one of the clerks to an eminent jeweller, where he
acquired a great skill for estimating at sight the value of
diamonds. After a long residence in England, he established
himself in Lisbon, and carried on a very extensive com∣merce,
particularly in brazil-wood and precious stones.
Being appointed court-banker, he rapidly increased his for∣tune.
This generous man, however, did not, with a parsi∣mony
not unusual in persons who have enriched themselves
by commerce, consign his money to his cossers, or sparingly
distribute his largesses; on the contrary, while living, he
remitted large sums of money to his native town; and being
unmarried, and having none but distant relations, left his
country his heir. The following is a list of the sums which
he gave away, either in charitable donations, or for the im∣provement
of Neuchatel.</P>
<P>FROM the year 1771 to 1786, £. 100 annually for the poor
of Neuchatel, and the same sum for those of Vallengin,
which, for fifteen years, amounts to £. 3,000. Different
sums at various periods, and for divers uses, to January
1785, amount to £. 15,900. To this must be added the pur∣chase
of near 7,000 tickets in the lottery towards raising a
fund for building and endowing an hospital; which tickets
he also presented to the said hospital. He died on the 31st of
May 1785; and the remains of his fortune, bequeathed to
his country, after the payment of a few legacies, does not
<PB N="426" REF="454"/>
fall short of £. 160,000, which, together with the contribu∣tions
in his life-time, render his benefactions equal to al∣most
£. 200,000. His grateful country obtained from the
king of Prussia the title of baron in his favour; a title
which, through his singular modesty, he neither bore nor
used in the signature of his letters. The citizens of Neu∣chatel
have also placed the portrait of this generous bene∣factor
in one of the apartments in which government as∣semble;
and have ordered a marble bust to be executed for
the new town-house.</P>
<P>THE large legacy which Pury has bequeathed to the
town, being more than sufficient to complete the buildings
and public works, it would well become the wisdom of
government to employ part of the remainder, rather in use∣ful
undertakings, than in the construction of new edifices,
which are not wanted. With respect to those works, which
regard the health and convenience of the town, it may be
sufficient to hint, that the public walks, which are not much
neglected, might be improved; the streets, which are ex∣tremely
dirty, be cleansed; and the torrent, which traverses
the town, and threatens it with frequent inundations, may
be turned. But particularly an ample field is open for the
protection and encouragement of literature; for even in the
essential article of education this place is so deficient, that
it can scarcely be said to possess a single seminary; conse∣quently
the inhabitants, though endowed with lively parts
and good capacities, are much less informed than those of
the other Protestant towns in Switzerland. A new spirit may
be given to the study of the arts and sciences; and the semi∣nary
<PB N="427" REF="455"/>
may be rendered of great public utility by appointing
two or three professors for the instruction of youth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It gives me pleasure to add, that the members of the government of Neuchatel seem worthy of the trust which has been committed to them. They have cleansed the town, improved and beautified the pub∣lic walks; augmented the salaries of the clergy and professors, and have instituted a seminary for the education of youth.</NOTE> Thus
future generations, enlightened by means of this bene∣faction,

joining in their grateful commemorations those magistrates,
who first opened the sources of science and literature, and
taught them to flow for the improvement of a distant

<OPENER><DATELINE>Neuchatel, <DATE>Sept. 11.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM charmed with an expedition to the summit of the
Jura; and will give you a short account of it, while the
impression remains warm upon my mind.</P>
<P>THE principality of Neuchatel and Vallengin, stretches
from the lake to the limits of Franche Comté; containing
in length, from north to south, about twelve leagues, and
about six in its greatest breadth. The district of Neuchatel
occupies all the plain, together with the lower parts of the
mountains: while Vallengin is totally enclosed within the
Jura. Parallel chains of the Jura run from east to west, and
form, in the most elevated parts, several valleys. The lower
grounds of this chain are arable lands and vineyards: the
higher consist of large tracts of forest, which in many parts
have been cleared, and converted into considerable pas∣tures,
intermixed with fields of barley and oats. But the
singular genius and industry of the numerous inhabitants,
particularly demands the attention of every curious traveller.</P>
<P>WE passed through <HI>Vallengin,</HI> the capital of the district
of that name; a small open burgh, with a modern castle
built on some antient ruins. We then crossed the <HI>Val de Ruz,</HI>
which contains above twenty villages, situated at the foot of
<PB N="429" REF="457"/>
the mountains which border the valley: the inhabitants in
general are employed in agriculture, some few excepted,
who follow occasionally the mechanical arts. We arrived
about mid-day at La Chaux de Fond, a large handsome vil∣lage
lying in a broad valley which reaches the Franche
Comté: from thence we proceeded to Locle, through a con∣tinued
range of pleasing cottages, which skirt both sides
of the road; and are scattered likewise over the country.
As these two little towns or villages carry on the same com∣merce;
I shall comprehend them both under one common
description.</P>
<P>LA Chaux de Fond and Locle, together with the districts
belonging to them, may contain about six thousand inha∣bitants,
remarkably distinguished for their genius, industry,
and skill in the mechanical arts. They carry on an exten∣sive
traffic in lace, stockings, cutlery, and other merchandise
of their own manufacture: but watch-making, and every
branch of clock-work, are the articles in which they parti∣cularly
excel. They not only make every instrument em∣ployed
in those arts, but have invented several: and all sorts
of workmen necessary for the completion of that branch of
business, such as painters, enamellers, engravers, and gild∣ers,
are found in these villages; where, upon an average,
about forty thousand watches are yearly made. The genius
and industry, indeed, observable upon these mountains, ex∣hibit
a scene uncommonly pleasing. As every individual is
sure, not only of obtaining a comfortable maintenance for
himself, but also of soon placing his children in a way of pro∣curing
their own livelihood; the people marry very early.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="458"/>
NOT many years ago, the greatest part of these valleys
was almost one continued forest; but the wonder-working
powers of industry have happily changed the scene into flou∣rishing
villages and fertile pastures. The increase of popula∣tion
will appear from the following fact: Formerly the pro∣duce
of the country was more than sufficient for the consump∣tion
of the inhabitants; at present, although considerably
more cultivated, it scarcely furnishes an eighth part of the
provisions necessary for interior consumption: the remainder
is drawn from Franche Comté. And no wonder; for beside
the natural effect of their frequent and early marriages;
every stranger who brings a certificate of his good behaviour,
is at liberty to settle, and to follow any trade without the
least restriction. Here, no apprenticeship is necessary;
nothing is contraband; and industry exerts herself untaxed.</P>
<P>BESIDE those particular arts I have already mentioned,
several inhabitants of Locle and La Chaux de Fond are well
skilled in other branches of mechanical science, and have
invented useful mathematical and astronomical instruments.
Among those who have eminently distinguished themselves
in this way, is the famous Jaquet Droz, who is now at Paris;
and whose son exhibited in England several automatical
figures of a very singular and surprising construction: one
played upon the harpsichord; another drew landscapes;
and, what is still more extraordinary, a third copied any
word presented to it, or wrote down whatever was dictated
by any of the company. These are certainly wonderful in∣ventions,
and seem to exalt the powers of mechanism; but
still they are mere toys, and an unworthy waste of great
<PB N="431" REF="459"/>
genius: it is Swift making riddles. How much more lauda∣bly,
and with equal success, might the same talents and ap∣plication
have been exerted in improving, or adding to,
those instruments and apparatus, which are necessary to the
astronomer and natural philosopher!</P>
<P>THE origin of watch-making in these parts, as related
by Mr. Osterwald, the historiographer of these mountains, is
extremely curious; and the truth of his account was con∣firmed
to me by several artists both of Locle and La Chaux
de Fond. In 1679, one of the inhabitants brought from
London a watch; which being out of order, he entrusted
it to Daniel John Richard, of La Sagne. Richard, after exa∣mining
the mechanism with great attention, determined to
attempt making a watch from the model before him: but
to this end he was destitute of every other assistance than the
powers of his own native genius. Accordingly he employed
a whole year in inventing and finishing the several instru∣ments
previously necessary for his purpose; and in six
months from that period (by the sole force of his own pe∣netrating
and persevering talents) he produced a complete
watch. But his ambition and industry did not stop here:
beside applying himself successfully to the invention of
several new instruments useful for the perfection of his
work, he took a journey to Geneva, where he gained con∣siderable
information in the art. He continued for some
time the only watchmaker in these parts; but business in∣creasing,
he instructed several associates; by whose assistance
he was enabled to supply from his single shop all the de∣mands
of the neighbouring country. Towards the beginning
<PB N="432" REF="460"/>
of the present century he removed to Locle, where he died
in 1741, leaving five sons, who followed their father's occu∣pation.
The knowledge and practice of the art gradually
spread itself, is now become almost the universal business of
the inhabitants, and may be deemed the principal cause of
the population observable in these mountains.</P>
<P>THE inventive genius of this mechanical people is not
merely observable in the above-mentioned articles, but dis∣covers
itself upon all occasions where it can be applied to the
purposes of their convenience and accommodations. To
give an instance: the rocks in most parts of the alps being
exceedingly hard and solid, the waters usually make their
way along their sides, and rush down in perpetual torrents:
but the strata which compose the Jura being less firm and
compact; the rains and melted snow penetrating into the
crevices, form subterraneous channels, and issue in rivulets
at the bottom of the mountains. Now the peasants, in order
to avail themselves of this peculiarity, have, in the midst of
these subterraneous channels, and with much labour, erected
mills, which are turned by the descending torrents. For this
purpose the builders have constructed wheels in places
where it seemed scarcely practicable: have invented new
modes of scaffolding, and a great variety of other ingenious
contrivances in order to facilitate their work. The natives
of these districts are exceedingly courteous to strangers who
visit their country. They are in general very well informed
in several branches of knowledge; and, as they usually em∣ploy
their leisure hours in reading, many of the villages con∣tain
circulating libraries. The houses are plaistered and
<PB N="433" REF="461"/>
white-washed; though small, are commodious and well-built;
and furnished with a degree of neatness, and even ele∣gance,
peculiarly striking in these sequestered mountains.
Such perfect ease and plenty reigns throughout these moun∣tains,
that I scarcely saw one object of poverty: the natu∣ral
effects of industry under a mild and equitable govern∣ment.
It is of these vallies, and of their inhabitants, that
Rousseau gives so enchanting a description in his letter to
D'Alembert.</P>
<P>THE rock which forms the base of the Jura, is mostly
composed of calcareous stone; and perhaps there is no spot in
Europe where are found so large a quantity of petrified shells
and marine plants in so small a space. Near Locle I observed
a ridge of hills, that seemed to consist entirely of <HI>pierres
arborisées,</HI> or stones bearing the impression of plants. In
returning, we had a most sublime prospect of the lakes
of Neuchatel, Bienne, and Morat, with the high and rug∣ged
chain of alps stretching from the cantons of Berne
and Friburgh, as far as the Vallais, and the mountains
of Chablais.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 47.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOVERNMENT OF NEUCHATEL.</HEAD>
<P>ON the death of the duchess of Nemours, in 1707, the
sovereignty of Neuchatel and Vallengin became va∣cant;
and being claimed by Frederic the First, king of
Prussia, as heir to the prince of Orange, his right was ac∣knowledged
by the states of the country. Upon his death it
descended to his son Frederic William, who transmitted it
with his other dominions to Frederic the Second.</P>
<P>THE constitution of Neuchatel is a limited monarchy.
The machine of this government is indeed actuated by such
nice springs, and its wheels are so exceedingly complicated,
that it is very difficult for a stranger to distinguish, with
any degree of accuracy, the prerogatives of the sovereign,
and the franchises of the people: particularly as some, even
of their most important privileges, depend upon mutual
acquiescence and immemorial custom, and not upon written
laws. I shall endeavour, however, to trace the principal fea∣tures
of this government; the result of my best inquiries
during my continuance at Neuchatel.</P>
<P>UPON the accession of Frederic the First a charter of
privileges, under the name of general articles, which in a
great measure established the prerogatives of the prince, and
the liberties of the subject, was signed and ratified by the
<PB N="435" REF="463"/>
king. Beside these general articles, which his present ma∣jesty
upon his accession promised to preserve inviolate;
others were added at the pacification of 1768, which finished
the dispute between the sovereign and subject. By this pa∣cification,
the king not only renewed his assent to the <HI>general</HI>
articles; but also explained them, wherever their tenor had
been mistaken; and expressly confirmed several other privi∣leges
in favour of the people, which had hitherto been equi∣vocal,
or not duly observed.</P>
<P>THE most important of these general articles are: 1. The
sovereign promises to maintain the Reformed religion as by law
established; and to tolerate no other sect, except within the dis∣tricts
of Landeron and Cressier, where the catholic religion is
dominant. 2. No person but a native of the country is capa∣ble
of holding any civil or military charge, excepting that of
governor, who may be a foreigner; and the same incapacity is
extended even to natives, who are in the service of a foreign
prince. 3. All the subjects have a right to enter into the service
of a foreign power; provided that power is not in actual war
against the prince, as sovereign of Neuchatel; and if the so∣vereign
should be engaged in hostilities, which do not concern
Neuchatel, that state may continue neuter, except the Hel∣vetic
body should be involved in the contest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The latter clause of this article is not so clearly worded as it might have been; from a delicacy, I suppose, of not express∣ly stipulating, that the state of Neuchatel and Vallengin may oppose their sovereign by arms, in case the Swiss should be engaged in any war against him. It is evident, how∣ever, that they consider their connection with the Helvetic body, as of superior ob∣ligation to that with their prince, as sove∣reign of Neuchatel and Vallengin.</P>
<P>The remarkable clause in question is as follows:
Et qu'en outre et conformément à des ar∣ticles exprés et formels des franchises tant de la bourgeoisie de Neufchâtel que de celle de Vallengin, cet Etat ne puisse étre engagé dans aucune guerre, ni les sujets d'icclui obligés d'y marcher, que ce ne soit pour la propre guerre du Prince, c'est à dire, pour la defence de l'Etat, et pour les guerres que le Prince pour∣roit avoir en tant que souverain de Neufchatel et non autrement: en sorte que s'il avoit guer∣re pour raison de quelque autre Etat, terres et seigneuries, l'Etat de Neufchatel ne soit point obligé d'y entrer; mais en ce cas devra demeu∣rer dans la neutralité, à moins que tout le corps Helvetique en géneral n'y prit part et in∣térét.</P></NOTE>. 4. Justice
<PB N="436" REF="464"/>
shall be equitably administered: and, for this purpose, the
three estates of Neuchatel and Vallengin shall be annually
assembled. 5. The magistrates and officers of justice, in∣stead
of holding their employments during pleasure, shall
enjoy them during their good behaviour. And, by the late
pacification it was further agreed, that the prince is not
himself the judge of their good behaviour; but that in order
to be deprived of their places, they must be fully convicted
of malversation in office, by certain judges at Neuchatel ap∣pointed
for that purpose. 6. The sovereign shall take the
accustomed oath upon his accession; and promise to main∣tain
all the rights, liberties, franchises, and customs, written
or unwritten.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that one of the most essential rights of
the subject, depends upon immemorial usage; for, that
“the sovereign shall be considered as resident only at Neu∣chatel,”
is in the number of their unwritten immunities.
Now this privilege, in conjunction with the third article just
cited, forms the basis of their civil liberty. By the former,
the prince, when absent, can only address his subjects
through his governor and the council of state; and no sub∣ject
can be tried out of the country, or otherwise than by
<PB N="437" REF="465"/>
judges appointed by the constitution; by the latter, should
the king of Prussia be at war with all Germany; the people
of Neuchatel and Vallengin are by no means obliged to arm
in his defence; but individuals may even serve against him,
so long as the powers whom they serve, are not engaged in
hostilities against their country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Henry duke of Longueville, and sovereign of Neuchatel, was, in 1650, sent to the castle of Vincennes, Felix de Mareval, captain of the Swiss guards, kept guard in his turn, though he was citizen of Neuchatel, at the door of the prison, in which <HI>his sovereign</HI> was confined.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BESIDE these general articles, that comprehend the privi∣leges
of the people at large; there are others which the sove∣reign
is equally bound to maintain, relating to the town of
Neuchatel and the district of Vallengin, in particular. The
prince confers nobility, nominates to the principal offices of
state, both civil and military, and appoints the chatelains and
mayors, who preside in the courts of justice. His revenues,
which are very moderate, and scarcely amount to £. 5,000 a
year, arise from certain demesnes; from a small land-tax;
from the tythes of wine and corn; and from the tenth of the
value on the sale of immoveables. With regard to com∣merce,
no subject pays any duties either of importation or
exportation, except for foreign wines imported into the town
of Neuchatel.</P>
<P>DURING the absence of the prince, he is represented by a
governor of his own appointing; who enjoys considerable
honours, but is extremely limited in his authority. He con∣vokes
the three estates, presides in that assembly, and has the
<PB N="438" REF="466"/>
casting vote when the suffrages happen to be equal: he en∣joys
the power also, in criminal cases, of pardoning, or of
mitigating the sentence. In the governor's absence his place
is supplied by the senior counsellor of state.</P>
<P>THE three estates of Neuchatel, from the superior tribu∣nal
of this country, and receive appeals from the inferior
courts of justice. They are composed of twelve judges, di∣vided
into three estates: the first consists of the four senior
counsellors of state, who are noble; the second, of the four
chatelains of Landeron, Boudry, Val de Travers, and
Thielle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principality of Neuchatel is di∣vided into a certain number of districts; some of which are denominated <HI>chatellaines,</HI> and others <HI>mayoralties.</HI> The chiefs of the former are called <HI>chatelains,</HI> and of the lat∣ter <HI>mayors:</HI> in every other respect their office and their power is the same.</NOTE>; and in case of absence, their place is supplied by
the respective mayors in the principality of Neuchatel, ac∣cording
to a regulated order; the third is composed of four
counsellors of the town of Neuchatel. The judges in the
first and second division hold their places for life; those in
the third and appointed annually. This body ordinarily as∣sembles
every year in the month of May; but is convoked
extraordinarily upon particular occasions: the town of Neu∣chatel
is always the place of meeting. These three estates
are not the representatives of the people; nor do they pos∣sess
the legislative authority. They are, properly speaking,
the supreme court of judicature, which receives all appeals,
and decides finally all causes, even those relating to the so∣vereignty
of the country: a power which they exercised in
<PB N="439" REF="467"/>
the year 1707, upon the extinction of the direct line in the
person of the duchess of Nemours.</P>
<P>IT may be here not unworthy of remark, that the three
estates decided the famous cause of the succession in 1707,
as a process between the several claimants of the sovereignty.
But if (in failure of claimants) a new sovereign was to be
chosen, or a new form of government to be established; this
would no longer be considered as amenable to a court of ju∣dicature:
the question would then come before the people
assembled by means of their representatives.</P>
<P>THE council of state is invested with the ordinary admi∣nistration
of government, superintends the general police,
and is entrusted with the execution of the laws. The mem∣bers
nominated by the sovereign are not limited to any par∣ticular
number. The prince exercises his authority by
means of this council, in which he is always considered as
personally presiding: and the power of the president is only
to convoke the assembly, to propose the subject of their con∣sideration,
to collect the votes, and to decide when the voices
are equal. The ordinances of this council are previously
communicated to the <HI>ministraux</HI> of Neuchatel, who are to
certify, that they contain nothing contrary to law.</P>
<P>THE town of Neuchatel enjoys very considerable privi∣leges:
it has the care of the police within its own district,
and is governed by its own magistracy, consisting of a Great
and Little Council. I will not trouble you with a detail of
the several departments; but I cannot omit mentioning the
<PB N="440" REF="468"/>
<HI>ministraux;</HI> because the members of that body form the
third estate on every act of legislation. The <HI>ministraux</HI> are a
kind of committee from the council of the town, and are en∣trusted
with the administration of the police. They consist
of the two presidents of that council, four master-burghers
drawn from the Little Council, and the <HI>banneret</HI> or guar∣dian
of the people's liberties. The six former are changed
every two years; the banneret is chosen by the general
assembly of the citizens, and continues in office during
six years.</P>
<P>THE legislative authority is divided in so complicated a
manner, that it would be no easy task to determine precisely
where it absolutely resides: perhaps the following account
of the persons concerned, and of the forms observed, in en∣acting
and promulgating laws, may somewhat assist in clear∣ing
the difficulty.</P>
<P>As soon as the causes are decided by the three estates as∣sembled
in the month of May; the four judges, who form
the third estate, retire; and their place is supplied by the
four <HI>ministraux.</HI> The attorney-general then desires the
members of the three estates to take into consideration, whe∣ther
it be necessary to frame any new laws. When a new
ordinance is proposed; a declaration is drawn up, and deli∣vered
to the council of state for their deliberation, whether
it is contrary to the prerogatives of the prince, or to the
rights of the subject: from thence it is communicated to the
council of the town, in order to be examined, whether it in∣sringes
the privileges of the citizens. If adopted by the
<PB N="441" REF="469"/>
council of state, and the council of the town, it is proposed
to the prince for his approbation or rejection: in the former
case, it is again publicly read before the three estates; and
the governor, or president, declares the approbation of the so∣vereign.
It is then promulgated, or, as the expression is,
passed into a law by the three estates. Since the accession of
the house of Brandenburgh, the people of Vallengin are al∣ways
consulted upon the framing of a new law. For this
purpose the three master-burghers of Vallengin examine,
whether it contains any thing inconsistent with the fran∣chises
of that district; in which case they have the power
of remonstrating to the governor in council. From this de∣tail
it should seem, that the legislative authority resides con∣junctively
in the prince, the council of state, and the town;
that the people of Vallengin have a kind of negative voice;
and that the three estates propose and promulgate the laws.</P>
<P>EVERY year, at the conclusion of the assembly of the
three estates of Neuchatel, those of Vallengin, as constituting
the supreme court of judicature for that country, meet at
Vallengin, and decide finally all appeals from the inferior
courts of justice. The <HI>first</HI> of these three estates is formed by
the same four noble and senior counsellors of state, who sit in
the first of the three estates of Neuchatel; the <HI>second</HI> by four
mayors of the county of Vallengin; and the <HI>third</HI> by four
members of the court of justice of Vallengin, nominated by
the mayor of Vallengin. The governor, or, in his absence,
the senior counsellor, presides, as in those of Neuchatel.
The three estates of Vallengin have no interference in any
act of legislation: the laws which have been framed or
<PB N="442" REF="470"/>
amended at Neuchatel, in the manner above-mentioned,
being simply remitted to them by the solicitor-general, and
publicly read before them. The people of Vallengin assem∣ble
every three years in an open plain, in order to elect their
three <HI>master-burghers,</HI> who are respectively chosen from the
inhabitants of the burgh of Vallengin, of the Val de Ruz,
and of the mountains. The function of these master-burgh∣ers
is to watch over the general interests of the people:
they are also in some cases deputed to Neuchatel by the peo∣ple,
whenever they are summoned by the governor and
council of state, in relation to any affair which particularly
concerns their county.</P>
<P>THE principality of Neuchatel and Vallengin is divided
into a certain number of districts, each of which has its cri∣minal
court of justice. The great circumspection observed
in the judicial proceedings, may sometimes favour the escape
of the criminal: but the few instances of atrocious crimes,
prove that this humane caution is no encouragement to
transgressors; and is a strong presumption of the general
good morals which prevail among the people. In a word,
personal liberty is almost as tenderly and as securely pro∣tected
by the laws of this country, as by those of our own
invaluable constitution. When the criminal is arrested, he
is immediately brought to trial: after which, the sentence is
read to him in prison. The next morning he again appears
before the judges, assembled in the <HI>open air;</HI> the former
proceedings on the trial are read, and the judges once more
deliver their opinion. In capital sentences, the governor is
instantly acquainted with the circumstances of the crime;
<PB N="443" REF="471"/>
and if he does not remit or soften the punishment, the sen∣tence
is immediately executed. I am concerned to add, that
<HI>torture</HI> (though seldom used) is not absolutely abolished.</P>
<P>SUCH are the general outlines of this remarkable consti∣tution,
by which the liberties of the people are as well, and
perhaps better, secured than even in the democratical can∣tons;
for, although the most despotic prince in Germany is
sovereign, his power is exceedingly limited. Among the
striking circumstances which characterise this government,
must be mentioned the very liberal encouragement given to
strangers, who settle in the country. They enjoy every
possible privilege of trade and commerce; and in no state
are fewer essential distinctions made between strangers and
natives. I have already observed to you, the good effects of
this enlarged policy on the population of Neuchatel and
Vallengin: whereas a narrower and more contracted prin∣ciple
in some of the neighbouring Swiss cantons, has oc∣casioned,
and continues to occasion, a very manifest decrease
of inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ROUTE FROM PONTARLIER TO NEUCHATEL—VAL∣LEY
OF TRAVERS—ANECDOTES OF ROUSSEAU—ISLE
OF ST. PETER, IN THE LAKE OF BIENNE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Neuchatel, <DATE>October 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I NOW write to you a second time from Neuchatel, at the
interval of nine years since the date of my former letters.
On the preceding occasion I went from Granson to Neu∣chatel;
to-day I came from Pontarlier, a small town in Bur∣gundy,
which is the usual route of those who enter Switzer∣land
on this side.</P>
<P>FROM Pontarlier I ascended gently by the side of the
Dou, here a small rivulet bubbling in the vale, quitted that
stream, and passed under a bold rock, on which stands the
castle of Joux forming a picturesque landscape. This castle
has a garrison of invalids, and commands the narrow valley
leading into Burgundy. Near it the road is divided into two
branches; one leads directly to Joigne, and the other to Neu∣chatel.
In about two hours we observed a stone, which
separates France from the county of Neuchatel. Soon after∣wards
we mounted an eminence, looked down upon the
beautiful valley of Travers; descended to a narrow pass,
which is guarded by a chain fastened to the rock, bearing
the date of 1722. History, however, makes mention of this
pass, and of a similar chain, at a much earlier period; parti∣cularly
<PB N="445" REF="473"/>
in 1476, when Charles the Bold, having ineffectually
attempted to force the pass, marched with his army to
Joigne, and besieged Granson, where he was defeated. Hav∣ing
descended to St. Sulpice, I visited the source of the Reus,
which issues at the foot of a rock in five copious springs,
that form a large body of water, and turn several mills. I
was accompanied to this picturesque spot by an inhabitant
of Fleurier, a neighbouring village: speaking of the in∣crease
of industry in these parts, he informed me, that about
thirty years ago Fleurier contained only three watch∣makers,
whereas at present above a hundred were settled
in that place. He added, that notwithstanding the con∣stant
influx of strangers, hands were still wanting for
the numerous trades, which are carried on with great suc∣cess
in these parts.</P>
<P>I CONTINUED along the high road leading to Neuchatel
through the beautiful and romantic valley of Travers,
watered by the Reus, abounding in the most fertile pastures,
bordered by hills gently rising from the banks of the river,
and beautifully sprinkled with wood. I travelled through
many neat villages, particularly Bouveresse, Couvet, Travers
which gives its name to the whole valley; and Noirague,
where I quitted the valley, and entered a narrow pass called
<HI>Clusette.</HI> From hence the road traverses an abrupt and
woody country along the sides of precipices, the Reus rolling
beneath in a deep channel. At the small village of Brot,
a pleasing view of the lake of Neuchatel and the adjacent
country opened gradually, as I descended, and joined the
road leading from Granson to Neuchatel.</P>
<P><PB N="446" REF="474"/>
I DID not quit the valley of Travers without paying a
visit to Moitier Travers, rendered memorable by the resi∣dence
of Rousseau, who being, in 1762, driven first from
Geneva, afterwards from Yverdun by the government of
Berne, found a refuge from civil and theological persecution
in this secluded valley, under the protection of Lord Keith,
governor of Neuchatel. The dwelling-house of this singular
man, is a small wooden building at the further extremity of
the village, near the road which leads to Fleurier, and is now
occupied by Mr. Martinet, mayor of the valley, a sensible old
gentleman, who lived in habits of great intimacy with the
philosopher of Geneva. The room chiefly occupied by
Rousseau, is a small bed-chamber, which, out of respect to
his memory, is left in the same state as when he lived there.
In a corner near the window, he had made a kind of recess
formed by two book-cases, and a simple deal plank which
reached from one book-case to the other, and on which he
was accustomed to write. Rousseau admitted company into
this room; but into the recess he suffered no one to enter,
from a suspicion, that they would overlook his papers when
he was writing. He used also to frequent a small open
gallery in the front of the house, the extremities whereof he
had enclosed with planks, in which were peep-holes for the
purpose of reconnoitring those persons who came to visit
him, that he might give his orders whether they should be
admitted or refused. Here he walked and read.</P>
<P>DURING his residence at Moitier, from 1762 to 1765, by
frequently sauntering into the fields and neighbouring
mountains, he acquired a taste for the study of botany,
<PB N="447" REF="475"/>
which he never intermitted, and which he always styled his
peculiar delight. During this period of his life, he issued
from this secluded corner his <HI>Lettre à l'Archevêque de Paris,</HI>
his <HI>Lettres Ecrites de la Montagne,</HI> and some other works;
in which he displays those wonderful powers of invention
and description, that fascinating yet declamatory eloquence,
that glow and animation of style, that fondness for para∣doxes,
that reverence for the scriptures and yet those per∣verse
doubts of their authenticity, those liberal yet levelling
principles of government, that keenness of irony, and that
motley mixture of sophistry and argument, which checker
and characterise all his writings.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU, on his arrival at Moitier, appeared in a com∣mon
dress, but soon afterwards assumed an Armenian habit;
either, as he himself alledged, because that mode of clothing
was adapted to the disorder with which he was afflicted; or
from that affectation of singularity, which seems to have
marked his character, in every period of his life. Through
Lord Keith's intercession, the king of Prussia offered to
Rousseau a pension of £. 100 per annum, which he declined,
from his aversion to the least shadow of dependence; pre∣ferring
to copy music for his livelihood, rather than to ac∣cept
an obligation even from so great a sovereign; and he
used to boast, that he could daily earn a guinea by that oc∣cupation.
He took his repast usually alone; though he
would sometimes, but very rarely, accept an invitation from
M. Martinet to dinner or supper; and particularly when
Lord Keith passed a week at Moitier Travers for the purpose
of visiting him. On these occasions he was remarkably
<PB N="448" REF="476"/>
agreeable and lively; being naturally of a social disposition,
he conversed with great spirit and animation, and yet with as
much correctness, as if he was dictating for the press.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU seems to have trusted entirely to his own judg∣ment;
being so impatient of contradiction, that he would
never listen to the admonition of his friends, and seldom
asked advice with an intention of adopting it. Having
finished his celebrated Letter to the Archbishop of Paris, he
read it to a person, from whom I received the anecdote, and
demanded his advice relative to its publication. The person,
though struck with the fire and spirit of the raillery, yet
could not avoid representing to him, that his letter, however
forcibly written, would never make a convert of the Arch∣bishop;
that he would only be entangled in endless contro∣versies,
and draw upon himself much obloquy and ill-will.
“Your advice, returned Rousseau calmly, is a little too late;
it is already published:” and immediately presented to him
a printed copy of the letter, which he had just read to him
in manuscript.</P>
<P>HE derived from nature an extreme sensibility which
bordered upon weakness; he seems to have wanted one
proof of a great mind, that of receiving an obligation, and
to have possessed such pride and soreness of temper as ren∣dered
it impossible to serve him; for he frequently construed
a benefit into an injury. His extreme sensibility was irritated
and augmented by a troublesome and painful disorder, which
preyed upon his constitution, and at times rendered him
unfit for society. And to this complaint, in conjunction with
<PB N="449" REF="477"/>
that merciless persecution which he repeatedly endured,
should be attributed in a great measure the recluseness of his
life, and that suspicious mistrust which occasionally bordered
upon madness.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU had now continued three years at Moitier,
greatly delighted with his situation, when an unexpected
event induced him to quit a retreat, in which he wished to
pass the remainder of his days. This event has been va∣riously
related. Some authors assert, that the populace, in∣cited
by the minister of the parish, in consequence of the
scepticism displayed in his <HI>Lettres Ecrites de la Montagne,</HI> as∣sembled
in crouds, broke the windows of his house, forced
open the door, and entering his bed-chamber, treated him
with such violence that he escaped with difficulty; and, not
to become a martyr to his opinions, quitted the country.
Others on the contrary maintain, that neither the minister
nor the natives were exasperated against him; that his
housekeeper, the same person whom he afterwards married,
disgusted with the inhabitants, broke the windows, and per∣suading
her master, that he was in danger of being assas∣sinated,
so worked upon his apprehensions, that he quitted
Moitier the next morning; and as a proof of this assertion,
they affirm, that one of the stones found in the apart∣ment
was too large to have passed through the broken
panes of glass.</P>
<P>THE truth, however, seems to be, that his pride and
suspicious temper had rendered him obnoxious to many of
the inhabitants; that the scepticism and insidelity of his reli∣gious
<PB N="450" REF="478"/>
opinions, in his <HI>Lettres Ecrites de la Montagne,</HI> had
raised a party against him; that some of the people would
occasionally insult him; that the minister of the parish sum∣moned
him before the consistory; that he declined appear∣ing;
that the council of state at Neuchatel had proposed con∣demning
the above-mentioned publication, and had even ap∣plied
to the king of Prussia for that purpose. Frederic, in
an answer, which does honour to his head and his heart,
while he permitted them to use any precautions which might
tend to prevent the spreading of sceptical opinions, yet wisely
forbade all persecution, and ensured to Rousseau a secure re∣treat
at Moitier under his immediate protection. Before this
answer was returned, some of the populace, intoxicated with
liquor, threw stones against Rousseau's windows with such
violence as to penetrate into the kitchen, and to tear off the
plaister from the walls; but it is certain that none of these
stones did, or could, enter his bed-chamber, as that apart∣ment
was situated on the other side of the house. This
violence, however, exaggerated by the real or pretended
terrors of his housekeeper, was sufficient to alarm Rousseau;
on the next morning he retired from Moitier, and took re∣fuge
in the island of St. Peter.</P>
<P>THE island of St. Peter, sometimes called the island of La
Motte, and sometimes Rousseau's island, lies towards the
southern extremity of the lake of Bienne. To this delight∣ful
spot I made an agreeable excursion on the fourth of
October 1786, in company with the Rev. M. de Meuron, of
Neuchatel, and three English gentlemen. We quitted Neu∣chatel
in the morning; passed through St. Blaise and the dis∣trict
<PB N="451" REF="479"/>
of Landeron, and embarked at Neuville, a small town,
which, like Bienne, acknowledges the bishop of Basle for its
liege lord, but possesses such rights and immunities as render
it an independent republic. It contains about twelve hun∣dred
inhabitants. The fine weather, and the clearness of
the air, enabled us to enjoy the mild beauties of the view as
we sailed to the island. To the south-west we discerned
Neuville and its antient castle, and to the south-east we
admired the Julimont, and insulated hill adorned with woods
of oak, the summit of which is frequently visited by travel∣lers
for the beauty of the prospect; and its name has been
derived by fanciful antiquaries from Julius Caesar. At the
extremity of a rocky and woody promontory, which stretches
from the foot of the Julimont into the lake, stands the castle
of Cerlier, and beyond, at some distance, the fertile plains
watered by the Thiele. We landed on the south-side of St.
Peter's island, and walked through an agreeable meadow
skirted with vineyards to a large farm-house, which was
formerly a convent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was secularised at the reformation.</NOTE>, and is now inhabited by the steward
of the general hospital at Berne, to which the island
belongs.</P>
<P>THE island is about two miles in circumference, and
richly wooded with various shrubs and trees, particularly
with large oaks, beech, and Spanish chesnuts. Its surface
is gently undulating; the southern shore, covered with
herbage, forms a gradual slope to the lake; the remaining
borders are sleep and rocky: in a few places their summits
<PB N="452" REF="480"/>
are thinly fringed with shrubs; in others their perpen∣dicular
sides are clothed to the water's edge with hanging
woods. The views from the different parts of the island are
beautiful and diversified; that to the north is the most ex∣tensive
and pleasing. It commands the lake of Bienne,
which is of an oval form: its cultivated borders spotted
with villages and castles, with the towns of Nidau and
Bienne standing on the farther extremity. Agreeable
walks are carried through the woods, and terminate at a
circular pavillion placed in the center of the island. During
vintage particularly, and on Sunday, which is the usual day
of festivity, the island is filled with parties who take refresh∣ments
at the farm-house, stray about the woods, or dance in
the circular building, and animate these romantic but so∣litary
scenes.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU occupied an apartment in the farm-house,
the only dwelling in the island. He lived with the steward
and his family, who are the present inhabitants. The
woman informed me, that he paid for his board and lodging
forty shillings a month, that he usually rose at six, dined
with the family at twelve, and after a slight supper retired
to rest at nine. She added, that he was extremely cheerful
and agreeable; conversed with the family with the greatest
ease and complacency, and conformed to their hours and
manner of living; that he amused himself entirely in wan∣dering
about the woods, and searching for plants, which he
used to explain to them with singular satisfaction. Rousseau
mentions his residence in this delightful island with the
highest terms of rapture, and his usual proneness to exagge∣ration.
<PB N="453" REF="481"/>
“I was permitted to remain only two months in
this delightful island; but I could have passed there two
years, two centuries, all eternity, without suffering a
moment's <HI>ennui,</HI> although my whole society consisted of the
steward and family, good but plain people. I esteem these
two months the most happy period of my life; and so
happy, that I could have passed my whole existence with∣out
even a momentary wish for another situation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Promenade V.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IF we examine in what this <HI>extreme</HI> happiness consisted;
he himself informs us, that his principal occupation was in
<HI>doing nothing.</HI> He did not even unpack his books, and
could scarcely prevail on himself to read, much less to
answer any letters. He assisted the steward and his servants
at work in the vineyards and fields; sauntered about the
woods, and gave himself up entirely to botany. He pro∣posed
to write a <HI>Flora Petrinsularus,</HI> or a description of
the plants in the island; adding on this head, that as a
German had published a book on the kernel of a lemon, in
the same manner he would compose a treatise on each
species of grass, moss, and lichen; and that he would not
leave the most minute particle of vegetation undescribed.
He made occasional excursions on the lake, sometimes
coasting the shady banks of the island; at other times suffer∣ing
the bark to float without direction into the middle of
the lake: then, to use his own expressions, “he would lie
down in the boat, look up to the heavens, and continue in
that posture for several hours, enjoying a thousand uncon∣nected
<PB N="454" REF="482"/>
and confused, but delicious reveries.” He frequently
rowed to a small sandy island, which he describes as a most
beautiful spot. It was one of his great amusements to peo∣ple
this little island with rabbits; and as he was conveying,
with <HI>great pomp,</HI> the steward's family to be present at the
foundation of this little colony, he describes himself as
<HI>equally elated with the pilot of the Argonautic expedition.</HI></P>
<P>FROM these simple avocations and <HI>every day</HI> occurrences,
which Rousseau relates with that enthusiasm and those sen∣timents
peculiar to himself, he draws the following sublime
morality. “I have remarked, during the vicissitudes of a
long life, that the most delightful enjoyments and most
rapturous pleasures, are not, upon recollection, those with
which I am most affected. Such fleeting moments of pas∣sion
and delirium, however rapturous, are, from their very
nature, but thinly scattered in the path of life. They are
too rare and rapid to constitute a fixed state; and the hap∣piness
which my heart regrets, is not composed of fugitive
instants, but consists in a simple and permanent state, with∣out
rapture, the duration of which increases the charm, till
it finds supreme felicity.”</P>
<P>THIS state he describes himself as possessing during his
short continuance in the island of Bienne; a longer residence
would probably have dissolved the charm, which was raised
by his own heated imagination. That restlessness of tem∣per,
which is usually the attendant of great genius, and
which was his inseparable companion, would have probably
returned, and embittered the delightful calm which he de∣scribes
<PB N="455" REF="483"/>
with such rapture and exstacy. But he had not time
to become disgusted with his situation: for the same into∣lerant
spirit which had hitherto pursued him, followed him
even to this sequestered island; and he had scarcely passed two
months, before he received an order from the government
of Berne to depart from their territories. Rousseau was so
shocked at this unexpected command, that he petitioned to
be imprisoned for life, only requesting the use of a few
books, and that he might be occasionally permitted to walk
in the open air. Soon after this extraordinary request, which
shews the extreme agitation of his mind, and which cannot
but interest every man of feeling, he reluctantly quitted the
island. It does not fall within the compass of a letter to dwell
upon this singular man through the subsequent events of
his life, or even accompany him to England, where, notwith∣standing
the most distinguished reception, the same perverse∣ness
of disposition, and the same excessive delicacy ren∣dered
him no less unhappy, than when he was under the
pressure of real calamities, and exposed to reiterated per∣secutions.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 49.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ENVIRONS OF MORAT—MOUNT VUILLY.</HEAD>
<P>IN our way to Morat and Avenches we crossed the river
Thiele, which issues from the lake of Neuchatel, dis∣charges
itself into that of Bienne, and separates the prin∣cipality
of Neuchatel from the canton of Berne.</P>
<P>MORAT is a bailliage belonging to Berne and Friburgh:
the reformation was introduced in 1530, by the majority of
voices, in presence of deputies from Berne and Friburgh.
The free spirit of the Swiss governments is in no in∣stance
more remarkably apparent, than by the mode which
they observed in embracing, or rejecting, the reformation;
as, in many other towns beside Morat, the question was put
to the vote; and the minority generally submitted, with
perfect acquiescence, to the decision of the greater number.
Morat stands pleasantly upon the edge of a small lake, about
six miles long, and two broad; in the midst of a well-culti∣vated
country. The lakes of Morat and Neuchatel are
parallel to each other, and separated only by a ridge of
hills: the former is the most elevated; for, it discharges itself
by means of the river Broye, into the latter. According to
Mr. de Luc, the lake of Morat is fifteen French feet above
the level of that of Neuchatel. Both these lakes, as well as
that of Bienne, formerly extended much farther than their
<PB N="457" REF="485"/>
present limits: and, from the position of the country, ap∣pear
to have been once united.</P>
<P>MR. PENNANT informs me, that “the vast fish called
the <HI>silurus glanis,</HI> or the <HI>saluth,</HI> which frequents the lakes
of Morat and Neuchatel, has not been caught here in the
memory of man. It is well described, and finely engraven,
in Doctor Bloch's History of Fishes, vol. i. 194. tab. 34.
In the time of Gesner two were taken, one of which was
eight feet long; but they are sometimes so large as to
weigh six hundred pounds. It is an eel-shaped fish, very
smooth, round and thick, and has a great head. The mouth
is furnished with four short, and two very long, whiskers.
It is very inactive and slow in its motions, and loves the
deep and muddy parts of the lakes. They are found in
many of the great fresh waters of Europe, and abundantly
in the Volga.”</P>
<P>ON my subsequent expeditions into these parts, I exa∣mined
with greater attention the environs of Morat, during
several days, which I passed most agreeably at Coujouvaux,
a seat belonging to the count of Diesbach, and at Grens with
M. de Garville, a French gentleman, who is so much at∣tached
to the beauties of this delightful country, that he
has built a villa in a pleasing situation near the banks of
the lake of Morat, where he comes every year from Paris to
pass the summer. By these families I was received without
any other introduction, than as being the author of the Letters
on Switzerland, and with that frankness and cordiality so
<PB N="458" REF="486"/>
flattering to a stranger. I found the environs of Morat,
though not so wild and romantic as many other parts of
Switzerland, yet extremely desirable for a constant resi∣dence.</P>
<P>I MADE several excursions across the lake, to an insulated
ridge between the lakes of Neuchatel and Morat, and en∣joyed
many delightful points of view. Of these various
prospects, the most remarkable is from the summit of Mount
Vuilly, where I seated myself on the edge of an abrupt pre∣cipice.
From thence I looked down upon the lakes of
Bienne, Morat, and Neuchatel; observed the Broye entering
the lake of Morat, issuing from thence and winding through
a marshy plain into the lake of Neuchatel; the Thiele flow∣ing
from thence, and hastening to fall into the lake of
Bienne; the fertile and variegated countries encircling those
bodies of water; and the grounds rising in regular gradations
from plains to alps. But what renders this charming spot
more particularly striking is, that it is perhaps the only
central point from which the eye can at once comprehend
the vast amphitheatre formed, on one side, by the Jura
stretching from the environs of Geneva as far as Basle,
and, on the other, by that stupendous chain of snowy alps,
which extends from the frontiers of Italy to the confines
of Germany, and is lost at each extremity in the im∣mense
horizon.</P>
<P>IMPRESSED with this sublime view, I cast my eyes down∣wards
over that dead and extensive morass through which
<PB N="459" REF="487"/>
the Broye serpentines; and cried out in the language of
poetry, which knows how to animate the dullest objects:</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">BATTLE OF MORAT—WAR BETWEEN THE SWISS
AND CHARLES THE BOLD, DUKE OF BURGUNDY—ITS
CONSEQUENCES.</HEAD>
<P>MORAT is celebrated for the obstinate siege it sustain∣ed
against Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy,
which was followed by the battle of Morat, fought on the
22d of June 1476. In this famous engagement the duke was
routed, and his whole army almost entirely destroyed, by the
confederate troops of Switzerland. Not far from the town,
and adjoining to the high road, a monument of this victory
still remains: it is a square building, filled with the bones of
the Burgundian soldiers, who were slain at the siege and in
the battle. To judge from the quantity of these bones, the
number of the slaughtered must have been considerable.
Among several inscriptions in the Latin and German lan∣guages,
relative to that memorable victory, I transcribed the
following on account of its conciseness:
<Q>Deo Opt: Max:
Caroli Inclyti et Fortissimi
Burgundiae Ducis Exercitus
Muratum obsidens ab Helvetiis
Caesus hoc sui Monumentum reliquit.
Ann: 1476.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="489"/>
THIS war, which Charles the Bold carried on against the
Swiss with a temerity peculiar to himself, forms a remark∣able
aera in the history of this country; and was attended
with some very extraordinary circumstances. From the
time of the famous revolution in 1308, which gave rise to the
Helvetic confederacy, to the end of the following century,
the Swiss republics deprived the House of Austria of all its
territories situated in Switzerland; and continued in posses∣sion,
notwithstanding the various attempts of the different
dukes to recover their lost domains. But of all the princes
of that House, Sigismond the simple, archduke of Austria of
the branch of Tyrol, was more particularly engaged in hosti∣lities
with the Swiss cantons, and their allies: for, his here∣ditary
dominions in Suabia and Alsace bordering upon Swit∣zerland,
induced him to enter more frequently into these
disputes, than the other branch, which was in possession of
the imperial throne.</P>
<P>IN the course of these hostilities, Sigismond was compelled
to cede a considerable part of his territories to the Swiss re∣publics;
particularly the rich country of Thurgau to the
seven cantons, which at that period composed the Helvetic
league<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Berne obtained the co-regency of Thurgau at the peace of Arau, 1712.</NOTE>. Inflamed by these repeated losses, and the humi∣liating
conditions of peace he was constrained to accept in
1468, he endeavoured to engage some of the neighbouring
powers in a confederacy against the Swiss cantons. Having
first ineffectually applied to Louis the Eleventh king of
<PB N="462" REF="490"/>
France, he at length addressed himself to Charles the Bold,
duke of Burgundy.</P>
<P>CHARLES having succeeded to the possession of Franche
Comté, Burgundy, Artois, and Flanders, together with the
greatest part of the United Provinces; possessed as ample re∣venues,
and as extensive territories, as the most potent sove∣reign
of his time. Magnificent, impetuous, and enterprising,
he neglected no opportunity of aggrandising his power, and
set no bounds to the projects of his restless ambition. He
had formed the plan of erecting Burgundy into a monarchy;
and had already in imagination appropriated to himself Lor∣raine
and part of Switzerland; which he proposed to annex
by conquest to his hereditary dominions.</P>
<P>A PRINCE of such a character being naturally well dis∣posed
to listen to any overtures, or to undertake any war,
that might advance his ambitious schemes, received with
eagerness the propositions of Sigismond; he flattered that
credulous prince with the hopes of receiving in marriage his
daughter Mary, heiress of his extensive dominions; and pre∣vailed
upon him, by the loan of eighty thousand florins, to
surrender Sundgau, Alsace, Brisgau, and the four Forest∣towns;
promising, upon the repayment of that sum, to re∣store
the provinces. By this alliance, Sigismond acquired a
sum of money to assist him in his preparations against the
Swiss; protected, as he thought, his hereditary dominions
from their enterprises; and secured a powerful ally against
the antient enemies of his family. The reverse, however,
<PB N="463" REF="491"/>
proved to be the event: for, by a strange fatality, this
league, which was intended to cement the union of the two
princes, served only to divide them; and occasioned the first
perpetual alliance between the Swiss cantons and a prince
of the House of Austria.</P>
<P>CHARLES, upon the conclusion of this treaty, informed
the cantons, that he had taken Sigismond under his pro∣tection,
and would defend him to the utmost of his power.
Meanwhile, the bailifs, whom he placed over his newly
acquired territories in Alsace, oppressed the people; laid em∣bargoes
upon the commerce of Mulhausen, a confederate
of the cantons; and withheld the rents of the estates be∣longing
to the Swiss in Sundgau and Alsace. These griev∣ances
being laid before Charles in an embassy, which Berne
dispatched to his court in the name of the confederate can∣tons,
the duke received it with haughtiness; and after com∣pelling
the deputies to kneel while they delivered their re∣monstrance,
dismissed them without an answer. This dis∣dainful
and ignominious treatment was ill brooked by a free
people, unaccustomed to crouch before the insolence of
power; and the warmth of their just indignation was still
more inflamed by the artful policy of Louis the Eleventh,
who, jealous of the duke of Burgundy's power, entered into
a defensive alliance with the Swiss republics, in order to
counteract the designs of that ambitious prince.</P>
<P>BUT Louis still further strengthened the Swiss, by effect∣ing
a reconciliation between them and Sigismond. The latter
had no sooner surrendered to Charles Sundgau, Alsace, and
<PB N="464" REF="492"/>
the other dominions, than he became sensible of his error.
The duke of Burgundy not only oppressed his new subjects,
but seemed determined, even should the eighty thousand
florins be repaid, to keep possession of these conditional terri∣tories,
and did not appear inclined to fulfil the promise of
bestowing his daughter upon the archduke. From these
considerations, Sigismond, induced through the mediation
of Louis, to throw himself under the protection of the Swiss,
concluded the famous treaty, which was confirmed at Lu∣cerne
in 1474, and is called the <HI>hereditary union;</HI> an appel∣lation
appropriated to the treaties between the Swiss and the
House of Austria. Sigismond renounced all right to the
provinces which the Swiss had conquered from the House of
Austria: the two contracting parties formed a defensive
alliance; and engaged to guarantee reciprocally each other's
territories. Thus the Swiss, after having deprived Sigismond
of all his possessions in their country, engaged to support
his title to those very provinces, which he had mortgaged
in order to strengthen his arms against themselves; and
Sigismond accepted a guarantee from the most inveterate
enemies of his family. This treaty, which entirely changed
the policy of the Swiss republics, was solely contrived by
the artful intrigues of Louis the Eleventh: the jealousy of
that designing monarch turned into another channel the
vast preparations of the duke of Burgundy; preparations
which would probably have been attended with more suc∣cess,
had they been directed against France.</P>
<P>CHARLES too late perceiving the imprudence of his con∣duct
towards the Swiss republics, in vain exerted all his
<PB N="465" REF="493"/>
efforts to engage them in a neutrality. They rejected his pro∣posals
of reconciliation with firmness, prepared, with their
usual vigour, for a war, which now appeared inevitable, and
even advanced the eighty thousand florins to Sigismond,
who demanded the restitution of his lands, which the duke
of Burgundy evaded under various pretexts. Charles
having concluded a separate peace with Louis, turned his
whole force against the Swiss, entered their country with an
army of sixty-thousand men; and, laying siege to Granson,
carried it by assault. But his success ended there: for, at
the subsequent battles of Granson and Morat, he was totally
defeated, and his attempts upon Switzerland entirely frus∣trated
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Charles entered Switzerland confi∣dent of subduing that country. The effect which this unexpected and humiliating dis∣appointment had upon his spirits and con∣stitution, is related by Philip de Comines, with his usual minuteness, in his Memoirs addressed to Angelo Cattho, archbishop of Vienne in Dauphiné. His account is curious, and will give some idea of the violent and impetuous character of Charles:</P>
<P>“His concern and distraction for his first deseat at Granson was so great, and made such deep impression on his spirits, that it threw him into a violent and dan∣gerous fit of sickness: for, whereas before, his choler, and natural heat was so great, that he drank no wine, only in the morn∣ing he took a little tisane, sweetened with conserve of roses, to refresh himself: this sudden melancholy had so altered his con∣stitution, he was now forced to drink the strongest wine that could be got, without any water. And, in order to draw the blood from his heart, some burning tow was put into the cupping glasses, and applied to his side. But this, my lord of Vienne, you know better than I; for, your lordship attended on him during the whole course of his illness, and spared no pains that might contribute to his reco∣very: and it was by your persuasion that the duke was prevailed upon to cut his beard, which was of a prodigious length. In my opinion his understanding was never so perfect, nor his senses so sedate and composed, after this sit of sickness, as before.”</P>
<P>Uvedale's Trans. Vol. I. p. 423.</P></NOTE>. Nevertheless, his restless and ambitious spirit still
unsubdued, impelled him to attack the duke of Lorraine.
But that prince, having engaged in his pay a body of eight
<PB N="466" REF="494"/>
thousand Swiss, obtained a complete victory, near Nancy,
over Charles, who was slain in the engagement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The death of Charles at the battle of Nancy, was attended with some very ex∣traordinary circumstances; for the parti∣culars of which, see the curious account, extracted from Philip de Comines, and the Chronique Scandaleuse of John de Troyes, in Wraxal's interesting Memoirs of the Kings of France of the House of Valois.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HIS death terminated this bloody war; in which the
Swiss gave the most distinguishing proofs of invincible va∣lour,
and spread the fame of their military virtues through∣out
all Europe, but from which they obtained no solid ad∣vantage
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">“And what,” says Comines, “was the occasion of this war? It was begun on account of a waggon of sheep-skins, which the lord of Romont took from a Swiss, who was passing through his ter∣ritories. If God had not abandoned the duke, it is not probable, that he would have put himself into so much danger for so trifling a circumstance; considering the offers that were made to him; against what sort of people he was engaged; and from whence neither profit nor glory could accrue to him. For, the Swiss were not in such repute, as they are in at present, and nothing could be poorer: insomuch that one of their ambassadors, as he was endeavouring to prevent the duke from engaging in that war, remonstrated; that he could gain nothing by attacking them: for their country was so barren, that the spurs of his troops and the bits of their horses were worth more, than could be furnished by all the Swiss territories, in case they were conquered.”</NOTE>. In fact, the principal and almost sole benefit
accrued to Louis the Eleventh; as, by the death of Charles,
he not only was released from a dangerous and enterprising
rival, but also annexed the rich provinces of Burgundy and
Artois to the crown of France. But, although the immediate
advantages which the Swiss derived from the death of
Charles, were unimportant; yet the consequences operated
very considerably on their future politics. Mary of Bur∣gundy,
the only surviving child and heiress of Charles, mar∣ried
<PB N="467" REF="495"/>
the archduke Maximilian, eldest son of the emperor
Frederic the Third, and afterwards emperor himself. By
this marriage, the House of Austria acquired possession of the
Netherlands; and having frequent disputes with France,
the alliance of the Swiss was strenuously courted by both
parties. Thus this country, being secured from all invasions,
acceded as occasion offered to the two rival powers; and as∣sisted
each party by turns, as the intrigues, or rather as the
subsidies, of the one or the other prevailed.</P>
<P>THESE intrigues gave rise to different alliances, contracted
with the House of Austria, the kings of France, the pope,
and the dukes of Savoy and Milan.—But, not to enter more
minutely into their history, I shall only observe in general,
that hitherto the Swiss had acted with great disinterestedness
in all their treaties, and had never taken the field but either
with a view to secure their liberties, or to drive their enemies
from Switzerland. It was about the period of the Burgun∣dian
war, that the subsidies which they obtained from Louis
the Eleventh, taught them the disgraceful arts of mercenary
politics; as the rich plunder which they took from the duke
of Burgundy gave, in some measure, the first taint to their
original simplicity of manners; till at length, <HI>Swiss vena∣lity</HI>
has become a proverbial expression.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANTIQUITIES OF AVENCHES.</HEAD>
<P>FEW antient towns have occasioned more controversy
among antiquarians, or given rise to such a variety
of conjectures concerning its origin and importance, as
Avenches, the principal burgh of a bailliage in the Pays de
Vaud. Some contend that it was the capital of all Helvetia;
because Tacitus calls it <HI>Aventicum gentis caput:</HI> while others
have endeavoured to prove, that by this expression the his∣torian
intended only to denote the capital town of its particu∣lar
district. Agreebly to some accounts, the city was built,
and a Roman colony founded, by Vespasian: with more
probability, according to others, it was only repaired and
beautified by that emperor, after it had been laid waste, and
almost ruined, by Vitellius.</P>
<P>WITHOUT entering into dry and uninteresting discus∣sions,
I shall simply relate, that it was formerly a very consi∣derable
town, and under the dominion of the Romans; as
appears not only from several milestones, found in many
parts of the Pays de Vaud, most of which are numbered
from <HI>Aventicum,</HI> as the principal place of reference; but
more particularly from the present ruins. I shall slightly
mention a few of these ruins, merely to shew you, that the
inhabitants do not boast of their antiquity without sufficient
evidence. We traced the site of the antient walls, which ap∣pear
<PB N="469" REF="497"/>
to have enclosed a space near five miles in circum∣ference.
The present town occupies but a very inconsider∣able
part of this ground; the remainder is covered with
corn-fields and meadows. One of the antient towers still
exists: it is a semicircular building, with the convex side
turned towards the town.</P>
<P>WE next examined a coarse mosaic pavement, discovered
some years ago in ploughing a field. Being now enclosed
by a barn, which is let to some peasants, the ignorant occu∣piers
are taking the most effectual method to destroy it, by
employing it as a drying-house for tobacco, and by suffering
strangers to take away specimens. Even the government of
Berne was so insensible of its value, that they permitted the
count of Caylus to remove a pannel, containing the figures
of two Bacchanalians. This mosaic was the floor of an an∣tient
bath, and is about sixty feet in length and forty in
breadth: the general form is perfect; and although several
parts are broken and lost, yet from the present remains the
configuration of the whole may be easily traced.</P>
<P>THE pavement consists of three compartments: those at
each extremity are regularly divided into fifteen octagons,
eight small squares, and sixteen small triangles. Five of
these octagons in each compartment, represented human
figures in various attitudes, but chiefly Bacchanalian men
and women: the remaining octagons were composed of
three different patterns. The vacant parts between the octa∣gons
are silled with the small squares; and towards the out∣ward
border, with the small triangles. The middle compart∣ment
is divided into oblong pannels; in the largest of which
<PB N="470" REF="498"/>
is an octagon bath of white marble, of abotu six feet in
diameter, and a foot and a half deep: the sides of the
bath are ornamented with dolphins. Of these three com∣partments,
one is almost perfect; the others are very much
defaced. Each of the pannels is encircled with several bor∣ders
prettily diversified; and a general border encloses the
whole. Schmidt, in his <HI>Recueil d'Antiquités de la Suisse,</HI> in∣geniously
conjectures, from a <HI>glory</HI> which surrounds a head
of Bacchus in this mosaic, that it was wrought during some
part of the intervening age between Vespasian and Marcus
Aurelius; because that mark of divinity is not usual upon
any monuments of Roman antiquity prior to that period.
He adds, that the same kind of <HI>glory</HI> is observed upon the
head of Trajan in an antient painting at Rome; upon that of
Antoninus Pius on a medal; and on the arch of Constan∣tine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The arch of Constantine at Rome being partly formed from the Forum of Trajan, the architect improperly transferred the figures. This circumstance accounts for the <HI>glory</HI> observed round the head of Trajan, on the arch of Constantine, which has been supposed to have represented the head of Constantine.</NOTE>. He strengthens this conjecture, by further remark∣ing,
that the head-dress of a Bacchanalian woman represented
in this mosaic, resembles the head-dress on the medals of
the empresses Plotina and Sabina<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The curious reader will find in the <HI>Recueil,</HI> cited in the text, a very accurate de∣scription and engraving of this mosaic.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM thence we were conducted to the ruins of an an∣tient
amphitheatre, within the walls of the bailif's garden.
The general form and size of this building are tolerably
perfect, as also parts of the brick-walls which enclosed it. The
diameter of the arena was, as well as we could judge by pa∣cing
<PB N="471" REF="499"/>
it, about eighty yards; which must necessarily have
been an uncertain estimate: as a former bailif brought in a
considerable quantity of earth, in order to plant fruit-trees;
conceiving, I suppose, that good fruit was of more value,
than to be able to determine the precise extent of an antient
amphitheatre. Under a tower, partly built of Roman mate∣rials,
is a cell in which the animals were probably let loose
upon the arena. On the outside are still to be seen the re∣mains
of five dens: and the walls are adorned with several
pieces of rude sculpture considerably defaced.</P>
<P>NOT far from these ruins stands a large column of white
marble, about fifty feet in height, composed of large masses,
nicely joined together without cement; and near it lies a
considerable fragment of defaced sculpture, which seems to
have once formed part of the portal belonging to a magnifi∣cent
temple. At a small distance from this column, in the
high road, we observed a covnice of white marble, sculptured
with urns and griffins. As we walked through the town,
we remarked several other masses of cornice, ornamented
with sea-horses and urns; and some marble columns of
beautiful proportions.</P>
<P>ABOUT a mile from Avenches, near the village of Coppet,
on the other side of a little stream, which separates the
canton of Friburgh from that of Berne, are the remains of
a small aqueduct. They were discovered about fifteen
years ago, by the accidental falling of a sand-hill which co∣vered
the aqueduct. The outside is formed of stones and
mortar, and the inside of red Roman cement; the vault of
<PB N="472" REF="500"/>
the arch may be about two feet and a half high, and one
and a half broad. This aqueduct has been traced to the
east-side of the town, and also to near the marble column
before-mentioned. We were also informed that it extends
to the tower of Gausa, between Vevay and Lausanne: and
that, between Villarsel and Marnau, about four leagues from
Coppet, an arch of nearly the same dimensions is excavated
in the solid rock. But whether these several parts actually
communicated with each other, or indeed whether they
really exist, are facts which, (having only viewed those re∣mains
that are visible near this town) I must be contented
to rest on the credit of my informers.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="postscript">
<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I visited the ruins of Avenches in October 1786, I
had much satisfaction in finding, that the bailif, Mr. Tchar∣ner,
paid great attention to these remains, and particularly
to the mosaic. I could not avoid remarking to the bailif,
who politely favoured us with his company; that every lover
of antiquity must regret, his predecessors had not shewn the
same taste; as the ruins of Avenches would have been a
greater object of curiosity. Several excavations had been
lately made, at first by Lord Northampton, who has a house
in the neighbourhood, and continued at the expence of
Berne. A coarse mosaic pavement, a few fragments of walls
rudely painted, and some trifling remains of antient baths,
are the only vestiges of antiquity hitherto discovered.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TOWN AND CANTON OF FRIBURGH—POPULATION
—GOVERNMENT—SECRET CHAMBER.</HEAD>
<P>FRIBURGH was built in 1179, by Berchtold the
Fourth, duke of Zaeringen, who endowed it with consi∣derable
privileges. Upon the extinction of the male line of
the house of Zaeringen, in 1218<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The house of Zaeringen was descend∣ed from the antient counts of Alsace, by Berchtold count of Brisgau. His grandson, Berchtold the Second, built the castle of Zaeringen, situated near a village of the same name, not far from the present town o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fri∣burgh, capital of the Brisgau. Upon the demise of Berchtold the Fifth, the last duke, without male issue, his territories were di∣vided between his collateral heirs, the dukes of Teck, and his two sisters Agnes and Anne. Agnes married Egeno, count of Urach; by which marriage he obtained pos∣session of Friburgh in the Brisgau: his poste∣rity were called counts of Friburgh. Anne married Ulric, count of Kyburgh; their daughter Hedwige, was wise of Albert count of Habsburgh, and mother of the emperor Rhodolph the First.</NOTE>, Ulric of Kyburgh obtained
the sovereignty, in right of his wife Anne, sister of the last
duke of Berchtold the Fifth. It came by marriage into the
possession of Eberhard count of Habsburgh-Lauffenburgh;
who sold it to his cousin Rhodolph of Habsburgh, afterwards
emperor. During this period, a continual rivalship subsisting
between Berne and Friburgh, they were frequently engaged
in mutual hostilities: at length all differences were composed;
and the two cities, in 1403, entered into a perpetual alliance.</P>
<P>FRIBURGH continued under the dominion of the house of
Austria, and was concerned in all the quarrels in which that
<PB N="474" REF="502"/>
family was engaged with the Swiss republics, until the mid∣dle
of the fifteenth century; when, by a singular revolution,
it renounced all allegiance to the archduke Albert, and put
itself under the protection of the duke of Savoy. From this
aera it occasionally assisted the cantons against the house of
Austria; and in the war between the Swiss and Charles the
Bold, its troops had a share in the victories of Granson and
Morat. Soon after the battle of Morat, it became a free and
independent republic; and, in 1481, was admitted a member
of the Helvetic confederacy.</P>
<P>THE situation of the town, though not one of the most
beautiful, is certainly one of the most picturesque and wild
in Switzerland. It stands partly in a small plain, partly on
bold acclivities, on a ridge of rugged rocks, half encircled
by the river Sane; and is so entirely concealed by the cir∣cumjacent
hills, that the traveller scarcely catches the smallest
glimpse, until he bursts upon a view of the whole town from
the overhanging eminence. The fortifications, which con∣sist
of high stone walls and towers, enclose a circumference
of about four miles; within which space the eye compre∣hends
a singular mixture of houses, rocks, thickets, and
meadows, varying instantly from wild to agreeable, from the
bustle of a town to the solitude of the deepest retirement.
The Sane winds in such a serpentine manner as to form in
its course, within the space of two miles, five obtuse angles,
between which the intervening parts of the current are pa∣rallel
to each other.</P>
<P>ON all sides the descent to the town is extremely steep:
in one place the streets even pass over the roofs of the houses.
<PB N="475" REF="503"/>
Many of the edifices are raised in regular gradation like the
seats of an amphitheatre: many overhang the edge of a pre∣cipice
in such a manner, that on looking down, a weak head
would be apt to turn giddy; and an unfortunate lover, re∣pulsed
in his suit, might instantly put an end to his pains,
by taking a leap from the parlour window, without the
trouble of a journey to Leucate, or to the rocks of Meillerie.
But the most extraordinary point of view is from the Pont∣neuf.
To the north-west, part of the town stands boldly on
the sides and the piked back of an abrupt ridge; and from east
to west a semicircle of high perpendicular rocks is seen, whose
base is washed and undermined by the winding Sane, and
whose tops and sides are thinly scattered with shrubs and
underwood. On the highest point of the rocks, and on the
very edge of the precipice, appears, half-hanging in the air,
the gate of the town called Bourgillon: a stranger standing
on the bridge would compare it to Laputa, or the Flying
Island in Gulliver's Travels, and would not conceive it to be
accessible but by means of a cord and pulleys. In the midst
of the river I observed a large fragment of stone, which a
few years ago fell from the rocky heights, was carried under
one of the arches, and in conjunction with other frag∣ments
stopping the current, raised it more than ten feet
above its usual level, threatening the lower parts of the town
with a sudden inundation.</P>
<P>A TRAVELLER fond of wild and romantic scenery will
not fail to visit the Moulin de la Motte, and the valley of
Goteron. The Moulin de la Motte is a miller's dwelling,
hollowed in the midst of an impending rock; near it issues
<PB N="476" REF="504"/>
a small torrent, which turning the mill, falls within a few
paces into the Sane. This singular dwelling seems so far
removed from “<HI>the busy hum of men,</HI>” as to be rather
situated in a remote solitude, than within the walls of
a fortified town. Near it there is an ascent of four hun∣dred
steps to the Place des Fontaines, in the upper part
of the town.</P>
<P>THE valley of Goteron, which lies on the north-west of
the town near the bridge leading to Berne, takes its name
from the Goteron, a small rivulet that runs through it, and
turns several mills. This valley, extremely narrow and
above two miles in length, is bounded on each side by high
and overhanging rocks of sand-stone. M. Vernet, the cele∣brated
landscape painter, is said to have studied these rocks
with great attention; and frequently to have declared, that,
excepting those of Tivoli, he never saw any rocks whose va∣rying
tints had a more pleasing and harmonious effect. The
valley contains several mills; an iron foundery, where the
ore brought from Franche Comté is forged; and a manu∣facture
of printed linen and cotton, lately established by
some merchants of Neuchatel, under the protection and en∣couragement
of government.</P>
<P>THE houses of Friburgh, constructed with a grey sand∣stone
drawn from a neighbouring quarry, are neat and well∣built;
but the whole town has a dull and inanimate appear∣ance.
Among the few objects worthy of particular notice in
the town, are, the cathedral, an elegant Gothic edifice,
erected in the latter end of the 14th century, and remarkable
<PB N="477" REF="505"/>
for the height and solidity of the tower; the town-house, an
antient building, which formerly composed part of the palace
belonging to the dukes of Zaeringen; and also a lime-tree,
in the middle of the principal square. Tradition reports,
that this tree was instantly planted by one of the soldiers, the
22d of June 1477, on his return from the battle of Morat:
an emblem of Swiss liberty, which took deep root on the
memorable defeat of Charles the Bold; and thus remaining
firm against the conflicts of time, has continued to spread and
flourish, to the admiration and example of future ages.
The society of Friburgh is extremely agreeable; the gentry
are frank and hospitable, and blend French politeness with
great simplicity of manners. Dinner is usually served at
twelve; and supper seldom later than eight. I never ex∣perienced
a more cordial reception in any town of Swit∣zerland.</P>
<P>THE bishop of Lausanne, called here the bishop of Fri∣burgh,
resides in this city. He is appointed by the pope,
usually at the recommendation of the French court; and his
revenues, including a small pension from France, and from
the abbey of Hauterive, of which he was abbot, amount to
about £. 400 <HI>per ann.</HI> His diocese extends over the whole
canton, and part of that of Soleure. In all his acts and deeds
he signs himself Bishop and Count of Lausanne, and Prince
of the German empire. The present bishop, Bernhard of
Lenzburgh, is a man of letters, and an honour to his profes∣sion:
he is employed in preparing for the public a biogra∣phy
of the illustrious and learned men born in the canton of
<PB N="478" REF="506"/>
Friburgh, who have distinguished themselves, either in the
civil, military, or literary line.</P>
<P>THIS canton is entirely catholic. Its population in 1785
may be estimated from the following table:</P>

<P>THE sovereign power resides in the Great Council of Two
Hundred; comprizing the two Advoyers, the Chancellor, the
Grand Sautier, the Senate, or Little Council of Twenty-four,
the Sixty, from which body are chosen the bannerets and
principal magistrates, and the remaining hundred and twelve
members, who are simply denominated Burghers.</P>
<P>THE only persons capable of being elected members of
this sovereign council, and of course enjoying any share in
the government, are the <HI>secret</HI> burghers, or a certain num∣ber
of families divided into four <HI>bannieres,</HI> or tribes of the
town: they are called <HI>secret</HI> burghers, in order to distinguish
them from the other citizens, partly inhabiting the town,
and partly the twenty-four parishes in the environs. The
latter enjoy the right of appointing the advoyers, from cer∣tain
candidates proposed by the sixty, and of annually con∣firming
<PB N="479" REF="507"/>
the said magistrates. Hence many authors have
called this government aristo-democratical, but erroneously:
for, as the power of the people is confined to the act of
choosing and confirming the two advoyers; and as the su∣preme
authority absolutely resides in the council of two
hundred, necessarily supplied by a limited number of patri∣cian
families, the government is, in the strictest sense, a
mere aristocracy.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of troubling you with an uninteresting detail
of those points in which the government of Friburgh re∣sembles
that of the other aristocratical cantons, I shall confine
myself to those peculiar circumstances by which it is discri∣minated
from them. This difference may be principally said
to consist in three articles: 1. The <HI>blind ballot,</HI> or mode by
which several important offices are supplied, and particularly
by which the members of the senate and the sixty are
chosen. This mode of election was instituted in order to
prevent venality; and is too singular not to be distinctly ex∣plained.
The names of the candidates are placed privately
in a box, containing as many partitions as there are persons
who solicit the charge. Into each of these partitions the
electors throw in their suffrages as chance directs, without
knowing to whom they may happen to give their votes;
and the candidate who has the most of these casual ballots is
elected. 2. The clause which disables certain noble families
from bearing the o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice of banneret, or from being chosen
members of the <HI>secret chamber.</HI> These families are sixteen
in number: some were acknowledged noble, even as early
as the foundation of the republic; others successively ob∣tained
<PB N="480" REF="508"/>
titles of counts and barons from the foreign princes
to whom they were attached, and in whose armies they
had served. 3. But the most remarkable circumstance
which discriminates the constitution of Friburgh from that
of the other aristocratical cantons, is a committee distin∣guished
by the name of the <HI>Secret Chamber,</HI> which, though
not any public or responsible part of administration, is yet
the concealed spring that puts the wheels of government
in motion. As the prerogatives and operation of this <HI>se∣cret
chamber</HI> are in general but little known, and still less
understood; I flatter myself that it will not be uninte∣resting
to lay before you a concise account of its origin
and constitution.</P>
<P>THE <HI>secret chamber,</HI> forming a part of the council of
sixty, is composed of the four bannerets, who are recipro∣cally
chosen by the council of two hundred from the four
tribes; and of twenty-four members, who are appointed by
a majority of their own body: the former remain in office
four years; the latter continue for life. The <HI>secret chamber</HI>
assembles ordinarily four times in the year, or oftener if oc∣casion
requires: and is convoked by a banneret. The two
principal meetings of this body are between the Sunday be∣fore
St. John's day and the twenty-fourth of June; and
usually on the anniversary of the battle of Morat, for the
purpose of appointing the vacant places in the council of
two hundred; and on Tuesday in Whitsun-week, when they
supply the vacancies in their own body. Its origin is thus
traced in the records of the republic. From 1347 to 1387,
the three bannerets nominated twenty persons from each of
<PB N="481" REF="509"/>
the three tribes into which it was then divided; and these
sixty assembled on the Sunday before St. John's day, to esta∣blish
the Little Council and elect the treasurer; from hence
is derived the origin of the sixty, and of the assembly which
meets on the Sunday now called <HI>Secret Sunday.</HI> It consists of
the whole council of two hundred, excepting the advoyers
and senate, and is presided by the chancellor, the four ban∣nerets,
and the members of the <HI>secret chamber,</HI> who take the
places of the senators. This assembly reviews, confirms, or
censures, if necessary, the senators, the bannerets, and the
sixty; the members of each tribe retire, while their conduct
is examined and reviewed by the remainder. The same as∣sembly
fills up also the vacant places in the senate, and in the
sixty, by blind ballot.</P>
<P>IN 1387, the nomination of the sixty was transferred from
the bannerets to the assembly which met on the <HI>Secret Sun∣day:</HI>
and that assembly was also empowered to appoint the
Little Council, the treasurer, the sixty, and the remaining
members of the two hundred. By a charter of the same
year, four coadjutors, drawn from the sixty, were given to
each banneret: and it appears that these coadjutors were
chosen, in the same manner as the bannerets, separately by
each tribe: and this may probably be considered as the ori∣gin
of the <HI>secret chamber.</HI> A charter of the year 1392, con∣firms
the <HI>Secret Sunday</HI> in the right of nominating the sixty,
and confers on the bannerets that of choosing the <HI>prud∣hommes,</HI>
who accompanied them when they convoked the
people on St. John's day; and it is probable that the ban∣nerets
also appointed their coadjutors. This nomination
<PB N="482" REF="510"/>
took place, as at present, on the Tuesday in Whitsun-week.
The town being at that period only divided into three tribes,
the coadjutors were limited to twelve; and when a fourth
tribe was added, their number was augmented to sixteen. A
charter dated 1404 confirms, in many instances, these arrange∣ments;
but does not grant to the <HI>Secret Sunday</HI> the nomi∣nation
of the two hundred: a right at that time enjoyed by
the bannerets, who shared it with their coadjutors, or the
<HI>secrets;</HI> and thus is probably derived the power of appoint∣ing

by the bannerets and <HI>secrets.</HI> The same charter orders
the bannerets to assemble on Whit-Tuesday, in conjunction
with the sixty of the preceding year, for the purpose of
choosing four members of the sixty from each tribe, who
should accompany the bannerets when they convoked the
assembly of burghers and inhabitants on St. John's day;
and two additional members for convening the assembly
of <HI>Secret Sunday.</HI> Here then are six persons from each

and deliberations; an office which they continue to exer∣cise

<P>AS early as the beginning of the 15th century, the ban∣nerets
and <HI>secrets</HI> assembled at Christmas and Easter, for the
purpose of preparing and digesting such motions as were to
be laid before the Council of two hundred, which adopted,
modified, or rejected them. As the bannerets probably con∣tinued
<PB N="483" REF="511"/>
to employ the same coadjutors in convoking the as∣semblies
on St. John's day, and on <HI>Secret Sunday,</HI> the <HI>secret
chamber,</HI> composed of these twenty-four coadjutors, at length
became a permanent body, and enjoys the following prero∣gatives.
1. It convokes, in conjunction with the bannerets,
the people on St. John's day, and the assembly which meets
on <HI>Secret Sunday.</HI> 2. It prepares and draws up all the laws
and ordinances; enjoys the sole power of proposing in the
Great Council; and, by means of the bannerets, of putting a
negative on any motion, by affirming it to be contrary to the
constitution, without the necessity of proving that it is so.
3. It collects the votes in the election or confirmation of the
advoyer, at the meeting of the people on St. John's day, and
in the deliberations of the Great Council. 4. It fills up all
the vacancies in that Council; 5. Suspends, deposes, con∣firms,
and censures its members; 6. Confirms, or suspends
and deposes its own members; makes regulations for the in∣terior
administration of its own body; appoints the manner
of electing its own members, and filling up the vacancies in
the Great Council; 7. Fixes on the time for those elections,
and the sum of money which each member is permitted to
receive from those who are elected. 8. It can exclude all
candidates from being chosen members of the senate, of
the sixty, from the office of bailifs, and other important
charges; either by refusal to present, or by rejecting them
as incapable. All these prerogatives, founded on authen∣tic
documents, or immemorial usage, were confirmed by
the Council of two hundred, in 1606, 1623, and particu∣larly
in 1716.</P>

ALL affairs of government, and all debates in the national
assemblies, are carried on in the German language; and as
the French tongue is spoken in the greatest part of the can∣ton,
and particularly by the gentry, there are many mem∣bers
of the Great Council, who do not understand the de∣bates.
Such was the general form of government when I
first visited Friburgh in 1776; since that period it has under∣gone
some very important alterations, the substance of which
I shall communicate to you in the following letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 53.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ORIGIN AND SUPPRESSION OF THE LATE TROU∣BLES
IN THE CANTON OF FRIBURGH—CHANGES
IN THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE exclusive right of sharing in the administration
of affairs, enjoyed by a certain number of families, in
the aristocratical cantons, hath, in conjunction with other
concurrent circumstances, occasioned revolts in those of Zu∣ric,
Berne, and Lucerne, which have been quelled by the
interposition of the other Helvetic powers, and prevented
from again breaking out, by judicious regulations. Fri∣burgh
having exhibited a recent example of the same kind;
I have endeavoured to trace the origin and progress of those
intestine commotions, which have been followed by a consi∣derable
alteration in the form of government. Accordingly,
I now lay before you the result of my inquiries, impartially
drawn from repeated conversations with persons of both par∣ties;
from an attentive perusal of several publications written
during the course of the troubles; and from some curious
manuscripts, which it was my good fortune to obtain.</P>
<P>IN the latter end of April 1781, an insurrection suddenly
broke out in the bailliage of Gruyeres, a district in the south∣ern
part of the canton; the inhabitants whereof are ex∣tremely
jealous of their liberties, and zealously attached to
all the customs transmitted from their ancestors. Irritated
<PB N="486" REF="514"/>
by a few impolitic acts of government, by the petty vexa∣tions
of the bailifs; by the secularization of Val Sainte, a
convent of Chartreux; by the abolition of several fasts and
festivals; and excited by the artifices of Chenaux and Castel∣laz,
two designing leaders, they rose in open rebellion.</P>
<P>PETER NICHOLAS CHENAUX, the chief of the sedition,
was a native of la Tour de Treme, in the bailliage of Gruy∣eres.
This man was greatly embarrassed in his circum∣stances,
and highly exasperated against government, having
been arrested and imprisoned in 1771, for his disobedient and
turbulent conduct. He was in the thirty-eighth year of his
age, of a good figure and expressive countenance; and, being
a man of rude but popular eloquence, and of an overbearing
spirit, had obtained a considerable influence over the artless
inhabitants. His abettor, John Nicholas Andrew Castellaz,
was a burgher of Friburgh and advocate of Gruyeres:
versed in all the chicanery of the law, conversant in the his∣tory
and antient records of his country, and well acquainted
with the privileges of the people, he was the first to expose
the slightest oppressions of the bailif, and to remark where∣ever
government seemed to infringe their immunities, or
issued edicts contrary to long-established usages. Having a
loud voice, and vehement elocution, he was formed for po∣pular
assemblies. He was the person by whom Chenaux
was principally directed in all difficult emergencies; he drew
up the principal remonstrances which, exaggerating every
de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect in the constitution, tended to render government
odious, and to spread discontents among the people.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="515"/>
THESE two leaders having, in conjunction with other ac∣complices,
availed themselves of the public dissatisfaction,
and engaged a considerable number of adherents; held, in
the month of April 1781, regular meetings at Bulle. On
the 24th, in particular, they insinuated before a large assem∣bly,
that government had formed a design of imposing addi∣tional
taxes of a grievous nature, particularly on horned cat∣tle
and horses; and even of with-holding the annual present
of salt, which they shared with the burghers of Friburgh.
They represented, that the secularization of Val Sainte, and
the abolition of certain festivals, implied a settled determina∣tion
to overturn the religion of their ancestors: that the go∣verning
party had many enemies; that the despotism of the
secret chamber was held in universal abhorrence; that the
nobles were discontented, on account of their exclusion from
the principal charges of the commonwealth; that the
burghers and inhabitants of the twenty-four parishes were
jealous of the exorbitant rights possessed by the secret
burghers, to whom was exclusively confined the entrance
into the Great Council, and of course into the administration
of affairs, and the lucrative offices of government. They
added, that the time was now arrived, when they might ven∣ture,
with impunity, to petition for a redress of grievances;
a strong party in the capital was ready, on the first moment
of their appearance, to join them; and multitudes would re∣pair
from all quarters to the standard of liberty.</P>
<P>HAVING, by these and similar insinuations, increased the
number of their adherents, it was finally concluded, that, on
the 3d of May, they should secretly repair to the capital, and,
<PB N="488" REF="516"/>
assembling in the market-place, should force the arsenal;
that, having provided themselves with arms, they should se∣cure
the garrison, and constrain the Great Council to re∣dress
their grievances, and make those changes in the con∣stitution,
which could alone secure to the people a mild and
just administration.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the general ferment which pre∣vailed
among the people in the bailliage of Gruyeres, and the
number of persons concerned in this conspiracy; govern∣ment
received no notice of the plot, before the 29th or 30th
of April. On the first certain news of the intended insurrec∣tion,
the council of war, who immediately assembled on the
occasion, dispatched some troops to arrest Chenaux; but he,
having received information from one of his accomplices
who happened to be at that time in the capital, escaped to la
Tour de Treme; and, being joined by the most desperate of
his adherents, determined to take arms without delay. Hav∣ing,
by means of his emissaries, excited the spirit of rebel∣lion
among the people, who were informed, that Chenaux
had narrowly escaped an arrest for his patriotic attempts to
secure their immunities; he ventured to repair to Gruyeres,
where Castellaz had already collected a considerable party.
This advocate, having assembled a large body during the
night, expatiated, with much force and eloquence, on the
several grievances, using various arguments in favour of an
immediate revolt, similar to those which were urged on the
24th of April. He inflamed the populace to such a degree,
that they flew to arms at five in the morning, and imprison∣ing
the bailif, erected the standard of rebellion. The alarm
<PB N="489" REF="517"/>
being now given, Chenaux advanced to Posieux, which was
fixed upon for the place of general rendezvous; from
whence he addressed a letter to the magistrates of Fri∣burgh,
disclaiming all design of having recourse to vio∣lence,
and requiring only, that the petitions and remon∣strances
of the people should be taken into considera∣tion.
On the next morning he conducted about sixty of
his partizans to a height overlooking Friburgh, with an in∣tention
of surprising the city; but finding the gates shut, the
fortifications guarded, and not being joined, as he expected,
by the inhabitants of the twenty-four parishes, he retired
first to Posieux, and afterwards to Avry, where he expected
a reinforcement, which Castellaz and his emissaries were col∣lecting
in various parts of the canton.</P>
<P>DURING these seditious proceedings, the magistrates of
Friburgh were active in making preparations for the security
of the town. The council of war sat during the whole night;
a night of extreme terror and anxiety to many of the inhabi∣tants.
The account of the bailif's arrest, of Chenaux's escape,
and that he was stationed at Posieux, within two leagues of the
capital, with a corps of rebels whose number rumour exag∣gerated,
was no sooner divulged, than a general panic pre∣vailed.
The garrison scarcely consisted of more than fifty
soldiers, and those chiefly invalids; the fortifications were
weak and extensive; not more than two hundred burghers
could be mustered to defend the ramparts; and the insur∣gents
were supposed to possess a strong party even within the
walls. If in this moment of disorder, aided by the darkness
of the night, Chenaux could have attacked the town with a
<PB N="490" REF="518"/>
sufficient force, he might have carried it by assault. But the
first emotions of terror had no sooner subsided, than the be∣sieged
assumed a spirit and vigour adequate to the alarming
situation of affairs. They all ran to arms; the nobles, burgh∣ers,
and even strangers, crouded to the ramparts, and pre∣pared
for a vigorous defence. Their confidence was raised
by the arrival of some militia from Morat, who entered the
gates at nine in the morning, and by the expectation of more
effectual succours from the canton of Berne.</P>
<P>ON the preceding evening a messenger had been dis∣patched
to Berne, requesting immediate assistance. He ar∣rived
in that city soon after midnight: the advoyer d'Erlach,
in the 85th year of his age, instantly summoned the Sove∣reign
Council. “Gentlemen,” exclaimed the venerable
magistrate, “on other occasions you have a year to delibe∣rate;
you must now instantly act: Friburgh is besieged by
an army of rebels; let those who approve sending troops
to her relief, hold up their hands.” The members unani∣mously
assenting, the assembly broke up; and twelve
hundred troops were commanded to march without a mo∣ment's
delay. Before the close of the evening Major Rihi∣mer
entered Friburgh at the head of two hundred soldiers,
who passed unmolested through flying parties of the insur∣gents;
at midnight a hundred and fifty dragoons arrived,
and on the next morning eight hundred infantry completed
the reinforcement.</P>
<P>THE arrival of these troops inspired the magistrates of
Friburgh with perfect confidence and security, and saved
<PB N="491" REF="519"/>
the town from the most imminent danger. Nevertheless the
emissaries of Chenaux and Castellaz, ranging about the
country, sounded the church bells in the various towns and
parishes, exclaiming that their religion and liberties were
threatened with immediate annihilation. The rebel forces
were continually augmenting; they began to be joined by
many inhabitants in the environs of the town; and the
least success would have increased their number. Chenaux
had several emissaries within the city, and before mid-day
appeared before Friburgh at the head of above two thou∣sand
men; eight hundred of whom were provided with
muskets, the remainder with only clubs, or the first wea∣pons
which chance presented. Having occupied the
heights, he found his followers wavering and irresolute, and
struck with a general panic on receiving the news, that a
large body of troops from Berne had reinforced the garrison.
He posted his followers however in an advantageous situa∣tion,
waiting with considerable anxiety till his forces should
be increased, and an opportunity should present itself of
commencing hostilities, or of obtaining a general amnesty for
himself and his adherents.</P>
<P>IN this situation of affairs, Major Rihimer led a detach∣ment
of a hundred and eighty dragoons from one of the
gates; while lieutenant Froideville, at the head of seventy
foot and twenty dragoons, sallied from another. The Ma∣jor,
driving the besiegers from a height which commanded
the town, continued his march with an intent of attacking
them in front; and at the distance of about a cannon-shot,
reconnoitred eight hundred of the enemy drawn up in order
<PB N="492" REF="520"/>
of battle, but without artillery. The insurgents no sooner
observed the cannon planted against them, and perceived
that the commander was an officer of Berne, than they dis∣patched
repeated messengers to assure him that they had no
hostile intentions; that they were only collected to petition
for a redress of grievances; and entreated him to spare the
effusion of blood. Having received an answer, that he would
undertake to intercede in their behalf, if they would in∣stantly
lay down their arms, and deliver up Chenaux; they
agreed to the first point, but refused the second. The major
continued to enforce his demand, and gained time, until
lieutenant Froideville appeared unexpectedly in their rear.
The two commanders repeating their promises, that their
just remonstrances should not be neglected, the whole troop
surrendered themselves prisoners. Four of the principal
ringleaders being secured, the remainder, having delivered
in their names and places of abode, were permitted to retire
without molestation.</P>
<P>CHENAUX, either finding it impossible to excite his fol∣lowers
to sustain the attack, or being deficient in personal
courage, was among the first who betook themselves to
flight. Wandering from village to village, he was, about
midnight, observed near Posieux by Henry Rossier, one of his
principal accomplices. Rossier, willing to save his own life
by betraying his leader, seized him by the collar, reproached
him for having seduced the people into rebellion, and for his
cowardice in forsaking them; and then, with the assistance
of Chavaillat and Python, two other insurgents, took from
him a double-barrelled pistol, and was conducting him to
<PB N="493" REF="521"/>
Friburgh. Chenaux, however, suddenly disengaging him∣self,
drew out a knife, and, wounding Rossier in several
places, endeavoured to escape towards Posieux. But Cha∣vaillat
pursuing him, and Rossier snatching a musket from
one of his followers, soon overtook him, and summoned him
to surrender under pain of instant death. Chenaux, finding
no hopes of escaping, and deriving courage from despair, at∣tacked
Rossier with such inconsiderate fury, that he received
the assailant's bayonet in his breast, and expired on the spot.
The death of the leader, the voluntary surrender of his prin∣cipal
associates, and the flight of Castellaz, put an end to
this ill-concerted enterprise. Six hundred insurgents, the
only remains of the rebels, were on the next morning
observed hovering about the capital; but learning the fate
of their leader, and the surrender of the other troops, and
being attacked by a corps of grenadiers, they dispersed
without resistance.</P>
<P>BUT although the insurrection was thus suppressed, and
all parties had concurred in chastising rebellion; yet the spi∣rit
of discontent had spread itself with too great violence and
rapidity among all ranks of men, not to convince the rulers
of the state, that the seeds of the revolt lay deeper than ap∣pearances
seemed to suggest. For it was obvious, that the
petty vexations of bailifs, the abolition of unnecessary fasts and
festivals, and the seeming violation of a few trifling immuni∣ties,
however exaggerated by the artifices of the most design∣ing
leaders, could never have been sufficiently powerful to
excite the people of Gruyeres to the desperate extremity of
taking arms against their lawful sovereigns; had not go∣vernment
<PB N="494" REF="522"/>
been extremely unpopular; if several grievances
of an oppressive nature had not required to be redressed;
several odious restrictions to be removed; and several defects
in the constitution to be remedied. Influenced by these
considerations, government, in a manifesto issued on the
11th of May, after granting a general amnesty to all the in∣surgents,
excepting a few of the ringleaders, found it neces∣sary
to invite the subjects of all ranks and denominations to
present remonstrances, to make representations, and to peti∣tion
against grievances. About the same time the three
cantons of Berne, Lucerne, and Soleure dispatched deputies
to Friburgh, offering their mediation towards composing the
dissensions of the republic.</P>
<P>IN consequence of this manifesto, many petitions and re∣monstrances
were presented to the great council, either
claiming the renewal of obsolete rights, the removal of cer∣tain
restrictions, or the abolition of various taxes; demand∣ing
redress of grievances, and an amendment of the constitu∣tion;
or complaining of an infringement of popular fran∣chises.
As it would be needless to mention all the complaints
and plans of amendment which were dictated by the spirit of
party and the frenzy of innovation, I shall confine myself to
three principal points of dispute, which occasioned the most
violent altercations; and which would never have been com∣promised,
unless the three mediating cantons had powerfully
and effectually interfered: 1. The disqualification of the no∣bility
from the office of bannerets and <HI>secrets;</HI> 2. The exorbi∣tant
prerogatives and influence of the <HI>secret chamber;</HI> and
3 The exclusive privileges of the <HI>secret</HI> burghers.</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="523"/>
1. WITH respect to the first point in agitation, it may be
remarked, that the exclusion of the noble families from the
charge of bannerets and of <HI>secrets</HI> appeared sufficiently rea∣sonable,
as long as the government was democratical, and
the bannerets were, according to the antient charters, cho∣sen
from the people; and of course when neither they, nor
their coadjutors, the <HI>secrets,</HI> could be taken from the no∣bility.
But when the government was changed from a de∣mocracy
to an aristocracy, and the municipal administration
no longer subsisted; and particularly when the troubles
excited by the bannerets, in 1553, obliged the Council of
two hundred to transfer from the people to themselves the
right of appointing those magistrates; the disqualification of
the nobility, which was founded on democratical jealousy,
ought to have no longer subsisted. Their remonstrances
were therefore just, and would have been still more reason∣able,
if the troubles of the republic had not rendered them
dangerous.</P>
<P>2. As to the second point in question: the extensive
power and extraordinary influence of the <HI>secret chamber,</HI>
could not fail to create jealousies and discontents among all
ranks of men. For, on considering the detail of their prero∣gatives,
as laid down in the preceding letter, it must appear,
that although the members of that committee enjoyed no
positive authority in enacting or annulling laws; yet by
being the depositaries of the constitution, and the ultimate
framers of all decrees; by having the sole right of proposing,
and a negative on all the resolutions of the great council, no
motion could pass without their concurrence. It is also no
<PB N="496" REF="524"/>
less obvious, that the power of making regulations for the
interior administration of their own affairs, mysteriously con∣cealed
from the knowledge of the Sovereign Council, might
give rise to dangerous abuses; that the members of the
chamber eventually enjoyed, by the power of excluding
from all charges, that of nomination; that by appointing to
the vacancies in their own body it was to be feared, what in
effect happened, that an admission into the <HI>secret chamber</HI>
would be chiefly confined to a few families; that, as they
filled up all the elections in the Council of two hundred,
these elections would depend entirely upon a few persons
who possessed the greatest credit; and thus the government
would gradually but necessarily tend to a narrower oli∣garchy.</P>
<P>3. THE third point in debate, namely, the exclusive pri∣vileges
of the <HI>secret</HI> burghers, opened a much larger and
more dangerous field of contention. The demand of the
other burghers, that, according to the antient form of govern∣ment,
the right of being elected into the Great Council, and
consequently a share in the administration of affairs, instead
of being exclusively confined to the <HI>secret</HI> burghers, should
be also extended to them; seemed to militate against the
fundamental laws of the republic, and to involve a total
change in the very essence of the constitution.</P>
<P>THE remaining part of the year was employed in agitat∣ing
these points of dispute; which gave rise to many po∣litical
and historical discussions, and occasioned several
curious researches into the origin of the <HI>secret chamber,</HI> and
<PB N="497" REF="525"/>
the rise of the distinction between the <HI>secret</HI> and other
burghers. For the purpose of ascertaining these questions,
the popular party demanded access to the archives; but
met with delays and refusals on the part of government,
which considered such an inquiry as of dangerous ten∣dency,
and calculated to introduce factious innovations in
the state.</P>
<P>EXASPERATED by repeated refusals, the populace began
to shew signs of discontent, and to assemble in great crowds
at the place where Chenaux was put to death: they marched
in solemn procession, bearing crosses and colours, and
chaunting hymns and <HI>requiems</HI> in honour of this <HI>martyr</HI> (as
they called him) to the religion and liberties of his country.
These tumultuous meetings would probably have ended in
another insurrection, if the bishop of Lausanne had not for∣bidden
them, under pain of excommunication. Towards
the conclusion of the year, the deputies from Berne,
Lucerne, and Soleure, arrived at Friburgh, for the purpose
of composing the differences subsisting in the capital. These
deputies, in order to conciliate the burghers, who were no
less violent in favour of the nobles than in extending their
own immunities, prevailed upon administration to repeal the
disabling clause. With respect, however, to the other sub∣jects
of controversy; as they conceived it dangerous to entrust
the leaders of a heated populace with the records of govern∣ment,
which might be attended with projects of endless in∣novation;
they proposed, that the Great Council should
order a committee to draw up a declaration setting forth the
privileges and franchises of the burghers; and that for the
<PB N="498" REF="526"/>
future this declaration should be considered as a fundamen∣tal
code. But although these essential points were obtained,
yet so many subjects of altercation still remained, that for
some time all further plans towards finally composing the
differences were fruitless. The deputies repaired to Morat,
where they were employed, from the 25th of April 1782 to
the 25th of July, in hearing appeals, revising and consider∣ing
the arguments on both sides, and consulting on the
best methods to conciliate the two parties.</P>
<P>So greatly however were the burghers dissatisfied with
the chiefs of the aristocracy, that they formed a resolution to
refuse taking the annual oath of allegiance to the Great
Council; nor were they without great difficulty prevailed
upon, by the three deputies in person (who repaired to
Friburgh for that purpose) to perform the usual homage.
Displeased, nevertheless, with the deputies themselves, and
considering them as too partial to administration, they deli∣vered
a memorial; in which, after representing their griev∣ances,
they threatened to appeal to the general diet of the
thirteen cantons assembled at Frauenfield.</P>
<P>A MEASURE of so alarming a nature, and tending to pro∣duce
a very material change in the principles of the Helve∣tic
Union, was reprobated in the strongest manner by the
members of that confederacy. For it was urged (and with
great reason) that by introducing an innovation of such
public notoriety, the disputes between the respective govern∣ments
and their subjects would be liable to become more nu∣merous
and dangerous; and that in the end each canton
<PB N="499" REF="527"/>
would fall under the guardianship of the remainder. On
the other hand, what rendered the present crisis of affairs
still more alarming was, that the court of France, consulted
by several leading members in administration, had offered
her good offices towards composing the dissentions. And
although the three cantons had, with consistent dignity, de∣clared
against the intervention of any foreign power, and
that Friburgh on accepting such a mediation, should be ex∣cluded
from the Helvetic confederacy; yet it was to be ap∣prehended,
that on an increase of the troubles, the French
would find some pretext to interfere in the affairs of Fri∣burgh,
as they were actually engaged in those of Geneva:
and “woe upon that republic,” said the assertors of Swiss
independence, “in whose internal politics foreign powers
interpose.”</P>
<P>INFLUENCED by these considerations, the three mediating
cantons, anxious to bring matters to a speedy conclusion,
prevailed upon the ruling party to consent to several altera∣tions
in the constitution. At length, after various delays,
disputes, and conferences, the deputies published, on the
19th of June, a manifesto, declaring, that on an impartial
and diligent review of the various memorials and manifestos
on both sides, the assertions of the burghers were groundless,
and their demands unconstitutional; that the present form
of government had subsisted above two hundred years; and
that the supreme authority resided in the members of the
Great Council. To this declaration they added, that the
three cantons would defend and protect the existing form
of government, and would never permit an appeal relating
<PB N="500" REF="528"/>
to the amendment or alteration of the constitution, to any
other power than the supreme council of the republic, <HI>that</HI>
tribunal being alone competent to such questions. At the
same time they recommended to the government a repeal
of the disabling clause, which excluded the nobility from
the office of banneret or <HI>secret;</HI> to admit some new fa∣milies
into the <HI>secret</HI> burghership; to hear and redress any
remaining grievances; and to correct any defects in the
constitution.</P>
<P>THIS declaration, being accepted by government, was
read, on the 28th of July, to the burghers assembled in their
respective tribes; but several among them protesting formally
against it, the three principal ringleaders of this opposition
were banished, their protests disregarded, and tranquillity was
restored to the republic. Soon after this final pacification, the
Great Council passed several acts for the redress of griev∣ances,
removed some burdens and usages which had been
the object of general complaint, and amended the constitu∣tion
in the following points. 1. A perfect equality is esta∣blished
between the <HI>secret</HI> burghers; the antient nobles are
no longer disqualified from holding the office of bannerets or
<HI>secrets,</HI> but do not enjoy any precedence in consequence of
their titles, which in all acts and deeds within the canton of
Friburgh are omitted. In return, all the <HI>secret</HI> burghers are,
without distinction of persons, esteemed equally noble. 2. Six∣teen
new families have been admitted into the <HI>secret</HI> burgh∣ership,
which addition nearly completes the number of a
hundred families; and it is further enacted, that on the ex∣tinction
of any three families, an equal number of families

shall be elected without delay. 3. The vacancies in the
sixty, instead of being indiscriminately supplied from the
members of the two hundred at large, are now filled up ac∣cording
to seniority. 4. But the great and principal altera∣tion
in the form of government, respects the new constitu∣tion
of the <HI>secret chamber;</HI> which is changed in the follow∣ing
important points.</P>
<P>1. THE members of that committee, instead of being no∣minated
by a majority of voices in their own body, are now
taken from the sixty, and chosen by <HI>blind ballot.</HI> The candi∣dates
are no longer under the necessity of being presented by
a member of the <HI>secret chamber;</HI> but, on addressing them∣selves
to their banneret, the latter is obliged to deliver in
their names to the <HI>secret chamber.</HI> As each vacancy is sup∣plied
from the particular tribe in which it happens, this alter∣ation
must necessarily reduce the candidates to three or four:
in order, also, to prevent cabal or corruption, if there shall be
only one candidate, he is not necessarily elected; but it must
be decided by lot, whether he shall be chosen or rejected;
and if there should be a majority of ballots for the negative,
he must wait till the subsequent year, before he can have
another chance of being appointed. Each member, on his
election, shall pay no more than £. 1. 10<HI>s.</HI> to each banneret
and <HI>secret;</HI> and the money shall be delivered to the secretary,
and by him be equally distributed. 2. Neither father and
son, nor two brothers, nor more than two persons bearing the
same name, shall be admitted at the same time into the <HI>secret
chamber.</HI> 3. The members still retain the right of silling
up all the vacancies, in the Council of two hundred, with
<PB N="502" REF="530"/>
the usual provisions, that the candidates shall be twenty
years of age; and that the promotion shall take place every
two years. It is further decreed, that, on oath, under pain
of deprivation, no more, than 1200 crowns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of 25 bach each, the whole sum £. 171. 13<HI>s.</HI> 10<HI>d.</HI></NOTE> shall be received
for the nomination; and that the said sum, instead of being
solely appropriated to the person who is to appoint, shall now
be delivered to the secretary, to be by him equally dis∣tributed
among the four bannerets, when either of them
shall elect, or among the members of the <HI>secret chamber,</HI>
belonging to the tribe in which there is a vacancy, when the
turn devolves upon either of them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Each banneret to nominate the first vacancy in his own tribe, and then each <HI>secret</HI> by rotation, according to seniority, in his particular tribe.</NOTE>. It is moreover added,
that if the person presented by a banneret, or a <HI>secret,</HI> shall
be rejected by two-thirds of the chamber, another may be
presented; but if the second is rejected, the right of pre∣sentation
shall be transferred to the banneret, or <HI>secret,</HI> next
in rank of the same tribe. It is also stipulated on oath, that
all promises of exchanging presentations, or similar engage∣ments,
shall not be valid for the future; those only except∣ed,
which are now absolutely subsisting, and which concern
either a son of the contracting party, or a person whose name
is specified. 4. The power of excluding persons from the prin∣cipal
charges of government, is still reserved to them; but they
are exhorted to use it with great precaution and care. 5. The
interposition of a negative, exercised by a single banneret, is
no longer sufficient to reject a motion in the Great Council.
The opposition, in order to render it valid, must now be
sounded on a precise law, and unanimously approved by the
<PB N="503" REF="531"/>
four bannerets; but if one shall dissent, it is then referred to
the Council of two hundred, which shall decide, by a majo∣rity
of two-thirds, whether the negative shall be confirmed
or rejected. 6. The power of proposing, formerly vested
only in the <HI>secret chamber,</HI> is now extended to the members
of the Little Council and the sixty; and the mode of deli∣berating
on such propositions and motions, is attended with
forms more or less complicated, as the object is more or less
important. In all instances the laws are prepared and finally
drawn up by the secret chamber. 7. The <HI>secrets</HI> shall take
an oath before the bannerets as delegates of the Great Coun∣cil,
to obey all the ordinances of that assembly, and to ob∣serve
the present articles, without retrenching or adding to
them. And it is further ordered, that no alterations shall be
made in the present constitution of the <HI>secret chamber,</HI> unless
approved by three-fourths of their own body, and by two∣thirds
of the Great Council.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 54.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CHEESE OF GRUYERES—HERMITAGE NEAR
FRIBURGH.</HEAD>
<P>THE canton of Friburgh contains a small portion of
arable land, but abounds in pastures; and, accord∣ingly,
its principal articles of exportation consist in horned
cattle, cheese, butter, and hides.</P>
<P>THE cheese, well known under the name of Gruyeres,
which is exported in such large quantities, is made in a
chain of mountains about ten leagues in length and four in
breadth, extending from the bailliage of Schwartzenburgh
to the districts of Vevay and Aigle in the canton of Berne.
All the cheeses, though made in the same manner, are not of
the same quality; a difference probably arising from the di∣versity
of the soil, the same plants not groiwng at all heights;
and the lower pastures, called <HI>gites,</HI> not being in such high
estimation for their goodness as those in the most ele∣vated
situations.</P>
<P>THE whole district is divided into greater or lesser farms,
which the proprietors let out in leases of three or six years,
at the annual rate of 16 <HI>s.</HI> to £. 1. 10 <HI>s.</HI> during five months
for each cow, according to the nature or elevation of the
ground: the lower pastures, though not of the best quality,
are the dearest, because being sooner free from the snow,
<PB N="505" REF="533"/>
and later covered with it, they afford food to the cattle for a
longer time. Each farmer, having rented a mountain, hires
from the different peasants in the canton from forty to sixty
cows, from the 15th of May to the 18th of October: he pays
at the rate of £. 1. 6 <HI>s.</HI> to £. 1. 13 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI> per head; and each
cow upon an average yields from twenty to twenty-four
quarts of milk per day, and supplies two hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Each pound contains seventeen ounces and a fraction.</NOTE>
of cheese during the five months. On the eighteenth of
October the farmer restores the cows to the different proprie∣tors.
The cattle are then pastured in the meadows which
have been twice mowed, until the 10th or 11th of November,
when, on account of the snow, they are usually removed to
the stables, and fed during winter on hay and after-grass.</P>
<P>As the mountains in the canton of Friburgh afford pas∣ture
for at least 15,000 cows, it may be estimated that they
annually supply about 30,000 hundred weight of cheese fit
for exportation; beside 2,000 or 3,000 after their return from
the mountains, exclusive of a thinner sort, which is made in
various parts of the canton. The cheeses fit for exportation
weigh from forty to sixty pounds each, and are sold from
£. 1. 17 <HI>s.</HI> to £. 2 per hundred weight. Beside the cows which
are pastured during summer in the mountains, the canton
contains about 12,000 belonging to the several landholders,
which supply their families with milk. The buildings ne∣cessary
for making the cheeses consist of a <HI>chalet</HI> or cottage,
which contains a room with a furnace for the purpose of
boiling the milk, a cellar where the milk is preserved, and a
<PB N="506" REF="534"/>
stable for sixty or seventy cows; near it is a kind of dairy-room,
kept in an equal degree of temperature, where the
cheeses are every day turned and salted. The thickness of
the vat, in which each cheese is pressed, is about four
inches. The casks for exportation contain ten cheeses, ex∣cepting
those destined for Italy, which hold only three, in
order to be conveyed by mules across the Great St. Bernard.
The cheeses well packed up bear the transport into the most
distant countries; they ought to be kept in a damp place,
and frequently washed with white wine, for the purpose of
preserving them from insects. When the cows return from
the mountains, a species of cream-cheese is made in autumn,
and even in winter; it is much esteemed, and is dearer than
that of Gruyeres.</P>
<P>THE greatest part of the salt used on these occasions is
drawn from Franche Comté, a small quantity from Lorraine
and Bavaria, but its quality is much inferior. The consump∣tion
of the whole canton, for all purposes, is at least 20,000
hundred weight, of which 15,000 is drawn from Franche
Comté. A great number of mares, foals, and horned cattle,
are annually raised in the canton: the oxen of three or four
years old are sold in the canton of Berne, in the country of
Neuchatel, and in Franche Comté. Upon an average it may
be estimated that the canton of Friburgh supplies pasture
for 37,000 cows and oxen.</P>
<P>IN our route to Berne, we made a small circuit to the vil∣lage
of Neuneck, in order to see an hermitage, that lies
about a league from Friburgh; and which has been highly
<PB N="507" REF="535"/>
extolled by travellers on account of its singularity. It is
formed in the solid rock; and the chief curiosity consists in
its having been the work of two men: as such, it is an asto∣nishing
performance, but, in any other respect, is scarcely
worth visiting. In the last century a hermit scooped out a
hollow place in this rock, just sufficient to lie at his full
length: but his successor desiring a more commodious
mansion, hewed, in the heart of the mountain, a chapel, se∣veral
apartments, and stair-cases. The length of the whole
is above four hundred feet. One room is ninety feet long,
and twenty broad; the steeple of the chapel, if it may be
so called, is eighty feet high, and the chimney of the
kitchen ninety. The hermit who perforated this habitation
in the rock, was near thirty years engaged in the work.
What a waste of time and instustry! But such is the folly of
sequestered superstition, that, for want of more rational oc∣cupations,
it frequently has recourse to laborious trifles.
The situation of this hermitage is beautiful: the rock in
which it is cut, hangs over the river Sane, which meander∣ing
between two chains of hills covered with wood, fills all
the valley beneath. The present hermit is a German; and
with him lives an old soldier.</P>
<P>FROM this hermitage to Neuneck (at which place the
canton of Berne commences) the country is rich, and sinely
wooded; on our right we had a distant but sublime view of
the most rugged rocks, the snowy alps rising above them
and closing the prospect. The sun was now declining: the
various tints of the evening—the purple gleam upon the
naked rocks—and the rays of the setting-sun upon the gla∣ciers,
<PB N="508" REF="536"/>
which seemed to glow almost into transparency—cast
such a beautiful radiance over this magnificent scene, as
even the luminous pencil of Apelles himself, who is said to
have painted <HI>“quae pingi non possunt, fulgura &amp; fulgetra</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Plin. H. N. lib. 35. c. 10.</NOTE>,”
would in vain have attempted to imitate.</P>

<P>NEC silentio implicandum, quod sequitur. Toko quidam aliquamdiu
