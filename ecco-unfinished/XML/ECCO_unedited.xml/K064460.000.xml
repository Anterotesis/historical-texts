<HEAD>TO
Thomas Boucher, Es{que}</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not to be wonder'd
that Merit so exalted as
yours draws the Addres∣ses
as well as the Admiration
of the World: That which is
only singular is, that I have
attempted publickly to tell,
what all privately acknow∣ledge,
Your extraordinary Ac∣complishment
in those Vertues
which claim the Admiration
of all such as are qualify'd
for Judges of what is Ex-Excellent:
<PB REF="3"/>
So solid an Under∣standing,
so refin'd a Conver∣sation,
such Wit and Fire
in the Divertive Part, so
much Reason in the Seri∣ous,
so many undeniable Acts
of Generosity, back'd by so con∣siderable
a Fortune as yours,
gives us a just Expectation
that Time will produce Some∣thing
greater than has as yet
appear'd to the World.</P>
<P>A Capacity so extensive as
Yours, fits you for all things
that you can but think wor∣thy
of your Care; since what∣ever
you were pleased to un∣dertake,
you were always cer∣tain
to succeed in, and of be∣coming
entire Master of the
Subject you espous'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
This Capacity of Mind, that
fits you for a Judge of all
Things, brings before you these
following <HI>Memoirs,</HI> Written by
that Ingenious and deservedly
Admir'd Lady who was Au∣thor
of <HI>The Travels into</HI> Spain,
and of <HI>The Memoirs of the
Court of</HI> Spain. The Reputation
these <HI>Memoirs</HI> have in several
Editions gain'd abroad, made
us hope they would not meet
with a worse Reception here;
since tho' originally of our own
Growth, yet transplanted by
a foreign Hand, and one so
Excellent, made me not im∣probably
conceive Thoughts of
Success from the warm Sun∣shine
of the Court of <HI>France.</HI>
The Letters at the latter
end, are part of a Parcel that
was taken, as the Title says,
from an <HI>English</HI> Lady in her
<PB REF="5"/>
Passage to <HI>Holland:</HI> The Of∣ficer,
of whom I purchac'd 'em,
told me, that they were show'd
him by a Privateer Captain,
who desir'd him to let him
know what they were. The
Exchange happening immedi∣ately
after, the <HI>French-Man</HI>
not remembring to ask for 'em,
they remain'd with him. I
justly thought 'em so easie, so
natural and entertaining, that
knowing none to be offended
by them, I quickly resolv'd
them for the Press: But the
Translation of the <HI>Memoirs</HI>
swelling to a larger Bulk than
was imagin'd, gives me no room
to insert here the most beau∣tiful
part of them, which is
deferr'd till the next Term,
when they will be printed in
a small Volume by themselves.
And now, Sir, I hope for the
<PB REF="6"/>
Merit of the Offering you will
forgive the Offerer; whose
highest Ambition is to please
one on whom Nature and For∣tune
have agreed to bestow
their most darling Favours.</P>
<CLOSER>I am,
SIR,
With Respect,
Your most obedient,
and most humble
Servant,

<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF THE
English Court.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Cousin,</OPENER>
<P>THe Time I spent in <HI>London,</HI> and the
Intimacy I had with the Dutchess of
<HI>Richmond,</HI> and my Lady <HI>H</HI>—, fur∣nish'd
me with the Opportunity of being ac∣qainted
with the most agreeable Adventures,
and private Intreagues of the Court of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>The Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI> (who was the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Sister, and by Mar∣riage
nearly related to the King,) was ex∣tremely
Beautiful, and of a Mien and Presence
very Noble and Majestic. My Lady <HI>H—</HI> was
Sister in Law to the late Dutchess of—, by
her Marriage with the Lord <HI>H—,</HI> now Earl
of <HI>R—</HI> second Son of the Lord Chancellor
of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>You, who are not unacquainted with the
Dutchess of <HI>Mazarine,</HI> must allow her to have
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
Charms, that render her the most agreeable
of her Sex, which made her House the Ren∣dezvous
of all the Men of Wit and Quality,
and the Scene of all the News of the Town,
of Gaming, Entertainments, and all manner
of Diversions.</P>
<P>Monsicur St. <HI>Evremont</HI> was pleased to con∣tinue
to me that Friendship he had for my Fa∣ther,
and I having often seen the Dukes of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the Earl of St. <HI>Al∣bans,</HI>
and the Lord <HI>C—</HI> at my House in <HI>Paris,</HI>
introduc'd me into their Acquaintance;
Monsieur <HI>Barrillon</HI> our Ambassador was one
of my Friends, and <HI>Don Ped<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Ronquillo</HI> the
<HI>Span<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> Ambassador, and Count <HI>de Thun</HI>
the Emperor's Envoy paid me their Visits.
The Acquaintance of so many Persons of Di∣stinction
gave me opportunity of knowing
a thousand diverting Stories, of which I have
composed these <HI>Memoirs,</HI> and, according
to your Desire, put them into as regular
a Method as I could. I have concealed some
of the Ladies Names I was oblig'd to menti∣on,
being unwilling to injure them while I
have nam'd others, hoping what I speak in
their Favour, will counterballance what the
Malice of their Enemies should say against
them.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible to know the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
and not to allow him the Character
which his Perfections challenge from all his
Acquaintance: He was very handsome,
extreamly well made, and had an Air of
Greatness answerable to his Birth; he was
brave, even to a Fault, and expos'd himself
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
in the Service abroad, with a Courage not to
be excelled: As no Man had better Natural
Qualifications, so care was taken in his Edu∣cation
to give him all those that were to be
acquir'd by Art: He danc'd extreamly well,
and with an Air that charm'd all that saw him:
His Heart was always divided between Love
and Glory: He had in short all the Accom∣plishments
of a fine Gentleman: But it must
be allow'd that they were allay'd with too
much Ambition, which Passion engaged him
in an unhappy Undertaking, that brought
him to an End too untimely and unfortunate.</P>
<P>It is no wonder he was so much addicted
to Love, being the Son of <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d.
This Prince had many Mistresses, yet none
whom he so tenderly lov'd as Madam <HI>Barlow,</HI>
Mother to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI> she was so
perfect a Beauty, and so charm'd and tran∣sported
the King when he first saw her in
<HI>Wales,</HI> that amidst the Misfortunes which
disturbed the first Years of his Life and
Reign, he enjoy'd no Satisfaction or Plea∣sure
but in loving and being beloved by this
charming Mistress.</P>
<P>The Equipage he allowed her, the Care he
took to please her, and the Complaisance he
had for her were so exceedingly great, (this
being his first Passion, and he being in the
Bloom of his Youth, a time when the Heart
throughly possest with the Power of Love at∣tempts
every thing it is capable of for the Per∣son
beloved) made the World believe he had
promised her Marriage. This Error so agree∣ably
flattered the Vanity of the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
that tho' he was satisfy'd there was
nothing of Truth in the matter, yet he act∣ed
as if he was fully assur'd of its Reality;
and there were not a few who sooth'd him
in this mistake: And this surmise, joyn'd
with the tenderness the King express'd for
him, set a particular distinction betwixt him
and those other young Noblemen the King of
<HI>England</HI> had own'd.</P>
<P>The Personal Advantages of the Duke,
and the King's Favour, drew after him so
great a <HI>Levee,</HI> that the Presumptive Heir of
the Crown could not be treated with more
deference or respect: He possess'd the best
Places in the Government; was Rich, Young,
Gallant, and (as I have already said) the
Handsomest and best Shap'd of Men. It will
not after this appear strange, that many La∣dies
made it their business to engage his
Heart; this good fortune he was sensible of,
and knew how to make use of it, but never
had so delicate a taste of Love to be strongly
engag'd to any one in particular; he was inca∣pable
of confining himself to one Intreague,
there being hardly a day in which he got not
a new Mistress; and there appear'd more
Affectation and Vanity, than Love or Since∣rity,
in all his Intriegues.</P>
<P>The King thought it proper to fix him,
and pitch'd upon the Daughter of the Duke
of <HI>Buclei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh</HI> and Countess of <HI>Wembs,</HI> for his
Wife. She was the greatest Fortune in the
Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had all that was to
be wish'd for to make her agreeable; she had
Virtue, Wit, Riches, and Birth, and tho'
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
she was not extraordinary Beautiful, and a
little Lame, yet in the main she was very de∣sirable.
Perhaps had the Duke been oblig'd
to have been at the trouble of this Conquest,
and had he undergone the Fatigues of Love
and won her by his Merit and Assiduity,
he had esteem'd himself happy in obtain∣ing
her, but receiving her from the King,
without the expence of a sigh or a tear, that
which ought to have been his Felicity, pro∣ved
his greatest Inquietude.</P>
<P>He imagin'd his Liberty to be taken from
him, and that he should be oblig'd to keep
such measures with a Wife the King had im∣posed
upon him, that if ever she should have
any cause of complaint against him, the King
would always be Judge, and would not fail
to decide it in her favour: In short, he had
little inclination for the Yoke, <HI>Hymen</HI> had laid
on him, and he obey'd only in submission to,
and for fear of displeasing the King his Fa∣ther.
Marriages of this kind are not al∣ways
happy. The Duke thought it suffici∣ent
to keep a fair Correspondence with his
Wife, and as she had a great deal of Wit,
and could easily discover her Husband's In∣clinations,
so hers became less vehement,
and she contented herself, for her part, to
do her Duty, without being at the expence
of a fruitless tenderness.</P>
<P>The Duke being weary of this Confine∣ment,
resolved to deliver himself, by giving
his Heart entirely up to Love; and the Per∣son
he fixt on for this purpose, was one of
the Maids of Honour to the Dutchess of <HI>Y—,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
whose Youth and Beauty were equally char∣ming;
she had a Wit and Humour so spright∣ly
and engaging, that the Duke would have
been unwilling she should have chose any
other Master but himself, to have taught her
the Art of Love. The name of her Family
being of no use, I shall content my self with
calling her <HI>Emilia.</HI> The Duke lost no op∣portunity
of seeing and entertaining her,
but it was but seldom, by reason the Gover∣ness
of the Maids of Honour often interrupted
them, because she knew him a dangerous
Person to her Sex.</P>
<P><HI>One day this watchful Guardian being con∣fin'd,
by an indisposition, from attending
the Dutchess of—, who was to take the
pleasure of the Evening on the</HI> Thames, <HI>the
Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>would not let slip this fa∣vourable
occasion of conversing with</HI> Emilia;
<HI>and when every one in her Highness's Barge
had seated themselves, he plac'd himself near</HI>
Emilia, <HI>and, full of confusion, said to her,</HI>
I cannot <HI>(Madam)</HI> be content with my Destiny;
you will not love me! and I know you do not hate
the Earl of <HI>A—n.</HI> My Lord, <HI>(reply'd she,
blushing)</HI> those who pretend to give your Grace
this Information, have little acquaintance with
my Affairs. The Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> thinks not of
me, I know, he has a Mistress who deserves and
takes up all his Heart; and I could assure you,
were I capable of preferring one of your Sex before
another, my heart would determine in your fa∣vour.
What you tell me <HI>(reply'd the Duke)</HI>
would comfort me, could I be contented with a
Compliment; but I expect something more solid,
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
Ha! <HI>cry'd she, briskly,</HI> what more can you
desire? I desire <HI>said he, with a grave Air,</HI>
that you would Love me; can you give too much
in return of a Passion so violent as mine? Yes,
<HI>reply'd she,</HI> it is too much; and you are to
blame to ask it; and I were much more if I should
consent to your indiscreet Desire.</P>
<P>She spoke this with such a Grace, and
with so much Sweetness, that notwithstand∣ing
the Dutchess of <HI>M—</HI> was in the
same Barge, engag'd at play with her High∣ness,
he could not forbear seizing the hand
of <HI>Emilia,</HI> and kissing it with an exquisite
Transport. The Dutchess perceiv'd it, and
tho' her love was not so great as to cause a
Jealousie, yet she found he had too much
Passion for another, and too little Considera∣tion
for her.</P>
<P>Her vexation at this sight made her Eyes
sparkle with anger, which added to their
Lustre; but the Duke was so taken up with
<HI>Emilia,</HI> that he minded not his Wife.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> with several other
Persons of Quality who attended her High∣ness,
followed in another Barge, and notwith∣standing
the care he took to hide his uneasi∣ness,
it was impossible for him to remove his
Eyes from the Barge where the Duke and
<HI>Emilia</HI> were: He lov'd her entirely, but
conceal'd his Passion, because of the particu∣lar
Engagements he had with my Lady—.
This Lady was of the first Quality, and made
use of it so much in his favour, that with∣out
the share of Beauty and agreeable Wit
she was Mistress of, the Obligations she laid
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
on him were sufficient to create Love: But
Alas! when a Lover is retain'd only by
Gratitude, he is soon lost.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> thought of nothing but
how to interrupt the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and
<HI>Emilia</HI>'s Conversation. He had brought with
him a little Dog, well known to all the
Court; he took him in his Arms, and in
caressing him, let him fall into the <HI>Thames,</HI>
and presently cry'd out for help to save his
Dog. All the Ladies were concern'd at it,
especially my Lady—, who was in her
Highness's Barge, and who could not be in∣different
in what so much concern'd the
Earl.</P>
<P>One of the Watermen having sav'd the
Dog, my Lady—looking out on one side
of her Highness's Barge. <HI>Come, Come, my Lord,</HI>
(said she) <HI>and congratulate with us the saving
your faithful</HI> Melampus: <HI>Her Royal Highness's
gives you liberty.</HI> The Earl, who desir'd no
more but to get into her Highness's Barge,
presently got in, and having first paid his
Duty to her Highness, went and plac'd him∣self
by my Lady—, But being soon wea∣ry
of his place, by making a false Confident
of her, seeks a pretence to remove.</P>
<P>Do you not see <HI>(said he)</HI> the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth?</HI>
I have a great fancy to play him a trick.
And what wou'd you do, <HI>said she?</HI> I will in∣terrupt
the Conversation he has with <HI>Emilia;</HI>
and you will find it very diverting. You seem
to take but little satisfaction in my Company,
<HI>reply'd she, with a melancholy look,</HI> since
you wou'd quit me for so trivial matter Ha!
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
Do you think it a matter so trivial, <HI>said he,
all in confusion?</HI> Have you forgot Madam, a
thousand little malicious Tricks he play'd us at
<HI>Hampton Court,</HI> and can we do too much in
return to punish them? You are <HI>(reply'd she
coldly)</HI> more revengeful than me, or to speak
plainer, I am not so blind as you imagine; Go,
my Lord, <HI>(continu'd she)</HI> go to <HI>Emilia:</HI> Your
design of revenging your self of the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
is not for what happen'd at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI>
between him and us, but what rather hap∣pens
now between him and <HI>Emilia;</HI> you look on
him as a Rival, and a very dangerous Rival too.</P>
<P><HI>You are too suspicious, Madam,</HI> (cry'd the
Earl, forcing a tender look) <HI>you turn the most
innocent things into a Crime, and you render
(Madam) the Chains of Love so uneasy, by a
confinement so disagreeable, that it will be impos∣sible
to preserve them long entire: Methinks you
ought to depend more on my Fidelity, than to
quarrel with me for a little Gallantry.</HI> My La∣dy
—, whose heart was full of anger and
jealousie, rose briskly without returning any
answer, but she could not refrain Tears,
which she conceal'd with her Handkerchief,
as if her Nose bled, and to disguise it the
better, with her hand she threw a little wa∣ter
on her Face.</P>
<P>The condition she was in, had not so great
an effect on the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> as to hinder
his first design, but going towards <HI>Emilia,</HI>
and bowing, <HI>Am I not a troublesom Intruder,
Madam,</HI> said he, <HI>and will you not wish me
the same misfortune of</HI> Melampus? <HI>All the La∣dies
had the goodness to be concern'd at it, but
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
you, Madam, you alone were insensible of my un∣easiness.
Great cause of complaint</HI> (said the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> vex'd at this interrup∣tion)
<HI>your Dog is faln in the water, and</HI> Emilia
<HI>did not squeak! You ought, my Lord, to have
been satisfied at what my Lady—did.</HI> The
Earl would have return'd it after a man∣ner
that might have produc'd a quar∣rel,
had he not been with-held by many Con∣siderations;
for, reflecting he was in her
Highness's Barge, and that he had to do
with the Son and Favorite of the King, he
check'd the first motions of his Resentment,
and forgot, that, as the Son of the Duke of
<HI>Ormond,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> his Qua∣lity
was of the first Rank. <HI>Emilia is much
oblig'd to you,</HI> (reply'd the Earl to the Duke)
<HI>for giving your self the trouble of answering for
her, and the satisfaction you discover at her indiffe∣rence
for me. You quarrel with me,</HI> (interrup∣ted
<HI>Emilia,</HI> smiling) <HI>more out of a Capritio than
Reason. 'Tis yet some comfort to me</HI> (reply'd
the Earl) <HI>that you judge my Resentment stronger
than my Ʋnderstanding and</HI>—Here he
was interrupted by my Lady—, who had
in vain expected his return to her, having had
made a thousand Signs, of which he took no
notice: So that being unable to bear any lon∣ger
his conversation with her Rival, she cal∣led
him to shew him a Bracelet of Diamonds
which she said she had bought. It vex'd him
to leave <HI>Emilia,</HI> and he had not gone from
her, had he not fear'd his incivility to my
Lady—would have been too much taken
notice of.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="17"/>
So soon as he came to my Lady—,
who, after having mention'd her Bracelet,
added in a low voice, <HI>You will never forgive
me the separating you from an Object you take
so much delight in. No Object, Madam,</HI> (re∣ply'd
the Earl, with a forc'd Air, which was
too well perceiv'd by a Lady so discerning)
<HI>pleases me more than your Ladyship; but I must
confess I was willing to divert my self at the ex∣pence
of the Duke of</HI> Monmouth. <HI>I am much
mistaken</HI> (said she, briskly) <HI>if he does not di∣vert
himself at yours: I perceive in his Eyes so
much satisfaction, as easily gives room for this
conjecture: But</HI> (added she) <HI>do you observe
nothing, my Lord, in mine? Have you forgot
your Custom, of knowing by them my very Soul?
which if you look into, can you believe I can endure
so much Indifference and Infidelity?</HI> She look'd
on him in saying this, and as it is difficult to
sustain the Looks and Reproaches of a Person
forsaken, without a cause, and who notwith∣standing
ceases not to love, he blush'd and
was confounded: My Lady—for her
part, cast down her Eyes, and remain'd quite
lost in Thought, from which the Earl did
not hasten to recover her.</P>
<P><HI>During the confusion of these two Persons,
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>on his side had his
disquiet from the young</HI> Emilia: You can no
longer, <HI>said he,</HI> disown the Passion the Earl
of <HI>A—n</HI> has for you, and it is no difficult matter
to perceive what passes between you, and with what
care you endeavour to conceal it from me: Do
you think it an easie matter to deceive me?</P>
<P>That is what I never design to do, <HI>(answer'd</HI>
Emilia <HI>fiercely)</HI> and I have no desire to engage
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
your Inclinations more than they are; your fickle∣ness
would but ill agree with my temper, should I
be so weak as to give you any preference; and I
must declare to you, that you do not touch my
heart enough, to make me capable of deceiving
you. <HI>The Duke thought this answer so rude
that he was confounded, and knew not at
first what answer to return, but his Passion
soon overcoming his Anger, he put on a
complaisant and smiling Air;</HI> I see then <HI>(said
he)</HI> I must ask your pardon; the fair Sex has a
right of doing injustice, and ours have not even
the liberty to complain; but for all that, <HI>added he,</HI>
I have a favour to beg, which you must promise
me to grant it. I promise nothing <HI>reply'd</HI> E∣milia,
<HI>smiling,</HI> I will give you hopes and fears.
Ha! Madam <HI>interrupted the Duke</HI> banish
this error so common to your Sex, and so ill ground∣ed;
for my part, if any thing could disengage my
Inclinations, it would be the Rivals I meet in my
way. What reason have you, my Lord <HI>said</HI>
Emilia <HI>to him</HI> to distrust your merit; in my
opinion, a Person who deserves so much as your
Grace, should always triumph over his Rivals,
and never fear them. You endeavour in vain,
fair <HI>Emilia, reply'd he,</HI> to restore my peace
with so frail a comfort as Flattery. As I am
perswaded you are less a coquet than another, so
am I well assured you would be unwilling to lose
none of your Lovers, and I am not Master enough
of my Jealousie to suffer that without inquietude.</P>
<P>Her Royal Highness being with Child,
and finding herself indisposed, the Barges
were order'd to return sooner than was
design'd. As soon as they were come
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
to <HI>Whithall,</HI> and the Ladies had waited on
her Highness to her Apartment in St. <HI>James</HI>'s,
the Dutchess of <HI>M—</HI> went from thence
in order to return to her own, but found
neither her Chair nor Servants, they not ex∣pecting
her so soon; and being too impa∣tient
to stay till they were sent for, tho'
it was late, and only Moonshine, she went
into the Park that separates St. <HI>James</HI>'s from
<HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>She was entirely taken up with her Affairs,
and that she might avoid those walking in the
Mall, chose the shadiest and most retired
places; she had pull'd her Hood over her Face,
and walking fast, consider'd of the complaints
she had to make to the King of her Husband's
Conduct.</P>
<P>She was not the only Person tormented by
Jealousie at this time; the Dutchess of <HI>B—</HI>
had also her share of Afflictions: This Lady
was Daughter of <HI>Fairfax,</HI> a name well known
during the Troubles in <HI>England,</HI> he acted in
concert with <HI>Cromwel,</HI> and was declar'd Ge∣neralissimo
of the State, in the place of the
Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> in the Rebellion against King
<HI>CHARLES</HI> the First. <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham,</HI>
Master of the Horse to the King,
had married her out of a motive of Policy,
which did no ways agree with the Grandeur
and Liberty he profess'd. No Man was ever
handsomer, or more nicely made, and
there was something so engaging in his Con∣versation,
as made him more pleasing by
his Wit, than by his Person; and it
would be difficult to speak what he cou'd
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
not understand; his words pierc'd the heart,
and he was born for Gallantry and Magnifi∣cence,
in both which he surpass'd all the
Lords of the <HI>English</HI> Court.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of <HI>B—</HI> has Merit
and Virtue; she is little, brown, and lean,
but had she been the most beautiful and char∣ming
of her Sex, the being of his Wife would
have been sufficient alone to have inspired him
with a dislike: Notwithstanding she knew he
was always Intrieguing, yet she never spoke of
it, and had complaisance enough to entertain
his Mistresses, and even lodge them in her
House, all which she suffer'd because she lo∣ved
him, and knew well he lov'd not her.
But it sometimes happens, that Patience
is stretch'd to a certain Point, beyond which
it destroys and loses it self.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of <HI>B—,</HI> quite tir'd
with the continual new Intriegues of her
Husband, resolv'd to try by fear, to gain
what she could not obtain by fair means.</P>
<P>She had observ'd this day, that the Duke
was very uneasy, that one of his <HI>Valet de
Chambres</HI> had come several times to whi∣sper
him, and that afterwards the Duke went
out. He told the Dutchess he was go∣ing
to the King, but she, who did not be∣lieve
it, follow'd him, and took care, by the
distance she kept, not to be perceiv'd by him;
she observ'd, that instead of going towards
the King's Apartment, he directed his Steps
towards the Park, and walk'd softly up the
Bird-cage Walk, where it was not difficult
for the Dutchess to hide herself among the
Trees.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="21"/>
The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> had no sooner
turn'd into a Walk more retired than the
rest, but he perceiv'd a Lady whom by her
stature he guess'd to be his Mistress whom
he there expected to meet; he made up
towards this Lady, who was indeed the
Dutchess of <HI>M—,</HI> and who knew him as
soon as she saw him, he not being disguis'd.</P>
<P>She was willing to know what brought
him to this place, her Chagreen giving way
to her Curiosity, she resolv'd to unfold this
Mystery, so hiding her Face with her Hoods,
and disguising the Tone of her Voice, <HI>What
do you think, my Lord Duke</HI> (said she to him,
so soon as he came up to her) <HI>I have expected
you here this hour. My Countess,</HI> reply'd he
<HI>my Wife hindred my coming so soon as I would,
and has entertain'd some Chimera in her head,
which made her resolv'd not to quit me; I never
was so perplex'd. When we have an impatient
desire of seeing the Object we love,</HI> reply'd the
Dutchess of <HI>M—, we do not want excuses
of disengaging from whatever interposes.</HI> The
Duke being perswaded that his Mistress was
angry, threw himself at her Feet to appease
her, but she bursting out into a loud Laughter,
undeceiv'd him, and made him sensible who
it was he had entertain'd.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of <HI>B—,</HI> who at that
distance could only see and not hear them,
being at this sight certain of the Infidelity of
her Husband, remov'd from whence she was
hid, and went directly to <HI>Whitehall.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> going thro' the
Park from her Royal Highness, perceiv'd, by
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
the light of the Moon, a Woman alone, who
appear'd well made, and who to avoid him
went into another Walk. He was not so
much taken up with <HI>Emilia</HI> to be indifferent
to a new adventure; he therefore follow'd
this unknown, with intention to speak to
her as soon as she was farther advanc'd into
the Park; but seeing a Man come up to her,
he then no longer doubted but it was a Ren∣dezvous.
He drew nearer softly, and knew
the Cloaths, which were very rich, to be the
Dutchess. Never was Man so surpriz'd, and
this absolutely destroy'd the good Opinion
he always had of her; and since he was sa∣tisfy'd
he was not ignorant of his Conduct,
he believ'd she contriv'd this Revenge for his
Infidelity; he knew then that it was possible
to be jealous without love; and had it been
in another place, the effects of his anger had
been more violent.</P>
<P>He listen'd with attention to their Con∣versation,
and heard her say (in raising her
Voice) <HI>Keep your Council, my Lord, for others,
and not for me; I am resolved to complain to the
King of the Duke of</HI> Monmouth'<HI>r Proceedings;
had you seen what pass'd in her Highness's Barge
between</HI> Emilia <HI>and him, and with what Passion
he kiss'd her hand, and the length of their Con∣versation,
you would own he had affronted me,
and that my patience would be lookt on as an effect
of Stupidity. I am going now to the King to be∣seech
him to do me Justice.</HI> The answer the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> return'd to disswade her
from this design, satisfy'd the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
that it was both the Voice and Heart
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
of his Friend; his mind was at rest on one
side, but on the other hand he was not with∣out
some uneasiness. The King had more
than once commanded him to remove all
cause of Chagreen from his Wife, that
might be occasioned by his Gallantries;
and he had promised to observe it so well,
that his Majesty should never hear more of
it.</P>
<P>He thought therefore it was his best way
to prevent his Majesty, and without staying
to hear any more of their Conversation, he
went directly to the King's Apartment,
where he was inform'd his Majesty was just
then retired into his Closet with the Dutchess
of <HI>B—.</HI></P>
<P>He had not waited a minute before he saw
her come from thence, her Eyes all red and
moist with tears. As soon as the King per∣ceiv'd
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and that the
Dutchess of <HI>B—</HI> was retired, <HI>there</HI>
(says he to the Duke) <HI>goes an unhappy Wo∣man,
whose Husband has no consideration for
her; and should you use your Dutchess so, I
should never pardon you.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, <HI>(Reply'd the Duke)</HI> on the contrary,
I am come to inform your Majesty, that I this
minute left the Dutchess of—in the
Park, in a nightly Rendezvous with a Man I
know not; and I own to your Majesty, I had re∣veng'd
my self upon the spot, had not my just <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sentment
given place to the respect I owe your Ma∣jesty.
<HI>The King was much surpriz'd, and
having paus'd some time, said he,</HI> Are you
certain of what you tell me? She can't <HI>(re∣ply'd
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
the Duke)</HI> deny it, when I shall tell her
before your Majesty each circumstance of their
Conversation.</P>
<P>While he was saying this, the Duke of
<HI>Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton</HI> came to whisper the King, and let him
know, that the Dutchess of—be∣seech'd
him to grant her a private Audience.
This Duke was yet but a Child, but not∣withstanding
perceiv'd by some words that
the Dutchess let fall, that she came to com∣plain
to the King of the Conduct of her Hus∣band.
He did not love the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
tho' he was his Brother, for the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> despis'd all the King's Children,
and pretended to a great difference between
himself and them; this was a sufficient Mo∣tive
to exasperate them against him, and upon
all occasion willingly to declare for the Party
that opposed him. This Reason engaged the
young Duke of <HI>Grafton</HI> to press the King
for this Audience with the Dutchess of—.
The King ordering the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> to attend, went into his Closet,
and the Dutchess follow'd him.</P>
<P>The coldness with which the King re∣ceiv'd
her, so contrary to his natural Good∣ness
and Civility he always express'd to La∣dies,
very much surpriz'd her, and there
appear'd something in him so cloudy and
chagreen, as made her very uneasie. <HI>'Tis
from you alone, Sir,</HI> (said she to him) <HI>I expect
to be delivered from the Misfortunes which over∣whelm
me, by the Indifference and unkind Ʋsage
of the Duke of</HI> Monmouth; <HI>my patience is quite
tired out.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="25"/>
<HI>This contrivance</HI> (reply'd the King, inter∣rupting
her) <HI>is politick enough: You complain
and appear Jealous, the better to c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ceal the Suspi∣cions,
and avoid the Reproaches of your Husband
But you ought, by managing better your Affairs,
to know, that coming your self from a Ren∣dezvous,
it is not so proper a time to accuse your
Husband.</HI> The Dutchess was so confounded
at what she heard, that in spite of her Inno∣cence,
her confusion made her seem guilty.
She nevertheless was not long in recovering
herself from her surprise, and thinking more
on her own Justification than her Com∣plaints,
protesting to his Majesty, that she
deserv'd not any Reproach, and that it was
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> which she had met
in the Park; that she had stopt him only to
acquaint him with her Wrongs; and be∣seech'd
his Majesty to send to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind him, and
that would justifie what she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>The King, who always had a good o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣nion
of her Virtue, was easily <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to
believe what she said; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illing also to sa∣tisfie
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the
Earl of—to go into the Park to bring
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> to him.</P>
<P>This poor Gentleman fou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him, but too
soon, and also what he little expected, his
own Wife with him; she was a great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eau∣ty
at Court, and who till then had so w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
manag'd her affairs, that very few were ac∣quainted
with the Passion the Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham</HI>
had for her. It is easie to imagine
the surprise both of the one and the other,
but the Earl had too much prudence to make
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
any disturbance in the Park, and was Master
enough of his Resentment, to pretend a be∣lief
of what his Wife said, upon this acciden∣tal
meeting in that place, and in excusing
herself for being found so late with a Man,
so handsome and so gallant. After which
she retired in an unexpressible Confusion.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was much di∣sturb'd
at this unlucky accident, and so con∣founded,
that without staying any longer in
the Park, he immediatly went to the King,
and there justify'd the Dutchess of—.</P>
<P><HI>The King being satisfied, call'd the Duke
of</HI> Monmouth; <HI>he sent also for the Dutchess
of</HI> B—, <HI>who was return'd to her
House; and being willing to undeceive and
satisfie all Parties,</HI> You have reason to complain
of your Lady, <HI>(said he, turning to the Duke
of—)</HI> having seen her with a Man in
the Park; but notwithstanding the appearance
this has of a Crime, yet is she altogether Innocent.
The Dutchess of <HI>B—</HI> has also been
strangely alarm'd; but she ought for the future to
moderate her Suspicions; since she, as well as the
Dutchess of—, are convinced by this
Adventure, that Appearances are not always to
be rely'd on. In my Opinion, <HI>(continu'd the
King)</HI> you ought all to be pleas'd at the
Troubles you have endur'd, since they may serve
for a Remedy against Jealousie, which is the great∣est
misfortune of a Married Life.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of—was so surpriz'd
at what happen'd, that she answer'd not the
King, but observ'd a melancholy silence, in
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
which there appear'd more of fullenness than
temper: But the Dutchess of <HI>B—</HI>
lov'd her Husband too well not to be trans∣ported
with Joy, to find herself deceiv'd;
she flatter'd herself that he was not so un∣faithful
to her as she imagined, and she felt
for him such a return of a sincere Passion in
her heart, that had it been answer'd as well
on his side, he would have made her but
too happy.</P>
<P>He for his part had such a secret un∣easiness
and concern for the Countess of—,
that it depriv'd him of the pleasure he at
another time would have taken, at the un∣folding
of this Adventure. As for the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> he appear'd better satisfied
than he really was; for by this he discover'd
a watchfulness in the Dutchess of—, which
would for the future oblige him to such Mea∣sures,
as would be difficult for him to confine
himself to. The King, impatient to be gone
to his Mistress, left them, and retired in∣to
his Apartment.</P>
<P><HI>The two Dutchesses went out together,
and the two Dukes (it being fine weather)
return'd into the Park.</HI> What is the matter
with you, <HI>(said the Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>to the
Duke of</HI> Buckingham) your looks appear to me
heavy and melancholy, and you seem to have
something upon your Spirits that troubles and di∣sturbs
you. Alas! <HI>(reply'd he)</HI> in endea∣vouring
to help you, I am ruin'd my self. I went
not into the Park without design, and I must own
to you, I there expected the Countess of—.
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
The Countess of—<HI>(said the Duke of</HI> Mon∣mouth,
<HI>interrupting him)</HI> and to meet you! is
it possible? You may believe me, <HI>(said the Duke
of</HI> Buckingham) and the reason of my concealing
the passion I had for her from you, is not to be im∣puted
to my want of confidence in you, but she be∣ing
nice, and jealous of her Honour, had en∣gag'd
me by a thousand Oaths never to make
any Confident whatever. I kept my word with
her as much as was in my power; she always told
me, she would be both a Mistress and a Confident
to me; desired me not to betray her to a Friend,
who would certainly discover our affair; and be
assur'd <HI>(said she)</HI> that if you are faithful to me
in this, I shall always prefer your Interest before
my own. Alas! I have done my Duty; and the
first Confident we have had, (will you believe it?)
was her Husband. Her Husband! <HI>(said the
Duke of</HI> Monmouth) the same <HI>(added the
Duke of</HI> Buckingham.) He coming by the King's
order to look for me in the Park, found me at his
Wives Feet: Judge you of our surprise, or rather
judge it be possible to conceive; and only
consider, my Lord, what your Gallantries have
cost me.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>answer'd nothing
to this, tho' the Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>had
kept silence for some time, but walk'd
about with a perplext and thoughtful Air.</HI>
Is it possible <HI>(said the Duke of</HI> Buckingham)
that you should be so sensibly mov'd at my Mis∣fortunes?
Another <HI>(reply'd the Duke of</HI> Mon∣mouth)
might perhaps on such an occasion impose
on you, but I cannot think of deceiving my best
Friend: No, <HI>(continu'd he,</HI> your Affliction does
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
not at all concern me; for I am wholly taken up
with my own. Know <HI>(my Lord)</HI> that this
Countess who is so very jealous of her Honour
and Reputation has said the same kind things
to me, she expressed to you; and I thought
her worthy of my Inclinations, but believed her
capable of Infidelity.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>was extremely
surprized;</HI> What! <HI>(cry'd he)</HI> are we then Ri∣vals?
Has this Woman Cunning and Falshood e∣nough
to deceive us? It disturbs me,
<HI>reply'd the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, but I am not
at all surprized; for sinee she may imagine that
we love others beside her, it does not appear strange
to me that she deceive us. You are too indulgent,
<HI>said the Duke of</HI> Buckingham, and undoubtedly
you love her much less than me, since you bear
with so much Indifference what I cannot think on
but with Horror. I do my self Justice, <HI>reply'd
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, and I cannot believe
a Woman who merits the Passion a Gallant Man
has for her can patiently suffer him to divide it,
and rob her of half her due. It may happen <HI>(in∣terrupted
the Duke of</HI> Buckingham) that du∣ring
the time of a long Amour one may sometimes
make use of a favourable Opportunity when it
happens in ones way: But it is certain that these
little Treacheries are of no Consequence, and that
one always returns to the Object beloved, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to ones only good. It is for this Reason
that no reasonable Woman ought to be offended at
them. I thought <HI>(said the Duke of</HI> Monmouth)
that the Laws between them and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be
equal, and that the Priviledge we assu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to our
selves of engaging from time to time in new In∣trigues
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Condition to return at last to our first
Amour, is a Trick we put upon them, which ne∣ver
relishes well with them, and which they must
certainly return to the purpose when they find occa∣sion.
You would infer then <HI>(reply'd briskly
the Duke of</HI> Buckingham) that the Countess of
—has done well in deceiving us, and that
we ought both to thank her for the Trouble
she has taken about it. No, <HI>said the Duke of</HI>
Monmouth, I should not conclude in that manner,
for it distracts me to find my self fooled by a Per∣son
I esteemed even more than I lov'd, and whom
I have lov'd so long: But yet I cannot but think
she would have been faithful to either of us, had
either of us been constant to her. Good God!
<HI>(said the D. of</HI> Buckingham) was I not constant, or
did I love any one but her? But yet I am such aweak
Fool, <HI>added he,</HI> that I cannot forbear being uneasy
for fear of any Misfortune that may happen to her.
Her Husband's Moderation appear'd to me more
suspicious, and troubles me more than if he had
resented it in the most violent manner. Come,
come, <HI>(replied the Duke of</HI> Monmouth) let
us endeavour to assist her, and not look upon one
another as Rivals. Alas! <HI>(cried the Duke of</HI>
Buckingham) what can we do in a Business of
this Nature? We shall never see her more.</P>
<P><HI>They continued walking while they were
thus discoursing, when the Duke of</HI> Monmouth
<HI>perceived something shining on the Ground,
he went and took it up, and finding it to be
Tablets adorned with Diamonds, addressed
himself to the Duke of</HI> Buckingham, Have you
not, <HI>said he,</HI> a Curiosity to see what these Tablets
contain? One must be then <HI>(answered the D. of</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
Buckingham) the most careless and most coquet of
Mankind; for my part I have other Thoughts in
my Head. I will keep them <HI>(said the Duke
of</HI> Monmouth, <HI>smiling at his Friend's Cha∣grene)</HI>
and if I find any thing in them worth your
Knowledge, I promise to communicate it to you. I
desire nothing of you at present, <HI>reply'd the
D. of</HI> Buckingham, but a History of your Amours
with the Countess of—. It is too late, <HI>said
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, to begin in now; but to
morrow, if you please, I will satisfy you. <HI>The
D. of</HI> Buckingham <HI>thank'd him for his Com∣plaisance,
and each retired to his Apartment.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding the little Concern and
Carelesness the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> ex∣pressed,
yet was he sensibly touch'd with the
Infidelity of the Countess of—He thought
himself the only Person belov'd, and in this
Opinion was so well satisfied with her, that
he found it no easy matter to bring himself to
a Belief of what had happened; he reflected
upon all her Charms, and never thought her
so beautiful, as at this Moment; but these
Reflections made him only more sensible of
his losing her: Yet as he was not apt (by his
natural Temper) to lay any thing to Heart,
he remember'd himself of the Tablets he had
found, hoping to find in them what might
either amuse or divert him, he there read
these Word.</P>
<P>Do not upbraid your self with the Ʋneasiness
you have given me? And is it possible, that after
having flattered me with a Preference somewhat
particular, that you could take such Pleasure in
entertaining the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and even
<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
before my Face? Think not to excuse your self by
telling me I at the same time was in Conversation
with my Lady—. You know the Case is dif∣ferent,
and that I am obliged to keep some mea∣sures
with her, when you for your part have no
Pretence for engaging my Rival. If you wish not
my Death, appoint where I may see and entertain
you in private.</P>
<P>The Duke soon perceived these Tablets be∣longed
to the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> and that the
Billet was directed to <HI>Emilia:</HI> But the fol∣lowing
Lines writ under the first, absolute∣ly
confirm'd him.</P>
<P>Complain not of me, my Lord, when you have
no Reason to suspect my Heart; if I had any Com∣plaisance
for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> it was out
of a politick Design, in which I consulted most
your Advantage: For I was willing to divert the
Suspicions of the jealous Lady—, and give
her some Reason to surmise I preferred another be∣fore
you. I cannot meet you till to Morrow Eve∣ning,
and then in the Gallery at the end of the
Queen's Apartment I shall expect you. Fail not.</P>
<P><HI>This Infidelity of</HI> Emilia <HI>almost distracted
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth; Was it not sufficient,
<HI>said he,</HI> to know that the Countess of—lov'd
the D. of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> but must I also at the same
time find that a Girl I love is so inclinable to
sacrifice me to the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> who, tho' 'tis
true, loved her first; yet had I flatter'd my self
with being able to oblige her to prefer me before
him. <HI>He found in his Mind a thousand De∣signs
to revenge himself, and with these Re∣solutions
went to Bed, without being in a
Condition of taking any rest.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="33"/>
<HI>This Night seem'd to him to be dedicated
to Troubles and Afflictions: The Countess
of—, as soon as she got to her House,
called one of her Women, in whom she put
the greatest Confidence.</HI> My poor <HI>Esther, says
she to her,</HI> I am undone; such an Accident has
happened to me this Evening, so unlucky and so
cruel that it is past Imagination. My Husband
just now has seen me in the Park with the D. of
<HI>Buckingham:</HI> His Moderation and affected Calm∣ness
threaten and foretell the w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst of Misfortunes.
Good God! <HI>added she,</HI> What shall I do to deli∣ver
my self from them? You ought, Madam,
<HI>said</HI> Esther, without deferring a moment, go to
your Sisters, and by that means avoid the first
motions of your Husband's Passion, which are al∣always
the most dangerous. But what Pretence,
<HI>said the Countess,</HI> can I make for going out so
late? Would not that be confessing a Crime, and
should I not be confounded and overwhelm'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with
Shame? When danger is so near, <HI>reply'd</HI> Esther,
give me leave to tell you, one must not be so scru∣pulous.
Your Sister, Madam, will advise you, and
be as tender of your Reputation as of her own. But
what shall I say to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth, re∣ply'd
the Countess,</HI> when he comes to be ac∣quainted
with what has happened? Will he not be
my greatest Enemy? He never has loved you well
enough, Madam, <HI>answered</HI> Esther, to hate you,
and if you continue longer these unnecessary Refle∣ctions,
my Lord will return, and it will be then
too late to escape his Anger.</P>
<P>The Countess went from her Chamber to the
Stair-Case, but as she was descending, and just
going into her Chair, her Husband appeared.
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
She seemed not at all confus'd, but told him
her Sister was not well, and had sent to de∣sire
her to come to her. It did not appear
whether he believed her or not; he seem'd
unconcerned, and only said it was too late
for her to range the Streets, and that an able
Physician would comfort her Sister better;
and then with a Chagrene Look which seem'd
to forbode Mischief, ordered her to re∣turn
with him to her Chamber.</P>
<P>So soon as she was in her Chamber, he told
her the King had ordered him the next
Morning to go down into <HI>Pembrokeshire</HI> to
compose some Disorders there, and that he
intended to take her down with him: It is
impossible to express the Surprize this caused
in her; she told him she believed 'twas some
Rising, and that she should be always in Fears,
to be among disaffected Persons. He told her
he would soon qualify all things. She added
it was yet too soon, and too hot, to go
into the Country: He promised to provide
cool Apartments for her. She answered, she
should infallibly fall sick; he reply'd, we have
good Physicians there. She still insisted how
much 'twould impair her Health: He desired
her not to trouble her self. And in fine, all
her Reasons were useless; he let her know,
that without troubling her self with more
evasions, it was his Pleasure, and that it was
her Duty willingly to obey, because he would
depart at break of Day.</P>
<P>Tho' the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was igno∣rant
of this mischievous Determination, yet
was he no less uneasy and perplext at his
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
House. He found his Wife on his coming
home in his Chamber where she had staid ex∣pecting
him; she flew into his Bosom, and
throwing her Arms about his Neck, (which
added to his Chagreen) she protested she
could not have slept, had she not seen him
before she went to Bed; that she was willing to
excuse her self for what had happened
in his Majesty's Closet, and to own her
self in the wrong; but if he would
only consider the Cause of her Complaints,
it would incline him to love her more. He
agreed to whatever she said, that she might
the sooner return to her Chamber: He told
her he feared her sitting up so late would in∣dispose
her, and that he was too much con∣cern'd
for what might prejudice her Health
to suffer it, and so almost whether she would
or no waited upon her to her Chamber. He
fancied himself quit of her, and was pleasing
himself with this Imagination, when he per∣ceived
her returning after him. One of her
Pages laying up a <HI>Hungary</HI> Water Bottle had
by chance let it fall by the Bed-side, and the
Smell of it was so strong,—or rather the
Dutchess made this so good a Pretence, that
she came to desire the half of her Husband's
Bed, which he could not well refuse her,
whatever Inclination he might have to the
contrary.</P>
<P>On the other hand, my Lady—, in go∣ing
out of her Highness's Barge, not able
any longer to withold her Grief, seign'd an
Indisposition, that she might remove to her
Apartment, and there give Liberty to those
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
Tears she had with so much Trouble confin'd.
Shame and Anger to be so much concern'd
for an ingrateful Man, added much to her Affli∣ctions.
<HI>Shall I not overcome this Passion,</HI> said she,
to the Countess of <HI>F—,</HI> who was her in∣timate
Friend, and whom she had sent for?
<HI>I love a Traitor who knows not how to value my
heart; he leaves me for</HI> Emilia, <HI>tho' she cares
not for him, and has sacrific'd him to the Duke
of</HI> Monmouth. <HI>Yes Madam,</HI> continu'd she,
<HI>the Earl of</HI> A—n <HI>has seen my grief and un∣easiness
with a barbarous Indifference, he has
made me a Witness of his Treachery, and yet I
persist as it were to determine against my own
Eyes, and to love him in spight of so many rea∣sons
I have to hate him, and by this weakness
make my self the most unfortunate Creature in
the World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Countess of</HI> F—<HI>was extremely
pleas'd at what her Friend had told her;</HI> At
last <HI>(said she)</HI> you perceive, what I have seen
long since; and I begin to hope your pride and dis∣dain
will overcome this passion: For is it not a
despicable thing, that you who are Mistress of so
much wit and merit, should be always fool'd by
this Earl of <HI>A—n.</HI> Alas! <HI>cry'd my La∣dy
—. (shedding a torrent of Tears)</HI> am
I Mistress enough of my self to avoid it? You
speak like a Woman who knows not what it is to
love, and who is ignorant that its power is the
most tyrannical of all the Passions. Let us talk
no more of what you ought to do to cure your self
<HI>answer'd the Countess of</HI> F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—, <HI>embra∣cing
her)</HI> but at least, my dear Lady, promise
me to make advantage of those Lessons of Indiffe∣rence
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> gives you: I shall
not forget them, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> tho' I cannot pro∣pose
to my self the tranquility I desire: But if I
should still be so weak as not to be capable of banish∣ing
him from my heart, I shall yet have pride enough
to keep it secret from him, and resentment enough
to revenge my self on my Rival, and to let her
see, that the affronting of a Woman of my Birth
and Character, will not long remain unpunish'd.
I understand you, <HI>reply'd the Countess of</HI>
F—; you resolve entirely to dispose your self to
torment <HI>Emilia.</HI> Oh! my dear Lady <HI>(con∣tinued
she)</HI> how much a stranger are you to that
temper of mind I could wish you. <HI>The Conver∣sation
had continued longer, had it not been
interrupted by one, who came to acquaint
the Countess, that the Queen had ask'd for her.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> among all those I
have already mention'd, was the only Per∣son
free from uneasiness and chagreen; the
answer he had receiv'd from <HI>Emilia</HI> in his
Tablets, entirely satisfy'd, and compos'd
him; for he knew not as yet that he had
dropt them in the Park.</P>
<P>The Amorous and Jealous Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
wholly employ'd his Thoughts on
disappointing the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> of his a∣greeable
Rendezvous; and resolved to en∣gage
my Lady—to be one of the Party.
He went early to her House, and when he
saw her, perceiv'd in her Eyes a certain lan∣guishing
Air, which made her appear so ve∣ry
charming, that had he not fear'd displea∣sing
her, he had certainly in this moment
desired her for ever to have fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>got the Earl
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
of <HI>A—n,</HI> and to have accepted of him in
his place.</P>
<P>Our Interests ought, Madam, <HI>said he, (en∣tring
her Chamber)</HI> to be common, and we are
both of us fool'd by Persons who deserve not our
Consideration. I understand you, my Lord, <HI>re∣ply'd
she,</HI> you speak of the Seene acted Yester∣day
in her Royal Highness's Barge; I must own
I play'd but a very indifferent part in it, and it is
not without blushing I hear it mentioned. Is it
possible <HI>(said the Duke)</HI> that a Man for whom you
have so particular an Esteem, can have so much
ingratiude and ill nature? He endeavours still to
deceive me, <HI>added she,</HI> by a thousand Protesta∣tions,
which have now no effect upon me: For
example, what did he not say to me Yesterday?
My accusing him with loving <HI>Emilia,</HI> was, in his
opinion, doing him wrong; and injustice in me, for
believing my own Eyes, the faithful Witnesses of
it. But <HI>(continued she smiling)</HI> I am not
so easily deceived. I am a stranger to what you
tell me, <HI>said the Duke;</HI> but these Tablets Ma∣dam,
which chance has put into my hands, may
confirm my just Suspicions, and convince him of
Ingratitude. I need not <HI>(said she, taking them
after a scornful manner)</HI> I need not more proof
to perswade me of his Treachery.</P>
<P>She read the two Letters, and chang'd co∣lour
several times in reading them; she then
return'd the Tablets to the Duke, without
having power to speak, except with her
Eyes, which express'd themselves intelligi∣bly
enough. <HI>Let us not lose this opportunity</HI>
(said he to her) <HI>of disturbing this agreeable
Rendezvous. Go you, Madam, into the Gal∣lery,
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
and personate there</HI> Emilia, <HI>and draw from
his own Mouth an acknowledgment of his Infide∣ity;
while I for my part will take care of the rest.</HI>
She had much ado to resolve upon this un∣dertaking,
she well knew she was neither
desired nor expected by the Earl of <HI>A—n;</HI>
she dreaded also being surpriz'd with him
by some one, who would perhaps put an ill
construction on it; but all these Reasons gave
place to the Intreaties and Reasons of the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI> she pleas'd her self, that
she should be able to convince the Earl of
<HI>A—n</HI> of Infidelity, and resolv'd absolute∣ly
to break with him, and treat him with
disdain and contempt. She then promis'd
the Duke not to fail meeting in the Gallery;
and he being assur'd of her going, went to
the King, to know how he design'd to di∣vert
himself that day.</P>
<P>He was then inform'd that the King in∣tended
to hunt, and that the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI>
was one whom his Majesty had order'd to
attend him: After this the Duke went home,
and counterfeiting as well as he could the
Earl of <HI>A—n</HI>'s Character, from some Let∣ters
he had of his, he writ the following
Lines in the Tablets he had found.</P>
<P>“I cannot go into the Gallery without
passing by the Queens Chamber, who I
fear may stop me and engage me at play.
I think therefore it would be better to
meet in the little Apartment of the Prin∣cess
—; you can come there unobser∣ved,
and at my return from Hunting I
will with all hast wait on you there.”</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> order'd one of his
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
<HI>Valet de Chambres,</HI> who was not known to <HI>E∣milia,</HI>
to find out some way of giving these
Tablets to her, as from the Earl of <HI>A—n.</HI>
He return'd presently to the King, and on
the Stairs met the D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI> going
down in a hurry, upon some affair that re∣quired
extraordinary hast; he consider'd
whether it were proper to stop him, but at
last running after him, and taking him by the
Arm, <HI>Where are you going,</HI> said he, <HI>my Lord,
in such extraordinary hast? Read this Note my
Lord,</HI> (answer'd the D. of <HI>Buckingham,) which
I just now receiv'd from the Countess of—,
and then judge if I have not reason:</HI> The Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> then read these words:</P>
<P>“You may easily comprehend my Affli∣ction,
when I shall tell you, my Husband
designs to carry me down into <HI>Pembroke∣shire;</HI>
and that my Tears and Prayers
have had no power over him: What will
you do, my Lord, to stop this Journey so
fatal to my repose, if not my life? Con∣sult
your heart, 'tis that alone will furnish
you with means, which my condition will
not permit me to conceive.”</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>return'd the Duke
of</HI> B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kingham <HI>his Letter.</HI> Her misfortunes, <HI>said
he,</HI> sensibly affects and moves me, notwithstand∣ing
the cause I have to comp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain of her; but I
cannot assist her in so nice an affair, and I advise
you to let this matter take its natural course.
Heav'n defend me, <HI>(cry'd the D. of</HI> Buckingham)
'tis sufficient that she desires my help, and I will
assist her. You intend then to turn Knight Er∣rant,
<HI>(said the Duke of</HI> Monmouth?) I am
not so Chymerical as that, <HI>interrupted the D. of</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
Buckingham; but I cannot with patience see your
indifference for a Woman, who not four and
twenty hours ago you thought lov'd you. And then
I fear'd the contrary, <HI>reply'd the Duke of</HI>
Monmouth; my thoughts which have been so
much deceiv'd in so material Point, have work∣ed
out their own cure.</P>
<P>I have been deceiv'd as well as you, and per∣haps
more <HI>(reply'd the D. of</HI> Buckingham, <HI>smi∣ling)</HI>
but she has still an invincible Power over
me; whether it be generosity, or love, or both, I
cannot tell; I am resolv'd to deliver her from the
hands of her Husband. You are going to make
a terrible disturbance, <HI>reply'd the D. of</HI> Mon∣mouth;
let me consider what is best to be done.
<HI>The D. of</HI> Buckingham <HI>return'd no answer▪
And the Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>after having
some time consider'd on ways and means the
most practicable,</HI> No time is to be l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, <HI>said
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth; go my Lord, go, and
conjure the King to assist you; he is too Gallant,
and too Generous to refuse you.</P>
<P>The D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI> approv'd of this expe∣dient,
and went up directly to the King's Bed∣chamber,
and desired a moments Audience.
As soon as he was alone with the King, he
related to his Majesty the whole adventure
of the Rendezvous he had in the Park, the
misfortune of being surpriz'd by the Earl of
—. He then shew'd the Countess's Letter.
The King chang'd colour several times du∣ring
this relation, and the Duke perceiving
it, was quite confounded, and began to fear
that he should find in the King a more dan∣gerous
Rival, than in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI></P>
<P>After the King had for some time kept si∣lence,
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
<HI>It surprises me,</HI> said he, <HI>that the Coun∣tess
of—should not have addressed her self
to me, rather than to you, in desiring protection
from the ill nature of her Husband; but she has
her Reasons to conceal from me her Conduct and
Affairs.</HI> The D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI> having had
the honour of being brought up with the
King, had so agreeably insinuated himself
into his Majesty's Favour and Intriegues, that
he took a greater liberty of Speech in his
Conversation with the King, than any other
Person belonging to the Court.</P>
<P>Conceal not your thoughts from me, Sir, <HI>said
he to him;</HI> for I already penetrate into them, and
this contributes to make me compleatly miserable:
You love the Countess, and you are displeas'd and
jealous at our Rendezvous in the Park; but this is
a matter too important to permit of time to ex∣amine
now, whether she had reason or no of her
side. Stop her departure, Sir, and think only
of that. Oh! the Ingrate, <HI>(cry'd the King,
fetching a profound Sigh) he was then silent
for some time, and seem'd to consider; af∣ter
which,</HI> No, <HI>(continu'd he)</HI> she deserves
neither my Anger nor Protection: I'le have no∣thing
more to do with her, nor will I have you
speak any more of her. <HI>The Duke was amaz'd
and thunder-struck; he perceiv'd the King
was entirely possest with a just Indignation,
which would not suffer him to be any ways
aiding or assisting to his Mistress; he there∣fore
respectfully withdrew from his Majesty's
Closet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He found the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, <HI>who
waited for him in the Guard-Chamber; he
pass'd by him, and took no notice of him,
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
and went down Stairs: The Duke was sur∣priz'd
at this, but overtaking him, ask'd
him what he had concluded with the King?</HI>
I have made a new Blunder, <HI>(said he briskly
to him)</HI> and all by your Council; for you are
unlucky to me in my Intreagues: The King loves
the Countess, and I have acquainted him with
my Passion; imagine then how unfortunate I am.
Last night I found you to be my Rival, and this
morning know the King to be so too: And yet the
Infidelity and Treachery of my Mistress, is so far
from allaying the violence of my Passion, that it
rather increases, and seems as if I alone was de∣stin'd
to commit extravagances for a Woman,
that deserves to be hated and despised by me.</P>
<P><HI>As the Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>was prepar'd
to tell him, that we never lov'd more than
when we are in likelihood of being the ob∣ject
beloved, he was inform'd the King want∣ed
him.</HI> Will you stay here for me, <HI>said he to
the D. of</HI> Buckingham, perhaps the business the
King has sent to me about may be for your advan∣tage?
I shall lose time, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> the Coun∣tess
is gone before this, and I must follow her.
What! <HI>cry'd the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, would
you take her away by force! I know not what I
shall do <HI>(added the D. of</HI> Buckingham) but fol∣low
her I will. You are going upon an unadvis'd
and indiscreet Affair; <HI>interrupted the Duke
of</HI> Monmouth; refuse not the staying here for
me, and I will return in a moment. <HI>The D. of</HI>
Buckingham <HI>turning into a low and dark Gal¦lery
which had several Apartments, belonging
to the Officers,</HI> here, <HI>said he,</HI> I will expect you.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> hasten'd to the
King; he was inform'd he was in his
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
Closet, he entred softly, and perceiv'd
his Majesty leaning on his Elbows, in a
thoughtful posture, who hearing some noise,
turn'd himself towards the Door and saw the
Duke. <HI>Come hither</HI> James (for so he often
call'd him) <HI>and answer me what I demand, with∣out
hesitation; it is concerning the Countess of</HI>
—. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> doubted not
but that his Majesty was apprised of the Pas∣sion
he had for this Lady. <HI>Sir,</HI> said he, <HI>you
demand of me an ingenious Confession of my In∣clinations
for her: I owe too much respect to your
Majesty, not to be sincere: It is true therefore
that I have lov'd her, and should not I believe
have been hated, had I been more assiduous and
constant in my Addresses.</HI> The King was sur∣priz'd
at this unexpected Confession, and
looking gravely, <HI>Finish,</HI> said he, <HI>what the
Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>has begun.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke found, but too late, his impru∣dence
in answering the King, before he was
satisfied what he intended to ask him; and
his thoughts were so perplex'd and troubled,
and so much disorder'd, that he had not
power to answer any thing.</P>
<P><HI>The King then breaking silen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> I had
chose you for a Confident of my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>cry'd
he;</HI> I would have told you, that I had a Pas∣sion
I was asham'd of, since no Lover ever was
more unfortunate than me; that I lov'd the
Countess of—with so discreet a Passion, that
having observ'd her desires for having it an in∣violable
Secret, I had taken all possible care to
conceal my love, and was satisfied in discovering
only to her the violence of my Passion: I expected
that time would make me happy, in deserving a
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
Blessing which I would have had owing only to my
care, and her acknowledgment. She cunningly
avoided giving me the least encouragement, and
tho' my heart could but ill brook this usage, yet
was it no small satisfaction to me to find so vir∣tuous
a Woman. My Esteem encreas'd my Pas∣sion;
but in truth, I have been the Bubble of
this Intreague; since you, and <HI>Buckingham</HI> have
triumph'd with success; while I have languish'd
and sigh'd without complaint.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>having recover'd
himself, answered with a respeful Look, that
the Affair he had with the Countess, ought
not to trouble his Majesty, since he
would never see her more.</HI> When one begins
to love the Son, <HI>interrupted the King,</HI> it is sel∣dom
one returns to the Father; I should be much
in the wrong should I think it; and I must own
<HI>(continu'd he)</HI> I look on the D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
as a Rival much less to be feared; for we are near
of the same Age; but for you it is quite otherwise.
I know not, <HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI> what I might
have expected from the Countess; but I know
well, Sir, that it is a fortune I have long since
neglected. That is your fault, and not hers,
<HI>said the King;</HI> she is not, in my opinion, either
more innocent or more excusable; she has decei∣ved
me by a thousand Artifi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, nevertheless I
pity her misfortune; for her Husband is going
to confine her in the Country. What will she do
there? She will never get there three such Lovers
as she leaves behind her at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> Go,
<HI>James,</HI> Go, I give you orders to send the Guards
and bring her back, and acquaint her Husband,
that it is my Pleasure he return, and that I have
occasion for him here.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="46"/>
The Duke immediatly left the King, well
pleas'd with his Commission, and went to
find out the D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in the Gal∣lery,
where he expected him: He walk'd
some time without seeing him, but at last
perceiv'd him stooping and list'ning at a
Door. As soon as he saw the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
he made a sign to him to come to him
without making any noise; when he was
near enough, <HI>I know not,</HI> said he, (whisper∣ing)
<HI>whether I dream or am well awake, but I
swear I hear the voice of our Countess. You are
so full of her,</HI> reply'd the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,
that you believe you always hear her. I will be
judg'd by your self,</HI> added the Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham,
do but listen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> Monmouth <HI>heard presently a
Womans voice, which said,</HI> Alas! my Lord,
the timely help you have given me, is not enough,
for I find my circumstances more cruel and em∣barrass'd
than ever, what will become of me?
and what will not they say of me at Court, for an
adventure so extraordinary as mine? Trouble
not your self Madam, <HI>(said he to whom she
had spoke)</HI> you are in a place of safety, and
where you are Mistress; the Marquess of—
knows not what use we make of his Apart∣ment;
nor will he return till the King comes
from Hunting: In the mean time I will find out
some private and convenient House; after which
you may take such measures as you think proper,
towards a reconciliation with your Husband. But
Madam, <HI>(added he, in a passionate Voice)</HI>
dare I ask you, what will become of me? will you
always use me with so much rigour? and will not
the Service I have now done you, deserve some∣thing
from you?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="47"/>
I am not in a condition to answer you, my Lord,
<HI>(said the Countess of—, for it was real∣ly
her)</HI> and you ought not to ask me such que∣stions,
at a time I have so much occasion for you; it
is detracting from your Generosity, and my Niceness.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, <HI>said the Lord, (fetching a
deep sigh)</HI> the respect and love I have always shewn
you, has been evident enough; but you have
slighted my Passion; and notwithstanding the
violence you have done your self in concealing
from me your Inclinations, yet have I penetrated
into them. But if at last you admit me to no
place in your favour, I shall yet have the sad com∣fort
to say, have fail'd in nothing in respect to you.</P>
<P>He added some other words, which the
D. of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and <HI>Buckingham</HI> could not
well hear, because perceiving him to be just
coming out, they had retired to the head
of a private Staircase, which belong'd to
my Lady <HI>F—l</HI>'s Apartments.</P>
<P>They might easily from this place see who
it was went out of the Chamber: They saw
it was my Lord—. The Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI>
could not forbear saying to the D. of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> (smiling) <HI>Behold another Rival;
but after what we have heard him say, I believe
he is not much to be fear'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He then gave the D. of</HI> Buckingham <HI>an ac∣count
of his Conversation with the King,
and the order he had receiv'd for the bring∣ing
back the Countess.</HI> Ah! my dear Friend,
<HI>said the D. of Buckingham,</HI> you may do me a most
particular Service: You have the Key of the
Marquess of—Chamber. It is true, <HI>reply'd
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth; being Captain of the
Guards, I have the Keys of the Chambers of both
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
the Lieutenants, in case of any Orders in the
Night, that I may the more readily go to them.
For Godsake, <HI>continu'd the D. of</HI> Buckingham,
lend it me, and I will take the advantage of this
moment to see the Countess. Should the King
know it, <HI>(said the Duke of</HI> Monmouth) it
would be sufficient to make me lose his favour.
Who shall acquaint him with it, <HI>interrupted the
D. of</HI> Buckingham? Should I betray you after
having <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so much oblig'd to you! No, <HI>said
the Duke of</HI> Monmouth, it must not be you, but
it may be my Lord—. He cannot divine,
<HI>(added the D. of</HI> Buckingham, <HI>smiling)</HI> and
otherwise cannot imagine that I should happen to
come in this moment into this Gallery, and that
you should there trust me with your Key. Nay,
he must do more than divine, <HI>reply'd the Duke
of</HI> Monmouth, to imagine I should neglect mak∣ing
use of this opportunity for my self, and to
grant it to you, when I know you to be my Rival.
Were you not well cured of this Passion, <HI>inter∣rupted
the D. of</HI> Buckingham, I should rather
die than desire such a Sacrifice from you; but
from you your self; know the condition of your heart.</P>
<P>The Duke gave him the Key conditional∣ly,
not to make use of it till the King was
gone a Hunting.</P>
<P>As soon therefore as the D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
had seen the King take Horse, he ran to the
Gallery with the utmost Concern, a thou∣sand
different Thoughts imploy'd his Mind;
he went to find out a Woman he tenderly
lov'd, but he was jealous of her, and even
almost hated her, when he reflected upon
the number of her Admirers, and that per∣haps
she had sacrific'd him to them. Taken
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
up with these different Reflections, he ad∣vanced
in the Gallery, sometimes walking
slow, sometimes fast; his Thoughts jarr'd,
and he was strangely disorder'd.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of <HI>B—</HI> having spent part
of the Morning with the Countess of <HI>F—l,</HI>
descended the little Staircase coming into
the Gallery, and there perceiv'd her faith∣less
Husband. She did not doubt, since he
followed not the King a Hunting, but he
had some Intreague, and she therefore stopt
at the Door at the bottom of the Stair-case.</P>
<P>She perceiv'd then, that he open'd the
Marquess of—. Lodging, and went
into them: She following him softly, and
stopping first at the Door, considering whe∣ther
she had best knock, observ'd that it was
not quite shut; well-pleas'd with this acci∣dent,
she slipt into the Chamber.</P>
<P>The D. of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> taken up entirely
with his Passion, had forgot to take the Key
out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Door; the Windows of this lit∣tle
Apartment were shut, the Countess had
taken this precaution when she enter'd, fea∣ring
to be perceiv'd. There was a Closet on
one side of the Chamber; the Duke not see∣ing
the Countess in the Chamber, went into
the Closet: The Dutchess of <HI>B—</HI> not
knowing where to hide herself, laid herself
on the Bed, the Curtains being drawn: she
thought she should die with chagreen and
grief which this imprudent Curiosity had
given her.</P>
<P><HI>One could see better in the Closet than in
the Chamber: The Countess no sooner saw
the Duke, but she skream'd out;</HI> What, my
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
Lord, <HI>cry'd she,</HI> is it you? and dare you appear
before me, after having refus'd me the help I de∣sired
and expected only from you, and which I
wish'd with so much eagerness? I was as careful
to conceal my retreat from you, as from my Hus∣band,
and wonder at the indiscretion of my Lord
—, in discovering it to you.</P>
<P>Were you less unfortunate, or had I less
zeal for you, Madam, <HI>reply'd the Duke of</HI>
Buckingham, I should have greater reason to
complain than you: I have neglected nothing on
this occasion that might be of peculiar Service. I
was just ready to mount on Horseback to follow you,
and snatch you from your unworthy Husband, and
to expose my self to my Wives Jealousie, and
perhaps to the greatest Troubles, when chance
discover'd to me that you were in these Cham∣bers.
Yes, faithless as you are, <HI>continu'd he,</HI>
spight of my Rivals, and the care you take to
keep them conceal'd; spight of your Infidelity,
and my just Resentment, I love you still, and with
so much Passion, as to be transported with the
Happiness of finding you.</P>
<P>I could not think, <HI>reply'd briskly the Coun∣tess,</HI>
that you would add new Afflictions to those
which already overwhelm me, since 'tis you alone
have been the cause of this my deplorable Condi∣tion.
Was there a Woman at Court had more
Reputation, or was less envied, till that unhappy As∣signation
in which I was discover'd with you?
'Tis for you I suffer, and it is you Insult over me!
Go, my Lord, go, I desire neither your heart nor
your pity, and your sight is troublesom to me.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of</HI> Buckingham <HI>was too much
mov'd to desire an Eclarissiment, he threw
himself at her Feet, and embracing her
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
Knees with a violent Transport,</HI> I am not in
a condition, <HI>said he to her,</HI> to withstand your
Anger with Reasons which would offend you;
you would not approve of my reproaching you with
your affairs with the King, Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI>
and Lord—, which are come to my knowledge,
and which give me a mortal Displeasure: No,
Madam, I will not say any thing may displease
you; nay I will own my self to blame, provided
you will pardon me.</P>
<P>The uneasiness of the Countess of—
is not to be express'd, at the liberty the Duke
had taken in speaking to her, she believing
her Intreagues had not been discover'd, and
instead of appeasing her, she flew into so great
a passion, that it was impossible for him to
pacifie her: <HI>I will never see you more,</HI> said she,
retiring from him; <HI>either do you depart this
minute out of the Closet, or I will, whatever ha∣zard
I run; I will expose my self willingly, rather
than stay here with the most ungrateful of Mankind</HI></P>
<P>In saying this, she ran to the Chamber-Door,
which finding open, she presently
went out. The Duke remain'd in the Clo∣set,
contriving which way to appease the
fury of his Mistress; after which he remo∣ved
into the Chamber, where he believed
her to be, and hearing a noise towards the
Bed, he doubted not but she was there, and
accordingly advanc'd towards her.</P>
<P>It was the Dutchess of <HI>B—,</HI> who had
kept herself still there, and who being as
much exasperated as the Countess, thrust
the Duke rudely from her, when he was
going to throw himself at her Feet, he seiz'd
her Hands, and kiss'd them several times
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
with the utmost Transport; but the more
Passion he express'd, the more was she dis∣pleas'd.
<HI>How unhappy am I,</HI> (said she to her
self) <HI>that cannot deliver my self from this Traitor,
and that the tenderness he shews, which at ano∣ther
time would be so agreeable to me, doth now
but encrease my present Grief and Trouble! I
owe all this to my Rival, and these are poisoned
Sweets which mortally offend a Heart so delicate
as mine.</HI></P>
<P>These Reflections encreas'd her Chagreen;
she snatch'd her hands from the Duke, and
pushing him from her, would not mind him.
This usage from a Person belov'd, encreases
rather than quells a Passion; and as submis∣sive
and respectful as the Duke was, he had
not quitted his design of qualifying her an∣ger,
had he not perceiv'd, that the Person
with whom he was had little dry and lean
Arms, which did not at agree with those
of the Countess; it was not possible to ima∣gine
how afew hours grief could produce such
a surprising alteration: he was amaz'd at first,
and going to the Window to open it, when
my Lord—return'd, in order to take
the Countess to a House of his own.</P>
<P>He was much surpriz'd to find the Door
open, and pushing it softly, he thought he
had lost his Senses: Perceiving a Man with
a Woman, jealousie threw a mist befor his
Eyes, and notwithstanding the difference
there was between the Dutchess of—and
the Countess of—, he believed it was the
last, who rewarded his Services with this In∣fidelity;
he was so struck with amazement,
that he had not the power of moving forwards
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
the better to be confirm'd in what he saw.</P>
<P>The Duke, for his part, perceiv'd by the
light that came from the Door my Lord
—open'd, that it was his Dutchess with
whom he was; but the Dutchess of—
more concern'd for him than her self, threw
her Arms about his Neck.</P>
<P>The Duke, not Master enough of his Pas∣sion,
thrust her disdainfully from him. What
a Sight was this to my Lord—, who had
staid at the Door! and who imagining it to
be the Countess had certainly made some Di∣sturbance
had he consulted only his Fury and
Resentment, but he was not willing this Af∣fair
should make too great a Noise, or have
more Spectators.</P>
<P>He had time enough to observe and know
the D. of <HI>Buckingham:</HI> He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> retired with
the greatest Uneasiness imaginable, during
which the Dutchess of—for her part
made a thousand Reproaches to the Duke.</P>
<P>What! <HI>said she to him,</HI> can neither my Fi∣delity
nor Love obtain the least Kindness from
you? Another possesses your Heart; and that
Heart which belongs to me, and which is the on∣ly
Satisfaction of my Life, is continually engaging
it self in new Amours; and my unhappy Fortune
has brought me here to be witness of your Tran∣sports
for another, and of my own Disgrace. Ne∣vertheless
I love you with so much Tenderness and
Complaisance, and without any Consideration, that
I have the Weakness to concern my for you even
when you wrong me, and your Grief is more sen∣sible
to me than my own: Comfort me only with a
Look, or a Word: But what do I say? <HI>cry'd she,
perceiving his Coldness)</HI> alas! you deny me all.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="54"/>
The Duke mov'd more by Acknowledge∣ment
than Love, drew near unto her, and an∣swered
her Reproaches after so sweet and in∣sinuating
a manner that he a little calm'd her
Anger; and perceiving her Mind to be more
at ease and quiet, he left her, and went to
look after the Countess of—.</P>
<P>In going out of the Marquis of—
Chamber, the first Person he met was the
Confident to the Countess of—. Heaven
has sent you to help me, said he stopping
her, Tell me, Dear <HI>Esther,</HI> where your Lady
is? I ask not the Secret, but to serve her;
and to shew the Affection I have for thee,
here is a Ring, which I must oblige you to
accept of. This staggered her Fidelity:
I do not doubt, my Lord, (said she to him)
but you love my Lady well enough to endea∣vour
at all Methods to deliver her from the
Troubles she is in, but this is not a Place to
speak to you without Danger. You have
put on your Mask to avoid being known.
Reason, said the Duke, follow me at a distance;</P>
<P>He was too impatient to put off this Con∣versation,
which would discover to him
what he wanted to know; and passing by the
Apartment of the Earl of <HI>C—,</HI> Great
Chamberlain to the Queen, and knowlng
that he was not there, he and <HI>Esther</HI> went in.
After having carefully shut the Door, this
Woman began to acquaint him with the Af∣fliction
of her Lady, for having been found
by her Husband in an Assignation with you
in the Park: She then told him the Resolu∣tion
she had taken of going to her Sister, and
after what manner her jealous Husband had
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
stopt her, and his Design of carrying her
down into the Country; that not knowing
how to avoid this Misfortune she had writ a
Note to him, which had been carry'd to the
King; but for fear of any unforeseen Acci∣dent,
she had also sent to my Lord—to
conjure him to find out some way to hinder
her Journey into <HI>Pembrokeshire;</HI> that she
grieved extreamly at the Uncertainty of
what might happen. Her Husband at break
of Day oblig'd her to depart; she sate dis∣consolate
in the Coach, looking every mo∣ment,
and expecting some one to help her,
when my Lord—came in his Coach full
gallop, and in passing by us at one shock
overturn'd us, and descending from his own
Coach came to assist my Lady, he drew her
out, and whisper'd her to retire, and at the
Entry of the Wood she would find a Coach
and a Gentleman who would conduct her to
<HI>Whitehall.</HI> She went directly into the
Wood: During this time the Earl of
—was endeavouring to come out of his
overturn'd Coach, and my Lord—to
hinder him made him a thousand Compli∣ments,
in asking Pardon for the Brutality of
his Coachman, and endeavoured all he could
to gain time. My Lord, I, and one of his
Gentlemen, were all one upon another,
without being able to get our Heads out of
the Coach, by reason of the long and conti∣nual
Civilities of my Lord—, who could
not resolve to leave us. But my Lord, in a
violent Passion, cry'd, <HI>Is it not enough that
you have overthrown my Coach, but would you
also stifle me? If you desire it,</HI> answer'd my
Lord—coldly, <HI>I will turn off my Coachman
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
and my Postilion; for there is nothing I would
not do to preserve the Honour of your Lordship's
Friendship.</HI> In ending these Words, which
had put my Lord quite out of Patience, he
went into his Coach, and we set up ours.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible to express the Fury of our
jealous Husband, when turning round about
him, every where he miss'd his Wife; and
having ask'd his Servants, they said, they
knew nothing of her: He did not question
in the least but that she had taken this Op∣portunity
of giving him the slip; but as he
had thought it most proper to persist in his
first Resolution of making no Noise or Di∣sturbance,
he put a serene Countenance upon
the matter, and with an audible Voice told
them, that without doubt she was gone back
to <HI>London.</HI> We took the same way imme∣diately,
and I found his Mind distracted with
a thousand various Agitations. He was no
sooner come home, but he shut himself up in
his Closet, whilst I laboured under a thou∣sand
Inquietudes to know whither she
was gone, till a Gentleman of the Countess
of <HI>F—</HI> came to tell me, that I must come
to her thither. I went immediately, and
meeting with her in the Countess's Chamber,
she told me part of what I have been rela∣ting
just now to you; and discovered much
Uneasiness at the Discharge of the Lord
—, who had promised to return like∣wise.
She bid me go and find him out;
which I did immediately; and because I will
hide nothing from you, I must tell you, I
found him in a most cruel Passion. Go,
said he, go tell thy Mistress, she is unwor∣thy
of the Addresses of a Man of Honour.
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
What has happened this Day will not be easi∣ly
forgotten by me; and beg of her by all
means not to trouble me any more. I was
just returning, continued <HI>Esther,</HI> to bring
her this glorious Answer when I met you.
The D. of <HI>Buckingham</HI> sighed at these Words,
with all the Marks of Sadness and Affliction
in his Face; and how can it be imagin'd,
said he, my Lord—should not disclose
more of this matter? His Pretence is, That
happening to open the Door of the Marquis
of—in the dark, he discovered my Mi∣stress
sitting with a Gentleman upon the
Bedside, he turned back full of Despair,
as imagining it could be no body else
but you. Alas! said the Duke, interrupting
her, it was I, but without being so happy as
to be with her: Thou seest, continued he,
the Frailty of my Heart for this ingrateful
Woman, for, Good God! what other Name
can I bestow upon her: The King, the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and my Lord—are in
Love with her; she entertains them, and
conceals it from me; for had she no Inclina∣tion
of bestowing some Favours upon them,
she would have told me what I have learnt
from others. I have several times represent∣ed
to her, said <HI>Esther,</HI> she ought to impart
the matter to you: But she feared to put you
into a Fit of Jealousy; and I can protest to
you, that if she has shewn any more favoura∣ble
Disposition for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
than the rest, you must thank your self for
it, since she had no other Design than to raise
a jealous Emulation in you. After your
falling out at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> you know you were
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
entirely reconciled together, and she re∣ceived
your Services with all possible Ac∣knowledgment
and Esteem, and the D. of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI>
(who had got another Mistress) being be∣come
altogether indifferent to her, she thought
she had best not to mention any thing fur∣ther
to you upon that score. As to my Lord
—she had so much Indifferency for him,
that she look'd upon him as next to nothing;
and the King himself with all his Greatness
could never obtain any Favours from her.
How dextrous thou be'st, said the Duke in∣terrupting
her, in endeavouring to alleviate
my Grief, and justify thy Mistress! Go,
offer her all that is in my Power, tell her
that since I could love her, when I thought
her inconstant, I can do every thing now I
flatter my self of not being hated. Come,
return, make haste to tell me; know what
course she intends to take. Whilst the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was at Supper in the Earl of
—Lodgings, he expected with much Im∣patience
the return of <HI>Est<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> but it grow∣ing
late, he went himself to the Countess of
of <HI>F—</HI> to be inform'd in Person of what
he was so desirous to know. He found her
laid upon a Couch with a Handkerchief in
her Hand, and her Cheeks bathed with
Tears, <HI>O! my Lord,</HI> cry'd she, so soon as
she saw him, <HI>you come too late; the poor Conn∣tess
of—is gone.</HI> The Duke stood mute,
having no Power to speak, and the Colour
of his Face chang'd several times; <HI>I am going,</HI>
continued she, <HI>to relate to you the Consequence
of the most unfortunate Accident that ever hap∣pened.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="59"/>
Whilst you were with <HI>Esther,</HI> at the
Earl of—, where she related to you several
material Passages relating to her Mistress, her
Husband was at the same time in the next Room,
overhearing every Word that pass'd betwixt you,
and consequently is become Master of those Secrets
he was ignorant of before. The King being in
his Wife's Interest, he has not thought sit to crave
his Protection, as he intended to do; but hauing
got Intelligence that after her coming out of the
Marquess of—Lodgings she came into mine,
he came and surprized us together; <HI>Esther</HI> co∣ming
in at the same moment, he forced her to con∣fess
in my Presence every thing she had told you
before; and then turning to his Wife, with a
Countenance full of Anger, Madam, <HI>said he,</HI>
there needs no further Consideration in the matter,
I am resolved to take you with me, either by fair
or foul means, make the best or the worst of it,
as you find it most convenient, and as may be
most proper to keep up some remnants of your Re∣putation:
Don't act your part so much in publick.
I have shown a great deal of Moderation, to con∣ceal
both my Shame and Trouble, but if you sorce
me to publish it, remember you are lost for ever.
The Countess bursting out into Tears, look'd upon
me with a melancholly Air, and so did I upon her,
without being able to advise her in the matter.
Her jealous Husband told her, that if she did not
go along with him, he would break off with her
for good and all. To be short, after a great
many Heats and useless Prayers, she told me she
would rather submit to any thing than to come
to an open Rupture with her Husband; and so
she went after him, with <HI>Esther,</HI> but where he
intended to carry her I was not able to learn.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> having kept Si∣lence
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
all this while, began now to break out
into the most passionate Expressions in the
World; <HI>Why, Madam,</HI> cry'd he, <HI>would you
not send for me? Do you think that this unreason∣able
Husband of hers ought to take her away against
her will? Before I would have suffered such a thing
I would have lost my Life. 'Twas my Opinion,</HI>
reply'd the Countess of <HI>F—, I ought
to expose neither of you to such Hazards; you are
so little Master of the first Motions of your Passion,
that perhaps you might not have remember'd that
Place you were in; and tho' the King has a singu∣lar
Kindness for you, yet you know that he will have
a due respect shewn unto his Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Alas! Ma∣dam,</HI>
said the Duke interrupting her very
hastily, <HI>is this the Respect to be shewn to suffer
a poor Woman to be taken away by a mad, furious
Husband? She sought for shel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er in your Arms,
and you had not Courage enough to keep her there,
nor to let me know of her Misfortune. But,</HI> con∣tinued
he, <HI>what signifies trifling away the time
with vain Reproaches, we must consider of means
for her Service.</HI> He was going away, but was
met by my Lord—upon the Stairs:
This Lord not able any longer to resist his
Passion, in spite of the indifferent Treatment
he had received at the Countess's Hands, and
at the Jealousy conceived at the private Cor∣respondence
he thought to have found out
betwixt her and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> had
taken a Resolution to sacrifice his Vexation
to his Love and Generosity; but was ex∣tremely
surprized at the Sight of the Duke;
for seeing him coming out of the Countess of
<HI>F—</HI>'s Lodgings, he did not question but
that the Countess of—had sent for him
thither. He began again to upbraid himself
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
with, and to be asham'd of his Weakness, and
so with a firm Resolution of vanquishing his
Passion, went away hastily.</P>
<P>Stay a moment, <HI>cry'd the Duke accosting
him,</HI> I know in some measure what it is disturbs
you; I am under an Obligation of justifying to
you an unfortunate but guiltless Person; <HI>the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> re∣lating
to him the Story told just now, he con∣tinued,</HI>
Perhaps looking upon me as your Rival
you judge me not a very proper Instrument to pro∣cure
your Satisfaction, by justifying the Conduct
of the Countess; but there is at present an absolute
Necessity of uniting our selves at this time, till the
Countess being put again into a State of an
entire Liberty to follow her own Inclinations, we
will manage our Pretensions, every one at he best
can. Till then, let us act jointly in order to do her
effectual Service. <HI>If my Lord—had not
been inclined to what the D. of</HI> Buckingham
<HI>proposed, the last had so happy a Gift of Na∣ture,
of perswading People to his Sentiments,
that few were able to withstand him: My
Lord being fully convinced of the necessity
of the case, joined with his Rival to do all
possible Service to their Mistress, carry'd a∣way
by her jealous Husband with an Intention
to carry her to the</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>We will leave them for some time, and see
what became of the Duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. His
Mind had been (whilst they were a hunting)
distracted with very different Fancies<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; he
could not give himself a sufficient Reason
why he should be so sensible of the Infidelity
of the Countess of—, and of <HI>Emilia,</HI>
knowing that his Inclinations for them did
not amount to such a pitch, as to create ei∣ther
Envy or Jealousy in him, as it happens
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
in violent Passions, and that consequently be∣ing
at Liberty to assume new Chains, in case
he could meet with any he liked better,
he nevertheless suffered the indifferent Treat∣ment
of these Ladies; he concluded at
last that Vanity sometimes produces the same
Effects as Love. Sometimes he would contrive
a way to be even with the Countess, somtimes
what Reproaches to bestow upon <HI>Emilia:</HI> He
felt a secret Pleasure to think how his In∣treagues
with this young Lady might take
vent at Court, and furnish him with matter of
Revenge; but soon after, repenting of this
Project, he was for keeping their Ap∣pointment
private, in hopes that by his
obliging and engaging Words he might
raise solid and sincere Love in her Heart.
These were his Amusements during the
Hunting-match. As for the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> he
was extremely impatient to see <HI>Emilia,</HI> and
to have an opportunity of talking with her,
which was no easie matter to do, consi∣dering
the Governess of the Maids of Ho∣nour
afforded them but little leisure. As
this Lady was naturally of a jealous Dispo∣sition,
so she had found means to get intelli∣gence
of the intended Interview betwixt the
Earl and <HI>Emilia,</HI> which she resolved to spoil
at any rate; besides considering, that if she
could catch them together, she would have
a fair pretence of Reprimanding her in the
most bitter Terms that well could be: So
the satisfaction she proposed to herself, of
convincing this young Woman of her fault,
carrying it above all other Considerations,
which might have perswaded her to act with
more moderation, she was so far from keep∣ing
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
so watchful an Eye over her, as she used
to do, that she allow'd her more liberty
than ordinary. <HI>Emilia</HI> was ready enough
to improve it; she pretended to go into her
Chamber to write, but slipping down a pair
of private Stairs, got into another Room,
without being perceiv'd by any body. It
being a clear Moon-light Night, she shut
the Shutters, and then placed herself in one
corner of the Room, to avoid being seen, in
case some body else should happen to come
that way.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was too desirous
to see her to let her tarry, but entred the
Room exactly at the appointed time; whilst
<HI>Emilia,</HI> who feared less any body but the
Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> should come in, kept close
in her Corner, hoping he would open the
Shutters and discover himself; but the Duke,
whose business was not to be seen, kept in
the dark, asking only with a low voice, <HI>are
you there? Pray answer me: Emilia,</HI> who did
not question but that it was the Earl, answer∣ed,
<HI>Yes I am.</HI> 'Tis hard to guess at the va∣rious
motions this adventure raised in the
Duke's Heart: He was overjoy'd at so fa∣vourable
an opportunity of entertaining this
young Lady, but almost distracted to think
that the appointment should not be of his
own making: He look'd upon it as inglori∣ous,
to usurp thus his Rival's place; and
more than once was in a mind to go away,
but at last drew nearer: She told him, <HI>Do you
see, my Lord, what I do for you, only to speak
with you? Is not this sufficient to convince you
that you have the preference in my Heart? and
hereafter I hope you will not torment me, on ac∣count

of the Duke of</HI> Monmouth. <HI>Is it possible,</HI>
said he, (with a disguised Voice) <HI>that you can
Sacrifice him for me? and that you have no In∣clinations
for him? I will Sacrifice him to you
with all my Heart,</HI> reply'd she; <HI>but as I love to
deal upon Honour, I won't deny but that he ap∣pears
worthy of Love to me. I have observed,</HI>
said he, interrupting her, <HI>that he loves you,
and that he is very fond of telling you so; nay
there appears a certain languishment in his Eyes,
when he is with you, which is not observable
in him, in the Company of other Ladies. I have
my self taken notice of that,</HI> added <HI>Emilia; I
believe I am not altogether indifferent to him. He
has made his brags,</HI> said he, <HI>that you have pro∣mised
him a share in your Heart; and that if he
will continue to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rve you, you would break off
with me. I am surprized,</HI> replied she, <HI>how he
dare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to say such an untruth! And you are sur∣prized
thereat,</HI> (said the Duke, reassuming his
natural Voice) <HI>you are surpriz'd, ungrateful
Woman? And you are come hither to sacrifice my
Passion, and your Oaths.</HI></P>
<P>Emilia <HI>discovering him to be the Duke of</HI>
Monmouth, <HI>with such a commotion as is easy
to be imagined, stood for some time like one
struck dumb; and the Duke was going to
leave her, when she stept to him, and said,</HI>
Oh! my Lord, hear me one minute! I am a going
to tell what you will not dislike: 'Tis you alone I
Love, and you alone have all my Esteem. That
is plain, Madam, <HI>answered he,</HI> it appears so;
you could have taken no better method to convince
me. What would you have me do, <HI>said she, with
tears in her Eyes?</HI> I was no sooner brought to
Court, but the Earl made his most passionate Ad∣dresses
to me, and quitted my Lady—, who
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>
lov'd him most dearly. Seeing my vanity, and
my self thus flatter'd, by the preference given me
to so lovely a Lady, my heart, then as yet in the
first State of its Innocency, received with pleasure
the sighs of this new Lover, who I thought would
have Married me, after the Death of his Coun∣tess,
who had been very Ill for a considerable time.
Flattered with these hopes, I was the sooner in∣duced
to receive his Letters, and send him some
of mine. Alas! I am disclosing to you such mat∣ters
as are much to my disadvantage, on purpose
to make you sensible at least of this, that after be∣ing
engaged so far with a Person of so little Mo∣deration,
and of so cholerick a Disposition, I saw
my self obliged, in spight of my self, to tread in
the path I had so imprudently chosen. Would you,
my Lord, have me exposed to his ill Tongue? and
would you think me worthy of your Affection, af∣ter
having lost my Reputation in the World?
<HI>These words being accompanied with tears,
the D. of</HI> Monmouth <HI>was actually perswaded
of her Innocency. He had lov'd her since her
Engagement with the Earl of</HI> A—n, <HI>and he
had too good an opinion of his own deserts, as
not to believe himself to hold the best place
in her Heart beyond his Rival. His only care
was now how to maintain this favourable Dis∣position
in her. Whilst they are taking
proper measures for the continuing of their
Intreague, we must see what passes in the
Queen's Gallery, betwixt my Lady—
and the Earl of</HI> A—n. <HI>He was no sooner re∣turn'd
from Hunting with the King, but he
dress'd himself as nice as he could, to appear
the more amiable in the Eyes of his Mistress.
My Lady—on the other hand, the better
to counterfeit</HI> Emilia, <HI>who was then in Mour∣ning,
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
had dress'd herself in a Night Dress,
which almost cover'd her Face: Thus she
entred the Gallery thro' a By-door, but the
Earl thro' the Queen's Apartment; there
being no other light but what proceeded
from the clearness of a bright shining Moon.
My Lady—had posted herself in one Cor∣ner;
the Earl drawing nearer, took her by
the Hands, and kiss' them;</HI> Charming <HI>Emilia,
said he,</HI> 'tis at this time you dispel all my Jea∣lousie;
so that now I should be distracted with the
very Thoughts of it, were it not an undeniable proof
of my Passion and Tenderness; for which you
ought to stand indebted to me. <HI>Good God! what
strange and cruel Emotions did these words
cause in my Lady—</HI>'s <HI>Heart, to see the on∣ly
Man in the World, for whom she had had
the greatest Tenderness, to play her such a
Game? She had not strength enough left to
return an answer; but the Earl being not
much surpriz'd at her silence, continued,</HI> You
are afraid, fair <HI>Emilia,</HI> lest this favour you have
done me should be discovered; you seem to be un∣easie,
you tremble; take courage, and don't re∣fuse
to give me some assurance of your Friendship.
Oh! what am I to tell you, <HI>reply'd my Lady—,
with a voice changed so far by her surprize,
as not to need any disguise?</HI> what must I tell
you, my Lord? I am not so much affected with
the apprehension of being found alone with you
here, tho' my All lays at stake, as with the dread
I have, that you are still in Love with my Lady
—. I be in love with her, <HI>said the Earl!</HI> do
you think I have lost my Senses? Is there any com∣parison
betwixt your Charms and hers? betwixt
a growing Passion, and one worn out before? be∣twixt
a Woman continually out of humour with
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
me, and a young Lady I adore? But my Lord,
<HI>said she, interrupting him,</HI> you owe her a thou∣sand
Obligations, you have sworn to be true to her
for ever, and if you can forget her so soon, what
must I hope for from you? The Favours she has
bestowed upon me, <HI>said he,</HI> were more the pro∣ducts
of her own Capriciousness than her choice;
'tis to chance I was obliged for her Esteem; and
notwithstanding she does not want wit, she herself
can't give a good reason for it.</P>
<P><HI>At these words my Lady—, not able
to contain herself any longer,</HI> O! thou
most perfidious of all Men, <HI>cry'd she!</HI> Is
it not enough for you▪ thus to forego your Duty,
but you must also poison those Favours for which
you stand indebted to me by turning them into Ri∣dicule,
and representing them as the effects of a
capri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious Folly? But after all, <HI>added she,</HI> you
speak truth; for I must certainly be prepossessed with
a most extravagant Folly, when I heard and be∣lieved
you. Are these the Products of your Cro∣codil's
Tears, and of your reiterated Vows? Go
perjur'd Man, I leave you to your self, and the
Remorses of your own Heart; I am sufficiently
revenged, since I have Resolution enough left to
tear you from my Heart. <HI>She had not put an
an end here to her just Reproaches, when my
Lord standing all this while so full of Confu∣sion
as not to be able to answer one Word;
and as these harsh Expressions gave some ease
to her Mind, she was going to continue her
Discourse, had not a most surprizing Acci∣dent
put a Period to their Conversation.</HI></P>
<P>This was occasioned by the coming in of
the Governess and Deputy-Governess of the
Ladys of Honour to the Dutchess of—.
These having posted themselves at the little
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
Door of the Gallery, and seeing her pass by
that way, took her for <HI>Emilia.</HI> Some time
after entring the Gallery, they fell upon her
like so many Furies, whilst the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI>
little concern'd at what might become
of her, took this opportunity of getting
away as fast as he could, but not without be∣ing
vex'd to the Heart, to have met with so
vexatious an Encounter, instead of the Satis∣faction
he expected from the meeting with
<HI>Emilia:</HI> Amidst all this he found some sort
of Consolation at the coming in of these two
Matrons, who did all they could to get my
Lady—out of the Corner, where she stood
upon the defensive, like in an Entrenchment,
and that so courageously (for fear of being
discover'd) that they could scarce come near
her; at last finding her Hands insufficient to
withstand their furious Attacks, she took hold
of the Earls Cane, which he had forgot to take
along with him when he left her, and laid them
on with it so briskly, that they were forced
to have recourse to their Clogs or Caloches,
(such as the <HI>English</HI> Ladies then wore) which
after having served some time for defensive
Arms, at last turned into offensive ones, and
most cruelly maul'd the poor Lady; who be∣ginning
now to have much the worst of it,
began to be heartily weary of the Sport. At
that very Juncture the D. of <HI>Monmouth</HI> brought
thither by his Curiosity to see the event of this
Night's Appointment, enter'd the Gallery,
attended by a Footman with a lighted Flam∣beau
in his Hand. Had the Head of <HI>Medusa</HI>
appear'd to them instead of the Flambeau, their
Surprize could not have been greater than it
was! The two Governesses stood as immove∣ble
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
as two Statues at the sight of my Lady—,
She on the other ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, was so full of Affli∣ction
at her being discover'd by these two
Matrons, as well as at her Conversation with
the Earl, that she did not know what to do;
the Cane dropt out of her Hands, and at the
same time the Governesses threw away their
Caloches with great Indignation, muttering
betwixt their Teeth, that those who had di∣rected
them thither should repent of having
sent them upon such an errand, and so they
went their ways.</P>
<P><HI>They were no sooner gone, but my Lady
—having order'd the Footman to keep at
a distance, and falling into a Chair, and look∣ing
upon the D. of</HI> Monmouth <HI>with Eyes full of
Tears and Anger,</HI> O! my Lord, <HI>said she sigh∣ing,</HI>
how much is an agreeable Mistake preferable
before a cruel Certainty? I now am convinced be∣yond
all Contradiction, that the Earl loves <HI>Emilia,</HI>
that he is a perfidious Man, and that he deals
with me after such a manner as can never be par∣doned
by me. Why are you dissatisfied, Madam,
<HI>reply'd he,</HI> to be convinced in a matter you ought
to wish not to be ignorant of? Would it not vex
you to the Soul to preserve your Heart for an un∣grateful
Person? And who has told you, <HI>return'd
she abruptly,</HI> that I am so indifferent as to be able
to banish at once from my Heart a Man who in∣deed
deserves to appear odious to me, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who still
seems worthy to be beloved? My Reason tells me I
should hate him, but my Heart pleads for his Pardon;
this rebellious Heart of mine, so little concerned
in the true Interests of my Honour, will still speak
in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour of a Man, who would not as much as af∣ford
me one Sigh to appease my Anger. Had you but
seen, <HI>added she,</HI> how quickly he got away, when these
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
two old Croatures came in. You would have been
out of Countenance to see me in so dismal a Condi∣tion.
<HI>At these Words her Tears flow'd down
all over her Cheeks and Face, which she en∣deavoured
to hide with her Fan; and so ari∣sing
from her Seat, the Duke gave her his
Hand, and conducted her to her Lodgings.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> was involved in no
less Troubles of Mind, than her self; so to
allay his Grief, he went to the Dutchess's—
to find out <HI>Emilia,</HI> and to reproach her with
what she had done; being fully perswaded
that no body but herself had contrived the
Meeting betwixt my Lady—, and himself
in the Gallery. Thus he went with an in∣tention
to make her sensible how grievously
he Resented the matter, but was no sooner
come into the Guard Chamber, when he was
told there was no admittance at the Dutchess's
—, she being not well; if he was out of
humour in his being disappointed of the sight
of <HI>Emilia,</HI> he flattered himself, that this ac∣cident
had prevented this young Lady from
coming abroad. A Lover never wants in∣genuity
to excuse his Beloved; he then be∣gan
to imagine she had no hand in this Ad∣ventu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
with my Lady—, and consequently
his Resentment was much allay'd.</P>
<P>In effect it was not from <HI>Emilia</HI> that the
Governess had got notice of this matter, but
from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> one of her Companions,
who having found out that Secret, could not
keep it to herself, it being certain, that it was
not out of Jealousie only, she had conceived
against <HI>Emilia,</HI> she being as handsome as her
self, and having a greater share of Wit, and
what other Charms <HI>Emilia</HI> could boast of,
<HI>viz.</HI> a certain merry and innocent Air, which
was extremely pleasing.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="71"/>
<HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as she was somewhat older,
so she acted with more Circumspecti∣on;
she covered her Passion for the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> under the Veil of
a languishing State of Health; and
under this disguise penetrated into
the Sentiments and Actions of the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in respect to her Rival;
and finding him successful with her, she
fell into a deep Melancholy; As she
had conceived a mortal Spite against
him, for loving another besides her
self, she would often launch out into
harsh Expressions, whilst at the same
time her Heart declared in his behalf.
Moreover, these ways, so directly op∣posite
to the tenderness usual among
Lovers, so far alienated the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Heart, that he would scarce
ever come near her: This proving an
additional Grief to a Person of a haugh∣ty
Temper, she was consumed by a
Fire she was not able to quench,
she turned her Spite against <HI>Emilia,</HI>
with a Resolution to give her a Blow,
without telling her who it was that gave
it. <HI>Philadelphia</HI> had shut her self up
all that Evening in her Chamber, on
purpose to reflect upon the Disgrace
that would attend <HI>Emilia,</HI> in being sur∣prized
with the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> whilst she
was expecting with much Impatience,
the return of the Governess, and De∣puty-Governess,
when she heard some∣body
knock, and not very hard at her
<PB N="82" REF="72"/>
Door, she open'd it. Great was her Sur∣prize,
who when she saw the Governess
looking upon her with an austere Coun∣tenace,
at the same time, ask'd her,
what Reward she intended to bestow
upon her News-bearers, and that since
by her Rashness she had misled them in∣to
a foolish Notion, she was likely to
stand the brunt of it. <HI>Philadelphia</HI>
stood amazed, and tells them, that she
had seen <HI>Emilia</HI> receiving a Billet from
the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> and that standing just
behind her, she could read both the
Letter, and her Answer to it. Yes,
you have read very well, said the Go∣verness,
witness what has pass'd just
now. Whilst they were disputing the
matter, in comes <HI>Emilia,</HI> having just
then left the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who
having related to her in what manner
he had imposed upon the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> they
had diverted themselves to his Cost,
but she little thought of the Recep∣tion
she was to meet with from the en∣raged
Governess. They no sooner saw
her enter the Room, but both took
hold of her Arms, asking her three or
four times very abruptly, where she
had been, and from whence she came?
<HI>Emilia</HI> was much surprized, imagining
she had been over-heard, she blush'd,
and her Eyes were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixed on the Ground;
at last, after having paused a while,
to consider what she should say, she
answered, From the Princess—They
<PB N="83" REF="73"/>
reply'd, she must tell them who was
there besides, and what had pass'd
there, or else they would immediately
go to find out the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Truth. Seeing her
self touch'd to the quick by these home
Questions, she told them briefly, That
Thanks to God, there was no such thing
as an Inqusition in <HI>England,</HI> and there∣fore
she did not think fit to answer all
their ensnaring Questions, and if they
had a mind to know what pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s'd at the
Princess—their best way was to go
thither to be inform'd. This haughty
Answer, given by a young Woman
to the before exasperated Governess,
was follow'd by a severe Reprimand
from them, who told her, they would
give an Account of her Behaviour to
the Dutchess of—But <HI>Emilia</HI> knowing
her at that time not to be in a Conditi∣on
of hearkning to such like matters,
stood it out couragiously, and she was
not in the wrong of it, for had she ap∣pear'd
more mild, it might have been
interpreted by her Enemies, to her
Disadvantage.</P>
<P><HI>In the mean while, my Lady—
had the worst Night of it she ever saw
in her Days; she was a Person of Ho∣nour
and Wit; she knew her felf be∣tray'd
by a Person whom she was not
able to hate, and yet was reduc'd to
such a</HI> Nonplus, <HI>as to be oblig'd either
to break off with him for ever, or to
submit to fresh Pains and Sufferings
<PB N="84" REF="74"/>
every Day.</HI> O unseasonable Curiosities,
<HI>cry'd she,</HI> what could I pretend to by disgui∣sing
my self under the Shape of <HI>Emilia?</HI>
Ought not I first to have consulted my own
Heart, before I undertook to convince this
ungrateful Man of his Infidelity? I should
have been sensible of all my Frailty. This
would have been a sure way to prevent me
from making those Steps to be satisfy'd of
his Ingratitude. But now I am not in a Con∣dition
to act at my own Pleasure; he will
look upon me no otherwise, than upon an ir∣reconcileable
Enemy, or as a Person against
which he has too much Odds, to fear her, or
perhaps he will be so indifferent, as not to come
near me, or see me, unless it be to insult over
me. Ʋnto what a most cruel Extremity
have I been reduc'd, by the Advice of the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth?</HI> Alas! I had not
Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enough to penetrate into that Design,
when I engaged to personate <HI>Emilia,</HI> he there∣by
secured himself a fafe Meeting with her;
and so those two Lovers, happy at my Ex∣pence,
enjoy'd the benefit of what time I had
prepared for them. <HI>This last Consideration
raised in her Breast more anguish than
all the rest, and not being able to
brook her having been made the Bub∣ble,
she now thought of nothing less,
than how to discover the whole Secret
to the E. of</HI> A—n <HI>and to make him
sensible, in what manner he had been
inpos'd upon.</HI> He is too much at his Ease,
<HI>said she,</HI> I must not leave him thus at his
quiet, and if not in regard to me, at least
<PB N="85" REF="75"/>
I will raise in him a Jealousy against the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth. All her Servants
were gone to Bed, notwithstanding
which she call'd one of her Women,
and having order'd her to bring in
Candles, she writ these Words:</HI></P>
<P>At last, my Lord, you receive the same
Treatment I did before. <HI>Emilia,</HI> your
charming <HI>Emilia,</HI> is unfaithful; she was
with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> at the same
Moment you look'd for her in the Gallery;
don't you deserve to be treated thus? You, I
say, who by your Behaviour towards me
make your self unworthy of meeting with
better Treatment from others. She despised
such a Conquest as yours, as much as it is
despisable in it self; and, if she pretends to
set any value upon it, it is only to enhaunce
the price of the Sacrifice she is going to make
of it to your Rival. Adieu, ungrateful
Man, 'tis but reason you should enjoy
no more Quietness this Night than I
do, but with this difference, that I hope to
pass, before it is long, my Time with more
Tranquility than you. Send this Letter back
by the Bearer.</P>
<P>The Letter being sealed up, she or∣dered
one of her <HI>Valets de Chambre</HI> to
give to the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> to have him
awakened, and to deliver it to him.
The Earl did not rest so quietly as my
Lady—imagined, being taken up
with ruminating upon this Adven∣ture,
<PB N="86" REF="76"/>
not without conceiving some
Jealousy against <HI>Emilia,</HI> which was
strangely hightned by this Letter. He
could not imagine what could move
her to write at so late an Hour; the
more when he considered the Subject
of it; he read it over several times;
he ruminated upon the matter, and
appeared so distracted with Thoughts,
that the <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> of my Lady
—(who had been order'd to ob∣serve
nar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owly his Behaviour) said, he
could believe no otherwise, than that
he had been the Bearer of some very
bad News. He ask'd him several times
whether he intended to send an Answer
by him to his Mistress, and at last the
Earl writ the following Words at the
bottom of my Lady—Letter.</P>
<P>You are too charitable, Madam, in im∣parting
to me the Treacheries acted against
me. I scarce ever imagined you would have
been willing to be my Confident, but since you
have thought fit to be so, I am ready to trust
you also with my Secrets, and assure you,
that <HI>Emilia</HI> having thought fit to make me
her Bubble, I am resolved to find out a way
to punish her so severely, as may abundantly
revenge your Quarrel; and perhaps, in the
consequence of my Procedure, you will meet
with some reason to pardon me, for what you
so much complain of now.</P>
<P>Having given a strict charge to the
<HI>Valet,</HI> to deliver the Billet into his Mi∣stresses
Hands, he abandon'd himself
<PB N="87" REF="77"/>
to the most melancholly Reflections that
can well be imagined; sometimes he
would fain have call'd in question the
truth of this Advice, and of the Per∣son
that sent it, since her Sincerity
might be well suspected in a matter of
this nature: But after all, he could not
but believe it at last, even in spite of
himself, and nothing being more natu∣ral,
than to believe what we fear; he
would not have questioned the Truth,
even if there had been less Probability
in it than really there was. He actually
loved <HI>Emilia,</HI> and had been beloved by
her; but the Sweets he had enjoy'd in
her Conversation, now served only to
render her Infidelity the more bitter,
and insupportable. He was very haugh∣ty,
discerning, and of a high Rank,
and being sensible of his great Quali∣fications,
they could not but inspire him
with a most violent Resentment against
his Mistress. On the other hand, con∣sidering
that nothing but his Indiffe∣rency
to my Lady—could have
brought upon him this Disgrace, he
could not but reproach himself, for
having abandon'd the finest Woman at
Court, who treated him with so much
Tenderness, and had preferred him be∣fore
so many Rivals of the greatest
Quality; reflecting, I say, that after
having thought himself beloved by two
Ladies at once, and being closely put to
it which to chuse, he now could not
<PB N="88" REF="78"/>
make sure of either, distracted with
these Thoughts, he did not shut his
Eyes all the remaining part of the
Night, till towards Morning, being then
quite spent with Thoughts, as it hap∣pens,
when People find themselves tor∣mented
with such-like Passions. It was
very late, when he heard some body
exchanging some Words with one of
his <HI>Vale<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s de Chambre,</HI> so he asked, who
was there: The E. of S. <HI>Albans</HI> entring
the Room, told him: I believe all your
Servants have agreed to try my Pati∣ence;
I have spent near an Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r in
coming to your Chamber-door, and in
perswading them to open it for me, so
I was going away just now. The E. of
<HI>A—n</HI> having begg'd his Pardon for
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpertinency of his Servants, ask'd
whether he could do him any Service.
The E. of <HI>S. Albans</HI> seeing himself a∣lone
with him, I bring back to you,
<HI>said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he,</HI> a Letter, which you will be
surprized to see in my Hands: Here∣upon
he produced the Letter, written
by my Lady—to him, with his
Answer at the bottom: What can this
mean, <HI>cry'd the Earl of</HI> A—n, pray ex∣plain
to me a Riddle, too intricate for
me to unfold. I will tell you in a few
Words, <HI>reply'd the Earl:</HI> About four
Days ago, the King having received In∣formation,
that there was some Con∣spiracy
set on foot in <HI>London,</HI> against
the Government, and being willing to
<PB N="89" REF="79"/>
find out the bottom of it without
much Noise, ordered the Guards to
Watch; and to seize, without Distin∣ction,
all they should meet in the
Night-time. My Lady—'s <HI>Va∣let
de Chambre</HI> was already got a pretty
way from your House, when being
stopt, and searched, he begg'd heartily
to have the Letter restor'd to him, but
being without a Superscription, and
therefore the more suspected, of con∣taining
some Secret of State, the poor
Fellow was committed to Prison, and
carry'd this Morning before the King.
The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and I happen∣ing
just then to be there, he ordered
me to open the Letter, and to read out a∣loud
the Contents thereof: He was not
in the least surprized at your Corre∣spondence
with my Lady—but
was at your Change, and the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Passion for <HI>Emilia,</HI> but could
not forbear laughing at the oddness of
the Chance, which made this Letter
fall into his Hands. He look'd upon
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> with an Air,
that discovered more of pleasantness
than Anger; Well, <HI>said he to him,</HI> how
long will you be unfaithful to your
Wife? Do you never intend to fix
your Love? Sir, <HI>replyed the Duke,</HI> these
are only slight Amusements, we take
to ease our selves, after being tired
with serious Matters. Truly, said the
King, you have then abundance of
<PB N="90" REF="80"/>
serious Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iness in your Head, because
your Hand has such frequent occasion
for Amusements. He being nettled
and asham'd, you might have seen the
Marks of his Anger in his Face; and
drawing nearer, was going to take
the Letter out of my Hand; but I
fearing least his Spite against my
Lady—might induce him to put
it to an ill use, desired him to let me
keep it, till I could restore it to her
self. She does not deserve the Esteem
you have for her, <HI>said he,</HI> so as that the
King might understand him, and wear it
only for Revenge-sake, you might not
let slip so happy an Opportunity as this.
The King fell a laughing again; and,
<HI>said he,</HI> I am sure the E. of <HI>S. Albans</HI>
has long ago sealed my Lady—'s
Pardon, in respect to the preference
she gave to the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> before
him; for I know him to be very indulg∣ing
to the Ladies, and he never cares to
vex them. Your Majesty does me Ju∣stice,
<HI>reply'd I,</HI> I own I extreamly loved
this Lady, and that if she had been
pleased, she might have turn'd me
which way she would, but I can't hate
her, and the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> is too much
my Friend, that I should not give way
to him upon such an occosion as this.
The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did not relish
my Opinion. Here, <HI>said he,</HI> is a piece
of Generosity, without Comparison;
for my part, against whom my Lady—
<PB N="91" REF="81"/>
has spit her Venome, after I had made
her a sharer in my Secrets, and since
she has made such ill use of it, I am re∣solved
to tell her, she is the most
indiscreet, and the most malicious of
all Women living. The King leaving
his Closet, <HI>added the Earl of S.</HI> Albans, I
made all the hast I could with the Let∣ter,
to let you know what had pass'd,
for I don't question, but that the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> is gone to harangue this
poor afflicted Lady. Did ever you see
such an unfortunate Accident, said the
E. of <HI>A—n,</HI> when I reflect upon what
prejudice she has conceived against me,
I am confident she will accuse me as the
Author of all the Mischief; and me∣thinks
I am already so sensible of the
Violence of <HI>Emilia,</HI> that I need nothing
more to add to my Vexation, My
Lord, <HI>continued he,</HI> 'tis impossible to
make you sensible of the Obligation I
think I owe you, for what you have
done upon this Account, when it was
in your power to create me new Trou∣bles,
but you are convinced by the
Letter it self, that I am no more your
Rival. 'Tis a good while ago, <HI>replyed
the E. of S.</HI> Albans, since I have quitted
that Pretension, I am at present in a
Condition to see all what pass'd, with∣out
the least Disturbance. Would it
please Heaven, <HI>cryd the Earl of</HI> A—n
Would it please Heaven I could say so too
in respect to <HI>Emilia.</HI> Whilst they were
<PB N="92" REF="82"/>
discoursing the matter betwixt them,
my Lady—'s <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI>
thought it the nearest way to get his
Liberty, to give notice to his Mistress
of what had happen'd, whilst she pass'd
every moment under most dreadful Ap∣prehensions,
not knowing what to think
of his long stay, especially, after
having sent several Messengers to the
E. of <HI>A—n</HI> to enquire after him, but
could learn no more, than that he was
gone from my Lords, immediately af∣ter
he had received his Answer. Thus
tormented with a thousand different
Inquietudes, she had not rested one
minute; at last she receives a Letter
from her <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> containing
an Account of the whole Adventure,
and how the E. of <HI>A—n</HI>'s Letter was
taken from him. Good God! what an
addition of Misery proved this dismal
News to the poor, my Lady—
to see her Letter exposed to others,
and perhaps fallen into the Hands of
her Enemies whereof handsome Ladies
have not a few. She considered, that
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> disobliged, <HI>Emi∣lia</HI>
exposed, and the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> treat∣ed
worse than all the rest. She knew
not what to do, or on what side the
Storm was like to break out first, when
word was brought, that the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> was come to pay her a Visit.
He had parted with her the Night be∣fore,
with uncommon Demonstration
<PB N="93" REF="83"/>
of Friendship, and shewn himself so
far concerned in her Troubles concei∣ved
at her Encounter with the E.
of <HI>A—n</HI> and the Governesses, that it
was no great matter of wonder, if he
came to know how she had done the
last Night; but her Heart foreboded
nothing that relish'd of Peace or Tran∣quility.
She was pondering with her
felf what to say to the Duke in case he
had heard any thing of her Letter; and
so neglecting to give Orders for his be∣ing
admitted into her Chamber, the
Duke, impatient of Delays, enters ab∣ruptly,
and by the Looks he gave her,
sufficiently discovered the Sentiments
of his Heart. He was just going to
speak, when she interrupting him, Oh!
my Lord, <HI>said she,</HI> come finish the
Work, in quite overwhelming me with
Grief; come reproach me with my
Frailty, come pour out all your inju∣rious
Expressions against me; I deserve
your Wrath, and have no other Arms
left to defend my self against them,
than a sincere Confession of my Faults.
When you commit such indiscreet
Actions, <HI>said the Duke to her,</HI> when
you take delight in ruining a young
Lady of Quallity, and that for no other
Crime, in respect to you, than to be
liked by the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> what can you
expect from those Persons who profess
themselves her Friends? I expect no∣thing
less than their utmost Anger,
<PB N="94" REF="84"/>
<HI>reply'd my Lady—</HI> and I am rea∣dy
to submit to every thing, without
Complaint, without looking for Revenge.
But if after all, the Fault I commited
in disclosing your Secret, may admit
of some Excuse, put your self in my
place, and reflect, what a Woman is,
enraged with Spite and Envy. Re∣member,
'tis hard to preserve your
Reason, when you lose all you love,
and that I had no better way of be∣ing
revenged of the Earl. If after this,
my Lord, you don't think me suffici∣ently
unhappy, add to my Affliction,
by the most cruel Torments you can
invent. She appear'd so much afflicted
at these Words, and so fair in
his Eyes, that the Duke, who before
had had some Inclinations of her Love
(to which he was scarce able to resist)
could not find in his Heart, to give her
any further occasion of Trouble. The
Condition you are in at present, Ma∣dam,
<HI>said he,</HI> is a sufficient Revenge to
me, and I should upbraid my self,
should I add new occasion of Inquie∣tude
to your Troubles, but at least,
assist me in repairing the Evil you have
created your self. If it be not too late,
<HI>reply'd she,</HI> there is nothing I would not
do; but pray thus far satisfy my Cu∣riosity,
as to tell me how you came
acquainted with the News of this Let∣ter.
The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> seem'd
surpriz'd, and told her, Has not the E.
<PB N="95" REF="85"/>
of <HI>S. Albans</HI> given you already an Ac∣count
of it? Good God! <HI>cry'd she,</HI> who
is it you name? Is it possible, that he,
among the rest, has been acquainted
with my Frailties? The Duke then told
her all that happened before the King;
and that the E. of <HI>S. Albans</HI> had under∣taken
to deliver the Letter to her; at
these Words she appear'd more surpri∣zed
than ever; she very well remem∣bred
what indifferent an Entertain∣ment
she had given to that Lord, and
she could scarce believe, but that he
would revenge his Quarrel. How came
it to pass, <HI>said she,</HI> looking very melan∣cholly
upon the Duke, you would leave
my Letter in his Hands? Is this the
act of a Friend? How, Madam, <HI>said
he,</HI> would you have me be your Friend?
I swear to you, I was so far from
taking your part, that I would have
ruin'd you upon the Spot, and that if
the Letter had come into my Hands,
I would have posted it up. You could
have done nothing better to please <HI>Emi∣lia,</HI>
said she, with a great deal of seem∣ing
Moderation, but such as proceeded
more from a pretence of Prudence,
than from her Inclinations. I could
have been contented, <HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI>
to have ruin'd <HI>Emilia,</HI> provided I could
have involved you in her Ruin; and
when I reflect in what manner I was
betray'd by you, it is impossible for
me to pardon it. Let us not talk of
<PB N="96" REF="86"/>
that any more, my Lord, <HI>said she,</HI> giv∣ing
him her Hand, which he took and
kiss'd (with an eagerness far different
from the Sentiments of an irreconci∣lable
Enemy) I must endeavour to
make you amends, by some good
Offices. Alas! Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> look∣ing
upon her with a most tender Eye,
Don't look for an Opportunity of do∣ing
that any where else, but with your
self, since it is easy to be met with
there: I have lov'd you for a conside∣rable
time; you have always appeared
in my Eyes, one of the most lovely
Women in the World; and if I did not
make my Addresses to you sooner, it
was because I understood, that the E.
of <HI>A—n</HI> had got so firm Footing
there already, that I thought it impos∣sible
to supplant him; but since you
have found him unfaithful, leave him
to his corrupted Palate, and let us make
Peace together. My Lady—
was not of so severe a Temper, as to
be angry with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
for this Declaration of Love, whereby
she might have an Opportunity of be∣ing
revenged of <HI>Emilia;</HI> but judging
rightly, she ought not to take every
thing for Truth, which seem'd to be
spoke to her only by chance, she thought
it best to give a turn of a Jest to what
the Duke had propos'd to her in ear∣nest,
and to break off the Discourse,
she ask'd, where the E. of <HI>S. Albans</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="87"/>
could be all this while with her Letter:
He is questionless, <HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI> with
the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> for of late they are
most intimate Friends. I know the
reason of it, <HI>said she,</HI> and if we have
nothing else to talk of, I can tell it
you. The Duke, without giving her
any Answer, desired her only to
go to the Dutchess of—and to
give notice to <HI>Emilia</HI> of what had hap∣pen'd.
A fine Commission indeed, <HI>re∣ply'd
she,</HI> would you have me go to tell
her what I have done against her? I
have no other way to let her under∣stand
it, <HI>said the Duke,</HI> interrupting her;
and it is no more than an act of Justice,
that after having dealt so ill with her,
you should do her a small good turn:
But, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> do you suppose she will
put the least Confidence in me? I will
write a Letter to her, and you may talk
with her alone. And with what an
Eye would you have me look upon
the Governess, continued my Lady
—after having felt the Blows of
her Catoches; Don't look upon her
at all, <HI>said the Duke,</HI> you are so much
above her, that you are not obliged to
all the strict Rules of Civility with her
Civilities, said my Lady—in an
angry Tone, and her Colour rising in
her Face, I suppose I shall pay her none;
she may be glad if I see her without
scoffing at her. The Duke burst out a
laughing, and she asking him how he
<PB N="98" REF="88"/>
could laugh at things which had try'd
her Patience to the highest Degree.
To tell you the truth, said he to her,
I can't think of that Combat wherein I
saw you engaged last Night with the
two old Matrons, and how nettled you
were, when I saw you, without laugh∣ing
heartily. Truly, said she, with a
sorrowful Air, it was a pleasant Sight,
and considering you propose to per∣swade
me, that you have a peculiar E∣steem
for me, you take the right way
for it. The Duke blush'd at this Check
given him, excusing the matter with
the Oddness of the thing, and wishing
it had happen'd to any body else but
her self. He then went into the Clo∣set,
and writ the following Letter to
<HI>Emilia.</HI></P>
<P>There are too many Confidents of my
Passion for you; what I now write, is brought
to you by the Hands of a Lady, who may be
suspected by you; but she has given me her
Word to serve us, and it is no more than
what she ought to do; after all the ill Offi∣ces
she has endeavoured to do us; you will
know by her all that happen'd, which renders
me almost inconsolable; if you encrease my
Pain, by giving fresh occasion of Trouble,
you are the most cruel Woman in the World.</P>
<P>He pray'd my Lady—to make
all the haste she could to go to S. <HI>James</HI>'s,
she said she would, and so they parted
very good Friends. However, as she was
<PB N="99" REF="89"/>
going thither, she would needs call at
the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> in hopes to meet
there with the E. of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> and
finding his Footman at the Door
with his Coach, she sent in word, she
had a mind to speak with him for one
Minute, and that she would stay for
him in the Mall. It being a considera∣ble
time since they had spoke to one
another, he could not imagine what it
was she came about; there being but
little likelihood she should already have
got Intelligence of what had happen'd
with her Letter, the King and the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> being the only Per∣sons
who could give her notice of it;
the King did not concern himself so far
in the matter, and the Duke hated her
too much to give himself that trouble.
He sent her word he would not fail to
meet her in the Mall, and turning to∣wards
the E. of <HI>A—n,</HI> is not this,
said he, a fine Invention to create a
Jealousy in you? She is not so fond of
me, reply'd he with a modest Air, to
take so much Pains for me, she knows
well enough what she is adoing: Tru∣ly,
reply'd the E. of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> I
don't value her, and if she intended
to bugbear you, she must have cast her
Eyes upon one whose Deserts might
give you some Umbrage, but such an
old Spark as I, is good for nothing. I
engage, said the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> that this
moment she thinks of neither of us,
<PB N="100" REF="90"/>
'tis her Letter that takes up her
Thoughts. Questionless, the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> being quite out of his Wits
about it, has told the whole Story to
some, who have given her an account
of it again; were it not for the share
<HI>Emilia</HI> has in this Adventure, I would
agree with you, reply'd the E. of
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> but he will certainly take
care of her Reputation. Oh! said the
E. of <HI>A—n,</HI> how little are you
acquainted with his Temper, you will
find, he will follow only his cholerick
Humour, and do all the Mischief him∣self,
that is to be done. You shall soon
know, said the E. of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> for I am
just going to my Lady—.</P>
<P>This Lady coming to the Dutchesses
first, and not seeing her, only enquired
aftr her Health, and then going to the
Apartment of the Ladies of Honour,
the first Person she met with there, was
the Deputy Governess, who made her
a low Courtesy, but my Lady would
not as much as vouchsafe her a Look,
going further into the Room, she found
<HI>Emilia</HI> talking with the Governess, and
she supposing my Lady to have a mind
to speak with <HI>Emilia,</HI> left her, and
advanced not without some disturbance
to meet and receive my Lady—
who without casting one Eye upon her,
took <HI>Emilia</HI> by the Hand, telling her
she wanted to speak with her in pri∣vate.
The Governess was of a haughty
<PB N="101" REF="91"/>
Temper, and thinking she had taken
too much from my Lady already, in
offering her the first Civilities, without
any returns on her side; and conside∣ring
that it was not to my Lady, but to
<HI>Emilia,</HI> she intended to give the Blows
with her Catoches in the late Noctur∣nal
Combat, she judged she ought
not take it so far amiss. Thus being
well pleased, that by her Post she might
challenge a pretence of revenging her
self upon the Spot, she took <HI>Emilia</HI> by
one hand, and then addressing her self
to my Lady—This is not a fit place,
said she, Madam, to talk in private;
you must not discourse with <HI>Emilia</HI> here,
unless in my Presence. Not to talk
to her, I will talk to her, reply'd my La∣dy,
very haughtily; and to make you
the third Person in our Conversation,
pray don't think of it. And I say, re∣ply'd
the Governess, pulling away
<HI>Emilia</HI> with all her force, you shall not
speak one word to her, unless I am
by, whilst my Lady—fearing she
should draw her away, pull'd with all
her Strength by the other Arm. You
understand your self so little, said she
to the Governess, that I am not much
surprised at your Impertinencies, and
were you worth my Anger I—
The Governess interrupting her, gave
her as haughty an Answer, whilst both
pull'd poor <HI>Emilia</HI> by the Arms, no
otherwise than if they intended to pull
<PB N="102" REF="92"/>
her to pieces. The Noise they made
having brought <HI>Philadelphia</HI> out of an
adjacent Closet, where she then was,
she did all she could to appease the
Quarrel, but being a Person of no suf∣ficient
Authority, she lost her Labour,
and they made as much noise as ever.
Just then the Countess of—who
was going to pay a Visit to the Dutch∣ess
of—happening to pass by the
Apartment of the Ladies of Honour,
thought no less than that they were go∣ing
to strangle one another, so in she
went, and to her no small surprise,
found my Lady—and the Gover∣ness,
still at the pulling Sport: Oh,
dear Madam, cry'd <HI>Emilia,</HI> pray make
Peace betwixt these Ladies, and deliver
me out of their Hands, for I know not
what to do. The Presence of the
Countess of—somewhat allay'd
their Fury, but it was a good while be∣fore
she was able to learn the subject of
the Quarrel, because they were all three
speaking at once; but the Countess
shewing a great deal of Patience, in
letting them spend their first Fury,
(whereof few are Masters upon such
like Occasions) she gave them a favou∣rable
Ear one after another. She bla∣med
my Lady—for not having
repay'd the common Civilities to the
Governess, (for she knew nothing of
their first Engagement in the Gallery,)
this being a secret Article they did not
<PB N="103" REF="93"/>
think fit to mention in the Treaty of
Peace. Afterwards she check'd the
the Governess, for her pretended Cir∣cumspection,
in attempting to prevent
a Person of my Lady—'s Quali∣ties,
from discoursing a Lady of Ho∣nour
of the Dutchess of—and
decided the matter thus far in fa∣vour
of my Lady, that she ought to
talk all alone with <HI>Emilia.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon they went immediately in∣to
the same Closet, from whence <HI>Phi∣ladelphia</HI>
was come just before; but this
being done in a fright, occasioned by
the noise she heard in the next Room,
she had left behind her, unseal'd, out
of haste, a Billet she had begun to
write to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and
<HI>Emilia</HI> being the first who cast her
Eyes upon it, she read these follow∣ing
Words:</P>
<P>Cure your self of your Passion for <HI>Emilia;</HI>
she is indeed lovely, but unfaithful, and you
were not made to be imposed upon. If you
will throw off her Fetters, and are inclined to
embrace others, a certain young Lady, no
less deserving than her self, makes you a
tender of hers, and Love will shew you the
secret of making them not very heavy. <HI>But—</HI></P>
<P>Can any thing be more irregular than
the Conduct of <HI>Philadelphia?</HI> cry'd <HI>Emi∣lia.</HI>
See, Madam, pray see, what a fine
Declaration of Love she has made.
My Lady—having perused the
<PB N="104" REF="94"/>
Billet with no little surprize, said, Up∣on
whom has she fix'd her Choice. I know
not answered <HI>Emilia,</HI> but it always seem'd
to me, as if the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> was not in∣different
to her: And to me, reply'd
my Lady—it always appear'd as
if she had a particular Kindness for the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth. Emilia</HI> folded up
the Letter, and without saying one
Word more, was agoing to put it into
her Pocket; I can't allow of that, said
my Lady—snatching it from her,
you must not keep in your Hands a
Letter, which enables you to hurt <HI>Phi∣ladelphia:</HI>
You are her Rival, and desire
of Revenge may prompt you to do
something, which you your self could
perhaps be sorry for at another time:
There is no reason, reply'd <HI>Emilia,</HI> you
should take this Letter from me, and
keep it your felf; for perhaps you have
as much reason to hate her as my self:
however, Madam, I owe you too much
respect to dispute any thing with you.</P>
<P>Good God, said my Lady—in∣terrupting
her, what makes us trifle a∣way
our time thus, when I am come
hither to talk with you about Mat∣ters
of much greater Moment to us,
and to make you my Confident; I have
a Letter for you, wherein you will be
satisfy'd you ought to consider me as
your Friend. She then put her Hand
into her Pocket, intending to pull it
out, but could not sind it; she searched
<PB N="105" REF="95"/>
every where but in vain. What will
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> think of me,
cry'd she, with a mournful Counte∣nance,
considering what has happen'd
already, he will think no less, than that
I have betray'd him; they both join'd
in their Lamentations. At last, pray
Madam, said <HI>Emilia,</HI> tell me at least,
what it is you were to relate to me.
No, reply'd my Lady—I can say
nothing without the Billet the Duke
gave me; I have not Strength to speak
under such continual Vexations; that
very Moment <HI>Philadelphia</HI> came into the
Closet with an Air, which sufficiently
shew'd, that by this time she had re∣membred
her Letter; but durst not
demand it, for fear of being ask'd some
Questions she did not care to answer,
by her, that had taken it; she look'd
upon them both one after another, as
if she intended to guess at their Thoughts
by their Eyes: But they being upon
their Guard, she could not discover any
thing. However, there being a neces∣sity
of not parting without settling the
matter: Come, said she, let a good
Understanding be re-establish'd betwixt
us; you have my Letter, and I have
found yours; I am willing to restore
yours, provided you will give me back
mine: The match is not equal, reply'd
<HI>Emilia,</HI> abruptly, you are not mentio∣ned
in the Billet that is in your Hands,
but in that which we have, are very
<PB N="106" REF="96"/>
disobliging Expressions against me. I
would fain know what reason you have
for so doing, and whether you have in
this acted the part of a Friend, and of a
Companion. Yes, reply'd <HI>Philadelphia,</HI>
every thing is permitted, when one
Ioves, and would make ones self to be
beloved again. Don't quarrel with me
upon that point, you have two Lovers:
One is too much, and if I had robb'd
you of him, I am not obliged to make
you Restitution.</P>
<P>My Lady—who was overjoy'd
at the Sight of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
Letter, and unwilling to see these young
Ladies enter into any further Dispute,
restored the Letter to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> Ma∣dam,
cry'd <HI>Emilia,</HI> must not I know
unto whom this Letter was written.
No, you shall never know it, reply'd
<HI>Philadelphia;</HI> but let this be your Com∣fort,
that if you are ignorant of the
Name of my Lover, you are fully sa∣tisfy'd,
at least, in that of your Rival,
and so she left the Room. <HI>Emilia</HI> fetch∣ing
a deep Sigh, which way soever I
look, said she, I see nothing but Rivals;
and even you, Madam, are one
of the most dangerous among them.
Oh, don't lay that at my Door, said
my Lady—giving her the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Letter. 'Tis you that I
am beholding to for a thousand Evils;
'tis you that have robb'd me of a Heart,
without which I am not able to live,
<PB N="107" REF="97"/>
Are you not very cruel, thus to disturb
my Repose? <HI>Emilia</HI> was too impatient
to peruse the Duke's Letter, to return
an Answer to the Complaints of this
Lady; But having read the Letter, she
begg'd her to give her an Account of
what had happen'd, which my Lady
—did, but not without much
Disturbance and Reluctancy; what she
had writ to the E. of <HI>A—n,</HI> did
so nearly affect <HI>Emilia,</HI> and the conse∣quence
thereof (the whole being come
to the King's and E. of S. <HI>Alban</HI>'s Ears)
proved so troublesome that with all
the Wit she had, (tho' she was
Mistress of a considerable share) she
could not give it a tolerable handsome
Turn. <HI>Emilia</HI> cry'd most bitterly, and
in spite of all the Caresses, and asking
of Pardon of my Lady, remain'd incon∣solable.
No, said <HI>Emilia,</HI> I can't com∣prehend,
what should move the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to make you the Messenger
to me of the Misfortunes whereof you
your self have been the Author, when
at the same time I knew not how to
obviate them. He was forc'd to press
me very hard before he could engage
me to undertake this Errand, reply'd
my Lady—and to confess to you
the real Truth, I would have been very
glad to have been excused; For, having
been the occasion of Discontent to you, I
was not very willing to own it to you.
I am apt to believe, said <HI>Emilia,</HI> this is
<PB N="108" REF="98"/>
the only thing that troubles you, for
as for the matter it self, you are not sor∣ry
for it. My Lady, touch'd to the
quick with these Words, and believing
that her present Condescension, toge∣ther
with the Disgrace she had received
from the Governess, deserv'd rather
some Acknowledgment from <HI>Emilia,</HI> she
was so enraged thereat, that she could
not forbear to break out into bitter Re∣proaches
and Threats. You are a little in∣grateful!
cry'd she, you are unworthy
of the Intelligence I have given you
concerning your ill Conduct; 'tis that
that will prove your Ruin, and 'tis in
vain I see, to pretend to prevent it:
As for me, who foresee your Destiny,
I will for the future hasten it; I will
make your Nocturnal Appointment with
the Duke, publick, and I will represent
it in such natural Colours, that every one
shall say, the Picture is done to the
Life. And so, Madam, said <HI>Emilia,</HI>
flush'd with Spite and Anger, I will set
you out, according to your Deserts:
If you go about to bring upon the
Stage my Frailties, I can tell some of
yours of an older Date, and you may
be sure I will tell the Story from the
beginning to the end. My Lady—
highly exasperated at these Threatning
Expressions, cast most furious Looks
upon <HI>Emilia,</HI> and fully recalling to
mind all the Sufferings she had under∣gone,
ever since the E. of <HI>A—n</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="99"/>
had been in love with this young Wo∣man,
she laid hold of an Ink-Glass full
of Ink, which <HI>Philadelphia</HI> had made use
of just before, when she writ to the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and threw it into <HI>Emi∣lia</HI>'s
Face, and then left the Room with
a quick Pace, to avoid the consequence
of such a violent Action, which would
in all probability have ended in a Com∣bat
with <HI>Emilia.</HI> This young Lady
left thus almost in Despair, cry'd more
for Rage than Vexation; she durst not
appear in the Apartment of the Ladies
of Honour, for fear of being ridiculed.
But soon changing her Thoughts, began
to consider of matters of greater Conse∣quence,
<HI>viz.</HI> how to appease the E. of
<HI>A—n,</HI> about her meeting the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI> And she was so much
taken up with these Considerations,
that she forgot to wipe off the Ink from
her Face.</P>
<P>So soon as the E. of S. <HI>Albans</HI> went a∣way
from the E. of <HI>A—n,</HI> he
arose out of his Bed, to study Revenge
against an unfaithful Mistress, and a
happy Rival. He took Coach, and as
yet unresolved what to do, went to
the Park. The first Person he met with,
being the E. of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> he made up
towards him, but being told he stay'd
for my Lady—he went off imme∣diately,
and meeting with some of his
Acquaintance, they found him in such
a Confusion, that they thought it best
<PB N="110" REF="100"/>
to leave him to his own Thoughts.
The better to avoid all manner of
Company, he retired to a By-place,
where he could see the Closet-Win∣dows
from whence he had often had an
Interview with <HI>Emilia.</HI></P>
<P>The Sight thereof recalling to his
Mind, both his Love and his Indigna∣tion,
and the last being then the predo∣minant
Passion, he resolved to break off
quite with a young Woman, who made
him a Sacrifice to the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
and what most of all vexed him
was, that this Sacrifice had been ex∣posed
to the King. With this Resolu∣tion
away he goes to the Dutchess
of—and entring strait the Apart∣ment
of the Ladies of Honour, he
found no body there but their Waiting-Women.
He ask'd where their Mi∣stresses
were, and being told <HI>Emilia</HI> was
in the Closet, he went in abruptly.
But how stood he amazed? What vari∣ety
of Thoughts distracted his Mind,
when he saw her Face black, like a
Black-Moors, and her Eyes overflow'd
with Tears? He look'd upon her like
one Thunder-struck, without uttering
one Word. She now remembring the
Ink on her Face, and consequently the
cause of his Silence, judged this to be
a happy Moment to redress her Cre∣dit.
She being a young Lady of great
Presence of Mind, and of a quick Ap∣prehension,
who are those tattling
<PB N="111" REF="101"/>
Fools, said she, that have told you my
Resolution of putting an end to my
Life? Why do you come here, to divert
me from so good a Design? No, no,
my Lord, I can't out-live the ill Im∣pressions
my Enemies have made upon
you concerning my late Conduct. I
have as you see, begun to disfigure
this unfortunate Beauty, which is the
cause of your Jealousy, and am resolved
to finish what remains as yet undone.
If in any other Country but <HI>England,</HI> a
Woman should be heard to talk at that
rate, it would be look'd upon only as an
effect of a freakish Passion; but you
must observe, that there they are more
positive in such like Resolutions, and
sometimes out-do even the Hero's of
the ancient Romances.</P>
<P>The E. of <HI>A—n,</HI> reflecting up∣on
what <HI>Emilia</HI> had told him, and touch∣ed
to the very Heart, look'd upon her
with Eyes that spoke more of Love
than of Hatred. <HI>Emilia, Emilia,</HI> said
he, sighing, 'tis not your Death that
can justify your Heart to me, but it is
your Conduct must do it: Had not the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> obtained from you a
Meeting, which ought to have been re∣served
for me alone, I should be less
unhappy, and your Virtue less expo∣sed.
I have nothing to upbraid my
self with, reply'd she, unless it be to
have loved in your self, an ungrate∣ful
and jealous Lover, who is apt to
<PB N="112" REF="102"/>
receive the worst of Impressions against
me, let me be never so innocent. 'Tis
true, I was in the Room with the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> but it is no less true al∣so,
that I expected to have met you
there. He did get your Letter into
his Hands, he counterfeited your Wri∣ting:
But what has he got by taking all
this Pains, nothing but to see himself
convinced of my Resolution and Con∣stancy
for you? He left me all in De∣spair,
and I did imagine, you would
have been the most satisfy'd Man in the
World, after I should have told you the
oddness of this Adventure. Alas! my
Lord, instead of the expected Acknow∣ledgement,
I lose you, and with you
my Honour and Reputation. She then
sigh'd and cry'd, with such Violence,
that she was not able to speak any long∣er;
but she had said enough, to con∣vince
the E. of <HI>A—n</HI> of her
Tenderness and Fidelity. He threw
himself at her Feet, he took hold of
her Hands, and bedew'd them with his
Tears: He ask'd her pardon, for having
been seduced by Appearances, and enqui∣red
how her Face became so black. She
told him she had broke the Ink-Bottle
in her own Face. He was ready to run
distracted, whereas any other but he
would soon have observed, there were
not the least Marks of Cuts or Wounds
in her Face. But Lovers Eyes are in∣fatuated.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="103"/>
The Earl left <HI>Emilia</HI> so full of Love,
that seeing the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> walk∣ing
with my Lady—in the Park,
he would needs go unto them, and ta∣king
the Earl on one side, Take your
Share, my Lord, said he, in my Satis∣faction,
<HI>Emilia</HI> is Constant, I am satis∣fy'd
she loves me for ever; The whole
matter has been clear'd betwixt us, to
the Confusion of our Enemies; She is
the most virtuous and most tender
young Lady in the Universe, I adore
her, I am distracted for her, and am re∣solved
never to believe any thing to
her Disadvantage. Having spoken these
Words, he went his way, without as
much as looking upon my Lady—and
without standing for the Earls Answer.
However, she had continued so near
them, as to understand every Word he
spoke, because he talk'd pretty loud,
and if he had not, she had too near a
Concern in the matter, not to listen to
their Discourse with the utmost Atten∣tion.
She was so much afflicted there∣at,
that the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> might ea∣sily
discover the Sentiments of her
Heart, by the paleness of her Counte∣nance.
You are to be pity'd, Madam,
said he to her, sighing, because you are
in Love with a Man, who loves you no
longer. Alas! said she, with a melan∣cholly
Voice, 'tis this that reduces me
to Despair. I shall be in every Bodies
Mouth; my Frailty, and the mean Fi∣gure
<PB N="114" REF="104"/>
I now make, will be the Subject of
every Bodies Discourse. Madam, re∣ply'd
he, had you been in the Humour
to accept of my Services, you would
never have been exposed to such cruel
Inquietudes. My Heart acts the Vo∣lunteer,
reply'd she, it consults nothing
but its own Inclinations, it was beyond
my power to regulate my Conduct, o∣therwise
than I have done; pray pity
me, but don't aggravate my Pain, by
useless Reproaches. She was not in a
Condition to say more, so returning to
her Lodgings, she order'd her Servants
to let no body come to speak with her,
except the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> unto
whom she was willing to give an Ac∣count
of what had pass'd, and the Earl
of S. <HI>Albans</HI> having restored the Letter
to her, this proved in some measure an
allay to her Pain.</P>
<P>The Dake of <HI>Monmouth</HI> coming soon
after to pay her a Visit, she related to
him the different Passages that had hap∣pen'd;
but when she came to the Ad∣venture
of the Ink-Bottle, wherewith
she had made a Mask for <HI>Emilia,</HI> he
seem'd to be much concern'd there∣at,
and told her, he could not but
dislike such violent Proceedings with a
young Lady of Quality, and one whom
she had much offended already in her
Letter to the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> and
for whom she knew he had a very ten∣der
Concern. But so soon as she told
<PB N="115" REF="105"/>
him what pass'd betwixt the Earl of
<HI>A—n,</HI> and the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI>
he turn'd his Anger another way; and
told her, he now hated her, as much as
he loved her before. He made my
Lady—repeat to him several
times, what she had related before,
and was overjoy'd to try if he could
pick out some seeming Contradictions,
which might raise in him some doubt of
the Truth of the Relation. He wished
it might be a piece of her own invent∣ing,
but saw her remain stedfast in
vouching the matter: At last, he resol∣ved
to go to the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> in
order to be satisfy'd in what he had been
told by the Earl of <HI>A—n.</HI></P>
<P>Just as he was coming out of my
Lady—'s Lodgings, he espy'd one
of the Earl's Footmen, and asking where
his Master was, he was told at Prince
<HI>R</HI>—The Duke hereupon order'd
his Coachman to drive thither with all
possible speed, and he, willing to obey
his Master, drove so hastily, that he
overturn'd the Coach, but the Duke got
no harm, except some slight Contusions.
Several Persons of Quality that hap∣pen'd
to pass by at the same time,
alighted out of their Coaches, to pay
their Compliments, which being retur∣ned
by him, he went straitways to the
Prince, and sent in to desire the Earl of
S. <HI>Albans</HI> to come down to him; but one
of the Prince's Gentlemen came down
<PB N="116" REF="106"/>
to tell him from his Master, he was
come down Stairs to speak with him.</P>
<P>The Duke did alight, but not with∣out
some Reluctancy, all his Thoughts
running upon what my Lady—
had told him, so that he was scarce fit
for any other Entertainment at that
Juncture. He was conducted into the
little Apartment of the Prince, whi∣ther
he commonly used to retire with
his best Friends; he was then a little
out of Order by a Bruise he had recei∣ved
lately; the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> kept
him Company, and there was a Seaman
of <HI>Provence</HI> discoursing with them. The
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> after having saluted
the Prince, ask'd him whether he had any
thing to command him: I wish, said he,
you would join your Interest with
mine, in recommending this Seaman to
Captain <HI>David,</HI> to entertain him aboard
his Yatch. The Seaman also addressed
himself to the Duke, but in such a
Jargon Dialect, that he could scarce
understand what he meant. However,
without enquiring any further into his
Qualifications, and what might induce
the Prince to desire his Recommenda∣tion,
knowing, that his Authority over
Captain <HI>David</HI> was such, as not to fear
a Denial, he began to write his Letter;
Whilst he was writing, the Seaman clapt
him upon the Shoulder, telling him, he
should not forget to mention in his Let∣ter,
that he was a Native of <HI>Provence;</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="107"/>
within two Minutes he gave him ano∣ther
Clap upon the Shoulder, telling
him, he understood his Business very
well. The Duke seem'd somewhat
surpriz'd at his Boldness: But soon af∣ter
he gave him another sound one,
worth all the rest, desiring him to put
something or other in his Letter. The
Duke began to be angry, and rising ha∣stily
from his Chair, and looking back∣wards,
were it not for the Respect I owe
to the Prince, said he to him, I would
teach thee how to be so familiar with
me. He had no sooner spoke these
Words, but the Seaman laugh'd in his
Face, as loud as he could, and the
Prince did the same. The Duke now
beginning to guess, there must be some
Mystery in the case, look'd attentively
upon the Seaman, and soon knew him
to be the Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> They
embraced like two dear Friends, and
notwithstanding the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
whole Mind was bent upon his amorous
Intreagues at that time, he was very wil∣ling
to know the reason of this strange
Metamorphosis, which he desired he
would relate to him.</P>
<P>I will tell it you in a few Words, re∣ply'd
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> My
Lord and I being agreed to join our In∣terest
and Power in the Delivery of the
Countess of—, and that which of
us should hear the first News of her,
should communicate it to the other;
<PB N="118" REF="108"/>
I set Watches about the House, to find
out, if possible, where she was, whilst
I kept at some distance, wrapt up in
my Cloak; But there I might have staid
till now, had it not been for my Lord
—His <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI>'s Wife nur∣sed
a Son of the Countesses; it was by
means of that Nurse she had written
formerly to my Lord—when she
was carry'd into <HI>Pembrookshire,</HI> and he
endeavoured to meet her. As she could
not go into <HI>Holland</HI> without some neces∣saries
(her Husband having resolved
to carry her thither) he sent <HI>Esther</HI> to
fetch what she desired, but attend∣ed
by two Men-Servants, who had
strict Orders given them, not to stir
from her till they had brought her back
to the place, where he lay conceal'd
with his Lady, being at a great distance
from his own. Accordingly, <HI>Esther</HI>
pack'd up her Mistress's Baggage, and
easily found means to speak to the
Nurse, under pretence that she should
assist her for better Dispatches sake.
Whilst they were busy in so doing,
without being overheard by any body,
she took this Opportunity to tell her;
Go tell my Lord—, it is no time
to be angry with the Countess, but that
he must leave no Stone unturn'd to pre∣vent
her being carry'd into <HI>Holland:</HI> My
Lord being resolved to embark with
her aboard the Yatch, the King intends
to send to the <HI>Hague</HI> to the Duke of
<PB N="119" REF="109"/>
<HI>Newburg. Esther</HI> came back soon after
to the Countess, and the Nurse acquit∣ted
her self of her Commission with
much Dexterity. My Lord found me
out immediately, and we bestow'd a
great part of the Night in Consultati∣ons,
what was best to be done. When
we reflected upon the Earl's Quality,
and the Lady's Reputation, which we
were more tender of, than she has been
of late her self, we could not determine
to proceed to any violent Resolutions.
But I came this Morning to the Prince,
and told him what a <HI>dilemma</HI> I lay un∣der;
He knowing me to have a peculiar
Talent at disguising my self, advised
I—'Tis true, said the Prince, in∣terrupting
him, you have such a pecu∣liar
Gift of contriving Masquerades,
that I can't forbear to relate to the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> what happen'd betwixt
you (during our civil Trouble) and
<HI>Ireton</HI>'s Wife, because it has in it some∣thing
that is extraordinary divert∣ing,
but by reason of my Illness, I
hope the Earl of S. <HI>Alb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns,</HI> who knows
the whole Adventure better than my
self, will ease me of that trouble;
The Earl began thus:</P>
<P>The whole Kingdom was in a most
terrible Combustion, and the King's
Servants were persecuted in all Places.
The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> having taken
up Arms, in Conjunction with the Earls
<PB N="120" REF="110"/>
of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Peterborough,</HI> they put
themselves at the head of Five hun∣dred
Horse, in hopes that by their Zeal
and Courage they might do something
for the King's Service. They were en∣gaged
by Major <HI>Gibbons,</HI> near <HI>Kingston,</HI>
where the Brother of the Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham</HI>
lost his Life in the Flower of his
Age, being a Person highly accomplish∣ed
both in Body and Mind; His Death
caused such a Consternation among his
Party, that they retreated, tho' in very
good Order, to <HI>Kingston.</HI> The next Day
they marched out again to S. <HI>Net,</HI> where
a second Engagement happening, the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> did Wonders, and
in the very prime of his Youth gave ear∣ly
Proofs of his Valour and Conduct,
not inferiour to the bravest and most
experienc'd Captain of his Age. For∣tune
had for a considerable time before,
declared it self against us, and it seem'd,
that to fight for a good Cause, was suf∣ficient
to have the worst of it. The
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> seeing himself re∣duced
to this Extremity, retreated to
<HI>Lincoln,</HI> with Sixty Horse only. The
Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> saved himself by
Flight in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and the
Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> with a great many
Officers and Persons of Note, were
taken Prisoners, besides what remained
slain in the Field. The Enemy now ha∣ving
thought fit to treat them with
Lenity, in order to engage them in
<PB N="121" REF="111"/>
their Interest, or at least, not to bare
Arms for the future, against what they
stiled the Government. The Earl of
<HI>Holland</HI> being first conducted to the
Castle of <HI>Warwick,</HI> was afterwards con∣fined
to his own House; and they ha∣ving
some peculiar Respect for the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> he had his Pardon offer'd
him, in regard especially of his youth,
provided he would surrender in
Fourteen Days, and acknowledge his
Fault. This Offer proving no wise agree∣able
to a Person, who had an Aversion
to, and despised those who thought they
did him a signal piece of Service; he
rejected it, persisting in his Resolution
of doing the King what Service he could.
But considering, that, if he continued
in Arms, he should be soon overpow∣er'd
by the Enemies, sand perhaps fall
alive into their hands, he resolved to
shelter himself in <HI>London,</HI> partly to shew
his Intrepedity and Constancy, partly
there to gain and encourage as many as
he could to the King's Party.</P>
<P>At the same time, being resolved not
to shut himself up in some private
place or other (as another perhaps would
have done) he caused himself to be
made a <HI>Jack-Pudding's</HI> Coat, a little
Hat, with a Fox's-Tail on it, and ador∣ned
with Cock's Fethers: Sometimes
he appear'd in a Vizard Mask, some∣times
he had his Face bedaub'd with
Flower, sometimes with Lamb-black,
<PB N="122" REF="112"/>
according as the Fancy took him. He
had a Stage erected at <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI>
where he was attended by Violins and
Puppet-Players. Every Day he brought
forth new Ballads (of his own making)
upon what pass'd in Town, wherein he
himself often had a Share. These he
sung before several thousands of Specta∣tors,
who came every Day to see and
hear him. He also sold <HI>Mithridate,</HI> and
his <HI>Galbanum</HI> Plaister, and thus pass'd
away his Time in the greatest Security,
in this great City, in the midst of his
Enemies, whilst we were oblig'd to fly,
and to conceal our selves in some Hole
or other.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI> his Sister,
was narrowly guarded ot <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
her Husband being then kept a Priso∣ner
at <HI>Windsor.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham</HI>
having got notice when she was to
be carry'd thither, set up his Stage that
Day, at a place where of necessity she
must pass by (having something to say
to her, which concerned their joint In∣terest)
which when she did, he cry'd
out to the Mob, he intended to give
them a Song, made upon her and the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> The Mob stopt
the Coach and the Dutchess, the Guards
being willing enough to comply, be∣cause
they were glad to see her affront∣ed.
Nay, so outragious were the Mob,
that they forced the Dutchess, who was
then the handsomest Woman in <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="113"/>
to sit in the Boot of the Coach, and to
hear him sing all his impertinent Songs.
Having left off singing, he told them,
'twas no more than reason he should
present the Dutchess some of the Songs,
whereof she was the main Subject, and
so he comes down from his Stage, load∣en
all over with Papers, and ridiculous
little Pictures: Being just come to
the Coach, he took off a black piece of
Taffata, which he always wore over one
of his Eyes, and then his Sister disco∣vered
immediately who he was, yet she
had so much Presence of Mind, as not
to give the least sign of Mistrust, nay,
she gave him some opprobious Language,
but was very eager of snatching at the
Papers he threw into her Coach, and
among them a Packet of Letters, which
she had no sooner got, but she went for∣ward,
the Duke at the head of the
Mob attending, and hollowing her a
good way out of the Town.</P>
<P>But in spite of all this Disguise, his
Shape appear'd so exquisitely fine, and
he danced on the Stage with so good a
Grace, that <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Daughter (she who
was married to <HI>Ireton,</HI> one of the most in∣veterate
Enemies to the King) having
espy'd him out of her Window upon
the Stage, took such a liking to him,
that she sent him word, she wanted to
speak with him. He was not insensi∣ble
what Hazard he run, and how dif∣ficult
it would be to avoid being disco∣vered;
<PB N="124" REF="114"/>
he remain'd uncertain for some
time, whether he ought thus to deliver
himself into the Hands of his Enemies,
and resolved not to go. But after all,
his Courage, which was always an Ene∣my
to Fear, over-ballancing all other
Reflections, he considered with him∣self,
that, in case he could enter in∣to
an amorous Intreague with this La∣dy,
he might by this means be let into
all the Secrets of her Husband, with∣out
whose Advice <HI>Cromwell</HI> scarce under∣took
any thing of Moment. Upon this
Consideration, blaming his Prudence,
which he call'd unseasonable, he went
the same Night to the Lady. He had
changed his <HI>Jack-Pudding</HI>'s Dress, for
another very rich one, over which he
wore a Cloak; and he had once a mind
to have also taken of the Plaister; But
met with a more kind Reception, than
if he had had both his Eyes entire.
She gave him such undeniable proofs of
her Tenderness, that he was fully satis∣fy'd
he might without Danger tell her
his Name: But found such an Aversion
in himself to her Person, by reason of
her Father, that she was alomst insup∣portable
to him, and consequently re∣ceived
her Caresses with so much Cold∣ness,
nay, even with Slight, as reduced her
almost to Despair. At last, being urg∣ed
for a considerable time to tell her
the Reason, he told her boldly, he was
a <HI>Jew,</HI> and by their Law forbidden not
<PB N="125" REF="115"/>
to love a Christian Woman. She stood
amazed, that a Man, who by his Pro∣fession
was to cheat all the World upon
the Stage, should be so strait lac'd in
his Conscience. As she of her self was
not learned enough to confute his Asser∣tion
by Strength of Argument, she
sent for a famous <HI>Jewish</HI> Rabbi, and pro∣mised
him a good Reward. The Duke
coming that Night to pay her a Visit,
was not a little surprized, when he saw
this old grave Fellow come into the
Room, and to offer him, that he would
easily remove this Scruple. The Duke
being not so well versed in the <HI>Talmuth,</HI> as
to enter into a Dispute with the Rabbi,
had no other way left to get clear of
the matter, than to beg two Days
respite to consider of it. But now,
fearing in good earnest to be discovered,
he left <HI>London,</HI> and took his way to the
<HI>Downs.</HI> Just before his departure, ha∣ving
an Inclination to let <HI>Ireton</HI>'s Wife
know unto what Tribe the <HI>Jew</HI> (she had
loved so tenderly) belong'd, he sent her
a Billet, written with that Vivacity of
Wit, which you know is natural to
him; I give you leave to guess at her
Surprize, and whether she did not re∣proach
her self a thousand times, for
having betray'd the Secrets of her Fa∣mily.</P>
<P>The Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> was ready to
die with laughing at this Passage, unto
which the Prince added several par∣ticulars,
<PB N="126" REF="116"/>
which the Earl had left out.
The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> reeurn'd them
Thanks for this most diverting Relati∣on
of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Ad∣venture.
I must confess, said the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the Earl has represented
every thing to the best Advantage, and
given a most happy turn to an Adven∣ture,
which in it self is no more than
a Trifle, he has been pleased to exagge∣rate
every thing to my Praise, and tho'
his favourable Sentiments for me
are highly acceptable to me. I
must after all frankly own, I never
heard any thing with more impatience
in my Life; and when I reflect, that
this account has prevented my going a∣way,
I am ready to despair. I am ful∣ly
resolved, said he to the Dke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
to go in this Equipage you see
me in, aboard the Yatch that is ready
to sail for <HI>Holland;</HI> I will go aboard her
in the Quality of a common Seaman,
I will make my self known to the
Countess, and will concert Measures
with her, how to get her out of her
Husband's Hands. He will not in the
least mistrust me, and I may perhaps
meet with a happy Opportunity, be∣fore
our arrival at the <HI>Briel;</HI> and were
it only for the pleasure of seeing her
during the Voyage, this will sute much
better with my Inclination, than to
stay behind without her.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="117"/>
I never saw a more amorous Man in
the World than you are, said the Earl
of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> and I must accuse you of
Ingratitude, because you have conceal∣ed
from the Company, that it was I that
furnished you with these fine Seamens
Cloaths, under the Disguise whereof
you are to perform such gallant amo∣rous
Exploits. 'Tis true, said the Duke,
were I not so eager to go, I would with
a great deal of Pleasure make up Ac∣counts
with you, and acknowledge my
Debts; But as the case stands now, I
must either go immediately, or die upon
the Spot this Minute. At this the
Prince fell a laughing. Were you of
about Eighteen Years of Age, said he,
you ought to be excused, but at such
an Age as ours, we should be Masters of
a little more Moderation. You are free
to say what you please, my Lord, an∣swered
the Duke, as to what concerns
my self, I hold this for a sure Maxim,
That it is easier to defend ones self a∣gainst
the Assaults of Love, than to pre∣scribe
certain Bounds, after one loves.
Love being a Child, is an Enemy to
these Rules of Wisdom, you would
maliciously insinuate into me.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> having in
the mean while withdrawn himself with
the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> into a spacious
Dining-Room, called the <HI>Room of Plea∣sure,</HI>
by reason of the fine Paintings
that were to be seen there, and that
<PB N="128" REF="118"/>
the Prince used to entertain and feast
his Mistresses in it. 'Tis certain, that
all the remainder of this Day, the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was afflicted with the most
heavy Inquietudes, after having receiv∣ed
positive and most sincere Assurances
from the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> concerning
what the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> had entrust∣ed
him with, in reference to <HI>Emilia.</HI>
Now it was that the Duke thought him∣self
all along in an Error, to believe
she loved none but him. Oh! said he,
the last is always the most happy with
her, and how easie is a Man, who sets
up for Constancy, made a Bubble off.
He exclaim'd against the whole Sex in
general, and bestow'd a Thousand Curs∣es
upon his Mistress in particular. Whilst
he was bemoaning his Misfortunes, the
Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> was very attentive in
hearing a Canary-Bird sing; The Duke
looking upon him for some time, with∣out
speaking one Word, Yes, said he,
I could find in my Heart to kill you,
you Canary-Bird, and all the World be∣side;
for is it possible that so polite a
Man as you are (supposing you were
none of my Friend, as I don't suppose
you are) is it possible, say I, you should
not have so much Complaisance, as to
bare a Share in my Affliction and Re∣sentment.
I have kept no Tears in re∣serve,
reply'd the Earl smiling, having
shed them all before on account of my
own Misfortunes; and I have bought
<PB N="129" REF="119"/>
Love at so dear a rate, that all your
Pains taken together, can't stand in
Competition with the least I have suf∣fered.
Oh! cry'd the Duke, you are
ungrateful to complain; your Suffe∣rings
were recompenced by such secret
Enjoyments, as can't be purchased at
too high a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> price. I have seen the
Draught of the old Court, and know
every thing that pass'd, in respect to
you, and have been concern'd in your
behalf; but how well you deserve it,
I judge by the most gracious Returns
you are pleased to make me. The Earl
burst out a laughing so loud, that being
heard by the Prince, and the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> they begg'd them to return
to their Conversation. But the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> desired the Earl to ask his
Excuse with the Prince, and so he was
going down Stairs without saying any
thing, except, that, in the Humour he
was then in, he was good for nothing,
except it were to kill <HI>Emilia.</HI> Now, I
expect, return'd the Earl, you will turn
the Destroyer of Human Race. 'Tis
not above a moment ago when you were
for killing even the poor Canary-Bird,
it will prove a hard matter for one to
escape your Fury. Adieu, said the
Duke, you talk at Pleasure, have a care
it may not be my turn another day.</P>
<P>He went away in great hast, but was
scarce come to the bottom of the Stairs,
when seeing the King come in, he
<PB N="130" REF="120"/>
was obliged to conduct him up Stairs,
and the Duke understanding that the
King was coming, would fain have
been gone. The Prince told him, that
if he would go into his Closet, he might
from thence go down a pair of back
Stairs, to another Apartment; but
when he came into the Closet, he could
find no other Door there, than that,
thro' which he came in; the Prince ha∣ving
contriv'd this Stratagem on pur∣pose
to make him to stay there till he
could shew him to the King in his Sea∣man's
Disguise.</P>
<P>The King came in laughing, follow'd
only by the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> I am
come, said he to the Prince, to tell you
a very pleasant Story: You know, that
since the discovery of the late Conspi∣racy,
I sent Orders to the Sea-Ports,
not to suffer any one to go be∣yond
Seas, without a Pass, Sign'd by
my own Hand. One of my Yachts be∣ing
ready to set sail for <HI>Holland,</HI> whi∣ther
I sent it to the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI>
the Earl of—with his Lady, (who
appear'd extreamly melancholly) would
fain have embark'd aboard her; he de∣sired
the Captain to transport them to
<HI>Holland,</HI> but he shewing some unwilling∣ness,
offers him a great Summ of Money.
The Captain now beginning to suspect
them, and thinking there was something
more than ordinary in the matter, not on∣ly
refuses them Passage, but also causes
<PB N="131" REF="121"/>
him and his Wife to be seized, and is
come to give me an Account of the
matter. I give you leave to guess in what
a Condition the poor jealous Husband is
by this time. The Prince then asking
the King what Resolution he had taken
in that Affair? I have resolved, said he,
to let them go where they will: His
Countess is very handsome in my Eyes,
but she shews not the least Acknow∣ledgment
of my Favours, nay, she
has not thought it worth her while, to
crave my Assistance, and so I will not
intermeddle in the Business. The Duke
of <HI>Buckingham</HI> overheard what the King
said, and being now no more Master of
his Passion, out of the Closet he comes,
and throws himself at the King's Feet.
The King looking upon him, but with∣out
knowing him, said, Friend, <HI>what
wouldst thou have?</HI> The Duke, who
had forgot his Disguise, and who used
to be treated by the King in the same fa∣miliar
way, reply'd, What I would
have, Sir? Alas! can't you easily think
of it, knowing, as you actually do, my
Passion for the Countess of—I would
you should restore her to me. To thee,
cry'd the King, laughing, to thee,
Friend. Yes Sir, to my self, reply'd
the Duke, I will give you back all my
Employments and other Favours, pro∣vided
you will grant me this Request.
Certainly the Man is out of his Senses,
continued the King, he will give me
<PB N="132" REF="122"/>
back all his Offices and other Favours,
and where are they? The Prince, the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and the Earl of
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> laugh'd heartily, and the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> could not forbare
to do the same, so soon as he began to
think of his Disguise, and that the King
did not know him. Then the Prince
unfolded the Riddle to the King, who
was extreamly pleased with it. Here is
a Story, said he, which would scarce be
pardonable in a very young Man; but
to meet with it in your Person, cer∣tainly
it is impossible. However, I in∣tend
to send to the Earl of—that I
want to speak with him, and I will actu∣ally
speak to him concerning his Wife,
that she may meet with better Treat∣ment
from him for the future, because
there is not one instance of such a severe
Usage in the whole Court, besides this.
But, Sir, said the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
are you likely to continue my Rival;
for, I rather wish the Countess in <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
than to have to do with you in
that kind. Hitherto, said the King, I
never saw you much disturbed upon
that Account, and I am not unacquain∣ted
in some measure, with what Game
you have play'd me; but let us now
think of bringing back the Lady, and
afterwards settle our Pretensions. He
ordered the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> to write
immediately to the Earl of—in his
Name, and the said Earl appearing ac∣cordingly
<PB N="133" REF="123"/>
the same Night at <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
the King spoke to him in so obliging a
manner, and gave him such wholesome
Advice, tending to his own Repose,
and the maintaining of his Wife's Re∣putation,
that any body else but him∣self
would have embraced it.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was too much
disturbed with Jealousy and Vexation to
stay long at the Princes; but went
thence to my Lady—She soon percei∣ved
by his Countenance, that he had
been with the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> and
that by him he had been fully convin∣ced
of what he would have been over∣joy'd
to remain in doubt of. Well, my
Lord, said she to him, I suppose you
will believe me another time; and will
not suppose I frame Stories on purpose
to impose upon <HI>Emilia,</HI> to withdraw you
from your Engagements to her. And I
think you must be not very well in
your right Senses to dispence so patient∣ly
with all her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oqueteries. Oh!
good God, Madam, said he to her,
don't insult over my Misfortunes,
you see I have more already than I am
able to bear, and you are endeavouring
to load me with new ones. You mi∣stake
me, reply'd she, you have no
such great occasion to complain, as you
imagine; a certain very amiable Per∣son,
loves you to such a degree; as may
well make an amends for the Loss of
<HI>Emilia.</HI> The Duke was not exempted
<PB N="134" REF="124"/>
from that Fault, incident to most Peo∣ple
of his Age: He would not let slip
the least Opportunity of Gallantry; he
always entertain'd the predominant
Passion in his Heart, but look'd upon
the rest as Amusements, not to be
neglected. He fancy'd that my Lady
—was speaking in her own behalf;
and that having taken a Pique against
the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> she intended to
make her Addresses to him, and judged it
but reasonable she should thus make
her self an amends for the disquiet oc∣casioned
by her Lover. This Reflection
revived all his Vivacity of Mind; I am
beloved, Madam, said he to her, and
she that loves me is amiable. This is
very happy for me; but methinks she
was not much in the right to pitch upon
so dangerous a Confident as you are.
'Twas by chance, and not her Inclina∣tion,
that made me Mistress of this
Secret, said my Lady—, and, because
I won't let your Imagination rove too
far to guess at it, I will tell you, it is
<HI>Philadelphia, Emilia</HI>'s Companion, with
whom you always quarrel about her
Languishments. The Duke stood sur∣prized
at this Name, and this News
proved very agreeable to him. <HI>Phila∣delphia</HI>
was handsome and young, her
Deportment was more sedate, and not
so unsettled as that of <HI>Emilia,</HI> and ex∣treamly
pleasing to the Duke; besides
that, having always shown an Indiffe∣rency
<PB N="135" REF="125"/>
for all the World, the Duke was
vain enough to flatter himself, that she
preferr'd him before all the rest. He
took particular care to know all what
my Lady—knew of the matter, who
communicated to him the whole Ad∣venture
of the Billet she left in the
Closet. 'Tis possible, that without the
Spite he then had conceived against <HI>Emi∣lia,</HI>
he would not have been sensible, in
so eminent a degree, of the pleasure of
being beloved by <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> But now
he was so far from checking this new
Passion, that he favoured and admitted
it into his Heart, the sooner to cure
that which he had had for an ungrateful
Person.</P>
<P>He thank'd my Lady—for the good
News she had brought him; and in the
Evening went to the Dutchess of—,
who was pretty well recovered by this
time. Passing thro' the Guard-Cham∣ber,
he met <HI>Emilia,</HI> stopping a little, as
if she had a mind to speak to him▪
But the Duke pulling of his Hat with a
careless Air, pass'd by her without as
much as casting one Eye at her; After∣wards,
espying <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in the Anti∣chamber,
he accoasted her in most o∣bliging
and graceful manner, which had
in it something more than ordinary.
<HI>Emilia</HI> was much surprized at the Duke's
Deportment towards her; She could
not but look upon this hard Usage, as
a very slender recompence for what
<PB N="136" REF="126"/>
loss she had sustained by my Lady—
in her Reputation, and the Affront
put upon her, when she threw the <HI>Inck</HI>-Bottle
in her Face. She was certain
she had nothing to reproach her self
with for what she had told the Earl of
<HI>A—n,</HI> since it was done by the con∣sent
of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with an
Intention to keep him on in Ignorance.</P>
<P>All these Reflections made him ap∣pear
over burthen'd, with so much
guilt in her Eyes, that she reproach'd
her self a thousand times for her Frail∣ties,
she did not care to return into
the Room, where she could expect to
meet with nothing else but with fresh
Vexation from the Duke, and fearing
least her Dissatisfaction might discover
it self in her Face, she chose rather to
go to her Chamber, to afford a free
Course to her Tears. In the mean
while, <HI>Philadelphia</HI> was not a little asha∣med
of having discovered her Senti∣ments
for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in
the Letter found by my Lady—and
<HI>Emilia</HI> in the Closet; sometimes she
flatter'd her self, that my Lady—
guessiing it might be for him, had not
mention'd it; tho' in a moment after,
she wish'd they had discovered it to
him. She appear'd very pensive and
disturbed, she durst not look upon him,
and her Fear had raised her Colour in
her Face, whilst she kept her Eyes
fixt on the Ground. As she scarce re∣turn'd
<PB N="137" REF="127"/>
an Answer to such indifferent
Questions, as had nothing in them that
could either puzzle or surprize her, he
began to guess at the present Condition
of her Heart, and rightly judging that
he ought not to let slip so favourable a
minute without improving it, he told
her how far she had the Pre-eminency
in her Heart, before <HI>Emilia,</HI> when se∣veral
Ladies coming in, she entred into
a Discourse with them to recover her
self from that Surprize, which the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Declaration had occasi∣oned
in her.</P>
<P>She returned to the Dutchess of—'<HI>s</HI>
Apartment, the Duke follow'd her, and
looking upon her with a most tender
Air, she had so little Power of forbear∣ing
to return his Looks, that she her
self was afraid she had discovered to
the World a Secret, she intended to
conceal to the utmost; so that rather
than to expose her self to this Mishap,
she thought it best to retire. The Duke,
who narrowly observed her, rightly
guessing at the matter, resolved to fol∣low
her, and to tell her all the tender
and obliging things in the World. Af∣ter
having staid a little while longer in
the Dutchess of—'s Apartment, he
went to that of the Ladies of Honour,
and tho' few Men were suffered to
come there, yet the Duke was not ty'd
to all the ordinary Customs. He was
surpriz'd when he came in, not to see
<PB N="138" REF="128"/>
<HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but to meet with <HI>Emilia,</HI>
her Eyes red, and her Cheeks overflown
with Tears; she no sooner saw him, but
arose from her Seat, and without
speaking one word, went into her Clo∣set,
the Door whereof she was going to
shut after her. But he accoasting her
at that minute, Do you imagine, said
he, <HI>Emilia,</HI> I have not been sufficiently
inform'd of what occasions of Com∣plaint
you have given me? Will you
augment them by the addition of
others, and by shewing me your Dis∣dain,
which, to speak the truth, be∣comes
you but very ill. Your Re∣proaches,
said she, might perhaps sur∣prize
me at another time, but don't at
this Juncture, because I know you to
be the most ungrateful of all Men; and
I should be too happy, had I given you
any real cause of Vexation; but my
Dealings with you have been too full
of Sincerity. I did sacrifice the Earl of
<HI>A—n</HI> for you, I have born with Pa∣tience
your Indiscretion, in giving my
Lady—a share in my Secret; She has
insulted over me, as if my Birth was
inferiour to hers, and nothing but the
Advantage she had got over me, by
your Imprudence, could have made her
take that Liberty. Sensible to the high∣est
Degree of this Affront, as indeed I
ought to be, I flatter'd my self you
would endeavour to afford me some
Consolation; I intended to tell you my
<PB N="139" REF="129"/>
Grief, and to make you sensible of my
Afflictions, when you happening to
meet me, you look'd upon me with a
haughty and proud Air, scarce to be
express'd, and now you come to tri∣umph
over my Weakness and Pains I
suffer for you. Her Reproaches and
Tears, were undeniable Signs to the
Duke, that she was touched to the
Heart; for he still loved her, and <HI>Phi∣ladelphia</HI>
had not as yet got so far Pos∣session
of his Heart, as to have been
able to chase thence her Rival, in so
little a time. May it please Heaven,
said he, with a most tender and agree∣able
Look, may it please Heaven you
give no matter of Satisfaction to any
body else but my self: But the Earl of
<HI>A—n</HI> thinks himself too happy for me
to pretend to the same good Fortune.
You love us by Turns, I was happy last
Night, and so was he this Morning, and
—don't go on in so disobliging a
Discourse, cry'd she, ungrateful as you
are, you will raise my Passion to the
highest Pitch. Have you forgot alrea∣dy,
that what I have said to the Earl,
was done according to your Advice,
after I frankly offered quite to break off
with him; that you were afraid, this
Rupture might make a Noise which
might reach the Ears of the Dutchess
of—, who being ignorant of our
Correspondence, you conjur'd me to
take this Method for your Quiet, and
<PB N="140" REF="130"/>
that upon that score you would be more
obliged to me, than upon any other
Account whatever. But let us talk no
more of it, continued she, falling down
into her Chair, let us say no more of
it. I would have you believe I betray
and hate you, I would have you imagine
every thing that may raise your Anger
against me, I prefer your Aversion be∣fore
your Tenderness, and before the
Misfortune of pleasing you.</P>
<P>The Vioience wherewith she uttered
these Complaints and Reproaches, her
Eyes burning with Anger, the Colour
of her Face, her Youth and Beauty, all
these I say, pleaded in her behalf, so
that the Duke, now quite pierc'd thro'
with Love, threw himself at her Feet:
What did he not say to appease her?
She seem'd not to hearken to his Prote∣stations,
which serving only to highten
his Passion, he declared he would either
be Friends with <HI>Emilia,</HI> or die before
he left her. At the same moment <HI>Phi∣ladelphia</HI>
returning from the Apartment
of the Princess—, entred the Room.
She had all this while pleased her self
with the secret Thoughts of the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Affection. She thought
her self already triumphant over a
Heart, the Possession whereof was her
only aim, she upbraided her self for
having left so soon the Dutchess of
—'s Apartment, whilst the Duke
staid behind. But alas! alas! guess at
<PB N="141" REF="131"/>
her Surprize, when she saw the Duke
at the Feet of her Rival. Never was
such a Contest seen betwixt <HI>Love, Jea∣lousie,</HI>
and <HI>Pride;</HI> she was in an Instant
reduced from the highest pitch of Satisfa∣ction,
to the highest degree of Pain;
she look'd pale, she stood mute, and
by her Silence and want of Motion,
you would have taken her for nothing
else but a Statue, had not her Eyes,
which preserv'd still their natural Fun∣ction,
sufficiently discovered sometimes
by their lively, sometimes by their
languishing Motions, the different
Passions and Agitations of her Soul:
But all on a sudden, her Heart begin∣ning
to fail, she was ready to drop down,
when the Duke, who drew nearer to
her, catch'd her in his Arms.</P>
<P>O with what Pleasure undertook he
this task! He saw this lovely, young
and handsome Lady, dying for Jealou∣sy,
whereof he was the Cause; and now
was so convinced in himself, that there
was not the least room left to doubt,
but that he was beloved to the highest
degree. His Gratitude and former In∣clinations
being now join'd in these two
Persons, both pleaded hard to give the
preference to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> before <HI>Emilia,</HI>
or at least he wish'd he could share his
Heart betwixt them, without affording
matter of Offence to either; but a Mi∣stress,
who knows the Niceties of Love,
will never be contented with such a
<PB N="142" REF="132"/>
sort of Partition. Whilst he was busi∣ed
in giving all possible Assistance to
this fair Lady, <HI>Emilia</HI> observed all their
Actions, without vouchsafing to come
near her Companion; for, looking upon
her as a most dangerous Rival, she had
conceived a most strong Aversion against
her. Neither durst the Duke urge her
to lend a helping Hand, for fear of dis∣obliging,
and affording fresh matter
of Complaint to her, at a Juncture,
when this last Contest was still fresh in
Memory: However, at last, his Com∣passion
prevailing above his Policy, Is
it possible, said he, you should see <HI>Phi∣ladelphia</HI>
in this Condition, and not think
of some Remedy or other to recover
her out of this Swoon? What would
you have me to do, reply'd she, my
Lord? You are a better Physician than
I. At least, said he, you might throw
a little cold Water in her Face. There
is none here, answered <HI>Emilia</HI> with a
grave and cold Air: You might go to
fetch some, added the Duke, this being
no more than an incumbent Duty, to
be performed one to another. I owe
her no Duty, said she, and you will
find it difficult to perswade me to leave
you together. The Duke, somewhat
vexed at this Expression, Well, said he,
since you refuse to give aid to <HI>Philadel∣phia,</HI>
I shall apply a Remedy, such as
Physicians like my self commonly make
use of; and so gave her a hearty Kiss!
<PB N="143" REF="133"/>
How! before my Face, cry'd <HI>Emilia,</HI>
endeavouring to pull <HI>Philadelphia</HI> out of
the Duke's Arms. Yes, cruel Woman,
said he, before your Face: What a
blessed time have I on't, to be engaged
with a Person that has so little Com∣plaisance
for me. They would have
gone farther in reproaching one another,
but that <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> being now come to
herself again, and opening her Eyes, saw
the Duke rubbing her Hands with some
of the Queen of <HI>Hungary</HI>'s Water. O, my
Lord, said she, pushing him from her,
let me alone I beseech you, all what
comes from you, is like Poison to me,
and so she turn'd another way, to avoid
looking upon him.</P>
<P>The Duke being fensible the cause
of her Anger proceeded from no∣thing
else, but his lying at the Feet of
<HI>Emilia,</HI> was surprized to find, she should
imagine to have already got so firm a
footing in his Heart, as to treat him in
that manner as she did. He saw himself
betwixt these two young Ladies, belo∣ved
by both, and upon the point of lo∣sing
them out of Jealousy. He durst
not discover too much of his Inclinati∣ons
for <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> and yet being un∣willing
to appear indifferent, he was
strangely divided in his Resolution; So
that the hight of his good Fortune at
this Juncture, proved the worst of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Misfortune. Whilst he was considering
of the most proper Methods to appease
<PB N="144" REF="134"/>
both his Mistresses, they cast most fu∣rious
Looks at one another, and their
sullen Silence discovered something
more violent in their Hearts, than all
the injurious Words they could have
made use of. The Duke looking upon
this Conjuncture, as the most terrible
he ever yet saw in his Life, was under
a perplexity what to say to one, with∣out
exasperating the other, he would
fain have kept an even Hand betwixt
them, being unwilling to part with ei∣ther,
but they had too much Sense,
and were too nearly concerned in the
matter, not to guess at his Thoughts;
Their Vanity and Self-Interest would
not suffer them to brook such a Parti∣tion.
<HI>Emilia,</HI> who had been beloved
first, did not suffer, but with the ut∣most
Impatience, the Concern the Duke
had shewn for her Rival, she was just
upon the point of breaking out into the
most bitter Reproaches commonly made
use of by Lovers upon such like Occa∣sions,
when they understood the Go∣verness
was a coming towards their A∣partment.
Her Severity proved the
most powerful Motive of Union betwixt
these two Rivals, who now began to
concert Measures how to divert the im∣pending
Storm. We are insallibly un∣done,
cry'd they, my Lord, unless
you take care of our Reputation. What
would you have me do, said he; You
must, reply'd <HI>Emilia,</HI> hide your self in
<PB N="145" REF="135"/>
the Closet, and we will take care to let
you out privately, he consented, went
in; They lock'd the Door and took out
the Key.</P>
<P>The Governess came in immediately
after, and finding her self somewhat
out of order, would needs be undress'd,
and sup in her own Room; and there
being no Passage out of the Apartment
of the Ladies of Honour, but thro' hers,
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> and <HI>Emilia</HI> were equally
concern'd at this Disappointment, and to
add to their Dissatisfaction, she would
needs walk after Supper in their Apart∣ment;
They were ready to die of Fear,
less the Duke should make the least
Noise. In short, every Minute appear∣ed
to them no less than an Age, and
the Duke you may suppose, was not
very fond of his Quarters, being to
sup with my Lord <HI>Grey</HI> that Evening,
Madam—was the only Daughter
to the Earl of—Gentleman of the
Bed-Chamber to the King, her Mother
being a Lady of extraordinary Qualifi∣cations,
and Lady of the Bed-Chamber
to the Queen. This young Lady, where∣in
Youth and Beauty flourish'd in a
most eminent degree, was beloved by
all that saw her, and being of a very
gay Disposition, she seldom used to
frighten away her Lovers with her
Looks. She had marry'd a certain
Gentleman, much inferiour to her in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and but of an indifferent Estate,
<PB N="146" REF="136"/>
which being done against her Father's
Consent, he would not see her, nor suf∣fer
her to come into his House, but at
the same time gave her a handsome
Yearly Allowance, suitable to her Edu∣cation.
This lovely Lady, coming fre∣quently
to Court, the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI>
fell in Love with her, and she
gave a favourable Ear to his Addresses.
The King's Favour, and his high Sta∣tion,
being things suitable to her Vani∣ty,
she was very ambitious to enter in∣to
an Engagement with him, which she
did so effectually on her side, that she
loved him more, than was consistent
with her Repose. This Intreague has
been broken off and revived several
times. Perhaps I may give you some
Particulars thereof hereafter.</P>
<P>But not to interrupt our former Re∣lation,
it will be sufficient to tell you,
that she and the Governess of the La∣dies
of Honour of the Dutchess of—
were most intimate Friends, and that
they loved to sit up so late in the Night,
that they often slept all the Day-time
till Evening, in the Governess's Apart∣ment;
She told her she should not won∣der
at her being not very well, because
they had not sat up together for these
several Days last past; and that she
was resolved not to stir out of her
Room till six of the Clock the next
Morning. The Governess readily ac∣cepted
the Challenge, and told her she
<PB N="147" REF="137"/>
had too much Charity, not to be
aiding in the Recovery of her Health,
tho' with the loss of her own Repose;
That indeed she found she wanted
something, but had not Sagacity enough
to guess, she wanted to pass a whole
Night with her in Conversation, and
that she had a thousand things to tell
her. They began immediately to en∣tertain
one another with variety of
Matters, whilst <HI>Emilia</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia</HI>
were almost reduced to Despair, at this
new Obstacle. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
overheard all they said, he hoped to
get out of the Closet, so soon as the Go∣verness
was gone to Bed: Being without
a Light, he could neither read nor write,
and the Moon being not up as yet, the
Darkness of the Night proved an addi∣tional
encrease to his Vexation. They
supp'd, and afterwards Madam—went
along with the Governess into her Cham∣ber,
leaving <HI>Emilia</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia</HI> by
themselves, every one fitting in their
Chair, with their Eyes fix'd on the
Ground, and without uttering one
Word; <HI>Emilia</HI> standing upon her Pun∣ctilio's,
would not be the first that would
go into the Closet to the Duke, tho'
they were both equally concerned, and
never did two Rivals meet with such a
Disappointment together. The Duke
finding every thing very quiet, thought
no otherwise than that they intended to
game him, and let him stay all Night in
<PB N="148" REF="138"/>
the Closet, he open'd the Door, and
found them all in Silence, as if they
did not think it worth their while to
speak to him. They had commanded
their Waiting-Woman not to come in,
unless they were call'd, and they were
in so deep a Study, that had it not been
for the Noise the Duke made, they
would questionless have continued in
the same Posture all Night. Is it thus,
said he, with a low Voice, you play
your Game with me? And do you
think I will stay longer in the Closet?
If I must stay there for your sake, pray
come in and keep me Company; or if
you won't do so, find out a way to let
me go, for this solitary Place does not
agree with my Constitution. He spoke
these Words with so haughty an Air,
that they soon perceived he was very ill
satisfy'd with his Quarters, each of
them would willingly have spoken to
him in private, but there needed no
more to have set the whole House in∣to
Combustion; since she that had been
left alone, would infallibly have given
notice thereof to the Governess, let
the Consequence be what it would, so
neither of them answered one word;
This made him tell them with some
Passion, since they could think of no
Expedient, he would find out one him∣self,
and so moved towards the Door, as
if he was going out, tho' in reality he
design'd no such thing, for it was enough
<PB N="149" REF="139"/>
for him to know, that Madam—
was in the Governess's Room, to stand
upon his Guard, for fear of being seen
by her.</P>
<P>The two young Ladies, frightned at
his pretended Resolution, Oh! my Lord,
cry'd they, you intend to ruin us out of
Sport; and so <HI>Emilia</HI> push'd him back
into the Closet, but too late; for the
Door betwixt the Appartment of the
young Ladies and that of the Gover∣ness,
being half open, and the Moon
being risen by this time, Madam—
who happen'd to look that way, espy'd
the Shadow of the Duke. She was not
so deeply engaged in Discourse with the
Governess, but that she found her self
almost distracted with so surprizing a
Sight; but being at this time Mistress
of her Passion, she said nothing, but
looking only once more towards the
Apartment of the young Ladies.
plainly discovered her unfaithful Lover.
A thousand times she was in a mind
to divulge it; a thousand confused
Thoughts, and a thousand uncertain
Resolutions presented themselves to
her, she rejected sometimes one thing,
and she approved the other, but with∣out
any stable Resolution; she feared to
offend the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in case
she should catch him in his amorous In∣treague;
but in a moment after, she
considered, that thereby he had rendred
himself unworthy of her Respect. <HI>Jea∣lousy</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="140"/>
entred into a close Combat with
<HI>Prudence,</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI> strugled hard to
evercome <HI>Jealousy.</HI> Thus she remain'd
for a considerable time, uncertain, what
to do.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>Emilia</HI> and <HI>Phila∣delphia</HI>
seeing they must resolve to con∣trive
a way to deliver the Duke out of
his Prison, at last concluded, there was
no other means to compass it, than to
let him down in a great Basket or Ham∣per,
with Ropes ty'd to it, out of the
Window, whence they might let him
slide down gently to the Ground. They
were provided with Ropes, the Win∣dow
being low, and looking into a soli∣tary
part of the Park, they were secure
no Body would come that way so late
in the Night, to be an Eye-Witness of
the matter. They proposed it to the
Duke, as the only way they had left to
help him out, and he readily accepted
of it, not so much out of a desire of his
engagement with my Lord <HI>Gray,</HI> as the
uneasiness he lay under of being so near
a Lady, unto whom he used to swear
every Day, an inviolable Love; and
betwixt two Mistresses, who, if they
had follow'd the first Motions of what
Spite and Rage they bore to one ano∣ther,
they would have kill'd one ano∣ther
before his Face. So, without more
ado, he got into his Hamper, and in
this little Machine began to move
downward, with good hopes of Success,
<PB N="151" REF="141"/>
had it not been for two unfortunate Ac∣cidents.
The first was Madam—who
being no longer able to contain her Jea∣lousy
within Bounds, went into the
Apartment of the young Ladies, un∣der
pretence of having left her Fan,
and not seeing him there, she moved
towards the Closet, the Door whereof
being left open by a great piece of care∣lessness,
she saw her Lover go down
gently in the Hamper, without being
perceived either by <HI>Emilia</HI> or <HI>Philadel∣phia.</HI>
The Duke was no so careless as
they, for his Eyes being continually
upon the Window, when he saw that
Lady appear there, he could have wish∣ed
himself under Ground; so all his
hopes was he should get down as fast
as they could let him, and avoid seeing
her for some Days. But at the same
moment he perceived, that <HI>Emilia</HI> and
<HI>Philadelphia,</HI> instead of letting him go
down along the Wall, used their utmost
Efforts, to pull him up again; but their
Hands being too weak and soft to ac∣complish
it, they left him hanging in
the Air.</P>
<P>Being very ill pleased with the dan∣gerous
Station in the airy Region, he
raised himself to see what was the mat∣ter;
but his Curiosity afforded him suf∣ficient
matter of Surprize, when he
saw the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> walking just un∣der
the Window, and that he had had
leisure enough to know him. 'Twas
<PB N="152" REF="142"/>
this that moved <HI>Emilia</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia,</HI>
not to let the Duke go lower, in hopes
he would not stay there long: But
what Lover would pass by the Apart∣ment
of his Mistress, whose Fidelity he
has reason to suspect, without at least
casting a Look that way; and even the
most indifferent Person would have had
Curiosity enough to observe a Hamper,
coming out of a Window. The Duke's
surprize to see the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI>
there, was not near so great as the Earls
was, to find him in this Machine: Had
this happen'd in any other place, but in
the King's Court, the Earl would infal∣libly
have demanded Satisfaction upon
the Spot from his Rival: His ill For∣tune
had brought him thither at a very
ill Hour; He was so highly satisfy'd in
his happy Condition, he thought him∣self
so entirely beloved by <HI>Emilia,</HI> that
the better to devote himself absolutely
to his endearing Thoughts, he had cho∣sen
the most shady and solitary part of
the Garden, for his present Retirement.
But as he was going out again, he was
surpriz'd to find the Doors all lock'd up,
except one, which commonly being
kept open longer than the rest, he
went out that way, and accidentally
pass'd by in sight of <HI>Emilia</HI>'s Chamber.
But he pay'd dearly for this Adven∣ture;
To see a Rival come out thence
at that time of the Night, so dange∣rous
a Rival, accustomed to please the
<PB N="153" REF="143"/>
Ladies, and engage their Hearts. 'Tis
no hard matter to guess, how his Heart
stood affected at such a Sight. Neither
was the Duke exempted from feeling
the Effects of so odd an Accident, by
reason of the presence of the Earl of
<HI>A—n,</HI> whom he intended to supplant,
and of Madam—, who he was
afraid would not keep Silence, but dis∣cover
an Intreague, which he would
have kept secret above all things.</P>
<P>But let us say something of <HI>Emilia;</HI>
guess at her Surprize, when she saw
the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> below, and Ma∣dam
—behind her; her Imagina∣tion
represented to her all the Discon∣tents
she was likely to suffer upon this
Account; Shame on one, and Re∣proaches
on the other side. The Duke's
Ingratitude, for whom she was like to
suffer so much, and the Satisfaction of
<HI>Philadelphia:</HI> Under all these Reflections
she remained so little Mistress of her
self, that she let go the Rope where∣with
they held the Duke in the Air,
and had not <HI>Philadelphia</HI> cry'd for Assi∣stance
from their common Rival, he
had fall'n to the Ground, and the Earl of
<HI>A—n</HI> would have had the Satisfa∣ction
to see him break his Neck just be∣fore
his Face. But Madam—
giving all the Assistance she could to her
Lover, he got down very well; and
what is most observable in this Scene,
as something very peculiar, was, that
<PB N="154" REF="144"/>
all the Actors thereof were turn'd
Mutes; whether it were that they had
taken a firm Resolution to remain si∣lent,
for Reasons easily guess'd at, or
whether Surprize, Spite and Jealousy
had taken away the use of their
Tonngues, certain it is, no Body spoke
a Word. The Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> kept at
some distance, to avoid the Duke, the
Sight whereof could not but put him
into a great Rage, the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI>
went a contrary way from the
Earl, being somewhat asham'd, he
should see him come down thus in a
Hamper. Madam—flew out of
the Closet like a Woman in Despair,
without vouchsafing either to look upon
or to enter into a Contest with the
young Ladies she had so much reason to
hate, and they let her go without speak∣ing
one Word to her.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> got no sooner
out of the Park, but he went home,
but being disquieted in his Mind to the
highest degree, could not stay long there;
so he order'd his Coach to be got rea∣dy,
and went to the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI>
not questioning but that he should find
him fast asleep, it being then two a
Clock in the Morning. He was so far
from fleeping, that he was then dispu∣ting
with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> the
Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> hearing them talk very
loud, order'd his <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> that
attended him, not to knock at the
<PB N="155" REF="145"/>
door, and he placing himself near it,
knew his Uncle's Voice, and heard him
give the following Answer to the Earl
of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> No, my Lord, no, I will
never pardon her as long as I live, the
Ingratitude wherewith she repays my
Love; you have been an Eye-witness of
her Deportment, and of the Reception
she gave me; to me, I say, who had
done her such a signal piece of Service,
in requesting the King to have her
brought back to <HI>London;</HI> to me, I say,
who run all Hazards, only to speak with
her for one moment; you can't deny
but that she is the most detestable of
all Women. Have you not read, said
the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> the Story of the
Amours of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. with the
fair <HI>Galriela d' Etrees;</HI> yes, said the
Duke, but I don't see how a thing that
happen'd an Age ago, should bear a
Comparison to what pass'd but last
Night. I will tell you, continu'd the
Earl; This great Monarch having dis∣guised
himself in a Peasant's Habit, to
travel with the more security thro a
Country where the Enemy's Army
lay encamped at that time, presented
himself before his Mistress, dress'd in a
course Canvass Jacket, with a Sack of
Straw upon his Head, and wooden
Shooes on his Feet; 'twas only to see
her he took all this Pains, and run such
Hazards; notwithstanding all this, ne∣ver
did an Act of Gallantry meet with
<PB N="157" REF="146"/>
less regard; she look'd upon him from
one side, and would scarce vouchsafe
to speak to him. This Adventure
makes me imagine that Lady's set as
much value upon a glistering out-side
or s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew, as they do upon the true Me∣rits
and Passion of a Lover. This is a
Parallel to my Case, reply'd the Duke;
my Seaman's Habit, under the disguise
whereof I slipt into her Chamber, did
offend her nice Humour; and what you
tell me puts me in mind, that one day
when she and I were at variance about
a matter of Consequence, wherein I
own my self in the wrong; yet she
soon forgave me, because she had seen
me at <HI>White-Hall</HI> with the Collar of the
Knights of the Garter. You having
had this Tryal before, added the Earl,
you were in the wrong to appear before
her in your Seaman's Cap. The Duke
fell a singing these words, <HI>A new day,
new care.</HI> I did not in the least think,
continu'd he, she would have used me
thus as she did; but I am resolv'd to
be reveng'd. You can't do any thing
against her, but what you will repent
of, said the Earl to him; I have found
by experience, that we often spoil out
of spite a good thing, which is impossi∣ble
to be mended afterwards. I knew
not what you have found, said the Duke,
but this I will assure you, I will post up
her Letters, and have them printed for
her satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="147"/>
The Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> finding that
their Conversation was likely to
last till day-break, was very glad to
hear the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> inveigh
thus against his Mistress; and tho' he
was unacquainted with the cause, yet
he thought it sufficient, that there was
a Woman in the case, to declare him∣self
her Enemy. Let us post her, this
ungrateful Woman, I am ready to do
any thing against her, cry'd he, entring
the Room: The Duke was not a little
surpriz'd to see his Nephew at that
time of the Night, and to he over∣heard
by him; What, do you know her,
my Lord, said he to him? No, reply'd
the Earl, I don't know her, I only es∣pouse
your Quarrel; and I am ready to
espouse all yours, said the Duke, im∣bracing
him: But it is but reasonable
to let you know who it is you are like∣ly
to have to do with; 'tis the Countess
of—your good Cousin, and most
faithful Friend. The Earl of <HI>A—n</HI>
who had always look'd upon her as a
Woman insensible to Love, was surpriz'd
to the highest degree. You will put the
charge upon me, said he, you very in∣differently
repay my Freedom and good
Intentions. You shall be convinced of
what I have told you, to be true, re∣ply'd
the Duke. You know her hand;
look here are her Letters, for I sent for
them on purpose, just as I was come a∣way
from her Lodgings, to read them
<PB N="158" REF="148"/>
to the Earl of St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s; if you have
patience enough to hear them read,
you shall judge your self what place
she had given me in her Heart. Were
they some of yours, said the Earl of
St. <HI>Albans,</HI> interrupting him, I would
promise to give you as long an Audi∣ence
as you desire; I was so much out
of Humour, when I took them out of
my Cabinet, reply'd the Duke, that I
don't know very well whether there be
any of mine among them; you will
perhaps also meet with some that are
not directed to me, for I lov'd her so
tenderly, that I us'd even to take
Copies of such Letters as she sent to
other Persons. You need not read 'em,
unless you please. We will read them
all, said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> provided
they tend towards her Condemnation,
or to prove in general, that all Women
are unfaithful; and that for to live in
true quietness, they ought to be ba∣nish'd
all Civil Societies. The Earl of
St. <HI>Albans</HI> looking upon him, said, My
Lord, you talk at a very different rate
from what you did yesterday morning
in the Park. The Earl of <HI>A—n</HI>
began to sing the same <HI>Italian</HI> words the
Duke had sung before, <HI>A new day, new
care.</HI> The Earl of St. <HI>Albans</HI> said, smi∣ling,
You are strangely imbroil'd in
Love, let us see whether these tender
and passionate Letters wont settle mat∣ters
betwixt you; I will read them to
<PB N="159" REF="149"/>
you, since both of you are too much
disturb'd by your Passions; but as for
my self, who enjoy both in my Heart
and Mind more Tranquillity, I shall
prove a very courteous Reader; and we,
said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> will act the
malicious Auditors.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>IF either your Pleasures or your Business,
in which you are always concern'd, leave
you some few Moments to dispose in favour of
me, I should be very glad to entertain you.
How great soever my Aversion may be, to
new Acquaintance, yours and my Friends,
have done you such good Offices with me,
that you ought to thank them for it; and
tho' I make very extraordinary steps for a
Woman, that always pretended to Regularity,
I am satisfy'd, my Lord, I shall have no rea∣son
to repent.</P>
<P>This is the first Letter, said the Duke,
interrupting the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> the
Countess writ to me; I must confess,
that upon the Receipt thereof, I was
ever-joy'd at the permission she gave
me, to pay my Services to her; I ne∣ver
had spoke to her in private, but
always liked her extreamly; and the
only thing that prevented my making
my Addresses to her, was, because I
had at all times a natural Aversion to
long Courtship; and according to the
<PB N="160" REF="150"/>
Character she bore in the World, she
had an equal share of Indifferency and
Beauty; I give you leave to guess, with
what pleasure I went to visit her; I was
not in my Seaman's Habit at that time,
but all dress'd in Silk with golden
Flowers; but I am asham'd to have in∣terrupted
you with these Trifles; come,
go on, read, I will not interrupt you
any more.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>YOU were so very sleepy when you went
away from me last Night, that I could
not but be vex'd at it all Night; certainly
I am not very amiable, because you could
sleep at that rate so near me. I remember'd
also, that I had entertain'd you with very
obliging Expressions, which you did not so
much as take notice of; and am convinced
that your drowzy Humour rendred you un∣worthy
of knowing them: My Sister pre∣scribes
the use of <HI>Tea</HI> and <HI>Coffee</HI> to you,
whenever you intend to see her; she says it

<P>How I did the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
fleep in the Company of two fair Ladies,
said the Earl of <HI>A—n;</HI> O! what
Times, and what Manners! You might
have exclaim'd against me, reply'd the
<PB N="161" REF="151"/>
Duke, if I had been to entertain 'em
alone; but I was surrounded by twen∣ty
Women at least, who talk'd altoge∣ther
at a time, and such insignificant
next to nothing Stuff, that there was
no intermedling with them for a Man
of Sense. What could a Man do in
such a case? My Mistress was present;
I would not go away; I was vex'd at
the Company, and unwilling to divert
them, so I pretended to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leep. You
should, said the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> have
seated your self next to her, you should
have talk'd very low, and to no Body
else but her; 'tis easy to give Advice,
said the Duke; but if you have a Re∣spect
for a Woman, and all the rest
make it their Business to observe her,
do you think it is easy to separate
one's self from the whole Company,
without being miss'd or taken notice
of; you have sufficiently clear'd your
self, added the Earl, let us see another

<P>MY Cat, that Terror of the Mice, my
poor Cat is dead; she wants an Epi∣taph
to transmit to Posterity all the most re∣markable
Actions to her whole Life. I ad∣dress
my self to you, my Lord Duke, for no
Body in the World is beyond you for gaining
of Hearts. I desire no other Witness than
the Verses you brought me yesterday, they
<PB N="162" REF="152"/>
rais'd Tears in the finest Eyes in the World.
Why are you so perfect a Master in the Art
of Love, you, I say, who make such ill use
of it.</P>
<P>This Reprimand I got, said the Duke,
because I went abroad a Hunting one
day, when I might have had the oppor∣tunity
of seeing her; And how came
you to commit such a Fault, said the
Earl of St. <HI>Albans?</HI> You know, reply'd
the Duke, that my Station at Court
obliges me to attend the King; and
tho' I miss oftner than perhaps I
ought to do, yet it seem'd to me that
the King would take particular notice of
my Absence; and that therefore I ought
not to incur the King's displeasure up∣on
that account. This is perhaps the
first time that ever Prudence got the
better over my Passion. We wont quar∣rel
any longer with you upon that
score, said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> provi∣ded
you will let us see those Verses
which set the finest Eyes in the World
a crying. The Subject is very moving,
said the Duke, they contain the Grief
of <HI>Venus</HI> upon the death of <HI>Adonis;</HI> 'tis
long ago since I made them; 'twas
the Countess of <HI>S</HI>—that gave
me the first notice of it; she under∣stands
<HI>Italian,</HI> and I find that Language
to contain certain secret and ten∣der
Expressions, very proper to repre∣sent
the Sentiments and most violent
<PB N="163" REF="153"/>
Passion of an afflicted Soul. I laboured at
that time under such heavy Afflictions,
that I composed that piece, without
taking any great Pains in it. 'Tis true,
said the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> that where∣ever
I intend to represent a violent Pas∣sion,
I always speak of yours for the
Countess of <HI>S</HI>—. This made the
Duke fetch several deep Sighs, he kept
his Eyes fix'd on the Ground, for a con∣siderable
time, and at last, recovering
himself, said, If you have a mind to see
me fall into a very deep Melancholy,
you need only to recal to my mind,
that most happy time, when I was be∣loved
with so much Tenderness, and
that by one of the finest Women in the
whole Universe. Come let us read,
said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> without
dwelling any longer upon a Subject,
which causes so much Pain to you.</P>

<P>THough I have a very peculiar Name,
and it is very hard to find it among
the Feasts, the old Duke of—has
found it out in his old Almanack, and rega∣led
me with an antique Harmony of Musick,
or rather with an odd modern piece of Mu∣sick,
beyond all value for its Singularity.
Where were you, my Lord, when this so
dangerous Rival was hard at work to sup∣plant
you by his nocturnal Serenade? Do you
thus entrust with my own Heart, the care of
<PB N="164" REF="154"/>
remaing faithful to you; and don't you
know▪ there are certain capricious Moments,
which don't always declare in favour of Me∣rits.</P>
<P>Who can this old Duke be, said the
Earl of <HI>A—n?</HI> Was it the Duke of
<HI>Norfolk?</HI> I know not a more gallant Man
than him. No, said the Duke smiling,
'twas not him, and since you have such
a desire to know it, it was the Duke of
—. How, my Father, cry'd the
Earl of <HI>A—n!</HI> Yes, he himself, ad∣ded
the Duke, he was just return'd out
of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he had staid three
whole Years, without ever coming to
the <HI>English</HI> Court. The first time he ap∣pear'd
there, he saw the Queen, with
all the Ladies of her Attendance, in her
Closet: The Countess of—being
among the rest, he was highly charm'd
with her Person. I remember it very
well, said the Earl of <HI>A—n.</HI> I re∣member
we were invited to Supper at
the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s, and at the
very moment he was going into the
House, the Picture of the Countess of
—was given to him by a Mes∣senger,
which he took, and returning
home, made us stay till twelve a
Clock, before we went to Supper. I
never was more vexed at any thing in
my Life, than at this piece of Rob∣bery,
said the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in∣terrupting
him; for you must know
<PB N="165" REF="155"/>
that this Picture was sent to my Sister,
on purpose to be given to me. I sent
for an excellent Picture-Drawer out of
<HI>Holland,</HI> and it was with her Husband's
Knowledge and Consent she was to
present the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI>
with her Picture. I waited with a
great deal of Impatience at my Sister's
House, in hopes to see my self in
possession of a Piece, which by the
Rules of Love, I might challenge be∣fore
the Duke of—, when to
my no small Vexation, I understood,
what Game he had play'd me; You
may easily imagine, whether I was not
ready to die with Spite; To send for a
Picture-Drawer on purpose, so far as
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> to draw a fine piece for your
Father's use, this was a thing I could
not well digest; Nay, I accused the
Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI> as much, as if it
had really happen'd by her Contrivance
or Neglect, and at last Complained of
my Mishap to the Countess. The share
she bore in my Misfortune, she expres∣sed
with so much Tenderness, that I
had not the least reason to doubt, but
that she actually intended this pledge of
Friendship, for no body else but my
self. So it was agreed betwixt us, she
was to write to the Duke of—,
and demand her Picture. The Copy of
her Letter is in this Bundle; and after
having look'd a little while, and found
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he read these Words:</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>I Won't ask you, my Lord, what made you
take my Picture at the Dutchesses of
<HI>Richmond;</HI> if you intend it for an Orna∣ment
of your Closet, you need not want others
much more handsome, and better done. But
if you look upon it as a piece, in the Possessi∣on
whereof you take Delight, you are not
very nice in putting a value upon what you
have not received from my Hands; and which
I can't suffer to be in yours, without a most
sensible Displeasure. Take my word for it,
I would have you begin, with the restoring it
to me, nnd if you deserve it hereafter, I
will not refuse it to you.</P>
<P>I was with my Father, said the Earl
of <HI>A—n,</HI> when this Billet came to his
Hands: He was extreamly nettled, and
so unsettled in his Resolution, that for
want of another Confident, he told me
what a Dilemma he lay under. He
ask'd me whether he should send back
the Countess's Picture, for fear he should
exasperate her, if he did otherwise;
but I disswaded him from it; I told him
it was only a piece of her Countenance,
she redemanded her Picture, and that
she was not ill-pleased to know her Pi∣cture
to be in a place, where it was
more admired than it would be at the
Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s. In short, I for∣tify'd
him so well against the Displea∣sure
<PB N="167" REF="157"/>
of the Countess, that he resolved
not to obey her. I am extreamly oblig∣ed
to you, my dear Nephew, said the
Duke smiling, you might have saved
your self the trouble of this Advice to
the Duke of—. I was ignorant,
my Lord, of your Pretensions there,
reply'd the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> and I pro∣test
to you, had I known it, I would
have sacrificed my Father's Passion to
yours. Whilst they were discoursing
together, the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> was
looking among the Papers for the
Duke's Verses upon <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Adonis;</HI>
but he told him, that the Countess of
<HI>S</HI>—had kept them, and that there∣fore
they would make an end of the
Letters.</P>

<P>I Did believe, the Scarf I sent you yester∣day,
could not challenge a more solid me∣rit
at your Hands, than its being a piece of
my own handy Work; nay, I may tell you,
that my Heart had a good share in it; 'tis
this Heart, I say, which made me fancy to
embellish it with Cyphers, and to surround
them with all the amorous Accoutrements of
the God of Love. I remembred upon this
occasion, with what Pleasure I received the
Wound he gave us at one stroak; I was am∣bitious
to discover to you my Satisfaction, by
the Nosegays of Roses, ty'd up by the double
Thread of Love. But must I tell you fur∣ther,
<PB N="168" REF="158"/>
what came into my Mind? It was,
that Roses never grow without Prickles, and
that, if one time or other, you should prove
inconstant, you would make me feel such
Pains, as would prove mortal.</P>
<P>This Letter, said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI>
being the most passionate of all we have
read as yet, is to be one of the first
that is to be posted. Unless you give
over this Design, reply<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Earl of
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> I assure you I will lock them
up in my Scrutore, and you shall have
not one of them at your Disposal.
And why so much care for an unfaith∣ful
Woman, said the Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham.</HI>
That is more than you know,
reply'd the Earl, she has only given
you a cold Reception, and perhaps she
thought she had reason for it. But sup∣posing
she had given you real Cause of
Complaint, would you go about to ru∣in
the Reputation of a Lady, you loved
before? The Duke sighed, and without
returning any farther. Answer, desired
him to go on in the reading of the Let∣ters:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>HOw malicious is this Dutchess with
blew Eyes and black Hairs? How well
did I interpret her Looks? O how I dread
her? If you can't hate her, you certainly
<PB N="169" REF="159"/>
are going to cease to love me. I guess'd at
your Sighs; they were not intended for me;
you offer your Incense upon an Altar, whereof
the Smoak only comes to me. But don't ac∣custom
your self to these Practices, for you
will not find me so very easy, but rather mu∣tinous
and quick-fighted; nay, I may perhaps
prove the disturber of your Pleasures.</P>
<P>There is a Touch of Jealousy, conti∣nued
the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> which shews
you were beloved by her. Rather tell
me, reply'd the Duke, that she had a
mind to pick a Quarrel with me; for
the Lady she speaks off, is the Dutchess
of—. All the World knows,
I was never captivated by her Eyes, and
that if I sigh in her Company, 'tis be∣cause
I can't kill her: After all this,
you see, it serves the Countess for a
Pretence to quarrel with me. Perhaps
she has been acquainted, added the Earl
of <HI>A—n,</HI> that you did sigh once
for her, and it is natural enough to fear,
least what has pleased us once, may
please us for ever. O reply'd the Duke,
I have declared so long ago open War
against this Favourite, that there is not
the least fear of the return of my Love
there, unless I should be quite out of
my Senses. But notwithstanding the
Countess is sufficiently sensible of this
Truth, you can't imagine how she has
plagued me, and what I have been for∣ced
to suffer on account of this whim∣sical
<PB N="170" REF="160"/>
Fiction: Nay, she push'd the mat∣ter
so far, as if she lay under an Obli∣gation
of proving the whole to be mat∣ter
of Fact. Here is, continued he, a
Letter I writ to her in relation of this
Chimera. Let us read it, said the Earl
of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> with attention, it being
the first we have seen as yet of your
Writing.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>COuld I believe I should ever see that Day
to find you so much changed. Alas!
was it possible that so much Tenderness, where∣of
I thought your Heart the surest Pledge,
could cease out of Jealousie. Am I the occasion
of that capricious Humour, and won't you give
me leave to justifie my self? 'Tis not, Ma∣dam,
that I pretend to oppose your Intentions:
If you have a mind to find me guilty, I am
willing to condemn my self. But if you will
act withont Passion, do me what Justice is
due to me. Were you capable of Compassion,
you would pity my present Condition; I am
melancholy almost to Despair. And why,
Madam, will you not let me see again some
happy Days, after having made me feel so ma∣ny
cruel ones?</P>
<P>I am sure, said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI>
she could not refuse so tender a Re∣quest.
Nothing less, reply'd the Duke,
she had sworn to try my Patience to the
utmost; and I wanted not Enemies,
<PB N="171" REF="161"/>
who entertain'd her every day with
some idle Story or other, especially in
relation to Madam <HI>A</HI>—, that fair
<HI>Scotch</HI> Lady, who came to Court on ac∣count
of a criminal Affair of her Bro∣ther.
I remember her Charms too well,
said the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> to forget
with what an envious Eye you were
look'd upon on account of your making
your Addresses to her, because every
body was of Opinion, that it would be
in vain to attempt to supplant you, 'Tis
true, continued the Duke, she had so
much Goodness as not to dislike the
Proofs I gave her of my Passion; but it
is also no less true, that there was no∣thing
in it that could give any cause of
Offence to the Countess: For, if it be
a Crime for a Man to love above once
in all his Life-time; no body can be
innocent at that rate. But in spite of
all these Reasons, she would push the
matter to the utmost; pray judge by
this Letter:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>A Thousand secret Thoughts have too too
much foreboded your Inconstancy, or at
leàst, that nice relish, which is the constant At∣tendant
of an excessive Passion, and which did
covince me, that your Deportment towards me,
was not such as it ought to be; But I endea∣voured
to deceive my self; and the Constraint
you put upon your self to dissemble your
<PB N="172" REF="162"/>
Thoughts, did easily perswade me to it. A∣las!
I loved to be deceived; what must I
have done, if you had always given me occa∣sion
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> loving you, if you would have deser∣ved
it; or to say better, If you had always
wish'd it as much as I did? Good God! how
far are you from it, and how ashamed am I,
to continue my Passion for an ungrateful Man?</P>
<P>By this Letter alone, I judge you are
in the wrong, said the Earl of S. <HI>Al∣bans,</HI>
and by this Letter alone, I am sure
she is foolish, said the Duke, interrupt∣ing
him; for she, complain'd without
Cause, and filled her Head with Chime∣ra's,
on purpose to please her self, and
to torment me; I loved none but her,
and she had reason enough to be satis∣fy'd
in it. Here is the Answer I sent
her:</P>

<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<P>YOur unjust Reproaches, have robb'd me
of all my Repose, and I am satisfy'd
if you go on in the same way, it will not be
long before you will put an end to my Life,
I have been strugling with my self all this
Night, to forbear writing to you this Morn∣ing,
but in vain, I am forced in spite of all
my Pride, to lay open my Frailties to you; I
am forced, I say, to conjure you, to restore
to me your Heart; and to win that without
which, I must be unhappy for ever. Triumph
over my Passion, use your Victory as you think
<PB N="173" REF="163"/>
fit, for <HI>I</HI> am not in a Condition to hold out
longer.</P>
<P>If this Letter did not touch her
Heart, I will hate her more than ever,
said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> because there
appears in it a certain tender and engag∣ing
Character, which must give the Lye
to all her imaginary Notions. Here is,
said the Duke, her Answer:</P>

<P>YOu speak of your Sentiments in so en∣gaging

impossible for me to be satisfy'd with a divided
Heart; either all or nothing.</P>
<P>I long extreamly, said the Earl of
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> to meet with a Peace-making
Letter. I did encompass it, by a Me∣thod
quite opposite to my Inclinations,
continued the Duke; I am naturally
inclined, never to give any Cause of
Dissatisfaction to what I love; but find∣ing
that all my Submissions, met with
a very ill Reception, and that they ser∣ved
only to augment her Pride; I pre∣tended
to make my Addresses to a Wo∣man,
who being both old and ugly,
had but little about her to recommend
her self, except her Wit, which made
so far an amends for the defect of the
<PB N="174" REF="164"/>
rest, that she proved a dangerous Rival
to the Countess, who finding her self
touch'd most sensible, writ to me these
Lines.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="12" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems as if all the World were agreed to
inform me of the many occasions of Com∣plaint

and that you have been always ready to sacri∣fice

You are like the <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Savages,</HI> who

both of you and my self.</P>
<P>I pretended to slight this Billet, said
the Duke, and sent no Answer to it,
and meeting her in the Queen's Apart∣ment,
I would not speak to her, tho'
she gave me all possible Opportunity to
do it. I stuck close to my old Lady,
and follow'd her wherever she went;
and I swear to you, that this Amuse∣ment,
as ridiculous as is seem'd to be,
stood me in great stead to suppress my
Spleen; and if there was but little
Inticement for my Eyes to look
upon her, my Mind did meet with
something that was very diverting:
It seem'd as if the Graces and Love it
self spoke thro' her Mouth. O! said
the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> I now find out
<PB N="175" REF="165"/>

her to me, you have been in some mea∣sure
my Rival; no, said the Duke, I
only pretended to be so; and if you
will peruse this Letter, you will be
convinced, there is no better way to
rouse a Mistress, than to make her be∣lieve,
that it is not beyond your
power of changing her for another</P>

<P>YOV have taken so little care to de∣serve
my Heart, and you make use of
such effectual Methods to lose it, that it is
apparent, I love you in spite of your self. I
am not so blind as not to see your Faults; no,
I see them all, and better than any Body else
would do; because I am much more con∣cern'd
in them: However, my Lord, whe∣ther
it be my Stars, or my Captious Hu∣mour,
whether both together, or rather my
Heart, which remains unalterable to you; I
am still the same. Alas! can there be a
worse Fate than that which attends me. If I
could at least move you to Compassion, since I
am not capable of inspiring other Sentiments
into you, I should have much less reason of
Complaint than I now have; But what do I
talk of moving your Pity? O! what makes
me run upon these Extravagancies! No, my

At the reading of this Letter all my
Resolutions vanish'd immediately, I
found my self unable to hold out
longer, continu'd the Duke, against a
Woman, I loved too tenderly for my
Repose. I went to see her, I threw my
self at her Feet, I ask'd her a thousand
Pardons, and an entire good Corre∣spondence
was re-establish'd betwixt
us; no Body ever relish'd his good For∣tune
better than I did; and it seem'd
to me, as if what I had suffer'd served
only to give more strength to my Pas∣sion;
and notwithstanding this happen∣ed
at a ticklish Conjuncture, when the
King would needs have me bare a con∣siderable
share in the management of
publick Affairs, I always found a way
not to be wanting in what I ow'd to
the Countess, and I never fail'd to
write to her once a day. The Billet
you hold in your hand, said he to the
Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> is one of them. Yes,

<P>EVer since I began to love, I us'd to tell
my self every day, it was impossible my
Love should encrease; and after all, I find
it does augment in a most surprising manner
to me. Is it possible, that at the same mo∣ment
I write to you, there should be an addi∣tion
<PB N="177" REF="167"/>
still? O! sweet Reflection, which flat∣ters
my Heart; I know what it is that can
augment my Love, 'tis, my dear Countess,
that you would love me, as much as I love
you.</P>
<P>I confess to you, said the Earl of
<HI>A—n,</HI> I could not have imagin'd
you to have been capable of so exces∣sive
a Passion; And what should hinder
me, reply'd the Duke, smiling? Your
engagement with the Countess of <HI>S</HI>—,
said the Earl, it seems to me, that af∣ter
a Man has loved so long, and so
passionately, one can't love any more
to the same degree. That is no gene∣ral
Rule, said the Duke; there are cer∣tain
Persons in the World, who can't
live without an amorous Passion. But,
added the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> when you
have thus contracted a habit of loving,
it ought rather to be stiled an Amuse∣ment.
You may call it a habit in some,
there being a certain sort of People, who
never are in earnest in these Matters.
To justify their Inconstancy, they will
tell you, that it is impossible to have
several excessive Passions successively;
that the first is generally the most vio∣lent
and strongest. There may perhaps
be something of Truth in this; but as
to what concerns my self, I find always
the same disposition in my Heart; I
only change the Object, to day a fair

my Soul, and thus entangle me
each in their Arms; this is the only
difference I am able to find out in my
Sentiments. The two Earls could not
forbear laughing at the Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham</HI>'s
discourse, and without making
any further Reflections upon the mat∣ter,
the Earl of St. <HI>Albans</HI> read these
words.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="15" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>NO, I know not any thing in the World
more vexatious than those Visits of Ce∣remony
one is obliged to receive. I have
spent the whole day under such a Constraint,
as is almost unexpressible. 'Tis true, you
were in my Company, but it is also no less
true, that to see you, and not to dare to
speak to you, nay, not so much as to look up∣on
you, without the utmost precaution, is a
most severe Tryal to me. To be sure tell me,
you bare a considerable share in my Pain, and
exclaim with the same violence against these
impertinent Gossips, as I do. I flatter my
self you had so much of them, as not to be
smitten with the growing Charms of that
meagre Beauty that sat next to you; had it
been otherwise, I should certainly have found
you out; if ever it should be so, pray keep
it from my Knowledge, for I love you too
much, not to be jealous.</P>
<P>And who was that so dangerous
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Beauty, said the Earl of St. <HI>Al∣bans;</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="169"/>
'twas my Lady—, reply'd
the Duke, casting a malicious Smile
upon the Earl of <HI>A—n.</HI> He blush'd
and kept silence for some time at these
words; but soon after, I confess, said
he, you have disappointed me in my
Intentions, I little expected to see you
here. We meet sometimes, said the
Duke, without a set Appointment;
but I assure you, whatever may have
been said concerning that Lady, she
never was my Beauty. She was ours
once, said the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> laugh∣ing;
but as for my self I met but with
an indifferent Reception, she sacrificed
me with a great deal of ease to the
Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> as he did make her a
Sacrifice to the young <HI>Emilia.</HI> Good
God! cry'd the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> why
would you revive in my Soul those
furious Thoughts which were some∣what
allay'd by the Countess's Letters,
and the Duke's Discourse. What is it
I have done against you, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to recall
to my Mind the most cruel Infidelity
that ever any one could be guilty of?
I declare to you, said the Earl of St. <HI>Al∣bans,</HI>
had I known it, I would have of∣fer'd
you no cause of Vexation; but
you know I don't set up for a Con∣jurer.
And what do you think brought
me hither, said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI>
abruptly; 'tis not very customary, for
People to make a Visit in cooll Blood at
such an unseasonable time of the Night,
<PB N="180" REF="170"/>
No, said the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> that is
indeed not very usual; but it seems
to be more extraordinary, that you
for these two hours have amused your
self, and spoke of nothing but such
Matters as are indifferent to you, with∣out
mentioning one word of what Mo∣tive
brought you hither. Alas! said
the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> interrupting
him, and fetching a deep sigh; I wish
I might never speak, nay, not so much
as think of it, for my own Repose;
and I was over-joy'd to meet with this
Obstacle to check my design of enter∣taining
you with that Subject. If it be
so, continu'd the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI>
come let us go on in reading the Let∣ters.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="16" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>OH! I am ready to die with trouble and
fear; <HI>Esther</HI> having lost the Billet, I
writ to you yesterday, it may perhaps be fal∣len
into my Husband's hands; if it should
prove so, I am undone; but, my Lord, don't
engage too far in the matter, your Preserva∣tion
being dearer to me than my own Life.
Take heed, not to come to my Lodgings, till
we know what is further to be done; O!
how dearly I purchase this Precaution; I
shall remain without seeing you, for a long
time, and perhaps for ever; O! Good God!
to what Despair am I reduced!</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="171"/>
I am as much concern'd as it, at this
moment, said the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> as
the Countess could be at that time;
for if her Husband had found out this
<HI>Billet Doux,</HI> I am apt to believe she
would have had but a very indifferent
time of it. I am of the same Opinion,
said the Duke, and I thought I should
have fretted my self to death. I was
so highly concern'd at it, that I sent
her word, in case the Earl should get
notice of our Intreague, I was resolv'd
to fight him, in order to deliver her
of any further apprehensions upon that
account, either by his or my own
death. This is a sort of violent Re∣medy,
said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> and
after what happen'd betwixt you and
the Earl of <HI>S</HI>—, she might have
laid odds, that she should date the be∣ginning
of her Widowhood from the
day you were to fight with her Hus∣band.
Don't jest, said the Duke, for
had it come to a Duel, 'tis likely his
Destiny would have been no other than
that you speak of. The Countess being
frighted at it, writ me another Billet.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="17" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>WHat are you going to do, my Lord,
do you intend to prevent an uncertain
Evil by another, which must prove both our
ruins? Oh! Have a care not to think of it,
your very Proposal having almost frighted me
<PB N="182" REF="172"/>
to death. I am in hopes the Billet which is
the occasion of our present Disquiet, will
produce no further ill Consequences; but if
it should, I can't find in my heart to consent
to any violent Resolutions: And tho' I love
no Body but your self, and have a great A∣version
to him, who distrubs our Repose, yet
I will find a way to defend him, whenever
you go about to attack him.</P>
<P>Being now convinced, continued the
Duke, she was a Woman of a generous
Temper, I esteem'd her more than ever;
however, the loss of the Billet was not
attended by any sinister Consequences,
because <HI>Esther</HI> was so fortunate as to
find it again; and I, for my part, did
not launch out into any Extravagan∣cy.
To speak the truth, you give it
the best Name you can, said the Earl of
<HI>A—n;</HI> for what can be more extra∣vagant,
than to fight a Man, because
he has a sufficient reason to be exaspe∣rated
against his Wife? How! would
you, cry'd the Duke, have me see her
expos'd to those Sufferings, whereof I
my self was the cause; would you have
me do so? Is it just, said the Earl, for
a Man to patronize Coquettry and Infi∣delity
in a Woman; is it not much more
agreeable to the Dictates of Reason, to
leave her to her ill Fortune, and to be
punish'd by her Husband. Oh! cry'd
the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> you argue at so
odd a rate, that I can't hear you with
<PB N="183" REF="173"/>
patience, and I could never have ima∣gin'd
you could have deviated so far
from all the Rules of good Sense. For
my part, said the Duke, I am so far
from being impatient thereat, that his
Fancy is extreamly diverting; for I
can't conceive how he can lay this
down for a good Maxim, That a Man
who tenderly loves a Lady, and has no
occasion of Complaint against her, can
in point of Honour abandon her to the
Anger and ill Usage of her Husband.
Here is two to one against me, said the
Earl of <HI>A—n;</HI> and therefore consi∣dering
the odds you have against me,
I cannot wonder at your Resolution of
persisting in maintaining a bad Cause;
neither will I go about to reduce you
by my Arguments into the right Path,
which I now tread alone, but content
my self not to follow your Footsteps:
The Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> without return∣ing
an Anfwer, took out another Bil∣let.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="18" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>IF the opportunity, that was given to me,
to oblige a Friend, was infinitely accep∣table
to me; I must tell you the Obligation it
put me upon of asking this fauour for him,
was infinitely disagreable to me; have a re∣spect
to my Vanity, if possible, I know you to
be generous and grateful; I have inclosed a
<HI>Memorandum</HI> of what I desire at your
<PB N="184" REF="174"/>
hands; if you don't comply with it, pray
sweeten your Refusal; but if you will grant
my Request, remember, my Lord, it must
be done without delay.</P>
<P>The Memorandum related said the
Duke, to my Lord <HI>Cl</HI>—, who was
then afraid of being lessen'd in the
King's Esteem, by reason of some Ad∣vice
given by him, which met not with
the desired Success. There was at that
time no great Intimacy betwixt us,
some hot Words having pass'd in the
Privy-Council, in a matter wherein we
opposed one another with a great deal
of Heat. This made me shew some
sort of Dissatisfaction upon that Head;
and as I may say it without Vanity, that
I was very instrumental in promoting
him to the Dignity of High-Treasurer,
so, he being sensible he should stand in
need of my Assistance, to maintain him∣self
in that high Station, and conse∣quently
was disturbed at my Coldness
towards him; he observed me so nar∣rowly,
that at last he found out the In∣treague
betwixt the Countess and me,
and soon engaged her in his Interest;
she being a Lady who made a conside∣rable
Figure, and frequently play'd
at Court. This done, he gave her a Me∣morandum,
under pretence of some
Affair of Moment, but in effect to get
an Opportunity of entring into a Cor∣respondence
with me. I guess'd imme∣diately
<PB N="185" REF="175"/>
at the Truth of the matter;
and I was soon engaged to grant his
Request. The Countess was highly sa∣tisfy'd
thereat, and we continued our
Conversation with mutual Satisfaction,
till the King thought fit to send me to
the <HI>Hague,</HI> in the Quality of his Ambas∣sador
Extraordinary, to enter upon a
Negotiation of Peace, most earnestly
desired by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> We arrived there
the 4th of <HI>July,</HI> 1672. and after a long
Conference with the Deputies of the
States, went to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
who was then in the Army, and thence
to that of the <HI>French</HI> King's, encamped
near <HI>Vtrecht.</HI> But as Affairs of State
were foreign to our purpose at present,
at least any further than they bear a
relation to my self in particular, 'twill
be enough to tell you, that the Coun∣tess,
some Days before my Departure
from <HI>London,</HI> writ me a most tender
Letter. The Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> took it,
and read these Words:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="19" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>I Am very willing to give you my Picture,
because you request it, as an allay to your
Pains; and that there is nothing I would not
do to ease them: But don't you believe I shall
envy its Happiness? You will keep it constant∣ly
by you, you will often look upon it, and
you will use it with a great deal of Tender∣ness,
whilst I am bewailing your Absence;
<PB N="186" REF="176"/>
and am debarred of all other Pleasures, but
of hearing News from you. I must own it to
you, my Lord, I can't perswade my self as yet,
you are so near your Departure. Your flat∣tering
Hopes have insinuated themselves into
my Soul, to prevent my being quite oppress'd
under the burthen of my present Troubles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="20" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>WHat is it I would not give, to put a
stop to your Voyage. Alas! how hap∣py
were Lovers in the first Ages, always true
to their tender Loves; free from Ambition;
they lived in their homely Cottages with their
Mistresses, they nover left them alone, they
never let them go out of their Sight. Inte∣rest
of State, had no Influence upon their
Souls, to disturb their innocent Pleasures; A
Treaty or Negotiation, perhaps founded upon
sinister Designs, never snatch'd the Sheepherd
out of his Sheepherdesses Arms. O happy
times, what is become of you? Why did not our
capricious Destiny let us be born in those Ages?
I should then not have undergone thi Disstis∣faction
to see you go away, and you would
have been ready to renounce those Chimerical
Notions o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Glory, which in reality don't af∣fect
our Heart; and instead thereof you
would have made place for yours, for the
sweet Enjoyments of a tender Friendship.</P>
<P>Two such engaging Letters, reply'd
the Duke, affected me most sensibly,
and having found means to spare some
<PB N="187" REF="177"/>
few Hours to see the Countess: O! what
surprizing and engaging things did not
she tell me upon this occasion. She was
all in Tears, no otherwise than if I was
agoing to travel from the <HI>South</HI> to the
<HI>North</HI> Pole. Truly, at this very time, I
can't but imagine, that this ungrateful
Woman can cry when she pleases; but
at that time, being foolish enough to
believe her to be in earnest, I writ, du∣ring
this excess of my Passion, this
Billet:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="21" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>WHat is it, I should not tell you upon my
Passion, and what Gratitude I owe
you. 'Tis all much below what I feel, and
there is nothing that can challenge a Comparison
with what I would do for you. If you are
the most lovely Woman in the World, I can
swear to you, that I am the most tender of all
Men living. Let me know at what Hour I
may come to assure you of it; but above all,
hasten that happy Minute, for I swear, should
you delay but never so little, I shall die with
Impatience.</P>
<P>How can you speak ill of a Person,
said the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> that once in∣spired
into your Heart so violent a Pas∣sion?
Don't you know, that the more
Pains a Woman takes to make her self
beloved by us, the more Acknowledg∣ment
we ought to pay her; for those
<PB N="188" REF="178"/>
feeble Engagements, which languish
and are ready to fail every Day, serve
only to amuse our Hearts, without giv∣ing
them the true Relish of Pleasure:
Our Soul has no share in the matter,
we see our Mistress without much Joy
or Disturbance. But, if a Man is
once raised to the highest pitch, all his
Reflections become more nice and live∣ly,
his Melancholly has a certain mix∣ture
of Sweetness, his Fears are so
much the stronger, as his Happiness is
more accomplish'd, and touches him to
the quick. What you say, is very true,
said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> interrupting
him, you ought to think your self high∣ly
obliged to a Mistress, for the Pains
she takes to appear amiable to you, and
to furnish you with those Letters,
which are so agreeable and dear to us:
But after an ungrateful Woman has
found the way to impose her Charms
upon us, what is it she does not deserve,
in case she is the first that breaks off with
and abandons her Lover. Let us go on
in the perusal of my Letters, said the
Duke, and afterwards we will begin to
consider, whether it is not rational to hate
as much the same Person one has loved
to an excess before. This Letter, said
the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> is of your Hand-Writing:
Yes, said the Duke, I sent it
to the Countess, just when I was upon
my Departure for <HI>Holland,</HI> it was writ∣ten
at a Juncture, when my Head was
<PB N="189" REF="179"/>
as yet full of those Panegyrick Expres∣sions,
wherewith she acted the passio∣nate
Lover to the Life, which I repre∣sented
to her in the following Letter:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="22" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>THe very Thoughts of being separated
from you, render my Sufferings so ex∣cessive,
that I have reason to believe, that
Death it self will not be so dreadful to me, as
your Absence. I am so much altered of late,
that my Friends scarce know me. Your Mo∣desty
keeps you in <HI>London,</HI> whilst my Duty
calls me to the <HI>Hague:</HI> Why are not you a
Sheepherdess and I a Sheepherd? What Plea∣sures
might not we enjoy in that happy Sta∣tion?
I should have the Satisfaction of seeing
no other Woman but your self? But alas?
how am I assured, that you would forget
every body for my sake, as I would neglect
every thing for you.</P>
<P>I was now ready to depart, and my
Lord being enclined to go along with
me, I was very glad of his Company,
being ignorant at that time, that I was
to carry a Spy with me. You will be
soon convinced of the Truth of it, when
I shall tell you, that he was in love with
the Countess; that he had not as yet
declared his Passion to her, and that having
got scent of mine, he also found out that I
was not indifferent to her, he did not think
it for his purpose, to endeavour to sup∣plant
<PB N="190" REF="180"/>
me openly, but that a private
Enemy being much more dangerous
than a declared Enemy, he intended to
give me such Blows, as should not be
in my power to avoid. With this In∣tention
only he went into <HI>Holland,</HI> ha∣ving
agreed beforehand with my Lady
—to shew his Letters to the Countess,
whenever she should have an Opportu∣nity
of talking of him to her; and that
thus the thing might appear very natu∣ral
and easie, unpremeditated, and
without Affectation. After my Arrival
at the <HI>Hague,</HI> she writ me the most ten∣der
Letters in the World, and commu∣nicated
also to me the Copies of several
Letters, she writ by way of Answer,
to those sent to her by the Duke of
<HI>D</HI>—in my Absence, which you
willd diverting enough.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="23" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>IF you have a mind to enter into an Ami∣ty
with me, such a one as may prove easy,
commodious, always attended with Pleasure,
and without Pain, I consent to it; but, my

your Troops, and look out for a Heart
more easy to be conquer'd than mine.</P>

<DIV3 N="24" TYPE="letter">
<PB N="191" REF="181"/>
<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>I Have met this day with three or four
several things, that equally afflict me; I
plaid and was on the losing side; my Spaniel
is dead; the Gloves you sent me, are too
much perfumed, your Fans seem'd to me too
brown, and your Billet too full of Tenderness;
I send you back, my Lord, your present, and
your Declaration; pray keep both for some
other Person, that may be better disposed to
return your Favours according to your Wish.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="25" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<P>YOu are very well at Home, and I am
extreamly well at my own Lodgings;
let us therefore keep each where we are; I
guess at what you intend to tell me, by what
I have heard you say before; and you may
l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kewise guess at what Answer I shall glve you,
by what I have told you already. Your Con∣stancy
is tiresome to me; my Heart is not to
be won by a long Siege, but must be surprised,
if you lose the first Moment, it is irrecoverable
for ever.</P>
<P>I did not fail to intermix some Expres∣sions,
full of Sincerity and Affections
with what the Countess writ me on ac∣count
of the Pretensions of the Duke
of <HI>O</HI>—to her. The publick Busi∣nesses
I was entrusted with, did not take
up all my time so far, as not to allot me
<PB N="192" REF="182"/>
certain Opportunities of bestowing my
most diverting Hours and Thoughts
upon her. Sometimes I writ to her,
and sometime I bestow'd in looking up∣on
her Picture. One Day, as my Eyes
were altogether fix'd upon this Picture,
my Lord—comes so softly into
the Room where I then was, that I not
in the least perceived him: He saw the
Countess's Picture, and knew it, and
the sight thereof proving to him an en∣tire
Confirmation of my good Fortune,
and of his Unhappiness, he was most
senbly afflicted thereat. He was just
agoing to withdraw, when I cast my
Eyes upon him; his Presence gave me
no small Disturbance, because I fear'd
every thing I ought to fear; I could have
been glad to discover the Truth, but
durst not go about to search for it too
far, least I should let him into a Secret,
whereof he was not Master as yet. We
look'd upon one another with so much
Confusion; that I wonder I should not
guess immediately at the Condition
of his Heart. But in relation to my
self, he had a much clearer insight into
my Sentiments, than I could have into
his; besides that, he might easily read
my Disturbance in my Eyes. We re∣main'd
both silent, when the Earl of
<HI>Arlington</HI> and Mr. <HI>Opdam</HI> coming into
the Room, their Presence hindred me
from speaking to my Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="183"/>
After our return from the <HI>French</HI>
King's Army, as I told you before, we
went to <HI>Brussels,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Mon∣tery,</HI>
Governour of the <HI>Spanish Nether∣lands,</HI>
happening to regale the Ladies
the same Evening we arrived there,
with a most splendid Feast, at the House
of the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. (as they call
it) seated in the midst of the Park of
<HI>Brussels,</HI> we were also invited thither:
The Season being then extreamly hot,
abundance of Lanthorns were ty'd to
the largest Trees, near unto the Walks,
where they danc'd. The handsomest
among the Ladies belonging to this lit∣tle
Court, appear'd there in Masque∣rade;
and I must confess, that there
were several among them, which would
have made a most glorious Figure in the
greatest Cities of <HI>Europe.</HI> Without speak∣ing
of the Princess of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> who
for her singular Merits deserves to
to have the preference before all the
rest of her Sex, I took a singular delight
in observing the Ladies of <HI>Bournonville,
de Lignes, de Raches, d'Hauray, d'Espino∣la
de Horna, de Stinau, d'Vrsel</HI> and of
<HI>Grimberg.</HI> This last may deservedly be
stil'd a growing Beauty, in the very
bloom of her Age, so nicely Featured,
of so glorious a Complexion, and so
pleasing an Air, that I was abso∣lutely
charm'd with her Person.
The Princess of <HI>Vaudemont</HI> being
dress'd like a <HI>Diana,</HI> was attended by
<PB N="194" REF="184"/>
the Ladies under the Disguise of
Nymphs. The Countess of <HI>Grimber∣gue</HI>
was one of them, her sine fair cur∣led
Hair, spreading in Locks all over
her Shoulders, besides that, she had se∣veral
Knots ty'd upon her Head in Buck∣els,
interspers'd with Emerauds and
Diamonds. At her Girdle she wore a
Bow, and Arrows, in a Quiver; her
Leggs appear'd half naked, and tho' she
was none of the tallest, she was so nice∣ly
shaped, and danced with so good a
Grace, that, to confess the truth, she
put me into no small Confusion, she
touch'd my Heart to the quick to such
a degree, that I appear'd very pensive
all the remainder of the Night. I drew
nearer her, but so prepossess'd with Fear,
that I never felt the like before in all
my Life. Fair Nymph, said I, do you
find here a Heart worthy of receiving
your Darts? 'Tis enough for me, re∣plied
she, smiling, to have found yours,
I shall not look any further, for to
make them exercise their Power. Such
an Answer as this, as it could not but
be exceedingly pleasing to me, so I dare
say it without Vanity, that our Conver∣sation
was not only very sprightly, but
also full of Wit, tho' we were often
interrupted by those who took her out
to dance, but she not failing to remem∣ber
her place, always sat her self down
again next to me.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="185"/>
The Ball ended, and with it all my
hopes; for upon a strict Enquiry, I
made concerning the Countess of <HI>Grim∣bergue,</HI>
I understood that she was mar∣ried
to one of her nearest Relations,
one of the handsomest Men in the
World; that they loved one another
most passionately, and that these little
Diversions she took, were never
known to have drawn her into any In∣treague.
My stay at <HI>Brussels</HI> was not to
be of so long a Continuance, as to af∣ford
me sufficient leisure, of out-play∣ing
her at her own Game, so I judged
it more prudent to shun her Company,
than to endeavour to please me self with
such small hopes of Success. However,
my Lord—did not fail in the
mean time, to make a great noise of
this Passion, in hopes of doing mischief.
He writ to Madam—, that I was
fallen in Love with the Countess of
<HI>Grimbergue,</HI> and that I had bestow'd up∣on
her the Countess's Picture, after ha∣ving
made it my Boast, that she had
presented it to me with her own Hands.
As there was nothing in this Story that
savoured of an Impossibility, so Madam
—was so charitable as to give an
Account of it to the Countess, who
taking the whole for an undoubted
Truth, was seized with the most violent
Resentment a Woman that thinks her
self abandon'd and betray'd, can be
capable off. She writ me this Let∣ter▪</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="26" TYPE="letter">
<PB N="196" REF="186"/>
<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>I find you so ungrateful and despiseable, that
your Inconstancy will not cost me as much
as one Sigh. The question is not now, con∣cerning
your Sentiments and mine; 'tis e∣nough,
that they are so opposite to one ano∣ther,
that they will never agree again. Had
it pleased Heavens to let me know you al∣ways,
as well as I do now, since you are tur∣ned
inconstant, this would have saved me a
world of Trouble. But without insisting any
further upon this Head, which can't but cause
me abundance of Pain; or without putting
you in mind of a piece of Infidelity, which
ought to make you blush; I will content my
self with demanding from you my Picture
and Letters, this being the only and the last
thing I shall desire of you; in lieu whereof I
promise to forget you, even without so much
as remembring your Name.</P>
<P>I hope, said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI>
you did not obey her; O! reply'd the
Duke, I never knew a Man yet, who
pretended to such a nice point of Ho∣nour,
as to restore such like Favours to
a handsome Woman. However, this
would prove of very good Consequence,
said the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> interrupt∣ing
him; and, when Ladies give us such
tender Proofs of the entire Confidence
in us, it is but reason we should not put
them to an ill use; but rather to make
<PB N="197" REF="187"/>
them Restitution of a matter of the
greatest moment, the Consequences
whereof may turn to their Ruin. They
would do much better, said the Duke,
not to run the hazard of it, and not to
write any thing, whereof a disobliged
Lover may make any Advantage against
them. This Advice is easy to be given,
said the Earl of St <HI>Albans,</HI> but not easy
Task, when a Heart is deeply engaged
in an amorous Intreague, to deny it
self the Satisfaction of writing a thou∣sand
pretty Fancies, that come into
ones Head. What Motive can be strong
enough to a Woman to stand always
upon her Guard, against the Person she
loves; who if he has known how to
find out the Secret of rendring himself
Master of his Mistress's Heart, how is
it possible he should miss of being ad∣mitted
under the quality of her Confi∣dent.
At this rate, the Ladies run all
the hazard alone, added the Earl of
<HI>A—n,</HI> and can accuse no body
but themselves and their own Impru∣dence.
The Argument was not likely
to have ended here, had not the Duke
interrupted the Earl, and told him:
I must own, that upon the Receipt of
the Countess's Letter, I was like Thun∣der-struck,
so that without giving my
self any further trouble of accomplish∣ing
the Negotiation, (according to my
Order) in which I had hitherto proved
very successful, I bid adieu to all man∣ner
<PB N="198" REF="188"/>
of Business, without the least regard,
and so I embark'd for <HI>London,</HI> like a Fool,
without the least regard to the good or
ill Consequences that might attend it.</P>
<P>I can't forbear to reflect upon this Con∣duct
of yours, said the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> was
it wisely done, to pitch upon a publick Mi∣nister,
who is in love, and to entrust him
with a Negotiation of such vast Conse∣quence?
O, cry'd the Duke, and where will
you find one that is otherwise? Do you be∣lieve
that all these Plenipotentiaries and
Ambassadors, who appear with so much
Gravity, are wiser than other People?
'Tis true, they act with more Circum∣spection,
and that is the only thing they
are oblig'd to in such like Cases by their
Character, but for the rest, I am confi∣dent,
they are as much for an Intreague
as any body else. During my Voyage,
continued he, all my Thonghts were
taken up in finding out what reason of
Complaint the Countess could have a∣gainst
me, and finding it could be no∣thing
else, but my Addresses to the
Countess of <HI>Grimbergue,</HI> I went for∣ward,
with a Resolution to be revenged
of the Person that had plaid me this
Game, without in the least thinking it
was my Lord—, for I never heard
of this Transaction till some time after.
Upon my arrival at <HI>London,</HI> instead of
going straitway to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> I went
immediately to the Conntess's; but to
add to my present Misfortune, I under∣stood
<PB N="199" REF="189"/>
she was gone to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> to drink
the Waters: Had I follow'd the Inclina∣tions
of my Heart, I had gone thither
without delay, but considering what
extravagancies I had been guilty of up∣on
her Account already, I thought it best
not to venture any further for that time.</P>
<P>When I came to the King to give him
an account of the Progress of the Ne∣gotiation,
I swear to you, I appear'd in
so distracted a Condition, that his Ma∣jesty
concluded I had been drinking hard
in the Yatcht, and that the Vapours of
the Wine had bereaved me of my Me∣mory.
He soon dismissed me, and I
could easily guess at his Thoughts; but
without giving my self the trouble to
undeceive him, I shut my self up in my
Closet, and spent the whole Night in
Writing, sometimes Verses, and some∣times
in Prose, but in the main, relating
altogether to bitter Complaints; being
touch'd most sensibly with the unreaso∣nable
Deportment of the Countess.
After all, nothing I had written seem∣ing
to me convincing enough, I judged I
had better go and see her in Person; but
knowing her to be of a very positive
and resolute Temper, and that, if she
once got it into her Head, she would
neither see nor hear me; I resolved to
disguise my self, and spent the remain∣der
of the Night, in contriving which
way best to effect it. At last a Thought
came into my Head, which pleased me
<PB N="200" REF="190"/>
infinitely. I knew her to be addicted
highly to Superstition, and her Inclina∣tions
leading so far to hear her Fortune
told her, that she was always in search
after every Body, that pretended but to
the least Skill or Reputation in Astrolo∣gy,
I my self having several times
brought <HI>G—y</HI> the Astrologer to her.
With this Resolution therefore to per∣sonate
a South-sayer, I appear'd in the
King's Presence, much dejected, laying
one Hand to my Head, and the other
upon my Heart, as if I had been very
ill. He soon perceived it, and ask'd me
with his wonted Goodness, how I did;
I told him I was most miserably afflicted
with the Head-ach, and a continual
Palpitation of the Heart, and that I
felt some Symptoms of a Feaver: As
ill Fortune would have it, I look'd so
well in the Face, that this alone was
sufficient to betray my Intentions, and
the King shewing much Compassion for
me, I could not act my Part so nicely,
but that I blush'd, and was quite con∣founded
at the Untruth I had told him.
One Day having engaged Doctor <HI>F—r</HI>
to meet me in the King's Apartment,
and the King enquiring after my Health,
he told him, that nothing could be more
proper to prevent my falling into a
dangerous Distemper, than <HI>Tunbridge</HI>
Waters▪ Go then, said the King to
me, tho' I have great occasion for you
at present, I will postpone my Interests
<PB N="201" REF="191"/>
to your Health; I must confess to you,
I was so sensible of the King's Good∣ness,
that I was several times upon the
point of declaring the Truth to him,
but durst not, for fear of spoiling all.</P>
<P>I left the King, highly satisfy'd with
his having given me leave to take my
Journey, and pitch'd upon the Earl of
<HI>A—e,</HI> my Friend, as a Confident,
he being then deputed by the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to make their most
humble Remonstrances to the King,
concerning Matters of the greatest mo∣ment;
He stood in need of my Interest
at Court, and therefore having sought
all possible means to enter into a strict
Friendship with me, I was sure he
would be very glad of taking this op∣portunity
to oblige me. I imparted to
him the whole Secret, and he was
over-joy'd to see me furnish him with
means to put an obligation upon me. It
was agreed he should go to <HI>Tunbridge</HI>
first, and endeavour, to raise in the
Countess a curiosity of consulting me
under the disguise of an Astrologer.
You know the Earl to be a Man of
sense, who under his grave and sedate
Deportment, conceals a great deal of a
very pleasing Temper; so that I judg∣ed
I could not put the management
of this Design into better hands than
his. He found the Countess very me∣lancholy
and pensive; the presence of
her Husband, for whom she always
<PB N="202" REF="192"/>
shew'd a great Regard, having, besides
this, put her under a great Constraint,
she entertain'd in her Breast a secret
Spite against me, which tormented her
without intermission; and as often as
she consider'd that I had prefer'd the
Countess of <HI>Grimbergue</HI> before her, she
was so enrag'd at me, that she thought
of nothing but Revenge. 'Twas in this
Condition the Earl found her; he ask'd
her a among other things, whether she
had heard nothing of that famous <HI>Lap∣ponida?</HI>
She answer'd, she knew not
what he meant; and that he should ex∣plain
himself, whether it were a Man,
a Beast, or a Plant. The Earl smil'd at
her Ignorance, and told her, that <HI>Lap∣ponida</HI>
signify'd as much as <HI>Laplander,</HI>
highly yers'd in <HI>Astrology,</HI> and inclining
to Sorcery; that being inform'd this
noted Negromancer was to be at <HI>Tun∣bridge,</HI>
he was come hither from <HI>London</HI>
on purpose to make him calculate his
Nativity, because he could tell as well
pass'd as present, and future things.</P>
<P>The Countess was so well pleas'd at
these words, that she ask'd him a thou∣sand
Questions; whether this <HI>Laplander</HI>
could speak <HI>English,</HI> whether he was of
an easy Access, what kind of a Crea∣ture
he was, and whether he had Dis∣cretion
enough to keep a Secret? He
told her, the <HI>Laplander</HI> understood <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
as well as his own Tongue; that
he was of a very odd Temper, avoided
<PB N="203" REF="193"/>
the Conversation of Women, spoke lit∣tle,
and was at least 200 years old;
but it is by his great Knowledge he
has protracted his Life, for knowing
the Virtues of all Simples, he has found
out the way of making himself young
again. He is so old, said he, that he
foretold Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> all that should
happen to the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> whereat
you know she could not but be very
nearly concern'd. And why, said she,
did he not at the same time instruct
her how to avoid these misfortunes?
You require too much, reply'd the
Earl, Fate will take its own Course;
and why then, continu'd she, are we
desirous to foreknow our Disgraces,
since it is not in our power to prevent
them? Reason, and a prudent Conduct,
return'd he, may stand in great stead
upon such like occasions. The Coun∣tess
said no more, but appearing ex∣treamly
disconsolate, the Earl took
his leave.</P>
<P>I came two days after to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI>
disguised like a true S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcerer, but
durst not stir out of my Chamber, for
fear of being hollow'd at by the Boys;
being not in a humour at this time to
divert the Rabble with a publick shew.
The Earl went immediately to pay a
Visit to the Countess, but would not
be the first that should speak of my
Arrival; so she staid a good while be∣fore
she ask'd him, whether he had
<PB N="204" REF="194"/>
heard any thing concerning the <HI>Lap∣lander;</HI>
he told her, he was arrived in
good Health; and that finding in him
something more surprizing, than what
he had heard before, had engaged him
to lodge in the same House where he
was. I protest to you, as a Friend,
said she, I am very desirous to see him.
Oh! Madam, reply'd he, that is impos∣sible,
'tis above 140 years since he
hates Women as much as Death it self.
You must endeavour, return'd she, to
reconcile him to our Sex; I might as
well, reply'd the Earl, go about to
learn his Art, as to perswade him to
what you would have me to do; how∣ever,
I am so ambitious of obliging you,
that I would leave nothing unattempt∣ed
for your satisfaction; and you shall
know the success to morrow. Every
moment that kept me from the sight
of the Countess, seem'd to me a year:
The Earl and I had contriv'd the matter
thus; For him to conduct her into my
Apartment, where every thing was to be
close shut up, for fear she should know
me; and the better to alter my Voice,
I was to hold something in my Mouth.
I spent the Night betwixt hope and
fear; in hopes to speak to her, and in
fear of exasperating her, and of mis∣carrying
in my Design. But there
happened another Accident, <HI>viz.</HI> her
Husband would not suffer her to go
to the Earl of <HI>A—e,</HI> and told her,
<PB N="205" REF="195"/>
that if all the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> with <HI>Lappenida</HI>
at their Head, were there, it was be∣low
the Quality of a Lord's Wife to
demean her self thus far. The next
thing we had to do, was how to find
out another Expedient for our Inter∣view;
and it was agreed she should
come at Night to a certain small Wood,
whither the Earl was to conduct me,
as her Husband was to bring her thi∣ther;
there being no great occasion of
being jealous of a Man of 200 years
old.</P>
<P>Every thing being thus agreed, I ex∣pected
the coming of the Night with
the utmost impatience, and we went
thither in the dusk of the Evening, for
fear of being seen. My Garb was a
black long Robe, I had a long white
Beard, a Turbant on my Head; and
in short, every thing suitable to what I
intended to represent in this Masque∣rade.
By chance I espy'd a crooked
Trunk of a Tree, which I chose for my
seat, the better to personate a Sorcerer;
and I neglected nothing which might
make every thing appear as natural as
could be. I was scarce well seated,
when we heard the Countess's Coach
stop at some distance from us; and the
Earl drawing nearer that way, saw her
Husband leading her by the Hand,
without hearing her speak one word.
I did not think, said he, laughing, that
when one is to consult an Astrologer,
<PB N="206" REF="196"/>
one must be debarr'd from speaking to
one's Friends; the Lady smil'd, but
without speaking one word, and so
came to me. The two Earls staying
at some distance from us, she seated
her self upon the Moss at the foot of
the same Tree, near which I had taken
my place, I found such a disturbance
within my self, that I had scarce power
to ask her, upon what account she
came to consult me. Don't you know
it, O! Divine Man, said she, without
I tell it you? And since you are already
acquainted with my Thoughts, what
need you to expect any Questions
from me? Well, Madam, reply'd I, I
must tell you then, Your Heart is
seiz'd with a most agreeable Passion;
but you have unjustly taken an Aver∣sion
to him who is your Admirer; you
have writ very severe Letters to him;
you fly him, and are come to this place
with no other intention than to avoid
the sight of him; is not this the real
Truth? Yes, said she, I must own it.
But pray give me a description of the
Person of this Gentleman; He is a tall
Man, of a goodly Presence, said I to
her; his Air is noble, and his Conver∣sation
extreamly engaging; he has a
great share in the Favour of his Ma∣ster;
and I assure you, Madam, that if
my Art does not deceive me, you are
sole Mistress of his Heart. At these
words the Lady burst out a laughing
<PB N="207" REF="197"/>
aloud; you Blockhead, cry'd she, thou
hast been bubbled into an Adventure,
and takes a great deal of Pains for no∣thing!
Know that I am not the Coun∣tess
of—, but that thou hast
talk'd to the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and
that this very moment she is a going
to make thee know who thou be'st.
You may easily guess at my surprize;
but this Disappointment did not how∣ever
affect me so much, as it would
have done, with any other Person than
her self. My dear Sister, said I, stop∣ping
her against her Will, and reas∣suming
my natural Voice, take heed
not to disclose this Secret, but rather
assist me in this Design; I conjure
you, since by what I have done, you
may be convinced I love her heartily.
The Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI> embracing
me with much Tenderness, you are a
true <HI>Protheus,</HI> said she, and 'tis well
you discovered your self, for I should
certainly have spoil'd your Market.</P>
<P>She then told me, that at the earn∣est
Intreaties of her Friends to go to
<HI>Tunbridge,</HI> she had at last resolv'd all
on a sudden to go thither; that she
happen'd just to come to the Coun∣tess's
Lodgings about an hour before
this Nocturnal Appointment; and that
hearing them talk strange things of a
<HI>Laplander,</HI> it came into her head, that
something of a Design lay conceal'd
under the Pretences of his great Age,
<PB N="208" REF="198"/>
and excellency of his Art. To make
tryal of his Skill, she had offer'd to go
instead of the Countess, and had found
my Genius so far removed from its na∣tural
Course, as to suffer it self thus to
be catch'd in the Trap. I told her I
was but a Novice in the Conjuring
Art, but desir'd her to go back to the
Countess, and to relate Wonders of
me; she fail'd not to do according to
my desire, and acted her part to a mi∣racle;
for the Earl happening to find
the Countess in her Coach, whilst he
thought she had been with me, did not
doubt but that I should betray my self;
and was upon the point of coming back
to tell me what he had seen; when she
told him it was the Dutchess of <HI>Rich∣mond,</HI>
that was with me, he then flat∣ter'd
himself, I would certainly know
her; and whilst he was expecting her
return with as much impatience as un∣easiness,
he saw her coming towards
the Coac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, O! cry'd she, with a loud
Voice, the most skilful of Men, and the
happiest of Mortals upon Earth; what
surprizing things has not told me;
his Knowledge is pass'd expressing. She
would have run on in my praise, if the
Countess, impatient to see me, had not
left her, and made all the hast she
could towards the Tree near which I
had seated my self. I was scarce reco∣ver'd
out of my Surprize, and fearing
lest they should play me the same
<PB N="207" REF="199"/>
Game over again, I was resolved, to
be first well assured of the Person I
spoke to, before I proceeded to disco∣ver
my Art.</P>
<P>Scarce had the Countess taken
her Place next to mine, but she told
me, Most divine <HI>Lapponida,</HI> if by
your Art you are able to pene∣trate
into the Secrets of my Heart,
and find out a way of easing my
Pain, nothing shall be so great,
but what you may expect from my
Graritude; Knowing this to be the
Countess's Voice, I took her by the
Hand; and, Madam, said I, I am not
a Man to be guided by Interest, you
did not pitch upon the right Method,
when you intended to engage me in
your behalf, by the Promises of Re∣wards
which I never coveted; the
only thing I have to desire of you is,
to put somewhat of Confidence in
me. Which way, said she, can I re∣fuse
it to you, who can foretel every
thing, and know in spite of my self,
what I would fain keep conceal'd.
You reason to a Miracle, reply'd I,
you are endow'd with so exquisite a
Wit, that I am not surprised at the
favourable Aspects and Influences of
the Stars upon you. <HI>Venus,</HI> in Con∣junction
with <HI>Sol,</HI> gives you both Pru∣dence
and Beauty. <HI>Jupiter</HI> in a direct
<PB N="208" REF="200"/>
Line with <HI>Mars; L</HI>—Pray speak
to me in an intelligible Language,
said she, and let me know, what
made a certain Man, for whom I had
a great Kindness, cease to love me.
Your surprise is very wrong, said I,
he loves you still, and never loved
any body else; he languishes for you,
he is ready to die for Vexation, when
he reflects upon what Aversion you
have conceived against him. Since
you are so dexterous at knowing his
Sentiments, I wonder you should not
discover in me a Disposition quite con∣trary
to what you speak of: But I am
certain, that during a Voyage he made
lately, this ungrateful Man bestow'd
my Picture upon a Woman, who never
will love him the with same Tender∣ness
as I have done.</P>
<P>I can assure you, said the Duke,
that I found in this Conversation, all
the Pleasures one is capable of feeling
in the hight of a nice and most tender
Passion; and as I had no reason to ima∣gine,
that the Countess would have
at this time a design of imposing upon
me, since passing for a <HI>Laplander,</HI> and
a Person not in the least concerned in
her Affairs, it was equal to me whe∣ther
she loved or hated her Lover; so
I read it in her Heart, and plainly
perceived, that I was still very dear to
her, beyond what I could have expect∣ed
<PB N="209" REF="201"/>
at this time. I being very desi∣rous
to know that charitable Person,
who had been pleas'd to do me this
good Office, told the Countess, she
must put an entire Confidence in me,
and that I pray'd her to tell me, how
she came to know that her Lover had
proved unfaithful. I was acquainted
with it, said she, by one of my
Friends, unto whom it was written by a
Person of Quality; you must describe
his Person to me, said I, if you expect
I should foretel you the real Conse∣quences
thereof. By the Description
she gave me, and the Suspicion I had
conceived before of Madam—
and my Lord—, I was easily
convinced I had not guess'd amiss,
My Art tells me, continued I, that
those Persons you speak of ought to
be suspected to you, it being their
Design to disturb your Repose. Alas!
said she, with a most charming Voice,
if their Design was to put me to an
excess of Pain, they have had their
ends. I can assure you, my Eyes have
seen no Sleep since that unhappy
Day this Lady brought me this dis∣agreeable
Tydings. There is a great∣er
Share of Vanity than of Tender∣ness
in your Sufferings, said I, you
are vex'd at this Gentleman's having
preferr'd another before you. I could
wish it were no otherwise, reply'd
<PB N="210" REF="202"/>
she, this would not be quite so mor∣tifying
to me, since perhaps I might
find out some way or other to com∣fort
my self for such a Disgrace; but
the nearer I examine my Heart, the
more I am sensible of its Frailties.</P>
<P>It was no longer in my Power to
stand out against these Assurances,
which served for an undeniable Con∣firmation
to me of my Happiness. I
arose from my crooked piece of Wood,
with much Precipitation, and casting
my self at her Feet, Pray don't dis∣own
me, Madam, said I, embracing
her Knees, I am the most tender and
faithful Lover in the World; I should
die for Grief upon this very Spot, had
I been guilty of ceasing to love you
but for a moment, beyond my own
Life. Your Picture, which I have a∣bout
me, ought to convince you of
those Forgeries they have imposed
upon you. In the name of your
Friendship, in the name of the most
tender Passion that ever was known,
restore me to your Favours, restore
to me that, without which I can't
live any longer. I was upon the point
of telling her a thousand more tender
and passionate things, during these
first Motions of Joy, Love, and Ac∣knowledgment:
But can you guess,
without setting up for a <HI>Laplander,</HI>
can you guess, I say, what Answer
<PB N="211" REF="203"/>
this capricious Woman made me to
all these passionate Expressions? How
my Lord, cry'd she, is it you my
Lord, who under this premeditated
Disguise come to snatch this Secret
from me? Do you think thus to
abuse my Inclinations for Astrologi∣cal
Predictions? And you judge you
have sufficiently cleared your self,
when you swear, I have been mis∣guided
by Falshoods. Oh, my Lord,
how far you have deceived your self,
in chusing such Methods as are direct∣ly
opposite to what you owe to me.
You ought to have born your Suffe∣rings
without murmuring, and with∣out
breaking forth into Complaints;
you ought to have expected from my
Goodness, to be recall'd out of this
kind of Banishment, but in lieu
thereof you must go and take a Con∣fident;
and tho' I look upon the Earl
of <HI>A—e</HI> as a Man of Honour,
yet I am almost reduced to Despair,
he should be acquainted with this Af∣fai.
You must needs also discover
your self to the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond,</HI>
and in short, you have exposed me to
the worst of Accidents, for should
my Husband get the least notice of
this Adventure, he would without
any regard to my Innocence, and
your M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lice, sacrifice me me alone to
his Resenrment. All these Reasons
<PB N="212" REF="204"/>
represent you before my Eyes, as
an Object altogether unworthy of my
Tenderness, which you have thus
abused, and been wanting in every
thing you owe to me; nay, you
have had Cruelty enough, to hazard
my Life.</P>
<P>Whilst she was making this so
sine, so well disposed, and so well
contrived Harangue, I stood confoun∣ded
at what I heard her say now,
and what she spoke but a moment
before. Is it possible, said I, that
the same Mouth should in so short
a time, utter opposite matters? Is
this the same Woman who sighed
before <HI>Laponida</HI> for having lost the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and now treats
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> like a mi∣serable
Wretch, whilst he is lying
at her Feet. I must own, that at
that very Instant, Spite and Anger
so far prevail'd over my Heart,
that for sometime I could not say one
Word; she had scarce finish'd part of
her Discourse, when I added such a
Conclusion, as she little expected
from me. For, in lieu of attempt∣ing
to allay her Anger by Submis∣sion,
I cry'd, O you most unstable
and most extravagant of Woman∣kind!
I leave you for the whole Re∣mainder
of my Days; you shall,
whilst you live, never hear either
<PB N="213" REF="205"/>
good or bad Tydings from me; I re∣pent
of the Pains I have taken to
come near you, but am ready to
leave you immediately, and will for
ever shun you to the utmost of my
Power. I had no sooner said these
Words, but away I flew from her
like Lightning, and tho', as it seem'd
to me, she follow'd me, and cry'd,
<HI>Laponida, Laponida,</HI> I was in so ill
an Humour, that I did not think
her worthy of an Answer. She was
no sooner gone back to the Place,
where the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond,</HI> her
Husband, and the Earl, staid for her
coming; but the last came to find
me near the Tree, but it being a
dark Night, could not find me,
and looking about for fear I had
lost my self in the Wood, whilst I
expected his coming in my Coach,
much dissatisfy'd at his long stay, I
saw him come at last. He upbraid∣ed
me with having given him so
much Trouble, but I being then in
a very scurvy Humour, answered
him so abruptly, tho' I was actual∣ly
in the wrong, that he thought fit
not to return any further Answer.</P>
<P>Our dispute being soon ended,
what do you think, said I, of
this long Conversation I had with
the Countess? Every thing that can
be thought happy, said he; to be
<PB N="214" REF="206"/>
alone in a Wood with a Lady one
loves, and by whom one is belov'd?
To be consider'd under such Circum∣stances
of a Reconciliation; <HI>viz.</HI> that
the Husband is jealous, and at the
same time stands Sentinel? To be
witty and both lovely? Now you
may judge of my Thoughts. O!
said I, sighing, Appearances often
prove fallacious: You think I have
made my Peace with her, because
one would suppose it to be so; but
I had to do with so capricious a
Woman, and who gave me so ill a
Reception, that I have quite broke
off with her. The Earl could scarce
believe me, till I spoke so seriously,
that he could not but take my
word for it, especially, since there
was not sufficient matter of Diver∣sion
in the thing, to put one upon
an Invention of this Nature. I pro∣test
to you, said he, I am amazed
to the highest degree: I thought
your Merits might have secured
you against such an Accident: No
more of Merits, my Lord, said I,
I will do my self Justice, and own
my Faults, some whereof are perhaps
very con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iderable; but I will not
allow any in Love. Do you know
a sure way how to be revenged of
her, said the Earl; Yes, reply'd I,
to forget her for ever: 'Twas that
<PB N="215" REF="207"/>
I intended to have advised you to,
added he, but you were too quick
for me? You shall see, said I, smiling,
that, if my Astrologers Habit was
not well suited for the reviving of
an Intreague, it shall serve to break
it off.</P>
<P>I would advise you, reply'd he, to
visit the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond,</HI> who
lodging in the same House with the
Countess, you may confer with her,
and endeavour a Reconcliation. Hea∣vens
prevent me, cry'd I, I will leave
the Place so soon as it is Day; You
may do what you please, said he, but
what will the King think of your sud∣den
Return; I will find an Excuse
for it, said I to him, and let it fall out
as it will, he will look upon it as a
piece of Gallantry. It seems to me
more proper, said he, to go to one of
your Country Seats, and to stay there
for Fourteen Days, without being
known at Court. Since you are en∣clined,
reply'd I, to take your Share
in my ill Humour and Solitariness,
rather then return to <HI>London,</HI> come
let us go to <HI>Clevedon.</HI> He promis'd
very obligingly to go along with
me thither, to my no small Satis∣faction;
for I stood highly in need
of a good Companion to assist me in
tearing from my Heart the remaining
<HI>Ideas</HI> of the Countess, and nothing can
<PB N="216" REF="208"/>
happen more unfortunate to a Man
oppress'd with a violent Passion, which
affords him sufficient matter of Com∣plaint,
thus to want a Friend, unto
whom he may discharge his Heart to
ease his Pains.</P>
<P>So soon as we returned to <HI>Tun∣bridge,</HI>
I threw my self upon the Bed,
being quite spent with Vexation; I
had not lain there long, when I
heard them cry out, <HI>Fire, Fire;</HI> and
thinking it might perhaps, be at the
Countess's, because her House was
not far distant from ours, I arose,
and looking out of the Window,
ask'd several Persons that pass'd by
in great haste, where the Fire was.
It being already pretty light, they
look'd upon me; but instead of an∣swering
me, burst out a lauging. I
could not imagine the meaning of
it, nor why they should not an∣swer
me, not remembring that it
was my Antcik Habit, which I had
still upon me, made them laugh at
its Novelty. I was extreamly vex'd
at this Usage, when the Earl of
<HI>Argyle,</HI> entring abruptly into the
Room; You are very quiet, said he,
considering the Fire is ready to
break in upon you. What, said I,
Is this House on Fire? 'Tis so much,
said he, that we must either save
our selves out of the Window, or
<PB N="217" REF="209"/>
else run the hazard of being burnt
in going down Stairs. They brought
us a Ladder, and the Earl being the
first that got down, run into the
Stable, to give orders for the Horses
to be brought out, they being ready
to be stifled by the Smoak. I for
my part did not question, but that
I might make use of the same Lad∣der,
to get down into the Court,
but it being divulged by the Fel∣lows
belonging to the Stables, that
I was a famous Sorcerer, some of
the Mob took away the Ladder, in
hopes to see me shew one of my
Master-pieces, to fly into the Air
like a Bird; and at the same time
others coming with a Ladder to
my assistance, they would not suf∣fer
it to be fixt to the Window,
alledging that I being a Sorcerer, I
deserved to be burnt alive.</P>
<P>I must confess, I never was put
more to it in all my Life-time;
the Smoak was so thick in my Cham∣ber,
that I was almost suffocated by
it, and not being able to cry for
help, I knew not what to do. It
very luckily came into my mind,
that it was my white Beard, and
my Conjurer's Cloaths, that had
drawn me into this mischief, so I
threw them off; and having just
so much Breath left as to cry out
<PB N="218" REF="210"/>
of the Window, save the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham;</HI> they knew me, brought
a Ladder, and I got down with ease.
The sudden change from the Smoak
into the Air, threw me into a
Swoon; which being told to the
Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> he came to my assist∣ance,
and supporting me, till I came
to the Bank of a Rivulet, I sat
down upon the Grass, leaning a∣gainst
a Tree. I am much concern'd,
said I, to find my self still here,
pray give the necessary Orders for
our immediate departure. Don't
you fear, said he, lest you should
not be able to bear riding in the
Coach; I dread more some sinister
Accident, of seeing again the Coun∣tess,
being resolv'd, after what she
has done, never to forgive her. He
fell a laughing, and that is to say,
continu'd he, to see her, and to
forgive her, is one and the same
thing; that is to say, reply'd I,
that I am sensible of my Frailty
for her, and that I would rather
chuse to avoid her, than put such a
constraint upon my Inclinations.</P>
<P>Is it not true, my Lord, con∣tinu'd
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> that,
how easily Chance might bring the
Countess among these Trees, at∣tended
only by her Confident, to
take the Benefit and Pleasure of
<PB N="219" REF="211"/>
the fresh Air, and of a murmuring
Brook; and perhaps also to ease
her Mind by sighing, and uttering
bitter Reproaches and Complaints
against me. And supposing I lye
here so far conceal'd, as not to be
discovered by her; I should perhaps
arise on a sudden, throw my self at
her Feet, embrace her, and sue for
Peace. As I tell you ingenuously my
true Sentiments, so there seems no∣thing
wanting to accomplish this
Adventure, but her Presence; But
Accidents don't depend on our
choice; the Countess did not ap∣pear,
tho' to confess the Truth with
all sincerity, I should have been
over-joy'd if good Chance, and the
Intelligencies of Love, would have
brought her to this place. I went
strait to <HI>Clevedom,</HI> in Company with
the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who gave me
all possible assistance to allay my
Grief. He shew'd so much complai∣sance
for me, as to hear with a great
deal of patience, every thing I told
him; and his answers were so full of
Goodness, as to prove a singular
Comfort to my present Afflictions.
But since we talk of Complaisance,
said the Duke, I find, tho' somewhat
late, I have abused your Patience, it
being broad day; and I can't imagine
what made me run on thus for so
<PB N="220" REF="212"/>
long a time. O! good my Lord,
cry'd the Earl of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> don't
check your self, for having spent a
few hours with us, and don't think
of leaving us, till you have given us
the whole Conclusion of this Adven∣ture.
'Twill be much more proper,
said the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> to let him
take a little Rest, and for us to do
the same, that we may be in a con∣dition
to hear him, with the more
Attention afterwards. The Earl of
St. <HI>Albans</HI> very well liked this Propo∣sal;
this House being one of the
finest in <HI>London,</HI> he ordered a nice
Collation to be brought in for Break∣fast,
which being over, the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> and his Nephew were
each conducted into a magnificent
Chamber to take their Repose, which
they took till towards Evening:
They were then entertained with a
very fine Supper; but as Lovers,
when they are at Variance with their
Mistresses, seldom have any great
stomach to their Victuals, so it hap∣pened
with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
and the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> at this time.
The Duke seeing his two Friends to
keep silence, on purpose to attend
to his Relation; Began thus:</P>

<P>THE Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> made more
sensible Reflexions upon my true
Interests than I was capable
of doing my self; being so far prepossess'd,
with Love and Vexation, that I could think
but little of the Court. <HI>White-Hall</HI> being
as strange to me, as if I had never been in
it. Is it possible, said he, D. of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
you can imagine, not to give an account to
the King of your stay at <HI>Clevedone?</HI> Is it
not all one to him, said I, whether I am
here or at <HI>Tunbridge?</HI> No, reply'd he, the
King loving you to such a degree as he
does, and consequently being much concer∣ned
for your Helath, you ought to let him
know, that the Air of your Country Seat
is more proper for you than the <HI>Waters.</HI>
And why so, reply'd I, the King will sup∣pose
me to be at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> till I return to
Court, when I intend to tell him, that I am
come from <HI>Clevedone.</HI> You don't consider,
<PB N="354" REF="215"/>
said he, that you will be enquired after▪ from
those that return from the <HI>Wells;</HI> and will
not every body be surprized, when they are
told, you have not been seen there? It will
be supposed, said I, I had a mind to live
retired. But, added he, all the Company
meets at the <HI>Wells,</HI> and tho' you may a∣void
speaking, you can't avoid being seen.
And was not I seen, reply'd I, in that cursed
Walk where you left me? Those that saw
you there, answered he, were not Persons
of that Quality, to have any Questions
ask'd them concerning you. And for my
part, said I, in an angry tone, I shall re∣solve
them none, I beg your pardon, <HI>My
Lord.</HI></P>
<P>He was so far from taking notice of my
Spleen, that he burst out a laughing, and said
he hop'd I would not take it ill, if he
wrote to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> to let him
know where he was. No, said I, with a more
gay Countenance, you can't do any thing that
will displease me; but I must beg one Fa∣vour
of you, <HI>viz.</HI> not to let me know one
Word of his Answer to yours. You will be
the greatest Loser betwixt us, said he smi∣ling,
for perhaps he may write me some
pleasant things, which you would be glad
to hear, and which may divert you from
that splenetick Humour you seem to court
so much now. It matters not, reply'd I,
I am so very well pleased with my present
<HI>Men hating</HI> Humour, that I must think
my self mad if I should change it for any
other: I am resolved to hate all the World,
<PB N="355" REF="216"/>
except you. <HI>My Lord,</HI> said he, this Ex∣ception
being so advantagious to me, I can't
but be highly sensible of it: but 'tis impos∣sible
you should persist in a Resoluti∣on
which would debar you the Conver∣sation
of so many Persons of Honour
that love you. This Resolution, reply'd I,
will rob me only of the Conversation of a
few; for as times now go, 'tis enough to
act the Hypocrite, our Inclinations having
little or no Share in our Conversation; he
who has the most regard to Honour and
Affection, being sure to be the Bub∣ble.
The Earl being of a contrary Opi∣nion,
which he always maintain'd with a
grear deal of Wit, this caused several very
diverting Discourses betwixt us.</P>
<P>All this while I continued in my splene∣tick
Humour, being vex'd at my self for
having incensed the Countess afresh. Alas!
said I to my self, I ought to have submitted
to what she told me, during the first Mo∣tions
of her Heart, whereof perhaps she her
self was not Mistress at that time: What
did I go to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> for, but to appease
her? And thus I have willfully rendered
my whole Journey fruitless. I resolved to
write to her, but some of my Letters not
seeming to me tender and submissive e∣nough,
and sometimes thinking my self not
so much in the wrong, I liked none of
them, and so laid them up in my Scru∣tore.
I concluded, that in order to cure me
of my Love, I must find some other Amuse∣ment,
<PB N="356" REF="217"/>
which might divert my Heart and
Thoughts another way.</P>
<P>There is no other Method, said I, to the
Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> to get rid of these fatal
Chains, which, as long as I wear, will scarce
afford me one day's Tranquillity: She is
sufficiently disposed to form my Process;
I need only tell her, that I love else∣where,
and she will not fail to believe
it; for she is already jealous without Rea∣son,
and condemns me without being heard:
No, I am resolved I will love her no longer.</P>
<P>But, continued I, what if I should have
the same Fate with another, who may
perhaps play the Tyrant, 'tis much better
not to love at all, but to enjoy the Ease of
a <HI>happy Indifferency.</HI> Alas, <HI>My Lord,</HI> cry'd
the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> this is a Task which
will prove more difficult to you, than to o∣thers:
After having tasted the Pleasures of
Love, during your Engagements with the
Countess of S—you can't live without
Loving. 'Tis true, reply'd I, sighing at the
pleasing Ideas, that dear Name revived in
my Mind, I was the happiest of Lovers, but
it is also no less true, that after such ex∣ceeding
Delights, I could not but expect
some mixture of bitterness in my next Pas∣sion:
And the Countess of—has suf∣ficiently
punish'd me for having loved any
body but Madam S—</P>
<P>You will highly oblige me, said the E. of
<HI>Argyle,</HI> in relating to me the Particulars of
that Intreague. Alas! said I, that is a Wound
not to be touch'd without a most violent
<PB N="357" REF="218"/>
Pain: not that I would deny your Request,
but only defer the Rehearsal thereof, till I
may do it with less Disturbance. The Earl,
who aim'd at nothing more than to
amuse me, would not insist further upon a
Matter which he found disagreeable to my
present Disposition, but in the most oblig∣ing
manner in the World, submitted to all
my capricious Humours.</P>
<P>One Day, walking along the River side,
saw him at a distance, sitting upon a
Hillock, reading a Letter very attentive∣ly.
I approach'd as easie as I could, but
coming near him, he folded up the Let∣ter,
and without speaking one word, put it
into his Pocket: I was a little nettled at
it, yet for some time talk'd only of indiffe∣rent
Matters, till at last I ask'd him whether
he had any News from <HI>London?</HI> Yes, re∣ply'd
he, The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> has gi∣ven
me an account of what passes at Court.
Are they Matters of Consequence, said I?
Had they been such, reply'd he, you should
have known it before this; but they being
only Matters of Gallantry, are not suitable
to your present Condition. His Answer ha∣ving
raised in me a Curiosity to know what
pass'd: I told him, 'tis true, I had resolved
to deny my self all those Amusements that
infect the Heart and Mind, and which dis∣turb
the Repose of our Lives; nevertheless
as I find my self never the better for not
hearing of these Matters, you will oblige
me in communicating the Contents of
your Letter to me. Done, said the Earl,
<PB N="358" REF="219"/>
giving me the Letter, you will meet with
something that is new there. The Letter I
read ran thus: <HI>You are much in the wrong to
pass your time at</HI> Clevedom, <HI>whilst we have
here a growing Beauty, admired by all that
see her. I won't tell you who she is, to raise
your Curiosity to the highest pitch: but know
that she is beloved by all the World; that the
E. of</HI> S. Albans <HI>adores her; that the E. of</HI>
O—<HI>sighs for her; and that she has made
so general a Conquest of Hearts, that there
are none left for our Ladies. If you are ca∣pable
of pity, prepare your selves to afford
them some Comfort: But you will scarce be
long in a condition to pity others; for so soon
as you have beheld</HI> Donna Maria de Bal∣boza,
<HI>you will have work enough to commi∣serate
your own Case. Alas! what have I
done? I have nam'd her to you! You must
know then, that the Queen has sent for her
out of</HI> Portugal, <HI>to attend her, and be one of
her Ladies of Honour, notwithstanding the
opposition of many at Court. Adieu,</HI> My
Lord, <HI>I reckon you and the Duke of</HI> Buck∣ingham
<HI>will say I seldom bring any pleasing
News.</HI></P>
<P>I expected no less, said the Earl of
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> interrupting the Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham,</HI>
than to be brought in among the
Lovers of <HI>Donna Maria,</HI> but am in a capacity
at present to hear her mentioned without
Disturbance. If it be so, reply'd the Duke,
I will proceed.</P>
<P>After having read the D. of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
Letter, I told the E. of <HI>Argyle: Could you
<PB N="359" REF="220"/>
be in Love with this Stranger?</HI> He return'd,
<HI>and could not you be in Love with this
Stranger?</HI> I wish I could, reply'd I, for
this would be a means to cure my Passion
for the Countess. As to my self, said
he, having no such Distemper, I don't care
to venture upon so hazardous a Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: I
am not fond of Trouble, and therefore pre∣fer
a happy Indifference before all the Plea∣sures
of Love. Hah, <HI>My Lord,</HI> cry'd I,
I don't believe you to have so ill a Relish.
And I believe, reply'd he smiling, you cer∣tainly
have: pray call to mind the Suffer∣ings
and Vexations, even of the happiest of
Lovers, the capricious Humours of our
Mistresses, Jealousies and Slights: don't
you remember that the unfortunate hours
doe much over-ballance the happy ones;
so that if Men, when they begin to love,
were but sensible of the Disappointments,
and other Vexations, which are inseparable
Companions of Love Intreagues, they
would shun it like Death it self. Does the
E. of <HI>Argyle,</HI> cry'd I, talk at that rate,
and must the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> betray
his Frailty in opposing his Sentiments.
Notwithstanding the ill Treatment I have
received from the Countess, and the Re∣pulses
from a capricious Woman of an un∣equal
Rank to me, I say it is convenient to
love. Yes, yes, said I, after having paused a
while, I will maintain it to be so. An in∣different
Person is never sensible of true
Pleasure: 'tis Love that makes us out∣brave
our Misfortunes, because it inspires
<PB N="360" REF="221"/>
us with noble and great Sentiments; it
creates in us an Emulation, and makes
us surmount all Difficulties.</P>
<P>I am charm'd, said the E. of <HI>Argyle,</HI> to hear
you speak at that rate, your Reconciliation
with the Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess is certainly at hand; I
don't question but to see you in a few Days
languishing at her Feet, and her of a more
pliable Temper. No, no, cry'd I, you
will never see that; but if this Lady <HI>Bal∣boza</HI>
is as lovely as the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI>
makes her in his Letter, I must con∣fess,
I could be heartily glad to enter into
an amorous Intreague with her. The <HI>Por∣tugueze</HI>
Ladies have naturally a great deal
of Wit and Sprightliness, they are Mistresses
of a certain Vivacity, which keeps a Lover
from turning indifferent; they never are
without something that is new: whether
pleased or angry, there is an infinite di∣version
in their Conversation: To speak
frankly, the more I think of her, the
more I am resolved to Love her.</P>
<P>But, said the E. of <HI>Argyle,</HI> supposing
her to have given a favourable Ear to the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> or to the E. of S. <HI>Al∣bans,</HI>
will you go about to dislodge them?
And will it not be much better to put on
again your former Chains? My Rivals,
cry'd I, (with a sort of a scornful Air)
have always given to me the Honour
of Precedency; the only thing I fear,
is that perhaps she may not be of a
very amorous Disposition. A pleasant whim
indeed, said he, you are afraid that the
<PB N="361" REF="222"/>
Person you propose to Love, has not made
any great impression upon her Lovers? If
I were sensible of it by my self, reply'd I,
I needed not labour under that Uneasiness,
because I should be a Judge of her Merits
and Charms; but as the case now stands, I
can only suppose her lovely, as far as she
is belov'd. Your Rule, answered the Earl,
is not without Exception; we some∣times
engage in such odd Intreagues, as
would appear unpardonable, were it not for
that common excuse <HI>Love is Blind.</HI> After all,
said I, I hope you will agree with me in
this, that a young Lady who is admired
by many, may challenge the Preference be∣fore
one that has no Admirers at all? At
this he could not forbear laughing; and,
said he, you are then in Love, when must
we meet at <HI>White-Hall?</HI> To morrow, said
I, tho' perhaps I may find my self mistaken
in several of these Perfections, I propose
to my self; for, notwithstanding, as she
is a <HI>Portugueze,</HI> she ought to have Wit,
she may perhaps have none; besides this, I
would have her Eyes large and black, and so
full of Lustre, as scarce to be endured by her
Admirers; Teeth as bright as Pearls, her
Bosom and Complexion white, or in carna∣tion
Colour, and of Stature tall, and nicely
shaped. You are mistaken, said he, for I
am certain, that among a thousand <HI>Portu∣guezes,</HI>
you won't meet with one such as
you describe her, unless you bespeak her
on purpose.</P>

How, reply'd I, have they not generally
large Eyes? Yes, said he, many of them
have; but as for their Teeth, you must not
expect them of an Oriental Pearl Colour;
for their using abundance of Chocolat
and Sweet-meats, spoils their Teeth in
their Infancy. As for their Complexio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, you
may have it white enough if you love
Painting, but without it, I will warrant it
brown. After all, said I, I would
rather have it so, than if it were besme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d
with Plaister work. They are, said the
Earl, neither tall nor plump, all <HI>Portu∣gueze</HI>
Women being small and lean. What,
cry'd I, without Exception, surely they
don't cast them all in one Mould? I only
tell you my Opinion, continued he smil∣ing,
and if you will write and be satisfy'd
in the Matter, we shall see whether you
or I have guess'd best. Truly, reply'd I
with a Smile, methinks you are very bold to
make such a Comparison; don't you remem∣ber
that I acted the Sorcerer not long ago?
I am so far from having forgotten it, said
he, that I often remember it, but never
without being ready to die with laughing;
your disguise was so pleasantly contrived,
that had it not been for that Love Passion
that had seized your Heart, you would
have made much better Sport.</P>
<P>I writ a Letter to my <HI>Dutch Picture Dra∣wer,</HI>
with orders to endeavour to draw the
Picture of <HI>Donna Maria Balboza,</HI> and to
send it to me. I shew'd this Letter to the
Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who told me with a plea∣sant
<PB N="363" REF="224"/>
Air; it is an ancient Custom among
Kings and Princes, to have the Pictures of
the Princesses they intend to espouse, sent
to them; but yours is a peculiar Fancy to
send for the Picture of a Person, you only
propose to love. Divert your self at my
cost, return'd I, as long as you please, I
will take it all, provided you will write
to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and desire him
to let you know, whether she has Wit, and
is agreeable in Conversation; whether she
is strait Limb'd, and writes well; for I
confess, I am ready to engage with her if
his Answer proves suitable to my Desires.</P>
<P>Alas, reply'd he, what Confidence can
you put in his Answer, his Passion for her
must needs be look'd upon as partial. I a∣gree
with you in this point, said I; but I
would have him send us some of her Let∣ters;
for she that writes well, can't want
Wit. Since there are many that don't want
Wit, reply'd the Earl, and yet write very
ill, why may not a Person write well, and
yet have no Wit? No, said I, that is im∣possible;
you may tell me of some People,
that Talk well, and yet Write ill; and of
some who Write well, but Talk ill; but
both Sorts don't want Wit, and if I could
see one of her Letters I would be satisfy'd.</P>
<P>And do you imagine, said he, that if the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> has any of her Letters,
he will trust them with us? Why not, re∣ply'd
I, as we are his Friends; I am con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ident
he will be well pleased to see us ad∣mire
a Lady he thinks so lovely himself.
<PB N="364" REF="225"/>
Then write you your self, said the Earl,
'tis possible, that he being always ready to
serve you, this will make him less scrupu∣lous
upon this Head.</P>
<P>We return'd not to <HI>Clevedone</HI> till it was
pretty late, which made me urge the Earl
to go to Supper, before he writ the Let∣ter▪
but he perceiving I would be very
well pleased if he did otherwise, went into
my Closet, and in a few Moments after, gave
me his Letter to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI>
which I sent with as much Care, as if all
the Felicity of my Life had depended on
it. The next Day in the Evening, the
Messenger I had sent to <HI>London,</HI> returned
from <HI>London</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
Answer to the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> conceived in
the following Words.</P>
<P>'TIS not without great reason the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham</HI> is so desirous of see∣ing
some of the fair <HI>Portugeze</HI>'s Letters;
for she writes as well as she speaks, and she
speaks beyond any body Living. 'Tis a mis∣fortune
that she will write only of indiffe∣rent
Matters, at least I have seen no others
as yet, tho' I have done all I could, to en∣gage
her to alter her Stile. Her Eyes have
told me more than once, that she would re∣present
Love to admiration, but she is so
very cautious to engage her self that way,
that either she has been told strange Stories
of Love, or else has met with some Disap∣pointments,
I have not been able to learn,
as yet. I sent you what she writ yesterday
<PB N="365" REF="226"/>
at the Countess of <HI>O—</HI> where Mrs.
<HI>Bevrewell</HI> happening to shew a Letter from
Mr. <HI>S. Evremont,</HI> every one gave his Opi∣nion
upon it; the Letter meeting with great
Commendation from the most judicious, but
with some reproof from the Ignorant Criticks,
this raised a Dispute concerning the diffe∣rent
ways of Writing, wherein <HI>Donna Maria</HI>
out doing all the rest, her Discourse was so
pleasing to me, that I engaged her to leave
some part of it in Writing, which I send
and leave to your judgment.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> having look'd
for some time among his Papers, at last
found and produced the following Advice,
how to Write well.</P>
<P>[1] I lay this down for a general
Rule, that in all, but especially in what
we call the Epistolar Stile, always a due
Regard ought to be had to good and true
Sense, and never to deviate from it. Write
as you speak, and endeavour to give things
a certain noble, but easie Turn, without Af∣fectation
or pompous Words, which makes
a deep Impression, and is infinitely pleasing.
As far as is possible avoid Repetitions;
but if that cannot be done, and they fall
in naturally, you may make use of them,
without any further Scruple.</P>
<P>[2] Tho' the <HI>Portugueze, Spaniards,</HI>
and <HI>Italians,</HI> are very fond of Metaphors,
(the chief Ornaments of their Letters,)
they are not according to my Palate; it
being my Opinion, that we need not dis∣place
<PB N="366" REF="227"/>
the Sun and Stars, no more than to
condescend to a mean and pedantique Stile.
The finest and nicest things are best ex∣prest
in an easie and natural way, without
putting our Wit to the Rack.</P>
<P>[3] You must have a due Regard to
your own Quality, as well as to that of
the Person unto whom you write, and to
the Subject you are to entertain him with.
As to the last, keep as close to it, as pos∣sibly
you can; and in respect to the first,
make an exact Distinction, as well in re∣ference
to his Birth, as to his Merits; but
you must always express your Honourable
Sentiments, and even your good Will to
every body, and make use of such Expres∣sions
as may discover your noble Inclina∣tions
to them.</P>
<P>[4] If you write about Business, ex∣press
your self in concise but plain Terms,
without leaving the least room for Am∣biguity
or double Interpretation.</P>
<P>[5] You may easily avoid long Phrases,
fulsom Periods, and such Parentheses, as
interrupt the whole sense of a Letter. It
happens often, that you must be oblig'd to
read a Letter more than once, before you
can attain to the true Sense thereof.</P>
<P>[6] All manner of <HI>Galimatias</HI> or
Bombast must never enter into an Epistle;
this will prove no difficult task for such as
are not in a Capacity to make high
Flights, which when they attempt, they
are often lost among the Clouds, and fall
very low afterwards. Every one ought to
<PB N="367" REF="228"/>
examine his own Capacity, and to be
cautious not to say more than what he
would have, and in so doing, he will sel∣dom
fail of saying as much as is requisite
for his purpose.</P>
<P>[7] There are certain Expressions, so
nice and refined, as to leave behind them
an Eagerness in the Reader, of guessing
more than is express'd in the Letter. A
Person of Wit ought not to be too lavishing
in this kind; tho' this is a point, not to
be managed by every body with Discretion;
for, if a good number of pleasant Fancies
crowd in upon us, we are so fond of them,
as not to pass by any without inserting
them. But your Friend to whom you
write will be much better pleased with
you, if you don't spend your fewel all at
once, and will look upon your Letter as
more acceptable, if you leave him room
of exerting his Thoughts and Fancies upon
it himself. You ought always to have
more Regard to your Friend's satisfaction,
than to your own.</P>
<P>[8] If you are to enter upon Compli∣ments,
let them be graceful and short, and
endeavour to give them an uncommon and
handsome Turn, beyond what is usually
observed in the ordinary way of Compli∣menting.</P>
<P>[9] Consolatory Letters must never
be long, but Affectionate, and touching
home upon the Subject; so as to make
your self a sharer in your Friends Mis∣fortune,
without Affectation or Pride, and
<PB N="368" REF="229"/>
without hard and far-fetch'd Expressions.
You may also add some Christian-like Re∣flexions,
provided they savour neither of
Pedantry nor Bigottry.</P>
<P>[10] If we are to bestow a Favour, it
ought to be done with a prompt and
generous Compliance. A long expect
Obligation loses much of its true Value,
and in cases of this nature, never be negli∣gent
in writing.</P>
<P>[11] If you are under a necessity of
refusing a Favour, you ought to sweeten
your Refusal by all the kind Expressions
you are able, and by giving some hopes
of obliging your Friend for the future.</P>
<P>[12] In case you are to write a chiding
Letter, don't correct your Friend in haugh∣ty
and cholerick Terms; but in such as
are full of Goodness, and founded upon
Justice. He that has committed a Fault, is
sufficiently punish'd already, without the
addition of bitter and inveighing Words,
which will appear to be rather the effects
of your Passion, than of your Reason.</P>
<P>[13] If you will write to the Person
you love, only consult your own Heart,
that knows best how to speak in your be∣half,
and will sometimes say more than it
ought. Men are not ty'd to very strict
Rules in this case; but most Ladies would
be happier, if they had forgot how to
write, when they engage in a thing of this
nature.</P>
<P>[14] Whenever we are to write to a
Person superior to us, either in Merits or
<PB N="369" REF="230"/>
Dignities, it ought to be done in Terms
full of Respect and Submission; and if we
must take care not to write in an abject
and base Stile, so we must not neglect
to give every one his due. Civility is an
excellent Qualification, particularly in Per∣sons
of Quality: This is often the only
current Coin wherewith they pay every
body.</P>
<P>[15] As it is easie to write an obli∣ging
Letter when one lends Money, so
it is a difficult Matter to write well if
you borrow it. There is a certain Re∣luctancy
in Nature to things of this kind,
to such a degree, that he who receives the
Letter, reads it with something of Pre∣judice,
which make him find Faults where
actually there are none.</P>
<P>[16] Never trouble your self to find
a good Conclusion to your Letter; but if
a good Thought falls into your Head, to
be sure make use of it; but if not, <HI>I am,
&amp;c.</HI> is enough upon occasion; it always
stands good.</P>
<P>[17] New Thoughts, full of jollity, and
well turn'd, interspersed as it were carelesly
and unperceived throughout a Letter, carry
along with them a most graceful Charm,
provided there is in them a certain in∣termixture
of Pleasantness and Wisdom,
and that every thing appears to flow from
its natural Source. An affected Letter is
not worth reading.</P>
<P>[18] Supposing you to be never so
Learned, never affect to shew it in your
<PB N="370" REF="231"/>
Letters; at least, not unless it be to some
other Person of Learning, or where a Point
of Wit is in question. Your only business
is to express well your meaning, and that
is not so easie to be done.</P>
<P>[19] Be always as concise as possibly
you can, but without affecting a laconique
Stile, which expresses scarce one half of
your Intentions, for this serves for
nothing else than to confound Matters in
obscurity; whereas the whole secret con∣sists
in explaining ourselves in a neat and
natural Stile: If you have not the gift of
expressing yourself in ten Lines, you do
better to make use of twenty.</P>
<P>[20] Avoid all manner of hard, re∣flecting
and ambiguous Terms, Proverbs
and By-words, which serve only to stuff
up a Letter with what is fulsom to the
Reader.</P>
<P>[21] As you ought never to be care∣less
in what you write, so you must en∣deavour
so artificially to conceal the care
you take of writing well, that the whole
may appear easie and plain. You must
blot out and correct, till you are satisfy'd
with what you have writ; and whilst
you are writing your Thoughts,
Words will fall in, and that in due
course; the chief point is to chuse the
best; happy is he who can do it well at
all times.</P>
<P>It seems, said the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI> to the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> as if you did not
read this Advice without some Vexati∣on.
<PB N="371" REF="232"/>
There are a thousand things in it, re∣ply'd
he, enough to vex me; of this you
may be soon convinced, if you will re∣member,
that it is not Wit alone I look for,
but would fain see something of Tender∣ness,
which Character I can't as yet dis∣cover
in these Rules prescribed by her.
'Tis true, they contain something that is
very Natural, but for the rest, it has a
very slender relation to my Satisfacti∣on,
that a young Lady, whom you would
Love, knows how to write a complimen∣tal,
begging, or consolatory Letter; this
seems very foregin as yet to my pur∣pose.
Alas! <HI>My Lord,</HI> said I, addressing
my self to the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> this young
<HI>Portugueze</HI> mocks me, and too much abuses
our desires, when she pretends, at her Age,
to amuse us with such Lessons, upon such
indifferent Matters. I could wish she had
employ'd her Pen in the same soft manner
that a Lady of her Country did, whose
Name, if I mistake not, was <HI>Mariana,</HI> whose
Letters we have seen among us. You must
own, that nothing can be more passionate if
I could once see a Letter of hers, like those
I would adore her, nay I would turn ra∣ving
Mad for her sake.</P>
<P>And who has told you, answered the
Earl, that she never writ thus to her
Lover? Would you have her appear under
this Character at the Countesses of <HI>O</HI>—
among a sect of Ladies, pretending to the
strictest Rules of Vertue, and among many
Men, with whom she had scarce any ac∣quaintance.
<PB N="372" REF="233"/>
This <HI>Mariana,</HI> whose Let∣ters
you praise so much, had carry'd on
her Passion to a great degree of extrava∣gancy,
for a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> named, if I re∣member
right, the Marquess of <HI>Chamilly,</HI>
and believing that he had left her, Love,
mix't with Despair, made her crack-brain'd.
To have the same Thoughts she had, and
to write as she does, you must suppose
one to be Frenzical, or in Love to a degree
of Madness. I look upon this as a kind
of Love Euthusiasm; and if I should see
a young Lady express her self in such like
terms, I should not know what to think
of her.</P>
<P>You would think, said I smiling, she
was excessively in Love. No doubt on't,
continued he, and that her Love was
rather founded upon her own humour,
than upon choice. I must tell you, that,
for my part, I should rather choose
a modest, well temper'd and reserved
Mistress, than one who is so forward, and
has so great a share of vivacity and activi∣ty.
Every one according to his Mind, said
I, I must confess I had framed to myself
an Idea of the Character of <HI>Donna Maria</HI>
which has not answered my expecta∣tion.
I conjure you to write a Line to our
Friend, and desire him to send us some∣thing
that may prove more satisfactory to
me. I can't but be mightily pleas'd at
your Fancy, <HI>My Lord,</HI> reply'd the Earl,
to give the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> the trouble
of furnishing you with Arms to combat
<PB N="373" REF="234"/>
and vanquish him, for if you Love <HI>Donna
Maria,</HI> you must be his Rival; and if you
are, he will make but slender progress
in her Affection. Alas, <HI>My Lord,</HI> cry'd
I, what makes you say so? The Duke is
handsome, lovely and young; whereas I
have scarce any thing else to recommend
me to the Ladies, but a good Air and
Mien, and some Gallantries; but it is a
hard Task to encounter with a young
Duke, who is no Novice in the Art of
pleasing. If I have any hopes of flattering
my self with Success, it is because he
loved first, and commonly the last has the
advantage over the rest. The Earl of
<HI>Argyle</HI> could not forbear smiling at the
reason I alledg'd to back my hopes of
Success; and Supper being just then ready,
we went out of the Closet into the Dining-Room,
and thence afterwards every one
to his Bed Chamber.</P>
<P>I arose early the next Morning, and
finding the Earl (as yet) in Bed, I ask'd
my Lord, whither he was still asleep.
What should hinder me, cry'd he, 'tis e∣nough
for you to haunt your Friends be∣fore
Day break. I only came, said I, to
know whether you have writ or no. No,
answered he, upon better consideration I
think you had better go to <HI>London,</HI> where
you may see, in Person, the Lady for
whom you suffer so much already, per∣haps
there you will find better Employ∣ment,
than to enquire after her writing
well or ill. I must confess, reply'd I, I
<PB N="374" REF="235"/>
am somewhat uneasie in the Matter, any
Man but my self would make much bet∣ter
use of the King's Favour than I do at
this time, nay it is next door to a piece of
Ingratitude, to absent my self from him
meerly to indulge my own Fancies. But
what would you have me say to you? I
am not the first of that Kind, and were I
sure to be the chief and most happy Favou∣rite
of the greatest Monarch of the Universe,
I would prefer my Passion before my For∣tune:
neither would have you imagine
this frailty to be peculiar only to my self;
no, I had it from my deceased Father,
he was the most gallant Person in the
World, and perhaps you have heard some∣thing
of his amorous Intreagues. I heard
of one, said the Earl, of an extraordinary
Nature, and such a one as sufficiently
shews he would carry on his Love-Passion
to the highest pitch.</P>
<P>I was told, continued he, that he was in
Love with a Person of so high a Rank,
that he had but few opportunities of see∣ing
her, especially since his not coming
to Court must have rendered his Conver∣sation
with the Lady very suspicious to the
World. Reduced to those Streights, he re∣solved
to equip a Vessel at his own charge;
under pretence of taking a Voyage, but in
effect to make the Vessel strand in some
Creek or other, where he and his Atten∣dance,
the Masser and the Pilot (who were
at his Devotion) might save themselves
without much Danger; with an intention
<PB N="375" REF="236"/>
to make the World believe they were
lost: This done, he intended to have en∣tered
himself under the disguise of a
Domestick Servant in the Lady's Service;
and to continue thus happy and satisfy'd
all the remainder of his Days.</P>
<P>The Project, reply'd I, was thus con∣certed,
but fail'd in the Execution; not
but that in all human probability, he
would by this means have encompass'd
his Ends of conversing with the Lady,
had not that Villain, who stabb'd him, put
a fatal Period both to his Passion and Life
at once. He was, said the Earl of St. <HI>Al∣bans,</HI>
interrupting the Duke, the hand∣somest
Man that ever was seen; he had a
way of making himself beloved by every
body, nay even by his Enemies. I have
run astray from my first Subject, reply'd
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> this being one
of the chiefest Conveniencies in the Con∣versation
of Friends, that you talk with∣out
constraint, and make what Digressions
you think fit, without running the risque
of malicious Criticism.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> did all he could to
persuade me, that it was my Duty to get
forthwith to Court, but to no purpose, I
remaining resolute not to leave <HI>Clevedom</HI>
till I was entirely disposed to Love <HI>Donna
Maria de Balboza;</HI> because without it,
<HI>I told him,</HI> I should at first sight be catch'd
again in the Snares of the Countess, and I
can't even disown, that in vain I strive to
avoid speaking of her, and to forget every
<PB N="376" REF="237"/>
thing that may recal her to my mind: I
sigh in spight of my self, I dread her en∣gaging
with any body else, and, in short,
I still feel certain motions of Jealousy,
Anger and Uneasiness, and therefore have
no other way to put her out of my head,
than by another Engagement. Because
you are so resolute, said the Earl, come,
let us write to the Duke; tho' it seems
to me very odd, that a <HI>Billetdouce</HI>
only of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Lady's writing,
should make you fall in love. Love,
cry'd I, is a capricious thing, and if you
should declare open War against me upon
that score, 'tis impossible for me to help
it. The Earl, who was now got out
of Bed, writ his Letter, without giving
me any farther answer. Having perus'd
the Letter, and found it suitable to my
present Sentiments, I thank'd him, and
sent it to the Duke, with another enclo∣sed
of my own writing. Unto which he
gave us an answer, which I am going to
read to you.</P>
<P>You are never to be satisfied, and if the
young <HI>Portugueze</HI> writ day and night, I
question whether you would be contented
and let me be at rest. You would do well
to put some bounds to your Desires, because
she is a little inclin'd to Laziness; and I
can't at this time send you any thing of
hers, except a small Novel, which perhaps
may prove pleasing to you: At the worst, my
Lords, it will give you an opportunity of
putting it into good order, and to add to it
<PB N="377" REF="238"/>
such Embellishments as may still be want∣ing
to render it perfect.</P>
<P>Here it is, my Lord, said the D. of <HI>Buc∣kingham</HI>
to the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> if you
have a mind to read it, it will not take
up much time.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The disguis'd Lover. A Novel.</HEAD>
<P>THE Princesses of <HI>Bourgoes</HI> and of
<HI>Sonnino</HI> seldom fail'd of coming eve∣ry
Year to partake of the Diversions of the
<HI>Carnaval</HI> at <HI>Venice.</HI> They being prevented
(for certain Reasons not appertaining to
this Novel) to go thither, took a Progress
from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Florence,</HI> thence to <HI>Pisa,</HI>
and so to <HI>Lucea,</HI> to take a view of that
City. In these little Journeys, as they
were attended only by a small Retinue,
so they would often ride on Horseback
disguised in Mens Apparel; and the Ladies
that were of their Company did the like
out of Complaisance to the Princesses.
The Princess of <HI>Bourgoes</HI> had a certain
favourite Lady, her near Relation, nam'd
<HI>Donna Pamfilia,</HI> who being extreamly
well shap'd and featur'd, but withal some∣what
large, had the perfect Air of a
handsom Man; so that this Dress be∣coming
her to admiration, she was one of
the most forward for thus disguising her∣self:
The Princess being no less fond to
see her in this Garb, commanded strictly
<PB N="378" REF="239"/>
all her Domesticks, not to discover <HI>Pam∣filia</HI>
to be a young Lady; so she went by
the Name of <HI>Signior Pamfilio,</HI> and under
that Name furnish'd them almost every
day with new Adventures.</P>
<P>The Princesses, upon their arrival at
<HI>Lucea,</HI> took up their Quarters at the Sa∣nator
<HI>Nerli,</HI> who had a very spacious
House, sufficient to entertain all this good
Company. The Princess of <HI>Sonnino,</HI> be∣ing
one of the handsomest Ladies of all
<HI>Italy,</HI> became here the admiration of all
that saw her, the young <HI>Camilla,</HI> Daugh∣ter
of the Senator <HI>Nerli,</HI> being the only
who could stand in competition with her.
The Princesses met with a most honoura∣ble
and gallant Reception from the Sena∣tor,
who was one of the chiefest and
richest Men in that small Republick. His
Daughter being by a certain inevitable
Fatality <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouch'd to the very Heart at the
first fight of the pretended <HI>Pamfilio,</HI> let
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip no opportunity of entertaining and
diverting him with a thousand agreeable
Enticements which she was Mistress of
<HI>Pamfilia</HI> soon perceiving her favourable
Disposition, and willing to improve this
odd Adventure, and push it to the utmost,
did not fail to make his Courtship to

what makes you so melancholy and re∣serv'd,
Signior <HI>Pamfilio?</HI> Come, confess
sincerely that you are in love. If it is with
one of our Ladies here, and you are af∣flicted
at her cruel Usage, make me your
Confident, and be assured I will omit no∣thing
to serve you. <HI>Pamfilio</HI> soon under∣standing
the meaning of this Question,
reply'd, with a passionate Air, 'Tis true,
Madam, notwithstanding your generous
Offers, I dare not make you my Confi∣dent;
it proves often dangerous to dis∣close
a Secret, which being once left to
your disposal, who knows what use you
might make of it? But you allow your∣self
to be in love, reply'd <HI>Camilla</HI> blush∣ing,
your intention being only to con∣ceal
the Name of your Mistress. No,
Madam, return'd this malicious young
Lady, this is none of my design, but I
dare not name her. And if I should guess
at it, continu'd she, somewhat concern'd,
would you be so free as to own it? Un∣der
condition, said <HI>Pamfilio,</HI> that I may
not incur your displeasure, I will own it
with all my heart. Some more Company
coming in, they were prevented from
proceeding farther in their Discourse;
but the too credulous <HI>Camilla,</HI> sensibly
touch'd with the Merits of <HI>Pamfilio,</HI> gave
her Eyes sufficient liberty to be the Inter∣preters
of the Sentiments of her Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Pamfilia</HI> was in a thousand minds, whe∣ther
to undeceive the poor <HI>Camilla;</HI> and
the first time she had the opportunity of
<PB N="380" REF="241"/>
talking freely with the Princesses, she
told them of the beginning of her amo∣rous
Intreague with the Senator's Daugh∣ter,
and that she had made already such
a progress in it, that she judg'd she was
not ill belov'd. The Princesses malici∣ously
rejoicing at the mistake of <HI>Camilla,</HI>
congratulated <HI>Pamfilio</HI> upon his glorious
Conquest, and at the same time urging
her to continue to act the Part of a Lo∣ver,
<HI>Pamfilia</HI> promis'd them she would
push on her good Fortune to the utmost,
and immediately writ the following Bil∣let
to <HI>Camilla.</HI></P>
<P>Why, Madam, would you ask me whe∣ther
I was in love? Was it because I
should tell you, that it was not with you?
I can't tell whether you think any body in
the World more worthy of being belov'd, but
I am confident I know none; and am sensi∣ble,
that in having given my Heart to you
before all the rest I ever saw, I have done
you no more than justice. My Destiny is
now in your power, you may prove either
kind or cruel to the utmost of your desire,
but mine shall always continue with the
same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervency to please you.</P>
<P>It being no difficult matter for <HI>Pamfilia</HI>
to deliver this Billet to <HI>Camilla,</HI> she re∣turn'd
this Answer.</P>
<P>I am not so far prepossess'd with my own
Merits, as to imagine that you could love
nothing but me. When I enquir'd after the
Secret of your Heart, I expected no farther
share in it than that of a Confident. How∣ever,
<PB N="381" REF="242"/>
I will not disown but that I have too
high an esteem for you to look upon your
Declaration with an indifferent eye: If
your desire of pleasing me is unfeigned, I
promise you, upon my Word, I will put
it to a good account.</P>
<P><HI>Pamfilia</HI> run strait with this Billet to
the Princesses, who making it the sub∣ject
of their Disversion and Mirth for a
whole day, <HI>Camilla</HI> writ another in these
Words.</P>
<P>I can scarce express to you, <HI>Signior
Pamfilio,</HI> the Pain I have endur'd all this
day; I expected to have seen you; my
Eyes did search for you in every Corner,
but could not meet with you: Can you love
me after so easie a way?</P>
<P><HI>Pamfilia</HI> immediately writ this An∣swer.</P>
<P>You are not much out of humour, Ma∣dam,
for not having seen me to day, be∣cause
you shew your goodness even when
you suppose me to have given you sufficient
reason of wishing me ill. Truly, your Re∣proaches
are so obliging, that let my lose
be never so great in passing a day without
you, I can't repent of it; and I will frank∣ly
own to you, that I tast much more plea∣sure
in reading by myself your Billet, than
to see you surrounded with a crowd of Peo∣ple,
who are questionless my Rivals, and
perhaps preferr'd by you before me. Alas!
was my Heart at as much ease as you charge
it with, I should not feel these insensible mo∣tions
of Jealousie. Don't refuse me an
<PB N="382" REF="243"/>
opportunity of a few Minutes, where I
may declare that I adore you.</P>
<P><HI>Camilla</HI> return'd the following Answer
the next day.</P>
<P>I am not asham'd to own, that you please
me exceedingly, that I take a pleasure in
seeing you, and that I can't reflect upon
the necessity of your absence without Pain;
yet I should never forgive myself if I should
give you an opportunity of seeing me in
private. Did I esteem you less, you would
appear less dangerous to me. Rest satisfy'd
with what I tell you, and never look for
an opportunity of seeing me in private.</P>
<P><HI>Pamfilia</HI> soon after seeing <HI>Camilla,</HI> told
her; Truly, Madam, your Favours are
attended with too much trouble and pain,
you flatter me as if I were not indifferent
to you, and treat me worse than if I
actually was so: For, what can be more
cruel to me, than your commands of not
seeing you in private? This was done,
said <HI>Camilla</HI> to him, because if I should
give way to those favourable Dispositions
I have for you, I might perhaps not re∣main
long so far Mistress of myself, as
to shun you when it ought to be done.
And what can oblige you, reply'd <HI>Pam∣filia,</HI>
to shun me? The more you are ac∣quainted
with me, the less danger you
will apprehend in my Conversation. I
am too sensible, reply'd she with a Blush,
of the Sentiments of my Heart; and be∣cause
you are so urgent to know the rea∣son
that moves me to shun you, I must
<PB N="383" REF="244"/>
give you an account of my Misfor∣tunes.</P>
<P>Know then, <HI>Pamfilio,</HI> that a certain
<HI>English</HI> Gentleman, of the Family of the
Dukes of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> coming to <HI>Lucea,</HI> I
happen'd to see him the first time at a
Feast, which the Great Duke of <HI>Florence</HI>
(who comes hither sometimes) gave to
the Ladies. There being at the same time
a Ball, and this Stranger dancing among
the rest, I conceiv'd in his Person all the
Charms that can possibly be suppos'd to
be the effects of a fine Air and Mien,
mix'd with Youth and Beauty. If my
Eyes did betray my Sentiments, his ap∣pear'd
no less favourably dispos'd for me;
and after having left off dancing, and
gain'd the applause of all the Company,
he plac'd himself just by me. I thought
I ought not to refuse him my approba∣tion;
and looking upon him with a most
obliging Air, told him, Sir, you have
gain'd the admiration of all the Company;
and, as for myself, I confess I never saw
any one dance with a better grace and
more exactness in all my life. If it be
so, Madam, said he, that this Company
has thought fit to give me their approba∣tion,
nothing affects me more sensibly
than yours in particular. At the same
time, I dare affirm to you, that I feel
within me such Sentiments for your Per∣son,
as may much better entitle me to
the Favour you have been pleas'd to afford
me. Rest satisfy'd with what you have
<PB N="384" REF="245"/>
receiv'd, said I smiling, possibly when
you are better known—Here an old
rigorous Kinswoman, with whom I was
come to the Feast, interrupted me, whi∣spering
in my Ear, it was not decent to
talk with a Stranger, and unless I broke
off the Conversation; she would tell my
Father. After this I durst not speak one
word more to my Lord, but my Eyes told
him sufficiently, that my silence was the
effect of some constraint.</P>
<P>The Idea of his Person had made so
strong an impression upon my Heart, that
I did not sleep one wink all that night;
but the next day, as I was contriving all
possible means to talk with him, in comes
he, towards the Evening, with an Ac∣quaintance
of my Father's. You may
judge how I was pleas'd with this agreea∣ble
Surprize; especially when the Friend
that introduc'd him, told me, that he had
brought me a most excellent Dancing-Master,
who, in a small time, would
teach me how to dance <HI>English</HI> Country
Dances; which my Father being willing
I should learn, and coming into the Room
at the same time, he told him the same
Story, whereat my Father was so well
pleas'd, that he would see him give me
the first Lesson. He perform'd his Part
so nicely and naturally, that he would
have deceiv'd any body. Whilst we were
dancing, he conjur'd me to tell him whe∣ther
I thought this <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> an Ob∣ligation,
since I might be assur'd that what
<PB N="385" REF="246"/>
he did, proceeded from a Heart full of ten∣der
Inclinations; that if he prov'd so un∣fortunate
as to find me insensible, he de∣sir'd
I might declare it frankly, that so he
might endeavour to cure himself of a
Passion, the very beginning whereof had
already made such a lively impression up∣on
his Heart, that he had all the reason
in the world to fear he should not be able
to master it hereafter. I told him, he
puzled me with such a blunt. Question,
that the Presence of my Father hinder'd
my giving him an answer, but if he
would come again to morrow, he would
much oblige me.</P>
<P>My Father being well pleased with the
Dexterity of my new Master, he came
again the next day; and being then at li∣berty
to talk, What must be my Destiny?
said he: Will you permit me, Madam,
to love you; and have so much Goodness
as not to hate me? The same moment
my Father entring the Room, his Presence
robb'd me of the opportunity of return∣ing
an answer, at least, such as I would;
so all what I could say, with a low
Voice, was, <HI>Love, and you may please.</HI></P>
<P>My Father not staying long, he was
no sooner gone, but my Lord continu'd,
Oh! Madam, how happy am I, if to
please you requires only to love you! A
Person of such high Merit as yours, re∣ply'd
I blushing, need nothing else than
love to please. But, continu'd <HI>Camilla,</HI>
I will not rehearse all the Particulars of
<PB N="386" REF="247"/>
our Conversation, but only tell you, That
I never pass'd my Time, all the Days of my
life, with more pleasure and satisfaction,
than during this lovely Stranger's coming
to our House, which was every day. Things
were come to such a pass, that we were
contriving only the most proper Methods
of making my Father consent to our Mar∣riage;
and the Great Duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI>
having engag'd himself to use all his In∣terest
with my Father in my Lord's be∣half,
the day for putting this Question
was fix'd; when one of my Father's
Friends, more sullen and jealous than
wise, having got the scent of my Lord's
coming to our House under the disguise
of a Dancing-Master, thought the Affront
was not to be wiped off, but with the
loss of his Life. Accordingly he disco∣vers
the whole amorous Intreague to my
Father, and all its pretended Consequen∣ces,
and that in so heinous a manner, as
put my Father beyond all bounds of Mo∣deration.
During this his furious Passion,
he dream'd of nothing else, than my ha∣ving
sacrific'd my Reputation to my Lo∣ver's
Passion; and upon that Supposition
(which he took absolutely for granted)
he resolv'd to sacrifice him to his Ha∣tred.</P>
<P>It happen'd very fortunately, that
whilst my Father was concerting Mea∣sures,
with his before-nam'd Friend, to
have him stabb'd without any noise, they
thought fit to communicate the matter to
<PB N="387" REF="248"/>
a certain Gentleman, a bold Fellow, who
being in my Father's Service, he put an
entire Confidence in. By good chance
I had some time before acquainted him
with what had pass'd betwixt my Lord
and I; and he looking upon the matter
with quite another eye than my Father,
he forewarn'd me of the danger of my
Lover, and that unless he soon departed
the place, he could not be answerable for
his Life, my Father having vow'd his
Destruction. But, reply'd I, if my Fa∣ther
is once convinc'd of his Extraction
and his Merits, questionless he will not
persist in his Passion. No, Madam, says
he, don't flatter yourself, I myself have
try'd him there. I told him who he was,
and how he was back'd by the Interest of
the Great Duke; which serv'd only to
furnish him with fresh Matter for his
Passion. What, said he, a Person of Qua∣lity
and Merits to go to dishonour my
House, and under so scandalous a Dis∣guise
to get the opportunity of seeing my
Daughter! The Traytor shall die for it,
or I will die myself.</P>
<P>I was fully convinc'd, added <HI>Camilla,</HI>
by the discourse of this Gentleman, that
I must resolve to persuade my Lord to
absent himself, unless I would see his
Life expos'd to a thousand dangers. Pray
consider what a cruel Task this was to
me, to be employ'd in procuring the ab∣sence
of a Person the dearest to me in the
world. But as after all no other Misfor∣tune
<PB N="388" REF="249"/>
appear'd to me comparable, or what
I would not willingly submit to, than that
which made me dread some fatal Event
in his Person, and that no time was to
be lost to advertise him of the danger; I
conjur'd the same Gentleman, whom they
intended to make the Instrument of his
Destruction, to lend me a helping hand
in saving him. My Entreaties prov'd so
effectual, that he (tho' not without a
great deal of difficulty) undertook to de∣liver
unto him, from me, the following
Letter.</P>
<P>Tho' I have all the reason in the world
to believe that in losing you I shall lose all
the Repose and the only Satisfaction of my
life, yet indispensable necessity forces me
to conjure you to depart; my Father is too
far overcome by the fury of his Passion for
me to expect, without dread or horror, the
effects thereof. He fancies I not only love
you, but have given you such proofs of it,
as are little becoming his Honour and
Blood. I must tell you, to the shame of my
native Country, Poisons and Daggers are
set to work here, and nothing is look'd
upon as unbecoming a Man, to revenge
his Honour. How can you suppose to se∣cure
your self always against such clan∣destine
Designs? You will never be able
to escape the Snares, these Methods being
directly opposite to the generous Actions of
your Country; and supposing you could be
so fortunate as to escape the Danger, con∣sider
what Torments I should continually
<PB N="389" REF="250"/>
be expos'd to, without any hopes of a De∣liverance.
Did my Father's Fury aim at
my life only, you should find me to expose
my Person with such an undaunted Reso∣lution,
as perhaps would surprize you:
But alas! your share is the greater of the
two, and I confess, without a blush, that I
find in myself all the Frailties of my Sex,
and of a Lover. Depart then, I beg it of
you upon that Friendship you have vow'd
to me with so much tenderness; depart for
my Reputation's, and for your own sake.
Oh! what is it I say? This Command will
cost me very dear. Don't charge me there∣fore
with laying it upon you without pain;
you would do me the greatest piece of In∣justice
to suspect my Heart; but only that
I can't see you continue in a place where
you have to do with such dangerous Ene∣mies.
Don't increase the Misery of one of
the most unhappy Persons in the Universe,
by the addition of such cruel Circum∣stances;
but remember I love you at so
uncommon a rate, that I would sacrifice
my Life only to deliver you from the ap∣pearance
of Dangers that threaten yours.
Remember farther, that our Persecutor is
my Father, that you can't do any thing a∣gainst
him, but I must feel the Blow at se∣cond
hand; and that after all, your depar∣ture,
which perhaps will cost me my Life,
is the only Favour I can ask of you; and
I ask it as an effect of that Obedience
whereby you will preserve for ever the pos∣session
of my Heart. O good God! my
<PB N="390" REF="251"/>
Strength fails me, my Torments overcome
me; depart, compassionate and love me.</P>
<P>My Tears almost effaced the Characters
of my Letters; however I gave it to the
Gentleman before mention'd, who deli∣ver'd
it to my Lord, and told him what
else I had charged him with. He con∣tinu'd
for a long time in suspence, his
Soul being distracted by most violent and
contrary Passions: But at last resolving
to depart, he writ these Lines.</P>
<P>I am going to depart, Madam; 'tis
enough that you have comman<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d it for the
preservation of my Life; but I can assure
you, this Command will not serve to pro∣tract
it long; my absence will serve instead
of Poison and Dagger to the unjust Re∣venge
of your Father. I shall die, Madam,
but remember, 'tis for obeying your Com∣mands.</P>
<P>The reading of this Billet touch'd me
so to the quick, that I wonder I did not
lose all my Senses; and my Lord having
absented himself pursuant to my desire, I
now began to repent of what I had done;
but after all, when I seriously reflected
upon the Danger that threatned him, I
was forced to be contented as well as I
could. My Father not questioning but
that his sudden retreat from hence was
the effect of being advertised of his
Design, thought it nevertheless not con∣venient
to reprimand me on account
of what had pass'd, for fear of worse
consequences, but took a Resolution of
<PB N="391" REF="252"/>
marrying me out of hand, to be rid of
the trouble of watching the Conduct
of a young Woman; but hitherto no
Match that was thought suitable has of∣fered
it self. I began, by the help of my
Reason, and my Lord's Absence, to forget
him by degrees; notwithstanding which,
I felt certain frail and tender Intervals,
which, as it made me distrust my strength,
so I avoided all opportunities of hearing
any News from him. Upon your arival
here, tho' I own your Merits are very
great, yet I should scarce have had such a
favourable disposition towards you, had
it not been for the resemblance you have
to my Lover: I no sooner saw you, but
I thought I saw him; the same Features,
nay the same Voice; so that my poor
Heart, betwixt such a surprize and flattery,
suffered itself to be carry'd away to love
you. But let us take heed, not to let
loose the reigns of our Passion; I have rea∣son
to remember the last. I know I am
unfortunate; you see how I was forced to
break off with what I loved so dearly:
Alas! what ought I not to dread upon
your account? Here she stopt, and <HI>Pam∣filia,</HI>
most sensibly touch'd with the since∣rity
of this fair Person, judged she ought
no longer to abuse her Credulity; she dis∣cover'd
her Sex, asking her a thousand Par∣dons
for this pleasant Imposture. <HI>Pamfi∣lia</HI>
was not a litrle vex'd at the Mat∣ter;
but conceal'd it, returning her
many Thanks for having recall'd her out
<PB N="392" REF="253"/>
of an Error, which in time might have
cost her very dear; and the Princesses of
<HI>Bourgues</HI> and <HI>Sonnino,</HI> having tarried at
<HI>Lucea,</HI> as long as they proposed, return'd
with <HI>Pamfilia</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The End of the Novel.</HEAD>
<P>I continued in so splenetick a Humour
that the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> being surprized
thereat, told me; What, don't you praise
this little Novel? Don't you relish it? Or,
do you want still another peice of <HI>Donna
Maria,</HI> to support your resolution of
loving her? One must be very difficult in∣deed,
said I, not to be satisfy'd with what
I just now read: But don't you see, as
well as I, that the whole is her own
History, and that she has only represented
it under borrow'd Names, and fix'd the
Scene in another Country. I don't see
that, reply'd the Earl, such like Adven∣tures
happen every day, and are known
and written. No, no, reply'd I, she is
too particular for any other but herself;
she is the <HI>Camilla.</HI> Good God! what a
Letter is here, continued I, reading the
Billet she sent to my Lord, to command
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im to depart; how nicely stil'd▪ and
how full of love! Without doubt she still
loves him, and her Father, not knowing
what to do with her, thought he could
not pitch upon a better expedient to cure
her Passion, than to send her away. This
is the true cause of her Voyage, 'tis this
<PB N="393" REF="254"/>
that has brought her to our Court, and
that with a Heart preposess'd with a
tender Passion; judge what I am going to
do, to go about to encounter a beloved
Rival, and to please a Person gained be∣fore
by another.</P>
<P>I am surprized, said the Earl, you should
be so uneasie, as if you were to encounter
with Monsters; methinks you appear so
little like yourself, that both my Eyes
are scarce sufficient to convince me it is
you I speak to. I must confess, said I,
that I begin to be asham'd of my Frailty;
but what is it I can alledge in my own
behalf? I find myself seized already with
a most violent Passion, and what Follies
are not we guilty of, during these first ir∣regular
Motions of our Hearts? Come,
let's go to <HI>London,</HI> continued I, <HI>Donna
Maria</HI> will, by her Wit, by the Jealousies
and Inquietudes she makes me feel already,
soon put me in a condition of overcoming
my Passion for the Countess; come, let
us go and insult over the Charms of this
faithless Woman, and pay our homage to
the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Lady.</P>
<P>The Earl being almost tired with our
stay at <HI>Clevedom,</HI> was glad of this oppor∣tunity
of returning to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> without
leaving me behind in the Country. Up∣on
the Road he heard me say nothing but
what related to the lovely <HI>Balboza.</HI> I
read her Novel over and over, which
serv'd only to confirm me in my opinion,
that she loved somebody or other. 'Tis
<PB N="394" REF="255"/>
true, in the midst of all my Sufferings, I
found some Comfort, when I consider'd,
that she had not seen her Lover for a long
time; I flatter'd myself, that she retain'd,
as yet, so much of his Idea in her Mind,
as might make her stand her ground a∣gainst
the Addresses of the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
and that I might find an opportu∣nity
of courting her with such success, as
to get the better both of her absent Lover,
and of the young Duke. With this con∣fusion
of Thoughts I came to <HI>London.</HI>
After having paid my Respects to the
King, who gave me a reception suitable
to his wonted Goodness, and chid me on
account ofmy long stay in the Country,
the reason whereof he had been inform'd
of much better than I thought he had;
I went to the great Appartment, where
the Queen just then kept the Circle. The
first thing that offered itself to my view
was the Countess, a thousand times hand∣somer
than ever I saw her before, and
the young <HI>Portugueze,</HI> meagre and brown,
but very well featur'd, excellent good
Teeth, and her Eyes sufficient to tame the
fiercest Heart upon Earth.</P>
<P>As she had never seen me before, so she
lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k'd steadfast upon me, whilst she was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alking with my Lady <HI>H—,</HI> which
made me imagine, that she ask'd her my
Name. Highly pleased with this piece of
curiosity in her, I drew nearer, and told her,
Pray Madam, ask not my Name from any
body but myself; I am come to Court on
<PB N="395" REF="256"/>
purpose to tell it you. She being surprized,
blush'd at so extraordinary a Complement,
and said, And who has told you, my Lord,
that my Discourse was concerning you?
You must certainly be very quick, that I
cou'd scarce open my Mouth, but you
know what I said. My Lady <HI>H</HI>—
then interrupting our Discourse, and my
aim being to make myself appear as agree∣able
as possibly I cou'd, I made use of all
the sprightliness of my Wit, and a cer∣tain
diverting Air, which proved not dis∣pleasing
to <HI>Donna Maria.</HI> But during
our Conversation, the Countess being very
attentive upon all that pass'd, and the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who also claim'd
an Interest in her, (as he told me but
a few days ago) were both ready to run
distracted to see me converse so frankly
with <HI>Balboza,</HI> as if our Acquaintance had
been of some Years standing. Out of re∣spect
to the Queen▪ we could not dis∣course
together so long as I could have
wish'd, and I had not the least opportu∣nity
of coming near her again that Even∣ing.</P>
<P>I was no sooner return'd to my Lodg∣ings,
but the Dutchess of <HI>B—m,</HI> who
had seen me talk to the young <HI>Portugeze,</HI>
ask'd me, whither her Wit had not charm'd
me? I answered, with an affected Indiffe∣rency,
that I cou'd find no Wonders in her;
that she had a great vivacity of Thoughts,
but it was impossible such fiery no∣tions
should be accompany'd with a sound
<PB N="396" REF="257"/>
Judgment, and that I never was fond of a
Head without Brain. She makes a great
noise, continued she; and as the Queen
shews her a great deal of Favour, so most
of the Ladies have entertain'd her at Din∣ner.
I, in my turn, have agreed with the
Dutchess of <HI>Richmond,</HI> my Lady <HI>H</HI>—
and the Countess of <HI>Fesmouth,</HI> to carry
her abroad to <HI>Sion Hill.</HI> And, reply'd
I briskly, Why, would you invite only
Women? No, said she, the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> and the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI>
would have given any thing to have been
of the Company; but the Queen, who
is sensible of their Passion for <HI>Donna
Maria,</HI> would perhaps have taken it a∣miss;
so that instead of courting her Fa∣vour,
as I intend to do, I should have got
her Anger. I commended her Prudence, but
at the same time told her, that the Queen
would not be against my going along with
them, and that I intended to bring along
with me the Earls of <HI>Argyle,</HI> of <HI>O</HI>—
and Mr.—<HI>Porter,</HI> he being a Person of
so gay and merry a Temper, that I was
certain the Ladies wou'd be very well
pleas'd with his Company.</P>
<P>And can you imagine, reply'd she, that
he can be gay in any place where the
Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI> is? and that after
all his pretensions, and the game he has
play'd her, he will not rather affect a se∣rious
Air and Countenance? I burst out a
laughing; truly, said I, he is not apt to
lay things thus to Heart, he ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s a game
<PB N="397" REF="258"/>
of it all. Oh, cry'd she, make him believe
so if you can; I shan't forget what he
told me but two days ago. And what
did he tell you, said I? All, said she,
what a Man reduced to Despair is able to
say. So, you are catch'd in the Trap, con∣tinu'd
I. And so wou'd all the World as
well as myself, said she, and without
doubt I am not altogether in the wrong,
to complain of your Sister. Give me
leave to interrupt you, said the Earl of
<HI>A—n,</HI> and to ask you, my Lord, what
was the occasion of the falling out be∣twixt
the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Porter.</HI> Are you the only Man at Court,
said the Earl of S. <HI>A</HI>—, that is a stranger
to it? However, things sometimes hap∣pening
thus, that near Relations know
less of them than others, I will, whilst
my Lord Duke takes a little breathing∣time,
give you an account of this Adven∣ture.</P>
<P>The Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI> was scarce
Eleven Years of Age when she was marry'd
to my Lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> Son to the Earl of
<HI>Pembrook;</HI> but he dying soon after, she
appear'd at Court in her Widows Garb,
whilst she was yet a Child; and tho' her
Features were at that time not framed
to their full perfection, yet she was
look'd upon as a Person, who in time
wou'd prove the greatest Beauty in
<HI>England.</HI> One day she was got up into a
Tree in the King's little Garden, to ga∣ther
som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fruit, and nobody being per∣mitted
<PB N="398" REF="259"/>
to come▪ in there; this, together
with her black Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b and long Veil, which
being spread over the Twigs of the Tree,
look'd like Wings, made the King, who
perceiv'd her at a good distance, ima∣gine,
that some strange Bird had perch'd
in the Tree. Mr.—<HI>Porter,</HI> a young
Courtier, and much in favour with the
King; being a handsome Person, and ex∣treamly
Gallant and Diverting in Conver∣sation,
was then with him; and the King
knowing him to be an exact Marks Man;
told him, you must kill this large Bird
which I see in one of the Trees of my
little Garden. Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> looking for
some time towards the place, and finding
the Bird out of reach of his Ball, told
the King he would take his Fusee,
and in a moment bring him the But∣terfly:
But he was ready to burst with
laughing, when, approaching the Tree, he
found the young Countess; who smil'd
at him with an innocent Air, pelted him
with the Fruit she had gather'd; whilst he
took more peculiar notice, than ever he
had done before, of her Beauty, the cleer∣ness
of her Skin, and the brightness of
her Eyes; every thing appear'd infinitely
charming to him; so that when he reflect∣ed
upon what design he was come thither,
he cou'd not forgive himself; sometimes
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> look'd upon her, then upon his Fusee,
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thout being able to speak one word for
himself. <HI>What have you there</HI> Porter,
said she, <HI>What can't you speak? Are you
<PB N="399" REF="260"/>
bewitch'd?</HI> Oh, Madam, reply'd he, did
you know what brought me hither, you
wou'd be sensible I have sufficient reason
to be surprized. The King happening to
espy you in the Tree, and taking you for
a Bird; guess upon what errant I was sent
hither. <HI>What,</HI> cry'd she, <HI>to kill me? Yes,
to kill you Madam,</HI> said I; I promised to
bring the King some of your Feathers.
<HI>Hah, hah,</HI> said she laughing, you must be
as good as your word; we will play a
merry Game with him: I will put my∣self
into a large Hamper, and so be car∣ry'd
into his Appartment. She sent im∣mediately
for a Hamper; and one of her
Gentlemen taking hold on one and
Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> on the other end, he told her
a thousand pretty things, as they went a∣long;
unto which she answer'd, with a
great vivacity of Wit, and so pass'd her
time pleasantly enough in the Hamper?
Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> presenting it to the King, told
him, he had had the good fortune to take
the Butterfly alive; which was so beauti∣ful,
that had he kill'd it, he shou'd never
have out-liv'd it himself. His Majesty,
eager to see it, opens the Hamper, and
the young Countess clasping her Arms a∣bout
his Neck, furnish'd matter for a
most agreeable surprize. 'Tis not to be
admired, that she embraced the King in so
familiar a way, every body knows they
were bred up together, and he look'd up∣on
her no otherwise than his own Sister.
Ever since that time, she has been known
<PB N="400" REF="261"/>
by the Name of <HI>Butterfly,</HI> and in several
Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that name is oftner
given her, than her own Title.</P>
<P><HI>Porter</HI> fell so deeply in Love with this
growing Beauty, that he could scarce live
without seeing her, but durst not give a
free course to his Passion; because she
was afterwards marry'd to the Duke of
<HI>Richmond,</HI> and by her high Rank of being
a Princess of the Blood Royal, infinitely
above him, (tho' he was one of the most
accomplish'd Persons of the Court) he
lost all hopes of gaining her Affections.
As he believ'd that another Love Passion
might be able to rase out of his Heart
that which had taken absolute possession
there before, he entred into an amorous
Engagement with one Mrs. <HI>L—g,</HI> a
Player, whom he took along with him
into the Country, in hopes that the
sweetness of her Conversation might
prove a cure to his Love. The King,
who knew nothing of his Affections for
the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond,</HI> would shew
sometimes his dislike at his absence from
Court; but he answer'd only with silence,
and continu'd his course. The Troubles
that arose about that time in <HI>England,</HI>
put a stop to the Passion of Mr. <HI>Porter.</HI>
The Dutchess of <HI>Richmond,</HI> now once
more a Widow, went along with the
Queen-Mother into <HI>France,</HI> in the Qua∣lity
of her Lady of the Bed Chamber;
where by the example of that great Prin∣cess,
and by her own Experience, she had
<PB N="401" REF="262"/>
sufficient occasion to learn, that even Per∣sons
of a most exalted Fortune, and who
seem to be fix'd upon the most firm basis
that can be laid, are subject to great
Chances: She, who was Beautiful even to
Perfection, and who had appear'd with
no less Magnificence than if she were a
Queen, finding herself reduced to want
some Necessaries; for I heard her declare
myself, that one Summer she had often
occasion for Gloves, not being able to wear
them dirty, and wanting Mony to buy new
ones.</P>
<P>But without insisting farther upon
moral Reflexions, I must tell you, that her
Heart was not so insensible at <HI>Paris,</HI> as
it had been at <HI>London;</HI> and to divert her
melancholly hours, she gave a favourable
ear to Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> a Gentleman of merit,
handsom, and full of gallantry, (as you
know yourself) who, as well as many
more, had left <HI>England,</HI> and was fall'n
passionately in Love with the Dutchess.
At first she received him with indifferen∣cy
only; but after some time they began
to be in earnest. 'Tis true, they carry'd
on Matters with so much circumspection,
that nobody suspected any thing of the
matter, till after the return of the Dut∣chess
to <HI>London,</HI> when the thing took
vent; because Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> who had been
in Love with the Countess of <HI>S</HI>—
before he left <HI>England,</HI> now renew'd his
visits to her; which creating a Jealousy
in the Dutchess, broke all the measures
<PB N="402" REF="263"/>
they had taken of keeping this matter pri∣vate.
Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> finding her enraged at
him, told her, it was in her power to se∣cure
his Heart for ever, by marrying him,
that he would remain faithful to her till
Death, and that she should never fail of meet∣ing
with all possible tenderness and acknow∣ledgments
in his Person. The Dutchess
paused a while upon a Proposition of so
great a Moment; but at last she consider'd
with herself, that the <HI>English</HI> Dutchesse's
lose neither their Title, nor their Rank,
if they marry a private Person; and there∣fore
judged, that being twice marry'd
by the choice of the Court, she might the
third time dispose of herself to a gallant
Person whom she liked; accordingly she
positively engaged herself to Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI>
under Condition to keep their Marriage
undiscover'd for some time. He being
sensible of the Sweets of so advanta∣geous
a Match, willingly promised, and
in the mean time look'd out for a conve∣nient
House where they might consum∣mate
the Marriage without noise or di∣sturbance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> had marry'd a Lady of
Quality, and she was very handsome;
notwithstanding which, they were parted,
and he lived with the Player in the
Country, endeavouring to rase out of his
Mind the Beauty of the Dutchess of
<HI>Richmond;</HI> her absence had afforded him
some respite, and his Reason told him,
it was next to an impossibility to hope to
<PB N="403" REF="264"/>
please a Lady, who always loved herself
so well, as to be indifferent to others;
he had that comfort in his Afflictions, to
think, that all the rest who loved her,
had been no more successful than himself.
Whilst he was distracting his Head with
these Thoughts one Night, word was sent
him, that Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> was come to speak
with him about Business of consequence.
They being most intimate Friends, he
stay'd not one moment; but meeting him,
they embraced, as Friends used to do,
who had not seen one another in two
Years. At last, Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> told him,
that he being just now engaged in an af∣fair
of the greatest importance to him, he
thought he could pitch upon nobody else,
but upon him, to put his whole Fortune
into his hands; That he was upon the
point of marrying the handsomest Lady
and of the best Quality in <HI>England;</HI> but
that she being willing to marry in private,
he conjured him to lend him his House.
Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> who was overjoy'd at the
confidence his Friend put in him, embra∣ced
and told him, that all he was master
of was at his Service, without reserve;
and he might dispose of it at his own
pleasure; and to convince him of his sin∣cerity,
that if he thought the Name of the
Lady ought to remain a mystery to him,
he would not so much as ask it. Mr. <HI>How∣ard</HI>
reply'd, were it in an Affair that con∣cern'd
me alone, I should not keep it from
your knowledge, but that his Mistress ha∣ving
<PB N="404" REF="265"/>
laid her absolute Commands upon
him, he could not but obey her. Then
obey her, reply'd Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> I swear to
you I will keep with Mrs. <HI>L—g</HI> in
the most remote Appartment of the House,
and your Nuptial Pleasures shall not
meet with the least interruption here.
Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> hereupon takes his leave,
and returning strait to the Dutchess,
gives her an account of what he `had
done. I am very glad, said she, you have
pitch'd upon Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> he always
shew'd a most peculiar esteem for me;
and therefore I would not have you make
our Marriage a Secret to him; he being
better qualify'd to know it, than any one
in the whole Court, and you may discover
the whole Matter to him.</P>
<P>The day appointed for this Journey be∣ing
come, the Dutchess and her Lover
departed without any noise; and coming
to their Friend's House, find him lock'd
up in his Chamber. Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> ask'd
for him, but was told he was not at home,
but that he might dispose of every thing
in the House at his own pleasure.
Whilst they were busied in making the ne∣cessary
Preparations for the Nuptial Cere∣monies,
a Fire broke out in one of the
Rooms, and burning into the Appartment
where the Dutchess was, she, full of
Fright and Confusion, runs up a pair of
back Stairs, and finding a door open, en∣ters
the Room; which, proving to be
Mr. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Closet, she found him busy
<PB N="405" REF="266"/>
in searching among his Papers: He hap∣pening
at the same time to light upon a
Picture in miniature of the Dutchess of
<HI>Richmond,</HI> painted at length, dress'd in
Mens Apparel, as you see her painted at
<HI>Whitehall</HI> in several places, (because she
has a most Majestick Air, and the finest
Leg in the World) left off rumishing a∣mong
his Papers, in order to admire this
Picture, the sight whereof made the
Wounds of his Heart, occasioned by the
Beauty of this Dutchess, bleed afresh.
Whilst he was sighing for her, he heard
a noise, and turning his Head that way,
found her just entring the Door.</P>
<P>Never was any Person surpriz'd with
more delight than he; he ran towards her,
saluted her with a great deal of Re∣spect;
and ask'd her, What good Fortune
brought her thither? The preference,
said she, I have given you before all our
Friends: I come along with Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI>
about the Business he spoke to you of be¦fore.
That is as much as to say, Madam
reply'd Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> you have had s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
good an opinion of my Discretion, as t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
engage for me to the Lady he is going t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
be married to; and I suppose you are
come, by your Presence, to add to the En∣joyments
of the Feast. How! cry'd th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Dutchess, laughing aloud; Is it possible
a Person of your Wit should not be∣fore
this imagine it was my own Se∣cret
I put into your hands? At these
Words, Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> looking stedfast upon
<PB N="406" REF="267"/>
her for some time, without speaking one
Word, his Strength and Senses left him,
and he fell in so deep a Swoon, that the
Dutchess thought he would never have
recovered himself. Being strangely sur∣prized
at so unexpected an Accident, she
was going to cry out for help, when
he begg'd, to afford him a few mo∣ments
audience. Accordingly, having ta∣ken
a Seat near him, he look'd in her
Face for some time longer, without be∣ing
able to find Words he thought sui∣table
to express the violence of his Pas∣sion.
The Dutchess attributed his Silence
to his Weakness; for, knowing him a
Man of Wit, and who had the easiest
way in the world of expressing his
Thoughts, she judg'd that nothing could
puzle him upon that account. But Re∣spect
and Fear are the inseparable Compa∣nions
of Love; and these two are sufficient
to make the boldest Man in the world
the greatest Coward.</P>
<P><HI>At last, this Gentleman, overwhelm'd
with Grief and Vexation,</HI> Is it possible,
Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> you should pitch up∣on
my House to be marry'd in, and that
the dearest of all my Friends should be the
happy Man you like? And must I be a
witness of your mutual Satisfaction, whilst
I, condemn'd to silence for ever, must con∣tinue
to adore you, without the least hopes?
Yes, Madam, yes, <HI>added he,</HI> I adore you
ever since that fatal Day, when the King
sent me with Fire-Arms to fetch you out of
<PB N="407" REF="268"/>
the little Garden at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> Your
Eyes gave me some irresistible Wounds;
instead of wounding you, according to my
orders; I return'd with a Heart pier∣ced
in a thousand places. You were
then no more than a Child, a light wild
Butterfly; what reason was there to en∣tertain
you with a Passion so violent, as
made my Sufferings almost insupportable? As
you increased in Beauty, so my Love grew
more violent: I paid you a thousand Ho∣mages
in private, I sent forth a thou∣sand
Sighs, but durst not discover them,
being quite startled at your Quality of be∣ing
a Princess of the Blood. What would
become of me, said I, if the D. of <HI>Rich∣mond,</HI>
or the King, being inform'd of my
Passion, should command the Dutchess ne∣ver
to look upon me? Or, what should I
do, if she should receive me with Indigna∣tion,
and punish my Temerity with Hatred?
I must certainly languish to death under
this cruel Destiny. At last, judging that
absence might prove the only Remedy a∣gainst
my Pain, I marry'd, and carry'd my
Wife into the Country: But having no
great inclination for her, I proved contra∣dictory
and opposite to every thing she liked;
so that after having spent some time to
render us both miserable, we parted. By
way of amusement I engaged with Mrs.
<HI>L—g,</HI> she being of a sweet and pliable
Disposition, I forbore seeing you, Madam,
I never spoke of you; so that if I was not
perfectly cured, yet my Distemper was,
<PB N="408" REF="269"/>
however, much abated. Your Widow∣hood,
your stay in <HI>France,</HI> the Troubles
and Changes in this Kingdom; all these
things, I say, did take up my Thoughts.
Alas! what are you going to do here?
You are come to open afresh my Wounds,
and to convince me that your Heart is not
insensible of a Man of merits; that to gain
your good opinion, one need not court al∣ways
the Quality of Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> and
<HI>Richmond;</HI> and that, had I pursu'd the
true Rules of Love, had I been more bold,
and had I, during so long a time since,
devoted myself to you, discover'd my Sen∣timents,
'tis possible, out of Acknowledg∣ment,
out of your Goodness, or perhaps
also moved by your Reason, or out of Ca∣priciousness,
you might have done that for
me which you do for another. He has, 'tis
true, more Merit, but is not superior to
me either in Estate or Birth, and does not
come near me in Love. See, Madam, see
here is the true cause of my Despair, which
must render me unfortunate all the days of
my life.</P>
<P>Know, Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> said the Dutchess
with a fierce Air, enough to strike him
dead, that I reproach myself for ha∣ving
suffer'd you to speak so long; but
as the novelty of the thing surpriz'd me,
so it has made me altogether silent. I
leave you, and forbid you ever to speak
to me again. With these Words, and
a most disdainful Look, she flew out
of the Closet, leaving him under the most
<PB N="409" REF="270"/>
cruel Torments that ever he felt in his
Life.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> had no sooner perceiv'd
the Fire, but all his Care was to look after
the Dutchess to allay her Fear. He run
into her Chamber, but not meeting with
her there, he call'd her by her Name,
but in vain; so imagining she was gone
down Stairs, he look'd for her in every
Corner, till at last he espy'd her in the
Court; and coming nearer to her, found
immediately some Disturbance in her
Countenance, which he attributed to her
Fright. I will leave the House, said she,
this moment, and return to <HI>London.</HI> How,
Madam, cry'd he, will you go hence
without making me happy? Won't you
accomplish what you were resolv'd to do
for me? I will accomplish it, said she,
but never in this House, for I look upon
this Fire as ominous. Oh! Madam, re∣ply'd
Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> who knew nothing of
the matter, Fire is an Emblem of Joy and
Mirth; we are not to fight a Battel, nor
to take Towns, the whole is nothing but
a meer Accident. But the Dutchess not
hearkning to his Reasons, they left the
House immediately to concert new Mea∣sure
for their Marriage.</P>
<P>No sooner had the Dutchess left Mr.
<HI>Porter</HI> in his Closet, but running from
one Extream to another, from his Lan∣guishing
to the most furious Passion that
can be imagined, he look'd upon Mr.
<HI>Howard</HI> no more as his intimate Friend,
<PB N="410" REF="271"/>
but as his Rival, who was going to rob
him of what he thought he had right
to challenge for himself. During these
first furious motions, he thought of no
less than how to satisfy his Revenge, to
punish the Dutchess for her scornful
Looks, and to kill both himself and her
Lover before her face. With this inten∣tion
he arose in order to find him out:
But then considering that so barbarous and
violent a Proceeding would be exclaim'd
against by all the World, and that accor∣ding
to all the Rules of Decency, he
could not assault a Man who had put
himself into his hands; the consideration
of his Honour was more prevailing than
his Anger, and so for a moment resolv'd
to suspend the execution. But so soon as
he reflected again, that the Marriage was
going to be consummated, Jealousy re∣possess'd
his Heart, he left his Room
with a full resolution to stab, in a thousand
places, a Person, in whose defence, upon
any other occasion, he would have sacri∣fic'd
his Life. Most surprizing effects of
Love! This Passion reigns with so uncon∣trolable
a Power over our Hearts, that no∣thing
is left us to appease it; and we see
the greatest Hero's betray their Frailty in
this kind, no less than the meanest Pea∣sant.
He was moving forward with the
greatest precipitation, when meeting with
his Mistress, she told him, the Dutchess
and Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> were gone. He seem'd
to be somewhat better satisfy'd at their
<PB N="411" REF="272"/>
departure. And now beginning to reflect
more seriously upon what he had design'd
to do, and calling all the remaining
strength of his Reason to his aid, he took
a resolution not to appear again at Court,
till he were entirely rid of his Love.</P>
<P>He continu'd in this voluntary Exile for
several Years, till he was forced to come
to <HI>London</HI> on account of his Daughter,
nam'd <HI>Olympia,</HI> who being very young and
handsom, and educated there, had made
a Conquest of the Heart of my Lord—,
whose Birth, Merits, Wit and Estate was
such, as made him be look'd upon as one
of the chiefest Men at Court; for an Affair
of this nature. This is the same who in
1667; being engag'd in a Quarrel at the
Play-House at <HI>Paris</HI> with some Officers
of the King's Guards, they fell upon him
several at a time; so that tho' he fought
like a Lion, they run him through in di∣vers
places, and left him for dead upon
the spot. The King being resolv'd to
make them a severe example of his Ju∣stice,
my Lord no sooner understood it,
but neglecting the care of his own Life,
to preserve his Enemies, caus'd himself
to be carried to <HI>Versailles</HI> to intercede for
them: which he did so effectually and
generously, that he obtain'd their Pardon
from the King.</P>
<P><HI>Olympia</HI> lov'd him as tenderly as her own
Life, and she was no less belov'd by him.
But Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> vex'd to the Soul at this
Intreague, without much pondering upon
<PB N="412" REF="273"/>
the matter, resolv'd to break off a Corre∣spondency,
wherein his own Honour and
his Daughter's Reputation was so nearly
concern'd. With this Resolution he
comes to <HI>London,</HI> and being one day in
<HI>Hide-Park,</HI> the first thing he casts his
Eyes upon, happen'd to be <HI>Olympia,</HI> in
her Lover's Coach. His Anger being rais'd
to the highest pitch at so unexpected an
Accident, he leaps out of his own Coach,
and running with Sword in hand to that
wherein she was, would have kill'd her
without mercy, had not the Coach-Man
drove away at full speed, and so saved
her Life. The Earl of—being in∣form'd
of this Adventure, and dreading
the effects of so violent and furious a Re∣sentment
might fall upon my Lord—,
he found out <HI>Olympia,</HI> who being still
under dreadful apprehensions of her
Father's Anger, the Earl promised her a
considerable annual Pension if she would
break off all farther Commerce with his
Son; and representing to her the Danger
unto which they must expose themselves
if they continu'd to see one another, she
resolved to go privately into <HI>France,</HI> where
she was honourably maintain'd by the
Earl, pursuant to his Promise.</P>
<P>I will not insist, at present, to give you
an account of what Troubles her absence
caused to my Lord; he being a Person
very well qualify'd for a Lover; the loss
of one Mistress was soon repair'd by an∣other,
who cost him as dear as this.
<PB N="413" REF="274"/>
As to Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> he always lodg'd at
Dr. <HI>F—r</HI> when he came to <HI>London;</HI>
who had been for a considerable time the
Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s Physician. It
happened one night that Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> be∣ing
seized with an Apoplexy, which put
his Lady and the whole House into no
small Confusion, they sent Servant after
Servant to fetch the Doctor. But the
Dutchess, impatient of all delay, and hur∣ried
on with Grief, lays hold of a Flam∣beaux,
without making the least re∣flexion
upon what the World might say
of her being seen in the Streets. She run
strait to the Doctor's House, covered on∣ly
with a loose Night-Gown, in Slippers,
and without Stockings. Her Servants, that
were sent before, having already got the
Doctor's Door to be open'd, and the
Dutchess entring the House without
knocking run, during this Consternation,
to the first Chamber, where she found a
Key. Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> being awaken'd at the
noise, opens his Curtains; but never was
a Man more surpriz'd than he, to see the
Dutchess almost naked, coming into his
Chamber at that time of the Night; and
when he suppos'd she but little thought
of him. It run in his head she was
Dead, and came to communicate some∣thing
to him. If, said he to himself,
our Souls have a perfect knowledge of
what passes after their separation from
our Bodies, she has discover'd the very
bottom of my Heart, and traced the in∣delible
<PB N="414" REF="275"/>
Characters she herself has engra∣ven
there, and she has pitch'd upon me,
before all the rest that loved her, as him
who loved her most. But besides, that he
had but a slender faith in Spirit, he cou'd
not conceive how the Dutchess cou'd ap∣pear
so handsome after she was Dead.
He saw the sprightliness of her Eyes, the
lustre of her Complexion, her fair Hair,
some Locks whereof hung out under her
Night-cloaths, her majestick Air, and her
own Voice; which at once reach'd his
Ears and his Heart: All these were such
lively Circumstances, as had no relation
to a dead Person. He stood amazed,
without saying one word, when she came
flying into his Arms. Oh! Doctor, said
she, is it possible you should be asleep
when poor Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> is at his last gasp?
Come, in God's name, go along with me,
let's not lose one moment. Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI>
grasping her in his Arms; O cruel and
barbarous Dutchess, said he, you whom
Fortune has deliver'd into my hands to
revenge myself of your Disdain, don't
think I will let slip so favourable an op∣portunity.
When she found it was Mr. <HI>Por∣ter;</HI>
she stood like one in a Trance; how∣ever,
soon recovering herself, with a singu∣lar
presence of Mind, told him, What
will you go about to disoblige me, and be
beholden to so violent an Action for what
you may expect from your own Merits?
I am sensibly affected with your Constan∣cy,
and your Respect will compleat the
<PB N="415" REF="276"/>
conquest of my Heart. You see whether
my Duty calls me, my Spouse is a dying,
don't detain me any longer, and believe
that this proof of your Respect will
make a more sensible impression upon me
than if you put a Crown on my Head:
But if you are able to forget what you
owe to me, I shall turn furious, and cry
out with such violence, as will soon draw
those to my assistance, that will be able
to snatch me out of your Hands. Mr. <HI>Por∣ter</HI>
was divided betwixt Fear and Hope,
not knowing what resolution best to take;
he questioned not, but if he let the Dut∣chess
go, he should scarce meet with the
same opportunity again; but he dreaded
the Noise, and much more her Anger. So
he told her, that tho' he was sure she
would prove ungrateful, he wou'd prefer
all these Hardships before the Favours
he might obtain against her Will. The
Dutchess taking him in the humour, goes
out of his Room, and meeting the Doctor
as he was coming out of his own Cham∣ber,
desired him to make haste to her
House.</P>
<P>She was no sooner got out of Mr. <HI>Por∣ter</HI>'s
sight, but he began to repent of his
Obedience; What cou'd make me to act
in such a manner? cry'd he, she is gone,
a barbarous Woman, as she is, and now
laughs in the face of the whole World at
my Submission. It now comes to pass,
what I foresaw before, the Dutchess will
tell it to Madam of <HI>B</HI>—, and she to
<PB N="416" REF="277"/>
another. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Passion will be the sub∣ject
of the Discourse of the whole Court,
and every one will divert himself with it,
according to his own Humour. Being al∣most
reduced to Despair, he understood
that the Dutchess, with some other Ladies,
were to go to <HI>Windsor.</HI> Thither he went al∣so,
with a resolution of reproaching her
with the injustice he thought he had recei∣ved
at her hands. But how great is the
Power and Charms of fair Eyes! She had
no sooner turn'd hers towards him, with
something a more pleasant Air than she
commonly used to do, but he thought
himself sufficiently happy; and renoun∣cing
his Country Retirement, and appears
as great a Courtier as ever. In the mean
while, the Dutchess jeers him without in∣termission.
He says, he is come out of
Spite, but I believe his Hatred is nothing
else but Love; and that, notwithstanding
all his Protestations upon that head, he
still loves her.</P>
<P>And I, said the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
believe he does not. But to tell you the
truth, are you not asham'd to have given
us such a prolix History of what you
might have told us in a few Words? You
have spent above half an hour in talking,
and tho' what you said was very good,
yet I thought you might have been a lit∣tle
shorter. You might have silenced me
when you were tired of it, said the
Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI> in a grave tone; and
when I speak before you another time, I
<PB N="417" REF="278"/>
will be sure to remember the Lesson you
have given me to day. You take me
wrong, said the Duke, interrupting him,
and it seems as if you did not apprehend:
I only intended to jest with you. To pu∣nish
you, I will continue my former Dis∣course,
but I swear to you I don't know
where I left off, or where I am, unless
you help me a little into the way again.
You were upon the point of going with the
Dutchess of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Donna Maria
de Balboza</HI> to <HI>Sion-hill,</HI> said the Earl
of <HI>A—n,</HI> so that you may begin with
this Journey. 'Tis true, said I, I manag'd
the matter so dexterously, that my Spouse
was very glad I should have the honour
of this Feast, being well pleased to be rid
of the charge: For tho' I give her a year∣ly
Allowance for Cloaths and other neces∣sary
Expences, enough to maintain a Prin∣cess
of the Blood, she is always very rea∣dy
to put any thing of that nature upon
me. A Man that has such a yearly Re∣venue
as you have, said the E. of S. <HI>Albans,</HI>
may well afford it, and it would be ridi∣culous
for you, who are one of the chief∣est
Men in <HI>England,</HI> to see your Spouse
appear without a suitable Magnificence at
Court.</P>
<P>It seem'd to me, said the Duke, that
our going to <HI>Sion-hill</HI> would prove more
pleasant by Water than by Land; so I
took care to have our Barges adorn'd with
rich Furniture, the Watermen that row'd
us being dress'd in the Habits of <HI>Moors,
<PB N="418" REF="279"/>
Indians, Turks, Peasants, Slaves</HI> and <HI>Sa∣vages,</HI>
for the better Diversion of the
Company. On both sides of our B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ges
we were attended with smaller Boats,
painted and gil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> full of Shepherds and
Shepherdesses, who sung to us certain
Country Tunes, whilst the Syrens and
Nymphs, placed in some other Boats,
play'd upon their Flutes and Hautb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys.
All the Boats were strew'd with Flowers;
and the Weather was so fair, as proved
extreamly delightful. The young <HI>Balboza</HI>
had never been at any Entertainment that
promis'd better in its beginning. Whilst
we were upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> I talk'd to her
as often as I had an opportunity. I ob∣serv'd
her to blush when she return'd me
an Answer, and to cast down her Eyes as
often as mine were fix'd upon hers; but
when she saw me engag'd another way,
she turn'd her Eyes upon me. At our
landing place we were met by divers Cha∣riots,
order'd for that purpose; each of
which holding no more than two Persons
at a time, the Ladies were for keeping
together; but this being opposed by us,
every Gentleman took a Lady, and I ma∣nag'd
the matter so, that <HI>Balboza</HI> fell to
my share. It being not above two Miles
from the River side to <HI>Sion hill,</HI> all what
I could do to spin out the Time, was to
order them to drive slowly; and for fear
notice might be taken of it if I did so a∣lone,
all the rest did the like, attended by
the Flutes and Violins.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="280"/>
But you will perhaps be surpriz'd when
I tell you, that I was so far <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pifi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with
Fear, that I durst not improve th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se fa∣vourable
Moments to make my Addresses
to the fair <HI>Portugueze.</HI> She did not dis∣close
her Thoughts to me upon that head.
For, as in her native Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y they meet
but seldom with such like Opportunities,
so they scarce ever let them slip; and she
was at a st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d unto what cause to attri∣bute
this Silence, which was often inter∣rupted
by my Eyes. You are very pen∣sive,
my Lord, said she, with a kind of
melancholy Air; without doubt your
Thoughts are taken up with Affairs of
great moment the King has thought fit
to intrust you with. Whilst a Man, said
I, is with you, he can scarce think of
State Affairs. I have, Madam, such
things to manage as concern me much
nearer, but am afraid of displeasing you.
<HI>Balboza</HI> gave me no answer; but changing
the Discourse, began to touch upon the
fairness of the Weather, and some other
indifferent Matters. I was surpriz'd to
see her so indifferent after having herself
given the first occasion of declaring my
Love. By this time we came to the place
where our Feast was prepar'd; which I
can assure you was so well contriv'd, that
there has scarce been an Entertainment for
a long time which surpass'd this, either
in Gallantry or good Attendance.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="281"/>
<HI>Balboza,</HI> who very well perceiv'd it
was made for her sake, being affected
with a secret Satisfaction, could not for∣bear
to discover it sometimes. I walk'd
for a considerable time with her in the
Wood; where, being become more bold
by our Solitude, I began to urge her to
permit me to offer all my Vows and Ser∣vices
to her. I am ignorant, said she,
whether it is a receiv'd custom here, as it is
in my Country, for the Court Ladies to have
their publick Lovers, whether they are
married or not, who perform a thousand
Gallantries in their behalf, and that in the
face of the whole Court, without the
least blemish to their Reputation; if this
is the Mode here, I am very willing to
accept you for my Gallant, and am over∣joy'd
to see so deserving a Person, and of
so high a Rank in the World, to devote his
Services to me. I'll tell you, Madam, reply'd
I, we are something nicer here than the
<HI>Portugueze,</HI> and we making the chief
Pleasure of our Passions to consist in Se∣crecy,
'tis sufficient for us to let our Mi∣stresses
be acquainted with our Sentiments,
without communicating them to the
whole Court. If you will give me leave
to love you, you shall be my only Confi∣dent,
and you shall not have the least rea∣son
to be dissatisfy'd with my Conduct.
She answer'd me not one Word, but fetch∣ing
several deep Sighs, continu'd silent for
a long time. At last, said I, Oh, Ma∣dam,
what means this Silence! what
<PB N="421" REF="282"/>
these Sighs! Are you in love at <HI>Lisbon,</HI>
or in <HI>London?</HI> I have read a small No∣vel
you bestow'd upon the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
I have read certain things there
which would perhaps have scarce been
observ'd by one less interested than
myself. I am not ignorant that your
Charms have gain'd you more than one
Adorer in our Court. I must intreat you
to speak sincerely, to let me know my
Destiny. You are too urging, said she, I
scarce know you very well, and you would
have me disclose my most secret Thoughts
to you. I am a Man of Honour, reply'd
I, and as I know I can keep any Secret
of yours, so I conjure you not to delay
any longer to lay open your whole Heart
to me. But, said she, won't you be sur∣priz'd
if you should find yourself there
already better placed than you imagine?
Oh, Madam, said I, throwing myself at
her feet, don't flatter me with a Happiness
unless it be a real one: Let me know,
without delay, what I have to hope or
to fear; deal sincerely with a Person
who will never fail to repay you with
tenderness and acknowledgment. What
would you know, reply'd she with an
obliging Air? I find I must tell you. Tell
me then, said I, whether there has been
as yet a Man in the World whom you
liked? Yes, reply'd she. And, conti∣nu'd
I, is this happy Man in <HI>England?</HI>
No, said she. Then own, said I, that it
is the same Person whom <HI>Camilla</HI> loved at
<PB N="422" REF="283"/>
<HI>Lucea.</HI> 'Tis true, reply'd she. And you
are then, said I, the <HI>Camilla</HI> of the Novel
I saw? I am so, said she. Oh, Madam,
cry'd I, you make me despair. And why?
return'd she: Are not you sufficiently de∣serving
to ruin the good Fortune of an
absent Lover? What is my Rival's
Name? continued I. <HI>Don Alvare,</HI> said
she. He is born of an illustrious but poor
Family, and it is by reason of their slen∣der
Fortune they are not much taken notice
of; and it is that that raised my Father's
Anger against him, and which obliged
him to intercede with the Queen of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
to accept of me among her Ladies of
Honour. I return'd her many Thanks for
her Sincerity, and the hopes she had gi∣ven
me▪ that in time my Services might
meet with a favourable reception; and I
assure you, I made it my business in good
earnest to serve her.</P>
<P>The Countess of—did not dream
in the least, that after having loved her
with so much tenderness, I should be in
a condition to engage in another Passion.
Her capricious Humour she look'd upon
as a refin'd piece of Courtesy, for which,
according to her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pinion, I should have
thought myself obliged to her. When
she sound me without the least uneasiness,
and that I look'd upon her with indiffe∣rency,
she judged the best way to make
me return, was to choose such another
Lover as might appear a dangerous Rival
to me. But being obliged to carry on
<PB N="423" REF="284"/>
this new Intreague with the D. of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI>
(for it was he she cast her Eyes
upon) with a great deal of secrecy, by
reason of her Husband, I heard nothing
of the matter. In the mean while, being
so far prepossess'd with my young <HI>Bal∣boza</HI>'s
Beauty that I could not at all
times controul my Passion, they began to
talk of it at Court, and the Countess
was the first who made her Jests of it.
The Queen, as you know, being a Prin∣cess
of the strictest Vertue in the World,
did not fail to take <HI>Balboza</HI> to task, and
to represent to her the danger that atten∣ded
her seeing me, and suffering my
Courtship. You are young and innocent,
said she; you are handsom and of good
Extraction; you may promise yourself,
that if your Father thinks fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to see you
settl'd in <HI>England,</HI> you shall have my
Protection, and marry some considerable
Person, provided your Conduct is such
as it ought to be: But if you are so un∣fortunate
as to love the D. of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
unto what M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>series won't you expose
yourself? He being a married Man, you
must needs lose your Reputation in the
World, I shall despise you, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Father
will h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e you, and you will meet with
as many Misfortunes then as you may
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe for good Fortune now.</P>
<P>How weak are these Remoustrances,
when a Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is prepossess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with a grow∣ing
Passion? The Queen might say what
she pleas'd, and as often as she talk'd to
<PB N="424" REF="285"/>
her, <HI>Balboza</HI> told me she found her Ten∣derness
for me increase most sensibly;
I could have often pray'd the Queen
to torment her, because it turn'd to my
infinite Satisfaction. The Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI>
whom I made my Confident, seeing me
thus wholy taken up with <HI>Balboza,</HI> would
sometimes put me in mind, what Vexa∣tion
I was likely to cause to the Queen.
But that came too late, these Reflexions
finding but little access in my Heart and
Mind; so that both her and my Conduct
were equally censured by the Court Cri∣ticks.</P>
<P>One day, having miss'd to see her,
she writ to me, She had something of
moment to impart to me. I went to
see her, and she told me with a de∣jected
Countenance; I will not make
a Secret in which you are nearly con∣cern'd
in my regard: Know, my Lord,
<HI>Don Alvare</HI> is in this Country. Never
was any body more surprized nor more
put to a <HI>nonplus</HI> than I. He assur'd me,
that having understood how my Father
had sent me into <HI>England,</HI> he resolv'd to
follow me thither; and, to defray the
Charges of his Voyage, and to appear
like himself at Court, he had sold all the
remainder of his Estate. Judge you, con∣tinu'd
she, what a condition I was in?
<HI>Don Alvare</HI> seem'd to me at <HI>London</HI> so
far different from what he appear'd to be
at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> that I could scarce afford him
one Look. 'Tis you, said she, 'tis you
<PB N="425" REF="286"/>
who is the cause of it. Oh, Madam, re∣ply'd
I, don't repent of it, you don't
cultivate an ungrateful Soil, and I hope
you will never have the least occasion of
relenting at your having given to me the
preference before <HI>Don Alvare.</HI> He be∣gins
already, said she, to be sensible of
the change of my Mind, by my deport∣ment
towards him; he seems to be
much concern'd thereat, and I am
much at a stand how to manage Matters
with him: For, if I check him absolute∣ly
in his Addresses, and he finds out
the reason, he may perhaps, moved
with Despair, give notice thereof to
my Father; and if I engage him to stay
here, judge what a troublesom Guardian
he will prove to us, as if I had not enough
of these already, I begg'd her not to be
too much disturb'd, and that I wou'd con∣sider
what was the best to be done upon
this occasion.</P>
<P>Coming to pay my Respects to the
King, I there saw <HI>Don Alvare,</HI> who had
been presented to his Majesty by the Queen.
Tho' I did not look upon him with a
very good Eye, yet I must own he was
a handsom Person; and you having seen
him yourself, said I, to the Earl of St. <HI>Al∣bans,</HI>
I will not enlarge myself upon his
goodly Mien and Wit, neither wou'd I
pursue the consequence of this Adventure,
wherewith you are as well acquainted as
myself, but that the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI>
being then in <HI>Ireland,</HI> ought not to be
<PB N="426" REF="287"/>
kept out of the Secret. I accosted <HI>Don
Alvare,</HI> who told me, he had been travel∣ling
for some Months, and our Court be∣ing
one of the finest in <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rope,</HI> he cou'd
not forgo to see it, without reproaching
himself; and tho' he had been only two
Days here, he was so extreamly taken
with it, that he intended his stay should
be longer here than in all others to∣gether.
You may easily imagine the
answer I made was far different from
my Thoughts; but Strangers being regard∣ed
in some measure by me, as sacred, I
cou'd not think of giving any Offence
to a Person who made so good an appea∣rance,
and who being without Protection
in <HI>England,</HI> it pity'd me he should have
the misfortune to light in my way, and
that he shou'd sell his Estate for an un∣faithful
Mistress, who had taken an An∣tipathy
against him.</P>
<P><HI>Balboza,</HI> who was of a quick Appre∣hension,
did not fail, the very next time
I spoke to her, to ask me, Whether I had
consider'd of a way to bring her out of this
<HI>Dilemma?</HI> I told her, I had thought of
it, but it wou'd be better to let it go on
for a few Days, that the thing might ap∣pear
the more natural. Good God! crys
she, methinks I cou'd wish you far enough:
Do you so little dread the loss of my
Heart? You don't hate <HI>Don Alvare,</HI> nay
you have been so imprudent, as to com∣mend
him before my face. You are very
careless to maintain what ought to be sa∣cred
<PB N="427" REF="288"/>
to you. Awakened by these Reproa∣ches,
I told her, How will you charge me
with want of tender<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess to your Person?
Is it possible you shou'd be so little ac∣quainted
with the real Sentiments of my
Heart, as to suspect it in this manner as
you do? 'Tis true, I am satisfy'd you
will prove true to me, this is the effect of
that good opinion I have of you; and
supposing it were the consequence also
of the opinion I have of my Deserts, you
wou'd not quarrel upon that score. Wou'd
you have me be jealous of a Person whom
you sacrifice to me? Yes, I wou'd have
you be so, cry'd the, and were you born
in <HI>Portugal,</HI> you wou'd not have stay'd so
long to be reproach'd upon that account
by me. You are too fall of Presumption,
<HI>My Lord,</HI> you think one can't change you
for another; but know, People are some∣times
much deceiv'd. I was not a little
startled at these words. Do you intend to
ruin me, Madam, said I? Have I deserved
such cruel Menaces at your hands? Since
<HI>Don Alvare</HI>'s Presence is so odious to you,
let me measure Swords with him; per∣haps
I may be so fortunate as to deliver
you from it. God forbid, cry'd she, your
Life is too dear to me to expose it thus
upon any account whatever; but let me
alone, I'll contrive a way to make him
depart. She spoke not one word more up∣on
that Head.</P>
<P>A whole Month pass'd, during which,
she was so far from shewing the least cold∣ness
<PB N="428" REF="289"/>
to <HI>Don Alvare,</HI> which might give
him the least suspicion of her sinister in∣tentions,
that on the contrary she gave
him peculiar marks of her Friendship,
and he appear'd so gay and brisk, that
sometimes I cou'd not forbear to re∣proach
<HI>Balboza,</HI> which she only answered
with laughing, to justifie her Proceedings.
There was at that time much talk at
Court of a certain <HI>India</HI> Ship very richly
laden, lately come into the <HI>Thames;</HI> eve∣ry
one went to see it; and <HI>Balboza</HI> having
got an exact information of the time
when she was to return to the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
sends for the Captain when <HI>Don
Alvare</HI> was at her Lodgings. The Cap∣tain
coming thither, she discours'd him
in private, and bidding him to view
<HI>Don Alvara</HI> very well, she told him,
he was a Slave of hers, but grown so in∣solent,
that she was not able to endure
him any longer; for he wou'd sit down
by her, and be as familiar with her, as if
she had not redeem'd him from his Chains,
or as if it were not in her power to put
them on again at pleasure. If you will
have him, I will dispose of him very
cheap; you may take him along with you,
and dispose of him as you think fit. But
<HI>England</HI> being a free Country, and that,
if you take him by force, he may make a
noise, I will send him aboard your Ship,
and so you may keep him. The Captain
being very well satisfy'd with <HI>Balboza</HI>'s
Proposition, agreed with her for the Price,
<PB N="429" REF="290"/>
and she promised to bring him abroad the
next Day.</P>
<P>This done, she told <HI>Don Alvare</HI> she
intended to buy some <HI>Indian</HI> Goods, and
intended to take nobody along with her a∣board
the Ship but himself and her waiting
Women. He being overjoy'd to go along
with her, they set out from <HI>Whitehall;</HI>
and as they were going along, (as I am in∣form'd
by one of her <HI>Portuguze</HI> Women)
she caress'd this poor unhappy Lover to
the highest degree. Ships of a great bulk
ride always at Anchor at such a distance
from the Shoar, that there is no coming
at them, but by the help of a Boat. As
they were ready to go into it, she
cry'd she was afraid of being sick,
and much more of the Water, it being
somewhat blustery Weather; and there∣fore
desir'd <HI>Don Alvare</HI> to buy her what
she wanted, offering to give him Money
for that use. But, poor Lover, tho' he
had sufficient reason to save his Money,
being in a strange Country, and without
any hopes of farther Supplies out of his
Estate; yet was overjoy'd of having
met with this opportunity of making her
some very valuable Presents. She having
seated herself on an Eminency, with
her Women, not far from the Shoar,
cou'd from thence see all that pass'd in
the Ship. Scarce had <HI>Don Alvare</HI> got
one Foot on Ship-board, but they sent back
the Boat which had carry'd him thither.
The Captain told him, at the same
<PB N="430" REF="291"/>
time, that he having bought him of
<HI>Balboza,</HI> he was now his Slave. You may
guess at his Surprize, and the Rage it
put him into. He protested, in vain. <HI>Bal∣boza</HI>
had no power over him; his Words
were spoken into the Air; so that, reduc'd
to the utmost Despair, he resolv'd, with
Sword in hand, to sell his Life at the
dearest rate. But being overpower'd, they
clapt this miserable Wretch in Irons. <HI>Bal∣boza</HI>
having <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed her Eyes with so pitiful
a Spectacle, return'd to <HI>London;</HI> and
sent me word she desir'd to speak with
me.</P>
<P>Having receiv'd the whole Account of
this Matter from her own Mouth, I stood
amaz'd thereat, to such a degree, as to
want Words to express my Sentiments.
How, thought I to myself, <HI>Balboza,</HI> can'st
thou carry thy Aversion to such a pitch,
against a Person who was once so dear
to thee, and who has committed no other
fault than to love thee faithfully, and
to follow thee! How! coud'st thou sell
an unhappy Lover, who sold all his
Estate he had left in the World, to give
thee fresh Proofs of his Passion, and that
without having given thee the least occa∣sion
of Complaint; and after all this,
treat'st him worse than if he were thy
most cruel Enemy! <HI>Balboza</HI> was not a
little surpriz'd at my Silence, and being
Mistress of a singular Penetration and vi∣vacity
of Wit, she soon guess'd at the rea∣son
of my present Disturbance. So that
<PB N="431" REF="292"/>
without giving me any farther leisure to
recover myself, or to return an Answer,
she said, O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>! I see very well, your Ri∣val
is dearer to you than your Mistress;
what I have done, ought to be to you a
convincing proof of the preference I give
you before <HI>Don Alvare;</HI> but this does lit∣tle
affect you, who have Compa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion for
him, but want Acknowlegement for me.
Oh, Madam, cry'd I, Was there no other
way to be rid of him, but to send him
to the <HI>Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es?</HI> How cou'd you prepare
such heavy Chains for a Person who was
yours already? Cou'd you put such heavy
Fetters on a Man who had so little deserv'd
it? and cou'd you see them without Com∣passion?
Let his Fortune prove as it will,
he was a Man of Sense, and of good Ex∣traction:
These Qualifications alone, if
you had had no other reasons, ought they
not to have been prevailing enough with
you, to put a stop to your design? Why
wou'd not you ask my Advice, at the be∣ginning
of an Affair, whereof you now tell
me the Consequences?</P>
<P><HI>Balboza</HI> saw very well that I made
most severe Reflexions upon her treacherous
Action. She was vex'd at the Heart to
find so little Complaisance in me, that in∣stead
of applauding, I blam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d her with so
much freedom, she was ready to die with
Spite and Anger; and in this humour,
told me a thousand reflecting things; and
wou'd have gon on farther, had not a
sudden Swelling in her Throat stopt her
<PB N="432" REF="293"/>
Mouth. I left her as much dissatisfy'd as
she cou'd be for her life; and whilst she
was taking care of her Health, I for my
part, sent immediately to fetch <HI>Don Al∣vare</HI>
from aboard the <HI>India</HI> Vessel; but,
as ill fortune wou'd have it, they having
set sail before, my Endeavours for his Li∣berty
prov'd fruitless. Whatever Pains I
took to conceal from <HI>Belboza</HI> the regret
I had of giving her so harsh a Treatment,
I cou'd not so far disguise my self, but,
that she very well perceiv'd the Matter.
On the other hand, the Countess, who
had a mind to see me once more wear
her Chains, never met me without pay∣ing
to me some peculiar marks of her Re∣spect;
which hitherto I have return'd but
in an indifferent manner; tho', as my Pas∣sion
for the fair <HI>Portuguze</HI> began to a∣bate,
that which I felt for the Countess
gather'd new strength. I was strangely
puzl'd with different, violent and con∣trary
Passions; Oblig'd to avoid a Per∣son
who had treated me ill, oblig'd to
court one who, according to her opinion,
had ventur'd every thing for me, in send∣ing
<HI>Don Alvare</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and that at
a juncture when I had not the same in∣difference
for the first, nor the same incli∣nations
for the other, which I had hither∣to
prescrib'd myself as certain rules of
my Duty I can't express my Sufferings
under this Perplexity, till I was deliver'd
from it by a certain Accident.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="294"/>
I told you before, that <HI>Balboza,</HI> when
she sent <HI>Alvare</HI> aboard the <HI>Indian</HI> Ship,
was attended only by two of her Women.
These highly compassionated the fate of
<HI>Alvare;</HI> and tho' their Mistress enjoyn'd
them Secrecy, and they promised it; yet
they kept it no longer than their good un∣derstanding
lasted, which prov'd of no long
continuance. For <HI>Balboza</HI> happening to
fall out with them about some frivolous
Matter, they told all they knew. The
whole Matter being divulg'd at Court,
and the Queen especially having taken
an exact account of it, (<HI>Alvare</HI> being a
<HI>Portugueze</HI>) she was highly incensed a∣gainst
<HI>Balboza;</HI> and as her Conduct had
not been pleasing to her upon several o∣ther
accounts, she wou'd not suffer her to
continue any longer in her Service, and
without any previous notice given her,
(unless it were a few days before) she
caus'd her to be embark'd aboard a Vessel
bound for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to reconduct her to her
Father. But she dreading his Anger, and
his Poison or Dagger, found means to get
out of the Ship, and returning to <HI>London</HI>
under another Name, marry'd some ob∣scure
Person, and remain'd unknown to
the Court for a considerable time after.
Such a parting as this wou'd have cost me
very dear, if I had loved <HI>Balboza</HI> as well as
I cou'd have done, without her treacherous
Heart. For you are sensible, my Lord of
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> added I, she was worthy of
being beloved, and that her whole De∣portment
<PB N="434" REF="295"/>
was so engaging, as to prove al∣most
irrefistible. But now I parted with
her without Tears, and began to bend all
my Thoughts upon ways and means how
to be reconciled to the Countess's Fa∣vour.</P>
<P>The D. of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with whom she
was engaged in a secret Correspondence,
being tir'd with an Intreague he was oblig'd
to conceal, soon threw off his Fetters after
they became heavy and troublesom to him.
As she, on the other hand, finding his In∣constancy,
was very willing to afford me
all opportunities of justifying myself. I
own'd, without hesitating in the Matter,
I had loved <HI>Balboza,</HI> but that it was
she that had forced me so to do; because
I cou'd not, I thought, pitch upon a more
proper remedy to cure me of my Passion
for her; that if she wou'd consider, without
prejudice, the ill Treatment I receiv'd at
<HI>Tunbridge</HI> from her, she wou'd soon be
convinc'd, that these were not the right
methods to keep a faithful Lover. She
reproach'd me in her turn with Haughti∣ness,
and with having left her so abrupt∣ly
in the Wood. Whither I was in the
right or not, said she, you ought to have
shewn more Submission, and to have en∣deavour'd
by your Complaisance to con∣vince
me of your Passion, which you had
sworn to me by so many Oaths. I ask'd
her Pardon, and clear'd myself as to
what had been told her concerning my
<PB N="435" REF="296"/>
Passion for the Countess of <HI>Grimbergue;</HI>
and she made so many most obliging Ex∣cuses,
as restor'd in our Hearts an entire
Harmony, to such a degree, that ever
since we have not had the least misun∣derstanding
or reason of Complaint against
one another, till yesterday; when, after
having used all my Interest to pre∣vent
her Husband from carrying her into
<HI>Holland,</HI> she entertain'd me as coldly as
if she had never seen me before. Whether
it be that she is vex'd with herself for
having refus'd the King's offers; or whether
her Passion for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> is
reviv'd; or whether my Lord <HI>R</HI>—
has found out the Secret of pleasing her;
this I am certain of, that she has given
me sufficient reason of Complaint, and
that I shall let slip no opportunity of
revenging myself.</P>
<P>The Duke having left of speaking, the
Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> looking hard at him;
Is it possible, said he, you shou'd be vex'd
at such Trifles? You don't know, as yet,
whether the Countess is in the wrong;
whither she may not have undeniable
Reasons for what she did, and you ought
not to condemn her absolutely, without
being heard. If I was in no worse Condi∣tion,
cry'd the Earl of <HI>A—n,</HI> I shou'd
think myself the happiest of Men; but,
after what I have seen, there is no room
left to doubt of it. And what is it you
have seen, said the Earl of S. <HI>Albans?</HI>
Oh! continu'd he, perfidious Dealings
<PB N="436" REF="297"/>
without Example, want of Conduct and
Faith not to be parallel'd. To be short,
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in a Basket ty'd
to a Rope, let down out of the Window
of <HI>Emilia.</HI> How! has the constant <HI>Emilia</HI>
done you this good turn, said the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham</HI> smiling? I was so unfor∣tunate
as to be an Eye-witness of it, added
the Earl; now judge whether our case
is equal? and whether I don't deserve a
thousand times more Compassion than
you?</P>
<P>I am sorry for your Misfortune, re∣ply'd
the Duke; but, dear Nephew, I
think you have your Deserts; you were
beloved by my Lady—, she was a
Lady worth your care; you prov'd un∣faithful
to her; you are repaid in your
own Coin. Oh! my Lord Duke, added
the Earl, with something of a peevish Coun∣tenance,
you preach what you never pra∣ctis'd
yourself; I know you have left more
Mistresses without cause, than you have
lov'd with good reason. What will you
tell me, return'd the Duke, <HI>I have left
more without cause, than I have lov'd up∣on
good reasons?</HI> It seems to me, that if
I had no reason to love them, I had suffi∣cient
cause to part with them. Your Par∣don,
Sir, continu'd the Earl, for you have
often engag'd your Heart to such Persons
as had not the least pretension to so glori∣ous
a Conquest; notwithstanding which,
you persuaded them of your Passion by a
thousand Oaths, till they belived and
<PB N="437" REF="298"/>
loved you; but no sooner had you made
sure of their Hearts, but you withdrew
yours; then don't deny, but that you
lov'd without reason, and that you left
them without cause. Own to me, that
you wou'd not have been guilty of either,
had you been your own Master. What I
have to say in my own justification, in re∣gard
to my Lady—is, I had an un∣common
Tenderness for her, which insensi∣bly
wore off in spite of all my Endeavours
to the contrary; it was beyond my power
to continue in the same degree of Respect
to her; and she being not ignorant of the
disposition of my Heart, became chagrin
and angry with me. Scarce had I got
clear of this Engagement, when I was
entangled in another; my Heart wou'd
turn Rebel in spite of all my Reason.
The fatal <HI>Emilia</HI> reduc'd me by her
Charms to the most miserable condition
that ever you saw. You are so amorous
and so frail, said the Earl of S. <HI>Albans,</HI>
that I will lay odds, that if she thinks it
worth her trouble, she may see you wear
her Fetters again, and play the Tyrant
more than ever. No, cry'd the Earl, ta∣king
his Hat, and striking it upon the
Table, <HI>no, never whilst I live.</HI></P>
<P>The Stroak happening to light upon a
wooden Case, cover'd with a Carpet, (to
represent a Tablet) it was broken all
to pieces, to the great regret of the
Earls of S. <HI>Albans</HI> and <HI>A—n,</HI> especially
of the last, who had given the Stroak.
<PB N="438" REF="299"/>
But the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> drawing
nearer, and meeting, enclosed within it,
the Portraiture of the Earl of—
done in Wax work, what chance has
brought this Piece into your hands, said
he? A very odd one, reply'd the Earl;
and were you not a declared Enemy to
<HI>Episodes,</HI> I wou'd relate it to you. And
don't you know, my Lord, said the Duke
smiling, that you sometimes take things
in the wrong? Wou'd it not be very unfair
for you to rob your Friends of the liberty
of breaking a Jest? And can you think my
Palate so far out of taste, as not to relish
your Discourse with Satisfaction? I am
so easily inclin'd to believe you, said the
Earl, that notwithstanding all my Rea∣son
tells me I shou'd not, yet I can't for∣bear
it. But, without making any far∣ther
Reflexions upon the Matter, I am
ready to relate to you all the Particulars
of a certain Intreague which you never
knew but in general, and which I was
better acquainted with than any other Per∣son
whatever, by reason of the most strict
Amity that was betwixt the Earl of—
and me; and since the Earl of <HI>A—n</HI>
was too young at that time to be truly
inform'd of this Adventure, I will give
it you in all its Circumstances.</P>
<P>'Tis sufficiently know that the Earl
of—is one of the handsomest and
most lovely Persons of our Court; being,
besides his high Quality, Master of a con∣siderarble
Estate, and generous to an ex∣cess;
<PB N="439" REF="300"/>
we were such intimate Friends,
and so constantly together, that they
call'd us by the Names of <HI>Castor</HI> and
<HI>Pollux,</HI> A certain noted Author, having
written a Tragedy, call'd <HI>Ibrahim,</HI> the
same was acted with great applause; a∣mong
the rest of the Actors, she that
acted <HI>Roxelana</HI> did her Part so exceeding∣ly,
that the Earl of—and I were
charm'd at the sight of it. I observed
he always heightn'd the Praises I bestow'd
upon this Actress, who was from that day
forward known by the Name of <HI>Roxelana.</HI>
And as she was a Person scarce to be
match'd in Beauty and a goodly Mien,
he wonder'd at himself, how he could
look upon her all this while with indif∣ferent
Eyes, and at that moment took a
resolution to love her. The King being
then at the Play, he order'd <HI>Roxelana</HI> to
come to <HI>Whitehall</HI> to act her Part over
again there. The Earl of—was very
diligent to carry her these Orders, and at
the same time offer'd to bring her before
his Majesty. She accepted of his Coach,
and taking one of her Acquaintance along
with her, we went all four into the
Room where the King was to Sup. As
we were going along in the Coach, the
Earl was so full of his Courtship that he
continu'd talking without intermission.
For my part, I could scarce forbear laugh∣ing
when I reflected upon the oddness of
this Passion; having sufficient leisure so
to do, because <HI>Roxelana</HI>'s Friend was so
<PB N="440" REF="301"/>
old and ugly, that I thought silence much
better than what I could expect from her
Conversation.</P>
<P><HI>Roxelana</HI> being dress'd with all the
Lustre of a Queen to gain the Hearts and
Praises of the Auditory, did so graceful∣ly
perform her Part before the King, that
every one was of opinion she needed no
more appear upon the publick Stage.
The Earl of—having conducted her home,
ask'd leave to visit her sometimes. She
told him she should always have a great
Respect for him, but that a young Wo∣man
in her Station could not receive the
Visits of a Person of his Quality without
making herself a Town talk. He told
her, that tho' he look'd upon▪ it as his
greatest Satisfaction to see her often, yet
would he do it with so much reserve,
that she should not have the least reason
of complaint against him. He came to
see me the next day, but so much in love
with <HI>Roxelana,</HI> that he could not speak
one Word but of her. I saw he was ab∣solutely
set, and I knew her Character so
well by hearsay, that I could easily guess
what Game she would be at. If you will
take my word for it, said I to him, don't
follow so far as you do your Inclinations
for a young Woman who will be too hard
for you. Oh, reply'd he, what danger
can there be in it? If she loves Pride,
she shall have what she likes: Has she a
mind to leave the Stage, I will make her
very happy, and be complaisant to her
<PB N="441" REF="302"/>
to the highest degree. I have heard her
represented, reply'd I, as a Person not fit
for love; her Head runs upon making her
Fortune, and that by Marriage. I know
some who have sufficiently been manag'd
by her upon that point. The Earl fell a
laughing, and desiring me to go to the
Play-House, I went along with him. Here he
made his Addresses to <HI>Roxelana,</HI> paid her
afterwards a Visit, and back'd the decla∣ration
of his Love by a rich Present. She
refus'd it with an Air and majestick Look
becoming a Queen; and told him, That
had he known her right, he would not
have gone about to open the way to her
Heart by Presents, these being things that
made no impression upon her. The Earl
answer'd her with a great deal of Respect
and Politeness; tho' he was not a little
disturb'd to find her to assume such an Air
of Grandeur, as would in all likelihood
check the progress of his Love; for Wo∣men
inclin'd to love are of a much easier
access than those of a contrary disposi∣tion.</P>
<P>He gave me an account of all that
pass'd. Will you believe now, said I,
that my meaning is very good? And if
you will take my Advice, you should
engage no farther with her. 'Tis too
late, cry'd he, my Passion is too great to
think of renouncing those ravishing Plea∣sures
I propose to myself in enjoying her.
Perhaps I may meet with more Difficul∣ties
than I suppos'd I should when I first
<PB N="442" REF="303"/>
began to love her; but Love and Con∣stancy
surmount all. You should, reply'd
I, add also your Deserts and your good
Qualifications; no doubt but <HI>Roxelana</HI>
will take them into due Consideration, I
will engage for her. So we parted, and we
met not so often as we used to do; not that
our Friendship was grown cold, but he
was so far infatuated with this young
Woman, that he could scarce be a mo∣ment
without her; and my Business lying
another way, I seldom had an opportu∣nity
of seeing him. One Evening he
came to see me with all the marks of a
distracted Person in his Countenance;
and so in effect he was. He told me that
<HI>Roxelana</HI> kept him at a greater Distance
now than she did the first day he saw her,
and that at that very moment she had
positively declar'd to him, he must not
set one Foot more in her House, unless
he resolv'd to marry her. Judge, added
he, unto what a <HI>nonplus</HI> she has reduc'd
me. I love her like my own life, and
can't live without seeing her; but the
Condition she proposes is so hard, that I
will rather die than submit to it. I con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure
you therefore to advise me what is
best to be done. This is a very puzling
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se, reply'd I; were I less tender of
your Honour, I would be for your marry∣ing
her immediately. You are not in ear∣nest,
said he. No certainly, continu'd I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
But what do you think of it yourself? I
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old you already, added he; I would ra∣ther
<PB N="443" REF="304"/>
run myself through with my own
Sword. I did all I could to make him
persist in this resolution, by putting him
in mind, what a fine thing it would be
to see <HI>Roxelana</HI> the second Countess of
<HI>England.</HI> Don't speak any more of it,
said he, she shall never be that whilst she
lives.</P>
<P>I did not see him for a Week after,
till I happen'd to meet him in St. <HI>James</HI>'s
<HI>Park</HI> with two Persons that made but a
very ill Appearance. So soon as he saw
me, he left them, and came to me. Well,
my Lord, said I smiling, how do Mat∣ters
go with your Intreague? I hope
they will do pretty well, answer'd he;
and to make you an absolute Confident of
my present Condition, I can't but disclose
my whole Design to you. I have done,
continu'd he, for these three Months last
past, all what is possible to be done to
gain the Heart of <HI>Roxelana:</HI> All my Suf∣ferings,
Care, Liberality, all is in vain;
her Humour being as haughty as that of
the <HI>Sultana</HI> herself, whose Name she
bears, will not permit her to grant me
the least Favour. I intend not to take
the same measures in this case as I would
do with a Person of Quality; I intend to
seize her this Evening as she comes out
of the Play-House, and carry her into the
Country; when I have once got her at
my Seat, I know well enough how to
deal with her. These Men you saw with
me are to put it in execution. I was so
<PB N="444" REF="305"/>
surpriz'd, that for some time I was not
able to speak. Why are you silent, said
he? Don't you approve of it? I am too
much your Friend, answer'd I, to approve
of so unjust and violent an Action. One
ought not to expect more from a Mistress
than what she is free to give▪ Is it possi∣ble
you should find a relish in such Fa∣vours
as are snatch'd by constraint? Be∣lieve
me, a nice and tender Passion, as it
is attended by a thousand Charms which
affect our Hearts and Senses; so a brutish
and forced Love must needs cause such
Remorses in a Person of Honour, as will
not suffer him to relish the Pleasure he
hopes to enjoy. Is it possible, reply'd the
Earl, interrupting me, you can think me
capable of repenting in this kind; this
seems to have in it more of the Frailty of
a Woman, than of the Courage becoming
a Man. My business is to enjoy, and so
soon as I have done, I shall never think
any more of this Actress. You are in the
wrong, said I, if you imagine to enjoy in
spite of her you love: Force may make
you Master of her Body, but you will
never be the more happy if you can't be
so over her Heart. Take my word for't,
my Lord, you had better have patience
for some time longer, you had better Sigh
and shed Tears at her Feet, rather than
exasperate her by an Action so contrary
to what ought to be expected from a
Lover.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="306"/>
All these Reasons made at last such an
impression upon the Earl, that he assur'd
me he would quit all Thoughts of pursu∣ing
this Design, that he would renew his
Visits and Addresses, praying me to visit
her also sometimes, in order to do him
all the good Offices I could. I was wil∣ling
to do it, it being my opinion, that
since he had shewn so much deference for
my Advice, I could do no less than shew
him this piece of Complaisance. I often
visited her, and the better I knew her,
the more I was convinced of her Merits
and Wit, and that she look'd not for a
Lover, tho' never so deserving, but for a
Husband. As this could not but augment
my Esteem for her, so I pitied the Earl
of—</P>
<P>Eight Months pass'd, during which we
could not perceive the least compliance in
<HI>Roxelana</HI>'s Temper, tho' she appear'd ve∣ry
merry, and nothing could be more a∣greeable
than her Conversation. But when∣ever
the Earl would give himself some
familiar Airs, she told him, she would see
him no more as long as she liv'd, because
she was resolv'd to keep herself always
within the same Bounds of Prudence and
Vertue, as she had done hitherto, unless
he would resolve to marry her. At last
he promis'd he would with a thousand
Oaths, but begg'd her not to discover it
to me, because I was absolutely against
the Match, and would thwart it as much
as ever I could. She engag'd not to speak
<PB N="446" REF="307"/>
of it; but her Joy being so excessive that
she was not able to contain it; she cou'd
not forbear to tell me the reason, begging
of me, for God's sake, not to spoil her
Fortune. Truly, said I, fair <HI>Roxelana,</HI>
the Earl of—is not very wise
to mistrust me upon this occasion, I
being neither his Father nor his Guardian,
but only his Friend, have no power to
constrain him in such Matters as he judges
most convenient for his purpose; and con∣sequently
I may easily hold my Tongue,
and remain an idle Spectator of what he
intends to do, without being blam'd for
it. Every thing being settl'd for the Con∣summation
of the Match betwixt them,
without the privity of any body, except
such as must of necessity know it, he
propos'd she should go along with him
into the Country. But, as if she had had
some foresight of what afterwards hap∣pen'd,
she told him, she would be mar∣ry'd
in <HI>London.</HI> After some Contests, he
consented to it, and marry'd her at his
own House. The Ceremony being over,
she thought herself now at the highest
pitch of her Wishes. And never did any
Person shew more Satisfaction at her good
Fortune than she did.</P>
<P>The first Night was scarce pass'd,
when <HI>Roxelana</HI> being still asleep, the Earl
push'd her very roughly; Awake, said he,
awake, <HI>Roxelana,</HI> 'tis time to be gone.
She turning her Eyes upon him, Why,
my Lord, said she, do you call me <HI>Roxe∣lana?</HI>
<PB N="447" REF="308"/>
Why must I not have the Honour
of being Countess of—? No, reply'd
he, you are not so, you are not marry'd
to me; and to unfold the whole Mystery,
know, That it was my Steward disguis'd
who perform'd the Marriage Ceremony
betwixt us yesterday. Oh! Traytor, cry'd
she, taking hold of his Throat, and en∣deavouring
in this first Fury to strangle
him, thou shalt die by my hands. The
Earl seeing her thus furious, sound means
to disengage himself, and so left the
Chamber. She got out of the Bed, and
laying hold of his Sword, which lay up∣on
the Table, pursu'd him to the very
Dining Room Door, which he shut and
lock'd against her. Now <HI>Roxelana</HI> find∣ing
herself bereav'd of the main Object
of her Fury, turn'd the Effects thereof
against herself. She tore her Hair and
Face, and made most dreadful Outcries
and most pitiful Lamentations, enough to
touch her Husband's Heart. But finding
him not to appear, she resolv'd to kill
herself; and turning the point of the na∣ked
Sword against her Bosom, thrust is
into her Body with such a force as must
needs have put an end to her Life, had
not her trembling Hand fail'd in some
measure in the intended fatal Execution;
for the Sword passing along the Ribs,
gave her a Wound which prov'd rather
large than dangerous. She dropt, swim∣ming
in her own Blood: And the Earl,
who had seen all what pass'd from a
<PB N="448" REF="309"/>
place where he cou'd not easily be seen;
now mov'd with Compassion, sent to me
to give her all possible Assistance. To∣wards
Evening she was carry'd to her own
Home, and I happen'd to come in at the
same moment, being impatient to hear
how Matters went, guess at my surprize,
when I saw her supported half dead by
several Persons who put her to Bed. I
drew nearer, and she no sooner saw me,
but, Oh! My Lord, cry'd she, pray un∣derstand
from my own Mouth my Mis∣fortunes,
and the Perfidiousness of a Mon∣ster,
unworthy to see the Light of the
Sun. She then related to me, with Tears
and Sighs, all what had pass'd; which
cou'd not but move me to Compassion.
Whilst she was talking to me with the
utmost vehemency, casting her Eyes upon
a Pourtraiture of Wax-work of the Earl
of—, which he had presented to
her not long before, she was so enrag'd at
the sight thereof, that in spite of her
Weakness, she leapt out of Bed, with an
intention to dash it to pieces. I had much
ado to prevent her; and for fear of some
new commotion of her Spirits, which might
have prov'd very dangerous, I order'd
my Servants to take the Case with the
Pourtraiture, and carry it to my House.
This is the same you see, continu'd he,
looking upon the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>
and the Earl of <HI>A—n.</HI> But, to end
this Story in a few words, <HI>Roxelana</HI> at∣tempted
to make her Marriage stand good
<PB N="449" REF="310"/>
in Law, but the power of the Earl carry'd
it above the poor Actress. However, he
was forced to allow her a Maintenance,
and to provide for a Son she brought into
the World. Ever since this odd Adven∣ture
we have not been so intimate Friends
as we used to be. He has own'd to me,
he thought fit to conceal from me that
ill Action he intended to put upon the
poor young Woman, judging I would be
against it, and that it might prove the
occasion of a Difference betwixt us.</P>
<P>I know almost every thing you have
related to be true, said the Duke of <HI>Buc∣kingham,</HI>
and I can't but confess the Con∣duct
of the Earl of—in this Affair
was very dishonourable, and I was always
one of those that blam'd him most for it.
As for me, said the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> I
commend him for it; why should he not
by one dishonourable act prevent another,
which he must have expected from <HI>Roxe∣lana?</HI>
And if we understood ourselves
rightly, we should deal thus with all
Womenkind. The Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> smi∣led,
and told him, that his Spite against
<HI>Emilia</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> made
him launch out thus against the whole
fair Sex, and that it was but reasonable
he should put some Bounds to his Re∣sentment.</P>
<P>Whilst they were yet busie in talking,
in comes a <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> of the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s and brings him a Billet,
which was deliver'd to him by <HI>Esther,</HI>
<PB N="450" REF="311"/>
from the Countess of—At the re∣ceit
thereof, the Duke changed his Coun∣tenance:
He had a great mind to read it,
but his Haughtiness would not let him;
for, after what he had told these two
Lords concerning his Mistress, he fear'd
they would observe him, and divert them∣selves
at his cost. The Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI>
shrewdly guessing at the Matter: Believe
me for once, said he, don't side with your
Anger against the true Sentiments of your
Heart; mine foretells me, there's a Ju∣stification
in the case. Would not you
be overjoy'd in case the Countess should
offer such Measures towards a Reconcile∣ment
as you could wish for? I don't very
well know, as the case just now stands, what
I could wish, said the Duke, with an Air that
discover'd more of Love than of Trouble;
but be it as it will, I have a mind to see
once more, what way this <HI>Ungrateful</HI>
will find to justify the Reception she
gave me. He found only these few Lines
written in the Billet.</P>
<P>Your Eyes sufficiently discover'd your
Anger; why would not you at the same
time find out my Discontent? You know
part of what makes me complain of you,
but I have a mind to convince you of it,
by telling you what reason you have to
commend me. Don't fail to expect me at
your House this Evening, tho' it were a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the peril of my Life.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="312"/>
Hah! said the Duke, I begin to breath
something easier. I must own it, to my
Shame, whatever Indifferency and Spite I
might pretend to, I loved still at the bot∣tom
of my Heart; and I was almost re∣duced
to Despair, to see myself obliged
to hate what was so dear to me. How
happy are you, said the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n?</HI>
You are in a condition to be beguil'd by
what you love. You are not so well
used, said the Earl of S. <HI>Albans.</HI> No,
added the Earl, I must not have seen with
my own Eyes the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> let
down out of <HI>Emilia</HI>'s Window; is it pos∣sible
for a Man to digest such an unwor∣thy
Contrivance? and did I not deserve
to be used at a very scurvy rate, if I should
dispense with it? Good God! reply'd
my Lord of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> you argue but
very indifferently for your Repose; if
our Weakness is very great, we must
controul our Reason, we must seek not to
know what we know, and conceal what
we see; we must, say I, persuade our∣selves
we are contented. Yes, cry'd the
Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> somewhat impatient,
yes, my Lord, that is to say, one must
be a ridiculous Fool, a Sot, a Bubble;
suffer oneself to be kill'd, and to kiss
the Hand that directs the Dagger to your
Heart. Your Maxims and mine, con∣tinu'd
he, are very different; instead of
this complaisant Air, which you would
infuse into me, I shall make use of ano∣ther,
directly opposite to yours: And
<PB N="452" REF="313"/>
since I know not how to make myself to
be belov'd, I will at least make myself to
be fear'd.</P>
<P>Having utter'd these Words, he was
going to leave the Room; but the Duke
laugh'd so loud, and cry'd out, <HI>Adieu,</HI>
good Sir, the Terror of the fair Sex, and
Bugbear of Husbands, that the Earl of
<HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> in spite of all his Anger,
could not forbear laughing in his turn.
We parted very near at the same Mo∣ment:
The Duke went to his House to
attend his Appointment; the Earl of
<HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> full of Melancholy, to his Re∣tirement;
and the Earl of S. <HI>Albans</HI> to
Court.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> after having
quitted his Basket, came to my Lord <HI>Grey.</HI>
It being then after Supper, my Lord up∣braided
him for making him stay so
long. If you knew, said the Duke,
what it was that detain'd me, you would
pity me instead of complaining. He
took him aside, and told him what
had happen'd. My Lord <HI>Grey</HI> not be∣ing
able to forbear laughing at several
Passages he related to him, the Duke was
almost angry. Did ever a Man, said he,
laugh at the Misfortunes of his Friend?
To be pestred with three Mistresses at
once; and besides this, the fear I lay
under that the thing might come to the
King's ear; was not all this Vexation
enough? Were you not an unconstant
Wretch, answer'd my Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> you
<PB N="453" REF="314"/>
need not fear such like Adventures; but
you are always fluttering about like a
Butterfly. You do well, reply'd the Duke,
to upbraid me; were I not so much out
of humour, I would not be long indebted
to you; but at this time I am not for
Diversions and Jests. The Duke con∣tinu'd
his Discourse, and every foot the
thought of the Basket returning into my
Lord <HI>Grey</HI>'s head, he laugh'd out aloud.
'Tis now no time to laugh, said the Duke,
but our business is to contrive means how
to appease Madam—, <HI>Emilia</HI> and <HI>Phi∣ladelphia.</HI>
You have without doubt a hard
piece of Work to do, and more difficult
than you imagine, reply'd my Lord, but
nothing shall be too hard a task for me
to serve you. I will go and see <HI>Emilia;</HI>
I will also speak to her Companion;
but as to Madam—, I leave you
to manage her. If you will undertake,
said the Duke, to set Matters to rights
with the other two fair Ladies, I will go
to the third immediately. What, with∣out
eating, said my Lord, pray stay a lit∣tle.
I can't, said the Duke, I will make
my Peace whilst her Husband is absent,
and then go to Supper. Coming to Ma∣dam
—, he was told, she was not
very well, and gone to Bed: He then
kneeling at her Bed side, and squeezing
her Hand betwixt his for a considerable
time, not knowing what to say; at last
ask'd her, how she did? and whether no∣thing
could be done to ease her? You
<PB N="454" REF="315"/>
can do all, my Lord, said she, with a
languishing tone, which render'd her infi∣nitely
lovely; you can do every thing for
my ease, if you please. But what reason
have I to hope for any thing from a faith∣less
Man, who loves me not? Madam,
reply'd he, I confess to you, that I have
already upbraided myself for having gi∣ven
you some apparent occasion of Com∣plaint;
but sometimes things happen so
unforeseen, that 'tis impossible to avoid
them. Such a one was this Night's Ad∣venture,
which is, questionless, what now
troubles you; and I swear to you, never
was a Man more innocent.</P>
<P>I happen'd by chance to come into the
Room of the Ladies of her ..... when
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> was very ill, and <HI>Emilia</HI> did
assist her; tho' I have only a bare Indiffe∣rency
for <HI>Emilia,</HI> I thought it unhandsom
to leave her. Scarce was she recovered
out of her Swoon, when the Governess
coming, and the young Ladies dreading
her Anger, shut me up in the Closet;
you coming in at the same time, and this
proving a new Matter of trouble, they
thought to deliver themselves from it by
letting me down out of the Window. I
want a little more Faith, said Madam
—, and something of your Dexterity,
to be satisfy'd of the truth of the Account
you give me. But, my Lord, is it not
too too true, that you are in love with
one of these Ladies? I retain still fresh
in memory, with what a tender and passio∣nate
<PB N="455" REF="316"/>
Air you used to entertain <HI>Emilia:</HI>
'Tis in vain to tell me she is indifferent
to you; I need only take a little pains to
be convinced of your Sentiments. You
will do much better, reply'd the Duke,
not to be instructed by any body but my
self; for if you set a watch over me,
these jealous Proceedings will excite my
Heart to Rebellion. Believe me, 'tis on∣ly
yours; and is not this sufficient for
your Satisfaction? Madam—by
her Sighs and Silence gave him to under∣stand,
she knew what she had to do.
The Duke was vex'd thereat, it being his
custom to be beforehand with his Mi∣stress
in Courtesies, expecting they should
take his word for what he told them,
whether out of inclination or design, and
to rest satisfied, without diving farther
into the matter. Madam—had not
Strength enough to answer him, being
much indisposed, as I told you before,
and much vex'd at his Presence. He per∣ceiving
the matter, departed the Room;
and going home, pass'd the remainder of
the Night in contriving the best means he
could to redress his amorous Affairs,
which were then but in a very bad con∣dition.</P>
<P>After having made his Appearance at
Court, the next day he retir'd into his
Closet, in expectation of my Lord <HI>Grey</HI>'s
coming, he having promis'd to bring him
his Mistress's Answer. He came soon af∣ter,
and finding the Duke alone; Guess,
<PB N="456" REF="317"/>
said he, what I am going to tell you.
Truly, reply'd he, I am not able to guess.
<HI>Emilia</HI> is of too uneaven a Temper to tell
you what to make of her; and <HI>Philadel∣phia</HI>
is such a piece of Formality, that I
know not what Character to give her. I
spoke to both, but to each in private,
said my Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> chance having offer'd
me an opportunity of so doing. Neither
of them would declare themselves frank∣ly
upon the Matter; but was charged by
<HI>Emilia,</HI> that she must speak to you her∣self.
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> also told me, she should
be well pleased to see you, but that being
watch'd and overlook'd in all Corners,
she conjures you, if you have any respect
for her, to be upon your guard, and ra∣ther
not to look at her in a Week's time,
than to raise a jealousy in <HI>Emilia.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke assur'd my Lord, he would
punctually observe the Commands of his
two Mistresses. And, added he, do you
really believe them to be angry with me?
I could not, I tell you, dive into their
real Sentiments; but it seem'd to me as
if <HI>Emilia</HI> was uneasie and melancholy.
The reason is, because I am not so indif∣ferent
to her as to her Companion, re∣ply'd
the Duke, with an angry Counte∣nance.
To see you sigh, says my Lord,
seems as if you were troubled at it. The
Duke answer'd not one Word, till after
having paused a while, he look'd upon
my Lord <HI>Grey;</HI> I confess to you, said he,
I never took any real delight in the pos∣session
<PB N="457" REF="318"/>
of a Heart whereof I thought my∣self
absolutely sure. And what is it,
said my Lord, that affects you most, you
have a very good Relish? My greatest
Delight is, continu'd the Duke, in pay∣ing
my Services to a new Mistress, to
watch her Scorns, my Hopes, Fears, Un∣easiness,
and, in short, every thing we
meet with at the beginning of an amo∣rous
Passion.</P>
<P>This is the state of the case betwixt
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> and me. I am apt to believe
her Inclinations are for me; that she
strives against them; that there is a
great Contest betwixt Vertue, Reason,
and the Inclinations of her Heart, which
pleads for me; and that in spite of her∣self,
she will love me at last. This 'tis
that I am ambitious of, this flatters my
Vanity.</P>
<P>Oh! my Lord, cry'd my Lord <HI>Grey,</HI>
I find you are as yet unacquainted with
the essential part of Love; your Mind
runs only upon Trifles and Amusements.
If your Heart were truly inclin'd to
Tenderness, you would put all your Hap∣piness
in being belov'd by the Object you
love. The very Thoughts whether you
were in possession of your Mistress's
Heart or not, would drive you to De∣spair,
and whatever might thwart it,
would cause you a thousand Inquie∣tudes.
Now judge, by your own Senti∣ments,
and by those I have describ'd,
what prodigious difference there is be∣twixt
<PB N="458" REF="319"/>
Fiction and Reality. I swear to
you, said the Duke interupting him, at
that rate I know nothing but Fiction to
this moment; if it be true, that if a Man
will love well, he must love in earnest.
I see, said my Lord, you Hour is not come
yet; but time will come, when you will
tell me enough of it, and perhaps more
than you wish for. He went away, af∣ter
having spoken this Prophecy, which
was sufficiently verify'd in the Event;
but of this it is not convenient to speak
in this place.</P>
<P>The Duke was preparing to go to pay
his Respects to the Dutchess of <HI>York,</HI>
when word was brought him, that the
Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> being arriv'd lately,
the King requir'd him to conduct that
Prince to the Ball, which was to be at
the Queens that Night. He cou'd do no
less than obey. He had seen that Prince
before in his Travels, when he continu'd
for some time in the Dominions of the
Duke his Father. He was receiv'd by
him with all the Honour and Respect he
might expect from a young Prince of an il∣lustrious
Birth, and the Rank he himself
bore in the <HI>English</HI> Court. The Prince of
<HI>Newburg</HI> did not fail to come in good
time to wait on the King, that he might
stay for some time with him, before the
Ball began. He was a very handsom Per∣son,
of a beautiful Countenance, and a
very agreeable Deportment; he danc'd
with a very good Grace; and as he was
<PB N="459" REF="320"/>
Master of several Languages, it was easie
for him to enter into Conversation with
such as he lik'd best.</P>
<P>Among all the rest that made their Ap∣pearance
at the Ball, my Lady—
pleas'd him most. She being then in a
melancholy Temper, occasion'd by the
Infidelity of the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> made
her Eyes appear with a certain languishing
Sweetness, which was very desirable; the
whiteness of her Complexion was not
faded, her Lips as red as Coral, and a
certain careless Air, natural to Women
when they have no Conquest in view, were
more becoming in her, than the borrow'd
and artificial Charms of all the rest. She
was in so eminent a Station at Court,
that her Name alone was sufficient to
make her to be taken notice of by a foreign
Prince. He drew near to her with a Com∣pliment:
Which she returning with a
great deal of Civility, he made it his
business to entertain her in Discourse all
that Night, which she was well enough
pleased with; for let a handsom Woman
be never so indifferent, she loves to be taken
notice of before others; and looking upon
this as a proof of her Deserts, Self-love
will not give her leave to neglect such an
opportunity. She had, besides this, another
insight in the Matter, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earl of
<HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> being at the Ball, she was am∣bitious
to kindle some sparks of Jealousie
in him. She perceiv'd him much out of
Humour, and consequently guess'd he
<PB N="458" REF="321"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="459" REF="322"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="460" REF="323"/>
was troubl'd in his Mind. He did not speak
to <HI>Emilia,</HI> and this young Lady had never
made a worse shew than she did at that
time, her Eyes not appearing with their
usual Sprightliness, or Fire, unless when she
cast them towards my Lady; and remem∣bring
the Ink-bottle, she discover'd a cer∣tain
desire of Revenge, which she cou'd
scarce keep within the bounds of Mode∣ration;
but as often as she look'd towards
the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> she had not courage
enough to let them continue that way;
and a redness, which over-spread her whole
Face, was an undeniable witness of the
secret Reproaches she felt at the Adven∣ture
of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> in the
Hamper. The Duke wou'd fain have ta∣ken
the opportunity of the Ball, to seat
himself by, and to speak to her, had not
<HI>Philadelphia,</HI> who was not far off, spoil'd
his Intentions of talking with one, with∣out
being over-heard by the other. Cou'd
he have spoke to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> he wou'd
have been tolerably well satisfy'd, but he
labour'd under the same Difficulty with
her, in respect of the nearness of <HI>Emilia;</HI>
besides that, the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> and
Madam—(who came to the Ball
chiefly for that purpose) kept a watchful
Eye over him. The Duke finding himself
under this <HI>Dilemma,</HI> was yet more sur∣priz'd
at the coming of <HI>Nelly.</HI> 'Tis known
to every body, that she was an Actress,
and that the King delighted in her more for
her diverting and agreeable Humour, than
<PB N="461" REF="324"/>
for her Person, tho' she made a pretty
good figure; but she was so very spright∣ly
and gay in Conversation, as to make
all the Company to partake of her merry
Disposition. She enter'd masked, and
disguised in Shepherdesses Habit, attend∣ed
by several other Ladies and Gentlemen
of Quality, all in the same Dress. Af∣ter
having danced some Country-Dances,
which she perform'd very well, (tho' her
way of dancing was as odd and singular
as all the rest of her Actions) she exclaim'd
against the heat of the Room, and that it
were more convenient to take a little fresh
Air. 'Tis true, the Season being not very
proper for so numerous a Company to be
enclos'd in a Room, they were not a little
incommoded with the Heat.</P>
<P>The Queen, who took no great diver∣sion
at the Ball, being retired into her own
Appartment, the Ladies of Honour of the
Dutchess of—, who were there present
with their Governess, arose in order to be
gone. But the King order'd them to fol∣low
him with the rest of the Ladies into
the <HI>Park.</HI> The King and Prince of <HI>New∣burg,</HI>
attended by the whole Court, and
follow'd by the Musick, went into the
<HI>Bowling-Green,</HI> where some seated them∣selves
upon Benches, some upon green
Turfs. They danc'd in divers places at
once; and it being a clear bright Night,
there was no occasion for Lights; the Flutes
and Hautboys answering by means of the
Eccho to the Violins. This Entertain∣ment,
<PB N="462" REF="325"/>
tho unforeseen, and unconcerted,
prov'd infinitely agreeable and diverting.</P>
<P>Every thing being transacted there in a
kind of pleasing Disorder, there was a suf∣ficient
opportunity of talking to one an∣other,
without being observ'd. My Lady
—seeing the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> pass
behind certain Pallisado-Rails, against
which she was leaning at that time, went
out of one of the <HI>Bowling-Green</HI> Doors,
in order to meet him. The Earl, not a
little surpriz'd thereat, was at a stand
whether to turn back; he having, during
the Ball, look'd much more favourably
upon her, than he had done for a long
time before. He accosted her, Oh! Mad∣am,
said he, how happy wou'd this mo∣ment
seem to me, were you the same you
us'd to be in my regard. <HI>Ungrateful,</HI>
said she, how cou'd you think it possible?
Can you imagine I cou'd forget the Game
you have plaid me? With what indiffe∣rence
you receiv'd my Compliments, with
what Disdain you spoke of me to my Face
in the Queens Gallery; what answer you
return'd to a Letter, which ought to have
touch'd you to the Heart; and what
Pains you took to convince me of your In∣fidelity?
And you have done it so effectu∣ally,
that I shall never forgive it. Will
you never pardon me, Madam, cry'd the
Earl, drawing nearer to her, and taking
her by the Hand? Is it possible you shou'd
take a Resolution so opposite to what you
<PB N="463" REF="326"/>
have promis'd me before? Can you ima∣gine,
that during these frail Intervals I
spent with <HI>Emilia,</HI> I cou'd attempt to
promise I never wou'd love you? You
are likely enough to attempt or to do any
thing, persidious Man! reply'd my Lady;
you wou'd have thrust a Dagger into my
Heart to purchase one favourable Look
from her. 'Tis no difficult matter for me
to see, that you are at odds together, but
I suppose 'tis her, and not your Fault;
she has found the way of making you a
submissive and patient Creature. You
connive at her light Actions, you love her
not a jot the worse, and you see your Ri∣val
preferr'd before you, with so sweet
and calm a Temper, as can't be sufficient∣ly
commended. Oh! Madam, cry'd the
Earl, 'tis too hard to insult over me, I was
just upon the point of putting your Fetters
on again, I felt within my Breast certain
Sparks of Fire, which being not well
couch'd, were ready to kindle afresh; but
you add Ironies to your Reproaches.
There is nothing I wou'd not do to be
reveng'd, reply'd she, an enrag'd Heart
knows no bounds of Moderation.</P>
<P>She had continu'd her Discourse, if
they had not been silenc'd by a noise they
heard not far from thence. At the same
time she espy'd the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
with <HI>Emilia;</HI> as these two had an equal
desire to Discourse one another, they
got into an Arbour, in order to clear the
point, concerning what Matters of Com∣plaint
<PB N="464" REF="327"/>
one might have against the other▪
Do you see here two Persons, said she,
to the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> who, I am apt
to believe, have no occasion for such a
witness as you of their Conversation; not∣withstanding
which, your Interest lying
so far at stake as it does, I will not rob
you of the pleasure of hearing them.
This is a satisfaction I shou'd be glad to
sacrifice to you, reply'd he, were it not
that your Eyes betray the Aversion you
have against me. My Respects forbids
me not to detain you any longer with an
unhappy Man, who is insupportable to
you. Say rather, return'd she, at parting,
that what most torments you, is your
Curiosity.</P>
<P>My Lady went away, and she was not
in the wrong to imagine, that the Earl
was very glad to hear the Conversation
betwixt the Duke and his Mistress. He
crept very softly to the place where they
were, he listen'd attentively, and seeing
the Duke with one Knee upon the Ground
at <HI>Emilia</HI>'s Feet, he heard her continue
her Discourse, which she had began be∣fore.
Before my Face, said she, barbar∣ous
Man! under my very Eyes you have
made me see in yours all the marks of
a violent Passion, as if you had never lov'd
any thing but her. This haughty Rival
pretended to fall into a Swoon, for no o∣ther
reason, than to ensnare you the
deeper, and you acted without controul,
and with a very slender regard to my Pre∣sence.
<PB N="465" REF="328"/>
Just Heav'ns! Was I to be an eye-witness
of what I wou'd have remain'd
doubtful of all the Days of my Life? Your
Surmizes, Madam, reply'd the Duke,
wou'd perplex me, had I by my Conduct
given any real occasion for it. But I pro∣test
to you, <HI>Emilia,</HI> you have no real rea∣son
of Complaint; I have shewn some
Compassion for a dying young Woman;
wou'd you have me to have assisted in
choaking her; and to please your Humour,
left her without, or beyond all hopes of
Relief? You ought to have done it, cry'd
<HI>Emilia,</HI> you ought to have consider'd the
Trouble it would cause in me; you ought
to have suppress'd my Jealousie by a pro∣cedure
quite contrary to what you did;
and you may be persuaded, had you re∣mov'd
all cause of Complaint against you,
<HI>Philadelphia</HI> should not have wanted any
thing that was either convenient or necessa∣ry.
But here was the Touchstone; you durst
not trust any body else, because you were
willing to do every thing yourself, this
was indeed the best way to revive her
Colour in her Lips. Do you remember
what proofs of a most tender Affection
you ventur'd to give her? They were so
indifferent to me, said he, that I have al∣ready
forgot them. Oh! perfidious Man,
said she, I know you only too well, and not∣withstanding
all what I have seen, I will
rather blind my own Eyes, my Reason,
my Resentment, and flatter myself that I
am still very dear to you. You are so,
<PB N="466" REF="329"/>
my lovely <HI>Emilia,</HI> above every thing in
the World, reply'd the Duke, and you
shall be convinc'd thereof by my Con∣duct.</P>
<P>The Conversation now rising to so high a
pitch of Tenderness, put the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI>
into such a ferment, that he had certainly
broke out into some outrageous Action,
had it not been for the King's Presence,
who just then happen'd to pass by that
way with <HI>Nelly,</HI> being follow'd by the
Pr. of <HI>Newburg,</HI> who leading my Lady—,
it seem'd as if he spoke to her with more
than ordinary Affiduity, and as if she
hearken'd to him with more Attention
than is usual betwixt Persons of a few
Hours Acquaintance.</P>
<P>To speak the Truth, never was any
Man in a more melancholy and disturbed
Condition than the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> at
that time. He heard on one side the Con∣versation
betwixt <HI>Emilia</HI> and the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth;</HI> he saw on the other hand my
Lady with a foreign Prince, and himself
alone, overwhelm'd with Jealousie and
Vexation. He could not endure to stay
any longer in a place where it seem'd as
if all that were there were inspir'd with
nothing else but Love and Mirth. He left
the <HI>Bowling Green,</HI> but passing through a
very thick Wood, heard a Person fetch
such deep and violent Sighs, that it seem'd
as if she, that fetch'd them, was breathing
her last. The Earl being touch'd with
Compassion, and reflecting upon his own
<PB N="467" REF="330"/>
Condition, thought he should be well-pleas'd
to meet with one under the same
Circumstances, that they might bemoan
their Misfortunes together, and prove a
Comfort to one another. So approaching
to the place as softly and near as he could,
he heard her express herself thus: O un∣fortunate
Woman! that my Heart should
be engaged to so fickle and unconstant a
Man! What can I hope for in this fatal
Inclination? He loves <HI>Emilia,</HI> and I shall
die for Grief. Here she stopt, but soon
reassuming her former Discourse; Is it
possible, said she, I should flatter myself,
and that the Tenderness I have for him
should make more lively Impressions upon
my Mind, than all those Expressions I
heard him utter to my Rival. Oh! too
fatal a Curiosity for the Repose of my
Life! I shall pay very dear for it! I was
under an uncertainty which afforded me
some room for flattering myself; but now
am beyond all doubt, and almost distracted
for being undeceiv'd.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> very well knew
the Voice of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but would not
come too near, for fear she might have
somebody or other with her. But hearing
nobody speak but her, without receiving
any Answer, he soon imagin'd it was
the violence of her Grief that made her
break out into these Complaints. And so
it prov'd, for coming nearer, he saw her
alone, lying upon a green Turf under a
Tree. She hearing a noise, turn'd her
<PB N="468" REF="331"/>
Head, and seeing him so near her, was
forely afraid he might have over-heard
her; she began to reflect upon her own Im∣prudence,
to have thus reveal'd the Secret
of her Passion; and the Earl might easily
guess at the present Condition of her Heart.</P>
<P>Don't fear, <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> said he, all
the Tenderness you have for a Person
whom I have so much reason to hate,
shall never oblige me to betray your Frail∣ty:
I can hold my Tongue, and even
compassionate your Misfortune. It would
be considerably encreas'd, said she, if you
should go about to revenge yourself
upon the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> since it
must furnish new matter of Trouble to
me; and if you did, which I hope you
will not, he would be little disturbed there∣at
upon my account; he loves nobody but
<HI>Emilia,</HI> and if he has told me some oblig∣ing
things, it was only to deceive me.
And why, said the Earl, should you be so
fond of him, if you know him to be such
a fickle Person? O! my Heart, that frail
Heart of mine, said she, surrender'd
without consulting my Reason; I found I
lov'd before I was aware of the Effects
his Presence and Conversation had pro∣duc'd
in me. But, my Lord, continu'd
she, the better to moderate my Grief, let
me have this Comfort, to believe that
you will forget all the Extravagances
you heard me speak.</P>
<P>Rest satisfy'd upon my account, fair
<HI>Philadelphia,</HI> reply'd he, I promise to keep
<PB N="469" REF="332"/>
your Secret, and I am a Man of Honour:
But I do declare to you, that, if you are so
frail, as not to desist from loving him, I—
He had scarce spoke these Words, but he
saw him not above ten Paces distant. Hah!
What are you a doing here, said the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with a fierce Countenance,
laying his Hand to his Sword? The Earl
of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> without speaking one word,
fac'd about in a fighting Posture, and in
spite of the respect due to the King's Pal∣lace,
the Quarrel would not have ended
without a fatal Event, had not <HI>Philadel∣phia,</HI>
with an unparellel'd Courage, thrown
herself betwixt them; whilst she was con∣juring
them to reflect upon what they
were going to do. The Duke of <HI>Buck∣ingham,</HI>
who was not far of, hearing a
confus'd Noise of several Voices he knew
very well, drew nearer, and saw what
pass'd. He intreated them in Conjuncti∣on
with <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to desist, and being
an intimate Friend of the Duke, and the
Earl's Uncle, urg'd the Matter so home
betwixt them, that they engag'd, upon
their Parole of Honour, not to Fight till
he had taken full Cognizance of the
Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Philadelphia</HI> was going to retire: But
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> intreated her most
earnestly to hear him for one moment.
Tho' she had all the reason in the world
to refuse him this Favour, yet finding her∣self
not Mistress of her own Curiosity,
she staid behind. Am not I, said he, the
<PB N="470" REF="333"/>
most unfortunate of all Lovers? I love
you, <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but am not able to con∣vince
you of it. You believe <HI>Emilia</HI> alone
possesses my Heart, and you are angry upon
that account, but without reason. You
ought to consider, that if I am obliging
to her, 'tis because I would not have her
intermeddle with me, and for fear, lest
her jealous Temper should create you some
Trouble. You act your Part too well
to the Life, reply'd she, for one not to
believe that there is a great deal of
Truth in this Fiction. I am apt to per∣suade
myself, that you have some Incli∣nations
towards me, because you make
nothing (after the rate you love) of loving
several at a time. But, my Lord, you
will find it a hard Task to make me forget
those disobliging Words you spoke up∣on
my account to <HI>Emilia.</HI> I did not come
there to dive into your Sentiments; nay,
I freely confess, that as far as it depends
on me, I would never be undeceived; that
would be more to my Satisfaction. For,
when I heard you speak thus, I was so
far touch'd, that I had died upon the spot,
had I not been reserv'd for more durable
Miseries. O <HI>Philadelphia!</HI> cry'd the
Duke, how unjustly do you deal with
me? I find, notwithstanding these flatter∣ing
Intervals, you are going to hate me;
and of all my Misfortunes, this touches
me in the most sensible Part. May it
please Heavens! said she smiling, may it
please Heavens! my Lord, you prove sin∣cere
<PB N="471" REF="334"/>
for once in all your Life; but this is
a thing I dare not so much as expect; and
as the prejudice I have conceived is strong
against you, you must not propose to your∣self
to remove it in a short time. Adieu,
said she, I must be gone, our Governess
believes me to be very ill at this time. I
got from her under that Pretext, and told
her I would go to Bed immediately; but
happening to pass through this Wood,
Darkness, Solitude, and Troubles invited me
so far, as to stay here and vent my Grief,
which I had no power to resist. I owe this
to my good Fortune, says the Duke, en∣deavouring
to stop her, 'tis she that has
given me this opportunity of assuring you
I am yours only, and if you heard me
speak any Words contrary to this Truth,
it was by way of Dissimulation. I was
never in an Intreague, reply'd <HI>Philadelphia;</HI>
but I am of opinion, that if one loves sin∣cerely,
one can't betray oneself to such a
degree as you did, and I dispise such Poli∣ticks
as make one disown one's own Senti∣ments.
You are in the right, Madam,
said he hastily, you shall not upbraid me
long with that, I will gainsay all the
Lyes I have told her; I will declare the
Tenderness I have for you, if it raises a
Discourse, if <HI>Emilia</HI> grows Extravagant,
you ...... No, my Lord, no, don't do
so, cry'd <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> I am satisfy'd, I
will be persuaded, take care of my Repu∣tation,
nothing is dearer to me in the
World; and I declare, this is the only
<PB N="472" REF="335"/>
thing I prefer before you; go on, make
your Courtship to <HI>Emilia,</HI> don't speak to
me but very seldom; don't look out for
Opportunities, Time and Constancy may
perhaps repay you with Usury the Re∣spect
you shew me. Having said these
Words, she went away.</P>
<P>It was broad Day before the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> came back to the Prince of
<HI>Newburg,</HI> whom he conducted Home,
and so they parted. The Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI>
more grieved than ever, was sensible that
if he should go home alone, he should be
overwhelm'd with a thousand vexatious
Reflexions. He wanted one unto whom
he might make his Complaints; and as
the Duke of <HI>Buck<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngham</HI> had been present
at the late Quarrel betwixt the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> and himself, he thought it
better to go to his Lodgings than any
other place. He did not stay long before
the Duke came; for being a Person who
delighted much more in private Pleasures
than publick Feasts, he consented himself
with staying a little while, whilst the
King entertain'd the <HI>German</HI> Prince, and
then went home.</P>
<P>I am overjoy'd, said he, to the Earl of
<HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> to see you here; methinks
we have both occasion to meet; for, ac∣cording
to all appearance, you have suffi∣cent
reason of Complaint, and I am inclin'd
to relate to you the most diverting Ad∣venture
that ever you heard of, which
happened to me. Our Condition is very
<PB N="473" REF="336"/>
different, said the Earl; you have cause
to rejoice, but I to bemoan myself. Which
of us two shall speak first? You shall,
poor my Lord, said the Duke, with an
obliging Air; because my Relation may
serve in some measure to efface the grie∣vous
Idea's of yours.</P>
<P>Never, said the Earl, was poor Lover
worse used than myself: Vex'd to the
Heart I went to the Ball, with no other
intention than to expostulate with <HI>Emilia:</HI>
But she shun'd me so dexterously, that I
could not come near enough to speak to
her; and all the satisfaction I had, was
to keep an eye upon her, and to prevent
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> from entring into
Conversation with her. But whilst I
was thus busied in interrupting them, I
cast my Eyes upon my Lady—, and
she appear'd to me alone much hand∣somer
than all the other Ladies together,
tho' her Dress was rather neat than mag∣nificent,
but attended with a certain neg∣ligent
Air, which, in my opinion, became
her extreamly well. I was under no small
Perplexity I could not leave my Seat
without giving opportunity to the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> of talking to her; and I
could not look upon my Lady with so
wishful an Eye and Countenance, without
an extream desire to come nearer to her,
and to tell her, that upon the first favou∣rable
Look, my Fire would be rekindled
in my Heart. To be short, I labour'd
under a strange confusion of Thoughts at
<PB N="474" REF="337"/>
divers times, upon what reason I had to
praise her, and to blame <HI>Emilia;</HI> and
what methods I should make use of, to
ask pardon of one, and bestow the most
bitter Reproaches upon the other. Some∣times
I flatter'd my self with Hopes,
sometimes I run almost into Despair,
when I consider'd I had lost both my Mi∣stresses,
and I cursed myself for my In∣gratitude
to one of them. Thus swal∣low'd
up in an abyss of different Thoughts.
Yet was my aim only upon her, till my
Jealousy conceiv'd against <HI>Emilia,</HI> which
had been kept in suspense by my Passion
for my Lady—, got new Strength,
and caused me fresh Inquietudes. Yes,
my Lord, I found myself all on fire with
Rage and Anger, when, after some time,
I turn'd my Head to see where <HI>Emilia</HI> was,
but I might look long enough, for she
and the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> were vanish'd.
I found also new matter of distraction in
my Lady and the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI>
who, both in the Room where the Ball
was, and in the Bowling-Green, was con∣tinually
at her heels; no sooner had he
left off dancing with another Lady, but
he would seat himself again next to her,
sometimes he would lie at her Feet, pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding
he did it for the conveniency of
the coolness of the Grass; sometimes he
would stand and cool her with a Fan; he
presented her with Oranges, and he affected
to eat what she had tasted before. These
little Trifles, which an indifferent Person
<PB N="475" REF="338"/>
would not as much as have minded, ap∣pear'd
like monstrous things (as you know
very well) in the eyes of a Lover; and
what most of all vex'd me, was, that so
often as I look'd upon her, she affected to
oblige the Prince with some gracious Air,
more insupportable to me, than if she had
stuck a Dagger into my Heart.</P>
<P>Oh! my Lord, said the Duke of <HI>Buc∣kingham</HI>
smiling, you are soon vex'd.
Don't interrupt me, I conjure you, said
the Earl, for I am willing to come to the
period of the Relation of my Frailties.
I tell you, being almost reduc'd to De∣spair
by her Coquetteries, I perceiv'd, as
I told you before, that <HI>Emilia</HI> had given
me the slip. Here again I was reduc'd to
no small Perplexity. I had a mind to
follow <HI>Emilia,</HI> and at the same time in∣clin'd
to observe the Transactions betwixt
my Lady and the foreign Prince. My
Heart thus divided betwixt these two dif∣ferent
Interests, remain'd undetermin'd
what to chuse: At last it carry'd it for
<HI>Emilia.</HI> But whilst I was still in search
after her, I espy'd my Lady—alone
coming the same way; and without Pre∣sumption
I am apt to believe she came
thither to look for me. This Reflexion
caused in me a certain secret Satisfaction,
which I durst not discover till I might be
satisfied in her Sentiments concerning me.
I discover'd mine to her, but found her
averse and very satyrical; and after ha∣ving
made me to suffer a thousand Re∣proaches,
<PB N="476" REF="339"/>
she left me abruptly. I was
almost beyond myself at so unlucky an
Adventure; but instead of following her,
I was very attentive in overhearing the
inconstant <HI>Emilia.</HI> Oh! what did she
not say to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth?</HI>
Their Conversation was partly Reproaches,
partly tender Expressions intermix'd with
Tears; and in the conclusion, they gave
one another fresh assurances of a violent
Passion.</P>
<P>You acted there but a very melancholy
Part, my dear Nephew, cry'd the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> I was going to act a
Tragedy, reply'd the Earl, and to seek
for the Satisfaction deny'd me by Love:
In my Revenge, I was just going, said I,
to enter the Arbor where they had hid
themselves, when the King, with <HI>Nell,</HI>
attended by many of the Court, happen∣ing
to pass that way, I found it no sea∣sonable
time to commit Extravagances:
So leaving the place that had prov'd so
fatal to my Repose, I resolv'd to find out
another more suitable to my present con∣dition,
and then it was I heard <HI>Philadel∣phia</HI>
in the Wood.</P>
<P>Drawn thither by her Lamentations
and bitter Complaints, I came as near as
I well could; I heard all she said for
some time, and I declare to you, whether
it were out of Compassion, or out of Re∣venge,
or out of Inclination, it being na∣tural
to love what seems aimable to us,
I was sensibly touch'd with her Grief,
<PB N="477" REF="340"/>
and could willingly have supplanted the
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> I told her of
his Inconstancy, and the unfortunate Con∣sequences
she must expect from such an
Engagement which would prove fatal to
her Repose: I represented to her his fic∣kle
Temper; and began insensibly to
insinuate my self into that Discourse,
when chance brought him so near us, as
to overhear part of what we said; we
were going to decide our Quarrel when
you came and prevented us.</P>
<P>I praise Heavens for it, my Lord, said
the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> I should have
run distracted for your sake, and the Con∣sequences
that would have attended it.
The King, exasperated by an Action
which shew'd so much want of Respect
to his Person, would perhaps have made
you pay dear for this Extravagancy. One
must not at all times follow one's splene∣tick
Inclinations, and this is not the first
time you have had the unfortunate Tem∣ptation
of drawing your Sword against
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> You may tell
me, it was a Misfortune to draw my
Sword in the Royal Palace; but for the
rest, I think it an honour for the Duke
to measure his Sword with me. Let us
not differ upon the point, said the Duke
of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> you know that I, being
more advanced in Years than you, and the
Uncle of your Wife, have a fair pre∣tence
to talk to you, both as to my Friend,
and as my Relation▪ You honour me
<PB N="478" REF="341"/>
very much in so doing, reply'd the Earl,
and in looking upon me under that Qualifi∣cation;
but I am persuaded also, that
you take me to be the most unfortunate
of Mankind. Without dispute, said the
Duke; and I never saw any Intreagues
go on so unsuccessful as yours: You
would be happy if you could lay them
aside. Nothing but time, reply'd he,
can clear my Head of these Chimera's,
wherewith it is possess'd all over. I in∣tend
to go into <HI>Ireland</HI> to my Father, I
will forget my Lady, I will detest <HI>Emi∣lia,</HI>
and I will not remember <HI>Philadel∣phia.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke fell a laughing: A Lover
whose Heart is so much divided as yours,
need not save himself by flight; if you
love in two or three places, 'tis no more
than playing; and Coquertry has a grea∣ter
share in it than real Passion. What do
you say, cry'd the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n?</HI>
What do you mean? I am sensible I
was born for Love, and where ever my
Heart fixes, it engages too far for its own
Repose. But, continu'd he, after having
abused your Patience, in giving you an
account of my Disasters, pray tell me
what it is that makes you look with so
chearful a Countenance?</P>
<P>You remember, said the Duke, the Bil∣let
of the Countess, which was brought
me at my Lord of S. <HI>Albans</HI>'s House. I
left you both not without a great deal of
regret; I shut myself up in my Closet,
<PB N="479" REF="342"/>
and I order'd the same <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI>
that brought the Countess's Billet, to let
no body come to me, except herself, or
any Messenger from her. It began to be
late, I was told the King wanted to speak
with me; but being resolv'd not to stir
abroad, word was sent I was not at home.
You are sensible with what impatience
one expects what one loves; without the
least exaggeration, every Hour seem'd to
me a Day. At last comes a Man into my
Closet, dress'd like a Messenger, with an
<HI>English</HI> Cap on his Head pull'd over his
Face, booted and spur'd, and a Whip in
his Hand, who presented to me a Letter
from the Countess, which I am going to
read to you.</P>
<P>Every thing seems to prove contrary to
the desire I have of seeing you: I flatter'd
myself that <HI>Esther</HI> might have Dexterity
enough to convey me out of my House
without being seen; but all her Contrivance
can't come up to that of my jealous Hus∣band:
He watches me more carefully than
if I were a Prisoner of State, guilty of
some capital Crime, for whom he was to
be responsible. I declare to you I am al∣most
desperate, I fear every thing, and
hope for little▪ my only Comfort under
these Misfortunes, is, that I believe you
are sensible of them, and that you will
neglect nothing that may put an end to
them.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="343"/>
The reading of this Billet caused me
abundance of Vexation; I found myself
frustrated of a Pleasure wherewith I had
flatter'd myself; and I fear'd that in en∣deavouring
to do a piece of Service to the
Countess against her Husband, it would
make such a Noise at Court, as might
compleat <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ruin▪ I was ruminating
upon these Matters, and the Messenger staid
all this while: At last I ask'd him, whe∣ther
he would undertake to deliver my
Answer to the same Person that had gi∣ven
him the Letter? He said, No; and
that he was going into <HI>Wales</HI> to carry
some Dispatches from the King. Well,
Friend, said I, go where you will, and so
gave him some Guineas for his Reward.
He went to the Door, but as he was pul∣ling
off his Cap to take his leave, I per∣ceiv'd
a Head of Hair, which being of
the finest Colour in the world, spread all
over the Shoulders down to the Knees.
The pretended Messenger throwing them
aside, discover'd a little Hand whiter
than Snow, and a most charming Face.
Why should I amuse you any longer? Don't
you guess, my Lord, it was the Coun∣tess.
I must confess the pleasure of the
Surprize was no small addition to that of
seeing her. I made her sensible of my
Satisfaction by such lively Expressions,
but so disorderly withal, that my Distur∣bance
sufficiently discover'd to her the
present state of my Heart. Her Presence
had wip'd out all the remembrance of
<PB N="481" REF="344"/>
my Resentment, I thought no more of
those Reproaches I intended to have made
to her; she herself was the first that en∣tred
upon the point of my last ill Recep∣tion:
She told me, her mistrustful and
jealous Husband had shut himself up in a
Closet adjoining to the Room, where he
could hear and see, without being seen,
all she said or did. Would you, con∣tinu'd
she, have me expose you to the
Fury of a Madman, who might have ta∣ken
the opportunity of being too hard for
you and me, under pretence of finding
you in disguise in his House? Nobody is
so brave, but he must give way to great
odds.</P>
<P>I assure you, these are the Reasons that
oblig'd me to put Bounds to my Inclina∣tions:
I durst not turn my Eyes towards
you, I trembled when I spoke to you, I
was afraid lest he should discover you,
and I chose rather to appear cold, un∣grateful
and scornful, than to see you
and my Husband a quarrelling. 'Tis not
for the care you have taken of me I re∣turn
you Thanks, said I, my dear lovely
Countess, for I dare venture to say, your
Husband will consider of it twice before
he attacks me once; but stand highly
indebted to you in respect of yourself;
and you may rest assured, I am a thou∣sand
times more sensible of it, than what
relates immediately to myself.</P>
<P>She told me afterwards, that in order
to get out of the Doors, she was obliged
<PB N="482" REF="345"/>
to disguise herself under the Dress I saw
her; and what was most diverting, was,
that she had got a Pacquet of Letters
brought and directed to him, to deliver
to him in case he should meet her; and
that nothing could have happen'd more
luckily, because he came home the same
Moment with my Lord <HI>Grey</HI> when she
went out; that without the least concern
she met him and gave him the Pacquet,
and so went her ways. You get off very
fortunately, said I; but, good God! what
measures have you taken to get home a∣gain
without trouble? I don't question
it, reply'd she; <HI>Esther</HI> is to pretend I am
not well, and asleep, to prevent the Earl
from coming into my Chamber. Alas!
Madam, added I, is that all? I am afraid
you'll pay dearly for the pleasure of this
Visit. Would you have me to leave you
longer in a Mistake, which must needs
have exasperated you against me? I would
rather have any thing, said I, interrupt∣ing
her, nay even Death itself, than see
you expos'd to the least Danger. My
Lord, cry'd she, don't disturb the Sweets
of our Passion with needless Foresights,
let it happen as Heaven thinks fit; but
let us not despair of our good Fortune.
Her Resolution seem'd to me as convin∣cing
a Proof of her Tenderness, as my
Fearfulness ought to be to her of my Pas∣sion.
However, I obey'd her Orders, and
did not touch upon any thing that might
disturb her good Disposition. I assure
<PB N="483" REF="346"/>
you, my Lord, such a Reconciliation has
something of extraordinary Sweetness in
it for a sensible Heart; and that these
Hours, which seem'd so long to me whilst
I was expecting her coming, appear'd ve∣ry
short in her Company; her Presence
heal'd up all the Wounds of Jealousy, I
remembred no more what Passion the King,
the D. of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and my Lord—
had once for her. She told me a thousand
times, I was the only Man she thought
worthy her Esteem; and I find too much
satisfaction in believing her, to trouble
my head with any thing that might per∣suade
me to the contrary. At last, the
parting Hour being come, we took our
leaves at Day break; and to allay my
Fear, I pray'd her to put a Ribbon out of
the Window as a token that she got safe
home. I pass'd by soon after that way,
and seeing the Ribbon, was better satis∣fied
than the greatest Man in the world,
and thence went to the <HI>Park</HI> to see part
of the Feast.</P>
<P>This is the present state of my Affairs.
You may conclude from thence, that
things are never reduced to so desperate a
condition betwixt a Lover and his Mistress,
but that they may take a happy turn a∣gain.
I have sworn bitterly at my Lord
S. <HI>Albans,</HI> that I would never see her a∣gain
as long as I lived; you are a witness
to what a degree of Spite and Anger I
had raised my Thoughts, and how often
I have reproach'd myself. Good God▪
<PB N="484" REF="347"/>
is it possible one should commit a grosser
Error than this? I have shewn you her
Letters, I have told you things which
ought to have been buried in everlasting
Silence; I am only too happy to have
done these things before two Men who
can keep a Secret. What must have be∣come
of me by this time, had I put my
Confidence in Men of a suspected Faith?
In such a case, the Reputation of the Coun∣tess
must suffer for my extravagant Sur∣mises.
Learn to be wiser, by my Exam∣ple,
continu'd he, with a very serious
Countenance, and take this for a constant
Rule, that a gallant Man ought at no
time, nor upon any account whatever, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
revile a Lady, whether she has given him
occasion of Satisfaction or Complaint.
You talk at your own pleasure, my Lord
Duke, cry'd the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n:</HI> But
your Condition and mine being so diffe∣rent,
I am not surprized our Opinions
should be so too. You have all the rea∣son
to be satisfied, and I to complain. If
you have a mind to revive your Intreague
with my Lady, added the Duke, and will
leave the management of that Matter to
me, I am much mistaken if I don't bring
her back. I can scarce believe it, reply'd
the Earl; she has only too much reason
of Complaint against me; and when I
call to mind what harsh Treatment she
had from me, (believing that I spoke to
<HI>Emilia</HI>) I don't wonder to see her treat me
like a Stranger. Add to this, what the
<PB N="485" REF="348"/>
Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> does to gain her good
will, and the obliging way wherewith she
receives his Addresses. If this Prince was
to stay long in <HI>London,</HI> continu'd the Duke,
I would not swear for her, but that she
might be for a change; and that, were it
only for the pleasure of a compleat Re∣venge,
she might set you aside, and put
the Prince in your place; but at the worst
this would prove only an Intreague of a
few Weeks, which must end in trouble,
the natural consequence of absence. She
has loved you, and I'm sure she does not
hate you. Once more, will you have me
try for a Composition betwixt you? The
Earl paused a while, but at last desired
him to act in it with the same application
as if it were for himself.</P>
<P>The King having taken a resolution to
go to <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> and to take the
Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> along with him, in
order to divert him there with a Ball, the
next day every thing was got in readiness
to carry the Court thither by Water. The
Barges were cover'd with <HI>Persian</HI> Carpets,
the ground-work of Gold, and hung with
brocaded Tapestries of Rose colour and
Silk. Towards the Evening, the Court
having taken their respective Places in
the Barges, you saw them go forward by
the help of Oars upon that spacious Ri∣ver
the <HI>Thames,</HI> which is perhaps the
handsomest in the World. You heard the
Air resound with a most agreeable Sym∣phony
of Trumpets, Kettel-Drums, Flutes,
<PB N="486" REF="349"/>
Violins, Voices, Theorbes and Clave-Cymbals.
These different Instruments
produc'd different Chorus's, which play'd
every one in their turn; and the Con∣sort
was so well contriv'd, that no∣thing
could be more pleasing or enticing
in the World. The foreign Prince ad∣mir'd
the Beauty of <HI>London,</HI> where all
the great Houses, standing on the River-side,
are adorn'd with Balcones, and at that
time were fill'd with handsom Ladies, who
came to see the King in this Pomp, and
to hear the warlike Sound of the Kettel-Drums,
or the sweet Harmony of the
Violins. <HI>London</HI> affords the finest Pro∣spect
that can be imagin'd from the River
<HI>Thames,</HI> and I question whether any other
comes near it among all the other Cities
of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> having taken
notice that the Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> ad∣dress'd
himself more frequently to my
Lady—than to any of the other La∣dies
at Court, manag'd the matter so
as to place him next to her. And as she
was of opinion, that if any thing could recal
the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> it would be a point
of Jealousie, which often brings back the
fugitive Lover, and revives the Heart, so she
affected to have no other regard but for
the Prince, and to hear him with atten∣tion,
as if she was pleased and sensible of
what he said to her. He, on his part,
omitted nothing to make her accept of
the Gallantries he told her, and he was
<PB N="487" REF="350"/>
deserving enough to flatter himself he
should not meet with a Repulse; Won't
you think me too bold, Madam, said he,
if I take this opportunity to give you to
understand the progress you have made in
my Heart? I know I ought to endeavour
to gain your Inclinations by my Assiduity
and Services, and to convince you of mine
before I speak of them to you; but that
little Time I have to stay in this Court
being too short to hope for success that
way, I must, Madam, conjure you to
shorten my Pain, and to accept of the Of∣fer
I make you of a Heart which has not
as yet receiv'd such lively Impressions as
yours. It would be highly glorious for
me, said she, if I could flatter myself in∣to
a belief that you tell me the truth;
who can assure me of that Point? Man∣kind
make not the least scruple of impo∣sing
upon Ladies; and we know, by long
Experience, how dangerous you are; they
make it their business to ensnare them,
whilst they keep out of the Trap. Oh!
Madam, what is it you say? said the
Prince, interrupting her. Is it possible
you should imagine that one would covet
to be beloved only, and that by so aima∣ble
a Person as you are? You see 'tis I that
makes the beginning, and I should not fail
to make the conclusion, were I Master
of my Destiny, so as to stay with you as
long as I would. Alas! why were you
not born in my Country? or, why must I
leave yours? Don't disturb yourself upon
<PB N="488" REF="351"/>
that score, said she, I don't deserve your
care, and you would perhaps be unhap∣py
if you should engage too far upon
my account. For God's sake, cry'd he,
pray tell me the reason. The reason is,
because among my Friends I am always of
a sweet, even Temper, and in a good Hu∣mour;
but to those who pretend to more,
I am foolish, capricious and tyrannical;
I consider them no otherwise than my
Slaves; I have not the least complaisance
for them; I defy them and myself; and
if I find the least favourable Inclination
for them, I banish them for ever. I am
contented with all this, said the Prince;
only give me leave to serve you, and to
endeavour all means to please you; per∣haps
some more benign Star than that
which is predominant over those unfortu∣nate
Wretches you treat thus cruelly, may
alter the case in my behalf. This is a
stretch of Vanity, said my Lady, not un∣becoming
a Sovereign Prince. Well then,
Sir, serve me, I accept of you for my
Knight. And I you for my Lady, reply'd
he, with a merry Countenance; and turn∣ing
his Head, repeated with an indiffe∣rent
loud Voice that Verse out of the
<HI>French</HI> Tragedy of <HI>Cid:</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Appear you Navarrases, Moors and Castilians.</HEAD>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and the Earl
of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> who sat next to one another,
were at too great a distance from the
<PB N="489" REF="352"/>
Prince and my Lady to hear their Conver∣sation,
but could not miss of hearing these
l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Words, both of them understanding
<HI>French</HI> very well. The Earl told the Duke,
we need not doubt but that this young
Prince intends to bid defiance to all my
Ladies Lovers; had I no other Reflexion
to make than what relates to my Courage▪
I should soon appear in the List of them,
and make him know, that he is not the
<HI>Cid</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> What a fine pretence
you have found out of picking a Quarrel,
reply'd the Duke; would you have a Lover,
in the beginning of his Passion, talk like
Men who have their Reason and true Sen∣ses
about them? Be not uneasie, I will take
care of your Interest, and you shall have
no reason to be dissatisfy'd. Whilst they
were talking together, <HI>Nelly,</HI> who was in
the same Barge, had found out Matter of
Divertisement for the Ladies and Gentle∣men;
and among the rest, one which oc∣casioned
a great deal of Mirth. She de∣sir'd
the King to stop a little upon the
Water, the better to enjoy the benefit of
the fair Season and the melodious Har∣mony
of Musick. She then caused to be
brought forth some Angling Rods, with
silk Lines, the Hooks of Gold. The
King went to Angling with several others,
but could catch nothing, whereat the
Ladies laught very heartily, and the King
told them he would Angle no longer; and
so pulling up his Line, found half a dozen
of fry'd <HI>Smelts</HI> ty'd to the Hook with a
<PB N="490" REF="353"/>
silk Thread. He fell a laughing aloud,
and so did every body else. <HI>Nelly</HI> told
him, that so great a King should have
something peculiar above the rest; that
poor Fishermen catch Fish alive, but
his were ready dress'd. The Prince of
<HI>Newburg</HI> told them, that six being not
enough, he would try whether he could
take two or three more to the King's
Fish. He threw his Line, and feeling it
weighty, O Sire! said he, we shall live mer∣rily;
and so pulling it up, found a Purse ty'd
to the Hook which, being open'd, there
was in it a golden Case set with Stones, and
the Picture of my Lady—. This
occasion'd a general Mirth, and the King,
who was ignorant that <HI>Nelly</HI> had order'd
some Divers to tie the Fish and Picture
to the Hooks, was above all extreamly de∣lighted
with it. <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> said he, to
<HI>Nelly,</HI> caus'd a <HI>Sardine</HI> to be ty'd to <HI>Mark
Anthony</HI>'s Hook, but you exceed her in
your Contrivance, for you bestow Pictures,
which are much more acceptable. These
are Presents, said my Lady, (somewhat
concern'd) which cost her nothing. She
sent this Morning to my House, to tell
me, that she being inclin'd to have her
Picture drawn, she desir'd I would send
her mine, because she would take a view
of the Drapery. You see, Sir, to what
use she has put it. Nothing could hap∣pen
more agreeable to me, said the Prince;
I know not, said he, adressing himself to
<HI>Nelly,</HI> how to pay you my Respects suf∣ficiently.
<PB N="491" REF="354"/>
I should be very glad to merit
your Acknowledgments, answer'd she; but
you thank me for a good Office I had no
hand in. I believe these were the <HI>Najades</HI>
of the <HI>Thames,</HI> who perform'd this act of
Gallantry on purpose to oblige you, and
if my Lady has an inclination to see her
Picture this Night, I have it at home,
and will send for it.</P>
<P>Whilst every one was enjoying the
Sweets of an agreeable Conversation, the
Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> was the only Person who
appear'd extreamly Melancholy. He could
not, without much dissatisfaction, see the
Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> to take this opportuni∣ty
of telling a thousand pretty Things to
my Lady; and his Fancy, which was very
ingenious in tormenting him, suggested
that she had combin'd with <HI>Nelly</HI> to con∣vey,
by this means, her Picture to the
Prince; and tho' he heard her tell him
very seriously, that she desir'd he should
restore it to her immediately, he look'd
upon it only as a faint; his Jealousie ha∣ving
rekindled a more violent Fire in his
Heart, than all her Tenderness and Caras∣ses
could do before. The Duke of <HI>Buc∣kingham,</HI>
who read his Troubles in his Eyes,
would not leave him alone to his sad
Reflexions, but check'd and told him,
with a low Voice; do you see how care∣ful
I am of you, poor disturb'd confound∣ed
Lover; you don't as much as look at
<HI>Emilia,</HI> she has talk'd above a quarter of
an Hour to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with∣out
<PB N="492" REF="355"/>
your taking the least notice of it.
O my Lord, said the Earl, 'tis not worth
one's while, she is an inconsiderable, un∣constant
Woman, more fit to act her Part
in a Play, than to engage a Man of Ho∣nour;
I assure you I am quite clear of her,
and am vex'd at the Frailties I have been
guilty of upon her account.</P>
<P>The Barges went forward with an easie
Pace towards <HI>Hampton-Court;</HI> when on a
sudden they were surprized with the sight
of two others, exceeding all the rest in
Magnificence; besides that, their manner
of appearance had in it something peculiar
to raise one's Curiosity. The first of the
two was full of handsom well shap'd Men
dress'd like the Antick Knights, as we see
them still painted now a-days; in the
midst of them you saw one in the same
Habit, but in Armour, <HI>Capapie</HI> his 'Squire
standing by him, and holding his Helmet,
adorn'd with white Feathers. Upon a
rich Pacillion of Green and Gold, you saw
the Picture of a Lady, plac'd upon a Pe∣destal,
supported by <HI>Love,</HI> most curiously
Engraven. In the other Barge appear'd
nothing but Ladies attired like Nymphs,
with their Quivers hanging upon their
Backs, and their Arrows in their Hands.
A Lady, representing <HI>Diana,</HI> had the pre∣eminency
above all the rest, as well by
reason of the richness of her Cloaths and
Jewels, as by her Age; it being certain,
that never was so aged a <HI>Diana</HI> seen be∣fore;
however, she had certain ruins of
<PB N="493" REF="356"/>
Beauty, which were more valuable than
all her Attire. The King, and those that
attended him, soon discover'd him who
was in Armour in the first Barge to be
the Duke of—, and the Lady,
who represented the chast <HI>Diana,</HI> to be
his Wife. But the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI>
who knew nothing of them, took them
for a Band of Players, that were going to
act at some place or other near <HI>London,</HI>
till the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> undeceived
him. Do you see, said he, these Persons,
they have something very peculiar in them,
perhaps beyond any in the World. Him
whom you see there in the midst of the
other Gentlemen, is the Duke of—,
one of the greatest Lords in <HI>England,</HI> be∣ing
Master of an Estate of Twenty five
thousand Pounds a Year; and as there
are many other Lords of great Estates,
who love to be independent, they take
the least occasion of Complaint to retire
from Court into the Country, where they
lead an easie Life. This Duke has a most
magnificent Seat in the <HI>North,</HI> seated in
the midst of Woods and Rivers, and of a
very difficult access. This Solitude has
engaged both my Lord and my Lady to
reading to such an excess, that they spend
Day and Night in it; and being but lit∣tle
acquainted with the true choice of
Books, they are fall'n upon the reading
of <HI>Romances,</HI> and the Adventures of
Knight's Errant; these being things which
only suit their Pallates, and that to ad∣miration.
<PB N="494" REF="357"/>
Not only this, but they have
taken a fancy to imitate them, and to act
in their Country some of those marvelous
things, which the <HI>Amadis's</HI> and <HI>Knights<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Errant</HI> perform'd in all parts of the World.
Is it possible it should be as you tell me?
cry'd the Prince of <HI>Newburg.</HI> If you que∣stion
it, continu'd he, you may be satisfy'd
in it by the whole Court, and by the
Duke of—himself, who marry'd
his Daughter. There needs no farther
confirmation than your Word, my Lord,
said the young Prince; and besides this, I
need only consult my own Eyes, it being
not very natural to appear in such a Dress
without some extraordinary reason. My
Lady—, said the Duke, will some∣times
disguise herself like an <HI>Amazon;</HI> she
rides on Horseback, attended by nine
young Ladies of good Families, but with∣out
Fortunes: These she takes under her
Care, with a great deal of pleasure, and
sees them settl'd in the World, provided
they will comply to share with her in
these <HI>Romantick</HI> Fancies. The Duke acts
the Knight-Errant, he meets his Lady a∣broad
a Hunting, or perhaps taking her
rest in a Wood near some murmuring
Brook; he falls in love with her, and
makes his trusty 'Squire his Confident.
She, on her part, being an Heiress of the
<HI>Invisible Isle,</HI> or of some <HI>Enchanted Pa∣lace,</HI>
or representing <HI>Armide</HI> or <HI>Medea,</HI> is
charm'd with the goodly Mien of the love∣ly
Stranger; and notwithstanding she is
<PB N="495" REF="358"/>
engag'd already to a neighbouring Prince
of great Renown, being of the Stature
of a Giant, she declares to her Nurse, she
will marry nobody else but the <HI>Knight of
the Wood.</HI> These Preliminaries of Love
are follow'd by all manner of Gallantries,
or to speak properly, by all the Extrava∣gances
that can be imagin'd, such as Feasts,
Combats, and a thousand other Imperti∣nences;
and the whole concludes with
the Nuptials of this noble Pair.</P>
<P>This Ceremony is no sooner over, but
they torment their Brains to set up an∣other
fictitious Story; they are provided
with Actors for that purpose, richly attir∣ed,
and all other Necessaries, for they
are excessive Rich, spending but little,
but what they bestow upon such like Fop∣peries.
I can't be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir'd with hearing your
Relation, my Lord, said the Duke of
<HI>Newburg,</HI> and a small matter would incline
me to go to visit them at their Seat, to
become a Spectator of one of the purest
diverting Comedies that a Man can well
see. Before they had quite finish'd their
Discourse, they saw a Boat coming from
the Duke's Barge, in which was his 'Squire
and two Watermen. The King having
stopt his own Barge, they drew near to
it, and the 'Squire began thus: Sire, the
Duke of—, my Master, offers his
most humble and profound Services to
your Royal Majesty, and salutes the
whole illustrious Company that attends
you; he desires to know, whether there
<PB N="496" REF="359"/>
is amongst them all, a Knight, who will
maintain that his Lady is a more exqui∣site
Beauty than she whose Picture you
see there upon that glorious Pavillion?
And under your Majesty's good leave, I
will conduct him safely to my Lord Duke,
that they may make trial in the open Field,
which of them two is most capable of
maintaining the Beauty of her he loves.
In spite of all the Gravity the King had
affected, during this Harangue, he could
not forbear laughing two or three times;
but soon reassuming his serious Air, go
tell your Master, said he, 'tis impossible
to discover the Lineaments of the Picture
he so much boasts of, at such a distance,
that he must send it to us, that we may
be able to judge whether he is in the
right or not, and that then he shall have
his Answer. The 'Squire hereupon, pulls
out of his Pocket a Picture, telling the
King, this was the Copy of the fair Ori∣ginal
which his Master adored. There
was scarce any body there but what knew
it to be the Picture of the old Dutchess,
painted in a Shepherdess's Habit, with a
Garland of Flowers about her Temples,
such as we commonly see <HI>Astrea</HI> presented
by the Painters. The King could not for∣bear
laughing aloud at the sight thereof,
and the 'Squire would have done the same,
but that he durst not. This Lady is too
beautiful, said the King, for any one to
pretend to dispute the precedency with
her; I am sure every one here will sub∣mit.
<PB N="497" REF="360"/>
Not at so easie a rate, said the
Prince of <HI>Newburg;</HI> I have a mind,
Sire, to maintain the Beauty of this Lady,
whereof I here shew you the Picture, and
whose Knight I declare myself to be; he
produced that of my Lady—, and
comparing it with the other; Your Maje∣sty
shall judge, continued he, which of
these has the most Perfections. That of
the Shepherdess, cry'd the King; Prince,
upon this occasion, Justice must prevail a∣bove
Favour; and as you have a bad Cause,
my Judgment is, you must own you are
in the wrong at present, and that nothing
but a blind Prejudice can be alledg'd in
your behalf. The 'Squire departed to
give an account to his Master of his good
Success. Never was any Man better
pleas'd, he ran and told it the Dutchess,
who conceived so much Joy thereat, that
she was not her own Mistress, nor could
contain herself within the bounds of a
<HI>Decorum;</HI> but as her Barge pass'd by that
of the King's, she stood as upright as a
Dart, being so fully persuaded of her ha∣ving
got the better of all the Ladies that
were there present, that she afforded
sufficient matter of Mirth to the Court,
for that time.</P>
<P>You must understand, said the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> that
no Woman in the World takes more pains
to preserve her Beauty, than this Lady
you have seen just now; an Empirick, no
less extravagant than herself, had persuad∣ed
<PB N="498" REF="361"/>
her to have a Man well fatten'd, and
afterwards to destil him, the Water
whereof, he told her, would revive her
Youth more effectually than the <HI>Fountain
of Youth.</HI> She not questioning but that
the Secret must be good, because it was
rare, found means to get a young Fellow,
of a beautiful Complexion, whom she
shut up in a Room, and caus'd him to be
fed with the best Dainties that could be
had. His whole time being employ'd in
eating and sleeping, he fatten'd apace,
and so often as the Dutchess came to look
upon him, she would be sure to tell him,
<HI>Friend, cram thyself well.</HI> At last the
Fellow being curious to know what made
her so careful of his Belly; he ask'd the
reason of him who us'd to bring him his
Provisions? What, said he, do'st thou not
know, that, so soon as thou beest well
fatten'd, thou must be cut to pieces, and
be put into an Alembic for Destillation,
to make the Dutchess young again? At
these Words, the poor Prisoner, being
ready to die with Fear, grew leaner and
leaner every Day with the Thoughts of
his approaching Destiny; so that at last
resembling more a Skeleton than a Man,
and the Dutchess seeing him in this mise∣rable
Condition, set him at Liberty. She
was laying out for another to be fatten'd
for the same purpose: When the King
having got notice of her Designs, sent her
word, that he would advise her rather to
run the risque of being Old, than of his
<PB N="499" REF="362"/>
Indignation; and that if she committed
such a barbarous Act, she might well be
assur'd, he would never pardon it. I must
tell you, said the Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> a
Man ought to be an eye witness of these
things, before one can give credit to them;
however, your Discourse is very divert∣ing.
There are Stories enough of her,
which will hold us till we come to
<HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> said <HI>Nelly;</HI> as for instance,
She had caus'd six Bulls to be train'd up
to draw her Coach, which was of such a
bulk, that there were but few Streets
broad enough to afford it a passage. How∣ever,
she would make her Appearance in
<HI>Hide-Park</HI> with her new Equipage; but
no sooner began the Bulls to move for∣ward,
when the Mob beginning to hallow,
so frightned the Bulls, that they ran away
with the Coach, dash'd it all to pieces,
and the Lady had enough to do to save
her Life. So she was cur'd of her fancy
of training up Bulls.</P>
<P>This is a pleasant Adventure, said the
Dutchess of <HI>Richmond,</HI> but you must all con∣fess,
it does not come up to what she did
at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> You must know, that the
Dutchess seldom came to Court; and as
the Queen used to make her her Diversi∣on,
she order'd me to bring her to the
Circle. I knew she was lately come out
of the Country, I went to Compliment
her in her Majesties Name, and after∣wards
ask'd her, whether she would not
pay her Respects to her? I would do her
<PB N="500" REF="363"/>
that Honour with all my heart, said she,
provided she would honour me with some
peculiar Mark of Distinction. I don't
question, said I, but that the Queen will
do it with a great deal of pleasure. Then,
reply'd she, pray desire her, that my nine
Nymphs may hold up my Gown whilst
I am at the Circle. The Dutchesses in
<HI>France</HI> enjoy the Privilege of the Stool,
but this is not allow'd of in <HI>England,</HI> or
at least our Train can't be held up without
particular leave. I promised her I would
speak to the Queen about it, and that
myself was so far concern'd in it, as not
to neglect he Matter. Truly, said she,
it is the common Cause you are going to
plead, and it will be very glorious for
you in time to come, to read in our Histo∣ries,
that it was the Dutchess of <HI>Rich∣mond,</HI>
Daughter to the brave Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> who obtain'd that Privilege
from the Queen. I gave the Queen an
account of what had pass'd in our inter∣view,
who laught very heartily, but
would not allow of that Privilege. I gave
the Dutchess an account of my ill Success,
who was much vex'd at it. But, said she,
let me alone, I will shew you I don't
want Wit. Within two Days after she
came to the Circle, in a Gown of black
Velvet, the Ground-work Gold, and al∣most
covered with Jewels. The Train of
the Gown was of such a length that its
extremity reach'd into the Guard Chamber,
where it was held up by her nine Ladies;
<PB N="501" REF="364"/>
it appear'd like a blazing Star, which
reach'd through all the Appartments, and
I give you leave to guess, whether this
very Fancy was not the Subject of Diver∣sion
to all the World, and whether any
of us might have an inclination to imi∣tate
it.</P>
<P>The Barges were now come to the
landing place: Whilst my Lady <HI>Richmond</HI>
was yet a talking, and whilst she and
<HI>Nelly</HI> were entertaining the Prince of
<HI>Newburg,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> ad∣dress'd
himself to my Lady—; You
act most egregiously the Coquet, said he,
if you can but hold this Humour, you
will be sure to catch somebody or other in
the Net. No Woman in the World,
said she, loves Coquettry less than I, but
I am a little revengeful, and my business
is to be even with an ungrateful Person.
Oh! Madam, you have done your busi∣ness
too much, reply'd the Duke; the
poor Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> feels the effects of
your just Indignation, which touches him
to the very Heart. He has not so much
Goodness in him, added my Lady, as to
be capable of repenting; but I am apt to
believe, he is fall'n out with <HI>Emilia,</HI>
and has a mind to raise in her some little
Jealousie, in order to be friends with her
again. Madam, continu'd the Duke, you
are not a Woman to be made use of for a
Cloak, and I can't have patience to hear
you treat yourself so indifferently, meer∣ly
to gratifie your own desire of abusing
<PB N="502" REF="365"/>
the Earl. Your Charity, my Lord, said
she smiling, is very extensive; and not∣withstanding
all this, you will find it a
hard Task to convince me; I have certain
causes of Prejudice against this ungrateful
Man, which will prove undeniable. I am
not come here, said he, to justifie him,
I will own him to be as guilty as you
would have him, and as he actually has
been; call to mind his Inconstancy, and
how he made a Sacrifice of so well-fix'd
a Passion to the love he had for your Rival;
don't forget the Instability of his Conduct
towards you, but after having remember'd
all that has rais'd your Anger against him,
remember it is the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> who
was once so dear to you, and is so still;
he returns to you full of Tenderness and
Submission, reduc'd to Despair for having
disoblig'd you; and that, to make you
forget his Faults committed against you,
there is nothing but what you may not
expect from his Complaisance. Believe
me, Madam, before you bid him quite
farewel, consult your own Heart. You
are very urgent, said she, if you would
have me advise with my own Heart, you
must allow me time to put the Question.
No, Madam, answer'd the Duke, my
Honour lies at stake, I engaged to the Earl,
to bring him his Pardon seal'd by yourself,
a longer delay may throw some Obstacles
in the way. You have promised what
was not in your power, reply'd she, and
I should be very unwilling to be a Gua∣rantee
<PB N="503" REF="366"/>
for those Treaties you make: Is
it possible for a Minister of State to en∣gage
so far without considering the Mat∣ter?
Let us talk with the Earl, said the
Duke interrupting her; cast an eye upon
him; see whether he has not the whole
Air of a Person touch'd to the Heart.
That is true, continu'd she, but 'tis per∣haps
<HI>Emilia</HI> that is the occasion of it.
No certainly, Madam, said he, drawing
nearer, <HI>Emilia</HI> has no farther Pretensions
to my Heart, 'tis in your Possession alone,
and it owns nobody for its Soveraign
but you. Pray, said she to him, how
long is it since you have learn'd the Se∣cret
of what one says at so great a distance
from you, and that with so low a Voice,
that we scarce could hear one another?
Let us not talk of that, Madam, said he,
but how I came to displease you; let us
discourse of my Repentance, and the As∣siduities
I intend to pay you, to blot out
the ill Impressions I have made in your
Heart. I shall return you no answer, said
she, till you have satisfy'd my Curiosity,
in telling me, by what Miracle you over∣heard
me. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> said
he, can tell you better than I; 'tis he that
put me in the way of it.</P>
<P>Because you are so resolute, reply'd the
Duke, you must know, that a certain
Person came to me some time ago with
an Offer to make in my Laboratory what
they call among the Artists, <HI>The Great
Work,</HI> or commonly the <HI>Philosophers Stone.</HI>
<PB N="504" REF="367"/>
'Tis a thing I have been always very fond
of; but the best <HI>Philosophers Stone</HI> that I
could wish for, would be to cure me of
the desire of finding it. I must interrupt
you, my Lord, said my Lady, to ask
you, whether the desire of making Gold
is not an effect of Avarice? As to what
concerns myself, I don't think it, con∣tinu'd
he, for I want rather to know the
Secret for Curiosity's sake, than for its
Usefulness; and if I was to make any
use of it, it should be only to enrich
others, and to keep myself from Po∣verty.</P>
<P>The Person who pretended to have this
Secret, shew'd a great deal of Modera∣ton
and Prudence in his Actions, had a
vast Memory, spoke little, but very well,
was very well vers'd in all the terms of
Art, and appear'd very sincere. The
matter requir'd a long Preparation, he
liv'd in my House, amus'd me with a
thousand Inventions, which would not
have pass'd for current with a Man less
prepossess'd than I was with the notion
of obtaining the Secret. At last, being
quite tir'd out with those continual De∣lays
wherewith he had fed my Impati∣ence
hitherto; I told him positively, that
I would not be jested with any longer,
and that he must either make Gold, or
else I would throw him out of the Win∣dow.</P>
<P>This Alternative seeming somewhat
too hard for him, and not knowing what
<PB N="505" REF="368"/>
to do at this slippery Conjuncture, he at
last judged that a sincere confession of his
Ignorance might have a better influence
upon me than all the fictitious Pretences
he could alledge; he threw himself at
my Feet, and, after a little Preamble,
begg'd my Pardon; telling me, with a
great deal of Sincerity, he had but a
very indifferent Knowledge in the Pre∣paration
of the <HI>Philosopher Stone,</HI> but
that, if I pleased, he would make me a
small Horn to be put into the Ear, and so
small that it might be hid under the Hair;
and that keeping at a certain distance,
provided the Wind came from the same
Corner where I stood, I might hear what
others said, let them speak never so low.
This Proposition appeased in some mea∣sure
my Anger, I order'd him to go about
it immediately; and I found him no Lyer
in that point, as I had in the other.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> urging me to
speak to you in his behalf, I promised
him I would, and at the same time giv∣ing
him the Horn, he by the help thereof
overheard our Discourse. This is no bet∣ter
than betraying one's Friend, cry'd my
Lady; should I not be very much pleas'd
if I had told you something which I
would not have confided to any body
else? I should have kept the Secret as
well as himself, Madam, said the Earl,
and I think myself very happy to have
some share in it; I am sure I will never
make any ill use of it. My Lady—
<PB N="506" REF="369"/>
was well pleas'd with their Discourse,
but he had been too much wanting in his
Respect, to pardon him so soon; she
would make him suffer for his Fault; so
looking upon him with an affected In∣differency,
Certainly, said she, you must
have but a very indifferent opinion of me,
if you imagine I can forget so soon your
Faults; don't you know, the more one
loves, the more one hates? He would
not acknowledge any thing against him∣self,
but endeavour'd to convince her she
was too rigorous, when they saw the
King going ashoar, and every body ma∣king
what haste he could to follow him;
The Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> among the rest,
was very forward to come up with my
Lady—, to give her his Hand, be∣fore
the Dutchess of <HI>Richmond</HI> and
<HI>Nelly.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas pretty late before they entred
the Palace; but the darkness of the
Night was supplied by a most noble Illu∣mination,
by the King's orders. After a
noble Supper, every one went into the
Garden; and the Company was most
agreeably surpriz'd to see in the middle
of a Square, which faced several Walks,
a Theatre erected, where the Players act∣ed
a very diverting Piece. The King was
seated next to <HI>Nelly,</HI> the Prince of <HI>New∣burg</HI>
next to my Lady—, and the
Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> behind her. The Duke
of <HI>Monmonth</HI> perceiving Madam—
and <HI>Emilia</HI> to look with a jealous Eye
<PB N="507" REF="370"/>
upon one another, kept at some distance,
to remove all occasion of dispute betwixt
them. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> seeing
himself without his dear Countess, en∣tred
into a separate Conversation with
my Lord of S. <HI>Albans.</HI> I am overjoy'd,
said the Earl to the Duke, to have this
opportunity of satisfying my Curiosity:
Pray tell me, did you see the Countess?
Yes, my Lord, said he, I have seen her,
and am charm'd with her: How far is a
Man mistaken, to imagine one may be
cured of an excessive Love Passion at plea∣sure.
I protest to you, my Fetters are
stronger than ever; and my distracted
Mind, which was a continual torment to
me before, is now in the most agreeable
state of Tranquillity that can be imagin'd.
I congratulate your Happiness, reply'd he,
and could wish the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> was
under the same happy Circumstances: I
find he is exceeding Melancholy; do you
know the reason? He is jealous, said
the Duke; are you acquainted with that
Devil, call'd <HI>Jealousy?</HI> Whoever is pos∣sess'd
with this <HI>Daemon,</HI> must bid fare∣wel
to Reason, had he the best Head∣piece
in the world. He is to be pitied,
continu'd the Earl; and after what has
happen'd, he ought to think no more of
<HI>Emilia.</HI> Do you believe 'tis for <HI>Emilia?</HI>
said the Duke; and for whom else? askt
the Earl. 'Tis for my Lady—, an∣swer'd
the Duke, I am heartily glad of
it, reply'd the Earl of S. <HI>Albans.</HI> Truly,
<PB N="508" REF="371"/>
I could not but pity her; but pray only
look upon her now, and see whether she
does not appear with a triumphant Air?
Nothing makes a Lady look brisker, than
when she has recover'd her Lover. And
tho' you see the young Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI>
entertain her at this time, I'm sure she
wishes him in <HI>Germany.</HI> I question that,
return'd the Earl; the Addresses of a Per∣son
of his Rank in the World, are sel∣dom
receiv'd with so much Indifferency.
Pray observe the motion of her Eyes
when she looks at him: This does not
seem as if she was not well pleas'd. Oh!
my Lord, said the Duke, you make me
mad when you put me in mind how the
Spirit of Coquettry reigns both in the
Head and Heart of Women. This Rule
admits of an Exception, reply'd the Earl.
I am of opinion you need not fear any
thing upon that score from your Coun∣tess;
and as for my Lady, I am apt to
believe she knows what she is doing. His
Judgment prov'd not amiss, her Inclina∣tions
being for the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n;</HI>
but being resolv'd to chastise him, she
had pitch'd upon the young Prince as the
fittest Instrument to attain her end. They
did not speak so low but that the Earl
of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> who made use of the
Duke's Horn, overheard part of what they
said.</P>
<P>Tho' I was sure, said the young Prince
to the fair my Lady, to be jeer'd soundly
by you, I can't forbear telling you, that I
<PB N="509" REF="372"/>
am angry with myself for not accepting
the Duke's Challenge; Being engag'd
by Fortune, which put your Picture into
my hands, and by the honour you have
done me, in accepting me for your Knight,
to maintain your Beauty. Neither of
these two, reply'd my Lady, has put any
Obligation upon you. Those Times are
past when such kind of chimerical No∣tions
used to vanquish Reason, and make
People cut one another's Throats for a
Lady. And, said he, Madam, don't we
love now as they used to do in former
Times? And since our Sentiments are
the same, why should not the Effects be
answerable to them? For my part, I
should have been overjoy'd to have had
this opportunity of making the Duke
of—speak with more respect of
your Beauty, than of any he ever saw be∣fore.
And for my part, said she, I should
have been very much concern'd to see
myself made the Subject of so odd an
Adventure; and if you were ever in ear∣nest
to oblige me, this would not have been
the right way to do it. The E. of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI>
had a great inclination to make the third
Person in their Conversation, either to
interrupt their Discourse, or to repartee
upon the Prince for pretending to fight a
Man who was noted throughout the
Kingdom for such-like odd Adventures of
his own contrivance; but that his Respect
for my Lady, and his fear of disobliging
<PB N="510" REF="373"/>
her, made him refrain from this piece of
Curiosity.</P>
<P><HI>Emilia</HI> never had a worse time of it
than during this Play, whither she was
come in company of one of her Relations,
The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did not sit near
her, and Madam—kept her Eyes
so steadfast upon her, that he had not so
much opportunity as to afford her one
obliging Look▪ He himself was as little
pleased with it as his two Mistresses;
and the best comfort he had for the pre∣sent,
was to enter into a Discourse with
my Lord <HI>Grey</HI> upon that Subject. I am
resolv'd, said he, to fix myself; nothing
can be more troublesom than to be pe∣stred
with two at a time, each of which
claims an equal Prerogative of calling
you to an account for what you do; and
if you prefer one, yon must disoblige the
other: 'Tis quite otherwise if you love
one at a time. That's true, said my
Lord; but supposing this only Mistress
should not be very well, and consequently
can't stir abroad to meet you, or her jea∣lous
Husband will keep her at home,
then you are left destitute; whereas, if
you have three or four, you are sure ne∣ver
to miss or want; and if you happen
to meet them together, the Pleasure is
the greater. You preach a Doctrine, said
the Duke smiling, you do not practise
yourself: I know more of your Intreagues
than you think for, and perhaps more
than you are willing I should. What
<PB N="511" REF="374"/>
can you know, said my Lord, of a Man
that scarce stirs from his Family, who as
yet acts the Lover with his Wife, and
whose Pleasure is centred in a Father and
Mother in Law? No question, return'd
the Duke, with something of a malicious
Similer, but my Lord <HI>Barkley</HI> is the
Man that pleases you best, and Madam
<HI>Barkley</HI> has found means to be with
you; but there is another you for∣got
to mention, she is the Mirrour of
Beauty and Sweetness; what do you
say to her? I say, reply'd my Lord
<HI>Grey,</HI> not without some confusion,
she is a Child, and I take so little
notice of her, that were she not my
Relation, I should scarce know there
was such a one living. We will say no
more then, said the Duke, but I'll tell
you as a Secret, that I don't intend to
continue much longer at Court, being re∣solv'd
not to lead such an idle Life for the
future as I now do: I find my Heart tells
me, I was made for greater things than
to trifle away all my time with Women;
and if the King will bestow upon me
the Command of the <HI>English</HI> Troops in
<HI>France,</HI> I shall be very ambitious to sig∣nalize
myself in that Post.</P>
<P>The Play being done, the King and the
Court retir'd every one to his Lodgings.
The next day the Ladies went abroad
with the King a hunting, so gallantly
dress'd, that the Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> de∣clar'd
several times, the <HI>English</HI> Ladies
<PB N="512" REF="375"/>
surpass'd all the Women in the World.
Whilst the King and the Court were a
hunting, my Lady—staid at home,
pretending to have the Head-Ach, but
in effect to try what the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI>
would do upon this occasion. He attend∣ed
the King till hunting was begun, then
slipping aside unperceiv'd by any, he clap'd
Spurs to his Horse, and so return'd to
<HI>Hampton Court.</HI> As this took up some
considerable time, my Lady—appear'd
much our of humour, and very uneasie,
walking up and down the Room, up∣braiding
herself with having such favour∣able
Sentiments for the Earl, who had
given her such convincing Proofs of the
little Respect he bore her: But, when she
saw him suddenly enter the Room, her
Satisfaction was so great, that in vain she
endeavour'd to conceal it, but found her∣self
insensibly betray'd, both by her Eyes
and Heart, and in spite of herself, and
all her Resolution, pardon'd her submis∣sive
Lover; And to convince him how
far she preferr'd him before the Prince of
<HI>Newburg,</HI> she promised him to go back to
<HI>Whitehall</HI> the next Day. 'Tis easie to
imagine with what Satisfaction the Earl
embraced these tender and obliging Of∣fers,
and that he gave all possible assu∣rances
of his Gratitude and Acknowledg∣ment.
The King was no sooner return'd
from hunting, but he ask'd after my Lady,
and being told she had the Head-Ach, he
went to visit her, taking the young Prince

(who appear'd much concern'd thereat)
along with him. After a general Conver∣sation
of a few Minutes, the King went
away, telling him he left him in good
Company, and desiring my Lady—
and some other Ladies, there present, to
entertain him.</P>
<P>Can you imagine, Madam, said he,
drawing nearer unto her with a low Voice,
can you imagine, I should have taken
the least Diversion in this Hunting? To
know you to be so ill, and not to be near
you, and now to be confined to so little
time to stay here; all these Reflexions
cause the most cruel Torments to me that
can be imagin'd. You speak so seriously, said
she, that to return you a suitable Answer,
I am oblig'd to tell you, that so long as
our Conversation runs upon Amusements,
such as might be pleasing to you, I did
accept of your engaging Expressions, look∣ing
upon them no otherwise than Pas∣times;
but since I am forced to speak to
you upon other Terms, I declare to you,
I am not fond of having that Reputation
in the World, to say you had a more
peculiar Esteem for me, than for all the
rest of the Ladies of our Court. The
Prince was highly surpriz'd at such an
Answer; but being of a haughty Temper,
and still Master of his Heart, he told her,
in a very obliging manner: The Sentence
you pronounce against me, Madam, seems
to me premediated for a considerable time
before. I confess, I want Merits to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="514" REF="377"/>
myself to be able to please a Lady of
so exquisite a Palate, and you look upon
me to be a poor Traveller, fit to be turn'd
off with the first opportunity. 'Tis done,
Madam, this Moment shall be the last of
my Life, to tell you I love you. He had
scarce spoke these Words, but rising from
his Seat, took his leave of the Ladies with
a most profound Reverence. They look'd
at one another, much surprized, and my
Lady most of all, tho' she, being the Per∣son
that knew the Cause, should have
shewn the least. But notwithstanding her
firm Resolution of bestowing her Heart
entirely upon the Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> and
that it was to oblige him she had made
this Answer to the young Prince, she was
not very well pleased to see him take her
so punctually at her Word.</P>
<P>The King intended to stay for some Days
longer at <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> but upon the
News of the Queen's being not very well,
he went to <HI>London</HI> the next Morning; for
it must be own'd, they always liv'd in a
very good Harmony, and if she was not so
happy as to be Mistress of his Heart, yet
he always had so much Respect and Defe∣rence
to her, as in a great measure sup∣ply'd
the defects of an entire Union; and
upon this occasion, the Queen was so sen∣sible
of the King's Goodness, that this prov'd
the chief cause of her sudden Recovery.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Newburg,</HI> who had flat∣ter'd
himself with vain Hopes, now see∣ing
himself disappointed by my Lady,
<PB N="515" REF="378"/>
resolv'd to leave the Kingdom. But
speaking to the King about it, he urged
him to stay till his Birth-day was past.
Upon this occasion, all the Ladies and
Gentlemen appearing at Court in the ut∣most
Splendor, the Prince took extream
delight in seeing them. The Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> did more than once endeavour
to discourse <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but could find
no opportunity, because he was so nar∣rowly
watch'd by Madam—. She
finding the Duke out of humour, ask'd
him, what made him so uneasie? Oh!
said she, how can you answer to be thus
dissatisfy'd while you are with me? I
can't be otherwise, reply'd he, when I re∣flect
upon your jealous and mistrustful
Temper, that you watch me with your
Eyes, and would make me accountable to
you for a Look, a Sigh, nay, for the least
thing that can be. Oh! my Lord, said
she, I think you are too happy, to have
no other Matter of Complaint against
me; what thus affects you, ought to be
remembred to my advantage by you, if
your Heart was capable of knowing the
true value of mine; but I find one must
love you according to your capacity;
you rather play the Coquet, than the
part of an engaging Lover. I am
free to tell you, this does not well agree
with my Constitution; and therefore you
will much oblige me, if you will be
pleased to tell me your real Mind
at once. Well, Madam, reply'd the
<PB N="516" REF="379"/>
Duke, briskly, because you command me,
I declare, that if you any longer pretend
to traverse all my Designs, and to prove
vexatious to those I esteem, you and I
must break off for ever. You shall have
my consent, cry'd she, interrupting him,
you shall have it with more pleasure on
my side, than ever I heard you Vows and
Protestations. Bestow them where you
think fit, I readily resign all the Power
and Right you gave me over your Heart;
and I will retake Possession of my own.
Love <HI>Emilia,</HI> love <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but take
heed not to love me any more. With
these Words she arose, in order to take
another Seat. The Duke being surprized
thereat, would have held her by her
Gown; but, full of Anger as she was,
going away, did not perceive that the
Duke took out of her Pocket a Case,
which by its outward appearance seem'd
to contain a Picture. He had then no
opportunity of leaving the Queen's Ap∣partment
in order to look upon it; tho'
he was impatient, to the highest degree,
to see it, being at that juncture taken with
a jealous fit, that seem'd but little suit∣able
to a Man of so inconstant a Temper
as he was. But these sudden Motions
of Jealousie are not so very extraordinary,
they proceeding sometimes rather from
Self love, than from any Passion for an∣other
Person. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
made trial of this Truth, and this was
<PB N="517" REF="380"/>
not the first time he had occasion to
do so.</P>
<P>The King's Birth day being celebrated
with all possible Grandeur and Magni∣ficence,
the Prince of <HI>Newburg</HI> appear'd
as well satisfy'd as he could. My Lady
being the only Person who knew the true
Condition of his Heart, and the reason of
his discovering a certain intermixture of
Sadness, whereof she was the cause. The
Earl of <HI>A</HI>—<HI>n</HI> triumph'd both over his
Rival and the inconstant <HI>Emilia,</HI> and
tasted all the Sweets and Pleasures of a
happy Reconciliation; and after his unhap∣piness,
wanted nothing now to compleat
his good Fortune but the Absence of the
Prince of <HI>Newburg;</HI> neither was it long
before he saw his wishes accomplish'd
that way as well as in other respects.
The Prince, having taken leave of the
King, departed, without bidding farewel
to my Lady. However, he went first
to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to take a view of that fa∣mous
University. He was receiv'd there
with extraordinary marks of Honour, and
with the same Ceremonies the Prince of
<HI>Tuscany</HI> had there before; he was creat∣ed
Doctor of Law, and presented with a
Book full of curious Pieces in Miniature,
containing the History of that University.
As he was looking upon these Pictures,
he espy'd one among the rest which he
thought had a great resemblance to my
Lady—, so that upon comparing
them, he could guess no otherwise than
<PB N="518" REF="381"/>
that it was a Copy of her. This made
him break out into Sighs, and to com∣plain
of his Misfortune, of seeing the
Idea of a Person which he intended to
banish for ever from his Mind, reviv'd there
afresh: He shut the Book, put up the
Picture, and leaving <HI>England,</HI> sought
for the remedy of his Love in another
place.</P>
<P>Give me leave, dear Cousin, to stop
here; if I find these <HI>Memoirs</HI> to prove
acceptable to you, I will oblige you with
the Conclusion of those Adventures
whereof, as yet, you have learn'd only
the Beginning. In those you will be en∣tertain'd
with more serious Matters; tho'
what you have read hitherto, is intermix'd
with some Tragical Scenes; but I am
resolv'd to go no farther, till you have
given me your opinion of this.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>I Am going to fatigue myself with a
long Letter to you, Madam, in
hopes of entertaining you for an
Hour. I wish I may not be disappointed,
and in giving myself Pain, afford your
Ladyship no Pleasure. The truth or pro∣bability
I leave to your Censure: I have
nothing to offer against either, but a Wo∣man's
Malice, which, when aninated by
Revenge, is generally powerful enough
to make her blacken the most Innocent.</P>
<P>The little Interest I have in the World
must always be at the devotion of the
fair Sex; and it has been my good For∣tune
sometimes to render 'em Services.
A young Lady, who has it in her power
of commanding me as she pleases, not
long since recommended to me an Affair
of an elderly Gentlewoman's, who had
been a Favourite (in a late Reign) of the
then She-Favourite, but has since been aban∣don'd
by her, (whether grown out of use or
for some other reason) Disgust and Neg∣lect
has succeeded her Care and Kindness;
nor could all her former secret Services
oblige her to remember her as she ought,
tho' in an Occasion where it was to do
<PB N="522" REF="384"/>
herself no Hurt: She ungratefully refus'd
to use her Interest to the Lord Keeper in
a Cause she had depending, (where I had
the opportunity of serving h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r) as she
might easily have done, without any Pre∣judice
to herself. This so transported the
old Lady, (with Anger and Resentment)
that I think there is nothing she would
not attempt for her Revenge. She told
me in her Rage a thousand dangerous Se∣crets
against my Lady—; pre∣tended
Gratitude to me, set her upon
paying my Score at her cost. One part of
her Entertainment I here present your La∣dyship.
But before you imagine her the
Speaker, allow me to say something by
way of Introduction.</P>
<P>You must remember, Madam, that
some Years since, one Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>l</HI>—<HI>n,</HI> (who
was known about the Town by the Name
of Beau <HI>W</HI>—<HI>l</HI>—<HI>n</HI>) from very mean Cir∣cumstances
and an obscure Condition, set
up an Equipage, and made a Figure be∣yond
many of the Nobility. After bla∣zing
some few Years, (I can't exactly tell
how long) he was kill'd by one Mr. L.
going to fight a Duel with him; the re∣port
ran, that L. murder'd him before he
could draw his Sword: Nor could it ever
be discover'd, either before or since his
death, who it was that had supported
him in all that Grandeur. Most certain
it is, that being a younger Brother, his
Friends had procur'd him a Colours, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Post he was sent to serve in <HI>Flan∣ders;</HI>
<PB N="523" REF="385"/>
where he had not long continu'd,
but he was broke, as some report, for
Cowardice. But be it as it would, he
might well say with <HI>Themistocles, That
he had been lost if he had not been lost:</HI>
For such were his Necessities, that a then
Colonel (but since, by the death of his
Father, a Baronet) lent (but as he thought
gave) him forty Shillings to serve him in
his Passage back for <HI>England.</HI> Here,
within a small time, he appear'd the
brightest Star in the Hemisphere: His
Coaches, Saddle, Hunting, Race Horses;
Equipage, Dress and Table, were the ad∣miration
of the World, and continu'd such,
when they saw him continue them, and that
they could not assign any support to all
this Glory. He never play'd, or but inconsi∣siderably;
Entertain'd with Profuseness
all who visited him: Himself drank libe∣rally;
but in all Hours, as well sober as
otherwise, he kept a strict guard upon his
Words; tho' several were either employ'd
by the Curiosity of others, or their own,
to take him at his looser Moments, and
persuade him to reveal his Secret. But
he so inviolably preserv'd it, that even
their Guesses were but at random, and
without probability or foundation. He
was not known to be an admirer of La∣dies;
for amidst all his Diversions, we
(that way) hear no news of his Pleasures;
tho' he might, doubtless, have had the
good Fortune to have pleased, his Person be∣ing
no ways despicable. What adds to our
<PB N="524" REF="386"/>
Surprize, is, That he appropriated none
of his Hours; he was at all times to be
found, and ever with some of his People;
seemingly open in Conversation, free
from Spleen or Chagrin; in a word, he
had that settl'd Air, as if he were assur'd
his good Fortune would for ever continue.
One of his Friends advis'd him to Pur∣chase
whilst he had Money. Mr. <HI>W</HI>—
thank'd him, and said, He did not forget
the future in the present, he was oblig'd
to him for his Counsel, but whilst he
liv'd it would be ever thus, for he was
always certain to be Master of such a
sum of Money. This more and more
confounded the World: For, if they
would say he deriv'd his good Fortune
from the Ladies, there was scarce any
rich enough to support him, neither did
he bestow any of his Time unaccounted
for; and 'tis not to be believ'd that the
fair Sex, being such rigid Creditors in
Love, would not, at least, expect Use-fruit
for their Money, especially for such
considerable Sums. Those who pretend
to guess better, have recourse to Chimi∣stry,
(I mean such as have faith in the
<HI>Hermetick Phylosophy</HI>) and said he had
found <HI>The Grand Secret,</HI> and was Master
of that unvaluable <HI>Transmuting Stone,</HI>
at least of a Powder that had power to
make Gold of Silver. But whence should
he have this Discovery? Who could be
found so obliging to bestow such a For∣tune
upon an obscure Person, unac∣quainted
<PB N="525" REF="387"/>
to the whole Set of Pretenders
in <HI>Trismegistus</HI>'s Art? What <HI>Raymudus
Lullius</HI> would impart this darling Secret
to an Useless, Illiterate, Unknown? Or
say it were bestow'd upon him, when
did he find time for the Operation? Or
if he had, during his being private,
wrought sufficient for his Life, why did
he not Purchase with it? Or what be∣came
of that precious Metal? an incon∣derable
Sum being all that could be found
after his death. This may also be urged
to those who blasted his Reputation
with the report, that he must once have
robb'd a <HI>Holland</HI> Mail of a considera∣ble
quantity of rough Diamonds; tho'
another Person suffer'd for it, and deny'd
the Fact to the last. Others would have
it, that the <HI>Jews</HI> kept him, (I don't find
they can tell for what) it being very un∣likely
that a sett of Men should agree to
maintain the Riots of an useless Person;
neither did he frequent their Conversa∣tion
in publick. And, as we have before
observ'd, the grand Objection continues
still in force, in that Mr. <HI>W</HI>—was
never wanting, nor had he any particular
known Confident; or if he had, they
have been rigorously just, not only to him,
but to his Memory. Thus is this great
Secret like to continue such; for neither
Time nor Chance, which are reported for
the certain Discoverers of all Things,
have yet reveal'd it to us, unless by the
following Relation you will allow the
<PB N="526" REF="388"/>
Riddle to be at length expounded, which
you must do me the favour to imagine
you hear a malicious Person making to
me. I do not promise to give it you ei∣ther
in or all her Words, yet in her Cir∣cumstances
and in the gross 'tis thus.</P>
<P><HI>Forcing the Tears, (to make her Trea∣chery
tolerated</HI>) Ungrateful Lady! <HI>cry'd
she, her Handkerchief at her Eyes:</HI> But
'tis the Temper of the Great, they hate
whom they have trusted, and those by whom
they have been much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>liged; nay sooner
would they forgive and serve a mortal
Enemy, being in nothing more perfect than
Ingratitude. Once I was belov'd, trusted
and favour'd, or I had not been a manager
of guilty Secrets. All the time of the late
King's Life I was indeed consider'd, but
'tis past, and I am forgotten; but trans∣ported
with my Resentments, I delay to
shew you, that if I had been base, 'twas
more than once in my power to ruin her,
this ungrateful Lady! this Person accom∣plish'd
in Ingratitude!</P>
<P>After her Attendance was over in the
King's Closet, she took me one Evening
to walk with her in the Gardens at—
The Season was hot, and the Air refresh∣ing.
In one of the most retired Walks,
we found there lying upon the Ground,
a Person whom we after knew to be one
Mr. <HI>W</HI>—, a Cadet of a Gentleman's
Family, but in his Circumstances unfor∣tunate;
his Posture was melancholy, his
Looks dejected, and so buried in Thought,
<PB N="527" REF="389"/>
that he rais'd not his Eyes to us, tho'
my Lady (who is now) made a full
stop, and staid some Moments to consider
him. She saw something either in his Air
or Face, or both, that irresistably charm'd
her: Tho' perhaps he ought not to be
reckon'd amongst those Beauties that
strike all those who look on 'em with
love and wonder, yet he might very well
be said to be a pretty Man: However,
with Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> we may say;
<Q><L>The Cause of Love can never be assign'd;</L>
<L>'Tis in no Face, but in the Lover's Mind.</L></Q>
Whether her amorous Star had then the
Ascendant, that she could not resist her
Fate, or willing herself to give in to the
Pleasures of Love in an Amour of Secre∣cy,
or any other cause, but we pass'd and
repass'd him several times (tying close our
Hoods, and pulling 'em as much as could be
to hide our Faces) without raising his Person
or Curiosity; therefore leaving me at the
Garden Gate, with Instructions, she took
Coach for <HI>London,</HI> and bid me try to dis∣cover
who he was. I went and seated
myself so near, that he could no longer
avoid turning his Looks towards me;
whereupon he arose, and saluting me with
a Bow civil enough, walk'd away. I
got up and follow'd him, Keeping so close
that he could not but fancy I had a de∣sire
to speak with him: But that seem'd
none of his Concern. He was going as
<PB N="528" REF="390"/>
fast as he could to that Door which opens
into <HI>Hide Park,</HI> when I call'd, <HI>Stay, Sir,
have you no Curiosity to hear what can be
said to you? None at all, Madam,</HI> he
answer'd, <HI>unless the Goddess of Fortune
should call upon me to offer some of those
Favours I very much stand in need of.
Perhaps I am she,</HI> reply'd I, <HI>for 'tis known
that blind Deity bestows her Blessings at
random, and therefore not always to the
most deserving. You saw the Lady who not
long since parted with me; no Goddess
could have sent you so invaluable a Present
as is her Heart. The News perhaps</HI> (an∣swer'd
my careless Gentleman) <HI>would not
be unpleasing to those who have any incli∣nation
to Toys, but I stand in need of more
substantial Favours; my broken Fortunes
are not fit for Ladies; this Night I mean
to pass in the neighbouring Park, to de∣termin
with myself what to do: Death is
my Refuge, the manner of it is only the
debate: Tho' when the thing is once re∣solv'd
on, a Moment or two more of Pain
being the only difference, ought not to keep
us long in suspence; therefore, Madam,
you cannot but find me the most improper
Person alive for yours or any other fair
Lady's Occasions.</HI> To conclude, upon my
pressing and encouraging him, he told me,
he had been broke in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and was
undone, not only in his Fortunes, but
Reputation, which had been blasted by
Malice and Mistake; and that being de∣ny'd
Revenge upon his too powerful
<PB N="529" REF="391"/>
Enemies, he was determin'd to turn it
upon himself. I said all I could to dis∣suade
him from Despair; told him his
better Angel had lately, in the Form of
my Friend, appear'd to him; that if he
would live but till to Morrow Night, I
would engage to ease him of part of his
Misfortunes. My Spark was no other∣wise
out of conceit with Life, but be∣cause
he had not the means of living in
it with Pleasures, or rather Conveniency,
so moderate was he before the affluence
of Fortune. I thought it improper to
leave him, lest by means of any of the
Gardners he might discover us: So that
I told him, if he would but walk to the
Gravel-Walk in the <HI>Park,</HI> I would come
round and take him up in a Hackney-Coach,
and carry him to <HI>London.</HI> That
there might be no return for him that
way, I took care to shut the Garden Door
after him. When I had got a Coach, I
went to look for my Soldier: I found
him at his Post upon Duty. I took him
up, and bad him have courage, for For∣tune
had done more for him than he cou'd
have had the presumption to desire. He
put on a more pleasing Air, and entertain∣ing
me (till we came to <HI>London</HI>) with
Rallery upon our Adventure, press'd me
close to discover to him who we were.
I told him, 'twas <HI>Fairy</HI> Land, which when
ever reveal'd, would fly before him; but
charg'd him to attend the next Night at
Twelve (if it did not Rain, as there was
<PB N="530" REF="392"/>
then little probability of any) at the Rail
that goes into St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> at the end
of the Walk by Madam <HI>Mazarines</HI> Lodgings.
He fail'd not his Assignation, nor we to
meet me. The custom of the place per∣mitting
Masks, the Moon shone bright,
and the Centuries were civil. My Lady
was so charm'd with her Lover, that till
two of the Clock she did not think of re∣tiring.
She had no interruption in her
Amour, but discours'd him so much to
her Satisfaction, that at parting she put
into his hands a Bill for Five hundred
Pounds upon Sir <HI>F</HI>—<HI>C</HI>—; then
ordring him to stay with me for a quar∣ter
of an Hour, she struck, unseen by him,
into Madam <HI>Mazarine</HI>'s, where her Chair
and People waited. The greatness of the
Present amaz'd him, he could scarce be∣lieve
his own Eyes, nor that Moon which
lent him Light to read his good Fortune.
But I must do him the justice to say, that
he bore it handsomly. <HI>You are, indeed,
Madam,</HI> said he, <HI>the Goddess you spoke
of, and 'tis but just that at your Shrine I
offer part of what, by your means, I have
receiv'd.</HI> I told him, that the Lady who
had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow'd that upon him, took care to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et Persons that serv'd her stand in no
need of dividing her Favours. We took
Coach at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Gate, and I set him
home at his own Lodgings near <HI>Hippo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o's,</HI>
for fear he should return and ask
what Ladies were at Madam <HI>Mazarine</HI>'s;
tho' ours was got home before me, but
<PB N="531" REF="393"/>
so transported, and so in love, that I was
surpriz'd who found no such Inclinations
in myself of admiration for the Person
that had charm'd her. How often did
she embrace and kiss me? I believe in
Imagination that 'twas Mr. <HI>W</HI>—. She
begg'd my Conduct and Secrecy in the
management of an Affair upon which her
Pleasure and her Interest (two considera∣ble
Points) depended. She said, she was
resolv'd to shew what a Fortune it was
to be her Favourite; that she intended to
abundantly exceed the Hopes I had given
him, and would be the very Goddess of
Bounty to him. He had Principles and
Vertue, with a Soul deserving the noblest
Favours; that could he be but secret,
(which she would not doubt) her Pride
should be, to raise his Fortunes equal to
his Merit. When I waited on her in the
Morning, her Thoughts were rather more
inflamed. She arose to her strong Box,
and gave me a Bag of a thousand Guineas,
with an Order upon the same Banker for
Five hundred more. So that laden with
Riches and Instructions, I took a Chair to
the Piazza. Discharging it there, I walk'd
to a Coach, which carry'd me to Mr.
<HI>W</HI>—'s Lodgings, who was not yet stir∣ring.
After a little waiting, I was intro∣duc'd
to his Bed side. 'Twas then that I
could not chuse but make some Reflexions
upon the Visicitudes of human Affairs.
The Chamber was two Fair of Stairs,
dark and dirty, the Furniture old and
<PB N="532" REF="394"/>
poor: <HI>Rise, Sir,</HI> said I to him, <HI>and meet
your good Genius; I am sent as the God of
Riches was to</HI> Timon; <HI>ther's Fifteen hun∣dred
Guineas thrown upon the Bed for your
Morning's welcom: 'Tis your Lady's Plea∣sure
that you should immediately put your∣self
in a Condition fitting the Favourite of,
Love and hers. Take the handsomest
Lodgings (till a House can be furnish'd)
that the Town affords; form your Equipage
according to the nicest, richest Fancy; be
every thing that's Great and Noble. To
those that have Money all things may be
perform'd with expedition. She is impa∣tient
till your Fortune shines equal to the
opinion that is had of your Merit. Rest
assured that hers are no transitory Favours;
they are not for a day, but for ever. All
you have to perform, on your part, is to
reserve yourself entirely for her, and ne∣ver,
by an indiscreet Curiosity, endeavour
to discover her; perhaps Time and Expe∣rience
may bring her to trust the mighty
Secret with you; till then, if you enquire,
and succeed in that Enquiry, you must not
only lose her, but your life also. Beware,
lest like the</HI> Psyche <HI>in</HI> Apuleius, <HI>you seek
not to behold the dangerous Cupid. These
Lines are recommended for your Motto,
from Sir</HI> William Davenant:
<Q><L>Ask not Bodies (doom'd to die)</L>
<L>to what Abode they go,</L>
<L>Knowledge is but Sorrow's Spy,</L>
<L>It is not safe to know.</L></Q>
<PB N="533" REF="395"/>
Amuse the World, and let 'em in vain in∣quire
whence you derive this Fortune. It
is not to be told; for in telling, the Prin∣ciples
are destroy'd, and you remove far
from you, Her, the Foundation upon which
you stand. 'Twill also be her Ruin, and
the height of Baseness in you, to level that
by which you were rais'd. This and more
you Indiscretion (if you are guilty of any)
will bring to pass. But because we with
difficulty believe Ill of those we resolve to
favour, she has not half my apprehensions
of your Indiscretion, and therefore orders
you to come this Night at Twelve of the
Clock to the Two—Posts in the <HI>Pall-Mall.</HI>
Ask no Questions, nor will you need, for I
shall take care to be there to introduce you.
But because Instructions may be then im∣proper,
take 'em now: You will find my
Lady in Bed, there shall be but one Light
in the Chamber, but do not (by it) endea∣vour
to see her Face; be satisfied that she's
young, and by some thought the handsomest.
Make use of your good Fortune. I suppose
Sleep will not be your business. When the
Clock strikes two, rise and be gon, a Chair
shall wait to carry you home. Thus may
you be bless'd both with Riches and Beauty.
And for the continuation of both, that en∣tirely
depends on yourself; whilst you please
you shall be the only Favourite. These
Experiments are too dangerous and ex∣pensive
for repetition, neither will she be
able, without difficulty, to steal those happy
Hours allotted you. I suppose when you
<PB N="534" REF="396"/>
are together, you will take measures for
future Favours. Farewel, and remember
to be, if possible, (what is difficult in this
turn of Fortune) Discreet.</P>
<P>Thus, for a long time, did our happy
Lovers taste uninterruptedly the Sweets of
Love. Mr. <HI>W</HI>—took a House and
furnish'd it splendidly, appearing to all
Eyes the wonder of his Time: My La∣dy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
Opportunities were few, which the
be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er help'd to conceal the Mystery; her
Hours always late, so that Mr. <HI>W</HI>—having
the Keys brought every Night into his
own Chamber, without acquainting any
of his Servants, he would rise and dress
himself, and go in or out unknown to any
of 'em, a Chair, by my directions, al∣ways
waiting to carry him. Thus (when
the World would wonder that he never
absented himself from publick Views) has
this great Secret pass'd. His Expences
were so vast, that, as the Town▪ said,
none but a Queen could support, with∣out
ruining herself; which confounded all
Penetration, and well deserves to be set
down as a principal Article in the account
of secret Service, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>One Night returning with me from the
Rendezvous, my Lady—told me,
she was undone, for that Fool <HI>W</HI>—
would be knowing. She had in vain
warn'd him against himself and that de∣stroying
Devil, <HI>Curiosity;</HI> he seem'd re∣solv'd,
and had gone so far as to tell her,
that if it cost whatever was dearest to
<PB N="535" REF="397"/>
him, he could not be easie till she had
given him that last proof of her Love.
Ah, my Dear, crys she, what Things
these Men are? Whilst we yet have any
Reserve, we still are importun'd; 'tis a
supply to Conversation, which without a
Theam languishes: Love, however Om∣nipotent
he be counted, abates much of
his Divinity when he comes to full En∣joyment.
I must either see this Creature
no more, or resolve to disclose myself. I
cannot wisely do the latter; for <HI>W</HI>—
seems to be too weak a Vessel to trust my
Secret to; the Fumes of his good For∣tune
has turn'd his Brain. Is he not sa∣tisfied
that I love him more than I ought,
without I love him as much as I can?
Ah, this might have succeeded when Love
was young, and Desire stronger; whilst
my Passion had yet the gloss of Novelty;
but I see him now with the Eyes of Cu∣stom;
I have taken leisure to view him
with Consideration; he is undone by it;
for his Defects balances his Possessions
and he, at least, wants as many Vertues
as he enjoys. Nothing can be more dis∣agreeable
than Importunity: I am tir'd
by it; my softer Moments are fatigu'd
with it. What opinion can a Person have
of our Understanding, when we yield that
to impertinent Solicitations, which we
have refus'd to Reason? Were I but se∣cure
that he would never come to the
knowledge of who I am, I could be well
contented to let the Affair end here; and
<PB N="536" REF="398"/>
would take care (for the Dignity of my
former Passion) to see him so well pro∣vided
for, that he might end his Days
with Splendor. More just in this than
Fortune, (that fickle Goddess) who makes
her Sport out of the Ruins of her Favou∣rites,
and rejoices as much at the Cala∣mity
of those she abandons, as ever she
did at the Prosperity of whom she raises.
That I have not hitherto thought fit to
bestow supernumerary Sums of Money
for him to purchase any great Estate with,
was because he should have a more im∣mediate
Dependance upon my Bounty:
Neither did I refrain his natural Inclina∣tions
to Expence, because that manner of
living more refin'd his Conversation, and
brought him so much nearer to my Taste.
But now that the matter is otherwise,
you shall meet him the next time in my
place, and give him what Advice I think
necessary for both our sakes.</P>
<P><HI>I went accordingly, he took me for his
Lady, tho' instead of being in Bed, I sat
within the Curtains upon the Bed side;
after some little silence,</HI> Madam, (<HI>said he</HI>)
Are you come with more favourable Inclina∣tions
to your Slave? or are you resolv'd to
persevere in your cruel denial? Better by
much to refuse all, than grant by halves.
How can I whisper to my Heart that I'm be∣lov'd,
when treated with such Reserve? Is
not the sight of the Person enjoy'd, half the
Pleasure? When I have you in my Arms,
know I what Ideas to fill my Mind with?
'Tis true your Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Conversation have
<PB N="537" REF="399"/>
a thousand Charms, but where the lovely
Face is wanting, Enjoyment must be Im∣perfect.
Where is that noble Confidence
which ought to snatch hence these forbid∣ing
Reserves to the Person loving and be∣ing
beloved? My Happiness is so imper∣fect,
than I know not how, properly, it can
be call'd such; if I am to be undone by the
Sin of Knowledge, 'twas the loss of <HI>Para∣dise,</HI>
and must be mine. Whether push'd on
by my evil Genius, or some more irresistable
unaccountable Power, I am resolv'd this
Night shall end my Pain; (if you do not
think fit yourself to oblige me with the disco∣very)
thus (clasping your lovely Body in my
Arms) will I expect the Morning, Day will
confess the Charmer; but if your Face hap∣pen
to be unknown to me (as 'tis scarce
possible, since the late opportunities I have
had of seeing those few Persons who have
it in their Power to do as you have done)
I'll follow you this moment, like your Shadow,
till I explore that Secret you have so long,
so disobligingly, and so religiously kept;
and to which you can have no other Motive,
but vile distrust of my Honour, or have
too great an opinion of my Vanity. Pray
guess how obliging this must be to a Lover,
who would die to serve, but never can de∣ceive
you. Ungrateful! <HI>interrupted I,
discovering myself,</HI> Fool and Traitor both
to thy own Fortune, and those Conditions
thou at first mad'st with me, and wert
sworn to observe: Came not this Lady to
thee, like thy better Fortune, with flowing
<PB N="538" REF="400"/>
Love and lavish Bounty, at the last of all
thy Hours, when every Star had abandon'd
thee, and thy Despair was precipitating
thee into eternal Ruin? Hast thou not,
by her waste of Passion, her prodigality
of Love, shane like a blazing <HI>Meteo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the
wonder and the envy of the most Happy?
Woud'st thou with Baseness require Favours
so invaluable? not naming the possession of
her own lovely Person, a Glory Kings
wou'd pride themselves in—Go—, she
shall never see thee more, from this mo∣ment
thy better Fortune turns her Face
from thee, her own <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Star had not
forsaken her, she had Warnings or Pros<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
of thy Villanies, and will no longer trust
herself with one so ungrateful; ev'n now
she ravishes from thee, the continuation of
those Blessings she had bestow'd; dispised
and poor, gather up the Shipwrecks of thy
ruin'd Fortune, depart a Country where
thou hast only blazed, and if thou art wise,
will vanish from—Never Madam,
(<HI>interrupted he briskly</HI>) so long as our hap∣py
Monarch Reigns, and my Goddess pos∣sesses
his Favour. See, Madam, if I had
any occasion to be obliged to her, or you,
for the knowledge of—'Tis some time
since I had the good Luck to discover her;
but I'm persuaded, had I ever been where
she was, Instinct must have done it. Our
Coaches once met in <HI>Hide Park,</HI> she was
then speaking as we pass'd, and the Tone
and Mode of her Voice are too particular
to be conce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l'd▪ besides, her Hand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng loved
<PB N="539" REF="401"/>
rested upon the Window, and she had upon
her Finger that large Diamond Ring, which,
for its particular Beauty, she was pleas'd
to accept and wear as my Present; my
Heart confess'd the Charmer, and flew
after her Chariot Wheels. Let her but re∣collect
how long since that happen'd, and
from thence assure herself of my Discreti∣on,
and that she has no occasion to distrust
her most faithful Slave. As for you,
Madam, I remember well, my Life was to
be the price of this important Secret; if
you please, 'tis yours to take, tho' Chance
made the forfeit, I can't well fear such
fair Enemies: I therefore, with my Knees
to the Ground, beg of you to intercede for
(and with) me to my Goddess, that she may
permit me to serve her out of Love, as be∣fore
out of Gratitude. My Ardours have
been much redoubled, since touch'd with
that noble Passion my Transports have
had a more exalted Motive; for to a Heart
like mine, Interest can never act like Love.
You have Power to do all things with her;
make her easy under this Discovery. What
I pretend to from hence, is, but a greater
freedom in the Enjoyment of her my Soul
is fond of, that all constraint may vanish,
I may see her Face, her Air and Shape, her
Motions, and every other Grace, some∣times
Eat with her; (no remote Pleasure
in Love) and in short, make it appear that
I can value and adore her as I ought. Can
I be properly said to have a Passion for her
whilst she was unknown? 'Tis only then
<PB N="540" REF="402"/>
since she was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to we, that mine
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be call'd such, from thence it begins
its Aet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and shall continue to the end of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Life. If (as all agree) the noblest
Pleasure be in Pleasing, my Princess must
have wanted that Pleasure, since I could
not, with good Sense, pretend to love wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I
did not know; she might, for what I could
tell, be old, or very ugly. 'Tis true, I
was graceful to my Benefactress no more—
But there are other Transports due to Love,
not to be imitated, and impossible to be con∣ceal'd.
Will she not have reason to be better
satisfy'd with me, when my Heart, fill'd
with her fair Image, has involuentary Fond∣ness?
when all my Transports are excited
by her Beauty, and that I consider nothing
in the possession of her, but her own Charms?
<HI>Here he left speaking, and me in an ir∣recoverable
Amazement. I rose and ask'd
his leave to retire, for what had newly
happen'd was so unforseen, that I had
no Commission to treat upon it, but the
next Night, if he pleas'd, (to be in the
same place) I might wait upon him with
such Commands as might decide his De∣stiny.</HI></P>
<P>Nor you, nor any living Soul can guess
the Lady's Grief and Rage; she wept,
she sobb'd, she travers'd the Lodging,
Disdain and Fury fill'd her Eyes and Mo∣rions;
she accus'd her own Indiscretion,
or, to call it better, Folly. When the
height of her Indignation was abared;
See (says she) the just Reward of ingrate∣ful,
<PB N="541" REF="403"/>
new and sudden Passions; I am going
to pay dearly for mine. Oh Duty! how
powerfully dost thou revenge thyself for
our neglect of thee? <HI>W</HI>—shall never
see me more, that Vain glorious Fool,
who, even to myself, cou'd not forbear
boasting of his good Fortune. Will he be
more discreet to others? No, 'tis impos∣sible,
the Wretch must die, that's certain;
but the manner, ay, there's the difficul∣ty.
Oh! <HI>Italy! Italy!</HI> thy Poisons or thy
<HI>Banditty,</HI> my whole Estate for Revenge.
What do I say, for Revenge? for Secu∣rity:
I can never be safe whilst such a
dangerous Secret is lodg'd in so loose a
Breast. What shall I do? Dissimulation
does but increase my Torment; but till I
find an opportunity to securely punish, it
must be so—Go to him, and tell him,
he may thank himself for seeing me no
more. I had set it down for a Rule,
never after this discovery to converse
with him, whenever he should prefer
Vanity to me; but if he betrays me, he
shall die, like <HI>Alexander.</HI> I mean with my
own Hands to taste the Sweets of Mur∣der
and Revenge. Were I to meet with
him in the King's Closet, on such an
Extand, it should be thus. But if his
Discovery be made to others, I have
Money, and Rage has Industry, to find
out needy Villains to dispatch the Tray∣tor.
But if he prove a Man of Honour,
and conceal me, he shall still live and
flourish, tho' I no more converse with
<PB N="542" REF="404"/>
him; if in publick Places he should meet
me, (tho' if he be wise he will avoid
'em) bid him beware, lest he cast a glance
of acquainted Love; I forbid a Smile, a
Bow, the least shadow of what has been;
nay, if the Secret be blown abroad, or but
whisper'd, he dies for it, since it can only
come from him (thee I am well assured
on). Is not the whole Nation upon En∣quiry
whence he derives his Fortune?
Should they but think he knew me,
'twere all unravel'd; for who but the
Queen and me could support a Favourite
at such a shining height? 'Twill, ay
'twill be too easily believ'd. But if he be
Discreet, and engage himself in no A∣mour,
(not that I value the conquest of
such a ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dry vain glorious Heart, or can
be jealous of what I think fit no longer
to possess) but the Creature on whom he
bestows it may exact my Secret) my
Bounty shall know no other Period but
his Life; care shall be taken to supply
him successively with Bills of <HI>Exchange,</HI>
If he be wise, he'll go out of <HI>England,</HI> or
retire into the Country; not that I
exact either from him, but as to the rest,
his choice won't sure be difficult to make
between Poverty and Wealth, Death and
Life.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W</HI>—was forc'd (when he saw
he cou'd get no better) to agree to these
Conditions. My Lady, tho' she constant∣ly
supply'd him, as before, yet wou'd
never again by any means be brought to
<PB N="543" REF="405"/>
see him. What I have hitherto related is
matter of fact, and from the Original;
what follows, is circumstantial only, but
enough to blacken her with the suspicion
of the monstrous cruelest of Actions.
Poor Mr. <HI>W</HI>—, thou surely deserv'st
better Usage; 'twas her pleasure to raise
him, he could not seek it, 'twas the work
of her own Hands, he kept her Secret re∣ligiously,
denying himself any converse
with Ladies, lest he should give her oc∣casion
of complaint against him. His
Vanity indeed still kept him Company;
for whereas a wise Man might easily
have guess'd, that a Fool only cou'd be
content to maintain (for always) such an
unprofitable Expence, he shou'd therefore
have retrench'd his, and have consider'd
of some solid Establishment in the World;
but he still had some weak ray of Hope,
that his Perseverance and Obedience wou'd
allay her Passion of Anger, and restore
him to her Favour again. But alas! 'twas
but ill grounded, for there had pass'd too
much Time, and he might well conclude
she lov'd him not, when she cou'd be
contented to live so long without what
she lov'd. In short, myself thought him
despised and forgotten, his Name being
but rarely mention'd, and that only when
her Bounty was concern'd.</P>
<P>I imagin'd one Night that she had
pick'd up a new Favourite, but where I
cou'd not tell; my Orders were to go to
the short Piazza, and take up a Gentle∣man
<PB N="544" REF="406"/>
I should find walking there, (and who
wou'd come to the Coach) his Gloves
hanging out of his Coat Pocket. This
Spark I was to introduce by the <HI>Park</HI>
Door up the back Stairs into the Dressing
Room. She press'd my Hand, begging
me to retire, and to take care she was
not overheard by any of her own People.
Her faithful Centinel obey'd; and after a
Conference of two Hours, I heard her go
into the Bed-Chamber with him, open
her strong Box, and in a voice louder than
before, (for she seem'd for that moment
to have forgot I was her Neighbour) said
to him, <HI>Take this, and your Work done
depend upon another Thousand, and my
Favour for ever.</HI> Then I was call'd, and
order'd to reconduct him to the place I
took him up at. I wou'd have enter'd
into some Discourse with him in the
Coach, but he was upon the Reserve, and
methought something abrupt in his De∣parture.
This was a Secret which I was
not to be let into. The Wretch was young,
well dress'd, and handsom enough, and it
seem'd to me, that he was going to suc∣ceed
Mr. <HI>W</HI>—in the good Fortune of
my Lady—'<HI>s</HI> Favour; but I began to
change my Mind when I saw him no more,
nor ever heard her mention him. My
guess was, that he had not pleas'd her,
and was only a Mushroom Favourite of a
Night.</P>
<P>Not long after, the News surpriz'd
and reach'd me of poor Mr. <HI>W</HI>—'s be∣ing
<PB N="545" REF="407"/>
kill'd upon the Place appointed by
him to fight a Duel with Mr.—. A
Name I had never known; the Quarrel
an inconsiderable Pretence about Mr. <HI>W.</HI>'s
Sister. I, all innocent of Revenge, ran
to acquaint my Lady—with it. Nor
did I well know what temper her Soul
might be in, and whether 'twere best con∣dole
or congratulate her. She receiv'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he News with an Air so unmov'd, that
I could not make any judgment of her
Thoughts. After some silence, she cry'd
out, <HI>Poor vain glorious</HI> W—! <HI>And
is it true that thou art dead? I have kept
my Word with thee; my Bounty has no
other period but thy Life.</HI> Thus indiffe∣rently
did she take the death of one whom
she with such an eagerness of Passion had
loved, such a magnificence of Favour.
Now did the Town redouble its Curiosi∣ty,
imagining to have it gratify'd by
Mr. <HI>W</HI>—'s Papers; and that the long
hid Secret would be discover'd. But they
were as silent as his Grave, and as I should
ever have been, had I not been used after
so cruel and unpresidented a manner.</P>
<P>When the Gentleman's Tryal came on
who had kill'd Mr. <HI>W</HI>—, my Curio∣sity
carried me to hear it, because I had
been so well acquainted with the deceas'd,
I did not mention my design to my La∣dy
—, or she would, doubtless, have
prevented me. My Surprize was inex∣pressible,
when I saw that the Gentleman
brought to the Bar was the same who I told
<PB N="546" REF="408"/>
you I had once introduc'd <HI>Incongnito</HI> to my
Lady—I almost imagin'd myself a
remote Accessary; and shudring with
dread and guilt, my Knees knock'd to∣gether,
my Nose gush'd out violently
with Blood, or I had sounded upon the
place. His Indirement beginning to be
read, I found myself unable to hear it;
therefore way was made for me, with
much difficulty, and I recover'd (half
dead) the Coach that waited for me.
Whilst they were carrying me home, I
reflected on what a Person I had to deal
with, and saw that if I had any value for
my Life, I must not let her know the disco∣very
I had made; for such a dangerous
Secret to one steep'd in Blood, would not
have been long suffer'd to sleep in my
Breast. Therefore I mention'd nothing of
my Suspicion; nor knows she to this day
that I was at the Tryal, or knew Mr.—was
the same Person that had had a pri∣vate
Audience of her Ladyship. Nothing
could have been manag'd with more ad∣dress;
for I'm still ignorant how she came
acquainted with him, and of the means she
found of procuring a Person so fit for her
business.</P>
<P>'Tis needless to repeat to you how the
Tryal pass'd: Mr. <HI>L</HI>—was condemn'd,
and all Endeavours used to get his Par∣don.
But the King was always inexora∣ble
upon the account of Murder. My
Lady never seem'd to appear in it, and
therefore pitch'd upon a method that as
<PB N="547" REF="409"/>
well serv'd her ends. Doubtless, her Re∣morse
would not have been great should
the Criminal have suffer'd, could there
have been any security of his persisting to
the last in secrecy and silence: But the
Gallows is a general and dangerous Con∣fessional;
and had he come to that, what
might he not have discover'd? How ex∣claim'd
against the Ingratitude and Trea∣chery
of those who set him to work? It
is to be imagin'd he had not engag'd him∣self
without an assurance either of Pardon,
or an Equivalent to it. All the World
knows how miraculously he escap'd out
of Prison. I say, miraculously! For no∣thing
but the force of Gold could have
prevail'd over his inflexible Irons. His
arrival in the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> and continu'd
Expences, his appearance like a Man of
Quality and Estate, tho' 'twas known that
he had not the value of a Groat to his
own, and lived, before that fatal Duel,
upon the Favours his good Fortune pro∣cur'd
him from the Ladies. I find she can
either keep her Word with him, or he has
been wise enough to secure a Sum suffi∣cient
to arm him against Ingratitude.
With me 'tis not so well; Affairs have
chang'd faces; the King is dead, she no
longer fears him; and concerning not her
self for the discretional part, leaves me
at liberty to say what I please, after the
thousand Protestations she has a thousand
times made me, she would never else dare
to abandon me as she has done.</P>
<P><PB N="548" REF="410"/>
Thus, Madam, in as succinct a manner
as the Story would permit, have I told your
Ladyship what the good old Gentlewoman
was three Hours in relating. I subscribe
implicitly to your Opinion as to the truth
of it, and desire in the next that you will
favour me with the knowledge of it.
'Tis certain Mr. <HI>W</HI>—'s Supply was

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>AT length, my dear Sister, (all tran∣sported
with a fond Bridegroom's
Joy) I may with assurance tell you, that
I'm upon the point of being entirely blest;
my charming Mistress has this Night
consented, her Father has consented, to
my unutterable Happiness; to Morrow
makes me Master of my Desites; the
Thought hurries me beyond myself: I
could see my very Enemies with Joy;
therefore to expect any thing but Rap∣ture,
to expect plain Sense from me at
this time, is thinking below the Dignity
of my Passion: Nor wants it any height∣ning,
by looking back upon the dreadful
<PB N="549" REF="411"/>
Precipice I've past, the Difficulties I have
struggl'd with, the almost Impossibilities
that I have vanquish'd, the Rack of Mind,
the Obstacles of a rich and powerful Ri∣val,
and consequently the Reserve of Pa∣rents.
Love alone was for me; my
charming Mistress was all kind and con∣stand;
she help'd me to support my ar∣dent
Longings; for what can be more
exquisite than delay'd Enjoyment? when
two Hearts, mutually burning, mutually
languishing for what Love and Nature
boldly dictates, finds so many Bars to
cross their Happiness?</P>
<P>Do not you (my dear Sister) join with
the sordid World, in blaming me for pre∣ferring
Merit to Riches; I look'd beyond
it for my Happiness. The Hinge of In∣rerest,
upon which at present the whole
Nation turns in their Marriages, makes
so many of 'em unfortunate. 'Tis true,
I could have had a Wife with an ample
Fortune; but perhaps to me scanty in
Charms, in that Harmony of Minds from
which only Happiness arises. She whom
I shall present you for a Sister, has a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en∣derness
for me beyond all other value.
To please her, you must begin by me;
should I frown, or be out of temper, her
whole Frame would be in disorder: Then
she has a Voice and Words that can cure
Despair, can charm displeasing Melan∣choly.
Oh! 'tis impossible to hear her
Speak, and know a Pain. How true,
how noble is her Soul! How eminent her
<PB N="550" REF="412"/>
Wit! Her Sense, how solid! How soft,
how sweet her Love! I figure myself
returning home fatigu'd with Business,
where I meet, with open Arms, this dear,
this faithful Wife, who knows how to
charm my Cates, how to time her Kind∣ness,
and even to wait for mine, and
without Impatience to stay till those Sal∣lies
of ill temper be blown over which
Disappointment have perhaps occasion'd.
No Hours can e'er be tedious in her Com∣pany.
This I speak not like a Lover,
the whole World, that know her, will
eccho this eternal Truth. When you've
search'd the round of Conversation abroad,
to be justly pleased you must return to
her; for in this point all agree is united
whatever can be pleasing or instructive.
None ever yet went from her pall'd or
undelighted: I speak of those who have
Sense to make a true Judgment of Things,
and dwell longer on her Mind, into which
I have conducted you, that you may know
and value it. 'Tis upon that my solid
Happiness is fix'd, that unalterable Beau∣ty,
which is known to flourish in its high∣est
perfection, at an Age when but the
memory remains, or scarce that, of out∣ward
Charms. I prepare you then, my
dear Sister, to be ravish'd with the Beau∣ty
of hers, and believe so well of your
Brother's Understanding, that he knows
how to choose for Happiness. Cards,
publick Conversation, Musick, the Play-House,
Visits, and the business of Visits▪
<PB N="551" REF="413"/>
Detraction and Ill-nature, are none of her
Diversions; I shall be sure to find her al∣ways
emply'd, always at home, careful
of her Family, entertaining me when pre∣sent
either with reading, or her own more
pleasing Conversation, or wishing for me
when absent. Her Temper is like her
Nature, perfectly good, free from vain
Expences, my Interest her only pursuit,
and all her Desires regulated by that;
nay she so perfectly loves me, that I may
answer for her Soul, she would choose
common Conveniencies with me, rather
than Place, Distinction, Title and Obser∣vance
with another. Is there on Earth a
Type of our hereafter Happiness or Mi∣sery?
'tis surely in the married State.
What must he expect, that chooses only
for Interest, a Woman haughty of the Ad∣vantages
she brought you, seeking to be
pleased rather than please? And where
you take no other Consideration along
with you, 'tis impossible to make one's
Duty one's delight. Must I submit my
Hours to the uneasie jangling of an imper∣tinent,
proud, senseless Woman, full of
Noise and Vanity? Must I clasp her to
my Bosom, and pay the Rights of Love
with or without Inclination, or run the
hazard of blowing up her weak suspicious
Mind with jealousie that her Duties are
bestow'd upon another? Must I, when I
want one Companion, take a Legion?
For so many will be her Gossips; Tea
Tables and Chat, Detraction and Folly,
<PB N="552" REF="414"/>
which if but with a piece of Face I should
seem to dislike, 'twere running the Gant∣let
thro' all the round of Tongues where
she visits, and of whom she is visited; to
set the whole Herd upon me, and at me.
With such a Wife a sensible Man will be
sure not to dispute; his best way will be
to suffer in silence; and as a proof of his
Wisdom, admit her Impertinence to go∣vern.
Then, if you strike at Forms, or
pretend to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rench any of those vain Ex∣pences,
of which she finds sufficient Presi∣dents
amongst her she Friends, as to Dress,
Entertainment, stately Child-birth, and
her whole Artillery of Follies, 'twill
make her hate and wish you dead; for
the first thing such a Woman thinks of
after she's married, is how to become a
Widow. Oh, 'twere endless to reckon
you up all the Inconveniencies arising
from Marriage made only upon the score
of Interest. And wha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are their Advan∣tages?
what Enjoyments have you of 'em?
Do you eat, or drink, or sleep more for
being Richer? Are you not as happy with
plain clean Cloaths, as if you were every
night dress'd for the Drawing-Room? Ay,
but some fancy a pleasure in hoarding
Money. To a Man so weak, Reason will
be lost, and therefore I shall not pretend
to argue with him. And as to our care of
Posterity, I have seen hundreds more con∣siderable,
with just enough to teach 'em
how to live, than others whose Fathers
have left 'em great Estates. Human Na∣ture
<PB N="553" REF="415"/>
loves Action; and, generally speak∣ing,
those who have not Business to em∣ploy
themselves with, throw away their
Time in Folly. To those whose Natures
are idle and extravagant, Abundance does
but heighten their Misfortune, and make
'em the more eminently Vicious. But
how have I wander'd whence I first set
out? But 'tis, my dear Sister, with design
to make you approve my Choice; tho'
'twere but showing you my Wife, to make
you entirely of my opinion; the sight of
her would have saved me this labour, her
Conversation have charm'd even you (all
lovely as you are) to an envy of my Hap∣piness,
next to enjoying her myself. I'm
impatient to present her to your Arms. I
please myself with thinking what a har∣mony
of Mind will arise between you;
for in giving you her Character, she has
but sat for yours; and were you not my
Sister, next my Mistress, I could of all
Womankind be only charm'd with you:
Shew me in Nature two so fit for Esteem,
so fit for Happiness. That Word recals
to Morrow to me: I conjure you, Sister,
by our Friendship, in your Imagination,
to time my Joys, when all transported I

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>TO condole with your Ladyship for
the loss of so good a Husband as
Sir—, is the common business of e∣very
Visiter, renewing the Memory of
Grief whilst applying to your Passions:
My endeavours, in speaking to your Rea∣son,
shall be to suspend 'em; 'tis that I
wou'd pretend to make my Advocate
when I address to a Lady of your Excel∣lence,
or when I wou'd discharge the
Duty incumbent on a Friend; and 'tis
Reason must inform you (if you give your
self liberty to consult it) that Self-love is
a Weakness unworthy of you. Now when
you mourn thus immoderately, it can be
only for the Good you imagin'd to have
lost; it is for your own sake, not for the
deceas'd; for if in Heaven be <HI>Fullness of
Joy,</HI> as by our Religion we are instructed
to believe, how absurd is it to grieve for
the early Happiness of our Friends? when
by their good Lives here, and departure
hence, they are qualify'd for Bliss before
us. Holy <HI>Joh</HI>'s Wish envies the Portion
of those Infants who die, from their
Mothers Womb, upon the Knees of such
who receive 'em. Length of Days is but
length of Misery; at least, a suspension
of Joy; for since in the Son of God we
have a sure and certain hope of a better
<PB N="555" REF="417"/>
Life, can he be other than my Enemy,
who envies, denies or defers me from
the immediate enjoyment of that pro∣mis'd
Happiness? Who wou'd not boldly
plunge through a short uneasie Passage,
when on the other side he is sure to find
the end of all his Wants, his Anxieties,
his Pains, his tormenting Desires; and,
which is more than all, his end of Sinning?
Wou'd he, think you, on any terms, tho'
but for a Day, return from those Joys,
tho' he was sure to feel as much Pleasure
as he did Pain in his departure? It is not
the least of Sir—'s good Fortune, that
he dy'd unknowing the inseparable dis∣gusts
or disquiets of Old Age, whose very
Imaginations are frozen under the Snow
of sixty Winters. Tho' perhaps this may
seem to you a cause (however mistaken)
for your greater Grief, when, looking
through the wrong end of the Glass, you
fancy him (by untimely Death) deprived
of many Enjoyments. And were I not on
so serious a subject, I wou'd say you
were in the right; so far at least, as his
Happiness concern'd the possession of so
great a Good as your Ladyship. But
(that excepted) there can be no other com∣parison
than between finite and infinite;
hence it is that upon no terms can you
be suppos'd to mourn for him. 'Tis your∣self
then that you lament; and how un∣worthy
is that Lamentation, to a Soul so
reasonable, so capable of Philosophy,
nay Religion? The latter you entirely of∣fend
<PB N="556" REF="418"/>
by repining, nay exclaiming against
the Almighty pleasure of our great Crea∣tour,
who in his Mercy has been pleas'd
to call one of his Creatures earlier than
Man's appointed Time, from temporary
Pains and Sin, to the incapacity of Sin,
and the possession of eternal Pleasures;
against Philosophy and Reason, when you
vainly torment yourself for what is in it∣self
irrecoverable, placing Good and Evil
in things outward, viciating the taste of
those things you do or may possess, by
an unjust Sorrow for that which you have
no longer a title or hopes of possessing.</P>
<P>Thus, Madam, I wou'd pretend to re∣move
your Grief, by shewing you, that you
have no true occasion of it: For if, as I
have told you, it be Self love, and that
that is a Weakness unworthy of you, I
must farther shew, that that very Self-love
ought to rise in Arms against the
continuation of your Sorrow, since it not
only destroys your Quiet, but Youth and
Beauty fly before it, and possibly may
never return. For, how have the fairest
Faces lost (by Grief and languishing Me∣lancholy)
the Lillies and the Carnation
that made 'em lovely? A pallid hue suc∣ceeds
that Bloom irresistable, incestant
scalding Tears can furrow the smoothest
Cheeks, continual Sighs blow the preg∣nant
Cherry from the envitingest Lips;
and when we wou'd speak of Reason, Elo∣quence,
Wit, or any other branch of
pleasing Conversation; 'tis so profess'd an
<PB N="557" REF="419"/>
Enemy to all in general, that none of 'em
ever pretends to appear where that Tyrant
Grief has once taken up its Residence.</P>
<P>Weigh well then, Madam, how ill a
Bargain you have made; how many Ex∣cellences
you batter for a thing no one in
his Senses wou'd entertain; more than
enough is already paid to Custom, and
the unjust Opinion of the World. Re∣assume
your Courage, consult your Rea∣son,
throw hence your Sorrow, take to
yourself that noble Fortitude which so
well becomes a Genius exalted as your
Ladyship's. Were it to the advantage of
the deceas'd (or that by it we cou'd recal
him to Life and you) myself wou'd club
a Tear with you, be a constant Mourner
at his Tomb, till our mingled Sorrows
had their desir'd Effect. But imagining
that by other Endeavours and Services to
his lovely Relict I shall better express
my late Friendship to your admired Hus∣band,
I reserve all the Powers of my
Soul, and all my Reason, to approve my∣self,
on every Occasion,</P>

little out of late, confin'd by Mr.—'s
Illness, who has kept his Chamber this
Month, where I have (as they say I am in
Duty bound) attended him; so that I
cannot so well give you information. I
miss none of the Ladies near us, but my
Lady—, and my Lady—The

and comes down e're long; the other has
been in Town the time you mention, with
her superanuated L—d, which may per∣haps
be equivalent to a Traveller; they
are expected next Week; but these Cir∣cumstances
are too weak for a demonstra∣tion;
I suppose her Vertue equals her
Charms; don't take my Supposition for
Oracle. I shall have the happiness of
some better Conversation next Week,
and then for Censure and Scandal. With
you I don't fear a discovery. I had been
<PB N="561" REF="423"/>
in Town e're this, but for my Spouse's ill∣ness,
and am forced to abandon the Shades
and Muses, for Hazard and Piquet in a
Chamber. I have no desire of <HI>London</HI>

<P>A nice informing Beau has just learn'd
me, that the prettiest Lady near us, is
Mrs.—, Wife to Sir <HI>T—T</HI>—'s second
Son; she was a C—; and if it be so,
must intrigue with her Relation, for by
Marriage the Colonel is doubly so; his
Sister having marry'd Sir <HI>T—T</HI>—'s
first Son. She is at this present in <HI>London,</HI>
without her Husband, and must be the
fair Lady to whom the Heroe gives such
intolerable Pleasure. Nor can we wonder
at Colonel <HI>B—t</HI>'s amorous Star, when
his Father shot himself for love of a
Grand-Mother. But that's old News to
the World, if not to you. However, we
may recollect the good-nature of the
B—h—ps, those (not infallible) <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Popes. She was his Wife's Sister,
and scrupled to marry him without the
dispensing Power. Mr. <HI>B—t</HI> had writ
against their great <HI>Diana,</HI> and offended 'em
so far, that they wou'd by no means con∣sent
to a Marriage within the Degrees
forbidden. This caus'd him to shoot
himself, unable to live without the En∣joyment
of his Mistress. The dreadful
Deed done, he yet liv'd a Fortnight. The
good natur'd P—l—tes relented, and al∣low'd
<PB N="562" REF="424"/>
a Dispensation, tho' too late for
our dying Lover to profit by it. So that
still 'twas no more than in seeming Cha∣rity.
Now, if it was once a Sin, it was
always a Sin; and by consequence, they
must he in the wrong one way or other,
either in granting, or refusing. I beg you
wou'd burn this Letter, for 'tis of such a
nature, that I should be loath to venture
it in any other but your fair and faithful

nor can I justly complain, should

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Must acquaint your Ladyship with the
Marriage of the young Lady—,
married to that old succesful I over of
Sixty odd, my Lord—, being upon
a religious strain, and desiring Canoniza∣tion
hereafter (if Sufferings can make a
Saint). 'Tis said, that she resolv'd to
marry the two worst Husbands in <HI>England,</HI>
that she might have her Mortifications
and Punishment in this Life.</P>
<P>What has been the young Lady's in∣ducement
to this Marriage (unless Mor∣tification)
is hard to say. My Lord has
long been look'd upon (however formerly
successful) as a Piece out of use amongst
the Ladies. Surely she wanted to be one
Step higher in the Temple of Honour. If
Death does not quickly separate them,
they fear that Accidents may; for I hear
there's a Provision made on my Lady's
side for Jealousie, Ill humour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a
separate Maintenance agreed on, in case
they part within a limited time.</P>
<P>This Marriage reviving Passages of my
Lord's former Life, an airy youngish Wo∣man
(who had had the pleasure to out∣live
her Reputation) told me, in Confi∣dence,
That upon the death of his last
Lady it came into her head to try what
Charm there was in this old Peer, that
<PB N="566" REF="428"/>
still, where he pleas'd, made him success∣ful.
She had a pretty-Strain in writing
of foolish Love Letters, and began a Cor∣respondence
with him. He was so vain
to believe a young Lady was fallen in love
with him; and answer'd her again with
as much Vanity and Fire, as if he had
reckon'd no more than Two and twenty.
They came to an Assignation. Our Heroin
is pretty, genteel and gay, but was so ill
satisfied with her Lover, that she cry'd
out, he was all over Threescore: And
when his Marriage Articles were in treaty,
she sent a Letter to the Lady, to advise
her to insist upon the Privilege of a Gal∣lant,
for to her knowledge she would
stand as much in need of that as of a se∣parate
Maintenance.</P>
<P>I beg your Pardon, Madam, for giving
in to the Airiness of this Creature so far
as to presume to entertain your Ladyship
with it; but if it makes you smile, I have

Addresses of the Men, that I
could not find time to answer yours be∣fore.
I thank you for your Advice. 'Tis
true I would marry, but not yet; 'tis
time enough when I come to be a stale
Maid here, to retire into the Country,
and there take up with some grave Coun∣try
Justice, where I may rule the Family
and the Peace too. I fancy in five or six
Years time I shall grow weary of the
Town, but as yet the Gaieties and Gal∣lantries
of Love are very taking. You
counsel me, Sir, against the danger of
losing my Reputation by these Freedoms;
but, Sir, you are mistaken; for the only
way to lose that, is to be too solicitous
about it. Scandals in the Country are
pieces of innocent Diversions here; and
one may as well pretend to live without
<HI>fine Cloaths,</HI> as without an <HI>Intreague.</HI> I
have half a score upon my hands at this
time, and keep 'em all in suspense; give
one a favourable Look, another a Smile,
a third my Hand to kiss: But then, to
keep them at their due distance, the next
time I see 'em, frown on the first, rail at
the second, wonder at the Sawciness of
the third, if he attempt the same Freedom
again. Oh, Sir, you know not how plea∣sant
<PB N="568" REF="430"/>
a sight 'tis, to see this Beau cring and
screw his Body into an hundred Shapes in
hopes to make himself appear amiable to
me; that Spark sighing, with a languish∣ing
dying Air, in hopes to make me sigh
by Sympathy; that Wit racking his Brains
to write taking <HI>Billet-douces;</HI> but Wits
are the most dangerous Company a Wo∣man
can keep; they are commonly vain-glorious,
and o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g of more than they can
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. That which vexes me most, is,
my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>owance is but small; I have new
Cloaths but twice a Year; so that I am
forced to turn and twine 'em, that I may
not be known by them; fine Cloaths have
wonderful Charms with the Men; and
one had as good be ugly as ill dress'd.
But, Sir, if you please, I will give you a
Catalogue of my Lovers. I have a young
Doctor of Physick that makes honourable
Addresses to me; but I think not that an
equal Match, unless I could poison him
as easily as he can me: I have a young
Counsellor of the <HI>Temple,</HI> furnish'd with
more Law than Sense: A young Merchant,
finer than a <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Beau, and
more demure than my Chamber-Maid;
he courts me, not by <HI>Billet-douces,</HI> but by
Bills of Exchange, and Stock-Jobbing;
but I have no mind to venture myself on
his dangerous Bottom. So much for my
matrimonial Pretenders. I have another
sort, who are for nothing but Love, and
abominate the <HI>Pagun</HI> Confinement of Wed∣lock,
as a Device of Interest in the Priest,
<PB N="569" REF="431"/>
to stifle the free-born Joys of Love: A∣mong
these is a young Lord just arrived
to his Estate and Honour, and wants only
the Qualification of keeping a Mistress
with greater Grandeur than ever he will
his Wife. I receive his Lordship with
the Air of Quality, blush at his Addresses,
and seem pleased at his no Jest; but ne∣ver
give encouragement to so scandalous a
Motion. He's very handsom, dresses and
dances well; I should like his Company
at a Ball, the Box in a Play House, in
the Mall, or <HI>Hide-Park,</HI> if it were not
for fear of being taken for his Miss; but
he's not at all fit for an Intrigue. Next I
have a Beau of <HI>Tom</HI>'s Coffee-House, a
Man of War, he Swears much, Fights
little, and Prays less, is an irreconcilable
Enemy to Sense and Matrimony: I never
admit him but when I am idle, or have
no other Company, for he is a very nau∣seous
Fop. Then I have a finical Courtier,
monstrously in love, who swears if 'twere
not for the Scandal of it, he has Passion
enough to marry me: He's damn'd a thou∣sand
Fathom if there be any of the Maids
of Honour comparable to me. But a∣mongst
the rest, there's an ingenious youn∣ger
Brother to a certain Baronet of our
acquaintance, who dresses neat and free
from Foppery, a genteel and unaffected
Air, a Tongue able to seduce a Vestal Vir∣gin,
tho' sure to die for yielding. This
Man, I confess, Sir, has such an ascen∣dant
over me, that I wish he were not
<PB N="570" REF="432"/>
wild; I fear I have heard him say too
much for my Quiet; but by my own na∣tural
Gaiety, I endeavour to forget these
serious Follies, and by the abundance of
Noise and Fools I'm daily conversant with,
I am now, Sir, perfectly tired with this
Subject, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here only farther add

<P>I have also sent you Dr. <HI>Coward</HI>'s far∣ther
Thoughts upon the human Soul, with
Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI>'s, and Mr. <HI>Broughton</HI>'s Answer
to his <HI>Second Thoughts.</HI> The first appears
to me to have done most justice to the
Argument. The Doctor's Notion seems
to insinuate the entire Mortality, under
pretence of the Soul's fleeping till the
grand Resurrection. 'Tis however cer∣tain,
<PB N="572" REF="434"/>
that this Doctrine is much older than
himself. I have seen a small Treatise,
Printed in the Year 1650, call'd, <HI>Man
wholly Mortal;</HI> from whence he seems to
have transcrib'd his strongest Arguments.
Cou'd we but grant him that Point <HI>of the
Soul's passiveness till the Resurrection,</HI>
'twou'd bid fair for its entire Mortality;
since what can cease to be, tho' but for a
moment, may cease for ever. Our Second
Appearance (allowing the Doctor's No∣tion)
may be more properly call'd a New
Creation, than a Resurrection: Notwith∣standing,
the Body being still subsisting
under several Transmutations, as into
Worms, or a clod of Clay, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Soul be∣ing
an immaterial Spirit, incapable of any
such Change, must fly off and dissolve into
Air, and certainly cease to be, since you
allot it no Repository; and that however
the Body may arise the same, there must
be a new Creation of the Soul, or Spirit,
to animare that Body; unless you'll allow
it can be likewise transmuted and subsist,
tho' under the form of a tuft of Grass, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which is unworthy the dignity of so di∣vine,
so unalterable a Being.</P>

<P>I Used to be pretty lucky in discovering
Secrets, and I have now, Madam,
found one worthy your Ladyship's Curio∣sity.
A young Woman, with whom I di∣verted
myself, did me the favour to go
with me into the Country for a Week,
during the heat of the Season: There
ought to be a cessation of Pleasure, as well
as Business, to make us the more eagerly to
return to our Bent. One Morning I left
my fair Lady in Bed; and rising at Five
of the Clock, took a Book in my Pocket,
and resolv'd to divert myself with walk∣ing
farther than I could have done with
<PB N="585" REF="447"/>
my soft Companion. The Place we were
at, was—, twelve Miles from <HI>Lon∣don.</HI>
I cross'd over the Lanes and Fields,
pleas'd with the irregularity of my Walk,
for my design was only Exercise and the
Air. I found myself, by Seven of the
Clock, wander'd far from the place
whence I set out, and some distance from
any Road, but near a neat little Brick-House
built at the extremity of a Field.
I made up to it, with a design to rest
myself upon a Bench that was placed at
the Garden Gate, which had a Trilo
that gave the Prospect of the Country.
'Twas open, and I found the satisfaction
of viewing a very pretty Place, wonder∣fully
neat, and adorned with Pots and
Greens sufficient to give me an opinion of
the Genius of the Person who was the
Owner. I shut the Gate, because I was
not willing to be seen by any from the
House, who would perhaps have reckon'd
me an Intruder, tho' I exceeded not the
liberty of the Bench: Where resting my∣self,
I was going to continue my Diver∣sion
of Reading; but I had not been there
twenty Minutes, when I say, from the
other end of the Field, a Lady advancing
towards the House. She had on a white
Silver Stuff Night-Gown, hanging loose,
or lap'd about her, lin'd with a full Rose-colour
Sattin; a Wastcoat that, at the
Bosom, shew'd a quantity of fine <HI>Flanders</HI>
Lace, with a Shift and Cuffs of the same;
her Night Linen clean and fine as possible,
<PB N="586" REF="448"/>
ty'd with Cherry and Silver Ribbons, and
over that a fine <HI>Dutch</HI> Straw-Hat, lin'd
with Green, mounted with a Carnation
Feather, and cock'd behind. Upon her
Arm she had a little Basket, which held
a Book, her Netting, and some few O∣range,
Lemon, Jassemin and Myrtle Sprigs,
which she had (as I suppose) gather'd
before she went into the Field. Her Hat
being pull'd over her Eyes to skreen the
Sun, she saw me not: which I took the
advantage of; and before she gain'd the
Bench, I slip'd to the turning of the Gar∣den
Wall, which was not ten Peces from
the place where I had sat, she took the
Seat I had quitted, and, it being shady,
pull'd off that disobliging Hat which had
hinder'd me from seeing the lovely Face.
After sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had rested a little while, she
took the Greens out of the Basket, and
made a Nosegay, which she fix'd in her
Bosom; and then searching to the bottom
of her Basket, pull'd out a Paper which
I quickly perceiv'd (by looking over her
Shoulder) to be a Song set to Notes,
which promis'd me some Musick from my
lovely Charmer: And indeed I was not
deceiv'd, for in an inchanting Strain she
sung <HI>Rosie Bowers.</HI> I was so bewitch'd
with her Air and Voice, that I durst hard∣ly
breath for fear of interrupting her;
tho' I dy'd with impatience to have a full
view of her Face, which as yet I had not
seen; but I trembled lest my appearance
might cause the lovely Vision to vanish.
<PB N="587" REF="449"/>
The Song was of a length sufficient to
give me time to make many Reflexions,
however chain'd my Senses were to the
Musick of her Voice. I saw with won∣der
a Lady of her Air and Dress in so re∣mote
a place; for I could not imagine
(the Garden excepted) that the House
promis'd any thing but bare Conveniences,
and not suitable to the Dress of her who
seem'd to be the shining Mistress of it.
The Song ended, she took out her Net∣ting-work;
at which Diversion she con∣tinu'd
but a small time, when throwing it
back into her Basket, as who should say,
you are not for my purpose at this time,
I heard her sigh more than once, and in
no little romantick Tone, repeat these
Verses from <HI>Oroonoko</HI> (for I remembred to
have read 'em there):
<Q><L>This place, this spot of Earth is more to me</L>
<L>Than the extended Plains of my great Father's King∣dom.</L>
<L>Here we shall reign in Joys, to Power unknown;</L>
<L>Your Love my Empire, and your Heart my Throne.</L></Q>
Then, as if inspir'd by what she had said,
(or the Thought that had occasion'd those
Words) she rose up all of a sudden, and
turn'd so short upon me, that I had not
time to abscond far enough behind my
Wall, she gave a great S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reek at the Sur∣prize
of seeing an unknown Person there,
and shew'd so much danger of Swooning,
that it gave even my Modesty a just Ex∣cuse
to run and catch that lovely Body in
<PB N="588" REF="450"/>
my Arms to prevent its falling upon the
Grass. I may boldly confess to your La∣dyship,
that in that moment I felt more
Delight than I imagin'd was in the power
of the whole Sex to give me. I could
not forbear pressing her slily to my Bosom,
her Body yielding to my touches, being
only guarded with a loose Gown and a
Holland Wastcoat, (just as if risen from
Bed) with one only Petticoat on, that
all the lovely Limbs and Shape were to
be discern'd, and the rest imagin'd. But
long I could not enjoy the envied plea∣sure,
for readuring herself, she gain'd the
Bench, and then in an obliging fashiona∣ble
manner, ask'd my pardon for her Sur∣prize.
But being so little used to Com∣pany,
especially Persons of my Appea∣rance,
and at that early Hour, it might
(if any thing could) be an excuse for the
Disorder she had been in. Then continu∣ing
her Discourse, she ask'd me, with a
charming Address, if I pleas'd to sit and
repose myself, and tell her if I had any
Commands there, or business with Mr.
<HI>King,</HI> which she imagin'd, because that
was no place for chance Passengers, like
me, her little Cottage being directly out
of any Road; and tho' it was her Hus∣band's
misfortune to be then at <HI>London,</HI>
she would faithfully discharge any Com∣mission
to him. Whilst she was thus de∣livering
herself, my whole Soul and Fa∣culties
were charm'd by her; but Wonder
giving place to Memory, methought this
<PB N="589" REF="451"/>
lovely Unknown was no longer so to me:
<HI>Good Heav'n!</HI> (cry'd I out) <HI>is it possible
the charming Mrs.</HI> S—, <HI>who has been
dead to all the World for almost these three
Years, forgetful of her Youth, her Family,
her Charms and Fortune, can bury herself
in a place so unworthy of her!</HI>—More
I could not say, but was forced to run to
the assistance of the afflicted Beauty. She
did now in reality what before she was
only like to do, and fell back on the Arm
of the Bench in a confirm'd Swoon. I
curs'd my indiscreet Discovery, rav'd,
beg'd, intreated her to return to Life,
wept upon her lovely Face, press'd mine
close to her, did all, but in vain, that
was necessary to recal her Senses. At
length, finding it to be no work of
mine, I had recourse to the Garden-Gate,
and knock'd so loud, that that a∣lone
might have recall'd her. At length
a Gardner came to me, whose assistance
I desir'd, to help me convey his Mistress
in, who was there in a fainting Fit; we
brought her between us into the House,
and carrying her into a Room upon the
ground-floor, we laid her upon a Day-bed.
Presently a Gentlewoman and two under
Servants came to her assistance, one with
a Bottle of Harts-horn, and another with
fair Water; we threw some on her Face,
which, with the help of Spirits, recover'd
her; but her Memory did not so immedi∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely
return. At length casting her lovely
black Eyes upon me, they immediately
<PB N="590" REF="452"/>
fill'd with Tears, and in so vast a quanti∣ty,
that they seem'd like Fire in Water,
contending which shou'd have the mastery;
silently upbraiding me for what I had dis∣cover'd.
I must confess, I was so through∣ly
enraged against myself, that had not
her People been about us, I believe I
shou'd have fall'n upon my Sword before
her, to have aton'd that way for my Indis∣cretion.
That Scene of silence cou'd not
but give cause of Reflexion to all that
were present. Grief and Surprize were
painted to the life upon her Face; Re∣morse
and Despair upon mine; Wonder
and Respect upon the Servants, who see∣ing
their Lady pretty well recover'd of
her Illness, left the Room to us, that
knew not how to improve the Opportuni∣ty,
or where to begin the Discourse;
Shame and Confusion had seiz'd us both.
At length I thought it my duty to endea∣vour
the reassuring of her Mind; so that
putting one Knee to the Ground by her
Bedside, <HI>Can you forgive me, Madam, an
innocent and unintended Crime? Fortune
has had a mind to oblige me, by giving me
an opportunity to shew the charming
Mrs.</HI> S—<HI>how true a respect and ad∣miration
I have for her; and how well
I can keep her Secret. What has happen'd
this morning shall pass untold, or like a
Dream that in endeavouring to remember
we but the more forget. I am neither of a
Birth or Character for doing base or little
things, my Name, Madam, is——, which I
<PB N="591" REF="453"/>
hope will in some sort reconcile you to that
irrevocable Misfortune that has so lately
happen'd. I give you my Word and Honour
never to disclose it so long as you shall
think fit to have any confidence in my Se∣crecy;
a farther distrust will be as disob∣liging
as the opportunity of being acquain∣ted
with a Lady of your Beauty and Merit
was charming.—I had thought</HI> (said
that languishing fair One) <HI>myself so little
known in the World, that I might without
danger have almost ventur'd any where.—You
forget, Madam,</HI> interrupted I
her hastily, <HI>that Persons of your Form
make not only swift but deep Impressions.
You could not shine at the</HI> Bath <HI>a whole
Season, and yet hope to be unknown:
Then your vanishing from the Eyes of all
your Noble Relations and Acquaintance,
was a Theam as wonderful as melancholy.—What
do they say of me in the
World?</HI> interrupted she: <HI>I am contented
to hear it.—Their Opinions were
different, Madam,</HI> I answer'd. <HI>For, what
could they imagine of a Lady of your Beau∣ty
and Fortune, leaving the latter un∣touch'd,
and a Noble Brother who was pas∣sionately
fond of a Sister so deserving? Lea∣ving,
I say, my Lord without knowledge
or consolation for your departure? It was
found that you were come to</HI> London <HI>to
his Steward's House; but vanishing from
thence; they could trace you no farther.
That faithful Servant has discharged his
duty to you at be ought; for my Lord
<PB N="592" REF="454"/>
could never bring him to confess that he
had any knowledge of the place where you
were, or what course you had taken. There
were not wanting those who gave him the
glory of such a Conquest, and his being a
married Man, might oblige you to conceal∣ment:
But others, better acquainted with
your Soul, said, you could never make a
choice so unworthy of yourself; in which
they were confirm'd by time, when no de∣mands
of Money were made, either by Let∣ter
or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>therwise, from or in your Name.
Others concluded you suddenly dead in some
place where you were unknown, or that you
had been murder'd. But all this was non∣sense;
for without some powerful motive,
what could have obliged you to be unknown,
tho' but for a day, and that motive might be
doubtless still in force; therefore the most
intelligible part of the World did not fail
to guess some happy young married Man of
Fortune had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the glory of ple<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng you
at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that with him (u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>evy∣ing
all other Delights) you were with drawn
to taste uninterruptedly the Sweets of mu∣tual
Love.</HI>—Here she turn'd her
Face upon the Pillow from me, and fetch∣ing
a great Sign, we continued silent for
near a quarter of an Hour. I very well
saw I was a Guest that was no way wel∣com,
and was (as in Wisdom I ought)
going several times to take my leave, and
retire: But chain'd by inevitable Incima∣tion,
methought it was doing myself a
violence I could by no means consent to.
<PB N="593" REF="455"/>
If ever any Person could be truly said to
be suddenly wounded, it was me. I lov'd
to a height of uneasiness, envy and jea∣lousie,
and was resolv'd to find and know
this happy Mr. <HI>King,</HI> (as she call'd him)
and dispute his Title to her. How often
could I have thrown myself down on the
Bed by her, and smoother'd her with a
thousand Kisses and Embraces! But Re∣spect
and Awe, the sure attendants of
Love, had seiz'd upon my Soul, and me∣thought
it was more easie for me to die,
than to displease her. Therefore that at
length prevailing, I rose up to take my
leave, and conjur'd her to believe, that
her Secret was safe with me; nay so fare,
that▪ if I once distrusted my power of
keeping it, I would sacrifice myself before
her face to secure her Fears. She could
not chuse but receive this assurance (which
I was not obliged to make) with a gracious
Air; and after she had return'd me Thanks
for it, ask'd me, from what place I came
that morning? I told her, from—How,
<HI>cry'd she,</HI> that is eight Miles wide
of this House: how could you wander
thus? How do you propose to return?
The Sun is of a great height; 'twill be
impossible for you to walk without kil∣ling
yourself with heat. I see <HI>pursa'd
she with a charming Smile,</HI> that you are
intail'd upon me for some Hours; I can't
without being inhospitable, thrust you
out of my House till the Evening, then I
have a Chaise at your service, which some∣times
<PB N="594" REF="456"/>
serves me to take the Air. In the
mean time, I believe you will find some
Refreshment necessary after your early ri∣sing
and your great walk. Then reaching
me her delicious Hand to help her from
off the Bed, she call'd her Woman, and
order'd her to bring in Chocolate, and
the Fruit she had bid the Gardner gather
in the cool of the morning. Guess you,
Madam, how I was ravish'd with her
Proposal: I needed not a second entreaty.
During our Breakfast, she desir'd me to
entertain her with the News of the Town;
not only with what I call'd new, but what
had pass'd for this last three Years; for to
her that had been buried (in that little So∣litude)
all things were so. I did not fail
to flourish as far as my weak Capacity
permitted, upon what I thought would
divert her. Good Manners carried her
above any farther show of distrust or dis∣content
of the morning's Adventure. She
seem'd pleas'd at my Discourse, and ask'd
me if I would give her leave to go into her
Dressing-Room, to put herself in a Po∣sture
less capable of frighting me? And
how would I dispose of myself in the
mean time? She carried me into the
next Room, and shew'd me a noble Li∣brary
in glass Cases; if I thought fit to
divert myself there, or endeavour to reco∣ver
my Fatigue of Walking, by a little
Sleep upon the Bed she had quitted? I
chose the latter, that I might throw my
Body upon the place her lovely Body had
<PB N="595" REF="457"/>
press'd. She took her leave, and left me
to my Reflexions, which were numerous
and disorder'd. I began violently to love,
without hopes of a return: I kiss'd a
thousand times the Pillows on which her
Head had rested; and where I imagin'd
it wet with her Tears, I could almost have
mingled my own with 'em. I was passio∣nate,
I was despairing, I was ravingly Amo∣rous!
In short, all that the fein'd Hero's of
Romances are said to feel, I in reality was
sensible on. Who was Mr. <HI>King,</HI> that hap∣py
Mr. <HI>King?</HI> I wanted much to know.
The Furniture of that little Box was like
a Cabinet, so fine, so clean, so well sui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d
so fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted for Love and Solitude. In short,
not able to obtain the intermission of
a moment's Sleep, I rose and pass'd
into the beautiful Garden. I was weary
of myself, and long'd to see ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rming
Mrs. <HI>King</HI> again. I found a Gardner at
work, and ask'd him w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n he expected
his Master home? The Fellow answer'd
me, he had been gone but that morning,
and he believ'd would not return till the
next. Respect to my beauteous Angel
hinder'd me from enquiring farther. I
return'd to the House, surveying all the
Windows, in hopes she would see that I
was not asleep: 'Tis true I had a Book
in my Hand, but with Thoughts wandring
as mine were, that was of little use. I
walk'd back to the Bench where first my
Pain began. There I found the pretty
Hat, and was such a Fool to kiss it over
<PB N="596" REF="458"/>
and over, and talk to it of my Pain. In
a word, I resolv'd if I could handsomly,
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eal it as a Relick of my Saint; there∣fore
brought it back and hid it in the
Room under the Bed where I had lain.
Two Flours (that is two Ages) had pass'd
since her absence. How often did I curse
the Invention of D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssing, nor did imagin
that she could put on any more Charming
than what I had seen her in. Restless
every where, I return'd again to my Gar∣den,
my Eyes never off the Windows
whence I believ'd my Satisfaction must
come. The Sha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es were all up, but the
Curtains down; at length I saw a lovely
Hand (which by the Diamond on the Fin∣ger
I knew to be hers) raise one of 'em,
and she herself appear'd dazling beyond
imagination. I immediately cry'd out War,
and told her, she had maliciously been arm∣ing
her byes and Form, to revenge upon me
my presumption for treading that forbid∣den
Ground. She smil'd at what she only
believ'd a piece of Gallantry, and ask'd
me obligingly, if I would come up, and
she would send her Woman to shew me
the way. I flew after my Conductress;
but became immovable at the sight of that
noble Air with which charming Mrs. <HI>King</HI>
appear'd; so graceful, her Height so just,
so commanding, her lovely Neck in all
its due proportion, her Shape so perfect,
her Hair so fine; in short, who says that
a <HI>Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abile</HI> can charm, when it conceals so
many more Beauty than the Dress reveals?
<PB N="597" REF="459"/>
Doubtless she saw the Impression she had
made upon my Mind; and to help me
out of my apparent Confusion, desir'd to
know if she should entertain me at Piquet
till Dinner. I was, you may be sure, all
Obedience; but I watch'd her Eyes a thou∣sand
times more than the Cards. She
laugh'd at my Play, and told me I minded
not the Game, and that she should gain
no honour by conquering. But what
should I say? Alas! I was no longer my∣self,
all I did favour'd of Distraction;
and I am a thousand times wild at think∣ing
how mean an opinion I must have gi∣ven
her of my Wit, in giving her so ma∣ny
proofs of my Love. Dinner staid for
us below, I had the pleasure of leading
her into a pretty Hall, floor'd with Mar∣ble,
the sides hung with large <HI>Indian</HI> Pi∣ctures,
and so high as the Chairs lin'd
with <HI>Dutch</HI> Tiles, a Fountain in a corner
of the Room joining the Buffet, wash'd
and cool'd our Glasses; nothing could be
better order'd than her Table. The first
Service was in Plate, the second gilt, and
the last China. Her Woman and two
Grils of about 12 Years old (one of 'em
a Black, habited after the manner of the
Dancers at the Play House) were all the
Attendants we had; other Servants, as I
guess'd, waited without, to bring and re∣ceive
the Dishes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But, what was
all that Feast to me? My Eyes and
Senses were only fix'd upon charming
Mrs. <HI>King.</HI> She obligingly carv'd to me,
<PB N="598" REF="460"/>
when she saw I wou'd not help myself;
all she cou'd get me to eat was a piece of
a Melon cool'd with Ice, and some Sallad,
which she told me was of her own raising.
Nor is your Ladyship to wonder at my
naming Ice; there were Reservatories,
and, in short, all the convenience of a
Palace in this little House. Our Wine
was delicate, her Conversation charming,
and had I had but liberty of improving
my Happiness without constraint; and
she kind, yielding, and pleas'd, the
whole Creation cou'd not have furnish'd
out such another Scene of Delight.</P>
<P>This little Country Entertainment put
me in mind of <HI>Erasmus</HI>'s Spiritual Feast;
for Variety, I'll recite part of it to your
Ladyship by way of Dialogue. She ask'd
me (when we rose from Table) how we
should pass the remainder of the Day?
for Cards she did not see me fond of;
Do you love fishing, Sir? We have a large
Brook runs at the bottom of a Meadow,
where we catch excellent Trout; the Bank
is shady after twelve a Clock; and I be∣lieve
I can't offer you a Diversion that
seems better to suit your Temper; you
may be as thoughtful and contemplative as
you please, I shall be sure not to interrupt
you, because that Employment never
fails to have those Effects upon me. The
Girls shall bring down our Fishing-Tackle,
and wait at a distance fitted for Service, but
not Interruption. Bring hither the Um∣brella's,
tho' we have no farther use of
<PB N="599" REF="461"/>
'em than crossing the Meadow, and shall find
it shady and cool upon the Banks. One of
you run before with Cushions, and all
things necessary for our Diversion. Have I
not told you true, Sir? Cou'd you imagine
any thing Pleasanter for the Season? There's
your Rod, cast in your Line, and let us wager
who shall catch the first or most Fish.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> All you shew me, and all I have seen
and heard to Day, Madam, are so won∣derful,
that I am doubting whether I am
awake; or if awake, whether not In∣chanted,
and in some of those delightful
Castles of Old, where every thing exceeds
Imagination. Whilst we with our Lines and
Baits are seeking to delude the poor harmless
Fish, methinks it were not improper to
begin a Discourse of that Passion you can
so well inspire. I can make you no grea∣ter
a Compliment, than putting you upon
a Subject which I am sure you are the in∣tire
Mistress of. Is it possible, Madam,
to find Sweets in Love, capable of re∣compensing
the loss of all other Delights?
And do not you think Friends, Relations,
Cards, Plays, Balls; and, in short, every
Diversion, proper for your Youth and For∣tune,
much undersold by this Choice that
you have made? I do not reflect upon
happy Mr. <HI>King</HI>'s Charms; I know him
not; but pardon me if I do not think any
mortal Merit can deserve so great a Sacri∣fice,
after the generous and hospitable
Entertainment you have made me, and in
good Manners I ought to wave any Dis∣course
<PB N="600" REF="462"/>
upon this Subject. But, Madam,
I have a nearer concern for you than
what relates to Custom and Ceremony.
I wou'd argue you out of this wrong way
you are in, restore you to your Family
and Fortune; such a Beauty as yours was
design'd to adorn a Court, not gild a Cot∣tage.
I judge what you are able to do upon
others, by what I feel you have done up∣on
me. Therefore it is that I wou'd have
you shine where Fortune and your Birth
seems to call you, and to leave this inglo∣rious
Solitude, where the best that can be
said of your Pleasures, are, that they be
not Pains, those excepted which you taste
when your happy Lover is with you.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> The Privilege you have taken in
choosing such a Subject as this (however
ungrateful it be to me) shall at this time
be forgiven, because I believe you attempt
the Argument out of Friendship; for I
know you so true a judge of what is fit,
that upon any other account you would
not have been guilty of it; but whence
is it that you mistake so far, to think I
do not enjoy more Happiness than if I
were in a Court? Those Diversions you
have nam'd, are but Noise and Hurry, and
may indeed please the Senses, but never
the Mind, in <HI>that</HI> lies all our Enjoyment,
'tis there that we place all our most af∣fecting
Delights, our most ravishing Sweets;
'tis that only that can indear our Possessi∣ons
to us; for shou'd the Mind be fix'd
upon another Object, a Monarch with his
<PB N="601" REF="463"/>
Crown wou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> imoe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinent Ambiti∣on,
and a Glory no more pleasing, than
Vanity can be truly call'd Merit, or ex∣tream
old Age a Blessing.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> And yet, Madam, was I not this
happy Morning a witness how many ways
you sought to delude those Hours that
apparently hung upon your Hands? So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣tude
is doubtless sometimes good to those
who have Souls capable of tasting it; 'tis
the excess of it is only blameable. We na∣turally
desire Conversation, and variety in
Conversation; for being always confin'd
to one, is but a degree beyond conversing
with ourselves. Mistake me not, I do
not argue against that enchant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Pleasure
only to be tasted between happy Lovers,
but wou'd learn from your Experience,
if continuance and length of time does not
take off the Delight, the transporting
Ardours which are heightned by Difficul∣ties,
as much as it seems to me they
shou'd be pass'd by too constant use, or too
easie an accession of 'em.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> I shou'd belye the Truth, Sir, or
personare the Vertue of the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> did I
pretend never to have found some Hours
of Solitude burthensom; but how am I
sure I shou'd not have receiv'd as much
or more disgust from Conversation and
the Business of the World? Are any thing
more feign'd than your Friendships; more
false than your Lovers; more impertinent
than Gossips; more censorious than Re∣lations;
more dull than many that are
<PB N="602" REF="464"/>
call'd Wits; or so insipid and tasteless as
Conversation, when Love, Scandal, and
Business are away? Then, as for what you
call Diversions from Balls, Cards, and
P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays; the latter can as well, with a
little help of the Imagination, entertain
me in my Closet or Garden, as if I were
at either of the Houses. Balls are much
disused, and were ever made upon some
particular Design, and not always with
too much Innocency. Cards are so dan∣gerous
a Diversion, that I should never
have done, did I recount half the ruin and
disorder they have occasion'd; ev'n in my
Solitude, I have heard what but the other
Day happen'd upon this account. A
young Lady of a good Family in the
Country, and married to a Gentleman
who will have a handsom Estate when
his Father's Dead, came up to <HI>London,</HI>
and fell into so ill Hands, and so great a
lover of Play, that she quickly lost all
her ready Money, and made away her
Dressing Plate, Jewels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for a supply;
that gone too, her last Stake was a pair
of Diamond Bar Rings of my Lady—
her Mothers, which she gave her to have
new set; she under pawn'd 'em for a great
deal less than they were worth; fifty
Pound was the Sum she got upon 'em,
with which she hoped to retrieve the rest,
and turn the run of her ill Fortune; but
she quickly lost that too, if she had
had a Million in the ill Hands she was in,
'twou'd have all flown the same way.
<PB N="603" REF="465"/>
What shou'd she do? Her Husband was
in the Country, her Mother severe and
covetous, with two Daughters upon
her Hands; their Father dying without a
Will, they had hopes of no other For∣tune
but what my Lady cou'd save 'em
out of her Joynture; therefore in all pro∣bability,
she would be extreamly angry at
this Extravangancy in her married Daugh∣ter.
A mortal Melancholy succeeded:
She complain'd to one that had been her
Mother's Woman, a fatal Counsellor; who
bid her be of good Comfort, 'twou'd be a
strange thing for a young Lady, Handsom
and Innocent, to want Money in a World
like this. Then taking Pen and Paper, she
be thought her of offering her to my
Lord of <HI>S</HI>—at the Price of the
Ear-Rings. The young Lady had seen
him at a Race in her own Country, and
consented at the expence of her Vertue, to
be made a Sacrifice by that detestable
Creature. But his Grace (who loves
Money too well) refus'd the offer, unless
he could first see the young Lady; nor
wou'd promise then to like her, because
he was already engag'd; tho' 'tis thought
the Fifty Pieces were his Mistress. See
then if any thing can be more pernici∣ous
than Gaming. I cou'd name you
several Instances diverting enough to those
who have no Friendship or Relation to
the Unfortunate. I think the King of
<HI>France</HI> had done well, if in forbidding
Basset, he had also forbid all Ladies un∣der
<PB N="604" REF="466"/>
Thirty, to play for above such a Sum
of Money; and that other Governments
wou'd do the same thing.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> You almost argue me, Madam,
out of my ill opinion of Solitude; not
but if Conversation be an Evil, I dare
boldly maintain, 'tis an Evil we cannot be
without, and where the Good (notwith∣standing
all your Ladyship has said) sur∣mounts
the Bad; but this is but half of
my Request, you have not answer'd me
to that Part; Whether too easie, and un∣intermitting
an Enjoyment, does not pall
the Ardour and lessen the Delight?</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> You are very curious, methinks,
and will let me catch no Fish; if we don't
succeed, I can't tell what you will do for
Supper, you have, as yet, eat nothing,
and 'twill be barbarous to send you hence
half starved; at this rate you wou'd have
but little reason to boast of your Ad∣venture.
Ah! see I have caught the
first, 'tis a lovely Trout: Oh poor Crea∣ture,
how it struggles and pants now 'tis
out of its Element. Here, <HI>Mynae,</HI> take
care of this poor Wretch; where's the
Net to put it in? Oh don't hurt it. So,
tie it close that it may not get out, bait
my Hook again, and go to your Compa∣tion.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> How happy are you, Madam,
that can be thus amused, that is, so
cheaply pleas'd? Ah, 'tis impossible that
any great Passion can possess a Soul so
serenely calm. I, who pretended all my
<PB N="605" REF="467"/>
life to that happy Indifference, and who
but yesterd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y cou'd have been as easily
diverted, feel it otherwise now. I wetch
your lovely Eye instead of the Fishing.
Line, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m caught myself, instead of
catching others.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> This Gallantry makes you Men
so impertinent. Pray tell me, do you
think we expect these sort of Courtships?
It must certainly be so, else upon all Oc∣casions,
and to all Persons, you wou'd
never tous promiscuously use 'em.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> I cou'd easily convince you, Ma∣dam,
that you are treated by me in a par∣ticular
manner to what other Ladies are;
but it wou'd be too great a presumption
for a Stranger, till by my Services I may
have merited the liberty of speaking. I
wou'd begin by res<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oring you to the
World, to your Family and Fame, which
I must sincerely tell you, suffers all things
by your unaccountable Absence. I shall
appear rather a Divine than a Gallant in
wha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> going to say; your Friend I
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> am and wou'd sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w what others
perhaps may but speak. Answer me,
Madam, to what I not long since ask'd
you; it is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that the Ardour of
your first blames feels no decay. Upon
that I ground my Proposition, if you
please to be sincere, I shall be proud
to think myself not Impertinent; other∣wise
upon this Subject I must be for ever
dumb before you.</P>
<P><PB N="606" REF="468"/>
<HI>She.</HI> You put me strangely to it; for
If I assert my Constancy, you will be apt
to call it Dissimulation; if I admit an
Abatement, or what you call a Decay,
my Principles will be taxed: But certain
it is, were it to do again, I should pre∣fer
my Fame and Family before all things.
But how can I return? What account shall
I give of my Absence? Who will believe
that I have been Innocent whilst absent?
Relieve me from this Difficulty, and I
will admit you to be the Friend you pro∣fess.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> The matter, Madam, is not so
hard as you imagin; if you'll depend up∣on
my method, I'll engage to find you
one that shall succeed. Pretend a change
of Religion, retire yourself into some Ca∣tholick
Country, Pension yourself in a Mona∣stry,
write to your. Friends from thence,
that you have seen your Error, and are
willing to return to your Mothe Church;
Money can do all things, and that you
need never want, without touching your
own Fortune. We may easily make be be∣liev'd
that you have been out of <HI>England</HI>
these three Years, and that your Jewels
have more than answer'd your religious
Expences; but not finding that Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sfacti∣on
in your change which you pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pos'd,
you design a return, contrary to your re∣solve
when you went out of <HI>England;</HI>
that the Grief you knew your Conversion
would cause to my Lord—an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the
rest of your Relations, was the only rea∣son
<PB N="607" REF="469"/>
that made you conceal not only that
but the place of your Abode.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> Is it lawful, think you, for our
private ends to trifle with Religion, and
make the greatest good a cover for our
ill?</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> Not if Religion suffer'd by our
Pretences; but, Madam, when all things are
sacred to us that should be so, we ought
not to scruple at small things: The good
People of the Monastry, as we may order
it, will certify that you have been there
such a time, if they are but well paid for
it: Tho' I do not think there will be any
occasion for the Question, your Affair hav∣ing
pass'd already with that secrecy. Be∣sides,
'twill be the interest of your Fa∣mily
not themselves to look too near, but
to aid those designs that shall endeavour
to restore you clear to the opinion of the
World.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> But my charming Solitude, my
dearer, quiet, delightful Moments, how
can I part with ye for ever?</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> Consider, Madam, you do but
leave that which will inevitably forsake
you: The time repeated that you have
been here, (or long before) and all these
Pleasures, will fly before you, even now
(or I deceive my judgment) they appear
but as the Ghosts of what they have been,
when Desire was new, your Joy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in their
first bloom, and Fame, and Honour, abun∣dantly
less esteem'd.</P>
<P><PB N="608" REF="470"/>
<HI>She.</HI> Hold, do not wound me in that
tender Part; there, I confess, I he too
open to your Assault: I would retrieve
my Glory at the price of my Life; but
Love is still beyond 'em both.</P>
<P><HI>He.</HI> God forbid, Madam, that so ele∣vated
a Soul should be capable of so crimi∣nal
a Weakness, especially after three
Years possession. Consider, by your lon∣ger
stay you will lose the opportunity of
returning to your Fame and Family:
Whilst Youth and Beauty are of our sides,
all things will be the more easily believ'd.
Let me conjure you to enter into yourself,
and examin but your own Breast: Cannot
those heroick Thoughts, the natural Com∣panions
to noble Birth, overcome a Frailty
which custom and opinion has render'd
the Scandal and Weakness of your Sex,
and the Contempt of ours? Figure to
yourself there may come a time (all char∣ming
as you are) when this happy Lover,
this unknown Mr. <HI>King,</HI> may himself be
weary of those Joys which he possesses
with too great a calm: Foresta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him,
Madam, forestall the natural Inconstancy
of our Sex, and shew that you dare bold∣ly
strike for Glory, tho' by it all your
Delights are levell'd with common Plea∣sures.</P>
<P><HI>She.</HI> I will consider deeply on what
you offer, and in the mean time return
you a thousand Thanks for what you
have said: You must have friendly Care
of me, or you would not have taken this
<PB N="609" REF="471"/>
pains in my Conversion, but for the pre∣sent
let us wave this Argument, and on∣ly
think how we shall pass the rest of the
Day in Pleasures less severe than this
Conversation? I thought, Madam, to
have gain'd a mighty point in staggering
her Inclination to Solitude, and that
cou'd I but once draw her into the World;
I shou'd have many opportunities (as be∣ing
necessary to her Service) to insinuate
my Passion, which every moment receiv'd
addition by her lovely Person; her grace∣ful
Motions, her all commanding Glances,
and ten thousand inimitable unscribable
Graces. The rest of the Evening we spent
in Gallantry; I told her all that I cou'd
to divert and give her an opinion of my
Conversation: Methought she seem'd to
taste it with some Pleasure, and that how∣ever
she profess'd herself a lover of Soli∣tude,
she was no real Enemy to Company.</P>
<P>She wou'd keep me to Supper; the
Moon shone, and the Chaise, she said,
wou'd quickly carry me eight Mile. I was
transported at her Civility, and almost
began to think, that Solitude being a
Friend to Love, those few opportunities
she had of conversing, gave her a higher
Relish; and that it wou'd be no hard mat∣ter,
by a Repetition or my Visits, to gain
her Favour. I ask'd her not the permis∣sion,
because those are things which by a
Lover ought to be taken; and he is worthy
to be deny'd who attempts to beg what
he should boldly seize. When the Mo∣moment
<PB N="610" REF="472"/>
of Separation came, it was as if my
Soul and Body parted; I kiss'd her Hand
with a profound Sigh, telling her I car∣ry'd
along with me her charming Image,
which wou'd continually play before my
sight, and suffer me to have no other plea∣sure
but Reflexion, till I repeated my
Happiness by seeing her again.</P>
<P>All the time I was in the Chaise, I may
very well say I knew not who I was, nor
where I was going; but buried in a pro∣found
Contemplation, my whole Thoughts
ran upon charming Mrs. <HI>King,</HI> and we
were come to the end of the Town before
I consider'd of it. There was no Foot-Man
with me, so that the Chaise stop∣ping,
the Coachman alighted, and com∣ing
up with much Civility, told me, he
hop'd I would not take it ill, for his
Commission ended here, having no orders
to go into the Town. This rous'd me
from my Pensiveness; I in a moment found
the fair Lady had been too cunning for
me, that she had only kept me till, Night
on purpose that I should not know the
Road I was carried, nor any of those Vil∣lages
we went through; and I may safe∣ly
protest, that all pass'd as if it had been
a Dream to me. However, I did not fail
to obey her seeming Orders, and in quit∣ting
the Chaise, return'd my Thanks and
Duty to the Lady; I guess'd 'twas vain to
ask Questions of the Coachman. How∣ever,
I cou'd nor choose but curse my own
Folly. Had any one ask'd me of my Ad∣ventures,
<PB N="611" REF="473"/>
all the account I cou'd give,
was, that I had been in a pretty House,
one Mr. <HI>King</HI>'s, seated far from any com∣mon
Road; but where or how the place
was call'd, or any near it, I cou'd not tell,
nor was it the least part of the Address
of the lovely Charmer, by which I found
my Vanity mortify'd, and myself deceiv'd.
I imagin'd she tasted no Pleasure in my
Conversation, since by this last Action she
apparently shew'd, that she did not desire
the continuance of it. Home I walk'd to
my fair Maid, whom I had left behind.
She imagin'd me lost (as indeed I was
to myself) or that some Misfortune had
befallen me. Her Questions and Kindness
were both insipid and impertinent. I
went to bed upon the pretence of weari∣ness,
to avoid her; where my last Adven∣ture
came fresh into my Mind, and du∣ring
a short interval of Sleep, I possest the
lovely Charmer in my Thoughts, all melt∣ing,
full of Rapture and Delight. The
Transport awak'd me, and soon made me
sensible, not only of my Mistake, but of
the cruel Separation we had so lately suf∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd.</P>
<P>The next Day I went to <HI>London,</HI> to en∣deavour,
if possible, to divert in Company
this new uneasiness of Heart. But in vain,
I cou'd not hinder the bent of my Mind
from returning to the Object that had
charm'd it, nor my Person from being
hurried by my Inclinations back to—I
left my fair Companion in <HI>London,</HI> so
<PB N="612" REF="474"/>
that uninterruptedly I cou'd taste the
height of Melancholy and Contemplati∣on.
Early the next Morning, I rose, and
dressing with a more than ordinary Care,
I put myself upon repeating my former
Adventure. I attemptd to find the way
to Mr. <HI>King</HI>'s House, cross'd over Lanes
and Fields, but in vain. I believ'd, instead
of eight, I went thirty Miles, here and
there, wandering without a Guide, des∣cribing
the House, and asking of all I
met with for it, by his Name but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tidings
cou'd I get. So th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> weary,
I was forc'd to take into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to refresh
myself. There I ear what the place cou'd
afford, and laid me down on a Bed to
sleep; but that was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> indeavour, to
rest me the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; whilst the heat of the Day
lasted. That over, I began again my
fruitless search; and by that time it was
dark, found myself at a Village eighteen
Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and fourteen from
the place I had set out from. You may
guess, Madam, that next Morning I was
forced to search for some better Conveni∣ency
for Travelling, than I had had the
Day before. I procur'd a Coach for
<HI>London;</HI> where I was no sooner arrived,
than I order'd my Horses with two Ser∣vants
to be brought. I mounted and re∣turn'd
back to—. From whence I
again set out upon my Search, obstinate to
find what seem'd so difficult. We took
different Roads; and not to tire your
Patience, sought almost over the whole
Country before my Curiosity was gratify'd.
<PB N="613" REF="475"/>
At length 'twas my own good Fortune to
recover the House. I knock'd, but there
was nobody to open, the Shutters were
close, and not the lest sign of any living
Creature; I compass'd the House, and
coming to the Garden-Gate, found the
Windows of the Trillow close; I knock'd,
but with no better Success. I try'd all
the Lanes near the House; one led me to
a small Village about a quarter of a Mile
diffance, where my Curiosity was referr'd
to a little Ale. House on the right hand, near
where Mr. <HI>King</HI> had liv'd. I was not
long in finding it; I alighted and went to
examine my Landlady; but alas! from
her I gain'd but the confirmation of that
Misfortune, which I before too justly
fear'd. She told me they were gone a∣way,
(the Day of their removal I found
to be the next but one of my Adventure)
but where she cou'd not t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll; the whole
Furniture of the House being carried
thence, it was not likely that they pro∣pos'd
to return. I ask'd her, if she had e∣ver
seen Mr. <HI>King?</HI> She told me, often,
and drew a Person I cou'd no way guess at.
Then her Husband was call'd to help out
his Wife's ill Painting; their Descriptions
were not the same in any one Feature; next
the Son and Daughter came under Exami∣nation;
but not any of 'em agreed so much
as in the colour of Mr. <HI>King</HI>'s Perriwig;
unless it were in that one Article, that
neither he nor his Lady, in all the time
they had liv'd there, were ever known to
go to Church; that they were very proud
<PB N="614" REF="476"/>
Folk, for they wou'd not be acquainted
with any of their Neighbours, and carry'd
their Heads very high, for all he was but
a Mr. Tho' belike a Servant in a Livery
calling to Drink one day at their House,
and seeing Mr. <HI>King</HI> pass by in a Chaise,
said, he was a Lord! my Lord, my Lord,
of the Lord knows what; for they had
forgot. How cou'd I have curst their hap∣py
Stupidity; what wou'd I not have given
to have had 'em recal that one little act
of Memory, that bare Word, that conse∣quence
of my Lord—the Lord
knows what, my Lord, the Lord knows
who; for thus in their proper Dialect did
they think fit to seize me. I learn't from
'em that Mr. <HI>King</HI> had purchas'd that lit∣tle
House, and now they were departed,
'twas lock'd up without any intention of its
being Let. There's a rare Garden (cries the
Female Brute) and choice Fruit; I wou'd
<HI>Roger</HI> wou'd let our <HI>John</HI> try to get over
the Garden-Wall and gather Master some.
I clos'd in with the good Woman, and got
leave for our <HI>John,</HI> tho' my business was
to have him open the back Gate; I want∣ed
methought to wander in those Walks
alone, where I had been once blest with
my cruel fugitive. I cou'd have out rav'd
<HI>Oroondates,</HI> out-talkd all the Heroes of
antiquity, in complaining on my more
abdurate <HI>Statira.</HI> To be short, our <HI>John</HI>
succeeded beyond imagination, for whether
thro' chance or forgetfulness, the Key
was left on the inside the Door. When I
<PB N="615" REF="477"/>
saw it open to me, I thought myself as happy as if
I were entering Paradise. But alass! that Joy
was but of small duration; I found there no foot∣steps
of my lovely Charmer, nor a likelihood of
her return; for all the fine Pots and Greens
were gone, the Garden in great disorder and an
apparent neglest of every thing. I ascended
the Terrass, leaving <HI>John</HI> to the Fruit, and
went to sit me down on a Seat rais'd with
Turf, and cover'd with Camomile, at the ex∣tremity
of the Walk, in that very place where
once I had rested with my Charmer. I
threw myself like a fond amorous Fool, at my
length upon the Seat; I kiss'd, I talk'd to
those happy insensible Vegetable, as if they
cou'd have given me an account of my Loss;
at length growing a little cooler, I gave my
Thoughts and Eyes leave to consider upon a
piece of Camomile, of about a Foot square,
cub and cemented again. I took a Pen-knife
from my <HI>Etney,</HI> and parting the Earth, follow'd
the impression that had been made before; and
quickly found it but a cover to a Hole that had
been digg'd there. I continu'd to remove the
Earth, till I discover'd and with little labour, took
up a small <HI>Indian</HI> Trunk; by the lightness I guess'd
there cou'd be nothing of value in it; I weigh'd
long within myself whether I shou'd open it? I
cou'd not easily (being so self-interested) deter∣mine
whether it was a base Action or not. At
length, all transported with Curiosity, I found a
means, by the help of some of my Tools, to force
the Lock; there was nothing in it but Papers;
but what, think you were those Papers? Why in∣deed
happy Mr. <HI>King</HI>'s Love Letters, and her
Answers; their was neither Name or Address to
any of them; they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em'd as if they had all came
inclos'd, so that my Curiosity was as much at a
loss as before. However, I resolv'd upon that
piece of Revenge, to bear 'em away with me; I
<PB N="616" REF="478"/>
soon empty'd the Trunk, and return'd that to its Re∣pository,
cover'd it with Earth as before, and fix'd
upon it the Camomile piece of Earth as I first found
it. Away I carry'd my Treasure <HI>Trovue.</HI> Discharg∣ing
our <HI>John</HI> and his Mother, I took two or three
Peaches and Nectrins, mounted my Horse, and got
me into the Road for <HI>London;</HI> but my Curiosity gave
me no intermission till I had struck into a shady place,
where alighting, I took out my fatal Cargo, and fell
to reading those mortifying, transpor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Papers.
How did I envy the happy Fortune of that b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est un∣known
Mr. <HI>King.</HI> Oh what tender unimaginable soft∣nesses
were there in her Letters! the very Soul of
Love, as if the God had took up his residence in her
Heart, and from thence inspir'd those inimitable
Lines. I shall not in the least speak maliciously,
when I tell you, that my Rivals were much inferiour;
methought there was a poorness of Stile, a meanness
of Expression, a studied Passion in his; whilst hers
were full of luxuriant Nature, rich in Love and Beau∣ty.
I read so long, till I almost lost the small remain∣der
of my Senses, which had never been very perfect,
since I had first seen Mrs. <HI>King.</HI> What shall I say?
Thus have I remain'd, and am <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ikely to do till I re∣trive
that adorable Wanderer. There is nothing, no
means unessay'd by me to recover her, I have Emisso∣ries
in every part of <HI>London</HI> and near it, to bring me
the Description of all that are reputed Strangers; I
cou'd lavish with Joy my whole Estate upon the
Search, had I but a certainty at last of succeeding.—Oh
forgive me for thus long burthening you with my
Misfortunes: I write for ease and consolation; there's
not another Friend upon Earth who shou'd share this
Secret with me; not that I conceive myself bound
by any Promise of mine to Mrs. <HI>King,</HI> since she so in∣gratefully
refus'd to confide in me; but Love and
Respect makes me wish her Fault may for ever be a
Secret to the World. Wrong not the Confidance (I
conjure you) that I have in your Vertue and Silence;
keep it inviolable, preserve it as you wou'd the Heart
of your happiest Lover: So may you never know the
anguish of a Disappointment; never feel the Pangs
with which charming Mrs. <HI>King</HI>'s unalterable Adorer
asserts himself, <HI>Madam, your most obedient,</HI></P>
