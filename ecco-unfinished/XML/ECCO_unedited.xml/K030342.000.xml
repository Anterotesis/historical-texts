<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">By the Author of EURYDICE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. Quin.</STAGE>
<L>WHEN this decisive Night, at length, appears,</L>
<L>The Night of every Author's Hopes and Fears;</L>
<L>What Shifts, to bribe Applause, poor Poets try?</L>
<L>In all the Forms of Wit they court and lye:</L>
<L>These meanly beg it, as an Alms; and Those,</L>
<L>By boastful Bluster, dazzle and impose.</L>
<L>Nor poorly fearful, nor securely vain;</L>
<L>Ours would, by honest Ways, that Grace obtain:</L>
<L>Would, as a Free-born Wit, be fairly try'd:</L>
<L>And then—let Truth and Candour, fair, decide.</L>
<L>He courts no Friend, who blindly comes to praise;</L>
<L>He dreads no Foe—but whom his Faults may raise.</L>
<L>Indulge a generous Pride, that bids him own,</L>
<L>He aims to please, by noble Means, alone:</L>
<L>By what may win the Judgment, wake the Heart,</L>
<L>Inspiring Nature, and directing Art:</L>
<L>By Scenes, so wrought, so rais'd, as may command</L>
<L>Applause, more from the Head, than from the Hand.</L>
<L>Important is the Moral we wou'd teach:</L>
<L>(Oh may this Island practise what we preach!)</L>
<L>Vice, in its first Approach, with Care to shun;</L>
<L>The Wretch, who once engages, is undone.</L>
<L>Crimes lead to greater Crimes, and link so streight,</L>
<L>What first was Accident, at last is Fate:</L>
<L>Th' unhappy Servant sinks into a Slave;</L>
<L>And Virtue's last sad Strugglings cannot save.</L>
<L>“As such our fair Attempt, we hope to see</L>
<L>Our Judges,—here at least,—from Influence free;</L>
<L>One Place,—unbiass'd yet by Party-Rage,—</L>
<L>Where only Honour votes,—the <HI>British</HI> Stage.</L>
<L>We ask for Justice, for Indulgence sue:</L>
<L>Our last best Licence must proceed from you.</L>

<L>I know Thee; know these Eyes, where smiling Love,</L>

<L>Give me my happy Family around;</L>
<L>Give me my Virtue, Honour, nay my Glory;</L>
<L>Or give me Death, tho' Death cannot relieve me—</L>
<L>Are these the Deeds of Love?—I cannot step,</L>

<L>Compar'd with this polluted this dire Palace,</L>
<L>The Sepulcher is gay.—But whither fly?—</L>
<L>Ah! what avails it where the Guilty fly,</L>
<L>Since from themselves they cannot!—Ha! Behold!</L>
<L>The black Abyss discloses to my View;</L>
<L>And down I go, a dark a deep Descent!—</L>
<L>Hell from beneath is mov'd at my Approach:</L>
<L>It's Princes flock around. Behold, they say,</L>
<L>The greatly-wretched, greatly-wicked Woman!</L>
<L>She who preferr'd the Villain to the Hero!</L>
<L>The <HI>Trojan</HI> Shades, with sharp Derision, thank me:</L>
<L>The <HI>Grecian</HI> droop—Lo! where he comes himself!</L>
<L>See! How in fullen Majesty he stalks!—</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. Cibber.</STAGE>
<L>OUR Bard, to Modern Epilogue a Foe,</L>
<L>Thinks such mean Mirth but deadens generous
Woe;</L>
<L>Dispels in idle Air the Moral Sigh,</L>
<L>And weeps the tender Tear from Pity's Eye:</L>
<L>No more with social Warmth the Bosom burns;</L>
<L>But all th' unfeeling, selfish Man returns.</L>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another Epilogue was spoken after the first Representation of the Play, which began with the first six Lines of This: but the rest of that Epilogue, having been very justly disliked by the Audience, This was substituted in its Place.</NOTE>
<L>Thus he began:—And you approv'd the Strain;</L>
<L>'Till the next Couplet sunk to light and vain.</L>
<L>You check'd him there.—To You, to Reason just,</L>
<L>He owns he triumph'd in your kind Disgust.</L>
<L>Charm'd by your Frown, by your Displeasure grac'd,</L>
<L>He hails the rising Virtue of your Taste.</L>
<L>Wide will it's Influence spread, as soon as known:</L>
<L>Truth, to be lov'd, needs only, to be shown.</L>
<L>Confirm it, once, the Fashion to be good:</L>
<L>(Since Feshion leads the Fool, and awes the Rude)</L>
<L>No Perulance shall wound the Publick Ear;</L>
<L>No Hand applaud what Honour shuns to hear;</L>
<L>No painful Blush the Modest Cheek shall stain;</L>
<L>The worthy Breast shall heave with no disdain.</L>
<L>Chastis'd to Decency, the <HI>British</HI> Stage</L>
<L>Shall oft invite the Fair, invite the Sage:</L>
<L>Both shall attend well-pleas'd, well-pleas'd depart;</L>
<L>Or if they doom the Verse, absolve the Heart.</L>
