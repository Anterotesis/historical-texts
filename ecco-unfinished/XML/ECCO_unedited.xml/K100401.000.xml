<HEAD><HI>PROLOGUE Spoken by Mr.</HI> Thurmond.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE <HI>Youthful Author</HI> of our Scenes to Day;</L>
<L>Who scarce writes <HI>Man,</HI> has boldly writ a <HI>Play!</HI></L>
<L>But now we fear New Plays no more can thrive,</L>
<L>Than Summer Fruits in Winter Frosts survive.</L>
<L>Poetick Lawrels then triumphant show,</L>
<L>And shall their Branches now less chearful Grow?</L>
<L>Shall those kind genial Heats that Bless the Year,</L>
<L>Come to create a Barren Season here?</L>
<L>Or, shall that Tree, Fame's Wreath by <HI>PHOEBUS</HI> made,</L>
<L>Now Parch! and at his sultry Influence Fade?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Poet, who to Night attempts at Praise,</L>
<L>From various Turns, wou'd your Diversion raise.</L>
<L>To please Gay Fancies, he at Humour strove,</L>
<L>At <HI>Plot</HI> for Criticks, for the Ladies <HI>Love.</HI></L>
<L>Yet Life's low Scenes he owns may here seem scarce,</L>
<L>But well-wrought Business makes amends for Farce.</L>
<L>Not but our Scene drawn on a Foreign Coast</L>
<L>Of homebred Fools might some resemblance boast;</L>
<L>For tho' each Clime t'improve the Muses Toil,</L>
<L>Yet Fools, like Weeds; shoot up in every Soil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our lively Images are too sublime!</L>
<L>We draw our Glory from the <HI>British-Clime.</HI></L>
<L>In our <HI>wild Hero's</HI> Character we tell,</L>
<L>What <HI>Love,</HI> what <HI>Honour</HI> in the <HI>English</HI> dwell.</L>
<L>Not one of Nature<HI>'s</HI> Monsters here we show,</L>
<L>Yet thro' our Scenes some seeds of Satire strow.</L>
<L>Be gen'rous then! And let our Author<HI>'s</HI> Care,</L>
<L>Appease the <HI>Criticks,</HI> and Divert the <HI>Fair.</HI></L>

<P>Sir <HI>Charles Winlove!</HI> What Miracle has brought you here?</P>

<P>Why faith, 'tis a Miracle owing to Fortune—Have you heard what has happen'd to me at <HI>Madrid?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard of your unfortunate Adven∣ture there, before I left it—How long have you been come to <HI>Valencia?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>About a Fortnight, and I only wait for a fair Wind to carry me to <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="70"/>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'de advise you to make the best of your Way, for there was a Rumour that Orders wou'd be sent to the Sea-Ports to put a Stop to your Passage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this comes now of Intriguing in <HI>Spain—</HI>A Man can't carry on an Amour, but he must cut the Throat of some jealous Coxcomb or other to Cure him of his Impertinence—But what other News? I find you left <HI>Madrid</HI> la∣ter than I did—Is my Rival that I Wounded, Dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I came away I heard that his Life was despair'd of.—And that the Lady for whom your Quarrel began, was fled from her Fa∣ther's House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for her sake, for She is every way so Agreeable; that cou'd I learn to be Con∣stant, twou'd be only to her—But I find one Love is still an Antidote to Expel another: For I have seen such a Beauty here in <HI>Valencia.—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another Beauty, Sir <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, one so Charming, so good Hu∣mour'd, and so Witty, she's enough to turn the Resolutions of a <HI>Cynick—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is She a Woman of Quality?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I can't tell—Her Appearance is as yet like that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>Cynthia</HI> in a Cloud, for I have never seen her but in a VEIL.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought to have heard that you'd have been more Cautious Sir <HI>Charles—</HI>But I find you are still the same, and are resolv'd to bear the Frowns of Fortune, with as much Pleasure as her Smiles—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, <HI>Don Philip,</HI> Let Cowards fear her, and Fools her daily Favourites Adore her—For my Part, Love and Friendship shall still be the Darlings of my Soul—And new Pleasures,
<PB N="3" REF="80"/>
the continual Business of my Life—But prithee what sort of Company have you here in <HI>Valen∣cia—</HI>For tho' I am Returning to <HI>England,</HI> I am so tir'd with Politicks, that I perfectly Nauseate the Conversation of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so? Is there no other to be had then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>None! Politicians start out of every Profession, and <HI>Stock-jobbers-</HI>Lies, are the only Discourse one can meet with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope the Beaus don't turn Politici∣ans in any Nation—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Beaus! Why the very Women are turn'd Politicians—In short, the Gossiping of the Tea-Table is as much Infected, as the Society of the Coffee-Houses—How are you at this Part of the Globe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are like the rest of the World.—Here are all Manner of Characters—Husbands that are Jealous of their Honour, and Wives that as Craftily betray it—For the Ladies—Here's a Composition of all Nations—Some boast the Affectation of the <HI>French;</HI> some their own natu∣ral <HI>Spanish</HI> Pride; and others the Beauty and Ob∣stinacy of your <HI>English</HI> Women—Then for the Men, here are from the formal Grandees, to the extravagant Fops; and from the Cavaliers of Qua∣lity, to the very Fortune-Hunters—In short, here are all Degrees whatsoever—Some of 'em rely upon the Merit of their Riches, and others upon that of their Assurance—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Assurance is the most thriving Vertue of the Age. 'Tis a Fortune for a Courtier; and a prevailing Eloquence in a Lover—But a∣mongst the rest, What sort of a Man is your Go∣vernour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="90"/>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Man of Quality, and one whose in∣nate Worth, is an Honour to the Office he bears—Now I think on't, he may be of Service to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, prithee which way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has a Daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is she very Handsome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beautiful as an Angel, and then for her Wit, 'tis as Inchanting, as her Beauty, her Repartees are as Quick as her Eyes, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when shall I see her <HI>Don Philip?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's to be my Wife—For which purpose I am come here to <HI>Valencia.—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>How coud'st thou be so Ill-natur'd now, to raise my fancy to such a Pitch for this? What Service can it be to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not design to help you to a Mi∣stress Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I only had a Mind to let you know my Interest with the Governour, and I hope to win him to Intercede for your Pardon, and to wink at your Security here.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! you are ever Obliging <HI>Don Philip.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a Trifle amongst Friends—I remember in <HI>England,</HI> when I was Oppress'd by odds, you sav'd my Life with hazard of your own—Here I run no Risque in the Preservati∣on of yours—But how d'ye intend to spend the Day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have an Assignation, but the Time is not yet expir'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the mean Time what say you to a Glass of good Wine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart—For 'tis still my Opinion, that next to the Chat of a Lady at her Tea-Table, there's no Pleasure like the Society of a Friend over a Bottle.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh you are ever pleasant <HI>Sir Charles.—</HI>But ha! Who comes here?</P>

<P>News! Sir, if I had accomplish'd my Ends, I cou'd have brought you News and Success enough to make your Heart leap up to your Mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye Sirrah don't trifle, my Time's too precious, by repeating what you only fancy you cou'd have done; but tell me what Success you have had in Reality.—Did you dog the Lady as I order'd you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dog the Lady! Aye Sir, I have dog'd her to some Purpose! Well, I'll say no more, but if Expedition and Conduct can make a Statesman, <HI>Aspin</HI> may in time come to be distinguish'd by a Title.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I can scarce doubt of your Suc∣cess, for I know thou art an excellent Setter up∣on Occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and a Runner too, as you'll find by the Sequel of the Story—Look ye Sir, you may remember you order'd me to Watch the La∣dy Home, I obey'd your Commands, but She perceiving my Employment, led me thro' the Mazes of several blind Alleys; notwithstanding which, like an experienc'd Instrument of the Game, I still kept as close a Scent after her, as a Hound after her Coney.</P>

<P>Hous'd her! No Sir, I han't Hous'd her!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Sirrah! Then what's the End of all this mighty Performance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing at all Sir!—In short, there fell out an unlucky Accident, for as I was hot in the Pursuit, I happen'd to stumble upon a Pebble, sprain'd my Ancle, and lost the Sight of her in a Moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now Sirrah, wou'd I break your Bones for this Disappointment, but that I have other Affairs in Hand—Mark me, I am now going to Drink a Bottle with a Friend, in an Hour I am to meet the Lady at my Lodging; and if you don't look better to your Post, I'll break that Rascally Head of yours Sirrah.</P>

<P>'Tis the Nature of the Climate, Madam, as in <HI>France</HI> the Coquet is rather Admired for her Airs, then Censur'd for her Inclinations. Not but there's detraction in both Climates, but there 'tis a pleasure peculiar to the Women, where
<PB N="10" REF="150"/>
Scandal passes for Wit, and one Beauty rises on the falling Reputation of another. The Men un∣less the Beaus, having nothing to do with it; and those no farther, then a little Raillery for their Diversion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd be as free as they had I the Power—For I have chose a Person of my own Liking, and my Father has Contracted me to one that is indifferent to me. Now methinks there's such a pleasure in the Disobedience, that it adds an Elo∣quence to the Suit of a Lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Madam, d'ye Consider that the Nature of this Country is Revenge—Here is none of the Careless Brother, the Indulgent Father, nor the meek Animal, a Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis want of Courage in our Lovers to put a good Custom in practice, otherwise the Jealous fury of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Don might in time be moderated to the Content of a <HI>London</HI> Citizen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Madam, you have not so much reason to Complain—Is not <HI>Don Philip,</HI> your intend∣ed Husband, a Noble <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and as Agreeable as the <HI>English</HI> Cavalier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh what a hideous Comparison have you made! the <HI>English</HI> Cavalier! Is he not all that a Woman can wish for? A Man of Gallantry—Beautiful in his Person, and agreeable in his Con∣versation? are not all the Perswasive Charms of Wit upon his Tongue? Is he not in short, an <HI>Englishman.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not <HI>Don Philip</HI> a Man of Honour? of a Gallant Disposition—And then he loves you as well as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but then he is to be my Husband, <HI>Flora;</HI> and the Prospect of a forc'd Marriage E∣clipses the Worth of a Suitor—Besides my Mo∣ther was an <HI>English</HI> Woman—Therefore I am of so Gay a Temper, and so naturally Fond of Li∣berty,
<PB N="11" REF="160"/>
that I can never be confin'd to the Hu∣mours of a jealous <HI>Spaniard.—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am convinc'd, Madam, by your Incli∣nations to the <HI>English</HI> Cavalier; that Beauty is totally owing to Fancy—But how came you Acquainted with him at first?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you—You know when my Fa∣ther sent for me to <HI>Valencia,</HI> the People after my Arrival crowded to see me—I was admir'd by the Men, and envy'd by the Women—When I appear'd at Church, all were in a Consternation—Whispering, this is the Governour's Daughter—Till contrary to my Sex, I was almost tir'd with Vanity itself—One Day I went VEIL'D into the Walks to Divert my self—There I thought I saw my Father, but afterwards it prov'd otherwise—Then I flew into a Summer House to avoid him—Where I met this Stranger, who seeing me in Distress, proffer'd his Assistance—I was pleas'd with the Complement, and lik'd both his Conversation and his Person—He press'd to know me, but I refus'd it—How∣ever, I have often seen him since, and must in short according to Appointment, meet him instant∣ly agen.—</P>

<P>That Task is left for me—Which I shall tell you in a few Words—I am the Daughter of a Nobleman, whose Name in Re∣spect to him, I Conceal—I Lov'd unknown to him, an <HI>English</HI> Cavalier—For whom as I was Waiting one Night at the Garden Gate, a∣nother whom I slighted rush'd in with him.</P>

<P>That's more than I may Chance to do, if you are so Complaisant, as to mean me by the Comparison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you may Chance to do! I am very glad Madam, that you are so Dubious as to leave it to Chance. 'Tis possible you may Chance to be Cruel, but I hope that the Proba∣bility is to the contrary.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>The probability depends indeed upon your Hope—And Lovers Hopes are at best but Shadows of Thought, that produce no Reality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, you are pleas'd to be Witty, and I admire you for it—But the Sight of you wou'd make me your perfect Adorer.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>D'ye think there's no true Love without seeing the Object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>How d'ye think a blind Man can be sen∣sible of the Passion, if he did not depend on his Imagination. Now perhaps were you to see me, you'd no longer Admire me, therefore, I think you had best remain as you are.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, I forbid that Madam—A blind Man can never hope to see the Object of his Af∣fections, and therefore can never expect to satis∣fie his Curiosity—But Sight was given me to make use of—And shou'd I be so Contented, I shou'd suffer you to Blind my Reason, as well as my Eyes.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you be a Lover, and pretend to the use of Reason—That's a Contradiction in itself.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least—'Tis a ranging un∣settled Passion that's a Contradiction to good Sense—But Love and Reason are Inseparable like Wit and Judgment—For as one is fond of the Beauty, the other distinguishes the Value of the Blessing, and therefore knows how to Prize it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="210"/>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding your Rhetorick, they are an Objection to each other—For according to the Dictates of Love, I ought to grant your De∣sires, and let you see me—But shou'd I now follow the Maxims of Reason, I shou'd remain in a Cloud as I am—And here break off our Correspondence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I deny—For as Love has Prompted you thus far, Reason will shew you 'tis too late now to retire, therefore you see that every Argument you raise, is an Objection to your Cruelty—Besides, when we parted last, You promised I should see You—And I hope You will be as good as your Word now.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, that proceeds from the Wildness of his Youth—We are all Subject to such Faults—Sir <HI>Charles</HI> is what we Esteem a fine Gentleman, and the <HI>English</HI> are all Men of Gallantry and Intrigue—Besides, if a young Lady is inclinable to be kind, what brisk Ca∣valier can refuse her Favours?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a Satisfaction that every Lover can give, because 'tis a Pleasure to him—But your Death wou'd have Chronicled my Fame in Ro∣mance, to have been read by young Virgins in

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lookee Madam, I am not so Roman∣tick as to Die for the sake of being read in a Novel, to divert Girls in the Green-Sickness—My intention is to Live for the End I was Crea∣ted, to propagate my Generation—Therefore as I am a Prisoner upon Parole, and must return by break of Day to the Castle; let us reap the Advantages of Love, Night, and Opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A fine Speech indeed, you are like the Atheist, all for Pleasures at the present, and ne∣ver have a Thought of Futurity—I expected you wou'd have prov'd a <HI>Paris,</HI> at least—That is, have proffer'd to have carry'd me to a safe Ar∣bour, and there to have given your self up for Life, as a personal Security for your Love.—</P>

<P>For Life too much resembles Marri∣age, which is the disagreeable part of Love—Besides, my Honour's engag'd for my Return.—</P>

<P>Very well Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I see you are too Inconstant to be Trusted—For now by your own Confession, shou'd you see another, I must yield your Heart to her Beauty, because you may chance to think it Superior to mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Madam, That's impossible—For the Charms of your Wit so Conspire with those of your Beauty, that they must fix ev'n Inconstan∣cy itself.</P>

<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Arguments can I then use to Convince you of my Affections?</P>

<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was never so provok'd in my Life, as I was at <HI>Don Philip</HI>'s Jealousies, and all this I under∣go for a Person that I'm not secure of—For as <HI>Fidelia</HI> was the first Object of <HI>Sir Charles</HI>'s Affe∣ctions, she'll still be the Mistress of his Heart—And Possession there, as in the Law, will make her Eleven Points before me.</P>

<P>I am of the same Opinion—But what shall I do in this Affair?</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lorenzo, <HI>and</HI> Alonzo.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY old Friend, once more I Congra∣tulate your Arrival to <HI>Valencia—</HI>You are come in good time to Vindicate the Hon∣our of your Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come in a good Time say you! No, I am come in a very ill Time, I can't so much as thank you for your Civility—Harkee! Prithee look in my Face now! Am not I very much alter'd? Have not I something very rueful in my Coun∣tenance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>What makes you Fancy so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because methinks I am no better than a <HI>Raven,</HI> I can croak nothing but bad News.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, be Chearful; all will go well again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes truly! All is like to go mighty well indeed—My Son-in-Law, that was to be, has been desperately Wounded, my Daughter's run a∣way, and my Family's Disgraced for ever, and you expect me to be Chearful do you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but hear Reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="60" REF="650"/>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but I won't hear Reason! What have I to do with Reason, when I come in search of Revenge?—You say you have 'em both in your Custody!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose I have! You tell me the wounded Cavalier is Recovered, then what pretence can I have of detaining Sir <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter! I'll conceal his Recovery, and have the Dog suffer for his Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fye! I am asham'd to see your Passion so overcome your Reason—Suppose your Daughter loves him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loves him! 'Sdeath who doubts but she does Love him! What, because the silly Baggage has been so weak as to suffer him to Ruin her, you would have me play the old Dotard, and be as great a Fool as my Daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still you Mistake me—Why will you endeavour thus to widen the Breach, when I wou'd bring Matters to a Reconciliation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>To a Reconciliation! Ha, ha, ha, this is pleasant indeed!—The Son of a Whore has Stole away my Daughter, and for ought I know she may have her Belly up to her Mouth, and you talk of bringing Matters to a Reconciliation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose she shou'd Love him, and he shou'd have an equal Passion for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then my Curse be an equal Portion for them both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps he wou'd Consent to Marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry her! No, no, no! The young Fellows of this Age are not such Fools as to De∣bauch Women, and afterwards to Marry 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but I know what it is to be a young Fellow! I tell you their Vows always Dissolve
<PB N="61" REF="660"/>
with Virginities, and when the Fort's Surrender'd, all former Promises are void o'course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are indeed too many of the Fair Sex in that unhappy Condition, but why shou'd you judge so hardly of your Daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why shou'd I not judge so? Did she not run away with him? Has she not a Sanguine Com∣plection, and he a brawny Back? Is she not a promising Girl, and he a sprightly young Fellow?—Then why may not my Daughter happen to be with Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still you perplex your Self with fancied Injuries only—Was she ever loose in her Behavi∣our?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I always believ'd her to be a very modest Girl: But now she has certainly tasted of the Tree of Knowledge—He has open'd her Senses, and enter'd her into her Rudiments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever Love your Daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, too well; tho' indeed she was a ve∣ry good Girl, and deserv'd it—Nay, now I think of her, the Tears of Affection still come into my Eyes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indulge that Tenderness, and Reason will come o'Course—D'ye think I am your Friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shou'd I know that? We were Friends once indeed—That is, when we were Young—Then we us'd to drink our Bottle toge∣ther, ruin'd as many Girls, and made as many Cuckolds as any Rakehells in <HI>Europe—</HI>But now the Scene is Chang'd, you are my Lord Governour: Time, Absence, and State Affairs may have drove me out of your Memory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, you shall see I am still your Friend, have Patience, and I'll endeavour to bring all to a right Understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="62" REF="670"/>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, suppress your Choler, 'till you see whether you have Reason for it—I'll now imme∣diately go and propose an honourable Treaty to Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> in the mean time I beg you to re∣tire, and not see your Daughter 'till I return to tell you my Success.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Return will bring me a fine Account of Success indeed—We Men are certainly most unhappy Wretches—When we are young, we get Children in the Heat of our Blood, who when we come to be Old, grow Disobedient, and break our Hearts in order to get into our Estates—Well, I'll say no more, but I'll send this rebel Daughter of mine to a Nunnery, and there she shall mortify for the Sins of the Flesh—But for that Rogue that has Debauch'd her, if ever I see him again, I'll have his Blood tho' I meet him in a Sanctuary.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> Charles Winlove, <HI>and</HI> Don Phillip.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I am now Convinc'd of your Innocence—My Suspicions were the fond, Errors of my Love, and as such I hope you'll E∣steem 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do When I consider that jealous Eyes always see thro' a Microscope, that magnifies the meanest Trifles, to seem as of the greatest Conse∣quence—But had you not been my Friend, I shou'd not so tamely have submitted to such U∣sage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own the Rashness of my Folly to be great—Let Fools have the Obstinacy to per∣sist in their Errors—A generous Soul esteems it
<PB N="63" REF="680"/>
rather as a Point of Honour; when Convinc'd, to acknowledge 'em—Therefore now let us turn the Discourse—I'll assure you Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I think the Captive is very Beautiful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beautiful as ever I saw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But still methinks my Lady excels her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every Lover is apt to think his own Mistress the most deserving—Mine has Wit as well as Beauty, and where the Lusciousness of one may Cloy the Appetite, the other Whets it agen, and makes all her Charms as agreeable as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wit and Beauty are two irresistable Weapons indeed; but I find you are in a fair Way to succeed in your Hopes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Faith—Notwithstanding she has so many Perfections, my Success was but very indifferent, whether the Inconstant Star that Go∣verns the Sex rul'd, I know not; but my Recep∣tion prov'd as great a Disappointment, as the Ac∣cident afterwards did a Surprise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that was a meer Feint only to make a Tryal of your Love, I find you are not rightly acquainted with the Variety of a Lady's Humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor ever shall, if 'tis so much ad∣dicted to Whimsey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a Lover shou'd make it his Busi∣ness first to find the Temper of his Mistress, and then to study every Method that may promote her Pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am not so much a Lover as to submit my Reason to Frenzy—For to study the Temper of a Woman, is like searching out for the Philosopher's Stone—A Man may spend his Estate, run Mad, and grow never the Wiser.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="690"/>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding your harsh Censure of the Sex, I wish I knew the Humour of my La∣dy so far as to gain Remission for my Folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, this is ever the Consequence of Jealousy—First you Quarrel with your Mistress for no Reason, and then are never easy till you're Reconcil'd</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it is a Weakness indeed! but a <HI>Spaniard</HI> is so Unfortunate in his Passions, that he can no more avoid the rashness of Jealousy, than he can expel the heat of his Climate—But what Service Sir <HI>Charles</HI> can I do you now in your A∣mour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then once more to trust you as a Friend, I have this Day receiv'd a Letter from the Lady—But sure there are such Beauties in the Style, not <HI>Ovid</HI> is more soft, nor <HI>Horace</HI> more Satyrical.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are the Contents of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a kind Invitation to another Ap∣pointment; but Interspers'd with Reflections from an excellent Talent of Wit in Relation to my Servant's Carelessness—Here, prithee read it—And give me your Opinion.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Aspin.</STAGE>
<P>So! Where have you been Sirrah?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have run thro' as dangerous Adven∣tures as a Knight-Errant—But as I was Pre∣destinated to Act the Part of a Champion, I was prepar'd with Armour accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were you so? Prithee let's hear the wonderful Description of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir, Courage was the Support of my Back; Caution the Defence of my Breast; Wit was
<PB N="65" REF="700"/>
my noble Head-piece; and this Pistol the Weapon with which I encounter'd Death and Destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Pistol Sirrah! What occasion had you last Night to make it give such an Alarm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir, I was Assaulted by no less than a fiery Dragon—In short, a great Mastiff flew at my Throat, and had I not had the Courage to have Encounter'd his Fury, I had certainly been torn in Pieces.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then Sir <HI>Charles</HI> you must never be Angry with him for his Valour<HI>—Aspin</HI> has now rival'd the Fame of St. <HI>George—</HI>And I think his Statue ought to be set up in Memory of this Atchievement, as a second Honour to your Country.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is past was but a Tryal for the Cour∣age of a Hero—But the next Misfortune I fell into, requir'd the deepest Policy of a Statesman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! prithee what was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was this Morning discover'd by some of the Servants, and carry'd <HI>Viet Armis</HI> a Prisoner before my Lord Governour.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! How came you off there, <HI>Aspin?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Sir, I brought my self off with a wet Finger—First, the Governour ask'd me several Questions—I generously told him the Affair you had last Night with the Lady—Confession me∣rited Mercy, and I was immediately Discharg'd like a Man of Honour.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were you so, Sirrah? Know then Ras∣cal, you have Discover'd all my Designs, and I'll this Moment make an Example of you.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold Sir <HI>Charles—</HI>Consider, his Folly is below your Resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have scarce Patience to suffer the Dog in my Sight—Rascal, deceitful Villain!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="66" REF="710"/>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this the Return for all the Dangers I have suffer'd—Well, 'tis an ungrateful Age—But I am not the first Man of Merit that has been slighted after his faithful Service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, be pacify'd Sir <HI>Charles—</HI>All may be easily brought off agen—Here, take your Letter, I have Read it, and approve of the Design—But have you prepar'd any Place for your Appointment with the Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, as to that Part I believe I must rely upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I can help you at a dead Lift—My Appartment has a Door into another Street—Order her to be carry'd the back Way, and as she's a Stranger to the Place, she may be easily deceiv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like the Proposal well<HI>—Aspin,</HI> go you this Moment and conduct 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Asp.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, tho' we Men of Merit are so barba∣rously us'd, we are always wanted in a Case of Necessity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sirrah, no prating; mind what I say and go out of my Sight.</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> Aspin.</STAGE>
<P>Now which way shall I obtain my Liberty for this Adventure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I'll gain you that Freedom—and that you may the better by Daylight pass un∣known, I'll send you my Cloak, and you shall muffle your self in that—Ha! The Governour! What means this?</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lorenzo.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don Philip,</HI> I see your Friendship is not like that of the World, a meer Counterfeit Pro∣fession—for you endeavour to serve the Person you Value, tho' you see him loaded with Affli∣ction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="720"/>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, Friendship is only shew'd in Adversity, a Man in Prosperity has abundance of Professors—But had he need of one, not a Friend amongst 'em all.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Friendship is mutual—Sir <HI>Charles</HI> sav'd your Life, and you'd now Return it with the Preservation of his—So that you both are Exceptions from the general Rule of the World, for there's scarce a Person in it besides your selves, can say I have a Friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the reverse of Friendship is the Product of a degenerate Age; where Honesty passes for Folly; Perfidiousness for good Policy; and all manner of Knavery, for necessary Wis∣dom to thrive in the World—So that a Man can no more be assur'd of Friends in Adversity, than a King or Country in Distress—When those that shou'd be so, enrich themselves in their Destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a young Stoick indeed Sir <HI>Charles—</HI>However, I come now to stand your Friend, for want of Pity in your Case, wou'd be down-right Cruelty—And therefore give me leave to make some Proposals that may be to your Satisfaction<HI>—Don Philip,</HI> I hope you'll excuse me a little.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I take my leave. Harkee Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> What shall I do in this Af∣fair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go and detain the Lady till I come, and d'ye hear, leave Orders with the Keeper for my Freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear—I'll manage all to the best Advantage.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have this Morning receiv'd Advice of the Cavalier's Recovery, that was thought to have been Kill'd—This I must yet keep as a Secret, till I have brought Matters to bear.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="68" REF="730"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now my Lord, if you please, I am ready to receive your Proposals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir Charles,</HI> I am come to you concerning an Affair of Consequence—You must know, <HI>Alonzo,</HI> the Father of <HI>Fidelia,</HI> and I, when young, were never separated from each other—Now I understand by a Letter from <HI>Madrid,</HI> you have lately depriv'd him of his Daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! Depriv'd him of her, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but methinks I would willingly heal this Breach—Therefore I'd advise you to find some means, by which you might reconcile your self to him, and restore the Honour of the young Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I understand you not—'Tis true I love <HI>Fidelia</HI> as my Life; but for her Hon∣our, it is not in the least forfeited on my Ac∣count.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Father is of a quite contrary Opini∣on—Therefore, if you have either a Value for your Self, or an Affection for the young Lady, you will consent to those means, that will Contri∣bute to her Ease, as well as to your own Se∣curity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I own the Wildness of my Youth But I have so true an Affection for <HI>Fidelia,</HI> that for my Security, I prize it not in Comparison with her Content.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> you begin to Guess at my meaning—Therefore I Question not but to find you the Man of Honour, I was apt at first Sight to believe you—Her Fame upon your Account is very much become the Discourse of the World—Therefore to reconcile all, wou'd you be willing to accept her for a Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I needed not this Prepara∣tion to Embrace such welcome Proposals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="740"/>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consent to that, and I'll engage your Pardon shall be secur'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Life is of as little Value to me now, as when I ran the Risque of forfeiting it for her—But for the looser Wishes that my In∣constancy has been guilty of (Cou'd I be so hap∣py to see her) they wou'd immediately Vanish at her Sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know then Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> the Lady is still in <HI>Valencia.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! In <HI>Valencia,</HI> my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has remain'd in Confinement at my House, ever since I Yesterday Siez'd her at your Lodgings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then there is a Mistake in this—The Lady that was taken with me I can assure you is not <HI>Fidelia.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Father's Servant cou'd not be mista∣ken, and he afterwards saw her at my House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know her Face too well to be de∣ceiv'd—The Lady that was taken with me I was a Stranger to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a pretty Contrivance indeed—In the first place the young Lady owns her self to be <HI>Fidelia,</HI> but at the same time denies a Corres∣pondence with you—And now you own a Cor∣respondence with her, but deny she is the Per∣son—Who was it then that you had an Assig∣nation with last Night at my House?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you have made a Discovery in that Affair, 'twas with the Lady that was siez'd with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that Lady you positively say is not <HI>Fidelia.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do my Lord, and if I am in my Senses, I am sure I can affirm it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="750"/>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now she actually says she is—But denies that she has either seen you, or had any Discourse with you in <HI>Valencia.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then there is a farther Mystery in this! I am certain the Lady I met last Night was not <HI>Fidelia—</HI>Now if the Person you mean, that denies all this, shou'd prove to be her, then your Lordship is mistaken, for she can't be the same that was seiz'd with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, there has been no Art Magick to Transform her, nor to change one Person to ano∣ther.—Therefore depend on't, she's the same—Now the Messenger from her Father went away satisfy'd, she was the right, and she upon Exami∣nation own'd herself to be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>This makes it all seem more Intricate still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come with me and let your Sight Con∣vince you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this he'll discover the Lady is gone Abroad, in order to meet me—What can I do? I must submit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come along then <HI>Sir Charles—</HI>Methinks I am impatient to have this Riddle explain'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I the like my Lord—For I am sure as the Story lies now, there is so great a My∣stery in it, 'tis beyond the Power of a Churchman to unfold it, till we see farther.</P>

<P>Seeing this Lady in your Apartment Sir, I came to keep her Company till you cou'd come according to your Assignation.</P>

<P>Say rather Madam, that you came to meet Sir <HI>Charles Winlove—</HI>That this Lady is the Confederate of your Falshood, and that you have mistaken this Apartment for another.</P>

<P>How <HI>Don Philip!</HI> I never saw such Assu∣rance in my Life.</P>

<P>Ha! Then I have been too rash indeed—I find now that this is the Lady I look'd for, and Jealousy has brought <HI>Leonora</HI> hither.</P>

<P>So! His Countenance tells me he begins to soften to my Wish—I see her Stratagem has took.</P>

<P>What shall I say to her? Madam, I find already I have been in an Error in my Suspi∣cions, but not in being false my self.</P>

<P>So! Now you see your Assurance won't take, you'd endeavour to conceal your Falshood.</P>

<L>Take care good People of the Words you say!</L>
<L>For if I like 'em not, I shall Abuse you!</L>

<L>What did our Author then intend to do?</L>
<L>I must Confess, I'm angry at th' Abuse—</L>
<L>To send me here, to make his Play's excuse!</L>
<L>Why, what a piece of Folly has he shown?</L>
<L>He shou'd consider I'm not yet full Grown!</L>
<L>If I had reach'd my Teens, or something nigh,</L>
<L>I shou'd have been well pleas'd my Strength to try!</L>
