<P>LETTERS
OF
Mr. <HI>POPE,</HI>
AND
Several Eminent PERSONS,
From the YEAR 1705, to 1711.</P>
<P>VOL. I.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>WE presume we want no Apology to
the Reader for this Publication,
but some may be thought needful
to Mr. <HI>Pope:</HI> However he cannot think our
Offence so great as Theirs, who first separately
published, what we have here but collected in a
better Form and Order. As for the Letters we
have procur'd to be added, they serve but to
compleat, explain, and sometimes set in a true
light, those others, which it was not in the
Writer's or Our power to recall.</P>
<P>The Letters to Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> were pro∣cured
some Years since, on account of a sur∣reptitious
Edition of his Posthumous Works:
As those Letters shewed the true state of that
Case, the Publication of them was doing the
best Justice to the Memory of Mr. <HI>Wycher∣ley.</HI></P>
<P>The rest of this Collection hath been owing
to several Cabinets; some drawn from thence
by Accidents, and others (even of those to
Ladies) voluntarily given. It is to one of
that Sex we are beholden for the whole Cor∣respondence
with <HI>H. C.</HI> Es{que} which Letters
<PB REF="3"/>
being lent her by that Gentleman, she took
the liberty to print; as appears by the fol∣lowing,
which we shall give at length, both
as it is something Curious, and as it may serve
for an Apology for ourselves.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><HI>To</HI> HENRY CROMWELL, <HI>Es{que}</HI>
<DATE>June 27, 1727.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER so long a silence, as the ma∣ny
and great oppressions I have sigh'd
under has occasion'd, one is at a loss how
to begin a letter to so kind a friend as your
self. But as it was always my resolution,
if I must sink, to do it as decently [that
is, as silently] as I could: so when I found
my self plung'd into unforeseen, and una∣voidable
ruin, I retreated from the world,
and in a manner buried my self in a dis∣mal
place, where I knew none, nor none
knew me. In this dull unthinking way, I
have protracted a lingring death [for life
it cannot be call'd] ever since you saw me,
sequester'd from company, depriv'd of my
books, and nothing left to converse with
but the Letters of my dead, or absent friends,
amongst which latter I always plac'd yours,
and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s in the first rank. I lent
<PB REF="4"/>
some of them indeed to an ingenious per∣son,
who was so delighted with the speci∣men,
that he importuned me for a sight
of the rest, which having obtained, he
convey'd them to the Press, I must not say
altogether with my consent, nor wholly
without it. I thought them too good to
be lost in oblivion, and had no cause to
apprehend the disobliging of any. The
publick, <HI>viz.</HI> all persons of taste and judg∣ment,
wou'd be pleas'd with so agreeable
an Amusement; Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> cou'd not be
angry, since it was but justice to his merit,
to publish the solemn, and private profes∣sions
of Love, Gratitude, and Veneration,
made him by so celebrated an Author; and
surely Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ought not to resent the
publication, since the early pregnancy of
his Genius was no dishonour to his chara∣cter.
And yet had either of you been ask'd,
common modesty wou'd have oblig'd you
to refuse, what you wou'd not be displeas'd
with, if done without your knowledge:
And besides to end all dispute, you had been
pleas'd to make me a free gift of them, to
do what I pleas'd with them: and every
one knows that the person to whom a Let∣ter
is address'd, has the same right to dis∣pose
of it, as he has of goods purchas'd
with his money. I doubt not but your
generosity and honour will do me the
<PB REF="5"/>
right, of owning by a line, that I came
honestly by them. I flatter my self, in a
few months I shall again be visible to the
world, and whenever thro' good providence
that Turn shall happen, I shall joyfully ac∣quaint
you with it, there being none more
truly your oblig'd Servant, than, <HI>Sir,</HI></P>

most humble Servant,

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Mr. <HI>POPE.</HI>
<DATE>Epsom, July 6th, 1727.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN these Letters were first print∣ed,
I wond'red how <HI>Curll</HI> cou'd
come by 'em, and cou'd not but laugh at
the pompous title; since whatever you
wrote to me was humour, and familiar
Raillery. As soon as I came from <HI>Epsom,</HI> I
<PB REF="6"/>
heard you had been to see me, and I writ
you a short letter from <HI>Will</HI>'s, that I
long'd to see you. Mr. <HI>D</HI>—<HI>s,</HI> about that
time, charg'd me, with giving 'em to a
Mistress, which I positively denied; not in
the least, at that time, thinking of it: but
sometime after, finding in the news-papers
Letters from Lady <HI>Packington,</HI> Lady <HI>Chud∣leigh,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Norris,</HI> to the same <HI>Sapho</HI>
or <HI>E. T.</HI> I began to fear that I was guilty.
I have never seen these Letters of <HI>Curll</HI>'s,
nor would go to his shop about 'em; I have
not seen this <HI>Sapho,</HI> alias <HI>E. T.</HI> these seven
years;—her writing, <HI>That I gave her
'em, to do what she wou'd with 'em,</HI> is strain∣ing
the point too far: I thought not of it;
nor do I think she did then: But severe
Necessity, which catches hold of a Twig,
has produc'd all this; which has lain hid,
and forgot by me, so many years. <HI>Curll</HI>
sent me a Letter last week, desiring a po∣sitive
answer about this matter, but find∣ing
I wou'd give him none, he went to
<HI>E. T.</HI> and writ a Postscript, in her long
romantick Letter, to direct my Answer to
his house, but they not expecting an An∣swer,
sent a young man to me, whose
name, it seems, is <HI>Pattisson:</HI> I told him I
should not write any thing, but I believ'd
it might be so, as she writ in her Letter.
I am extremely concern'd, that my former
<PB REF="7"/>
Indiscretion in putting 'em into the hands
of this <HI>Pretieuse,</HI> shou'd have given you so
much disturbance; for the last thing I
shou'd do wou'd be to disoblige you; for
whom I have ever preserv'd the greatest
esteem, and shall ever be, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER>Your faithful Friend, and
most humble Servant,
<SIGNED>HENRY CROMWELL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Mr. <HI>POPE.</HI>
<DATE>August 1, 1727.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I writ my long Narrative from
<HI>Epsom</HI> till I was tir'd, yet was I not
satisfied; left any doubt shou'd rest upon
your mind. I cou'd not make protestations
of my Innocence of a grievous crime; but
I was impatient till I came to Town, that
I might send you those Letters, as a clear
evidence, that I was a perfect stranger to
all their proceeding: Shou'd I have pro∣tested
against it, after the printing, it might
have been taken for an attempt to decry
<PB REF="8"/>
his purchase; and as the little exception you
have taken, has serv'd him to play his game
upon us, for these two years; a new inci∣dent
from me might enable him to play
it on for two more:—The great value
she expresses for all you write, and her
passion for having 'em, I believe, was what
prevail'd upon me to let her keep 'em.
By the interval of twelve years at least,
from her possession to the time of printing
'em, 'tis manifest, that I had not the least
ground to apprehend such a design: But as
people in great straits, bring forth their
hoards of old Gold, and most valued Jew∣els,
so <HI>Sapho</HI> had recourse to her hid trea∣sure
of Letters, and play'd off, not only
yours to me, but all those to herself (as the
Lady's last-stake) into the Press.—As
for me, I hope, when you shall cooly con∣sider
the many thousand instances of our
being deluded by the Females, since that
great Original of <HI>Adam</HI> by <HI>Eve,</HI> you will
have a more favourable thought of the
undesigning error of</P>
<CLOSER>Your faithful Friend,
and humble Servant,
<SIGNED>HENRY CROMWELL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB REF="9"/>
Now, should our Apology for this Publica∣tion
be as ill receiv'd, as the Lady's seems to
have been by the Gentlemen concerned; we
shall at least have <HI>Her Comfort</HI> of being
Thank'd by the rest of the world. Nor has
Mr. <HI>P.</HI> himself any great cause to think it
much Offence to his Modesty, or Reflexion on
his Judgment; when we take care to inform
the publick, that there are few Letters of his
in this Collection which were not written un∣der
Twenty years of age: On the other hand,
we doubt not the Reader will be much more
surpriz'd to find, at that early period, so
much Variety of Style, Affecting Sentiment,
and Justness of Criticism, in pieces which
must have been writ in haste, very few per∣haps
ever re-view'd, and none intended for
the Eye of the Publick.</P>

<HEAD>LETTERS
OF
Mr. Wycherley and Mr. Pope,
From the Year 1704 to 1710.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author's Age then Sixteen.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>POPE</HI> to Mr. <HI>WYCHERLEY.</HI>
<DATE>Decemb. 26, 1704.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT was certainly a great Satisfaction to
me to see and converse with a Man,
whom in his Writings I had so long
known with Pleasure: But it was a high
addition to it, to hear you, at our very
first meeting, doing justice to your dead
friend Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> I was not so happy as
to know him; <HI>Virgilium tantum vidi</HI>—
Had I been born early enough, I must have
known and lov'd him: For I have been
assur'd, not only by your self, but by Mr.
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
<HI>Congreve</HI> and Sir <HI>William Trumbul,</HI> that his
personal Qualities were as amiable as his
Poetical, notwithstanding the many libel∣ous
Misrepresentations of them (against
which the former of these Gentlemen has
told me he will one day vindicate him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">He since did so, in his Dedication to the Duke of New∣castle, prefix'd to <HI>Tonson</HI>'s <HI>Duodecimo</HI> Edition of Dryden'<HI>s</HI> Plays. 1717.</NOTE>
I suppose those Injuries were begun by the
Violence of Party, but 'tis no doubt they
were continu'd by Envy at his success and
same: And those Scribblers who attack'd
him in his latter times, were only like
Gnats in a Summer's evening, which are
never very troublesome but in the finest
and most glorious Season; (for his fire, like
the Sun's, shin'd clearest towards its set∣ting.)</P>
<P>You must not therefore imagine, that
when you told me of my own perfor∣mances
that they were above those Cri∣tics,
I was so vain as to believe it; and
yet I may not be so humble as to think my
self quite below their notice. For Critics,
as they are Birds of Prey, have ever a na∣tural
inclination to Carrion: And though
such poor Writers as I, are but Beggars,
however no Beggar is so poor but he can
keep a Cur, and no Author is so beggarly
but he can keep a Critic. So I'm far from
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
thinking the Attack of such people either
an honour or dishonour, even to me,
much less to Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> I think with you,
that whatever lesser Wits have risen since
his Death, are but like Stars appearing
when the Sun is set, that twinkle only in
his absence, and with the Rays they have
borrowed from him. Our Wit (as you
call it) is but Reflexion or Imitation, there∣fore
scarce to be call'd ours. True Wit I
believe, may be defin'd a Justness of Thought,
and a Facility of Expression; or in the
Midwives phrase) a perfect Conception,
with an easy Delivery. However this is far
from a compleat definition; pray help me to
a better, as I doubt not you can.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mr. <HI>WYCHERLEY</HI> to Mr. <HI>POPE.</HI>
<DATE>Jan. 1704-5.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been so busy of late in cor∣recting
and transcribing some of my
Madrigals, for a great Man or two, who
desir'd to see them, that I have (with your
Pardon) omitted to return you an Answer
to your most ingenious Letter: So Scrib∣blers
to the Publick, like Bankers to the Pub∣lick,
are profuse in their voluntary Loans
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
to it, whilst they forget to pay their more
private and particular, as more just Debts,
to their best and nearest Friends. How∣ever,
I hope, you who have as much good
Nature as good Sense, (since they gene∣rally
are Companions) will have Patience
with a Debtor, who you think has an In∣clination
to pay you his Obligations, if
he had wherewithal ready about him; and
in the mean time should consider, when
you have oblig'd me beyond my present
Power of returning the Favour, that a
Debtor may be an honest Man, if he but
intends to be just when he is able, tho'
late. But I should be less just to you,
the more I thought I could make a Re∣turn
to so much Profuseness of Wit and
Humanity together; which tho' they sel∣dom
accompany each other, in other Men,
are in you so equally met, I know not in
which you most abound. But so much
for my Opinion of you, which is, that
your Wit and Ingenuity is equal'd by no∣thing
but your Judgment, or Modesty;
which (though it be to please my self) I
muft no more offend, than I can do either
right.</P>
<P>Therefore I will say no more now of
them, than that your good Wit ne'er for∣feited
your good Judgment, but in your
Partiality to me and mine; so that if it
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
were possible for a harden'd Scribbler to be
vainer than he is, what you write of me
would make me more conceited, than what
I scribble my self; yet I must confess I
ought to be more humbled by your Praise
than exalted; which commends my little
Sense with so much more of yours, that I
am disparag'd and dishearten'd by your com∣mendations;
who give me an Example of
your Wit in the first Part of your Letter,
and a Definition of it in the last: to make
writing well (that is like you) more dif∣ficult
to me than ever it was before. Thus
the more great and just your Example and
Definition of Wit are, the less I am capa∣ble
to follow them. Then the best way of
shewing my Judgment, after having seen
how you write, is to leave off writing; and
the best way to shew my Friendship to you,
is to put an end to your Trouble, and to
conclude</P>
<CLOSER>Your, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mr. <HI>POPE</HI>'s Answer.
<DATE>March 25, 1705.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I write to you, I foresee a
long Letter, and ought to beg your
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
Patience before-hand; for if it proves the
longest, it will be of course the worst I have
troubled you with. Yet to express my
Gratitude at large for your obliging Letter,
is not more my Duty than my Interest: as
some People will abundantly thank you for
one Piece of Kindness, to put you in mind of
bestowing another. The more favourable you
are to me, the more distinctly I see my Faults;
Spots and Blemishes you know, are never
so plainly discover'd as in the brightest Sun∣shine.
Thus I am mortified by those Com∣mendations
which were design'd to enco∣urage
me: for Praise to a young Wit, is like
Rain to a tender Flower; if it be mode∣rately
bestow'd, it chears and revives, but
if too lavishly, overcharges and depresses
him. Most Men in years, as they are ge∣nerally
discouragers of Youth, are like old
Trees, that being pasl Bearing themselves,
will suffer no young Plants to flourish be∣neath
them: But as if it were not enough
to have out-done all your Co-aevals in Wit,
you will excell them in good Nature too.
As for my<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">His <HI>Pastorals,</HI> written at 16 Years of Age.</NOTE> green Essays, if you find
any Pleasure in 'em, it must be such as a
Man naturally takes in observing the first
Shoots and Buddings of a Tree which he
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
has rais'd himself: and 'tis impossible they
should be esteem'd any otherwise, than as
we value Fruits for being early, which ne∣vertheless
are the most insipid, and the
worst of the Year. In a word, I must
blame you for treating me with so much
Compliment, which is at best but the Smoak
of Friendship. I neither write, nor con∣verse
with you to gain your Praise but your
Affection. Be so much my Friend as to
appear my Enemy, and tell me my Faults,
if not as a young Man, at least as an un∣experienc'd
Writer.</P>

</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mr. <HI>WYCHERLEY</HI> to Mr. <HI>POPE.</HI>
<DATE>March 29, 1705.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Letter of the Twenty-fifth of
<HI>March</HI> I have receiv'd, which was
more welcome to me than any thing cou'd
be out of the Country, tho' it were one's
Rent due that Day: and I can find no fault
with it, but that it charges me with Want
of Sincerity, or Justice, for giving you your
Due; who shou'd not let your Modesty
be so unjust to your Merit, as to reject
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
what is due to it, and call that Compliment
which is so short of your desert, that it is
rather degrading than exalting you. But if
Compliment be the Smoak only of Friend∣ship
(as you say) however you must allow
there is no Smoak but there is some Fire;
and as the Sacrifice of Incense offer'd to
the Gods wou'd not have been half so
sweet to others, if it had not been for its
Smoak; so Friendship like Love, cannot be
without some Incense, to perfume the
Name it wou'd praise and immortalize.
But since you say you do not write to me
to gain my <HI>Praise,</HI> but my <HI>Affection,</HI> pray
how is it possible to have the one without
the other? We must admire before we
love. You affirm, you would have me
so much your Friend as to appear y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur
Enemy, and find out your Faults rather than
your Perfections: But (my Friend) that
would be so hard to do, that I who love no
Difficulties, can't be persuaded to it. Be∣sides,
the Vanity of a Scribbler is such, that
he will never part with his own Judgment
to gratify another's; especially when he
must take Pains to do it: And tho' I am
proud to be of your Opinion, when you
talk of any Thing, or Man but yourself, I
cannot suffer you to murther your fame,
with your own hand, without opposing
you; epecially when you say your last Let∣ter
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
is the worst (since the longest) you have
favour'd me with; which I therefore think
the best, as the longest Life (if a good one)
is the best, as it yields the more Variety and
is more Exemplary; as a chearful Summer's
Day, tho' longer than a dull one in the
Winter, is less tedious and more entertain∣ing:
Therefore let but your Friendship be
like your Letter, as lasting as it is agreeable,
and it can never be tedious, but more ac∣ceptable
and obliging to</P>
<CLOSER>Your, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></CLOSER>

<OPENER>Mr. <HI>WYCHERLEY</HI> to Mr. <HI>POPE.</HI>
<DATE>April 7, 1705.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE receiv'd yours of the Fifth,
wherein your Modesty refuses the just
Praise I give you, by which you lay claim
to more, as a Bishop gains his Bishoprick
by saying he will not Episcopate: But I must
confess, whilst I displease you by commend∣ing
you, I please my self: just as Incense
is sweeter to the Offerer than the Deity to
whom 'tis offered, by his being so much
above it: For indeed every Man partakes
of the Praise he gives, when it is so justly
gven.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="19"/>
As to my enquiry after your Intrigues
with the <HI>Muses,</HI> you may allow me to make
it, since no old Man can give so young, so
great, and able a Favourite of theirs, Jea∣lousy.
I am, in my Enquiry, like old Sir
<HI>Bernard Gascoign,</HI> who us'd to say, That
when he was grown too old to have his
Visits admitted alone by the Ladies, he al∣ways
took along with him a young Man, to
ensure his Welcome to them; who, had he
come alone had been rejected, only because
his Visits were not scandalous to them.
So I am (like an old Rook, who is ruin'd
by Gaming) forc'd to live on the good For∣tune
of the pushing young Men, whose Fan∣cies
are so vigorous, that they ensure their
Success in their Adventures with the Muses,
by their Strength of Imagination.</P>
<P>—Your Papers are safe in my Custody
(you may be sure) from any one's Theft
but my own; for 'tis as dangerous to trust
a Scribbler with your Wit, as a Gamester
with the Custody of your Money.—If
you happen to come to Town, you will
make it more difficult for me to leave it,
who am, dear Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI></P>

<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
<OPENER>Mr. <HI>POPE</HI>'s Answer.
<DATE>April 30, 1705.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot contend with you. You must
give me leave at once to wave all your
Compliments, and to collect only this in
general from 'em, that your Design is to
encourage me. But I separate from all the
rest that Paragraph or two, in which you
make me so warm an Offer of your Friend∣ship.
Were I possess'd of That, it would
put an End to all those Speeches with
which you now make me blush; and change
them to wholsome Advices, and free Sen∣timents,
which might make me wiser and
happier. I know 'tis the general Opinion,
that Friendship is best contracted betwixt
Persons of equal Age: but I have so much
Interest to be of another Mind, that you
must pardon me if I cannot forbear telling
you a few. Notions of mine, in opposition
to that Opinion.</P>
<P>In the first place 'tis observable, that the
Love we bear to our Friends is generally
caused by our finding the same Dispositions
in them, which we feel in our selves. This
is but Self-love at the Bottom: Whereas the
Affection betwixt People of different Ages
cannot well be such, the Inclinations of such
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
being commonly various. The Friendship
of two young Men is often occasioned by
Love of Pleasure or Voluptuousness, each
being desirous, for his own sake, of one to
assist or incourage him in the Courses he
pursues; as that of two old Men is fre∣quently
on the score of some Profit, Lucre,
or Design upon others: Now, as a young
Man who is less acquainted with the Ways
of the World, has in all probability less of
Interest; and an old Man who may be
weary of himself, less of Self-love; so the
Friendship between them is the more likely
to be true, and unmix'd with too much Self-regard.
One may add to this, that such a
Friendship is of greater Use and Advantage
to both; for the old Man will grow more
gay and agreeable to please the young one;
and the young Man more discreet and pru∣dent
by the help of the old one; so it may
prove a Cure of those epidemical Diseases
of Age and Youth, Sourness and Madness.
I hope you will not need many Arguments
to convince you of the Possibility of this;

<P>I Should believe my self happy in your
good Opinion, but that you treat me
so much in a Style of Compliment. It
has been observ'd of Women, that they
are more subject in their youth to be
touch'd with Vanity than Men, on ac∣count
of their being generally treated this
way; but the weakest Women are not
more so than the weak class of Men,
who are thought to pique themselves up∣on
their Wit, The World is never want∣ing,
when a Coxcomb is accomplishing
himself, to help to give him the finishing
Stroke.</P>
<P>Every man is apt to think his Neigh∣bour
overstock'd with Vanity; yet I can∣not
but fancy, there are certain Times,
when most people are in a disposition of
being inform'd; and 'tis incredible what a
vast Good a little Truth might do, spoken
in such seasons. A very small Alms will
do a great kindness, to people in extream
necessity.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="23"/>
I could name an acquaintance of yours
who wou'd at this time think himself more
obliged to you for the Information of his
Faults, than the Confirmation of his Fol∣lies.
If you would make those the subject
of a Letter, it might be as long as I could
wish your Letters always were.</P>
<P>I do not wonder you have hitherto found
some difficulty (as you are pleas'd to say)
in writing to me, since you have always
chosen the Task of commending me: Take
but the other way, and I dare ingage you
will find none at all.</P>
<P>As for my Verses which you praise so
much, I may truly say they had never been
the cause of any Vanity in me, except what
they gave me when they first occasion'd
my acquaintance with you. But I have
several times since been in danger of this
Vice, as often I mean as I receiv'd any
Letters from you.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, the greatest magnifying
Glasses in the World are a Man's own
Eyes, when they look upon his own Per∣son;
yet even in those, I cannot fancy
my self so extremely like <HI>Alexander the
Great,</HI> as you would persuade me: If I
must be like him, 'tis you will make me so,
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
by complimenting me into a better opinion
of my self than I deserve: They made
him think he was the <HI>Son of Jupiter,</HI> and
you assure me I am a Man of Parts. But
is this all you can say to my honour? You
said ten times as much before, when you
call'd me your Friend. After having made
me believe I possess'd a share in your af∣fection,
to treat me with Compliments and
sweet Sayings, is like the proceeding with
poor <HI>Sancho Pancha:</HI> They had persuaded
him that he enjoy'd a great Dominion,
and then gave him nothing to subsist up∣on
but <HI>Wafers</HI> and <HI>Marmalade.</HI> In our
Days, the greatest obligation you can lay
upon a Wit, is to make a Fool of him.
For as when Madmen are found incurable,
wise Men give them their Way, and please
them as well as they can; so when those
incorrigible things, Poets, are once irreco∣verably
Be-mus'd, the best way both to
quiet them, and secure your selves from
the effects of their Frenzy, is to feed their
Vanity; (which indeed for the most part
is all that is fed in a Poet.)</P>
<P>You may believe me, I could be hear∣tily
glad that all you say were as true, ap∣ply'd
to me, as it would be to your self, for
several weighty Reasons; but for none so
much, as that I might be to you what you
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
deserve; whereas I can now be no more,
than is consistent with the small, tho' ut∣most
Capacity of,</P>

<OPENER>Mr. <HI>POPE</HI> to Mr. <HI>WYCHERLEY.</HI>
<DATE>Oct. 26, 1705.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now chang'd the Scene from
the Town to the Country; from <HI>Will</HI>'s
Coffee-House to <HI>Windsor</HI> Forest. I find no
other difference than this, betwixt the com∣mon
Town-Wits, and the downright Coun∣try
Fools; that the first are pertly in the
Wrong, with a little more Flourish and
Gaiety, and the last neither in the Right
nor the Wrong, but confirmed in a stupid,
settled Medium betwixt both. However,
methinks these are most in the Right, who
quietly and easily resign themselves over to
the gentle Reign of Dulness, which the
Wits must do at last, tho' after a great
deal of Noise, Pother, and Resistance Ours
are a sort of modest, inoffensive People,
who neither. have Sense, nor pretend to
any, but enjoy a jovial Sort of Dulness.
They are commonly known in the World
by the Name of honest, civil Gentlemen.
They live much as they ride, at random;
a kind of hunting Life, pursuing with
earnestness and hazard, something not
worth the catching; never in the way,
nor out of it. I can't but prefer Solitude
to the Company of all these; for tho' a
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
Man's self may possibly be the worst Fel∣low
to converse with in the World, yet
one would think the Company of a Person
whom we have the greatest regard to,
and affection for, could not be very un∣pleasant:
As a Man in love with a Mi∣stress,
desires no Conversation but hers, so
a Man in love with himself, (as most Men
are) may be best pleased with his own.
Besides, if the truest and most useful Know∣ledge,
be the knowledge of our selves, So∣litude
conducing most to make us look into
our selves, should be the most instructive
State of Life. We see nothing more com∣monly,
than Men, who for the sake of the
circumstantial Part, and meer outside of
Life, have been half their Days rambling
out of their Nature, and ought to be sent
into Solitude to study themselves over again.
People are usually spoil'd instead of being
taught, at their coming into the World;
whereas by being more conversant with
Obscurity, without any Pains, they would
naturally follow what they were meant for.
In a word, if a Man be a Coxcomb, So∣litude
is his best School; and if he be a
Fool, it is his best Sanctuary.</P>
<P>These are good Reasons for my own
Stay here, but I wish I could give you
any for your coming hither, except that
I earnestly invite you. And yet I can't help
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
saying, I have suffer'd a great deal of dis∣content
that you do not, tho' I so little
merit that you should.</P>
<P>I must complain of the shortness of your
last: Those who have most Wit, like those
who have most Money, are generally most
sparing of either.</P>

<P>YOURS of the 26th of <HI>October</HI> I have
receiv'd, as I have always done yours,
with no little Satisfaction; and am proud to
discover by it, that you find fault with the
shortness of mine, which I think the best
Excuse for it: And tho' they (as you say)
who have most Wit or Money, are most
sparing of either; there are some who ap∣pear
Poor to be thought Rich, and are
Poor, which is my Case: I cannot but
rejoyce, that you have undergone so much
discontent for want of my company; but
if you have a Mind to punish me for my
fault, (which I could not help) defer your
coming to Town, and you will do it ef∣fectually.
But I know your Charity always
exceeds your Revenge, so that I will not
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
despair of seeing you, who, in return to
your inviting me to your Forest, invite
you to my Forest, the Town; where the
Beasts that inhabit, tame or wild, of long
Ears. or Horns; pursue one another either
out of Love or Hatred. You may have
the Pleasure to see one Pack of Blood-hounds
pursue another Herd of Brutes, to
bring each other to their Fall, which is
their whole Sport: Or, if you affect a less
bloody Chace, you may see a Pack of Spa∣niels,
called <HI>Lovers,</HI> in hot pursuit of a
two-legg'd <HI>Vixen,</HI> who only flies the whole
loud Pack to be singled out by one Dog,
who runs mute to catch her up the sooner
from the rest, as they are making a Noise,
to the Loss of their Game. In fine, this is
the Time for all sorts of Sport in the Town,
when those of the Country cease; there∣fore
leave your Forest of Beasts, for ours
of Brutes, call'd Men, who now in full
Cry, (pack'd by the Court or Country) run
down in the House of Commons, a de∣serted
horned Beast of the Court, to the
satisfaction of their Spectators: Besides,
(more for your Diversion) you may see not
only the two great Play-houses of the
Nation, those of the Lords and Commons,
in Dispute with one another; but the two
other Play-houses in high Contest, because
the Members of one House are remov'd
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
up to t'other, (as it is often done by the
Court for Reasons of State) Insomuch that
the lower Houses, I mean the Play-houses,
are going to act Tragedies on one another
without Doors, and the Sovereign is put to
it (as it often happens in the other two
Houses) to silence one or both, to keep
Peace between them: Now I have told
you all the News of the Town.</P>

<P>I HAVE receiv'd your kind Letter, with
my Paper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The same which was printed in the Year 1717, in a <HI>Miscellany</HI> of <HI>Bern. Lintot</HI>'s, and in the present Edition of the Posthumous Works of Mr.<HI>Wycherley.</HI></NOTE> to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> corrected. I
own you have made more of it by making
it less, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> are said to burn half
the Spices they bring home to inhance the
Price of the remainder, so to be greater
Gainers by their Loss, (which is indeed my
Case now.) Well; you have prun'd my
fading Lawrels of some superfluous, sapless,
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
and dead Branches, to make the remainder
live the longer; thus like your Master <HI>Apollo,</HI>
you are at once a Poet and a Physician.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, as to my impudent invitation
of you to the Town, your good Nature was
the first Cause of my confident request;
but excuse me, I must (I see) say no more
upon this Subject, since I find you a little
too nice to be dealt freely with; tho' you
have given me some Encouragement to
hope, our Friendship (tho' young) might:
be without Shyness, or criminal Modesty;
for a Friend like a Mistress, tho' he is not
to be mercenary to be true, yet ought not
to refuse a Friend's kindness because it is
small or trivial: I have told you (I think)
that a <HI>Spanish</HI> Lady said to her poor, po∣etical
Gallant, that a Queen if she lay with
a Groom, would expect a Mark of his
kindness from him, tho' it were but his
Curry-comb. But you and I will dispute
this Matter when I am so happy as to see
you here; and perhaps 'tis the only Dis∣pute
in which I might hope to have the
better of you.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, to make you another Excuse
for my boldness in inviting you to Town, I
design'd to leave with you some more of
my Papers, (since these return so much bet∣ter
out of your Hands than they went from
mine) for I intended (as I told you formerly)
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>

<DATE>April 10, 1706.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>BY yours of the last Month, you desire
me to select, if possible, some Things
from the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Printed in Folio, in the Year 1704.</NOTE> first Volume of your Miscel∣lanies,
which may be alter'd so as to ap∣pear
again. I doubted your meaning in
this; whether it was to pick out the best
of those Verses, (as that on the <HI>Idleness of
Business;</HI> on <HI>Ignorance;</HI> on <HI>Laziness,</HI> &amp;c.)
to make the Method and Numbers exact,
and avoid Repetitions? For tho' (upon
reading 'em on this occasion) I believe
they might receive such an Alteration with
Advantage; yet they would not be chang'd
so much, but any one would know 'em
for the same at first sight. Or if you mean
to improve the worst Pieces, which are
such as to render them very good, would
require a great addition, and almost the
entire new. writing of them? Or, lastly,
if you mean the middle sort, as the Songs
and Love-Verses? For these will need only
to be shortned, to omit repetition; the
Words remaining very little different from
what they were before. Pray let me know
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
your mind in this, for I am utterly at a
loss. Yet I have try'd what I could do to
some of the <HI>Songs,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Letter of Nov. 20, 1707, (a.)</NOTE> and the <HI>Poems</HI> on
<HI>Laziness</HI> and <HI>Ignorance,</HI> but can't (e'en in
my own partial Judgment) think my al∣terations
much to the purpose. So that I
must needs desire you would apply your
Care wholly at present, to those which are
yet unpublished, of which there are more
than enough to make a considerable Volume,
of full as good ones, nay, I verily believe, of
better than any in Vol. I. which I could
wish you would defer, at least till you have
finish'd these that are yet unprinted.</P>
<P>I send you a Sample of some few of
these; namely, the Verses to Mr. <HI>Waller</HI>
in <HI>his old Age;</HI> your new ones on the
<HI>Duke of Marlborough,</HI> and two others. I
have done all that I thought could be of
advantage to them: Some I have con∣trated,
as we do Sun-beams, to improve
their Energy and Force; some I have ta∣ken
quite away, as we take Branches from
a Tree, to add to the Fruit; others I have
entirely new express'd, and turned more
into Poetry. <HI>Donne</HI> (like one of his Suc∣cessors)
had infinitely more Wit than he
wanted Versifcation: for the great dealers
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
in Wit, like those in Trade, take least
Pains to set off their Goods; while the
Haberdashers of small Wit, spare for no
Decorations or Ornaments. You have com∣mission'd
me to paint your Shop, and I
have done my best to brush you up like
your Neighbours. But I can no more pre∣tend
to the Merit of the Production, than
a Midwise to the Virtues and good Qua∣lities
of the Child she helps into the Light.</P>
<P>The few Things I have entirely added,
you will excuse; you may take them law∣fully
for your own, because they are no
more than Sparks lighted up by your Fire;
and you may omit them at last, if you
think them but Squibs in your Triumphs.</P>

as kind as it is ingenious, for which
therefore I most heartily thank you: It
would have been much more welcome to
me, had it not inform'd me of your want
of Health: But you who have a Mind so
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
vigorous, may well be contented with its
crazy Habitation; since (you know) the old
Similitude says, The Keenness of the Mind
soonest wears out the Body; as the sharpest
Sword soonest destroys the Scabbard: So
that (as I say) you must be satisfy'd with
your apprehension of an uneasy Life (tho'
I hope not a short one) notwithstanding
that generally you sound Wits (tho' weak
Bodies) are immortal hereafter, by that
Genius which shortens your present Life
to prolong that of the future. But I yet
hope, your great, vigorous, and active Mind,
will not be able to destroy your little, ten∣der,
and crazy Carcass.</P>
<P>Now to say something to what you write,
concerning the present epidemick Distem∣per
of the Mind and Age, Calumny; I
know it is no more to be avoided (at one
time or another of our Lives) than a Fever,
or an Ague; and as often those Distem∣pers
attend, or threaten the best Constitu∣tions,
from the worst Air; so does that
malignant Air of Calumny soonest attack
the sound and elevated in Mind, as Storms
of Wind the tallest and most fruitful Trees;
whilst the low and weak, for bowing and
moving to and fro, are by their Weakness,
secure from the danger and violence of the
Tempest. But so much for stinking Ru∣mour,

at once pleas'd and instructed me; so
that I assure you, you can no more write
too much to your absent Friends, than
speak too much to the present. This is a
Truth that all Men own who have either
seen your Writings, or heard your Dis∣course;
enough to make others show their
Judgment, in ceasing to write or talk, es∣pecially
to you, or in your Company. How∣ever,
I speak or write to you, not to please
you, but myself; since I provoke your
Answers; which, whilst they humble me,
give me vanity; tho' I am lessen'd by you
even when you commend me; fince you
commend my little Sense with so much more
of yours, that you put me out of Counte∣nance,

that you have found a way (againft the

I thank you for the Book you promis'd

correct my Lines, but my Life.</P>
<P>As to the damn'd Verses I entrusted you
with, I hope you will let them undergo
your Purgatory, to save them from other
People's damning them; since the Critics,
who are generally the first damn'd in this
Life, like the damn'd below, never leave
to bring those above them under their own
Circumstances. I beg you to peruse my

most tolerable, and look over them again;
for I resolve suddenly to print some of
them, as a harden'd old Gamester will

<P>MR. <HI>Englefyld</HI> being upon his Journey
to <HI>London,</HI> tells me I must write
to you by him, which I do, not more to
comply with his desire, than to gratify my
own; tho' I did it so lately by the Mes∣senger
you sent hither: I take it too as
an opportunity of sending you the fair
Copy of the <HI>Poem</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Original of it in Blots, and with Figures of the References from Copy to Copy, in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Hand, is in the <HI>Harley-Library,</HI> among other such <HI>Brouillons</HI> of Mr. <HI>Wy∣cherley</HI>'s Poems, corrected by him. <HI>Vid.

was not then finish'd, and which I should
not care to hazard by the common Post.
Mr. <HI>Englefyld</HI> is ignorant of the Contents,
and I hope your Prudence will let him re∣main
so, for my sake no less than your
own: Since if you should reveal any thing
of this nature, it would be no wonder Re∣ports
should be rais'd, and there are those
(I fear) who would be ready to improve
them to my disadvantage.</P>
<P>I am sorry you told the great Man,
whom you met in the <HI>Court of Requests,</HI>
that your Papers were in my Hands: No
Man alive shall ever know any such thing
from me; and I give you this warning
besides, that tho' your self should say I had
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
any way assisted you, I am notwithstanding
resolv'd to deny it.</P>
<P>The method of the Copy I send you
is very different from what is was, and
much more regular: For the better help
of your Memory, I desire you to compare
it by the <HI>Figures</HI> in the Margin, answer∣ing
to the same in this Letter. The Poem
is now divided into four Parts, mark'd
with the literal Figures I. II. III. IV. The
first contains the <HI>praise</HI> of Dulness, and shews
how upon several suppositions, it passes for
1. Religion. 2. Philosophy. 3. Example.
4. Wit. And 5. The cause of Wit, and
the end of it. The second Part contains
the <HI>advantages</HI> of Dulness: 1st, In Busi∣ness;
and 2dly at Court; where the Si∣militudes
of the Byass of a Bowl, and
the Weights of a Clock, are directly tend∣ing
to illustrate those advantages of Dul∣ness,
tho' introduced before in a place
where there was no mention made of them;
(which was your only objection to my add∣ing
them.) The third contains the <HI>happi∣ness</HI>
of Dulness in all Stations, and shews
in a great many Particulars, that it is so
fortunate, as to be esteem'd some good
Quality or other in all sorts of People;
that it is thought Quiet, Sense, Caution,
Policy, Prudence, Majesty, Valour, Cir∣cumspection,
Honesty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The fourth Part
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
I have wholly added, as a Climax which
sums up all the <HI>praise, advantage,</HI> and
<HI>happiness</HI> of Dulness in a few words, and
strengthens them all by the opposition of
the <HI>disgrace, disadvantage,</HI> and <HI>unhappiness</HI>
of Wit, with which it concludes<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This is totally omitted in the present Edition: Some of the Lines in the H. M. are these. <Q><L>Thus Dulness, the safe Opiate of the Mind,</L>

<L>Is satisfy'd, secure, and innocent;</L>
<L>No pains it takes, and no offence it gives,</L>
<L>Unfear'd, unhated, undisturb'd it lives.</L>
<L>And if each writing Author's best pretence,</L>
<L>Be but to teach the ignorant more Sense;</L>
<L>Then Dulness was the Cause they wrote before,</L>
<L>As 'tis at last the Cause they write no more;</L>
<L>So Wit, which most to scorn it does pretend,</L>
<L>With Dulness first began, in Dulness last must End.</L></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Tho' the whole be as short again as at
first, there is not one Thought omitted, but
what is a Repetition of something in your
first Volume, or in this very Paper: Some
Thoughts are contracted, where they seem'd
encompass'd with too many words; and some
new express'd, or added, where I thought
there wanted heightning (as you'll see parti∣cularly
in the Simile of the <HI>Clock-Weights</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>It was originally thus express'd:</P>
<P>As Clocks run fastest when most Lead is on.</P>
<P>We find it so in a Letter of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> dated <HI>April</HI> 3, 1705. and in a paper of Verses of his, <HI>To the Author of a Poem call'd Successio,</HI> which got out in a Miscellany in 1712, three Years before Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> died, and two after he had laid aside the whole design of publishing any Poems.</P></NOTE>.

and the Versification throughout, is, I be∣lieve
such, as no Body can be shock'd at.
The repeated permissions you give me of
dealing freely with you, will (I hope) ex∣cuse
what I have done; for if I have not
spar'd you when I thought Severity would
do you a kindness, I have not mangled you
where I thought there was no absolute
need of Amputation. As to Particulars, I
can satisfy you better when we meet; in
the mean time pray write to me when you

<P>YOU may see by my Stile, I had the
happiness and satisfaction to receive
yesterday (by the hand of that Wagg, Mr.
<HI>Englefyld)</HI> your extream kind and obliging
Letter of the 20th of this Month; which
like all the rest of yours, did at once mor∣tify
me, and make me vain; since it tells
me with so much more Wit, Sense and
Kindness than mine can express, that my
Letters are always welcome to you. So
that even whilst your Kindness invites me
to write to you, your Wit and Judgment
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
forbids me; since I may return you a Let∣ter,
but never an Answer.</P>
<P>Now, as for my owning your assistance
to me, in over-looking my unmusical Num∣bers,
and harsher Sense, and correcting
them both, with your Genius, or Judg∣ment;
I must tell you I always own it,
(in spite of your unpoetick Modesty) who
would do with your Friendship as your
Charity; conceal your Bounty to magnify
the Obligation; and even whilst you lay
on your Friend the Favour, acquit him of
the Debt: But that shall not serve your
turn; I will always own, 'tis my infallible
Pope has, or would redeem me from a
poetical Damning the second time; and
save my Rhimes from being condemn'd to
the Critics Flames to all Eternity: But
(by the Faith you profess) you know your
works of Supererrogation, transferr'd upon
an humble, acknowledging Sinner, may
save even Him; having good Works enough
of your own besides, to ensure yours, and
their Immortality.</P>
<P>And now for the pains you have taken
to recommend my <HI>Dulness,</HI> by making it
more methodical, I give you a thousand
thanks; since true and natural <HI>Dulness</HI> is
shown more by its pretence to form and
method, as the sprightliness of Wit by its
despising both. I thank you a thousand
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
times for your repeated Invitations to come
to <HI>Binfield:</HI>—You will find, it will be
as hard for you to get quit of my merce∣nary
kindness to you, as it would for me
to deserve, or to return yours; however,
it shall be the Endeavour of my future Life,
as it will be to demonstrate my self,</P>
<CLOSER>Your, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></CLOSER>

<P>THE Compliments you make me, in
regard of any inconsiderable Service
I could do you, are very unkind, and do
but tell me in other words, that my Friend
has so mean an opinion of me, as to think
I expect acknowledgments for trifles; which
upon my faith I shall equally take amiss,
whether made to my self, or to any others.
For God's sake, (my dear Friend <HI>Wycherley)</HI>
think better of me, and believe I desire
no sort of Favour so much, as that of ser∣ving
you, more considerably than I have yet
been able to do.</P>
<P>I shall proceed in this manner, with
some others of your Pieces; but since you
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
desire I would not deface your Copy for
the future, and only mark the Repetitions;
I must, as soon as I have mark'd these, trans∣cribe
what is left on another Paper; and
in that, blot, alter, and add all I can de∣vise,
for their Improvement. For you are
sensible, the Omission of <HI>Repetitions</HI> is but
one, and the easiest Part, of yours and my
Design; there remaining besides to rectify
the <HI>Method,</HI> to <HI>connect</HI> the <HI>Matter,</HI> and to
mend the <HI>Expression</HI> and <HI>Versification.</HI> I
will go next upon the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some <HI>Brouillons</HI> of these, transcrib'd and very much blotted by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> are extant in the <HI>Harley Library.</HI></NOTE> Poems of <HI>Solitude,</HI>
on the <HI>publick,</HI> and on the <HI>mixt Life;</HI> the
<HI>Bill of Fare;</HI> the <HI>Praises of Avarice,</HI> and
some others.</P>
<P>I must take some Notice of what you
say, of “My pains to make your Dulness
methodical;” and of your hint, that
“The sprightliness of Wit despises method.”
This is true enough, if by <HI>Wit</HI> you mean
no more than <HI>Fancy</HI> or <HI>Conceit;</HI> but in
the better Notion of <HI>Wit,</HI> consider'd as
<HI>propriety,</HI> surely <HI>Method</HI> is not only neces∣sary
for Perspicuity and Harmony of parts,
but gives beauty even to the minute and
particular thoughts, which receive an ad∣ditional
advantage from those which pre∣cede
or follow in their due place: Ac∣cording
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
to a Simile Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> us'd in
conversation, of Feathers in the Crowns of
the wild <HI>Indians,</HI> which they not only chuse
for the beauty of their Colours, but place
them in such a manner as to reflect a Lustre
on each other. I will not disguise any of
my Sentiments from you: To <HI>methodize</HI> in
your Case, is full as necessary as to <HI>strike
out;</HI> otherwise you had better destroy the
whole Frame, and reduce them into <HI>single
Thoughts</HI> in <HI>Prose,</HI> like <HI>Rochfoucault,</HI> as I
have more than once hinted to you.</P>

<P>I HAVE had yours of the 23d of this
Instant, for which I give you many
thanks, since I find by it, that even absence
(the usual bane of Love, or Friendship) can∣not
lessen yours no more than mine.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> had this from Mr. <HI>Cromwell,</HI> after his Enquiry, in these Words. “I returned to Town last <HI>Saturday,</HI> and inquiring (as you desir'd) about Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> was told, in two several Places, that he had been very ill, and that he was even gone off our Stage: But I could not ima∣gine this report to be true, or that so great a Man could leave the World without its being instructed to lament so considerable a Loss.”</NOTE> As
to your hearing of my being ill; I am glad,
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
and sorry for the report: In the first place,
glad that it was not true; and in the next
sorry that it should give you any disturb∣ance,
or concern more than ordinary for
me; for which as well as your concern
for my future well-being or life, I think
my self most eternally oblig'd to you; as∣suring
you, your concern for either will make
me more careful of both. Yet for your
sake I love this Life so well, that I shall
the less think of the other; but 'tis in your
power to ensure my Happiness in one and
the other, both by your Society and good
Example, so not only contribute to my fe∣licity
here, but hereafter.</P>
<P>Now as to your Excuse for the plain∣ness
of your Stile, or Letter, I must needs
tell you, that Friendship is much more ac∣ceptable
to a true Friend than Wit, which
is generally false Reasoning; and a Friend's
reprimand often shews more Friendship
than his compliment: Nay Love, which
is more than Friendship, is often seen, by
our Friend's correction of our Follies or
Crimes. Upon this Test of your Friend∣ship
I intend to put you when I return to
<HI>London,</HI> and thence to you at <HI>Binfield,</HI> which
I hope will be within a Month.</P>
<P>Next to the News of your good Health,
I am pleas'd with the good News of your
going to print some of your Poems, and
<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
proud to be known by them to the Pub∣lick
for your Friend; who intend (perhaps
the same way) to be reveng'd of you for
your kindness; by taking your Name in
vain in some of my future Madrigals: yet
so as to let the World know, my love or
esteem for you are no more Poetick than
my Talent in scribbling. But of all the
Arts of Fiction, I desire you to believe I
want that of feigning Friendship, and that
I am sincerely,</P>

<P>I HAVE received yours of the first of
<HI>May.</HI> Your Pastoral Muse outshines, in
her modest and natural dress, all <HI>Apollo</HI>'s
Court-Ladies, in their more artful, labour'd
and costly Finery; therefore I am glad to
find by your Letter, you design your Coun∣try-beauty
of a Muse shall appear at Court
and in Publick; to outshine all the farded,
lewd, confident, affected, Town-dowdies,
who aim at being honour'd only to their
Shame: But her artful Innocence (on the
contrary) will gain more Honour as she
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
becomes more Publick; and in spite of
Custom will bring Modesty again into Fa∣shion,
or at least make her Sister-rivals of
this Age, blush for Spite, if not for Shame.
As for my stale, antiquated, poetical Puss,
whom you would keep in countenance, by
saying she has once been tolerable, and
would yet pass Muster by a little licking
over; it is true that (like most vain anti∣quated
Jades which have once been passa∣ble)
she yet affects Youthfulness, in her
Age, and wou'd still gain a few Admirers,
(who the more she seeks, or labours for
their liking, are but more her contemners.)
Nevertheless, she is resolv'd henceforth to
be so cautious as to appear very little more
in the World, except it be as an attendant
on your Muse, or as a Foil, not a Rival to
her Wit, or Fame: So that let your Country-gentlewoman
appear when she will in the
World<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, and the following Extract, are a full Confutation of the Lying Spirit of <HI>John Dennis</HI> and others, who impudent∣ly asserted that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> wrote these Verses on himself, (tho' published <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> six Years before his Death.) We find here it was a voluntary Act of his, promis'd before-hand, and written while Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was absent. The first <HI>Brouillon</HI> of those Verses, and the second Copy with Corrections, are both yet extant, <HI>viz.</HI> in the <HI>Harley-Library,</HI> in Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s own hand; from which will appear, that if they received any alteration from Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> it was in the Omission of some of his own Praises.</NOTE>, my old worn-out Jade of a lost Reputation, shall be her attendant into it,

<P>I MUST thank you for a Book of your
Miscellanies, which <HI>Tonson</HI> sent me, I
suppose by your Order; and all I can tell
you of it is, that nothing has lately been
better receiv'd by the Publick, than your
part of it; you have only displeas'd the
Critics by pleasing them too well; hav∣ing
not left them a Word to say for them∣selves,
against you and your Performances;
so that now your hand is in you must per∣severe,
'till my Prophecies of you be ful∣fill'd.
In earnest, all the best Judges of
good Sense, or Poetry, are Admirers of
yours; and like your Part of the Book so
well, that the rest is lik'd the worse. This
is true upon my word, without Compli∣ment;
so that your first Success will make
you for all your Life a Poet, in spite of
your Wit; for a Poet's Success at first,
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
like a Gamester's Fortune at first, is like to
make him a loser at last, and to be un∣done
by his good fortune and merit.</P>
<P>But hither your Miscellanies have safe∣ly
run the Gantlet, through all the Coffee∣houses;
which are now entertain'd with a
whimsical new News-Paper, call'd, <HI>The
Tatler,</HI> which I suppose you have seen.
This is the newest thing I can tell you of,
except it be of the Peace, which now (most
People say) is drawing to such a Conclusion,
as all <HI>Europe</HI> is, or must be satisfy'd with;
so Poverty you see, which makes Peace in
<HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> makes it likewise in the

<P>I AM glad you receiv'd the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jacob Tonson<HI>'s sixth Vol. of</HI> Miscellany Poems.</NOTE> <HI>Miscellany,</HI>
if it were only to show you that there
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
are as bad Poets in this Nation as your
Servant. This modern Custom of appear∣ing
in Miscellanies, is very useful to the
Poets, who, like other Thieves, escape by
getting into a Crowd, and herd together
like <HI>Banditti,</HI> safe only in their Multitude.
Methinks <HI>Strada</HI> has given a good De∣scription
of these kind of Collections;
<HI>Nullus hodiè mortalium aut nascitur, aut
moritur, aut praeliatur, aut rusticatur, aut
abit peregrè; aut redit, aut nubit; aut est,
aut non est, (nam etiam mortuis isti canunt)
cui non illi extemplò cudant Epicedia,
Genethliaca, Protreptica, Panegyrica, Epi∣thalamia,
Vaticinia, Propemptica, Soterica,
Parenaetica, N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enias, Nugas.</HI> As to the suc∣cess
which you say my part has met with,
it is to be attributed to what you were
pleas'd to say of me to the World; which
you do well to call your <HI>Prophecy,</HI> since
whatever is said in my favour, must be a
Prediction of things that are not yet; you,
like a true Godfather, engage on my part
for much more than ever I can perform.
My Pastoral Muse, like other Country Girls,
is but put out of Countenance, by what
you Courtiers say to her; yet I hope you
would not deceive me too far, as knowing
that a young Scribbler's vanity needs no Re∣cruits
from abroad; for Nature like an in∣dulgent
Mother, kindly takes care to sup∣ply
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
her sons with as much of their own,
as is necessary for their Satisfaction. If my
Verses should meet with a few flying Com∣mendations,
<HI>Virgil</HI> has taught me that a
young Author has not too much reason to
be pleas'd with them, when he considers
that the natural consequence of Praise, is
Envy and Calumny.</P>

<P>When once a Man has appear'd as a Poet,
he may give up his Pretensions to all the
rich and thriving Arts: Those who have
once made their court to those Mistresses
without Portions, the Muses, are never like
to set up for Fortunes. But for my part,
I shall be satisfy'd if I can lose my Time
agreeably this way, without losing my Re∣putation:
As for gaining any, I am as
indifferent in the Matter as <HI>Falstaffe</HI> was,
and may say of <HI>Fame</HI> as he did of <HI>Honour,
If it comes, it comes unlook'd for; and there's

As for your wishing to see your Friend

leave the world, since I shall enjoy in your

nay, can learn more from you alone, than
from my long experience of the great, or

<P>As to the success of your Poems in the
late Miscellany, I told you of in my last;
(upon my word) I made you no Compli∣ment,
for you may be assur'd, that all sorts
of Readers like them, except they are
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
Writers too; but for them, (I must needs
say) the more they like them, they ought
to be the less pleas'd with 'em: So that
you do not come off with a bare <HI>Saving
Game</HI> (as you call it) but have gain'd so
much Credit at first, that you must needs
support it to the last: Since you set up
with so great a Stock of good Sense, Judg∣ment,
and Wit, that your Judgment ensures
all that your Wit ventures at. The Salt of
your Wit has been enough to give a re∣lish
to the whole insipid Hotch-Potch it

by which others are turn'd off shamefully,
to their Damnation (for Poetick Thieves as
they are) who think to be sav'd by others
good works, how faulty soever their own
are: But the Coffee-house Wits, or rather
Anti-wits, the Critics, prove their Judg∣ments
by approving your Wit; and even
the News-mongers and Poets will own,
you have more Invention than they; nay,
the Detracters or the Envious, who never
speak well of any Body, (not even of those
they think well of in their absence) yet
will give you (even in your absence) their
good Word; and the <HI>Critics</HI> only hate you,

<P>MY Letters, so much inferior to yours,
can only make up the scarcity of
Sense by their number of Lines; which is like
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> paying a Debt of Gold with a
load of brass Money. But to be a Plain-dealer,
I must tell you, I will revenge the raillery of
your Letters upon mine, by printing them,
(as <HI>Dennis</HI> did mine) <HI>without your know∣ledge
too,</HI> which wou'd be a revenge upon
your Judgment, for the raillery of your
Wit: For some dull Rogues (that is the
most in the World) might be such Fools
as to think what you said of me, was in
earnest: It is not the first time you great
Wits have gain'd Reputation by their pa∣radoxical
or ironical Praises; your Forefa∣thers
have done it, <HI>Erasmus</HI> and others.—
For all Mankind who know me must con∣fess,
he must be no ordinary Genius, or
little Friend, who can find out any thing
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
to commend in me seriously; who have gi∣ven
no sign of my Judgment, but my Opi∣nion
of yours, nor mark of my Wit, but
my leaving off Writing, to the publick,
now you are beginning, to shew the World,
what you can do by yours: whose Wit is
as spiritual as your Judgment infallible; in
whose Judgment I have an implicit Faith,
and shall always subscribe to it to save my
Works in this World, from the Flames and
Damnation.—Pray present my most hum∣ble
Service to Sir <HI>W. Trumbull;</HI> for whom
and whose Judgment I have so profound a
respect, that his Example had almost made
me marry, more than my Nephew's ill

<P>I HAVE had yours of the 30th of the
last Month, which is kinder than I de∣sire
it shou'd be, since it tells me you cou'd
be better pleas'd to be sick again in Town
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
in my company, than to be well in the
Country without it; and that you are more
impatient to be depriv'd of Happiness than
of Health: yet, my dear Friend, set raillery
or compliment aside, I can bear your ab∣sence
(which procures your Health and
Ease) better than I can your company when
you are in Pain: for I cannot see you so
without being so too. Your love to the
Country I do not doubt, nor do you (I hope)
my love to it or you, since there I can en∣joy
your company without seeing you in
Pain to give me Satisfaction and Pleasure;
there I can have you without Rivals or Di∣sturbers;
without the C—s too civil, or
the T—s too rude; without the Noise of
the Loud, and the Censure of the Silent;
and wou'd rather have you abuse me there
with the Truth, than at this distance with
your Compliment: Since now, your busi∣ness
of a Friend and kindness to a Friend,
is by finding fault with his Faults, and
mending them by your obliging Severity.
I hope (in point of your good nature) you
will have no cruel Charity for those Papers
of mine, you were so willing to be trou∣bled
with; which I take most infinitely
kind of you, and shall acknowledge with
gratitude, as long as I live. No Friend can
do more for his Friend than preserving his
Reputation (nay not by preserving his Life)
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
since by preserving his Life he can only
make him live about threescore or four∣score
Years; but by preserving his Reputa∣tion,
he can make him live as long as the
World lasts; so save him from damning,
when he is gone to the Devil: Therefore
I pray condemn me in private, as the
Thieves do their Accomplices in <HI>Newgate,</HI>
to save them from condemnation by the
Publick. Be most kindly unmerciful to my
poetical Faults, and do with my Papers,
as you Country-gentlemen do with your
Trees, slash, cut, and lop-off the Excres∣cencies
and dead Parts of my wither'd Bayes,
that the little remainder may live the lon∣ger,
and increase the value of them, by di∣minishing
the number. I have troubled
you with my Papers rather to give you
Pain than Pleasure, notwithstanding your
compliment, which says, you take the trou∣ble
kindly: Such is the generosity to your
Friends, that you take it kindly to be de∣sired
by them to do them a kindness; and
you think it done to you, when they give
you an opportunity to do it to them.
Wherefore you may be sure to be troubled
with my Letters out of Interest, if not
Kindness; since mine to you will procure
yours to me, so that I write to you more
for my own sake than yours; less to make
you think I write well, than to learn from
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
you to write better. Thus you see Interest
in my Kindness, which is like the Friend∣ship
of the World, rather to make a Friend
than be a Friend; but I am yours, as a true

I may endeavour to print such a Number

having been old Offenders themselves. Pray
believe I have as much Faith in your Friend∣ship

and Sincerity, as I have Deference to
your Judgment; and as the best Mark of
a Friend, is telling his Friend his Faults
in private, so the next is concealing them
from the publick, 'till they are fit to ap∣pear;
in the mean time I am not a little
sensible of the great kindness you do me,
in the trouble you take for me, in put∣ting
my Rhimes in Tune, since good Sounds
set off often ill Sense, as the <HI>Italian</HI> Songs,
whose good Airs, with the worst Words,

your tuning my <HI>Welch</HI> Harp, my rough
Sense may be the less offensive to the ni∣cer
Ears of those Critics, who deal more
in Sound than Sense. Pray then take Pity
at once both of my Readers and me, in
shortning my barren Abundance, and in∣creasing
their Patience by it, as well as the
Obligations I have to you; and since no
Madrigaller can entertain the Head, un∣less
he pleases the Ear; and since the crowd∣ed
Opera's have left the best Comedies with
the least Audiences, 'tis a sign Sound can
prevail over Sense; therefore soften my
Words, and strengthen my Sense, and</P>

<P>YOU give me an account in your
Letter, of the trouble you have un∣dergone
for me, in comparing my Papers
you took down with you, with the old
printed Volume, and with one another of
that Bundle you have in your hands;
amongst which (you say) you find nume∣rous
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Truth of this may be seen in the whole printed Volume of his <HI>Miscellanies</HI> in <HI>Folio,</HI> in 1704, in almost every Page.</NOTE> repetitions, of the same Thoughts
and Subjects; all which I must confess my
want of Memory has prevented me from
imagining; as well as made me capable
of committing them; since, of all Figures,
that of Tautology, is the last I would use,
or least forgive my self for; but seeing is
believing; wherefore I will take some pains
to examine and compare those Papers in
your hands, with one another, as well as
with the former printed Copies or Books,
of my damn'd Miscellanies; all which (as
bad a Memory as I have) with a little
more pains and care, I think I can reme∣dy;
therefore I would not have you give
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
your self more trouble about them, which
may prevent the pleasure you have, and
may give the World, in writing upon new
Subjects of your own, whereby you will
much better entertain your self and others.
Now as to your Remarks upon the whole
Volume of my Papers; all that I desire
of you, is to mark in the Margin (with∣out
defacing the Copy at all) either any
Repetition of Words, Matter, or Sense, or
any Thoughts, or Words too much re∣peated;
which if you will be so kind as
to do for me, you will supply my <HI>want
of Memory,</HI> with your good One, and my
<HI>Deficiences of Sense,</HI> with the Infallibility
of yours; which if you do, you will most
infinitely oblige me, who almost repent the
trouble I have given you, since so much.
Now as to what you call Freedom with
me, (which you desire me to forgive) you
may be assured I would not forgive you
unless you did use it; for I am so far from
thinking your Plainness a Fault, or an Of∣fence
to me, that I think it a Charity and
an Obligation; which I shall always ac∣knowledge,
with all sort of Gratitude to
you for it, who am therefore</P>

<P>I AM sorry you persist to take ill my
not accepting your Invitation, and to
find (if I mistake not) your Exception not
unmixt with some Suspicion. Be certain
I shall most carefully observe your Re∣quest,
not to cross over, or deface the Copy
of your Papers for the future, and only
to mark in the Margin the Repetitions:
But as this can serve no further than to
get rid of those Repetitions, and no way
rectify the <HI>Method,</HI> nor <HI>connect</HI> the <HI>Matter,</HI>
nor improve the <HI>Poetry</HI> in <HI>Expression</HI> or
<HI>Numbers,</HI> without further blotting, adding,

and desire, that you should take your Pa∣pers
out of my hands into your own; and
that no Alterations may be made but when
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
both of us are present; when you may be
satisfied with every Blot, as well as every
Addition, and nothing be put upon the
Papers but what you shall give your own
sanction and assent to, at the same time.</P>
<P>Do not be so unjust, as to imagine from
hence that I would decline any part of
this Task: On the contrary you know, I
have been at the pains of transcribing
some Pieces, at once to comply with your
desire of not defacing the Copy, and yet
to lose no Time in proceeding upon the
Correction. I will go on the same way if
you please; tho' truly it is (as I have often
told you) my sincere Opinion, that the
greater Part would make a much better
Figure, as <HI>Single Maxims</HI> and <HI>Reflections</HI> in

<P>I Return you the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Pastorals.</NOTE> Papers you favour'd
me with, and had sent them to you ye∣sterday
morning, but that I thought to
have brought them to you last night
my self. I have read them over several
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
times with great satisfaction. The Preface
is very judicious and very learned; and the
Verses very tender and easy. The Author
seems to have a particular Genius for that
kind of Poetry, and a Judgment that much
exceeds the years you told me he was of.
He has taken very freely from the Ancients,
but what he has mixt of his own with theirs,
is no way inferior to what he has taken from
them. 'Tis no flattery at all to say, that
<HI>Virgil</HI> had written nothing so

<P>I Receiv'd the favour of your Letter, and
shall be very glad of the continuance
of a correspondence by which I am like to
be so great a gainer. I hope when I have
the happiness of seeing you again in <HI>London,</HI>
not only to read over the Verses I have now
of yours, but more that you have written
since; for I make no doubt but any one
who writes so well, must write more. Not
that I think the most voluminous Poets al∣ways
the best, I believe the contrary is ra∣ther
true. I mentioned somewhat to you
in <HI>London</HI> of a <HI>Pastoral Comedy,</HI> which I
should be glad to hear you had thought
upon since. I find <HI>Menage</HI> in his observa∣tions
upon <HI>Tasso</HI>'s <HI>Aminta,</HI> reckons up four∣score
Pastoral Plays in <HI>Italian:</HI> And in look∣ing
over my old <HI>Italian</HI> Books, I find a great
many Pastorals and Piscatory Plays, which
I suppose <HI>Menage</HI> reckons together. I find
also by <HI>Menage,</HI> that <HI>Tasso</HI> is not the first
that writ in that kind, he mentioning an∣other
before him, which he himself had
never seen, nor indeed have I. But as the
<HI>Aminta, Pastor Fido,</HI> and <HI>Filli di Sciro</HI> of
<HI>Bonarelli</HI> are the three best, so I think there
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
is no dispute but <HI>Aminta</HI> is the best of the
three: Not but that the Discourses in <HI>Pa∣stor
Fido</HI> are more entertaining and copious
in several peoples opinion, tho' not so pro∣per
for Pastoral; and the Fable of <HI>Bonarelli</HI>
more surprizing. I do not remember many
in other Languages, that have written in
this kind with success. <HI>Racan</HI>'s <HI>Bergeries</HI>
are much inferior to his Lyrick Poems; and
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are all too full of Conceits.
<HI>Rapin</HI> will have the design of Pastoral Plays
to be taken from the <HI>Cyclops</HI> of <HI>Euripides.</HI>
I am sure there is nothing of this kind in
<HI>English</HI> worth mentioning, and therefore
you have that Field open to yourself. You
see I write to you without any sort of con∣straint
or method, as things come into my

<OPENER>Mr. <HI>POPE</HI> to Mr. <HI>WALSH.</HI>
<DATE>July 2, 1706.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot omit the first opportunity of
making you my acknowledgments of
reviewing those Papers of mine. You have
no less right to correct me, than the same
hand that rais'd a Tree has to prune it. I
am convinc'd as well as you, that one may
<PB N="65" REF="73"/>
correct too much; for in Poetry as in Paint∣ing,
a Man may lay Colours one upon an∣other,
till they stiffen and deaden the Piece.
Besides to bestow heightning on every part
is monstrous: Some parts ought to be lower
than the rest; and nothing looks more ri∣diculous,
than a Work, where the Thoughts,
however different in their own nature, seem
all on a level: 'Tis like a Meadow newly
mown, where <HI>Weeds, Grass▪</HI> and <HI>Flowers</HI>
are all laid even, and appear undistinguish'd.
I believe too that sometimes our first
Thoughts are the best, as the first squeez∣ing
of the Grapes makes the finest and
richest Wine.</P>
<P>I have not attempted any thing of Pasto∣ral
Comedy, because I think the Taste of
our Age will not relish a Poem of that
sort. People seek for what they call <HI>Wit,</HI>
on all subjects, and in all Places; not consi∣dering
that Nature loves Truth so well, that
it hardly ever admits of flourishing: <HI>Con∣ceit</HI>
is to Nature what <HI>Paint</HI> is to Beauty;
it is not only needless, but impairs what it
wou'd improve. There is a certain Majesty
in Simplicity which is far above all the
Quaintness of Wit: insomuch that the Cri∣tics
have excluded it from the loftiest Poet∣ry,
as well as the lowest, and forbid it to
the Epic no less than the Pastoral. I shou'd
certainly displease all those who are charm'd
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
with <HI>Guarini</HI> and <HI>Bonarelli,</HI> and imitate <HI>Tasso</HI>
not only in the Simplicity of his Thoughts,
but in that of the <HI>Fable</HI> too. If surpri∣sing
discoveries shou'd have place in the
story of a Pastoral Comedy, I believe it
wou'd be more agreeable to Probability to
make them the effects of <HI>Chance</HI> than
of <HI>Design;</HI> Intrigue not being very con∣sistent
with that Innocence, which ought
to constitute a Shepherd's Character. There
is nothing in all the <HI>Aminta</HI> (as I re∣member)
but happens by meer accident;
unless it be the meeting of <HI>Aminta</HI> with <HI>Syl∣via</HI>
at the <HI>Fountain,</HI> which is the contrivance
of <HI>Daphne,</HI> and even that is the most simple
in the world: The contrary is observable
in <HI>Pastor Fido,</HI> where <HI>Corisca</HI> is so perfect
a Mistress of Intrigue, that the Plot cou'd
not have been brought to pass without her.
I am inclin'd to think the Pastoral Come∣dy
has another disadvantage, as to the <HI>Man∣ners:</HI>
Its general design is to make us in love
with the Innocence of a rural Life, so that
to introduce Shepherds of vicious Chara∣cter
must in some measure debase it; and
hence it may come to pass, that even the
virtuous Characters will not shine so much,
for want of being oppos'd to their contra∣ries.—These
Thoughts are purely my
own, and therefore I have reason to doubt
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
them: but I hope your Judgment will set me
right.</P>
<P>I wou'd beg your opinion too as to an∣other
point: It is how far the liberty of
<HI>Borrowing</HI> may extend? I have defended
it sometimes by saying, that it seems not so
much the Perfection of Sense, to say things
that have <HI>never</HI> been said before, as to ex∣press
those <HI>best</HI> that have been said <HI>oftenest;</HI>
and that Writers in the case of borrowing
from others, are like Trees which of them∣selves
wou'd produce only one sort of Fruit,
but by being grafted upon others, may
yield variety. A mutual commerce makes
Poetry flourish; but then Poets like Mer∣chants,
shou'd repay with something of their
own what they take from others; not like
Pyrates, make prize of all they meet. I de∣sire
you to tell me sincerely, if I have not
stretch'd this Licence too far in these Pa∣storals?
I hope to become a Critic by y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur
Precepts, and a Poet by your Example.
Since I have seen your Eclogues, I cannot
be much pleas'd with my own; however
you have not taken away all my Vanity, so
long as you give me leave to profess my
self</P>

<P>I Had sooner return'd you thanks for the
favour of your Letter, but that I was in
hopes of giving you an account at the same
time of my Journey to <HI>Windsor;</HI> but I am
now forc'd to put that quite off, being en∣gag'd
to go to my Corporation of <HI>Rich∣mond</HI>
in <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> I think you are per∣fectly
in the right in your Notions of
Pastoral, but I am of opinion, that the re∣dundancy
of Wit you mention, tho' 'tis
what pleases the common people, is not
what ever pleases the best judges. <HI>Pastor
Fido</HI> indeed has had more admirers than
<HI>Aminta;</HI> but I will venture to say, there is a
great deal of difference betwen the admirers
of one and the other. <HI>Corisca,</HI> which is a
Character generally admir'd by the ordinary
judges, is intolerable in a Pastoral; and <HI>Bo∣narelli</HI>'s
fancy of making his Shepherdess in
love with two Men equally, is not to be
defended, whatever pains he has taken to
do it. As for what you ask of the <HI>Liberty</HI>
of <HI>Borrowing;</HI> 'tis very evident the best
<HI>Latin</HI> Poets have extended this very far;
and none so far as <HI>Virgil,</HI> who is the best
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>
of them. As for the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets, if we
cannot trace them so plainly, 'tis perhaps
because we have none before them; 'tis evi∣dent
that most of them borrow'd from <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>
and <HI>Homer</HI> has been accus'd of burn∣ing
those that wrote before him, that his
Thefts might not be discover'd. The best
of the modern Poets in all Languages, are
those that have the nearest copied the An∣cients.
Indeed in all the common Subjects
of Poetry, the Thoughts are so obvious (at
least if they are natural) that whoever
writes last, must write things like what have
been said before: But they may as well
applaud the Ancients for the Arts of eat∣ing
and drinking, and accuse the Moderns
of having stol'n those Inventions from
them; it being evident in all such cases,
that whoever live first, must first find them
out. 'Tis true, indeed, when
<Q>—unus &amp; alter Assuitur pannus,</Q>
when there is one or two bright Thoughts
stol'n, and all the rest is quite different from
it, a Poem makes a very foolish figure:
But when 'tis all melted down together, and
the Gold of the Ancients so mixt with
that of the Moderns, that none can distin∣guish
the one from the other, I can never
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
find fault with it. I cannot however but
own to you, that there are others of a dif∣ferent
opinion, and that I have shewn your
Verses to some who have made that obje∣ction
to them. I have so much Company
round me while I write this, and such a
noise in my ears, that 'tis impossible I
should write any thing but Nonsense, so
must break off abruptly. I am, Sir,</P>

<OPENER>Mr. WALSH to Mr. POPE.
<DATE>Sept. 9. 1706.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>AT my return from the North I re∣ceiv'd
the favour of your Letter,
which had lain there till then. Having
been absent about six weeks, I read over
your Pastorals again, with a great deal of
pleasure, and to judge the better read <HI>Vir∣gil</HI>'s
Eclogues, and <HI>Spenser</HI>'s Calendar, at
the same time; and I assure you I continue
the same Opinion I had always of them.
By the little hints you take upon all occa∣sions
to improve them, 'tis probable you
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
will make them yet better against Winter;
tho' there is a mean to be kept even in that
too, and a Man may correct his Verses till
he takes away the true Spirit of them;
especially if he submits to the correction of
some who pass for great Critics, by me∣chanical
Rules, and never enter into the
true Design and Genius of an Author. I
have seen some of these that would hardly
allow any one good Ode in <HI>Horace,</HI> who
cry <HI>Virgil</HI> wants fancy, and that <HI>Homer</HI> is
very incorrect. While they talk at this
rate, one would think them above the com∣mon
rate of mortals: but generally they
are great admirers of <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Lucan,</HI> and
when they write themselves, we find out
all the Mystery. They scan their Verses
upon their Fingers; run after Conceits and
glaring Thoughts; their Poems are all
made up of Couplets, of which the first
may be last, or the last first, without any
sort of prejudice to their Works; in which
there is no Design, or Method, or any thing
Natural or Just. For you are certainly in
the right, that in all Writings whatsoever
(not Poetry only) <HI>Nature</HI> is to be follow'd;
and we shou'd be jealous of our selves for
being fond of <HI>Similies, Conceits,</HI> and what
they call saying <HI>Fine Things.</HI> When we
were in the North, my Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> shew'd
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
me a Letter he had receiv'd from a certain
great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Earl of <HI>P.</HI></NOTE> General in <HI>Spain;</HI> I told him I wou'd
by all means have that General recall'd, and
set to writing here at home, for it was im∣possible
that a Man with so much Wit as
he shew'd, cou'd be fit to command an
Army, or do any other Business. As for
what you say of Expression; 'tis indeed
the same thing to Wit, as Dress is to Beau∣ty:
I have seen many Women over-drest,
and several look better in a careless
Night-gown, with their hair about their
ears, than Mademoiselle <HI>Spanheim</HI> drest for
a Ball. I do not design to be in <HI>London</HI>
till towards the Parliament: then I shall
certainly be there; and hope by that time
you will have finisht your Pastorals as you
would have them appear in the world, and
particularly the third of <HI>Autumn</HI> which I
have not yet seen. Your last Eclogue be∣ing
upon the same Subject as that of mine
on Mrs. <HI>Tempest</HI>'s Death, I shou'd take it
very kindly in you to give it a little turn,
as if it were to the Memory of the
same Lady, if they were not written for
some particular Woman whom you wou'd
make immortal. You may take occasion
to shew the difference between Poets Mi∣stresses,
and other Men's. I only hint this,
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
which you may either do, or let alone just
as you think fit. I shall be very much
pleas'd to see you again in Town, and to
hear from you in the mean time. I am

<OPENER>Mr. <HI>POPE</HI> to Mr. <HI>WALSH.</HI>
<DATE>Oct. 22. 1706.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>AFter the Thoughts I have already sent
you on the subject of <HI>English</HI> Versifi∣cation,
you desire my opinion as to some
farther particulars. There are indeed cer∣tain
Niceties, which tho' not much observed
even by correct Versifiers, I cannot but think
deserve to be better regarded.</P>
<P>1. It is not enough that nothing offends
the Ear, but a good Poet will adapt the ve∣ry
Sounds, as well as Words, to the things
he treats of. So that there is (if one may
express it so) a Style of Sound. As in de∣scribing
a gliding Stream, the Numbers
shou'd run easy and flowing; in describing a
rough Torrent or Deluge, sonorous and swel∣ling,
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>
and so of the rest. This is evident
every where in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and no
where else that I know of to any observable
degree. The following Examples will
make this plain, which I have taken from
<HI>Vida.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Molle viam tacito lapsu per levia radit.</L>
<L>Incedit tardo molimine subsidendo.</L>
<L>Luctantes ventos, tempestatesque sonoras.</L>
<L>Immenso cum praecipitans ruit Oceano Nox.</L>
<L>Telum imbelle sine ictu, Conjecit.</L>
<L>Tolle moras, cape saxa manu, cape robora
Pastor,</L>
<L>Ferte citi flammas data tela, repellite
pestem.</L></Q>
<P>This, I think, is what very few observe
in practice, and is undoubtedly of wonder∣ful
force in imprinting the Image on the
reader: We have one excellent Example
of it in our Language, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Ode
on St. <HI>Caecilia</HI>'s Day, entitled, <HI>Alexander</HI>'s
<HI>Feast.</HI></P>
<P>2. Every nice Ear, must (I believe) have
observ'd, that in any smooth <HI>English</HI> Verse
of ten syllables, there is naturally a <HI>Pause</HI>
at the fourth, fifth, or sixth syllable. It is
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
upon these the Ear rests, and upon the ju∣dicious
Change and Management of which
depends the Variety of Versification, For
example,

<P>Now I fancy, that to preserve an exact
Harmony and Variety, the Pauses of the
4th or 6th shou'd not be continu'd above
three lines together, without the Interpo∣sition
of another; else it will be apt to wea∣ry
the Ear with one continu'd Tone, at
least it does mine: That at the 5th runs
quicker, and carries not quite so dead a
weight, so tires not so much tho' it be
continued longer.</P>
<P>3. Another nicety is in relation to <HI>Exple∣tives,</HI>
whether Words or Syllables, which
are made use of purely to supply a vacan∣cy:
<HI>Do</HI> before Verbs plural is absolutely
such; and it is not improbable but future
Refiners may explode <HI>did</HI> and <HI>does</HI> in the
same manner, which are almost always
<PB N="76" REF="84"/>
used for the sake of Rhime. The same
Cause has occasioned the promiscuous use
of <HI>You</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> to the same Person, which
can never sound so graceful as either one or
the other.</P>
<P>4. I would also object to the Irruption of
<HI>Alexandrine</HI> Verses of twelve syllables, which
I think should never be allow'd but when
some remarkable Beauty or Propriety in
them attones for the Liberty: Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>
has been too free of these, especially in his
latter Works. I am of the same opinion as
to <HI>Triple Rhimes.</HI></P>
<P>5. I could equally object to the <HI>Repetition</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the same Rhimes within four or six lines
of each other, as tiresome to the Ear thro'
their Monotony.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Monosyllable-Lines,</HI> unless very artfully
managed, are stiff, or languishing: but may
be beautiful to express Melancholy, Slow∣ness,
or Labour.</P>
<P>7. To come to the <HI>Hiatus,</HI> or Gap be∣tween
two words which is caus'd by two
Vowels opening on each other (upon which
you desire me to be particular) I think the
rule in this case is either to use the <HI>Caesura,</HI>
or admit the <HI>Hiatus,</HI> just as the Ear is least
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>
shock'd by either: For the <HI>Caesura</HI> some∣times
offends the Ear more than the <HI>Hiatus</HI>
itself, and our language is naturally over∣charg'd
with Consonants: As for example;
If in this Verse,
<Q>The Old have Int'rest ever in their Eye,</Q>
we should say, to avoid the <HI>Hiatus,</HI>
<Q>But th' Old have Int'rest—</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Hiatus</HI> which has the worst effect,
is when one word ends with the same
Vowel that begins the following; and next
to this, those Vowels whose sounds come
nearest to each other are most to be avoid∣ed.
O, A, or U, will bear a more full and
graceful Sound than E, I, or Y. I know
some people will think these Observations
trivial, and therefore I am glad to corro∣borate
them by some great Authorities,
which I have met with in <HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Quin∣tilian.</HI>
In the fourth Book of Rhetoric to
<HI>Herennius,</HI> are these words: <HI>Fugiemus cre∣bras
Vocalium concursiones, quae vastam at∣que
hiantem reddunt orationem; ut hoc est,
Baccae aeneae amaenissimae impendebant.</HI> And
Quintilian <HI>l. 9. cap. 4. Vocalium concursus
cum accidit, hiat &amp; intersistit, at quasi la∣borat
oratio. Pessimi longè quae easdem inter
<PB N="78" REF="86"/>
se literas committunt, sonabunt: Praecipuus
tamen erit hiatus earum quae cavo aut patulo
ore efferuntur. E plenior litera est, I angu∣stior.</HI>
But he goes on to reprove the ex∣cess
on the other hand of being too sol∣licitous
in this matter, and says admirably,
<HI>Nescio an negligentia in hoc, aut solicitudo sit
pejor.</HI> So likewise <HI>Tully (Orator ad Brut.)
Theopompum reprehendunt, quod eas literas
tanto opere fugerit, etsi idem magister ejus
Isocrates:</HI> Which last Author, as <HI>Turnebus</HI>
on <HI>Quintilian</HI> observes, has hardly one <HI>Hia∣tus</HI>
in all his Works. <HI>Quintilian</HI> tells us that
<HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Demosthenes</HI> did not much observe
this Nicety, tho' <HI>Tully</HI> himself says in his
Orator, <HI>Crebra ista Vocum concursio, quam
magna ex parte vitiosam, fugit Demosthenes.</HI>
If I am not mistaken, <HI>Malherbe</HI> of all the
Moderns has been the most scrupulous in
this point; and I think <HI>Menage</HI> in his Ob∣servations
upon him says, he has not one in
his Poems. To conclude,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI> died at 49 Years old, in the Year 1708. The Year after, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> writ the <HI>Essay on Criticism,</HI> in which he gives him this Elogy.</NOTE>
I believe the <HI>Hi∣atus</HI>
should be avoided with more care in
Poetry than in Oratory; and I would con∣stantly
try to prevent it, unless where the
cutting it off is more prejudical to the Sound
than the <HI>Hiatus</HI> it self. <HI>I am,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>
<Q><L>Such late was <HI>Walsh,</HI> the Muses Judge and Friend,</L>
<L>Who justly knew to blame or to commend:</L>

<P>I Believe it was with me when I left the
Town, as it is with a great many
Men when they leave the World,
whose loss it self they do not so much re∣gret,
as that of their Friends whom they
leave behind in it. For I do not know one
thing for which I can envy <HI>London,</HI> but
for your continuing there. Yet I guess you
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
will expect I should recant this Expression,
when I tell you, that <HI>Sapho</HI> (by which hea∣thenish
Name you have christen'd a very
orthodox Lady) did not accompany me in∣to
the Country. However, I will confess
my self the less concern'd on that account,
because I have no very violent Inclination
to lose my Heart, especially in so wild and
savage a place as this Forest is: In the Town,
'tis ten to one but a young fellow may find
his stray'd Heart again, with some <HI>Wild∣street</HI>
or <HI>Drury-lane</HI> Damsel; but here,
where I could have met with no redress
from an unmerciful, virtuous Dame, I must
for ever have lost my little Traveller in a
Hole, where I cou'd never rummage to find
him again.—Well, Sir, you have your
Lady in the Town still, and I have my
Heart in the Country still, which being
wholly unemploy'd as yet, has the more
room in it for my Friends, and does not
want a Corner at your Service.—To be
serious, you have extreamly oblig'd me
by your Frankness and Kindness to me:
And if I have abus'd it by too much
Freedom on my part, I hope you will at∣tribute
it to the natural Openness of my
Temper, which hardly knows how to show
Respect, where I feel Affection. I wou'd
love my Friend, as my Mistress; without
Ceremony; and hope a little rough Usage
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
sometimes may not be more displeasing to
the one, than it is to the other.</P>
<P>If you have any Curiosity to know in
what manner I live, or rather lose a Life,
<HI>Martial</HI> will inform you in one Line: (the
Translation of which cost a Friend of ours
three in <HI>English,</HI>
<Q><L>One short, one long,</L>

<L>One right, one wrong.)</L></Q>

<P>Every Day with me is literally an∣other
yesterday; for it is exactly the same:
It has the same Business, which is Poetry;
and the same Pleasure, which is Idleness.
A man might indeed pass his Time much
better, but I question if any Man could
pass it much easier. If you will visit our
Shades this Spring, which I very much de∣sire,
you may perhaps instruct me to ma∣nage
my Game more wisely; but at pre∣sent
I am satisfy'd to trifle away my Time
any Way, rather than let it stick by me;
as Shop-keepers are glad to be rid of those
Goods at any rate, which would otherwise
always be lying upon their hands.</P>
<P>Sir, if you will favour me sometimes with
your Letters, it will be a great Satisfaction
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
to me on several accounts; and on this in
particular, That it will show me (to my
Comfort) that even a wise Man is some∣times

<P>I Have nothing to say to you in this Let∣ter;
but I was resolv'd to write to tell
you so. Why should not I content my self
with so many great Examples, of deep Di∣vines,
profound Casuists, grave Philosophers;
who have written, not Letters only, but
whole Tomes and voluminous Treatises
about Nothing? Why shou'd a Fellow like
me, who all his life does nothing, be a∣sham'd
to write nothing? and that to one
who has nothing to do but to read it?
But perhaps you'll say, the whole World
has something to do, something to talk
of, something to wish for, something to
be imploy'd about: But pray, Sir, cast
up the Account, put all these Somethings
together, and what is the Sum Total but
just Nothing? I have no more to say,
but to desire to give you my Service (that

<P>YOU talk of Fame and Glory, and of
the great Men of Antiquity: Pray tell
me, what are all your great dead Men, but
so many little living Letters? What a vast
Reward is here for all the Ink wasted by
Writers, and the Blood spilt by Princes?
There was in old time one <HI>Severus</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI>
Emperor. I dare say you never call'd him
by any other Name in your Life: and yet
in his days he was styl'd <HI>Lucius, Septimius,
Severus, Pius, Pertinax, Augustus, Parthi∣cus,
Adiabenicus, Arabicus, Maximus,</HI>—
and what not? What a prodigious waste of
Letters has Time made! what a Number
have here dropt off, and left the poor sur∣viving
Seven unattended! For my own part,
Four are all I have to take care for; and I'll
be judg'd by you if any man cou'd live in
less compass? except it were one Mon∣sieur
<HI>D.</HI> and one <HI>Romulus</HI> ⁂ But these, con∣trary
to the common Calamity, came in

process of time, to be call'd Monsieur <HI>Boi∣leau
Despreaux,</HI> and <HI>Romulus Three-points.</HI>

<P>I Have been so well satisfy'd with the
Country ever since I saw you, that I
have not so much as once thought of the
Town, or enquir'd of any one in it besides
Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> and your self. And from
him I understand of your Journey this Sum∣mer
into <HI>Leicestershire;</HI> from whence I guess
you are return'd by this time, to your old
Apartment in the Widow's Corner, to your
old Business of comparing Critics, and re∣conciling
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
commentators; and to the old di∣versions
of a losing game at picquet with
the ladies, and half a play, or a quarter of
a play, at the theatre; where you are none
of the malicious Audience, but the chief of
amorous Spectators; and for the infirmity of
one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Hearing.</NOTE> Sense which there for the most part
could only serve to disgust you, enjoy the
vigour of another which ravishes you.</P>
<Q><L>You know, when one Sense is supprest,</L>
<L>It but retires into the rest.</L></Q>
<P>(According to the poetial, not the learn∣ed,
<HI>Dodwell;</HI> who has done one thing wor∣thy
of eternal memory; wrote two lines in
his life that are not nonsense!) So you have
the advantage of being entertain'd with all
the beauty of the boxes, without being trou∣bled
with any of the dulness of the stage.
You are so good a critic, that 'tis the great∣est
happiness of the modern Poets that you
do not hear their works; and next, that
you are not so arrant a critic, as to damn
them (like the rest) without hearing. But
now I talk of those critics, I have good news
to tell you concerning myself, for which I
expect you shou'd congratulate with me:
It is that beyond all my expectations, and
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
far above my demerits, I have been most
mercifully repriev'd by the sovereign power
of <HI>Jacob Tonson,</HI> from being brought forth
to publick punishment; and respited from
time to time from the hands of those bar∣barous
executioners of the Muses, whom I
was just now speaking of. It often happens,
that guilty Poets, like other guilty criminals,
when once they are known and proclaim'd,
deliver themselves into the hands of Ju∣stice,
only to prevent others from doing it
more to their disadvantage; and not out of
any Ambition to spread their fame, by be∣ing
executed in the face of the world,
which is a fame but of short continuance.
That Poet were a happy man who cou'd
but obtain a grant to preserve his for
ninety-nine years; for those names very
rarely last so many days, which are planted
either in <HI>Jacob Tonson</HI>'s, or the <HI>Ordinary of
Newgate</HI>'s Miscellanies.</P>
<P>I have an hundred things to say to you,
which shall be deferr'd till I have the hap∣piness
of seeing you in town, for the sea∣son
now draws on, that invites every body
thither. Some of them I had commu∣nicated
to you by Letters before this, if
I had not been uncertain where you pass'd
your time the last season: So much fine
weather, I doubt not, has given you all
the pleasure you cou'd desire from the coun∣try,
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
and your own thoughts the best com∣pany
in it. But nothing cou'd allure Mr.
<HI>Wycherley</HI> to our Forest, he continu'd (as
you told me long since he wou'd) an ob∣stinate
lover of the town, in spite of friend∣ship
and fair weather. Therefore hence∣forward,
to all those considerable qualities
I know you possest of, I shall add that of
Prophecy. But I still believe Mr. <HI>Wycher∣ley</HI>'s
intentions were good, and am satisfy'd
that he promises nothing but with a real
design to perform it: how much soever his
other excellent qualities are above my imi∣tation,
his sincerity, I hope, is not; and it
is with the utmost that I am,</P>

<P>I Had sent you the inclos'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a Translation of the first Book of <HI>Statius,</HI> done when the Author was but 14 Years old, as appears by an Ad∣vertisement before the first Edition of it in a Miscellany pub∣blish'd by <HI>B. Lintot,</HI> 8<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 1711.</NOTE> Papers be∣fore
this time, but that I intended to
have brought them my self, and afterwards
cou'd find no opportunity of sending them
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
without suspicion of their miscarrying; not,
that they are of the least value, but for
fear some body might be foolish enough to
imagine them so, and inquisitive enough to
discover those faults which I (by your help)
wou'd correct. I therefore beg the favour
of you to let them go no farther than your
chamber, and to be very free of your re∣marks
in the margins, not only in regard to
the accuracy, but to the fidelity of the tran∣slation;
which I have not had time of late
to compare with its original. And I desire
you to be the more severe, as it is much
more criminal for me to make another
speak nonsense, than to do it in my own
proper, person. For your better help in
comparing, it may be fit to tell you, that
this is not an entire version of the first
book. There is an omission from the 168th
line—<HI>Jam murmura serpunt plebis ageno∣reae</HI>—
to the 312th—<HI>Interea patriis
olim vagus exul ab oris</HI>—(between these
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These he since translated, and they are extent in the printed Version.</NOTE> two <HI>Statius</HI> has a description of the
council of the Gods, and a speech of <HI>Ju∣piter;</HI>
which contain a peculiar beauty
and majesty, and were left out for no
other reason, but because the consequence
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
of this machine appears not till the second
book) The translation goes on from thence
to the words <HI>Hic vero ambobus rabiem
fortuna cruentam</HI> where there is an odd
account of a battle at fisty-cuffs be∣tween
the two Princes on a very slight
occasion, and at a time when one wou'd
think the fatigue of their journey in so tem∣pestuous
a night, might have render'd them
very unfit for such a scuffle. This I had
actually translated; but was very ill satis∣fied
with it, even in my own words, to
which an author cannot but be partial
enough of conscience; it was therefore
omitted in this copy, which goes on above
eighty lines farther, at the words—<HI>Hic pri∣mum
lustrare oculis,</HI> &amp;c.—to the end of
the. book.</P>
<P>You will find, I doubt, not, that <HI>Sta∣tius</HI>
was none of the discreetest Poets,
tho' he was the best versifier next <HI>Vir∣gil:</HI>
In the very beginning he unluckily
betrays his ignorance in the rules of Poetry,
(which <HI>Horace</HI> had already taught the <HI>Ro∣mans)</HI>
when he asks his Muse where to
begin his <HI>Thebaid,</HI> and seems to doubt whe∣ther
it should not be <HI>ab ovo Ledaeo?</HI> when
he comes to the scene of his Poem, and
the prize in dispute between the Brothers,
he gives us a very mean opinion of it—
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
<HI>Pugna est de paupere regno.</HI>—Very diffe∣rent
from the conduct of his master <HI>Virgil,</HI>
who at the entrance of his Poem informs
his reader of the greatness of its sub∣ject,
<HI>—Tantae molis erat Romanam condere
Gentem.</HI> [Bossu <HI>on Epic Poetry.]</HI> There
are innumerable little faults in him, among
which I cannot but take notice of one in
this book, where speaking of the implacable
hatred of the brothers, he says, <HI>The whole
world wou'd be too small a prize to repay so
much impiety.</HI>
<Q><L>Quid si peteretur crimine tanto</L>
<L>Limes uterque Poli, quem Sol emissus Eoo</L>
<L>Cardine, aut portu vergens prospectat Ibero?</L></Q></P>
<P>This was pretty well, one wou'd think
already, but he goes on
<Q><L>Quasque procul terras obliquo sydere tangit</L>
<L>Avius, aut Boreae gelidas, madidive tepentes</L>
<L>Igne Noti?</L></Q></P>
<P>After all this, what cou'd a Poet think
of but Heaven itself for the Prize? but
what follows is astonishing.</P>

<P><PB N="95" REF="101"/>
I do not remember to have met with
so great a fall in any antient author what∣soever.
I shou'd not have insisted so much
on the faults of this Poet, if I did not hope
you wou'd take the same freedom with, and
revenge it upon, his Translator. I shall
be extreamly glad if the reading this can
be any amusement to you, the rather be∣cause
I had the dissatisfaction to hear you
have been confin'd to your chamber by an

any pleasure in my company, it must surely
have been that which most men take in
observing the faults and follies of another;
a pleasure which you see I take care to give
you even in my absence.</P>
<P>If you will oblige me at your leisure with
the confirmation of your recovery, under

<P>YOU had long before this time been
troubled with a Letter from me, but
that I deferr'd it till I cou'd send you either
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jacob Tonson</HI>'s sixth Volume of Poetical Miscellanies, in which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Pastorals and some Versions of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Chaucer</HI> were first printed.</NOTE> Miscellany, or my continuation of
the Version of <HI>Statius.</HI> The first I imagin'd
you might have had before now, but since
the contrary has happen'd, you may draw
this Moral from it, That Authors in gene∣ral
are more ready to write nonsense, than
Booksellers are to publish it. I had I know
not what extraordinary flux of rhyme upon
me for three days together, in which time
all the verses you see added, have been
written; which I tell you that you may
more freely be severe upon them. 'Tis a
mercy I do not assault you with a number
of original Sonnets and Epigrams, which
our modern Bards put forth in the spring∣time,
in as great abundance, as Trees do
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
Blossoms, a very few whereof ever come to
be Fruit, and please no longer than just in
their birth. So that they make no less haste
to bring their flowers of wit to the press,
than gardiners to bring their other flowers
to the market, which if they can't get off
their hands in the morning, are sure to die
before night. Thus the same reason that
furnishes <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> with those nosegays
you so delight in, supplies the <HI>Muses Mer∣cury,</HI>
and <HI>British Apollo</HI> (not to say <HI>Jacob</HI>'s
Miscellanies) with Verses. And it is the
happiness of this age, that the modern in∣vention
of printing Poems for pence a-piece,
has brought the Nosegays of <HI>Parnassus</HI> to
bear the same price; whereby the publick-spirited
Mr. <HI>Henry Hills</HI> of <HI>Blackfryars</HI> has
been the cause of great ease and singular
comfort to all the Learned, who never over∣abounding
in transitory coin, shou'd not be

<P>The time now drawing nigh, when you

<P>I wish you all the pleasures which the
Season and the Nymph can afford; the best
Company, the best Coffee, and the best
News you can desire. And what more to
wish you than this, I do not know; unless
it be a great deal of patience to read and
examine the Verses I send you; and I pro∣mise
you in return a great deal of deference
to your judgment, and an extraordinary obe∣dience
to your sentiments for the future, (to
which you know I have been sometimes a
little refractory.) If you will please to be∣gin
where you left off last, and mark the
margins, as you have done in the pages im∣mediately
before, (which you will find cor∣rected
to your sense since your last perusal)
you will extreamly oblige me, and improve
my Translation. Besides those places which
may deviate from the sense of the Author,
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
it wou'd be very kind in you to observe
any deficiencies in the Diction or Num∣bers.
The <HI>Hiatus</HI> in particular I wou'd
avoid as much as possible, to which you are
certainly in the right to be a profess'd ene∣my;
tho' I confess I cou'd not think it
possible at all times to be avoided by any
writer, till I found by reading <HI>Malherbe</HI>
lately, that there is scarce any throughout
his poems. I thought your observation
true enough to be pass'd into a Rule, but not
a rule without exceptions, nor that ever it
had been reduc'd to practise: But this ex∣ample
of one of the most correct and best of
their Poets has undeceiv'd me, and confirms
your opinion very strongly, and much more

<P>I Have receiv'd part of the Version of
<HI>Statius,</HI> and return you my thanks for
your remarks which I think to be just, ex∣cept
where you cry out (like one in <HI>Horace</HI>'s
<HI>Art of Poetry) Pulchrè, bené, recté!</HI> There
I have some fears, you are often, if not al∣ways,
in the wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="106"/>
One of your objections, namely on that
passage,
<Q>The rest, revolving years shall ripen into Fate,</Q>
may be well grounded, in relation to its not
being the exact sense of the words—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the first book of <HI>Statius,</HI> Verse 302.</NOTE> <HI>Cae∣tera
reliquo ordine ducam.</HI> But the duration
of the Action of <HI>Statius</HI>'s poem may as well
be excepted against, as many things besides
in him: (which I wonder <HI>Bossu</HI> has not ob∣serv'd)
For instead of confining his narra∣tion
to <HI>one year,</HI> it is manifestly exceeded
in the very first two books: The Narration
begins with <HI>Oedipus</HI>'s prayer to the <HI>Fury</HI> to
promote discord betwixt his Sons: af∣terward
the Poet expresly describes their
entring into the agreement of reigning
a year by turns; and <HI>Polynices</HI> takes his flight
for <HI>Thebes</HI> on his brother's refusal to resign
the throne. All this is in the firft book; in
next, <HI>Tydeus</HI> is sent Ambassador to <HI>Etheo∣cles,</HI>
and demands his resignation in these
<Q><L>—Astriferum velox jam circulus orbem</L>
<L>Torsit, &amp; amissae redierunt montibus umbrae,</L>
<L>Ex quo frater inops, ignota per oppida tristes</L>
<L>Exul agit casus—</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="107"/>
But <HI>Bossu</HI> himself is mistaken in one
particular, relating to the commencement of
the Action; saying in Book 2. Cap. 8. that
<HI>Statius</HI> opens it with <HI>Europa</HI>'s <HI>Rape,</HI> where∣as
the Poet at most only deliberates whe∣ther
he shou'd or not?
<Q><L>—Unde jubetis</L>
<L>Ire, Deae? Gentisne canam primor dia, dirae,</L>
<L>Sidonios raptus? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
but then expresly passes all this with a <HI>Lon∣ga
retro series</HI>—and says
<Q><L>—Limes mihi carminis esto</L>
<L><HI>Oedipodae</HI> confusa domus—</L></Q>
Indeed there are numberless particulars
blame-worthy in our Author, which I have
try'd to soften in the version:
<Q><L>—Dubiam{que} jugo fragor impulit Oeten</L>
<L>In latus, &amp; geminis vix fluctibus obstitit Isthmus</L></Q>
is most extravagantly hyperbolical: Nor did
I ever read a greater piece of Tautology
than
<Q><L>—Vacua cum <HI>solus</HI> in Aula</L>
<L>Respiceres <HI>jus omne tuum, cunctos{que} Minores,</HI></L>
<L>Et nusquam <HI>par</HI> stare <HI>caput.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="108"/>
In the Journey of <HI>Polynices</HI> is some geo∣graphical
error,
<Q>—In mediis audit duo litora campis</Q>
could hardly be; for the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Corinth</HI>
is full five miles over: And <HI>Caligantes a∣brupto
sole Mycaenas,</HI> is not consistent with
what he tells us, in Lib. 4. lin. 305: “that
those of <HI>Mycenae</HI> came not to the war at
this time, because they▪ were then in con∣fusion
by the divisions of the Brothers,
<HI>Atreus</HI> and <HI>Thyestes:</HI>” Now from the rai∣sing
the <HI>Greek</HI> Army against <HI>Thebes,</HI> back to
the time of this journey of <HI>Polynices,</HI> is (ac∣cording
to <HI>Statius</HI>'s own account) three years.</P>

<P>THE Morning after I parted from you,
I found my self (as I had prophecy'd)
all alone, in an uneasy Stage-Coach; a dole∣ful
change from that agreeable company I
enjoy'd the night before! without the least
hope of entertainment but from my last
recourse in such cases, a Book. I then be∣gan
to enter into acquaintance with the
<HI>Moralists,</HI> and had just receiv'd from them
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
some cold consolation for the inconvenien∣cies
of this life, and the incertainty of hu∣man
affairs; when I perceiv'd my Vehicle
to stop, and heard from the side of it the
dreadful news of a sick Woman preparing
to enter it. 'Tis not easy to guess at my
mortification, but being so well fortify'd
with Philosophy I stood resign'd with a
Stoical constancy to endure the worst of
evils, a sick Woman. I was indeed a little
comforted to find, by her voice and dress,
that she was Young and a Gentlewoman;
but no sooner was her hood remov'd, but I
saw one of the finest faces I ever beheld,
and to increase my surprize, heard her salute
me by my name. I never had more reason
to accuse Nature for making me short-sight∣ed
than now, when I could not recollect
I had ever seen those fair eyes which knew
me so well, and was utterly at a loss how
to address my self; till with a great deal of
simplicity and innocence she let me know
(even before I discover'd my ignorance) that
she was the daughter of one in our Neigh∣bourhood,
lately marry'd, who having been
consulting her Physicians in Town, was re∣turning
into the Country, to try what good
Air and a new Husband cou'd do to recover
her. My Father, you must know, has
sometimes recommended the Study of Phy∣sick
to me, but I never had any ambition
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
to be a Doctor till this instant. I ventur'd
to prescribe some Fruit (which I happen'd
to have in the Coach) which being forbid∣den
her by her Doctors, she had the more
inclination to. In short, I tempted, and she
eat; nor was I more like the Devil than
she like <HI>Eve.</HI> Having the good success of
the 'foresaid Gentleman before my eyes, I
put on the Gallantry of the old Serpent, and
in spite of my evil Form accosted her with
all the Gaiety I was master of; which had
so good effect, that in less than an hour she
grew pleasant, her colour return'd, and she
was pleas'd to say my prescription had
wrought an immediate cure: In a word, I
had the pleasantest journey imaginable.</P>
<P>Thus far (methinks) my Letter has some∣thing
of the air of a Romance, tho' it be
true. But I hope you will look on what fol∣lows
as the greatest of truths, That I
think my self extreamly oblig'd by you in
all points, especially for your kind and ho∣nourable
Information and Advice in a mat∣ter
of the utmost concern to me, which I
shall ever acknowledge as the highest proof
at once of your friendship, justice, and sin∣cerity.
At the same time be assur'd, that
Gentleman we spoke of, shall never by any
alteration in me discover my knowledge of
his Mistake; the hearty forgiving of which
is the only kind of Return I can possibly
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
make him for so many favours. And I
may derive this pleasure at least from it,
that whereas I must otherwise have been
a little uneasy to know my incapacity of
returning to his Obligations; I may now,
by bearing his Frailty, exercise my Grati∣tude
and Friendship more than Himself
either is, or perhaps ever will be sensible
of.
<Q><L>Ille meos, primus qui me sibi junxit, Amores</L>
<L>Abstulit; ille habeat secum, servetque Sepul∣chro!</L></Q></P>
<P>But in one thing, I must confess you
have your self oblig'd me more than any
man, which is, that you have shew'd me
many of my Faults, to which as you are
the more an implacable Enemy, by so much
the more you are a kind Friend to me. I
cou'd be proud, in revenge, to find a few
slips in your verses, which I read in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and since in the Country with more ap∣plication
and pleasure: the thoughts are ve∣ry
just, and you are sure not to let them
suffer by the Versification. If you wou'd
oblige me with the trust of any thing of
yours, I shou'd be glad to execute any com∣missions
you would give me concerning
them. I am here so perfectly at leisure,
that nothing wou'd be so agreeable an en∣tertainment
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
to me; but if you will not af∣ford
me that, do not deny me at least the
satisfaction of your Letters as long as we are

<P>IF I were to write to you as often as I
think of you, my Letters wou'd be as
bad as a Rent-charge; but tho' the one be
but too little for your Good-nature, the
other wou'd be too much for your Quiet,
which is one blessing Good-nature shou'd
indispensably receive from mankind, in re∣turn
for those many it gives. I have been
inform'd of late, how much I am indebted
to that quality of yours, in speaking well of
me in my absence; the only thing by which
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
you prove your self no Wit or Critic: Tho'
indeed I have often thought, that a friend
will show just as much indulgence (and no
more) to my faults when I am absent, as he
does severity to 'em when I am present.
To be very frank with you, Sir, I must own,
that where I receiv'd so much Civility at
first, I cou'd hardly have expected so much
Sincerity afterwards. But now I have only
to wish, that the last were but equal to the
first, and that as you have omitted nothing
to oblige me, so you wou'd omit nothing
to improve me.</P>
<P>I caus'd an acquaintance of mine to en∣quire
twice of your welfare, by whom I
have been inform'd, that you have left
your speculative Angle in the Widow's
Coffee-house, and bidding adieu for some
time to all the <HI>Rehearsals, Reviews, Ga∣zettes,</HI>
&amp;c. have march'd off into <HI>Lin∣colnshire.</HI>
Thus I find you vary your
life in the scene at least, tho' not in the
Action; for tho' Life for the most part,
like an old Play, be still the same, yet now
and then a new Scene may make it more
entertaining. As for my self, I would not
have my life a very regular Play, let it be a
good merry Farce, a G-d's name, and a fig
for the critical Unities! Yet (on the other
side) I wou'd as soon write like <HI>Durfey,</HI> as
live like <HI>T—e;</HI> whose beastly, yet
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
merry life, is (if you will excuse such a si∣militude)
not unlike a F—t, at once nasty
and laughable. For the generality of men,
a true modern life is like a true modern
play, neither Tragedy, Comedy, nor Farce,
nor one, nor all of these: every Act or is
much better known by his having the same
Face, than by keeping the same Character:
for we change our minds as often as they
can their parts, and he who was yesterday
<HI>Caesar,</HI> is to day Sir <HI>John Daw.</HI> So that
one might ask the same question of a mo∣dern
life, that <HI>Rich</HI> did of a modern play;
“Pray do me the favour, Sir, to inform me;
Is this your Tragedy or your Comedy?”</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer upon this, be∣cause
I persuade my self it might be useful,
at a Time when we have no other Theatre,
to divert our selves at this great one. Here
is a glorious standing Comedy of Fools, at
which every man is heartily merry, and
thinks himself an unconcern'd Spectator.
This (to our singular comfort) neither my
Lord Chamberlain, nor the Queen her self
can ever shut up, or silence. While that
of <HI>Drury</HI> (alas!) lies desolate in the pro∣foundest
peace: and the melancholy pros∣pect
of the Nymphs yet lingring about its
beloved avenues, appears no less moving
than that of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Dames lamenting
over their ruin'd <HI>Ilium!</HI> What now can they
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
hope, dispossess'd of their antient seats, but
to serve as Captives to the insulting Victors
of the <HI>Hay-Market?</HI> The afflicted subjects
of <HI>France</HI> do not, in our <HI>Post-man,</HI> so grie∣vously
deplore the obstinacy of their arbi∣trary
Monarch, as these perishing people of
<HI>Drury</HI> the obdurate heart of that <HI>Pharaoh,
Rich,</HI> who like him, disdains all Proposals
of peace and accommodation. Several Li∣bels
have been secretly affix'd to the great
gates of his imperial palace in <HI>Bridges-street;</HI>
and a Memorial representing the distresses
of these persons, has been accidently dropt
(as we are credibly inform'd by a person of
quality) out of his first Minister the chief
Box-keeper's pocket, at a late Conference
of the said Person of quality and others,
on the part of the Confederates, and his
Theatrical Majesty on his own part. Of
this you may expect a copy as soon as it
shall be transmitted to us from a good hand.
As for the late Congress, it is here reported,
that it has not been wholly ineffectual; but
this wants confirmation; yet we cannot but
hope the concurring prayers and tears of
so many wretched Ladies may induce this
haughty Prince to reason.</P>

<P>I MAY truly say I am more oblig'd to
you this summer than to any of my
Acquaintance, for had it not been for the
two kind letters you sent me, I had been
perfectly, <HI>oblitusque meorum, obliviscendus &amp;
illis.</HI> The only companions I had were
those Muses of whom <HI>Tully</HI> says, <HI>Adoles∣centiam
alunt, Senectutem oblectant, secundas
res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solatium
praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris,
pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rustican∣tur.</HI>
Which indeed is as much as ever
I expected from them; for the Muses,
if you take them as Companions, are ve∣ry
pleasant and agreeable; but whoever
should be forc'd to live or depend up∣on
'em, would find himself in a very bad
condition. That Quiet, which <HI>Cowley</HI> calls
the <HI>Companion of Obscurity,</HI> was not want∣ing
to me, unless it was interrupted by those
fears you so justly guess I had for our
Friend's welfare. 'Tis extreamly kind in
you to tell me the news you heard of him,
and you have deliver'd me from more an∣xiety
than he imagines me capable of on
his account, as I am convinc'd by his long
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
silence. However the love of some things
rewards itself, as of Vertue, and of Mr. <HI>Wy∣cherley.</HI>
I am surpriz'd at the danger you
tell me he has been in, and must agree
with you, that our nation would have lost
in him alone, more wit, and probity,
than would have remain'd (for ought I
know) in all the rest of it. My concern
for his friendship will excuse me, (since I
know you honour him so much, and since
you know I love him above all men) if
I vent a part of my uneasiness to you, and
tell you, that there has not been wanting one
to insinuate malicious untruths of me to Mr.
<HI>Wycherley,</HI> which I fear may have had some
effect upon him. If so, he will have a grea∣ter
Punishment for his credulity than I
cou'd wish him, in that fellow's acquain∣tance.
The loss of a faithful creature is
something, tho' of ever so contemptible
an one; and if I were to change my Dog
for such a Man as the aforesaid, I shou'd
think my Dog undervalu'd: (who follows
me about as constantly here in the country,
as I was us'd to do Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> in the
Town.)</P>
<P>Now I talk of my Dog, that I may not
treat of a worse subject which my spleen
tempts me to, I will give you some account
of him; a thing not wholly unprecedented,
since <HI>Montaigne</HI> (to whom I am but a Dog
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
in comparison) has done the very same thing
of his Cat. <HI>Dic mihi quid melius desidiosus
agam?</HI> You are to know then, that as 'tis
Likeness begets affection, so my favourite
dog is a little one, a lean one, and none of
the finest shap'd. He is not much a Spa∣niel
in his fawning, but has (what might
be worth any man's while to imitate from
him) a dumb surly sort of kindness, that
rather shows itself when he thinks me ill∣us'd
by others, than when we walk quietly
and peaceably by our selves. If it be the
chief point of Friendship to comply with
a friend's Motions and Inclinations, he pos∣sesses
this in an eminent degree; he lies
down when I sit, and walks when I walk,
which is more than many good friends can
pretend to, witness our Walk a year ago in
St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park.—Histories are more full
of examples of the Fidelity of Dogs than
of Friends, but I will not insist upon ma∣ny
of 'em, because it is possible some may
be almost as fabulous as those of <HI>Pylades</HI>
and <HI>Orestes,</HI> &amp;c. I will only say for the ho∣nour
of Dogs, that the two most antient
and esteemable books sacred and prophane
extant, <HI>(viz.</HI> the <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Homer)</HI> have
shewn a particular regard to these animals.
That of <HI>Toby</HI> is the more remarkable, be∣cause
there was no manner of reason to take
notice of the Dog, besides the great hu∣manity
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
of the Author. <HI>Homer</HI>'s account
of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s Dog <HI>Argus</HI> is the most pathe∣tick
imaginable, all the Circumstances con∣sider'd,
and an excellent proof of the old
Bard's Good-nature. <HI>Ulysses</HI> had left him at
<HI>Ithaca</HI> when he embark'd for <HI>Troy,</HI> and
found him at his return after twenty years,
(which by the way is not unnatural as some
Critics have said, since I remember the
dam of my dog was twenty-two years
old when she dy'd: May the omen of lon∣gaevity
prove fortunate to her successor!)

nam'd <HI>Wild-brat,</HI> to one of their Kings who
had been deserted by his subjects: He gave
his Order this motto, or to this effect, (which
still remains) <HI>Wild-Brat was faithful.</HI> Sir
<HI>William Trumbull</HI> has told me a story which
he heard from one that was present:
King <HI>Charles</HI> I. being with some of his

what sort of dogs deserv'd pre-eminence,

me write, who take it for granted I write
nothing but ungodly Verses. I assure you
I am look'd upon in the Neighbour∣hood
for a very well-dispos'd person, no
great Hunter indeed, but a great Admi∣rer
of the noble sport, and only unhappy
in my want of constitution for that, and
Drinking. They all say 'tis pity I am so
sickly, and I think 'tis pity they are so
healthy. But I say nothing that may de∣stroy
their good opinion of me: I have not
quoted one <HI>Latin</HI> Author since I came down,
but have learn'd without book a Song of
Mr. <HI>Thomas Durfey</HI>'s, who is your only Poet
of tolerable reputation in this Country. He
makes all the merriment in our Enter∣tainments,
and but for him, there would
be so miserable a dearth of Catches, that
I fear they wou'd put either the Parson
or me upon making some for 'em. Any
man, of any quality, is heartily wel∣come
to the best Topeing-Table of our
Gentry, who can roar out some Rhapsodies
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
of his works: so that in the same manner
as it was said of <HI>Homer</HI> to his Detractors,
What? dares any man speak against Him
who has given so many men to <HI>Eat?</HI> (mean∣ing
the Rhapsodists who liv'd by repeating
his verses) thus may it be said of Mr. <HI>Durfey</HI>
to his Detractors; Dares any one despise
Him, who has made so many men <HI>Drink?</HI>
Alas, Sir! this is a glory which neither
you nor I must ever pretend to. Neither
you with your <HI>Ovid,</HI> nor I with my <HI>Statius,</HI>
can amuse a whole board of Justices and
extraordinary 'Squires, or gain one hum of
approbation, or laugh of admiration! These
things (they wou'd say) are too studious,
they may do well enough with such as <HI>love
Reading,</HI> but give us your antient Poet
Mr. <HI>Durfey!</HI> 'Tis mortifying enough, it
muft be confess'd; but however, let us pro∣ceed
in the way that nature has directed us—
<HI>Multi multa sciunt, sed nemo omnia,</HI> as it is
said in the Almanack. Let us communi∣cate
our works for our mutual comfort;
send me Elegies, and you shall not want
Heroicks. At present, I have only these
<HI>Arguments in Prose</HI> to the <HI>Thebaid,</HI> which
you claim by promise, as I do your Trans∣lation
of <HI>Pars me Sulmo tenet</HI>—and the
<HI>Ring:</HI> the rest I hope for as soon as you can
conveniently transcribe 'em, and whatsoever

<P>I Had not so long omitted to express
my acknowledgments to you for so
much good-nature and friendship as you
lately show'd me; but that I am but just
return'd to my own Hermitage, from Mr.
<HI>Caryl</HI>'s, who has done me so many favours,
that I am almost inclin'd to think my
Friends infect one another, and that your
conversation with him has made him as
obliging to me as your self. I can assure
you he has a sincere respect for you, and
this I believe he has partly contracted from
me, who am too full of you not to over∣flow
upon those I converse with. But I
must now be contented to converse only
with the Dead of this world, that is to say,
the dull and obscure, every way obscure,
in their intellects as well as their persons:
Or else have recourse to the living Dead,
the old Authors with whom you are so
well acquainted, even from <HI>Virgil</HI> down to
<HI>Aulus Gellius,</HI> whom I do not think a Cri∣tic
by any means to be compar'd to Mr. <HI>Den∣nis:</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
And I must declare positively to you,
that I will persist in this opinion, till you
become a little more civil to <HI>Atticus.</HI> Who
cou'd have imagin'd, that he who had es∣cap'd
all the misfortunes of his Time, un∣hurt
even by the Proscriptions of <HI>Antony</HI>
and <HI>Augustus,</HI> shou'd in these days find an
Enemy more severe and barbarous than those
Tyrants? and that Enemy the gentlest too,
the best-natur'd of mortals, Mr. <HI>C—?</HI>
Whom I must in this compare once more
to <HI>Augustus;</HI> who seem'd not more unlike
himself, in the Severity of one part of
his Life, and the Clemency of the other,
than you. I leave you to reflect on this,
and hope that Time (which mollifies rocks,
and of stiff things makes limber) will turn
a resolute critic to a gentle reader; and in∣stead
of this positive, tremendous, new-fa∣shion'd
Mr. <HI>C—,</HI> restore unto us our old
acquaintance, the soft, beneficent, and cour∣teous
Mr. <HI>C—.</HI></P>
<P>I expect much, towards the civilizing of
you in your critical capacity, from the in∣nocent
Air and Tranquility of our Forest,
when you do me the favour to visit it. In
the mean time, it wou'd do well by way
of Preparative, if you wou'd duly and con∣stantly
every morning read over a Pastoral

somewhere out of your way, for a

and long Airing in an open field, may con∣tribute
more successfully to the cooling a
Critic's severity, than it did to the asswag∣ing
of Mr. <HI>Cheek</HI>'s Anger, of old? In these

<P>AFTER I had recover'd from a dan∣gerous
Illness which was first con∣tracted
in Town, about a fortnight after my
coming hither I troubled you with a letter,
and a paper inclos'd, which you had been
so obliging as to desire a sight of when
last I saw you, promising me in return
some translations of yours from <HI>Ovid.</HI> Since
when, I have not had a syllable from your
hands, so that 'tis to be fear'd that tho' I
have escap'd Death, I have not Oblivion.
I shou'd at least have expected you to have
finish'd that Elegy upon me, which you
told me you was upon the point of begin∣ning
when I was sick in <HI>London;</HI> if you will
but do so much for me first, I will give
you leave to forget me afterwards; and for
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
my own part will die at discretion, and at
my leisure. But I fear I must be forc'd
like many learned Authors, to write my own
Epitaph, if I wou'd be remember'd at all.
<HI>Monfieur de la Fontaine</HI>'s would fit me to a
hair, but it is a kind of Sacrilege, (do you
think it is not?) to steal Epitaphs. In my
present, living dead condition, nothing wou'd
be properer than <HI>Oblitusque meorum, obli∣viscendus
&amp; illis,</HI> but that unluckily I can't
forget my friends, and the civilities I re∣ceiv'd
from your self, and some others.
They say indeed 'tis one quality of ge∣nerous
minds to forget the obligations they
have conferr'd, and perhaps too it may
be so to forget those on whom they con∣ferr'd
'em? Then indeed I must be forgot∣ten
to all intents and purposes! I am, it
must be own'd, dead in a natural capacity,
according to Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff;</HI> dead in a po∣etical
capacity, as a damn'd author; and
dead in a civil capacity, as a useless mem∣ber
of the Common-wealth. But reflect,
dear Sir, what melancholy effects may en∣sue,
if Dead men are not civil to one an∣other?
If he who has nothing to do him∣self,
will not comfort and support another
in his idleness? If those who are to die
themselves, will not now and then pay the
charity of visiting a Tomb and a dead friend,
and strowing a few flow'rs over him? In
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
the shades where I am, the inhabitants have
a mutual compassion for each other: Being
all alike <HI>Inanes,</HI> and <HI>Umbratiles,</HI> we saunter
to one another's habitations, and daily assist
each other in doing nothing at all; this I
mention for your edification and example,
that <HI>Tout plein du vie</HI> as you are, yet you
may not sometimes disdain—<HI>desipere in loco.</HI>
Tho' you are no Papist, and have not so much
regard to the dead as to address your self to
them, (which I plainly perceive by your si∣lence)
yet I hope you are not one of those
Heterodox, who hold them to be totally in∣sensible
of the good offices and kind wishes
of their living friends, and to be in a dull
State of Sleep, without one dream of those
they left behind them? If you are, let this
Letter convince you to the contrary, which
assures you, I am still, tho' in a State of Se∣paration,</P>

<P>'TIS very natural for a young Friend,
and a young Lover, to think the
persons they love have nothing to do but
to please them; when perhaps they, for
their parts, had twenty other engagements
before. This was my case when I won∣der'd
I did not hear from you; but I no
sooner receiv'd your short letter, but I for∣got
your long silence; and so many fine
things as you said of me cou'd not but have
wrought a cure on my own Sickness, if it
had not been of the nature of that, which
is deaf to the Voice of the Charmer. 'Twas
impossible you cou'd have better tim'd your
compliment on my Philosophy; it was cer∣tainly
properest to commend me for it
just when I most needed it, and when I
cou'd least be proud of it; that is, when I
was in pain. 'Tis not easy to express what
an exaltation it gave to my Spirits, above
all the cordials of my Doctor; and 'tis no
compliment to tell you, that your Compli∣ments
were sweeter than the sweetest of his
Juleps and Syrups. But if you will not be∣lieve

<P>Nevertheless I wou'd not have you en∣tirely
lay aside the thoughts of my Epi∣taph,
any more than I do those of the pro∣bability
of my becoming (e're long) the
subject of one. For Death has of late been
very familiar with some of my Size; I am
told my Lord <HI>Lumley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Litton</HI> are
gone before me; and tho' I may now with∣out
vanity esteem my self the least thing
like a Man in <HI>England,</HI> yet I can't but be
sorry, two Heroes of such a make shou'd die
inglorious in their beds; when it had been
a fate more worthy our size, had they met
with theirs from an irruption of Cranes,
or other warlike Animals, those ancient
enemies to our <HI>Pygmaean</HI> Ancestors! You of
a superior species little regard what befals
us <HI>Homunciolos Sesquipedales;</HI> however you
have no reason to be so unconcern'd, since
all Physicians agree there is no greater sign
of a Plague among Men, than a Mortality
among Frogs. I was the other day in com∣pany
with a Lady, who rally'd my Person
<PB N="126" REF="132"/>
so much, as to cause a total subversion of
my countenance: Some days after, to be
reveng'd on her, I presented her among
other company the following <HI>Rondeau</HI> on
that occasion, which I desire you to show
<HI>Sapho.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>You know where you did despise</L>
<L>(T'other day) my little Eyes,</L>
<L>Little Legs, and little Thighs,</L>
<L>And some Things of little Size,</L>
<L>You know where.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You, 'tis true, have fine black Eyes,</L>
<L>Taper Legs, and tempting Thighs,</L>
<L>Yet what more than all we prize</L>
<L>Is a Thing of little Size,</L>
<L>You know where.</L>
</LG>
<P>This sort of writing call'd the <HI>Rondeau</HI>
is what I never knew practis'd in our Na∣tion,
and I verily believe it was not in use
with the <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Romans,</HI> neither <HI>Macro∣bius</HI>
nor <HI>Hyginus</HI> taking the least notice of
it. 'Tis to be observ'd, that the vulgar
spelling and pronouncing it <HI>Round O,</HI> is a
manifest Corruption, and by no means to be
allow'd of by Criticks. Some may mista∣kenly
imagine that it was a sort of <HI>Rondeau</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>
which the <HI>Gallick</HI> Soldiers sung in <HI>Caesar</HI>'s
Triumph over <HI>Gaul—Gallias Caesar
subegit,</HI> &amp;c. as it is recorded by <HI>Suetonius</HI>
in <HI>Julio,</HI> and so derive its original from
the antient <HI>Gauls</HI> to the modern <HI>French:</HI>
but this is erroneous; the words there not
being rang'd according to the Laws of the
<HI>Rondeau,</HI> as laid down by <HI>Clement Marot.</HI>
If you will say, that the Song of the Sol∣diers
might be only the rude beginning of
this kind of Poem, and so consequently
imperfect, neither <HI>Heinsius</HI> nor I can be of
that opinion; and so I conclude, that we
know nothing of the matter.</P>
<P>But, Sir, I ask your pardon for all this
Buffoonry, which I could not address to any
one so well as to you, since I have found
by experience, you most easily forgive my
impertinencies. 'Tis only to show you that
I am mindful of you at all times, that I

<OPENER>Mr. <HI>POPE</HI>'s Answer.
<DATE>July, 20, 1710.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I Give you thanks for the Version you
sent me of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Elegy. It is very
much an image of that author's writing,
who has an agreeableness that charms
without correctness, like a mistress whose
faults we see, but love her with them all.
You have very judiciously alter'd his me∣thod
in some places, and I can find nothing
which I dare insist upon as an error: What
I have written in the margins being meer∣iy
Guesses at a little improvement, rather
than Criticisms. I assure you I do not ex∣pect
you should subscribe to my private
notions but when you shall judge 'em
agreeable to reason and good sense. What
I have done is not as a Critic, but as a
Friend; I know too well how many qua∣lities
are requisite to make up the one,
and that I want almost all I can reckon
up; but I am sure I do not want inclina∣tion,
nor I hope capacity, to be the other.
Nor shall I take it at all amiss, that an∣other
dissents from my opinion: 'Tis no
more than I have often done from my own;
and indeed, the more a man advances in
understanding, he becomes the more every
<PB N="130" REF="136"/>
day a critic upon himself, and finds some∣thing
or other still to blame in his for∣mer
notions and opinions. I cou'd be glad
to know if you have translated the 11th
Elegy of <HI>Lib. 2. Ad amicam navigantem.</HI>
the 8th of Book 3, or the 11th of Book
3, which are above all others my parti∣cular
favourites, especially the last of
these.</P>
<P>As to the passage of which you ask my
opinion in the second <HI>Aeneid,</HI> it is either so
plain as to require no solution; or else
(which is very probable) you see farther
into it than I can. <HI>Priam</HI> wou'd say, that
“<HI>Achilles</HI> (whom surely you only feign to
be your Father, since your actions are so
different from his) did not use me thus
inhumanly. He blush'd at his murder
of <HI>Hector</HI> when he saw my sorrows for
him; and restored his dead body to me
to be buried.” To this the answer of
<HI>Pyrrhus</HI> seems to be agreeable enough.
“Go then to the shades, and tell <HI>Achilles</HI>
how I degenerate from him:” granting
the truth of what <HI>Priam</HI> had said of the
difference between them. Indeed Mr. <HI>Dry∣den</HI>'s
mentioning here what <HI>Virgil</HI> more ju∣diciously
passes in silence, the circumstance
of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s selling <HI>for mony</HI> the body of
<HI>Hector,</HI> seems not so proper; it in some
measure less'ning the character of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
generosity and piety, which is the very
point of which <HI>Priam</HI> endeavours in this
place to convince his Son, and to reproach
him with the want of. But the truth of
this circumstance is no way to be question'd,
being expresly taken from <HI>Homer,</HI> who re∣presents
<HI>Achilles</HI> weeping for <HI>Priam,</HI> yet
receiving the gold, <HI>Iliad</HI> 24: For when he
gives the body, he uses these words, “O
my friend <HI>Patroclus!</HI> forgive me that I
quit the corps of him who kill'd thee;
I have great gifts in ransom for it, which
I will bestow upon thy funeral.”</P>

mihi libertas, hoc pia lingua dedit!</HI> But the
greatest injury he does me is the keeping
me in ignorance of his welfare, which I
am always very sollicitous for, and very un∣easy
in the fear of any Indisposition that
may befal him. In what I sent you some
time ago, you have not verse enough to be
severe upon, in revenge for my last criti∣cism:
In one point I must persist, that is
to say, my dislike of your <HI>Paradise,</HI> in which
I take no pleasure; I know very well that
in <HI>Greek</HI> 'tis not only us'd by <HI>Xenophon,</HI> but
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>
is a common word for any Garden; but
in <HI>English</HI> it bears the signification and
conveys the idea of <HI>Eden,</HI> which alone is
(I think) a reason against making <HI>Ovid</HI> use
it; who will be thought to talk too like a
Christian in your version at least, whatever
it might have been in <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Greek.</HI> As
for all the rest of my Remarks, since you
do not laugh at them as at this, I can
be so civil as not to lay any stress upon 'em
(as I think I told you before) and in parti∣cular
in the point of <HI>Trees enjoying,</HI> you
have, I must own, fully satisfy'd me that
the Expression is not only defensible, but
beautiful. I shall be very glad to see your
Translation of the Elegy, <HI>Ad Amicam na∣vigantem,</HI>
as soon as you can; for (without
a complement to you) every thing you
write either in verse or prose, is welcome
to me; and you may be confident, (if my
opinion can be of any sort of consequence
in any thing) that I will never be unsin∣cere,
tho' I may be often mistaken. To
use Sincerity with you is but paying you in
your own coin, from whom I have expe∣rienc'd
so much of it; and I need not
tell you how much I really esteem you,
when I esteem nothing in the world so
much as that Quality. I know you some∣times
say civil things to me in your Episto∣lary
Style, but those I am to make allow∣ance
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
for, as particularly when you talk of
<HI>Admiring;</HI> 'tis a word you are so us'd to in
conversation of Ladies, that it will creep
into your discourse in spite of you, ev'n to
your Friends. But as Women when they
think themselves secure of admiration, com∣mit
a thousand Negligences, which show
them so much at disadvantage and off
their guard, as to lose the little real
Love they had before: so when men
imagine others entertain some esteem for
their abilities, they often expose all their
Imperfections and foolish works, to the
disparagement of the little Wit they were
thought masters of. I am going to exem∣plify
this to you, in putting into your hands
(being encourag'd by so much indulgence)
some verses of my Youth, or rather Child∣hood;
which (as I was a great admirer of
<HI>Waller)</HI> were intended in imitation of his
manner; and are perhaps, such imitations,
as those you see in awkward country Dames
of the fine and well-bred Ladies of the
Court. If you will take 'em with you into
<HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> they may save you one hour
from the conversation of the country Gen∣tlemen
and their Tenants (who differ but
in Dress and Name) which if it be there as
bad as here, is even worse than my Poetry.
I hope your stay there will be no longer
than (as Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> calls it) to rob the
<PB N="136" REF="142"/>
Country, and run away to <HI>London</HI> with your

<P>I Deferr'd answering your last, upon the
advice I receiv'd that you were leaving
the town for some time, and expected your
return with impatience, having then a de∣sign
of seeing my Friends there, among the
first of which I have reason to account
your self. But my almost continual Ill∣nesses
prevent that, as well as most other
satisfactions of my life: However I may
say one good thing of sickness, that it
is the best Cure in nature for Ambition,
and designs upon the World or Fortune:
It makes a man pretty indifferent for the
future, provided he can but be easy, by
intervals, for the present. He will be con∣tent
to compound for his Quiet only, and
leave all the circumstantial part and pomp
of life to those, who have a health vigo∣rous
enough to enjoy all the Mistresses of
their desires. I thank God, there is no∣thing
out of my self which I would be at
<PB N="137" REF="143"/>
the trouble of seeking, except a Friend; a
happiness I once hop'd to have possess'd in
Mr. <HI>Wycherley;</HI> but—<HI>Quantum mutatus ab
illo!</HI>—I have for some years been em∣ploy'd
much like Children that build houses
with Cards, endeavouring very busily and
eagerly to raise a Friendship, which the first
breath of any ill-natur'd By-stander cou'd
puff away.—But I will trouble you no
farther with writing, nor my self with
thinking, of this subject.</P>
<P>I was mightily pleas'd to perceive by your
quotation from <HI>Voiture,</HI> that you had
track'd me so far as <HI>France.</HI> You see 'tis
with weak heads as with weak stomachs,
they immediately throw out what they re∣ceiv'd
last: and what they read, floats up∣on
the surface of their mind, like Oil up∣on
water, without incorporating. This, I
think however, can't be said of the Love-verses
I last troubled you with, where
all (I am afraid) is so puerile and so
like the Author, that no body will su∣spect
any thing to be borrow'd. Yet
you, (as a friend, entertaining a better
opinion of 'em) it seems search'd in <HI>Wal∣ler,</HI>
but search'd in vain. Your judgment
of 'em is (I think) very right,—for it
was my own opinion before. If you think
'em not worth the trouble of correcting,
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
pray tell me so freely, and it will save me
a labour; if you think the contrary, you
wou'd particularly oblige me by your re∣marks
on the several thoughts as they oc∣cur.
I long to be nibling at your verses,
and have not forgot who promis'd me
<HI>Ovid</HI>'s Elegy <HI>ad Amicam Navigantem?</HI> Had
<HI>Ovid</HI> been as long composing it, as you in
sending it, the Lady might have sail'd to
<HI>Gades,</HI> and receiv'd it at her return. I have
really a great Itch of Criticism upon me,
but want matter here in the Country; which
I desire you to furnish me with, as I do
you in the Town,</P>
<Q><L>Sic servat Studii Faedera quisque sui.</L></Q>
<P>I am obliged to Mr. <HI>Caryl,</HI> (whom you
tell me you met at <HI>Epsom)</HI> for telling you
Truth, as a man is in these days to any
one that will tell Truth to his advantage,
and I think none is more to mine, than what
he told you and I shou'd be glad to tell all
the world, that I have an extream Affection
and Esteem for you.</P>

only observe, that these four lines are as
elegant and musical as any in <HI>Persius,</HI> not

<P>I Am glad to find by your last letter that
you write to me with the freedom of
a friend, setting down your thoughts as they
occur, and dealing plainly with me in the
matter of my own Trifles, which I assure
you I never valu'd half so much as I do that
Sincerity in you which they were the occa∣sion
of discovering to me; and which while
I am happy in, I may be trusted with that
dangerous weapon, Poetry; since I shall do
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
nothing with it but after asking and fol∣lowing
your advice. I value Sincerity the
more, as I find by sad experience, the pra∣ctise
of it is more dangerous; Writers rarely
pardoning the executioners of their verses,
ev'n tho' themselves pronounce sentence up∣on
them.—As to Mr. <HI>Philips</HI>'s Pastorals,
I take the first to be infinitely the best, and
the second the worst; the third is for the
greatest part a Translation from <HI>Virgil</HI>'s
<HI>Daphnis.</HI> I will not forestal your judgment
of the rest, only observe in that of the Night∣ingale
these lines, (speaking of the Musician's
playing on the harp.)</P>
<Q><L>Now lightly skimming o'er the Strings they pass,</L>
<L>Like Winds that gently brush the plying Grass,</L>
<L>And melting Airs arise at their command;</L>
<L>And now, laborious, with a weighty hand,</L>
<L>He sinks into the Cords, with solemn pace,</L>
<L>And gives the swelling Tones a manly grace.</L></Q>
<P>To which nothing can be objected, but
that they are too lofty for Pastoral, espe∣cially
being put into the mouth of a Shep∣herd,
as they are here; in the Poet's own
person they had been (I believe) more pro∣per.
These are more after <HI>Virgil</HI>'s manner
than that of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> whom yet in the
character of Pastoral he rather seems to
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
imitate. In the whole, I agree with the
<HI>Tatler,</HI> that we have no better Eclogues in
our language. There is a small copy of the
same Author publish'd in the <HI>Tatler</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 12.
on the <HI>Danish</HI> Winter: 'Tis Poetical Paint∣ing,
and I recommend it to your peru∣sal.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Garth</HI>'s Poem I have not seen, but
believe I shall be of that Critic's opinion
you mention at <HI>Will</HI>'s, who swore it was
good: For tho' I am very cautious of
swearing after Critics, yet I think one may
do it more safely when they commend, than
when they blame.)</P>
<P>I agree with you in your censure of the
use of <HI>Sea-terms</HI> in Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Virgil;</HI>
not only because <HI>Helenus</HI> was no great Pro∣phet
in those matters, but because no Terms
os Art or Cant-Words suit with the Majesty
and dignity of Stile which <HI>Epic</HI> Poetry
requires.—<HI>Cui mens divinior atque os
magna soniturum.</HI>—The Tarpawlin
Phrase can please none but such <HI>Qui Aurem
habent Batavam;</HI> they must not expect <HI>Au∣ribus
Atticis probari,</HI> I find by you. (I think
I have brought in two phrases of <HI>Martial</HI>
here very dextrously.)</P>
<P>Tho' you say you did not rightly take my
Meaning in the verse I quoted from <HI>Juve∣nal,</HI>
yet I will not explain it; because tho'
it seems you are resolv'd to take me for a
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
Critic, I wou'd by no means be thought a
Commentator.—And for another reason
too, because I have quite forgot both the
Verse and the Application.</P>
<P>I hope it will be no offence to give my
most hearty service to Mr. <HI>Wycherly,</HI> tho'
I perceive by his last to me, I am not
to trouble him with my letters, since he
there told me he was going instantly out of
Town, and till his return was my Ser∣vant,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> I guess by yours he is yet with
you, and beg you to do what you may
with all truth and honour, that is, as∣sure
him I have ever borne all the Re∣spect
and Kindness imaginable to him.
I do not know to this hour what it
is that has estrang'd him from me;
but this I know, that he may for the
future be more safely my friend, since
no invitation of his shall ever more
make me so free with him. I cou'd not
have thought any man had been so very
cautious and suspicious, as not to credit his
own Experience of a friend. Indeed to be∣lieve
no body, may be a Maxim of Safety,
but not so much of Honesty. There is
but one way I know of conversing safely
with all men, that is, not by concealing
what we say or do, but by saying or doing
nothing that deserves to be conceal'd, and
I can truly boast this comfort in my affairs
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>
with Mr. <HI>Wycherly.</HI> But I pardon his Jea∣lousy,
which is become his Nature, and
shall never be his enemy whatsoever he says

my Love-verses, gave me the first opinion
of your sincerity: I assure you it only did
what every good-natur'd action of yours has
done since, confirm'd me more in that opi∣nion.
The Fable of the Nightingale in
<HI>Philips</HI>'s Pastoral, is taken from <HI>Famianus
Strada</HI>'s <HI>Latin</HI> Poem on the same subject,
in his <HI>Prolusiones Academicae;</HI> only the Tomb
he erects at the end, is added from <HI>Virgil</HI>'s
conclusion of the <HI>Culex.</HI> I can't forbear
giving you a passage out of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poem
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
I mention, by which you will find the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Poet is indebted to it.</P>
<Q><L>Alternat mira arte fides, dum torquet acutas</L>

are very remarkable.</P>
<Q><L>From this to that, from that to this he flies,</L>
<L>Feels Musick's Pulse in all its Arteries;</L>
<L>Caught in a net which there <HI>Apollo</HI> spreads,</L>

<P>I have (as I think I formerly told you) a
very good opinion of Mr. <HI>Row</HI>'s 9th book
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>
of <HI>Lucan:</HI> Indeed he amplifies too much,
as well as <HI>Brebaeuf,</HI> the famous <HI>French</HI> Imi∣tator.
If I remember right, he sometimes
takes the whole Comment into the Text of
the Version, as particularly in lin. 808. <HI>Ut{que}
solet pariter totis se effundere signis Corycii
pressura croci.</HI>—And in the place you
quote, he makes of those two lines in the
<HI>Latin</HI>
<Q><L>Vidit quanta sub nocte jaceret</L>
<L>Nostra dies, risitque sui ludibria trunci.</L></Q>
no less than eight in <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>What you observe sure cannot be an
<HI>Error Sphaericus,</HI> strictly speaking, either ac∣cording
to their <HI>Ptolomaick,</HI> or our <HI>Coper∣nican</HI>
System; <HI>Tycho Brahe</HI> himself will be
on the Translator's side. For Mr. <HI>Row</HI> here
says no more, than that he look'd down on
the Rays of the Sun, which <HI>Pompey</HI> might
do, even tho' the Body of the Sun were
above him.</P>
<P>You can't but have remark'd what a
journey <HI>Lucan</HI> here makes <HI>Cato</HI> take for the
sake of his fine Descriptions. From <HI>Cyrene</HI>
he travels by land, for no better reason than
this:
<Q>Haec eadem sua debat Hyems quae clauserat
aequor.</Q>
<PB N="147" REF="153"/>
The Winter's effects on the Sea, it seems,
were more to be dreaded than all the Ser∣pents,
Whirlwinds, Sands, &amp;c. by Land,
which immediately after he paints out in
his speech to the soldiers: Then he fetches
a compass a vast way round about, to the
<HI>Nasamones</HI> and <HI>Jupiter Ammon</HI>'s Temple,
purely to ridicule the Oracles: And <HI>Labi∣enus</HI>
must pardon me, if I do not believe
him when he says—<HI>sors obtulit, &amp; fortuna
viae</HI>—either <HI>Labienus</HI> or the Map, is very
much mistaken here. Thence he returns
back to the <HI>Syrtes</HI> (which he might have
taken first in his way to <HI>Utica)</HI> and so to
<HI>Leptis Minor,</HI> where our Author leaves
him; who seems to have made <HI>Cato</HI> speak

<P>THE System of <HI>Tycho Brahe</HI> (were it
true, as it is <HI>Novel)</HI> cou'd have no

order of the Spheres is clear in <HI>Cicero, De
Natura Deorum, De somnio Scipionis,</HI> and
in <HI>Macrobius.</HI> The Seat of the <HI>Semidei ma∣nes</HI>

Socratis</HI> assigns the same to the <HI>Genii, viz.</HI>
the Region of the <HI>Air</HI> for their intercourse

mistook the situation, and I can't be re∣concil'd

<HI>Lucan</HI>'s Errors, and the cause of 'em, his
Poetic descriptions: for the <HI>Romans</HI> then
knew the coast of <HI>Africa</HI> from <HI>Cyrene</HI> (to

in the first <HI>Georgick</HI> judicious (whence
I conclude that 'tis easier to turn <HI>Virgil</HI>

<P>TO make use of that freedom and fa∣miliarity
of style which we have ta∣ken
up in our Correspondence, and which
is more properly Talking upon paper, than
Writing; I will tell you without any pre∣face,
that I never took <HI>Tycho Brahe</HI> for one
of the Antients, or in the least an acquain∣tance
of <HI>Lucan</HI>'s; nay, 'tis a mercy on
this occasion that I do not give you an ac∣count
of his Life and Conversation; as
how he liv'd some years like an inchanted
Knight in a certain Island, with a tale of a
King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Mistress that shall be
nameless.—But I have compassion on
you, and wou'd not for the world you shou'd
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>
stay any longer among the <HI>Genii</HI> and <HI>Semi∣dei
Manes,</HI> you know where; for if once
you get so near the Moon, <HI>Sapho</HI> will want
your presence in the Clouds and inferior
regions; not to mention the great loss
<HI>Drury-lane</HI> will sustain, when Mr. <HI>C</HI>—
is in the Milky way. These coelestial thoughts
put me in mind of the <HI>Priests</HI> you mention,
who are a sort of <HI>Sortilegi</HI> in one sense,
because in their Lottery there are more
Blanks than Prizes; the Adventurers being
at best in an uncertainty, whereas the Set∣ters-up
are sure of something. Priests in∣deed
in their Character, as they represent
God, are sacred; and so are Constables as
they represent the King; but you will own
a great many of 'em are very odd fellows,
and the devil a bit of likeness in 'em. Yet
I can assure you, I honour the good as
much as I detest the bad, and I think, that
in condemning these, we praise those. I
am so far from esteeming ev'n the worst
unworthy of my protection, that I have
defended their Character (in <HI>Congreve</HI>'s and
<HI>Vanbrugh</HI>'s Plays) ev'n against their own
Brethren. And so much for Priests in
general, now for <HI>Trapp</HI> in particular
whose Translations from <HI>Ovid</HI> I have not
so good an opinion of as you; not (I
will assure you) from any sort of preju∣dice
to him as a Priest, but because I
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
think he has little of the main Characte∣ristick
of his Author, a graceful Easiness.
For let the sense be ever so exactly ren∣der'd,
unless an author looks like himself,
in his air, habit, manner, 'tis a Disguise
and not a Translation. But as to the Psalm,
I think <HI>David</HI> is much more beholding to
him than <HI>Ovid;</HI> and as he treated the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
like a <HI>Jew,</HI> so he has made the <HI>Jew</HI>

one of those whose works may just deserve
reading. I take this Poet to have writ like
a Gentleman, that is, at leisure hours, and
more to keep out of idleness, than to esta∣blish
a reputation: so that nothing regular
or just can be expected from him. All
that regards Design, Form, Fable, (which
is the Soul of Poetry) all that concerns ex∣actness,
or consent of parts, (which is the
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
Body) will probably be wanting; only pret∣ty
conceptions, fine metaphors, glitt'ring
expressions, and something of a neat cast of
Verse, (which are properly the dress, gems,
or loose ornaments of Poetry) may be found
in these verses. This is indeed the case of
most other Poetical Writers of <HI>Miscellanies;</HI>
nor can it well be otherwise, since no man
can be a true Poet, who writes for diversion
only. These Authors shou'd be consider'd
as <HI>Versifiers</HI> and <HI>witty Men,</HI> rather than as
<HI>Poets;</HI> and under this head will only fall
the Thoughts, the Expression, and the
Numbers. These are only the pleasing
parts of Poetry, which may be judg'd of at
a view, and comprehended all at once.
And (to express my self like a Painter) their
<HI>Colouring</HI> entertains the sight, but the <HI>Lines</HI>
and <HI>Life</HI> of the Picture are not to be in∣spected
too narrowly.</P>
<P>This Author form'd himself upon <HI>Pe∣trarch,</HI>
or rather upon <HI>Marino.</HI> His thoughts
one may observe, in the main, are pretty;
but oftentimes far fetch'd, and too often
strain'd and stiffned to make them appear
the greater. For men are never so apt to
think a thing great, as when it is odd or
wonderful; and inconsiderate Authors wou'd
rather be admir'd than understood. This
ambition of surprising a reader, is the true
natural cause of all Fustian, or Bombast in
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
Poetry. To confirm what I have said
you need but look into his first Poem of
the <HI>Weeper,</HI> where the 2d, 4th, 6th, 14th,
21st stanza's are as sublimely dull, as the
7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, 17th, 20th and 23d
stanza's of the same copy, are soft and plea∣sing:
And if these last want any thing, it
is an easier and more unaffected expression.
The remaining thoughts in that Poem might
have been spared, being either but re∣petitions,
or very trivial and mean. And
by this example in the first one may
guess at all the rest; to be like this, a
mixture of tender gentile thoughts and
suitable expressions, of forc'd and inextri∣cable
conceits, and of needless fillers-up
to the rest. From all which it is plain,
this Author writ fast, and set down what
came uppermost. A reader may skim off
the froth, and use the clear underneath; but
if he goes too deep will meet with a
mouthful of dregs: either the Top or bot∣tom
of him are good for little, but what
he did in his <HI>own, natural, middle-way,</HI> is
best.</P>
<P>To speak of his <HI>Numbers</HI> is a little diffi∣cult,
they are so various and irregular, and
mostly Pindarick: 'tis evident his heroic
Verse (the best example of which is his
<HI>(Musick</HI>'s <HI>Duel)</HI> is carelesly made up; but
one may imagine from what it now is,
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
that had he taken more care, it had been
musical and pleasing enough, not extreamly
ly majestic, but sweet: And the time con∣sider'd
of his writing, he was (ev'n as un∣correct
as he is) none of the worst Versifi∣cators.</P>
<P>I will just observe, that the best Pieces
of this Author are, a Paraphrase on Psal. 23.
On <HI>Lessius,</HI> Epitaph on Mr. <HI>Ashton,</HI> Wishes
to his suppos'd Mistress, and the <HI>Dies Irae.</HI></P>

<OPENER>Mr. <HI>POPE</HI> to Mr. <HI>C</HI>—

<P>I Resume my old liberty of throwing out
my self upon paper to you, and ma∣king
what thoughts float uppermost in my
head, the subject of a letter. They are at
present upon <HI>Laughter,</HI> which (for ought I
know) may be the cause you might some∣times
think me too remiss a friend, when
I was most intirely so: for I am never so
inclin'd to mirth as when I am most pleas'd
and most easy, which is in the company of
a friend like your self.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="163"/>
As the fooling and toying with a mistress
is a proof of fondness, not disrespect, so is
raillery with a friend. I know there are
Prudes in friendship, who expect distance,
awe and adoration, but I know you are not
of them; and I for my part am no Idol∣worshipper,
tho' a Papist. If I were to
address <HI>Jupiter</HI> himself in a heathen way,
I fancy I shou'd be apt to take hold of his
knee in a familiar manner, if not of his
beard like <HI>Dionysius;</HI> I was just going to say
of his buttons, but I think <HI>Jupiter</HI> wore
none (however I won't be positive to so
nice a Critick as you, but his robe might
be <HI>Subnected</HI> with a <HI>Fibula.)</HI> I know some
Philosophers define Laughter, <HI>A recommend∣ing
our selves to our own favour, by compa∣rison
with the weakness of another:</HI> but I am
sure I very rarely laugh with that view,
nor do I believe <HI>Children</HI> have any such
consideration in their heads, when they ex∣press
their pleasure this way: I laugh full
as innocently as they, for the most part,
and as sillily. There is a difference too
betwixt laughing <HI>about</HI> a thing and laugh∣ing
<HI>at</HI> a thing: One may find the inferior
Man (to make a kind of casuistical di∣stinction)
provok'd to folly at the sight or
observation of some <HI>circumstance of a thing,</HI>
when the <HI>thing itself</HI> appears solemn and
august to the superior Man, that is, our
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
Judgment and Reason. Let an Ambassador
speak the best Sense in the world, and de∣port
himself in the most graceful manner
before a Prince, yet if the <HI>Tail of his Shirt</HI>
happen (as I have known it happen to a
very wise man) to hang out behind, more
people shall laugh at that than attend to
the other; till they recollect themselves,
and then they will not have a jot the less
respect for the Minister. I must confess
the iniquity of my countenance before you;
several Muscles of my Face sometimes take
an impertinent liberty with my judgment,
but then my Judgment soon rises, and sets
all right again about my mouth: And I
find I value no man so much, as he in
whose sight I have been playing the fool.
I cannot be <HI>Sub-Persona</HI> before a man I
love; and not to laugh with honesty, when
Nature prompts, or Folly (which is more
a second Nature than any thing I know)
is but a knavish hypocritical way of ma∣king
a mask of one's own face.—To
conclude, those that are my friends I <HI>laugh
with,</HI> and those that are not I <HI>laugh at;</HI>
so am merry in company, and if ever I
am wise, it is all by my self. You take
just another course, and to those that are
not your friends, are very civil, and to those
that are, very endearing and complaisant:
Thus when you and I meet, there will be
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
the <HI>Risus &amp; Blanditiae</HI> united together in
conversation, as they commonly are in a
verse: but without Laughter on the one
side, or Compliment on the other, I assure
you I am with real esteem</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Wycherley</HI> visited me at the <HI>Bath</HI> in
my sickness, and express'd much af∣fection
to me: hearing from me how wel∣come
his letters wou'd be, he presently
writ to you; in which I inserted my Scroll,
and after a second. He went to <HI>Gloucester</HI> in
his way to <HI>Salop,</HI> but was disappointed of
a boat and so return'd to the <HI>Bath;</HI> then
he shew'd me your answer to his letters,
in which you speak of my good nature, but
I fear you found me very froward at <HI>Read∣ing;</HI>
yet you allow for my illness. I cou'd
not possibly be in the same house with
Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> tho' I sought it earnestly;
nor come up to town with him, he being en∣gag'd
with others; but whenever we met we
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
talk'd of you. He praises your<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay on Criticism.</NOTE> Poem,
and even outvies me in kind expressions of
you. As if he had not wrote two letters
to you, he was for writing every Post; I
put him in mind he had already. Forgive
me this wrong, I know not whither my tal∣king
so much of your great humanity and
tenderness to me, and love to him; or whe∣ther
the return of his natural disposition to
you, was the cause; but certainly you are
now highly in his favour: now he will come
this Winter to your house, and I must go
with him; but first he will invite you spee∣dily
to town.—I arrived on <HI>Saturday</HI> last
much wearied, yet had wrote sooner, but
was told by Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> (who has writ a pret∣ty
Poem to <HI>Lintot,</HI> and who gives you his
service) that you was gone from home.
<HI>Lewis</HI> shew'd me your letter which set me
right, and your next letter is impatiently
expected by me. Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> came to
town on <HI>Sunday</HI> last, and kindly surpriz'd
me with a visit on <HI>Monday</HI> morning. We
din'd and drank together; and I saying,
<HI>To our Loves,</HI> he reply'd, <HI>'Tis Mr.</HI> Pope'<HI>s
health:</HI> He said he would go to Mr. <HI>Tho∣rold</HI>'s
and leave a letter for you. Tho' I
cannot answer for the event of all this, in

respect to him; yet I can assure you, that
when you please to come you will be most
desirable to me, as always by inclination

<P>I Receiv'd the entertainment of your Let∣ter
the day after I had sent you one of
mine, and I am but this morning return'd
hither. The news you tell me of the ma∣ny
difficulties you found in your return
from <HI>Bath,</HI> gives me such a kind of plea∣sure
as we usually take in accompanying our
Friends in their mixt adventures; for me∣thinks
I see you labouring thro' all your
inconveniencies of the rough roads, the
hard saddle, the trotting horse, and what
not? What an agreeable surprize wou'd
it have been to me, to have met you
by pure accident, (which I was within
an ace of doing) and to have carry'd you
off triumphantly, set you on an easier Pad,
and reliev'd the wandring Knight with a
Night's lodging and rural Repast, at our
Castle in the Forest? But these are only
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
the pleasing Imaginations of a disappointed
Lover, who must suffer in a melancholy
absence yet these two months. In the mean
time, I take up with the Muses for want
of your better company; the Muses, <HI>Quae
nobiscum pernoctant, peregrinantur, rustican∣tur.</HI>
Those aerial Ladies just discover e∣nough
to me of their beauties to urge my
pursuit, and draw me on in a wand'ring
Maze of thought, still in hopes (and only
in hopes) of attaining those favours from
'em, which they confer on their more
happy Admirers. We grasp some more
beautiful Idea in our own brain, than
our endeavours to express it can set to
the view of others; and still do but la∣bour
to fall short of our first Imagina∣tion.
The gay Colouring which Fancy
gave at the first transient glance we had
of it, goes off in the Execution; like those
various figures in the gilded clouds, which
while we gaze long upon, to separate the
parts of each imaginary Image, the whole
faints before the eye and decays into con∣fusion.</P>
<P>I am highly pleas'd with the knowledge
you give me of Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s present
temper, which seems so favourable to me.
I shall ever have such a Fund of Affection
for him as to be agreeable to my self
when I am so to him, and cannot but be
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
gay when he's in good humour, as the
surface of the Earth (if you will pardon a
poetical similitude) is clearer or gloomier,
just as the Sun is brighter, or more over∣cast.
—I should be glad to see the Ver∣ses
to <HI>Lintot</HI> which you mention, for me∣thinks,
something oddly agreeable may be
produc'd from that subject.—For what
remains, I am so well, that nothing but
the assurance of your being so can make
me better; and if you wou'd have me live
with any satisfaction these dark days in
which I cannot see you, it must be by your

<P>MR. <HI>Wycherley</HI> has, I believe, sent you
two or three letters of invitation;
but you, like the Fair, will be long solli∣cited
before you yield, to make the favour
the more acceptable to the Lover. He is
much yours by his talk; for that unbound∣ed
Genius which has rang'd at large like
a libertine, now seems confin'd to you:
<PB N="164" REF="170"/>
and I shou'd take him for your Mistress too
by your simile of the Sun and Earth: 'Tis
very fine, but inverted by the application;
for the gaiety of your fancy, and the droop∣ing
of his by the withdrawing of your
lustre, perswades me it wou'd be juster by
the reverse. Oh happy Favourite of the
Muses! how <HI>per-noctare,</HI> all night long
with them? but alas! you do but toy, but
skirmish with them, and decline a close
Engagement. Leave Elegy and Translation
to the inferior Class, on whom the Muses
only glance now and then like our Win∣ter-Sun,
and then leave 'em in the dark.
Think on the Dignity of Tragedy, which
is of the greater Poetry, as <HI>Dennis</HI> says,
and foil him at his other weapon, as you
have done in Criticism. Every one wonders
that a Genius like yours will not support
the sinking <HI>Drama;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> (tho' I
think his Talent is Comedy) has express'd
a furious ambition to swell in your Buskins.
We have had a poor Comedy of <HI>John∣son</HI>'s
(not <HI>Ben)</HI> which held seven nights,
and has got him three hundred pounds, for
the town is sharp-set on new Plays. In
vain wou'd I fire you by Interest or Ambi∣tion,
when your mind is not susceptible of
either; tho' your Authority (arising from
the General esteem, like that of <HI>Pompey)</HI>
must infallibly assure you of success; for

<P>IF I have not writ to you so soon as I
ought, let my writing now attone for
the delay; as it will infallibly do, when
you know what a Sacrifice I make you at
this time, and that every moment my eyes
are employ'd upon this paper, they are ta∣ken
off from two of the finest Faces in the
universe. But indeed 'tis some consolation
to me to reflect, that while I but write
this period, I escape some hundred fatal
Darts from those unerring Eyes, and about
a thousand Deaths, or better. Now you,
that delight in dying, would not once have
dreamt of an absent Friend in these cir∣cumstances;
you that are so nice an Admi∣rer
of beauty, or (as a Critic wou'd say af∣ter
<HI>Terence) so elegant a Spectator of Forms?</HI>
You must have a sober dish of Coffee, and
a solitary candle at your side, to write an
Epistle Lucubratory to your friend; where∣as
I can do it as well with two pair of
<PB N="166" REF="172"/>
radiant lights, that outshine the golden
God of Day and silver Goddess of Night,
with all the refulgent Eyes of the Firma∣ment.
—You fancy now that <HI>Sapho</HI>'s
eyes are two of these my Tapers, but it is
no such matter, Sir; these are eyes that
have more perswasion in one glance than
all <HI>Sapho</HI>'s Oratory and Gesture together,
let her put her body into what moving pos∣tures
she pleases. Indeed, indeed, my friend,
you cou'd never have found so improper a
time to tempt me with Interest or Ambi∣tion:
let me but have the Reputation of
these in my keeping, and as for my own,
let the Devil, or let <HI>Dennis,</HI> take it for
ever. How gladly wou'd I give all I am
worth, that is to say, my <HI>Pastorals</HI> for one
of them, and my <HI>Essay</HI> for the other? I
wou'd lay out all my <HI>Poetry</HI> in <HI>Love;</HI> an
<HI>Original</HI> for a <HI>Lady,</HI> and a <HI>Translation</HI> for
a <HI>waiting Maid!</HI> alas! what have I to do
with <HI>Jane Gray,</HI> as long as Miss <HI>Molly,</HI>
Miss <HI>Betty,</HI> or Miss <HI>Patty</HI> are in this world?
Shall I write of <HI>Beauties murder'd long ago,</HI>
when there are those at this instant that
<HI>murder me?</HI> I'll e'en compose my own Tra∣gedy,
and the Poet shall appear in his own
person to move compassion: 'Twill be far
more effectual than <HI>Bays</HI>'s entring with a
rope about his neck, and the world will

own, there never was a more miserable Ob∣ject
brought upon the stage.</P>
<P>Now you that are a Critic, ray inform
me, in what manner I may connect the
foregoing part of this Letter with that which
is to follow, according to the Rules? I
wou'd willingly return Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> my thanks
for the favour of his Poem, and in parti∣cular
for his kind mention of me; I hop'd,
when I heard a new Comedy had met with
success upon the Stage, that it had been
his, to which I really wish no less; and
(had it been any way in my power) should
have been very glad to have contributed to
its Introduction into the world. His Ver∣ses
to <HI>Lintot</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These Verses are printed in Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s and our Author's Miscellanies, in 3 <HI>Vols.</HI> 8vo.</NOTE> have put a whim into my

<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send you the book of Rudiments of
<HI>Drawing,</HI> which you were pleas'd to
command, and think my self oblig'd
to inform you at the same time of one of
the many excellencies you possess without
knowing of 'em. You are but too good a
Painter already; and no Picture of <HI>Raphael</HI>'s
was ever so beautiful, as that which you
have form'd in a certain heart of my ac∣quaintance.
Indeed it was but just that the
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>
finest lines in nature shou'd be drawn upon
the most durable ground, and none cou'd
ever be met with that wou'd so readily re∣ceive,
or so faithfully retain them, as this
Heart. I may boldly say of it that you
will not find its fellow in all the <HI>Parts</HI> of
the <HI>Body</HI> in this book. But I must com∣plain
to you of my hand, which is an ar∣rant
traitor to my heart; for having been
copying your picture from thence and from
<HI>Kneller</HI> these three days, it has done all pos∣sible
injury to the finest Face that ever was
made, and to the liveliest Image that ever
was drawn. I have imagination enough
in your absence, to trace some resemblance
of you; but I have been so long us'd to
lose my judgment at the sight of you, that
'tis past my power to correct it by the life.
Your Picture seems least like when plac'd
before your eyes, and contrary to all other
pictures receives a manifest disadvantage
by being set in the fairest Light in the
world. The Painters are a very vain gene∣ration,
and have a long time pretended to
rival Nature; but to own the truth to you,
she made such a finish'd piece about three
and twenty years ago, (I beg your pardon
Madam, I protest I meant but two and
twenty) that 'tis in vain for them any lon∣ger
to contend with her. I know You in∣deed
made one something like it, betwixt
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
five and six years past: 'Twas a little girl,
done with abundance of spirit and life:
and wants nothing but time to be an ad∣mirable
piece: But not to flatter your work,
I don't think 'twill ever come up to what
your Father made. However I wou'd not
discourage you; 'tis certain you have a
strange happiness, in making fine things of
a sudden and at a stroke, with incredible
ease and pleasure.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>IT is too much a rule in this town, that
when a Lady has once done a man a
favour, he is to be rude to her ever after.
It becomes our Sex to take upon us twice
as much as yours allows us: By this me∣thod
I may write to you most impudent∣ly,
because you once answer'd me modest∣ly;
and if you should never do me that
honour for the future, I am to think (like
a true Coxcomb) that your silence gives
consent. Perhaps you wonder why this
is address'd to you rather than to Mrs.
M—with whom I have the right of
an old acquaintance, whereas you are a
<PB N="172" REF="177"/>
fine Lady, have bright eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> First
Madam, I make choice of you rather than
of your Mother, because you are younger
than your Mother. Secondly, because I
fancy you spell better, as having been at
school later. Thirdly, because you have
nothing to do but to write if you please,
and possibly it may keep you from em∣ploying
yourself worse: it may save some
honest neighbouring Gentleman from three
or four of your pestilent glances. Cast your
eyes upon paper, Madam, there you may
look innocently: Men are seducing, books
are dangerous, the amorous one's soften
you, and the godly one's give you the spleen:
If you look upon trees, they clasp in em∣braces;
birds and beasts make love; the
Sun is too warm for your blood, the Moon
melts you into yielding and melancholy.
Therefore I say once more, cast your eyes
upon Paper, and read only such Letters as I
write, which convey no darts, no flames,
but proceed from Innocence of soul, and
simplicity of heart. However, I can al∣low
you a Bonnet lined with green for
your eyes, but take care you don't tarnish
it with ogling too fiercely: I am told, that
hand you shade yourself with this shining
weather, is tann'd pretty much, only with
being carried over those Eyes—thank God
I am an hundred miles off from them—
<PB N="173" REF="178"/>
Upon the whole I wou'd sooner trust your
hand than your Eyes for doing me mis∣chief;
and tho' I doubt not some part of
the rancour and iniquity of your heart
will drop into your pen, yet since it will
not attack me on a sudden and unprepar'd,
since I may have time while I break open
your letter to cross my self and say a <HI>Pater∣noster,</HI>
I hope Providence will protect me
from all you can attempt at this distance.
Mr. B—tells me you are at this hour as
handsome as an Angel, for my part I have
forgot your face since two winters, I don't
know whether you are tall or short, nor
can tell in any respect what sort of creature
you are, only that you are a very mischie∣vous
one whom I shall ever pray to be
defended from. But when Mr. B—sends
me word you have the small pox, a
good many freckles, or are very pale, I will
desire him to give thanks for it in your
Parish Church, which as soon as he shall
inform me he has done I will make you
a visit at—without Armour: I will
eat any thing you give me without suspi∣cion
of poyson, take you by the hand
without gloves, nay venture to follow you
into an arbour without calling the com∣pany.
This Madam is the top of my
wishes, but how differently are our desires
inclined! You sigh out, in the ardour of
<PB N="174" REF="179"/>
your heart, Oh Play-houses, Parks, Ope∣ra's,

Oh Woods, Gardens, Rookeries, Fish∣ponds,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To a Lady, written on the opposite
pages of a Letter to her Husband
from Lady M.</HEAD>
<P>THE Wits would say, that this must
needs be a dull Letter, because it is
a marry'd one. I am afraid indeed you
will find what Spirit there is must be on the
side of the Wife, and the Husband's part
as usual will prove the dullest. What an
unequal Pair are put together in this
sheet? in which tho' we sin, it is you must
do penance. When you look on both sides
of this paper, you may fancy that our
words (according to a Scripture expression)
are as a <HI>Two-edg'd Sword,</HI> whereof Lady
<HI>M.</HI> is the shining blade and I only the
Handle. But I can't proceed without so
far mortifying Sir <HI>Robert</HI> as to tell him,
that she writes this purely in obedience to
<PB N="175" REF="180"/>
me, and that it is but one of those honours
a Husband receives for the sake of his
Wife.</P>
<P>It is making court ill to one fine Woman
to shew her the regard we have for another;
and yet I must own there is not a period of
this Epistle but squints toward another over-against
it. It will be in vain to dissemble:
Your penetrating eyes cannot but discover
how all the letters that compose these words
lean forward after Lady <HI>M</HI>'s letters, which
seem to bend as much from mine, and fly
from them as fast as they are able. Ungrate∣ful
letters that they are! which give them∣selves
to another man in the very presence
of him who will yield to no mortal in
knowing how to value them.</P>
<P>You will think I forget my self, and am
not writing to you; but let me tell you,
'tis you forget your self in that thought,
for you are almost the only Woman to
whom one can safely address the praises
of another. Besides can you imagine a
Man of my importance so stupid, as to say
fine things to you before your Husband?
Let us see how far Lady <HI>M.</HI> her self dares
do any thing like it, with all the wit and
address she is mistress of. If Sir <HI>Robert</HI> can
be so ignorant (now he is left to himself in
the country) to imagine any such matter,
let him know from me, that here in town
<PB N="176" REF="181"/>
every thing that Lady says is taken for Sa∣tire.
For my part, every body knows it is
my constant practice to speak Truth, and
I never do it more than when I call my
self</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To a Lady in the Name of her
Brother.</HEAD>
<P>IF you have not a chaste ear and a pure
heart do not peruse this Letter, for as
<HI>Jeremy Taylor</HI> says in his <HI>holy living and
dying,</HI> the first thing a Virgin ought to en∣deavour,
is to be ignorant of the <HI>distin∣ction</HI>
of <HI>Sexes.</HI></P>
<P>It is in the confidence I have that you
are thus innocent, that I endeavour to gra∣tify
your curiosity in a point in which I
am sensible none but a Brother could do it
with decency.</P>
<P>I shall entertain you with the most reign∣ing
Curiosity in the town, I mean a Person
who is equally the toast of gentlemen and
ladies, and is at present more universally
admired than any of either Sex: You know
<PB N="177" REF="182"/>
few proficients have a greater genius for
Monsters than my self; but I never tasted
a monster to that degree I have done this
creature: It was not, like other monsters,
produced in the Desarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> nor came
from the country of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> but
is the production of the joint-endeavours of
a <HI>Kentish</HI> Parson and his Spouse, who inten∣ded
in the singleness of heart to have begot
a christian but of one sex, and providence
has sent them one of two.</P>
<P>There are various opinions concerning
this Creature about town. Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> ob∣serves
that the Age is very licentious, and
the present Reign very lewd and corrupt, in
permitting a Lady <HI>by Authority</HI> (as appears
by the printed bills) to expose her personal
curiosities for a Shilling.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P.</HI> looks upon it as a Prodigy por∣tending
some great Revolution in the State:
to strengthen which opinion he produces
the following Prophecy of <HI>Nostradamus,</HI>
which he explains politically,</P>
<Q><L>When as two Sexes join'd in One,</L>
<L>Shall in the Realm of <HI>Brute</HI> be shown;</L>
<L>Then Factions shall unite, if I know,</L>
<L>To choose a Prince <HI>Jure Divino.</HI></L>
<L>This Prodigy of common Gender</L>
<L>Is neither Sex but a Pretender,</L>
<L>So the Lord shield the Faith's Defender.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="178" REF="183"/>
Mrs. <HI>N</HI>—admires what people won∣der
at so much? and says she is just so
her self: The Duchess of <HI>S</HI>—is of the
same opinion.</P>
<P>Among these various conjectures, that I
might be informed of the truth, I took
along with me a Physician and a Divine,
the one to inspect the state of its Body,
the other to examine that of its Mind:
The persons I made choice of were the in∣genious
Dr. <HI>P</HI>—and the reverend Mr.—We
were no sooner in the room but the
Party came to us drest in that habit in
which the Ladies affect an Hermophrodi∣tical
imitation of Men—your sharp wit,
my dear Sister, will immediately conclude
that I mean a Riding-habit.</P>
<P>I think it not material to inform you,
whether the Doctor, the Divine, or my
self look'd first. The Priest you will ma∣liciously
fancy was in his nature most an
Infidel, and doubted most of this Miracle:
we therefore propos'd to him to take the
surest method of believing, seeing and feel∣ing:
He comply'd with both admonitions,
and having taken a large pinch of snuff
upon it, advis'd us with a nod, that we
should by no means regard it as a Female
but as a Male, for by so doing we should
be guilty of less sinfulness.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="184"/>
The Doctor upon inspection differ'd
from this opinion, he wou'd by no means
allow it a miracle, or at most a natural one:
He said upon the whole it was a woman;
that whatever might give a handle to think
otherwise, was a trifle, nothing being more
common than for a child to be mark'd
with that thing which the mother long'd
for.</P>
<P>As for this Party's temper of mind, it
appears to be a most even disposition, par∣taking
of the good qualities of both sexes:
for she is neither so inaccessible as other
Ladies, nor is he so impudent as other
Gentlemen. Of how obliging and com∣plaisant
a turn appears by this, that he
tells the Ladies he has the Inclinations
of a Gentleman, and that she tells the
Gentlemen she has the <HI>Tendre</HI> of a La∣dy.
As a further proof of this affable dis∣position,
he formerly received visits of the
fair sex in their masques, till an imperti∣nent
fellow in a female disguise mingled
with a party of ladies, and impudently
overheard their improving Speculations.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, she civilly promi∣sed
at my request, that my two sisters
should be admitted privately whenever you
wou'd do her the honour of your considera∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="185"/>
How agreeable soever this sight has been
to me, I assure you it cannot be so plea∣sing
as the sight of you in town, and what∣ever
you may see in the country, I dare
affirm no man or woman can shew you the
like.</P>
<P>I therefore earnestly desire you to make
haste to this place; for tho' indeed like
most other brothers, I should be sorry you
were married at my expence, yet I would
by no means, like them, detain you in the
country from your admirers, for you may
believe me, no brother in the world ever
lov'd a sister as I do you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>Bath, 1714.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are to understand, Madam, that
my passion for your fair self and your
sister, has been divided with the most won∣derful
regularity in the world. Even from
my infancy I have been in love with one
after the other of you, week by week, and
my journey to <HI>Bath</HI> fell out in the three
hundred seventy sixth week of the Reign
of my Sovereign Lady <HI>Sylvia.</HI> At the
<PB N="181" REF="186"/>
present writing hereof it is the three hun∣dred
eighty ninth week of the Reign of
your most Serene Majesty, in whose service
I was listed some weeks before I beheld
your Sister. This information will account
for my writing to either of you hereafter,
as either shall happen to be Queen-Regent
at that time.</P>
<P>Pray tell your sister, all the good qua∣lities
and virtuous inclinations she has,
never gave me so much pleasure in her
conversation, as that one vice of her ob∣stinacy
will give me mortification this
month. <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> commands her to the <HI>Bath,</HI>
and she refuses! indeed if I were in <HI>Berk∣shire</HI>
I should honour her for this obstina∣cy,
and magnify her no less for disobedi∣ence
than we do the <HI>Barcelonians.</HI> But
people change with the change of places
(as we see of late) and virtues become vi∣ces
when they cease to be for one's interest,
with me, as with others.</P>
<P>Yet let me tell her, she will never look
so finely while she is upon earth, as she
would here in the water. It is not here
as in most other instances, for those Ladies
that would please extremely, must go <HI>out</HI>
of their own element. She does not make
half so good a figure on horseback as <HI>Chri∣stina</HI>
Queen of <HI>Sweden;</HI> but were she once
seen in the Bath, no man wou'd part with
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>
her for the best Mermaid in christendom.
You know I have seen you often, I perfectly
know how you look in black and in white;
I have experienc'd the utmost you can do
in colours; but all your movements, all
your graceful steps, deserve not half the
glory you might here attain, of a moving
and easy behaviour in <HI>Buckram:</HI> Some∣thing
between swimming and walking, free
enough, and more modestly-half-naked,
than you can appear any where else. You
have conquer'd enough already by land;
show your ambition, and vanquish also by
water. We have no pretty Admirals on
these Seas, but must strike sails to your
white Flags, were they once hoisted up.
The Buckram I mention is a dress particu∣larly
useful at this time, when we are told
the Princess is bringing over the fashion of
<HI>German</HI> Ruffs: You ought to use your selves
to some degrees of stiffness beforehand.
And when our Ladies chins have been
tickled a while with starch'd muslin and
wire, they may possibly bear the brush of
a <HI>German</HI> beard and whisker.</P>
<P>I cou'd tell you a delightful story of
Dr. <HI>P.</HI> but want room to display it in all its
shining circumstances. He had heard it
was an excellent cure for Love, to kiss the
Aunt of the person beloved, who is gene∣rally
of years and experience enough to
<PB N="183" REF="188"/>
damp the fiercest flame: he try'd this course
in his passion, and kiss'd Mrs. <HI>E</HI>—at
Mr. D—'s, but he says it will not do,
and that he loves you as much as ever.</P>

<P>IF you ask how the waters agree with
me, I must tell you, so very well, that
I question how you and I should agree if
we were in a room by our selves? Mrs. <HI>T.</HI>
has honestly assured me, that but for some
whims which she can't entirely conquer, she
would go and see the world with me in man's
cloaths. Even you, <HI>Madam,</HI> I fancy (if
you wou'd not partake in our Adventures)
would wait our coming in at the evening
with some impatience, and be well enough
pleas'd to hear 'em by the fire-side. That
would be better than reading Romances,
unless Lady <HI>M.</HI> would be our Historian;
for as she is married, she has probably lei∣sure
hours in the night-time, to write or
do what she will in. What raises these
desires in me, is an acquaintance I am be∣ginning
<PB N="184" REF="189"/>
with my Lady <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who has
all the spirit of the last age, and all the
gay experience of a pleasurable life. It
were as scandalous an omission to come to
the <HI>Bath</HI> and not to see my Lady <HI>Sand∣wich,</HI>
as it had formerly been to have tra∣vell'd
to <HI>Rome</HI> without visiting the Queen
of <HI>Sweden.</HI> She is, in a word, the best
thing this Country has to boast of; and as
she has been all that a woman of spirit
could be, so she still continues that easy
and independent creature that a sensible
woman always will be.</P>
<P>I must tell you a truth, which is not
however much to my credit. I never
thought so much of your self and your
sister, as since I have been fourscore
miles distance from you. In the Forest I
look'd upon you as good neighbours, at
<HI>London</HI> as pretty kind of women, but here
as divinities, angels, goddesses, or what you
will. In the same manner I never knew at
what a rate I valu'd your life, till you were
upon the point of dying. If Mrs. <HI>T.</HI> and
you will but fall very sick every season, I
shall certainly die for you. Seriously I
value you both so much that I esteem
others much the less for your sakes;
you have robb'd me of the pleasure of
esteeming a thousand pretty qualities in
them, by showing me so many finer in
<PB N="185" REF="190"/>
your selves. There are but two things in
the world which could make you indifferent
to me, which I believe you are not capa∣ble
of, I mean Ill-nature and malice. I
have seen enough of you not to overlook
any Frailty you cou'd have, and nothing
less than a Vice can make me like you less.
I expect you should discover by my con∣duct
towards you both, that this is true,
and that therefore you should pardon a
thousand things in me for that one dis∣position.
Expect nothing from me but
truths and freedom, and I shall always be
thought by you what I always am,</P>

<P>I Return'd home as slow and as contem∣plative
after I had parted from you, as
my Lord—retired from the Court
and Glory to his Country seat and Wife,
a week ago. I found here a dismal des∣ponding
letter from the son of another
<PB N="186" REF="191"/>
great Courtier who expects the same fate,
and who tells me the great one's of the
earth will now take it very kindly of the
mean one's, if they will favour them with
a visit by Day-light. With what Joy wou'd
they lay down all their schemes of glory,
did they but know you have the generosity
to drink their healths once a day, as soon
as they are fallen? Thus the unhappy by
the sole merit of their misfortunes, become
the care of heaven and you. I intended to
have put this last into Verse, but in this
age of Ingratitude my best friends forsake
me, I mean my rhymes.</P>
<P>I desire Mrs. <HI>P</HI>—to stay her stomach

from me but That of <HI>my Life,</HI> which I
am still, as I have been, contriving all pos∣sible
methods to shorten, for the greater
ease both of my Historian and the Reader.
May she believe all the passion and tender∣ness
express'd in these Romances to be but
a faint image of what I bear her, and may
you (who read nothing) take the same
truth upon hearing it from me; you will
both injure me very much, if you don't
think me a truer friend than ever any ro∣mantick

expected nothing better from my lips:
And truly 'tis not a sign two Lovers are to∣gether,
when they can be so impertinent

<P>The Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> has behaved so
bravely, that in this act at least he might
seem above Man, if he had not just now
voided a Stone to prove him subject to hu∣man
infirmities. The utmost weight of
affliction from princely power and popu∣lar
hatred, were almost worth bearing, for
the glory of such a dauntless conduct as
he has shewn under it.</P>

the gallant sights of armies, incampments,
standards waving over your brother's corn∣fields,

men. Your barbarity, which I have heard
so long exclaim'd against in town and coun∣try,
may have its fill of destruction. I
would not add one circumstance usual in
all descriptions of calamity, that of the
many Rapes committed or to be commit∣ted,

<P>I Will not describe <HI>Bl</HI>—in particular,
not to forestall your expectations before
you see it: Only take a short account,
which I will hazard my little credit is no
unjust one. I never saw so great a thing
with so much littleness in it: I think the
Architect built it entirely in compliance to
the taste of its Owners: for it is the most
inhospitable thing imaginable, and the most
selfish: it has, like their own hearts, no
room for strangers, and no reception for
any person of superior quality to themselves.
<PB N="191" REF="196"/>
There are but just two Apartments, for the
Master and Mistress, below; and but two
apartments above, (very much inferior to
them) in the whole House. When you
look upon the Outside, you'd think it large
enough for a Prince; when you see the
Inside, it is too little for a Subject; and
has not conveniency to lodge a common
family. It is a house of Entries and Pas∣sages;
among which there are three Vi∣sta's
through the whole, very uselessly hand∣some.
There is what might have been a
fine Gallery, but spoil'd by two Arches
towards the End of it, which take away
the sight of several of the windows. There
are two ordinary stair-cases instead of
one great one. The best things within
the house, are the Hall, which is indeed
noble and well-proportion'd; and the
cellars and offices under-ground, which
are the most commodious, and the best
contrived, of the whole. At the top of
the building are several Cupola's and
little Turrets that have but an ill effect,
and make the building look at once fini∣cal
and heavy. What seems of the best
taste, is that Front towards the gardens,
which is not yet loaded with these tur∣rets.
The two Sides of the building are
intirely spoil'd by two monstrows bow-windows
<PB N="192" REF="197"/>
which stand just in the middle▪
instead of doors: And as if it were fatal
that some trifling littleness should every
where destroy the grandeur, there are in
the chief front two semi circles of a lower
structure than the rest, that cut off the
angles, and look as if they were purposely
design'd to hide a loftier and nobler piece
of building, the top of which appears a∣bove
them. In a word, the whole is a
most expensive absurdity; and the Duke
of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> gave a true character of it,
when he said, it was a great <HI>Quarry of Stones

<P>First then I went by water to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI>
unattended by all but my own

For I met the Prince with all his
Ladies on horseback, coming from hunt∣ing.
Mrs. <HI>B</HI>—and Mrs. <HI>L</HI>—took
me into protection (contrary to the laws
against harbouring Papists) and gave me
a dinner, with something I lik'd better, an
opportunity of conversation with Mrs. <HI>H</HI>—We
all agreed that the life of a Maid of
<PB N="194" REF="199"/>
Honour, was of all things the most mise∣rable;
and wish'd that every woman who
envy'd it had a specimen of it. To eat
<HI>Westphalia</HI>-Ham in a morning, ride over
hedges and ditches on borrow'd Hacks,
come home in the heat of the day with
a feaver, and (what is worse a hundred
times) with a red mark in the forehead
from an uneasy hat; all this may qualify
them to make excellent wives for Fox-hunters,
and bear abundance of ruddy-complexion'd
children. As soon as they
can wipe off the sweat of the day, they
must simper an hour and catch cold, in
the Princess's apartment; from thence <HI>(as
Shakespear</HI> has it) <HI>To dinner with what ap∣petite
they may</HI>—and after that, 'till mid∣night,
walk, work, or think, which they
please? I can easily believe, no lone-house
in <HI>Wales,</HI> with a Mountain and a Rooke∣ry,
is more contemplative than this Court;
and as a proof of it I need only tell
you, Mrs. <HI>L</HI>—walk'd all alone with me
three or four Hours by moonlight, and
we met no creature of any Quality but
the King, who gave audience to the Vice-Chamberlain,
all alone, under the garden-wall.</P>
<P>In short, I heard of no Ball, Assembly,
Basset-Table, or any place where two or
three were gathered together, except Ma∣dam
<PB N="195" REF="200"/>
<HI>Kilmansegg</HI>'s, to which I had the ho∣nour
to be invited, and the grace to stay
away.</P>
<P>I was heartily tired, and posted to <HI>B</HI>—Park:
there we had an excellent Discourse
of Quackery; Dr. <HI>Shadwell</HI> was mentioned
with honour. Lady <HI>A.</HI> walked a whole
hour abroad without dying after it, at
least in the time I stay'd, tho' she seem'd
to be fainting, and had convulsive motions
several times in her head.</P>
<P>This day I receiv'd a Letter with certain
advices where women were to be met with
at <HI>Oxford.</HI> I defy them and all their works:
I love no meat but Ortolans, and no wo∣man
but you: tho' indeed that's no pro∣per
comparison, but for fat Dutchess's;
for to love You, is as if one should wish
to eat Angels, or to drink Cherubim∣broth.</P>
<P>I arrived in the forest by <HI>Tuesday</HI> noon,
having fled from the face (I wish I could
say the horned face) of <HI>Moses B—,</HI> who
dined in the mid-way thither. I past the
rest of the day in those Woods where I
have so often enjoy'd a Book and a Friend.
I made a Hymn as I pass'd thro', which
ended with a sigh that I will not tell you
the meaning of.</P>
<P>Your Doctor is gone the way of all his
patients, and was hard put to it how to
<PB N="196" REF="201"/>

and splendidly unuseful to him. Sir <HI>Sa∣muel
Garth</HI> says, that for <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> to leave
a Library, was as if a Eunuch should found
a Seraglio. Dr. <HI>Sh</HI>—lately told a Lady

two reasons, because Dr. <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> was

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Same.</HEAD>
<P>NOthing could have more of that me∣lancholy
which once used to please
me, than my last days journey; for after ha∣ving
pass'd through my favourite Woods in
the forest, with a thousand Reveries of past
pleasures: I rid over hanging hills, whose tops
were edged with Groves, and whose Feet
water'd with winding rivers, listning to the
falls of Cataracts below, and the murmur∣ing
of the winds above: The gloomy ver∣dure
of <HI>Stonor</HI> succeeded to these; and
then the shades of the evening overtook
<PB N="197" REF="202"/>
me. The Moon rose in the clearest sky I
ever saw, by whose solemn light I paced on
slowly, without company, or any interrup∣tion
to the range of my thoughts. About
a mile before I reach'd <HI>Oxford,</HI> all the
bells toll'd in different notes; the clocks
of every colledge answer'd one another;
and sounded forth (some in a deeper, some
a softer tone) that it was eleven at night.
All this was no ill preparation to the life
I have led since, among those old walls,
venerable galleries, stone portico's, studious
walks, and solitary scenes of the Univer∣sity.
I wanted nothing but a black gown
and a salary, to be as meer a bookworm as
any there. I conform'd my self to the Col∣lege
hours, was roll'd up in books, lay in
one of the most ancient, dusky parts of the
University, and was as dead to the world as
any Hermit of the desart. If any thing was
alive or awake in me, it was a little Vanity;
such as even those good men us'd to enter∣tain,
when the Monks <HI>of their own Order</HI>
extoll'd their piety and abstraction. For I
found my self receiv'd with a sort of respect,
which this idle part of mankind, the learn∣ed,
pay to their own species; who are as
considerable here, as the busy, the gay, and
the ambitious are in your world.</P>
<P>Indeed I was treated in such a manner,
that I could not but sometimes ask my self
<PB N="198" REF="203"/>
in my mind, what College I was founder
of, or what Library I had built? Methinks
I do very ill to return to the world again, to
leave the only place where I make a figure,
and from seeing my self seated with dignity
in the most conspicuous shelves of a libra∣ry,
put my self into the abject posture
of lying at a Lady's feet in St. <HI>James</HI>'s
Square.</P>
<P>I will not deny, but that like <HI>Alexander,</HI>
in the midst of my glory I am wounded,
and find my self a meer man. To tell you
from whence the dart comes, is to no pur∣pose,
since neither of you will take the ten∣der
care to draw it out of my heart, and
suck the poyson with your lips.</P>
<P>Here, at my Lord <HI>H</HI>—'s, I see a crea∣ture
nearer an angel than a woman, (tho' a
woman be very near as good as an angel;) I
think you have formerly heard me mention
Mrs. <HI>T</HI>—as a credit to the Maker of An∣gels;
she is a relation of his Lordship's, and
he gravely propos'd her to me for a Wife;
being tender of her Interests, and knowing
(what is a shame to Providence) that she is
less indebted to Fortune than I, I told him
'twas what he could never have thought of,
if it had not been his misfortune to be blind,
and what I never could think of, while I
had eyes to see both her and my self.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="204"/>
I must not conclude without telling you,
that I will do the utmost in the affair you
desire. It would be an inexpressible joy
to me if I could serve you, and I will always
do all I can to give my self pleasure. I wish
as well for you as for my self; I am in love
with you both much as I am with my self,
for I find my self most so with all three,
when I least suspect it.</P>

<P>YOU are by this time satisfy'd how

thousand. And by this time, the Gentle∣man
you have made choice of is sensible,
how great is the joy of having all those
charms and good qualities which have
pleas'd so many, now apply'd to please one

<P>It may be expected perhaps, that one

more polite on this occasion: But
I am really more a well-wisher to your

Besides, you are now a married woman,
and in a way to be a great many better

wife, a faithful friend, a tender parent,
and at last as the consequence of them all,
a saint in heaven. You ought now to hear

<P>THE chief cause I have to repent my
leaving the town, is the uncertainty
I am in every day of your Sister's state of
health. I really expected by every post
to have heard of her recovery, but on
the contrary each letter has been a new
awakening to my apprehensions, and I
have ever since suffer'd alarms upon alarms
on her account. No one can be more
sensibly touch'd at this than I; nor any
danger of any I love cou'd affect me with
more uneasiness, (tho' as I never had a
sister I can't be quite so good a judge as
you, how far humanity wou'd carry me)
I have felt some weaknesses of a tender
kind, which I would not be free from,
and I am glad to find my value for people
so rightly plac'd, as to perceive them on
this occasion.</P>
<P>I cannot be so good a christian as to
be willing (tho' no less than God should
order it) to resign my own happiness here
for hers in another life. I do more than
wish for her safety, for every wish I make
I find immediately chang'd into a prayer,
<PB N="202" REF="207"/>
and a more servent one than I had learn'd
to make till now.</P>
<P>May her Life be longer and happier
than perhaps her self may desire, that is,
as long and as happy as your self can wish:
May her Beauty be as great as possible,
that is, as it always was, or as yours is:
but whatever ravages a merciless distem∣per
may commit, I dare promise her bold∣ly,
what few (if any) of her makers of
visits and complements dare to do; she
shall have one man as much her admi∣rer

you have shewn upon this occa∣sion.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with infinite satisfaction I am
made acquainted that your brother
will at last prove your relation, and has en∣tertain'd
such sentiments as become him
in your concern. I have been prepar'd
for this by degrees, having several times re∣ceiv'd
from Mrs.—that which is one
of the greatest pleasures, the knowledge
<PB N="203" REF="208"/>
that others enter'd into my own sentiments
concerning you. I ever was of opinion that
you wanted no more to be vindicated than to
be known; and like Truth, cou'd appear
no where but you must conquer. As I
have often condol'd with you in your ad∣versities,
so I have a right which but few
can pretend to, of congratulating on the
prospect of your better fortunes; and I
hope for the future to have the concern I
have felt for you overpaid in your felici∣ties.
Tho' you modestly say the world has
left you, yet I verily believe it is coming
to you again as fast as it can: For to give
the world its due, it is always very fond
of Merit when 'tis past its power to op∣pose
it. Therefore if you should take it
into favour again upon its repentance, and
continue in it, you would do so far from
leading what is commonly call'd an un∣settled
life; (and what you with too much
unjust severity call a Vagabond Life,) that
the wise could only look upon you as a
Prince in a progress, who travels to gain
the affections he has not, or to fix those
he already has; which he effectually does
wherever he shews himself. But if you are
resolv'd in revenge to rob the world of so
much example as you may afford it, I be∣lieve
your design will be vain; for even in
a Monastery your devotions cannot carry
<PB N="204" REF="209"/>
you so far toward the next world as to
make This lose the sight of you, but you'll
be like a Star, that while it is fix'd to Hea∣ven
shines over all the Earth.</P>
<P>Wheresoever Providence shall dispose of
the most valuable thing I know, I shall
ever follow you with my sincerest wishes,
and my best thoughts will be perpetually
waiting upon you, when you never hear of
me or them. Your own guardian Angels
cannot be more constant, nor more si∣lent.
I beg you will never cease to think
me your friend, that you may not be
guilty of that which you never yet knew
to commit, an Injustice. As I have hither∣to
been so in spite of the world, so here∣after,
if it be possible you shou'd ever be
more opposed, and more deserted, I should
only be so much the more</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>I Can say little to recommend the Let∣ters
I shall write to you, but that they
will be the most impartial representations
of a free heart, and the truest copies you
ever saw, tho' of a very mean original.
Not a feature will be soften'd, or any ad∣vantagious
light employ'd to make the ugly
thing a little less hideous: but you shall
find it in all respects, most horribly like.
You will do me an injustice if you look
upon any thing I shall say from this in∣stant,
as a compliment, either to you or
to my self: Whatever I write will be the
real thought of that hour; and I know
you'll no more expect it of me to perse∣vere
till death in every sentiment or no∣tion
I now set down, than you would ima∣gine
a man's face should never change when
once his picture was drawn.</P>
<P>The freedom I shall use in this manner
of <HI>thinking aloud,</HI> may indeed prove me a
fool; but it will prove me one of the best
sort of fools, the honest ones. And since
what folly we have, will infallibly buoy up
<PB N="206" REF="211"/>
at one time or other in spight of all our
art to keep it down; methinks 'tis almost
foolish to take any pains to conceal it at
all, and almost knavish to do it from those
that are our friends. If <HI>Momus</HI>'s project had
taken, of having windows in our breasts,
I shou'd be for carrying it further, and
making those windows, cafements; that
while a man show'd his heart to all the
world, he might do something more for
his friends, even give it them, and trust it
to their handling. I think I love you as
well as King <HI>Herod</HI> did <HI>Herodias</HI> (tho' I
never had so much as one dance with you)
and would as freely give you my heart in
a dish, as he did another's head. But since
<HI>Jupiter</HI> will not have it so, I must be con∣tent
to shew my taste in life, as I do my
taste in painting, by loving to have as lit∣tle
drapery as possible. Not that I think
every body naked altogether so fine a sight,
as your self and a few more would be;
but because 'tis good to use people to what
they must be acquainted with; and there
will certainly come some day of judgment
or other, to uncover every soul of us. We
shall then see that the <HI>Prudes</HI> of this
world ow'd all their fine figure only to
their being straiter-lac'd than the rest; and
that they are naturally as arrant Squabs as
those that went more loose, nay as those
<PB N="207" REF="212"/>
that never girded their loins at all.—But
a particular reason that may engage you
to write your thoughts the more freely to
me, is, that I am confident no one knows
you better; for I find, when others express
their thoughts of you, they fall very short
of mine, and I know at the same time
theirs are such as you would think suf∣ficiently
in your favour.</P>
<P>You may easily imagine how desirous
I must be of a correspondence with a per∣son,
who had taught me long ago that it
was as possible to esteem at first sight, as
to love: and who has since ruin'd me
for all the conversation of one sex, and
almost all the friendship of the other. I am
but too sensible thro' your means, that the
company of men wants a certain softness
to recommend it, and that of women
wants every thing else. How often have
I been quietly going to take possession of
that tranquility and indolence I had so
long found in the country; when one
evening of your conversation has spoil'd me
for a <HI>Solitaire!</HI> Books have lost their ef∣fect
upon me, and I was convinced since
I saw you, that there is one alive wiser
than all the Sages: a plague of female wis∣dom!
it makes a man ten times more un∣easy
than his own. What is very strange,
Virtue herself, (when you have the dres∣sing
<PB N="208" REF="213"/>
her) is too amiable for one's repose.
You might have done a world of good in
your time, if you had allow'd half the fine
gentlemen who have seen you to have con∣versed
with you; they would have been
strangely Bitt, while they thought only to
fall in love with a fair Lady, and you had
bewitch'd them with Reason and Virtue
(two Beauties that the very fops pretend to
no acquaintance with.)</P>
<P>The unhappy distance at which we cor∣respond,
removes a great many of those
restrictions and punctilious decorums, that
oftentimes in nearer conversation prejudice
truth, to save good breeding. I may now
hear of my faults, and you of your good
qualities, without a blush; we converse
upon such unfortunate generous terms, as
exclude the regards of fear, shame, or
design, in either of us. And methinks it
would be as paltry a part, to impose (even
in a single thought) upon each other in
this state of separation, as for Spirits of a
different sphere who have so little inter∣course
with us, to employ that little (as
some would make us think they do) in
putting tricks and delusions upon poor
mortals.</P>
<P>Let me begin then, Madam, by asking
you a question, that may enable me to
judge better of my own conduct than most
<PB N="281" REF="214"/>
instances of my Life. In what manner
did I behave the last hour I saw you?
What degree of concern did I discover
when I felt a misfortune which I hope
you will never feel, that of parting from
what one most esteems? for if my part∣ing
look'd but like that of your common
acquaintance, I am the greatest of all the
hypocrites that ever Decency made.</P>
<P>I never since pass by your house but
with the same sort of melancholy that
we feel upon seeing the Tomb of a friend,
which only serves to put us in mind of
what we have lost. I reflect upon the
circumstances of your departure which I
was there a witness of (your behaviour in
what I may call your last moments) and
I indulge a gloomy kind of pleasure in
thinking that those last moments were
given to me. I would fain imagine this
was not accidental, but proceeded from a
penetration which I know you have, in
finding out the truth of people's senti∣ments;
and that you were willing, the last
man that <HI>would have</HI> parted from you,
should be that last that <HI>did.</HI> I really look'd
upon you just as the friends of <HI>Curtius</HI>
might have done upon that Hero, at the
instant when he was devoting himself to
Glory, and running to be lost out of ge∣nerosity.
I was oblig'd to admire your re∣solution,
<PB N="282" REF="215"/>
in as great a degree as I deplo∣red
it; and had only to wish, that hea∣ven
would reward so much Virtue as was
to be taken from us, with all the felicities
it could enjoy elsewhere!</P>

<P>YOU will find me more troublesome

I shall meet you in more places than
one, and often refresh your memory be∣fore
you arrive at your <HI>Philippi.</HI> These
shadows of me (my letters) will be haunt∣ing
you from time to time, and putting
you in mind of the man who has really
suffer'd very much from you, and whom
you have robb'd of the most valuable of
his enjoyments, your conversation. The
advantage of hearing your sentiments by
discovering mine, was what I always
thought a great one, and even worth the
risque I generally run of manifesting my
own indiscretion. You then rewarded my
trust in you the moment it was given,
<PB N="283" REF="216"/>
for you pleas'd or inform'd me the minute
you answer'd. I must now be contented
with more slow returns. However 'tis
some pleasure, that your thoughts upon
Paper will be a more lasting possession to
me, and that I shall no longer have cause
to complain of a loss I have so often re∣gretted,
that of any thing you said, which
I happen'd to forget. In earnest, Madam,
if I were to write to you as often as I
think of you, it must be every day of my
life. I attend you in spirit thro' all your
ways, I follow you thro' every stage in
books of Travels, and fear for you thro'
whole folio's; you make me shrink at the
past dangers of dead travellers; and if I
read of a delightful prospect, or agreeable
place, I hope it yet subsists to please you.
I enquire the roads, the amusements, the
company, of every town and country thro'
which you pass, with as much diligence
as if I were to set out next week to over∣take
you. In a word, no one can have
you more constantly in mind, not even
your guardian Angel (if you have one) and
I am willing to indulge so much Popery,
as to fancy some Being takes care of you,
who knows your value better than you do
your self: I am willing to think that hea∣ven
never gave so much self-neglect and
resolution to a woman, to occasion her
<PB N="284" REF="217"/>
calamity, but am pious enough to believe
those qualities must be intended to conduce
to her benefit and her glory.</P>
<P>Your first short letter only serves to
show me you are alive: it puts me in
mind of the first Dove that return'd to
<HI>Noah,</HI> and just made him know it had
found no rest abroad.</P>
<P>There is nothing in it that pleases me,
but when you tell me you had no Sea-sickness.
I beg your next may give me
all the pleasure it can, that is, tell me
any that you receive. You can make no
discoveries that will be half so valuable to
me as those of your own mind: Nothing
that regards the States or Kingdoms you
pass thro', will engage so much of my curi∣osity
or concern, as what relates to your
self: Your welfare, to say truth, is more
at my heart than that of Christendom.</P>
<P>I am sure I may defend the truth, tho'
perhaps not the virtue, of this declaration.
One is ignorant, or doubtful at best, of
the Merits of differing religions and go∣vernments:
but private virtues one can be
sure of. I therefore know what particu∣lar
person has desert enough to merit be∣ing
happier than others, but not what
Nation deserves to conquer or oppress an∣other.
You will say, I am not <HI>Publick-spirited;</HI>
let it be so, I may have too ma∣ny
<PB N="285" REF="218"/>
tendernesses, particular regards, or nar∣row
views; but at the same time I am
certain that whoever wants these, can ne∣ver
have a <HI>Publick-spirit;</HI> for (as a friend
of mine says) how is it possible for that
man to love twenty thousand people, who
never loved one?</P>
<P>I communicated your letter to Mr.<HI>C</HI>—he
thinks of you and talks of you as he
ought, I mean as I do, and one always
thinks that to be just as it ought. His
health and mine are now so good, that
we wish with all our souls you were a
witness of it. We never meet but we la∣ment
over you: we pay a kind of week∣ly
rites to your memory, where we strow
flowers of rhetorick, and offer such liba∣tions
to your name as it would be pro∣phane
to call <HI>Toasting.</HI> The Duke of
<HI>B—m</HI> is sometimes the High Priest
of your praises; and upon the whole, I
believe there are as few Men that are not
sorry at your departure, as Women that
are; for you know most of your Sex want
good sense, and therefore must want ge∣nerosity:
You have so much of both, that
I am sure you pardon them; for one can∣not
but forgive whatever one despises. For
my part I hate a great many women for
your sake, and undervalue all the rest.</P>
<P>'Tis you are to blame, and may God re∣venge
<PB N="286" REF="219"/>
it upon you, with all those blessings
and earthly prosperities which the Divines
tell us are the cause of our Perdition;
