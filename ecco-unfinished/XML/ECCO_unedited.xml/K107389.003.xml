<P>THE

OF
WILLIAM SHENSTONE, Es{que}
VOL. III.</P>
<P>CONTAINING
LETTERS to particular FRIENDS, from the

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Character of Mr.
SHENSTONE is too well known, and
his Reputation as a Writer too firmly esta∣blished,
to require any further commenda∣tion,
yet it may perhaps be expected that
some apology should be made for this Ad∣ditional
Volume of his Works, containing
Familiar Letters to some of his most in∣timate
Friends.</P>
<P>To those who may think such an apo∣logy
requisite, it might be sufficient to say,
that the reception which the former Vo∣lumes
have met with, affords the strongest
reason to believe that an addition to them
would be very acceptable to the Public;
and that the Author's talent in <HI>epistolary</HI>
writing appears not to have been inferior to
that which distinguishes his other compo∣sitions.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
BUT it may be objected, that, whatever
their merit may be, <HI>Letters,</HI> not intended
for the Public, ought not to be published;
and that an act of this kind is a violation of
Private Friendship.</P>
<P>THIS objection, it must be confessed, car∣ries
with it such an air of delicacy, that the
persons here concerned are very willing to
give it all due attention. At the same time
they cannot but observe, that it will not
hold in all cases, and therefore must un∣avoidably
be subject to some limitations—
that these limitations must vary, as the cir∣cumstances
of cases happen to vary—and
that not to make proper allowances for such
circumstances is highly unreasonable—in∣jurious
to many who have deserved well of
the Public by this very conduct, and detri∣mental
to the interests of Literature. It
might perhaps be difficult, and is by no
means necessary, to enumerate these several
limitations. It will be sufficient in this
place to say, that where neither the repu∣tation
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
of the Writer, nor that of any other
person, is injured, there the force of the
objection evidently ceases. And it is not
only believed, on the most mature delibera∣tion,
that this is the case in the present in∣stance;
but moreover that there are positive
good reasons in its favour, respecting as
well the Writer's character in this <HI>species</HI> of
composition, as the satisfaction and enter∣tainment
of the Reader.</P>
<P>THE encouragement which has been
usually given to Works of this nature
might seem to make these observations un∣necessary!
But it was not thought sufficient
barely to shelter this publication under the
sanction of such an authority; as it is well
known that the wantonness of curiosity has
sometimes encouraged designs by no means
justifiable: and it is as readily acknowledg∣ed
that the following Letters are deficient
in many particulars requisite to excite that
curiosity, being neither written on popular
subjects, nor addressed to persons of rank
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
and eminence in the world. They will not
fail however to afford an agreeable enter∣tainment
to such as can relish an animated
display of the various efforts of a fine Ima∣gination
for a length of years, whether
amusing itself with rural embellishments, or
occupied in other pleasures of learned re∣tirement,
and a warm disinterested friend∣ship.
Such are the subjects of the follow∣ing
Letters! and if any person should still
retain a doubt concerning the propriety of
perpetuating them in this manner, he shall
be finally referred to the Writer's own au∣thority,
who, in a letter dated October 23,
1754, thus expresses himself:</P>
<P>“I CONFESS to you that I am considera∣bly
mortified by Mr. W—'s conduct in
regard to those Letters (meaning his own
letters to that gentleman's brother); and,
rather than they should have been so un∣necessarily destroyed, would have given
more money than it is allowable for me
to mention with decency. I look upon
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
my Letters as some of my <HI>chef-d'oeuvres;</HI>
and could I be supposed to have the smal∣lest
pretensions to propriety of style or sen∣timent,
I should imagine it must appear
principally in my Letters to his brother,
and one or two more friends. I consider
them as the records of a friendship that
will be always dear to me, and as the
history of my mind for these twenty years
past.”</P>
<P>WHEN it is considered how seldom so
valuable a collection of real correspondence
is to be met with, and how difficult it is to
supply the want of it by a fictitious one, it
cannot be doubted that the Public will be
pleased to see the loss here complained of so
well repaired, and to be furnished with such
genuine examples of the Author's style and
sentiments, together with an authentic history
of his mind, for so long a space of time.</P>
<P>To conclude: The talents of this Au∣thor,
on whatever subject they were exercised,
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
were so uncommon, and the fame of his lit∣tle
<HI>Ferme ornée,</HI> under the conduct of a taste
entirely original, was become so considerable,
that every specimen of the one, and every
anecdote relative to the improvement of the
other, seemed too interesting to be buried
in oblivion: at least, they were thought so
by those to whom the <HI>greater</HI> part of this
Collection is addressed:—persons indeed
confessedly partial to the Writer's talents,
and interested in his commendations; but
at the same time persons neither so regard∣less
of their Friend's reputation, nor their
own, as to have hazarded either, without
the strongest persuasion that their partiality
had not imposed upon their judgement;
and that it was no indecent ostentation in
them, by this public act, to testify, that
they esteemed it not only a peculiar felicity
in their fortunes, but likewise some degree
of credit, to have enjoyed the pleasures of
such a Friendship throughout so considerable
a period of human life.</P>

LETTERS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I. To Mr. JAGO, with a Song, and the Author's
Sentiments on Musical Composition.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>1739.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my head is considerably more confused than
usual, by reason of a bad cold, I shall aim no
higher in this letter than at bare <HI>recitative,</HI> reserving
all my <HI>airs</HI> for a season when my mind is more in <HI>tune.</HI>
Such, I hope, will be the time which you set apart to
attend the <HI>chief musician,</HI> at Birmingham. I thorough∣ly
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
design to lend an <HI>ear</HI> to <HI>his</HI> performance, on condi∣tion
he will not refuse one to a proposal I intend to
make, of having, one day or other, a merry strain as
The Leasowes. But if you have any <HI>penchant</HI> to see
the face of your humble servant at Birmingham, your
most effectual way will be to inform him when these
solemn nuptials betwixt Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee
are to be consummated. I will, <HI>certes,</HI> not be
absent at the throwing of the stocking, any more
than Parson Evans in Shakespear would be “absence
at the grace.” I have sent a song, not that I am
sure I have not sent it before; but that, if you can
see any joke that it containeth, the fore-mentioned
gentleman may be asked to translate it into music.
When I use this expression, you will, peradventure,
look upon it as my opinion, that in musical compo∣sitions
sound ought as much to answer sense as one
language does another, insomuch, that such and
such thoughts ought to bring into our heads such and
such sounds, and <HI>vice versa.</HI> But in case there is no
sense, and no thought, the more languages a sentence
is translated into, the more 'tis exposed. And in
case it be the misfortune of my little piece to have
neither, I beg that Mr. Marriett may not inform any∣body
what it signifies in music. As a farther proof
of the confused state of my intellects, you see, almost
at the end of my letter, my thanks for the packet,
&amp;c. which ought to have been placed in the very
front of it, in order to express, in some degree, the
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
sense I have of your favours. I long to see you; and
am, dear Sir,</P>
<CLOSER>Your most obedient
and faithful servant,

<HEAD>II. To the same, in the Manner of PAMELA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>1739.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WELL! and so I fat me down in my room,
and was reading <HI>Pamela</HI>—one might furpipenish
this book with several pretty decorations, thought
I to myself; and then I began to design cuts for it,
in particular places. For instance, one, where Pa∣mela
is forced to fall upon her knees in the arbor:
a second, where she is in bed, and Mrs. Jewkes holds
one hand, and Mr. B. the other: a third, where Pa∣mela
sits sewing in the summer-house, &amp;c. So I just
sketched them cut, and sent my little hints, such as
they were, to Mr. R—n. As soon as I had sealed
my letter, in comes Mrs. Arnold<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">His house-keeper, of whom very respectful mention is made in the course of' this correspondence.</NOTE>—“Well, Mrs.
Arnold, says I, this Mr. Jago never comes—what
can one do? I'm as dull as a beetle for want of
company.” “Sir, says she, the hen—” “What
makes you out of breath? says I, Mrs. Arnold;
what's the matter?” “Why, Sir, says she, the
hen that I set last-sabbath-day-was-three-weeks has
just hatched, and has brought all her eggs to
good.” “That's brave indeed, says I.” “Ay, that
it is, says she, so be and't please G—d an how that
they liven, there'll be a glorious parcel of 'em.
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
Shall I bring 'em up for you to see?” says she.
“No, thank ye, Mrs. Arnold, says I; but aren't
ye in some apprehensions from the kite, Mrs.
Arnold?”—“No, Sir, says she, I hope there's no
danger; I <HI>takes</HI> pretty good care of 'em.” “I
don't question your card, says I; for you're seldom
without a duck or a chicken about you.”—“Poor
pretty <HI>ereters!</HI> says she; look here, Master, this has
gotten a speck of black upon her tail.”—“Ay,
I thought you wern't without one about you, says
I—! don't think, says I, Mrs. Arnold, but your
soul was design'd for a hen, originally;” “Why,
and If I <HI>had</HI> been a hen, says she, I believe I should
have done as much for my chickens as yonder
great black-and-white hen does, tho' I say't that
shou'd not say't, said she.” Aye, that you would,
thought I. “Well, but now when Mr. Jago comes,
have you got e'er a chicken that's <HI>fit to kill?</HI>”
“No, says she, I doubt there is ne'er-a-one.”
“Well, says I, Mrs. Arnold, you and your chicken
may go down; I am going to write a letter.” So
I sat down, and wrote thus far: scrattle, scrattle,
goes the pen—why how now? says I—what's the
matter with the pen? So I thought I would make an
end of my letter, because, my pen went scrattle, scrat∣tle.
Well, I warrant I shall have little pleasure
when Mr. Jago <HI>comes;</HI> for I never, fixed my heart
much upon any thing in my life, but some misfor∣tune
happened to balance my pleasure.—After all,
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
thought I, it must be some very ill accident that out∣weighs
the pleasure I shall take in seeing him.</P>

<HEAD>III. To a Friend, too ceremoniously declining to
purchase a Horse for him.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATE>1739.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I CANNOT avoid imagining the first part of your
letter was mere raillery. I am sure it gave me
a good deal of pleasure (for I can bear very well to
hear my foibles exposed, though not my faults), and
on that account must needs make grateful mention
of it. I acknowledge the oddness of the letter which
occasioned it, and could not expect that such an ill-formed
application could have produced an answer
so very oratorical. In the first place, you lay open
the subject, or indeed, what you call the offices in
which I am pleased to employ you. In the next,
you alledge your own inability to enter upon mat∣ters
of such great concernment. That this is rhe∣torical,
nay, pure rhetoric, I gather from the, e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ordiams
of all the declamations that I ever heard in
my life. 'Tis, moreover, not uncommon with de∣claimers
to give some reasons why they should not
absolutely-decline the subject, though they are sen∣sible
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
of their insufficiency (otherwise they might be
expected to sit down, and hold their tongues). And
this is what you have done, by saying that you are
unwilling to dissent from the world in regard to the
subjects you are engaged in; that you, therefore,
chose to steer a middle course, by that means avoid∣ing
the imputation of presumption on the one hand,
and indifference on the other. When this is done,
you enter gravely upon the subject, and, to give it a
greater perspicuity, divide it into two parts. The
first part happens to be “concerning the purchase of
<HI>an</HI> horse,” On this occasion, you inform me, that
I am in a good country for horses; and secondly, that
I have a number of acquaintance round about me,
who are very well skilled in the nature of them. Now
each of these informations seems, at first sight, to
mean no more than what I have better opportunities
of knowing than the person who informs me, and, on
this account, to err in point of superfluity. But,
upon second thoughts, they have <HI>this force</HI> (to speak
like a grammarian); namely, that I am entirely
negligent of my own affairs; and, secondly, that I
care not whom I give trouble to, if I can but avoid
it myself; so that the sentences have really a beauty,
when one searches beneath their superficies. After
you have said this and more, which includes all that
can be said upon the subject, you descend to the se∣cond division, in relation to which I am too grateful
to be otherwise than <HI>serious</HI> in my acknowledge∣ments.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15"/>
I HAD not expatiated thus far, but to shew that I
am not insensible of a fneer; nor should I expatiate
any farther, but to prove that I am equally sensible of
a savour.</P>
<P>I DESIRE you would believe, that I absolutely as∣sent
to your critique: That some of your sentiments
were my own before I communicated the verses; and
others, as soon as you had favoured me with the dis∣covery
of them: That I would, <HI>per praesentes,</HI> return
my thanks for them; which you might justly have
claimed, whether I had approved them or not. One
exception to this approbation my modesty bids me
mention, on account of your too great partiality in
my favour. My gratitude you are entitled to with∣out
exception or limitation.</P>
<P>IT will, perhaps, gratify your curiosity to know,
that Mr. G. has a copy of verses in the last maga∣zine,
entitled, “The little Cur.” There are several
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rokes that are picturesque and humourous; I be∣lieve
it was done in haste. The motto is exequisite,
and much more properly applied by Mr. G. than
the Emperor Adrian, in my opinion, notwithstanding
all that Pope says. Tell me your judgement of Mr.
L—n's in the same paper. The epigram “To
one who refused to walk in the Park, &amp;c.” is a
good one.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16"/>
I HAVE waved sending the verses to Mr. Somervile
at present, because I hope to see you soon either at
The Leasowes or at Birmingham. I cannot tell whether
I shall have time to inclose in this letter my ballad.
If I do, consider it only as some words that I chuse
to make use of to some notes of which I am more than
ordinarily fond<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The tune “Come, and listen to my ditty, &amp;c.” The words founded upon a true history of Queen Elizabeth, who, looking from a castle wherein she was a prisoner, and seeing a country milk-maid singing, expressed great envy at the girl's condition, and dissatisfaction with regard to her own.</NOTE>. It is as much designed for my
own singing (in private I mean) as ever was a bottle
of cherry-brandy for an old woman's drinking.
Now I think of it, I really believe that I every day
approach nearer and nearer to the capacity, the way,
the insignificancy, of an old woman. Mrs. Arnold
has certainly, by her <HI>charms,</HI> her incantations, and
her conversations together, contributed a good deal
to this transformation. Pray come over if you can,
and try to reinstate me in my right mind, in propor∣tion
to the soundness of which I shall be more and
more</P>

<HEAD>IV. To the same, from Town.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
<DATE>1739▪</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I RETURN you my thanks, most heartily, for
the poetical resentment which you have shewn
against my censurers, the Riddle-masters. I have sent
Mr. Somervile's verses and yours to Cave; though
I am ashamed to own I neglected it so long, that, I
fear, he will have no room for them this month. If
you can extirpate false wit in a manner, you will do
no small service to the true: you do no small <HI>honour</HI>
to it, whether you extirpate the other or not.</P>
<P>You have heard of the motion; have heard, pro∣bably,
all that I can tell you of it: That it was ill-concerted;
that it has done the opposition great dis∣service;
that the King is now confirmed in the opi∣nion
of Sir Robert's honesty; that the younger Mr.
Pitt's speech was the most admired on the opposite
side, and Sir R—t's on the court side; that they did
not leave the House till five in the morning; that
Sir R—t and P—y are so violent, that the Sp—r
is continually calling them to order; finally, that the
affair has occasioned this print, which I address to
your curiosity merely, though the lines upon the Bi∣shop
are humourous enough.—Now I mention curio∣sity;
do you take notice of the many quaint con∣trivances
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
made use of to catch peoples natural in∣quisitiveness
in the pamphlets, viz. “Are these
things so?”—“Yes, they are.”—What then?”—
“The devil of a story.”—“Hoy, boys.”—“Up go
we.”—And a thousand others.—What do you
think must be my expence, who love to pry into
every thing of this kind? Why, truly, one shilling.
My company goes to George's Coffee-house, where,
for that small subscription, I read all pamphlets un∣der
a three-shilling dimensions; and, indeed, any
larger ones would not be fit for coffee-house perusal.
—Lord Dudley lent me two sermons, given him at
the House of Lords, which I read last night. In the
first, there are a great many deep animadversions
delivered in a style that is tolerable; in the other,
there is as great a want of common English as there is
plenty of common observations.—Have you seen
the sermons on the Martyrdom and on the Fast-day?
If you read either, send for the first.—You'll find
me degenerate from a gentle bard into a snarling
Critic, if my poem does not please (you'll say I am no
very candid one at present): but let its fate be what
it will, I shall lay no small stress upon the opinion of
some that have approved it. As it is at present <HI>in
keeping,</HI> it discovers no uncommon impudence, and
runs no very great risque; but who can answer for
it, when it has the gracelessness to <HI>come upon the town?
—Ora pro nobis</HI> must soon be my motto. Its vir∣tues
and faults will then be incapable of addition or
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
diminution, and the pious assistance of friends must
—but I am no Roman Catholic.—The intrinsic
merit of a book when it is printed, as well as the
past life and conversation of a man that is departed,
must damn, or give it immortality—I mean, to a
certain degree. I scribble what comes uppermost,
and desire you would do the same.—</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
From Mr. Wintle's, Per∣fumer,
near Temple-Bar,
&amp;c. <DATE>6th Feb. 1740.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now with regard to the <HI>town</HI> pretty much
in the same state in which I expect to be always
with regard to the <HI>world;</HI> sometimes exclaiming and
railing against it; sometimes giving it a good word,
and even admiring it. A sun-shiny day, a tavern∣supper
after a play well acted, and now and then
an invigorating breath of air in the Mall, never fail
of producing a chearful effect. I don't know whe∣ther
I gave you any account of Quin's acting Fal∣staff
in my former letter: I really imagined that I
saw you tittering on one side me, shaking your sides,
and sometimes scarce containing yourself. You will
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
pardon the attitude in which I placed you, since it
was what seemed <HI>natural</HI> at that circumstance of time.
—Comus I have once been at, for the sake of the
songs, though I detest it in any <HI>light:</HI> but as a <HI>dra∣matic</HI>
piece, the <HI>taking</HI> of it seems a <HI>prodigy;</HI> yet in∣deed
<HI>such-a-one,</HI> as was pretty tolerably accounted for
by a gentleman who sat by me in the <HI>boxes.</HI> This
learned sage, being asked how he liked the play, made
answer, “He could not tell—pretty well, he thought
—or indeed as well as any other play—he always
took it, that people only came there to see and to
be seen—for as for what was said, he owned,
he never understood any thing of the matter.”
I told him, I thought a great many of its admirers
were in his case, if they would but own it.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, it is amazing to consider to
what an universality of learning people make pre∣tensions
here. There's not a drawer, a chair or hack∣ney
coach-man, but is politician, poet, and judge of
polite literature. Chimney-sweepers damn the Con∣vention,
and black-shoe-boys cry up the Genius of
Shakespear. “The Danger of writing Verse” is a
very good thing; if you have not read it, I would
recommend it to you as poetical. But now I talk
of Learning, I must not omit an interview which I
accidentally had the other night in company with
Lord D—and one Mr. C—. We were taken to sup
at a private house, where I found a person whom I
had never seen before. The man behaved exceeding
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
modestly and well; till, growing a little merry over
a bottle (and being a little countenanced by the
subject we were upon), he pulls out of his pocket
about half a dozen ballads, and distributes them
amongst the company. I (not finding at first they
were of his own composition) read one over, and,
finding it a dull piece of stuff, contented myself with
observing that it was exceedingly well <HI>printed.</HI> But
to see the man's face on this occasion would make
you pity the circumstance of an author as long as you
live. His jollity ceased (as a flame would do, should
you pour water upon it); and, I believe, for about
five minutes, he spoke not a syllable. At length,
recovering himself, he began to talk about his coun∣try-seat,
about Houghton-Hall, and soon after de∣sired
a health, imagining (as I found afterwards) that
Lord D—would have given Sir Robert's. But he did
not, naming Sir T—L—: mine, which followed,
was that of Mr. L—. Now, who do you think this
should be, but honest Ralph Freeman (at least the
writer of the paper so subscribed), your father's old
friend and intimate, Sir Robert's right-hand, a per∣son
that lives elegantly, drives six of the best horses
in town, and plays on St. John's organ: (you know
Mr. L—is not only Sir Robert's greatest enemy, but
the Gazetteer's proper antagonist.) We were invited
to see him very civilly, and indeed the man behaved

any attempts at wit, which, probably, would not

would say to me, if I should join in the cause with
his old friend, and take a good annuity under Sir
Robert, which, I believe, I might have; and little
encouragement, God knows, have I met with on the
other side of the question. I say, I believe I <HI>might
have,</HI> because I know a certain person gives pensions
of three pounds a-week to porters and the most il∣literate
stupid fellows you can imagine, to talk in
his behalf at ale-houses: where they sit so long a

another.—At least tell him that I expect in
his answer to my letter (which I shall not allow him
to assign to you), he write something to confirm me
in my integrity, and to make me prefer him, and
you, and honesty, to lace, brocade, and the smiles of
the ladies,

<OPENER>My good friend!
From Mr. Wintle's,
<DATE>April 30, 1740.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HEARTILY thank you for the service your
letter did me; and a considerable service, no
doubt, it <HI>is,</HI> to raise the spirits of a person so habi∣tually
dispirited as I have been for some time. For
this, and all former favours, as the sullen fellow says
in Shakespear, “I thank you; I am not of many
words, but I thank you.”</P>
<P>I BEG you would cease to apologize for your let∣ters:
In the first place, it will lay <HI>me</HI> under a necessity
of doing <HI>so;</HI> and, in the next place, you may be as∣sured,
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
that no friendly letter of yours will ever be
otherwise than infinitely agreeable to me.</P>
<P>I SENT a letter to Mr. Marriett at Bath, to be left
with you at your former place of residence; you will
be so kind as to give it to him.</P>
<P>IF I wish for a <HI>large</HI> fortune, it is rather for the
sake of my friends than myself: or, to compromise
the matter with those moralists who argue for the
universality of <HI>self-interest,</HI> it is to gratify myself in
the company, and in the gratifications, of my friends.</P>
<P>DR. Ratcliff has sent me a letter, which gives me
much <HI>satisfaction</HI> in respect of my poem; notwith∣standing,
he cannot forbear adding, that he expects
to hear, since my pen has so well adorned the fable,
that my conduct will with equal propriety and ele∣gance
illustrate the moral. However, the simple
approbation of a <HI>sincere</HI> man affects one more than
Pliny's panegyric could do from a more courtly
one.</P>
<P>THERE are several errors of the press, which nei∣ther
sagacity nor vigilance itself, I now see, can pre∣vent,
and which I beg you to correct with your pen
in a copy which I musl get you to present to C—
L—together with the inclosed letter. Please to be
at the expence of having it stitched in purple paper,
and gilt at the edges; and I will re-pay you.</P>

I WAS loitering yesterday in the coffee-room, when
two persons came in, well-dressed, and called for my
poem; read a page or two, and commended the four
lines upon Mr. L—extremely, (“Lov'd by that
Prince, &amp;c”) repeated them forty times, and in the
end got them by heart, mentioned them to a <HI>third</HI>
person, who said he knew of no virtue that the Prince
<HI>was</HI> fired with, and then endeavoured to mimic the
Prince's way of talking; but, says he, <HI>I'll</HI> shew <HI>the
four best lines in the poem,</HI> and then proceeded to “'Twas
Youth's perplexing stage, &amp;c.” which are flat
enough, God knows—but to my first heroes; one of
them reads, “When great Alcides to a grove re∣tir'd.”
<HI>Ay, ay, you know Mr. L—did retire, he was
in the secession; read on; you'll find he mentions Delia
anon. Don't you remember Mr. L—wrote a song upon
Delia? but proceed—you'll find he is going to give a
description of two ladies, of different characters, that were
in love with Mr. L—. One was</HI> (here he named two
names, which I have forgot.) <HI>Upon my word, it is
fine: I believe it is Pote's; but how comes Pope to praise
himself there?</HI> (“Lov'd by that Bard,&amp;c”) <HI>No
doubt, however, it was written by Mr. Pope or Mr.
D—.</HI></P>
<P>MY critics proceeded to the reading of the last
simile <HI>immediately, without</HI> the lines preceding it, and,
agreeing that it was a very good thing, called out
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
for “The Oeconomy of Love.” So you see, “Lau∣dant
<HI>il<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a;</HI> sed <HI>ista</HI> legunt,” is the case. A person
cannot be supposed vain from the approbation of
such critics; or else I Would not have inserted such a

poem takes, and am <HI>afraid</HI> to do so. However, I
find <HI>some do</HI> allow it to be <HI>Mallet's</HI>—I am impatient
till I hear from you: I shall be here till this day fort∣night;

<P>I FIND some difficulty in writing to you on this
melancholy occasion. No one can be more un∣fit
to attempt to lessen your grief than myself, be∣cause
no one has a deeper sense of the <HI>cause</HI> of your
affliction. Though I would by no means be number∣ed
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
by you amongst the common herd of your ac∣quaintance
that tell you they are sorry, yet it were
impertinent in me to mention a mere friend's concern
to a person interested by so many more tender re∣gards.
Besides, I should be glad to alleviate your sor∣row,
and such sort of condolence tends but little to
promote that end. I do not chuse to flatter you;
neither could I, more especially at this time; but
though I could perhaps find enough to say to persons
of less sense than you, I know of nothing but what
your own reason must have suggested. Concern in∣deed
may have suspended the power of that faculty;
and upon that pretence, I have a few things that I
would suggest to you. After all, it is time alone
that <HI>can</HI> and <HI>will</HI> cure <HI>all</HI> afflictions but such as are
the consequence of vice; and yours, I am sure, pro∣ceeds
from a <HI>contrary</HI> principle.</P>
<P>I HEARD accidentally of this sorrowful event, and
accompanied you to London with the utmost concern.
I wished it was in my power to mitigate your griefs
by sharing them, as I have often found it in yours
to augment my pleasures by so doing.</P>
<P>ALL that I can recommend to you is, not to con∣fine
your eye to any single event in life, but to take
in your whole circumstances before you repine.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
<DATE>Leasowes▪ Aug. 1740.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WONDERFUL were the dangers and difficul∣ties
through which I went, the night I left
you at Barels: which I looked upon as ordained by
fate for the temporal punlshment of obstinacy. It
was very kind, and in character, for you to endea∣vour
to deter me from the ways of darkness; but
having a sort of <HI>penchant</HI> for needless difficulties, I
have an undoubted right to indulge myself in them,
so long as I do not insist upon any one's pity. It
is true, these ought not to exceed a certain degree;
they should be <HI>lenia tormenta;</HI> and I must own the
labours I underwent that night did not come with∣in
the bounds which my imagination had prescribed.
I cannot forbear mentioning one imminent danger.
I rode along a considerable piece of water, covered so
close with trees, that it was as probable I might
have pursued the channel, which was dangerous, as
my way out of it. Or, to put my case in a more
poetical light, having by night intruded upon an
amour betwixt a Wood-nymph and a River-god, I
owed my escape to Fortune, who conveyed me from
the vengeance which they might have taken. I put
up finally at a little alehouse about ten o'clock, and
lay all night awake, counting the cords which sup∣ported
me, which I could more safely swear to than
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
to either bed or blanket. For farther particulars,
see my epistle to the Pastor Fido of Lapworth.—Mr.
Graves says, he should be glad to shew you any ci∣vilities
in his power, upon his own acquaintance;
and will serve you as far as his vote goes, upon my
recommendation; but is afraid, without the con∣currence
of some more considerable friends, your
chance will be but small <HI>this</HI> year, &amp;c. If the former
part of this news gives you any pleasure, I assure
you it gives me no less to communicate it; and this
pleasure proceeds from a principle which would in∣duce
me to serve you myself if it should ever be in
my power.—I saw Mr. Lyttelton last week: he is a
candidate for the county of Worcester, together with
Lord Deerhust; I hope Mr. Somervile will do him
the honour to appear as his friend, which he must
at least think second to that of succeeding.</P>
<P>I HEAR you are commenced Chaplain since I saw
you. I wish you joy of it. The Chaplain's title is
infinitely more agreeable than his office; and I hope
the scarf, which is expressive of it, will be no dimi∣nutive
thing, no four-penny-halfpenny piece of rib∣boning;
but that it will

<P>I AM heartily obliged to Mr. Somervile, that he
will make use of any means to <HI>serve</HI> me; more
especially that he will take the trouble of consulting
which may be most effectual to that end; and I de∣sire
you would represent these sentiments to him in
the most expressive manner.</P>
<P>I HAVE, since I arrived here (which was last Satur∣day
night), heard Lowe sing, and seen Cibber act.
The laureat spoke an epilogue, made <HI>upon,</HI> and, I
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
suppose, <HI>by</HI> himself, in which he does not only make
a bare confession, but an <HI>ostentation</HI> of all his follies:
<Q><L>“Of <HI>such</HI> (says he) whoe'er demands a bill of fare</L>
<L>May look into my life—he'll find 'em there;”</L></Q>
or some such lines, I cannot accurately recollect them.
I do not wonder he pleased extremely; but to a
considering man there is something strangely dis∣agreeable,
to hear a scandalous life recommended by
one of his age, and as much satisfaction shewn in the
review of it as if it had been a perfect galaxy of vir∣tues.
An Athenian audience would have shewn their
different sentiments on this occasion. But I am act∣ing
the part of Jeremy Collier, and indeed in some
degree of an hypocrite, for I confess I was highly
pleased with him myself. I have nothing to add,

any thing of Mr. Somervile's. It so fell out, that
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
Mr. Outing delivered to me the verses, and I had
the pleasure of reading them, about a moment before
he gave me your epistle.</P>
<P>THE town expected something of importance, name∣ly,
a motion for a committee of enquiry into late
measures, would be moved for to-day. If any thing
of this nature has been carrying on, I will add an
account of it before I close my letter. In the mean
time it is, I believe, very credible, that Lord Orsord
has a continued influence over the King; and that
the Duke of Argyle is sufficiently disgusted, to have
talked of the resignation of his posts again.</P>
<P>AN odd story enough the following, and I believe
true! Somebody, that had just learnt that H—e W—'s
gentleman's name was Jackson, writes a letter to Mr.
Floyer, Keeper of the Tower, intimating his master's
desire to speak with him. Floyer dresses the next
morning, and waits upon H—e, comes into his
room—“Sir, says H—e, I really dont't know
you—” “Sir, my name is Floyer—” “Ay, by
G—d, that may be; but, by G—d, I don't know
you for all that—” “Sir, says he, I am Keeper of
the Tower—” G—d d—n your blood, says
H—e, produce your warrant; d—n you, produce
your warrant; or, by G—d, I'll kick ye down
stairs—”</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="34"/>
FRIGHTED at these threats, the gentleman re∣tired;
and in his way home had leisure to consider
the joke that was put upon him, and more particu∣larly
turned upon the person to whom he was sent.</P>

<P>“YOUR last letter gave me a good deal of uneasi∣ness
in regard to Mr. Somervile's indisposition.
I hope, if he is better, you will omit no opportunity
of gratifying me with the news of it. I shall be glad
to employ you and Mr. Jago in my little rivulet be∣fore
winter comes, when one must bid adieu to ru∣ral
beauties. Those charming scenes, which the
poets, in order to render them more compleat, have
furnished with ladies, must be stript of all their or∣naments.
Those incomparable nymphs, the Dryads
and the Nereids, which have been my constant com∣panions
this short summer, will vanish to more pleas∣ing
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
climes; and I must be left to seek my assistace
in real beauties instead of imaginary ones. In short,
I am thinking to live part of this winter in Worcester,
or some other town. I was at a concert there, a very
full one, lately. I observed Dr. Mackenzie talking
to Mr. Lyttelton; and I hope, on that account, he
is in his interest: otherwise Mr. Somervile would
do Mr. Lyttelton great service by engaging him.—
Mr. Lyttelton took occasion to mention to me the
obligation he lay under to Mr. Somervile for his let∣ter,
as well as his other designs in his favour—that
he had long received great pleasure from that gentle∣man's
pen, and wished for the honour of his ac∣quaintance.
I told him, I believed the satisfaction
would be mutual, or to that purpose. He added,
that The Chace was an <HI>extremely</HI> beautiful poem, the
best by far ever written on the subject. But now
the fiddles squeaked, the harpsichord jingled, and the
performers began to feel the divine enthusiasm. The
god of music invaded them as he did the Sibyll of
old:

<DATE>Jan. 21, 1741.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOU see I am <HI>extremely expeditious</HI> in answering
your letter; the reason of which is a very pow∣erful
one, namely, the information which I received
tast night, that it would be agreeable to you I should
do so. Please therefore to set aside the sum of
eighteen pence, or thereabouts, for letters which
you will receive whilst I am in London; and, to
make it seem the less profusely squandered, consider
it amongst any other casual expences which you care∣lessly
submit to, merely to gratify your curiosity.</P>
<P>I WENT the other night, with the greatest expecta∣tions,
to see “The Merry Wives of Windsor” per∣formed
at Covent-Garden. It is impossible to express
how much every thing fell below my ideas. But I
have <HI>considered sence;</HI> and I find that my expectations
were really more unjust than their manner of acting.
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
<HI>Persons,</HI> in order to act well, should have something
of the author's fire, as well as a polite education.
And what makes this the clearer to me is, that you
hear ten plays well read by gentlemen in company,
to one that you find well performed upon the stage.—
Nothing can be more ignorant or affected than the
scornful airs which some people give themselves at a
country play; because, forsooth, they have seen plays
in town. The truth is, the chief advantage of plays
in town lies entirely in the scenery. You seldom
observe a set of strollers without one or two actors
who are quite equal to their parts; and I really
know of no good one at either of the two Theatres
Royal, except Cibber who rarely acts, and Mrs.
Clive. I will add one more, in <HI>compliance</HI> with my
<HI>own</HI> taste <HI>merely;</HI> and that is Mr. Neal, a fellow who,
by <HI>playing the fool,</HI> has gained my particular <HI>esteem.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER the play, we had an <HI>entertainment;</HI> falsely
so called! It was that of Orpheus and Eurydice, the
most <HI>un-musical</HI> thing I ever heard, and which lasted,
I believe, three hours, with some intermixtures of
Harlequin; both so dull, and yet heard with pa∣tience,
that I was amazed, astonished, confounded:
but really a <HI>man</HI> of <HI>sense</HI> ought not to be so; because
they were not calculated for <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>I WANT you here extremely: pray come up for a
week. I suppose you will not, so I will not argue
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
superfluously. However, write soon; and believe
that your letters are the most agreeable things in the

<P>AS I have no sort of library in town, I find se∣veral
minutes upon my hands, for which, if
I employ them in scribbling to my friends, they are
but <HI>slenderly obliged</HI> to me. I hope no friend of mine
will ever be induced, by my <HI>example,</HI> to do any thing
but avoid it; I believe no one breathing can say with
more truth, “Video meliora, &amp;c.” It is not from a
spirit of jealousy that I would advise my acquaintance
to seek happiness in the regular path of a fixed life.
But, though I very highly approve it, and envy it,
my particular turn of mind would be as little satisfied
with it as it is like to be in a <HI>different</HI> one. Yet,
however I <HI>complain,</HI> I must own I have a good deal
reconciled myself to this mixture of gratification and
disappointment, which must be my lot till the last
totally prevails.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="39"/>
YET, after all, to tell you the truth, I am not pleased
with being advised to retire. I was saying the other
day to Mr. Outing, that I <HI>had</HI> been ambitious more
than I was at present, and that I grew less so every
day. Upon this he chimed in with me, and approved
my despondency; saying, “that <HI>he</HI> also had been am∣bitious,
but found it would not do.” Do you
think I liked him much for this?—no—I wheeled
about, and said, “I did not think with him; for I
should always find myself whetted by disappoint∣ments,
and more violent in proportion to the intri∣cacy
of the game.” I spent a night with him and
Mr. Meredith, and with him and Mr. Dean: in the
latter party he had laid his hand upon his sword six
times, and <HI>threatened to put a dozen men to death,</HI> one of
which was Broughton the prize-fighter.—Mr. Whist∣ler's
company seldom <HI>relieves</HI> me on an evening; and
I go to plays but <HI>seldom,</HI> because I intend no more to
<HI>give countenance</HI> to the <HI>pit.</HI>—I have got a belt!!!
which distinguishes me as much as a <HI>garter</HI>—it capti∣vates
the eyes of all beholders, and binds their under∣standings
in golden bandage.—I heard a pedant pun∣ning
upon the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and a wag whispering
that I was related to <HI>Beltishazzar.</HI> In short I may say,
from the Dragon of Wantley,
<Q><L>“No girdle, nor belt, e'er excell'd it;</L>
<L>It frightens the men in a minute:</L>
<L>No maiden yet ever beheld it,</L>
<L>But wish'd herself tied to me in it.”</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="40"/>
THE Dunciad is, doubtless, Mr. Pope's dotage,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; flat in the whole, and including,
with several tolerable lines, a <HI>number</HI> of weak, ob∣scure,
and even punning ones. What is now read
by the <HI>whole world,</HI> and the <HI>whole world's wife,</HI> is,
Mr. Hervey's Letter to Sir T. Hanmer. I own my
<HI>taste</HI> is gratified in it, as well as that <HI>unluckiness</HI> na∣tural

gave me a direction, you might possibly expect to
receive a previous letter from me. I want to be in∣formed
of the impressions you receive from your <HI>new</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
circumstances. The chief aversion which some peo∣ple
have to orders is, what I fancy you will remove
in such as you converse with. I take it to be owing
partly to dress, and partly to the <HI>avowed profession</HI> of
religion. A young clergyman, that has distinguished
his genius by a composition or two of a polite nature,
and is capable of dressing <HI>himself,</HI> and his <HI>religion,</HI> in
a different manner from the generality of his profes∣sion,
that is, without formality, is certainly a genteel
character. I speak this not with any sly design to ad∣vise,
but to intimate that I think you very capable of
<HI>shining</HI> in a dark-coloured coat.—You must consider
me yet as a man of the world, and endeavouring to
elicit that pleasure from gaiety which my reason tells
me I shall never find.—It is impossible to express
how stupid I have been ever since I came home, inso∣much
that I cannot write a common letter without
six repetitions. This is the third time I have begun
yours, and you see what stuff it is made up of. I
must e'en hasten to matter of fact, which is the com∣fortable
resource of dull people, though, even as to that,
I have nothing to <HI>communicate.</HI> But I would be glad to
know, whether you are under a necessity of residing
on week-days; and, if not, why I may not expect you
a day or two at The Leasowes very soon.—Did you
make any enquiry concerning the number of my
poems sold at Oxford? or did you hear any thing
concerning it that concerns me to hear?—Will S—
(for that is his true name) is the excess of simplicity
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
and good-nature. He seems to have all the industry
imaginable to divert and amuse people, without any
ambitious ends to serve, or almost any concern whe∣ther
he has so much as a laugh allowed to his sto∣ries,
any farther than as a laugh is an indication
that people are delighted. This, joined with his
turn of thought, renders him quite agreeable. I wish
it were in my power to conciliate acquaintance with
half his ease.—Pray do not delay writing to me.

<HEAD>XV. To Mr. GRAVES, on similar Taste and Manners.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
The Leasowes, <DATE>Sept. 23, 1741.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS very agreeably entertained by your last let∣ter,
as indeed I am by every one of yours. It
were affectation to except a paragraph or two on ac∣count
of partiality, where, to say the truth, the par∣tiality
itself pleases one. This I am very positive
of, that to have a friend of your temper and taste
will always give me pleasure, whether I please the
world or no; but to please ever so much, without
some such friendship, would in all probability sig∣nify
but little. I shall, therefore, value any means
that tend to confirm my opinion of your esteem for
me, preferably to any that shew me I am merely de∣serving
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
of it. After all, though a very limited num∣ber
of <HI>friends</HI> may be sufficient, an idle person should
have a large <HI>acquaintance;</HI> and I believe I have the
least of any one that ever rambled about so much as
I have done. I do not know how it is, but I abso∣lutely
despair of ever being introduced into the
world. It may be objected by some (but you will
not object it), that I may be acquainted with a suf∣ficient
number of people that are my <HI>equals,</HI> if I <HI>will</HI>
They may be my <HI>equals</HI> and <HI>superiors</HI> whom they
mean, sor aught I care; but their conversation gives
me no more pleasure than the <HI>canking</HI> of a goose, or
the quacking of a duck, in affluent circumstances:
rather <HI>less</HI> indeed of the two, because the idea of the
fat goose flatters one's appetite; but the <HI>human goose</HI>
is neither fit to be heard nor eaten. I wish indeed
to be <HI>shewn into</HI> good company; but, if I can at all
distinguish the nature of my inclinations, it is more
in hopes of meeting with a refined conversation, than
any thing else. I do not at all insist that my genius
is <HI>better</HI> than that of my vociferous neighbours; if
it is <HI>different,</HI> it is a sufficient reason why I should
seek such companions as suit it; and whether they
are found in high or low life, is little to the pur∣pose.
But you will perhaps discern the operations
of <HI>vanity</HI> in all my endeavours; I will not disagree
with you, provided you will allow <HI>amusement</HI> an equal
share in them. It is the vanity to be intimate with
men of distinguished sense, not of distinguished for∣tune.
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
And this is a vanity which you should not
disapprove, because it will bind me a lasting friend to
you and your family.</P>
<P>I HAVE been over at Shis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall, and, in order to
make myself agreeable, rode a-hunting with Mr. Pitt.
I confess I was somewhat diverted; and my horse
was so much an enthusiast, as to be very near run∣ning
headlong into a deep water. I believe, if I were
to turn sportsman, I should soon break my neck for
sear the huntsman sould despise me.</P>
<P>I WILL certainly endeavour to see you at Birming∣ham;
but beg you would write me a long letter in
the mean time: and contrive, if you can, to make it
look like a packet as your last did, for the sight
thereof is exceedingly comfortable.</P>
<P>THOUGH my wishes will not suffer me to believe
that your eyes are in the danger you represent; yet,
supposing them to be only very weak, I would re∣commend
some musical instrument that is most a∣greeable
to you. I have often looked upon music as
my dernier refort, if I should ever discard the world,
and turn eremite entirely. Consider what other
amusement can make an equal impression in old age.</P>
<P>I HAVE filled my paper, not without difficulty,

<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
I foresee I shall lead. I am angry, and envious, and
dejected, and frantic, and disregard all present things,
just as becomes a madman to do. I am infinitely
pleased (though it is a gloomy joy) with the applica∣tion
of Dr. Swift's complaint, “that he is forced to
die in a rage, like a poisoned rat in a hole” My
soul is no more suited to the figure I make, than a
cable rope to a cambric needle:—I cannot bear to see
the advantages alienated, which I think I could deserve
and relish so much more than those that have them.—
Nothing can give me patience but the soothing sympa∣thy

nobody. I <HI>do</HI> hate all hereabouts already, except one

to me (and, I think, you too, both unjustly),
“I am no character.”—I have in my temper some
rakishness, but it is checked by want of spirits; some
solidity, but it is softened by vanity; some esteem of
learning, but it is broke in upon by laziness, imagina∣tion,
and want of memory, &amp;c.—I could reckon up
twenty things throughout my whole circumstances

<P>YOU must give me leave to complain of your last
letter, three parts of which is filled with mere
apology: I thought we had some time agreed, for our
mutual emolument, to lay aside ceremonies of this
species, till I was made Poet-laureat, and you Bishop
of Winchester.—Why Bishop of Winchesster, for God's
sake? Why—becaus;e—he is Prelate of the Garter—
an order, in all kinds of ceremony so greatly abound∣ing.—
Here am I still, trifling away my time, my mo∣ney,
and, I think, my health, which I fancy greatly
inferior to what it would be in the country. Truth
is, I do make shift to vary my days a little here; and,
calling to mind the many irksome hours, the stupid
identity, of which I have been so often sick in the
country, I conclude that I am less <HI>unhappy</HI> than I shall
find myselt a: home.—However, next month I hope
to see The Leasowes with an appetite.—Walks in the
Park are now delightfully pleasant: the company stays
in the Mall till ten every night.—Mrs. Clive, Mrs.
Woffington, Barbarini, and Mr. Garrick (happy man!)
are gone over to Ireland, to act there for two months.
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
—Mr. Outing, the last time I saw him, told me how
Dr. Mackenzie cured him of ever fighting with scrubs,
&amp;c. “I was just going, says he, to kick a fellow
down stairs, when the Doctor cries out, “Mr. Out∣ing! hear our Scotch proverb before you proceed
any farther;—He that wrestles with a t—d, whether
he get or lose the victory, is sure to be b—s—t.” I
had great difficulty (continued he) to contain myself
till he had finished his story, but I found it so pat
that it saved the fellow's neck.” I wish <HI>I</HI> could
<HI>cure</HI> him as easily of these Quixotical narrations.—I
know no soul in town that <HI>has</HI> any taste, which oc∣casions
me the spleen frequently. I remember W—
and I were observing, that no creatures, though ever
so loathsome (as toads, serpents, adders, &amp;c), would
be half so hated as ourselves, if we were to give vent
to our spleen, and censure affections so bluntly as
some people do. I would not venture this hint, if
I did not believe you experience the same. For my
part, people contradict me in things I have <HI>studied,</HI>
and am <HI>certain</HI> of; and I keep silence even from <HI>good
words (bons mots),</HI> though it is pain and grief to me.
I must give up my <HI>knowledge</HI> to <HI>pretence,</HI> or vent it
with <HI>diffidence</HI> to fools; or there is no peace. <HI>These,
these</HI> are <HI>justifiable</HI> motives to wish for some degree of
fame; that blind people may not bully a man that
has his eyesight into their opinion that green is red,

that I have no more <HI>haughty</HI> one.—This sub∣ject

<P>IF a friend of yours who lived in the farthest part
of China were to send you a pinch of snuff wrapt
up in a sheet of writing-paper, I conceive the snuff
would improve in value as it traveled, and gratify
your curiosity extremely by the time it reached your
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingers ends.—Very true—you will say:—why then,
<HI>that very consideration</HI> was my inducement to write
to you at this time; and that sort of progressional
value is what you are to place upon ray letter. For,
be assured, I am not ignorant how much this my let∣ter
doth resemble a pinch of snuff in point of signi∣ficancy,
and that both the one and the other are what
you may as well do without.—My letter is as fol∣lows.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="50"/>
You must know, in rainy weather, I always soothe
my melancholy with the remembrance of <HI>distant</HI> friends
only: you cannot easily conceive the high value I
place upon their good qualities at such a time; so
that at this very instant I am <HI>impatient</HI> to see you.
To-morrow, if the sun shines bright, I shall only
<HI>wish</HI> for your company as for a <HI>very great good.</HI> If
you are unemployed when you leave Bath, I should
think, you might stay some time with me this sum∣mer.
Refined sense is what one is apt to value one's
self upon; but really, unless one has a refined soul
or two to converse with, it is an inconvenience. I
have ruined my happiness by conversing with you
and a few more friends: as Falstaff says to Hal,
“Company, <HI>witty</HI> company, has been the ruin of
me!” Before I knew that pleasure, I was as con∣tented
as could be in my solitude; and <HI>now,</HI> the <HI>ab∣sence</HI>
of <HI>entertainment</HI> is a <HI>positive</HI> pain to me. Lon∣don
has amused me a while with diversions; but
now they are past, and I have neither any one about
me that <HI>has</HI> the least <HI>delicatesse,</HI> or that I can inspire
with the <HI>ambition of having any.</HI>—W—W—comes
in a dirty <HI>shirt,</HI> and an old coat, without a stock, to
pay me a visit. He pulled out a pair of scissars, and,
giving them an intricate turn over his two thumbs,
said, that <HI>he</HI> could do that, and I could make a poem;
some for <HI>one</HI> thing, some for another:
<Q><L>“Hic nigri succus loliginis, haec est</L>
<L>Aerugo mera.”</L></Q>
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
It was <HI>splenetic</HI> weather <HI>too.</HI>—The man is curst who
writes verses, and lives in the country.—If his <HI>celestial</HI>
part inspires him to converse with Juno, his <HI>terrcstrial</HI>
one necessitates him to stoop to his landlady; so that
he is in as disagreeable a fituation, as if one person
were to pull him upwards by the <HI>head,</HI> and another
downwards by the <HI>tail.</HI>—Do you never find any thing
of this?—I mean, that your <HI>pride</HI> and your <HI>social</HI> qua∣lities
torture you with their <HI>different</HI> attractions? In∣deed
one would always give way to the last, but that
few are familiarity-proof, few but whom it teaches to
despise one. Albeit I am conscious of the bad in∣fluence
of freedom myself; yet, whilst it tends to dis∣cover
wit, humour, and sense, it only renders me more

Do not let your supercilious friends come in upon
you with their prudential maxims. Consider, you
are now of the proper age for pleasure, and have not

not struck one bold stroke yet, that I know of. Sad∣dle
your mule, and let us be jogging to the great

me have the pleasure of seeing you in the pit, in a
laughter as cordial and singular as your friendship.
Come—let us go forth into the opera-house; let us
hear how the eunuch-folk sing. Turn your eye upon
the lilies and roses, diamonds and rubies; the Be∣lindas
and the Sylvias of gay life! Think upon Mrs.

Hippesley's joke-abounding physiognomy! Think, I

“I have no pleasure in them.”</P>
<P>I AM conscious of much merit in bringing about

<P>OUR old friend Somervile is dead! I did not
imagine I could have been so sorry as I find my∣self
on this occasion—“Sublatum quaerimus.” I can
now excuse all his foibles; impute them to age, and
to distress of circumstances: the last of these consi∣derations
wrings my very soul to think on. For a
man of high spirit, conscious of having (at least in one
production) generally pleased the world, to be plagued
and threatened by wretches that are low in every
sense; to be forced to drink himself into pains of the
body in order to get rid of the pains of the mind; is a
misery which I can well conceive, because I may,
Without vanity, esteem myself his equal in point of oe∣conomy,
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
and consequently <HI>ought</HI> to have an eye on his
misfortunes: (As you kindly hinted to me about twelve
o'clock at the Feathers) I should retrench;—I will;
but you shall not see me:—I will not let you know
that I took your hint in good part. I will do it at
solitary times, as I may: and yet there will be some
difficulty in it; for whatever the <HI>world</HI> might esteem
in poor Somervile, I really find, upon critical enquiry,
that <HI>I</HI> loved him for nothing so much as his flocci∣nauci-nihili-pili-fication
of money.</P>
<P>MR. A—was honourably acquitted: Lord A—,
who was present, and behaved very insolently they
say, was hissed out of court. They proved his ap∣plication
to the carpenter's son, to get him to swear
against Mr. A—, though the boy was proved to have
said in several companies (<HI>before</HI> he had been kept at
Lord A—'s house) that he was sure the thing was ac∣cidental.
Finally, it is believed he will recover the
title of A—ea.</P>
<P>THE apprehension of the whores, and the suffoca∣tion
of four in the round-house by the <HI>stupidity</HI> of the
keeper, engrosses the talk of the town. The said
house is re-building every day (for the mob on Sunday
night demolished it), and re-demolished every night.
The Duke of M—gh, J—S—his brother, Lord
C—G—, were taken into the round-house, and con∣fined
from eleven at night till eleven next day: I am
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
not positive of the Duke of M—gh; the others are
certain: and that a large number of people of the first
fashion went from the round-house to De Veil's, to
give in informations of their usage. The justice him∣self
seems greatly scared; the prosecution will be car∣ried
on with violence, so as probably to hang the
keeper, and there is an end.</P>
<P>LORD Bath's coachman got drunk and tumbled
from his box, and he was forced to borrow Lord Or∣ford's.
Wits say, that it was but gratitude for my

I can easily conceive that, upon some extra∣ordinary

dependent on the mind, I know from this, that I
have enjoyed happier scenes in the company of some
friends than I can possibly at present;—but alas!
all the time you and I shall enjoy together, abstract∣ed
from the rest of our lives, and lumped, will not
perhaps amount to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olid year and a half. How
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall a proportion!</P>
<P>PEOPLS will say to one that talks thus, “Would
you die?” To set the case upon a right footing,
they must take away the hopes of greater happiness
in <HI>this</HI> life, the fears of greater misery hereafter,
together with the bodily <HI>pain</HI> of dying, and address
me in a disposition betwixt mirth and melancholy;
and I could easily resolve them.</P>
<P>I DO not know how I am launched out so far into
this complaint: it is, perhaps, a strain of constitu∣tional
whining; the effect of the wind—did it come
from the winds? to the winds will I deliver it:
<Q><L>“Tradam protervis in mare Creticum,</L>
<L>Portare ventis—”</L></Q></P>
<P>I WILL be as happy as my fortune will permit,

I WILL be so.—The joke is, that the description
which you gave of that country was, that you had
few trees about you; so that I should <HI>trick</HI> Fortune
if she should grant my petition implicitly. But, in
earnest, I intend to come and stay a day or two with
you next summer.</P>
<P>MR. Whistler is at Mr. Gosling's, bookseller, at
the Mitre and Crown, in Fleet-street, and enquired
much after you in his last letter to me. He writes
to me; but I believe his affection for one weighs
less with him while the town is in the other scale;
though he is very obliging. I do not know whe∣ther
I do right, when I say I believe we three, that
is, in solitary circumstances, have an equal idea of,
and affection for, each other. I say, supposing each
to be alone, or in the country, which is nearly the
same; for scenes alter minds -as much as the air in∣fluences
bodies. For instance, when Mr. Whistler
is in town, I suppose we love him better than he
does us; and when we are in town, I suppose the
same may be said in regard to him.</P>
<P>THE true burlesque of Spenser (whose characteristic
is simplicity) seems to consist in a <HI>simple</HI> representa∣tion
of such things as one laughs to <HI>see</HI> or to <HI>observe</HI>
one's self, rather than in any <HI>monstrous</HI> contrast be∣twixt
the thoughts and words. I cannot help think∣ing

SPENSER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
The Leasowes, 1742,
the Day before Christmas.</OPENER>
<P>THOUGH your last letter seemed to put my
correspondence upon an ostentatious footing,
namely, an inclination to be witty, yet I assure you
it was not any punctilious consideration of that kind
that has kept me so long silent. Indeed with some
people one would stand upon the nicest punctilios;
for though ceremony be altogether lighter than vanity
itself, yet it surely weighs as much as the acquain∣tance
of the undeserving. But this is trifling, be∣cause
it can have no reference to a person for whom
I have the greatest affection.</P>
<P>IN regard to my Oxford affairs, you did all I could
expect. I have wrote since to Mr. M—, who, ei∣ther
for your sake or mine, will, I dare say, settle
them to my satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="62"/>
I WISH your journey and head-ach would have
permitted you to have been a little more particular
concerning the seat of the Muses; but I suppose no∣thing
material distinguished your fortnight.</P>
<P>MR. Whistler has relapsed at Whitchurch; but
purposed, when I last heard from him, to go to
London before this time. I do not entirely under∣stand
his schemes, but should have been sincerely
glad of his company with me this winter; and, he
says, he is not fond of London.—For my part, I
designed to go thither the next month, but the fever
(which is chiefly violent in towns) discourages me.</P>
<P>SOME time ago, I read Spenser's Fairy Queen;
and, when I had finished, thought it a proper time
to make some additions and corrections in my trifling
imitation of him, The School-mistress.—His subject
is certainly bad, and his action inexpressibly con∣fused;
but there are some particulars in him that
charm one. Those which afford the greatest scope
for a ludicrous imitation are, his simplicity and ob∣solete
phrase; and yet these are what give one a very
singular pleasure in the perusal. The burlesque
which they occasion is of quite a different kind to
that of Philips's Shilling, Cotton's Travestie, Hudi∣bras,
or Swift's works; but I need not tell <HI>you</HI> this.
I inclose a copy, for your amusement and opinion;
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
which, if franks are plentiful, you may return, and
save me the <HI>tedious</HI> trouble of writing it over again.
The other paper was, <HI>bona fide,</HI> written to divert my
thoughts from pain, for the same reason that I smoak∣ed;
actions equally reputable.</P>
<P>MR. Somervile's poem, upon hawking, called,
“Field Sports,” I suppose, is out by this time. It
was sent to Mr. Lyttelton, to be read to the Prince, to
whom it was inscribed. It seems, he is fond of hawk∣ing.</P>
<P>I HAVE often thought those to be the most envia∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le
people whom one least envies1|M I believe, mar∣ried
men are the happiest that are; but I cannot
say I envy them, because they lose all their merit in
the eyes of other ladies.</P>
<P>I BEG sincerely that you would write in a week's
time at furthest, that I may receive your letter <HI>here</HI>
if I should go from home this winter. I will never
use any thing by way of conclusion, but your old

<HEAD>XXIV. To the same, with a Continuation of the
same Subject.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves!
<DATE>June, 1742.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad the stay you make in Herefordshire
amuses you, even though it puts you upon pre∣ferring
the place you reside at to my own place of
residence. I do not know whether it be from the
prejudice of being born at The Leasowes, or from
any real beauty in the situation; but I would wish
no other, would some one, by an addition of two
hundred pounds a year, put it in my power to ex∣hibit
my own designs. It is what I can now do in
no other method than on paper. I live in such an
un-oeconomical manner, that I must not indulge my∣self
in the plantation of a tree for the future. I
have glutted myself with the extremity of solitude,
and must adapt my expences more to sociable life.
It is on this account that it seems more prudent for
me to buy a chair while I am in town, than to carry
down twelve guineas for the model of the tomb of
Virgil, an urn, and a scheme or two more of like
nature.—I long to have my picture, <HI>distantly</HI> approach∣ing
to a profile (the best manner I can think of to
express myself), drawn by Davison. I have seen
your sister's, and think the <HI>face</HI> well done in every
respect; but am greatly indignant with other things
of a less fixed nature. The cap, though a good cap
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
enough, has a vile effect; the formality of stays, &amp;c.
not agreeable.—I do not know if you saw the picture
of a Scotch girl there at full length? Miss Graves
has the advantage of her's, or any picture there,
in her person; but certainly this girl's hair is in∣expressibly
charming! there is the genteelest neg∣ligence
in it I ever saw in any picture:—what fol∣lows,
but that I wish your sister would give orders
to pull off her cap, and have hair after the manner
of this picture?—To speak abruptly; as it <HI>is,</HI> I dis∣approve
it: were it altered, I should like it beyond
any I ever saw.—I am glad you are reading Spen∣ser:
though his plan is detestable, and his <HI>invention</HI>
less wonderful than most people imagine, who do not
much consider the obviousness of allegory; yet, I
think, a person of your disposition must take great
delight in his <HI>simplicity,</HI> his good-nature, &amp;c. Did
you observe a stanza that begins a canto somewhere,</P>
<P>“Nought is there under heav'n's wide hollowness
That breeds,”&amp;c.?</P>
<P>WHEN I bought him first, I read a page or two
of the Fairy Queen, and cared not to proceed. Af∣ter
that, Pope's Alley made me consider him lu∣dicrously;
and in that light, I think, one may read
him with pleasure. I am now (as Ch—mley with—),
from trifling and laughing at him, really in love
with him. I think even the metre pretty (though
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
I shall never use it in earnest); and that the last Alex∣andrine
has an extreme majesty.—Does not this line
strike you? (I do not justly remember what canto it is
in)
<Q>“Brave thoughts and noble deeds did <HI>evermore</HI> in∣spire.”</Q>
Perhaps it is my fancy only that is enchanted with
the running of it. Adieu!</P>

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves!</OPENER>
<P>I DEPENDED a good deal on an immediate an∣swer
from you, and am greatly fearful you never
received a packet of little things which I sent you
to Oxford, inclosed in a frank; though, if it arrived
at all, it must have arrived several days before you
left it. I beseech you to send me a line upon the
receipt of these, which will free me from much per∣plexity;
though it is doubtful whether I can defer
my schemes so as to make your criticisms of service.
I would have you send them not withstanding.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="67"/>
I CANNOT help considering myself as a sportsman
(though God knows how poor a one in every sense!)
and the company as my game. They <HI>fly up</HI> for a
little time; and then <HI>settle</HI> again. My cue is, to dis∣charge
my <HI>piece</HI> when I observe a number together.
This week, they are straggling round about their
pasture, the town: the next, they will flock into it
with violent appetites; and then I discharge my
little piece amongst them.—I assure you, I shall be
very easy about the acquisition of any fame by this
thing; all I much wish is, to lose none: and in∣deed
I have so little to lose, that this consideration
scarcely affects me.</P>
<P>I DARE say it must be very incorrect; for I have
added eight or ten stanzas within this fortnight.
But inaccuracy is more excusable in ludicrous poetry
than in any other. If it strikes <HI>any,</HI> it must be merely
people of <HI>taste;</HI> for people of <HI>wit</HI> without taste (which
comprehends the larger part of the critical tribe) will
unavoidably despise it. I have been at some pains
to secure myself from A. Philips's misfortune, of
mere <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ildishness,</HI> “Little charm of placid mien, &amp;c.”
I have added a ludicrous index, purely to shew (fools)
that I am in jest:—and my motto, “O quà sol ha∣bitabiles
illustrat oras, maxime principum,” is cal∣culated
for the same purpose. You cannot conceive
how large the number is of those that mistake bur∣lesque
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
for the very foolishness it exposes (which ob∣servation
I made once at The Rehearsal, at Tom
Thumb, at Chrononhotonthologos; all which are
pieces of elegant humour). I have some mind to
pursue this caution further; and advertise it, “The
School-mistress, &amp;c.” A very <HI>childish</HI> performance
every body knows (<HI>novorum more</HI>). But if a person
seriously calls this, or rather burlesque, a childish
or low species of poetry, he says wrong; for the
most regular and formal poetry may be called trifling,
folly, and weakness, in comparison of what is writ∣ten
with a more <HI>manly</HI> spirit in ridicule of it.—I
have been plagued to death about the ill execution
of my designs.—Nothing is certain in London but
expence, which I can ill bear. Believe me, <HI>till

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
The Leasowes, <DATE>Nov. 1742.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>PRESUMING you may be at Tissington by this
time, I write to solicit a description of the several
adventures, accidents, and phaenomena, that have a∣mused
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
you in your travels; and will <HI>equally</HI> affect
me as they relate to you. Above all things, be par∣ticular
in regard to your calculations respecting Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣kleton.
I would have certainly met you there, as
you desired me: there is no company I am fonder
of than yours and your sister's; and no place at
which I have spent more agreeable hours than Mic∣kleton.
But your brother has lost one of his recom∣mendations
in my eye; that is, his <HI>irregularity</HI> of
house-keeping. He has several left which are suf∣ficient
to preserve my utmost esteem; but that was
a jewel indeed! I love to go where there is nothing
much more in form than myself. I have no' ob∣jection
to visit <HI>young, unsettled people,</HI> with a mounte∣bank's
inconsistency in my equipage. But where a
considerable family keeps up its forms (as marriage
requires), I should not care to appear with an hired
horse, and a <HI>Sancho</HI> for my valet. The case is, I
<HI>could</HI> live in a way genteel enough, and uniformly
so; but then I must forego megrims, whims, toys,
and so forth. Now, though it gives me pain, <HI>some∣times,</HI>
not to appear of a piece; yet that <HI>infrequent</HI>
pain is not a balance for the substantial happiness
which I find in an urn, a seal, a snuff-box, an engrav∣ing,
or a bust. Ambition, too, as it puts me upon
wishing to make a figure, makes me very indifferent
as to making a common every-day-gentlemanly
figure; and saves me from appearing solicitous a∣bout
the “<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es <HI>mediocriter</HI> splendidae,” by raising my
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
imagination <HI>higher.</HI> I pour out my vanity to you
in cataracts; but I hope you will rather consider
it as a mark of my <HI>confidence,</HI> and, consequently, my
sincere esteem and affection: for, I take it, the for∣mer
seldom subsists without the latter. And as to
what I said about my love of flattery, I hope, you
will not construe it as. any <HI>hint;</HI> neither, if I am
right, would you be so ungenerous as to comply
with me. I sincerely think that flattery amongst
foes is absolutely desirable; amongst one's <HI>common
acquaintance,</HI> a behaviour <HI>rather inclining</HI> to it: but
amongst <HI>friends,</HI> its consequences are of too dangerous
a nature.</P>
<P>I AM so unhappy in my wintery, unvisited state,
that I can almost say with Dido, “teadet coeli con-vexa
tueri.” I am miserable, to think that I have
not thought enough to amuse me. I walk a day
together, and have no idea but what comes in at
my eyes. I long for some subject about the size
of Philips's Cyder, to settle heartily about; some∣thing
that I could enrich by episodes drawn from
the English history: <HI>Stonehenge</HI> has some of the ad∣vantages
I like; but seems a dead, lifeless title. If
you chance to think of a subject which you do not
chuse to <HI>adorn</HI> yourself, send it me to <HI>write upon.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL be vastly desirous to see you here in
spring; and am in hopes Whistler will stay a month
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
with me. I have sent an imperious letter about
his dilatory correspondence.—He mentioned you in
his last letter; was going to Oxford; thence to
London: where, if he stays till February, I may see

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
From Mr. Shuckburgh's,

<P>I HAVE just been spending my evening at a cof∣fee-house;
and, notwithstanding the confused ef∣fect
of liquor, am sitting down to write to a person
of the clearest head I know. The <HI>truth</HI> is, I write
to please <HI>myself,</HI> which I can do no other way so
ef∣factually▪
upon which account, you are not obliged
to me for the <HI>advances</HI> I make in correspondence.
Extraordinary things will be expected from my <HI>situa∣tion;</HI>
but extraordinary things ought never to be ex∣pected
from <HI>me.</HI> I keep no political company, nor
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
<HI>desire</HI> any, as, I believe, you know. If you enquire
after the stage,—I have not seen Garrick; but, more
fortunately for <HI>you,</HI> your brother <HI>has.</HI> Me nothing
has so much transported as young Cibber's <HI>exhibition</HI>
of Parolles, in Shakespear's “<HI>All's well that ends
well.”</HI> The character is admirably written by the
author; and, I fancy, I can discover a great num∣ber
of hints which it has afforded to Congreve
in his Bluff. I am apt to think a person, after he
is twelve years old, laughs annually less and less:
less heartily, however; which is much the same.
I think Cibber elicited from me as sincere a laugh
as I can ever recollect. Nothing, sure, can be com∣parable
to his representation of Parolles in his bully-character;
except the figure he makes as a shabby
gentleman. In his first dress he is tawdry, as you
may imagine: in the last, he wears a rusty black
coat, a black stock, a black wig with a Ramillie, a
pair of black gloves; and a face!—which causes five
minutes laughter.—Instead of politics, I have
transcribed these epigrams from the Evening Post—
though I hate transcribing:</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“The CHOICE, to Sir ROBERT—</HEAD>
<L>“When opposition against power prevail'd;</L>
<L>When artful eloquence and bribery fail'd;</L>
<L>Timely you quit the ship you could not steer,</L>

Conscious that you deserve to <HI>bleed</HI> or <HI>swing,</HI></L>

<L>With huge Antaeus as Alcides strove,</L>

<P>YOU say it is no way unpleasing to you to re∣ceive
my letters; if you say the thing that is
not, the fault, like others, produces its own punish∣ment.—
You are now my only correspondent. I do
not know what reason Whistler has for not caring
to write, unless he thinks that we ought not to
trouble ourselves about one another, but bend our
whole endeavours to mend our fortunes; though
I do not <HI>know</HI> his imaginations. I was afraid, after
what I had said concerning <HI>sameness</HI> in my last, that
you would interpret it to your own disadvantage;
but was too lazy to write my letter again, trusting
that I could deny the extent of my complaint to any
one besides myself in some future letter. There is
as much variety in your genius, as fortune can intro∣duce
into your circumstances.</P>
<P>SOME time next week, do I purpose to set out for
London. The reasons for my going at all do <HI>barely</HI>
preponderate. I cannot, <HI>conscientiously,</HI> print any
thing. I have two or three little matters in hand:
none that I am greatly fond of, much less that are
at all mature. One is, what you have seen, though
in its mortal state, “Flattery, or the fatal Exotic;”
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
so very quotidian and copious a subject, that I dis∣like
it entirely. Another, “Elegies in Hammond's
Metre,” but upon <HI>real</HI> and natural subjects: this
I have objections to. A third, “An Essay on Re∣serve;”
the subject genteel, I think, but scarce
ten lines finished. A fourth, “An Essay, in blank
Verse, on Oeconomy, with Advice to Poets on
that Head, concluding with a ludicrous Descrip∣tion
of a Poet's Apartment.” I think it were
better to <HI>annex</HI> that poem thus, to prevent its clash∣ing,
like an earthen pot, against Philips's silver vase,
though his humour lies chiefly in the language. My
favourite scheme is a poem, in blank verse, upon
Rural <HI>Elegance,</HI> including cascades, temples, grottos,
hermitages, green-houses, which introduces my fa∣vorite
episode of the Spanish lady (you will won∣der
<HI>how,</HI> but I think <HI>well</HI>) to close the first book.
The next, running upon planting, &amp;c. will end
with a vista terminated by an old abbey, which in∣troduces
an episode concerning the effects of Romish
power, interdicts, &amp;c. in imitation of Lucretius's
“Plague of Athens,” taken from Thucydides, Vir∣gil's
Murrain, and Ovid's Pestilence, &amp;c. The two
episodes in great forwardness;—but, alas! I do not
like formal didactic poetry, and shall never be able
to finish aught <HI>but</HI> the episodes, I doubt: unless I
allow myself to treat the rest in <HI>my own</HI> manner,
transiently—as Camilla skimmed over the wheat∣stubble.</P>

I HAVE altered this ballad, you see; I doubt, not
to your mind: but send your criticisms, and I will
be all obedience. From London I will send you
mine on your more important poem: your critique
will be important upon my silly affair; mine silly,
I am afraid, upon your momentous one—but you

your reputation with men of sense as much as (great∣ly
more than) the whole tedious character of Parson
Adams. I read it half a year ago; the week after
I came to town: but made Mr. Shuckburgh take it
again, imagining it altogether a very mean per∣formance.—

I liked a tenth part pretty well; but,
as Dryden says of Horace (unjustly), he, shews his
teeth without laughing: the greater part is <HI>unnatural</HI>
and <HI>unhumorous.</HI> It has some advocates; but, I ob∣serve,
those not such as I ever esteemed tasters.
Finally, what makes <HI>you endeavour</HI> to like it?</P>
<P>MY printer was preparing his bill for The School∣mistress,
when I stopped him short, with a hint to
go to Dodsley, who has not yet reckoned with me
for Hercules. Let <HI>the dead</HI> bury their <HI>dead.</HI> Dr.
Young's Complaint is the best thing that has come
out this season (these <HI>twenty years,</HI> Pope says) ex∣cept
mine, for so <HI>thinks</HI> every author, who does not
think proper to say so: poor Pope's history in Cib∣ber's
Letter, and the print of him upon the Mount
of Love (the <HI>coarsest</HI> is most <HI>humorous</HI>), must surely
mortify him. Your sister does me great honour to
think my hint any thing; but I am quite zealous
in my approbation of that Scotch lady's hair. I
will <HI>ever</HI> aim at <HI>oddness</HI> for the future; it is cheaper
to follow taste than fashion, and whoever he be that
devotes himself to <HI>taste</HI> will be <HI>odd</HI> of course.—You
send me the verses on Lord Ilay: they were hacked
about town three months ago, and I saw them.
The town is certainly the scene for a man of curiosi∣ty.—
I do not purpose to be long away; but I must
think of retrenching.—I have ten thousand things
to tell you, but I have not room. Such people as
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
<HI>we</HI> should meet as regularly to compare notes as
tradesmen do to settle accounts, but oftener; there
is no good comes of long reckonings;—I shall for∣get
half—I think it should be four days in a fort∣night—
it would not do;—it would make one <HI>mindful</HI>
of, and consequently more uneasy on account of,
absence. Every one gets posts, preferments, but my∣self.—
Nothing but my ambition can set me on a
footing with them, and make me easy. Come then,
lordly pride; &amp;c. The devil thought with me in
Milton,
<Q><L><HI>“All</HI> is not lost, th' unconquerable will,</L>
<L>And study never to submit or yield.”</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>XXX. To Mr. JAGO, from London.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear friend,
<DATE>1743.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL send you but a very few lines, being
so much indisposed with a cold, that I can scarce
tell how to connect a sentence. I am just got into
lodgings at a goldsmith's—a dangerous situation,
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
you will say, for <HI>me;</HI> “Actum est, ilicet, periisti!”
Not so;—for of late I have not so violent a taste
for toys as I have had; and I can look even on snuff-boxes
“oculo irretorto.”</P>
<P>LONDON is really dangerous at this time; the
pick-pockets, formerly content with mere <HI>filching,</HI>
make no scruple to knock people down with bludgeons
in <HI>Fleet-street</HI> and the <HI>Strand,</HI> and that at no later
hour than eight o'clock at night: but in the Piazzas,
Covent-garden, they come in large bodies, armed
with couteaus, and attack whole parties, so that the
danger of coming out of the play-houses is of some
weight in the opposite scale, when I am disposed to
go to them oftener than I ought.—There is a poem
of this season, called “The Pleasures of Imagina∣tion,”
worth your reading; but it is an expensive
quarto; if it comes out in a less size, I will bring it
home with me. Mr. Pope (as Mr. Outing, who has
been with Lord Bolingbroke, informs me) is at the
point of death.—My Lord Carteret said yesterday
in the house, “That the French and Spaniards had
actually <HI>said,</HI> they would attempt a second in∣vasion.”—
There is a now play acted at Drury
Lane, “Mahomet,” translated from the French of
Voltaire; but I have no great opinion of the sub∣ject,
or the original author as a poet; and my dif∣fidence
is rather improved by the testimony of those
who have seen it.—I lodge between the two coffee∣houses,
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
George's and Nando's, so that I partake of
the expensiveness of both, as heretofore. I have
no acquaintance in town, and but slender induce∣ment
to stay; and yet, probably, I shall loiter here
for a month.</P>
<P>T—H—was knighted against his will, and had
a demand made upon him for an hundred pounds
before he could get out of St. James's; so soon are
felt the inconveniencies of grandeur!—He came out
of the court in a violent <HI>rage,</HI> “G—d! Jack, what
dost think?—I am knighted!—the devil of a
knight, e'faith!” I believe he was sincere in his
disgust; for there had been two barge-masters knight∣ed
in his neighbourhood some time before.</P>
<P>I SAW, coming up, Lady Fane's grotto, which,
they say, cost her five thousand pounds; about
three times as much as her <HI>house</HI> is worth. It is a
very beautiful disposition of the finest collection of
shells I ever saw—Mr. Powis's woods, which are
finer.—Mean time, if I had three hundred pounds
to lay out about The Leasowes, I could bring my
ambition to peaceable terms. I am, dear Sir, with

<P>I LONG heartily to talk over affairs with you
<HI>téte à tête;</HI> but am an utter enemy to the fatigue
of transcribing what might pass well enough in con∣versation.—
I shall say nothing more concerning my
departure from L—, than that it was necessary,
and therefore excusable.—I have been since with a
gentleman upon the borders of Wales, Bishop's
Castle, from whence I made a digression one day
beyond Offa's Dyke: saw mountains which converted
all that I <HI>had</HI> seen into mole-hills; and houses which
changed The Leasowes into Hampton Court: where
they talk of a glazed window as a piece of magni∣ficence;
and where their highest idea of his Ma∣jesty
is, that he can ride in such a coach as 'Squire
Jones or 'Squire Pryce's. The woman of the inn,
at one place, said, “Glass (in windows) was very
genteel, that it was; but she could not afford such
finery.”</P>
<P>You agree with the rest of the married world in a
propensity to make proselytes. This inclination in
some people gives one a kind of dread of the mat∣ter.
They are ill-natured, and can only wish one
in their own state because they are unhappy; like
persons that have the plague, who, they say, are ever
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
desirous to propagate the infection. I make a con∣trary
conclusion when <HI>you</HI> commend marriage, as
you seem to do, when you wish Miss—may recon∣cile
me to more than the <HI>name</HI> of wife. I know not
what you have heard of my amour: probably <HI>more</HI>
than I can thoroughly confirm to you. And what
if I should say to you, that marriage was not once
the subject of our conversation?</P>
<Q><L>—“Nec conjugis unquam</L>
<L>Preatendi taedas, aut haec in foedera veni.”</L></Q>
<P>Do not you think every thing in nature strangely
improved since you were married, from the tea-table
to the <HI>warming-pau?</HI></P>
<P>I WANT to see Mrs. Jago's hand-writing, that I
may judge of her temper; but she must write some∣thing
in my praise. Pray see you to it, in your
next letter.</P>
<P>I COULD parodize my Lord Carteret's letter from
Dettingen, if I had it by me. “Mrs. Arnold (thanks
be praised!) has this day gained a very considera∣ble victory. The scold lasted two hours. Mrs.
S—e was posted in the hall, and Mrs. Arnold upon
the stain-case; which superiority of ground was of
no small service to her in the engagement. The
fire lasted the whole space, without intermission;
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
at the close of which, the enemy was routed, and
Mrs. Arnold kept the field.”</P>
<P>DID you hear the song to the tune of “The
Cuckow?”</P>
<Q><L>“The Baron stood behind a tree,</L>
<L>In woeful plight, for nought heard he</L>
<L>But Cannon, Cannon, &amp;c.</L>
<L>O word of fear!</L>
<L>Unpleasing to a German ear.”</L></Q>
<P>The notes that fall upon the word “Cannon” ex∣press
the sound with its echo admirably.</P>
<P>I SEND you my pastoral elegy (or ballad, if you
think that name more proper), on condition that
you return it with ample remarks in your next let∣ter:
I say “return it,” because I have no other copy,
and am too indolent to take one. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>XXXII. To Mr. GRAVES, describing his Situation,
and State of Health, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leafowes.</OPENER>
<P>TO-MORROW morning I set out for Chelten∣ham,
to make trial of the waters there. I shall,
perhaps, add to this letter at several stages, and
conclude it at the place to which I am going; so
that, like those springs, you may, perhaps, find it
impregnated with the nature of all those places
through which it passes; perhaps quite the con∣trary.</P>
<P>—, if I mistake not the man, is an encourager
of works of taste, &amp;c. though I am going to in∣stance
this oddly: he was a hearty stickler for my
poem upon Hercules at Bath, as D. Jago sent me
word. Perhaps it was complaisance to Mr. Lyttel∣ton,
with whom, Charles, &amp;c. he is intimate, if,
as I said before, I do not mistake the person. I flat∣ter
myself, I do not; and I hope that we two shall
ever find the same persons, or the same kind of per∣sons,
our friends, and also our enemies.</P>
<P>IF I get over this ill habit of body, depend upon
it, I <HI>will</HI> have a <HI>reverend</HI> care of my health, as
Sir John Falstaff advises the Chief Justice. I solve
all the tempests that disturb my constitution into
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>
<HI>wind:</HI> it plagues me, first, in the shape of a bad
appetite, then indigestion, then lowness of spirits
and a flux of pale water, and at night by watchings,
restlessness, twitchings of my nerves, or a sleep more
distracted than the most active state of watchfulness.
But I think purging lessens all these symptoms, and
I trust my scheme that I am entering upon is right.</P>
<P>I WAS on Monday at Hagley, to wait on Mr.
Lyttelton, who was gone to Sir John Astley's, to see
his grand edifice.—As to Mrs, Lyttelton, if her af∣fability
is not artificial, I mean, if it does not owe
its original (as it <HI>ought to do</HI> its <HI>management</HI>) to art,
I cannot conceive a person more amiable;—but <HI>sense</HI>
and <HI>elegance</HI> cannot be feigned: to <HI>exhibit</HI> them, is
to <HI>have</HI> them.</P>
<P>How is my song set? Miss Carrington procured
it that favour; but I have never seen a copy, nor knew
of its being to be printed. Howard has set another
of mine, which I received last post; but my harp∣sichord
is out of order, and I have found no one yet
to explain the hieroglyphics which convey it. You
may probably find it in some future number of the
British Orpheus. “By the side of a stream, &amp;c.”</P>
<P>I AM in as good spirits this instant as ever I was
in my life: only “Mens turbidum laetatur.” My
head is a little confused; but I often think seriously,
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
that I ought to have the most ardent and <HI>practical</HI>
gratitude (as the Methodists chuse to express them∣selves)
for the advantages that I have: which, though
not eminently shining, are such, to speak the truth,
as suit my particular humour, and consequently
<HI>deserve</HI> all kind of acknowledgement. If a poet
should address himself to God Almighty, with the
most earnest thanks for his goodness in allotting him
an estate that was over-run with shrubs, thickets,
and coppices, variegated with barren rocks and pre∣cipices,
or floated three parts in four with lakes
and marshes, rather than such an equal and fertile
spot as the “sons of men” delight in; to my ap∣prehension,
he would be guilty of no absurdity.—
But of this I have composed a kind of prayer, and
intend to write a little speculation on the subject;
this kind of gratitude I assuredly ought to have,
and have. For my health, if one reflects, a coun∣try-fellow's
stock of it would be unfit for solitude;
would dispose one rather to bodily feats, and, what
Falstaff calls in Poins, <HI>gambol</HI> faculties, than mental
contemplations; and would give one that kind of
pain which springs from <HI>impatience.</HI> My constitution
was given me originally good; and with regard to
it now (as G. Barnwell says) “What am I?—What
<HI>I have made myself.”</HI> Or, to speak with Mil∣ton,
<Q><PB N="81" REF="90"/>
<L>“HIM after all disputes</L>
<L>Force'd I absolve: all my evasions vain,</L>
<L>And reasonings, tho' thro' mazes, only lead</L>
<L>But to my own conviction. First and last</L>
<L>On me, me only, as the source and spring</L>
<L>Of all corruption, all the blame lights due.”</L></Q>
Though this is but vulgarly expressed in Milton
neither.</P>
<P>JAGO has been here this last week, and I drove
him to Dudley Castle, which I long to shew you:
I never saw it (since I was the size of my pen) be∣fore:
it has great romantic beauty, though perhaps
Derbyshire may render it of small note in your
eye.</P>
<P>ONE is tempted to address the K—as Harry the
Eighth does his wife, <HI>mutatis mutandis;</HI>
<Q><L>“Go thy ways, George!</L>
<L>Whoe'er he be that shall assert he has</L>
<L>A <HI>bolder</HI> king, let him in nought be trusted</L>
<L>For saying false in that—”</L></Q></P>
<P>I HAVE a mind to write an ode in praise of him,
and in rivalship of Cibber.—Mine should be of the
ballad style and familiarity, as expressing the senti∣ments
of a person returning from a dislike to a
thorough approbation of him, which seems, at pre∣sent,
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
the sense of the nation.—But herein I am not
in earnest.—</P>
<P>MY pen has run on a whole page at random.
It amuses me to encourage it, and so I will try to
get a frank.</P>
<P>I AM this moment arrived at Cheltenham, after
an expensive and fatiguing journey. I called yester∣day
at Mickleton; saw the portico, and snapped up
a bit of mutton at your brother's; drank a dish of
tea with Miss S—; and, in opposition to the strongest
remonstrances, persisted in an endeavour to reach
Cheltenham after five o'clock. The consequence
was, that, about ten, I found myself travelling back
again towards Stowe; and had undoubtedly wander∣ed
all right in the dark, had I not been fortunately
met by a waggoner's servant, who brought me back
to the worst inn but one I ever lay at, being his
master's.—Here I am: which is all I shall say in this
letter.</P>

<HEAD>XXXIII. To Mr. JAGO, on the same.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Leasowes, Saturday,
<DATE>July the 9th, 1743.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not a contrived apology, or an excuse, which
I am going to offer for the disappointments I
have given you. I have actually been so much out
of order ever since I wrote to you, nay, ever since
I <HI>formed a design</HI> of a Sunday expedition to L—,
that it never has been in my <HI>power</HI> to execute my
intentions. My vertigo has not <HI>yet</HI> taken away my
senses: God knows how soon it may do; but my
nerves are in such a condition, that I can scarce get
a wink of even <HI>disordered</HI> rest for whole nights toge∣ther.
May you never know the misery of such
involuntary vigils? I ride every day almost to fa∣tigue;
which only tends to make my want of sleep
more <HI>sensible,</HI> and not in the least to remove it. I
have <HI>spirits</HI> all day, good ones; though my head is
dizzy, and I never enterprize any study of greater
subtlety than a news-paper. I cannot say the journey
to L—would be at all <HI>formidable</HI> to me; for I
ride about fifteen miles, as I compute it, every day
before dinner. But the nights from home would
be insupportable to me. I have fatigued Mrs. Ar∣nold's
assiduity, to the injury of her health; by oc∣casioning
her to sit in my room a'nights, light my
candle, put it out again, make me perspiratory
<PB N="84" REF="93"/>
wheys, and slops; and am amused by the most silly
animadversions she is capable of making. I never
knew her usefulness till now; but I <HI>now</HI> prefer her
to <HI>all of her station.</HI> If I get over this disorder, con∣cerning
which I have bad apprehensions, you may
depend upon seeing me the first Sunday I dare ven∣ture
forth. I hope <HI>you</HI> continue mending. The be∣nefit
of <HI>riding</HI> is only not universal, and would cure
<HI>me</HI> too, could I but make one previous advance to∣wards
health. Have you tried cold-bathing? Per∣haps
it may not suit your case. I wish I had not
dropt it. I take my fluctuation of nerves to be
caused, as that of the sea is, by wind; which I am
continually pumping up, and yet find it still renew∣ed.
When I am just sinking to sleep, a sudden
twitch of my nerves calls me back again—to watch∣fulness
and vexation! I consider myself as in the
state of the philosopher, who held a bullet betwixt
his finger and thumb, which, whenever he was about
to nod, was ordered so as to fall into a large brass
pan, and wake him—that he might pursue his lucu∣brations.</P>
<P>I WILL mention one circumstance regarding the
weakness of my nerves;—and not my spirits, for
I told you those were tolerable:—the least noise that
is, even the falling of a fire-shovel upon the floor,
if it happen unexpectedly, shocks my whole frame;
and I actually believe that a gun fired behind my
<PB N="85" REF="94"/>
back, unawares, amidst the stillness of the night,
would go near to kill me with its noise.</P>
<P>I AM just going to bed; and dare not be any more
attentive, as I hope to close my eyes for a minute.
So fare you well!</P>
<P>IT is now six o'clock in the morning, and I have
had about five hours middling sleep; which encou∣rages
me greatly: so I will <HI>hope</HI> to be able to see
you next Sunday sevennight.</P>
<P>WHAT think you of the battle? Are not you
so much in love with our King, that you could find
in your heart to serve him in any profitable post he
might assign you?</P>
<P>CAPT. L—is wounded in the thigh.</P>
<P>WHEN I ride in my chair round my neighbour∣hood,
I am as much stared and wondered at, as a
giant would be that should walk through Pall-mall.
My vehicle is at <HI>least as</HI> uncommon hereabouts as
a blazing comet. My chief pleasure lies in finding
out a thousand roads, and delightful little haunts
near home, which I never dreamt of: egregious
solitudes, and most incomparable bye-lanes; where
I can as effectually lose myself within a mile of home,
as if I were benighted in the desarts of Arabia. Adieu!</P>

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
<DATE>July 3, 1743.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not part from you without a <HI>great deal</HI> of
melancholy. To think of the <HI>short</HI> duration of
those interviews which are the objects of one's <HI>con∣tinual</HI>
wishes, has been a reflection that has plagued
me of old! I am sure I returned home with it then,
more aggravated, as I foresaw myself returning to
the same series of melancholy hours from which you
had a while relieved me, and which I had <HI>particularly</HI>
suffered under all this last spring! I wish to God,
you might happen to be settled not far from me:
a day's journey distance, however; I mean, an <HI>easy</HI>
one. But the odds are infinitely against me. I
must only <HI>rely</HI> for my happiness on the hopes of a
never-ceasing correspondence!</P>
<P>SOON after you were gone, I received my packet.
The history of Worcestershire is mere stuff. T—
I am so fond of, that, I believe, I shall have his part
of the collection bound over again, neatly and sepa∣rately.
But sure Hammond has no right to the least
<HI>inventive</HI> merit, as the preface-writer would insinuate.
I do not think there is a single thought, of any
eminence, that is not literally translated. I am
astonished he could content himself with being so lit∣tle
an original.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="96"/>
MR Lyttelton and his lady are at Hagley. A
malignant caterpillar has demolished the beauty of
all our <HI>large</HI> oaks. Mine are secured by their lit∣tleness.
But, I guess, the park suffers; a large wood
near me being a mere winter piece for nakedness.</P>
<P>AT present, I give myself up to riding and thought∣lessness;
being resolved to make trial of <HI>their</HI> efficacy
towards a tolerable degree of health and spirits.
I wish I had you for my director. I should proceed
with great confidence of success; though I am
brought very low by two or three fits of a fever
since I saw you. Had I written to you in the midst
of my dispirited condition, as I was going, you would
have had a more tender and unaffected letter than
I <HI>can</HI> write at another time: what I think, perhaps,
at all times; but what sickness can alone elicit from
a temper fearful of whining.</P>
<P>SURELY the “nunc formosissimus annus” is to be
limited to hay-harvest. I could give my reasons: but
you will imagine them to be, the activity of country
people in a pleasing employment; the full verdure
of the summer; the prime of pinks, woodbines, jas∣mines,
&amp;c. I am old; very old; for few things
give me so much mechanical pleasure as lolling on a
bank in the very heat of the sun,
<Q><L>“When the old come forth to play</L>
<L>On a sun-shine holiday—”</L></Q>
<PB N="88" REF="97"/>
And yet it is as much as I can do to keep Mrs. Ar∣nold
from going to neighbouring houses in her smock,
in de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pite of decency and my known disapprobation.</P>
<P>I FIND myself more of a patriot than l ever thought
I was. Upon reading the account of the battle, I
found a very sensible pleasure, or, as the Methodists
term it, perceived my heart <HI>enlarged,</HI> &amp;c. The map
you sent me is a pretty kind of <HI>toy,</HI> but does not
enough particularize the scenes of the war, &amp;c. which
was the end I had in view when I sent for it.</P>
<P>“O DURA messorum ilia!” About half the ap∣petite,

—You contrive interviews of about a minute's du∣ration;

I do insist upon it, that you ought to compound for
the disappointment you have caused me, by a little

see you till next summer, or spring at soonest;
and then I may probably take occasion to visit you,

places. I am grateful for your intentions with re∣gard
to giving me part of them, and impertinent
in desiring you to convey them to me as soon as
you can well spare them. Let me know if they are
sold separately at the print-shops. I think to re∣commend
them to my new acquaintance, Mr. Lyt∣telton
Brown. I like the humour of the ballad you
mention, but am more obliged for your partial opi∣nion

“Cannon, Cannon,” are admirably expressive of the
sound, I dare say: I mean, jointly with its echo;

to go to Bath previously to my London-journey;
though I look upon it as a proper method to make
my residence in town more agreeable. I shall, pro∣bably,
be there about the first of December; or be∣fore,
if I can accelerate my friend Whistler's journey.

<HEAD>XXXVI. To the same, on the Receipt of a Present
of Prints.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
The Leasowes, <DATE>Dec. 23, 1743.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may reasonably have expected a letter be∣fore
now, either as an acknowledgement for
your genteel present, or at least by way of informa∣tion
that I had received it. The prints have given
me a pleasure, which, however considerable, would
soon have languished, if I had bought them at a
shop; but which is now built upon the esteem I
have for the giver, and cannot have a more durable
foundation.—As for the rest, I am most pleased with
the view of Matlock, and shall have no peace of
mind till I have seen the original. I have been gild∣ing
the frames, and wishing all the while for your
company.</P>
<P>I WILL alter the ballad according to your advice;
dividing it into three parts, and adding a stanza or
two to the shortest, some time or other. I have had
no opportunity of trying the tunes. “Arno's vale”
has pretty words, and recommends itself to one's
imagination by the probability that it was written
on a real occasion—the similitude of rhimes in the
close inexcusable. For all that has been the subject
of my letter hitherto, as the country people say, I
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>
can but thank you, and I do very sincerely; thongh
as to the songs I will re-pay you.</P>
<P>I HAVE your poem by me, which I have read often
with the greatest pleasure. I have many observations
to make; and only defer the communication till I
know whether you have a copy at Tissington to turn
to. I think, the most <HI>polite</HI> and <HI>suitable</HI> title to it
would run thus: “The Villa, a Poem; containing a
Sketch of the present Taste in Rural Embellish∣ments,
written in 1740.” Your preface has a pret∣ty
thought towards the close; otherwise is on no ac∣count
to be admitted. Pardon my freedom; but, I
think, there is no manner of occasion for a preface;
and those strokes, which I <HI>know</HI> to be real modesty in
<HI>you,</HI> the world will undoubtedly impute to affectation.—If
you give me encouragement, I will be very mi∣nute
in my criticisms, allowing you to reject ten to
one that you admit of.</P>
<P><HI>WHISTLER</HI> is gone to Bristol, and has bilked me.—I
said, he is gone; but, I believe, he is only upon
going—I linger at home, in hopes of gleaning up a
little health, and through a dread of being ill in a
place where I can be less attended on.—I can conti∣nually
<HI>find out</HI> something in my preceding diet that,
I <HI>think,</HI> disorders me; so that I am constantly in hopes
of growing well:—but, perhaps, I never shall:
<Q><PB N="93" REF="102"/>
<L>“Optima quaeque dies miseris mortalibus aevi</L>
<L><HI>Prima</HI> fugit, subeunt morbi.—”</L></Q></P>
<P>WHEN I was a school-boy, I never knew there <HI>was
any such thing</HI> as perspiration; and now, half my time
is taken up in considering the immediate connexion
betwixt that and health, and endeavouring to promote
it.</P>
<P>MR. Lyttelton has built a kind of alcove in his
park, inscribed, “SEDES CONTEMPLATIONIS,” near
his hermitage. Under the aforesaid inscription is
“OMNIA VANITAS:”—the sides ornamented with
sheeps-bones, jaws, sculls, &amp;c. festoon-wise. In a
nitch over it, an owl.</P>
<P>As to schemes, I have none with regard to the
world, women, or books. And I hate, and have
deferred writing to you (for some days) for that rea∣son.
I am sick of exhibiting so much sameness:—
I am constantly poring over some Classic, which I
consider as one of Idleness's better shapes. But I
am impatient to be doing something that may tend
to better my situation in some respect or other. It
is <HI>encouragement</HI> can alone inspire one.
<Q><L>—“Multa &amp; praeclare minantem</L>
<L>Vivere nec <HI>recte,</HI> nec <HI>suaviter</HI>—”</L></Q>
expresses the whole of me. Thus my epistles per∣severe
in the plaintive style; and I question whether
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
the sight of them does not, ere now, give you the
vapours. I have an old aunt that visits me some∣times,
whose conversation is the perfect counterpart
of them. She shall fetch a long-winded sigh with
Dr. Young for a wager; though I fee <HI>his</HI> Suspiria
are not yet finished. He has <HI>relapsed</HI> into “Night
the Fifth.” I take his case to be wind in a great
measure, and would advise him to take rhubarb in
powder, with a little nutmeg grated amongst it, as
I do.</P>

<HEAD>XXXVII. To the same, with Observations on Hy∣pocrisy,
&amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
<DATE>1743.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOU must know, my last letter to you was
written before I received yours from Tissington;
and I should take shame upon myself for not answer∣ing
it, were I not furnished with this excuse—that
I waited for a frank for you.—There are but few
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
things I have to say to you, and such as are not worth
transcribing; yet, as our distance from one another
requires it, I will scrawl them over as negligently as
I can, to let you see I lay no stress upon them.
A good excuse for laziness! you will say: and lazy
enough I am, God knows!—I believe, any one who
knows me thoroughly will think, that there never
was so great an inconsistence as there is betwixt my
words (in my poem) and my actions.—This is what
the world calls hypocrisy, and is determined to look
upon with <HI>peculiar</HI> aversion. But, I think, the hy∣pocrite
is a <HI>half</HI>-good character. A man certainly,
considering the force of precedent, deserves some praise
who keeps up appearances; and is, no doubt, as
much to be commended for talking better than he
acts, as he is to be blamed for acting worse than he
talks. So much for casuistry. I would seem, you
must know, to have some meritorious views in talk∣ing
<HI>virtuously;</HI> but who does not know that every
one who writes poetry looks directly with his face
towards praise, and whatever else his eye takes in
is viewed obliquely? Praise, as I said to foible-con∣fessing
W—, is the desired, the noted, and the ade∣quate
reward of poetry; in which sort he that re∣wards
me, Heaven reward him, as Sir John Falstaff
says. There is something very vain in repeating
my own sayings; but I could not conscientiously
use a joke to you which I had used in another let∣ter,
without owning it.—In short, it is necessary to
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>
have some <HI>earthly</HI> aim in view; the next world,
whether it be in reality near or far off, is always
<HI>seen</HI> at a distance. All that the generality of young
people can do is, to act <HI>consistently with</HI> their ex∣pectations
there. Now, though same, &amp;c. be obvi∣ously
enough in the eye of reason dissatisfactory;
yet it is proper enough to suffer one's self to be de∣luded
with the hopes of it, that is, it is proper
to cherish some worldly hopes, that one may avoid
impatience, spleen, and one sort of <HI>despair:</HI> I mean
that of having no <HI>hopes</HI> here, because one sees no∣thing
here that deserves them. If I were in your
case, I would make all the efforts I was able towards
being a Bishop. That should be my earthly aim:
not but I would act with so much indifference as to
bear all disappointment unconcernedly—as, I dare
say, you will.—There is but one passion that I put
upon an equally sprightly footing with ambition,
and that is love; which, as it <HI>regularly tends</HI> to ma∣trimony,
requires certain favours from fortune and
circumstance to render it proper to indulge in.—
By this time you think me crazed—as it often hap∣pens
to me to doubt, <HI>seriously,</HI> whether I am not:
but if it be the “mentis gratissimus error,” I do
not mind. You are very obliging to endeavour to
continue my madness and vanity.—I should be as
glad to see Mr. Graves your brother as any one I
know: I live in a manner wherein he would find many
things to exercise his good-nature.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="106"/>
PAMELA would have made one good volume: and I
wonder the author, who has some <HI>nice</HI> natural strokes,
should not have sense enough to see that.—I beg you
will collect all the hints, &amp;c. of your own, or others,
that you think may tend to the improvement of my
poem, against winter; that you would mention any
flat lines, &amp;c. Write me word some time ere you

<P>YOU are upon very <HI>good</HI> terms with me, and

your silence, and have been sincerely sorry for them;
not however that I did not believe you were more

for money-bags.—I am really going to London; and
am about the purchase of an elegant pair of pistols
from Birmingham. I indulge myself in this expence,
because they shall serve in two capacities; one while
<PB N="98" REF="107"/>
to garnish my chair, another while my horse. And
some time next week you will probably see your old

But I am perfectly impatient to unbosom

<HEAD>XXXIX. To Mr. GRAVES, on Social Happiness.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
<DATE>About 1745.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is not a syllable you tell me concerning
yourself in your last letter, but what applied
to <HI>me</HI> is most literally true. I am sensible of the
daily progress I make towards insignificancy, and
it will not be many years before you see me ar∣rived
at the <HI>ne plus ultra.</HI> I believe it is absolutely
impossible for me to acquire a considerable degree
of knowledge, though I can understand things well
enough at the time I read them. I remember a
preacher at St. Mary's (I think it was Mr. E—)
trade a notable distinction betwixt <HI>apprehension</HI> and
<PB N="101" REF="110"/>
<HI>comprehension.</HI> If there be a real difference, pro∣bably
it may find a place in the explication of my
genius. I envy you a good <HI>general</HI> insight into the
writings of the learned. I must aim at nothing
higher than a well-concealed ignorance.—I was think∣ing,
upon reading your setter, <HI>when</HI> it was that you
and Mr. Whistler and I went out of the road of hap∣piness.
It certainly was where we first deviated
from the turnpike-road of life. Wives, children,
alliances, visits, &amp;c. are necessary objects of our so∣cial
passions; and whether or no we can, through
particular circumstances, be happy <HI>with,</HI> I think it
plain enough that it is not possible to be happy <HI>with∣out</HI>
them. All attachments to inanimate beauties,
to curiosities, and ornaments, satiate us presently.—
The fanciful tribe has the disadvantage to be natural∣ly
prone to err in the choice of <HI>lasting</HI> pleasures:
and when our passions have habitually wandered,
it is too difficult to reduce them into their proper
chanels. When this is the case, nothing but the
change or variety of amusements stands any chance
to make us easy, and it is not long ere the whole
species is exhausted. I agree with you entirely in
the necessity of a <HI>sociable</HI> life in order to be happy:
I do not think it much a paradox, that any com∣pany
is better than <HI>none.</HI> I think it obvious enough
as to the present hour; and as to any future influence,
solitude has exceeding savage effects on our dis∣positions.—
I have wrote out my elegy: I lay no man∣ner
<PB N="102" REF="111"/>
of stress but upon the piety of it.—Would it
not be a good kind of motto, applied to a person
you know, that might be taken from what is said of
<HI>Ophelia</HI> in <HI>Hamlet,</HI>
<Q><L>“I tell thee, faithless priest!</L>
<L>A ministring angel shall Ophelia be</L>
<L>When thou art howling.”</L></Q></P>
<P>I HAVE amused myself often with this species of
writing since you saw me; partly to divert my present
<HI>impatience,</HI> and partly as it will be a picture of most
that passes in my mind; a portrait which <HI>friends</HI> may
value.—I should be glad of your profile: if you have
objections, I drop my request.—I should be heartily
glad if you would come and live with me, for any
space of time that you could find convenient. But
I will depend on your coming over with Mr. Whistler
in the spring. I may possibly take a jaunt towards
yon ere long: the road would furnish me out some
visits; and, by the time I reached you, perhaps,
afford me a kind of climax of happiness. If I do
not, I shall perhaps be a little time at Bath. I
do not speak of this last as a scheme from which I
entertain great expectations of pleasure. It is long
since I have considered my self as <HI>undone.</HI> The <HI>world</HI>
will not perhaps consider me in that light entirely,
till I have married my maid. Adieu!</P>

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Nov. 22, 1745.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>MY life, for aught I fee, will pass away just
as it <HI>has</HI> done, without introducing sufficient
improvement into my circumstances to give a cheer∣ful
cast to my correspondence. In <HI>one</HI> respect, in
regard to my inviolable friendship for <HI>you,</HI> I hope
you will hear with some satisfaction that I continue
still the same. And this kind of <HI>identity,</HI> I think, I
could promise you, though every circumstance in my
fortune, every particle of my body, were changed;
and others, ever so heterogeneous, substituted in
their place. After this, it would be no compliment
to say, that the <HI>pretended</HI> heir to these kingdoms
could not alter it, were he to subvert the British con∣stitution;
which must, out of all doubt, be the consequence
of his success. The rebellion, you may
guess,
is the subject of all conversation. Every in∣dividual
nailer here takes in a news-paper (a more
<HI>pregnant</HI> one by far than any of the London ones),
and talks as familiarly of <HI>kings</HI> and <HI>princes</HI> as ever
Master Shallow did of John of Gaunt. Indeed it
is no bad thing that they do so; for I cannot con∣ceive
that the people want so much to be convinced
by <HI>sermons</HI> of the absurdities of <HI>popery,</HI> as they do by
<PB N="104" REF="113"/>
<HI>news-papers</HI> that <HI>it</HI> may <HI>possibly</HI> prevail. The rea∣sons
and arguments too in favour of the present Go∣vernment
are so <HI>strong</HI> and <HI>obvious,</HI> that even I,
and every country 'squire, and every country clerk,
and Sam Shaw the taylor, seem to be as much
masters of them as the Bishops themselves. I must
not say we could express them so politely.—I like
Secker's the best of any sermon on this occasion.
He gives his audience a view of such evil conse∣quences
from a <HI>change,</HI> as no man of sense can
possibly doubt of, when fairly stated: and, I own,
I cannot see one single <HI>good</HI> it could produce, in com∣pensation
for its inevitable and abundant <HI>mischiefs.</HI>—
I have read Dr. Sherlock's sermon on this occasion:
and I have read Mr. Warburton's; and, at your
request, I will read his Legation.</P>
<P>I HAVE often thoughts of a jaunt as far as your
country this winter. Some kind of pilgrimage I
must make, to avoid a lethargy.—Public places I
want to visit a little; to peep at and renew my idea
of the <HI>world's</HI> vanity; but either Bath, or London
would steep me so far in poverty, that I should not
probably emerge before the middle of next summer.
I have spent this last summer agreeably enough with
some of my young relations, Mr. Dolman's children.—They
have an excellent taste for their years.—
I have been upon several jaunts with the son to
Litchfield, Worcester, Mr. Fletcher's, &amp;c. amusing
<PB N="105" REF="114"/>
him, what I could, under the loss of his father.
Miss W—F—asked very earnestly after you. Two
of the sisters have been with me at The Leasowes,
and upon several parties of pleasure in my chair.—
Broom is disposed of—I do not understand upon what
inducement.—After all, I am miserable;—con∣scious
to myself that I am too little selfish; that
I ought now or never to aim at some addition
to my fortune; and that I make large advances to∣wards
the common catastrophe of <HI>better</HI> poets, po∣verty.—
I never can attend enough to some twelve-penny
matter, on which a great deal depends.—My
amour, so far as I indulge it, gives me some pleasure,
and no pain in the world.—I have read Spenser
once again: and I have added full as much more
to my <HI>School-mistress,</HI> in regard to <HI>number of lines;
something</HI> in point of <HI>matter</HI> (or <HI>manner</HI> rather) <HI>which</HI>
does not displease me. I would be glad if Mr.—were,
upon your request, to give his opinion of par∣ticulars,
for two reasons; as you say he has some
taste for this kind of writing, and as he is my enemy,
and would, therefore, find out its deficiencies.</P>

<HEAD>XLI. To the same, with Remarks on the Execution
and Behaviour of the Lords Kilmarnock and Bal∣merino.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Grave,
1746, ineunte anno.</OPENER>
<P>I BELIEVE it is impossible for me to disagree
with you on any other score, than the scanty
pittances you allot me of your company; and, if I
have disclosed any symptoms of resentment on that
account, you will, perhaps, overlook them, out of
regard to the motive from which they proceeded.—
I thank you for your perusal of that trivial poem.
If I were going to print it, I should give way to your
remarks <HI>implicitly,</HI> and would not <HI>dare</HI> to do other∣wise.
But so long as I keep it in manuscript, you
will pardon my silly prejudices, if I chuse to read
and shew it with the addition of most of my new
stanzas. I own, I have a fondness for several, imagin∣ing
them to be <HI>more</HI> in Spenser's way, yet more in∣dependent
on the antique phrase, than any part of
the poem; and, on that account, I cannot yet pre∣vail
on myself to banish <HI>them</HI> entirely; but were I
to print, I should (with <HI>some</HI> reluctance) give way
to your sentiments (which I know are jus), namely,
that they render the work too diffuse and flimzy, and
seem rather excrescences than essential parts of it.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="116"/>
BUT of these things I say no more now. I pur∣pose
staying a month with Mr. Whistler in Decem∣ber,
if it suits him; and then I hope I shall have a
great deal of your company. Let me hear some∣thing
in your next of your <HI>domestic affairs.</HI> I beg
you would not make any grand decision, without
giving me some previous information. I esteem this
as due to the friendship I have so long professed for
you, and from the friendship you have so long pro∣fessed
for me.</P>
<P>I LOOK upon the death of the two Lords as equally
decent upon their respective principles. Lord Kil∣marnock,
I suppose, joined the rebels through a view
of bettering his circumstances, consceious to himself
that he was guilty of a crime the moment he did so.
This is agreeable to his speech before the Lords,
and to that melancholy which he discovered upon
the scaffold. Death, aggravated by guilt, would sit
heavier upon him than upon the other, even sup∣posing
him to have had the same resolution. Bal∣merino's
life was quite <HI>unie,</HI> and his death equal to
the character he aimed at. We are to observe, that
he meant to suffer as a Friend to the Stewarts, a Sol∣dier,
and a Scotsman. The first he manifested when
he came out of the Tower, by his reply of “God save
King J—s;” the second, by his dress, and num∣berless
ostentations of intrepidity; the last, by his
plaid night-cap. Did you hear the story of his send∣ing
<PB N="108" REF="117"/>
a message to Lord Kilmarnock? “That he had
been practising how to lye upon the block; and
had found out, the easiest way of receiving the
blow was, to bite his tongue hard: or even if
he bit it off, it was no matter, they should have
no further nse for it.” His behaviour seems to
have wanted coolness, or else to equal that of Adrian,
Cato, Sir T. More, &amp;c. or any of those heroes who
had spirit enough to make an ostentation of their
unconcern. I had, from the printed accounts of
their behaviour, an idea of their persons, exactly
conformable to the description I read afterwards in

<HEAD>XLII. To the same, with a new Theory of Political
Principles.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,</OPENER>
<P>I HAVE lately received a letter from Mr. Whist∣ler,
which conveys your compliments to me, and,
by so doing, prompts me to acknowledge the re∣ceipt
of your last kind letter. I observe you adhere
strictly to the apostolical precept of being “swift
to <HI>hear,</HI> slow to <HI>speak;</HI>” the latter part of which, I
would fain conclude, you understand too literally.</P>
<P>YOUR neighbour, I see, is not a little embarrassed
with his mills at Whitchurch I have long had an
eye upon his advertisement in the London Evening
Post, and been not a little scandalized thereat.
What has the name of a poet to do with the pub∣lication
of lands and tenements? or the idea of
harmony with the noise of a water-mill? yet has
<PB N="110" REF="119"/>
he extracted music from the subject, and mirth from
his misfortunes; having sent me a ballad upon the
miller, written with much ease and some drollery.</P>
<P>As to the light in which you place your present
fortunes, I can only say, that you have not that
situation I could wish you for your <HI>own sake:</HI> for
so far as I am concerned in your elevation, I can
assure you very faithfully, that no circumstances in
the world could more endear you to my affection,
or recommend you to my respect, than the present.
My <HI>affection,</HI> you will easily observe, from the very
<HI>nature</HI> of affection in general, would stand no chance
to be increased by your promotion; and as for re∣spect,
if I knew the degree you desired, I would
acquit myself of it to your satisfaction <HI>now;</HI> and were
you settled at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> I should expect that you
would require no <HI>more</HI> from me upon that account;
at least in private: so that, so far as either <HI>deference</HI>
or <HI>friendship</HI> is concerned, you are an Archbishop to
<HI>me</HI> to all intents and purposes.—As to figure in the
world, it depends much, I know, upon advance∣ment;
and yet even here you will be ever <HI>sure</HI> of
that kind of weight which ingenuity gives; dis∣cernible
to the <HI>smaller</HI> indeed, but undoubtedly the
more <HI>valuable</HI> part of the world;—but this is im∣proper,
as it is <HI>philosophy,</HI> and as it is <HI>advice;</HI> nei∣ther
of which is it suitable for me to suggest to
you—“Alcinoo Poma, &amp;c.” As to the long series
<PB N="111" REF="120"/>
of <HI>my</HI> lamentations, I will not now enter upon the
reasonableness of them. It is a subject, to tell you
the truth, on which you cannot reply without some
danger of hurting me.—As for politics (you will
blame this letter for dwelling so much upon the sub∣ject
of yours); but as for politics, I think <HI>poets</HI> are
<HI>tories</HI> by nature, supposing them to be by nature
poets.—The love of an individual person or family,
that has worn a crown for many successions, is an in∣clination
greatly adapted to the fanciful tribe. On
the other hand, mathematicians, abstract-reasoners,
of no manner of attachment to persons, at least to
the <HI>visible</HI> part of them, but prodigiously devoted
to the ideas of virtue, liberty, interest, and so forth,
are generally <HI>whigs.</HI> It happens agreeably enough to
this maxim, that the whigs are friends to that wise,
plodding, un-poetical people the Dutch—the to∣ries,
on the other hand, are taken mightily with
that shewy, ostentatious nation the French. Fox∣hunters,
that reside amongst the beauties of nature,
and bid defiance to art, in short, that have intellects
of a poetical <HI>turn,</HI> are frequently tories—citizens,
merchants, &amp;c. that scarce see what nature is, and
consequently have no pretensions to a poetical taste,
are, I think, generally argumentative and whiggish;—
but perhaps I carry this too far.—Something there
is in it, however, you will see: not that I would ap∣ply
what I here say to particular revolutions, &amp;c.
I would only advance something general and specu∣lative.
<PB N="112" REF="121"/>
Nor would I approve or condemn by this
any one set of people now existing. Nor would I
have you pretend to fish out my party from any
thing I have said; for I am of none.—The letter I
sent you last was <HI>occasional,</HI> and when I fee you I
will tell you the occasion. I absolutely agree with
you in every little of your political observations.—
I am glad I do; for I know the poisonous nature of
party: and though we are <HI>neither</HI> violent, yet I
should fear it. My schemes are <HI>doubtful</HI> at present,
but my face is set towards Bath.—I am confident
of the service those waters would do me.—I hope
you will exhilarate me with a letter soon.—I would
fain have furnished out a letter to amuse you after
so long a silence, but I find myself unable; even <HI>as</HI>
unable as I am to express the regard with, which I
am</P>

<HEAD>XLIII. Continuation of the same.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>May 11, 1746.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I feel an irresisible propensity to
write to you this very post, yet I cannot say that
I am able to advance any thing tending either to your
<PB N="113" REF="122"/>
own or my satisfaction.—What is worst of all is, I
cannot fix the time of seeing you with smuch pre∣cision
as I would always endeavour where my pleasure
is so much concerned—I will tell you the whole af∣fair.—I
have for a long season purposed to drink the
Bath waters this spring; and <HI>did</HI> think of setting out
in a week's time, when I received your letter, pur∣posing
to stay there a month; and from thence take
a circuit which should indulge me in a sight of you,
Mr. Whistler, and some few others, in my way home.
The latter part of this scheme (though far the more
agreeable to me) was rather doubtful and precari∣ous;
depending (as you express it) on the state of my
finances after a month's continuance at Bath; which
I considered, and <HI>do</HI> consider, as a very probable means
of bettering my constitution.—Now I covet to see you
so much, that I would bring nothing but health in
competition.—What I wish is, that you could, with
convenience, either <HI>hasten</HI> or <HI>delay</HI> your journey, that
you might find me before mine, or after my return,
though I should infinitely, and for many reasons, pre∣fer
the former. I long to talk with you particularly
now. I have much to say in regard to our friend's
amour, to which you alluded in your last. I request
it as a favour of you, that you would conjure him,
by the friendship I have ever born him, and by any
esteem which he has ever professed for me, that he
would do nothing very <HI>material</HI> in the affair till I
<PB N="114" REF="123"/>
have talked it over, and given him my faithful
sentiments, “quod censet amiculus.”</P>
<P>I AM not willing the balance should turn entirely
on the whig side: I would give it a greater equili∣brium,
if the following suggestion might effect it.
Tories, I said, have great, and sometimes partial
affections for the <HI>person</HI> of a king.—We will suppose
that kings are alternately good and bad: their loyal∣ty
to the good one is commendable; their partiality
to the bad one not to be vindicated. Whigs have
<HI>no</HI> passion, <HI>no</HI> gratitude, towards the good prince:
there they are wrong. They are severe upon the bad
one, in which they are justifiable. I wish I had not
begun these wholesale distinctions, this miserable
specimen of my politics. I protest against all episto∣lary
disputes. I am now embarrassed in one, on
much such another score, which fills up all my let∣ter;
for I love the last word, like a scold or a child.—I
thank you for your little anecdotes from time
to time: you may depend upon it, that I have
never heard any thing <HI>before;</HI> for I never <HI>do</HI> hear any thing.—I am one very thankful letter in debt
to your neighbour Whistler. I have at present no∣thing
but the <HI>propensity</HI> of a good correspondent; but
I will write soon. In the mean time, if you see
him, ask him if he goes to Bath or Bristol this sea∣son.—
I beg you would write to me directly <HI>when</HI>
you can come, and how I may regulate my motions
<PB N="115" REF="124"/>
so as to be best assured of seeing you.—Pray do not
neglect a post. I am</P>

<HEAD>XLIV. To the same, on the Mixture of Pleasure
and Pain.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>June the last, 1747.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now, I believe, near half a year since I had
the favour of a letter from you. When I wrote
last, I discovered a more than ordinary solicitude for
<HI>one</HI> immediate answer. It puzzles me to account for
your unusual silence, otherwise than upon supposition
of some offence you have taken: and it puzzles me
as much to guess by what behaviour of mine I have
been so unhappy as to give you that offence.</P>
<P>I AM vain enough to imagine that the little me∣rit
I have, deserves somewhat more regard than I
have met with from the world. Be that as it will,
the disappointment I must undergo, by any <HI>appearance</HI> of neglect from the friends I value, would more
effectually dispirit me than any other whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="125"/>
I HAVE published my design of visiting you, and
Mr. Whistler in Oxfordshire, to all the world. A
thousand incidents have hitherto interfered with it,
which I will not now recount. But when I look
back upon the regular succession of them, it looks as
if Destiny had some hand in detaining me. The
most <HI>vigorous</HI> of my <HI>hopes</HI> dwell upon seeing you next
winter, though I am not a little indulgent to <HI>those</HI>
that tell me I may see you long before.</P>
<P>I HAVE brought my place here to greater per∣fection
than it has ever yet appeared in; and, with
the <HI>mob,</HI> it is in some vogue. Nevertheless, I do not
know that I ever relished if less in my life than I
have done this summer. Bad health, bad spirits, no
company to my mind, and no correspondences, are
enough to blast the sweetest shades, and to poison
the purest fountains. Some of these misfortunes I
can impute to my own misconduct, and it embitters
them. The two lst I can less account for, having
at all times done all I was able to recommend my∣self
to my <HI>friends,</HI> behaving at the same time with
courtesy to the rest of the world. The fact is not
true; otherwise I might resolve it into this, that I
alone am idle, and all the world is <HI>busy.</HI></P>
<P>I FANCY you will imagine I lay too much stress
upon Mr. Thomson's visit, when I mention the fol∣lowing
inscription upon a seat in Virgil's grove:
<PB N="117" REF="126"/>
<Q><L>“CELEB 'MO POETAE</L>
<L>IACOBO THOMSON, S.</L>
<L>PROPE FONTES ILLI NON FASTIDITOS</L>
<L>G. S.</L>
<L>SEDEM HANC ORNAVIT.”</L>
<L>“Quae tibi, quae tali reddam pro carmine dona?</L>

<L>Nec percussa juvant fluctu tam litora, nee quae</L>
<L>Saxosas inter decurrunt flumina valles.”</L>
<L>VIRG.</L></Q>
I want your opinion of it, and whether it were not
better, thus,
<Q><L>“—THOMSON,</L>
<L>QVI CVM QVICQVID VBIQVE RVRIS EST</L>
<L>AVT AMOENVM AVT VARIVM</L>
<L>MIRE DEPINXERAT,</L>
<L>HOS ETIAM FONTES NON FASTIDIVIT.”</L></Q>
But you will discover at first glance an impropriety
in both.—Now I am upon inscriptions, I send you
one from a coin dug up very near me a few weeks
ago:
<Q><L>Round the head,</L>
<L>“IMP.... V AVG GER DAC M”</L>
<L>On the reverse,</L>
<L>“SP QR OPTIMO PRINCIPI COS VI”</L></Q>
<PB N="118" REF="127"/>
Within which is an human figure fitting, with one
hand reclined upon a wand; the other, as I take it,
holding forth an olive.—I have given my opinion,
it is one of Trajan's; and my virtuoso character
will rest upon the truth of it. It is a silver coin,
but very obscure. There appears a large mass of
ruins, rough stone, very strongly cemented, where
they found it.—If you were here, it might amuse
you.</P>
<P>HEAVINESS may endure for a night, but joy
cometh in the morning.—I have so settled a notion
of the proportionate mixture of pleasure and pain in
this life, that I expect one to succeed the other as
naturally as day and night. I own, this is owing
to the soul as much as to outward incidents. Sor∣row
prepares it for mirth, and <HI>vice versa.</HI>—The du∣rations
of both differ.—Last summer I spent agreea∣bly;
this quite otherwise.—To-day I have been quite
melancholy; I expect happiness to-morrow, from ei∣ther
an aptitude of mind, or some incident sufficient
to overcome its inaptitude.—Perhaps that incident
may be a letter from you; I wish it may, and am
most truly</P>

<HEAD>XLV. To the same, with Thoughts on Advice.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Lensowes,
<DATE>Sept. 21, 1747.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM under some apprehension that you dread
the sight of a letter from me, as it seems to lay
claim to the compliment of an answer. I will there∣fore
write you one that shall wave its privilege, at
least till such time as your leisure encourages, or
your present dissipation does not forbid, you to send
one.—I dare now no longer expatiate upon the af∣fair
you have in hand; it is enough for me if you
will excuse the freedom I <HI>have</HI> taken. I have often
known <HI>delay</HI> produce good effects in some cases which
even sagacity itself could not surmount; and, if
I thought I did not go too far, would presume to
recommend it now. You know I have very little
of the temper of an alderman. I almost hate the
<HI>idea</HI> of wealthiness as much as the <HI>word.</HI> It seems
to me to carry a notion of fulness, stagnation, and
insignificancy. It is this disposition of mine that
can <HI>alone</HI> give any weight to the advice I send you,
as it proves me not to give it through any partiality
to fortune. As to what remains, you are, I hope,
assured of the value I must ever have for you in <HI>any</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="129"/>
circumstances, and the regard I shall always shew
for any that belongs to you. I cannot like you <HI>less</HI>
or <HI>more.</HI>—I now drop into other matters. Bergen,
I see, is taken at last; pray what are the sentiments
of your political companions? I dined some time
ago with Mr. Lyttelton and Mr. Pitt, who both
agreed it was worth twenty thousand men to the
French; which is a light in which I never used to
consider it. Any little intimation that you please to
<HI>confer</HI> upon me, enables me to seem <HI>wise</HI> in this
country for a month; particularly if I take care to
adjust my face accordingly.—As I was returning last
Sunday from church, whom mould I meet in my
way, but that <HI>sweet-souled</HI> bard Mr. James Thomson,
in a chaise drawn by two horses lengthways.—
I welcomed him into the country, and asked him
to accompany Mr. Lyttelton to The Leasowes (who
had offered me a visit), which he promised to do.
So I am in daily expectations of them and all the
world this week. I fancy they will lavish all their
praises upon <HI>nature,</HI> reserving none for poor <HI>art</HI> and
<HI>me.</HI> But if I ever live, and am able to perfect my
schemes, I shall not despair of pleasing the few I
first began with, <HI>the few friends prejudiced in my fa∣vour;</HI>
and then “Fico por los malignatores.” Cen∣sures
will not affect me; for I am armed so strong
in <HI>vanity,</HI> that they will pass by me as the idle wind
which I regard not.—I think it pretty near equal,
in a country place, whether you gain the small num∣ber
<PB N="120" REF="130"/>
of tasters, or the <HI>large crowd</HI> of the vulgar. The
latter are more frequently met with, and <HI>gape,</HI> stu∣pent.
and <HI>stare</HI> much more. But one would chuse
to please a few <HI>friends</HI> of taste before mob or gentry,
the great vulgar or the small; because therein one
gratifies both one's social passssions and one's pride,
that is, one's <HI>self</HI>-love. Above all things, I would
wish to please <HI>you;</HI> and if I have a wish that pro∣jects
or is prominent beyond the rest, it is to see
you placed to your satisfaction near me; but For∣tune
must vary from her usual treatment before she
favours me so far.—And yet there <HI>was</HI> a time, when
one might probably have prevailed on her. I knew
not what to do.—The affair was so intricately cir∣cumstanced—
your surprizing silence after the hint
I gave.—Mr. D—offering to serve any friend of
mine; nay, pressing me to use the opportunity.—
His other relations, his guardians, teizing him with
sure symptoms of a rupture in case of a refusal on
<HI>their</HI> side.—Mr. P—soliciting me if the place were
<HI>sold,</HI> which it could not legally be. Friendship, pro∣priety,
impartiality, self-interest (which I <HI>little</HI> regard∣ed),
endeavouring to distract me; I think I never
spent so disagreeable an half-year since I was born.
To close the whole, I could not <HI>foresee</HI> the event,
which is almost foretold in your last letter, and I
knew I could not serve you; but I must render it a
<HI>necessary</HI> one. In short, when I can tell you the
whole affair at leisure, you will own it to be of such
<PB N="122" REF="131"/>
a nature, that I must be ever in suspence concerning
my behaviour, and of course shall never reflect on it
with pleasure. Believe me, with the truest affection,</P>

<HEAD>XLVI. To a Friend, from The Leasowes.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
1747.</OPENER>
<P>IT is not much above two hours since I received
your obliging letter, and I am already set down
to answer it.—To speak the truth, I had almost gi∣ven
you over: I imagined you had taken umbrage
at some expression or circumstance in my epistle, and
were determined to make me sensible you did so by
your silence. I hope, this error of mine will serve to
establish one rule on <HI>both</HI> sides.—It is what ought, I
am sure, always to take place, where people wish a
perpetuity of friendship. I mean, never, upon cir∣cumstances of disrespect, to admit of circumstantial
evidence.</P>
<P>I AM very grave, so you may depend on the since∣rity
of all I shall say. I saw several beauties in your
former elegy; but, though it was “formosa,” it did
not appear to me “ipsa forma.” I like this that you
<PB N="123" REF="132"/>
have now sent <HI>very</HI> much. It has a Simplicity which
your last a little wanted, and has thought <HI>enough.</HI> I
begin to be seldom pleased with the compositions of
others, or my own; but I could be really <HI>fond</HI> of this,
with a few alterations that I could propose:—but you
must know, at the same time, that these are such as no
one would approve beside myself.—I know it.—How∣ever,
there are some seeming <HI>faults</HI> in it.</P>
<P>I HAVE been greatly mortified in my correspondents
of late.—I even said in my haste, All friends are faith∣less.
—G—, after a month's expectation, which he
had confirmed to me, of seeing him here, let me
know about a fortnight since, that I had more leisure
than him; and, since it did not suit his convenience
to come, I ought to take the opportunity of visiting
him, and seeing Derbyshire while he continues in it.—
W—has not wrote to me these six weeks.—Outing
has been, moreover, dumb for the same space of
time; and I purpose in my heart to behave with some
distance towards both, for this neglect (see my rule of
circumstantial evidence).</P>
<P>IT is pity you cannot spare a day or two to come
and see me. My wood grows excessively pleasant,
and its pleasantness vexes me; because nobody will
come that can taste it.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="133"/>
YOUR health, according to your description, is
much the same with mine; but, from the gaiety of
your style and <HI>designs,</HI> I collect that it is greatly bet∣ter.</P>
<P>I HAVE an alcove, six elegies, a seat, two epitaphs
(one upon myself), three ballads, four songs, and a
serpentine river, to shew you when you come. Will
the compositions come safe to you, if I send my book,
which contains the <HI>only</HI> copies of several things (which
I could not remember if they were lost)?—but I will
not send them. If my horse gets well, I may essay a
visit for two days, and bring them with me, that I
may make comments while you read them, as beseem∣eth
a genuine author to do.</P>
<P>I AM railing a green-house from the excrescences
of Lord Dudley's; but I do not find that “vient l'ap∣petit
en mangeant,” that I grow fonder of my col∣lection
proportionably as it increases.</P>
<P>I SHOULD think myself fortunate enough at pre∣sent,
if, like you, I could only find that I had been
mentioned for a vacant post; but I have withdrawn all
my views from court-preferment, and fixed them on
finding a pot of money, which I determine to be the
far more probable scheme.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="134"/>
I HAVE little health and frequent mortification, so
that no one need envy me; and yet, I believe, there
<HI>are</HI> that do. Is any enviable but such as are unam∣bitious?
I never shall be able to reckon myself of
that
tribe, which have engrossed all <HI>happiness</HI> to themselves,
and left the rest of the world nothing but hopes and
possessions. Yet I do no much feel the pains of am∣bition
while I am conversing with ingenious friends
of my own level: but in <HI>other</HI> company it hurts me.
Let me advise you, now I think of it, to dread the
company of silly people, out-of-the-way people, and,
in one word, what men of genius call <HI>the vulgar.</HI>
You run ten times the risque of being mortified, vo∣luntarily
or unkowingly, amongst the latter of these,
to what you do amongst men of sense and politeness,
be they ever so malicious;—but my paper is filled.</P>

<P>I THINK I have lived to out-correspond almost
all my correspondents; whether you are the last
that is to be. subdued, I will not say; the rest
are so
<PB N="126" REF="135"/>
fatigued, that they are not able to atchieve a line.
Apprized of this, and being by nature disposed to
have mercy on the vanquished, “parcere subjectis,”
I seldom write a syllable more than is requisite to
further some scheme, or ascertain some interview,
the latter of these being the purpose of <HI>this</HI> mine
epistle. I am in great hopes I shall be at liberty
to see you ere many weeks be past; and would beg
of you, in the mean time, to inform me, by a let∣ter,
when I am likely, or when very <HI>unlikely,</HI> to meet
with you at home. I am detained, just at present,
by continual expectations of the Hagley family.</P>
<P>As I was returning from church on Sunday last,
whom should I meet, in a chaise, with two horses
length-ways, but that right friendly bard, Mr.
Thomson? I complimented him upon his arrival in
this country, and asked him to accompany Mr. Lyt∣telton
to The Leasowes, which he said he would with
abundance of pleasure; and so we parted. Yon will
observe, that the more stress I lay upon this visit,
and the more I <HI>discover</HI> to you, the more substantial
is my apology for deferring mine into Warwickshire.
I own, I am pleased with the prospect of shewing
them something at The Leasowes beyond what they

I shewed you, made some considerable improvements
in Virgil's grove, and finished a walk from it to
the house, after a manner which you will approve.

They are going to build a castle in the park round
the lodge, which, if well executed, must have a good
effect; and they are going likewise to build a ro∣tund
to terminate the visto. The fault is, that they
anticipate every thing which I propose to do when
I become <HI>rich;</HI> but as that is never likely to be,
perhaps it is not of any importance;—but what I
term <HI>rich,</HI> implies no great deal; I believe you are
a witness to the moderation of my desires; and I
flatter myself that you will believe your friend in
<HI>that</HI> respect something above the vulgar:

<P>IF I come to your house, positively I will not go
to see Mr. M—. He has been twice as near me as
The Grange, with C—L—, and never deemed
my place worth seeing. I doubt, you are a little
too modest in praising it wherever you go.—Why
don't you applaud it with both hands, “utroque
pollice?”.—“Parcentes ego dexteras odi, sparge
rosas”—I am so very <HI>partial</HI> to my native place,
that it seems a miracle to me that it is not more fa∣mous.
But I complain unjustly of you; for, as you
have always contributed to my happiness, you have
taken every opportunity to contribute to my figure.
<PB N="128" REF="137"/>
I wish I could say the same of some who have it
<HI>more</HI> in their <HI>power.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE yet about a thousand things to say to
you—not now, though.—Lady L—h's visit I reserve
till I see you. A coach with a coronet is a pretty
kind of phaenomenon at my door—few prettier, ex∣cept
the face of such a friend as you; for I do not
want the grace to prefer a generous and spirited
friendship to all the gewgaws that ambition can <HI>con∣trive.</HI>
I have wrote out my elegies, and heartily
wish you had them to look over before I come.—
I know not how to send them.—I shall bring and
leave some poetry with you.—“Thus &amp; odores!”
or rather a proper covering for “Thus &amp; odores, &amp;

<P>BEING just returned from a small excursion, it
was with the utmost pleasure that I read over
your letter; and, though it abounds both in wit
<PB N="129" REF="138"/>
and waggery, I sit down incontinently to answer it
with <HI>none.</HI></P>
<P>THE agreeableness of your letters is now heighten∣ed
by the surprize they give me. I must own, I
have thought you in a manner lost to the amuse∣ments
in which you once delighted, correspondences,
works of taste and fancy, &amp;c. If you think the
opinion worth removing, you need only favour me
with such a letter now and then, and I will place
you (in my imagination) where you shall see all
the favourites of fortune cringing at your feet.</P>
<P>I THINK I could add about half a dozen hints to
your observations on electricity, which might at
<HI>least</HI> disguise the facts; and then why will you not
put it into some news-paper, or monthly pamphlet?
you might discover yourself to whom you have a
mind. It would give more than ordinary pleasure
at this time.—Some other will take the hint.—Pity
your piece should not have the advantage of novelty
as well as of wit!</P>
<P>I DINED and stayed a night with Dr. E—; he
was extremely obliging, and I am glad of such a
friend to visit at B. He asked much after you.—
He shewed me his Ovid—I advised him to finish
some one epistle <HI>highly,</HI> that he might shew it.—

The whole will <HI>not take,</HI> though it goes against me

conscience; for I take him to excel the rest of B.

<HEAD>XLIX. To the same, after a Visit.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
<DATE>Sunday,
Feb. 14, 1747-8.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM tempted once more to apologize for the un∣seasonable
visit I paid you, though I feel myself
entirely innocent in that respect, even as much so as
the post-boy was guilty; for had my previous letter
arrived in due time, you had then been furnished
with an opportunity of waving my company till a
more convenient season. I was <HI>only,</HI> or, at least,
<HI>chiefly</HI> uneasy upon <HI>your</HI> account. I spent my time
very agreeably, and only less so than I might, had
I not been conscious to myself that I was intruding
upon domestic tendernesses.</P>
<P>I SPENT the Sunday night and the next day at
Mr. Wren's; and am now just returned from Mr.
Dolman's, who has made me a genteel present of
Spence's Polymetis. I have not yet <HI>read</HI> many dia∣logues
in it, but I have <HI>dipped</HI> in several; and have
reason to be well enough satisfied with the simple
and uninvidious manner in which he has introduced
Mr. Lowth's poem. I have long known of this
intended <HI>introduction</HI> (which I accidentally found to
have been settled betwixt them before I published
<HI>mine</HI> on the same subject), and a little dreaded the
<HI>form</HI> of it. I have long ago made considerable im∣provements
<PB N="133" REF="142"/>
in mine, and have a mind one day to
publish it once more; after which, let it sleep in
peace. I have sometimes thought of printing my
next title-page thus, viz. “Poems; consisting of
Songs, Odes, and Elegies; with an improved edi∣tion
of The Judgement of Hercules, and of The
School-mistress.” But I have but very few critical
acquaintance, and I live at a great distance from
those I have; stationed amongst the <HI>makers</HI> and the
<HI>wearers</HI> of hobnails;
<Q><L>“Far from the joys that with my soul agree,</L>
<L>From <HI>wit,</HI> from <HI>learning</HI>—very far from thee.”</L></Q></P>

</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>I know I have thrown a great number of careless
things into your hands. I know to <HI>whom</HI> I in∣trusted
my follies; but I know <HI>not</HI> what they <HI>are:</HI>—
I believe, in general, that they consist of mis-begot∣ten
embryos and abortive births, which it had been
merely decent to have buried in—some part of my
garden;—but I was morally assured that you would
expose nothing of mine to my disadvantage. As
to some that are <HI>less imperfect,</HI> you promised your ob∣servations,
and I desire you would make them with
the utmost freedom. I can bear any censure which
you shall pass by way of letter, and I beg once more
that you would not be sparing. It will be esteemed
as great a favour as you can do me. When they
have gone, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough your hands, and those of one
<PB N="134" REF="143"/>
or two more friends, I shall, perhaps, think of pub∣lishing
them; though as to that, much depends
upon the advice I receive, and previously on the op∣portunity
I have of receiving it. I am in hopes that
you will be pretty full in discovering to me, <HI>which
you dislike the least, what faults you find,</HI> and <HI>what
improvements they are capable of.</HI> I set you a tedious
task; but I will return the favour as far as I am able,
either in <HI>the same way</HI> or any other. This brings
me to say, that, if there be any compositions of
yours that you would have me correct (and there
are several of which I want a copy), I would beg
you to send them. Your Blackbird excels any
singing-bird I ever heard; and I beseech you to
convey it to The Leasowes by the next opportunity,
that he may acquire fame near other rills, and in
other valleys, than those in which he was produced.</P>
<P>I HAVE many compliments to make in your country;
to Mr. H—, Mrs. N—, Mrs. J—, Mr. F—, Mr.
T—, and your brother. If I go over to Mr. W—'s,
I will assuredly call and spend a night with you.—
<HI>That</HI> is precarious.—But whether I do or not, I
would willingly hope to see you this spring and sum∣mer
more than once; as a <HI>critic</HI> and as a <HI>friend:</HI>
nor do I forget the promise of Mr. H—and Mr. F—;
—but of these things more when I send for the pa∣pers,
which I purpose to do to-morrow fortnight,
that is, the twenty-ninth of February.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="144"/>
I HAVE suffered greatly by raising at the black
button on a parson's great coat. Had Mr. Hall's
been thus distinguished, he could not have mistaken
mine for his own; which latter I sent in order to
be commuted at Birmingham, and was almost starved
to death before I could accomplish the exchange.
There is no trifling with any <HI>part</HI> of orthodoxy with
impunity.—That is the moral.</P>
<P>I HAVE received a very obliging letter from Lady
Luxborough, wherein she tells me that Lady Hart∣ford
admires my place in her description. Mr.
Thomson is intimate at Lady Hartford's; and I sup∣pose
Lady Hartford may have been informed by
Lady L. that Mr. Thomson has been here; so I con∣clude,
in mere vanity, that my farm is advancing in
reputation.</P>
<P>WHAT think you of Mr. Carte's History? or what
of his narrative concerning the Pretender's touching
for the King's evil! I think one is not, however,
to give up his book entirely; because, with <HI>all his
superstition,</HI> he may have several anecdotes that one
would like to read.</P>
<P>I HAVE had great expectations from the beautiful
veins of a piece of oak of which I have had a table
made; but, upon a thorough survey of it, it is so
<PB N="136" REF="145"/>
like nothing in the world as old B—'s callimanco
night-gown.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing to add worth beginning upon
another page; but I happened not to make a regular
conclusion in my preceding one.</P>
<P>YOU must give me some time to colour you a
collection of flowers (that octavo edition I shewed
you here); and then I will make Mrs. Jago a pre∣sent
of it. I believe I can engage Mr. Dolman to
assist me, who is much my superior in point of ac∣curacy;
and the inscription at the beginning is to
run somehow thus:
<Q><L>“ELEGANTISSIMAE PVELLAE</L>

<L>GVLIELMVS SHENSTONE;</L>

That is, by trade a garland-maker; but this in∣scription
I may alter, if I can think of any thing
more expressive of the regard which I have ever born
and still bear you.</P>

<P>I HAVE sent Tom over for the papers which I
left under your inspection: having nothing to
add upon this head, but that the more <HI>freely</HI> and <HI>par∣ticularly</HI>
you give me your opinion, the greater will
be the obligation which I shall have to acknow∣ledge.</P>
<P>I SHALL be very glad, if I happen to receive a
good large bundle of your own compositions; in
regard to which, I will observe any commands which
you shall please to lay upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="147"/>
I AM favoured with a certain correspondence, by
way of letter, which I told you I should be glad
to cultivate; and I find it very entertaining.</P>
<P>PRAY did you receive my answer to your last let∣ter,
sent by way of London? I should be extremely
sorry to be debarred the pleasure of writing to you
by the post, as often as I feel a violent propensity
to describe the notable incidents of my life; which
amount to about as much as the tinsel of your little
boy's hobby-horse.</P>
<P>I AM on the point of purchasing a couple of busts
for the niches in my hall; and believe me, my good
friend, I never proceed one step in ornamenting my
little farm, but I enjoy the hopes of rendering it
more agreeable to you, and the small circle of ac∣quaintance
which sometimes favour me with their
company.</P>
<P>I SHALL be extremely glad to see you and Mr.
Fancourt when the trees are green; that is, in May;
but I would not have you content yourself with a
single visit this summer. If Mr. Hardy (to whom
you will make my compliments) inclines to favour
me so far, you must calculate so as to wait on him
whenever he finds it convenient; though I have
<HI>better <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pes</HI> of making his reception here agreeable
<PB N="139" REF="148"/>
to him when my Lord Dudley comes down.—I won∣der
how he would like the scheme I am upon, of
exchanging a large tankard for a silver standish.</P>
<P>I HAVE had a couple of paintings given me since
you were here. One of them is a Madona, valued,
as it is said, at ten guineas in Italy, but which you
would hardly purchase at the price of five shillings.
However, I am endeavouring to make it out to be
one of Carlo Maratt's, who was a first hand, and
famous for Madonas; even so as to be nick-named
“Cartuccio delle Madonne” by Salvator Rosa. Two
letters of the cypher (CM) agree; what shall I do
with regard to the third? It is a small piece, and
sadly blackened. It is about the size (though not
quite the shape) of the Bacchus over the parlour door,
and has much such a frame.</P>
<P>A PERSON may amuse himself almost as cheaply
as he pleases. I find no small delight in rearing
all sorts of poultry; geese, turkeys, pullets, ducks,
&amp;c. I am also somewhat smitten with a blackbird
which I have purchased: a very fine one; brother
by father, but not by mother, to the unfortunate
bird you so beautifully describe, a copy of which
description you must not fail to send me;—but, as
I said before, one may easily habituate one's self to
cheap amusements; that is, <HI>rural</HI> ones (for all town
amusements are horridly expensive);—I would have
<PB N="140" REF="149"/>
you cultivate your garden; plant flowers, have a
bird or two in the hall (they will at <HI>least</HI> amuse your

<HI>will:</HI> building my opinion on the knowledge I have
long had of your own temper, and the account you

<P>I SHALL always be glad to find you <HI>praesentibus

this kind of advice may seem extremely dogmatical

of pursuing the way to the fine lawns and
venerable oaks which distinguish the region of it,

I am got into the pitiful parterre-garden of amuse∣ment,
and view the nobler scenes at a <HI>distance.</HI> I
think I can see the <HI>road</HI> too that <HI>leads</HI> the better way,
and can shew it others; but I have many miles to
measure back before I can get into it myself, and
no kind of resolution to take a single step. My
chief amusements at present are the same they have
long been, and lie scattered about my farm. The
French have what they call a <HI>parque ornée;</HI> I sup∣pose,
approaching about as near to a garden as the
park at Hagley. I give my place the title of a
<HI>ferme ornée;</HI> though, if I had money, I should hardly
confine myself to such decorations as that name re∣quires.
I have made great improvements; and the
<HI>consequence</HI> is, that I long to have you see them.</P>
<P>I HAVE not heard whether Miss—'s match pro∣ceeded.—
I suppose your objections were grounded on
the person's <HI>age</HI> and <HI>temper;</HI> and that they had the
less weight, as they supposed you acted indiscreetly
yourself: I can say but little on the occasion. You
know—better than I do. Only this I must add,
that I have so great an esteem for your sister, that
it will be necessary to my <HI>ease,</HI> that whoever marries
her she should be happy.</P>
<P>I HAVE little hopes that I shall now you see often
in this country; though it would be <HI>you,</HI> in all pro∣bability,

as soon as <HI>any,</HI> that would take a journey
of fifty miles,
<Q>“To see the <HI>poorest</HI> of the sons of men.”</Q>
The truth is, my affairs are miserably embroiled,
by my own negligence, and the non-payment of tenants.
I believe, I shall be forced to seize on one next
week for three years and a half's rent, due last
Lady-day; an affair to which I am greatly averse,
both through <HI>indolence</HI> and <HI>compassion.</HI> I hope, how∣ever,

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,

<P>I HARDLY know whether it will be prudent in
me to own, that I wrote you a <HI>long letter</HI> upon
the receipt of your last, which I now have upon
my table. I condemn this habit in <HI>myself</HI> entirely,
and should, I am sure, be very unhappy, if my
friends, by my example, should be induced to con∣tract
the same. The truth is, I had not expressed
myself in it to my mind, and it was full of blots,
and blunders, and interlinings; yet, such as it was,
it had wearied my attention, and given me a disin∣clination
to begin it afresh. I am now impatient
to remove any scruple you may have concerning my
grateful sense of all your favours, and the invariable
continuance of my affection and esteem.—I find by
your last obliging letter, that my machinations and
devices are not entirely private.—You knew of my
draught of Hagley Castle about the bigness of a
barley-corn; you knew of our intended visit to
<PB N="145" REF="154"/>
Lady Luxborough's; and I must add, Mr. Thomas
Hall knew of my contrivance for the embellishment
of Mr. Hardy's house. Nothing is there hid that
shall not be revealed.—Our visit to Barrels is now
Over and past.—Lady Luxborough has seen Hagley
Castle in the original:—and as to my desire that
my draught might be shewn to no <HI>Christian</HI> soul,
you surely did but ill comply with it, when you
shewed that <HI>drawing</HI> to a <HI>Clergyman.</HI> However, you
may have acted up to my <HI>real</HI> meaning, if you
have taken care not to shew it to any connoisseu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
I meant chiefly to guard against any one that knows
the rules, in whose eyes, I am sure, it could not
turn to my credit.—Pray how do you like the
festoons dangling over the oval windows?—It is the
chief advantage in repairing an old house, that one
may deviate from the rules without any extraordinary
censure.</P>
<P>I WILL not trouble you <HI>now</HI> with many particu∣lars.
The intent of Tom's coming is, to desire your
company and Mrs. Jago's this week.—I should be
extremely glad if your convenience would allow you
to come on Monday or Tuesday; but, if it is <HI>entirely</HI>
impracticable, I would beseech you not to put <HI>off</HI>
the visit longer than the Monday following, for the
leaves of my groves begin to fall a great pace.—
I beg once more, you would let no small incon∣venience
prevent your being here on Monday.—As

to my visit at Icheneton, you may depend upon
it soon after; and I hope you will not stand upon
punctilio, when I mention my inclination that you
may all take a walk through my coppices before
their beauty is much impaired. Were I in a sprightly
vein, I would aim at saying something genteel by
way of <HI>answer</HI> to Mrs. Jago's compliment.—As it
is, I can only thank her for the <HI>substance,</HI> and applaud
the <HI>politeness</HI> of it.—I postpone all other matters till

<P>I BEG my compliments to Mr. Hardy.</P>
<P>P. S. I AM not accustomed, my dear friend, to
send you a <HI>blank</HI> page; nor can I be content to do
so now.</P>
<P>I THANK you very <HI>sensibly</HI> for the verses with
which you honour me. I think them good lines,
and so do others that have seen them; but you will
give me leave, when I see you, to propose some lit∣tle
alteration. As to an epistle, it would be exe∣cuted
with <HI>difficulty,</HI> and I would have it turn to
your credit as well as my own. But you have cer∣tainly
of late acquired an <HI>ease</HI> in writing; and I
am tempted to think, that what you write hence∣forth
<PB N="147" REF="156"/>
will be universally good. Persons that have
seen your; elegies like “The, Blackbirds” best, as it
is most-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most <HI>correct;</HI> but I, who pre∣tend
to great penetration can foresee that. “The
Linnets” <HI>will</HI> be made to excel.—More of this
when I see you. Poor Miss G—, J—R—says,
is married; and poor Mr. Thomson, Mr. Pitt tells
me, is <HI>dead.</HI>—He Was to have been at Hagley this
week, and then I should probably have seen him
<HI>here.</HI>—As it is, I will erect an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn in Virgil's Grove
to his memory.—I was really as much shocked to
hear of his death, as if had known and loved him
for a number of years:—God knows, I lean on a
very few friends; and if they drop me, I become a
wretched misanthrope.</P>
<DIV2 N="53">
<HEAD>LIII. To the same.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
Sunday night,
<DATE>Sept, 11, 1748.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE this opportunity of acknowledging the
justice of your excuses. Mrs. Jago's present cir∣cumstances
render her visit quite impracticable, and
yours I have the same kind of reason to dispense
with; as I guess, that she could as soon take a
journey <HI>herself</HI> at this time, as bear that <HI>you</HI> should.—
But to say I was not greatly mortified, would be
<PB N="148" REF="157"/>
doing myself the greatest injustice. <HI>Disappointed</HI> I
was, you may be sure, to hear excuses; even as
much as Sir John Falstaff, when Mr. Dombledon
put him in mind of <HI>security,</HI> instead of sending him
<HI>two</HI> and <HI>thirty yards</HI> of sattin to make him a <HI>short</HI>
cloak. And on the whole, I began to accuse you
and Mrs. Jago of <HI>colloguing</HI> together, to fix your
visit at a time when you were well assured you should
have an <HI>apology</HI> to send me instead. Now, if I should
press this accusation, pray how would you evade
the force of it?—The next thing I am to speak to,
is your verses. I have made you my acknowledg∣ments
<HI>before;</HI> and as you are so good as to accept
them, I will not trouble you with additional pro∣fessions,
or repetitions of the past. I will depend
upon your good-sense for an excuse, if I only add
what I think proper as to any <HI>alteration;</HI> wherein
I have a view to <HI>your</HI> credit, as well as my <HI>own.</HI> I
confess, it requires some nicety to inscribe such an
elegy as “The Gold-finches” without the danger you
foresaw. But I think it <HI>may</HI> be done (and <HI>is</HI> pretty
nearly) in such manner that no man of <HI>taste</HI> will be
tempted to ridicule it; and as for the vulgar, of
whatever <HI>rank</HI> they be, it is absolutely necessary
many times to <HI>give them up. Taste</HI> and <HI>tenderness</HI> are
absolutely connected; and you may very readily call
to mind some charming things, that must excite the
laughter of your men of <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>banter,</HI> but are
by no means thought the worse of by men of <HI>true
<PB N="149" REF="158"/>
genius.</HI> I will only mention Andrew Marvel's <HI>Fawn</HI>
in Dryden's Miscellanies. I inclose the elegy with
some few proposed alterations, so I will not risque
the <HI>filing</HI> my <HI>letter</HI> with criticism. I also inclose
the other verses you sent me, which I think good
ones, and to stand in need of little alteration, be∣side
that of the inglorious name at the head of them;
to which, not withstanding, I will never submit. Pray
who is the young gentleman that translates your
elegy into Latin?—The new dress will give you
some amusement; and, if these lines <HI>be</HI> the product
of the genius of a boy of that age, he will in a year's
time be able to extend the same of your composi∣tions.
I shall then be glad to see “The Gold-finches”
under his hand; though I have no extraordinary
fondness for the Latin poetry of a modern; at least,
till your eldest son begins to translate our madri∣gals.</P>
<P>I HAVE not yet seen Mr. Thomson's “Castle of
Indolence.”—I waited for a smaller edition; but am
now too impatient not to send for it on Thursday
next.—I am fully bent on raising a neat urn to him
in my lower grove, if Mr. Lyttelton does not in∣scribe
one at Hagley <HI>before</HI> me. But I should be ex∣tremely
glad of your advice whereabouts to place
it.—You speak of my dwelling in the Castle of In∣dolence,
and I verily believe I <HI>do.</HI> There is something
like enchantment in my present inactivity; for, without
<PB N="150" REF="159"/>
any kind of lett or impediment to the correction of
my trifles that I see, I am in no wise able to make
the least advances. I think within myself I could
proceed if you were here; and yet I have reason to
believe, if you were here, we should only ramble
round the groves, and chat away the time; and
perhaps <HI>that,</HI> upon the <HI>whole,</HI> is of full as much
importance.—I do not know but I do myself some
little injustice here, for I <HI>have</HI> wrote out my <HI>levitics</HI>
and my <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> good and bad, with many ornaments
from the pencil; and the next thing I do will be to
transcribe my elegies. The fault is, I take no pains
to <HI>improve</HI> what I transcribe, and consequently am
only able to exhibit my nonsense in a fairer dress.—
You must give me leave, ere it be long, to insert
two or three lines (I think in <HI>verse)</HI> before Mrs.
Jago's flower-piece.—I am sure, I am obliged to her
for a fruit I greatly love—it was not entirely ripe;
but it was the only one I have tasted since I was last
in London.—Yesterday dined here Lady Luxborough,
Mr. Outing and Mr. Hall Lord, Dudley, Miss Lea,
Counsellor <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Mr. Saunders, Mr. Perry
Mrs. Perry and Miss Dolman, and half a dozen foot∣men,
beside my own servants and labourers; so you
may guess we had no small fracas. I now sit down
amid solitude and silence, and can hear little else be∣side
the pendulum of my clock;—yet my spirits are
no way sunk, but afford me just such a temperature
of mind as inclines me to write to some familiar
<PB N="151" REF="160"/>
friend: albeit I have a thousand things to <HI>talk</HI> of
to you, which I do not care to <HI>write.</HI> I hope to be
able to spend a few days with Mr. Hardy, before
his melons are all gone; and yet I would not have
him keep one a <HI>moment</HI> longer upon <HI>my</HI> account.
I desire he would accept of my compliments, as I
trust he will.—Franks at present run low with me;
but I send you <HI>one,</HI> which you cannot use so soon
but I shall be able to send you others immediately.
I wish I could send you any thing more than the
means of obliging,</P>

Sunday, <DATE>Nov. 13.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST fairly own, that I have not sate down
till now to return my acknowledgments for your
last most obliging favour; and yet I have been doing
so in <HI>imagination</HI> almost every day since I received
it. I have only to desire that you would not think
me <HI>stupid;</HI> and then you must of course conclude
me hightly delighted, to find the verses which had
<PB N="152" REF="161"/>
so greatly pleased me, made so <HI>particularly interesting</HI>
to me. In testimony hereof, I have caused these
my letters to be made <HI>patent,</HI> &amp;c. Furthermore, I
am glad to fee you disstent from some alterations I
proposed; for which, generally speaking, I think I
can see your reasons. As to any little matter which
I have to mention farther, I chuse to defer it till
I wait on Mr. Hardy; which I purpose to do be∣fore
this month is out. It may possibly <HI>happen</HI> the
beginning of the next week; but I dare not lay
such stress upon a future <HI>event,</HI> as to give you a
commission to say so much to <HI>him.</HI> Instead thereof,
please to make him my compliments, and tell him
I talk of coming <HI>very soon.</HI></P>
<P>I BORROWED Dodsley's Miscellany of Lady Lux∣borough,
in which are many good things. I long
to be making a mark on the head of <HI>every</HI> copy
(as I would do were the books my <HI>own).</HI> Here a
cypher; there an asterism of five points, and there
one of eight.—If you, and Mr. W—, and Mr. G—,
and I, were together for a fortnight, to correct and
revise, might not we make a miscellany of <HI>originals</HI>
that would sell?—My fingers itch to be at it;—
but I fear it cannot be.—Thomson's poem amused
me greatly.—I think his plan has faults; particular∣ly,
that he should have said nothing of the diseases
attending laziness in his <HI>first</HI> canto, but reserved them
to strike us <HI>more affectingly</HI> in the last; but, on the
<PB N="153" REF="162"/>
whole, who would have thought that Thomson
could have so well imitated a person remarkable for
simplicity both of sentiment and phrase?</P>
<P>I STUDY no connections in a letter; and so I pro∣ceed
to tell you, that I have got a machine to ex∣hibit
landscapes, &amp;c. to advantage. It costs about
fourteen shillings, and I recommend one to you or
Mr. Hardy.—Smith's Views (with a little colouring)
appear ravishingly;—but if you are not content
with <HI>amusement,</HI> and want <HI>fame</HI> (which differs about
as much as <HI>fox</HI>-hunting from <HI>hare</HI>-hunting), you must
<HI>print.</HI>—However, if you can acquiesce in a <HI>limited
reputation,</HI> to give you a proper weight at all your
visiting-places (which I think enough for all reasona∣ble
ends and purposes), take the following receipt.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>“A Receipt to make FAME.</HEAD>
<P>“TAKE a shoe-maker into your parlour (that is re∣puted
a good workman), and bid him procure a
piece of red or blue Morocco leather; let him shape
this into the size of a quarter of a sheet of paper, or
it may be something larger. Let him double it in
such a manner as to leave some part to wrap over;
then stitch it neatly at the ends, lining it either
with silk or the best yellow leather he can meet
with. Then must you bespeak a silver clasp,
which you <HI>may</HI> have gilded; but be sure it be
neatly <HI>chased,</HI> and properly annexed to the afore∣said
<PB N="154" REF="163"/>
Morocco leather. Make a present of this
to the prettiest girl you know, but filled with half
a dozen of your best compositions; take care that
one be in praise of <HI>her</HI> ingenuity. For modesty's
sake, desire not to shew them to any living
soul; but, at the same time, be careful that your
clasp be splendid, and your letter-case made ac∣cording
to the foregoing directions.”</P>

<HEAD>LV. To a Friend, disappointing him of a Visit.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>June, 1749.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>FIE on Mr. N—! he has disappointed me of
the most seasonable visit that heart could wish
or desire.—My flowers in blossom, my walks newly
cleaned, my neighbours invited, and I languishing
for lack of your company! Mean time you are going
to dance attendance on a courtier.—Would to God!
he may disappoint <HI>you,</HI> according to the usual practice
of those gentlemen;—I mean, by giving you a far
better living than you ever expected.</P>
<P>I HAVE no sooner <HI>made</HI> than I am ready to <HI>re∣call</HI>
that wish, in order to substitute another in its
<PB N="155" REF="164"/>
place; which is, that you may rather squat your∣self
down upon a fat-goose living in Warwickshire,
or one in Staffordshire, or perhaps Worcestershire,
of the <HI>same denomination.</HI> I do not mention Shrop∣shire,
because I think I am more remote from the
main body of that county than I am from either
of the others. But, nevertheless, by all means wait
on Mr. N—; shew him all respect, yet so as not
to lay out any of the profits of your <HI>contingent</HI> living
in a black velvet waistcoat and breeches to appear
before him. True merit needeth nought of this.
Besides, peradventure, you may not receive the first
quarter's income of it this half year. He will pro∣bably
do something for you one time or other; but
you shall never go into Ireland, that is certain, for
less than a deanry; not for less than the deanry of
St. Patrick's, if you take my advice. Lower your
hopes only to advance your surprize; “<HI>grata</HI> super∣venient
quae non sperabimus.” Come to me <HI>as you
may.</HI> A week is elapsed since you <HI>began</HI> to be de∣tained;
you may surely come over in a fortnight
now at farthest;—I will be at home.—However,
write directly; you know our letters are long upon
their journey.—I expected you the beginning of
every week, till I received your last letter, <HI>impa∣tiently.</HI></P>
<P>FOR my part, I begin to wean myself from all
hopes and expectations whatever.—I feed my wild∣ducks,
<PB N="156" REF="165"/>
and I water my carnations! Happy enough,
If I could extinguish my ambition <HI>quite,</HI> or <HI>indulge</HI>
(what I hope I feel in an equal degree) the desire of
being something more beneficial in my sphere.—
Perhaps some few other circumstances would want
also to be adjusted.</P>
<P>I HAVE just read Lord Bolingbroke's three letters,
which I like as much as most pieces of politics I
ever read. I admire, especially, the spirit of the
style. I as much admire <HI>at</HI> the editor's unpopular
preface.—I know the family hitherto <HI>seemed</HI> to make
it a point to conceal Pope's affair; and now, the
editor, under Lord B's inspection, not only relates,
but invites people to think the worst of it.—What
<HI>cellateral</HI> reasons my Lord may have for thinking ill
of Mr. Pope, I cannot say; but surely it is not <HI>po∣litical</HI>
to lessen a person's character that had done one
so much honour.</P>

to a young clergyman of taste and in∣genuity.
His name is Pixell; he plays <HI>finely</HI> upon
the violin, and very well upon the harpsichord: has
set many things to music, some in the <HI>soft way,</HI> with
which I was much delighted. He is young, and has

time to improve himself. He gave me an oppor∣tunity
of being acquainted with him by frequently
visiting, and introducing company to, my walks.—
I met him one morning with an Italian in my
grove, and our acquaintance has been growing ever
since.—He has a share in an estate that is near me,
and lives there at present; but I doubt will not do
so long.;—when you come, I will send for him.—
Have you read my Lord Bolingbroke's Essays on
Patriotism, &amp;c.? and have you read Merope? and
do you take in the <HI>Magazin des Londres?</HI> and pray
how does your garden flourish? I warrant, you do
not yet know the difference betwixt a ranunculus
and an anemone.—God help ye!—Come to me,
and be informed of the nature of all plants, “from
the cedar on Mount Lebanon to the hyssop that
springeth out of the wall.”—Pray do not fail to
decorate your new garden, whence you may trans∣plant
all kinds of flowers into your verses;. If by
chance you make a visit at I—fifty years hence,
from some distant part of England, shall you forget
this little angle where you used to muse and sing?

<P>IT is now Sunday evening, and I have been ex∣hibiting
myself in my walks to no less than a
hundred and fifty people, and that with no less
slate and vanity than a Turk in his seraglio.—
I have <HI>some</HI> hopes of seeing you <HI>this</HI> week; but if
these should happen to be frustrated, I shall find
them revive with double ardour and vivacity the next.
Did not you tell me of a treatise that your Mr. Mil∣ler
had, where the author endeavours to vindicate
and establish Gothic architecture? and does not the
same man explain it also by draughts on copper
plates? That very book, or rather the title and the
author's name, I want.—I shall never, I believe, be
entirely partial to Goths or Vandals either; but I
think, by the assistance of some such treatise, I could
sketch out some charming Gothic temples and Go∣thic
benches for garden-seats.—I do also esteem it
<PB N="161" REF="170"/>
extremely ridiculous to permit another person to de∣sign
<HI>for</HI> you, when by sketching out your own plans
you <HI>appropriate</HI> the merit of all you build, and feel
a double pleasure from any praises which it receives.—
I had here last Wednesday Dean Lyttelton, Mr.
William Lyttelton, Commodore West, Miss Lyt∣telton,
and Miss West. They drank tea, and went
round my walks, where they seemed astonished they
had been so long ignorant of the beauties of the
place; said, in general, every thing that was <HI>com∣plaisant</HI>
or <HI>friendly;</HI> and left me highly delighted
with <HI>their</HI> visit, and with room to hope for many
more. Mean time, why do not <HI>you</HI> come? I <HI>do</HI> say,
you are not Pylades.—What! you think, because
you have an agreeable wife, and five fine children,
that you must employ all your time in caressing
them at home, or laying schemes for their emolu∣ment
abroad? Is this public spirit? is this virtue?
or, if it be virtue, dost thou think, because thou
art <HI>vartusus,</HI> there must be no cakes and ale? is it
not your duty to partake of them with a <HI>friend</HI>
sometimes; easing and relieving him under what
Boileau calls,
<Q>“Le penible fardeau de n'avoir rien à faire;”</Q>
and what Pope (<HI>stealing</HI> from the former) denomi∣nates
<Q>“The pain and penalties of idleness”?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="171"/>
PRAY come the first day of the week, and let
Mr. Fancourt accompany you.—I have not much to
add by way of news. The Duke of Somerset is going
to lay out thirty thousand pounds upon Northumber∣land-house;
nine houses to be purchased and pul∣led
down on the other side the Strand for stables;
the Strand there to be widened: I cannot tell you
half; but one thing more I will, which is, that there
will be a chapel on one side of the quadrangle, with
a Gothic wainscot and cieling, and painted glass;
and ☞ in it a Dutch stove, contrived so as to look
like a tomb with an urn upon it.</P>
<P>WHAT need I <HI>write</HI> all this? am I not to see you

<P>THOUGH I have not hitherto troubled you with
a letter, I have not been void either of <HI>inquiry</HI> or
<HI>information,</HI> concerning the state of your affairs, and
<PB N="163" REF="172"/>
of Mr. Hardy's health. Indeed it is now several
weeks since I collected some particulars from your
brother, and I am now impatient for further intelli∣gence.
As to the circumstances of our friendly re∣ception
at Wroxall, Mr. John Jago has probably
enough acquainted you with them. He <HI>would,</HI> how∣ever,
seduce me to give you a distinct account; being
assured, as he says, that Mr. Wren's behaviour must
afford a good subject for drollery. I do not know
how far this would be proper; but I think, when I
write again to my friend Wren, to give <HI>him</HI> a sketch
of his own character, just as it appeared to us during
the time of our visit. Perhaps it may avail a little.
Amidst his violent passion for gardening, if he would
but prune away some wild excrescences from one or
two branches of his character, he might bring him∣self
to bear good fruit. He should <HI>weed</HI> his <HI>mind</HI> a
little; where there has sprung up a most luxuriant crop
of puns, that threaten to choak all its wholesome pro∣ductions—

He has good sense and good-nature; pity he should

Since I came home, I have done little else than plant
bushes, hazel, hawthorn, crabtree, elder, &amp;c. toge∣ther
with some flowering shrubs that I have had gi∣ven
me, and some that I have purchased to the amount
of twenty shillings. I think nothing remarkable has
occurred; only, one miserable tempestuous day, I
<PB N="164" REF="173"/>
had my Lord Stamford, who called to see my walks.
My Lord promised to come again in the summer, and
invited me more than once to Enville. By the way,
he is now building a Gothic green-house by Mr.
Miller's direction, and intends to build castles, and
God-knows-what. By all accounts, the place is well
worth seeing when you come into the country, which
I hope you will not fail to do this spring. Pray do
not you embroil me with Mr. Miller, in regard to <HI>any</HI>
observations I made in his walks. Remember, there
were a great many things with which I was highly de∣lighted;
and forget that there were a few also which
I seemed less to admire. Indeed, I thought it idle to
regulate my expressions, amongst friends only, by the
same rules which I ought to observe in mixed com∣pany.
I say <HI>ought,</HI> for <HI>he</HI> has been exceedingly fa∣vourable
to <HI>me</HI> in his representation of The Leasowes.—
I hope to see Mr. Fancourt with you, when you
come this spring; and why not your brother? he can
spend half a week every now and then at Wroxall.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing to <HI>insert</HI> or <HI>inclose</HI> in this letter that

give orders to my workmen; I saunter about my

you “The Life of Socrates” when I can get it home
from Barrels. I wish both your circumstances and
mine would allow of an utter <HI>inattention</HI> to them; and
then, I believe, our natural indolence would be a kind

my acquaintance this year; but what <HI>doth</HI> it? The cir∣cle

good deal upon this subject; but I have only room to
desire you would give me your opinion how I should
inscribe my urn to Mr. Somervile. “Author of The
Chace” cannot be tolerably expressed in Latin
without a circumlocution. I aim at brevity, and
would therefore omit it. Pray read over the speci∣mens
I have thrown together, and <HI>oblige</HI> me with a

<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE myself obliged to you for pro∣curing
me the pictures. I received them both very
safe, as I have a pretty strong assurance I <HI>shall</HI> do most
<PB N="166" REF="175"/>
articles of which my servant Tom has the care.—
He has punctuality and management, to <HI>atone</HI> for his
<HI>imperfections.</HI> He brought me those paper-sculled
busts from Wroxall entirely unhurt, contrary to the
expectation of all that saw them; after which, he
might undertake for almost any thing.—The por∣trait
is undoubtedly a good one. I shewed it to
Mr. Smart (who is a painter himself, though a cler∣gyman),
and he allowed as much; added also; that
it had something of Sir Godfrey Kneller, as well as
of Sir Peter Lely.—The flower-piece is very good,
so far as relates to the flowers; the dog and parrot
abominable, and the grapes very exceptionable. I
never considered the two flower-pieces at Icheneton
with attention enough to cause a preference; having
never any thoughts that <HI>either</HI> would fall to my share.
I shall add nothing with regard to your choice; but
that I sincerely <HI>hope</HI> yours is the better piece. I
never heard of Casteels, I own; nor can I find his
name in any of my accounts of the painters, though
they take in pretty modern ones: but I can say this
for your comfort, that if he excelled in any thing,
it was probably in flowers: for I see his name at
the bottom of those flower-pieces that I have in water
colours, as the designer of them; and I think the
designs are good. Though I could with neither the
Cupid nor the fruit-piece had escaped us, yet is there
no blame to be laid at your door; at least supposing
that you are endowed with nothing more than ra∣tional
<PB N="167" REF="176"/>
conjecture, and that you are not gifted with
prophesy.</P>
<P>AND now, having spoken, I think, to <HI>most</HI> parts
of your letter, I proceed to say a word or two in
the way of appendix. First then, after five or six
weeks work of masons and carpenters, I plainly dis∣cover
that my house is an unfinishable thing;—and
yet, I persuade myself, there will never be wanting
a room in it, where you may spend an agreeable
day with your undoubted friend.—Did ever tell you
how <HI>unseasonably</HI> the three fiddles struck up in my
grove about an hour after you left me; and how
a set of ten bells was heard from my wood the
evening after? It might have passed for the harmony
of some aërial spirit, who was a well-wisher to us
poor mortals; but that I think, had it been so, it
would have been addressed to the <HI>better sort,</HI> and of
consequence have been heard whilst <HI>you</HI> were <HI>here.</HI>
This by way of introduction to what I am going to
tell you. Mr. Pixell has made an agreement with
his club at Birmingham, to give me a day's music
in some part of my walks. The time is not yet
fixed; but, if you were an idle man, and could be
brought over at a day or two's notice, I would give
it you, and be in hopes I could entertain you very
agreeably.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="177"/>
You cannot think how much you gratified my
vanity when you were here, by saying, that if this
place were yours, you thought you should be less
able to keep within the bounds of <HI>aeconomy</HI> than my∣self.—
God knows, it is pain and grief to me to
observe her rules at <HI>all;</HI> and <HI>rigidly</HI> I never can.—
How is it possible to possess improveable scenes, and
not with to improve them? and how is it possible,
with oeconomy, to be at the expence of improving
them upon my fortune? To be continually in fear
of excess in perfecting every trifling design, how irk∣some!
to be restrained from attempting, <HI>any,</HI> how
vexatious! so that I never can enjoy my situation—
that is certain.—Oeconomy, that invidious old ma∣tron!
on occasion of every frivolous expence, makes
such a hellish squawling, that the murmur of a cas∣cade
is utterly lost to me.—Often do I cry out with
Cowley,
<Q><L>“O rivers! brooks! when, when in <HI>you,</HI> shall I</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
The Lensowes, <DATE>Sept. 9, 1750.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>PRAY, is laziness an excuse for not writing?
Tell me.—However, if it be so, I am afraid I
shall want an excuse for laziness; like the philosopher,
who, supposing the world might rest upon a tortoise's
back, found himself no less embarrassed for a
pedestal to support his tortoise. I have, indeed, been
pretty busy at home in raising a pool-dam, and
have interchanged a few visits with such of my ac∣quaintance
as live within three miles.—What then?—
I abominate all excuses that are grounded upon
the business or amusements of an idle man—as if
such a person's time was so wholly filled up, that
he could not find half an hour to write a line to
his friend. It is best to acknowledge laziness at first,
and that there are particular intervals, when one is
much less disposed to write even a few lines than at
others; and then, as to laziness, one has nothing to
do but to plead human frailty; which, if a person
has not too many frailties besides, may perhaps
be indulged him. However, “Veniarn petimusque,
damusque,” will not fail to weigh with every good∣natured
man. The chief dealing I have with Harris
the Jew is, for the intelligence which he brings me
concerning you and Mrs. W—; but it seldom amounts
<PB N="170" REF="179"/>
to much more than that you are well, and in your
garden.</P>
<P>He is an Ebrew Jew, or he would tell me you
had purchased a couple of genteel horses, or a chaise
and pair, and were coming over to The Leasowes to
spend a week with me.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, I hope to see you soon: but <HI>en
passant</HI> I assure you, I shall go in about a month
to Mr. Jago's, and from thence to Mr. Miller's;
who, I believe I told you, was here, with Mr. Lyt∣telton,
Lady Aylesbury, Colonel Conway, &amp;c. I
think I never answered your query concerning Co∣lonel
Lyttelton.—He is the same person that you
remember, and your prophesy concerning him has
been literally accomplished. He is a man of courage,
genius, generosity, and politeness; has been for∣tunate
in the world; was made a Colonel at about
six and twenty; distinguished himself in several cam∣paigns;
married the Dutchess of Bridgewater; and
had the other day about sixteen thousand pounds
left him by. Colonel Jefferies, a very distant rela∣tion.
He has a seat, and speaks, in the House of
Commons; has bought a town and country-house,
the latter of which he is ornamenting in the modern
way. His Dutchess the most unceremonious even-tempered
woman that lives.—So enjoy the spirit of
prophesy, and exert it again.—It needs little more
<PB N="171" REF="180"/>
than good sense. Which of the historians is it, that
foretold in his history a very remarkable series of
events, by dint of this alone, and which were all
accomplished? Let me know what you are doing
now. Have you repaired the farm-house you talked
of?—and have you remembered to make the man
a couple of good large niches in his chimney cor∣ner,
where he and his family may spend a more
comfortable evening than was ever spent by any
first minister in Christendom—perhaps also converse
more to the purpose? You tell me nothing of your
Mr. Jago, Seignior Benedict, the new-married man.
Tell him to leave his wife and family for a day or
two, saddle his mule, and come over to The Leasowes.—
Tell him, all pleasures are heightened by a little
discontinuance.—Tell him, did I say?—how can
you for shame advise him so contrarily to your own
practice?</P>

<P>IT never can be that I owe you for three letters;
as to two, I will agree with you; one that I
received together with my books, and the other
soon after; but that I am indebted for more than
these—
<Q><L>“Credat Judaeus. Apella,</L>
<L>Non ego.”</L></Q>
Even that same “Judaeus A pella” who affords me
this very opportunity of sending my compliments
to you and Mrs. W—, and of assuring you, that
If I had not purposed to have seen you, I had wrote
to you long ago.</P>
<P>MASTER Harris talks very respectfully of your
garden; and we have no dispute, save only in one
point—he says, that you labour very hard in your
vocation; whereas I am not willing to allow that
all the work you ever did, or will do in it, is worth
a single bunch of radishes. However, I dare not
contradict him too much, because he waits for my
letter</P>
<P>How happy are you, that can hold up your spade,
and cry, “Avaunt, Satan!” when a toyman offers
<PB N="173" REF="182"/>
you his deceitsul vanities! Do not you rejoice in∣wardly,
and pride yourself greatly in your own phi∣losophy?
<Q><L>“'Twas thus—</L>
<L>The wife Athenian cross'd a glitt'ring fair:</L>
<L>Unmov'd by tongues and sights he walk'd the

<L>Thro' tape, tags, tinsel, gimp, perfume, and
lace;</L>
<L>Then bends from Mars's Hill his awful eyes,</L>
<L>And, “What a world I never want!” he cries.”</L>
<L>PARNELL</L></Q>
Mean time, do not despise others that can find
any needful amusement in what, I think, Bunyan
very aptly calls <HI>Vanity Fair;</HI> I have been at it many
times this season, and have bought many kinds of
merchandize there. It is a part of philosophy, to
adapt one's passions to one's way of life; and the
solitary unsocial sphere in which I move makes me
think it happy that I can retain a relish for such
trifles as I can draw into it. Mean time, I dare
not reason too much upon this head. Reason,
like the famous concave mirrour at Paris, would, in
two minutes, vitrify all the Jew's pack: I mean,
that it would immediately destroy all the form, co∣lour,
and beauty, of everything that is not merely
<PB N="174" REF="183"/>
useful.—But I ramble too far, and you do not want
such speculations. My intent, when I sat down,
was to tell you, that I shall probably see you very
soon, and certainly remain in the mean time, and
at all times, Sir,</P>

<HEAD>LXII. To a Friend, on various Subjests.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr.—,</OPENER>
<P>WITH the utmost gratitude for the obser∣vations
which you sent me, and with the
highest opinion of their propriety in general, do I
sit down to answer your obliging letter. You will
not take it amiss, I know, if I scribble broken hints,
and trace out little sketches of my mind, just as I
should go near to explain it if I were upon the spot,
as often as I think of you, which I beg leave to as∣sure
you happens many times in a day. They say,
“A word to the wise is enough;” a word, there∣fore,
to a friend of understanding may be supposed
to be something more than enough, because it is
probable he is acquainted with three parts of one's
<PB N="175" REF="184"/>
mind before.—The censure you have passed upon
Milton's Lycidas, so far as it regards the metre which
he has chosen, is unexceptionably just; and one
would imagine, if that argument concerning the
distance of the rhimes were pressed home in a pub∣lic
essay, it should be sufficient to extirpate that kind
of verse for ever. As to my opinion concerning the
choice of English metre, I dare not touch upon the
subject; and I will give you my reason: I began upon
it in a letter which I intended for you about a month
ago; and I soon found that I had filled a sheet of
paper with my dissertation, and left no room for
other things which I had more mind to communicate.
Beside, I found it so blotted that I did not chuse
to send it; and as the subject is so extremely co∣pious,
I shall decline it entirely, till <HI>talking</HI> may
prove as effectual as <HI>writing.</HI>—As to your advice
with regard to my publications, I believe it to be
just, and shall, in all probability, pursue it.—I am
afraid, by your account, that Dodsley has published
my name to “The School-mistress.” I was a good
deal displeased at his publishing that poem without my
knowledge, when he had so many opportunities of
giving me some previous information; but, as he
would probably disregard my resentment, I chose
to stifle it, and wrote to him directly upon the re∣ceipt
of yours, that I would be glad to furnish him
with an improved copy of “The School-mistress,” &amp;c.
for his second edition. He accepts it with some
<PB N="176" REF="185"/>
complaisance, desires it soon; and I am at a fault
to have the opinion of my friends, what alterations
or additions it will be proper to insert. I have scrib∣bled
a copy, which I send this day to Mr. Graves
and Mr. Whistler; bat I am greatly fearful I shall
not receive their criticisms time enough, and I shall
have the same longing for yours. A journey to
Whitchurch, which I have long proposed, might
unite all these advantages; and I heartily wish I
may be able to effect it without inconvenience. If
I go thither, I call on you.</P>

letters of my friend Graves, wherein he de∣clares

See the effects of it! You have taken im∣mediate
advantage of his example, and I must never
more expect an answer to any letter that I send you,
<PB N="177" REF="186"/>
in less than half a century. I wrote to you after
I came home, to thank you for all your kindness
at I—, &amp;c.; but not a syllable have I been able
to receive from you, or a word that I could hear
concerning you. I could, however, very easily con∣vince

altogether so hardened an offender as you may ima∣gine.
His last letter is a very affectionate recan∣tation.

Mr. F—</P>
<P>WHAT a number of schemes are irreparably broken

my good friend, which seems to be destroyed amongst

Your interest in Mr. N—will remain the same, I
<HI>suppose;</HI> and if he would but serve you nearer <HI>home;</HI>
I will have no sort of quarrel with him that he did
not transplant you into Cornwall.—It is at least some
gratification to a person's sels-love, when one finds
the more <HI>ambitious</HI> hopes of more <HI>aspiring</HI> people as
liable to be suddenly extinguished as one's own.
However, the death of the Prince gave me a good
deal of concern, though it no way affected my <HI>par∣ticular</HI>
interest, as he had all the humane, affable,
and generous qualities, which could recommend him
to one's <HI>affection.</HI></P>

One on Medals, to Mr. Walker; and the other, on

<HEAD>LXIV. To Mr. GRAVES.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes
<DATE>Feb. 16, 1750-1.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I received your letter, I have been a week
at W—. I believe I may have told you, that
I never was fond of that place. There is too much
trivial elegance, too much punctilio for me; and
perhaps, as you express it, too much <HI>speculation.</HI>
But I was fearful I might entirely lose Mr. Whistler's
acquaintance, if I did not make, an effort once in
five years to return his visit. Besides, I should have
had no hopes of seeing him at The Leasowes here∣after;
and I am extremely desirous of seeing both
<HI>him</HI> and <HI>you</HI> here, having made many alterations
which I do not undertake but with an eye to the
approbation of my more ingenious friends; but he
seems, to my great surprize, to renounce the thing
called <HI>taste</HI> in buildings, gardens, &amp;c. is grown
weary of his own little embellishments at W—, and
longs to settle in London for the greater part of his
time. This, I believe, he would put in execution
immediately; but that he thinks it might give some
uneasiness to his mother, if he should quit the house
that she with so much difficulty obtained for him.
<HI>I</HI> too am sick of the word <HI>taste;</HI> but I think the
<HI>thing</HI> itself the only proper <HI>ambition,</HI> and the <HI>specific
pleasure</HI> of all who have any share in the faculty of
imagination. I need not mention my reasons; you
<PB N="181" REF="190"/>
will soon conceive them. And, however the case
be, there is one branch of it which so totally en∣grosses
the persons with whom I principally con∣verse,
that I was astonished to hear him speak even
with indifference concerning the reigning taste for
rural decorations. I could ill forbear telling Mr.
Whistler, that he was now <HI>litterally</HI> a beau in a band∣box;
but the freedom might have given more of∣fence
than the joke was worth. He has improved
the place extremely; but I do not like his colon∣nades.
You know, nothing of that kind is tolera∣ble,
unless regularly executed in stone: that is one
thing. Another is, that colonnades are ornaments
which will not <HI>bear</HI> to be very <HI>diminutive.</HI> Mr.—
(whose house only I saw) has been at the expence
of a large cornice round it, in most elaborate brick∣work;
but with regard to his stucco-work <HI>within</HI>
doors, he is quite <HI>extravagant.</HI>—I mention these
things upon a supposition that you may like to
hear <HI>any</HI> thing that regards the place; but indeed
they are so mighty trifling, that I ought to doubt
my supposition. I supped with Mr. P—'s fa∣mily
once at Mr. W—'s, and once at Mr. W—'s,
and all was mighty well; only I happen to have
a violent aversion to card-playing, and at W—
I think they do nothing <HI>else:</HI> so that, on account
of my ignorance at quadrille, or any creditable
game, I was forced to lose my money, and two
evenings out of my seven, at Pope Joan with Mr.
<PB N="182" REF="191"/>
P—'s children. Mr. W—, to make me
amends, invited me to breakfast, and shewed me
your verses. I assure you, you have no occasion for
a better advocate than Mr. W—; whether with re∣gard
to his <HI>judgement,</HI> or his zeal in behalf of the
subject, the verses, or the poet. I would fain have
obtained a copy; but he did not care to give one
without your commission. I hope <HI>you</HI> will oblige
me so far. I like them very much; the subject
is genteel, and the verses easy and elegant. We
agreed upon one or two different readings; and one
stanza that concerns cards should, I think, be cor∣rected.
Not that I would have you less severe upon
cards neither; I was even glad to find, that you
gave them so little quarter. I sometimes thought
that Mr. W—'s seeming fondness for them was a
kind of <HI>contre-coeur.</HI>—Be that as it will, his ob∣jection
to the stanza, as well as mine, was solely
founded on the versification, not the sentiment. I
liked his Latin verses; but they do not interfere
with yours. Send me a copy, and confine my use
of it by what limitations you please. My reigning
toy at present is a pocket-book; and I glory as
much in furnishing it with the verses of my ac∣quaintance,
as others would with bank-bills. I did
not know when I went to W—, but I might have
heard Mrs. G—<HI>accused of certain questions touching
their law</HI> (I mean of forms and ceremonies); but I
did <HI>not.</HI> On the contrary, I had the satisfaction of
<PB N="183" REF="192"/>
hearing her person, her temper, and her understand∣ing,
much commended; but this I did not want:
the delicacy of your taste is equal with me to a
thousand commendations. Mrs. W—is really so
much altered by her indisposition, that I did not
know her. She talks of going to Bath this season;—
I talked of it too, and wish it of all earthly things.
You must know, I could not have come to Claver∣ton
<HI>instead</HI> of going to W—, as I did not determine
on the expedition at home; but at a friend's house,
where I was betwixt twenty and thirty miles on my
way thither. Besides, I would allow myself more
time when I turn my face towards Bath, than I
could this winter. Your invitation, as it is very
obliging, so it has many concurring circumstances to
recommend it at this time. I want to recover my
health, which must be recovered by Bath, or <HI>nothing;</HI>
I want to have you read some trifles of mine, which
must be ratified by you, or <HI>no one;</HI> but principally,
and above all, do I long to see you, my old friend,
and Mrs. G—, whom I expect you should render
my new one.—I am obliged for your charitable en∣deavours
to support my spirits. Your company
would do it effectually, but scarce any thing less, in
<HI>winter.</HI> Solitary life, limited circumstances, a phleg∣matic
habit, and disagreeable events, have given me
a melancholy turn, that is hardly dissipated by the
most serene sky; but in a north-east wind is quite
intolerable, After a long state of this kind, upon
<PB N="184" REF="193"/>
every access of amusement, one is apt to think it is
not <HI>right</HI> to be happy; that it is one of Wollaston's
implicit lyes; a treating things contrary to what
they <HI>deserve.</HI>—Your situation at Claverton is admired
by most people; and, if you could connect some
little matter in the neighbourhood, would be as
surely envied.</P>
<P>IT is now high time to release you.—This is not
a letter, but an olio. I desire my compliments to
Mrs. G—, and am affectionately and invariably</P>

<HEAD>LXV. To a Friend.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. G—,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Sept. 17, 1751.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very sensibly obliged to you for the <HI>diligence</HI>
and <HI>expedition</HI> which you have shewn in answer∣ing
my late request: I cannot feel the very <HI>tender∣ness</HI>
of friendship to be at all abated in me by our
long separation; nor will it at any time be possible
I should, so long as I receive such testimonies of your
usual <HI>kindness</HI> and <HI>ingenuity.</HI>—I have no sort of ex∣captions
to make against the province in which you
were engaged at Cheltenham, nor the light in which
you appeared. What you lost in any one's opinion
<PB N="186" REF="195"/>
of your independency, you would gain in their idea
of your merit, genius, and learning; and then you
had all those other advantages <HI>par dissu.</HI>—As to the
compliments that were paid to Mrs. G—, you have
something of the same sort of reason to be pleased
with them, that I have to be pleased with those
that are given to my place; which I consider as
naturally possessed of many beauties, each of them
brought to light and perfected through my own
discernment, care, and cultivation. And then your
pleasure ought, to be so much greater than mine,
as you have a nobler subject to enjoy.—Mrs. G—
has too much sense to object against the freedom of
this similitude.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help adding a few strokes to your
picture of Mrs. S—. I think her an extremely <HI>su∣perficial</HI>
female-pedant: for, after an interval of many
years since I first conversed with her at Mr.—'s,
I found her conversation turn solely upon the same
<HI>topics, definitions,</HI> and <HI>quotations.</HI> I believe, I could
easily enough have recommended myself; to a greater
degree of her favour; but her vanity and affecta∣tions
were beyond what I could bear.—Your ac∣count
of—is very picturesque, and agreeable to
the idea I always had of him; but I believe that
idea was perfected by what observations I made when
I had some of his company at London.—There was
something accountable enough to me in their bur∣lesquing
<PB N="187" REF="196"/>
Mr. L—'s monody. He is, you know,
engaged in a party; and his poem (though an ex∣traordinary
fine composition) was too tender for the
public ear. It should have been printed privately,
and a number of copies dispersed only among their
friends and acquaintance;—but even so it would
have been re-published; and it was too good to
suppress. I wish the burlesquers of such <HI>ingenuous</HI>
profusions could be punished, consistently with Eng∣lish
liberty. “Where were ye, Muses, &amp;c.” is imi∣tated
from Milton, and taken by Milton from Theo∣critus.
I write Greek wretchedly; but you will re∣member
the passage,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;</Q></P>
<P>I HEARD, once before, it was burlesqued under
the title of “An Elegy on the Death of a favou∣rite
Cat;” but the burlesque will die, and the
poem will survive.—You tell me, “The Author of
Peregrine Pickle says, if you will flatter Mr. Lyt∣telton
well, he will at last make you a Middlesex
Justice;” and it happened oddly that, whilst I
was reading your letter, a neighbour told me, I was
put in the commission of the peace. I have never
received a single line from Mr. Whistler, and I be∣lieve
my journey to W—has given the final blow
to our friendship. Pray was not Mr. Blandy some
relation of theirs, or only their attorney? The af∣fair
<PB N="188" REF="197"/>
fair is uncommonly shocking; and I fancy the <HI>ge∣nuine</HI>
accounts that Mr. W—sends you will be cu∣rious
anecdotes at Bath.—I suppose you have painted
your room with oil colours, and made it <HI>really</HI> hand∣some.—
I drew out a festoon and a medal some time
ago, for a pannel over Mr. P—'s chimney; but they
knew not what to make of the medal, and had only
the festoon executed in stone colour, by a common
painter;—yours is better, and in character.—I am
a degree more frugal than you; for I only use quick
lime, and either blue or yellow sand, to take away
the objection which I have to whited walls.</P>
<P>I PAID a visit to Mr. Lyttelton, the Dean, &amp;c.
since he came down; but had little of their com∣pany,
for they thought Sir Thomas was dying:
however, by unparalleled strength of constitution,
he lingered in violent pain till last Saturday, when
he died, very much lamented. He had good na∣tural
parts, well improved by reading modern writers,
and by the knowledge of the world: extremely pru∣dent,
considerate, humane, polite, and charitable.—
I have jumbled his more obvious qualities together,
that you may not think I am usurping the province
of a news-man. Sir George will lose no time in
building a new house, or doing what is more than
<HI>equivalent</HI> to the old one.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="198"/>
I WANT no <HI>temptation</HI> to come immediately to C—.
This is a melancholy <HI>season</HI> with me always; whe∣ther
it be owing to the scenes I see, or to, the ef∣fect
of hazy skies upon an iil-perspiring skin.—I can
say no more at <HI>present,</HI> than that I most ardently
desire to see you, and desire my humble service to
Mrs. G—. I have a chalybeat spring in the mid∣dle,
of my grotto: what think, you of this inscrip∣tion?</P>

<HEAD>LXVI. To Mr: GRAVES, on the Death of Mr.
SHENSTONE'S Brother.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Feb. 14, 1752.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be amazed at my long silence; and
it might reasonably excite some disgust if my
days had passed of late in the manner they used to
do: but I am not the man I was; perhaps I never
<PB N="190" REF="199"/>
<HI>shall</HI> be. Alas! my dearest friend! I have lost my
only brother! and, since the fatal close of Novem∣ber,
I have had neither peace nor respite from agoniz∣ing
thoughts!</P>
<P>You, I think, have <HI>seen</HI> my brother; but perhaps
had no opportunity of distinguishing him from the
groupe of others whom we call <HI>good-natured</HI> men.
This part of his character was so visible in his
countenance, that he was generally beloved at sight;
<HI>I,</HI> who must be allowed to know him, do assure you,
that his understanding was no way inferior to his
benevolence. He had not only a found judgement,
but a lively wit and genuine humour. As these
were many-times eclipsed by his native bashfulness,
so his benevolence only suffered by being shewn to
an excess. I here mean his giving too indiscrimi∣nately
into those jovial meetings of company, where
the warmth of a social temper is discovered with
least reserve; but the virtues of his head and heart
would soon have shone without alloy. The foibles
of his youth were wearing off; and his affection for
me and regard to my advice, with his own good
sense, would soon have rendered him all that I could
have wished in a successor. I never in my life knew
a person more sincere in the expression of his love
or dislike. But it was the <HI>former</HI> that suited the
propensity of his heart; the <HI>latter</HI> was as transient
as the starts of passion that occasioned it. In short,
<PB N="191" REF="200"/>
with much true genius and real fortitude, he was,
according to the <HI>English</HI> acceptation, “a truly ho∣nest
man;” and I think I may also add, a truly
English character; but “habeo, dixi? immo <HI>habui</HI>
“fratrem &amp; amicum, Chreme!” All this have I
<HI>lost</HI> in him. He is now in regard to <HI>this</HI> world no
more than a mere idea; and this idea, therefore,
though deeply tinged with melancholy, I must, and
surely <HI>ought</HI> to, cherish and preserve.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE I wrote you some account of his illness
last spring; from which to all appearance he was
tolerably well recovered. He took the air, and
visited about with me, during the warmer months
of summer; but my pleasure was of short duration.
“Haesit lateri lethalis arundo!” The peripneumony
under which he laboured in the spring had termi∣nated
in an adhesion of the lungs to the pleura, so
that he could never lie but upon his right side; and
this, as the weather grew colder, occasioned an ob∣struction
that could never be surmounted.</P>
<P>THOUGH my reason forewarned me of the event,
I was not the more prepared for it.—Let me not
dwell upon it.—It is altogether insupportable in
<HI>every respect;</HI> and my imagination seems more as∣siduous
in educing pain from this occasion, than I
ever yet found it in administering to my pleasure.—
This hurts me to no purpose—I know it; and yet,
<PB N="192" REF="201"/>
when I have avocated my thoughts, and fixed them
for a while upon common amusements, I suffer the
same sort of consciousness as if I were guilty of a
crime. Believe me, this has been the most sensible
affliction I ever felt in my life; and you, who know
my anxiety when I had far less reason to complain,
will more easily <HI>conceive</HI> it now, than I am able to
describe it.</P>
<P>I CANNOT pretend to fill up my paper with my
usual subjects.—I should thank you for your re∣marks
upon my poetry; but I despise poetry: and
I might tell you of all my little rural improve∣ments;
but I hate them.—What can I now expect
from my solitary rambles through them, but a series
of melancholy reflections and irksome anticipations?—
Even the pleasure, I should take in shewing them
to <HI>you,</HI> the greatest they can afford me, must be now
greatly inferior to what it might formerly have been.</P>
<P>How have I prostituted my sorrow on occasions
that little concerned me! I am ashamed to think
of that idle “Elegy upon Autumm,” when I have
so much more important cause to hate and to con∣demn
it <HI>now;</HI> but the glare and gaiety of the Spring
is what I <HI>principally</HI> dread; when I shall find all
things restored but my poor brother, and something
like those lines of Milton will run for ever in my
thoughts:
<Q><PB N="193" REF="202"/>
<L>“Thus, with the year,</L>
<L><HI>Seasons</HI> return; but not to <HI>me</HI> returns</L>
<L>A brother's cordial smile, at eve or morn.”</L></Q>
I shall then seem to wake from amusements, com∣pany,
every <HI>sort</HI> of inebriation with which I have
been endeavouring to lull my grief asleep, as from
a dream; and I shall feel as if I were, <HI>that instant,</HI>
despoiled of all I have chiefly valued for thirty years
together; of all my present happiness, and all my
future prospects. The melody of birds, which he
no more must hear; the chearful beams of the sun,
of which he no more must partake; <HI>every</HI> wonted
pleasure will produce that <HI>sort</HI> of pain to which my
temper is most obnoxious. Do not consider this as
poetry.—Poetry on such occasions is no more than
literal truth. In the present case it is <HI>less;</HI> for half
the tenderness I feel is altogether shapeless and in∣expressible.</P>
<P>AFTER all, the wisdom of the world may per∣haps
esteem me a gainer. Ill do they judge of this
event, who think that any shadow of amends can be
made for the death of a brother, and the disappoint∣ment
of all my schemes, by the accession of some
fortune, which I never can enjoy!</P>
<P>THIS is a mournful narrative: I will not, there∣fore,
enlarge it.—Amongst all changes and chances,
I often think of you; and pray there may be no
<PB N="194" REF="203"/>
suspicion or jealousy betwixt us during the rest of
our lives.</P>

<HEAD>LXVII. To C—W—, Esq.</HEAD>
<P>ALAS! dear Mr. W—! the terrible event has
happened! I have lost the best of brothers;
and you are to pity, not to condemn, your un∣fortunate
correspondent.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of November I had prepared
a letter for you, which lies now amongst my papers.
At that time, amidst all my apprehensions, I had
some hopes to support me; but before I could send
it, my situation was greatly altered, and the month
did not wholly expire, till it had effectually render∣ed
me the most wretched of mankind.</P>
<P>THUS much it was necessary I should tell you;
you will pardon me, if I do not descend any farther
into an account of merit that is lost, and of sorrow
which is too apt to revive of itself. Be assured, it
is to me a loss which the whole world cannot com∣pensate;
<PB N="195" REF="204"/>
and an affliction which the longest time I
can live will not be able to erase.</P>
<P>YOU said, you would let Master W—come and
spend a few days with me.—I beseech you do.—It
will be some relief to me; and, God knows, I have
occasion enough for every assistance that can be
drawn from correspondence, company, or amuse∣ment.</P>
<P>YOU, Sir, I presume, proceed in the innocent re∣creations
of your garden, and those may at least prove
a balance for any small disquiets that attend you.
If greater ills befal you, you have persons near you
to alleviate them—a wife, family, visitants male
and female, friends in abundance, and a table suf∣ficiently
hospitable to attract even your enemies.
With me the case is otherwise. What I have un∣dergone
this winter, may you never feel so much as
in apprehension!</P>

<OPENER>Dear Mr. W—,
<DATE>July 22, 1752.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I DO not know why I made you a promise of a
pretty long letter. What I now write will be but
a moderate one, both in regard to length and stile;
yet write I must, <HI>par muniere d'acquit,</HI> and you have
brought four-pence expence upon yourself for a
parcel of nonsense, and to no manner of purpose.
This is not tautology, you must observe; for non∣sense
sometimes answers very considerable purposes.—
In love, it is eloquence itself.—In friendship, there∣fore,
by all the rules of sound logic, you must al∣low
it to be something; what I cannot say, “nequeo
monstrare, &amp; sentio tantum.” The principal part
of a correspondence betwixt two idle men consists
in two important enquiries—what we do, and how
we do; but as all persons ought to give satisfaction
before they expect to receive it, I am to tell you in
the first place, that my own health is tolerably good,
or rather what I must call good, being, I think, much
better that it has been this last half-year.—Then
as touching my occupation, alas! “Othello's oc∣cupation's
gone!” I neither read nor write aught
besides a few letters; and I give myself up entirely
to scenes of dissipation; lounge at my Lord Dudley's
for near a week together; make dinners; accept of
invitations; sit up till three o'clock in the morning
<PB N="197" REF="206"/>
with young sprightly married women, over white
port and <HI>vin de paysans;</HI> ramble over my fields;
issue out orders to my hay-makers; foretel rain and
fair weather; enjoy the fragance of hay, the cocks,
and the wind-rows; admire that universal lawn,
which is produced by the scythe; sometimes in∣spect,
and draw mouldings for my carpenters; some∣times
paper my walls, and at other times my ciel∣ings;
do every social office that falls in my way,
but never seek out for any.</P>
<P>“SED vos quid tandem? quae circumvolitas agilis∣thyma?
non tu corpus eras sine pectore. Non
tibi parvum ingenium, non incultum est!” In
short, what do you? and how do you do?—that is
all.</P>
<P>TELL my young pupil, your son, he must by all
manner of means send me a Latin letter: and if he
have any billet in French for Miss Lea at The
Grange, or even in Hebrew, Coptic, or Syriac, I
will engage it shall be received very graciously.
Thither am I going to dinner this day, and there
“implebor veteris Bacchi, pinguisque ferinae.”</P>
<P>ALL this looks like extreme jollity; but is this
the true state of the case, or may I not more pro∣perly
apply the

<HEAD>LXIX To Mr. G—, on the Receipt of his Picture.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. G—,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Oct. 3, 1752</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very unfeignedly ashamed to reflect how long
it is since I received your present, and how much
longer it is since I received your letter. I have been
resolving to write to you almost daily ever since you
left me; yet have foolishly enough permitted avo∣cations
(of infinitely less importance than your cor∣respondence)
to interfere with my gratitude, my in∣terest,
and my inclination. What apology I have to
make, though no way adequate to my negligence,
is in short as follows. After the receipt of your
letter, I deferred writing till I could speak of the
arrival of your picture.—This did not happen till
about a month or five weeks ago, when I was em∣barrassed
with masons, carvers, carpenters, and com∣pany,
<PB N="199" REF="208"/>
all at a time. And though it were idle enough
to say, that I could not find <HI>one</HI> vacant hour for my
purpose, yet in truth my head was so confused by
these multifarious distractions, that I could have writ∣ten
nothing satisfactory either to <HI>myself</HI> or <HI>you:</HI> no∣thing
worth a single <HI>penny,</HI> supposing the postage
were to cost you no more. The workmen had not
<HI>finished my rooms</HI> a minute, when Lady Luxborough,
Mrs. Davies, and Mr. Outing arrived, with <HI>five</HI>
servants and a <HI>set</HI> of horses, to stay with me for
some time. After a nine days visit, I returned with
them to Barrels, where I continued for a week;
and whither (by the way) I go again with Lord Dud∣ley
in about a fortnight's time. Other company fil∣led
up the interstices of my summer; and I hope
my dear friend will accept of this apology for so
long a chasm of silence, during which I have been
uniformly at his service, and true to that inviolable
friendship I shall ever bear him.</P>
<P>I PROCEED now to thank you for the <HI>distinction</HI>
you shew me, in sending me your picture: I do it
very sincerely. It is asssuredly a strong likeness, as
my Lady Luxborough with all her servants that have
<HI>seen you</HI> pronounce, as well as I; consequently more
valuable to a <HI>friend</HI> than a face he does not know,
though it were one of Raphael's. The smile about
the mouth is bad; as it agrees but ill with the
gravity of the eyes, and as a smile ever so little
<PB N="200" REF="209"/>
<HI>outré</HI> has a bad effect in a picture where it is <HI>constant,</HI>
though it may be ever so graceful in a person where
it is <HI>transitory.</HI> However, this may be altered, when
I can meet with a good painter. I have no <HI>other</HI>
objection, but to the prominence of the belly. The
hair, I think, is good; and the coat and band no
way exceptionable. I have given it all the advan∣tage
I can: it has a good light, and makes part of
an elegant chimney-piece in a genteel, though lit∣tle
breakfast-room, at the end of my house.</P>
<P>MR. Whistler and I are now upon good terms,
and two or three friendly letters have been inter∣changed
betwixt us. He presses me to come to
Whitchurch, and I <HI>him</HI> to come over to The Lea∣sowes;
but the winter cometh, when no man can
visit.—The dispute is adjusted by <HI>time,</HI> whilst we
are arguing it by <HI>expostulation.</HI>—No uncommon event
in most sublunary projects!</P>
<P>LADY Luxborough said very extraordinary things
in praise of Mrs. G—, after you left us at Barrels;
yet I sincerely believe no more than she deserves.
I took the liberty of shewing her your letter here,
as it included a compliment to her which I thought
particularly genteel.—She will always consider you
as a person of genius, and her friend.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="210"/>
DURING most of this summer (wherein I have
seen much company either here or at Lord Dudley's),
I have been almost constantly engaged in one con∣tinued
scene of <HI>jollity.</HI> I endeavoured to find <HI>relief</HI>
from such sort of dissipation; and, when I had once
given in to it, I was obliged to proceed; as, they
say, is the case when persons disguise their faces with
paint. <HI>Mine</HI> was a sort of <HI>painting</HI> applied to my
temper.—“Spem vultu simulare, premere atrum
corde dolorem.” And the moment I left it off,
my soul appeared again all haggard and forlorn.
My company has now deserted me; the spleen-fogs
begin to rise; and the <HI>terrible</HI> incidents of last win∣ter
revive apace in my memory. This is my state
of mind, while I write you these few lines; yet, I
thank God, my health is not much amiss.</P>
<P>I DID not forget my promise of a box, &amp;c. to
Mrs. G—. I had a dozen sent me, one or two of
which I could have liked, had they been better
<HI>finished.</HI> They were of a good oval, white enamel,
with flowers, &amp;c. but horribly gilt, and not accu∣rately
painted. I beg my best service to her, and
will make a fresh essay. My dearest friend, accept
this awkward letter for the present.—In a few posts,
I will write again.—Believe me yours from the bot∣tom of my soul.</P>

and ride to Harbury this instant, I should much
more willingly do so than begin this letter. Such ter∣rible
events have happened to us, since we saw each
other last, that, however irksome it may be to dwell
upon them, it is in the same degree unnatural to
substitute any subject in their place.</P>
<P>I DO sincerely forgive your long silence, my good
friend, indeed I do; though it gave me uneasiness. I
hope you do the same by mine. I own, I could not
readily account for the <HI>former</HI> period of yours, any
otherwise than by supposing that I had said or done
something, in the levity of my heart, which had given
you disgust; but being conscious to myself of the
most sincere regard for you, and believing it could
never be discredited for any <HI>trivial</HI> inadvertencies, I
remember, I continued still in expectation of a letter,
and did not dream of writing till such time as I had
<PB N="203" REF="212"/>
received one. I trusted you would write at <HI>last;</HI> and
that, by all my past endeavours to demonstrate my
<HI>friendship,</HI> you would believe the <HI>tree</HI> was rooted in
my heart, whatever irregularity you might observe in
the <HI>branches.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was my situation before that dreadful aera
which gave me such a shock as to banish my best
friends for a time out of my memory. And when they
recurred, as they did the first of any thing, I was made
acquainted with that deplorable misfortune of yours!
Believe me, I sympathized in <HI>your</HI> affliction, nothwith∣standing
my own; but alas! what comfort could I
administer, who had need of every possible assistance to
support myself? I wrote indeed a few letters with
<HI>difficulty;</HI> amongst the rest, one to my friend Graves;
but it was to vent my complaint.—I will send you the
letter, if you please, as it is by far my least painful
method of conveying you some account of my situa∣tion.
Let it convince you, that I could have written
nothing at that time, which could have been of any
service to you: let it afford you, at least, a faint
sketch of my dearest brother's character; but let it not
appear an ostentatious display of sorrow, of which I
am by no means guilty. I know but too well that I
discovered upon the occasion, what some would call,
an unmanly tenderness; but I know also, that sorrow
upon such subjects as these is very consistent with vir∣tue,
and with the most absolute resignation to the just
<PB N="204" REF="213"/>
decrees of Providence—“Hominis est enim affici do∣lore,
<HI>sentire;</HI> resistere tamen &amp; solatia admittere,
non solatiis non egere.” Pliny.—I drank, pur∣chased
amusements, never suffered myself to be a mi∣nute
without company, no matter what, so it was but
continual. At length, by an attention to such con∣versation
and such amusements as I could at other
times despise, I forgot so far as to be chearful.—And
after this, the summer, through an almost constant
succession of lively and agreeable visitants, proved
even a scene of jollity.—It was inebriation all, though
of a mingled nature; yet has it maintained a sort of
truce with grief, till time can assist me more effectu∣ally
by throwing back the event to a distance.—
Now, indeed, that my company has all forsaken me,
and I am delivered up to winter, silence, and reflec∣tion,
the incidents of the last year revive apace in my
memory; and I am even astonished to think of the
gaiety of my summer. The fatal anniversary, the
“dies quem semper acerbum, &amp;c.” is beginning to
approach, and every face of the sky suggests the ideas
of last winter.—Yet I find myself; chearful in <HI>company;</HI>
nor would I recommend it to you to be much alone.—
You would lay the highest obligation upon me by
coming over at this time.—I pressed your brother,
whom I saw at Birmingham, to use his influence with
you; but if you can by no means undertake the jour∣ney,
I will take my speediest opportunity of seeing
you at Harbury.—Mr. Miller invited me strenuously
<PB N="205" REF="214"/>
to meet Dr. Lyttelton at his house; but I believe my
most convenient season will be, when my Lord Dud∣ley
goes to Barrels; for I can but ill bear the pensive∣ness
of a long and lonely expedition. After all, if
you <HI>could</HI> come hither first, it would afford me the
most entire satisfaction.—I have been making altera∣tions
in my house that would amuse you; and have
many matters to discourse with you, which it would
be endless to mention upon paper.—Adieu! my dear
friend! may your merit be known to some one who
has greater <HI>power</HI> to serve you than myself but be
assured, at the same time, that no one loves you bet∣ter,
or esteems you more.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH I have many reasons to urge why
I did not write to you before, or visit you from
Barrels as I fully intended, I will venture to wave
all particulars till I see you; and only assure you
in the general, that I was never able to write any
thing satisfactory, or to visit you, at that time, with
any sort of convenience.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="215"/>
BELIEVE me, my good friend, if <HI>inclination</HI> might
have ruled, I had been with you at Harbury many
weeks ago. Sure I am, they must be the <HI>cares</HI> of
home, and not the <HI>pleasures</HI> of it, that <HI>ever were</HI> suf∣ficient
to detain me during the <HI>winter season.</HI> Nor
do I think I have an enemy that wishes me more
miserable than I have almost constantly found my∣self
ever since the beginning of <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P>I CANNOT even now fix a time when I can see
you; and perhaps it may be deferred till Mr. Mil∣ler's
place will have received some advantage from
the Spring; and in that case I would infallibly see
my Lord Guilford's; but I leave this undetermined:
and I hope, if you <HI>can</HI> wander from home with any
kind of satisfaction, you will do me the justice to
believe, that you have no friend alive who will more
gladly receive you than myself.</P>
<P>I HAVE papered some rooms this last year, and
would willingly have you see them before their co∣lours
are vanished; which, I think, will unavoida∣bly
be the case of <HI>one,</HI> before a second summer be
half concluded.</P>
<P>THUS is beauty as uncertain as either fortune or
fame.</P>
<P>I SUPPOSE you have heard there is a citation from
Docters Commons, and a writ of “Ne exeat” out

against Mr. W—for an intrigue with—. If
you have not, be not <HI>precipitate</HI> in spreading the
story.—They say, he has fled into France on the
occasion.—What a shocking affair is this! so early
in life! so extensive, so lasting, so irremediable in
its consequences! but,
<Q><L>“Sic visum Veneri! cui placet <HI>impares</HI></L>
<L><HI>Formas</HI> atque <HI>animos,</HI> sub juga ahenea,</L>
<L><HI>Saevo</HI> mittere cum joco!”</L></Q>
Your misfortunes and mine incline <HI>s,</HI> almost, to
love <HI>all</HI> people that are miserable; but how will
the daughters of the Philistines rejoice on the oc∣casion;
nay, almost countenance another's loss of
virtue, by manifesting their own apparent want of
humanity!</P>
<P>THERE is a most admirable piece of allegory on
this head in the Female Fables, by Brooks, if I
mistake not; to whom the author in his preface ac∣knowledges
himself greatly indebted.</P>
<P>I AM truly sorry to understand how much you are
alone; I really imagined you were much happier in
point of company than myself, as you live in a
much politer neighbourhood; amongst persons of
genius, learning, and humanity. And happier you
<HI>are;</HI> for however I make a shift to scrape some com∣pany
<PB N="208" REF="217"/>
around me, they are such as can affect me
with little else besides the spleen.</P>
<P>Do not dwell too much on subjects that make you
thoughtful; superficial amusements are our point,
till some time hence: I am an ill adviser; but I
prescribe you the methods which I have found most
effectual with myself.</P>
<P>I HAVE not been forgetful of the task that you
enjoined me, to give you my observations on the
verses which you inclosed.—I will write my sen∣timents
on a separate paper. Do not punish me
with silence and suspence concerning you, but write.
I can ardently desire what I but little deserve, being</P>

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Feb. 27, 1753.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE you some account of myself, and in∣closed
some trivial criticisms, in a letter I sent
you about a fortnight ago, which I hope you have
received.—Tom comes now to enquire after your
<PB N="209" REF="218"/>
health, and to bring back my “Ode to Colonel Lyt∣telton;”
in regard to which, I desire that you will
not be sparing of your animadversions. I whispered
my difficulties to Mr. Miller at Hagley, how delicate
I found the subject, and how hard it was to satisfy
either myself or others; in all which points he agreed
with me. Nevertheless, having twice broken my
<HI>promise</HI> of sending a corrected copy to Sir George,
I was obliged to make my peace by a <HI>fresh</HI> one,
which, I suppose, I must of necessity perform.—Give
me your whole sentiments hereupon, I beseech you;
in particular and in general, as a critic and as a
friend.—The bad state of spirits which I complained
of in my last, for a long time together made me
utterly irresolute: every thing occasioned me sus∣pence;
and I did nothing with appetite.—This was
owing in a great measure to a slow nervous fever,
as I have since discovered by many concurrent sym∣ptoms.
It is now, I think, wearing off by degrees.
I seem to anticipate a little of that “vernal delight”
which Milton mentions, and thinks
<Q><L>“Able to chase</L>
<L>All sadness, but despair.”</L></Q>
At least, I begin to resume my silly clue of hopes
and expectations; which I know, however, <HI>will</HI> not
guide me to any thing more satisfactory than before.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="219"/>
I HAVE read scarce any new books this season.
Voltaire's new Tragedy was sent me from London;
but what has given me the <HI>most</HI> amusement, <HI>has</HI>
been the “Lettres de Madame de Maintenon.”
You have probably read them already in English,
and then I need not recommend them. The “Life of
Lord Bolingbroke” is entirely his <HI>public</HI> life, and the
book three parts filled with political remarks.</P>
<P>As to <HI>writing,</HI> I have not attempted it this year
and more; nor do I know when I shall again.—How∣ever,
I would be glad to correct that “Ode to the
Dutchess of Somerset,” when once I can find in
whose hands it is deposited. I was <HI>shewn</HI> a very
elegant letter of hers, the other day; wherein she
asks for it with great politeness: and as it includes
nothing but a love of rural life, and such sort of
amusements as she herself approves, I shall stand a
good chance of having it received with partiality.
She lives the life of a <HI>religieuse.</HI> She has <HI>written</HI> my
Lady Luxborough a very serious letter of condolence
upon the misfortune in her family; and need enough
has Lady Luxborough of so unchangeable a friend!
for sure nothing could have happened to a person
in her situation more <HI>specifically</HI> unfortunate.—Mr.
Reynolds has been at Barrels, I hear, and has brought
her a machine that goes into a coat-pocket, yet an∣swers
the end of “a jack for boots, a reading-desk,
a cribbage-board, a pair of snuffers, a ruler, an
<PB N="211" REF="220"/>
eighteen-inch-rule, three pair of nut-cracks, a
lemon-squeezer, two candlesticks, a picquet-board,
and the Lord knows what beside.”—Can you form
an idea of it? if you can, do you not think it must
give me pain to reflect, that I myself am useful
for <HI>no</HI> sort of purpose, when a paltry bit of wood
can answer so <HI>many?</HI> but, indeed, whilst it <HI>pretends</HI>
to these exploits, it performs nothing <HI>well;</HI> and
therein I agree with it. So true it is, with regard
to me, what I told you long ago,
<Q><L>“Multa &amp; praeclara minantem</L>
<L>Vivere nee recte, nec suaviter!”</L></Q></P>
<P>WE have a turnpike-bill upon the point of being
brought into the House of Commons: it will con∣vey
you about half the way betwixt Birmingham
and Hales, and from thence to Hagley; but, I trust,
there will be a <HI>left-hand</HI> attraction, which will always
make you deviate from the strait-line.</P>
<P>I SHOULD be ashamed to reflect how much I have
dwelt upon <HI>myself</HI> in this letter, but that I seriously
approve of egotism in letters; and were I <HI>not</HI> to do
so, I should not have any other subject. I have
not a single neighbour, that is either fraught with
politeness, literature, or intelligence; much less
have I a tide of spirits to set my invention afloat:
but the less I am able to amuse <HI>you,</HI> the more desirous
am I of your letters; which afford me the truest en∣tertainment,
<PB N="212" REF="221"/>
even when my spirits are ever so much
depressed.</P>
<P>THAT universal chearfulness which is the lot of
some people, persons that you and I may <HI>envy</HI> at the
same time that we <HI>despise,</HI> is worth all that either
fortune or nature can bestow.</P>

<HEAD>LXXIII. To Mr. GRAVES.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Mar. 28, 1753.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM vexed to find you have no copy of those
verses—I must make a fresh enquiry; and should
they happen to accompany this letter, as I fear they
will <HI>not,</HI> be so good as to assist me all you can in
the way of <HI>hints</HI> and <HI>corrections</HI>—corrections of what
<HI>is,</HI> and hints of what <HI>may be.</HI> I do not reckon much
upon these verses, or the patronage which you men∣tion;
though the Dutchess is a woman of high re∣putation,
and has as much benevolence as any woman
upon earth.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="222"/>
I DO <HI>not</HI> include the design of visiting Bath as a
public place: I have long since given up such
schemes of gaiety and expence. I visit <HI>you</HI> and <HI>Mrs.
Graves;</HI> at the least, I mean to do <HI>so.</HI></P>
<P>INOCULATION is a point on which I never speak
a syllable in the way of <HI>pro</HI> or <HI>con:</HI> I mean, not so
as to influence particulars; for, in the general, I
esteem it both right and salutary; and even <HI>right</HI>
because we <HI>find</HI> it <HI>salutary.</HI></P>
<P>I DO not know whether I could not bear the
<HI>dishonour</HI> of friends or relations better than their <HI>death.</HI>—
It must afford one no small satisfaction to give
them one's affection and assistance under every frailty
to which human nature is exposed; at least, so long
as they are true to friendship. It is Mr. Whistler's
opinion, as well as mine. But Mr.—'s case
is altogether different; and I make no question
that he thinks as you do upon the occasion.</P>
<P>POOR Danvers's death affects me more than you
would perhaps imagine. If you remember, I was
at M—when the scheme of his going abroad was
in agitation. I think how this event must affect
Mrs. T—, whose concern will not be <HI>lessened</HI> by
her long separation from him. I dare say he reckon∣ed
upon his relations here as his <HI>best estate,</HI> what∣ever
he might gain elsewhere; and, no doubt, the
<PB N="214" REF="223"/>
hope of retiring amongst them has been a constant
spur to his diligence.—The event was always un∣certain,
and has proved at last unfortunate; yet, as
Melmoth. says very justly, “The course of human
affairs requires that we should act with vigour upon
very precarious contingencies.”—I desire you would
give me sight of the Latin inscription.</P>
<P>I THINK it was the Gentleman's Magazine in
which I was shewn your verses.</P>
<P>I HAVE a particular and lively idea of your place;
though I do not remember to have seen even such
<HI>parts</HI> of a scene as I have united together in my ima∣gination.
I cannot think otherwise than that the
front-door opens here, the garden-door there, the
stream runs in this place, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<Q>“Hac ibat Simois, haec est Sigeia tellus.”</Q>
<P>THE sight of the place could not impress my ima∣gination
more deeply; though the impression I <HI>am
to</HI> acquire will, hardly leave one line of my present
one remaining. <HI>Cabbage-garden ornée</HI> is very high
burlesque, and affects the improvements of your
friend too nearly.</P>
<P>LET me know in what manner Mrs. Graves and
you are drawn. Be as particular as you please.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="224"/>
I COULD not be clear from your letter whether
you had received the box or not. That, together
with the tallies, lay on the table before me while I
wrote to you last; and went with my letter to Bir∣mingham.—
Pray satisfy me directly whether you
received them.—They are trifles indeed; but, as
they acquit me of my promise, they are virtually
of consequence.</P>
<P>MR. Whistler has not answered a letter which I
sent him above two months ago: nay, I think, a
quarter of a year.</P>
<P>YOU are rich.—I have only to wish the continuance
of your riches, with some diminution of your fatigue.
And yet the most laborious man in the world is,
I am fully assured, more happy than the <HI>laziest.</HI></P>
<P>“THE Rival Brothers” has some of Dr. Young's
affectations; and I question if the moral be absolute∣ly
true—at least, Mr. Addison is in some measure
again it: but, on the whole, I think it a noble
Tragedy; abounding as much with refined senti∣ments
and elevated expressions, as “The Gamester”
and “The Earl of Essex” are deficient in <HI>both.</HI></P>
<P>MY verses are not yet sent to Sir George Lyttelton;
<HI>I</HI> start new difficulties, and cannot make them to
<PB N="216" REF="225"/>
my mind: yet have promised him a copy, and dis∣appointed
him thrice; and can hardly defer it much
longer without great offence.</P>
<P>I HAVE scarce been twenty yards from home this
winter. Last night I visited one of my neighbours;
and what with wine, sitting up late, a perfect flux
of discourse, and a return home through the dark,
found myself <HI>vetrtiginous</HI> before I was aware. Never
did Prior's manly description, “I drank, I liked it
not, &amp;c.” seem so natural to me as it does to-day.
I am absolutely vile in my own sight, and I abhor
myself in dull and ashes. I was <HI>never</HI> so intoxicated
as not to know what I said, or to talk mere non∣sense;
and yet how many things could I wish unsaid
that I let fall last night!</P>
<P>WE are going to add two new bells to our present
set of six; to have a turnpike road from Hagley
to Birmingham, through Hales; and to emerge
a little from our obscurity. I am, dear Sir, with
compliments to Mrs. Graves,</P>

Inscriptions, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>July 15, 1753.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I SEND you my Ode, as I sent it to the Dutchess
some weeks ago. Why I pitched upon one read∣ing
sooner than another, I will not now explain:
nor will I trouble you to make any fresh remarks
upon it at present; only, when you happen to read
it over at your leisure, if any thing occurs to you
that would tend to perfect It, I would beg you oc∣casionally
to make some memorandums. I have not
yet received an answer; but, as I accompanied the
verses with a letter, I suppose I shall receive one
in return. I also added, to fill a blank space in my
paper-book, a poem which I call “The Vista;”
and which you may perhaps recollect: how pro∣perly
I know not, for I had the benefit of no person's
<HI>judgement</HI> or advice.</P>
<P>LORD Dudley made Mr. Dolman a present of a
piece of plate, a large cup, in consideration of his
sister's being at Broom about half a year. There
was on it, one supporter awkwardly enough hold∣ing
up the coronet in his paw, and from the co∣ronet
proceeded a label, with “Amoris ergo Dud∣ley.”
I do not know who was the manager, or
whence he had the inscription; but I think from
<PB N="218" REF="227"/>
Dr. H—. This is <HI>elegant</HI> and <HI>enough.</HI> Nevertheless,
as there may be some convenience in dazzling the
eyes of the people where I dwell, and as <HI>such</HI> eyes
as theirs are net to be dazzled, and hardly <HI>struck,</HI>
by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>legance</HI> alone, I chose the method that was most
<HI>magnificent.</HI>—I wish they are not invidious enough
to say, that <HI>his</HI> arms are engraved there for want of
some of my <HI>own:</HI> so I would not be long before
I remove their notable suggestion.—I have truly so
low an opinion of arms since they became purchasea∣ble
by money, and since the present unlimited use
of them, that, were I to find a coat to my name in
the office which I did not like, I would not use it;
but substitute what was more agreeable: yet some
<HI>sort</HI> of <HI>right</HI> or <HI>claim</HI> is requisite to satisfy one's de∣licacy
with an opinion of <HI>property;</HI> and indeed to
fix one's <HI>choice,</HI> where one has the whole furniture
of the universe for <HI>its</HI> object.—After all, the vulgar
are more struck with arms than any thing; “stupet
in titu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is &amp; imaginibus;” and, I believe, there
were near two hundred people gathered round Lady
Luxborough's landeau at Birmingham, and declaring
her arms to be very <HI>noble,</HI> or otherwise.—I do not,
therefore, chuse to employ a vulgar <HI>mind</HI> about this
matter.—Were you to go to London, I should gladly
solici <HI>you;</HI> or if you have any friend you could write
to in town, to search the office; for really I have
none that I like <HI>for the purpose.</HI> It will not cost
above a couple of shillings.—I will send you a draught
<PB N="219" REF="228"/>
of the lid of my standish when it arrives—for I
really do not know what Mr. Hylton will put upon
it: I find, he consults with Dr. B—, my Lord's phy∣sician.—
“<HI>De</HI> Dudley” would run most abomina∣bly,
and “Baro Dudley” may be authorized by the
frequent practice of Maittaire.—If it is inscribed
“Dudley” <HI>alone,</HI> I can add the rest if I should here∣after
think proper; and I wish it may be so.</P>
<P>MY verses to the Colonel are not yet transcribed.</P>
<P>I THINK the Latin inscription to your brother
very elegant; and I should not care to have any
part of it omitted—I would, by all means, have
this little history of his life perpetuated—“His
saltem, &amp;c.” And were you to put it into Eng∣lish,
it would be too long for an inscription; un∣less
you were, by means of a printed elegy with
notes, or any other such method, to produce the
same effect; and then you might make the epitaph
as short as you pleased.—After all, the <HI>first</HI> method
is perhaps as eligible. When the affair is nearer
a conclusion, I should be glad to be of any service.—
I will think, and write again about it.</P>
<P>AND now, having spoke to such matters as have
been the subject of our late correspondence, I am
at liberty to diversify my letter as I may.—I should
be glad to know in your next, whether you have
<PB N="220" REF="229"/>
heard of late from Mr. Whistler; and whether he
is confined at home as usual by his mother's state
of health. I almost despair of ever seeing him again
at The Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sowes, though there is hardly any plea∣sure
I so much covet as that of surprizing him with
the <HI>alterations</HI> I have <HI>made,</HI> and the <HI>articles</HI> I have
<HI>purchased,</HI> during the five years since he was in Shrop∣shire:
add to this, the several <HI>acquaintances</HI> I have
formed which he would like, and the amusing visits
I could pay hereabouts with freedom.—I do not
know whether you saw Mr. Davenport and his fa∣mily
at Bath this spring. He is laying out his
environs; and I am by appointment to go over the
week after next. He has also a painter at this time
taking views round his house, which is one of the
most magnificent in our county; yet I never leave
home but with reluctance. I really <HI>love</HI> no PLACE
so well; and it is a great favour in me to allot any
one a week of my <HI>summer.</HI>—Add to this, that my
constitution requires nursing; and I am most <HI>happy</HI>
where I am most <HI>free.</HI> It is in vain to say, they <HI>allow</HI>
you all freedom, where you cannot allow it <HI>yourself.</HI>
For this reason, I never more enjoy myself, than I
do at The Grange; and yet this to some may appear
paradoxical.</P>
<P>I YESTERDAY embellished my chalybeate spring.—
The inscription that is <HI>cut</HI> on the stone is as fol∣lows,

<HEAD>LXXV. To Mr. JAGO.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Jan. 29, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM at a loss how to begin this letter.—I will
not, however, after the usual way, give you a
tedious list of <HI>apologies</HI> in the front of it. Some ac∣count
of my long silence you will find dispersed
throughout the letter; and as for what is deficient,
I will depend upon your friendship.</P>
<P>THERE has not been a person here, since you left
me, of whom I could obtain the least intelligence
concerning you. And as an enquiry by the post
was my only obvious method, I do acknowledge my∣self
to blame, notwithstanding all the excuses that I
can make.</P>
<P>AMIDST that conflux of visitants whom I received
this last season, I was hardly once <HI>so</HI> happy as I
<PB N="223" REF="232"/>
was in <HI>your</HI> company: I was the happier in seeing
<HI>you</HI> so; and, if you remember, I took notice at the
time, how little your vivacity was impaired in com∣parison
of my own. If I was <HI>then</HI> but a dull <HI>com∣panion;</HI>
guess whether solitude and winter were likely
to make me a better <HI>correspondent.</HI> That vein of
gaiety and humour, which you were once To partial
as to discover in my letters, will scarce appear there
any more: not even to the eyes of the most partial
friend I have. Should you deny what I assert, and
impute it to a fit of spleen, yet you may <HI>allow</HI> that
it will scarce enliven any letter that I write in <HI>winter.</HI>
Friendship still remains! Friendship, like the root
of some perennial flower, even <HI>then</HI> perhaps gathers
strength in secret, that it may afford a better display
of its colours in the spring.</P>
<P>I DO not pretend this to be an adequate apology.
I know, my dearest friend, that you both <HI>like</HI> to see
and hear from me: it proves, however, that you
have no great <HI>loss</HI> either of my letters or my com∣pany.</P>
<P>I AM, as the phrase is, deeply penetrated by the
civilities of your Mr. Miller. Me toot a short din∣ner
with me once this season, dropping Sir George
at Mr. P—'s. He could not have pleased me bet∣ter.
Here he happened to meet Mr. Lyttelton and
Captain Whood. He afterwards breakfasted here,
<PB N="224" REF="233"/>
and in general seemed glad of every occasion to
bring me the genteelest company. To him I owe
Miss Banks and Lord Temple. Can you think that
Radway now, as well as Harbury, has no attractions
for me? You know me too well; but I have not
truly such a state of health as to dare to be from
home. Friends will say, “you may be as free at
our houses as your own, &amp;c.” and they will <HI>mean</HI>
as they <HI>say;</HI> but if you cannot make <HI>yourself</HI> so,
what is all this to the purpose?</P>
<P>I CANNOT give you a detail of what has passed
with me since I saw you. Lord Dudley, with my∣self,
made one visit to Lord Plymouth's. We met
Mr. and Mrs. Winnington.—We took a trip to Mr.
Vernon's, where we found Mr. Coventry and other
company. The impressions I received from them
would afford subject for <HI>conversation</HI> betwixt you and
me; but I must not assign too much of my paper to
that purpose.</P>
<P>LORD Plymouth's piece of water should have been
a serpentine river. I could give you strong reasons.—
I think my Lord such a character as will make
a reputable figure in life—<HI>beloved</HI> he <HI>is,</HI> and <HI>must</HI>
be at first sight.—Lady Plymouth is the most amiable
of women; and, of all the world, the properest per∣son
that my Lord could have chosen. The plan for
their house I think right; supposing it right to con∣tinue
<PB N="225" REF="234"/>
it where it is. The park is capable of some
considerable beauties. Lord Plymouth has been once
here since, and talks of causing me to come, and de∣sign
for his environs.—I seem to be highly in his
favour.—I hope some time to meet you there.</P>
<P>MY Ode, after an astonishing delay, was presented
to the Dutchess of Somerset. It produced me two
genteel letters from her Grace. I am well satisfied
with the event, for some reasons which I will one
day give you—none of moment.—Soon after this,
Dodsley pressed me to contribute, as amply as I
pleased, to a fourth volume of his Miscellanies. I at
first meant to do so pretty largely; I then changed
my mind, and sent only some little pieces. Part of
these were my own; part Mr. Whistler's, Mr.
Graves's, and some accidental pieces of others, which
I found in my bureau.—I purposed to send some∣thing
of yours too; of <HI>myself,</HI> if I was <HI>hurried;</HI> else,
not without your consent. What I thought of was,
your Linnets. Last week he writes me word, that
the town will now be too much engrossed by the
business of elections; and that he does not proceed
this winter.—So that we shall now, you see, have
time to meet, or write upon the subject.</P>
<P>MR. Graves sent me the inclosed little fable, for
Dodsley, if I approved it.—I made some alterations,
and sent it.—Return it to me, if you please.—It
<PB N="226" REF="235"/>
is pretty; but the inscription must be “To a
Friend.”</P>
<P>SOME correspondence I have had this winter with
Mr. Hylton, about toys and trinkets which he gets
done for me in London. He is by far a better
<HI>friend</HI> and <HI>correspondent</HI> than a <HI>poet.</HI> Should you take
a trip to town, he would be quite <HI>proud</HI> to see you.</P>
<P>I AM now, like the rest of the world, perusing Sir
Charles Grandison—I know not whether that world
<HI>joins</HI> me, in preferring Clarissa. The author wants
the art of <HI>abridgement</HI> in every thing that he has writ∣ten,
yet I am much his admirer.</P>
<P>My dear friend! cherish and preserve your own
vivacity, and let not this phlegmatic epistle impair
it. If occasion offers, call on me for my <HI>own</HI> sake;
and believe you have not alive a more affectionate
friend.</P>

<HEAD>LXXVI. To Mr. GRAVES, on the Alternations of
Pleasure and Pain.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>April 19, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a long, long time, according to the com∣putation
of friendship, since I had the pleasure
of a line from you; and I write chiefly to remind you
of it, not with any hopes of affording you the
amusement of a single minute. In truth, I have not
spirits for it. The severity, the duration, the soli∣tude,
of this winter have well-nigh exhausted them.—
The succession, the regular succession, of pain and
pleasure becomes every day more clear to me. It
begins to seem as ordinary as the course of day and
night. Thus my last summer was the most amusing
I ever saw; my winter the most disagreeable—al∣low
me to except one only: I mean, that ever∣mournful
winter which robbed me of my dearest.
relation. Sometimes this pain and pleasure are con∣trasted
within the compass of a day; sometimes
in different weeks, &amp;c. &amp;c. However, do not think
me superstitious; there is hardly a person that is
<HI>less</HI> so. Yet I am firmly persuaded of the alternation,
either in the mind, or in the events themselves. My
summer, I said before, was highly entertaining; my
winter rendered equally disagreeable, by a long-con∣tinued
squabble amongst our principal parishioners,
<PB N="228" REF="237"/>
and by the death of my best-beloved and the most
accomplished of my relations, M—D—. She risqued
going to London for the sake of finding something
<HI>new;</HI> was seized with the small-pox, and died in all
her bloom.—The natural consequence which we
should draw from observations of this sort is, equa∣nimity; “aequam memento rebus, &amp;c.” and again,
“sperat infestis, metuit secundis, &amp;c.” Enough of
this, which I should not mention but that the fact
itself strikes me continually more and more; and
were I to mark the pleasing and unpleasing parts
of my existence in an almanac, as the Romans did
their <HI>Fasti</HI> and <HI>Nefasti,</HI> I know not if, at the year's
end, the black and white marks would not nearly
balance each other.</P>
<P>I HAVE bought “Hogarth's Analysis:” it is really
entertaining; and has, in some measure, adjusted my
notions with regard to beauty in general. For in∣stance,
were I to draw a shield, I could give you
reasons from hence why the shape was pleasing or
disagreeable. I would have you <HI>borrow</HI> and read
it.</P>
<P>GRANDISON I cannot think equal to Clarissa;
though, were merit in this age to be preferred, the
author of it deserves a bishopric.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="238"/>
JAGO has been fortunate for once; But the value
of his livings must be exaggerated in the news∣papers.</P>
<P>IF Mr. Whistler would give me a visit in the height
of my season this year, I should look upon it as one
of the most pleasing events mat could happen to the
remainder of my life; and I would riot presume to
hope that fate would ever allow me a repetition of
it.</P>
<P>MY love of toys is not quite exhausted—I have
purchased; or rather renovated, some that are both
rich and beautiful, though short of what I meant them.
I have amused myself with designing little ornaments
this winter, some of which may turn to account un∣der
the management of some Birmingham mechanic.—
To atchieve <HI>ease,</HI> in that season, is the most that I
can <HI>hope;</HI> and it is more than I often <HI>obtain.</HI></P>
<P>EXCUSE this worthless letter; which <HI>must</HI> cost you money, as they tell me franks are useless. I could
not avoid some uneasiness upon reflecting how long
you have been silent. Present my best compliments
to Mrs. Graves; and pay a tribute of one single
half-sheet to that affection with which I am ever</P>

<HEAD>LXXVII. To the same, on the Death of Mr.
WHISTLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>June 7, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THE melancholy account of our dear friend
Whistler's death was conveyed to me, at the
same instant, by yours and by his brother's letter.
I have written to his brother this post; though I
am very ill able to write upon the subject, and would
willingly have waved it longer, but for decency.
The triumvirate, which was the greatest happiness
and the greatest pride of my life, is broken! The
fabric of an ingenuous and disinterested friendship
has lost a noble column! yet it may, and <HI>will,</HI> I
trust, endure till one of us be laid as low. In truth,
one can so little satisfy one's self with what we say
upon such sad occasions, that I made three or four
essays before I could <HI>endure</HI> what I had written to his
brother.—Be so good as excuse me to him as well
as you can, and establish me in the good opinion
of him and Mr. Walker.</P>
<P>POOR Mr. Whistler! how do all our little strifes
and bickerments appear to us at this time! yet we
may with comfort reflect, that they were not of a
<HI>sort</HI> that touched the <HI>vitals</HI> of our friendship; and I
may say, that we fondly loved and esteemed each
<PB N="231" REF="240"/>
other, of necessity—“Tales animas <HI>oportuit</HI> esse con∣cordes.”
Poor Mr. Whistler! not a single acquaint∣ance
have I made, not a single picture or curiosity
have I purchased, not a single embellishment have I
given to my place, since he was last here, but I have
had his approbation and his amusement in my eye.
I will assuredly inscribe my larger urn to his memo∣ry;
nor shall I pass it without a pleasing melancho∣ly
during the remainder of my days. We have each
of us received a pleasure from <HI>his</HI> conversation, which
no other conversation can afford us at our present
time of life.</P>
<P>ADIEU! my dear friend! may our remembrance
of the person we have lost be the strong and ever∣lasting
cement of our affection! Assure Mr. John
Whistler of the regard I have for him, upon his <HI>own</HI>
account, as well as his brother's. Write to me;
directly if you have opportunity. Whether you have
or no, believe me to be ever most affectionately yours,</P>

<HEAD>LXXVIII. To the same.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>July 15, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>particulars</HI> relating to our poor friend's de∣parture
occasioned me much concern, and in∣deed
some tears: yet as <HI>those</HI> particulars are what
one covets to hear, and the melancholy which they
produce is never unmixed with pleasure, I think
myself much obliged to you for the care you took
to convey them. It is possible, the letters I wrote
to you and Mr. J. Whistler might appear too tender
from a <HI>mere</HI> friend of the deceased; but there is a
sympathy betwixt friends, which is not always found
amongst relations; nor does <HI>kindred</HI> imply <HI>friendship</HI>
a whit more than <HI>friendship</HI> does <HI>kindred.</HI> It is not
many weeks ago, that I had a bill filed against me
in Chancery by young D—, the only near rela∣tion
I have by the mother's side, and the next in
lineal succession to my share of the Peun's estate.—
Do not let this surprize you—I believe the affair
will be accommodated.—He only wanted to procure
a division of the Harborough estate at a large ex∣pence,
which might be better adjusted without <HI>any;</HI>
in other words, to run his head against a stone-wall,
that he might have a chance of causing it to tumble
upon <HI>me.</HI> Would you consent that I should suffer
him to have the mansion-house at Harborough thrown
into his lot? Were I so to do, I could make it ad∣vantageous
<PB N="233" REF="242"/>
to myself, and the dispute were at an
end; but I have a kind of romantic veneration for
that <HI>place</HI> and <HI>family;</HI> which, if you remember, I
have expressed in one of my best elegies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elegy xv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRAY what will become of our letters to Mr.
Whistler? As I am not conscious of any thing dis∣honourable
in mine (and I am <HI>sure</HI> I may say the
same of yours), methinks I could with that they
might not be destroyed. It is from a few letters
of my own or others alone, accidentally preserved,
that I am able to recollect what I have been doing
since I was born.</P>
<P>I MET, when I was last at Barrels, a surgeon of
Bath, whose name, I think, was Cleland. He knew
your name and place; but, I find, was not personal∣ly
acquainted with you.—I am glad enough to hear
that your place gets into vogue. It is, I think,
what you should <HI>chuse,</HI> upon all accounts. Let the
beauty of the place guide them to the merits of its
<HI>owner.</HI> I have often thought, myself, that were a
person to live at The Leasowes, of more merit than
myself, and a few degrees more worldly prudence,
he could scarce want opportunities to procure his
own advancement. My rural embellishments are per∣haps
more considerable than yours; but then the
vicinity of Bath might occasion you a greater conflux.—
Your unexpensive illuminations please me highly.
<PB N="234" REF="243"/>
I have purposed these many years to purchase a set
of tin-lamps, of about four-pence a-piece, to stick
against trees, and to use upon occasion in my cop∣pice;
or rather in my grove, where some of the
water-falls would not fail to shew delightfully.</P>
<P>You asked me about Jago's preferment. The liv∣ing
<HI>last given</HI> him by the Bishop of Worcester is,
I believe, near an hundred pounds a year. With
this, he has Harbury, of about fifty; and Chesler∣ton,
a sort of chapel of ease, about forty; in the
<HI>whole,</HI> therefore, about a hundred and ninety: but
then he is obliged to keep a curate; and what I think
yet worse is, that he cannot make it <HI>convenient</HI> to
<HI>live</HI> at his new situation, which is a pretty one.</P>
<P>I HAVE had some visitants this season; indeed
as many, and as considerable, as such a sort of sea∣son
could afford me. A Scotch peer called upon
me in his way through Birmingham: his title was
D—. He seemed to have a very clear head, a very
polite and easy manner, and all the refinement of
true taste, <HI>without</HI> the warmth or appetite.—I could
not help thinking him, on many accounts, cha∣racteristic
of the Scottish nation.</P>
<P>WOULD to God I could see you and Mrs. Graves
here this summer! I have the same wish it may be
<PB N="235" REF="244"/>
<HI>my</HI> lot to visit <HI>you</HI> next autumn. Be assured, I <HI>purpose</HI>
it.</P>
<P>I EXPECT Dodsley every week. He will, I am
convinced, be for publishing his Miscellany next win∣ter.
Would Mr. W—, think you, agree, that you
and I should be allowed to publish such of poor Mr.
Whistler's papers there, as we judged were most like∣ly
to do credit to his memory?</P>
<P>ADIEU! dear Mr. Graves. Let us reconcile our
affections to the ordinary events of life; and let us
adopt my friend Jago into our second triumvirate.
I am, however, always, with <HI>peculiar</HI> attachment,
yours,</P>

<P>MY best compliments to Mrs. Graves.</P>
<P>P. S. SINCE I wrote the foregoing, I have had
Mr. Davenport of Davenport-house, with all his
family.—His brother, the clergyman, remembered
you by your picture.—His wife is the finest <HI>person,</HI>
&amp;c. I have seen here, except Lady Aylesbury—in∣genious,
easy-behaved, and of an excellent temper.—
They come to Bath in a fortnight.</P>
<P>SINCE that time, Sir George Lyttelton, Mr. Lyt∣telton,

alterations requisite in my verses, to which I cannot

<HEAD>LXXIX. To the same, on hearing that his Letters to
Mr. WHISTLER were destroyed.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Oct. 23, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT is certainly some argument of a <HI>peculiarity</HI> in
the esteem I bear you, that I feel a readiness to
acquaint you with <HI>more</HI> of my foibles than I care to
trust with any other person. I believe nothing shews
us more plainly either the different <HI>degrees</HI> or <HI>kinds</HI>
of regard that we entertain for our several friends
(I may also add the <HI>difference</HI> of their <HI>characters</HI>),
than the ordinary style and tenor of the letters we
address to them.</P>
<P>I CONFESS to <HI>you,</HI> that I am considerably mortified
by Mr. John W—'s conduct in regard to my letters
to his brother; and, rather than they should have
been so unnecessarily destroyed, would have given
more money than it is allowable for me to mention
with <HI>decency.</HI> I look upon my letters as some of <HI>my</HI>
chef-d'oeuvres; and, could I be supposed to have
the least pretensions to propriety of style or senti∣ment,
<PB N="237" REF="246"/>
I should imagine it must appear, principally,
in my letters to his brother, and one or two more
friends. I considered them as the records of a <HI>friend∣ship</HI>
that will be always <HI>dear</HI> to me, and as the
<HI>history</HI> of my <HI>mind</HI> for these twenty years last past.
The amusement I should have found in the perusal
of them would have been altogether innocent; and
I would gladly have preserved them, if it were only
to explain those which I shall preserve of his bro∣ther's.
Why he should allow either <HI>me</HI> or <HI>them</HI> so
very little weight as not to <HI>consult</HI> me with regard
to them, I can by no means conceive. I suppose
it is not <HI>un-customary</HI> to return them to the surviving
friend. I had no answer to the letter which I wrote
Mr. J. W—. I received a ring from him; but as
I thought it an inadequate memorial of the friend∣ship
which his brother had for me, I gave it to my
servant the moment I received it; at the same time
I have a neat standish, on which I caused the lines
Mr. W—left with it to be inscribed, and which
appears to me a much more agreeable remembrancer.</P>
<P>I HAVE read your new production with pleasure;
and as this letter begins with a confession of foibles,
I will own, that through mere laziness I have sent you
back your copy in which I have made some erase∣ments,
instead of giving you my reasons on which
those erasements were founded. Truth is, it seems
to me to want mighty few variations from what is
<PB N="238" REF="247"/>
now the present text; and that, upon one more pe∣rusal,
you will be able to give it as much perfection
as you mean it to have. And yet, did I suppose
you would insert it in Dodsley's Collection, as I see
no reason you have to the contrary, I would take
any pains about it that you should desire me. I
must beg another copy, at your leisure.</P>
<P>I SHOULD like the inscription you mention upon
a real stone-urn, which you purchase very reasona∣ble
at Bath: but you must not risque it upon the vase
you mention, on any account whatever.</P>
<P>Now I mention Bath, I must acquaint you, that I
have received intelligence from the younger Dod∣fley,
that his brother is now there, and that none of
the papers I sent him are yet <HI>sent to press;</HI> that he
expects his brother home about the fourth or fifth
of November, when he proceeds with his publication.
Possibly you may go to Bath whilst he is there, and,
if so, may chuse to have an interview.</P>
<P>I SHALL send two or three little pieces of my
own, in hopes that you will adjust the reading, and
return them as soon as you conveniently can. All
I can send to-night is this “Ode to Memory.” I
shall in the last place desire your opinion as to the
manner of <HI>placing</HI> what is sent. The first pages of
his Miscellany must be already fixed. I think to
<PB N="239" REF="248"/>
propose ours for the last; but as to the <HI>order,</HI> it will
depend entirely upon you.</P>

company at the table all the time I am writing.</P>

<HEAD>LXXX. To Mr. JAGO.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>June 16, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WERE I to pronounce my sentence upon the
long suspension of our correspondence, I should
impute the blame of it, in almost <HI>equal</HI> measure, to
<HI>yourself</HI> and to <HI>me.</HI> To <HI>you,</HI> for an omission of the
letter you <HI>promised</HI> me when last in town; to me,
for waiting in expectation of it, and for neglecting
to do <HI>justice</HI> to the sentiments of my heart on the
occasion of your late preferment. Great were the
hopes I had indeed conceived, that your increase of
revenue had been accompanied with a place of re∣sidence
which was more <HI>to your mind</HI> than that where
you at present abide; but I do not find by any ac∣counts
that you purpose to leave Harbury: for which,
no doubt, you have reasons which I do not yet pe∣netrate,
but which may demand my assent the mo∣ment
you discover them. I have but little to say
of the life I have led since you received some ac∣count
<PB N="240" REF="249"/>
of me from Mr. Hylton in London. The Win∣ter,
or at least its <HI>ministers,</HI> continued to tyrannize
during the <HI>minority</HI> of Spring; and the Spring has
alike been slow in giving up the reins to Summer.
Of consequence, I seem in a sort of middle state,
betwixt a dull half-animated grub and an insignifi∣cant
loco-motive fly. Neither in the <HI>one</HI> state or
<HI>other</HI> am I of the least importance; but, from the
advances which I have <HI>already</HI> made, you are <HI>some∣what</HI>
the more likely to find me in your garden.
About a fortnight ago I received a line or two from
our intimate acquaintance and school-fellow Mr. Hall.
It was brought me by Sir Edward Boughton's gar∣dener;
a fellow of good taste, to whom Mr. Hall
desired I would cause The Leasowes to be shewn.
I find you have delighted Mrs. Hall by some altera∣tions
which you propose for their environs, and which
they thoroughly resolve to put in execution. When
I come over into Warwickshire, as I hope to do
soon, I shall be very glad to make them a visit in
your company. My spirits, though far from good,
are better in the main than they were in winter,
and on some peculiar days are raised as high as to
<HI>alacrity; very</HI> seldom higher, seldom so high.</P>
<P>You must (from hence at least) take matters in
the order or rather <HI>disorder</HI> in which they occur:
Mr. Miller I saw on Wednesday last in Lady Lyt∣telton's
coach, who stopped two minutes at my gate
<PB N="241" REF="250"/>
on her return from London. I enquired concerning
you; but could gather no intelligence.—Mr. Hylton,
who is now in Warwickshire (if he have not strolled
to London), has been with me several months this
summer. He is adding a room or two to his place,
which lies very near me; and purposes to reside
there as soon as it is finished. The situation is not
void of beauties; but, if you will pardon the vanity,
must veil its bonnet to mine. I have heard of plant∣ing
hollies, pyracanthas, and other berry-bearing
greens, to attract those Blackbirds which you have
so effectually celebrated: it shall be <HI>my</HI> ambition to
plant good neighbours; and, what with Lord Dudley
and his exotics, Mr. Hylton with his fossils, and my∣self
with my <HI>ferme ornée,</HI> is there not some room to ex∣pect
that we may attract the tasters this way? but
first we must take some care to <HI>advertise</HI> them where
their treasures lie.—Another day is passed, and Mr.
Miller, &amp;c. has again been with me, and waked me
out of a sound sleep to breakfast.—He mentions with
what reluctance he <HI>left</HI> a surveyor at Radway, em∣ployed
in taking plans of the field of battle near
Edge-hill. This he purposes to enrich with a number
of anecdotes, gleaned from his neighbourhood; which
must probably render it extremely entertaining: and
surely Edge-hill fight was never more unfortunate to
the nation, than it was lucky for Mr. Miller! He
prints, together with this plan, another sheet of Rad∣way
Castle. I approve his design. He will, by this
<PB N="242" REF="251"/>
means, turn every bank and hillock of his estate there,
if not into <HI>classical,</HI> at least into <HI>historical</HI> ground.</P>
<P>I HAVE done mighty little about my grounds since
last winter. As indolence has on <HI>many</HI> occasions con∣tributed
to <HI>impair</HI> my finances, it is bust just that it
should sometimes contribute to <HI>restore</HI> them. Yet I
am not quite destitute of something new for your
amusement.</P>
<P>OF late I have neither <HI>read</HI> nor <HI>written</HI> a syllable.
What pleated me last was “Hogarth's Analysis.” I
expect Dodsley down every week; and as he will
spend a few days with me, I could wish you were to
meet him. His genius is truly poetical, and his sen∣timents
altogether liberal and ingenuous.</P>
<P>I AM, at present, a surveyor of roads; employed in
repairing my lane to the turnpike. How glad should
I be to meet you, End to shew you its <HI>beauties!</HI> to shew
you Mr. Hylton's new series of coins;—his <HI>designs</HI> as
well as his <HI>performances</HI> at Lappa!—how glad should I
be to see you! yea, I would hardly fail to return with
you to Harbury; were you to add this one obligation.
I left Mr. Miller in doubt whether he would not see me
at Radway some time next week. Evil and caprici∣ous
health (the particulars of which would make a de∣tail
of no importance) destroys all my punctuality,
and bids me promise with▪ <HI>fear.</HI> You, I trust, are
<PB N="243" REF="252"/>
mostly at home; and were you to be at Snitterfield, I
would follow you without reluctance. So, with hopes
to see you shortly either in Warwickshire or Shrop∣shire,
I relinquish the subject.</P>
<P>I HAVE reserved a very melancholy subject for the
last. May you, and Mr. Graves, and myself, stand
firm to support the fabric of friendship, which has lost
a very beautiful column in poor Mr. Whistler! he
died of a sore-throat, which in a few days time turn∣ed
to an inward mortification.—I will say no more
on the occasion: very affecting has it been to me.—
God preserve your life, your happiness, and your
friendships! and may you ever be <HI>assured</HI> of <HI>that</HI> with
which I am, dear Sir,</P>
<CLOSER>Your most affectionate humble servant,
<SIGNED>W. SHENSTONE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>SHALL I beg a line from you, as soon as may be?—
I do, most earnestly.</P>
<P>I AM given to understand that I may expect a
visit this summer from the Bishop of Worcester;
from Lord Ward, Lord Coventry, and Lord Guern∣sey.—It
may be so; but honours of <HI>this sort,</HI> which
would formerly have affected me, perhaps <HI>too</HI> deeply,
have now lost much of their wonted poignancy. Can
<HI>such</HI> persons bear to see the scenes <HI>riant,</HI> and to find
the <HI>owner</HI> gloomy? Let <HI>them,</HI> as they are <HI>able,</HI> make
<PB N="244" REF="253"/>
my circumstances more affluent; and they shall find
the <HI>relection</HI> in <HI>my</HI> face and in <HI>their</HI> reception; but,
as this will never be, it is no compliment to declare,
that an hour or two's interview with you or Mr.
Graves outweighs the arrival of the whole British
Peerage.</P>
<P>SOMETHING else I have to say. Young Pixell last
winter told me, that the organist of Worcester had
set your Ode (The Blackbirds) to music; that he
<HI>liked</HI> the musick; and that he would sing it next
evening at the Birmingham concert. I have not
heard him mention it <HI>since,</HI> and I <HI>forgot</HI> to enquire;
but, if you happen to have the notes, I should be
glad if you would inclose them for me.</P>
<P>I HAVE been of late much bent upon the encrease
of <HI>horns</HI> in this neighbourhood.—Do not interpret
me <HI>perversely;</HI> I mean French-horns only. My Lord
Dudley has had a person to teach two of his ser∣vants—
nothing—at my instigation; but your old ac∣quaintance
Maurice, <HI>who lives at the corner of my cop∣pice,</HI>
will exceed them in a week by means of a good
ear. I have borrowed a horn for him. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LXXXI. To C—W—, Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. W—,
<DATE>July 6, 1754.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOU do me justice in believing that I am truly
sorry you have not been well. A degree or
two of regularity more than what you have already
will, I fancy, restore your health, and my satisfaction;
and I beg you will afford me the earliest account of
your recovery.</P>
<P>I CONSIDERED Matter W—'s visit as an absolute
engagement, and remained at home in constant ex∣pection
of him for a fortnight together.—I am,
however, not sorry, for his own sake, that he is gone
to Oxford, especially as you seem to have an as∣surance
of its proving advantageous. Pray assure
him of my earnest wishes for his happiness, and that
The Leasowes will be always at his service, whenever,
through the sickleness of human nature, he thinks
proper to give up a Muse for a Water-nymph.</P>
<P>I EXPECT Mr. Hylton daily.—He was last week
in London, and is now, I believe, at Coventry.—He
will probably visit you before he comes into this
country.—He talked of it when he left me.—I am
obliged to be brief.</P>
<P>POST-WOMAN waits for me, “multa gemens.”
Dodsley is the man for your purpose—He has, with
<PB N="246" REF="255"/>
good genius, a liberal turn of mind.—I expect him
to spend a few days here every week.—I will, if he
returns through Warwickshire, occasion him to call
upon you; but you know he is often lame with the
gout, and will hardly be able to make any long di∣gression.</P>
<P>YOUR case is exactly mine.—You say, you cannot
bear wrongs with patience, but you can sleep and
<HI>forget</HI> them.—So can I—so do I.—Did I never tell
you (if not, I do so now) that indolence will, in a
thousand instances, give one all the advantages of
philosophy? and pray, if you call me lazy any more,
take care that you do not use an expression by way
of disparagement, which I consider as the highest
honour. I am a fool, however, for discovering my
secret. What a number of compliments might you
have made me unwittingly!</P>
<Q><L>“Tacitus pasci si posset corvus, haberet</L>

<P>HAD I time, I could comfort you under your ill∣usage,

<HEAD>LXXXII. To Mr. JAGO, on their Contribution to
DODSLEY'S Miscellanies.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Jan. 22, 1755.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sure you must be puzzled how to account
for my silence, after the honour you have done
me by your verses, and the request you made that
I would <HI>write.</HI>—I am also as much at a loss how to
give a proper weight to my apology. To say I have
been ill, would perhaps imply too much; when I
would only allude to that state of heavinese and de∣jection
which is so frequently my lot at this time of
the year; and which renders me both <HI>averse</HI> to wri∣ting,
and utterly dissatisfied with every thing that I
<HI>do</HI> write.</P>
<P>IF at any time my head grew a little less confused
than ordinary, I was obliged to devote my attention
to the affair in which I had so <HI>foolishly</HI> involved my∣self
with Dodsley. You are unable to conceive what
vexation it has given me: I could not endure, to
<HI>disappoint</HI> him: of constquence, it has been my lot
to study the delicacies of <HI>poetry</HI> when my brain was
not sufficient to indite a piece of common prose; but
as the <HI>mouse</HI> (by which I mean my <HI>own</HI> performances)
will so soon make its ridiculous appearance, it were
totally impolitic in me to expatiate on the labours
of the <HI>mountain.</HI>—The first letter I received from you
<PB N="248" REF="257"/>
left me greatly dissatisfied. I was then to send D—
my <HI>final</HI> instructions in a post or two.—You took lit∣tle
notice of any query I made; and intimated a dis∣approbation,
which agreed <HI>too well</HI> with my own
internal sentiments.—I knew not but you were <HI>angry</HI>
at the <HI>liberties</HI> I had taken; though I could have
suppressed any single paper which I had then convey∣ed
to London.—Little did I <HI>then</HI> imagine that it was
in my power to have protracted the affair till <HI>now.</HI>
Had that been the case, I should have troubled you
with repeated embassies; for I abhor the tediousness
of the post, and my servants do little at this time
of the year that is of more importance than their
master's poetry.</P>
<P>YOUR next letter convinced me that you had
taken no offence; and so far I was happy: but then
I wanted to have your Goldfinches as correct as
your Blackbirds; there were <HI>some</HI> things I wished
you to alter; and others in regard to which I was
desirous to speak my <HI>sentiments.</HI> Add to this, my
own <HI>verses,</HI> with which I was infinitely <HI>more</HI> dissatis∣fied.
Why then did I not write?—The true reason
was, that I was pressed by D—to send conclusions
every post; and though I have had all this leisure
(as it <HI>happens</HI>) since you wrote, I never could <HI>depend</HI>
upon more than the space of a day or two. Be∣sides,
criticisms in the way of letter are extremely
tedious and dissatisfactory; insomuch, that I am
<PB N="249" REF="258"/>
thoroughly determined never to print any thing for
the future, unless I have the company of my friends
when i send to the press. Hurried as I then was, I
sent up your two copies, and what I proposed for him
of my own, with a kind of <HI>discretionary</HI> power to se∣lect
the best readings. How you would approve of
this measure I knew not; but I had this to plead in
my behalf, that D—was a person of taste <HI>himself;</HI>
that he had, as I imagined, many learned friends to
assist him; that his <HI>interest</HI> was concerned in the per∣fection
of his Miscellany; and that I submitted my
own pieces to the same judgement.</P>
<P>AFTER all, I am but indifferently satisfied with the
present state of these contributions. D—writes
just so much as he deems <HI>nccessary</HI> in the way of
business, and passes by a thousand points in my letters,
which deserve an answer. His last acquaints me,
that he has spent a whole day in the arrangement
of what I have sent him; and that he purposes to
send me <HI>proof-sheets</HI> before the close of this week,
desiring I would send them back by the return of
the post. Whether they arrive on Saturday or on
Monday, I can keep them till the Thursday follow∣ing.</P>
<P>AND this brings me, in the last place, to the main
purpose of this letter.—It is a request on which I
lay great stress; and which you must not refuse me
<PB N="250" REF="259"/>
upon almost any consideration.—I beg, in short, that
you would promise me the favour of your company
on Monday (or even Tuesday) next, if possible; and
let us jointly fix the readings of <HI>your</HI> pieces, of my
<HI>even,</HI> and those of our common <HI>friends.</HI>—You will
immediately comprehend the <HI>expediency of this; now,
in particular, that our names are to appear.</HI> Some
alterations I think <HI>necessary</HI> in your Goldfinches, and
there are two or three stanzas which I think you
might improve.—Nevertheless, I will not pretend
that this journey is so <HI>requisite</HI> upon your <HI>own</HI> ac∣count
as <HI>mine;</HI> and will recommend it upon no other
footing than the pleasure you will receive by the
obligation which you will confer.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT to have concluded here; but, as an
envelope is now become altogether necessary, have
a temptation to proceed which I did not see before.</P>
<P>IT is now become Friday the twenty-fourth of
January. The packets I send, and the request that
I make upon so <HI>little</HI> warning, will, at first, astonish
you.—Unforeseen interruptions would not suffer me
to dispatch my courier sooner.—What then remains,
but that I endeavour to adjust this affair agreeably
to its <HI>present</HI> circumstances?</P>
<P>You will readily conceive, from what you observe
in my packers, how desireable your company is to
<PB N="250" REF="260"/>
me at this juncture. Supposing it then in your <HI>power</HI>
to come over on Monday, Tuesday, or even Wed∣nesday,
I am inclined to believe you <HI>will.</HI> Sup∣posing
it <HI>not</HI> so, I can foresee you will not have lei∣sure
to satisfy my queries by the return of the
bearer: and what I would <HI>next</HI> propose is, that you
would either suffer me to send again to you betwixt
this time and Thursday next; or that you would
yourself dispatch a purpose-messenger, and allow me
to pay for his journey.—In either of these <HI>latter</HI>
cases, I am sure you so well know the nature of my
present irresolution, that you will endeavour to afford
me all the assistance you are able.</P>
<P>ADIEU! my dear friend! and depend upon my
best services on every poslible occasion.</P>
<CLOSER>I am ever your most affectionate
and most obedient servant,
<SIGNED>W. SHENSTONE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>LXXXIII. To the same, on the same Subject.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Feb. 22 1755.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED a letter from Dodsley, dated the
fifteenth of February; informing me that you
were then in town, had been with him, and left your
<PB N="252" REF="261"/>
directions whither he might send you a set of Mis∣cellanies.</P>
<P>FEBRUARY the twentieth, and not <HI>before,</HI> arrived
young H—with your letter; very obligingly in∣tended
to give me previous notice of your journey;
but which, by the iniquity of chance, tended only
to acquaint me with an opportunity which I had <HI>lost.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is nothing could have been so fortunate
as your journey to London, had Mr. H—thought
proper to bring your letter in due time.—What ex∣cuse
he made for his neglect, or whether he made
any, I have really forgot. This I know, that the
whole affair has been unlucky. There has been
abundant time for consultation, and a perfect series
of opportunities of which we have not been suffered
to avail ourselves.—It is now three weeks or a month
since I corrected the proof-sheets; was so hurried in
the doing of it that I scarce knew what I wrote;
and yet, in spite of all this hurry, the book is hither∣to
unpublished. <HI>Now,</HI> indeed, it must be much too
late for alterations, as D—has given me some room
to expect a book this very day—I know but little
what he has done in consequence of that discretiona∣ry
power with which I, through haste, was obliged
to intrust him: but in what I have done <HI>myself,</HI> you
may expect to find all the effects of <HI>dulness precipi∣tated.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="262"/>
IT is now the twenty-third of February, and I
have received no fresh account of our friend Dod∣sley's
proceedings; nor am I able to <HI>trace</HI> them, as
I expected, in the news-papers.</P>
<P>As to your share of this Miscellany, you can have
no cause to be dislatisfied.—After what manner he
has thought proper to print Lady L—'s verses, I am
a good deal uncertain; but I apprehend he has not
followed her own readings very precisely, and that
the blame thereof is to be thrown upon me.—I am
concerned for the memory of my poor friend Whist∣ler,
and regret that his <HI>better</HI> pieces did not fall into
my hands. I think that Dodsley, however, would
have done him greater justice, had he inserted his
translation of “Horace and Lydia.” It is true, the
translations of that Ode are out of number; but <HI>his,</HI>
if I mistake not, had many beauties of its own.—I
do not know whether I ever hinted to you, that <HI>his</HI>
genius and that of Ovid were apparently congenial.—Had
he cultivated his with equal care, perhaps
the similitude had been as obvious as that of your
twin-daughters.—Mr. Graves has one small well∣polished
gem in this collection; his verses upon Me∣dals.—
His little conjugal Love-song is also natural
and easy.—I <HI>told</HI> you what I least disliked of my <HI>own</HI>
puerilities.—If the printing of my Rural Inscriptions
be <HI>invidious,</HI> it was altogether owing to the instiga∣tion
<PB N="254" REF="263"/>
of Sir G—L—. There are four or five little
matters, which, if he have printed with my name,
incorrect as they are, I shall be utterly disconsolate;
at least, till I get sight of a succeeding impression.—For
though I am not much solicitous about a poetical
reputation (and indeed it is of little importance to so
<HI>domestic</HI> an animal as myself), yet I could ill endure
to pass for an affected, powerless <HI>pretender.</HI></P>
<P>AND now no more upon the subjest.—I have no∣thing
to add that can the least amuse you.—You,
who have been conversant with all the busy and the
splendid scenes of life, can want no materials to
make a letter entertaining.—Indeed you never <HI>did.</HI>—I
shall be glad, however, to receive a <HI>long</HI> one,
upon what subjects you please.</P>
<P>I HAVE passed a very dull and unamusive winter;
my health indeed rather better than I experienced
it last year; but my head <HI>as</HI> confused, and my spirits
<HI>as</HI> low. I live in hopes of an opportunity of seeing
you at Harbury; but I begin now to receive visits
as an honest beggar does an alms, with my humblest
thanks for the favour, and with a despair of making
a return.</P>

more <HI>resolution:</HI> inclination I never want; being at
all times with singular affection yours,</P>

<HEAD>LXXXIV. To the same.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>April 3, 1755.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE so long expected the favour of a few
lines from you, that I begin at last to question
whether you received the letter I sent you. It was
inclosed in one to Mr. M—, whom I requested to
further it with all convenient expedition. I am nei∣ther
able to recollecd the whole contents of it; nor
indeed, if I <HI>were,</HI> could I endure the thoughts of
transcribing them. The chief intention of it, how∣ever,
was to acquaint you of Mr. H—'s unhappy
delay in the delivery of that letter with which you
favoured me from Radway.</P>
<P>WHAT confirms me in a suspicion that my last let∣ter
miscarried is, that Mr. Wren lately acquainted
me of your being at Wroxall upon business, and of
your making some slight mention of Mr. Dodsley's
publication, without intimating that you discovered
any design you had of writing to me. This is mere
preamble and stuff: implying nothing more than
the desire I have to <HI>hear</HI> from you, when it ought
also to express how impatiently I long to <HI>see</HI> you.
Worldly concerns and my winterly state of health
have detained me at home for these many months
past: worldly concerns may have confined you like∣wise;
but as your health and spirits are universally
<PB N="256" REF="265"/>
better than mine, and as you have much less dislike
to travelling than myself, I would hope that my ab∣sence
from Harbury will never cause you to <HI>neglect</HI>
any <HI>opportunity</HI> of coming hither. For my own part,
I have been meditating upon a visit to you all this
winter; and do, at this time, resolve most strenuously
to perform it before June. But the many such
schemes of pleasure in which I have been disappoint∣ed
are a sort of check upon my expressions, and
make me promise with <HI>fear.</HI> As to Dodsley's per∣formance,
which you must have received before this
time, I will make no observations till I have the
pleasure of seeing you: and yet there are many points
I would discuss, and many accounts I want to give
you. So many indeed, that they would furnish out
perhaps a superficial drawling letter; but would
serve infinitely better for conversation, with the book
before us. The volume, I am told, is well received
in town; though political intellgience must engross
much of its present attention.</P>
<P>MR. HYLTON is in my neighbourhood, and upon
the point of settling at his farm. Could you pos∣sibly
spend a week with us, we would try to make
it agreeable. At all events, I beg to hear from you;
and that, not merely as it will afford me great plea∣sure,
but as, at the same time, it will ease me of
some solicitude. I will not make this a long let∣ter,
though I wish to receive a long one in return;
<PB N="257" REF="266"/>
having a head very little qualified to add any thing
that may amuse you, though a heart very sincerely

<P>THOUGH the silence that has prevailed for so
long a time betwixt us be, I fear, to be placed
to <HI>my</HI> account, yet do I by no means imagine that
you will desire me to fill half this letter with apo∣logies.
Suffice it, that I owe all the world, at this
time, either letters, visits, or money: yet that my
<HI>heart</HI> is as well disposed in each of these respects, as
that of any one person who is insolvent. The regard
indeed that I owe to you has been a troublesome in∣mate
within my bosom for some time past; making
daily remonstrances against the injustice which I have
done it; and urging me strenuously to take horse,
and make my <HI>personal</HI> apologies at Harbury.—
I return you many thanks for Mr. S—'s company,
and for the sight of the manuscript which he shewed
me. Alas! that I cannot spare money to drain and
to improve my lands, or to put almost any part of
his excellent rules in execution! and yet that Mr.
<PB N="258" REF="267"/>
Childe of Kinlett (hearing my place always termed
<HI>a farm)</HI> should come expecting to find all things
managed here according to the perfection of <HI>husbandry!</HI>
As little <HI>can</HI> I pretend to improve Mr. S—'s trea∣tise,
as his treatise <HI>will</HI> my farm: no farther at <HI>most,</HI>
than in what regards the <HI>stile,</HI> or <HI>plan</HI> of his per∣formance.
Yet could I wish to see both <HI>it</HI> and <HI>him</HI>
again before he prints it; wishing him all the suc∣cess
which his very <HI>endeavour</HI> deserves. Assuredly
the present is not the <HI>time</HI> for his publication: more
<HI>immediate</HI> remedies than can be derived from agricul∣ture
are become absolutely requisite to relieve the
sufferings of this nation.—I should be extremely well-pleased
to visit you at Harbury, but cannot even pro∣pose
to Myself that happiness at <HI>present;</HI> and were
I even to <HI>promise,</HI> have but too much reason to know
the <HI>uncertainty</HI> of my <HI>performance.</HI> Yet am I sensible
enough we <HI>ought to meet,</HI> if we purpose that what we
print should have the advantage of our mutual criti∣cisms.
Let me then <HI>conjure</HI> you to come over, at
your convenience, for a few days, that we may agree
at least upon some <HI>general</HI> points, and make no worse

LET me acquaint you while I remember, that there
is at this time a Mr. Duncombe and his son, clergy∣men,
that are publishing a new translation of Horace.
Whatever you may think of their <HI>success,</HI> after <HI>Francis,</HI>
I believe I may pronounce them men of real merit,
and in no wise destitute of learning or genius. They
have requested me to communicate any <HI>version</HI> or
<HI>imitation</HI> that I can furnish, either of my own or of
any friends; wherefore, if you <HI>have</HI> any thing of
this sort, I should be glad if you would put it in my
power to oblige them. The son has an “Ode to
Health” in the fourth volume of Dodsley's Mis∣cellany.</P>
<P>UNDER the head of intelligence, I have mighty
little to convey.—The house at Hagley is in a man∣ner
finished, so far as concerns the shell; and wants
nothing besides a portico to be as compleat as most
in England.—Pray remember me to Mr. Talbot,
Mr. Miller, and Mr. Holbeach; should they call
upon me next year, they will find my place better
worth their notice.</P>

<HEAD>LXXXVI. To Mr. GRAVES, with some Account of
Politics and Poetry.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>April 4, 1755.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be harrassed with my letters till you
condemn my excessive leisure as loudly as I
have lamented that you should ever feel the <HI>want</HI> of
it. Nor is it a point so easily decided <HI>which</HI> of us
may be the greater <HI>sufferer;</HI> you through my <HI>officious∣ness,</HI>
or I by your long <HI>silence.</HI> Yet the partiality
which you have ever shewn me will, I think, dispose
you to receive my letters more patiently than it is
in my power to sustain the loss of <HI>yours.</HI> After all,
I should not write at present, but that the Miscel∣lanies
with which Dodsley compliments us arrived
last week at The Leasowes. I desire therefore you
would acquaint ice, whether the sett that he means
for you should remain here till your arrival; or if
you chuse that I should send it by the Birmingham-stage
to Bath. Having made this enquiry, I was
thinking to conclude; but cannot reconcile myself
to the <HI>novelty</HI> of sending <HI>you</HI> three empty pages. The
Parliament will rise too soon for the publication
of my “Rural Elegance;” and having performed
my promise to Dodsley, I think no more about such
<HI>laurels</HI> as the <HI>public</HI> can bestow upon me, but am
giving all my attention to such as I can purchase
of my nursery-man. I wish, however, that the vo∣lume
<PB N="261" REF="270"/>
may recompence Dodsley for his trouble: I may
also add, for his ingenuity, and for his politeness in
giving each of us a compleat sett. They are elegant∣ly
bound, and all as much alike as posstble.</P>
<P>THE present crisis of state-affairs does not seem to
favour his publication, as the attention of the pub∣lic
must lean greatly to that quarter. I saw a letter
from Sir William M—(who corresponds with
Lady Luxborough), which placed the struggles of the
ministry in a clearer light than they had yet appear∣ed
to me. It seems that persons of all denomina∣tions
are for carrying on the war with vigour; and
the King's application for a Vote of Credit was re∣ceived
with general approbation. The zeal of the
Parliament was indeed so remarkable on this occa∣sion,
that, instead of the 600, 000 <HI>l.</HI> at first intended,
it was thought proper to propose a million. But
the services were ascertained, and the Chancellor of
the Exchequer made accountable for the application
of it. The augmentation of the fleet with 20,000
seamen; the raising, 5000 marines on a plan of di∣viding
them into small companies, which will render
them more useful both by sea and land; the com∣pletion
and reinforcement of the Irish regiments;
are the uses to which this million is to be appro∣priated.
Mr. Fox and his land-war-party sat mute,
whist Mr. Legge with great openness and perspicuity
explained the present schemes; as they were calcu∣lated
<PB N="262" REF="271"/>
to exert our whole strength at sea, and, if pos∣sible,
no where else. Mr. Dodington, who, it seems,
has not spoke of many years, charmed every body.
His wit did not only entertain, but animate and af∣fect
his hearers. “<HI>It were better,</HI> he said, <HI>than lose
the dominion of the Ocean, that the Ocean should over∣whelm
us: for what Briton could wish to leave a pos∣terity
crawling upon this island, only to feel the ty∣ranny,
and swell the victories, of France?”</HI> It seems,
F—, in his opposition to the Duke of Newcastle, is
supported by the Duke of Cumberland, his army,
and the Scotch: that the ministry (or the D. of N—'s
party) seem not displeased with a prospect of uniting
with the Tories, who now hold the balance; and it
seems the Tories, by Sir William's letter, are as
little displeased to unite with the Ministry.</P>
<P>You will guess that good part of this political ac∣count
is <HI>transcribed;</HI> and you will guess aright. I
had some thoughts that it might amuse you, and had
no occasion to use other expressions.—Let me now,
once more, return to the futile objects of my <HI>own</HI>
amusement. The impression upon this letter will
be taken from my new real. The motto that I have
pitched upon is, SVP<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>REST MEMORIA: though I yet
retain some hanke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ing after the single word PRAE∣TERITIS.
Probably this, however, is not the last
seal that I shall cause this man to cut in steel. The
altar is not yet finished: ANTE OMNIA MVSAE; but
<PB N="263" REF="272"/>
it does not quite satisfy me.—I will inclose the two
last letters I received from Mr. Dodsley; but you
must not think I build too much upon any compli∣ment
which he there makes me.—It is true, I think
him a very sincere man; but he cannot have been
conversant so long with modern-writers, but he
must conjecture, when their piece is published, that
they a little hunger for applause. I am now uncer∣tain
whether you will receive a letter from him; as
he has, unaccountably I think, sent your books <HI>hither,</HI>
and not to Bath. I am, however, fully satisfied,
that your first and last pieces, more <HI>especially,</HI> do
credit to his collection, and must please all persons
of taste.</P>
<P>I DESIRE my best respects to Mrs. Graves, who
will be pleased to see the affection that subsists be∣twixt
you perpetuated. She will also feel some satis∣faction
in the professions of friendship that are made
you by your most affectionate and faithful humble

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
From Mr. Baskerville's,
Birmingham, <DATE>July 27, 1756.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT were needless for me to recommend to you a
person whom you so truly esteem as Mr. Dodsley;
and from whom you will gladly receive a visit, not
more upon <HI>my</HI> account, than upon <HI>his</HI> and your <HI>own.</HI>—
All I beg is, that, considering the shortness of his
time at Bath, you will be acquainted with him at
first sight; which, I think, should ever be a maxim
with persons of genius and humanity.—He has made
a few days extremely agreeable to me at The Lea∣sowes; has been shewing me his new Tragedy,
which I wished you also might peruse. If I be not
unaccountably imposed upon by my friendship for
the writer, the extraordinary merit of this perform∣ance
is altogether unquestionable.—I will not inform
you through what hands it has passed in town; be∣cause
I would have you communicate your sentiments
to him with entire freedom, being assured the de∣licacy
of them may <HI>yet</HI> be of service, and that the
openness with which you communicate them will be
infinitely pleasing to Mr. Dodsley. He has done me
the honour to ask me for an epilogue:—I <HI>wish,</HI> but
<HI>fear</HI> to undertake it.—Should any lucky hint occur
to <HI>you,</HI> I well know how much you are able to ma∣nage
<PB N="265" REF="274"/>
it to advantage. In that case, I would beg a
line from you the first opportunity.—What talk I of
a line from you, who am at this very time many letters
and apologies in your debt! but I cannot add many
syllables to the letter I am writing—I will write
again in a few days. Mean time, my compliments
to Mrs. Graves; and remember, that Mr. Dodsley
and you become well acquainted at first sight.</P>

<HEAD>LXXXVIII. To the same, on Mr. DODSLEY and his
Works.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr-Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Mar. 7, 1757▪</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE passed a very dull and unamusive win∣ter
here—the worse, for being neither <HI>disposed</HI> nor
<HI>qualified</HI> to keep up a correspondence with my friends:
with <HI>you,</HI> among the <HI>chief;</HI> and yet it is upon you
that I must depend to make up my deficiencies with
Mr. Dodsley.—The poor man has been afflicted with
the most <HI>lasting</HI> fit of the gout he ever underwent
before.—His patience, on these occasions, is inimita∣ble.—
His excursion to the <HI>Regions of Terror and Pity</HI>
is not the only instance of his ability to compose verses
in the midst of pain. When he sent me a copy of it,
<PB N="266" REF="275"/>
he let me know, that he had transmitted another to
yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the same post: I should be glad to receive
your remarks upon it, ere I communicate my own. I
have, for some weeks past, found my head so terribly
confused, that it has been with difficulty I could
<HI>think</HI> or <HI>express</HI> myself on the most superficial topic.
I hope, in a little time, to be able to examine it
more attentively than I can at present: yet, in the
mean while, must acknowledge, that I think his sub∣ject
capable of furnishing extraordinary beauties for
an Ode: and <HI>such,</HI> I think, he should <HI>call</HI> it; drop∣ping
the narrative parts and the connexions as much
as possible. I cannot wish him to print it without
very <HI>material</HI> alterations, and what would occasion
almost the same trouble as it would require to <HI>new∣write</HI>
it. I do not mean this as a condemnation of
what he has already done, so much as a proof of
my opinion how much he will be able to improve it.
<HI>After all,</HI> it will scarce affect me half so much as
his Tragedy. He is so <HI>honest</HI> a man, that the work
he has to give the world is much better than the
specimen: or, to borrow an idea from <HI>my situation,</HI>
the grain that he has to deliver will prove much bet∣ter
than the sample. It is with shame I acknowledge
I have not yet sent him his epilogue; and I feel the
greater comp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nction of mind upon this score, as it
is possible he may impute my neglect to Garrick's
refusal of his play. This weighs nothing with you
or me; a thousand motives may affect a Manager,
<PB N="267" REF="276"/>
that have little or nothing to do with the merit of
the performance; yet he may so far thank Mr. Gar∣rick,
that whatever his refusal takes from the <HI>re∣putation</HI>
of his Tragedy, it will, through Dodsley's
industry, add apparently to its value. I have not
yet been able to satisfy myself with every part of your
epilogue, and must either omit sending it at present,
or must send him an imperfect copy. If you write
to him, let me beg you to give the most favourable
account you <HI>can</HI> of me.</P>
<P>SOMEBODY acquainted me (I think it was Mr.
Talbot) that your old friend Ballard had bequeath∣ed
you his coins for a legacy. I was truly glad to
hear it; but have wondered since, that you never
once informed me of so considerable an acquisition.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER a poem of yours, called—, upon
the present taste in gardening; which you will not
wonder if my late employments make me wish once
more to see. Be so kind as to send me a copy of
this, as well as of any other little pieces that you
have in your bureau. Some of yours deserve a bet∣ter
place than what is assigned them in the Maga∣zine.
In particular, I remember that upon Enigmas,
and Mopsy. Be assured, I will make no <HI>use</HI> of <HI>any</HI>
without your previous consent. You know, I sup∣pose,
that Dodsley's other Miscellanies do not ap∣pear
before next winter.—I received from him, to∣gether
<PB N="268" REF="277"/>
with his Ode, a few Elegies published by Mr.
Whitehead. They are, I think, worth your perusal;
and designed by my worthy friend to excite my emu∣lation.—
Alas! that I am so ill able to deserve the
encouragements which I receive from him!</P>
<P>My neighbour Baskerville, at the close of this
month, publishes his fine edition of Virgil. It will,
for <HI>type</HI> and <HI>paper,</HI> be a perfect curiosity. He follows
the Cambridge edition.</P>
<P>WHAT think you of their management in regard
to Mr. Byng? I cannot help thinking the King
should <HI>pardon</HI> him. The Court-martial, by acquit∣ting
him of cowardice or disaffection, have left no
<HI>motive</HI> for his <HI>negligence,</HI> beside an <HI>error of his judge∣ment:</HI>
for we <HI>cannot</HI> impute it to <HI>supineness, indifference,</HI>
or <HI>inattention.</HI> And then to sentence a man for er∣ror,
is to expect infallibility. That twelfth article
of war is most undoubtedly ill-expressed.—Pray do
not forget my best respects to Mrs. Graves.—Let
me hear from you soon, and believe me ever yours,</P>

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes▪
<DATE>April 8, 1757.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT remarks I had to make upon our friend
Dodsley's Ode, I sent him the last post.
I would gladly have occasioned them to pass by
Claverton; but, having delayed them so long, I was
impatient to convince him that I had not <HI>wholly</HI> dis∣regarded
his request. They are indeed pretty co∣pious:
and yet I have reserved to myself the pri∣vilege
of re-criticising when I see his altered copy.
I recommended to him the addition which you pro∣posed,
and some others; and if he will but take the
pains that I have chalked out for him, I doubt not
that he will render it an excellent Ode, though he
may not find it a very <HI>popular</HI> one. I have also sent
him a copy of our epilogue, not much different from
what you saw; to these I added my little Ode on
Lady Luxborough's furnishing her library, and Perry's
Verses upon the Malvern-waters. At the close of
these last, there appears (with Perry's approbation), a
short address to Dr. Wall of Worcester; a very eminent
physician, and the great patron of this mineral, who
has promoted a subscription in the county towards
<HI>building,</HI> near this well, for the accommodation of
strangers.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="279"/>
I PURPOSE also to give Dodsley the little Ode I
inclose; and would beg the favour of you to advise
me concerning the additional stanzas, to fix the read∣ings
in the rest, and to return me the copy.</P>
<P>I COME now to analyze your remark on Ballard's
legacy; which is indeed very ingenious, but will
scarce bear examination: nor do I think that you
rather wish to have <HI>found</HI> that set of medals, than to
have them <HI>given</HI> you by a deceased friend. Assured∣ly,
if we do not allow pleasure to be <HI>predominant</HI> in
this kind of melancholy, we destroy the foundation
of all tragic or elegiac writings; Melpomene has no
place amongst the Muses; and the pains that we
have taken with our friend Dodsley's pensive Ode
have been employed to no purpose. But you want
not these pedantic flourishes, and are wholly of my
mind.</P>
<P>MARTIN'S Magazine is, I believe, pretty obscure;
and I wonder where you got a sight of it. It was,
however, fortunate enough for <HI>me</HI> that you gave no
copy of “James Dawson.” I never yet saw your
verses <HI>on that Grotto,</HI> or from <HI>Phaedrus,</HI> and I want to
see your W—once more, concerning which you are
silent. Your “Pepper-box” and “Mopsy” might,
I think, appear in Dodsley's Miscellany, either <HI>with</HI>
or <HI>without</HI> your name. I also want a copy of your
<PB N="271" REF="280"/>
verses upon Riddles; and whenever you have a lei∣sure
hour, should be glad if you would look them out
and send them.</P>
<P>Go, and think yourself an happy man; at least,
if your children be recovered, as I am inclined to
think they are: and give my service to Mrs. Graves,
for the happiness that she occasions you; of which I
cannot but partake, being, with constant and sincere

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,

<P>DO you know my hand-writing?—It is really
such a length of time since you had demands
upon me for letters, that I am hardly able to enu∣merate
the several causes of my neglect. <HI>This</HI> I
know, that scarce a day has passed, during this in∣terval
of silence, in which I have not <HI>remembered</HI> you
with the most affectionate esteem.—I <HI>hope</HI> you cor∣respond
with our friend Dodsley; and that it is not
altogether disagreeable to you, to find he is printing
some of your verses. He has many, alas! <HI>too</HI> many,
of mine; which I suffered him to take away in
summer, and which the state of my winter health and
spirits renders me but ill able to revise. I believe,
<PB N="272" REF="281"/>
I am, even now, the principal cause that his two
volumes remain yet unpublished; nor can I express
the pain it gives me, to be thus detrimental to his
interests, and to delay the publication of so much
better pieces than my own. I am also dissatisfied
upon <HI>another score:</HI> I mean, that I have been wanting
to myself, in not asking the benefit of your advice;
which I have heretofore experienced to be at once
so <HI>comfortable</HI> and so <HI>advantageous;</HI> but although the
scheme was projected in summer, the business of cor∣rection
was (by <HI>me</HI> at least) deferred till winter, and
then I had neither spirits to <HI>correct</HI> or to <HI>correspond.</HI></P>
<P>I AM really as much obliged to you for the pains
which yon took on my behalf in London, as though
the <HI>subject</HI> of your enquiry were a thing of more <HI>im∣portance</HI>
to me; but, indeed, you can hardly conceive
how indifferent I am now grown, not only as to ar∣ticles

I am heartily glad to hear of her recovery; and
can but look upon the weeks which I purpose to pass
some time hereafter with you at Claverton, as the
most agreeable of any that belong to the remainder
of my life. I am sensible, that if I <HI>coveted</HI> to <HI>shine</HI>

in poetry, I should lose no time in visiting public
places: but my wishes of that sort are most extreme∣ly
limited, and I shall visit <HI>you</HI> on the account of
<HI>friendship;</HI> that is (past all doubt) on a much <HI>better principle.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE <HI>long</HI> meant to write to you, and have ac∣cordingly
given <HI>some</HI> answer to most parts of your
last letter. Nevertheless, the occasion of this pre∣sent
letter is quite of another kind,—A young painter
of my acquaintance is advised to go to Bath; has a
recommendation to the Bishop of B—, who will in∣troduce
him to the Duke of N—. And though I
cannot so easily bring him acquainted with nobles
or prime-ministers, I can give him directions to my
friend, who, in point of taste, is their superior. The
person then, who, I suppose, will be the bearer of
this letter, has, by dint of mere ingenuity, risen to
a considerable eminence in fruit-pieces, &amp;c. He has
been employed by Lord Lyttelton, and is much ad∣mired
at Oxford: for my own part, I believe you
will think he is in few respects inferior to, and has
(if I am not mistaken) some advantages of, Stran∣over;
but you will see his pieces. All I have to
say further on the occasion is, that he is a native of
our parish, and a particular friend of <HI>mine;</HI> and if
it were in your power to promote his interest at Bath,
you would not only highly gratify <HI>me,</HI> but at the

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>May 30, 1758.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK God, I have recovered a tolerable de∣gree
of health this spring; though by no means
free from so much heaviness and lassitude, as
renders
me averse to all activity both of body and mind. In
the course of my disorder, so long as I could bear
to
think of <HI>any</HI> sublunary enjoyment, I remembered
my
friends, and of course thought much of <HI>you;</HI>
but its
advances were so precipitate, when I sent for the
physicians, that I soon received a <HI>wrench</HI> from
every
object of this world: and it was by slow degrees,
even after my recovery, that my mind took so much
root again as appears necessary for its immediate
support. I suppose you have been informed that my
fever was in great measure hypochondriacal; and
left my nerves so extremely sensible, that, even
on
no very interesting subject, I could readily think my∣self
into a vertigo: I had almost said an epilepsy;
for surely I was oftentimes near it. It became, there∣fore,
expedient for my recovery, to amuse myself
with a succession of the most trivial objects I could
<PB N="275" REF="284"/>
find; and this kind of carelessness I have indulged
till it is grown into an habit. Even letters to my
friends are hardly consistent with my rule of health;
yet I could be no longer silent with regard to <HI>you,</HI>
without feeling a sensation that would hurt me <HI>more.</HI>
This may fairly enough be termed the first <HI>letter</HI> I
have wrote since my recovery; wherein if I should
tell you one half that I am inclined to do, relating to
this dreadful illness, what room should I then leave
to speak on any other subject? I must, therefore, tell
these things by word of mouth, or write them some
other time. The journies which my friends, and in∣deed
physicians, propose for me, are what certainly
bid fairest for the completion of my cure: yet there
are many, many things, which, however unfit for
the task, I must endeavour to adjust before I can leave
home with any possibility of enjoyment. Need I
mention any other than my cursed embarrassment
with D—; who, during my <HI>danger,</HI> was induced to
stop proceedings; but is now beginning law afresh,
and, by the removal of tenants from <HI>his</HI> share of the
Harborough estate, has now wriggled himself into
possession of almost one half of <HI>mine?</HI> However, I
am not without hopes of seeing all terminated in a
little time; nor entirely without a prospect of seeing
you at Claverton this summer. That you may think
this the more probable, I am pressed by two young
gentlemen, whom I very much esteem, to accompany
them on a visit to Mr. Bamfylde in Somersetshire.
<PB N="276" REF="285"/>
These two gentlemen are, Mr. Dean and Mr. Knight.
Perhaps you may have heard of Mr. Bamfylde, who
is very much at Bath; is there now with his lady, or
has left the place but lately; and whose fortune,
person, figure, and accomplishments, can hardly leave
him long unnoticed in any place where he resides.
Yet my visit to Estercomb must be of secondary con∣sequence
to me, whilst you live by the road-side. I
am much obliged to you for your compliment on my
Poematia in Dodsley's Miscellanies; which came very
seasonably, considering how I had been mortified by
the first sight of what was done. To speak the truth,
there are many things appear there very contrary
to my intentions; but which I am more desirous
may be attributed to the unseasonableness of my fe∣ver,
than to my friend D—'s precipitation. My pur∣pose
was to acknowledge as <HI>mine,</HI> none of the pieces
which now follow the longer Ode to Lady Luxbo∣rough.
Her name was actually erased; as also my
own at the close of your Fable. The verses by Mrs.
Bennet to Mr. Richardson were absolutely new to
me; where my name occurs again. All this is a∣gainst
me; as a thing in itself invidious to have one's
name recur so often, and as my <HI>own lines contradict</HI>
the merit which my friends so liberally allow me.—
The verses of mine in the sixth volume (which was
printed before the fifth) were printed without my
knowledge; and when I sent up an improved copy,
it arrived a good deal too late. As things happen,
<PB N="277" REF="286"/>
I am made to own several things of inferior merit
to those which I <HI>do not</HI> own.—All this is against
me; but my thoughts are avocated from this edition,
and wholly fixed upon a future; wherein, I hope,
Dodsley will be prevailed upon to omit some things
also from <HI>other</HI> hands which discredit his collection:
and, to balance <HI>all my discomforts</HI> on this head, the
world will know that I ant esteemed by a person
whom I esteem so much as you.—I know not how
it happens, but the taste for humorous poetry does
not prevail at this time: yet I cannot agree with Mr.
J. Warton, that it is no poetry <HI>at all,</HI> any more than
that a good representation of Dutch boors is not a
picture.—His brother, the Professor, is to be here
with his pupil Lord Donnegal, &amp;c. this summer.—
Mr. Spence and Mr. Dodsley will stay a day or two
here this month in their way to Scotland; and Mr.
Home, the author of Douglas, &amp;c. called on me, and
we spent an evening together at Admiral Smith's.
Thus my <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rme ornée</HI> procures me interviews with per∣sons
whom it might otherwise be my <HI>wish</HI> rather
than my good-fortune to see. Would to God, it could
attract <HI>you,</HI> whom I more long to see than any one!
and let me tell you, there were considerable addi∣tions
made to it last year: Dodsley's present of Fau∣nus;
a new Gothic-building, or rather a skreen, which
cost ten pounds; and the ruins of a Priory, which,
however, make a tenant's house, that pays me tole∣rable
poundage,—I am growing a little into <HI>your</HI>
<PB N="278" REF="287"/>
taste: why should not you advance farther into <HI>mine?</HI>
I mean, I have a love for medals, by means of some
that have been given me: yet do not think that I
shall ever rival <HI>you</HI>—my object is only <HI>beauty,</HI> and
I love only those of exquisite workmanship; so that
this is no more a rivalship than that of two persons
who admire the sex, but love different individuals;
a rivalship, which, I trust, is more likely to cement
our friendship than disunite us; which it is my <HI>con∣viction</HI>
and my <HI>comfort</HI> no <HI>sort</HI> of rivalship will ever
do. I have hardly room to express my good wishes
for long health and happiness to Mrs. Graves and
your little family, and to subscribe myself, my dear

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
<DATE>July 22, 1758.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IT gives me great anxiety when I reflect how long
I have waited for the satisfaction of a line from
you. I beg, if you are alive and well, you will let
me know so by the next post.</P>
<P>MR. Dodsley and Mr. Spence have been here and
stayed a week with me. The former was in certain
hopes of seeing you in town; but I do not find that
<PB N="279" REF="288"/>
he either saw or heard from you, which <HI>adds</HI> to my
anxiety.</P>
<P>I HAVE seen few whom I liked so much, upon so
little acquaintance, as Mr. Spence; extremely polite,
friendly, chearful, and mater of an infinite fund of
subjects for agreeable conversation. Had my affairs
permitted me, they had certainly drawn me with
them into Scotland; whither they are gone, for about
a month, upon a journey of curiosity.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it will give you pleasure to hear that
my law-suit with D—is accommodated, by the
generous interposition of my Lord Stamford; con∣cerning
whose benevolence and magnanimity it is
impossible for me to speak in the terms which they
deserve. It is ended, I hope, not very <HI>disadvantage∣ously</HI>
for me; apparently with <HI>one</HI> advantage, of being
intirely exculpated in the opinion of all mankind.
The common method (as M. Bruyere observes) is to
condemn <HI>both</HI> on these occasions. This suits peo∣ple's
indolence, and favours their impartiality. And
though the equitableness of my whole conduct in this
affair was self-evident to all that were near me, yet
I found many that were inclined to blame us <HI>both,</HI>
and <HI>some</HI> that I could never convince till <HI>now</HI> that
the fault was not <HI>wholly</HI> mine.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="289"/>
YOUR “Pepper-box and Salt-seller” are in one
of the Chronicles.—They pillage Dodsley's two last
volumes of all that is worth perusal—I surely have
some friend amongst the writers of the Monthly Re∣view;
for I have not only escaped a flogging, but
am treated with great civility.</P>
<P>I NEVER know how to leave off when I begin
writing to you, having always a great deal to say:
I only purposed you a few lines, to desire you would
write directly. Pray make my bed compliments to
Mrs. Graves, and believe me ever yours most in∣variably.</P>

<HEAD>XCIII. To the same, containing an Account of his
Excursions and Amusements.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Nov. 25, 1758.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had daily expectations of a line from
you these two months: conscious, however, that
I did not deserve any; and affording a manifest in∣stance
of the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atuations of self-love. The last let∣ter
that I received of yours is dated the close of
July, since which time I have been chiefly engaged
in my customary amusements; embellishing my farm,
and receiving the company that cams to see it. My
<PB N="281" REF="290"/>
principal <HI>excursions</HI> have been to Enville, on Lord
Grey's birth-day; to Lord Ward's, upon another
Invitation; and to the Worcester Music-meeting. I
need not mention what an appearance there was of
company at Worcester; dazzling enough, you may
suppose, to a person who, like me, has not seen a
public place these ten years. Yet I made a shift to
enjoy the splendour, as well as the music that was
prepared for us. I presume, nothing in the way of
harmony can possibly go further than the Oratorio
of “The Messiah.” It seems the best composer's best
composition. Yet I fancied I could observe <HI>some parts</HI>
in it, wherein Handel's judgement failed him;
where the masic was not equal, or was even <HI>opposite,</HI>
to what the words required. Very many of the
noblesse, whom I had seen at The Leasowes, were as
complaisant to me as possible; whereas it was my
<HI>former</HI> fate, in public places, to be as little regarded
as a journeyman shoe-maker.—There I first saw our
present Bishop; also our late Bishop's monument,
which is fine.—Lastly, there I first saw my Lady
Coventry; to whom, I believe, one must allow all
that the world allows in point of beauty. She is
certainly the most <HI>unexceptionable</HI> figure of a woman
I ever saw; and made most of the ladies there seem
of almost another <HI>species.</HI> On the whole, I was not
a little pleased that I had made this excursion; and
returned with double relish to the <HI>enjoyment</HI> of my
<HI>farm.</HI> It is now high time to take some notice of
<PB N="282" REF="291"/>
your obliging letter. I think I was not told the
purport of the journey you made to London; so can
only say, I am very sorry for the aggravating circum∣stances
of your disappointment; and hope, long be∣fore
this time, that Mrs. Graves is quite recovered.—Did
I forget to make your excuses to Dodsley or
no?—he was here (as I remember) soon after, with
Mr. Spence, in their way to Scotland—Mr. Spence,
the very man <HI>you</HI> would like, and who would like <HI>you,</HI>
of all mankind. He took my Elegies into Scotland,
and sent them back on his return, with a sheet or
two of criticisms, and an handsome letter.—How
much am I interested in the preservation of his friend∣ship!—
and yet, such is my <HI>destiny</HI> (for I can give
it no other name), I have never wrote to him <HI>since.</HI>
This <HI>impartiality</HI> of my neglect, you must accept <HI>your∣self</HI>
as <HI>some</HI> apology: but to proceed; Mr. Spence
chose himself an oak here for a seat, which I have
inscribed to him,
<Q><L>(“SPENCE'S OAK.)</L>
<L>EXIMIO. NOSTRO. CRITONI.</L>
<L>CVI. DICARI.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Subinellige SEDEM ISTAM (hanc).</NOTE> VELLET.</L>

<L>DICAT. AMICITIA.”</L></Q></P>
<P>I A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>SOLUTELY <HI>forgot</HI> to talk to Dodsley about
your—, and I am vexed; because I could, with
a safe conscience, have raised his idea of your
<PB N="283" REF="292"/>
abilities. However, it is not too late, even if you
care to publish it this winter.—His play comes on
(I fancy <HI>this very night</HI>) at Covent-garden. What
he says in behalf of this step is, that there was no
glimpse of probability, that Garrick would ever ad∣mit
it at the other house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He says, the players liked it, and seemed inclined to take pains with it.</NOTE>.—Mrs. Bellamy is his
Cleone, and speaks the epilogue, of which more anon.
I suppose he acts by Lord Chesterfield's opinion: for
I know, when he was going to print it (since he
came home) with a <HI>proper</HI> dedication to Mr. Garrick,
my Lord then prevented him, telling him, it <HI>would</HI>
be acted one day or other.—Did I ever send you a
copy of the epilogue, with all the additions and al∣terations? Dodsley first liked, then disliked it, and
lastly liked it again; only desiring me to soften the
satire, shorten the whole (for it was upwards of sixty
lines), and add a complimentary close to the <HI>boxes.</HI>
All this I have endeavoured, and sent it him last Mon∣day.
<HI>You</HI> would not care to own it: and he would
fain have <HI>me;</HI> but I think neither of us should run
the risque, where so little honour is to be acquired;
yet Mr. Melmoth's name to the prologue is an in∣ducement.—
I was very near surprizing you at Cla∣verton
this autumn, with my friend young Knight,
in his way to Mr. Bamfylde's; but he goes <HI>again</HI> in
spring, and I mall certainly accompany him; I have
<HI>bespoke,</HI> but not yet <HI>procured</HI> any, horses for my chaise.
<PB N="284" REF="293"/>
It is a neat one, you will find; and I have made two
or three excursions in it.—I saw Mr. Patchen's “To∣pographical
Letters” soon after they were published.—If
you continue to me the honour of a shield in
your Gothic al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove, the field should be either “Or,
three king-fishers proper,” or, with the addition
of a chief gales, three trefoils argent—no bar, che∣veron

RV<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>A MIHI.</P>
<P>I CANNOT recollect my company of the season, to
tell it you.—Sir Francis Dashwood, Lord Litchfield,
and Mr. Sheldon, were here together in the begin∣ning
of the autumn; and I have strong invitations
to visit them.—I have a very genteel letter from Sir
Francis, offering me gold-fishes; and I have a double
inducement to visit Mr. Sheldon, as he lives near
Mickleton, and is the most agreeable man alive.—
Your acquaintance Lord W—dined and spent good
part of a day with me. Under a sort of gloomy ap∣pearance,
a man of admirable sense and some hu∣mour.
I put him in mind of you, and the remarka∣ble
monument at Cambden.—Mr. Thomas Warton
was also here with Lord Donnegal, and has since sent
me his “Inscriptions” which are rather too simple,
even for my tase.—Bishop of Worcester with his
family and company—Lord Willoughby—Lord Fo∣ley—
I mention Lord Foley the rather, because I
<PB N="285" REF="294"/>
shall call on your friend Dr. Charleton (who was
also here) to pass a day or two with me at Whitley.—I
shall pass also a day or two at our Bishop's,
whom I met since at Enville. These two (<HI>propose</HI>
what I <HI>will</HI> besides) will probably be the principal,
or only excursions that I shall make this winter.—
God send it may no more affect my health than it
has hitherto done.—I am at present tolerably well,
and live more temperately than before.—Would to
God you could come over; go with me to Dr.
Charleton's, and Lord Foley's, and Lord Stamford's,
and pass a week here! I would meet you with my
chaise at Worcester, or even farther. I have finished
a building opposite to the new stable, which I think
you saw.—They together give my house a degree of
splendour. Did you see my Priory?—a tenant's
house, one room whereof is to have Gothic shields
round the cornice.—I am in some doubt whether to
make it an House of Lords or House of Commons;
if the former, my private friends will have shields
round my Gothic bed-chamber.—The wretch is
cursed that <HI>begins</HI> a letter with no better a pen than
I <HI>finish</HI> one with. My dear friend, write directly a

The Leasowes,
<DATE>Jan. 6, 1759.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IF you knew the maxims on which I conduct my∣self,
you might call me perhaps <HI>unpolite;</HI> but, I
think, by no means <HI>unfriendly;</HI> I mean with respect
to the <HI>ordinary congratulations</HI> on your <HI>marriage.</HI>
Were you and I less intimate, less experienced,
and less assured friends, it had been no venial omission
to have neglected such a ceremony. Perhaps I should
not have neglected it; but as I have the satisfaction
of believing that you would rejoice in any success
of mine, so I hope you would not distrust my senti∣ments
upon any change of your condition which you
yourself esteemed for the <HI>better.</HI> I do indeed, my
worthy friend, wish you much joy, both <HI>now</HI> and at
<HI>all</HI> times; and you will ever discern it in my face,
as often as fortune grants us an interview. Mr. S—
is a benevolent man, and I am sure would withhold
no information that tended to <HI>illustrate</HI> our friendship
on either side.</P>
<P>I HAVE thoughts of proceeding on to Harbury,
whenever I come to Mr. Wren's; as I have long
enough made my friend a promise, and intend ere
long to do. Many reasons occur why I cannot set
forward to-morrow morning: are these reasons sub∣stantial,
<PB N="288" REF="297"/>
or no other than the sly and sophistical in∣sinuations
of indolence?—surely the former.</P>
<P>DODSLEY, and indeed Mr. Spence, both expect
me in town this February.—I fear it will not <HI>be;</HI> but
if it <HI>should,</HI> how readily would I give notice, and be∣come
obliged to you for your company.</P>
<P>THOUGH I should have <HI>expected</HI> you would select
a partner whose society you could enjoy, yet I was
not a little satisfied with the hint given me in your
letter, as well as in one I had before received from
Mr. S—. It is not for such ladies as you and I
esteem, that Mrs.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Epilogue to Cleone.</NOTE> Bellamy's extraordinary lecture

and substituted about twelve or fourteen of his own.
However, he is now going to print his fourth edition
of it; in which the original epilogue will be restor∣ed,
as well as considerable improvements introduced
into his play. He sold two thousand of his frist
edition the very first day he published it.</P>
<P>I HAVE so <HI>much</HI> to tell you, and of so <HI>various</HI> kinds,
that I am afraid to expatiate upon <HI>any</HI> one article.
Cannot you make a shift to call upon me, before <HI>my

you at any place you should appoint.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="298"/>
I HAVE passed my winter hitherto pretty chearful∣ly
amongst my books, in what I <HI>call</HI> my library. It
now better deserves that name, by the form I have
given it, and the volumes I have added. Mr. S—
would tell you something of my <HI>other</HI> occupations.</P>
<P>I COULD wish that you would favour me with a
copy of your “Essay on Electricity,” and with any
new copy of verses of your own, or of your friends.—
Be not apprehensive: there shall nothing appear in
print of your composition any more, without your
explicit consent.—And yet I have thoughts of amu∣sing
myself with the publication of a small Miscellany
from neighbour Baskerville's press if I can save my∣self harmless as to expence—I purpose it no larger
than a “Lansdown's,” a “Philips's,” or a “Pom∣fret's
Poems.”</P>
<P>HAVE you read my friend Dr. Grainge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Tibul∣lus?
It affords you an elegant edition of a good
translation and of the text. He is engaged in a war
with S—, and has just sent me his pamphlet; which
I could wish you to read, in order to form a judge∣ment
of S—'s character.—Spence, I see, has adver∣tised
his “Parallel betwixt Malliabecqui and his
“Taylor.” It is merely a charitable design: and
such are now all Spence's views.</P>
<P>WHAT remains of my paper must be employed not
in <HI>mere</HI> ceremony, although in something that bears
<PB N="290" REF="299"/>
the form of it: in my best compliments to Mrs. Jago,
and my offer, not indeed of a part of the friendship
which I owe you, but rather of an equal quantity;
in an assurance of the cordiality with which I shall
rejoice to see both her and you; and in confirmation

<P>YOU will think my silence long; and I should
be sorry to <HI>have</HI> you quite regardless of it;
although, I fear, it must be my fate to trespass fre∣quently
upon your kind solicitude.—I have no ex∣cuse
to make, beside some frivolous avocations, and
<HI>much</HI> of that heaviness and lassitude which disinclines
one to write letters.—I passed the former part of my
winter with more vivacity than I did the latter, or
even the incipient spring; owing, possibly, to these
cold winds, which will not permit me to use my
wonted exercise. You will laugh at the word <HI>vivaci∣ty,</HI>
when applied to so dull an animal; but I speak
comparatively of that unmeaning drowsiness which is
my lot at other times, and <HI>was,</HI> in some sort, while
you were here.</P>

MR. Dodsley tells me, he received a letter from
you, acquainting him that Cleone would be played
at Bath: I should be glad to receive from you any
particulars of its success. He is publishing an elegant
edition of it, which I expect by this very post. The
new plate of my grove, which will appear at the end
of his Melpomene, is perhaps liable to some excep∣tions,
but by much the best that has yet appeared:
do not forget to send me your objections to it. As
to the epilogue, I have totally banished, I think,
every one of the lines which he <HI>substituted;</HI> have left
to him the choice of two or three readings for the
four last lines; and though none of them quite please
me, yet the epilogue, on the whole, discovers more
of genius, is more spirited, and less inaccurate. I
shall be glad to find that you think the same with
me.</P>
<P>IN regard to your place, so far as I can form an
idea of it, I would have you consult <HI>self</HI>-amusement;
I mean, without too much regard to what <HI>others</HI> say
or think. As to distinguishing your ingenuity (which
I unfeignedly desire you may), the press affords you
more <HI>adequate</HI> materials than either your fortune or
perhaps your place. Do not imagine, however, that
I shall not be much delighted with every stroke I
trace of yours at Claverton. My faculties are very
strongly intuitive in respect of every thing belong∣ing
<PB N="292" REF="301"/>
to you; and I should be ashamed if any nook
or angel that you had rounded, any wall that you
had ruinated, any stream that you had diverted, or
any single shrub that you had planted, should elude
my discovery: yet you will shine <HI>more</HI> by means of
the press; and if I said any thing concerning your—
that did not <HI>encourage</HI> you to perfect it, I am sure
I mus use terms very inexpressive of my meaning.
Without any more words, let me <HI>intreat</HI> you to pro∣ceed
with it: give A <HI>full scope</HI> to your imagination;
and if there should be aught one would wish <HI>retrenched,</HI>
it is mighty <HI>easily done.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE indeeed <HI>thoughts</HI> (for I <HI>never</HI> use the word

you will gainsay, when I tell you my intention of
publishing also my very Farm; at least, about eight
or ten scenes taken from it, by way of top and tail∣pieces
for those Elegies.—The world will perhaps
tax my vanity; but I do not in the least care.—The
pleasure which that world gives me, I am very con∣scious, will not be too <HI>high;</HI> and I am determined
that the pain it may seek to give shall bear pro∣portion:
yet should I be sorry to obtrude stuff upon
it, either from the pencil or the pen; and my good

a little.</P>

a propensity as ever person felt, I shall not be able
to reach your hemisphere while Mr. Spence, Mr.
Dodsley, and Mr. Whitehead, give it such peculiar
lustre in my eyes. This I did not despair of doing
at the time Mr. Dodsley left me at Birmingham. It

in order to which, one should perhaps pursue a me∣dium

Phaedrus. In respect of his own new-invented Fables,
I wish him to devise uncommon subjects, and to in∣culcate
refined morals. But pray send me <HI>your</HI> two
directly, which will answer all that I expect in Fables.</P>
<P>DID Mr. Dodsley tell you of the seat in my shrub∣bery
which I had taken the freedom to inscribe to
you? I could not <HI>satisfy</HI> myself in an inscription;
and, from a kind of spleen and aversion to delay,
made use of the shortest that I could devise. The
seat and scroll are elegant. The inscription, only,

<P>I WILL not be so affected as to pretend that the
much greater compliment you design <HI>me</HI> is more of∣fensive
to my modesty than it is pleasing to my
friendship. I wish however it could be a little shorten∣ed.
The “inter hortensis elegantiae studiosos” seems
a little too verbose for inscription. Beside, I had
<HI>rather</HI> the compliment were not thrown with so much

<P>TELL Mr. Dodsley, if he be yet at Bath, that Mr.
Cambridge called and dined with me; answering

from Mr. D—'s account. I wish to God he may have
brought you acquainted with Mr. Spence; to whom
you are, in my estimation, the most <HI>like</HI> of any one
I know. Is Mr. Spence yet at Bath? Mr. D—is gone,

they have amused me much of late. I hope, within

the same to Mr. Spence by your means, if he be at
Bath. Do you hear who is to be Bishop of Wor∣cester?

<HEAD>XCVIII. To the same.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Oct. 26, 1759.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I WANT no conviction of the pleasure which you
will receive from the termination of my infernal
lawsuit. It must, if I have <HI>any</HI> luck, be finally ad∣justed
in about nine days time; after having robbed
me of my peace for six of the best years of my life.
During the <HI>former</HI> part of life, I languished for an
aacquaintance somewhat more extensive: and when
<PB N="299" REF="308"/>
the company that flocked to see my place removed
all grounds of <HI>that</HI> complaint, this accursed dispute
arose, and mixed with every enjoyment that was of∣fered
me.—I have sometimes found entertainment in
balancing the good and evil that has been allotted me
in general; and have in the end imagined the good
prevalent, and that I have great reason to be thank∣ful
for more happiness than I deserve. Yet are there
many awkward circumstances that forbid the <HI>scale</HI> to
fall <HI>precipitately;</HI> among the chief, I place the distance
to which I see you and one or two others removed.
This is indeed an heavy article, and, were it not for
letters, would be insupportable.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Dodsley's collection of Fables, you are
mistaken if you think that I perused the quarto book,
I dipped into it here and there, and thought there
wanted <HI>much</HI> alteration. There was a little book
with a paper-cover, on which I bestowed no small
pains; and when I had so done, crossed the Fables
which I thought might well enough pass muster.
Addison would have been the belt writer of Fables
of any author I know—the purity of style—the con∣ciseness—
the dry humour—and the familiar manner.
As to Dodsley's publishing this winter, he may pos∣sibly
do so without loss of credit; but when one
considers that they are, or ought to be, the standard
for years to come, one can hardly avoid wishing him
to give them the polish of another summer. 'Twas
<PB N="300" REF="309"/>
fortunate that you pitched upon “The Raven and
Magpie” to transcribe for me; as Mr. Dodsley
had sent me “The Sun-flower and the Tuberose”
<HI>before.</HI> I thick the last somewhat inferior, but will re∣consider
it before I write again. The Fable which I
literally translated from Phaedrus was “The Wolf
and the Crane,” in order to give Dodsley an idea
on <HI>what</HI> Rollin laid the stress in Fables.</P>
<P>As to the inscription, I will endeavour to adjust
it your mind—“Meritisque reconditioribus” may
do, but is not explicit enough. I want fully to ex∣press
a character that shines remarkably among select
acquaintance, and yet (through extreme refinement)
makes less figure in the public eye.</P>
<P>I HAD made the same objection to Burke's chapter
upon <HI>wards</HI>—and yet there seems to be something
right in it. Du Bos (which I have only seen in
<HI>French,</HI> but which I believe is also translated) con∣sists
of three volumes, 12mo. His subjects are pleas∣ing,
and his knowledge may be entertaining; but
his genius seems not very profound, from the little
that I have consulted in him.</P>
<P>DODSLEY is <HI>precisely</HI> what you say of him; an ob∣ject
of esteem and love, and in some <HI>degree</HI> of ad∣miration.
His <HI>ear</HI> does not wholly please me in
writing, and yet he is intimately affected with musick
<PB N="301" REF="310"/>
—Lord L—'s ear is perhaps the reverse. I mean, he
does not much regard music, yet writes harmoniously
in verse and prose.</P>
<P>ROBERTSON I think to buy—Butler also, though
I shall not admire him—Lord Clarendon, when I am,
<HI>rich</HI>—Rasselas has a few refined sentiments thinly
scattered, but is upon the whole below Mr. J.—
Did I tell you I had a letter from Johnson, inclosing
Vernon's Parish-clerk? Pray take Dodsley's advice
in regard to your—; and heighten the ridiculous∣ness
of your <HI>heroe,</HI> which <HI>his</HI> kind of <HI>lunacy</HI> will
countenance, yet admit him to say good things <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but do not make <HI>any</HI> alteration in the narrative of
your own story—at least, till I have again perused it.
—Do not spurn this fifty pounds. It will procure
you numerous conveniences, which you would per∣haps
otherwise deny yourself.</P>
<P>I HAVE passed four or five days, betwixt this week
and last, at my Lord Ward's at Hinley. This has
furnished me with franks, beside the consolation I
derive from <HI>having paid</HI> a visit of this <HI>kind.</HI> It is
“spinis è pluribus <HI>una</HI> saltem exempta.” The <HI>re∣straint</HI>
renders them <HI>spinae.</HI> I hope I may say so
without umbrage, or giving an appearance of disre∣spect;
for Mr. W—is an agreeable man, and my
reception was very polite.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="311"/>
I HAVE three or four more of these superb visits
to make, and which I may not omit without giving
real offence. To Lord Plymouth, next week; Lord
Stamford's, the week after; then to Lord Lyttelton,
at our Admiral's; and then to Lord Foley, if your
friend Dr. Charleton will accompany me; then, &amp;c.
alas! alas! “Quid me exempta juvat spina?”—I
must conclude upon a separate paper. That your
<HI>expectation</HI> may not <HI>deceive</HI> you in regard to the plan
I promised, I inclose a survey of my farm, reduced
to miniature by a neighbouring artist. Let me know
if it bring the place to your memory. I think to
have a plate (which may be done at Birmingham
for six or eight shllings), that shall leave me no
trouble but to tinge the impressions with colours, in
order to give my friends. But do you advise me to
engrave <HI>this,</HI> or another that is twice as large?</P>
<P>I HAVE purchased “Gerard upon Taste,” the au∣thor
of which is a Professor at Edinburgh, and the
book commended in the Review—you will say that
the Reviewers are partial to Scotch-people—I know
nothing of that, but the book is learned, and on a
pleasing subject—I may perhaps add a very <HI>important</HI>
one—for surely it is altogether unquestionable that
taste <HI>naturally</HI> leads to virtue. I am however in some
doubt whether it will give you that amusement which
Burke's has done.—I <HI>must</HI> now take my leave, hav∣ing
<PB N="303" REF="312"/>
engagements of a different kind; but not till
I have desired my hearty respects to Mrs. Graves,
and her acceptance of this “Grove and King-fisher.”

<HEAD>XCIX. To the same, on his Want of Leisure.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Nov. 24, 1759.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I write to you again so soon, yet it
really grieves me to hear the complaint which
you so often make for want of time. I, who have
time to <HI>waste</HI> by lustres, cannot have patience with
the world, that suffers <HI>you</HI> to want the leisure which
you would employ to so much better purposes. Per∣haps,
however, you are as <HI>happy</HI> as more leisure could
<HI>make</HI> you; the case is not so <HI>clear</HI> as to leave me
satisfied of the contrary. And yet, as the pleasures
of imagination have an undoubted claim to a real
existence, they must surely afford very <HI>lively</HI> sensa∣tions
to persons of your sensibility and refinement.—Be
this as it may, I <HI>will</HI> always <HI>murmur</HI> that you
can so ill spare time for literary amusement. Never∣theless,
make <HI>one</HI> effort, and finish the task you have
now before you. I must confess, you may naturally
reply, that I am now become an interested person;
<PB N="304" REF="313"/>
but <HI>this,</HI> I am sure, will be no check to your acti∣vity.</P>
<P>MR. William Duncombe sent (with the first vo∣lume
of Horace) one of the satires in Ms. <HI>inscribed to
me.</HI> Upon purchasing, however, the second volume,
I find <HI>my</HI> name is changed to “Hawkesworth.”—Who
knows but I lost this compliment by writing to you,
my friend, while I should have been writing to him?—
if so, indeed, you ought to make it up to me;
and I am sure I shall prize <HI>your</HI> compliment beyond
that of which I have been deprived.</P>
<P>THE view of B—, which you mention, I have in∣deed
seen a long time ago; but surely the <HI>water-fall</HI>
is quite detestable. There is something on each side,
as I remember, that puts one in mind of a porridge∣pot
boiling over beneath the pot-lid. The appear∣ance
of the house and the back-ground is better;
this was adjusted by the painter, the other (as I think
Smith told me) by an old house-steward of Lord
T—'s.</P>
<P>I HAVE inclosed another copy of the lines to Venus,
for your emendation.—Thank you for the stanza you
introduced.—I meant, indeed, <HI>before,</HI> to allude to
<HI>natural</HI> beauty more than <HI>moral;</HI> but did not fully
enough express myself. There remains no transition
<PB N="305" REF="314"/>
now but from <HI>animal</HI> beauty to <HI>inanimate;</HI> which is
easier.</P>
<P>You will observe, that I take great liberties with
the Fables you ask me to revise.—Dodsley must think
me <HI>very</HI> fantastical or <HI>worse,</HI> while I was correcting
those he wrote at The Leasowes.—I find my <HI>ear</HI>
much more apt to take offence thán most other peo∣ple's;
and, as <HI>his</HI> is far less delicate than mine, he
must of course believe, in many places, that I altered
merely for alteration's sake. I cannot be easy with∣out
some certain proportion betwixt one sentence and
another; betwixt one member of a sentence and
another; without a melody at the close of a para∣graph
almost as agreeable as your “magnificent
“selon.”</P>
<P>I HAVE not written to Dodsley any decent letter
since he arrived at his house in London.—I must
now apply myself to write half a score Fables, and,
if he chuses it, a translation of La Motte's Discourse
upon the subject.—Your reply in regard to the de∣lay
of <HI>my</HI> publication cannot be answered; that is
certain.</P>
<P>WHITFIELD'S Journal, I <HI>fear,</HI> is purged of its
<HI>most</HI> ridiculous passages.—Dodsley brought one down
hither for Mr. Deane to shew my Lord D—th; but
<PB N="306" REF="315"/>
he tells me, there remains nothing of that <HI>gross</HI> ab∣surdity
which I saw in your brother's at Mickleton.</P>
<P>THE painter whom I just mentioned to have taken
some portraits through my recommendation, and to
have painted a ruin for my green-room, offers to
give me my picture if I chuse to sit.-Were you
here to lend me your assistance, I should certainly
comply.—Mean while, tell me what you think of
some of the attitudes that I inclose. What I myself
prefer at present is, to <HI>lessen</HI> my <HI>dimensions</HI> (which of
itself gives a kind of beauty), and to appear in a
kind of night-gown agreeable to the attitude mark∣ed
AA. The man evidently hits off likenesses, and
is esteemed to <HI>shine</HI> among the painters of Birming∣ham.
I shall be forced to have your picture copied
by him, which, by means of dampness, flies off the
canvas; so that, on the whole, I shall re-pay his
compliment.—This last article puts me in mind that
I owe you my picture, whenever you demand it; but
I would chuse to defer it till the spring, for some
certain reasons regarding oeconomy. Remember me
<HI>always</HI> to good Mrs.—; and believe me yours, with
all possible affection,</P>

<HEAD>C. To the same, with an Account of a Design for his
own Picture.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Jan. 8, 1760.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>WERE I to regulate my compliments by the
arrival of <HI>times</HI> and seasons, I should congra∣tulate
you upon a <HI>correspondence</HI> which now enters
upon its three and twentieth year.—Our <HI>friendship</HI> is
of something older date; and is not this an <HI>atchieve∣ment</HI>
that deserves the honour of a <HI>triumph</HI> both for
you and me too?—More, I am sure, than the regular
destruion of fifteen or twenty thousand wretches in
the field considering how <HI>uncommon</HI> we find friend∣ships
of so long a duration, and how <HI>cheap</HI> we find
such victories, not only on the Prussian, but on the
Austrian side.</P>
<P>MR. Cambridge (Scriblerus), who called here this
autumn, was considering this massacre rather in a phi∣losophical
than political view; and, indeed, it does
not appear to me that plague, earthquake, or famine,
are more pernicious to the human race, than what
the world calls Heroes; but enough of this.</P>
<P>YOUR want of leisure gives me pain; surely, if I
may guess by one or two of your last letters, you
have enlarged the number of your scholars, and ex∣tended
your domsitic cares, beyond what your cir∣cumstance.
<HI>require.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="317"/>
You must not judge of my painter's abilities by
the small sketch I inclose.—I desired him to give me
a <HI>slight</HI> one; and have, perhaps, ruined even <HI>that</HI>
by endeavouring to bring it nearer to what the picture
now <HI>is, myself.</HI> It will give you a tolerable idea in
most points, except the Pan, which has his face turn∣ed
towards the front; and is not near so considera∣ble.—
I chose to have this <HI>term</HI> introduced, not only
as he carries my favourite reeds, but as he is the
principal <HI>sylvan</HI> deity.—The Water-nymph below
has the word “Stour” on the mouth of her urn;
which, in some fort, rises at The Leasowes. On the
scroll is, “Flumina amem sylvasque inglorius,” al∣luding
to them <HI>both.</HI>—The Pan, you will perhaps ob∣serve,
hurts the <HI>simplicity</HI> of the picture—not much,
as we have managed him; and the intention here is,
I think, a balance.</P>
<P>THE dog on the other side is my faithful Lucy,
which you perhaps remember; and who <HI>must</HI> be
<HI>nearer</HI> the <HI>body</HI> than she perhaps would if we had
more room. However, I believe, I shall cause her
head to cut off that little cluster of angles, where the
balustrade joins the base of the arch. The balus∣trade
is an improvement we made the other day:
it is, I think, a great one; not only as it gives a
symmetry or balance to the curtain of which you
complained, bat as it extends the <HI>area</HI> on which I
<PB N="309" REF="318"/>
stand, and shortens the <HI>length</HI> of this <HI>half-arch.</HI> The
painter objected to a tree; I know not why; unless
that we could introduce no <HI>stem</HI> without encroaching
too much upon the landscape: but the reason he gave
was, it would be an injury to the face. The con∣sole
is an Apollo's head. The impost does not go
further than the pilaster, which ends the corner;
and here the drawing is erroneous. We are, I think,
to have a carpet, though we know not well how to
manage it.</P>
<P>AND now, I must tell you the dimensions. The
figure itself is three feet, three inches and a half;
the whole picture four feet, eleven inches, by three
feet, two inches and three-quarters.—The colour of
the gown, a sea-green; waistcoat and breeches, buff∣colour;
stockings white, or rather pearl-colour; cur∣tain
a terra-sienna, or very rich reddish brown.—I
think the whole will have a good effect; but beseech
you to send me your opinion <HI>directly.</HI> There are some
things we can alter; but there are others we must not.</P>
<P>YOU shall have one of the size you desire in the
spring; but will you not calculate for some one place
in your room? The painter takes very strong like∣nesses;
is young; rather daring than delicate in his
manner, though he paints well in enamel; good∣natured;
slovenly; would improve much by applica∣tion.

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,

<P>I COULD not understand, by Mr. Dodsley's last
letter to me, that he had any <HI>sort</HI> of intention to
publish his Fables this winter. Presuming upon this
delay, and having neither had the <HI>leisure</HI> nor the
<HI>frame</HI> of mind fit to take his preface into considera∣tion,
I have hitherto deferred to do so; and can only
say in <HI>general,</HI> that I could wish you had happened to
be more copious in your observations. La Motte's
Discourse on Fables is a most excellent performance;
containing, as appears to <HI>me,</HI> all that need be said
upon the subject, and this expressed with all imagina∣ble
elegance and perspicuity. I believe I shall ad∣vise
our friend D—to make more ample use of this
dissertation. There is a translation of La Motte into

Motte is not precise: and, as the words <HI>naïf</HI> and
<HI>naiveïé</HI> seem of late to become more in vogue, I
will here give you an extract of what he says upon

AND now, let me know what English word you
would employ to interpret <HI>naïf. Sentimental</HI> has
some pretensions; but is not wholly to one's mind.</P>
<P>I BOUGHT the quarto edition of La Motte's
Fables, to which this essay is prefixed; though the
vaunted cuts which tempted me to this extravagance
did not answer my expectation. The author, with
much address, begs the Duke of Orleans to be at the
expence of them; which, to the bell of my remem∣brance,
was “deux mille ecus.”</P>
<P>MR. Hurd, you see, is one of Dr. Warburton's
Chaplains. I bought his “Dialogues Moral and Po∣litical,”
almost as soon they were published. Sir
Edward Lyttelton told me, the introductory one
would be omitted in the next edition. The three
following are very ingenious; but the two former
are a little ambiguous in regard to his intended
moral: the two lsst are wholly political, and I have
not yet perused them, though esteemed the <HI>best.</HI></P>
<P>HAVE you seen Dr. Smith's “Theory of Moral
Sentiments,” which is prodigiously commended,
and which I have bought, but not read?—You will
see an account of this in the Monthly Review.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="322"/>
I HAVE lately been reading one or two volumes of
“The Rambler;” who, excepting against some few
hardnesses in his manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HE too often makes use of the <HI>abstract</HI> for the <HI>concrete.</HI></NOTE>, and the want of more ex∣amples
to enliven, is one of the most <HI>nervous,</HI> most
<HI>perspicuous,</HI> most concise, and most harmonious prosers∣writen;
I know.—A learned diction improves by
time.</P>
<P>I AM sorry to find no mention of your—in all
the letters which I have received of late. Do not
think of <HI>dropping</HI> or even <HI>delaying</HI> the publication of
it; only, if you please, before it goes to the press▪
let me peruse it once deliberately.—What think you,
if Dodsley approve it, of admitting cuts into your
scheme?</P>
<P>AND now, from <HI>cuts</HI> I proceed to <HI>pictures.</HI> Al∣cock's
portrait of me is in a manner finished; and
has been hung up for these nine days past, in its
carved frame, opposite to the fire-place in my library.
<HI>They say</HI> it is a likeness, allowing for the diminution
of size. Indeed, if I can conclude any thing from
the strong resemblance which he has produced of
<HI>others</HI> here, I may form some <HI>conjecture</HI> that he has.
not failed in mine.—Be this as it will, the picture is,
upon the whole, a tolerably pleasing one; and this is
<PB N="314" REF="323"/>
the <HI>most</HI> I must dare to say, considering my own per∣son
makes so large a part of it.</P>
<P>WHAT think you of a tawney or reddish brown
for the robe or night-gown, with black for the waist∣coat
and breeches, reserving green for the curtain?
though green is, with me at least, no very gay colour,
nor has it that <HI>effect</HI> which you apprehended in the
drapery. Terra-sienna is a delightful colour; so, I
think, is Roman ocre burnt. Let me know then,
what objections you have to the drapery just now
proposed. Let me know also any design that you
think most pleasing for a back-ground; or any story
of two or three figures, that would be suitable for a
relievo.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>pictures</HI> I proceed to <HI>painters.</HI> I believe,
Alcock would go and settle at Bath, if Amos Green
could be induced to join him. Amos Green is the
name of the painter whom I recommended to you
<HI>before my fever.</HI> He is esteemed inferior to no one
in England for fruit. He also paints flowers, insects,
and dead-game, <HI>very</HI> well. To this he would adjoin
the business of water-painting. Alcock would paint
portraits in oil; and to this he would add enamel-painting:
both of them the best-natured young fel∣lows
in the world. Now suppose them also <HI>ingenious,</HI>
and tell me whether they would have a chance to
<HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rive.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="324"/>
You ought to have very considerable <HI>amends,</HI> if
you are to be plagued with writing and with music-masters.—
I believe I rate your time and trouble at
a much higher price than you do yourself.</P>
<P>DR. Blackstone has raised himself to a very eminent
figure indeed in the world of letters. I rejoice at
it, without one particle of envy, both as he is your
friend, and a person of merit. I believe no one be∣sides
yourself would have dreamt of your odd ana∣logy
betwixt him and me.—I know not <HI>how</HI> they
came to insert that insipid Song of mine▪ in the
Chronicle.—What sensation it caused in me, was
that of disapprobation; as it looked like laying stress
on what one knows to be of no importance.</P>
<P>THE chief points wherein my picture varies from
your drawing is in the corner below the base of the
pedestal; where an antique vase is introduced with
a flower and two or three leaves of the scarlet Gera∣nium.
The gilt vase agrees well enough with the
gold fringe on the edge of the curtain; but the whole
is so <HI>subdued,</HI> as not to catch the eye too strongly.
It was chiefly meant to obviate the disagreeableness
of the <HI>parallel</HI> lines and angles occasioned by the step
in that corner; but it crowds that side a little, if one
look from top to bottom; and, though a pleasing
<PB N="316" REF="325"/>
object, it is hard to say whether it do more good or
harm.</P>
<P>IT is time now to take my leave, with my hearty
respects to Mrs. Graves, and with the usnal assurance,
that I remain your most affectionate and faithful
friend,</P>

<HEAD>CII. To the same, on his neglecting his Correspon∣dence.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>July 7, 1760.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST confess that I do not altogether find
your argument conclusive.—An hurry of business
<HI>may</HI> be necessary, and somewhat inconsistent with fre∣quent
correspondence; but a state of <HI>leisure,</HI> which
I wished you, does not imply a course of <HI>dissipation;</HI>
which makes your present apology for not writing to
me before. And so, betwixt business at one time
and dissipation at another, I am to be defrauded of a
correspondence that is quite essential to my well-being.
Pardon me, if, on such occasion, you find me ex∣tremely
clear-sighted in the foibles of my friends;
and do not say with the man in Horace, “Cur in
amicorum vitiis, &amp;c.” The <HI>matter</HI> is too <HI>important</HI>
for me to connive at any sort of sophism.—However,
<PB N="317" REF="326"/>
to make you easy on this head, I am convinced the
letter was owing to <HI>you;</HI> for which I will draw my
apology neither from <HI>business</HI> nor dissipation: and yet
how justly might I palliate my long silence upon
<HI>either</HI> footing! Since I wrote to you, I have been
<HI>bufied</HI> in bringing about a conclusion with D—. The
letters, journies, &amp;c. <HI>previous</HI> and <HI>posterior</HI> to the exe∣cution
of articles, would afford me noble matter for
excuse.—The constant attendance upon workmen (of
which I have fourteen or fifteen this very day), mak∣ing
a piece of water below my Priory, would pro∣duce
more on the score of <HI>dissipation</HI>—you remember
the place. This, at present, is my chief employment,
although Alcock is drawing on the side of my table.—
I wonder you do not get some little urns turned,
in any sort of wood, about fourteen or fifteen inches
high, and painted on the side with figures, in the
manner of some antique basso-relievo. He has done
something of this sort for me. You may, if you so
please, have the ground a dark <HI>bronze,</HI> and the figures
a <HI>light</HI> one. I am of late grown fond of bronze
(which you yourself may easily execute), and I think
it always was your taste.—Dodsley comes hither in
about a fortnight, and prints <HI>one</HI> edition of his
Fables by means of Baskerville's press and paper.
<HI>Mean time,</HI> he is to <HI>give</HI> me his picture done by Rey∣nolds;
and to <HI>send</HI> me two bronzed plaster urns, of
about twelve inches, with basso-relievo; and two
figures (ditto) of Homer and Virgil (of about twenty∣one
<PB N="318" REF="327"/>
one inches) for two niches in my library. The parcel
is to be pieced out with Ogilby's Virgil, which I
want for the sake of the landscapes.—And now to the
particulars of your letter.</P>
<P>I CAN readily conceive how much greater pleasure
you must receive from the <HI>retinue</HI> of your journey,
than an Archbishop can from all his equipage; and
I can truly allure you, I find a pleasure in every plea∣sure
you enjoy.</P>
<P>YOUR room, indeed, will be a noble one; but be
sure remember the “Imploravit opes hominis, fr∣ae∣numque
recepit,” and guard against it—to speak
my sentiments, I think you will. I think with you
in regard to Tristram Shandy; so does the author of
the Monthly Review, you will see. I bought Webb
instantly; but have not read it. Lord Lyttelton is
<HI>allowedly</HI> the author of those Dialogues; whose the
very last, I do not know. There is a noble specimen
of Scotch poetry translated from the Erse language
—I have had two copies sent me from Scotland;
and, had I two franks, would send you one. “Chry∣sal, or The Adventures of a Guinea” (real charac∣ters
intended), will amuse you. Something <HI>ever</HI> oc∣curs
that obstructs my travelling at all—and though
I long <HI>ardently</HI> to visit you, the Lord knows when it
will be; yet <HI>be</HI> it certainly will, when I accompany
Mr. Knight to Mr. Bamfylde's: where I am pressingly
<PB N="319" REF="328"/>
invited by that gentleman and his neighbours, Lady

<HEAD>CIII. To the same, on DODSLEY'S Fables, and other
Literary Articles.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Mar. 1, 1761.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH this interval in our correspon∣dence
must be placed, I fear, to <HI>my</HI> account, you
will hardly think it mends the matter to <HI>fill</HI> my pre∣sent
letter even with the best-grounded apologies—
I will only mention a bad state of health, which has
been my lot this winter, as a general excuse for two
or three months silence; and then declare, as with,
truth I may, that the esteem and affection which you
have so well deserved of me have never undergone
the least diminution or abatement. It is with me a
melancholy task, to <HI>write</HI> letters when I am not well;
although it be the time, of all others, when it is most
necessary for me to <HI>receive</HI> them.—Our friend Dod∣sley,
I presume, has sent you a book of his Fables
before this time. What merit I have there, is in
the <HI>Essay;</HI> in the <HI>original Fables,</HI> although I can hard∣ly
claim a single Fable as my own; and in the <HI>Index,</HI>
which I caused to be thrown into the form of <HI>Morals,</HI>
<PB N="320" REF="329"/>
and which are almost wholly mine. I wish to God
it may sell; for he has been at great expence about
it. The two rivals which he has to dread are, the
editions of Richardson and of Croxall.—The <HI>Fables</HI>
in Croxall are tolerably written: his <HI>reflections,</HI> little
to the purpose, either for boys or grown people.—
Richardson's <HI>Improvement of L'Estrange</HI> would be a bet∣ter
collection, both for the <HI>Fables</HI> and the <HI>moral Re∣flections,</HI>
had he not admitted, through an extravagant
and mistaken love of drollery, that vulgarity of
phrase which in many places is not <HI>common English.</HI>—
This I think a true state of the case: say the best
you can in behalf of Dodsley.—As to his cuts, though
to <HI>him</HI> expensive, they will hardly, I fear, meet with
much of your approbation—the scale is much too
small—and the emblematic prints which are larger
will scarce, I fear, be understood.—I procured a copy
from Baskerville <HI>before</HI> the plates were <HI>inserted,</HI> and
have eaused my painter (Alcock) to supply the va∣cancies
with some devices of my own—some account
of which I send you, as it may amuse you for a minute.
I want one or two to compleat my scheme, and should
be glad if you would propose some in your next letter.—
I return you my hearty thanks for the hints you
gave for the Cambridge verses; but when I received
them it was too late, and I myself too much indis∣posed,
either to throw them into proper form, or
even to answer that gentleman's letter, which I
thought a very genteel one.—I know not what he did
<PB N="321" REF="330"/>
on that occasion, having seen neither Cambridge nor
Oxford verses—Mr. Dodsley gave me “The En∣virons
of London.”—Between friends. I wish he
may find five thonsand readers, whom the manage∣ment
of that work pleases more than <HI>me.</HI>—I will try
to get you some of the <HI>cuts,</HI> if you desire me to do
so, though it will reflect a kind of tacit dislike of
the <HI>whole</HI> performance.—His brother publishes this
winter “The Works of Soame Jenyns,” in three
pocket-volumes; and a Chinese novel from a Ms.
translation, revised, &amp;c. by a friend of mine. You
have perhaps heard me speak of Mr. Percy—he <HI>was</HI>
in treaty with Mr. James Dodsley, for the publica∣tion
of our best old ballads in three volumes.—He
has a large folio Ms. of ballads, which he shewed me,
and which, with his own natural and acquired ta∣lents,
would qualify him for the purpose as well as
any man in England. I proposed the scheme for
him <HI>myself,</HI> wishing to see an elegant <HI>edition</HI> and good
collection of this kind.—I was also to have assisted
him in selecting and rejecting; and in fixing upon
the bell readings: but my illness broke off our cor∣respondence,
the beginning of winter; and I know
not what he has done since.—There is a New Peër∣age
going to be published; with, I believe, the
draughts of the Peers houses—Lightholer called here,
and said he had taken Lord Lyttelton's, and Lord
Stamford's, for that purpose; the latter of which he
shewed me.—Thus I have told you what I hear of new
<PB N="322" REF="331"/>
<HI>publications.</HI> As to what passes in the busy world, I
know no more than the Chronicle informs me—un∣less
when <HI>your</HI> letters happen to be <HI>rounded</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>“Our little life is <HI>rounded</HI> with a sleep.”</P>
<P>SHAKESPEARE.</P></NOTE> with lit∣tle
anecdotes from Bath.—Have you seen Baskerville's
new Prayer-books? My Lord Dartmouth has under∣taken
to present two to the King and Princess.—Do,
for <HI>charity's</HI> sake, make me some amends for this long
chasm in our correspondence, by a very early and
long letter.—I am sick to hear from you; being, with

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,

<P>I WILL, upon your last assurance, take it <HI>ever</HI> for
granted, that you do not omit writing upon any
score of ceremony. This will render your silence,
at least in some <HI>degree,</HI> less irksome to me; when I
do not think it the effect of my own procra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tination.—
Mr. Dodsley had sold two thousand of his Fables
long ago; but complained that he should <HI>lose</HI> thirty
pounds by my neighbour Baskerville's impression; and
that he should not be more than ten pounds gainer
<PB N="323" REF="332"/>
upon the <HI>whole.</HI> I told him It was enough, in books
of <HI>this sort,</HI> if the first edition paved the way for their
future establishment in schools. And surely so it is:
for a book of this kind, once established, becomes an
absolute estate for many years; and brings in at least
as certain and as regular returns. I would <HI>wish</HI> him
to give the polite world one more edition from
Baskerville's press; admitting Only a <HI>new</HI> sett of em∣blematical
top and tail-pieces; and consining those
empty cuts relating to each Fable to the cheap edition
which he prints at London. A second edition of
this latter fort will appear in a little time; and if you
have any improvements to propose, he will very
thankfully receive them. Mr. Spence offers him to
write <HI>the life</HI> afresh; and Spence, Burke, Lowth, and
Melmoth, advise him to discard <HI>Italicks.</HI> I confess
he has used them to a very great <HI>excess,</HI> but yet I do
not think they should be utterly discarded,</P>
<P>I DID not intend that Mr. Davenport should ever
hear of those verses; and how he came to do so, is
past my comprehension. He seemed to me to have
deserted Worfield, without any intention to return
again. I therefore meant to inscribe them under my
own Venus, in order to afford some novelty, at an
<HI>easy rate,</HI> to those who are curious enough to <HI>repeat</HI>
their visits here. Pray, if you see Mr. and Mrs.
Davenport, present my bed respects to them; and
as to the verses, I will send you a copy for them, if
<PB N="324" REF="333"/>
you <HI>desire</HI> or <HI>advise</HI> me so to do.—Mr. S—is agree∣able,
not void of learning, has some smartness, but
little taste. Mrs. S—has <HI>much</HI> of the latter; and
perhaps imagination, which makes a part of taste,
may have had no small share in converting her to
Popery.—Mr. Powys I have almott forgot.—You are
ingenious and very inventive in regard to the means
of giving yourself mortification. I dare to say, your
new building suggests no such idea as you conceive;
and I think it sufficient in a parsonage-house, if
one sees detached specimens of taste or elegance,
without uniformity, or even without consistency.</P>
<P>I DO not find but that you <HI>figure</HI> among the gentry
near Bath. Dr. Charleton, who was here yesterday
with Sir Francis and Mr. Knight, gave me an ac∣count
that the B—of G—had been to pay his re∣spects
to you. I will not enter into particulars, but
would wish you to cultivate his acquaintance. I
shewed Sir Francis the dead colouring of the picture
which I intend to send to you; but you must know
that Alcock is the most volatile of all creatures that
have not wings: by way of improving the picture
I meant for Dodsley, he has made it infinitely less
like; and yet it must go to London as <HI>it is,</HI> for God
knows when he can be brought to alter it.</P>
<P>I <HI>asked</HI> the Doctor, how Mr. Blackstone came to
obtain a seat in Parliament; and his answer was,
<PB N="325" REF="334"/>
“The King insisted on it, as he was a man of learn∣ing
and. ingenuity.”—The enmity betwixt Lord
L—n and Mr. P—, I find, continues in its full force;
insomuch that my Lord is to have no place while Mr.
P—continues in the ministry.—My Lord B—'s pro∣motion
was, it seems, demanded by the D. of N—
and Mr. P—, as they would not be exposed to bear
the blame, while he was the chief mover behind the
curtain. These little particles of intelligence have,
I believe, Sir—for their author.—I was told by
another politician, the same day, that we were not
to expect a peace; that the French, who might give
up the Colonies, would not resign the Fishey.</P>
<P>MR. Knight, his mother and sister, go through
Bath to Mr. Bamfylde's in about three weeks, if no∣thing
intervene. I am teazed greatly to accompany
them—by my own <HI>inclination,</HI> I can assure you, as
well as their <HI>importunity.</HI> I do not say I will <HI>not,</HI> nor
must I ever promise you <HI>beforehand</HI> that I <HI>wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</HI> I

<HEAD>CV. To the same, on the intended Publication of

<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Sept. 14, 1761.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I OUGHT to have thanked you many weeks ago,
for a very <HI>long</HI> and <HI>entertaining</HI> letter; the <HI>length</HI>
of which, as well as the <HI>entertainment,</HI> was ircreased
by a postscript a few days after.—But as the Winter
is with me a dull and uniform season, so the Summer
is a time of universal dissipation; and very happy
do I think myself, when, after a continual succession
of company, visits paid, and excursions taken, I can
sit down in peace and quietness, to attend to the
business of correspendence and friendship. Either
reason., habit, or complexion tells me, that I am ne∣ver
<HI>otherwise</HI> so properly employed.</P>
<P>THE last digression I made was to the concert at
Worcester, to hear “The Messiah” well performed;
to meet a number of faces one knows; but first, and
principally, to visit year brother, <HI>without</HI> which mo∣tive
I had not gone. In the two <HI>former</HI> respects, the
journey answered my expectation:—but, alas! your
brother was gone into Herefordshire. I, however,
alighted out of the chaise; and the house-keeper very
civilly shewed me his delightful parlour, that looks
into the meadows, the Prebends' gardens, and down
the Severn to Malvern-hills. A more agreeable
<PB N="327" REF="336"/>
town-house cannot possibly be found any where. But
I regretted, when I reached the inn, that I had not
asked to see his children; for I either heard them up∣stairs,
had a glimpse of them at the window, or fan∣cied,
to a degree of conviction, that they were most
of them within the house. I now return to remark
upon some particulars in your letter—I believe it is
that indifference you complain of, which is the <HI>grand</HI>
detriment to genius in an advanced part of life. In
all <HI>poetical</HI> affairs, we are too apt to cry out with
Pallas, “Non est mihi tibia tanti;” and this ren∣ders
all our efforts tame, prosaic, and judicious. But
this propensity, as well as many others, we should
guard against, upon the approach of age; change
the object of our amusements; cherish hopes, well or
ill-grounded, of finding that pleasure in the novelty
of objects, which we have not found in any indi∣vidual.
These are the means of <HI>preserving our vi∣vacity</HI>
a somewhat longer time than it naturally lasts;
but how far it is <HI>prudent</HI> to attach ourselves to the
world that we must leave, is a point which <HI>you</HI> better
can determine. Refined taste, as it implies a <HI>love</HI> of
physical beauty, has this tendency.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing can be more rational than what
you say about the expediency of <HI>losing no time,</HI> if I
mean to collect and publish what I have written.
You are indeed very partial to my abilities; but, al∣lowing
for <HI>that,</HI> what you mention <HI>coincides</HI> with
<PB N="323" REF="337"/>
what I have thought myself, and this for some years
past. A more agreeable kind of <HI>distraction</HI> in sum∣mer,
and an indifferent state of health and spirits in
winter, have hitherto prevented any progress in the
correction of my pieces. To these I might add a
<HI>suspence</HI> about the compositions, and the manner pro∣per
for publication. I am now most inclined to
make a collection of the whole; I mean, the best of
what are already printed or in Ms; to publish them
by subscription in a large <HI>quarto</HI> size for the sake of
profit; and to apologize for this method, by mention∣ing
the expence of top and tail-pieces, with which
I mean they shall be embellished. Some of <HI>these</HI> (by
the bye) may be taken from my farm, the rest em∣blematical,
in an easy and careless, but, at the same
time, elegant, manner. I should think the instance
of Mr. Pope might render this method not disreputa∣ble;
and it might be advertised (as was done by Mr.
Spence), that, unless a certain number were subscribed
for, the whole affair should be no farther prosecuted.
This would put it in the way of many friends to serve
me, who (I flatter myself), <HI>with inclination,</HI> esteem
themselves void of <HI>opportunity.</HI> Let me beg you to
think seriously of this, as well as of a general title∣page,
before you write again.</P>
<P>THANK you kindly for all the little diverting
anecdotes that are contained in your letter. I am
glad to hear your <HI>place</HI> brings you company; partly,
<PB N="329" REF="338"/>
as it tends to amuse you; and yet more, as it tends
to make your merit more conspicuous. You and I
have led a life of total disinteressment. Let me ad∣vise
you to seek some <HI>advantage</HI> from your commerce
with <HI>great men.</HI>—The boy, who was here with you
and Mrs. Graves, was here last Friday evening with a
Mr. Jolliffe and his son; the latter of whom observed
your name upon the bench, and seemed proud to
declare that he was once your school-fellow. Mr.
Stratford (to whom I had written about gold∣fishes)
says in his answer, “I had the pleasure from
Bath of waiting upon Mr. G—, and was as much
satisfied with the miniature beauties of his place,
as with the polite reception I met with from the
owner.” If you have an opportunity, you will
oblige me by presenting my compliments to that
gentleman.—I met Dr. Charleton at Worcester, who
stands high in my esteem.—The account of Gothic
architecture, &amp;c. is curious; but I have found it in
Dr. Warburton's edition of Pope.—I inclose the
verses on the Venus de Medicis—I told you before
my intentions, &amp;c. concerning them; and since, I
hear that they have appeared in some one of the
Magazines—through Dodsley's or Percy's means, for
I surely gave a copy to nobody besides; and those
copies must be much imperfect.—My picture shall be
sent you as soon as I can possibly get Alcock over,
who has promised to come every week for these three
months past. I believe he <HI>will</HI> come soon.—I did
<PB N="330" REF="339"/>
not know of Mr. Warton's compliment; but he is
very obliging to me on all occasions, and sends me
all that he publishes.—I have not yet read Dr. Robin∣son's
History, to my shame be it spoken, though
I have the honour to. know the author.—I hope the
King <HI>will</HI> oblige the Irish Peers with a place in the
procession, as that people seems greatly out of tem∣per;
and, I fear, not without some reason.</P>
<P>I SEE my friend Dodsley has <HI>let off</HI> his little <HI>squib</HI>
upon the marriage, in the Chronicle. “<HI>The King
sought a partner,”</HI> &amp;c. And last night was brought
me, from Baskerville's press, on the same occasion,
very <HI>pomp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sly</HI> printed, the most despicable Grub-street
I ever saw.</P>
<P>I HAVE made some little improvements about my
place; have taken away the wall in front, and made
a handsome ring; have extended my path, in one
p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ece of ground, greatly for the better—but the
grand water in the valley will make no figure till
next spring.</P>
<P>I HAVE also assisted my friend Hull the comedian
in altering the Tragedy of “Rosamond;” had it
brought upon the stage to a full house at Birming∣ham,
where it was very well received; put Hull into
a way of making an indirect compliment to the pre∣sent
King in the ten last lines of his Epilogue, which
<PB N="331" REF="340"/>
was followed by “God save great George,” &amp;c. in a
full chorus of the audience and actors drawn out
abreast upon the stage.</P>
<P>SINCE this, there has been deposited in my hands
a large collection of Poetry, by a Miss Wheatly of
Walsall: many of the pieces written in an excellent
and truly classical style; simple, sentimental, harmo∣nious,
and more correct than I almost ever saw writ∣ten
by a lady. They will be published, I believe, by
subscription, under the patronage of Lord Dart∣mouth.</P>
<P>BUT nothing in the poetical way has pleased me
better than a compliment which I received about nine
days ago by the post, under the feigned name <HI>Cot∣swouldia.</HI>—She
must be some Gloucestershire lady that
has seen the place; as she raises up a Fairy in my
grove, into whose mouth she puts the compliment.
It seems written by somebody of fashion by the style.—Can
you form any conjecture?</P>
<P>THERE was a Mr. Freeman of Betstow (or some
such name) with two or three ladies in a coach and
six that were here not long before; a very genteel
and polite young man.</P>
<P>I REALLY know not how to stop, when I begin a
letter to <HI>you;</HI> and it is one reason why I look upon
<PB N="332" REF="341"/>
the task as too considerable to be undertaken at all
times. Pray write soon, and believe me wholly yours

<HEAD>CVI. To the same, suggesting to him a Subject for
Poetry.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>May 20, 1762.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND you will <HI>not</HI> write, unless I give a regular
answer to your letters; and yet, God knows, I
have a better excuse for my delay, than I wish my
friend to have for his punctilio; I mean, indisposi∣tion.—Whence
is has happened, I cannot say, unless
I may blame these continual east winds; but I have
suffered more from the smiles of Spring, than I have
really done from the frowns of Winter.</P>
<P>HAVING premised thus much, I lay your letter
before me. The expence of printing a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet of those
commendatory verses at a common press is eighteen
shillings; and at Baskerville's about three pounds,
ten shillings: nor do I mean any decorations, unless
perhaps “The King-fisher,” or “View of my
Grove,” which, you know, I <HI>have</HI> engraven ready
to <HI>my</HI> hands. So you see that <HI>this</HI> offering to vanity
is not likely to be the most expensive.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="342"/>
I WISH you had bestowed somewhat more attention
upon <HI>the title;</HI> in which case, I really believe the job
had been executed long ago. Pray be so kind as to
re-consider it.—Is not “The Garland of Friendship”
a little too quaint? for that, as I remember, was what
I proposed.—The <HI>motto</HI> which you proposed was a
very good one; and I think also, that the addition
of the next line would be an improvement to it;
“Et isti errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum.”
But I do not love <HI>double</HI> mottoes; so, if I admit this,
I must exclude what I proposed; which, to speak the
truth, was of my own invention.</P>
<P>THE custom of prefixing commendatory verses to
collections of poetry is now seemingly grown obso∣lete.
Besides, in my case, they would only shew
that I had <HI>taken</HI> up more fame than my funds would
answer. I return you many thanks for <HI>your</HI> poetical
benevolence; but why do you mention it under the
name of <HI>Epigram?</HI> I do not even chuse that it should
have the air of <HI>simile</HI> from the <HI>beginning:</HI>
<Q><L>“Lo the tall youth, by partial fate's decree,</L>
<L>To affluence born, and from restraint set free;</L>
<L>How pleas'd he, &amp;c.”</L></Q></P>
<P>I HAVE taken <HI>this</HI> and some <HI>other</HI> liberties with it,
and shall insert it among the rest; unless you chuse
to <HI>redeem</HI> it, with something more to your satisfaction:
<PB N="334" REF="343"/>
for, to speak with frankness, I think it better calcu∣lated
to do <HI>me</HI> honour than <HI>yourself;</HI> though I could
esteem it <HI>good,</HI> if it came from a person whose abili∣ties
I respected less than yours. There is a subject
here, which I would recommend to you, if by so
doing I should lay you under no <HI>restraint.</HI> It is my
principal cascade. Its appearance well resembles the
playfulness of infancy; skipping from side to side,
with a thousand antic motions, that answer no other
purpose than the mere amusement of the proprietor.—
Other similitudes, &amp; c, would here occur;
<Q>“Cui enim nascenti faciles arriserunt Musae, &amp;c.”</Q>
It then proceeds a few hundred yards, where it <HI>rolls</HI>
and <HI>slits iron</HI> for manufactures of all kinds; re∣sembling
the graver toils of manhood, either in ac∣quiring
money, or furnishing the conveniencies, com∣forts,
or ornaments of life: and in this manner it
proceeds, under the name of The Stour, supplying
works for casting, forging and snaping iron, for every
civil or military purpose. Perhaps you may not know
that my rills are the principal sources of this river;
or that this river supplies <HI>more</HI> iron-works than al∣most
any single river in the kingdom: for so my
friend Mr. Knight told me.</P>
<P>THE Mr. D—you enquire after, and who wrote
the <HI>best</HI> address Sir Robert Walpole ever <HI>received,</HI> is
Mr. Dodington.—Did I never send you a list of all
<PB N="335" REF="344"/>
the concealed names in that Miscellany?—I began
to transcribe one from my own set; but find one part
of my list is lost; I however send it, and will piece
it out when I find an opportunity; as I purpose also
to give you some account of our several merits in
Dodsley's Fables. By the way, do not the verses to
Dr. Cornwallis (now Bishop) affect you sensibly, vol.
VI. p. 138?—they do <HI>me,</HI> whenever I read them;
aud I cannot help applying them to myself. I feel
somewhat of the same sensation when I read “The
Letters of Henry and Frances;” in which (from
self-partiality, no doubt) I find myself extremely like
Henry.</P>
<P>PRAY let me hear, if you please, of Mr. Daven∣port.—I
wish I had learnt to <HI>draw</HI> well in early life;
it would have given me some very great advantages.—Let
me hear also much of Mr. Melmoth, who, I
presume, has left you long before this time. I did
once design to have sent you down my proposals for
a subscription, and requested the favour of <HI>you two</HI>
to settle them finally, without any further reference
to myself; but my head and spirits have been too
bad to undertake even a common letter.—What think
you or Dr. Lowth's Grammar?—Livie met him at
Mr. Dodsley's; and says, he is well pleased with <HI>our</HI>
frontispiece, &amp;c. to Horace. Livie could not present
his book to Lord Bute, <HI>himself,</HI> on account of my
Lord's indisposition. Mr. Dalton (Dr. Dalton's bro∣ther),
<PB N="336" REF="345"/>
who teaches the King to draw, presented it.
It seems, this Dr. Dalton (who gave the drawing
of Lord Bute's arms) has lodgings in the palace,
and sees the King every day. <HI>While</HI> Livie was <HI>with</HI>
him, word came that the King was coming into his
room; upon which, Livie was sent out another way.—
The King asked Dalton, whom he had with him?—and
was answered, an editor of Horace, who had
inscribed it to Lord Bute.—Daltqn is to present a
copy to the King,</P>
<P>I INCLOSE to you a specimen of the decorated parts
of Horace, with the frontispiece.—The book will be
published in a month's time, when I mean you a
copy from those that are allotted to me.</P>
<P>MY Lord Bute's arms are unexceptionably well-finished.—
The other plates, either through negli∣gence,
or the wilfulness of the designer and engraver,
have given me infinite trouble and vexation. How∣ever,
with about <HI>two-thirds</HI> of my directions observed,
they will, I hope, afford you some pleasure; and dis∣cover
somewhat more <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> than one com∣monly
finds in such designs.—Send me your remarks
very particularly, I beseech you.</P>

<HEAD>CVII. To the same.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Graves,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Nov. 20, 1762.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>DO I really owe you an apology? you who are
embarrassed with such a number of momen∣tous
concerns, as hardly allow a fair trial to letters of
mere amusement? Alas! I cannot shelter my long
silence under a supposition of this kind. I believe,
I even <HI>hope,</HI> that you have disapproved my long neg∣lect;
as I can very faithfully assure you I have repeated∣ly
done <HI>myself.</HI> There are certain times and seasons
when I have not either the <HI>power</HI> or the <HI>will</HI> to
write: as Hannibal said about attacking Rome,
“quandoque mentem non dari, quandoque potesta∣tem.”
This being an intellectual kind of <HI>lethargy,</HI>
it would have been at least a friendly office, if you
had <HI>rouzed</HI> me, as you <HI>might</HI> have done, by a super∣numerary
letter. I never receive a line from you,
but I feel an almost irresistible propensity to answer
it that very instant. Impediments sometimes occur;
and, that instant being neglected, matter is accumu∣lated
for a longer letter than I am always resolute
enough to undertake: at the same time, I can never
content myself with uttering one half of what I have
to say.—Pray is not that <HI>good sort of man,</HI> to whom
you allude, a Mr. K—? Let him be ever so good a
sort of man in the common estimation, I dare aver
him to be neither an ingenious person nor a candid
<PB N="338" REF="347"/>
critic. There may be fifty or more preferable read∣ing
to what are received in this new Horace; yet he
will find a better <HI>text</HI> there, <HI>upon the whole,</HI> than in
any one edition before extant. As to the <HI>beauty</HI> of
<HI>type</HI> and <HI>press-work,</HI> it is too obvious to need vindi∣cation.
The accuracy of the <HI>latter</HI> almost exceeds
what was ever found in any other book. Then as
to the <HI>frontispiece,</HI> it is, I think, much superior to
such as <HI>ordinarily</HI> occur; the <HI>subject</HI> animated, and
well-chosen; and the <HI>execution</HI> very commendable: at
least if we allow for the <HI>nice</HI> touches which it requir∣ed,
and the <HI>uncommon difficulty</HI> of getting any thing
of this kind done to one's direction.</P>
<P>MR. Walpole is a lively and ingenious writer;
not always accurate in his determinations, and much
less so in his language; too often led away by a de∣sire
of routing prejudices and destroying giants: and
yet there is no province wherein he appears to more
advantage, in <HI>general,</HI> than in throwing new light
upon Characters in British History. I wish he would
compose a regular work, making this his principal
point. He has, with great labour, in his Book of
Painters, recorded matters of little importance, rela∣tive
to people that were of less. I have a right to
be severe, for his volumes cost me above thirty shil∣lings;
yet, where he drops the <HI>antiquarian</HI> in them,
his remarks are striking, and worth perusal.—I have
sent for “Gesner's Rural Poems,” and intend to see
<PB N="339" REF="348"/>
“The Death of Abel;” though I expect to find
small pleasure in this <HI>poetical prose,</HI> unless exquisitely
well-tuned.—Thank you for the anecdote of Lord
Courteney: a thousand such sort of things, that en∣gage
the public attention, are never capable of pene∣trating
the depth of my retirement.</P>
<P>MR. Melmoth you will probably see often, as he
intends to make Bath his place of residence. The
<HI>Omphale</HI> you sent me is a most excellent figure, and I
shall wish much to get a good cast of it; at least,
when I am able to afford it.—When I write again,
I will give you the best account I can of <HI>my share</HI> in
Dodsley's new Fables; though it will be no easy mat∣ter
to speak <HI>separately</HI> of it with any precision.</P>
<P>AND now, I think, I have spoke to most of the ar∣ticles
in your last letter.—Mr. Dodsley, who says he
visited you, would acquaint you how we divided our
time whilst he was here, into two <HI>principal</HI> parts,
“l'un à dormir, l'autre à ne rien faire.” Yet we
paid our devoirs to a good deal of genteel company;
of which this season has afforded me at <HI>least</HI> an equal
share with any that went before. I will particularize
a few; opening the list with no less personages than
the Duke and Dutchess of Richmond—Mr. Walsh,
Member for Worcester—Earl of Bath with Dr. Mon∣son,
Mrs. Mountague (who wrote the three last Dia∣logues
printed with Lord Lyttelton's), and other com∣pany,
<PB N="340" REF="349"/>
from Hagley—Sir Richard Ashley—Mr. Mor∣daunt—
Dr. Charlton with Mr. Knight—Earl and
Countess of Northampton—Mr. Amyand—Lord Ply∣mouth
and Sir Harry Parker—Mr. and Mrs. Morrice
of Percefield—Lord Mansfield with Mr. Baron
smythe, Lord Dartmouth and Mr. Talbot—Marquis
of Tavistock and Earl of Ossory—your nephew Mr.
Graves, with Mr. Hopton and one of the senior
Proctors of Oxford—Lord and Lady Dacre—Baron
Plessen, Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to the King
of Denmark, with a Mr. Wendt his Tutor—Lord and
Lady Vernon of Sudbury with his children, Sir
Charles and Lady Tynte, and Mr. Garrick's brother—Mr.
Melmoth and Mrs. Melmoth—Colonel James—Lady
Ward and Lady Uill, with Miss Wrottesley, Miss
Pigott, &amp;c.—Lord Lyttelton, Mr. Lyttelton, and Mr.
Rust—Lord and Lady Dartmouth with Lord and
Lady Willoughby de Broke—Mr. Anson of Shuck∣burgh
with Mr. Stuart the painter and publisher of
“Athenian Ruins”—Mr. Pepys and Sir W. Wheeler's
son, Mr. Pitt's nephew, &amp;c.—Colonel Bamfylde
with Mr. Knight's Family, &amp;c. &amp;c.—I did not ima∣gine
my list would have engrossed so much of my
paper, and leave so little room to speak about the
individuals.—Lord M—appeared to me rather a <HI>man
of wit</HI> than a <HI>man of taste;</HI> Baron Smythe, the reverse.—Mr.
and Mrs. Morrice, extremely polite and agree∣able
people, invited me pressingly to their habita∣tion;
I could not help reflecting on the singular hap∣piness
<PB N="341" REF="350"/>
of Mr. Morrice, to be possessed at once of a
large fortune, one of the finest situations in England,
and a wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e whose taste for rural improvements appears
even superior to his own; at least, if the <HI>beauty</HI> of
her <HI>person</HI> did not impose upon my judgement. There
are many others whom I would distinguish, if my
time or paper would permit.—I suppose that you
and Mr. Dodsley would be mighty unanimous with
regard to the propriety of setting my subscription on
foot. I do not dispute any of your arguments—they
tally exactly with my own opinion: at least, allowing
for the higher idea you have of my pieces than they
deserve—the truth is, that I have deferred the pub∣lication
too long <HI>already</HI>—till many of the composi∣tions
will not appear to the same advantage as be∣fore,
and till I have not half the power that I had
formerly to improve them. When I am low-spirit∣ed,
I almost shudder at this tremendous contract with
the publick; when my spirits are elevated, I see the
necessity that you do, of not losing a moment's time—were
you here a week, you would put the matter
upon a footing that was unalterable—would to God
you <HI>were</HI> here, or any one <HI>like</HI> you! however, it is
probable you will <HI>soon</HI> hear from me again upon this
very subject—I <HI>know</HI> this, that, <HI>if</HI> I print at <HI>all,</HI> the
subscription is by no means to be neglected this pre∣sent
winter.—I have seen our friend Dr. Charleton
many times this season; at The Leasowes; at Mr.
Knight's; at his own house; and at my Lord Foley's.
<PB N="342" REF="351"/>
This visit to my Lord Foley's was performed about
three weeks ago. I went with young Knight; and
the company of the Doctor and Sir Francis Charleton
took off all restraint, and made the visit perfectly
agreeable. My Lord's behaviour was entirely free
and hospitable; and his conversation lively and en∣tertaining—I
must confess, far beyond the idea which
I have been taught to conceive of him. His table
the most magnificent, I believe, of any Nobleman's
for thirty miles round. His park, and Woobery-hill
adjacent, afford views that are either extensive, wild,
beautiful; or grand. The portico before his lodge
deserves particular notice. His house large, and com∣modious,
and well furnished; but scarce any of the
rooms <HI>high</HI> enough to stand the test of modern criti∣cism.
But what strikes more than all the rest, is the
magnificence of his chapel—which however I cannot
stay to describe; for I this very <HI>moment</HI> receive your
letter.—After having written so much before, I can
only touch upon some few particulars.—I believe,
my scheme of publication will proceed in a little
time, and that you will soon hear from me again.—If
you can possibly excuse me to Mr. Davenport, and
keep me well with him for a week or fortnight, I
will not fail to write him a respectful letter.—I am
truly ashamed of my neglect; but have written more
letters within this week than I have done for a quar∣ter
of a year before.—That there is a faction forming
against Lord B—, I readily believe. The war may
<PB N="343" REF="352"/>
suit the <HI>mercantile</HI> world; and the City of London
has generally the art to represent the <HI>landed</HI> and
<HI>trading</HI> interest as <HI>precisely</HI> the same thing: but I think
there is a very material difference; which it would
be no way difficult to demonstrate—at least I am one
that cry out,
<Q>“Nulla salus bello; pacem te poscimus omnes!”</Q>
I am quite unacquainted with the affair relating to
Colonel Wilkes and Lord Bute's son.—And now
(though I mean to write again soon) I will release
you from this unpleasing scrawl. I beg however
that you would not fail to write to me <HI>directly,</HI> if you
can find leisure; being quite impatient to converse
with you, after such a chasm in our correspondence;
and being, with unvariable affection, my dear friend,
for ever yours.—Pray my best respects to Mrs.

<P>A THOUSAND thanks to you for the very
obliging and humorous Poem which you are so
kind to send me. I really think it very ingenious,
and, upon the whole, extremely correct; although I
have taken the liberty of proposing one or two hints
for farther improvement. The relation that it bears
to me and my place <HI>may</HI> tend to prejudice my <HI>judge∣ment;</HI>
but I cannot conceive that it requires aught
beside <HI>impartiality,</HI> to relish the beauties of this Poem.
I beg I may receive a fair copy in your own hand,
as soon as possible; and I will consider, in the mean
time, how to shew it to the publick in the mod ad∣vantageous
manner. It certainly does me <HI>honour:</HI>
as things are at present circumstanced, it may <HI>tend</HI> to
do me <HI>good;</HI> which I am very sure you would be
glad to see. I am a little ashamed to be so much
behind-hand with you, in favours of <HI>this</HI> and <HI>other</HI>
kinds: but I live in hopes there may come a day,
when I shall find occasion to express my gratitude.
The pictures you sent arrived safe on Thursday: and
have been since cleaned, and put up in their places.
I cannot enter upon this subject now; finding it al∣most
six o'clock at night, and having just received a
letter from Mr. Dodsley which he requires me to an∣swer
by return of post. It relates to the <HI>scheme</HI> men∣tioned
in his last, which is intended for my emolu∣ment;

but which I must not expect to succeed, with∣out
considerable mortification. This <HI>inter nos.</HI>—You
must by no means lay aside the thoughts of perfecting
<HI>Edge-hill,</HI> at your leisure. It is possible that, in order
to keep clear of flattery, I have said less in its fa∣vour
than I really <HI>ought</HI>—but I never considered it
otherwise than as a Poem which it was very advisea∣ble
for you to compleat and <HI>finish.</HI> I am now to de∣sire
my best respects to Mrs. Jago, and to bid you an

The Leasowes,
<DATE>Jan. 4, 1763.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>MR. G—tells me, that you have done me the
honour to lay some stress upon receiving a let∣ter
from me. Alas! it must be owing purely to your
benevolence, which makes you wish to hear of an
absent friend, and not to any expectations you can
reasonably form of entertainment from his pen. The
long letter with which you favoured me was so very
lively as well as ingenious, that I despaired of draw∣ing
<PB N="346" REF="355"/>
from my fountains the vivacity you do from the
Bath waters. But, be this as it will, the vein of
friendship that runs through your letter demands
my amplest acknowledgements; and if you will ac∣cept
of <HI>such</HI> returns, I promise they will be as <HI>hearty</HI>
as they are <HI>insipid.</HI></P>
<P>I AGREE with you, that the first sallies of imagina∣tion
will generally prove the most sprightly, and
that they will often comprehend the principal fea∣tures
of a subject. They are of the nature of dead-colouring
in a portrait; which one sometimes thinks
more spirtted than the same performance when finish∣ed.
And yet a <HI>good</HI> painter will not <HI>hurt</HI> a portrait
by the subsequent labour he bestows upon it, nor
will a <HI>good</HI> writer injure his piece by the pains he
takes to round and perfect it. It must be some de∣fect
in the taste of either that makes his diligence
detrimental, or gives occasion for a stander-by to cry
out, “Manum de tabula.” I believe it will appear
upon examination, that works which cost most labour
have generally been thought the <HI>easiest</HI> and pleased
the <HI>longest.</HI> One cannot, however, deny that there
is a sort of persons formed by nature for <HI>shooting-fly∣ing</HI>
(which, by the way, I could never <HI>do),</HI> and that
their sallies of imagination are what they can hardly
improve by any future pains. These may be called
men of wit and fire, but it is the union of <HI>taste</HI> with
these that constitutes fine writing. True taste will
<PB N="347" REF="356"/>
never stiffen or over-charge any performance: it will
rather be employed to smooth, simplify, and give that
ease on which <HI>grace</HI> depends. One can as little de∣ny
that there are <HI>kinds</HI> of writing which have a bet∣ter
chance than others to succeed without much la∣bour,
which start forth mature at <HI>first,</HI> as Pallas did
from the brain of Jupiter. Works of <HI>humour</HI> are of∣ten
of this sort; and there are many instances in But∣ler's
Hudibras. Yet I think the humour of <HI>Swift</HI>
was greatly owing to a judicious <HI>revisal.</HI>—Pardon
me, my dear friend, for this tedious discussion, which
you little thought of bringing upon yourself by the
obliging hint you gave concerning those verses upon
Venus. I do acknowledge that an additional stanza
there, containing a reflexion on Chinese architecture,
were better laid aside. It seemed to me one of the
“splendida peccata,” that might be a little <HI>popular</HI>
at this <HI>time;</HI> and has, therefore, for this season, ap∣peared
on a board by the side of the Venus. We,
who cannot erect fresh temples, or even add a new
garden-seat every spring, are obliged to make the
most we can of a new and tolerable copy of verses,
that costs us <HI>thought</HI> instead of <HI>money;</HI> and even at a
pinch to piece out a dull scene with duller poetry:
how else could I keep my place in countenance, so
near the pompous piles of Hagley? And yet there
are few <HI>fashionable</HI> visitants that do not shew an <HI>af∣fection</HI>
for the little Amoret, as much as they admire
the slately Sacharissa—“plerumque gratae <HI>divitibus
<PB N="348" REF="357"/>
vices.</HI>” I have often considered why those pos∣sessed
of palaces yet esteem a root-house or a
cottage
as a desireable object in their gardens.—Is it not
from
having experienced the imperfection of happiness in
higher life, that they are led to <HI>conceive</HI> it more
com∣pleat
beneath a roof of straw; where, perhaps, it
may really be as defective as in the apartments of a
King or a Minister?—A thousand thanks to you and
Mrs. Davenport <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the accommodations you so kind∣ly
offer me. Experience will no more suffer me
to
question the <HI>cordiality</HI> than the politeness of
your re∣ception.
What an amusing picture have you given
of Bath! pleasures carried to the utmost height,
and
opiates ready when one is cloyed with pleasures!
And yet let me confess a truth, you have <HI>lightly</HI>
touched upon those <HI>very</HI> articles which would
prove
to me the most <HI>specifically</HI> pleasing. For can
any
temptation be stronger, than to say that <HI>you</HI>
reside
there? and does not my friend G—reside at Claver∣ton,
of whose genius and friendship I have had
proofs
these twenty years past? and have you not Mr.
Webb, and now Mr. Melmoth, to make Bath <HI>envia∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e</HI>
for the residence of literature? What a joy would
it afford me to go on a party with you to Percefield,
whither Mr. and Mrs. Morrice gave me the most
pressing invitations!—These surely are pleasures of
which—I <HI>hope</HI> one day to partake.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="358"/>
MY health, generally bad in winter and spring,
has hitherto been tolerable. The <HI>influenza</HI> of last
spring continued to depress me half the summer.
Would you think the verses I inclosed were written
on that occasion by a young journeyman shoe-maker:
and one that lives at the village of Rowley, near
me? He considered my disorder in somewhat too
<HI>grave</HI> a light, as I did not think my life endangered
by it; but, allowing for this, and the <HI>partiality</HI> he
shews <HI>me,</HI> you will think the lines pretty extraordinary
for one of <HI>his occupation.</HI> They are not, however,
the <HI>only,</HI> or, perhaps, the <HI>chief</HI> specimens of his ge∣nius;
and yet, before he came tome, his principal
knowledge was drawn from <HI>Magazines.</HI> For these:
two or three years past, I have lent him Classics, and
other books in English. You see, to <HI>him,</HI> I am a
great Maecenas; although you and my friend expect
me to become an author by subscription. On this
head I will say no more at <HI>present,</HI> than that I am
infinitely obliged by your extreme friendly offers.
My friend G—, who knows my sentiments, has some∣times
the honour of waiting upon you; I ought not,
therefore, after this tedious epistle, to begin to trouble
you with a written explanation of them. Believe me,
dear Sir, with my molt respectful compliments to Mrs.
Davenport,</P>

<HEAD>CX. To Mr. JAGO.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Mr. Jago,
The Leasowes,
<DATE>Jan. 4, 1763.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>MY last letter mull have been confused, and the
arrival of it, I fear, uncertain.</P>
<P>THE hare and birds, in one of the pictures which
you sent me, I think, are well; the other parts of
it indifferent; the greyhound worst of all. The
portrait is by no means equal to its companion, ei∣ther
in beauty of the person, or skill of the painter;
yet it matches so well with the other, that I find
my parlour very much embellished by it. Pardon
the freedom with which I criticise your present; and
accept once more my very thankful acknowledge∣ments.</P>
<P>I AM truly glad to find so worthy a Nobleman,
and so warm a friend of yours, as my Lord Willough∣by
is, made a Lord of the Bed-chamber.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard nothing since I wrote last in regard
to <HI>my</HI> affair; though I expect to do so every day.
I have such a tribe of humours and peculiarities, that
<PB N="351" REF="360"/>
it is easier to make me rich than to make me hap∣py;
and ten to one that the favour will not be con∣ferred
without disgusting some of these said humours,
&amp;c. However, one mull make the best of it; and
reflect, that mortifications in one place may preclude
mortifications in another.</P>
<P>I GO to-morrow, by appointment, to Enville;
where I may probably stay till Saturday. I have wish∣ed
most heartily for a copy of your Fable to take
with me; but Dodsley has not yet returned that I
sent him. Pray consider my proposed alterations ra∣ther
as hints than real improvements, and let me
have a copy as soon you can. I wrote my criticism
over twice, and know not whether I sent the best or
the worst copy; so I send the other, though perhaps
much the same. I forgot to particularize many shin∣ing
parts in your little Fable, that are either elegant
or humourous: of the former sort, nothing could
be happier than what you say about H—; as it
touches, in the <HI>gentlest</HI> manner, on a possible truth,
which, if expressed rather than implied, might not
be altogether inoffensive. This beauty is produced
by substituting H—instead of L—, the place instead
of the proprietor.</P>
<P>I HAVE lately read “The Death of Abel.” It is
not void of merit; but might have been made much
more pathetic by a more simple and prosaic style.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="361"/>
I DESIRE my best respects to Mrs. Jago and your
family.—May not I see you here this Christmas?
as I wish to do, because it is the season present; and
not that I am not at all times and at all seasons most
unfeignedly glad to wait upon you, and most af∣fectionately
your ever faithful servant:
<Q><L>“Tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles,</L>
<L>Et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes.</L>
<L>Unum opus, &amp; requiem pariter disponimus am∣bo,
&amp;c.”</L></Q>
Your kind remembrance of me in your Edge-hill
has brought these quotations into my head. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>CXI. To the same.</HEAD>
<OPENER>My good friend,
<DATE>Jan. 11, 1763.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM suspicious that my letters (of which I have
sent two) do not reach you by the way of War∣wick.
This is meant as an experiment whether
they will arrive by way of Southam. It is meant
withall to remind you of perfecting your little Fable,
and dispatching it to me as soon as may be. I
would fain transmit a copy to Lord S—'s, before
<PB N="353" REF="362"/>
the family separates, or leaves Enville; by whom,
I am sure, it would be admired.</P>
<P>I AM just returned from a visit which I made there,
of four or five days passed very happily. At com∣ing
away, I shewed my Lord two or three of Mr.
D—'s last letters, which laid open to him the scheme
that was carrying on for me. I requested also, if
there should be occasion (which there possibly might <HI>not</HI>) that he would allow me the honour of being
known to him. He said, “he was glad to find what
was going forward; and had long wished to see
something of that sort begun before: that he
should be in town, I think, in February; and
would do me any service in his power. He de∣sired
me also to acquaint Mr. D—(in allusion
to the latter's uncertainly about my Lord's politi∣cal
connexions) that he thought it the duty. of
every honest man to support the present Govern∣ment;
and that he should continue his regard for
the Minister, so long as he saw nothing in his mea∣sures
that was prejudicial to his Country.”</P>
<P>I KNOW that you will take a friendly part in any
good that may befall me. Pray write, be it ever so
carelessly; and believe me ever yours and Mrs. Jago's
most affectionate and faithful</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>W. S.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
