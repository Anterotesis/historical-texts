<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER expressing my Gratitude to the Pub∣lick for the kind reception they have given to Miss Honeycombe, and returning thanks to the Performers for their care and uncommon excellence in the Representation, I did not think of adding any thing further by way of Preface: but my Publisher insists on the necessity of my saying some∣thing in behalf of the Piece, which, I think, ought to speak for itself, and that my friend's scheme is much of the same colour with Bayes's practice of printing papers <HI>to insinuate the plot into the Boxes</HI>. It has been usual with the Writers of the French Theatre, it is true, to tack Examens of their Plays, like a sting or <HI>melius non tangere</HI> to the Cri∣ticks, to the tail of them. But why need an Eng∣lish Author put himself to that trouble, when the learned and impartial gentlemen of the Reviews are so ready to take it off his hands, unless it were, like Dryden, to turn the thunder of the Critick's own artillery against himself, and to confute or anticipate his censures, by proving the Fable, Cha∣racters, Sentiments, and Language, to be excel∣lent, or, if indeed there were some parts of it in∣ferior to the rest, such parts were purposely <HI>un∣derwritten</HI>, in order to set off the superior to more advantage? This, indeed, Dryden has often done, and done so inimitably; that I shall not attempt
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
it after him. To the Gentlemen, therefore, above∣mentioned, the self-impannelled Jury of the Eng∣lish Court of Criticism, without Challenge, I put myself on my Trial for the High Crime of wri∣ting for the Stage, trusting that their candour will send me a good deliverance.</P>
<P>I could, indeed, in compliance with the request of my Publisher, have obliged the Publick, by printing, entire, an original Manuscript, now in my possession, containing several strictures on the following scenes; being no other than a Letter from my Mother, occasioned by the first night's representation, which, like most other first nights, was nothing more than a Publick Rehearsal, with ten thousand fears and apprehensions, that never attend a private one. The Good Gentlewoman, hurt at the confusion, and in pain for my success, tells me with much warmth, and as dogmatically as any Male Critick could possibly do, that She is astonished at my attempting to violate the received laws of the Drama—That the <HI>Catastrophe</HI> (that was really her word) is directly contrary to all known rules—That the several Characters, instead of being dismissed, one by one, should have been industriously kept together, to make a bow to the audience at the dropping of the curtain—That, notwithstanding any confusion, created by the Girl's whimsical passion for Novels, in the course of the Piece, all parties should be perfectly reconciled to each other at last. Polly, having manifested her af∣fection for him, should, to be sure, have been mar∣ried to Scribble; and the Parents should have been thoroughly, though suddenly, appeased by the declared reformation of both. Ledger might, with much propriety and great probability, have been disposed of to the Nurse: and the whole
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
Piece, instead of concluding bluntly with a sen∣tence in Prose, should have been tagged with a Couplet or Two; and then every thing would have gone off smoothly and roundly, <HI>á lá mode du Tháatre</HI>.</P>
<P>Having thus presented the Publick with a small specimen of my good Mother's talents for Criti∣cism, I shall not, by attempting to answer them, heap Remarks upon Remarks; rather chusing to leave Her and all other Criticks, Male and Female, to meditate on the following extract from Ben Jonson; but must, at the same time, desire not to be understood to take to myself that confidence, with which He presumes to speak of his own abi∣lities.</P>
<P><Q>“Though my Catastrophe may, in the strict rigour of Comick Law, meet with censure; I desire the learned and charitable Critick, to have so much faith in me, to think it was done of industry: for, with what ease I could have va∣ried it nearer his scale (but that I fear to boast ”my own faculty) I could here insert."</Q> To this quotation I shall add a short story, and then con∣clude my Preface with the remainder of my good Mother's Letter. The Story is as follows:</P>
<P>A Nobleman of Madrid, being present at the Spanish Comedy, fell asleep during the first act, and never woke again till the end of the play. Then rubbing his eyes, and observing his friends laughing at the hearty nap he had taken, be cried out, <HI>How now? Gentlemen! What! Is it</HI> OVER <HI>then? Are the Actors all</HI> MARRIED?</P>
<P>The remainder of the Letter is in these words:</P>
<P>—<Q>“And then I was the more alarmed at this unseasonable attempt at Novelty, lest it should put it out of my power to preserve my
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
credit with my worthy friend, Mr. Lutestring, the silk-mercer, in Cheapside. You know, Child, that just after you had informed me of Polly Honeycombe's being in rehearsal, a late me∣lancholy event put the whole nation into deep Mourning. The things, which I made up three years ago, on account of the death of the Princess of Orange, having since been used on several other occasions, could by no means be rendered capable of going through the present Mourning: a six months mourning! quite a thing impossible. This gave me some little unea∣siness, especially as I had just got my Blue-Tabby cleaned for the winter's wear. However, I did not doubt but that, on the strength of your Farce, my good friend Lutestring would give me credit for two and twenty yards of Bombazine, to make me up a sack and petticoat; and accord∣ingly I went immediately up to his house. When I got there, Mr. Lutestring was not at home; but the Young Man very civily desired me to walk into the little parlour behind the shop, till his master's return, and there I found Mrs. Lutestring, who received me with her usual good-nature. The Good Woman was sitting alone (the Two Girls being gone, it seems, to see the scaffolding in Westminster Abbey) in∣dustriously emyloyed in making up her own Mourning; but her Daughters' Gowns, just come from the Mantua-Maker's, lay in the window; and black caps, black fans, black gloves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the milliner's, were scattered carelesly about the table, together with three or four books, half-bound, and a bulky pamphlet. These I had the curiosity to examine, and found them to be, (though much thumbed, and in a greasy con∣dition,
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
indeed, for the perusal of such fine la∣dies) the first volume of the Adventures of Mr. Loveil, the third volume of Betsy Thought∣less, the New Atalantis for the year 1760, and the Catalogue of the Circulating Library. The books I was too well acquainted with to be tempted to any further perusal of them; but (on Mrs. Lutestring's being called into the shop to speak to a particular customer) I made the in∣closed Extract from the Catalogue, which, as it falls exactly in with your design, I now send for your consideration. Heaven bless you, My Dear Child! and send that your Farce may do some ”good on the Giddy Girls of this Age!</Q></P>

<P>Why so I do; but I'm reading this now—<STAGE><HI>Look∣ing into the book.</HI></STAGE> "She raved, but the baronet"—I really think I love Mr. Scribble as well as Emilia did sir George.—Do you think, Nursee, I should have had such a good notion of love so early, if I had not read Novels?—Did not I make a conquest of Mr. Scribble in a single night at a dancing? But my cross Papa will hardly ever let me go out. —And then, I know life as well as if I had been in the Beau Monde all my days. I can tell the nature of a masquerade as well as if I had been at twenty. I long for a mobbing scheme with Mr. Scribble to the two-shilling gallery, or a snug party a little way out of town, in a post-chaise— and then, I have such a head full of intrigues and contrivances!

<P>Why, a scheme to bring matters to issue at once. I was in hopes of securing you for ever, this very day.—I intended to have stolen slily down stairs with you, made a silent escape into the street, have squeezed you into a chair in a twinkling, had you conveyed to my lodging, and have strutted thither with a "By your leave, gemmin!" before your chair, in this livery.</P>

<P>Why, Papa, don't you know that every gentle∣man disguises himself in the course of an amour? —Don't you remember that Bob Lovelace dis∣guised himself like an old man? And Tom Ram∣ble like an old woman?—No Adventure can be carried on without it.</P>

<P>Lord, Papa, what signifies whose nephew he is? He may be ne'er the worse for that.—Who knows but he may be a Foundling, and a gentleman's son, as well as Tom Jones?—My mind is resolved, —And nothing shall ever alter it.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Miss POPE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter, as <HI>POLLY</HI>, laughing—<HI>Ha! ha! ha!</HI>—</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>MY poor Papa's in woeful agitation—</L>
<L>While I, the Cause, feel here, <STAGE><HI>striking her bosom.</HI></STAGE> no palpitation—</L>
<L>We Girls of Reading, and superior notions,</L>
<L>Who from the fountain-head drink love's sweet potions,</L>
<L>Pity our parents, when such passion blinds 'em,</L>
<L>One hears the good folks rave—One never minds 'em.</L>
<L>Till these dear books infus'd their soft ingredients,</L>
<L>Asham'd and fearful, I was all Obedience.</L>
<L>Then my good Father did not storm in vain,</L>
<L>I blush'd and cry'd—<HI>I'll ne'er do so again:</HI></L>
<L>But now no bugbears can my spirit tame,</L>
<L>I've conquer'd Fear—And almost conquer'd Shame;</L>
<L>So much these Dear Instructors change and win us,</L>
<L>Without their <HI>light</HI> we ne'er should know what's in us:</L>
<L>Here we at once supply our childish wants—</L>
<L><HI>NOVELS</HI> are Hotbeds for your forward Plants.</L>
<L>Not only Sentiments refine the Soul,</L>
<L>But hence we learn to be the Smart and Drole;</L>
<L>Each awkward circumstance for laughter serves,</L>
<L>From Nurse's nonsense to my Mother's <HI>NERVES</HI>:</L>
<L>Tho' Parents tells us, that our genius lies</L>
<L>In mending linnen and in making pies,</L>
<L><PB REF="60"/>I set such formal precepts at defiance</L>
<L>That preach up prudence, neatness, and compliance:</L>
<L>Leap these old bounds, and boldly set the pattern,</L>
<L>To be a Wit, Philosopher, and Slattern—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! did all Maids and Wives, my spirit feel,</L>
<L>We'd make this topsy-turvy world to reel:</L>
<L>Let us to arms!—Our Fathers, Husbands, dare!</L>
<L><HI>NOVELS</HI> will teach us all the Art of War:</L>
<L>Our Tongues will serve for Trumpet and for Drum;</L>
<L>I'll be your Leader—General <HI>HONEYCOMBE!</HI></L>
<L>Too long has human nature gone astray,</L>
<L>Daughters should govern, Parents should obey;</L>
<L>Man shou'd submit, the moment that he weds,</L>
<L>And hearts of oak shou'd yield to wiser heads:</L>
<L>I see you smile, bold <HI>Britons!</HI>—But 'tis true—</L>
<L>Beat <HI>You</HI> the <HI>French;</HI>—But let your <HI>Wives</HI> beat <HI>You</HI>.—</L>
