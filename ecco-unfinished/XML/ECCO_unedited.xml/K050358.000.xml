<HEAD>THE TRADE TO <HI>INDIA</HI> Critically and Calmly consider'd.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>FTER all the Arguments which have been used, on one Side as well as on the other, in the <HI>Callicoe Con∣troversy</HI> now on Foot, have, as it were, been summ'd up, and laid before the House of Commons, and when we thought there had been little more to do than to wait the Resolutions
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
of the House, and receive from thence a conclusive Sentence: I say, after all this is done and over, we are attack'd a-new with powerful Applications, I do not say powerful Reasonings, drawn from the Usefulness and Advantages of the <HI>East India Trade.</HI></P>
<P>This is the more surprizing, because they say 'tis done in Behalf of the <HI>East India Company.</HI> Many People real∣ly think there is so little to be said on that Head to the Company's Advan∣tage, that it was always thought they would have been wiser, and had known their Interest better, than to bring that Dispute upon the Stage, especially on this Occasion of the <HI>Callicoes.</HI> It is sur∣prizing I say also, because in all the Disputes about the <HI>Callicoes,</HI> the Weav∣ers and Manufacturers have let the <HI>East India</HI> Company alone, as to the Consi∣deration of their own Conduct, or the Trade in general: In short, they have never attack'd either the Company or the Trade, 'till these Men even forc'd the Discourse of both into the Contro∣versy, by insisting upon the Merit of both, and that in a Manner, which no People, <HI>that had really so little to say for it,</HI> would have ventur'd to do, unless they were under some Infatuation, or
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
the ill Influence of some Star, which pointed against them, and makes their being expos'd inevitable.</P>
<P>Nay, so far the Manufacturers have been from designing to concern the Company, or their general Com∣merce, in the present Dispute, that in the first Book which was publish'd in this Cause, entitl'd, <HI>A brief State of the Question;</HI> and in the very Introduction to that Book, it was laid down among the general Maxims, as a Fundamental, that the Trade to the <HI>East Indies</HI> was less concern'd in the Dispute than was generally imagin'd; that the Company might go on and flourish, though all that the Manufacturers ask'd were to be granted. In a Word, the <HI>East India</HI> Company, or their Trade, seem'd un∣concern'd in the Dispute, unless we must suppose the Jobbing of their Stock to be call'd the <HI>East India</HI> Trade, and the Brokers to be the Company, which I cannot admit; I repeat it therefore again from the Book call'd <HI>The brief State of the Question,</HI> &amp;c. the Words are these:</P>
<P>That the total Prohibiting the Wearing and Using of Printed or Painted Callicoes in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is not ruinous to or in∣consistent with the Prosperity of the <HI>East</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<HI>India</HI> Trade; or, <HI>to put it into an Affir∣mative, that may be more capable of Evidence,</HI> the <HI>East India</HI> Trade may and would remain in a very thriving and flou∣rishing Condition, and be carry'd on to the Profit and Advantage of the Adventurers, tho' all the Subjects of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and of <HI>Ireland</HI> were effectually limited from and prohibited the Wearing and Using of Print∣ed and Painted Callicoes.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable, and deserves to be taken Notice of here, that in all that is said of or for the <HI>East India</HI> Trade, the Advocates for it rather apply them∣selves to answer and clear up the Ob∣jections continually rais'd against it, than to advance any Thing new or substantial in its Favour: This proves that the present Case is not the only Occasion there has been to complain of the injurious Effects of this Trade.</P>
<P>The great Question is plainly laid down thus, Whether the Trade, as now carry'd on to <HI>India,</HI> or to the <HI>East In∣dies,</HI> is profitable to the Nation, or whether it is not.</P>
<P>But, before I enter upon the Que∣stion, I must openly and professedly di∣stinguish upon the Thing we are talk∣ing of; for I am certain, if we do not agree upon the Subject, we shall never
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
agree upon the Argument; and, I be∣lieve most of our Wrangling is for Want of determining first what it is we are talking of: My Distinction is this:</P>
<P>I say, we must <HI>distinguish</HI> here be∣tween the <HI>East India</HI> COMPANY and the <HI>East India</HI> TRADE: The Mistake here is the Foundation of all that Cavil and Talk, to little Purpose, which we have had on this Occasion; the Diffe∣rence is plain; the <HI>East India</HI> TRADE is one Thing, the <HI>East India</HI> COMPANY <HI>tradeing</HI> is another.</P>
<P>I grant what was formerly voted by the House of Commons in 1694, That <HI>it is most for our Interest that the</HI> Trade <HI>to the</HI> East Indies <HI>be carry'd on by an exclusive Company:</HI> But this has no Re∣lation to the main Question, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether <HI>Trade itself,</HI> whether with a Company or without a Company, <HI>is an advan∣tageous Trade?</HI></P>
<P>Again, we must distinguish between the Trade in Callicoes and Wrought Silks from <HI>India,</HI> on the one Hand, and the whole <HI>East India</HI> Trade, consider'd complexly.</P>
<P>But the officious Advocates for the Callicoes, will not suffer the <HI>East India</HI> Trade to be so passive or neutral in this Case as they ought to be; but as
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
an Argument to support the Use of Callicoes, they bring the Company in∣to the Debate, and, at last, they have petition'd to be heard.</P>
<P>It will be, as it were, but by Acci∣dent, that we embark the Cause of the Callicoes and <HI>East India</HI> Silks in this Debate: That the Callicoes are de∣structive to our Woollen and Silk Ma∣nufactures, have lessen'd their Consump∣tion, beaten several Sorts of their Goods quite out of Trade; and that the Broad Cloth and Stuff Trade, in particular, are still more and more declining up∣on that Account, <HI>has been prov'd at the Bar of the House,</HI> and at the Board of Trade; and the Report of the Lords-Commissioners of Trade makes it out farther, thus:</P>
<Q><P>It being therefore self-evident, that Print∣ed and Stained Callicoes and Linnens are used and worn, by almost all Sorts of Peo∣ple in this Kingdom, and that every Piece so worn prevents the Consumption of the same Quantity of our Woollen and Silk Manufa∣ctures, we must conclude, that the Complain∣ants have been and are exceedingly discou∣raged, and their Trade prejudiced thereby.</P></Q>
<P>But 'tis the Trade to <HI>India</HI> in general, not the Callicoes, that is now the Que∣stion, and whether it may pass under
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
that Title of a beneficial Trade to the Nation, or not.</P>
<P>If my Answer to this might distin∣guish rightly of the Company's Cir∣cumstances, I should, after some Regu∣lations, vote in Favour of the Trade; and I will not doubt, but, with necessary Limitations, it might be allow'd to be an advantageous Trade: But without those Limitations, I cannot venture to call it so, by any Means; but, on the contrary, a Trade destructive to the Prosperity of our Country, not only in the Woollen and Silk Manufactures, but many other Ways besides. What those Limitations are, will appear in the Consequence of this Discourse.</P>
<P>There are but two Things, which, in this Case, can denominate a foreign Trade gainful to the Nation.</P>
<P N="1">I. That it exports that which it is the Advantage of the Kingdom to ex∣port.</P>
<P N="2">II. That it returns, or imports, some∣thing of which we consume little at Home, and export much.</P>
<P>The <HI>East India</HI> Trade, <HI>I fear,</HI> will be able to claim neither of these Qualifi∣cations;
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
but, on the contrary, it ex∣ports, or sends out of the Nation, that <HI>which answers all Things,</HI> and brings back that which amounts to <HI>little</HI> or <HI>nothing;</HI> and it is in this Particular that the Merit of the whole Cause will lye.</P>
<P>Give the Advocates for the Trade to <HI>India</HI> their Due; they do not pre∣tend to any Merit on Account of their Exportations; they did dwell upon it a little formerly; but they now give up that Point. <HI>I</HI> doubt 60000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, <HI>if I should allow so much,</HI> will go near to be as great a Sum as they will claim to export in Manufactures, one Year with another: As to other Things, they are rather Trifles for the Use of their Factories, than for a Market; such as Wine, Beer, Bottles, wrought Iron and Brass for Houshold-Stuff, and a few Manufactures for their own Wearing. The Company, indeed, perhaps to make a Show for that Occasion, have just now made two Entries of Woollen Ma∣nufactures, amounting to 4000 long Cloths, and 5000 Perpetuana's; but this is suppos'd to be to make a Show, and we must look far back for such another Entry. It has been said, they are oblig'd by their Charter to export 100000 <HI>l.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<HI>per Annum</HI> in Woollen Manufactures: It is said likewise, that they are limited, by the same Authority, to export no more than 300000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> in Bullion, neither of which Conditions they have observ'd, if the Report of the Lords-Commissioners be to be depended upon, <HI>as I see no Reason to question it:</HI> By this Report, the very last Year's Exporta∣tions of the <HI>East India</HI> Trade (for here the Company may be call'd the Trade) amounts to but 83179 <HI>l.</HI> 14 <HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d.</HI> tho' by far the greatest Year of their Ex∣ports, since 1715; by the last Year is meant 1718, the Account of 1719 having not been obtain'd; and the same Year they exported in Bullion 602844 <HI>l.</HI> 8 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> besides what they exported which was not enter'd, and besides what is carry'd out in private Trade; which two Articles, some tell us, amount to half the Sum; so that their Exporta∣tion of Silver must then amount to 904266 <HI>l.</HI> 12 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d. per Ann.</HI> as to their Exportation of Bullion, the Account is most surprizing, indeed, and a bold Trespass upon the Law, if they are bound to export no more Bullion than, as above.</P>
<P>The Account above is taken out of their own Books, and reported by the
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Lords-Commissioners of Trade. But it appears, that in the Year 1717, they exported 875, 534 <HI>l.</HI> 16 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> pub∣lickly, besides all unenter'd and con∣ceal'd, which, by the same Account, must be above 1200000 <HI>l.</HI> in the Whole. Considering then their Trade to stand thus, they may be said to export 16 seventeenth Parts in Silver, and 1 seven∣teenth Part only in Manufactures. We are in Debt to their Modesty so much, as to acknowledge that they do not claim any Thing upon the Account of their Exportations; so the first Point is clear, namely, they do not <HI>export that which it is our Advantage to have exported.</HI></P>
<P>The only Plea then that the Compa∣ny can make for the <HI>India Trade, (for while I speak of the Company, I shall stick to what they plead themselves)</HI> is upon their Imports; and I will put it as fair for them as can be desir'd, namely, <HI>That they export again such great Quan∣tities of the Goods which they bring Home,</HI> as sufficiently <HI>answers the Quantity or Value of the Bullion they send away to the</HI> Indies; and upon this Foot, they would take off effectually, <HI>if the Fact were but true,</HI> all the Complaint made of their Exportation of Bullion: It must be acknowledg'd that if this Plea could be
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
made good, they would gain a great Point; for whatever Goods the Trade from <HI>India</HI> sends Abroad, to be consum'd in foreign Parts, ought to be reckon'd clear Gain to the national Stock as to the Trade; and the Publick would owe them so much Money in Specie; so that then their exporting so much Bullion, as the Value of those Goods amounted to, would be no Trespass upon the nati∣onal Stock, only taking out with one Hand what they put in with the other; tho' even in this Case it wou'd not ap∣pear that the Trade was gainful to the Publick, any farther than the Balance arising from their Exportations, exceed∣ed the Bullion they exported; for if they carry'd out all they brought in, what Gain could they be to the Pub∣lick, which is the main Question in Hand: Indeed, then they would plead the Merit of all the Manufactures which they export, as above, besides that of bringing Home several useful Things for our Home Consumption, which we can∣not well be without; such as, Salt Pe∣ter, Pepper, Drugs, Dye, Stuffs, Coffee, Tea, Raw Silk, &amp;c. This, I think, is the full of what they alledge.</P>
<P>But I shall answer this two Ways, and, I think, both shall confute them effectually: <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<HI>First,</HI> I'll suppose, that they really do export the full Quantity or Value of Goods which they say they do; their Ac∣count which was publish'd in their Fa∣vour, says, That for five Years, from <HI>Christmas</HI> 1712 to <HI>Christmas</HI> 1717, there was exported 3, 335, 928 <HI>l.</HI> Value in im∣ported <HI>India</HI> Goods: Whether the Va∣luation of these Goods is made before the Duties are drawn back, or after, we do not know; but I will suppose it was without the Duties, which is still in their Favour: The Pretence against this is, that the Bullion exported is not so much as those Goods exported in the same Time, by 1, 699, 671 <HI>l.</HI> But the Fal∣lacy of all this will appear, by giving a more exact Account; for</P>
<P>1<HI>st,</HI> This Account is unjust, the five Years of Export of Bullion being not the same five Years of the Export of Goods: What the Reason of that Fraud is, I know not; the five Years of Ex∣port of Bullion he reckons from the 29th of <HI>September</HI> 1711 to the 29th of <HI>September</HI> 1716; but for the Goods ex∣ported he reckons from 1712 to 1717.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
2<HI>dly,</HI> This Export of Bullion is false, and is only of the Bullion enter'd at the Custom-House by the Company, which all the World knows is not the Quantity of Bullion carry'd away by the Trade by a great deal: What the rest may be, we know, and shall give a particular Ac∣count of, with the Exports of the fol∣lowing Years, at the End of this Work.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, to go back to a juster Authority for their Bullion exported, we have the Abstract of the Bullion ex∣ported, taken by the Lords Commission∣ers of Accompts, as above, and laid before the Parliament; and to which I refer.</P>
<P>There it appears, that at a Medium of four Years, taken from 1715 to 1718, inclusive, the Company exported in Bullion 467, 227 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P><TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>Which in five Years Time, to make up the Time they charge their Re-exportation of <HI>East India</HI> Goods, is</CELL>
<CELL>5</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL></CELL>
<CELL>2, 335, 135</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Add to this half as much exported, but not enter'd at the Custom-House, as well by the Company as by pri∣vate Trade, is—</CELL>
<CELL>1, 167, 567½</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Which, indeed, is too little.</CELL>
<CELL></CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Total</CELL>
<CELL>3, 502, 702 <HI>l.</HI></CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
So that the Export of Bullion, in five Years, exceeds the Export of <HI>India</HI> Goods in the same Length of Time 166, 774 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>But what Need this Boasting! I shall next prove, that if it were true, that they exported more Goods than they sent Bullion away, yet, that every Groat of that Bullion remain'd unpaid for, and, by Consequence, was so much pick'd out of the Nation's Pocket, and a dead Loss to the publick Stock.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I shall therefore wave these Niceties of Accompts, and come to the Facts; and, 1<HI>st, (for I shall do it two Ways)</HI> there is great Reason to know, and be assur'd, that so great a Part of these Goods, re-exported, or said to be re-ex∣ported, are not really sent away, but are relanded in <HI>England;</HI> or, if they are really exported, are clandestinely brought back, and consum'd at Home: And, if this be prov'd, where will the Balance of the Exports be then, that should answer the Bullion?</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> Add to this the infinite Quan∣tity of <HI>East India</HI> Goods imported upon us from <HI>Holland</HI> and other Parts; <HI>for this,</HI> to us, <HI>is a Part of the</HI> East India <HI>Trade;</HI> all which Goods are paid for, either with the Produce of those other
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<HI>East India</HI> Goods which we export, or, in Defect thereof, with Money, which is the same Thing.</P>
<P>Some have computed, that the Quan∣tities of <HI>East India</HI> Goods, run in upon us from <HI>Holland,</HI> and consum'd here, are not only equal in Value to all the Goods of our Company's exporting from hence, but much superior to them: Where then is our Bullion pro∣cur'd? In short, the Bullion is then only bought with Bullion; that is to say, is taken away from the Balance of other Branches of our Trade, which are advantageous, and which supply it: But as to the <HI>India</HI> Trade, it does no∣thing for us.</P>
<P>If ever the Use and Wearing of Cal∣licoes and Silks comes to be prohibited, all this Mystery of Iniquity will be discover'd, or will discover it self. It is impossible it should be then hid; for no Body will import the Goods which no Body will buy; and no Body will buy the Goods which no Body will wear.</P>
<P>But this is not all; for if <HI>this Trade</HI> does nothing <HI>well</HI> for us, it must do much <HI>ill</HI> against us; for there are no neutral Trades which do neither Good or Hurt. The Character of this Trade is, in
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
short, what was printed of it near 20 Years ago, by an Author that examin'd it to the Bottom, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That it carry'd out that <HI>which answers all Things,</HI> and brings back that which evidently <HI>proves the Destruction of our own Manufactures.</HI></P>
<P>These are short but pungent Argu∣ments against the Benefit of the <HI>East India</HI> Trade in general, and are drawn up thus.</P>
<P N="1">1 Suppose the Company, with their Ser∣vants and Officers, export yearly, as a∣bove, 904266 <HI>l.</HI> 1 2 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> in Bullion: The Quantity of Goods they bring Home is very great, their Sales make that ap∣pear: But 'tis also certain that the greatest Part of those Goods are for the Home Consumption; so that 'tis doubtful whether they export any Thing consi∣derable, but what is clandestinely re∣turn'd upon us and consum'd here, and that too after the Government has been defrauded of the Duty: Let us exa∣mine it critically.</P>
<P>The Principal Quantity of their Callicoes are exported to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh:</HI> 'Tis hard to judge what they are sent thither for, since from thence <HI>it is too sad a Truth,</HI> a very great Quantity of Callicoes and <HI>East India</HI> Wrought Silks are brought in
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
upon us, by private Methods, without paying Custom at all.</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, be ask'd here, If the Methods by which it is done are pri∣vate and conceal'd, how then does it appear to be so? since if it was sure that there were such Things done, the same Method, by which the Charge is prov'd, would discover and prevent it: But this is a Fallacy in itself, and is found so by the Nature of the Thing; for it is known by its Consequences as effectu∣ally as if it was known by the Disco∣very of the particular Facts. <HI>For Ex∣ample:</HI></P>
<P>The Report of the Commissioners of Accompts lays it down as a just Cal∣culation, that a Million of People wear Printed Callicoes and Painted Linnens in <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that they con∣sume five Yards <HI>per Ann.</HI> to each Per∣son, one with another, great and small; so that by this Account, five Millions of Yards of Callicoes and Linnens, printed and painted, are con∣sum'd in a Year.</P>
<P>Of this Quantity they allow again three Fourth Parts to be Callicoes, and one Fourth Part Linnens; so that there remains to the Home Consumption of Callicoes three Millions seven Hundred
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
and fifty Thousand Yards of Printed Callicoes in a Year, which is so infi∣nitely above the Quantity of Callicoes printed in a Year in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that indeed it makes the Baldance, which must be all imported, a Prodigy in the Trade.</P>
<P>I refer to the Account of Callicoes printed in <HI>England</HI> in any Year since the Duty on printing or painting of Calli∣coes has been settled in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the highest Year I meet with being as follows:
<TABLE>

</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>The Balance, which must be imported clandestinely, is</CELL>
<CELL>2,773552</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>By this Account 'tis most evident, that the Callicoes worn in <HI>Great Britain</HI> a∣mount to more than the Callicoes print∣ed in <HI>Great Britain</HI> by two Millions se∣ven Hundred seventy five Thousand five Hundred fifty and two Yards, which is a very great Quantity: But it will not rest here.</P>
<P>I shall take Leave to make one Ob∣servation here from this just Deduction of Quantities, namely, That were the other Advantages of the <HI>East India</HI> Trade much greater than will upon Examination be found, yet 'tis worth enquiring whether any Trade can be call'd profitable to a Nation, or indeed ought to be suffer'd in this Kingdom, which, in the Consequence of it, is a Protection to such a monstrous Abuse
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
of the Publick and to the fair Traders, as well as to other Branches of Trade.</P>
<P>The endeavouring to continue any Part of their Trade at so great an Ex∣pence of their Country, is teally cri∣minal in the very Nature of the Thing; and when such Evidence of this clan∣destine Trade is brought, and of its being the Consequence of the Company's trad∣ing in Callicoes, and of their being thus consum'd at Home, by which the inju∣rious Trade is protected and render'd undiscoverable, the very Company it∣self ought to come voluntarily, and of their own Choice, into Measures to pre∣vent it; and if no other Method can be propos'd, as it is certain none has been, and, 'tis believ'd, none can be, they ought to give up such a Branch, however otherwise profitable to them∣selves, as a just Compensation for the Wrong: Such a Sacrifice would shew, that it was their Desire that the <HI>East India</HI> Trade should be profitable to their Country, and such a Sacrifice would make it so.</P>
<P>Then we should all plead for the <HI>East India</HI> Trade, as a Business many Ways useful, if not profitable; whereas now it appears, that it is not only unprofi∣table, but very injurious to the Nation,
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
and dangerous to other Branches of our Trade, which are most profitable in themselves.</P>
<P>But the Certainty of this clandestine Trade is farther prov'd by the Manner of exporting the Callicoes which are printed here, or, at least, the Pretence of doing it; and this I find set out in Part, in a printed Paper, handed about at the Door of the House of Commons, entitled, <HI>The Case of the</HI> Fair Traders, <HI>or a clear View and State of</HI> Clandestine Trade, <HI>as now carry'd on in</HI> Great Bri∣tain, wherein, among other Things, is the following Paragraph, concerning the Exporting Callicoes printed in <HI>En∣gland</HI> to Parts beyond Sea, where <HI>East India</HI> Callicoes are not prohibited.</P>
<P>Callicoes printed here, are enter'd at the Custom-House for Exportation, but not shipp'd off; or, if they are shipp'd, reland∣ed and consum'd here, after <HI>8 d. per</HI> Yard on the Importation, and <HI>6 d. per</HI> Yard on the Stamp, are both drawn back.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the Quantity of <HI>English</HI> Printed Callicoes, exported thus by Certificate, and for all which there is drawn back 8 <HI>d. per</HI> Yard the white Duty, and 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Yard the Print Duty,
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
is exceeding great; and the same Paper declares, That one House of Merchants <HI>(call'd</HI> DRAPERS) in <HI>London,</HI> has re∣ceiv'd, in one Year, more than 10000 <HI>l.</HI> for Drawbacks on such Callicoes: What became of the Goods, and where they were consum'd, it is very easy to judge.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> The last Evidence of the Fact in both these Branches of clandestine Trade, is from the frequent Seizures <HI>made by the Officers of the CUSTOMS</HI> of such Callicoes, as well those Printed at Home as Abroad, a large Parcel of which are, even at this very Time, con∣demn'd, and the Sale of them publish'd at the Custom-House.</P>
<P>It is hard to make an exact Cal∣culation of the Quantities of Goods, Numbers of Yards, and Value, in both these Articles of clandestine Trade; but I have great Reason to believe, that he who publish'd, that the Loss to the Government in the Customs only a∣mounts to 400000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> is much within Compass; but what the Injury to the Nation in Trade is, no Man can calculate; 'tis an immense Sum, scarce credible so much as to mention.</P>
<P>If there was really nothing else to be said against the <HI>East India</HI> Trade, than this, That, <HI>as before,</HI> it is the Occasion
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
of, and a Protection to such a publick Mischief in Trade, as this clandestine Way of Importation: This alone would be sufficient to give it the Title of an injurious disadvantageous Trade.</P>
<P>Nor is this Custom of running Calli∣coes the only Mischief of the <HI>East In∣dia</HI> Trade; for 'tis the same in the Tea, the Coffee, and the Pepper; the Exam∣ples are most flagrant; If the Quantities of Tea enter'd for Exportation were calculated in any single Year, by the Custom-Bills only, and that discounted out of the Quantity of Tea imported, it would not leave a Proportion equal to the visible Expence in <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI> by a prodigious Quantity: Whence then can it be supply'd but by foul Pra∣ctices?</P>
<P>The Coffee ('till a late Engrossment of Coffee, has alter'd the Case, and rais'd the Price) was to be bought cheap∣er of the Druggist, by the Bale or Hun∣dred, than the Duty and the Price cost at the Candle amounted to, and that by 40 or 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and how should this be done, but by clandestine un∣fair Trading.</P>
<P>Pepper, since the high Duty of 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> lb. has wholly disappear'd, as to the Duty; the Exportation has been as great as
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
the Importation, within a Trifle; and the Home Consumption has been re∣duc'd to about four Bags of Sweepings, or thereabouts, in a Year; that is to say, there has not above four Bags paid Duty at the Custom-House in a Year; and yet we had no Want of Pepper in <HI>England,</HI> but have consum'd as much as ever; and how has this been done, but by the Arts of Shipping and Re∣landing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Article of <HI>foreign</HI> East India <HI>Goods,</HI> (I call them foreign, because not import∣ed by our Company, but by Stealth) has also another Thing in it, which overthrows all the Merit of the <HI>East India</HI> Trade; for, you must note here, that I am talking of the <HI>East India</HI> Trade in general; that is to say, the Trade in <HI>East India</HI> Goods, no Matter by whom imported, whether by our Company, or a foreign Company.</P>
<P>The Advocates for the <HI>East India</HI> Trade plead, that so great a Quantity of the <HI>East India</HI> Goods brought hither are re-exported▪ that it over-pays for all the Bullion they carry out.</P>
<P>I have accounted for great Part of these Exportations, on the Foot of their re-landing: But I say, if that was not to be mention'd at all, I shall over-ba∣lance
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
them, by the clandestine Impor∣tation of other <HI>East India</HI> Goods, by Way of <HI>Holland,</HI> as also from <HI>India</HI> directly, by the private Traders on Board our own Ships; the prodigious Quantities of both these are such, that, I am assur'd, they will amount to much more than all the Goods the Company here can pre∣tend to send Abroad, or than are sent Abroad any Way from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if this be true, as I see no Room to doubt, what is become of all the Exportations of <HI>East India</HI> Goods, boast∣ed so much of? 'Tis all sunk at once, and, in short, there are not only none at all exported; that is to say, in Effect; but there are more <HI>East India</HI> Goods consum'd in <HI>Great Britain</HI> in a Year, than our own Company imports in all, by a very great Quantity.</P>
<P>It is impossible, indeed, to make exact Calculations of the Value of Things that are thus done by Stealth, and in pri∣vate; but the Sum is incredible, and exceeds all our Calculation.</P>
<P>A certain Draper, learned in the smuggling Trade, and whose Importa∣tions of foreign <HI>East India</HI> Goods, if Fame belies him not, have borne a great Share in this Over-balance, has been pleas'd to say, at the Bar of the House
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
of Commons, that the Number of Peo∣ple in <HI>England</HI> who wear printed Cal∣licoes, is very inconsiderable, in which he is pleas'd to differ strangely from the Opinion of the Lords-Commissioners of Trade, who judge them to be a Million.</P>
<P>I have heard a judicious Observer of these Things say, that he has calculated, that 320000 People were cloth'd in print∣ed Callicoe and Linnen in the County of <HI>Middlesex</HI> only, exclusive of the Cities and Liberties of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster:</HI> Whether this Gentleman or the modest Pleader above were nearest the Point, I leave to the Judicious.</P>
<P>The modest Draper above-nam'd, however, to make some Amends for under-doing it, in the Number of Wea∣rers of Callicoe, allows 16 Yards of Cal∣licoe to be consum'd every Year by about 70000 People, who are all he allows to wear it; so that by his Account, the Expence of Printed Callicoes in <HI>Great Britain</HI> amounts to no more, than one Million one Hundred and twenty Thou∣sand Yards a Year; which is not far off of the Number of Yards printed in <HI>England,</HI> and which is the Fund he goes upon, supposing no more to be worn than he can prove are printed in <HI>Great</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
<HI>Britain.</HI> Now let us go both Ways to Work: First let us take his Number of Wearers, and the Commissioners Quanti∣ty, five Yards a Year to each Person, one with another; for some are Children, and take up but a little; some are good Housewives, and make 'em serve longer than a Year, which makes the whole of the Callicoes consum'd in <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI> in a Year, to be no more than 350000 Yards a Vear.</P>
<P>Were this true, the Gentleman was much in the Right, who put the Questi∣on; namely, <HI>What Trifle then is it that they struggle for thus with the whole Nation?</HI> But this is all absurd and ri∣diculous; and the Account given by the Lords Commissioners of Trade of the Number of Persons wearing Calli∣coes and Printed Linnens, being esti∣mated at a Million, is certainly much more rational to make a Judgment up∣on, tho', without doubt, much below the Fact: Nor do I make any Scruple to say, and in it I speak the Judgment of Men of very good Understanding and Sincerity, that there are near two Millions of People in this Island who are at this Time cloath'd in and using Callicoe.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/>
And thus, if there were a Deficiency in the Number of Wearers, it is made up many other Ways: There are many Thousands of Women who have two or three several Suits of Callicoe at a Time, for Morning-Gowns, Wrapping-Gowns, and Mantua's, and such like, besides that out of the Number of Yards calculated by the Commissioners, are excluded, the great Quantities used in Furniture, such as Quilts for Beds and Window-Curtains, and the like.</P>
<P>All the Use I make of these Calcula∣tions of Numbers, is this: That from hence is judg'd the Proportion of the Quantities brought in upon us from Abroad, I mean such as are brought from <HI>India</HI> to us by the Way of <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI> or privately by our own Ships.</P>
<P>But as all Calculations of this Kind are liable to Exceptions, I'll take it their Way and our own together. The Drapers allow the Number of Yards worn by each Person to be larger than the Lords Report, being 16 instead of five Yards to each Person; the Lords Report al∣lows the Number of Wearers to be a Million; and the other would insi∣nuate them to be no more than the Callicoes printed in <HI>England</HI> can cloath;
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
but they bring no Argument to prove the Number of a Million is too great; so I take it at a Medium, and cleaving to the Number of a Million of People, allow 12 Yards to each Person, thus:</P>
<P><TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>One Million of People wear∣ing 12 Yards <HI>per Ann.</HI> each, is—</CELL>
<CELL>Yds. 12,000000</CELL>

<P><TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>Deduct from this all the Linnens print∣ed in <HI>ENGLAND</HI> in a Year, and not Exported, which are</CELL>

<CELL>Also all the legally worn Callicoes, <HI>viz.</HI> such as are printed in <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> which are</CELL>

</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL COLS="2">The Ballance is the Calli∣coes foully imported—</CELL>
<CELL>10,472594</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>So that by this Rule there must be Ten Millions four Hundred seven∣ty two Thousand five Hundred and ninety four Yards of Printed Callicoes clandestinely imported among us in a
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
Year, besides <HI>East India</HI> Wrought Silks, in a very great Quantity.</P>
<P>The Value of these requires another Calculation; and I desire to do it as modestly as it can be desir'd. I'll sup∣pose they cost us (for we must value them) not as they cost Abroad, but as we pay for them at Home, for that is the Foot of the Account, as we shall see presently.</P>
<P>Suppose then we give 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Yard for them one with another (which, by the Way, is a very low Estimate) those foreign printed Goods bearing the best Price, as being valu'd at much more, and indeed generally printed better than those which are printed at Home; allowing then only 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Yard upon the Quantity of Ten Mil∣lions four Hundred seventy two Thou∣sand five Hundred ninety four Yards, it amounts to the Sum of One Million three Hundred and nine Thousand and twenty four Pounds fifteen Shillings <HI>per Ann.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to bring all this to the Point, these clandestinely imported Goods of <HI>India</HI> must be paid for out of the Ex∣portations of the Company's Goods
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
from <HI>England,</HI> before one Ounce of the Bullion, they want for their yearly Exportation, can be purchas'd by them.</P>
<P>Then consider their Exportations to be for the most Part re-landed, as has been shewn. The Ballance of the <HI>East India</HI> Trade runs against us thus:</P>
<P>Bullion exported, eight Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year.</P>
<P><HI>India</HI> Goods clandestinely imported, One Million sixty five Thousand four Hundred and nineteen Pounds.</P>
<P>The Foot of this Account, is one Million eight Hundred and sixty five Thousand four Hundred and nineteen Pounds a Year dead Loss to the Nation by the <HI>East India</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>Only, that out of this must be rec∣kon'd so much Pepper and other Goods as are really exported and not run back on Shore, which may amount to about three Hundred and fifty Thou∣sand Pounds a Year at the most.</P>
<P>But against this is to be plac'd all the <HI>East India</HI> Wrought Silks, and Stuffs mixt with Silks, all the Handkerchiefs and Muslins that are run in upon us again, as well from <HI>Holland</HI> as from on Board our own Ships, which amount to a very great Quantity; and 'tis believ'd will fully ballance the other.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/>
But if all these were to be reckon'd as nothing, or thrown for the Supply of any suppos'd Over-reckoning in the above Calculation, or reserv'd <HI>in Petto,</HI> for a farther Account, there is yet a visible Ballance against them.</P>
<P>So that we lose by the Trade to <HI>India,</HI> fifteen Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year: Deny it they that can.</P>
<P>It is in vain to plead the Shipping, the Seamen, the People employ'd in this Trade, their Merit in Loans to the Government, or the like; no Trade, carrying out Money, and returning what is consum'd at Home, can be gain∣ful to the Nation.</P>
<P>I wholly leave out of the Question the Mischief of the Goods they return, and the Hurt they do to our Manu∣factures; that's a Debate by itself; but I am now only upon the Subject of meer Profit and Loss to the Publick by the <HI>East India Trade.</HI></P>
<P>It is scarce possible to omit, how glo∣rious an Advantage there is now put in∣to our Hands, nay, and into the Com∣pany's Hands also, to put a Stop to all this; to make them what they never were yet, <HI>viz.</HI> A profitable Company, and to shut the Door against Foreigners
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
abusing us, and yet leave the Company a flourishing Company too.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, but a fallacious Advan∣tage to take of them, and say, if their Callicoe Trade is so small, why do they labour for it so hard? Why com∣plain of so much Injury done them? Why set it in Competition with the whole Woollen Manufacture and Trade of <HI>Great Britain?</HI> I say, this would be a fallacious Advantage, <HI>though, as taken from the Mouth of their own Pleader, it would be just, as to them:</HI> For the Fact is not Truth, the Quantity is infinite∣ly more; and so great, that our own Company is not able to supply the De∣mand, no nor even the <HI>Dutch;</HI> but our interloping Traders have assisted to erect another Company in <HI>Flanders,</HI> which they call <HI>Imperial;</HI> but, as it is well known, is erected upon and carry'd on by a Subscription of <HI>English</HI> Stock, and supply'd even with Captains, Factors, Seamen, and Ships from <HI>England:</HI> In Return for which, they supply <HI>England</HI> with their Goods; that is to say, they spread the Poison farther among us; and this very Draper▪ who pleaded at the Bar of the House, and others, that may be nam'd, were known to go over to <HI>Ostend,</HI> to the Sale of <HI>East India</HI> Goods
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
there, and to buy great Quantities of Goods there: How those Goods were brought over into <HI>England,</HI> the only Market for them, is still a Question, which is worth asking.</P>
<P>So that here is another Influx of <HI>East India</HI> Goods, how great, Heaven only and the Gentlemen-Drapers know. But this we all know, that these also must all be paid for from <HI>England,</HI> be∣fore one Ounce of that Bullion they talk of bringing back can come in; and where then is the Bullion found which they carry away, and which purchases all the Goods in <HI>India?</HI> The Answer is ready, 'tis even bought with Bullion, 'tis Money bought with Money, 'tis sent away at the Nation's Expence.</P>
<P>And here we sensibly feel the Da∣mage sustain'd by the Publick from this Trade, namely, the Lessening and Consumption of our current Coin▪ whether they melt it down or no, I will not enquire here; that is a dark Trade by itself, which deserves to be en∣quir'd into; and which, if enquir'd into, may easily be laid open. But does any Silver, (that's the Question that will try it all) go to the Mint? The com∣mon Accidents of the World, and the ordinary Occasions of Trade and Tra∣velling,
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
will necessarily diminish the Coin if there is not a Supply. <HI>And why are we not supply'd?</HI> Why no Silver sent to the Mint? But because of the immense Quantities sent away to the <HI>East Indies.</HI></P>
<P>And here, if we cou'd dilate and ex∣tend our Thoughts to consider not our own Trade singly, but the general Trade of the World, we shou'd find the <HI>East India</HI> Trade ruinous and destructive to the general Trade of all this Part of the World, as well as to ours in parti∣cular.</P>
<P>To judge of this, you must consider <HI>Europe</HI> as one Body, one Nation, or one general Interest in Trade, and set the <HI>East India</HI> Trade against it as another. The <HI>East India</HI> Trade exhausts the whole Treasure of <HI>Europe,</HI> and de∣stroys thereby their Trade; carrying every Year such immense Sums of Mo∣ny in Specie out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>India,</HI> that the whole Body feels the want of it very sensibly. In Return of which, they bring their chief Manufactures and their Growth, and fill these Parts of the World with Gaiety and Trifles, and rob them a second Time of the Employment of their People. Some Part of <HI>Europe</HI> indeed have been wi∣ser
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
than we are, and have prohibited the Use and Consumption of all these <HI>East India</HI> Goods for the very Reasons that indeed all the rest of <HI>Europe</HI> ought to do the same; namely, because they rob them of their Coin, and starve their Poor. This carrying the Mony thus away into <HI>India</HI> from <HI>Europe</HI> in gene∣ral, is evident in the different Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> for there are more Channels than this one, tho' by all the Chan∣nels it runs into the same Place. For Example,</P>
<P><HI>England, Holland, Flanders, France, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> send their Mo∣ny in the same manner in Bulk, and about by long Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> transmits vast Sums, even all the Silver they can get by Trade: I say, they send it down the Red Sea, and by the Gulph of <HI>Mocha,</HI> to the Coast of <HI>Malabar</HI> and Bay of <HI>Bengale▪</HI> and all those Places, to buy <HI>India</HI> Goods; which again they sell into <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and bring back the Silver; which supplies that Export. The <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade does the like, for all the Sil∣ver the <HI>Turks</HI> get from <HI>Europe,</HI> which is no small Quantity, dreins off this Way, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38"/>
Thus, in a Word, <HI>Europe,</HI> like a Body in a warm Bath, with its Veins open'd, lies bleeding to Death; and her Bul∣lion, which is the Life and Blood of her Trade, flows all to <HI>India,</HI> where 'tis amass'd into infinite Heaps, for the enriching the Heathen World at the Expence of the Christian World.</P>
<P>From this great Cause of <HI>Europe</HI>'s Po∣verty come all the Shifts and Projects of <HI>Europe,</HI> for raising imaginary Wealth in the room of real Wealth; substituting Credit, which indeed is but Air, in∣stead of Bullion, and Paper instead of Money; and they do indeed supply the Want of the Species, or else <HI>Europe,</HI> which is a trading Nation, <HI>if we may, as above, speak of it all as one Body,</HI> could not carry on her Commerce. Her Product and Manufactures wou'd not circulate for want of Money to assist that Circulation, and to circulate with it; for, in short, Money is the Stream of Trade which carries <HI>the Product and Manufactures;</HI> that is to say, Merchan∣dise along with it. And if the Mer∣chandise did not thus float upon the Water, that is Money, 'twou'd be a-Ground, stand and stagnate, and wou'd never be carry'd from Place to Place.</P>
<P><PB REF="39"/>
The Goods go out, the Money comes in; more are carry'd out upon the Strength of that Money, and the like. But here the Order of Trade is invert∣ed; for in the Trade to <HI>India</HI> the Goods do not go out; the Product and Manufacture does not go out to fetch in the Money, as is the natural Course of Trade, but the Money goes out to fetch the Goods in; and this, in Trade, is letting out the Blood, and with it the Life.</P>
<P>There is an Evidence of this past Con∣tradiction in the ordinary Affairs of Trade in <HI>Europe.</HI> For Example, if by the Interruptions of War, or any other Accident of the Sea, or Pyrates, or whatever it be, the Galloons from <HI>New Spain</HI> are prevented coming to <HI>Europe,</HI> by which the Quantity of Bul∣lion is supply'd and kept up; we im∣mediately feel the Loss; Trade, like the Belly, misses its Food; a Scarcity ap∣pears, like that of Corn in the Markets after a bad Harvest; and the Price ad∣vances 'till a Supply comes.</P>
<P>What is the Reason, but this, that the Trade to <HI>India</HI> exhausts the World, the Money drains all away insensibly, and grows scarce?</P>
<P><PB REF="40"/>
The other Trade of <HI>Europe</HI> does not do thus: If the Money goes out of one Country into another, it passes from thence into a Third, and thence again into a Fourth, and so back again from whence it came, and round again; ever circulating like the Blood in the Veins, and carries with it the Spirits, which nourish the whole.</P>
<P>But <HI>India,</HI> like the Grave, swallows up all, and makes no Return; <HI>that is,</HI> the Money never returns: What they send us back, <HI>is nothing;</HI> 'tis consum'd here, and so vanishes and dies away; serving only to amass more Bullion to be carry'd away; till, in a Word, it im∣poverishes not <HI>England</HI> only, but all <HI>Europe.</HI> And was Gold as good a Com∣modity in <HI>England</HI> as Silver, we shou'd not have Mony left to carry on the common Course of Trade.</P>
<P>Thus, I think, 'tis clear, That the Trade to <HI>India</HI> is a disadvantageous Trade, in its own Nature, not to <HI>Eng∣land</HI> only, but to all <HI>Europe.</HI> 'Tis hard we shou'd have it to say, 'tis more dis∣advantageous to <HI>England</HI> than to any other Part of <HI>Europe.</HI> But this is our Case; the Reasons are,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="$$" REF="41"/>
1. <HI>Because England</HI> being a manufa∣cturing Country, and more engag'd in the manufacturing Part than all <HI>Europe;</HI> besides the bringing back of <HI>Indian</HI> Manufactures among us, for Cheapness and Gaiety pleasing to our People; we suffer more in our own Manufa∣ctures, than any other Nation can do in theirs.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because</HI> other Nations, especially those who have Manufactures of their own, whether of Wooll, or Silk, or both, have been wiser than we, and have taken the Alarm early, and shut the Door of Trade against them; pro∣hibiting the Use and Wear of them, under the severest Penalties; thinking it enough that the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade carries out their ready Mony, and impoverishes them that Way, and not allowing them to come back and ruin their People, by supplanting their Manufactures with the Returns; so cutting their Throats with their own Knife. This we hope for, tho' we are not arriv'd to it yet.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Because England</HI> not only receives all the Manufactures of <HI>India,</HI> brought by our own People, but is the Center of the Consumption of <HI>East-India</HI> Goods for the <HI>Dutch French, Fleming,</HI> and, in a Word, for all the Companies of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
whose Goods are run boldly i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon us; and we as supinely run into the Expence of them, to the Ruin of our Trade, and Destruction of our Ma∣nufactures.</P>
<P>Neither of these three Particulars can be said of any other Nation of <HI>Europe;</HI> and therefore the <HI>India</HI> Trade, injurious to them all, is yet more parti∣cularly disadvantageous to us than to any of the others.</P>
<P N="1">1. I cannot close this Work, without observing how effectually all this might be prevented, how easy a Stop might be put to it, and to what infinite Ad∣vantage to Trade, by this only Me∣thod; namely, of forbidding the Use and Wearing of printed Callicoes and Linnens.</P>
<P N="2">2. That no other Method but this can do it, no Prohibitions, no Penalties, no Forfeitures; no, not if Running them were to be punish'd with Death, or Transportation, which is worse than Death.</P>
<P>But once forbid the Use and Wearing, the Work is done; what no Body can wear or use, no Body will buy; what no Body will buy, no Body will bring to Market; what no Body will bring to Market, no Body will fetch
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
from Abroad. And thus the Trade will be at a full Stop at once.</P>
<P>It has been too plain, that all Laws for preventing clandestine Trade, where the Gain of it is so high, are in vain. The Running of <HI>French</HI> Brandy is a Proof of this, which is done so open∣ly, that <HI>French</HI> Brandy is now to be bought, upon the Coast of <HI>England,</HI> as cheap, within a Trifle, as at <HI>Calais;</HI> and so of all other Goods, for 10 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Men will contract to Run in any Kind of Goods that come from Abroad; and ensure them into our Shops, such as Pepper, Coffee, Tea, Callicoes, Chints, <HI>East India</HI> wrought Silks, <HI>French</HI> Bro∣cades, <HI>Dutch</HI> Blacks, Linnens, Fine Hol∣lands, and, in a Word, almost every Thing.</P>
<P>But once prohibit the Use of these <HI>East India</HI> wearing Cloths, and you ef∣fectually stop it all.</P>
<P>'Tis a Particular to the Callicoes and <HI>East India</HI> Goods, that they are chiefly used for upper Garments: If they were less expos'd, 'twou'd be more dif∣ficult to restrain them; but as it is, 'tis easy to do it.</P>
<P>It remains to show, that if this was done, the chief Grievance of the <HI>East India</HI> Trade wou'd be over; not but
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
they would be an advantageous Trade even then, but they would do much less Harm than now, and yet wou'd drive a very great and profitable Trade to themselves: And with this Note shall close this Work, reserving the Ex∣planation of it to another Time.</P>
