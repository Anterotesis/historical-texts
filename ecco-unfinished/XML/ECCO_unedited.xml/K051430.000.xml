<P>DURING childhood, every ob∣ject
strikes the mind with the
force of novelty; and the mind,
soft like wax, yields to every im∣pression,
good or bad. To cherish
the former and to prevent the lat∣ter,
is the province of the mother;
for as she is entrusted by Provi∣dence
with the government of her
children during their tender years,
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
the mind ought to be no less her
care than the body.</P>
<P>THE children of Princes are in a
critical state with respect to edu∣cation:
they have none but their
mother to preserve them from the
corruption of flattery and fawning.
If they have lost her early, they
are undone.</P>
<P>IT has fallen to your MAJESTY'S
lot, to take the lead in the educa∣tion
of a numerous and hopeful
Royal Family; and if fame speak
true, Providence has not in reserve
a person more worthy of that im∣portant
office: it is laborious in∣deed,
but pleasing to a mother.
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
May Heaven, prospering your ma∣ternal
tenderness and perseverance,
make your children what you wish
them to be, affectionate to their
parents, kindly to their dependents,
and in time illustrious examples of
good conduct to the British nation.</P>
<P>A Royal Family so educated may
be relied on as a firm support to
the Throne.</P>
<P>THE purpose of this Essay is to
evince, that the culture of the
heart during childhood, is the chief
branch of education. I have little
doubt of convincing those who are
disposed to give attention; but dry
subjects seem at present not to be in
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
request. One sure way there is to
procure attention; and I know no
other. If your MAJESTY will gra∣ciously
condescend to patronise this
little Work, it will become fashion∣able:
every one will read: a num∣ber
will approve; and perhaps a
few will seriously think of a re∣formation.</P>
<P>BUT imitation is more persuasive
than exhortation. Though in this
degenerate age, our women of fa∣shion,
neglecting domestic concerns,
seem to think every hour lost that
does not pass in a crowd; yet your
MAJESTY's examplary conduct can∣not
fail to have great influence.
Many it will reclaim to a more se∣date
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
and more rational tenor of
life; and your proselytes, happy in
the change, will chearfully testify
to the world a sacred truth, That a
mother's sweetest pleasure, arises
from preparing her children, by
virtuous education, to be happy in
this life, as well as in the life to
come.</P>
<P>MAY your MAJESTY'S life be long
and prosperous, not only for your
own sake, but for that of our Sove∣reign,
of your Royal Issue, and of
the Nation.</P>

EDUCATION,
CHIEFLY CONCERNING THE
CULTURE OF THE HEART<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Head is the seat of thinking, deliberating, reasoning, willing, and of all other internal actions. The Heart is the seat of emotions and passions; and of moral perceptions, such as right and wrong, good and bad, praise and blame, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See Elements of Criticism, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edit. 5. vol.

<DIV2>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind of man is a rich soil,
productive equally of flowers and
weeds. Good passions and impressions
are flowers which ought carefully to be
cultivated bad passions and impressions
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
are weeds which ought to be suppressed,
if they cannot be totally rooted out.
Such moral culture is no slight art: it
requires a complete knowledge of the
human heart, of all its mazes, and of
all its biasses.</P>
<P>As impressions made in childhood are
the deepest and the most permanent, the
plan of our Creator for giving access to
the heart, even in that early period, can∣not
be too much admired. The first
thing observable is, an innate sense that
enables us to discover internal passions
from their external signs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elements of Criticism, edit. 5. vol. I. p. 441.</NOTE>. As that sense
is of prime use in every period of life,
it early attains to full exercise; indeed as
early as the senses of seeing and hearing
do. An infant on the breast discerns
good or bad humour in its nurse, from
their external signs on her countenance,
and f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m the different tones of her voice.
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
Next, these signs and tones affect the
infant differently: a song or a smile,
chears it: a harsh look or tone, makes it
afraid, or keeps it in awe.</P>
<P>BY these means, the human heart lies
open to early instruction; and is suscep∣tible
of having proper notions stamped
on it, such as those of right and wrong,
of praise and blame, of benevolence and
selfishness, of yours and mine. The great
utility of such notions, will appear from
opposing them to various absurd notions
and opinions, which never could have pre∣vailed
in the world, had they not been in∣culcated
during infancy. Take the follow∣ing
instances. Stories of ghosts and hob∣goblins
heard for the first time by one
grown up, make no impression unless it
be of laughter; but stamped on the mind
of a child, they harrass it incessantly,
and are never totally obliterated. Many
Popish doctrines are contradictory to
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
common sense; and yet held to be self-evident,
because they were instilled du∣ring
childhood. What is it that can
rivet in the mind of any one the strange
doctrine of transubstantiation, but the
taking advantage of early youth, which
is susceptible equally of every impression,
right or wrong? Were that doctrine re∣served
for adult persons, it would be re∣jected
by all for its eminent absurdity.
The low people in Spain have little o∣ther
notion of a Christian, but of one
who signs himself with the cross; and
yet are prone to blood and slaughter
against every person who forbears that
trifling ceremony. When notions that
have no foundation in nature take such
hold of the mind, it cannot be doubted
but that notions grafted on some natural
principle or affection will be equally per∣manent.
Therefore, let it be the first care
of parents to instil into their children right
notions, which can be done by looks and
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
gestures, even before a child is capable
of understanding what is said to it. With
regard to families of distinction in par∣ticular,
this branch of education is of the
highest importance. Even before the age
of seven, notions of rank, of opulence,
of superiority in the children of such
families, begin to break out, and to ren∣der
them less obsequious to discipline
than in their more tender years; and if
admitted to take peaceable possession,
adieu to education of any sort.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU advances a strange opinion,
that children are incapable of instruction
before the age of twelve. This opinion,
confined to the understanding, is per∣haps
not far from truth. But was it his
opinion, that children before twelve are
incapable of being instructed in matters
of right and wrong, of love and hatred,
or of other feelings that have an original
seat in the heart? If it was, gross must
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
have been his ignorance of human na∣ture.
And yet that this was really his
opinion, appears from his insisting that
a child ought not to be punished for
telling a lie; which can have no foun∣dation
other than that a child is not
conscious of doing wrong when it tells
a lie, more than when it tells truth.
If the difference between truth and false∣hood
be innate, which it surely is, why
ought not a child to be punished for
telling a lie, if the vice cannot be re∣strained
by gentler means?</P>
<P>INFANCY is a busy scene, and yet little
attended to, except for the sake of health.
As this period is short, every opportunity
ought to be taken, for instilling right
notions and making proper impressions.
The infant, at the same time, is busy in
gathering for itself a stock of ideas from
the various objects of the external senses,
ready to be uttered as soon as it can speak,
which commonly is before the age of two:
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
the difficulty it has to struggle with, is
not want of ideas, but want of words. It
is wonderful to what degree of under∣standing
some children arrive very early.
A child named Martha, three years old,
had been told jocularly, that Martha or
Mattie was an ugly name, and that she
ought to have been called Matilda. The
child was overheard saying to a younger
sister, who had not yet got the use of her
tongue, “When you can speak, you must
not call me Mattie, which is an ugly
name, but Matilda.” There are in∣stances
without number of the same kind;
and in tracing the progress of the mind
they deserve well to be recorded.</P>
<P>THE education of girls is by nature
entrusted to the mother; and of boys,
till they are fit for regular discipline at
school. The father occasionally may give
a helping hand, but it can only be occa∣sionally.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17"/>
THUS the culture of the heart during
childhood, the most precious time for such
culture, is a task with which females
only are charged by providence; a vo∣cation
that ought to employ their ut∣most
sagacity and perseverance; a voca∣tion
not inferior in dignity, as will ap∣pear
afterward, to any that belongs to
the other sex. Yet children, during that
precious time, are commonly abandoned
to nurses and servants. The mother is
indeed attentive to the health of her
child; and flatters herself that nothing
further is required from her. But it can∣not
be expected, that early education will
be regarded by a mother who is igno∣rant
of its advantages.</P>
<P>THIS is deplorable, especially as there
are several obstacles to a remedy. One
is, that there is no school, public or pri∣vate,
for teaching the the art of cultivating
the heart. Nor is it an art of a slight
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
kind: few arts are more complicated or
more profound. Another is, that this
art, as the world goes, appears to be little
in request; and, I believe, is seldom
thought of in chusing a wife. A young
man, inclined to avarice, discovers no
virtue in a young woman but a plen∣tiful
fortune. Another, addicted to the
pleasures of sense, regards beauty only.
A prudent man, having nothing in view
but an agreeable companion, is satisfied
with a sweet temper and affable manners.
The art of training up children is never
thought of, though of all the most essen∣tial
in a mother.</P>
<P>ZEAL to have such obstacles removed,
suggested to me the following Essay. Sen∣sible
I am, that in its present loose attire,
it is scarce fit to appear in public; but
may not the uncertainty of life in an ad∣vanced
age, plead my excuse? I should
have ended life with regret, had any
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
thing been left undone by me, that could
benefit my fellow creatures. Were it ge∣nerally
understood, that the education of
children is the mother's peculiar province,
an important trust committed to her by
her Maker, education during that early
period would, I am persuaded, be carried
on more accurately than it is at present.
With respect to the education of female
children in particular, genteel accomplish∣ments,
such as music and dancing, need
not be rejected; but in order to accom∣plish
them as mothers, the knowledge of
human nature and the art of improving
the heart, would chiefly be insisted on.
This art would have a beneficial influence
on the conduct of married women. In∣stead
of roaming abroad for want of oc∣cupation
at home, the dignified occupa∣tion
of educating their children, would
be their most charming amusement. The
husband, happy in his wife and in his
children, would in no other place find
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
the comfort of his own house. The chil∣dren,
early inspired with morality and re∣ligion,
would be prepared to perform
with alacrity every duty, and to stand
firm against every temptation.</P>
<P>How distant from such a state are per∣sons
in high life, who, in great cities, are
engaged in a perpetual round of pleasure!
Take for instance routs and card-assem∣blies.
Excepting those at the card-tables,
who make but a small part of the com∣pany,
the rest saunter about, looking at
one another, wishing in vain to have
something to say. Whether frequency
does not render such meetings wofully
insipid, I appeal to those who pass much
of their time in them. And yet, for such
pastime, married women not only ne∣glect
domestic oeconomy, but even the
education of their children.—Unhappy
mortals to be thus enslaved by a mere
shadow! Their only resource for their
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
children, is a boarding school; which is
not a little hazardous for girls, who by
their number escape strict attention; and
who, in the most ticklish period of life,
are more apt to follow bad example than
good. Young ladies of rank, carried
from the boarding school to the dissipa∣tion
of high life, are not likely to be∣have
better than their mothers did before
them. The fruits of such education are
but too apparent. Formerly, neither di∣vorce
nor separation were much heard
of: they have now become so frequent,
as scarce to make a figure in a news∣paper.
A young woman engaged in affec∣tion
to a lover, is forced by her parents
into what is termed a more advantage∣ous
match. Nature prevailing over con∣science,
she yields to her lover against her
duty. That miserable woman is surely
entitled to some share of pity; but a lady
who lives always in public, seldom has
that excuse for deserting her husband.
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
Genuine love is a tender plant that can∣not
even take root in a crowd; for if an
impression be made, it is banished by the
next new face. Young women in high
life are married at the will of their pa∣rents,
without any personal attachment;
and if one of them go astray, she has not
love for an excuse, but downright appe∣tite
for variety. It would not, I suspect,
be difficult to find such a woman, who
would prefer her husband before her gal∣lant,
were they equally new to her. Oh!
Babylon, Babylon, the terror of nations,
but the sink of iniquity.</P>
<P>BIDDING adieu to such persons as irre∣claimable,
I cannot despair of a reforma∣tion
in the more sober part of the female
sex, if the importance of cultivating the
heart of their children be set in a clear
view. My expectations are the more
sanguine, from my acquaintance with se∣veral
women of distinction, who consider
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
the education of their children as their
dearest concern, and who take great
delight in it. One lady there is of high
rank, whom I dare not name, being a∣fraid
of displeasing her. I should other∣ways
propose her as a pattern, not merely
for imitation, but for emulation: to ex∣cel
her, instead of pain, would give her
satisfaction. I cannot readily form a
wish more beneficial to my fellow citi∣zens,
than that her talent for educating
children should become general, and that
every mother should be inspired with her
zeal and perseverance in the exercise of
that talent.</P>
<P>IT appears unaccountable, that our
teachers generally have directed their in∣structions
to the head, with very little at∣tention
to the heart. From Aristotle
down to Locke, books without number
have been composed for cultivating and
improving the understanding: few in
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
proportion for cultivating and improving
the affections. Yet surely, as man is in∣tended
to be more an active than a con∣templative
being, the educating a young
man to behave properly in society, is of
still greater importance than to make him
even a Solomon for knowledge. Locke
has broached the subject, and Rousseau
has furnished many ingenious hints. The
following Loose Thoughts on the same
subject, are what have occurred to me
occasionally.</P>
<P>GOOD education may be illustrated
by comparing it with its opposite. The
following account is given by Le Brun
of those kings of Persia who have inhe∣rited
by blood. “This king is absolute
in the strictest sense; for he disposes
of the lives and properties of his sub∣jects
without control. He is born in
the seraglio, and kept there in prison,
ignorant of what passes in the world.
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
When arrived at a certain age, he is
taught to read and write by a black
eunuch, is instructed in the Maho∣metan
faith, and to bear an impla∣cable
hatred to the Mahometans of
Turkey and of Indostan; but not a
syllable of history, of politics, nor even
of morality. Far from being teased
with things that require application,
he is set loose to sensual pleasure the
moment the impulse takes him. Opium
is procured for him, and other drugs
that excite voluptuousness. At the
death of his predecessor, he is led
from his prison to the throne, where
all prostrate themselves before him,
with expressions of the most abject ser∣vility.
Surprised, nay stupified, with
a scene so new and extraordinary, he
conceives all to be a dream; and it re∣quires
time to render the scene fami∣liar.
As he is incapable of inspiring
affection or even good will, his cour∣tiers
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
have no view but to make a pro∣perty
of him. Far from offering him
good advice, they keep him ignorant in
order to mislead him. Thus the Persian
kings pass their vigour in luxury and
voluptuousness, without the least regard
to their people or to their own repu∣tation.”
Carneades the philosopher ob∣served,
“that the sons of princes learn
nothing to purpose but to ride the great
horse; that in other exercises every one
bends to them; but that a horse will
throw the son of a king with no more
remorse than of a cobler.” Must I be
obliged to think, that the foregoing de∣scription,
with a few slight variations,
may suit the greatest part of those who in
France and England have been born with
the certainty of inheriting a great estate?
“If there is any characteristic peculiar
to the young people of fashion of the
present age, it is their laziness, or an
extreme unwillingness to attend to any
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
thing that can give them the least
trouble or disquietude; without any
degree of which they would fain en∣joy
all the luxuries of life, in contra∣diction
to the dispositions of Provi∣dence,
and the nature of things. They
would have great estates without any
management, great expences without
any accounts, and great families with∣out
any discipline or oeconomy: in
short, they are fit only to be inhabitants
of <HI>Lubberland,</HI> where, as the child's geo∣graphy
informs us, men lie upon their
backs with their mouths open, and it
rains fat pigs, ready roasted.” <HI>The World,</HI>
No. 157. Lord Chesterfield, the most agree∣able
of writers, expresses himself with pe∣culiar
spirit upon a different branch of this
character. “As for the modern species
of human bucks, I impute their bru∣tality
to the negligence or to the fond∣ness
of their parents. It is observed
in parks among their betters, the real
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
bucks, that the most troublesome and
mischievous are those who were bred
up tame, fondled, and fed out of the
hand, when fawns. They abuse, when
grown up, the indulgence they met
with in their youth; and their fami∣liarity
grows troublesome and danger∣ous
with their horns.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A young man born with the certainty of suc∣ceeding to an opulent fortune, is commonly too much indulged during infancy, for submitting to the autho∣rity of a governor. Prone to pleasure, he cannot bend to the fatigues of study: his mind is filled with nothing but plans of imagined happiness, when he shall have the command of that great fortune. No sooner is he in possession, than he sets loose all his appetites in pursuit of pleasure. After a few years of gratification, his enjoyments by familiarity and easiness of attainment become languid, and at length perfectly insipid. In the mean time, a total neglect of oeconomy reduces him to straits, his debts multiply and become urgent; and he is in the highest flow of dissipation when his enjoyments are at the lowest ebb. Dissimulation now supplants the native can∣dour of his temper. He must promise when he knows he cannot perform, and must caress a dun who is his aversion. Despairing to retrieve his affairs, he abandons himself to profligacy: his peace of mind is gone; and he is now more wretched than formerly happy. Oppose to this meteor a young man without fortune, who must labour for his bread. He is educated to a calling which he prosecutes with in∣dustry, but for some time with little profit. By perseverance his circumstances becoming easy, he thinks of marriage. He delights in his wife and chil∣dren; and his grand object is to make a fortune for each of them. They are all put into a good way of living. One of his sons is assumed as his partner in business; upon whom by degrees is devolved the laborious part. And now our merchant finds ample leisure to indulge in the comforts of society. He ends his days with a grateful sense of the goodness of Providence, in bestowing blessings on him with a liberal hand. Let us now compare.—But there is no comparison. No man of sense would chuse to be the person first described. A man on the contra∣ry must be ambitious beyond measure, who would not be satisfied with the lot of the other. I can figure no state more happy, if it be not that of a man who for years has applied himself to business, sweetened by a taste for letters. Fortune throws in∣to his lap a large estate, of which he had no ex∣pectation. Having been taught by experience that his own wants are easily supplied, he exerts his usual industry to make his friends happy, and to remedy the wants and distresses of his fellow crea∣tures. Can any state be figured more opposite than this to that first mentioned, with respect to every comfort of life?</NOTE>”</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29"/>
FEW articles concerning government
are of greater importance, than good edu∣cation.
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
Our moral duties are circum∣scribed
within precise bounds; and there∣fore,
may be objects of law. But man∣ners,
depending on an endless variety of
circumstances, are too complex for law;
and yet upon manners chiefly depends
the well-being of society. This matter
was well understood among the ancient
Romans. Out of the most respectable
citizens were elected censors, whose pro∣vince
it was to watch over the manners
of the people, to distinguish the deserving
by suitable rewards, and to brand with
infamy every gross transgression. But in
an opulent nation, it is vain to think of
stemming the tide of corruption. To
give vigour to the censorian office, it in∣dispensably
must be exercised by men of
dignity, eminent for patriotism, and of a
character above exception. But as such
men were not to be found among the
degenerate Romans, the office vanished,
and has not been revived in any mo∣dern
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
government: nor, indeed, does there
exist any government so pure, as to ad∣mit
that delicate institution. Our only
resource for exercising that important of∣fice,
are fathers and mothers. Let it
sink into their hearts, that we have no
reliance but upon them for preventing
universal corruption, and of course dis∣solution
of the state. It might, indeed,
have been expected, that the parental
censorian office would be protected and
encouraged by people in power. Though
the legislature can do little, the Sove∣reign
and his ministers may do much,
both by example and precept. It is in
their power to bring domestic discipline
into reputation, which would excite pa∣rents
to redouble their diligence. Much
need, alas! is there for some such exer∣tion,
considering the defective state of
education in this island. So little notion
have the generality of its importance, that
if a young heir get but a smattering of
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
Latin or of French, he is held to be an
accomplished gentleman, qualified for
making a figure. What if a person who
hath carefully bred up a family, and ad∣ded
to the society a number of virtuous
citizens, male and female, should be di∣stinguished
by some mark of honour,
which, at the same time, would add lustre
to every individual of the family? What
if men of genius were encouraged by
suitable rewards to give us good sy∣stems
of education? When a man has
taught a public school for 12 or 15 years
with success and applause, why not re∣lieve
him from his fatique by a hand∣some
pension, enabling him to confine
his attention to a few select scholars? I
offer these as hints only. It will not be
difficult to multiply them.</P>
<P>IT is of the utmost importance to the
nation, and to the King and his ministers,
that young men who may serve in par∣liament
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
should be carefully educated, and
in particular, be fairly initiated in the
science of politics. Were the members,
in general, of the two houses expert in
that science, there would be no such wo∣ful
division among them as at present.
A clear sight of the public good, would
at least damp the vile appetite for the
loaves and fishes that governs many of
them. If they could not entirely approve
the conduct of the minister, for what
minister is always right in the popular
opinion, they would admonish him in an
amicable manner; and if they could not
prevail, would wait patiently for a more
favourable opportunity to serve their
country. This, indeed, would be patri∣otism,
of which the discontented party
endeavour in vain to put on the mask.
It is believed, that the late Sir Robert
Walpole bestowed great sums upon wri∣ters,
for justifying his measures. It
would be a more solid plan, to engage
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
tutors of colleges and other teachers, to
instil into their pupils a due submission to
government, and to teach them this use∣ful
lesson, That the public never suffers so
much from an unskilful minister, as from
a factious opposition to him. Why not
schools for teaching the science of poli∣tics,
erected at the expence of the public,
as schools are for teaching the art of war?
Such an institution, inconsistent, indeed,
with absolute monarchy, would suit ad∣mirably
the constitution of Britain. Sure
I am, that never in this island was there
more occasion for such schools, than in
the present time,—men venting doctrines
even in parliament, subversive of order
and good government, tending to cor∣rupt
the whole mass of the people, and
to authorise every degree of licentious∣ness.</P>

<P>IN gathering materials for this work,
I have adhered strictly to the system of

clearly founded upon that system,

Rousseau has unhappily too much
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
imagination to be confined within so nar∣row
bounds: he builds castles in the air,
and in vain endeavours to give them a
foundation. His <HI>Emile,</HI> however, with
all its imperfections, is a work of great
genius; and he has given many hints
that deserve to be prosecuted. Compare
his performance with others on the same
subject, and its superiority will appear in
a striking light. Compare it with a book
intitled, <HI>Instructions for educating a Daugh∣ter,</HI>
attributed, I must believe, unjustly,
to an excellent writer, the most virtuous
of men, Fenelon Archbishop of Cam∣bray.
The following passage will by con∣trast,
do honour to my favourite author.
“The substance of the brain is in chil∣dren
soft and tender; but it hardens
every day. By this softness, every thing
is easily imprinted on it. It is not
only soft but moist, which being join∣ed
with a great heat, give the child a
continual inclination to move, whence
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
proceeds the agitation of children, who
are no more able to fix their mind on
any one object, than their body in any
one place. The first images, engraven
while the brain is soft, are the deepest,
and harden as age dries the brain, and
consequently become indefaceable by
time. Hence it is, that when old, we
remember many things done in youth,
and not what were done in riper age;
because the brain at that age is dried
and filled with other images. But if
in childhood, the brain be adapted for
receiving images, it is not altogether
so for the regular disposal of them, or
for reasoning. For though the moisture
of the brain renders the impressions
easy, yet, by being joined with too
great a heat, it makes a sort of agita∣tion
which breaks the series of rational
deductions.” What a rant is this; worlds
without any meaning! Here, man is re∣duced
to be a mere machine, every thing
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
explained from soft and hard, moist and
dry, hot and cold; causes that have no
imaginable connection with the effects
endeavoured to be explained. Books of
this kind may be pored on without end,
and the reader be not a jot the wiser.
Why from the same principles does not
this most profound philosopher deduce
the light of the sun, the circulation of the
blood; or, what is no less difficult, the
mathematical regularity of an egg?</P>

<HEAD>LOOSE HINTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">AUTHORITY OF PARENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE faculty of reason is bestowed
on man for controling his appetites
and passions, and for giving them a pro∣per
direction. This faculty is indeed
born with us; but as it is feeble like the
body during the first stage of life, pa∣rental
authority supplies the want of rea∣son
during that period. And, as no work
of God is left imperfect, children are
directed by instinct to obey their pa∣rents;
and if children be not unkindly
treated, their obedience is not only vo∣luntary,
but affectionate. This is not a
picture of imagination: every one who
has given attention to the infant state,
will bear witness, that a child clings to its
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
mother, and is fonder of her than of all
the world beside. By this admirable plan,
children, who have no reason, are com∣monly
better governed, than adult per∣sons
who possess a considerable share of
it: the former are entirely obsequious to
the reason of another; the latter not al∣ways
to their own.</P>
<P>THAT the authority of parents must
be absolute, is evident, because in the
nature of things it cannot be subject to
any control. And it is equally evident,
that the same authority must be trans∣ferred
to the keeper, where the parents
are dead or at a distance. But much art
and delicacy are requisite in the manner
of exercising it. I absolutely prohibit se∣verity;
which will terrify the child and
reduce it to dissimulation, the worst of
habits. If such severity be exercised as
to alienate the child's affection, there is
an end to education; the parent or keeper
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
is transformed into a cruel tyrant over
a trembling slave. Beware on the other
hand of bewraying any uneasiness in re∣fusing
what a child calls for unreason∣ably:
perceiving your uneasiness, it will
renew its attempt, hoping to find you in
better humour. Even infants, some at
least, are capable of this artifice. There∣fore,
if an infant explain by signs what
it ought to have, let it be gratified-in∣stantly
with a cheerful countenance. If
it desire what it ought not to have, let
the refusal be sedate, but firm. Regard
not its crying: it will soon give over, if
not listened to. The task is easier with
a child who understands what is said to
it: say only with a firm tone, that it can∣not
have what it desires; but without
shewing any heat on the one hand, or
concern on the other. The child, be∣lieving
that the thing is impossible, will
cease to fret. Some children begin early
to show a keenness for what touches their
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
fancy. Lose not a moment to repress
that keenness, not by bluntness or rough∣ness,
but by informing the child that it
is improper. If from infancy it have
been trained to obedience, it will submit
pleasantly. The effect of this discipline
is not confined to childhood: it is an
excellent preparation for bearing crosses
and disappointments in all the stages of
life. How differently do the low people
manage their children? If a child cry
without reason, it is whipt by the angry
mother; and it has now reason to cry,
which it does till its little heart is like to
break. The mother, still through the
influence of passion, though of a differ∣ent
kind, melts into pity, cajoles, flatters,
caresses, all to pacify the poor infant.
Can any thing be more preposterous?
The child soon discovers that fretting
and crying will procure what it wants.
As few of the lower sort ever think of
disciplining their children to obedience,
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
it is no wonder that there is found a∣mong
them so much obstinacy and per∣verseness.</P>
<P>THE absolute dependence on parents
that nature puts children under, has,
when rightly exercised, two effects ex∣tremely
salutary. One is, that it produ∣ces
a habit of submission to authority, a
fine preparation for the social life. The
authority of the magistrate succeeds to
that of the parent; and the submission
paid to the latter is readily transferred
to the former. The great empire of
China affords a conspicuous instance:
reverence to parents is the corner-stone
of that vast edifice: it is encouraged
as the highest virtue; and every neglect
meets disgrace and punishment. Another
effect is, that the habit of submission to
parental authority introduces naturally a
habit of submission to self-authority, or,
in other words, a habit of submission to
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
the authority of conscience. Youth is
liable to the seduction of passion, and a
dangerous period it is to those who have
been neglected in childhood. But a young
man, obedient from infancy to his pa∣rents,
submits with as little hesitation to
the dictates of his own conscience; and if
happily, at his entrance into public life, he
escape temptations that are difficult to be
resisted, he becomes fortified by habit to
resist every temptation.</P>
<P>THOUGH parental authority well tem∣pered
fits us thus for society and happi∣ness,
yet that eminent writer Rousseau,
rejecting the system of nature, declares
for emancipating children from all sub∣jection,
indulging them in every fancy,
provided only they do no mischief to
others. I cannot really conjecture, upon
what imagined principle in human na∣ture
this doctrine is founded. A child
is incapable to judge for itself; and yet
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
it must not be directed by its parents.
“Pray Sir, hold off, there ought to be
no authority, the child must be left to
itself.” This is a strange notion. Can
it be improper to tell a child, that what it
desires is wrong; or that the doing what it
desires would make it despised or hated?
If the child be not so far advanced as to
understand that language, nothing re∣mains
but plain authority, which the
child submits to readily and pleasantly.
Rousseau maintains, that you must not
pretend to have any authority over
your pupil, but only that you are the
stronger, and can subject him by force<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Emile, vol. I. p. 95.</NOTE>.
Is not this to teach him, that right de∣pends
on force; and that he may law∣fully
subject every one who is weaker
than himself? Was it Rousseau's inten∣tion
to breed his pupil a tyrant and
oppressor? he could not take a more ef∣fectual
method.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="46"/>
AN infallible way of rendering a child
unhappy, is to indulge it in all its de∣mands.
Its desires multiply by gratifica∣tion;
without every resting satisfied: it
is lucky for the indulgent parents, if it
demand not the moon for a play-thing.
You cannot give every thing; and your
refusal distresses the creature more, than
if you had stopt short at first. A child
in pain is entitled to great indulgence;
but beware of yielding to fancy: the
more the child is indulged, the more
headstrong it grows: and the more im∣patient
of a disappointment.</P>
<P>I AM acquainted with a very respec∣table
couple, disciples of Rousseau; more
however, I conjecture, from inclination
than from conviction. They seldom hi∣therto
have employed any means for
keeping their children in order, but pro∣mises
and intreaties. As the father was
playing at chess with a friend, one of his
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
children, a boy of about four years, took
a piece from the board and away to play
with it. Harry, says the father, let us
have back the man, and there's an apple
for you. The apple was soon devoured,
and another chess-man laid hold of. In
short, they were obliged to suspend the
game, till the boy, turning hungry, was
led away to supper. I would have such
parents consider, whether they are not
here misled by self-deceit. Their motive
they imagine to be tenderness for the
poor babes. But the real motive is their
own weakness, which they indulge at the
expence of their babes; for must it not
even to them be evident, that to indulge
irregular fancies in creatures destitute of
reason, is destructive to self-command,
without which there can be no virtue.
It perhaps will be observed, that this case
falls not under the general rule, being an
instance of a child by its petulance hurt∣ing
others. If so, what is laid down as
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
a general rule, must be contracted with∣in
a narrower compass. But, letting that
pass, what would our author have said
upon the following case. A gentleman,
upon a visit at a friend's house, heard
little master crying below stairs. The
mother alarmed was told, that he wanted
to ride up to table upon the roast beef,
and that the cook did not relish the pro∣ject.
The mother was for letting Dickie
have his will. But the father luckily
reflected, that the sirloin would probably
be too hot a seat for Dickie. Rousseau
would have made this also an exception,
as he could not mean, that parents should
stand by and suffer their children to hurt
themselves. His doctrine thus reformed,
resolves in giving children full liberty in
matters indifferent, such as can neither
hurt themselves nor others; to which
restriction I willingly subscribe. And
thus a doctrine ushered in with solem∣nity
as a leading principle in the educa∣tion
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
of children, and seeming at first
view of great importance, does, upon
a more narrow inspection, vanish into
smoke.</P>
<P>HAVING discussed authority, the cor∣ner-stone
as it were of the building, my
aim was to have stated the following
hints in a regular order; but in vain.
And after all, what order can be expected
in loose hints? All I can undertake is to
arrange them so as to correspond to the
different stages of nonage; the simplest
first, the more complex after, to be put
in practice when the mind is ready for
them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MANAGEMENT of CHILDREN in the
First Stage of Life.</HEAD>
<P>IN a complete treatise upon the educa∣tion
of children, every principle, every
instinct, every passion and every appetite
ought to be carefully dissected. But this
is far beyond my purpose, and I believe
beyond my reach. I venture only to
give instructions upon such of the parti∣culars
above mentioned as display them∣selves
early, and make some figure even
in childhood. A fair commencement of
a subject, mostly new, is all I pretend to.
May I not indulge the pleasing hope that
a subject of so great importance will be
ripened by others, and perhaps brought
to perfection by the ablest hands. The
following instructions belong to the pre∣sent
section.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="51"/>
<HI>1st,</HI> A POWER to recal at will pleasing
objects, would be a greater blessing than
ever was bestowed in a fairy tale. The
pleasure of heal this little felt, except in
its absence: it is however a real blessing;
not only as it guards against pain, but
as it naturally suggests pleasing objects.
In the latter respect, however, it is infe∣rior
to cheerfulness and sweetness of
temper; which are not only in them∣selves
pleasant, but still more by direc∣ting
the mind to none but agreeable ob∣jects.
A sullen and morose temper, on
the contrary, is not only in itself un∣pleasant,
but still more by calling to
mind no objects but what are disagree∣able.</P>
<P>THIS observation may be turned to
good account in education. Do we wish
to make our children happy? Let them
be accustomed to agreeable objects, and
a veil drawn over those that are dis∣agreeable.
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
Cheerfulness and agreeable
objects, have a mutual influence: the
former attracts the latter; and the latter
by reaction invigorate the former. Can
any one doubt, that fettering infants
new born in folds of linen, which they
struggle against in vain, must have an
effect upon their temper? Were that
treatment long continued, it would pro∣duce
a lasting habit of fretfulness. This,
among other objections to the practice,
is of great weight. Why should not the
children of people in easy circumstances,
be roused from sleep every morning with
music? Why not be entertained fre∣quently
with agreeable pictures; and
why not be amused with ludicrous sto∣ries
to make them laugh? I would how∣ever
be far from excluding subjects that
excite pity and tender concern. Pity is
indeed painful; but far from disagree∣able,
even in the actual feeling. I am
pleased with myself for having sympa∣thized
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
with another; and that pleasing
reflection adds to my happiness.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE impressions may be made
upon an infant even in its mother's
womb. The mother during pregnancy
ought to banish all dismal thoughts, and
preserve herself as much as possible calm
and cheerful. There is little doubt but
that this will benefit her infant. The
same reason holds for chusing a nurse or
keeper of an even and cheerful temper.</P>
<P>A HABIT of cheerfulness acquired in
infancy, contributes not a little to health.
The Druids of old were eminently skilled
in physic. Their chief <HI>recipe</HI> for preser∣ving
health was expressed in three words,
<HI>cheerfulness, temperance, exercise.</HI> This ha∣bit
contributes not less to alleviate mis∣fortunes.
It makes us see every ob∣ject
in its best light, and fits us to
submit to accidents without repining.
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
“Almost every object that attracts our
notice, has its bright and its dark
side: he that habituates himself to
look at the dark side, will sour his dis∣position,
and consequently impair his
happiness; while he who constantly
beholds the bright side, insensibly me∣liorates
his temper, and, in consequence
of it, improves his own happiness, and
the happiness of all about him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE WORLD, No. 126.</NOTE>”</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> WILL I be thought to refine too
much when I maintain, that a habit of
cheerfulness acquired during infancy,
will contribute to make a face beautiful?
A savage mind produces savage manners;
and these in conjunction produce a harsh
and rugged countenance. Hence it is
that a national face improves gradually,
with the manners of the people. Listen
to this ye mothers, with respect especially
to your female children: you will find
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
that cheerfulness is a greater beautifier
than the finest pearl powder.</P>
<P>SOME children are by nature rash and
impetuous: a much greater number are
shy and timid. The disposition of a
child appears early; and both extremes
ought to be corrected whenever an op∣portunity
occurs. Fear is a passion im∣planted
in our nature to warn us of dan∣ger,
in order to guard against it. When
moderate so as to raise our activity only,
without overwhelming us, it is a most
salutary passion: but when it swells to
excess, which it is apt to do in a timid
disposition, far from contributing to safe∣ty,
it stupifies the man, and renders him
incapable of action. If your pupil there∣fore
be of a fearful temper, you cannot
begin too early to fortify him against
that weakness. Most children are afraid
of a new object that is formidable in its
appearance, a large dog for example.
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
Handle it familiarly and show it to be
harmless: the child will be persuaded to
do the same. A child, as Rousseau ob∣serves,
is afraid of a mask. Begin with
showing it an agreeable mask: put it on
laughing; others laugh, and the child
laughs. Accustom the child to masks
less and less agreeable: it will in time be
afraid of no mask, however ugly. Thun∣der
has an awful sound, and is apt to
raise fear. Lead your pupil to the fields
when it thunders: it will in time cease
to fear. Guard your children with un∣remitting
care against tales of ghosts and
hobgoblins, which in childhood make a
deep impression. As such tales are al∣ways
connected with darkness, accustom
your children to grope their way in the
dark. Rousseau's method of teaching
children to act in the dark, deserves to
be imitated. I was told by a lady of
rank, that by engaging her servants to
follow her example, such tales were un∣known
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
in her family. Her children were
trained to say their prayers in a dark
room, after receiving the following in∣struction,
“Thy Father which seeth in
secret will reward thee openly.” They
were disciplined to lay up their-play∣things
in such order, as to find them
readily in the dark.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the opposite extreme
of rashness and impetuosity, lay hold of
every proper opportunity for moderating
it; and there is little doubt of success, if
proper means be used. Sometimes even
an accident will assist: a child happening
to fall down a few steps of a stair, it for
some time would neither go up nor down
without its maid. There is no occasion
to warn children against seen danger: no
child is ever disposed to throw itself down
from a window, nor to jump into a fierce
running stream. But there are things that
attract the eye by their lustre, which an
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
infant will endeavour to grasp, because
it sees no danger; a burning candle for
example, or a shining knife. Teach your
infant to guard against such things: put
your hand once or twice on a silver boil∣er
full of hot water, and draw it away
with signs of pain. After putting the in∣fant's
hand on it till it feels pain, let it
understand by signs that the thing ought
not to be touched. This will have its
proper effect, even before the infant can
speak. An infant endeavours to grasp
the blade of a knife, being the shining
part. Cut its finger cunningly till the
blood appear. Let it understand by signs
that this is done by the knife: it will
avoid a knife till it learn to handle it
without danger. A lady made the ex∣periment
on an infant of a year; and it
not only avoided the knife, but looked
concerned when others handled it. At
the age of six or seven, boys, in imitation
of men, will attempt things above their
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
strength. In that case, it is proper to re∣strain
them by pointing out the danger.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> CHILDREN are prone to complain,
because they have no power to right
themselves. Complaints too readily li∣stened
to, will set children of a family at
variance with one another. Disregard a
slight complaint, and admonish the com∣plainer,
that it ought to love its brother
or sister, instead of bringing it to punish∣ment
by complaining. If the complaint
deserve a hearing, receive it coolly, and
say that enquiry shall be made. Admo∣nish
the offender privately to give satis∣faction,
particularly by instant restitu∣tion,
if it have taken any thing from the
complainer. This way of redressing
wrongs, instead of raising enmity, may
contribute to cordiality among the chil∣dren
of a family.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> IF proper authority be maintain∣ed
from the beginning, stubbornness in a
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
child will be a vice unknown; but if laid
aside or relaxed, stubbornness soon ap∣pears
in some children. Mr Locke men∣tions
a lady whose daughter was nursed
in the country. She found the child so
stubborn, as to be forced to whip it eight
times before it was subdued. This was
the first and the last time of laying a
hand upon it. Ever after, it was all com∣pliance
and obedience. This ought to
be a lesson to parents never to relax the
reins of government. Doubtless the mo∣ther
here suffered more pain than the
child. Consult Rousseau's method of
subduing an obstinate boy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Emile, vol. I. p. 149.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>5th,</HI> MAN is an imitative being; and
his proneness to imitation may be made
subservient to good culture. A child
under three, shrinks from every grown
person, except those of its acquain∣tance.
But it is fond of children. Let
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
a child of six or seven, carefully educated,
associate with younger children, they will
learn more by imitation than by much
verbal instruction. Even before infants
can speak, they understand by signs your
disapprobation of a fretful person, or of
one who is dirty or slovenly. But imi∣tation
is a two-edged weapon: though
nature dictates to boys and girls different
amusements, yet nature may be warped
by circumstances. A boy educated with
girls of his own age, will imitate their
manners, and become effeminate. In this
part of the world, it is more common to
see a girl imitate the manners of the boys
with whom she is educated. Such wrong
biasses ought to be guarded against. There
are instances of persons having contract∣ed
a bad manner of speaking, from hear∣ing
daily the inarticulate sounds of the
younger part of the family. Nature, in∣deed,
directs us to imitate those above
us; but a child of six or seven, living
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
with several younger, will descend to
partake of their amusements, rather than
be left alone.</P>
<P><HI>6th,</HI> A favourite child, indulged by its
parents to assume authority over others,
will become a tyrant when grown up.
Some children are disposed to treat ser∣vants
with haughtiness and contempt.
If this temper in children be not repres∣sed,
they will become like negro-drivers
in our colonies, or our carters at home.
Give authority to your servants to let
such children know, that they are not
their servants, nor owe them obedience.
From this treatment they will discover,
that civility and intreaty, are the only
means for procuring what they want.</P>
<P><HI>7th,</HI> THAT in the nature of some in∣dividuals,
there is a disposition to cruelty,
cannot be disguised, being evident from
various facts. Strong symptoms of it ap∣pear
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
in childhood, during which period
there is nothing hid. It is not uncom∣mon
in a child, after caressing its favou∣rite
puppy, to kick and beat it; or, after
stroking its sparrow, to pull off its head.
I have seen a little girl, after spending
hours in dressing its doll, throw it over
the window in a sudden fit. This disease
is not easily cured, because, like the King's
evil, it is kept secret. I know of no cure
so effectual, as to enure a child of this
temper to objects of pity and concern.
Such objects frequently presented, and at
proper times, may give a turn to the di∣stemper,
and make it yield to humanity.
Such fits of cruelty however, are far from
being general. There are many children,
who, having no malice in their composi∣tion,
are invariably kind to their favou∣rites,
and charitable to persons in want.</P>
<P><HI>8th,</HI> IT is a capital point to enure young
persons to suffer accidental evils with
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
firmness. Children at play, bear strokes,
fatigue, and hunger, without repining;
and custom will render such evils fami∣liar
and easy. This was held an impor∣tant
branch of education among the
Spartans; witness the young man who
suffered a fox he had stolen to eat into
his bowels, rather than disclose the theft.
The seat of pain is in the mind; and ac∣cordingly
bodily distress is felt much the
lighter when the mind is prepared for
it. If a child cut its finger or get a bump
on its head by a fall, it softens the pain
to make a joke of it, to laugh, and to
make the child laugh. If it fall a crying,
say “that it is below a person of fashion
to mind a fall, that no children cry
but beggars brats, and that such a one
suffered more without complaining.”
Nurses and servants increase the child's
distress, by an appearance of pity and
concern. Death commonly is very little
painful: the pain lies in the imagination
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
of the dying person, raised by the tears
and melancholy looks of the attendants.
Teach a boy to suffer slight pain without
concern, and he will become a hero. If
too careful to prevent pain, you render
your child a coward.</P>
<P>THIS branch of education is for the
most part ill conducted, especially among
the lower ranks. A child, slipping a foot
and falling, cries from fear more than
from pain. It is whipped for crying,
though no antecedent care had been taken
to correct that weakness. It cries now
bitterly; and every thing must be done
to appease the poor child. The floor is
beat for hurting babie: it gets a sugar-plum
to give over crying. Such treat∣ment
inculcates more than one bad lesson.
The beating the floor fosters revenge in
the child. The sugar-plum teaches it to
cry when it wants any thing; and hence
artifice and simulation.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="66"/>
<HI>9th,</HI> THAT cleanliness proceeds from
an internal sense, is made evident in
Sketches of the history of Man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edit. 2. vol. I. p. 320.</NOTE>. This
sense, originally weak, like many others,
is capable of being fortified by education.
Let every thing be clean about your chil∣dren:
give signs of disgust at a dirty
hand or a dirty frock, of which even an
infant before it can speak, will compre∣hend
the meaning. I was informed by
a lady, not a little studious of human na∣ture,
that a child of her's, not two years
old, seeing a dirty spot on her frock, cut
it out, knowing no better way of remo∣ving
the eye-sore.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MANAGEMENT of CHILDREN in their
Second Stage.</HEAD>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> HESIOD, a Greek Poet, than
whom we know none more an∣tient,
makes the following instructive ob∣servation,
that the gods invented indu∣stry
in order to make us virtuous. No∣thing
indeed equals industry for prevent∣ing
vice. Parents and tutors! apply this
observation to the children under your
care. Keep them employed, keep them
busy, and they will never have a wrong
thought. Let them indulge themselves
in play as long as they incline; but draw
them off when they begin to tire. Train
them to do every thing for themselves
as much as possible; which will not only
promote their activity, but excite their
invention. Children who have every
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>
thing furnished to them without labour
or thought on their part, will become in∣dolent
and incapable of any vigorous
exertion,—helpless beings who must em∣ploy
another hand even to buckle a shoe.
In order to exercise invention, children
should have no play-things but what they
make themselves, or help to make. A
play-thing that gratifies the fight only,
is not long relished; but a child never
tires of one that gives it exercise. A girl
continues fond of her doll, being constant∣ly
employed in dressing and undressing it.
She makes it act the visitor in the draw∣ing-room:
she makes it do the honours of
the table: she gives it correction and in∣struction.
Such things you will see imitat∣ed
by a girl even in her fourth year. I
know not that there has been invented any
such play-thing for a boy of the same age.
A bow and arrows require more years;
and so does the art of walking blindfold
in a streight line, or of searching for any
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
thing in the dark. Running for a prize
is an exercise too violent for boys of
twice that age. Riding on a stick is
so faint an imitation of riding on horse∣back,
as not to be long relished. For
want of suitable play-things, employ
them in matters that require some
thought. Send your son to bring you
the ripest apple in the garden, or the
number of fruit-trees that cover the
walls, or of horses in a certain inclosure.
Send him to borrow for you such a
book; or to make your apology for
breaking an appointment. Hide a pen∣knife
in a scritore: Send him to bring
it. If unsuccessful, send him again, and
he finds it at last. This will exercise
both his industry and invention. Set
things before him for a choice, a picture-book,
a pair of gloves, silver buckles, a
child's bow and arrows. Demand a
reason for his choice, which will give
you occasion to instruct him about a
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
right choice. Employ your daughter the
same way, especially in matters that be∣long
more properly to her sex. I am told,
that there is an English boarding school,
in which the girls have gardening for an
amusement. A certain spot is allotted to
each, which she fills with flowers, and
weeds with a hoe accommodated to her
size.</P>
<P>THERE are other exercises fitted for
boys as well as girls, which I introduce
here for the sake of connection, though
perhaps the next section may be thought
a more proper place for them. To ini∣tiate
children in the knowledge of trees,
of fruit, and of their names, take a leaf
from each of the common kinds, an oak,
a beech, an elm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Spread them on a
table, and point out to your pupils the
particulars that difference each of them
from the rest. Add from time to time
leaves of trees less common. Your pupils
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>
will learn to know every tree at first sight
by its leaf. This is a fine introduction
to botany, and a promoter of it. An a∣pricot,
a peach, a nectarine, are readily di∣stinguishable;
but to distinguish the dif∣ferent
kinds of apples and of pears, and
to give names to each, requires more la∣bour
than commonly is given. And this
may be made an amusement even for
children of four or five. Show them the
different kinds, and point out the peculi∣arities
of shape and colour. The young
creatures will be fond of this exercise,
and will soon be expert in it. Such ex∣ercises
have the double advantage of ser∣ving
for instruction as well as for pass∣time.
Another amusement will serve as
an early introduction to history. Collect
prints of eminent persons, antient and
modern. After examining a print with
attention, give a short account of the
person it represents, Epaminondas for
example, who delivered his country from
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
Spartan oppression, or Julius Caesar, who
enslaved his country. Proceed at inter∣vals
to other prints, with proper observa∣tions
for improving your pupils in vir∣tuous
principles, and for giving them a
distaste to vice. When sufficiently ripe, let
them take the lead, and one after another,
name the persons and their history who
are represented in the prints. Entering
into a course of history in more advanced
years, they will have double pleasure
in renewing their acquaintance with the
persons who make the chief figure.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY produces many other good
effects. In the <HI>first</HI> place, an industrious
person is always in good humour. La∣bouring
people never tire, because they
have always something to do. To lan∣guish
for want of occupation, is the en∣vied
lot of the opulent; their amuse∣ments
by familiarity soon turning infi∣pid.
Women of fortune having nothing
<PB N="65" REF="73"/>
to animate them after the vanities of
youth are over, become vapourish and
unhappy. In the <HI>next</HI> place, a habit
of application paves the way finely for
schools and colleges; and makes it easy
to acquire every sort of knowledge. No∣thing
on the other hand is more baneful,
than a habit of sauntering. This is easily
prevented in children, because they are
naturally active; but with difficulty after
the habit is begun. The neglect of this
material article, has proved the ruin of
many a hopeful genius: it is little less
faulty, than the indulging of young per∣sons
in vicious habits; for idleness is an
inlet to many vices.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU declares against imposing
tasks on children. I cannot help differ∣ing.
Children are fond to be employed.
Let their tasks at first be agreeable, and
much within their ability; time and ha∣bit
will enable them to overcome the
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
most difficult. This sort of culture, is at
any rate necessary for preparing a young
man to learn a trade. How indocile in
the hand of a master must the apprentice
be, who has always been permitted to act
without restraint!</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> WHAT comes next in order, is to
promote every virtue in your children,
of which benevolence is the capital. The
man who is fond of his own sweet per∣son,
and of his own little pleasures, has
no relish of benevolence, nor money to
spare upon others. On the other hand,
he who spares upon himself, is common∣ly
liberal to those he is connected with.
Pliny the younger was famous for doing
good. He paid the debts of one, portion∣ed
the daughter of another, gave his nurse
a bit of land for her sustenance, made an
establishment for orphans and poor chil∣dren,—all
upon a very moderate income.
To one curious to know the fund that
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
supported so much expence, he answered
simply, “What is wanting of yearly rent
is supplied by frugality.” The late
Earl of Elgin permitted his two sons in
their hours of play, to associate with boys
in the neighbourhood, which he thought
better, than to expose them to be corrupt∣ed
at home by his servants, filling them
with notions of their rank and quality.
One day, the two boys being called to
dinner, a young lad, their companion,
said, “I'll wait till you return, as there
is no dinner for me at home. Have
you no money to buy it? No. Come
then and dine with us. No.” “Papa,”
says the eldest, “what was the price of
the silver buckles you gave me? Five
shillings. Let me have them, and I'll
give you the buckles.” It was done
accordingly. The Earl, enquiring pri∣vately,
found that the money was given
to the lad. The buckles were returned,
and the boy was highly commended for
<PB N="68" REF="76"/>
being kind to his companion. A crowd
of boys, dismissed from the grammar
school on a Saturday, attacked a beggar
who was in liquor, pelting him with dirt
and stones for their diversion. One only
there was, who did every thing to make
his companions desist. He applied to a
woman who kept a stall hard by, offer∣ing
all the money he had, if she would
rescue the poor creature. The woman,
admiring the boy's humanity, told the
story to his mother's cook, from whom
it ascended to the parlour. The mother
was delighted: but the boy, afraid that
his companions would hold him in deri∣sion
for such weakness, threatned revenge
against the woman. The mother laid
hold of the opportunity to convince her
son, that it was shameful to abuse a poor
creature who could not defend himself;
and that the lads would be chastised by
their parents, for doing a thing so un∣worthy
of gentlemen; exhorting him to
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>
persevere in what was right, without re∣garding
his companions. A boy about
the age of ten, says to his father, “Papa,
give me some money. There is a shil∣ling,
will that do? No.” “There's a
guinea. Thank you papa.” The gen∣tleman
discovered, that it was given to a
woman who had been delivered of twins,
and was obliged to hire a nurse for one
of them. A boy of five years, observing
that a gentleman playing at cards did not
pay what he lost, and concluding that he
had no money, begged some from his fa∣ther
to give to the gentleman. A boy
between seven and eight, of a noble fami∣ly,
strayed accidentally into a hut where
he saw a poor woman with a sick child
on her knee. Struck with compassion, he
instantly gave her all the money he had;
carried to her from the herb market,
turnips and potatoes, with bread and
scraps from his father's kitchen. The
parents enchanted with their son, took
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
the poor family off his hand. Two or
three years after, he saved the whole of
his weekly allowance, till it amounted to
eleven or twelve shillings, and purchased
a Latin dictionary, which he sent to a
comerade of his at the grammar school.
Many other acts of goodness are record∣ed
of this boy in the family. Can there
be conceived a misfortune that will sink
deeper into the heart of affectionate pa∣rents,
than the death of such a child?
It wrings my heart to think of it.</P>
<Q><L>Ostendent terris hunc tantum fata, neque ultra</L>
<L>Esse sinent.</L>
<L>Heu, miserande puer! si qua fata aspera rumpas,</L>
<L>Tu MARCELLUS eris.</L></Q>
<P>THERE is no branch of education more
neglected than the training of young per∣sons
to be charitable. And yet were this
virtue instilled into children, susceptible
of deep impressions, a legal provision for
the poor would be rendered unnecessary:
it would relieve England from the poor
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
rates, a grievous burden that undermines
both industry and morals. Give to each
of your children a small sum for charity.
Let them account to you for the disposal;
and to the child who has made the most
judicious distribution, give double the
sum, to be laid out in the same way.
It is not my opinion, that a child's libe∣rality
should be repaid with interest,
which Mr Locke advises, sect. 110; for
this would encourage covetousness, not
benevolence.</P>
<P>THE practice of doing good, cannot
fail to improve a benevolent disposition.
Occupy your pupil in relieving the indi∣gent,
not only by his purse, but by kind∣ly
offices. Convince him that he cannot
be more honourably employed.</P>
<P>COMPASSION may be envigorated in
a young mind, by a sight of objects in
distress. But beware of making such
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
scenes too familiar, which would blunt
compassion, instead of envigorating it.
Priests and physicians, being employed
much about dying persons, have com∣monly
little concern but to do their
duty.</P>
<P>INSTRUCT your pupils that they owe
civility to all, and that civility to the poor
will procure them more good-will, than
civility to the rich. Civility to the lat∣ter
may be understood flattery: civility
to the former can have no cause but
humanity.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> CURIOSITY is an an appetite implant∣ed
in man for acquiring knowledge.
Children have it in perfection; for to
them every thing is new and unknown.
They are constantly asking questions;
which ought to be answered according
to their capacity: to neglect their que∣stions,
or to laugh at them, shows great
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
ignorance of the principles of education;
for to give satisfaction to children by an∣swering
their questions, has a direct ten∣dency
to enlighten their minds. The
answer to one question suggests common∣ly
a second; and the ingenuity that some
children show in such questions, is truly
surprising. Such correspondence between
parent and child, tends also to increase
their mutual affection: the parent is
pleased with the child's appetite for know∣ledge;
and the child is fond of its pa∣rent
for listening to it. “Knowledge,”
says Locke, “is grateful to the understand∣ing,
as light is to the eyes. Children
are delighted when their enquiries are
regarded, and their desire of knowledge
encouraged and commended.”</P>
<P>STRONGER evidence there can be none
of man's disposition for society, than the
curiosity all have about the character and
conduct of their fellow creatures. The
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>
fondness of children for stories ought to
be laid hold of, as a mean no less pleasing
than effectual for making virtuous im∣pressions,
that never wear out. A collec∣tion
of proper stories separated into classes
that are adapted to different ages, would
be a valuable acquisition to the public.
The first class, fitted for children of four
or five, should contain short stories, exhi∣biting
pictures of virtue and vice expres∣sed
in the simplest terms. The second
class, adapted to the age of six or seven,
should contain stories of the same kind,
a little more complicated. Let the third
contain regular stories, displaying the
good consequences of virtue, and the bad
consequences of vice, still in a simple stile.
Here is room for the tutor, to inculcate
more fully these different consequences.
This class is proper to children from nine
to eleven. In the fourth class, the stile
may be raised and refined; and stories
selected that afford a striking moral; or
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
in other words, that show not only the
beauty, but the advantage of virtue; not
only the deformity, but the mischief of
vice. The last class, fit for the finishing
stage of education, may be of complicated
stories in various stiles, preferring what
have the most obvious moral. This
class may be easily filled with a selection
from the numberless stories of that kind
already in print. Such instructions, if
made a daily work, would be a great im∣provement,
by stamping on the mind vir∣tuous
notions, at a time when it is the
most susceptible of impressions. They
would also ripen the judgment, by enu∣ring
the youth of both sexes, to think and
reason upon causes and consequences.
When absurd stories of ghosts and appa∣ritions,
make so deep impressions without
having any foundation in nature, have
we not reason to believe, that impressions
equally deep, may be made by stories of
benevolence, gratitude, friendship, parent∣al
<PB N="76" REF="84"/>
and filial affection, and of other vir∣tues
which have a solid foundation in
nature? I think it is Mr Addison who
observes, that the benevolence of the En∣glish
peasants, is partly owing to the
simple, but celebrated ballad, <HI>The Babes
of the Wood.</HI> The Archbishop of Cambray,
had a high opinion of this sort of culture.
He composed <HI>the Adventures of Telemachus</HI>
for the instruction of his pupil, the Duke
of Burgundy; and other sweet fables
which every young person is delighted
with.</P>
<P>To fortify the impressions made in the
course of this culture, a set of historical
prints well chosen would greatly contri∣bute;
and as this is a pleasing study, it
may be used as one of many rewards for
behaving well. I give for an example,
the history of the Prodigal Son, carried
on through several prints. Prepare your
pupils, by relating the story in an inte∣resting
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>
manner: then exhibit the prints
one by one. They will be fond to ex∣amine
each picture with every figure in
it; and with your help, will soon be able
to explain the meaning. The most im∣portant
part remains, which is, to incul∣cate
the moral, “That children behaving
properly, will always find their parents
to be their best friends; and that even
when they go astray, sincere repentance
will restore them to favour.” The
story of Joseph and his brethren in dif∣ferent
prints, is another good example,
not only highly interesting, but affording
much instruction. Hogarth's <HI>good Ap∣prentice,</HI>
exhibits an excellent moral for
children; but is too complex for begin∣ners.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> AN important object that belongs
to every stage of education, is the disci∣plining
young people to restrain their de∣sires
and appetites; which is not difficult,
<PB N="78" REF="86"/>
if parents begin early to exert their abso∣lute
authority. There is great virtue in
restraining an appetite when the temp∣tation
is strong; and such virtue in a
young person, cannot be sufficiently ap∣plauded.
If a child insist, say dryly but
firmly, that it is not to be done. In
more advanced years, when reason be∣gins
to peep out, explain the folly of it.
Children by such discipline, acquire gra∣dually
the power of self-denial, highly
useful in the conduct of life. “If the
child,” says Mr Locke, “must have
grapes or sugar-plums, when he has a
mind to them; why, when grown up,
must he not be satisfied too, if his de∣sires
carry him to wine or women?
He who is not used to submit his will
to the reason of others while he is
young, will scarce hearken or submit
to his own reason when he is of an age
to make use of it.” A passion directed
to a particular object; a beautiful fe∣male
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>
for example, soon exhausts itself by
its violence. An appetite that can be
gratified different ways, such as ambition
or avarice, may last for ever. In the
course of education, appetites of that sort
ought to be checked with solicitude: if
they once get a seat in the mind, it is vain
to think of expelling them. Children
are fond of things that touch the palate.
After dining in their nursery, introduce
your children to the guests when the de∣sert
is on the table. If a child ask any
thing, say dryly, “You have dined, let
us dine: we demanded none of your
victuals, why should you have any of
ours?” Renew this frequently, and
your children will acquire a habit of see∣ing
without desiring. A noble Lord,
now in heaven, favoured by Providence
with a family of fine children, permitted
no play-thing to be given them, leaving
them to invent amusements for them∣selves.
He observed, “That children
<PB N="80" REF="88"/>
are fond of toys, especially of toys that
please by their novelty; and that fre∣quent
presents to them of such things,
bring on a habit of intemperate long∣ing
for trifles.” Children tire the
soonest of what they are the fondest, but
without lessening their avidity for new
things; and if these be supplied in plen∣ty,
the appetite is strengthened by habit,
requiring variety in play-things, as well
as beauty. This habit continues for life,
with no alteration but what proceeds
from age: the objects only are varied
from childish toys to thos of idle men.
And hence the endless circle of minute
pleasures, which to men of fortune be∣come
necessaries of life. You cannot be∣gin
too early, to check the desire that
children have for toys and gewgaws.
Take opportunity in presence of your
children, to display your ornaments and
fine things. Carry them sometimes to a
toyshop. Make presents to persons about
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>
you: let not your children hope to get
any present; and they will learn in time to
see such things with indifference. People
do not sufficiently consider the mischie∣vous
effects of indulging children in their
fancies: many men, who in their tender
years had been perverted by such indul∣gence,
have dissipated great estates upon
mere trifles.</P>
<P><HI>5th,</HI> THERE is no incitement for beha∣ving
well of greater efficacy, than to
let your child know, that you think it
worthy of being employed and trusted.
A lady of high rank gave the charge of
her confections to her daughter, a child
of four years. The child, accompanied
with her maid, was punctual in execu∣ting
the commission; and no less faithful
than punctual, never having once offered
to purloin the slightest thing. This ex∣periment
requires, indeed, a faithful at∣tendant:
if a child, committing a breach
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
of trust, find that the secret can be kept,
it will go on in the same track, and the
consequence will be deplorable. A re∣gulation
in some boarding schools, of
giving to an elder girl the care of two
younger, for dressing them and giving
them lessons, is excellent. Trust your
young son with papers, with money, with
a book, requiring him to preserve these
things carefully till called for.</P>
<P><HI>6th,</HI> AN article of the greatest nicety,
is to enure children to keep a secret. Tell
your child any thing in the way of se∣cresy,
not to be revealed on any account.
Have a faithful servant on the watch. If
you find that your child has blabbed,
mention not your informer, but say,
“that the secret has taken air, and that
it must have come from you. I do
not blame you much, because you are
a child; but be more on your guard
hereafter.” If the secret be kept, em∣ploy
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>
a person to talk to the child, and to
endeavour to draw the secret from it. If
the child stand firm, say to it after an in∣terval,
“I find you have kept my secret.
You are a good child, and you shall
be my confident.”</P>
<P><HI>7th,</HI> THE notion of property arises from
an innate sense, which teaches even infants
to distinguish between <HI>yours</HI> and <HI>mine.</HI> It
is however during infancy so faint, as in
most children to yield to any vivid appe∣tite.
As society depends in a great mea∣sure
on the sense of property, neglect no
opportunity to fortify that sense in your
children. Make them sensible, that it is
a great wrong to take what belongs to
another. “How would you like to have
your little dog taken from you by
force? The knife you have taken is
not yours, what right have you to
it? You ought to be satisfied with
your own play-things, and not covet

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MANAGEMENT of CHILDREN in their
Third Stage.</HEAD>
<P>THE instructions hitherto given, re∣quire
in children no degree of under∣standing,
but what is derived from nature,
before the faculty of reason begins to be
unfolded. What are contained in the pre∣sent
section require some share of that fa∣culty;
and upon that account, I term it
the third stage of childhood. Education
during this stage may be carried on not
only by facts and incidents as in the fore∣going
stages, but by advice, by exhorta∣tion,
by moral lessons, which require rea∣son
on the child's part. But let those who
preside over education attend to the proper
time for carrying on this branch. Moral
lessons abstracted from facts, never make
any impression on children, unless to
<PB N="86" REF="94"/>
breed disgust. When your pupil is agi∣tated
with some incident that gives him
concern, take that opportunity to lecture
upon it, to show its good or bad tenden∣cy;
and you will be heard with avidity.
Except upon such an occasion, pure rea∣soning
will have no good effect. Dry
instruction is for men only: the wise So∣lomon
did not intend his Proverbs for
children.</P>
<P>THE great variety of matter that comes
under this section, requires it to be di∣vided
into parts, beginning with the im∣provement
of active virtues; next, the im∣provement
of restraining virtues; third,
relative matters that fall not directly un∣der
either head, but are nearly connected
with both.</P>
<P><HI>1st.</HI> WITH regard to active virtues,
there is a beauty in candour and plain
dealing, which procures good will and
<PB N="87" REF="95"/>
affection even above many virtues that
make a more splendid figure. Nature
prompts to this virtue; for no person
ever recurred to dissimulation but to hide
some wrong. Candour is indeed a great
sweetner in society, for without it there
can be no friendship nor mutual confi∣dence.
Marischal de Turenne, when he
commanded in Germany, was offered a
considerable sum by a neutral city to
march another way. “I cannot accept,
said the Marischal, because I do not
intend to take the road to your city.”
This single stroke of character, was suffi∣cient
to endear that great man, even to
the enemies of his country: such can∣dour
is scarce consistent with any vice.
As children are naturally candid, it is an
easy and pleasant task to keep them so.
If their confidence be gained by kindly
treatment, they will never think of dis∣sembling.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="96"/>
<HI>2d,</HI> IN the foregoing section it was ob∣served,
that the way to invigorate com∣passion
in a child, is to show it objects in
distress. You may now add instruction
to sight. Make your children sensible
that none are secure against misfortunes,
and that neither birth, health, nor riches
afford protection. Give them instances
of the vicissitudes of fortune, of men in
high life reduced like Haman to bitter
misery. Cicero, talking of Caesar in one
of his pleadings, paints in lively colours
his martial atchievements, overcoming
seasons as well as enemies; but mentions
with more satisfaction, the generous pro∣tection
he gave to an old friend, who, by
an unforeseen event, had fallen not only
into misery but into disgrace. “Con∣quest,
says he, makes a man immortal;
and who would not exert every power
to become immortal! Acts of private
friendship can have no motive but
goodness of heart. And considering
<PB N="89" REF="97"/>
Caesar at the top of human grandeur
continuing attentive, like a private
person, to the necessities of the un∣happy,
I esteem him a greater man
than in the midst of his victories.”</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> THERE cannot be a more instruc∣tive
lesson to young persons, than that
happiness depends not on pomp and
grandeur, nor on other external circum∣stances.
The seat of happiness is in the
heart: one contented with his lot cannot
be unhappy. Augustus, after prevailing
over his rivals, governed during 40 years
a mighty empire. His immense power,
however, could not portect him from af∣fliction.
It did not prevent him from
exclaiming against Varus, for the loss of
his German legions; nor from beating his
head against the wall, and filling his pa∣lace
with lamentations. What availed his
conquests, when his intimate friends plot∣ted
against his life? His grandeur did not
<PB N="90" REF="98"/>
prevent the misconduct of some of his
relations, nor the death of all. He him∣self,
the last of his family, was misled by
his wife to name a monster for his suc∣cessor.
Such was the miserable fate of
that master of the world; though pro∣nounced
the happiest of men by those
who can pierce no deeper than the sur∣face.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> TASTE is one of our faculties that is
the slowest in its progress toward matu∣rity;
and yet may receive some improve∣ment,
during the course of domestic edu∣cation.
Compare with your pupils two
poems on the same subjects, or two pas∣sages.
Take the lead in pointing out
beauties and blemishes, in the simplest
manner. After some time, let them take
the lead under your correction. You can∣not
have a better book for that exercise
than the <HI>Spectator.</HI> A pleasing vein of
genteel humour runs through every one
<PB N="91" REF="99"/>
of Addison's papers, which like the sweet
flavour of a hyacinth, constantly cheers,
and never overpowers. Steele's papers,
on the contrary, are little better than
trash: there is scarce a thought or sen∣timent
that is worthy to be transferred
into a common-place book. My pupil
reads a few papers daily, without a single
observation on my part. After some time,
I remark to him the difference of com∣position;
which in the course of reading
becomes more and more apparent. The
last step is to put him on distinguishing the
two authors. He at first makes an auk∣ward
figure; but I know from trial, that
he may be brought to distinguish so rea∣dily
as sometimes to name the author
from the very first period. “Foh! says
he, that is Steele, we'll have no more
of him.”</P>
<P><HI>5th,</HI> DURING infancy, authority should
be absolute without relaxation. But let the
<PB N="92" REF="100"/>
parents or governor watch the first dawn
of reason, which ought to be laid hold of
for giving exercise to the judgment of
their pupil. They may begin with pre∣senting
two simple things, and bidding
him choose for himself. Let them proceed
slowly to things less simple. After some
exercise of this kind, it is time to demand
a reason for his choice. If he be at a loss,
a reason may be suggested so slyly, as to
make him think it his own, which will
raise a desire to find out reasons. Exer∣cise
is not more salutary to the body
than to the mind. When he wants to
have any thing done, let him first try
what he can do himself. A savage ha∣ving
none to apply to for advice or di∣rection,
is reduced to judge for himself
at every turn: he makes not a single step
without thinking before hand what is to
follow; by which means, a young savage
is commonly enduced with more penetra∣tion,
than an Oxford or Cambridge scho∣lar.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="101"/>
In point of education, I hold it bet∣ter
for a young man to err sometimes on
his own judgment, than to follow im∣plicitly
the more mature judgement of
his preceptor. A boy who is never per∣mitted
to think for himself till he is 15,
will probably continue a boy for life.</P>
<P>HITHERTO of improving our active
virtues. We proceed to the improvement
of our restraining virtues. When chil∣dren
are very young, the parent has no
way for checking an irregular appetite,
but authority alone, and this is handled
in the section immediately foregoing.
When the faculty of reason begins to ap∣pear,
then is the time for reasoning with
your children, and for displaying to them
the bad consequences of indulging any
irregular appetite. Let them be indulged
freely in every thing that tends to their
good; but give no quarter to what may
tend to harm them. A young man, ac∣customed
<PB N="94" REF="102"/>
from childhood to weigh his
inclinations, and to restrain what may be
hurtful, is fitted for making an amiable
figure. A young man on the contrary
who has been gratified in every desire
without restraint, can never make a good
figure. Every splendid object strikes
his fancy, and raises a desire of making
it his own. If admitted to a palace, he
is mortified that his father's house is so
mean; and still more, that he himself
makes no figure compared with the land∣lord.
If he meets with a young man
more gaily dressed than himself, he mur∣murs
at the avarice of his parents. Nor
can such mortification have any end;
for among the numberless objects of his
wishes, there are perhaps very few within
his reach. And now to particulars.</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> WHEN any irregular appetite breaks
out, endeavour immediately to repress it.
Vanity like several other passions, disap∣points
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>
its aim. Its aim is to make a fi∣gure;
and yet it renders the person an
object of ridicule, never of respect: not
to mention, that it lays open an unguard∣ed
heart to the machinations of persons
ill inclined. Cimon the Athenian amassed
a great fortune; but bestowed it liberally
on the poor, and on keeping an open
table for every person who wanted a din∣ner.
“What comparison, says Plutarch,
between the table of Cimon, simple,
frugal, popular, and that of Lucullus,
contrived for ostentation, and to feed
the luxurious.” Nothing fosters va∣nity
in a young creature so much as
dressing it out gorgeously; and yet a
fond parent instead of endeavouring to
correct that vice, is prone to give it en∣couragement.
When little miss is dres∣sed
in her new gown, one would ima∣gine
the mother wants to make it vain
of itself. <HI>Her darling, her little angel,</HI> are
appellations liberally bestowed. A child,
<PB N="96" REF="104"/>
perceiving this bias in its mother, values
dress highly, and despises every one who
goes more plain. Is there no hazard that
children thus trained, will when grown
up, regard dress as the chief qualification
of people of fashion? To correct or
restrain an appetite for fine cloaths,
the following method among others
promises success. Load your girl with
ornaments. Say to those in company,
that she never looked worse. One adds,
is she not pretty enough to become a
more simple dress? Take away every
superfluous ornament, and then com∣mend
her appearance: “How genteel
and how sweet she now looks.” The
girl will acquire a taste for simplicity.
Get your son a coat daubed over with
gold or silver, but so ill made as to pain
him. Bespeak people to ridicule him for
his finery. He will be glad to change
this nasty coat for one more easy and
more agreeable. Were it the fashion
<PB N="97" REF="105"/>
among people of rank to dress their
children plain, it would have a wonder∣ful
good effect, not only on themselves,
but on their inferiors. Young people
would learn to despise fine cloaths, and
to value themselves on good behaviour:
neatness and elegance would be the sole
aim in dress. As soon as children are
susceptible of verbal instruction, let them
know that the chief use of cloaths is to
keep them warm; and that to be distin∣guished
by their finery, will make them
either be envied or ridiculed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pharnabasus, lord lieutenant to the king of Per∣sia, had invited Agesilaus, king of Lacedemon, to treat of peace with him; and the interview was in the open field. The first appeared in all the pomp and luxury of the Persian court. He was dressed in a purple robe embroidered with gold and silver: the ground was spread with rich carpets, and fine cu∣shions were laid down to sit on. Agesilaus, in a plain dress, sat down on the grass without any cere∣mony. The pride of the Persian was confounded; and he appeared little in the eyes of the beholders compared with the Lacedemonian.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="106"/>
A YOUNG man disposed to self-conceit,
meets with frequent causes of humilia∣tion:
the first affront stings him to the
heart. Compare this young man with
one who puts no value on himself above
his merit. The latter is esteemed by all,
caressed by many, and gains some real
friends. Modesty is indeed one of the
most attractive virtues that belongs to
man. The Prince of Condé and the
Marischal de Turenne, the greatest gene∣rals
of their time, possessed each of them
that virtue in perfection. It is observed,
that those who heard them talk of their
wars, were surprised at their reserve,—not
a word that had the least appearance
of vanity: they scarce ever mentioned
themselves. How different the vanity
of Cicero, eternally sounding his own
praises. Vanity is one of the unlucky
passions that labours against itself: in∣stead
of raising the man, it lessens him
in the esteem of others.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="107"/>
<HI>2d,</HI> MODERATE self-esteem ought to be
cherished even in children; and it springs
early, making them ashamed when told
that what they have done is below them.
Pride is self-esteem in excess; which is
hateful, and ought to be repressed by
every possible mortification. Inculcate in∣to
your pupil as soon as he is capable of
understanding you, that however distin∣guished
the high may be from the low,
the rich from the poor, yet that every
one ought to be treated with civility, not
excepting even your servants who depend
on you for bread. Paint to him in lively
colours the aversion that all have against
proud persons; that they can have no
friends nor even wellwishers; and there∣fore,
that if he be infected with that disease,
he ought carefully to conceal it. Observe
to him, that the moderate man is happy,
because he is contented with his lot; but
that the proud man must be unhappy,
<PB N="100" REF="108"/>
because he never thinks himself suffici∣ently
respected.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> OBSTINACY is a disagreeable qua∣lity
in society. As in a state, authority
and command are confined to a few in∣dividuals
among multitudes who are tied
to obedience, your children ought to be
so disciplined, as to yield readily even to
those of their own age. Make them sen∣sible
that they will be more praised in
yielding, even when they are in the right,
than to be stiff and obstinate. Introduce
your children after their own dinner, to
your guests when the desert is on the
table. “You shall have, says the mo∣ther,
what single thing you choose,
but nothing unless you all agree.”
Each will readily renounce what pleases
their own palate, rather than get nothing.
But to whateve praise a yielding temper
may be entitled, instruct your pupil that
it is still more praise worthy to be obsti∣nate
<PB N="101" REF="109"/>
against what is faulty. Too great
facility, such as is apt to lead a young
person astray, is a weakness that ought
to be carefully guarded against. Young
men are misled, by the vicious inclina∣tions
of others more frequently than by
their own: they are ashamed of scrupling
to do what their companions do without
scruple. Rousseau mentions a young
officer who was averse to the debauche∣ries
of his fellows; but was carried along
from the dread of ridicule. “I am, says
he, like a man who begins to use to∣bacco:
the relish will come by prac∣tice;
and I must not always be a
child.”</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> CURIOSITY about future events, is a
weakness no less common than hurtful. As
human nature is more susceptible of pain
than of pleasure, joy from the foresight of
good, would be greatly overbalanced by
affliction from the foresight of bad. Why
<PB N="102" REF="110"/>
then impatienly seek to cross the will of
the Deity, who with superlative benevo∣lence
has hid futurity from us in utter
darkness? Banish from the mind of your
pupil, prognostics, omens, and such trash,
generated by superstition, which harrass
men more than war or pestilence. Do
you wish to know what will befal you?
Consult your own principles of action,
your condition of life, and the circum∣stances
you are in: these with experience
will give you all the foresight of futurity
that nature intends, or that will be for
your good. At any rate, expose not your∣self
to be laughed at for giving faith to
an impostor, who, grossly ignorant of the
present, pretends to see into futurity;
and who knows as little of your destiny
as you do of his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A miserable victim of this delusion was Henry IV. of France, one of the ablest men that ever drew breath. A prediction of some foolish astrolo∣ger that he would be murdered, so particular as to name the day, sunk deep into his heart. As the day approached, his mind was in a manner unhinged: he could not eat, sleep, nor rest in a place. The Duke de Sully, who seems to have been no less af∣fected than his master, mentions one circumstance not a little singular, that upon the fatal day he used no precaution for his safety; that on the contrary, having called for his coach, he forbade the guards to follow him. This famous prediction, which at the time astonished all Europe, would not at present be regarded. Of a hundred such predictions, the ninety-nine that miscarry are instantly forgotten; whereas the single one that happens accidentally to be verified, makes a figure in the imagination, and is recorded as a wonder.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="111"/>
<HI>5th,</HI> IT is a conceit of Aristotle, that
every virtue is placed between two opposite
vices; which indeed holds in some vir∣tues.
Oeconomy stands in the middle
between avarice and prodigality. Avarice
seldom appears in youth: there are how∣ever
instances of it even in childhood.
To check that low appetite, exercise your
child in giving away even what he is
fond of; and caress him if he do it
with a good grace. Observe to him when
he can understand you, that avarice is a
<PB N="104" REF="112"/>
sneaking vice, below a gentleman; and
that it makes a man unhappy, because it
makes him grudge to lay out money even
on necessaries. Add, that riches are sub∣ject
to the accidents of fortune; and that
an avaricious man, after hoarding up
money by starving, may in an instant be
deprived of all. See the <HI>Art of Thinking,</HI>
No. 27. On the other hand, as examples
make a deeper impression than dry pre∣cepts,
the best way of extinguishing any
seeds of dissipation in your pupil, is to
point out to him men reduced by extra∣vagance
from opulence to beggary. If
you find him inclined to loose women,
carry him to an hospital infected with the
most loathsome of all diseases.</P>
<P><HI>6th,</HI> THE passion that is the most difficult
to be restrained, and yet of all the most ne∣cessary
to be restrained, is anger; which
alone has occasioned more mischief than
all the other passions together. Experience
<PB N="105" REF="113"/>
of its sad consequences, may in a think∣ing
person do much; and the tutor's
lectures with proper instances, may pro∣duce
some effect. But there is a simple
lesson more easily understood by a young
person, and more effectual, which is, to
be obstinately silent while you are angry.
Let it be kept in memory what Socrates
said to a slave who had misbehaved, “I
would treat thee as thou deservest,
were I not in a passion.” This restraint
may be at first difficult; but by due
attention in the tutor it will become easy,
and prevent every bad effect of the pas∣sion.
If it be thought too difficult to in∣sist
upon so perfect a cure at once, be∣gin
with instructing your pupil to copy
a Roman Emperor, who made it a rule,
that before opening his mouth in wrath,
he should repeat leisurely all the letters
of the alphabet. I promise such an effect
to this simple rule, as in time to lead the
pupil to keep silence while any degree of
<PB N="106" REF="114"/>
the passion remains. Above all, the young
man should be doubly on his guard when
injured or affronted. A fiery temper break∣ing
out upon every insult, is ill qualified
for society: if not early restrained, it will
occasion manifold distresses. The very best
way to avoid great injuries, is to overlook
or dissemble what are small. This holds
in an especial manner with respect to the
female sex. Women, who are not framed
for single combat, ought above all things
to dread the making a noise in the world.
For subduing the impatience of your pu∣pil
under an injury, one good method is
to give him examples of distresses occa∣sioned
by such impatience. In the histo∣ry
of ancient Greece, there is a glorious
instance of the good effects of restraint.
Euribiades, admiral of the Grecian fleet
collected against the Persians, angry to be
opposed in the council of war by Themi∣stocles
a young officer, brandished his
staff in a threatening manner. “Strike,
<PB N="107" REF="115"/>
said Themistocles, but hear me first.”
Subdued by this signal instance of self-command,
Euribiades listened, followed
the advice of the young officer, and ob∣tained
a complete victory. The cool be∣haviour
of Themistocles saved Greece,
which probably would have been ruined
by the old general. Perciles the Athe∣nian
general, was attacked one day in the
public forum before the people by a
brutish fellow, with much opprobrious
language. And in his return home, he
was followed by the same person venting
his wrath in the same stile. It being now
dark, he ordered his servant to light the
man home, for fear he should lose his
way. Arcadius an Argive, who had been
in a course of reviling Philip king of Ma∣cedon,
was apprehended and brought be∣fore
him; but was courteously treated
and sent away with presents. The king
being informed that the Argive had chan∣ged
his note and was full of his praises,
<PB N="108" REF="116"/>
“Look you now, says he, am not I a
better physician than any of you? I
have cured a foul mouth'd fellow by
presents, which would not have been
done had I followed your advice of
punising him.”</P>
<P>THE <HI>third</HI> head contains a few relative
matters, to which we proceed.</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> FOR training young people to bear
disappointments, facts may contribute
as well as precepts. Give your children
hopes of what will be agreeable, a ball
for example, a race, the return of a bro∣ther
after a long absence; and upon the
disappointment, exhort them to bear it
with a good grace: this will have a much
finer effect than exhortations in general.
But let the disappointment appear to pro∣ceed
from chance; for if they perceive
your intention, they will conclude that
it was done to vex them, not to improve
<PB N="109" REF="117"/>
their temper. A gentleman, though other∣ways
of good understanding, erred in this
branch of education. He had three come∣ly
girls between twelve and sixteen; and
to enure them to bear disappointments,
he would propose to make a visit, which
he knew would delight them. The coach
was bespoke; and the young ladies, com∣pletely
armed for conquest, were ready
to take their seats. But behold! their
father had changed his mind. This in∣deed
was a disappointment; but as it ap∣peared
to proceed from whim or caprice,
it might sour their temper instead of im∣proving
it. Children are early sensible
of ill treatment; and when the parental
authority is too far stretched, a child
obeys from fear not from affection.</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> IT is a capital duty in parents, to
teach their children to bear with and ex∣cuse
the faults of their companions. There
are even adult persons who perceive no
<PB N="110" REF="118"/>
blemish in one they love, nor any virtue
in one they hate. To correct that wrong
bias in young persons, is not an easy un∣dertaking,
nor to be attempted till they
have acquired some share of understand∣ing.
Talk to your pupils of their com∣panions.
Point out faults, which how∣ever
are so slight, compared with their
good qualities, as to make them not the
less deserving of affection. Instruct your
pupils, that perfection is not to be found
in any human being: bid them reflect
whether they themselves are entirely ex∣empt
from failings. And conclude with
observing, that among friends and com∣panions,
it is a sweet commerce to forgive
one another. If proper opportunities be
taken, such lessons will produce two good
effects, namely, to excuse the faults of a
friend, and to respect virtue in an enemy:
the latter will soften enmity; and the
former will cement friendship.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="119"/>
<HI>3d,</HI> IN the third section at the begin∣ning,
are contained instructions for keep∣ing
children always employed. I here
add several particulars on the same sub∣ject,
fitted for children farther advanced
in years. A girl of eight or nine may be
trained to assist her mother in serving the
guests at table. Let her be seated with∣in
reach of a pudding, or of any thing
that requires little carving, ready to help
those who call for it. In a short time,
she may be employed in dissecting a
chicken or even a pullet. The notion of
being useful and behaving like her mam∣ma,
inspires her with a certain dignity
of behaviour, and sets her above childish
amusements. It has pained me to see a
young woman of seventeen or eighteen,
applying a knife so aukwardly as with
difficulty to dissect what is on her own
plate. How mean must be her appear∣ance
at the head of her own table! I am
acquainted with the mistress of a great
<PB N="112" REF="120"/>
family, who gives still more employment
to her daughter, not above the age of se∣ven.
The child is employed to inspect
the bed-rooms, that every thing may be
in order for the guests. A company were
to depart about eight in the morning.
“Child,” says the lady, “I perhaps may
not be up so early. Be ready to at∣tend
the company: see that every thing
be prepared for breakfast; and be sure
to attend them to their coach.”</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> NEXT of an article that ought not
to be neglected, and yet is not a little dif∣ficult,
which is to accustom children to
acknowledge their faults. It is not suf∣ficient
that parents by gentle treatment
have acquired the affection of their chil∣dren:
education will go on but imper∣fectly,
if children be not also trained to
place confidence in their parents, and to
apply to them freely in every difficulty.
The nicest point of all, is to enure them
<PB N="113" REF="121"/>
to an ingenuous confession of faults, the
only case in which I approve auricular
confession. This practice, early com∣menced,
will soon become habitual. A
child cuts a finger, or breaks a china cup.
It is unhappy till it acquaint its father
or mother how it happened. Let a can∣did
acknowledgment be an absolute par∣don:
let it be the part of the parent to
mitigate the fault; and to observe, that
the child deserves more praise for its
frank confession, than blame for the fault
it has committed; that the fear of disco∣very
when a fault is concealed, makes a
heavy heart; but that the heart is re∣lieved
by a fair confession. Affection to
parents leads children to put confidence
in them. What is there to obstruct that
confidence, but harshness and severity?
A child will never confess a fault if afraid
to be ill treated: it will dissemble, it will
lie, it will do any thing to avoid disco∣very.
When a child withdraws from its
<PB N="114" REF="122"/>
parents and makes any other person its
confident, farewel to education. But
when children are treated kindly, they
never think of any confident but the per∣son
who takes care of them. By kindly
treatment, the heart is laid open, and
every wrong bias is discovered, which
afford a fair opportunity for good culture.
Let us look forward to a child's riper
years, and reflect on the habit of can∣dour
and ingenuity thus acquired: what
anxious thoughts, what dissimulation,
must this charming habit have prevent∣ed!</P>
<P>AMONG the various ways of training
children to confess their faults, the fol∣lowing
can scarce fail of being successful.
Returning home after a visit of a week or
two, put each of your children to say,
what good has been done by the rest;
and what ill itself has done. The former
endears them to one another, the latter
<PB N="115" REF="123"/>
restrains them from committing faults.
Make these articles the subject of conver∣sation:
endeavour to ripen the under∣standing
of the young creatures, by show∣ing
them what is right and what is wrong.
But be careful to provide a trusty person
to inform you of any fault that has been
concealed. Say to the child slightly,
“Surely, my dear, you have a bad me∣mory,
did you not do so and so.” It
will think it vain to hide, as “Papa or
Mamma knows every thing.”</P>
<P>IT is a pregnant sign of a good disposi∣tion,
that a child of itself corrects a fault.
A girl between three and four, having
got a present of fruit, was desired by its
mother to give part of it to her compa∣nions.
Having reserved a large share to
herself, she distributed the rest, giving
some to an elder sister, now a woman.
After devouring what she had retained,
she desired back her sister's share, and got
<PB N="116" REF="124"/>
it. The mother expostulated, but in vain;
and having left the room, the sister said,
“My dear, I make you welcome to the
fruit, but you behave ill in disobeying
your mamma.” This gentle reproof,
having touched the child in the tender
part, that of obedience, had its effect.
After a day or two, she requested more
fruit from her mother, which, with an
air of satisfaction she carried to the sister.
Correction may be necessary sometimes;
but for a child to correct a fault of its
own accord, is extremely pleasant. A
child about three years of age, took some
cotton thread which Miss B—was sow∣ing
upon muslin. “Pray child give me
the cotton, you will dirty it.” The
child refusing, Miss B—, laying aside her
work, said gravely, “Would you have
been pleased had I dirtied your doll?”
Some weeks after, the child observing
cotton thread in the hands of another
young lady, begged earnestly for it to
<PB N="117" REF="125"/>
give to Miss B—. Such instances suggest
the following rule. When a child from
petulence or perverseness misbehaves
grossly, stern authority ought to be in∣terposed.
In other faults, expostulation
and advice are far better.</P>
<P>A voluntary confession is a still more
pregnant sign of a good disposition. A
young lady aged eleven, of a rank higher
than which there are none, having hurt
a finger accidentally, showed some degree
of impatience. The governess, having
in vain endeavoured to shame her out of
it, left the room with a reproachful look,
saying, that she could not bear to see such
concern for a mere trifle. In less than
an hour, she received a billet from her
pupil, acknowledging her misbehaviour,
and intreating to be forgiven. Happy
temper! the richest gift that nature has
to bestow, and of which nature is far
from being prodigal. Few there are of
<PB N="118" REF="126"/>
any rank who are blessed with a temper
so pliant; fewer still of high rank. But
the praise must not be attributed entirely
to temper: seldom is pure nature so re∣fined.
The young lady owes much to
an affectionate mother, whose high sta∣tion
has not made her relax from attend∣ing
to the education of her children, with
a degree of prudence and sagacity, that
would give lustre to persons much infe∣rior
in rank.</P>
<P><HI>5th,</HI> CHILDREN are far from being all
of them equally flexible. It required a
week to make a boy of two years dip his
fingers in water after dinner. Example
had no effect, nor exhortation. The mo∣ther
put into the glass fruit he was fond
of: neither did that prevail. She thought
at last of the gardener's son, a child of
the same age, who readily dipt his fingers
and laid hold of the fruit. Emulation
prevailed: young master dipped his fin∣gers
<PB N="119" REF="127"/>
instantly. I am pleased with the in∣genuity
of the mother; but relish not the
struggling against accidental aversions,
which time will correct without trouble.
Authority, instead of subduing, tends to
rivet such an aversion. It is not always
easy to distinguish an acquired aversion
from what is natural; and when autho∣rity
is interposed, may not there be a ha∣zard
of struggling against nature? Many
surely will remember certain eatables
abhorred by them when children, which
at present they are fond of without
having suffered persecution. In health,
nature is the surest guide in the choice
of food. The same food may be salu∣tary
at one period of life, and not at a∣nother.
Will parents pretend to be wiser
than nature? I am far, however, from
wishing to have children indulged in
whim or fancy. If a child refuses what
is set before it, hunger will soon bring
<PB N="120" REF="128"/>
it to order. If it constantly refuse after
repeated trials, the averstion must have
a deeper root than whim or fancy.</P>

<PB REF="129"/>
<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">INSTRUCTIONS that occasionally may be ap∣plied
in every Stage of Education.</HEAD>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> NEGLECT no favourable opportu∣nity
of instilling into your pu∣pils,
that a man ought to be regarded in
proportion to the good he does; and
that compared with the being useful,
the distinction between rich and poor,
high and low, is of little importance;
that an industrious peasant who edu∣cates
his children to be useful members
of society, is entitled to more respect
than the great lord, who, in the midst
of indigent neighbours, lavishes immense
sums upon himself, without ever think∣ing
of others.</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> MAKE your pupil sensible, that in
order to save for charity or benevolence,
oeconomy is an estimable virtue. Au∣gustus
Caesar, Emperor of Rome, never
<PB N="122" REF="130"/>
wore a garment but what was spun by
his wife Livia or his sister Octavia. Sci∣pio,
the glory of Rome and terror of
Carthage, dressed his garden with his
own hands. The venerable old senator
Fabricius, illustrious by many triumphs,
supped commonly on the herbs that he
himself had raised. A stranger who
wishes to be well received, ought to be
handsomely dressed; but a plain coat
sits better on a man of known eminence,
who will be copied by others, without
derogating from his rank.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> SELF-LOVE makes us labour for
ourselves; benevolence makes us labour
for others: emulation is added to en∣force
these motives to action. Emula∣tion,
inherent in the nature of man, ap∣pears
even in children: they strive for
victory without knowing what makes
them strive. Emulation kept within
proper bounds is an useful principle,
<PB N="123" REF="131"/>
and far from being unsociable: it be∣comes
only so, when by excess it dege∣nerates
into envy. Why then is it ba∣nished
by Rousseau, from his system of
education? Was it his purpose to distin∣guish
his <HI>Eleve</HI> from the rest of man∣kind,
by a peculiar nature? Approba∣tion
is bestowed on those who behave
well; but in struggling for victory, the
prospect of being approved is a very
faint motive compared with emulation.
Through the force of that incitement,
a young man will perservere in acquiring
knowledge, who without it, would have
made no progress. It ought, therefore,
to be the study of every teacher, to give
such a direction to emulation in his pu∣pil,
as to produce the greatest effect. A
crowd of competitors damps it: a very
small number is not sufficient to rouse it.
The proper stage for emulation, is a pri∣vate
school, admitting not above twelve
<PB N="124" REF="132"/>
or fifteen disciples. A family of six or
seven children, may give exercise to it.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> WITH respect to the improvement
of memory, it is severe to make children
get by heart prayers, psalms, or other
dry compositions, which they neither re∣lish,
nor can well understand. Put into
their hands short historical ballads that
make virtuous impressions, or give lively
descriptions of objects they are acquaint∣ed
with, especially of the gay and ludi∣crous
kind. These they will get by
heart of their own accord, and be fond
to repeat them to their parents or their
companions. This exercise ought to be
entirely voluntary. Were the getting a
thing by heart imposed as a task by the
preceptor, it would be easy to some and
a heavy burden upon others. Emula∣tion
ought to be here excluded, except,
perhaps, among boys who are found to
be equal in point of memory.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="133"/>
<HI>5th,</HI> THERE is no branch of discipline
that ought to be exercised with more
caution, than the distribution of rewards
and punishments. If money, a fine coat,
or what pleases the palate, be the reward
promised; is it not the ready way to fo∣ment
avarice, vanity, or luxury? Praise
is an efficacious reward, of which even
children are fond; and when properly
applied, it never fails to produce good
behaviour. Punishment requires still
more caution; as it ought to be propor∣tioned
to the temper of the pupil as well
as to the nature of the fault. I cannot
recollect a fault that requires corporal
punishment but obstinancy, which is in∣herent
in some persons. Lying I think
may be corrected or rather prevented by
proper management: my reason is, that
it is not inherent in our nature, but for∣ced
upon a child by harsh treatment.
Any fault except obstinacy, that a child
can be guilty of, may be repressed by
<PB N="126" REF="134"/>
shame and disgrace, which sink deep in∣to
the heart of children, as well as of
men and woman. To keep children in
awe by the fear of corporal punishment,
will put them upon hiding their faults,
instead of correcting them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si cui tam est mens illiberalis, ut objurgatione non corrigatur: is etiam ad plagas, ut pessima quae∣que mancipia, durabiter. <HI>Quintil.</HI> lib. 1. c. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I GLADLY lay hold of this opportunity
to make a general obsevation, of no
slight importance with respect to educa∣tion.
Among savages, whose ruling pas∣sions
are anger and resentment, every
thing is carried on by force and fear.
That savage practice makes still some
figure among polished nations. Schools
for education were erected upon the pri∣ciple
of punishment; very unhappily in∣deed,
as punishment, instead of softening
or improving manners, tends to harden
those who suffer by it. Humanity in
time prevailed over vicious education;
<PB N="127" REF="135"/>
and a sacred truth was discovered, that
man is a creature from whom every thing
may be obtained by love, nothing by
fear. The severity of school-punishments,
has gradually yielded to the conviction
of this important truth; and yet such
is the force of custom, that instances re∣main,
not a few, of the old stile of edu∣cation.
To dwell upon these instances,
would be irksome: I confine myself to
one, illustrious indeed, as it relates to E∣ton,
a school in high vogue. In that
school, there stands exposed to open view,
the terrible block that the boys must
kneel upon to receive a flogging, perhaps
as often from the bad humour of the
master as from the demerit of the offend∣er.
And that the boys may never lose
sight of punishment, matters are so con∣trived
as to furnish examples once a
week at least, chiefly on Monday, which
in the language of the school, has obtain∣ed
the illustrious appellation of the day
<PB N="128" REF="136"/>
of doom. Would one imagine, that a
discipline so brutal, should stand firm,
even against the humanity of our present
manners. Glad am I to be able to
give testimony in favour of my native
country, that in our schools, few traces
remain of that inhuman practice. I dare
not say none, were I even to keep with∣in
the capital.</P>
<P><HI>6th,</HI> THE last recommendation I shall
give on the present head, is, that young
persons, male and female, should have
always at hand a common-place book,
for keeping in remembrance observations
made in reading, reflecting, conversing,
travelling. The advantages are mani∣fold.
<HI>First,</HI> it keeps the attention awake,
in order that nothing of importance may
escape. Consider this practice as to read∣ing.
A person who reads merely for
amusement, gives little attention: ideas
glide through the mind, and vanish in∣stantly.
<PB N="129" REF="137"/>
But let a common-place book
be in view: attention is on the stretch to
find matter, and impressions are made that
the memory retains. <HI>Next,</HI> The judgment
is in constant exercise, in order to dis∣tinguish
what particulars deserve remem∣brance.
<HI>Third,</HI> Perseverance in this prac∣tice,
brings on a habit of expressing our
thoughts readily and distictly. <HI>Fourth,</HI>
A facility of writing currently is acquired.
And, in the <HI>last</HI> place, it fills up time
pleasantly, and makes activity habitual.</P>
<P><HI>7th,</HI> THE following hints are directed
more immediately to the governors. The
bad habits that children are apt to ac∣quire
from servants, are an obstruction
to education. I know of no remedy, but
to keep children as much as possible un∣der
the eye of their parents. This will
be no restraint, if they be fond of their
parents; which they always are, when
kindly treated and indulged in innocent
<PB N="130" REF="138"/>
freedom. It should be held as a punish∣ment
for a fault, to be ordered down
stairs among the servants. But this re∣quires
circumspect conduct on the part
of the parents; who ought carefully to
avoid the doing or saying of any thing
but what they wish their children to
imitate. It is amazing, how early chil∣dren
adopt the manners of those they are
among. This circumspection ought to
be extended even to the persons who are
hired to attend them.</P>
<P>LET truth prevail in all your instruc∣tions:
in reasoning with your children,
never use any artifice. Some children
are quick of discernment: the discovery
of an artifice will tempt them to pay their
guides in the same coin.</P>
<P>THE keeper ought to be well acquaint∣ed
with the mute language of the infant
under her care. An infant cries from
<PB N="131" REF="139"/>
bodily pain. It cries when it is hungry;
and gives over when it sees things pre∣pared
for feeding it. It is not uncom∣mon
in a child at play, to fall a-crying;
not from anger, but from inability to ex∣press
what it wants. If the keeper be
ignorant of what troubles the child, she
will be at a loss about a remedy.</P>
<P>IF a child have any defect in its shape
that cannot easily be hid, let the defect
be frankly acknowledged, and even made
a joke of at times. This will prevent
whispering, which always makes a de∣fect
appear worse than it really is. Phi∣lopemen,
the greatest General of his age,
was of a mean apperance. He went to
an invited dinner in his camp-dress, with∣out
a single attendant. Being taken for
one of the General's servants, he was or∣dered
to the kitchen to cut logs for the
fire. His friend the landlord, seeing
<PB N="132" REF="140"/>
him in his waistcoat at that work, “Bless
me General,” says he, “what are you
doing here? I am,” answers the Ge∣neral,
“playing for my bad looks.”</P>

<PB REF="141"/>
<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PECULIARITIES respecting the Educa∣tion
of FEMALES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> THE different instincts of the two
sexes appear very early. A boy
is continually in action, loves a drum, a
top, to ride on a stick. A girl, wishing
to be agreeable, is fond of ornaments
that please the eye. She begins with a
doll, which she dresses and undresses, to
try what ornaments will suit best. In
due time, the doll is laid aside; and the
young woman's own person becomes the
object of her attention. This instinct
rightly directed, advances from propriety
of dress to that of behaviour, still in or∣der
to please. Employ therefore a young
girl upon what will adorn her: she will
apply to the needle more willingly than
to reading or writing. As she advances,
<PB N="134" REF="142"/>
let her be taught the art of drawing, not
human figures, which cannot be made
ornamental, but leaves, flowers, and such
things as tend to enliven her dress. Chil∣dren
are fond of lively colours; and hence
their taste for showy dress and ornaments
of gold and silver. Here the prudent
mother interposes with a lesson “that
dress ought to be suited to the age and
rank of the wearer; that simplicity is
becoming in dress as well as in man∣ners;
that the fashion should not be
totally disregarded, but that it ought to
yield to propriety.” A fond mother
never thinks of such a lesson; beauty is
exalted above every qualification: and if
a girl have any share of it, dress alone is
studied. If to her looks can be added a
genteel air and elegant motion in dancing
or walking, she becomes a perfect angel.
Thus, external appearance is highly cul∣tivated,
and little attention given either
to the head or heart. Is it wonderful,
<PB N="135" REF="143"/>
that a young woman so educated, should
make but an aukward figure in educa∣ting
her own children?</P>
<P>FEMALES have a flexible tongue, and
acquire more early than males the use of
speech: their voice is sweeter; and they
talk more. A man says what he knows;
a woman, what is agreeable: knowledge
is necessary to the former; taste is suffi∣cient
to the latter. The politeness of
men consists in offering service; of wo∣men,
in making themselves agreeable.
In the politeness of men, there is more
or less of dissimulation; none in that of
women, for they love to be agreeable.
Hence it is, that politeness has a more
pleasing air in young women, than in
young men.</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> A MAN'S conduct depends mostly
on the approbation of his own conscience;
that of a woman, greatly on the opinion
<PB N="136" REF="144"/>
of others. A man who does his duty,
can brave censure: a woman's conduct
ought to be exemplary, in order to be
esteemed by all. The least doubt of her
chastity, deprives her of every comfort in
the matrimonial state. In the education
of females accordingly, no motive has a
greater influence, than the thought of
what people will say of them. Boys are
not so tractable: it requires much dis∣cipline
to make them bend to the opi∣nion
of others. Hence, to be esteemed
by all, modesty and reserve are essen∣tial
in young women; to acquire which,
they ought to be taught early to sup∣press
their desires, and to have a strict
attention to decency and decorum. But
under such restraint, let the occupations
of young women be made as agreeable as
possible. A girl who loves her mother
or her governess, will work the whole day
at her side without wearying, provided
she be allowed to prattle, which is her fa∣vourite
<PB N="137" REF="145"/>
amusement. A girl who loves
not her mother above all the world, sel∣dom
turns to good. Even confinement
properly managed, rivets her attachment;
because children are made sensible by na∣ture,
that obedience is their duty, and
that it is good for them to be governed.
Indulge gaiety, indulge laughter, indulge
play, but still within moderate bounds.
Draw them frequently from play to
work, but in so soft a way as to pre∣vent
murmuring: custom will make the
change easy, and produce in time en∣tire
submission to the mother's will.
This is essential to the female sex, for
ever subjected to the authority of a single
person, or to the opinion of all.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> FEMALE children ought to be hardily
bred, not only for their own health, but
to have a healthy offspring. Chiefly with
a view to the latter, it was fashionable
for the Spartan young ladies to mix with
<PB N="138" REF="146"/>
the men in military games, not excepting
wrestling and other violent exercises.
This surely was not prompted by nature,
which does not intend women to be so
robust. For the sake of health, all that
is necessary is plain food, with frequent
walking or riding.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> AT Athens, the young women ap∣peared
frequently in public, but separate
from the young men. In every feast, in
every sacrifice, in every public solemnity,
the daughters of the principal citizens
were introduced, crowned with flowers,
dancing in parties, singing hymns, and
presenting offerings to their deities. Such
exercises, beside contributing to health,
formed the taste of the young women to
what is proper and agreeable; and made
them objects of desire without hazarding
their morals. In France, the education
of young women is very different. They
are shut up in a convent, and never taste
<PB N="139" REF="147"/>
freedom till they are married. A system
of education more hurtful to morals, is
scarce within the reach of invention.
Unnatural confinement in a convent,
makes a young woman embrace with a∣vidity
every pleasure, when she is set free.
To relish domestic life, one must be ac∣quainted
with it; for it is in the house
of her parents that a young woman ac∣quires
the relish. A discreet matron will
attend her daughters to an assembly, to
an opera, to the play-house; but she will
instruct them, that the pleasure they find
there, ought to be considered as an a∣musement
merely, unfit to employ much
of the time of young women, who are
destined by nature to govern a family.
What can be more preposterous than the
behaviour of an idle woman, leading her
daughters from riot to riot, without gi∣ving
admission to a sedate thought? A
lady carried to Bath her two daughters,
aged between twelve and fourteen, in or∣der
<PB N="140" REF="148"/>
to give them some notion of living
in public. Their natural gaiety, she
thought, would be improved by the gaie∣ty
of the place; that the company at
Bath would contribute to form their
manners; and that they were too young
to suffer by their male companions. It
was her opinion, that her daughters were
of a proper age for relishing public meet∣ings,
without losing the taste of domestic
tranquillity.</P>
<P><HI>5th,</HI> IN training young women, ex∣hibite
every thing to them in an agree∣able
light; and in particular, suffer them
not to imagine that there can be any pain
in doing what is right. Is it painful for
a young woman to make herself ami∣able
in order to be loved, to make her∣self
estimable in order to be esteemed,
to behave honourably in order to be ho∣noured?
The influence of a young wo∣man,
commences with her virtues. What
<PB N="141" REF="149"/>
man is there, however rough in temper,
who softens not his behaviour to a young
woman of sixteen, interesting even by her
bashfulness, and commanding that re∣spect
from all which she bestows on all?
Virtue is essential to genuine love. To
support that sweet passion in any refined
degree, there must be mutual esteem,
which cannot subsist without virtue. How
despicable in my eyes must that creature
be, with whom I have no connection but
for the sake merely of animal desire?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPENDIX TO SECTION VI.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER so much dry matter, some
relaxation will probably be made
welcome; and in that view the following
female characters are presented. The first,
by Marivaux, is a character of which be∣nignity
of heart is the ruling principle.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="150"/>
MADAME de Miran had considerable
remains of beauty; but there appeared in
her countenance, something so good and
so rational as to obscure these remains.
Frankness and good nature are not
friendly to love. We admire the wo∣man,
but her graces make little impres∣sion:
we enjoy her company, without
thinking that she is pretty, but only that
she is the best creature in the world. I
have accordingly heard little of Madame
de Miran's lovers, but much of her
friends. It is reported, that she had
friends even of her own sex; which I
can believe, considering her plain and
innocent mien, which gave no jealousy
to her female companions, and made
her appear more like a confident than a
rival.</P>
<P>TO a physiognomy more pleasing than
bewitching, to eyes demanding amity
more than love, was added a genteel fi∣gure,
<PB N="143" REF="151"/>
which might have given desire had
she so inclined; but she never studied
any motion but what was necessary.</P>
<P>WITH respect to her understanding, I
know not that any one ever thought of
praising it; nor do I know that any one
ever said it was deficient. It was of a
sort that is listened to attentively; but
without being censured or applauded.</P>
<P>EVEN in matters of indifference, Ma∣dame
de Miran said nothing, thought
nothing, but what verified that abound∣ing
goodness which was the foundation
of her character. But do not imagine it
to be a silly or blind goodness, ridiculed
even by those whom it serves. Her's was
a virtue, an emanation from an excellent
heart, which never exerted itself at the ex∣pence
of reason, nor of justice. She had
not indeed any of that quality termed
nobleness of soul: her goodness was
<PB N="144" REF="152"/>
more simple, more amiable, though less
splendid. I have known persons with
that same nobleness of soul, who had not
the best hearts in the world. They were
so occupied with the pleasure of being
generous, as to be negligent of being just.
Such persons love to be praised: Madame
de Miran never once thought of deser∣ving
praise: she never exerted an act of
benevolence in order to gratify herself,
but in order to relieve you. If you ex∣pressed
much gratitude to her, what flat∣tered
her the most was to find you satis∣fied.</P>
<P>I HAD almost forgot one thing, not a
little singular. Though this lady never
vaunted of her own good deeds, you
might vaunt to her of yours with all se∣curity.
The pleasure of hearing you say
that you was good, made your vanity
pass unobserved, or made her think it ex∣cusable.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="153"/>
AS to those tiresome creatures who va∣lue
themselves upon trifles, who are vain
of their rank or their riches, they gave no
vexation to Madame de Miran: she had
no affection for them, and that was all.
Bablers who slander others, though with∣out
intention, gave offence to the good∣ness
of her nature; whereas the vain of∣fended
her reason only. She bore the
loquacious with temper; smiling only at
the fatigue they gave her, without ever
suspecting it. In company with the
whimsical or headstrong who listen not
to reason, she had patience, and was ne∣vertheless
their friend. “They are ho∣nest
people,” she observed, “they have
their little failings, and who is without
them.” A coquet who insists upon
being admired, was lower in her esteem
than a woman who once in her life had
been more in love than a woman ought
to be; it being less faulty in her opinion
<PB N="146" REF="154"/>
to misbehave once, than perpetually to
be tempting others to misbehave.</P>
<P>THIS lady considered religion as chiefly
intended to enforce moral duties. She
respected those who bestow their whole
time on execises of devotion, but with∣out
ever thinking of joining them. Never
had any person better reason to be con∣vinced
of the benignity of the Deity:
her conviction proceeded from her heart;
and no person had a better heart. She
accordinlgy loved God sincerely, without
being disturbed with any superstitious
terrors.</P>
<P>THE next portrait is of a lady every way
accomplished, done by the same hand.</P>
<P>MADAME Dorsin was beautiful; and
yet it was not her beauty that even at first
made the strongest impression. It yield∣ed
to another impression. This wants
<PB N="147" REF="155"/>
explanation. Personify beauty; and sup∣pose
her uneasy for being so strikingly
beautiful; that she wishes to be agreeable
only; and that she endeavours to lessen
her beauty, but without hiding it altoge∣ther.
Such would be the countenance of
Madame Dorsin.</P>
<P>BUT here I talk only of her looks,
what may be expressed in a portrait. Add
a soul that animated her looks, that ren∣dered
them as delicate, as lively, as ele∣vated,
as serious, as jocular, as she herself
was by turns; and then you will be able
to imagine in her looks, an infinity of
expressions beyond the reach of painting.
Let us now examine that soul, since we
are on the subject. When one has little
spirit, it is commonly attributed to de∣fective
organs. An acquaintance, talking
on this subject, said gravely and in learn∣ed
terms, “that the soul is more or less
confined, more or less embarrassed, ac∣cording
<PB N="148" REF="156"/>
to the organs to which it is
united.” If so, nature must have con∣ferred
on Madame Dorsin organs in high
perfection; for never was a soul more
agile than hers, nor less confined in its
operations.</P>
<P>THE spirit that most women exert, is
acquired, not natural. One expresses her∣self
carelessly and with seeming indiffer∣ence,
to make people believe that she can∣not
take the trouble of thinking. One
talks with a serious and decisive air. One
deals in refined thoughts, and pronounces
them in a tone that calls for attention.
One affects to be lively and loud. Ma∣dame
Dorsin affected none of these pecu∣liarities.
It was the subject that gave a
tone to her thoughts; and it was her
thoughts that gave a tone to her expres∣sion.
I hope to be understood when I
say, that her spirit had no sex; and that
it was enchanting when she was in hu∣mour
<PB N="149" REF="157"/>
to display it. Few pretty women
but are over fond to please; and hence
those little affectations which virtually
say, <HI>behold me.</HI> Such apeish tricks were
not relished by Madame Dorsin: her
pride would not permit her to descend
so low. If upon any occasion she relaxed
a little, no one was sensible of the slip but
herself. In general, she valued her un∣derstanding
more than her beauty: it was
her you honoured in praising the former:
it was her figure only, in praising the lat∣ter.
To appear agreeable was not her
study: it would have made her blush if
you could say, “That lady has endea∣voured
to make me fond of her.” In
a word, the only coquetry she could be
suspected of, was her willingness that
you should be sensible, how much she de∣spised
all the little arts of pleasing.</P>
<P>FROM her understanding we proceed to
the qualities of her heart. Her goodness
<PB N="150" REF="158"/>
equalled that of Madame de Miran, but
was of a different cast. Goodness in the
latter was connected with plain sense: in
the former, it was connected with supe∣rior
understanding, which makes it al∣ways
show in the most advantageous
light. When one confers a favour on
me, and seems ignorant of its import∣ance,
my pride is not alarmed, a slight
return of gratitude is in my opinion suf∣ficient.
But a favour done me with a
thorough sense of its importance, humbles
my pride, and lays on me a heavy bur∣den
of gratitude. This was not the only
respect in which the goodness of Madame
Dorsin was preferable. People seldom
have the courage to display all their
wants. Madame de Miran served you
cheerfully, but literally, seeing no far∣ther.
Madame Dorsin, discovering your
wants from your imperfect hints, served
you to the utmost of your wishes. It
was not her you fatigued with your con∣cerns:
<PB N="151" REF="159"/>
she fatigued you. It was you she
advised, pressed, chid for being negligent.
She in a word made your affair her own:
the interest she took in you appeared so
much her own concern, as to lose entire∣ly
the character of generosity. Instead of
thinking as most people do, “I have
served this man, and he owes me much
gratitude,” Madame Dorsin's notion
was, “I have served this man frequent∣ly,
I have accustomed him to depend
on me, I must not disappoint him.”
Your boldness in demanding a favour
charmed her, and was all the gratitude
she wished. It was treating her accord∣ing
to her own heart.</P>
<P>IT is not easy for people of spirit to
bring themselves down to a level with
those who have none—they cannot find
a subject low enough. Madame Dorsin,
though she had a greater share of spirit
than those who have much, yet never
<PB N="152" REF="160"/>
assumed more spirit than others had. She
thought that no human being is entitled
to laugh at the imperfections of others.
Those who had spirit were fond to dis∣play
it in her presence; not as necessary
to please her, but to honour themselves.
She indulged her female companions to
talk at their ease, seldom interrupting
but to approve, to praise, and to allow
them to draw breath.</P>
<P>MEN differing in rank and condi∣tion,
seldom make good company toge∣ther.
Each displays what disinguishes
him above the rest. In Madame Dorsin's
house, there was no thought of rank, nor
of any other distinction. They were
men who conversed with men; and the
strongest reason always prevailed. The
superiority of her genius inspired every
one.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="161"/>
To an excellent heart, to a distinguish∣ed
understanding, was joined a soul supe∣rior
to events, which could be afflicted
but not dejected, and which in distress
one never thinks of pitying, but of prai∣sing.
I have seen her more than once in
affliction; but could never observe, that
it had any effect on the sweetness of her
manners, nor on her tranquillity in con∣versing
with her friends: she gave her
attention wholly to them, though she
had cause to give it wholly to herself.</P>
<P>SHE was adored by her domestics;
who held themselves richer because she
was so, and considered every misfortune
happening to her as happening to them∣selves.
So little notion had they of a se∣parate
interest, that in every particular
they joined themselves with her, “We
have gained a cause, we have purcha∣sed
a farm, we have lost a friend.” She
was highly generous; but the oeconomy
<PB N="154" REF="162"/>
of her domestics made all up. Judge how
amiable the mistress must have been, to
tame, to enchant, a species of beings, the
very best of whom can scarce pardon us
for their servitude, or for our superiority.</P>
<P>THE next portrait is done by the cele∣brated
Rousseau, exhibiting the charac∣ter
of a young woman virtuously edu∣cated.</P>
<P>SOPHIA is not a beauty, but in her
presence beauties are discontented with
themselves. At first, she scarcely appears
pretty; but the more she is beheld, the
more agreeable she appears. She gains
when others lose, and what she gains she
never loses. She is equalled by none in
a sweet expression of countenance; and
without dazzling beholders, she interests
them. She loves dress, and is a good
judge of it; despises finery, but dresses
with peculiar grace, mixing simplicity
<PB N="155" REF="163"/>
with elegance. Ignorant she is of what
colours are in fashion; but knows well
what suits her complexion. She covers
her beauties, but so slightly or rather art∣fully,
as to give play to the imagination.
She prepares herself for managing a fa∣mily
of her own, by managing that of
her father. Cookery is familiar to her,
with the price and quality of provisions;
and she is a ready accountant. Her chief
view however is to serve her mother and
lighten her cares. She holds cleanness
and neatness to be indispensable in a wo∣man;
and that a slattern is disgusting,
especially if beautiful.</P>
<P>THE attention given to externals, does
not make her overlook her more material
duties. Sophia's understanding is solid,
without being profound. Her sensibility
is too great for a perfect equality of tem∣per;
but her sweetness render that ine∣quality
harmless. A harsh word does
<PB N="156" REF="164"/>
not make her angry; but her heart
swells, and she retires to disburden it by
weeping. Recalled by her father or mo∣ther,
she comes at the instant, wipeing
her eyes and appearing chearful. She suf∣fers
with patience any wrong done her;
but is impatient to repair any wrong she
has done, and does it so cordially as to
make it appear meritorious. If she hap∣pen
to disoblige a companion, her joy
and her caresses, when restored to favour,
show the burden that lay upon her good
heart.</P>
<P>THE love of virtue is Sophia's ruling
passion. She loves it, because no other
thing is so lovely: she loves it, because
it is the glory of the female sex: she loves
it as the only road to happiness, misery
being the sure attendant of a woman
without virute; she loves it, as dear to
her respectable father and tender mother.
These sentiments inspire her with a de∣gree
<PB N="157" REF="165"/>
of enthusiasm, that elevates her soul
and subdues every irregular appetite.</P>
<P>OF the absent she never talks but with
circumspection, her female acquaintance
especially. She has remarked, that what
renders women prone to detraction, is
talking of their own sex; and that they
are more equitable with respect to ours.
Sophia therefore never talks of women,
but to express the good she knows of
them: of others she says nothing.</P>
<P>WITHOUT much knowledge of the
world, she is attentive, obliging and
graceful in all she does. A good dispo∣sition
does more for her, than much art
does for others. She possesses a degree
of politeness, which, void of ceremony,
proceeds from a desire to please, and
which consequently never fails to please.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="166"/>
THE next portrait is of a fine woman
drawn by the celebrated Earl of Chester∣field.</P>
<P>LET Flavia be their model, who, though
she could support any character, assumes
none; is never missed by fancy or vanity,
but guided singly by reason. Whatever
she says or does, is the manifest result of
a happy nature, and a good understand∣ing;
though she knows whatever women
ought, and it may be more than they
are required to know. She conceals the
superiority she has, with as much care as
others take to display the superiority they
have not: she conforms herself to the
turn of the company she is in, but in a
way of rather avoiding to be distanced,
than desiring to take the lead. Are they
merry, she is chearful; are they grave,
she is serious; are they absurd, she is
silent. Though she thinks and speaks
as a man would do, she effeminates, if I
<PB N="159" REF="167"/>
may use the expression, whatever she says,
and adds all the graces of her own sex to
the strength of ours. She is well bred
without the troublesome ceremonies and
frivolous forms of those who only affect
to be so. As her good breeding proceeds
jointly from good nature and good sense,
the former inclines her to oblige, and the
latter shows her the easiest and best way
of doing it. Women's beauty like men's
wit, is generally fatal to the owners, un∣less
directed by a judgment that seldom
accompanies a great degree of either.
Her beauty seems but a proper and de∣cent
lodging for such a mind. She knows
the true value of it; and far from think∣ing
that it authorises impertinence and
coquetry, it redoubles her care to avoid
those errors that are its usual attendants.
Thus, she not only unites in herself all
the advantages of body and mind, but
even reconciles contradictions in others;
for she is loved and esteemed, though en∣vied
by all.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="168"/>
I SHALL add but one character more,
which is that of the Duchess of Guise
penned by the Duc de Sully, a most com∣plete
female character in my opinion.</P>
<P>IN any age that has not lost every di∣stinction
between virtue and vice, the
Duchess of Guise would universally have
been held the chief of her sex, for the
qualities of her heart and mind. Every
branch of her conduct was regulated by
a native rectitude of soul: she had not
even the idea of evil, either in advising
or acting. Her disposition was at the
same time so sweet, as never to feel the
slightest emotion of hatred, malignity,
envy, nor even ill humour. No other wo∣man
ever possessed so many graces of con∣versation;
nor, to a wit so subtile and re∣fined,
added a more perfect simplicity of
manners. The pleasing as well as more
elevated qualities, were so happily blend∣ed
in her composition, that she was at
once tender and lively, tranquil and gay.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">EDUCATION with respect to RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>THE most delicate branch of educa∣tion,
is that which concerns reli∣gion.
All human beings have an innate
sense of right and wrong, by means of
which children are susceptible of moral
instruction. They listen to an interest∣ing
story, take an affection to those who
behave well, and an aversion to those
who behave ill. Such exercise, which
moulds the heart to virtue, has one pecu∣liar
advantage, that it is highly agree∣able:
children never tire of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following little story is so sweet and inte∣resting, that I am fond of any pretext to introduce it; and my pretext is, that it is an additional proof of the sense of right and wrong being innate; though that fact is so firmly established in the opinion of every rational person, as to render any new evidence very little necessary. A female child was born deaf and dumb. At four years of age, when her parents were clearly sensible of her defect, they sent her to a boarding school at Bristol; and left her there for years, without providing either for board or cloaths. The father, who died a few years ago, left his wife and son in good circumstances, with L. 1000 to each of his younger children, the same sum to his dumb daughter in case she should come to the use of speech; otherways an annuity only of L. 30 to com∣mence when she should be of age. Since the fa∣ther's death, she was visited by her brothers and sisters, but without any mark of affection, not a single word about the board either from mother or children. So much upon the dark side of the pro∣spect. Now to the bright side. Sophia, which is the young woman's name, is of so mild and amiable a disposition, that the boarding mistresses have adopt∣ed her for their daughter. Their claim is consider∣able for board, cloaths, and education; but they forbear suing for it, lest the young woman should be taken from them. In needle-work, drawing, dancing, and mimicry, she excels. But what only is to the present point, her mistresses vouch upon every occasion, that her ideas of justice and moral rectitude are extremely correct, and that her prac∣tice is entirely conformable to them. Ideas of right and wrong may be improved by education; but without a foundation in nature, an attempt to incul∣cate them would be no less unsuccessful, than an at∣tempt to give an idea of colour to one born blind.</NOTE>. Children
<PB N="162" REF="170"/>
are equally susceptible of instruction with
regard to natural religion. The being
<PB N="163" REF="171"/>
of a God and the worship due to him,
being engraved on the mind, make a
branch of our nature. As nature thus
takes the lead, it is the duty of parents
to second nature. They ought to incul∣cate
into their children, that God is their
friend and heavenly Father; and that
they ought to perform his will, which is
to do all the good they can. Convince
them that God is always present, and
that not a thought can be concealed from
him. Accompany every one of your les∣sons
with describing the Deity as bene∣volent
and humane, wishing the good of
his creatures, and rewarding the virtuous,
if not in this life, assuredly in a life to
come<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sketches of the History of Man. Second Edit. vol. 4. page 359.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As this is a capital branch of educa∣tion,
I think the most capital, it merits
great attention. It is easy to fortify in
<PB N="164" REF="172"/>
children the belief of a Deity, because his
existence is engraved on the human heart;
but it is far from being easy to fortify
belief, so as to become a ruling principle
of action. And yet this is indispensable;
for belief without producing that effect,
is of little significancy in any case; and
least of all with respect to the duties of
religion, which are the great and ulti∣mate
end of instruction. In order that
a firm belief of the Deity may warm
the mind to persevere in what is right,
the following hints may be of use to pa∣rents
and tutors. Take early proper op∣portunities
of talking pleasantly to your
children of their heavenly Father, who
loves them, and who, though unseen, is
always doing them good; that he created
the sun to warm them, and made the
earth to produce every thing necessary
for their nourishment and for their
cloathing. In fine weather, lead them
to the fields, and point out to them the
<PB N="165" REF="173"/>
various beauties of nature. “How beau∣tiful
that smooth plain intersected with
a stream perpetually flowing; how com∣fortable
to the eye its verdure, and
how beneficial by giving food to many
innocent and useful animals! Behold
that gay parterre, variegated with a
thousand sweet colours. See that noble
oak spreading its branches all around,
affording a shade in summer, and shel∣ter
in winter. Listen to the birds which
chear us with their music, and are
busily employed in bringing forth their
young.” Impress it upon the minds
of your children, that all these things
are contrived by our heavenly Father to
make us happy; and that it ought to be
our chief delight to testify upon all oc∣casions
our gratitude to him.</P>
<P>WHEN a child has behaved well, fail
not to let it know, that it has given plea∣sure
to its heavenly Father, and that he
<PB N="166" REF="174"/>
will reward it when he sees proper. In
sickness, exhort it to suffer patiently; be∣cause
it is in the hands of God, who will
do what is best for it. If this chearful
doctrine be carefully instilled into the
hearts of children, they will acquire a
habit of considering the Deity in the a∣miable
light of a friend and benefactor,
who never will forsake them.</P>
<P>BUT though it is necessary to describe
the Deity, not only as a friend to the
good, but as an enemy to the wicked;
be in no hurry with the latter, nor let it
be mentioned till the benevolence of the
Deity be deeply rooted in the mind of
your children. When they are duly pre∣pared,
describe him as loath to punish,
ready to forgive those who repent, an
enemy to hardened sinners only; that he
is angry indeed at children who misbe∣have,
but that so are their parents; that
good children are not afraid of their pa∣rents;
<PB N="167" REF="175"/>
and as little reason have they to
be afraid of their heavenly Parent.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS education thus carried on,
instead of inspiring gloominess and de∣spondence,
will contribute more than any
other means to serenity of mind and chear∣fulness
of temper. I zealously recommend
this sort of discipline to parents, knowing
that it is not sufficiently attended to.
Surely, any frightful notion of the Deity,
must have a dismal effect on a tender
mind, susceptible of every impression,
that of fear above all. Man formerly
was thought to be of a nature so perverse,
as to be governed by fear only, never by
affection; and our Maker accordingly
was represented as severe and unfor∣giving.
The dread thus inspired into
young persons, produces naturally abject
superstition in a weak mind; and in the
bold and thoughtless, a total neglect of
religion. As the latter character is the
<PB N="168" REF="176"/>
more common, it cannot be surprising to
find among us such neglect of religion.</P>
<P>STORIES composed in order to fortify
rational notions of the Deity, would have
a good effect on children of nine or ten;
the history, for example, of a young wo∣man
who never did a thing of moment,
without first considering whether it would
be agreeable to her Maker; who by
that means led a chearful and innocent
life, and was beloved by all; or the hi∣story
of a young man, who, seduced by
a train of temptations, lost sight of his
Maker, and plunged headlong into vice.
After a debauch, he dreamed that God,
appearing with an angry countenance,
threatned a severe punishment. He start∣ed
from sleep in extreme agony: his
wicked courses stared him in the face:
he prayed ardently for pardon, and made
a vow never again to lose sight of his
Maker. The remainder of his life was
<PB N="169" REF="177"/>
no less exemplary for goodness, than the
former part for vice. The lively impres∣sion
of God's presence and superintend∣ence,
promoted by such histories, will
guard against vice more effectually, than
the actual presence of the most awful per∣son
on earth. A man so educated will
as little think of hiding his intentions
from his Maker, as of hiding them from
himself.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING how liable children are
to the absurd impressions of ghosts and
apparitions, can it be thought that they
will be less open to the impression of the
Deity, which has a solid foundation in
nature? Examples are many of a con∣nection
so intimate between two friends,
as that the image of the predeceased was
always present to the survivor, rejoicing
with him in prosperity, and comforting
him in adversity. Surely, we are suscep∣tible
of a connection with our Maker,
<PB N="170" REF="178"/>
equally intimate. I have often experi∣enced
the force of early impressions in
trivial matters, far less apt than the pre∣sence
of the Deity to occupy the mind.
In the morning between sleeping and
waking, I frequently imagine myself to
be in the bed-chamber I occupied during
childhood, the door here, the window
there, very different from the form of
my present bed-chamber: nor am I un∣deceived,
till perfectly awake. From the
window of my study looking to the fields
in a reverie, the sight of a tree, resem∣bling
one in my original habitation, has
frequently made me think myself to be
there; so as even to contradict my eye∣sight,
by substituting, instead of the pre∣sent
prospect, the one I had been accus∣tomed
to during my tender years. As
more than half a century has elapsed
since my infancy, these facts show clear∣ly,
that early impressions never are obli∣terated.
It is true, that I have nothing
<PB N="171" REF="179"/>
for these facts but my own evidence;
but, as nature is the same in all, I take
it for granted that similar instances have
occurred to many.</P>
<P>YOUNG persons duly initiated in the
comforts of religion, hold their Maker to be
their firmest friend and their most power∣ful
protector. They retire to private de∣votion,
with the alacrity of one who goes
to visit a bosom friend; and the hours
that pass in that exercise, are remember∣ed
with entire satisfaction. In every dif∣ficulty
they apply to their Maker: they
pray to him in affliction; and in prospe∣rity
they pour out their grateful heart to
him. Parents! attend above all other
concerns to the education of your chil∣dren:
riches and honours are as nothing
in comparison. It is in your power to
stamp on their ductile mind, so deep an
impression of a benevolent Deity, as to
become their ruling principle of action.
<PB N="172" REF="180"/>
What praise do you not merit, if success∣ful:
what reproach, if negligent? I have
a firm conviction, that if a due impres∣sion
of the Deity be not sufficient to stem
the tide of corruption in an opulent and
luxurious nation, it is vain to attempt a
remedy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I can have no doubt but that the following let∣ter upon this subject, will be as agreeable to the public, as it was to me.</P>
<P>“I am very glad to hear, that you again have taken up your pen for the public service; espe∣cially as you begin at that season on which the whole harvest of life depends. We, who are farmers, know the ground must be tilled, cleaned, and good seed carefully sown, if we mean to reap a rich crop. I am proud to find, I have always followed your plan of religion, with the infants that have been under my care. Whenever they have admired the sun's refulgent beams, the love∣ly orb of the moon, or any of the striking beau∣ties of nature, I have endeavoured to raise their thoughts to the great Creator, and to set before them his Majesty, without the terrors that might drive them from the contemplation. In their seasons of recreation and innocent delights, I have represented him as the indulgent parent, from whose bounty they enjoyed such blessings, and who at all times can bestow every good, and guard from pain and evil. The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom; but the love of God is the parent of devotion. When, as men, they go forth into the world, and temptations throng a∣round them, they ought then to consider God in the awful character of a legislator, carefully to obey his laws, and to dread the displeasure that must be the consequence of disobedience to laws on which the general welfare depends; no less in fact, though not so apparently, than on the re∣gular course of the tides, or succession of the sea∣sons. Nor will this any way impair the early principle of the love of God; for the more bene∣volent the lawgiver is, the more strictly will be require obedience to laws upon which our happi∣ness depends.”.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="181"/>
WHEN your children, by regular train∣ing,
come to have a warm sense of devo∣tion,
then is the time for entering them
into the exercise of prayer. Teach them
to pray for their parents, for their rela∣tions,
and above all that God will pre∣serve
them from doing ill. Say your
prayers before them shortly and pathe∣tically:
they will imitate you without
compulsion. But prescribe not at first
regular hours; which to very young
<PB N="174" REF="182"/>
creatures prove irksome and fatiguing.
Encourage them however to acquaint
you when they have performed that du∣ty.
After being thus fairly initiated in
an agreeable practice, it will not be diffi∣cult
to introduce gradually more regula∣rity.
Let them know that regularity will
prevent neglect and remissness, which
cannot fail to be a burden on their spi∣rits;
that the morning and the evening
are the most proper times; the former to
thank their Maker for the light of a new
day, and to beseech him not to leave
them to themselves; the latter to attri∣bute
it to him if they have behaved well,
and to beg pardon if they have done any
thing amiss.</P>
<P>BUT I rest here, purposing at the end
of this section to present the reader
with an illustration of this subject by
another hand. I reckon upon suffering
by the comparison; but I renounce sel∣fish
<PB N="175" REF="183"/>
views for the sake of my fellow citi∣zens.</P>
<P>WHAT remains with respect to religi∣ous
education, is to add a few hints upon
revealed religion. This may be thought
an extreme delicate point; because in en∣deavouring
to instruct young people in
the revelation that ought to be embraced,
there may be danger of leading them
astray. As revealed religion is not stamp∣ed
on the heart, but requires profound
reasoning and the knowledge of many
obscure facts, we are apt to conclude
that it ought to be delayed till the fa∣culty
of reason be ripe; which resolves
in leaving every person to judge for them∣selves.
But this opinion ought not to be
adopted; for as the generality of men are
incapable to judge of a matter so intri∣cate,
they must be led. Now, I say, that
it is better for them to be led in their
younger years by a kindly parent or tutor,
<PB N="176" REF="184"/>
than to be left to form an opinion after∣ward
as chance shall direct. For this rea∣son,
I am clear that children be educated
in the religion established or tolerated by
law. Nor ought this to be considered as
a rash concession; for sure I am, that
ninety-nine of a hundred have no better
foundation to build their faith upon.
It may be demanded then, where lies
the merit of a Christian above a Maho∣metan
or a Pagan? I admit, that it can∣not
lye in following blindly the profession
of one's ancestors. But as the Christian re∣velation
is the most perfect of all, and the
purest in its doctrines, it is highly meri∣torious
in a Turk or a Pagan, who seeks
truth with a sincere heart, to become a
true Christian. At the same time, I am
far from thinking, that Christianity is
the only road to heaven. All who have
a good heart with a clear conscience, will
meet with the same reward. It is not
material in the sight of the Almighty,
<PB N="177" REF="185"/>
whether the religion they have been
taught is or is not orthodox, provided
they be sincere. People follow naturally
and innocently the faith of their parents;
and the generality have no other means
for embracing a revelation, real or pre∣tended.
How few are there who can de∣pend
on their own judgment, in making
a choice! Are people to be condemned
for judging wrong, who cannot judge at
all? To me therefore it appears evident∣ly
the will of God, that sincerity should
be the only title to his favour, leaving
men to their own belief.</P>
<P>IT is at the same time extremely con∣venient,
that people should be of the re∣ligion
of their country. Therefore, what∣ever
unlucky doubts or scruples may
haunt a man with respect to that reli∣gion,
he ought to conceal them from his
children. In a Christian country, let him
employ all honest means to breed his
<PB N="178" REF="186"/>
children sincere Christians. To that end,
among other particulars more material,
a set of prints representing the history of
the Old and New Testament, will contri∣bute
greatly. Young creatures delight
in pictures; and by that means, the ma∣terial
facts relative to Christianity may be
deeply stamped on their minds, leaving
when they grow up little inclination to
doubt of their reality.</P>
<P>HERE indeed I zealously exhort pa∣rents
and teachers to guard against bi∣gotry
and superstition, which, if early
sown in young minds, are not easily
rooted out. Teach your children to pre∣fer
their own religion; but inculcate
at the same time that the virtuous are
acceptable to God, however erroneous in
point of belief. Press it home on them,
that there is nothing in nature to hinder
different sects of Christians from living
amicably together, more than different
<PB N="179" REF="187"/>
of philosophers, or of men who work
in different arts: especially as the ar∣ticles
of faith that distinguish these sects
are purely speculative: they have no re∣lation
to morals, nor any influence on
our conduct. Yet from these distinctions
have proceeded rancour and animosity,
as if our most important concerns had
been at stake. In a different view, the ab∣surdity
appears still more glaring. These
articles, the greater part at least, relate to
subjects beyond the reach of human un∣derstanding;
so that no man can say
whether they are true or false. The Al∣mighty
by his works of creation has
made his wisdom and benevolence mani∣fest:
but he has not found it necessary
to explain to his creatures the manner of
his existence; and in all appearance the
manner of his existence is beyond the
reach of our conceptions. Yet Athana∣sius,
that great champion for blind cre∣dulity,
and who for that reason has been
<PB N="180" REF="188"/>
dubbed a saint, handles the subject with
as great assurance of being in the right,
as if it had been revealed to him from
heaven. Certain it is, that the propo∣sitions
laid down in his creed, are far be∣yond
the reach of human knowledge. I
forbear to mention, that the greater part
of them, if they have any distinct mean∣ing,
contradict common sense. And yet,
good God! what oceans of blood have
been shed by the inveteracy of the ortho∣dox
against the Arians, occasioned chiefly
by that very creed; men massacring one
another without remorse, and even with∣out
pity—more cruel far than beasts of
prey, who never kill but for food. Per∣secution
for the sake of religion, would
have been entirely prevented by whole∣some
education, instilling into the minds
of young people, that difference in opi∣nion
is no just cause of discord; and
that different sects may live amicably to∣gether.
In a word, neglect no opportu∣nity
<PB N="181" REF="189"/>
to impress on the mind of your pu∣pils,
that religion is given for our good;
and that no religion can be true that
tends to disturb the peace of society.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPENDIX TO SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1">
<HEAD>ART. I.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the sense of Deity is innate
has been shewn elsewhere. The
present enquiry is how to unfold it.</P>
<P>THE perception of our own existence is
quickly followed by that of the existence
of God; or rather, they grow up toge∣ther.
The pleasures of novelty and beauty
and grandeur are early felt; it seems pos∣sible
to excite, even in the minds of chil∣dren,
a reflection on the author of those
pleasures. Children are indebted to their
parents for food and clothes and other
<PB N="182" REF="190"/>
comforts, and they feel gratitude and at∣tachment.
But who makes the sun to
rise, and the flowers to grow, and fruit to
ripen? They are the questions of children,
the seed of an answer is in their own mind,
it only needs to be unfolded. By begin∣ning
here, the first idea of God is that of
a benevolent Being, and the first devout
sentiments are those of gratitude and ad∣miration.</P>
<P>GLOOMY views of the Supreme Being,
and of the service which he requires, have
the worst effect on the minds of youth.
The celebrated Boyle, when a young man,
visited the scenes of St Bruno's solitude.
The stories and pictures of that Saint o∣verwhelmed
him with melancholy. The
misery of his creatures seemed to be the
sacrifice which God required. Accord∣ing
to his own account, “nothing but
the forbiddenness of self-dispatch pre∣vented
his acting it.”</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="191"/>
IT is not meet to burden young minds
with religious instruction. If it be con∣veyed
in the form of a task, it will soon
grow irksome. If it consist in definitions
of God and explanations, it will probably
amount to the knowledge of words. If
abstruse and inadequate reasonings be
used, they will choke the good seed which
you mean to cherish.</P>
<P>IN unfolding a truth which affects the
imagination and the heart, proper seasons
must be chosen. When the sun rises
from the sea, and dispels the clouds, and
gilds the mountains, while birds sing and
the air is fragrant; you may aid your
pupil's contemplation on that power
which daily renews our joy. In the si∣lence
and solemnity of a starry night, his
thoughts ascend to the Creator. While
it thunders, he readily perceives that re∣verence
is due to the Almighty.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="192"/>
THERE are seasons when the doctrine
of providence, and of immortality, a
branch of that doctrine, may be deeply
impressed. Recoveries and escapes and
deliverances are often experienced in
youth; when your pupil has experienced
any of these, with the slightest aid he
will recognise a providence. Your disease
was extreme, the physician gave no hope,
your companion was carried to the grave.
What power restored you to your sorrow∣ing
friends? what gratitude is due to that
power? what love to those friends who
took so deep an interest in your afflic∣tion?
You have escaped an accident which
the next moment had proved fatal. Who
preserved your life? for what end was it
preserved?</P>
<P>Marcus Antoninus was thankful to pro∣vidence
that his mother recovered from a
sickness which had like to have cut her off
<PB N="185" REF="193"/>
in her youth. Such an interposition duly
weighed, leaves a more powerful and
permanent impression than profound
reasoning, and awakens a livelier grati∣tude.
Those who have cultivated piety,
and like Antoninus recorded its progress,
have all been touched with early interpo∣sitions
of providence, and treasured them
up as memorials of Divine Goodness and
grounds of hope.</P>
<P>YOUTH seldom passes without a time
to weep. The death-bed of a parent or
of a young friend, melts the heart. Con∣cern
and attachment grow as the hour
approaches. Death leaves him inconso∣lable.
Immortality is the source of con∣solation,
and now is the time to open it.
It accords with lively sorrow, which clings
to a departed friend, and dwells on the
thought of an everlasting union. Divine
Goodness, which the shadow of death
had veiled, shines forth again. Were
<PB N="186" REF="194"/>
dying parents, like the late Lady Cath∣cart,
to awaken a sense of God and im∣mortality
in the minds of children, it
would make an indelible impression.</P>
<P>THE doctrines of providence and a
future state, interest all mankind. Sy∣stems
of education which overlook them
are very deficient. The reasonings of
Theologians and Sceptics, may have gi∣ven
to an important science a discoura∣ging
aspect. With them it may still be
left to dispute with Clarke and Dodwell,
and to trace the intricacies of Spinoza;
but in a system of education suited to
man, his relation to God, with the senti∣ments
and duties founded on that relati∣on,
is an essential branch. The steps by
which your pupil advances in knowledge,
all lead to the Creator. By giving them
this direction, improvement and delight
will mingle.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2">
<PB N="187" REF="195"/>
<HEAD>ART. II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is an early tendency to con∣template
the works of nature, and
to enquire. If the inclination and ca∣pacity
of youth were consulted, natural
history would be the first branch of edu∣cation.
On this subject, the pupil is in∣troduced
with ease and pleasure to indu∣stry
and thought. Curiosity is gratified
and excited by turns. A way of know∣ledge
is opened in the desert, and a path
in the deep waters. Final causes are per∣ceived,
and views of wisdom open. He
is introduced to communion with God.</P>
<P>MUCH depends on the method in
which natural history is taught. The
sophistry of materialism darkens the un∣derstanding,
and chills the heart, and
damps the ardour of pursuit. The sense
of Deity, which the mere detail of facts
<PB N="188" REF="196"/>
would cherish, is blasted by cold and
captious reasoning; the result is doubt
and melancholy, perhaps indolence and
sensuality. But when marks of wise and
beneficent design are pointed out, the de∣tail
of facts becomes more interesting.
Reason is exercised. Admiration is felt.
The heart warms at every new prospect
of benevolence. Fresh ardour kindles in
a pursuit by which the highest feelings
of the mind are gratified.</P>
<P>IF the inclination and capacity of the
pupil be still consulted, experimental phi∣losophy
is the next step. It contributes
to the arts of life, and it may likewise
contribute to the knowledge of God. “It
gives a relish, as Mr Boyle observed
and felt, for abstract truths which do
not gratify ambition, sensuality or low
interests.” The laws of nature suppose
a Lawgiver. The properties of body,
subjected to the power and ingenuity and
<PB N="189" REF="197"/>
use of man, lead to the Author of these
properties and of this subjection. The
doctrine of cause and effect is explained.
The metaphysical dust is easily wiped off.
With intuitive conviction, the mind rests
in a first cause, independent and self-ex∣istent.
It rests in silent awe. The expla∣nations
of schoolmen are blasphemy.</P>
<P>THE sciences acquire new importance
and dignity, and reflect new honour on
their professors, as they dispel supersti∣tion
and establish faith in the perfections
and providence of God. “Our views of
nature,” says M'Laurin, an eminent
and enlightened teacher, “however im∣perfect,
serve to represent to us in the
most sensible manner, that mighty
power which prevails throughout, act∣ing
with a force and efficacy that ap∣pears
to suffer no diminution from the
greatest distances of space or intervals
of time; and that wisdom which we
<PB N="190" REF="198"/>
see equally displayed in the exquisite
structure and just motions of the great∣est
and subtilest parts. These, with
perfect goodness by which they are
evidently directed, constitute the su∣preme
object of the speculations of a
philosopher, who, while he contem∣plates
and admires so excellent a system,
cannot but be himself excited and ani∣mated
to correspond with the general
harmony of nature.” Sir Isaac New∣ton
concludes his principal works with
thoughts of God, sublime in proportion
to the objects which filled his mind, and
the clearness with which he viewed them.
In a late Essay on Gravitation, an idea is
presented of some centre of the universe
unspeakably remote, round which the
sun and stars may gravitate. After sup∣porting
the hypothesis by analogy, and
by the change of place actually observed
in many stars, it thus concludes, “What
an astonishing thing is this when con∣sidered
<PB N="191" REF="199"/>
in its proper and full extent!
It seems the voice of nature reaching
from the uttermost heavens, inviting
us to enlarge and elevate our views.”</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3">
<HEAD>ART. III.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the knowledge of external
things, the mind is conducted to
the knowledge of itself: a brighter dis∣play
of the Deity opens. Human wis∣dom
appears in mechanical arts, but still
more in the arts of government. The
laws of motion in matter, and of instinct
in brutes are suited to their subjects; but
the laws which regulate a mind capable
of thinking and chusing, lead to more
profound researches. The labour is dif∣ficult,
but the recompense is great. In
tracing these laws we discover the end of
our creation, and the means of attaining
it. We discover hidden treasures of Di∣vine
<PB N="192" REF="200"/>
Wisdom, in a subject of higher dig∣nity
and more exquisite workmanship,
than the material world. We feel a prin∣ciple
of justice and kind affection, which
aid our conceptions of the Divine Justice
and Benevolence. Some of the passions
find an object in God; and moral excel∣lence
attracts the heart.</P>
<P>THE principles of taste are the easiest
and most pleasant branch of human na∣ture;
and with them, perhaps, it is fittest
to begin. The pleasures of imagination
are relished in youth: as their sources
are traced with the means of purifying
them, they acquire a new relish. Means
fitted to their ends in so complicated a
machine as man, display profound wis∣dom:
when these ends are so many delici∣ous
pleasures, they renew the impression
of Divine Benevolence. The benevolence
of God is the foundation of piety, and
it cannot be laid too deep. While the
<PB N="193" REF="201"/>
pleasures of imagination are enjoyed,
gratitude may at times be roused. Many
of these pleasures accord with devotion,
and rise in the exercise of it to their
highest note. Great and awful and im∣measurable
objects are sublime; as they
raise the thoughts to God, the mind
swells with still more exalted pleasure.
The enthusiasm of poetry is felt, and the
fire of devotion burns. Hymns to the
Creator were early expressions of piety
among men, and piety may still be che∣rished
in early years by songs of praise.</P>
<P>LAWS which regulate conduct, are
more important than those by which
pleasure is dispensed.</P>
<P>KIND affections spring up in youth;
it is the season for rearing the amiable
virtues. Pleasure accompanies every act
of goodness; the gratitude which it ex∣cites,
and the praise which it attracts,
<PB N="194" REF="202"/>
heighten that pleasure; devotion purifies
and exalts it. Benevolence, which is a∣nimated
by views of Divine Benevolence,
and works together with God, is pure
and permanent; it is proof against in∣gratitudè
and unmerited reproach.</P>
<P>WHILE justice is explained, the obliga∣tion
is felt, and the sanctions which en∣force
it. Human laws are contemplated
as a part of God's administration, found∣ed
on the sense of justice which he has
given, inflicting punishments which that
sense approves, and establishing order in
society. So far the prospect is bright.
But your pupil must be instructed in the
disorder which actually prevails, the im∣perfection
of human laws, the partiality
and deceivableness of judges, the tri∣umphs
of iniquity. A cloud gathers on
the prospect. Indignation rises at the
view of oppression, and sympathy with
the oppressed, and an appeal to that Being
<PB N="195" REF="203"/>
who made man upright. Immortality,
opened through the vale of death, opens
again through the vale of iniquity.</P>
<P>IF difficulties occur in comparing the
justice of God with his benevolence, the
following hints by Muralt are submit∣ted.</P>
<P>“THE faculties with which man is
endowed, tend, when properly exer∣cised,
to the perfection of his nature.
When they are turned from their true
destination, disorder ensues, great in
proportion to the excellence of the fa∣culties
perverted. The order which
subsists among the members of the
body, is essential not only to its per∣fection,
but to its happiness. Disor∣der
in any member of the body, is no∣tified
by pain; disorder in the facul∣ties
of the mind, is in like manner no∣tified
by pain of mind. Pain is the
<PB N="196" REF="204"/>
consequence of disorder, the necessary
unavoidable consequence; were it
otherways, both body and mind would
go to ruin. Detach the idea of seve∣rity
from the justice of God: were
creatures free from disorder, that se∣verity
would not exist. The essential
justice of God, is his approbation of
that order which renders intelligent
creatures happy; and of consequence,
a disapprobation of the disorder which
renders them miserable. The seeming
severity of his justice, is a constant and
pressing call to return to happiness, and
to that order with which it is necessa∣rily
connected. The justice, which
seems severe in its effects, is, in its prin∣ciple,
goodness directed by wisdom.
The principle by which he consents to
the pain of his creatures, is the same
by which he wills them to be happy.”</P>
<P>REASON is of late growth: much must
be done in the way of discipline before
<PB N="197" REF="205"/>
it can be applied: that discipline, how∣ever,
should be adapted to reason, which
is hereafter to review it. Beware of con∣veying
to your pupil religious principles
that will not stand the test of enquiry;
when he comes to winnow them, the
wheat may fly off with the chaff. In a
dark age, prejudices friendly to virtue
may operate through life; but when light
rushes in, the foundation of piety and
virtue may be shaken. Erasmus observed,
that all the reformers he was acquainted
with, became worse men than they were
before. The first reformers, in renoun∣cing
vernerable prejudices with which
the most important truths were mingled,
underwent a severe trial; nor is it much
to be wondered at, if in breaking the
bands of superstition, the bands of love
were loosed. The children of protestants
acknowledged no authority but scripture,
and they escaped the trial of their fa∣thers.
In the progress of enquiry, scrip∣ture
<PB N="198" REF="206"/>
came to be judged by reason, the
moral sense, and the sense of Deity. In
this state of things, it seems prudent
to begin with incontrovertible essential
truths, and to prepare and cultivate rea∣son
for judging of the rest.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4">
<HEAD>ART. IV.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the sense of Deity is un∣folded
and reason cultivated, it
is time to judge of revelation. Christia∣nity
claims attention on several accounts:
it is the religion of our fathers: it has a
shew of evidence: if it be true, it is a
truth of high concern.</P>
<P>MANY of the objections to Christianity
are owing to misrepresentations of it. Let
the New Testament be consulted. Does it
ascribe to God a character worthy the
Creator of the universe and the Father of
<PB N="199" REF="207"/>
men? Does it clear and extend the view
of his wisdom and benevolence? Does it
make the way to communion with him
more plain and pleasant?</P>
<P>Is the appointment of a Mediator ana∣logous
to the ways of Providence, ex∣pressive
of Divine Condescension, and
suited to human nature? Is it consoling
to the heart under a sense of guilt, to be
assured of pardon? Does moral excel∣lence
made perfect by suffering, seem to
be a sacrifice which God will accept? Is
it natural to the mind of man, to feel ad∣miration
and love at the view of moral
excellence, and yield to its transforming
influence?</P>
<P>TAKE a view of man in his low estate.
Think if it be godlike to send glad ti∣dings
to the poor, if it be godlike to con∣sole
the miserable, and if the sympathy
of an affectionate and powerful friend be
<PB N="200" REF="208"/>
a strong consolation? Man is mortal,
and he passed before us through death,
not with an awful insensibility which
leaves the feeling heart behind.</P>
<P>DOES the doctrine of a resurrection fall
in with our predilection for these bodies,
and open as it were to the eye of sense
the prospect of immortality? And does
the doctrine of judgment accord with
the natural feeling that we are account∣able?</P>
<P>DO the sufferings of Christ, and the
glory which followed, illustrate and rati∣fy
his important doctrine of a state of
trial, preparatory to a state of retribution?</P>
<P>JUDGE Christianity by its effects. Does
it kindle love to God and man, and esta∣blish
the authority of conscience, and re∣concile
you to your lot?</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="209"/>
IF your child be satisfied that Christ is
a teacher sent from God, and is willing
to be his disciple, it is meet to confess
him before men. The celebration of his
death is a proper testimony of regard.
Such a Benefactor deserves to be had in
everlasting remembrance.</P>
<P>THE hearts of the young, when first
introduced to communion with the faith∣ful,
are accessible and soft. Parents
might avail themselves of this season to
recal their early dedication to God, to ex∣plain
the wisdom and love which inspi∣red
the discipline through which they
have been made to pass, to foretel its in∣fluence
on their future conduct, to anti∣cipate
the time when that conduct shall
be judged, and to devolve the care of it
on themselves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5">
<PB N="202" REF="210"/>
<HEAD>ART. V.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE other passions are spring∣ing
up, and attended to with a
wise and watchful eye, the devout pas∣sions
claim a share in that attention.</P>
<P>THE works of God inspire humility.
When we look up to the heavenly bodies,
and meditate the extent and the number
and the glory of them; we return to
ourselves with lowly thoughts. “Lord
what is man that thou art mindful of
him?”</P>
<P>PERFECT innocence is not the portion
of mortality. Even in worthy pursuits
the judgment may err, and in the exer∣cise
of right affections the heart may
wander. In youth a passion may break
its bounds, and for a moment lay waste
the soul. Remorse is felt. Under its
severe and awful pressure, the soul re∣turns
<PB N="203" REF="211"/>
to God, and melts in penitential
sorrow. The peace which begins to
dawn, is a token of the Divine compas∣sion.
The fruits of this exercise are a
lively sense of the danger of guilt, the
humbleness of mind which becomes an
imperfect creature, and sympathy with
those who are in the same imperfect
state. The devout act passes in retire∣ment
betwixt the soul and God; but the
fruits of it you may aid your young
friend to cultivate.</P>
<P>LOVE to God is excited and cherished
by reflecting on his favours, and on the
goodness from whence they flow. Affec∣tion
to a creature must be limited, but
unmixed and unbounded goodness is the
object of unbounded affection. The heart
does not rest in any human enjoyment,
but it rests in God; the object is ade∣quate
and the enjoyment complete. Di∣vine
love attracts the ardour and sensi∣bility
<PB N="204" REF="212"/>
of youth, and averts debasing pas∣sions.</P>
<P>FIRST feelings are critical; by them
the character is often decided. Suppose
them sensual; how deep they sink! how
often renewed by a polluted imagination,
and how fondly cherished! They be∣come
the hidden treasure of the heart,
to which it retires for a dark selfish eva∣nescent
joy: the presence of the virtuous
cannot always suppress them, nor the gate
of the sanctuary shut them out. The path
of honour is for ever abandoned. Early
impressions of piety in like manner take
possession of the heart. The first feelings
of devotion are remembered with delight.
God is sought and he is found in the out∣goings
of the morning, in delightful and
in awful scenes, in the peace and in the
tumults of nations, in the inmost reces∣ses
of the soul. When the mind is un∣occupied,
it is drawn by love to the Fa∣ther
<PB N="205" REF="213"/>
of mercies; when wonted sleep de∣parts,
it is cheared by the returning sense
of his presence. Love to God brightens
the sunshine of prosperity, and perfumes
with sweet incense the sacrifices which
are made to virtue. Every thing praise∣worthy
is to be expected from the youth
who loves his Creator and acts as under
his eye.</P>
<P>DIVINE love has at times appeared in
a less inviting form. Unfeeling men, like
Dr Clarke, alarmed at the effects of en∣thusiasm,
have denied the existence of any
affection or passion of which God is the
object. Dr Butler, with a deeper insight
into human nature, in his sermon on the
love of God, has established the doctrine
on its true foundation. The success of
enthusiasts in ages of ignorance, and a∣mong
the ignorant of the present age,
denotes a principle in the human mind
which corresponds to their instructions.
<PB N="206" REF="214"/>
It is a sacred principle, and deserves to
be called forth and cherished by the voice
of wisdom.</P>
<P>MADAME Guyon taught the ladies of
Lewis the Fourteenth's degenerate Court
to love their Creator. The young yield∣ed
to her persuasive eloquence. She was
accused of corrupting youth. Her de∣fence
was in the spirit of her instructions.
“But the youth whom I have corrupted,
thou knowest, O my God, are full of
love to thee.” The error of pure love,
if it must be accounted an error, was yet
honourable for human nature. Like the
Stoic philosophy of old, it gave to the
world characters of sublime and godlike
virtue. The names of St Francis de Sales
and Fenelon, like those of Epictetus and
Antoninus, are lights shining in a dark
place. In the midst of degeneracy they
are pleasing memorials that God made
man after his own image.</P>

<HEAD>ART. VI.</HEAD>
<P>POLITICS is the last branch of edu∣cation.
The theory illustrates the
principles of virtue and religion. The
study of government and laws extends
the view of moral obligation; the stu∣dent
feels his relation to the public, and
meditates the duties of a citizen. The
history of nations, with the causes of
their rise and fall, extends the view of
Providence.</P>
<P>THE art of rising in life is at last the
object. Concerning politics in this sense
Lord Bacon observes, and perhaps the
observation was verified in himself, that
“unless the young be instructed in re∣ligious
and moral principles before
they proceed to politics, they are apt
to account moral differences unreal,
and to measure all things by utility
and success.” In the career of am∣bition,
<PB N="208" REF="216"/>
religion is a bulwark against sur∣rounding
temptation. Means suggested
by friends, and authorised by example, and
crowned with success, and adorned with
Chesterfield's eloquence, are reviewed by
conscience. Figure and fortune appear
light when laid in the balance with mo∣desty
and uprightness. The steps of a
religious youth may not be marked with
shining honours, but they will never be
stained by insincerity. A sense of the
Divine presence, become habitual and
pleasant, insures uprightness.</P>
<P>IN Roman Catholic countries there are
houses of spiritual retreat, where the well
disposed retire at times to commune with
God and with their own hearts. A pu∣blic
institution of this kind may seem
ostentatious, but the spirit of it is lau∣dable.
In the busiest life a day may be
found for sacred solitude. The youth
who has acquired a relish for the plea∣sures
<PB N="209" REF="217"/>
of devotion, yields his heart to
those pleasures. He views, at a proper
distance, the active life upon which he
has entered, and makes a true estimate
of wealth and fame and pre-eminence.
He attends to his character as an ac∣countable
being, and thinks of the time
when success or disappointment will fi∣gure
less than the steps by which they
arrived; when the pleasure of success
will be increased by the honourable
means of attaining it, and the pain of
disappointment lessened, because nothing
dishonourable was done to avert it. The
particular duties of his sphere are review∣ed:
if the review presents imperfections,
he does not disguise them to his own
mind, nor does he check humility. Un∣der
the impression of divine goodness, he
learns to forgive himself, and to improve
the experience of former errors against
future temptation. Plans of usefulness
are devised, and kind affections cherish∣ed.
<PB N="210" REF="218"/>
The beauties of virtue open in pro∣spect,
and, like a traveller refreshed, he
sets forward with alacrity.</P>
<P>THE intercourse of friendship is a fur∣ther
mean of uprightness. Young men
whose mutual attachment is dignified by
principle, investigate together the fair and
honourable course: self-deceit is unveil∣ed,
false shame is combated, and self∣esteem
is cherished. Religious conver∣sation
in mixed company was fashionable
once, and it degenerated into hypocrisy;
it now retires to the privacy of friend∣ship,
and resumes its charm. Truths
which elevate the soul are canvassed and
pondered. Generous affections flow and
mingle. Existence is felt to be a blessing.</P>
<P>ATTENDANCE on public worship is a
decent avowal of piety. In the solemn
assembly, the distinction of ranks is su∣spended,
mutual benevolence kindles, and
<PB N="211" REF="219"/>
the fire of devotion burns: the laws of
God are heard with reverence. Though
the effects of social worship be not al∣ways
felt, through the distraction of the
worshipper, or the incapacity of those
who minister; still one of just and liberal
sentiments will add the weight of his
example to an institution, which with
all its imperfections, promotes a sense of
God and of moral obligation among men.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7">
<HEAD>ART. VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE opinion of Rousseau, that re∣ligious
instruction may be safely
deferred till fifteen or even eighteen years
of age, has weight perhaps with some
parents and tutors, and contributes to
the neglect of early piety. Rousseau's
talents entitle him to a respectful hear∣ing;
but on a subject so important rea∣sons
ought to be weighed.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="220"/>
HE alleges that “the idea which a
young mind forms of God is low and
unworthy of him.” Will not this ar∣gument
likewise conclude against teach∣ing
religion to the old? The best idea
man can form of God is in many respects
low and unworthy of him. Still man is
made to know his Creator, and to act in
consequence of that knowledge. In teach∣ing
other sciences, we are not discouraged
tho' the learner's first views be imperfect;
we gradually present such as are more
clear and extensive and satisfying. It is
further to be considered, that in religion
the heart is concerned as much as the
understanding: affection may be sincere
while reason is feeble. The first love of
an innocent heart, is a sacrifice of a sweet
favour.</P>
<P>HE alleges that “it is better to have
no ideas of God than such as are in∣jurious,”
and thus accommodates a
<PB N="213" REF="221"/>
saying of Plutarch to his argument, “I
would rather be forgotten, than re∣membered
as unjust, envious, jealous,
and so tyrannical as to exact more
than I gave means of accomplishing.”
It were certainly better to be ignorant of
God, than to think him unjust and tyran∣nical;
but is it then impossible to con∣vey
to a young mind an idea of divine
benevolence? Will not that idea be re∣lished,
while pleasure and hope combine
to make the morning of life serene? Is
there a likelier mean of averting injurious
thoughts of God, than presenting such
as are just? A mind enlightened with
views of the divine goodness, and touched
with the participation of it, is prepared
to meet with temporary evils, and to
discern goodness through the veil. Is a
mind kept in ignorance of God till the
ills of life arise and thicken in prospect,
equally well prepared?</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="222"/>
HE labours to prove, what nobody
doubts, that God will not punish invo∣luntary
ignorance. But is there no blame
in voluntarily estranging the young from
piety? The importance of an early im∣pression
is acknowledged; Rousseau ac∣knowledged
and illustrated it in the case
of compassion. If love to men be promo∣ted
by exciting early and managing skil∣fully
sentiments of humanity; may not
love to God be promoted by exciting and
regulating devout sentiments, before the
pleasures and cares of this life take posses∣sion
of the heart? Our author laments,
that pleasures natural to the young and
suited to their years are with-held; and
in the spirit of philanthropy recommends
to parents, that at whatever period God
calls their children, they may not die
without having tasted happiness. Upon
this principle, it seems unkind to with∣hold
the pleasures of piety from the
young. Even in the dawn of reason, God
<PB N="215" REF="223"/>
is seen in his works, and felt in his fa∣vours;
and well grounded hopes arise:
the young can taste the pleasures of ad∣miration,
and praise, and trust. Youth is
not exempted from calamity: when fa∣ther
and mother forsake them, they re∣cognise
the providence of a Father in hea∣ven.
Those who minister at death-bed,
know that the young are susceptible of
divine consolation; that under its sacred
influence they suffer in patience, and
comfort their weeping parents, and die
in peace.</P>
<P>THERE are situations and events in
human life, which call forth the religious
principle: where it has been unculti∣vated,
as is generally the case in high
life, it appears in a forbidding form.
Lewis the Fourteenth's education was
neglected; his religion, when calamity
called it forth, was made up of abject su∣perstition
and cruel bigotry, ruinous in
proportion to his power. The conversions
<PB N="216" REF="224"/>
of <HI>eclat</HI> as they are called in France, usually
consist in a transition from the chambers
of voluptuousness to the cells of St Ursula
or St Bruno. Even in more enlightened
countries, religion, operating late in an
untutored mind, exhibits ostentatious
sanctity and blind credulity; conscience,
which ought to direct, submits to be di∣rected,
—a deposit too important to be en∣trusted
with any creature. The religious
principle, when duly cultivated, is a se∣curity
against profaneness on the one
hand, and fanaticism on the other; it
brings forth the peaceable fruits of righte∣ousness.</P>
<P>IF religious instruction be neglected
till the period marked by Rousseau, there
is the utmost reason to fear that it will
be for ever neglected. Your pupil must
pass through life destitute of the surest
guide; and he must pass through death
destitute of all consolation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8">
<PB N="217" REF="225"/>
<HEAD>ART. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>THE propriety of prayer is seldom
questioned, except by philosophers.
Rousseau in a treatise on Education says,
“I thank God for his favours, but I do
not pray to him. What should I ask?”
He professes “not to philosophise with
his pupil, but to assist him in consult∣ing
his own heart.” And is there not
in the heart a tendency to prayer strong∣ly
felt at times, as in danger that hu∣man
power cannot avert, in perplexity
from which human prudence cannot ex∣tricate,
under sorrow for which this world
yields no consolation, and under the pangs
of an awakened conscience? Was it not
a dictate of the heart which made the mo∣thers
of Israel bring their little children
to Jesus, that he might lay his hands on
them and pray?</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="226"/>
SHORT forms of prayer are of use at
first. The prayer which little children
are taught to make for their father and
their mother, may be considered as the
beginning of piety and filial love, and a
mean of unfolding them.</P>
<P>As children advance let the form be
varied. Let it express a sense of depen∣dance,
gratitude, and desire to grow in
favour with God and men. Fenelon's
morning prayer, “Faites que nous com∣mencions
aujourd'hui à nous corriger,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>” supposes the work still to begin,
it favours self-deceit and lukewarmness.
The forms should be adapted to a pro∣gressive
state.</P>
<P>LET prayer to God be made with re∣verence.
Reverence may be felt, even
before the object of it is distinctly ap∣prehended.
From that sympathetic reve∣rence
which the solemnities of worship
<PB N="219" REF="227"/>
excite, the mind gradually rises to an in∣visible
object.</P>
<P>THE preparation of the heart is neces∣sary.
It may be prepared by elevating
views of nature. “The heavens declare
the glory of the Lord: they declare it
to all the inhabitants of the earth.
There is no speech nor language where
their voice is not heard. Their awful
and majestic silence speaks the language
of every people. It speaks to the heart
of man.” Before that powerful and
benign Majesty, let us bow and worship.
Views of Providence may in like man∣ner
prepare the heart. “I wound and I
heal. I kill and I make alive.” To that
Being, in whose hand our life is, and who
alone can make us happy, let us devote
ourselves. Select passages of scripture may
be used to predispose the heart. Prayer
degenerates into rote, if the heart be not
prepared.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="228"/>
WHILE you pray with and for your
children, the principles of devotion in
their minds unfold. In that sacred hour,
they feel themselves the objects of tender
affection: they preceive that you are de∣pendent
as well as they, that blessings
must be derived from a higher hand on
yourselves and on them.</P>
<P>THE stated and avowed exercise of de∣votion,
is the only remedy against false
shame: the strongest arguments cannot
overcome it. Let parents who believe
in the efficacy of prayer, and who are
yet ashamed to pray, deliver their chil∣dren
from the same temptation.</P>
<P>WHEN the habit of praying daily is
acquired, devout thoughts associate with
the hour of prayer. The impression of
God's presence often renewed, checks
temptations, and strengthens virtue, and
establishes tranquillity of mind on a good
foundation.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">INSTRUCTIONS preparatory to the MAR∣RIED
STATE.</HEAD>
<P>PUBERTY, when new appetites and
desires spring up, is the most critical
time for education. Let the animal ap∣petite
be retarded as long as possible in
both sexes. It is not difficult to keep
females within bounds; for they are
trained to reserve and to suppress their
desires. As the same reserve enters not
into the education of young men, extra∣ordinary
means must be used to keep
them within bounds. Employ your male
pupil in hunting or other violent exercise
that engrosses him, and leaves no room
for wandering thoughts. But when he
cannot longer be restrained, then is the
time for discoursing with him of mar∣riage,
for displaying its sweets, and for
<PB N="222" REF="230"/>
painting the distresses both of mind and
body that result from a commerce with
loose women. Give instances of such
distresses; and describe them in vivid
colours, which at that ductile age will
make a lasting impression.</P>
<P>Now is the precious time for lecturing
your male pupil on the choice of a com∣panion
for life: no other branch of edu∣cation
is of deeper concern. Instil into
his heart, that happiness in the married
state, depends not on riches nor on
beauty, but on good sense and sweetness
of temper. Let him also keep in view,
that in a married woman, the manage∣ment
of domestic affairs and the edu∣cation
of children, are indispensable du∣ties.
He will never tire of such conver∣sation;
and if he have any degree of
sensibility, it will make such an impres∣sion
as to guard him against a hasty
choice. If not well guarded, he will
<PB N="223" REF="231"/>
probably fall a prey to beauty or other
external qualification, of little import∣ance
in the matrimonial state. He sets
his heart on a pretty face, or a sprightly
air: he is captivated by a good singer or
a nimble dancer; and his heated imagi∣nation
bestows on the admired object
every perfection. A young man who has
profited by the instructions given him,
is not so easily captivated. The picture
of a good wife is fixed in his mind;
and he compares with it every young
woman he sees. “She is pretty, but has
she good sense? She has sense, but is
she well tempered? She dances ele∣gantly,
or sings with expression; but
is she not vain of such trifles?” Judg∣ment
and sagacity will produce a deli∣berate
choice: love will come with mar∣riage;
and in that state it makes an illus∣trious
figure. After proper instruction,
let the young man be at full liberty to
chuse for himself. In looking about
<PB N="224" REF="232"/>
where to apply, he cannot be better di∣rected,
than to a family where the parents
and children live in perfect harmony, and
are fond of one another. A young wo∣man
of such a family, seldom fails to
make a good wife.</P>
<P>BEAUTY commonly is the first thing
that attracts; and yet ought rather to
be avoided in a wife. It is a danger∣ous
property, tending to corrupt her
mind, though it soon loses its influence
over the husband. A figure agreeable
and engaging, which inspires affection
without the ebriety of love, is a much
safer choice. The graces lose not their in∣fluence
like beauty: at the end of thirty
years, a virtuous woman who makes an
agreeable companion, charms her hus∣band
perhaps more than at first. The
comparison of love to fire holds good in
one respect, that the fiercer it burns the
sooner it is extinguished.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="233"/>
FROM the making choice of a wife we
proceed to the making choice of a hus∣band.
Mothers and nurses are conti∣nually
talking of marriage to their fe∣male
pupils, long before it is suggested
by nature; and it is always a great
estate, a fine coat, or a gay equipage that
is promised. Such objects impressed on
the mind of a child, will naturally bias
her to a wrong choice when she grows
up. Let her never hear of marriage but as
proper for men and women: nature will
suggest it to a young woman, perhaps
sooner than she is capable of making a
prudent choice. Neglect not at that time
to talk to her of a comfortable compa∣nion
for life. Let her know, that she will
be despised if she marry below her rank;
that happiness however depends not on
dignity, nor on riches, but on the hus∣band's
good temper, sobriety, and in∣dusty,
joined with a competency. At
<PB N="226" REF="234"/>
the same time, to prevent a rash choice,
make it a frequent subject of conver∣sation,
that marriage is a hazardous step,
especially for the female sex, as an error
in chusing a husband admits of no reme∣dy;
that the duties of a married woman
are burdensome, the comforts not always
corresponding. Give her the history of
prudent women, who, not finding a
match to their liking, pass an easy inde∣pendent
life, much regarded by their
friends and acquaintance. When a wo∣man
has given up the thoughts of matri∣mony,
what employment more reputable
can she have, than the education of
young girls. Let her adopt for an heir
a female child: she will soon feel the af∣fection
of a mother, especially if she make
a discreet choice. A mother's affection
commences, it is true, with the birth of
her child; an affection however extreme∣ly
slender, compared with what she feels
afterward from her watchful attention to
<PB N="227" REF="235"/>
its welfare, and from its suitable returns
of gratitude. A woman who adopts a
promising child, has in that respect every
advantage that a mother enjoys. At any
rate, the condition of a maiden lady with
an adopted daughter, cannot in any view
be thought inferior to that of a widow
left with one or more children. I have
the good fortune to be acquainted with
three maiden ladies in high esteem, who
have each of them undertaken the charge
of a young orphan family. In all ap∣pearance,
they live as happily as any wi∣dow;
and assuredly more so than many
a married woman. Let it not however
be thought, that I am endeavouring to
dissuade young women from matrimony:
it would be a flagitious as well as foolish
attempt. My purpose only is to mode∣rate
a too violent appetite for it.</P>
<P>BUT now, supposing a young woman
perfectly tractable, no means ought to
<PB N="228" REF="236"/>
be neglected for making her an useful
and agreeable companion in the matri∣monial
state. To make a good husband,
is but one branch of a man's duty; but
it is the chief duty of a woman, to make
a good wife. To please her husband, to
be a good oeconomist, and to educate
their children, are capital duties, each of
which requires much training. Nature
lays the foundation: diligence and saga∣city
in the conductor, will make a beau∣tiful
superstructure. The time a girl be∣stows
on her doll, is a prognostic that
she will be equally diligent about her
offspring.</P>
<P>WOMEN, destined by nature to be obe∣dient,
ought to be disciplined early to
bear wrongs, without murmuring. This
is a hard lesson; and yet it is necessary
even for their own sake: sullenness or
peevishness may alienate the husband;
but tend not to sooth his roughness, nor
<PB N="229" REF="237"/>
to moderate his impetuosity. Heaven
made women insinuating, but not in or∣der
to be cross: it made them feeble,
not in order to be imperious: it gave
them a sweet voice, not in order to scold:
it did not give them beauty, in order to
disfigure it by anger.</P>
<P>BUT after all, has nature dealt so par∣tially
among her children, as to bestow
on the one sex absolute authority, leaving
nothing to the other but absolute sub∣mission?
This indeed has the appearance
of great partiality. But let us ponder a
little.—Has a good woman no influence
over her husband? I answer, that that
very simple virtue of submission, can be
turned to good account. A man indeed
bears rule over his wife's person and con∣duct:
his will is law. Providence how∣ever
has provided her with means to
bear rule over his will. He governs by
law, she by persuasion. Nor can her influ∣ence
<PB N="230" REF="238"/>
ever fail, if supported by sweetness
of temper and zeal to make him happy.
Rousseau says charmingly, “Hers is a
sovereignty founded on complacence
and address: caresses are her orders,
tears are her menaces. She governs in
the family as a minister does in the state,
procuring commands to be laid on her,
for doing what she inclines to do.”</P>
<P>ALL beings are fitted by nature for
their station. Domestic concerns are the
province of the wife; and nature prompts
young women to qualify themselves for
behaving well in that station: young
men never think of it. I know several
ladies of good understanding, who, at
the distance of weeks, can recal to me∣mory
the particulars of every dinner they
had been invited to.</P>
<P>FROM a married woman engaged in
family concerns, a more staid behaviour
<PB N="231" REF="239"/>
is expected, than from a young woman
before marriage; and consequently a
greater simplicity of dress. Cornelia,
daughter of the great Scipio and mother
of the Gracchi, makes a figure in the
Roman story. She was visited by a lady
of rank, who valued dress, and was re∣marked
for an elegant toilet. Observing
every thing palin in Cornelia's apart∣ment,
“Madam, says she, I wish to see
your toilet, for it must be superb.”
Cornelia waved the subject till her chil∣dren
came from school. “These, my
good friend, are my ornaments, and
all I have for a toilet.” Here is dis∣played
pure nature in perfection. A girl
begins with her doll, then thinks of
adorning her own person. When she is
married, her children become her dolls,
upon whom all her taste in dress is dis∣played.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">INSTRUCTIONS concerning the CULTURE
of the HEAD or UNDERSTANDING.</HEAD>
<P>IN planning the present work, I had
chiefly in view the culture of the heart;
prompted by two motives, first, its supe∣rior
importance in the conduct of life;
next, its being in a great measure over∣looked
by writers upon education. The
culture of the understanding has been
so amply displayed by excellent writers,
as to afford little matter for additions. As
however there is a certain period, during
which the culture of the head may be
carried on jointly with that of the heart,
the following hints are added relative to
the former, and preparatory to a more re∣gular
course of instruction at school or
college.</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> IN order to smooth the road to
knowledge, it ought to be a chief concern
<PB N="233" REF="241"/>
in the preceptor, to promote in his pupils
an appetite for it. Give them examples
of men, who, from a low state, have by
learning arrived to great fame and ho∣nour.
Let such examples be introdu∣ced
occasionally, as a subject only of con∣versation.
Leave the application to the
young men; which will have a much
finer effect, than if the preceptor himself
should make the application.</P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> BOYS ought so far to be treated
like men, as to be informed before hand
of the benefit expected from what they
are ordered to do or to learn; which will
make them apply with double vigour.
Rousseau gives a lively example. His
<HI>Eleve,</HI> before he could read, got a writ∣ten
invitation to a milk feast. He applied
to every person in the family, desiring to
know the contents of the billet; but they
could not read, or pretended they could
not. The opportunity was lost; and from
<PB N="234" REF="242"/>
that moment he was restless till he was
taught to read.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> IN teaching children any art, read∣ing
for example, arithmetic, geography,
let it not be considered as a formal study,
but as an amusement. Cut letters in
wood, give them names, scatter them,
and desire your <HI>Eleve</HI> to bring a particu∣lar
letter. Let him try to imitate the
letter that is brought. Employ him to
count the number of panes in a window,
or of shillings on a table. These hints
may be varied a thousand ways, much
to his instruction as well as amusement.
An agreeable way of learning geography,
is to have every county or kingdom by
itself pasted on wood. After studying the
general map, let your pupil try to join
the parts into one whole. A pack of
cards containing the names and pictures
of great men, with a short account of
them, will be an agreeable introduction
<PB N="235" REF="243"/>
to history. Cards may be successfully
applied to many other purposes.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> IT will facilitate the acquiring of
any art, to divide it into all its distinct
branches. Before a child is taught to
read, acquaint it with letters, next with
syllables, and then with words. Fami∣liarizé
your pupil with the Greek letters,
so as to read Greek before you enter him
upon the meaning. Begin not to teach
Euclid, till he is well acquainted with
the different figures. In that view, em∣ploy
him to inscribe a circle in a square,
a triangle in a circle, and so on. This
manual operation will be an enticing a∣musement:
and at the same time contri∣bute
to make the demonstrations more
readily apprehended. Introduce him to
the knowledge of the terrestrial globe, so
as to be able to point out every kingdom
and every city, before commencing a re∣gular
course of geography.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="244"/>
<HI>5th,</HI> A CONTINUAL attention to a single
object, is the hardest task that can be
imposed on children. They are prone to
variety, which is peculiarly useful in
childhood, intended by nature for ac∣quiring
ideas. When the thoughts of a
child begin to wander, change the sub∣ject.
Rebuke and correction, commonly
employed to force attention, fill the mind
with fear and concern, leaving no room
for other impressions.</P>
<P><HI>6th,</HI> EXERCISE your children to re∣cite
stories they have heard or read. It
improves their articulation, gives them
words at command, and tends to form
their stile. This ought to be a frequent
occupation.</P>
<P><HI>7th,</HI> WHEN the faculty of reason begins
to make some figure, exercise your pupils
to draw morals from fables well chosen.
Present to them first fables of which the
moral is obvious and striking. Proceed
<PB N="237" REF="245"/>
to fables the moral of which is less ob∣vious.
The progress ought to be slow;
for to draw a proper moral, requires
much practice, or uncommon penetra∣tion.
To facilitate that exercise, I recom∣mend
a little book entitled, <HI>An Introduc∣tion
to the Art of Thinking.</HI> Take a hint
also from the same book, to exercise your
pupils in conjecturing the existence of un∣known
facts, from facts that are known.
Take the following instance. Rousseau,
in his travels through England, observing
a smooth foot-path at the side of every
high road, conjectures that the English
must be highly benevolent, because they
provide comfortable roads for the low
people, who are neglected in every other
country.</P>
<P><HI>8th,</HI> To form a stile in young persons of
twelve or thirteen, I suggest the follow∣ing
method. Take a long sentence in an
English author, Lord Bolinbroke, for in∣stance,
<PB N="238" REF="246"/>
who delights in long sentences;
reduce it to the simplest arrangement,
but so as to be perfectly intelligible. Em∣ploy
your pupil to arrange it in the best
order he can. After frequent trials with
the tutor's observations on them, I have
known much facility acquired in arrange∣ment;
sentences sometimes arranged, per∣haps,
better than by the author himself.</P>
<P><HI>9th,</HI> REGULAR hours at school of read∣ing
and of diversion, have a woful effect.
Children, after a painful lesson, are let
out to play. Their time, being circum∣scribed,
appears always too short. From
the height of amusement, they are forced
back to a dry lesson. Can it be expected,
that in such a state of mind they will li∣sten
to serious instruction? Let them
play, let them fatigue themselves: guard
only against sauntering. When suffici∣ently
tired, lead them back with a chear∣ful
countenance to a lesson, as a change
<PB N="239" REF="247"/>
of amusement: This is agreeable to hu∣man
nature; and I hold it to be decisive
against a public school, till young persons
have acquired as much understanding as
to be convinced of the benefit of instruc∣tion,
without needing any collateral in∣citement.
To torment young creatures
with Latin before that time, is likely to
make them abhor it. “Id in primis
cavere opportebit, ne studia, qui amare
nondum poterit, oderit, et amaritudi∣nem
semel perceptam etiam ultra ru∣des
annos reformidet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quintil. L. 1. C. 1.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><HI>10th,</HI> THE instructions given above,
which can only be put in practice by a
private tutor, shew the benefit, or rather
necessity, of prolonging domestic educa∣tion.
There is another reason still more
cogent. A public school answers finely
for initiating young men in the manners
of the world, leading each to mind him∣self
<PB N="240" REF="248"/>
and to guard against others. But is
there to be found in a public school, a
censor of manners, or a guardian of mo∣rals?
The master concerns himself with
neither, except that his disciples behave
orderly when he is lecturing. Nor in∣deed
is it possible, that he can have con∣stantly
under his eye, such numbers as
are commonly at a public school. Hence
it is in a measure essential, that a young
man be well tutored in morals, at least,
before he be left to himself, among a num∣ber
of young men of very different dis∣positions.
Virtue, decency, order, con∣sist
mostly in restraint, a negative which
makes no figure externally. It is the
bold spirit, disdaining restraint, that
makes a figure, is admired and followed.
Do parents apprehend no danger of their
son being led astray at a public school?
Surely there is great danger, if he be not
sufficiently prepared at home to resist
temptation. In the Spectator, a young
<PB N="241" REF="249"/>
man is described, who sunk into vice by
not being able to pronounce the mono∣syllable
No. If you put any value on
morals, permit not your son to enter a
public school, till he can pronounce with
a manly assurance the monosyllable No.</P>
<P><HI>11th,</HI> EPISTLES to friends, or to favour∣ites,
may be an amusement at a public
school as well as at home; and this a∣musement
may be encouraged as early
as young folks have learned to write to∣lerably.
It is an agreeable amusement:
it improves their hand, and enures them
to express their thoughts readily. When
they have learned the art of arranging
sentences as above, the improvement it
makes in their epistles delights them.</P>
<P><HI>12th,</HI> PEOPLE are industrious to lay up
a stock of money for their children; but
few think of a more useful stock, that of
ideas, though it can be procured in less
<PB N="242" REF="250"/>
time and with less labour. One who in
youth has collected such a stock, who de∣lights
in reading, and who has acquired
a habit of thinking and observing, can
never pine for want of company. This
person possesses the magic art of raising
the dead, and conversing familiarly with
the greatest men of past times. That
source of entertainment never dries up,
not even in old age. It is my sincere
opinion, that a common peasant enjoys
more felicity, than a man of fortune whose
education has been neglected, who is so ig∣norant
as even to put no value on know∣ledge,
who lives from hour to hour with∣out
plan or prospect. It requires an extra∣ordinary
genius to lead an idle life with
any degree of satisfaction or esteem. Com∣pany
is not always in our power; and in
company a man makes but a silly figure,
however plentiful his board is, if he has
nothing to say to his guests. I have in
my eye a married couple, who began
with a large stock of money; but no
<PB N="243" REF="251"/>
ideas except what were picked up occasi∣onally,
and consequently of the simplest
kind. The sum of the man's learning
was a smattering of Latin; and of the
woman's, Dryden's plays and two or
three French romances. With that stock,
scanty as it was, they made a tolerable
shift the first years of their union. In
youth the world is new; and a flow of
spirits is in itself enjoyment. The couple
are now old, in easy circumstances, but
no fund of conversation, no taste for
books, nothing to do. Is it not a deplo∣rable
case, to be as it were on the brink
of happiness, and yet entirely excluded
from it? The picture of sauntering Jack
and idle Joan, has a foundation in na∣ture.</P>
<P><HI>13th,</HI> WITH respect to things proper to
be known by persons of condition, I re∣commend
botany as a favourite, not what
is commonly taught, fit only for those
<PB N="244" REF="252"/>
who intend to be professors, but the
powers and properties of plants, their
flowers, their fruit, their odour, their cul∣tivation,
and in short every particular
that gives satisfaction to a reflecting mind.
Married women of condition, cannot be
more agreeably employed, than in adorn∣ing
their gardens and pleasure grounds
with trees, shrubs and flowers, which
bounteous nature produces in great va∣riety
for our amusement. In this coun∣try,
it is common to teach girls the harp∣sichord,
which shows a pretty hand and a
nimble finger, without ever thinking
whether they have a genius for music,
or even an ear. It serves indeed to fill a
gap in time, which some parents are at a
loss how otherwise to employ. By all
means, let their taste in music be im∣proved,
if they have any, as well as in
painting, and in the other fine arts; but
I find no good reason for degrading
young women of condition, to be musi∣cians
<PB N="245" REF="253"/>
more than painters. Such labori∣ous
occupations, which consume much
time, are proper for those only who
purpose to live by them. If, however,
a young woman of rank, be violently
bent on music or painting, it would be
cruel to restrain her; but I would yield
with reluctance. I am not of the same
opinion with respect to dancing. To be
a good player on the harpsichord, requires
only a fine ear with perseverance: it is
no index of mental faculties. To dance
well, that is, to dance with grace and ex∣pression,
a certain dignity of mind is re∣quisite,
supported by good sense; and
therefore, dancing well is an index of
the mind. I add, that elegant motions
in dancing, are communicated to walk∣ing
and to every gesture. Much time,
however, in teaching a girl to dance, is
thrown away if she have not a pregnant
genius: it is sufficient that her motions
be made easy, to prevent being aukward.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="254"/>
<HI>14th,</HI> As in forming the two sexes, every
thing that tends to rivalship is avoided,
nature ought to be copied in education.
You cannot exceed in displaying to young
women human nature, its principles, its
passions, its faculties, its frailties; for by
that branch of knowledge, their conduct
is directed. History also ought to be
their study as well as that of the men.
A general knowledge of the sciences and
of their utility, may be opened to them
historically; because it will enable them
to put a just value on men of learning,
and withdraw them from fops and frib∣lers.
But avoid the intricacies of philo∣sophy
and deep reasoning; which would
tend to emulation, not to cordiality. A
woman of sense prudently educated,
makes a delicious companion to a man
of parts and knowledge. An ignorant
woman, if she consult her peace of mind,
will accept of no man for a husband, but
who is ignorant like herself. She cannot
<PB N="247" REF="255"/>
be a companion for a man of knowledge;
and the sense of her inferiority renders
her unhappy. To people who labour for
bread, conversation is very little neces∣sary,
but essential to persons of rank;
and therefore, to unite in matrimony, a
man of taste and knowledge, with a shal∣low
female, is indeed woful. What fi∣gure
will such a woman make in educa∣ting
their common offspring; and how
mortifying must it be to the man to have
his children ill educated? How can she
train them to virtue when she is ignorant
of the means? She knows of no means
but flattery or threats, which, far from
improving, render them insolent or ti∣mid.</P>
<P><HI>15th,</HI> IT is curious to observe the pro∣gress
of nature in bestowing knowledge.
Children learn words before they can
speak; and when they can speak, they
employ these words to explain what they
<PB N="248" REF="256"/>
want, obscurely indeed for some time.
The full import of words being learned
by degrees, children express themselves
more and more accurately, as they ad∣vance
towards maturity. There are how∣ever
many words which are never per∣fectly
understood by the generality, <HI>per∣sonal
identity</HI> for example, <HI>chance, space.
Taste</HI> is a common word; and yet it
would puzzle many a good writer, to
give it a precise meaning. Were teach∣ers
reduced to use no word but what
their pupils perfectly understand, instruc∣tion
could not begin before maturity of
age; and much later, if ever, with many.
Yet the celebrated Rousseau, overlooking
the progress of nature, maintains stre∣nuously,
that in teaching children, no
word ought to be used but what denotes
something they are acquainted with, that
is, some known object of the external
senses. With respect to the fable of the
fox and raven, he pronounces it absurd
<PB N="249" REF="257"/>
to mention these animals to a child, if it
has never seen them. I cannot subscribe
to this opinion. A child may know that
a raven is a bird, and a fox a beast, with∣out
having seen either. With that im∣perfect
knowledge, however, the child
may understand the fable as well as if it
had seen both. People of Europe talk
familiarly of a lion, and with intel∣ligence;
though few in that part of the
world ever saw a lion. With respect to
geography, he observes, that to point
out countries and towns in a map, is but
an imperfect way of teaching their true
position. I grant; and would take a
better way if it were in my offer. Teach∣ing,
however, by the map is far from
being useless: the pupil retains the po∣sition
of places as delineated there; and
when his faculties ripen, he readily trans∣fers
that ideal position from the map to
the globe of the earth. Rousseau de∣clares
against teaching history, till young
<PB N="250" REF="258"/>
people are ripe for judging of causes and
consequences. This, with many, would
prove a very late beginning. I am for
teaching history as soon as the plain facts
can be comprehended; <HI>first,</HI> because it is
agreeable to children; and <HI>next,</HI> because
it makes the facts known and ready for
use when people are able to judge of
causes and consequences. Were our
author's doctrine to hold, a child should
never hear the name of God. That word
signifies a Being, of whom the most pe∣netrating
philosopher has but an obscure
conception, which must be still more ob∣scure
in a child. It is proper however,
to give children an impression of a good
Being, who made us and protects us.
Their notion of a Deity, will purify as
they grow up.</P>
<P><HI>16th,</HI> SO far indeed I heartily agree with
Rousseau, that in teaching children, the
simplest words should be preferred, where
<PB N="251" REF="259"/>
it can be done. This concludes still more
forcibly against employing general rules;
for they are above the comprehension of
children, and instruction goes on better
and more pleasantly without them. In
teaching a language, it is the universal
practice to begin with grammar, and to
do every thing by rule. I affirm this to
be a most preposterous method. Gram∣mar
is contrived for men, not for children.
Its natural place is between language and
logic: it ought to close lectures on the
former, and to be the first lectures on the
latter. It is a gross deception that a
language cannot be taught without rules.
A boy who is flogged into grammar∣rules,
makes a shift to apply them; but
he applies them by rote like a parrot.
Boys, for the knowledge they acquire of a
language, are not indebted to dry rules,
but to practice and observation. To this
day, I never think without shuddering of
Disputer's grammar, which was my daily
<PB N="252" REF="260"/>
persecution during the most important
period of life. Curiosity, when I was
farther advanced in years, prompted me
to look into a book that had given me
so much trouble. At this time, I under∣stood
the rules perfectly; and was asto∣nished
that formerly they had been to
me words without meaning, which I had
been taught to apply mechanically, with∣out
knowing how or why. Deplorable
it is, that young creatures should be so
punished without being guilty of any
fault—more than sufficient to produce a
disgust at learning, instead of promoting
it. Whence then the absurdity of per∣secuting
boys with grammar-rules? Pride
is the cause. By using rules, the teacher
of Latin flatters himself, that his profes∣sion
equals in dignity that of logic and
mathematics, to which rules are essen∣tial.
Even a humble teacher of English
to children four or five years old, will,
in spite of common sense, make a figure
by his rules.</P>

<P>THE restlessness of man has been
a topic of frequent declamation;
“That after much thought and labour
in the pursuit of any good, the acqui∣sition
bestows but a momentary plea∣sure,
that the person becomes as rest∣less
as before, in the pursuit of some
new object; and in short, that most
men pass life in toil and anxiety, with∣out
ever resting contented with what
they possess.” Writers who have a
just sense of religion, account for this
disposition from the following principle,
<PB N="254" REF="262"/>
That this life is to us a time of trial,
to prepare for a better; and that hap∣piness
in it, beside being inconsistent
with such a trial, would divert our
thoughts from a better life.” Other
writers who have no thought but of our
present state, hold this disposition to be a
gross imperfection in human beings,
made as it would appear not for their
own happiness, but for some latent pur∣pose.</P>
<P>As the tracing the ways of Providence
has always been to me a favourite study,
I chearfully enter the lists against the wri∣ters
last mentioned.</P>
<P>THERE may be animals which have
no enjoyment beyond rest and food. But
man is not so made. His constitution
fits him for action; and he takes plea∣sure
in it. Did he take delight in rest,
he would be an absurd being, consider∣ing
<PB N="255" REF="263"/>
that this earth produces little for him
but what requires preparation; that raw
materials are furnished in plenty; but
that much labour is requisite to convert
them into food, cloathing, habitation.
I observe further, that though the seeds
of all valuable knowledge are originally
in us, yet that persevring culture is ne∣cessary
to make them productive. What
then would man be in his present state,
were rest his delight, his <HI>summum bonum?</HI></P>
<P>THUS, upon the activity of man, de∣pend
all his comforts internal and ex∣ternal.
“Admitted, say my antagonists.
Man is not blamed for his activity in
procuring the comforts of life; but
for his restlessness in never being sa∣tisfied
with his present comforts.”</P>
<P>These writers certainly will not condemn
restlessness in the lump: they will ap∣prove
restlessness in doing good; which
undoubtedly is one of the noblest pro∣perties
<PB N="256" REF="264"/>
that belong to human nature.
Restlessness then, as far as reprehensible,
must be confined to the selfish passions.
Nor can all of these be comprehended;
for surely there is no vice in restlessness
to acquire fame, or the good will of
others. Restlessness with regard to cor∣poreal
enjoyments, I acknowledge to be
hurtful. Nor is it even there a defect in
the nature of man, but one of the perni∣cious
consequences of indulging such
enjoyments to excess. As they are the
lowest enjoyments of our nature, intem∣perance
in them soon produces satiety
and disgust; from which the luxurious
have no relief but by frequent change
of objects. This miserable restlessness,
the fruit of intemperance in grovelling
pleasures, will not find a single votary.
Consider on the other hand a social dis∣position.
A man of benevolence, whose
happiness chiefly consists in serving
others, can never rest satisfied in his pre∣sent
<PB N="257" REF="265"/>
state: opportunities of doing good
daily occur, and employ him without end.
The more opulent he is, the more restless
he will be; because opulence multiplies
his opportunities of doing good.</P>
<P>ACTIVITY is essential to a social be∣ing:
to a selfish being it is of no use,
after procuring the means of living. A
selfish man, who by his opulence has all
the luxuries of life at command, and de∣pendents
without number, has no occa∣sion
for activity. Hence it may fairly
be inferred, that were man destined by
providence to be entirely selfish, he would
be disposed by his constitution to rest,
and never would be active when he
could avoid it. The natural activity of
man therefore, is to me evidence, that
his Maker did not intend him to be pure∣ly
a selfish being.</P>
<P>THIS leads me to compare selfishness
with benevolence. Selfishness in one in∣stance
<PB N="258" REF="266"/>
is not only innocent but laudable,
which is in coveting fame or good will.
These appetites however prevail but in
few, compared with the appetite for cor∣poreal
pleasures. It would be too exten∣sive
for the present essay, to show all the
advantages of benevolence over corporeal
pleasures; that no corporeal pleasure con∣tributes
so much to happiness as the ex∣ercise
of benevolence; that the latter
raises a man in his own esteem and in
that of others, whereas the former lessens
him in both. I shall therefore confine
myself to one particular, which is the su∣perior
advantage of benevolence from its
permanency. Corporeal pleasures, how∣ever
sweet at first, soon lose their relish;
nor is there any way to prevent satiety,
but change of objects. This is strongly
exemplified in that low commerce be∣tween
the sexes, founded on the carnal
appetite merely; which requires new
objects daily, because the pleasure of
<PB N="259" REF="267"/>
the same object is soon at an end. Nor
can novelty long support this grovelling
appetite: frequent repetition without
waiting the calls of nature, blunts the
charm of novelty: every new object ap∣pears
less and less new; and that charm
vanishes long before middle age. This sug∣gests
a second inference, that were man
intended to be entirely a selfish being,
his life would be made much shorter than
it is. Benevolence on the contrary ac∣quires
vigour by exercise, and the more
good we do, the more we are inclined to
do. The satisfaction it affords is not
blunted even by old age, which blunts
every other enjoyment. The body may
decay, but the pleasure of doing good,
when habitual, continues the same, even
to the last moment of existence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With respect to those who are in constant pur∣suit of pleasure, which as constantly escapes their grasp, a writer of spirit exclaims as follows. “At that rate poverty is the greatest blessing of life. By delaying gratification of the appetites, it makes gratification a pleasure. It keeps the soul awake with expectation, and enlivens it with hope. In a word, the reputed wretch, who begs from door to door, is really happier than the rich man who has every pleasure in his power; and yet, from the easiness of attainment, feels no gratification.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="268"/>
LISTEN to this doctrine ye parents and
tutors: and hasten to inspire those under
your care with affection to their fellow
creatures. Let them know, that even
for their own sake, benevolence is great∣ly
preferable to selfishness. This lesson, it
is true, may be gathered in the commerce
of the world; but if the mind be left
without instruction, it is very apt to ac∣quire
a selfish bias; and then the lesson
comes too late. Teach your pupils sub∣mission
to superiors, and civility and
complaisance to inferiors. Let acts of
benevolence be their daily exercise. Give
them money for charity, and accustom
them to account how it has been laid out.
Let them visit the sick, and carry to them
<PB N="261" REF="269"/>
what is proper for their relief. Exhort
them to be kindly to their companions,
and to be ready to assist them in distress.
Convince them, that in such conduct
they will find much more gratification,
than in yielding to selfish appetites. Be∣nevolence
thus cultivated in children,
becomes, in time, their ruling passion:
they will be the delight of their parents,
a blessing to their relations, and the ob∣jects
of universal good will and esteem.</P>

<HEAD>ART. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OPINION and BELIEF less influenced by
Reason than by Temper and Education.</HEAD>
<P>IN the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Severus
Coecina moved to have a law enacted,
that no Roman governor should carry his
wife with him to his province. He said,
“that he had a wife and six children, and
that he always left them at home, tho',
<PB N="262" REF="270"/>
in different provinces, he had borne
arms for the republic more than
forty years; that by such attendants
peace degenerates into luxury, war in∣to
confusion, and a Roman army into
a mob of barbarians; that not only
weak and unequal to labour is the fe∣male
sex, but, where not restrained,
cruel and greedy of power: that they
love to range among the soldiers and
to cabal with the leaders.” He in∣treated
the senate to consider the danger∣ous
tendency of bribery and corruption
in a governor. “Yet how often, added
he, have their wives been noted for
these crimes! Thē infamous of every
province cling to them for refuge;
which establishes in effect two gover∣nors
in a province, and opposite in∣terests.
The paying court to the wives
of magistrates, is prohibited by our
old laws; and as these seem now to
be in oblivion; not satisfied to domi∣neer
<PB N="263" REF="271"/>
at home, they infest the courts of
justice, armies, and the senate.” Coecina
ended without applause: a confused mur∣mur
spread through the assembly. Vale∣rius
Messalinus answered thus. “Our
forefathers, involved in perpetual war,
and reduced frequently to defend the
gates of Rome, were rigid in discipline,
and austere in manners. We have now
no enemy to fear: victorious Rome is
the seat of empire. Peaceable times
produce kindly manners; and our old
customs have yielded to gentleness and
humanity. Society between husband
and wife is founded on nature; and
nature ought to prevail. Against the
enemy let us march with nothing but
our arms: returning victorious, why
should we be denied the reward of a
comfortable companion? Some women
are prone to avarice or ambition; and
so are some men. Is the latter a good
reason for leaving our provinces with∣out
<PB N="264" REF="272"/>
governors? Some men have been
corrupted by their wives; but are all
bachelors of unspotted fame? Because
of a few instances of bad women, shall
our citizens be deprived of their great∣est
blessing whether in adversity or pro∣sperity?
In vain do we charge our
vices upon others: let us fairly ac∣knowledge
the fault to be in the hus∣band,
when the wife goes astray. Is
it of no moment, that by the projected
law the brittle sex would be exposed to
their own luxury, and to the lust of
profligate men? As the husband's pre∣sence
is no more than sufficient to keep
them within bounds, ought a law to
be made for separating them? Thus
in straining for a remedy to foreign
evils, we open a door to unbounded
vice at home.” Drusus the Emperor's
adopted son added, “That princes are
often called to distant expeditions;
how often did Augustus visit the ex∣tremities
<PB N="265" REF="273"/>
of his empire, accompanied
by his faithful Livia! That he himself
has led armies far from the city, and
was ready at all times to serve his
country; but would go with little sa∣tisfaction,
if torn from his dear wife,
the worthy mother of many children.”
I need not inform the reader that Taci∣tus
is my author, who adds, that the
motion was rejected.</P>
<P>TO which side does the reader incline?
This question is, in appearance, deeply
political; and yet I violently suspect,
that the good of the state was not what
moved any of the speakers. Imagine a
grave senator with a long beard, stand∣ing
up and delivering what follows:
“Gentlemen, each of you have in your
own opinion, urged unanswerable ar∣guments;
and is surprised, that any
should stand out against conviction.
But I let you into a secret, that your
<PB N="266" REF="274"/>
arguments have not convinced even
yourselves. Your conviction is found∣ed
upon character, not in the least up∣on
reasons of state. You Drusus are
in the flower of youth, vigorous, and
delighting in the commerce of women.
—You Coecina are old, crabbed, and
long past the pleasures of youth.”</P>
<P>IT is an observation universally ad∣mitted,
that in the conduct of life, men
are influenced more by passion and pre∣judice
than by reason. A man who is
prone to suspicion and distrust, will be
jealous of his wife, and lock up every
thing from his servants. One addicted
to society, has no existence but in a
crowd. A person on the contrary of a
solitary disposition, retires to the moun∣tains,
and declares war against the fea∣thered
kind. “Is it not more innocent,
says he, to make war upon birds than
upon men?” The man must be won∣drous
<PB N="267" REF="275"/>
cool who is always obsequious to
reason: such a one would indeed be a
singular phaenomenon. Is there any
thing more common than a person going
astray, notwithstanding the admonitions
of conscience? Passion, it is true, does
not always appear so openly. It fre∣quently
by deep disguise convinces us,
that our opinions and belief are found∣ed
on solid principles. Thus, being im∣posed
on by passion under the mask of
reason, self-deceit is spread through the
human race. The story above mention∣ed,
is a noted instance; and such occur
every day. Show me a man who is fired
with ambition and love of power: you,
in vain, will attempt to convince him,
that Alexander was not a greater man
than Socrates. The opinions we form
of men and things, are the result of af∣fection
more than of evidence. An ad∣vice
given by a man of figure, is highly
regarded: the same advice from one in
<PB N="268" REF="276"/>
low condition, is despised or neglected.
A courageous person under-rates danger:
to the indolent the slightest obstacle ap∣pears
unsurmountable. A person of ve∣racity,
relying on the veracity of others,
is easy of belief: where a man's veracity
is so supple as to bend to his interest, he
will be suspicious of evidence and hard
of belief. Hence it is, that upon the be∣nevolent
and humane, the arguments for
the goodness of the Deity, make a deep∣er
impression, than on the sullen and
morose. How important then is the
art of education, when upon it in a
great measure depends, not only our be∣haviour
and conduct; but even our
judgment and understanding, by which
chiefly we are elevated above the brute
creation! What can be more interesting
to human beings, than their conviction
of the existence of a benevolent Deity,
their Maker, their Father, their Protec∣tor?
Did parents seriously consider, that
<PB N="269" REF="277"/>
this conviction depends in some measure
upon our disposition, they would neglect
no opportunity of sweetning the temper
of their children, and improving their
benevolence. The time for such discip∣line,
is confined to pupillage, when the
mind, like wax, is deeply susceptible of
impressions. At maturity, it becomes
inflexible like the body, and then culture
comes too late. Against passions and
prejudices that never have been control∣led,
the most cogent reasons signify little.
Arguments that accord with a man's taste
are greedily swallowed, while the unpala∣table
are rejected with disgust. He is
therefore no adept in logic, who hopes to
convince others by arguments that have
weight with himself. He ought to study
the temper of the person he would con∣vince,
and urge the arguments that are
suited to that temper. Drusus was fond
of glory; and Coecina might have pre∣vailed,
had he painted in lively colours,
<PB N="270" REF="278"/>
how glorious it would be to sacrifice
private pleasures to the service of the
state. But to urge that women are vici∣ous
creatures, was not likely to make an
impression on Drusus, who thought that
all women were honest because his wife
was an angel.</P>
<P>SEEING then that our opinions and be∣lief
depend greatly on passion and pre∣possession,
little upon reason, and not at
all upon will, how extravagant is the at∣tempt
to force conviction by rewards
and punishments! Suppose that the law
had taken place prohibiting governors of
provinces to carry their wives along with
them; and that the Emperor had order∣ed
all the world to be of his opinion, un∣der
a grievous penalty. The order pro∣bably
would have produced plenty of dis∣semblers,
but not a single convert. To
make me believe under the terror of pu∣nishment,
that the earth rests upon a huge
<PB N="271" REF="279"/>
elephant, or that an eclipse presages some
dire calamity, is no less absurd than an
endeavour to force a dwarf to be six feet
high, or a negro to have a white com∣plexion.
What then shall be thought of
persecution for difference of opinion in
points of faith? Often in perusing histo∣ries
of persecution, I have started up as
from sleep, and imagined that all the
while I had been dreaming. And yet in
fact that monster Persecution, the off∣spring
of wild bigotry, has shed more
blood than the fiercest wars for power
and glory. Considering that to believe
is not in our power, more than to be hot
or cold, would one imagine it possible,
that by misguided education, a rational
being can be made to believe the most
palpable absurdities, as that bread and
wine, in direct contradiction to our senses,
are flesh and blood; or that an old frail
man becomes infallible, the moment he
is elected a bishop, with a triple crown
<PB N="272" REF="280"/>
on his head; or that gross inconsistencies
affirmed in the creed of St Athanasius,
must be believed under the pain of eter∣nal
damnation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What are we to think of those men who intro∣duced that infernal creed into the Liturgy of the Church of England; and consequently joined with that bigot in devoting to eternal flames every person Jew or Gentile, Turk or Christian, who does not faithfully believe every thing said in it.</NOTE>. Such examples of per∣verse
education, tending to eradicate the
faculty of reason, and to make us blind∣ly
submissive to the crafty and designing,
ought to call forth the most fervent zeal
of parents to have their children proper∣ly
educated. It is not sufficient that they
are taught morality and the rules of con∣duct:
their rational powers ought to be
exercised and fortified, in order to lay a
foundation for proper opinions upon e∣very
subject, and for judging what they
ought to believe, and what they ought
not to believe. What a heavy charge
then lies against those parents, who, in∣stead
<PB N="273" REF="281"/>
of instructing their children in the
principles of reason, the noblest faculty
of man, leave them open to every wrong
impression that may be stamped on the
tender mind, by chance, or by the depra∣vity
of people about them!</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">DIFFERENCES in OPINION make the Ce∣ment
of SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears to me the utmost perversion
of human nature, that people differ∣ing
in opinion, even with respect to reli∣gion,
cannot live peaceably together, not
to say happily. Men join in society for
mutual aid and support; and they sub∣mit
to be governed, because government is
essential to society. But how far does this
submission extend? Surely not to a man's
private thoughts and opinions: these he
<PB N="274" REF="282"/>
may indulge as his reason dictates to him.
The legislature has no concern, provided
he keep them to himself without disturb∣ing
society. Toleration is thus a dictate
of common sense, and as such is now
permitted every where. And yet, the
civil war in France between the Catho∣lics
and Hugonots, was founded upon a
doctrine directly contrary. The Hugo∣nots
pleaded for liberty of conscience:
the Catholics, bitter enemies to it, insisted
that none should be permitted to breathe
the French air who differed from them in
the slightest punctilio. Perusing that hi∣story,
it often occurred to me as a horrid
depravity of temper in human beings, to
devote to destruction one another for a
cause that gives no disturbance at pre∣sent,
and which ought never to have gi∣ven
disturbance. Yet even in France,
persecution raged contrary to the nature
of the people; and carried that great
monarchy to the brink of ruin. Would
<PB N="275" REF="283"/>
one believe, that by vicious education
men can be converted into monsters,
worse than beasts of prey who spare their
own kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is mentioned by Sully in his Memoirs, that on a visit to Madame de Mastin his aunt, she received him very coldly, saying she had disinherited him, because he neither believed in God nor in his saints, and wor∣shipped none but the devil. This was the notion her father confessor had given her of all protestants.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>THIS history suggested the following
thoughts upon uniformity in point of
opinion. Were it even practicable by
persecution or other means to produce
uniformity in opinion; the effect, far
from being desireable, would be dismal.
All nature is full of variety; and the
mind of man corresponds to it, being
prone to variety, and delighting in it:
we feel as in fetters when long con∣fined
to one object. A blended scene of
woods, rivers, plains, mountains, men
walking, cattle grazing, a cottage here,
<PB N="276" REF="284"/>
a steeple there, gives more pleasure than
the sky, the ocean, or any other single
object, however grand. To a well dis∣posed
mind it must be equally entertain∣ing,
to look down as it were from an e∣minence,
upon the various tempers, sen∣timents,
opinions, and pursuits of hu∣man
beings, tending to different ends,
clashing indeed and interfering, but upon
the whole conspiring to the general good.
“Endless differences in temper, in taste,
and in mental faculties, that of reason
in particular, produce necessarily va∣riety
in sentiment and in opinion. Can
God be displeased with such variety,
when it is his own work? He requires
no uniformity except with respect to
an upright mind and clear consciènce,
which are indispensable. Here opens
at the same time an illustrious final
cause. Different features and different
expressions of countenance in the hu∣man
race, not only distinguish one
<PB N="277" REF="285"/>
person from another, but promote so∣ciety,
by aiding us to chuse a friend,
an associate, a partner for life. Diffe∣rences
in opinion and sentiment, have
still more beneficial effects: they rouse
the attention, give exercise to the un∣derstanding,
and sharpen the reason∣ing
faculty. With respect to religion
in particular, perfect uniformity, which
furnishes no subject for thinking nor
for reasoning, would produce languor
in divine worship, and make us sink
into cold indifference<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sketches of the History of Man, Edit. 2. Vol. 4. p. 427.</NOTE>.” Is this a
doctrine that will justify the oceans of
Christian blood that have been shed in
support of it? Saladin, one of the great∣est
men that ever existed, had, even in
the dark age of superstition and bigotry,
very different notions. It is reported of
him, that in his latter-will, he ordered
large sums to be distributed among the
<PB N="278" REF="286"/>
poor, without any distinction of Mahome∣tans,
Jews, or Christians; willing to have
it understood, that all men are brethren,
and that charity ought not to consider
what men believe, but what they suffer.</P>
<P>BUT as the absurdity of expecting uni∣formity
in point of religion stands now
manifest to all the world, I shall confine
my speculation to a more mild subject,
that will raise no indignation nor bad
humour. I begin with asking this simple
question, What comfort would society
afford, and conversation one of its chief
supports, without variety in humour and
sentiment? Language would be useless,
and no uniting tie would remain but of
many hands to procure the necessities of
animal life. Man would degenerate into
a brute—an illustrious effect, worthy to
be enforced by fire and sword! Is this
to copy nature, which diversifies our
minds as much as our faces? What then
<PB N="279" REF="287"/>
shall be thought of those who in com∣pany
are rude to every one who differs
from them? Is such behaviour more ex∣cusable
than to pull every one by the
nose whose face displeases them? I can∣not
illustrate this topic more agreeably
than by a fable from a French author,
which I venture to put into the English
dress. “Four friends there were, linked in
close union. If they differed, it might
be in sentiment, but never in affection.
One was for the fair beauty, another for
the brown: one dealt in prose, another
relished verse. Frequent were their de∣bates,
but all tending to enliven con∣versation.
One day, a favourite topic
was brought upon the carpet. They
took sides, grew keen, their blood was
up, nothing but noise instead of reason.
They parted in bad humour, scarce sen∣sible
of friendship to one another. After
having time to cool, Gentlemen, says
one of them, how happy for friends to
<PB N="280" REF="288"/>
be always of one mind: let us humbly
pray the gods for that blessing. No
sooner said than done. They marched
in a body to the temple of Apollo, and
presented their supplication. The god
inclining his ear, granted their re∣quest;
and in the twinkling of an eye,
they were perfectly unison. One made
an observation; all concurred. One
declared his opinion; the rest gave a
nod. Good, said they! Farewel dis∣putes,
we wish them a good-journey.
But behold! the charm of society has
journeyed with them. No more amu∣sing
conversations, no beautiful reflec∣tions,
no shining thoughts, struck out
by opposition, that enlighten the mind
and chear the heart—Aye, is now the
only word. Friendship subsided, indif∣ference
took its place, and irksome be∣came
the hours that formerly glided
sweetly along. Entire concord dissolved
the union. Let men forbear mending
<PB N="281" REF="289"/>
the works of nature: we are well
enough as we are. Give all men the
same turn of mind, and you take away
the very salt of society. UNIFORMITY
brought furth: to her infant she gave
the name of DISGUST.”</P>
<P>SPECULATIONS like the present have
a tendency to banish every sort of bi∣gotry
in opinion. There are indeed cer∣tain
opinions that ought to be univer∣sal,
because they are grafted on our na∣ture.
I would persecute every opinion
contradictory to the following proposi∣tions,
that there is a Deity to whom we
owe gratitude and worship; and that
there is a right and a wrong in actions,
which ought to regulate the conduct of
every human being. But I would perse∣cute
the opinions only, not the persons
who hold them: they are the objects of
pity, not of persecution. It is not in the
power of man to eradicate his opinions,
<PB N="282" REF="290"/>
more than his feelings or his appetites.
How absurd then is it to punish a man
for what he cannot help? There is not in
science a principle more evident than that
now mentioned, which every man must
assent to when fairly stated. Yet such is
the influence of passion and prejudice, as
to have rendered that principle invisible
for many ages. What rancour, distress,
and bloodshed would have been prevented
even among Christians, had the absurdity
of persecution been displayed to them in
open day light? This doctrine ought to
be carefully instilled into young minds,
hitherto free from bias. Let it be incul∣cated
early into both sexes, that men are
not accountable for their opinions, more
than for their faces; and that a wry opi∣nion,
even in matters of religion, is not the
subject of punishment, more than a wry
shap. It is indeed a sort of Herculean
labour, to eradicate notions that from in∣fancy
have been held fundamental. But
<PB N="283" REF="291"/>
the mind of a child is white paper, ready
to receive any impression, good or bad.
This is the precious time for impressions,
though too early for regular instruction.
Let it not be trifled away, for it never
can be recalled. Good impressions stamp∣ed
on the mind at that early age, sink
deep and never are obliterated. There∣fore,
neglect no opportunity of setting
virtue and vice before your child, in their
proper colours: repeat to it often, that if
it be good, every person will love it; if
naughty, that every person will hate it;
and, in a word, that happiness is the re∣sult
of virtue; misery of vice. Give me
the naming of the tutor, and the pupil
shall partake of the angelic nature, or
of the nature of a beast of prey.</P>
<P>I FINISH with observing historically,
that the art of Printing, among its other
advantages, has had an influence to era∣dicate
persecution, by spreading every
where knowledge and rational principles.
<PB N="284" REF="292"/>
Even those who are the most prone to
persecution, begin to hesitate. Reason,
resuming her sovereign authority, will
banish it altogether. It is true, that
no farther back than the beginning of
the present century, Mr Locke, even by
Protestants, was held grossly heterodox
for maintaining toleration. I am how∣ever
hopeful, that within the next cen∣tury
it will be thought strange, that per∣secution
should have prevailed among
social beings. It will perhaps even be
doubted, whether it ever was seriously
put in practice.</P>

<P>AN officer of the revenue, rich by op∣pression,
had a son and a servant,
intimate companions. They would pass
the live-long day in conversing about
masters and fathers. “Masters now a∣days
<PB N="285" REF="293"/>
are mere Turks, says Martin the
valet, no regard for us; labour into∣lerable,
threatnings, blows; but of
wages, not a word. Do they take us
for unbaptized beasts of burden? All
true, says the son; but, my dear Mar∣tin,
are fathers less hard hearted? In∣cessant
chiding, vexatious admoniti∣ons,
tedious lectures. Can the fools ex∣pect
we should have all the dull gravity
of old age? Does a young man incline
to the army? he is condemned to the
long robe. Crossed he must be in every
inclination, as if the old dotard were
to chuse for him, not he for himself.
No! adds he, there is not a race of men
more intolerable than fathers.” This
was their constant theme. Martin, em∣ployed
in the finances, succeeded, became
a tax-gatherer, had a sumptuous house,
a luxurious table, a grand equipage, and
a nation of valets. The son improved
his father's stock, took a wife, and had
<PB N="286" REF="294"/>
children. Martin, now rich, became a
reputable companion. They continued
good friends. But what was now their
theme? Why, children and servants.
“O the cross of domestics, say Monsieur
Martiniere, (for Martin's name was
now extended a full span), thoughtless
and lazy; threats and blows are in
vain,—thieves, traitors, liars, they eat
our bread and laugh at us to the bar∣gain.
Ah! says the father of the fa∣mily,
talk to me of children, there's
the real cross, good for nothing boy or
girl, no obedience.—We fatigue our∣selves
to death for them; but as to
gratitude, your servant. They long for
our death, watch the instant; and how
happy when relieved of a burden.”</P>
<P>A MAN is a partial judge in his own
cause. Full of his imagined superiority,
he loses sight of what he owes to others.
Fancying himself on a throne, to him all
<PB N="287" REF="295"/>
must bend the knee. A low man rails
at his superiors: he is exalted, loses sight
of what he was, and now rails at him∣self
in his former condition. The poor
never cease wondering at the narrow
views of the opulent, and at their want
of charity. Give them riches, their tone
varies; and now not a syllable but of
the respect due to people of their rank.
When such is the prepossession even of
the lowest classes, can a more sober way of
thinking be expected from those of high
birth? Kings naturally are not more de∣praved
than other men; and but for
self-partiality, it would be difficult to ac∣count
why selfishness is their ruling pas∣sion;
with scarce any sense of justice,
far less of benevolence.</P>
<P>SELF-partiality is the source of mani∣fold
distresses. A man infected with that
disease, never thinks he is treated with
sufficient respect: needs there more to
<PB N="288" REF="296"/>
imbitter his life and to unfit him for
society? peevishness and discontent ren∣der
him miserable, in the very circum∣stances
that make other happy. It was
a problem among the antient sages, why
men commonly are so well satisfied with
themselves, and so little with their con∣dition.
Had they thought of self-par∣tiality,
it would have solved the problem.
A man of that temper never imagines
that his condition equals his merit.</P>
<P>SELF-partiality is difficult to be cured.
It is a distemper that a man sees clearly
in others, never in himself; and one will
not readily submit to a cure who is not
sensible of needing it. The great Cicero
is a mortifying instance of this distem∣per.
He was vain of his consulate, and
exhorts his friend Lucceius, who was
writing the history of Rome, to bestow
the utmost energy of his pen in magni∣fying
his exploits. “Make it,” says he,
<PB N="289" REF="297"/>
“a splended story; for in relating the
transactions of your friend, a deviation
from truth may well be excused.” Did
any man ever betray an appetite for fame
more gross and unjustifiable? Yet in
several of his epistles to Brutus and to
Cato, he declares that he was entirely free
from vanity; and that no other mortal
had less regard to common fame and vul∣gar
applause. A gentleman of a peevish
temper, but to which self-partiality made
him blind, had a small estate in the neigh∣bourhood
of a nobleman who delighted
in hunting. If the chace led the hunters
into his fields, he was impatient and dis∣contented,
even without suffering any
harm. One time, in the bitterness of
wrath, he wrote to the Earl, that there
could not be a greater curse than to be
his neighbour. Urged by debt, he offer∣ed
his estate to sale; and the Earl, to be
free of him, was glad to give the price
demanded, much above the value. But
<PB N="290" REF="298"/>
change of residence did not change his
temper. Every new neighbour appear∣ed
to him worse than all the former.
“Strange!” exclaimed he, “that I can∣not
settle any where without finding a
Lord H—.” <HI>Know thyself,</HI> is a difficult
lesson, especially for a young person who
is not aware of self-partiality. The tu∣tor
ought to apply himself diligently to
correct it in his pupil; assuring him that
of all vices it is the aptest to raise disgust.
Bishop Butler in one of his admirable ser∣mons,
gives the following sagacious lesson:
“Do not pretend,” says he, “that your
friend has any defects; but put him up∣on
thinking what his enemies would say
were they to attack his character. Let
him beware of what he suspects they
would mention as vicious or defective;
not that he is to suppose them in the
right, but that there may be some weak∣ness
there which he ought to guard
against. This is the true way,” adds
<PB N="291" REF="299"/>
the good Bishop, “of making our ene∣mies
contribute to our good.” If even
by such discipline self-partiality cannot
be totally eradicated, it may at least be
concealed. In weighing my own opi∣nion
against that of my opponent, what
if I should rack my invention to discover
what may be urged for him? Frequent
practice may possibly abate my self-par∣tiality.
This lesson is with energy ex∣pressed
in the following golden rule,
“Do as you would be done by.”</P>
<P>PARTIALITY, checked or disguised
when entirely selfish, is allowed full scope
when our country is the object, or our
friends, or our religion. This sort of
partiality is laudable, if it provoke not
our hatred against others. Excited by
partiality to their country, the old Ro∣mans
were flaming patriots. But their
partiality was indulged to an ungene∣rous
excess: they became proud, insolent,
<PB N="292" REF="300"/>
intolerable, holding all other nations as
brutes and barbarians, the Greeks scarce∣ly
excepted. Such partiality is not unjust
only, but inexcusable; being an infallible
symptom of a mean understanding and
of a contracted heart. It must be a bad
frame of mind that sets us at variance
with our fellow creatures, and foments
discord instead of sweetning society.</P>
<P>PARTIALITY is thus a great enemy
to the affection we have for others; but
it is still a greater enemy to the af∣fection
we have for ourselves. Every
enmity we indulge, is to us a real mis∣fortune:
it so far imbitters our chief
fund of happiness, which consists in be∣nevolence
and internal quiet. What then
must he suffer who hates every person
who differs from him in sentiment. Such
is the dismal condition of the bigot in
religion, and factious man in the state,
objects however of pity more than of
aversion.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="301"/>
BENEVOLENCE, the most estimable of
all principles, may by a wrong direction
of our passions, generate malevolence in
abundance. If we be taught to confine
our good will to our connections, and to
hold others at defiance; the man who
has from nature the greatest stock of be∣nevolence,
becomes by that wrong bias
the most zealous clansman, and the most
violent stickler for a party; which in∣flames
his aversion to others in propor∣tion.
Thus the spirit of faction, oppo∣sition,
and enmity, are by wrong educa∣tion
raised and fostered. Pictures of that
kind are far from being rare. Reflect
only on the state of this nation two cen∣turies
ago. The old Roman patriotism,
which comprehended the whole Roman
people, was among us confined to our
tribe or clan. What inveteracy of one
tribe against another! Worse than lions
and tigers, which spare their own kind,
we hunted one another down, and man
<PB N="294" REF="302"/>
became the most formidable enemy of
man.</P>
<P>PEOPLE acquainted with their country∣men
only, are apt to take up a prejudice
against the manners and customs of other
nations; which tends to narrow the spirit
of benevolence, and to lessen their satis∣faction
in the society of their fellow crea∣tures.
Liberal education, and travelling
with a view to instruction, are the only
remedies. An incident recorded by He∣rodotus
sets in a striking light the par∣tiality
of a nation to its own customs.
Darius king of Persia, having an army
composed of different nations, demanded
of his Greek soldiers what bribe would
prevail to make them eat the bodies of
their dead parents, as the Indians did.
It being answered, that nothing should
ever tempt them to commit a crime so
atrocious, the Prince in their presence
demanded of some Indians, what sum
<PB N="295" REF="303"/>
would tempt them to burn the bodies of
their parents after death. The Indians in∣treated
the King to impose upon them any
thing less horrible. That this was rank
prejudice in the Indians, will be acknow∣ledged
by every European. But were the
learned and polished Greeks free from
that taint? We prefer the Greek man∣ners
and customs, which are familiar to
us, as their books make a capital branch
of a learned education. The laying of a
dead body on a funeral pile, appears to
us as natural as the laying of it in the
ground. But let us figure an Egyptian,
who, proud of his own country, never
gave himself the trouble to think of fo∣reign
customs. Embalming was a sacred
rite among that people, in order to pre∣serve
entire the bodies of their ancestors:
the palaces of the dead were little less
sumptuous than of the living. What
notion would an Egyptian have of a
people, whose practice he should be told
<PB N="296" REF="304"/>
it was, to throw their ancestors into the
fire, or to let them rot in the earth? Yet
the sentiment of the simple Indian was
the same. Being ignorant of the art of
embalming, the reverence he had for his
parents, prompted him to give them the
most honourable grave in his power,
which was, to convert them into his own
substance. Brutality or savageness it could
not be, when they expressed such horror
at the Grecian mode. Their reverence
indeed for their parents must have been
excessive, when it was sufficient to over∣balance
the aversion that men as well
as other animals have to feed on their
own species.</P>
<P>IF in this manner, young persons can
be trained to examine with candour the
manners and customs of different nations,
they will find less reason than is common∣ly
thought for preferring their own. Lead
them to reflect that the manners and
<PB N="297" REF="305"/>
customs of nations, depend more on ac∣cident
than on substantial causes. The
following is a ludicrous instance. A
long beard is among us a mark of gra∣vity,
and commands respect; nor is it
without reason that we imagine this to be
a natural impression. Yet in the reign of
Francis I. of France, the grave judges of
the parliament of Paris were obliged to be
close shaven. It was fashionable among
the courtiers and young beaux, to encou∣rage
the beard and to cut it into shapes.
The beard accordingly was at that time a
mark of levity, and therefore inconsistent
with the solemn air of a judge.</P>
<P>As it is difficult to subdue partiality
when it has once got a seat in the mind,
parents and tutors ought to give peculiar
attention, to preserve those under their
care from the infection, noxious to them∣selves,
and noxious to others. Self-par∣tiality
is in particular the parent of opi∣niatrety;
<PB N="298" REF="306"/>
and young persons cannot have
a worse guide, in their commerce with
the world. Let them keep in mind, their
frequent mistakes and frequent change
of sentiment. Candour in acknowledg∣ing
error will gain them friends, more
certainly than the mere negative of never
having erred. Such candour will prevent
many a blush and irksome reflection,
which they are well acquainted with,
who cannot bear ever to be thought in
the wrong. A habit of ingenuity makes
a man a comfortable companion, and
fits him for every enjoyment of social
life.</P>

<HEAD>ART. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ASSOCIATION of IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>AMAN while awake is constantly
thinking. Ideas pass successively in
his mind without a gap or interval, form∣ing
a succession of related thoughts or
ideas, following one another according to
an established law of nature. Our exter∣nal
actions are in a great measure govern∣ed
by this succession, there being an in∣timate
connection between thought and
action. Did our thoughts flow on, with∣out
any mutual relation, and without any
relation to our external actions; we should
be hurried from thought to thought, and
from action to action, entirely at the
mercy of chance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elements of Criticism, chap. 1.</NOTE>. It is of importance
in the education of youth, that this suc∣cession
be preserved entire, free from ill∣sorted
ideas that have originally no rela∣tion.
<PB N="300" REF="308"/>
Any unlucky bias by which un∣related
ideas are conceived to be related,
is sufficient to disturb the regular course
of actions, and to throw all into confu∣sion.
Nature is faithful in displaying to
us things as they exist: our erroneous
conceptions are the result of misguided
education, or of unhappy biasses con∣tracted
during childhood. The harsh
treatment, for example, of a tender boy
by a merciless pedagogue, may produce
an intimate connection between study
and distress, so as to give an aversion to
books, never to be conquered. Inculcate
into a boy that his fate depends on the
motion of the planets: in spite of reason,
he will be addicted to judicial astrology.
There are men who, from some unlucky
impression made on them when children,
are as much afraid of a harmless cat as
of a fierce lion.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="309"/>
ONE of Mr. Locke's most beautiful
chapters is upon association of ideas. He
shows the bad effects that certain ideas
unhappily connected or associated, have
upon the understanding and upon the
affections. “The ideas, he observes, of
goblins and sprights have really no
more to do with darkness than with
light; yet let but a foolish maid in∣culcate
these on the mind of a child
and raise them there together, possibly
he shall never be able to separate them
so long as he lives, but darkness shall
ever after bring with it these frightful
ideas, and they shall be so joined that
he can no more bear the one than the
other.” He proceeds to inform us,
that some such wrong and unnatural
combinations of ideas will be found to
establish the irreconcileable opposition
between different sects of philosophy
and religion. That which thus captivates
reason and leads men of sincerity blind∣fold
<PB N="302" REF="310"/>
from common sense, will, when
examined, be found to be some inde∣pendent
ideas of no alliance to one
another, by education, custom, and the
constant din of their party, so coupled
in their mind that they always appear
together and can be no more separated
than if they were but one idea, and
they operate as if they were so. This
gives sense to jargon, demonstration to
absurdities, and consistency to nonsense,
and is the foundation of the greatest,
I had almost said, of all the errors in
the world.”</P>
<P>ASSOCIATION of ideas is a plentiful
source of speculation. Mr Locke has gi∣ven
a fine opening to the subject of ill
founded associations, and it deserves well
to be prosecuted. It ought to be a chief
concern in the tutor to prevent in his pu∣pil
an association between truth and er∣ror.
Truth is in great danger from such
<PB N="303" REF="311"/>
an association: error cannot for ever
stand its ground against reason; and if
it happen to be detected, the whole
tumbles down together like the cemented
parts of an old fabric. Thus it has fared
with the Christian religion. The minds
of men were more enslaved by the Church
of Rome, than their bodies formerly by
the republic of Rome. Reason was blast∣ed
in the bud; and people, through su∣perstition
and bigotry, were prepared to
embrace every absurdity, as readily as
the most sacred truths. The Romish
Church, taking advantage of this blind∣ness,
sedulously inculcated every doctrine
that tended to aggrandize their Dalai La∣ma.
Its humble disciples made no dif∣ficulty
to swallow, even without a wry
face, the rankest absurdities, direct con∣tradictions
not excepted, of which the
<HI>credo quia impossibile est,</HI> is a notable in∣stance.
When upon the revival of arts
and sciences, the light of reason began to
<PB N="304" REF="312"/>
dawn, and men ventured to think for
themselves, how came it that the Church
of Rome was not apprehensive of its dan∣ger?
It was so accustomed to absolute
authority, as to have no dread of a re∣bellion;
and after whole nations had
thrown off its yoke and proclaimed liber∣ty
of conscience, it was too late to think
of a remedy. So far Christianity was a
gainer. But unhappily, the absurd doc∣trines
grafted on revelation, have led
many well meaning persons to reject it
totally. Opinions associated by educa∣tion
and confirmed by custom, are, as
Mr Locke expresses it, so coupled in the
mind, as not to be separated more than
if they were but one idea. Had the Chri∣stian
Revelation been preserved in its o∣riginal
purity, promulgating immortality
to the world, with a distribution of re∣wards
and punishments in a future state,
I am confident that it would have been
embraced by the wisest and the best men,
<PB N="305" REF="313"/>
and adhered to by all without hesitation,
not even excepting such as may entertain
doubts or scruples about the strength of
the evidence.</P>
<P>To reject the Christian Revelation, is
a sad effect of ill associated opinions;
and yet such association may have a still
worse effect: it may produce vicious prac∣tice,
much less tolerable than erroneous
principles. Many pious teachers asso∣ciate
religion with a rigidity of manners
too strict for any human being. What
are the consequences to be expected from
such an association? Young persons, mi∣serable
under such unnatural restraint, sel∣dom
fail of becoming either hypocrites
or open profligates. Our Saviour says,
“My yoke is easy and my burden light.”
These teachers maintain his yoke to be
galling and his burden heavy. Religion
is given us for our good, and in obeying
its precepts, there is great satisfaction:
<PB N="306" REF="314"/>
such doctrines on the contrary render it
harsh and uncomfortable. Zealous dis∣ciples
of <HI>Law upon Christian perfection</HI> must
be miserable in this life; and if they
break loose from their fetters, they must
be miserable in the life to come.</P>
<P>OPULENCE confessedly, with luxury
and selfishness its concomitants, are the
most obvious causes of the decay of pa∣triotism
in Britain; but they are not the
only causes. An association of repugnant
opinions has contributed to that woful
effect. Above a century ago, passive obe∣dience
and non-resistence to the arbitrary
will of a single person, was a ruling prin∣ciple
in politics: it was substituted to the
love of our country, and was carried to
as ridiculous an extreme as ever chival∣ry
was. Reason at last prevailed, after
much opposition: the absurdity of a
whole nation being slaves to a weak mor∣tal,
remarkable perhaps for no valuable
<PB N="307" REF="315"/>
qualification, became apparent to all. It
was not difficult to foresee the conse∣quence:
down fell the whole fabric, the
sound parts with the infirm. And men
now laugh currently at the absurd noti∣ons
of their forefathers, without thinking
either of being patriots, or of being good
subjects.</P>
<P>THE associations above mentioned, are
but a few of the many that tend to mis∣lead
people from a just way of thinking.
Formerly, this nation was over-run with
imaginary ghosts and apparitions; for
simple people give a ready ear to wonders;
and the more wonderful, the more firm
is their belief. A child in the nursery
listens greedily to a dreadful story. It
believes and trembles; and, if not of a
bold spirit, is domineered by the im∣pression
for life. I could name persons,
whom even the most profound philoso∣phy
has not delivered from the fancied
<PB N="308" REF="316"/>
association of terror with darkness. What
skill then does not the cultivation of the
heart and head require, when after the
ordinary discipline of school and col∣lege,
men of all ranks are found to be
infected with wrong biasses and irre∣gular
associations, which stand firm even
against the most solid reasoning! Let
this consideration actuate those who
preside over the education of youth.
How deep are the impressions, good or
bad, that are made in childhood! As
this is the proper period for impressions,
what have not teachers to answer for
who neglect that period. With respect
to religion in particular, the most impor∣tant
branch of education, it is in the
power of a sensible tutor to instil into
his pupil, notions so just and clear as to
secure him against every hurtful error.
Above all, let it be inculcated, that reli∣gion
is the great support of morality,
that it is our strongest safeguard against
<PB N="309" REF="317"/>
the distresses of life, that it is consistent
with every rational enjoyment; and up∣on
the whole, that its direct tendency
is to make its votaries happy.</P>

<P>ONE evening at Button's coffee-house,
Mr Pope, who was remarkably <HI>crooked,</HI>
and a set of literati, poring over a ma∣nuscript
of the Greek poet Aristophanes,
found a passage they could not under∣stand.
A young officer, who stood by
the fire, begged that he might be per∣mitted
to look at the passage. “Oh!”
says Mr Pope sarcastically, “by all means,
pray satisfy the young gentleman's cu∣riosity.”
The officer, considering a
while, said that there only wanted a note
of interrogation to make the passage in∣telligible.
Piqued at being outdone by
a redcoat, “Pray” says Pope, “what is
a note of interrogation? A note of in∣terrogation,”
replied the youth, “is
<PB N="328" REF="335"/>

delivered his blunderbuss. The gentle∣man,

being the History of his first
Excursion after completing his College-Education.
<DATE>September 1734.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IN my journey through Fife I met with
nothing remarkable, save a good coun∣try
in the state of nature. The bishop∣ric
of Durham is reckoned one of the
finest districts in England. Fife like it,
spreads every where into little green hills
and valleys; but no planting, no inclo∣sing,
poor crops of corn except upon the
coast, and very little grass. The spirit of
improvement, is indeed beginning in that
country; and planting and inclosing will
give it a very fine appearance. Cupar,
the county town, is pleasantly situated on
the banks of the Eden. A bleaching-field
<PB N="350" REF="357"/>
is lately made there, which will promote
the linen manufacture in that country,
hitherto little advanced. In our road
from this town to Dundee, a curious
group of figures struck us, that would be
a good subject for a picture. A little
woman was shearing corn on a little
ridge. Behind her was a boy about eight
or nine, gleaning what fell from her hand.
At the side of the corn stood a cradle with
an infant in it, rocked by a girl younger
than the boy. At some distance a little
cow was tethered, and by it a little dog
lying. I missed nothing of the family
but the little cat, which I suppose was
left at home to guard the little house.
How few are the necessities of nature,
and how easily provided for? May we
not imagine this little woman as content∣ed,
as the great Lord of the manor?</P>
<P>DUNDEE is a trading town, advantage∣ously
situated on the river Tay, two miles
<PB N="351" REF="358"/>
above where it falls into the sea. The
river is there two miles broad and makes
a fine appearance. The town has been
encreasing ever since the Union in the
number of inhabitants and goodness of
the houses. They are now at work about
a town-house, the plan of which they
have from Mr Adams. Though Dundee
is the largest town in Angus, yet Forfar
is the county town. It stands in the great
valley of Strathmore, that runs from Perth
north-east to the sea almost in a straight
line, about fifty miles long, and betwixt
four and five broad; bordered on either
side by hills rising gently on the south
side, and on the north by the famous
Grampians a little more elevated. 'Tis a
beautiful strath or valley adorned with
houses and planting, and intersected with
rivers descending from the hills. Forfar
is a royal burgh, poor indeed, having
little to brag of but its antiquity. King
Malcolm Canmore held his first parlia∣ment
<PB N="352" REF="359"/>
there, and the ruins of his palace
are yet to be seen. The town is situated
at the side of a lake, within which there is
an island where Queen Margaret retired
after her husband Malcolm Canmore's de∣cease.
There is a tradition in the town
of Forfar, that to this queen, canonized
afterward for a saint, we owe the custom
of the grace drink: she established a rule,
that whoever staid till grace was said,
was to be rewarded with a bumper. This
piece of history diverted us and occasion∣ed
some reflections. In the <HI>first</HI> place, it
appears surprising that one should be e∣ternized
for such a trifle. I know not but
this may have been the principal flourish
in the preamble of Queen Margaret's
patent for saintship. But when we ex∣amine
the nature and course of things,
the surprise vanishes. Our nation was
then in its infancy, examples of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
public spirit, devotion, learning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> rare.
Every thing makes a figure in a country
<PB N="353" REF="360"/>
not overlooked with examples of the same
kind. In the next age, it required the
building a church or mortifying an estate
to gain the character of saint, purchased
by our Margaret at so much easier a rate.
In the first ages, men were esteemed he∣roes
for subduing a robber or for kill∣ing
a wild boar. Hercules reigns to this
day for no higher exploits; and in this
country, it is reported that the origin of
Lord Sommerville's family is owing to
the destroying an overgrown worm, the
figure of which animal, and of the chief∣tain
in the act of killing, remain cut in
stone in the old kirk of Linton. Turn
over the lives of the ancient Greek philo∣sophers,
and many of them will be found
eternised for a saying or opinion, for
which a man would not think one jot the
better of his parish minister. Happy are
they who delight in fame, to live in such
ages! The same circumstances of a
people may also explain how the grace
<PB N="354" REF="361"/>
cup, a thing that among us at present
would be but the maggot of a day, should
have grown into a general custom. Scot∣land
being then in its infancy, destitute
of laws, destitute of customs, rude even
in the art of speech, manners and customs
would be easily introduced to fill a va∣cuity;
and when a custom is once intro∣duced,
even upon the slightest foundati∣on,
it continues long in vigour, because
there is nothing to put it out of its place.
A nation advanced to maturity is in a
different condition. Every thing there
being reduced to form and figure, there
is little room left for new customs or
new manners. Here however a distinc∣tion
occurs between customs that gain
strength by habit, and those that are na∣turally
fluctuating such as the fashions of
dress. But at present being not much
inclined to deep speculation, I yield to
nature in her pursuit of more airy game.
And here I observe, that whatever may
<PB N="355" REF="362"/>
be thought of the world turning worse
and worse, the men in those ancient times
have not been more religious than they
are now. Were people bribed to go to
church by a good dinner after sermon,
we should find churches as much crowd∣ed
as ever. In former ages too, it seems
we were satisfied with the form of religi∣on
as well as at present. But what comes
of the ladies all this while; for sure
Queen Margaret was too polite to think
of a bumper as a reward to them. What∣ever
might be done in private, they would
not be inclined to exert their prowess in
public. In drinking-bouts and love-in∣trigues,
they strictly follow the scripture,
not to let their left know what their right
is doing. A lady to whom I was talk∣ing
of this defect in Queen Margaret's
plan, gave me a ready answer. Fix the
men, says she, and no fear of the ladies.
This solution must be acknowledged in∣genious
as well as ingenuous: whether
<PB N="356" REF="363"/>
solid or not the ladies can best tell. For
my part, I would incline to put it upon
a better footing: the women in all ages
have been remarkable for their piety;
and therefore I suppose that this law was
made for the men only: the ladies will
observe decency at least, without a bribe.</P>
<P>WERE I to describe Forfar in the he∣roic
strain, I should say that the inhabi∣tants
are a very hospitable people. En∣tertained
we were by the chief magistrate,
whose doors fly open to all strangers. It
is expected indeed that you leave vails
answerable to your entertainment. If
this ceremony happen to be neglected,
officers of the houshold are in the way,
who modestly take you by the sleeve,
and, out of zeal for your reputation, put
you in mind of your duty.</P>
<P>THE finest thing seen here, is an edi∣fice
of the most perfect model, appearing
<PB N="357" REF="364"/>
to be as sweet a dwelling as one would
wish for. It has been exposed to sale for
years; and yet, which is strange, no pur∣chaser
has been found. 'Tis true, it is
not richly furnished, and riches go a
great way in those days. For my part,
I willingly would have taken a lease of
it, but had not money for the purchase.
This building was not made with hands,
though of human architecture. It passes
by the name of Miss Lyon.</P>
<P>FROM Forfar our company came by
invitation to Gallery, the seat of Mr Ful∣lerton,
a gentleman who made his for∣tune
in the West Indies, and now for
some years has been settled in his native
land, where he passes his time with ease
and chearfulness, free from the hurry of
business and fracas of great towns, which
he says he is heartily tired of. He is in∣deed
an agreeable old man, has a very
good house with fine gardens situated
<PB N="358" REF="365"/>
upon the river of Montrose in Strath∣more.
He diverted us with an incident
that happened lately. He has relations
in the county of Cornwall. One of them,
a young Esquire, made him a visit this
summer, of three or four weeks. The
tender mamma, who had dismal notions
of Scotland, begged her child for God's
sake to return home before the weather
should break, which might be dangerous
in so wild a country. Prepossessed with
this opinion, the young gentleman with
his governor arrived at Gallery. Could
they fail to be surprised with the fineness
of the gardens, variety of the fruits, and
gaiety of the fields? Above all, some o∣range
and almond-trees struck the sage
governor with admiration. An orange-tree
in a pot had by some accident been
left in the kitchen-garden: the grass had
grown up that nothing was seen but the
plant. The curious governor, whom you
may suppose a member of the Royal So∣ciety,
<PB N="359" REF="366"/>
espied this wonder first, and called
upon his pupil to behold. Mr Fullerton,
with a well acted indifference, seemed to
know nothing of the matter, only that
to be sure it had been some seed of the
orange-tree, blown there by the wind,
or accidentally dropt by the gardener.
The man was ravished at the discovery—the
pocket-book was pulled out, day and
place marked with all circumstances.
This possibly may be heard of in the
transactions of the Royal Society. Thus
travellers first impose upon themselves,
and then upon the world.</P>
<P>ABERDEEN at present is one of the
most flourishing towns in the kingdom.
They tell me, that since the memory of
man the inhabitants are doubled. Their
own manufactures are exported annually
to the value of near a hundred thousand
pounds Sterling, which is mostly return∣ed
in specie. The inhabitants of the
<PB N="360" REF="367"/>
shire are an industrious people, man, wife
and child employed. Abundance of good
company in the town itself, a more ho∣spitable
people are no where to be met
with.</P>
<P>EPISCOPACY and the liturgy of the
Church of England prevails much more
here than in the southern parts, and in
proportion gentlemen who are no friends
to the present establishment. However
of late many of them have got over the
scruple of taking oaths, in order to serve
their friends at elections: for we must
not believe that there is any change in
their political principles. To one un∣acquainted
with the world and its man∣ners,
this must appear extremely shocking.
To call God to witness a lie; to promise,
bind myself, in the most positive terms,
when I never intend to perform; what,
it will be said, can be more wicked?
And yet when I look abroad into the
<PB N="361" REF="368"/>
world and find so many gentlemen of
honour acting this part with scarce any
remorse, I am puzzled and cannot help
stopping short to consider, whether after
all this practice be so criminal. If it be,
it is surely the single instance in nature
of a great crime attended with scarce any
remorse or indignation. But this cannot
be. All crimes must give us abhorrence;
and be we ever so well read in Grotius and
Puffendorf, there is no rule given us to
judge of human actions so certain as what
we draw from our own heart. The me∣rit
or demerit of actions is in proportion
to the good or hurt they do. Lying,
swearing falsely, breach of promise, are
criminal as tending to the dissolution of
society, which cannot subsist without
mutual faith and trust among men. This
is what makes treachery so odious a
crime. On the other hand, whatever
words a man uses, yet if it be clearly un∣derstood,
that no faith is intended to be
<PB N="362" REF="369"/>
given or received, they are of no moment.
Thus it is with the common civilities and
compliments passing among men, which
one would be reckoned a fool to depend
on. Thus, to go a little deeper, custom-house
oaths now a-days go for nothing.
Not that the world grows more wicked,
but because no person lays any stress up∣on
them. The duty on French wine is
the same in Scotland and in England.
But as we cannot afford to pay this high
duty, the permission underhand to pay
Spanish duty for French wine, is found
more beneficial to the revenue, than the
rigour of the law. The oath however
must be taken that the wine we import
is Spanish, to entitle us to the ease of the
Spanish duty. Such oaths at first were
highly criminal, because directly a fraud
against the public; but now that the
oath is only exacted for form's sake,
without any faith intended to be given
or received, it becomes very little different
<PB N="363" REF="370"/>
from saying in the way of civility “I
am, Sir, your friend, or your obedient
servant.” And in fact, we every day
see merchants dealing in such oaths whom
no man scruples to rely upon in the most
material affairs. I could wish, that the ta∣king
oaths to the government, when the
heart goes not along, were but as innocent.
So far is plain, that when a man takes
oaths in order to get into power, is trust∣ed,
and betrays his trust, nothing can be
more vitious. But let us suppose he takes
the oaths to preserve his estate, to give
bread to his family, or to serve his friend
at an election who is friendly to the go∣vernment;
how far is this criminal?
We must examine first, how far it was
right in the Parliament to impose such
oaths. This matter ought to be handled
tenderly; yet there is no avoiding enter∣ing
into it. Here the distinction natural∣ly
casts up betwixt a manifest rebellion,
and a civil war occasioned by a contro∣verted
<PB N="364" REF="371"/>
title. Of the last sort, none will
question the Revolution to have been;
and these gentlemen who did, and do
stand out against the Revolution, must be
allowed to be acting against private in∣terest
upon a principle of conscience.
One would think it hard to treat such
gentlemen as common robbers or rebels.
All laws, human and divine, teach us to
treat them with lenity. And indeed in
the main, they are so treated. Yet of
some severities, they have reason to com∣plain.
For example, if they be allowed
the protection of the government, for
what good reason should they not be per∣mitted
to gain a livelihood in any private
way they are capable of? Why may not
a man be an advocate, though it does
not go clearly with his mind, that the
Chevalier is a bastard? This surely is a
hardship; and the people I am talking
of, will be apt to hold the oath of abjura∣tion,
to be rigorous and unjust. If they
<PB N="365" REF="372"/>
bow the head in the house of Rimmon,
they have the Assyrian for their example,
and the prophet for their authority. To
be peaceable subjects without attempting
to disturb the Government, they think
is all that can reasonably be exacted of
them. It must be confessed, there is less
to be said in justification of those who
swallow the oaths, for no better reason
than to assist their friend at an election.
Yet even here, it may be thought, that
such oath, cannot be very criminal where
no harm is done or intended, it being
the same to the Government whether the
one or the other candidate, both of them
friends, be returned. This is a theme I
thought well worthy of consideration. It
lessens our horror to find that our coun∣trymen
are not so criminal as we at first
imagine. If there be any weight in this
apology, it ought to teach all govern∣ments
to be tender in imposing oaths: if
rigorous or unreasonable, they will scarce
<PB N="366" REF="373"/>
answer the end; and their multiplicity
tends to break faith and confidence a∣mong
men. Balancing however ill with
good, it may be a question, whether we
have been great sufferers by the political
oaths imposed since the Revolution. On
the one hand, there is the evil tendency
we have been speaking of: on the other,
these oaths have been useful in making
men better subjects. No honest man, by
whatever motive prevailed on to take the
oaths, but must consider them as some
pledge of his obedience; and it is fact,
that many a one has thus been carried
imperceptibly from his old friends, and
become at last a hearty friend to the pre∣sent
establishment.</P>
<P>THE following adventure happened
lately in Aberdeenshire. Though the
little god of Love has become a domestic
animal, yet his wings are not so much
shortened, but that goose-like, he can now
<PB N="367" REF="374"/>
and then make a short flight. Gordo∣nio,
the ordinary fate of younger bro∣thers,
was left to shift for himself with a
very small patrimony. By great penury
and much industry, he has scraped toge∣ther
about ten thousand pounds. When
about fifty he fell in love; the first time
that any passion had touched his breast,
save that of gain. Where had it lurked
all this while? The young lady was a∣verse,
the man at once became a new
creature. The change was first observed
in his dress and air. The rolled stockings
disappeared, his breeches had buckles
at the knees; and what was a new sight
in Aberdeen, were held up by a large
buckle behind. Fine linen, powdered
wigs, followed of course: the man now
is erect with an open countenance. In
a word, he would not be known to be
the sloven that walked about in a pace
slow and circumspect, his eyes upon the
ground, fear and care imprinted on his
<PB N="368" REF="375"/>
visage. The fort at last surrendered, and
it is computed the siege cost him above
five hundred pounds. What cannot gold
perform? He has been married above a
twelvemonth, and is now the most hos∣pitable
man in Aberdeen. Every body
approves of his taste, his wife being a
chearful and agreeable woman. He is
sparing of nothing but of his words, and
to such a degree, that he still retains an
old bye-word, “All in good time;”
which indeed he has right to appropri∣ate,
the phrase being expressive of his
own fortune. I do not remember a sto∣ry
that comes nearer to that of Cymon
and Iphigenia; only this is within the
bounds of nature. Cymon is represent∣ed
a stupid fool; and yet to fall in love
at first sight, requires no slight degree of
sensibility. But to let that pass, our Cy∣mon
is a strong instance how uncertain
our guesses are about the characters of
men. Fifty years of his life had passed,
<PB N="369" REF="376"/>
when, by accident, he became acquaint∣ed
with the lass that made the first im∣pression
on his heart. Had not this hap∣pened,
he would have jogged on in the
old way, and no mortal have known, nay
not he himself, what sort of a man he is.
Had Oliver Cromwell been much addicted
to music, agriculture, or any trifling a∣musement,
it might have kept him at
home without thinking of overturning
the constitution. Upon such slender
hinges do the greatest events turn.</P>
<P>THE county of Murray, is one of the
finest in the kingdom; in its situation
and climate, very much resembling East
Lothian. Elgin the county-town is beau∣tifully
seated in a plain upon the river
Lossy, which runs into the sea about
four miles below. Its course lies betwixt
two lakes; that of Spenzie on the west,
which covers a great quantity of land;
that of Coats on the east, of a much less
<PB N="370" REF="377"/>
size. The old castle of Duffus, the seat
of the family, is situated in a plain, close
to the lake of Spenzie, formerly a mile
from it. This change was wrought by
several late inundations of the river Los∣sy,
which filling the lake with sand, rais∣ed
the water and made it overspread much
ground. I believe it might be possible
to drain this lake altogether; but belong∣ing
to many proprietors, it is not easy to
make them join in a common measure.
One thing they would lose. A great
quantity of swans come down from the
hills and resort there in winter. Mur∣ray
is a sandy soil, especially toward the
sea. There is a great tract of land east
of the river Findhorn, which in the year
1690, was overblown with sand, and to
this day, has a dismal appearance, occa∣sioned
by a pernicious custom of pulling
bent upon the sand-hills at the shore,
now prohibited by Act of Parliament.
In the road from Innes to Gordonston on
<PB N="371" REF="378"/>
the east side of the river Lossy, for a mile
together, you meet with bare gravel like
what is at the mouth of great rivers: but
every now and then, there are pillars of
sand about seven feet high, with grass a
top. This formerly was all a sandy soil
about seven feet deep above the gravel.
The country people by paring the surface
for covering their houses, laid the sand
open to the wind, which in a few years
overspread a great space of land. But
luckily the wind blowing strongly from
the south-west before the sand was cover∣ed
with grass, the whole was driven into
the sea; and now one will scarce discern
where it has been. Sir Robert Gordon's
estate lies a few miles west from the river
Lossy upon the sea. Such another acci∣dent
some years ago overspread a part of
this estate with sand, particularly a piece
of link ground. The sand rotted the sur∣face
of the links, and the south wind not
only blew the new sand into the sea, but
<PB N="372" REF="379"/>
with it the sand that had formed the
links; and to the surprise of every body,
the ground below was fine soil, and had
actually carried corn, for it was lying in
ridges.</P>
<P>The mosses in this county and in Aber∣deenshire,
furnish the only feuel they
have at home; for there is no coal but
what is brought by sea, nor is there any
wood in the county, at least in the low
parts of it. These mosses are formed by
the rotting of wood; and there is scarce
a moss that has not much wood, not quite
dissolved. Nothing is more evident: and
yet it puzzles me; for by this account
the whole surface of the earth must have
been moss. Berwickshire lies low, and
many parts of it wet. It was once all
wood, which surely was not all cut down
for use. How comes it then, that there
is not the least vestige of moss in the low∣er
<PB N="373" REF="380"/>
part of a county where it was most na∣tural
to expect it?</P>
<P>THE house of Innes is one of the most
commodious old houses in this country.
The ground storey is vaulted. The prin∣cipal
apartment above the vaults, consists
of two grand rooms, one of them forty-eight
feet long; the two storeys above
contain ten well proportioned bed-cham∣bers,
and the house is provided with a
handsome scale stair-case. Over the great
door there is the following inscription,
<HI>Nulli certa domus,</HI> No man's habitation is
certain. Does this inscription show a
spirit of resignation; or can vanity be
discerned lurking under the mask of hu∣mility?
Compare this with the inscrip∣tion
on the standard of the great Saladin.
THIS BLACK SHIRT IS ALL THAT SALA∣DIN
CONQUEROR OF THE EAST SHALL
CARRY TO HIS GRAVE. Sure there was
no vanity here, but an angelic moderati∣on
<PB N="374" REF="381"/>
on preserved amid illustrious victories. It
was a great atchievement of a private gen∣tleman
to build the house of Innes, near
two hundred years ago; and what he
had reason to value himself upon. To
see such an inscription over the little
door of a cottage, would indeed be ludi∣crous;
no less so than what is reported of
a little man elected Provost of Aberdeen,
who, amid the congratulations of his ac∣quaintance,
laid his hand upon his breast,
and declared that after all he was but a
mortal man. Possibly one of an exalted
soul would class the builder of Innes with
the Provost of Aberdeen. For my part, I
should value myself much upon so hand∣some
a performance; and am therefore of
opinion, the inscription is less allied to
vanity than to resignation. In matters of
opinion, there is no fixed standard to judge
by. Our opinions are various like our
temper, because it has great influence on
them.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="382"/>
INVERNESS, 10th October. In this
country a new scene opens which those of
the south know little of. The people here
are generally divided into tribes or clans,
who acknowledge a chief, whom they
more willingly obey than their king. No
safety for a man who would live inde∣pendent:
he is obliged to inlist himself
into one or other clan. A gentleman, in
order to affront a neighbour, stole away
the dead body of a near relation, whom
the neighbour was preparing to bury.
The friends were convened for the burial;
but behold the corpse was gone. This oc∣casioned
a Justiciary trial. The only wit∣nesses
were the criminal's accomplices, all
of them of his own name. They depo∣sed
point blank that none of them had so
much as heard of the thing, till spread all
over the country. No body doubted of
the perjury. I was stunned, and could
not help observing to one of the judges,
<PB N="376" REF="383"/>
that the souls of these people were as
much at their chieftain's devotion, as their
bodies. In a conversation about clanship,
a gentleman of the name of Grant, a
Lieutenant in an independent company,
blundered out his true sentiments, that
he would rather hear of the Grants steal∣ing
three cows, than hearing of one stolen
from them. This is savage, but not so
much as may be imagined. The clans
hate one another, but are remarkably ho∣nest
to those of their own name. And
their mutual depredations are rather to
be considered as reprisals than as theft.
The case here is precisely the same as be∣tween
Scotland and England, before and
for some time after the Union of the two
Crowns. To enliven the conversation, I
took the part of my blunt friend, and
flourished the best I could upon this to∣pic.
The Captain was ravished. I said
further, that the old Romans were all di∣vided
<PB N="377" REF="384"/>
into clans. When I found I was
listened to, my vanity led me to display a
little of my learning. I observed that in
the Roman state, their tribes had like our
clans a common name; that when a tribe
grew numerous, it was divided into what
the Romans called <HI>families;</HI> and in some
of the most populous tribes, the families
were again divided into <HI>stripes</HI> or branches.
In such cases every man had four names:
the first was his proper name, such as <HI>Caius</HI>
or <HI>Lucius,</HI> or Peter or John among us. The
second was the name of the tribe, the
third, of the family, the fourth, of the
branch. I added, that clanship is a great
bulwark against absolute monarchy and
tyrannical government, it being easier to
subdue one man than ten thousand firmly
united by all the ties of blood and friend∣ship.
For that reason, the Roman Em∣perors
never were at rest, till they broke
and dissolved all the clan-connections.
They began with opening the succession
<PB N="378" REF="385"/>
of land to females; and proceeded step
by step, till there remained no traces of
clanship more than now in England or
in the southern counties of Scotland.</P>
<P>REFLECTING afterwards on this con∣versation,
several things occurred to me.
Succession with us has an air of accident
more than of design. We admit female-succession;
and yet none of my mother's
relations can succeed to me. If we fol∣low
nature, why should brothers or si∣sters
be excluded though related only by
the mother? If our views be political,
why not exclude women altogether and
keep estates within the name?</P>
<P>IN this country we see no good ef∣fects
of clanship; constant quarrels and
somewhat like natural antipathy between
clans; and of course entire neglect of
the public. We find nothing similar in the
Roman story, if the struggles be except∣ed
<PB N="379" REF="386"/>
betwixt the Patricians and Plebeians,
which, on the part of the latter, were for
liberty not superiority. How to be ac∣counted
for that the private tribe-combi∣nation
did not in the least impair their pa∣triotism?
As the mind of man is of a li∣mited
capacity, the more regard we have
for one set of men, the less is left to be∣stow
upon others; consequently the af∣fection
a Roman had to bestow upon one
of another tribe could not be great: every
one knows how little regard the Patrici∣ans
and Plebeians had for one another.
As clanship therefore must be unfavour∣able
to patriotism, we cannot sufficiently
admire the Roman method of education,
which supported that noble affection a∣gainst
the undermining influence of the
clan-connection. But now what shall
we say of our family feuds, of which
scarce a footstep among the Romans.
This seems a puzzling question. The
Roman clanship was an union or society
<PB N="380" REF="387"/>
among equals: our clanship, a petty go∣vernment
of subjects united under one
head or chieftain. Here light breaks in.
A society among equals tends to defence
more than offence: a society of subjects
under a common chief, tends to offence
as much as to defence.</P>
<P>WAS the Roman clanship a proper con∣stitution
in a great state? On the one hand,
where one is born a subject of a state so
extensive as scarce to make any connec∣tion
among individuals, he has nothing
but merit and engaging manners to de∣pend
on. The acting a part in the middle
of an unconcerned multitude, is next to
acting in a solitude. On the other hand,
every individual of a clan has the sup∣port
of the whole; and is besides em∣boldened,
by acting in the sight of many
who are concerned in him as friends and
relations, who he knows will take his
part right or wrong. This resolves all
<PB N="381" REF="388"/>
into birth, with little or no regard to
personal merit, which is attended with
every inconvenience that is remarkable
in hereditary nobility.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The reader will judge, whether
this young gentleman had not only
made good use of his time, but had also
been in the practice of a common-place-book,
long before this first excursion.</P>
