<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>EDUCATION, though of great
importance to the public, as
well as to individuals, is no where
carried on in any perfect manner.
Upon the revival of arts and scien∣ces
in Europe, the learned langua∣ges,
being the only inlets to know∣ledge,
occupied almost the whole
time that commonly can be spared
for education. These languages
are and will always be extremely
ornamental; but though they have
become less essential to education
than formerly, yet the same plan
continues without much variation.
We never think of making impro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ments,
because custom and fami∣liarity
hide the defects of the esta∣blished
plan.</P>
<P>THE faculty of reflecting, and
forming general observations, is ca∣pable
<PB N="vi" REF="3"/>
of great improvements by pro∣per
exercise. This branch of educa∣tion,
though capital, is not cultivated
with due care. Nature, in her
course, begins with particulars, and
ascends gradually, to what is general
and abstract. But nature is ill se∣conded
in the ordinary course of e∣ducation.
We are first employed, it
is true, in languages, geography, hi∣story,
natural philosophy, subjects
that deal in particulars. But, at one
bound, we are carried to the most
abstract studies; logics, for exam∣ple,
and metaphysics. These in∣deed
give exercise to the reasoning
faculty; but it will not be said that
they are the best qualified for initia∣ting
a young person in the art of rea∣soning.
Their obscurity and intri∣cacy
unfit them for that office. Here
then is evidently a void, which must
be filled up, if we wish that edu∣cation
should be successful. To im∣prove
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>
the faculty of abstracting,
and gradually to lead us from par∣ticular
facts to general propositions,
the tender mind ought at first to be
exercised in observations of the
simplest kind, such as may easily
be comprehended. To that end,
the subject ought, by all means, to
be familiar; and it ought also to be
agreeable and instructive.</P>
<P>IN the present collection, human
nature is chosen for the subject; be∣cause
it is of all the most familiar,
and not less instructive than familiar.
In this subject there are indeed ma∣ny
intricate parts, that require the
maturest understanding. But this
little essay is confined to the rudi∣ments
of the science, and no maxim
or observation is admitted, but
what is plain, and easily apprehend∣ed.
Apothegms that resolve into a
play of words, which swell every
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>
collection ancient and modern, are
carefully rejected. Witticisms may
be indulged for the sake of recrea∣tion;
but they are improper where
instruction is the aim.</P>
<P>BUT, as said, it is not sufficient
that the subject be familiar and
instructive; it ought also to be a∣greeable,
in order to attract young
minds. Unconnected maxims,
however instructive, will not in
youth be relished without season∣ing;
and as the best seasoning
for such a work, are stories and
fables, a number of them are here
selected with some care. These serve
not only to attract a young reader,
but are in reality the finest illustra∣tions
that can be given of abstract
truths.</P>
<P>FABLES in Aesop's manner tend
no doubt to instruction when they
suggest some moral truth; and ac∣cordingly
<PB N="ix" REF="6"/>
place is here given to such
to them as contain an obvious mo∣ral.
I am however far from think∣ing
such fables the most proper in
the dawn of reason; for to disguise
men under the mask of goats and
bulls, tends to little other purpose
than to obscure the moral instruc∣tion.
Stories, real or invented,
where persons are introduced in their
native appearance, serve much bet∣ter
for illustration; and of such ac∣cordingly
I have not been sparing.</P>
<P>THERE is another reason still
more weighty, for preferring stories
of this kind. If they improve the
understanding, they more eminent∣ly
improve the heart. Incidents
that move the passions make a deep
impression, especially upon young
minds. And where virtue and vice
are delineated, with the consequen∣ces
they naturally produces, such im∣pressions
<PB N="x" REF="7"/>
have a wonderful good ef∣fect;
they confirm us in virtue, and
deter us from vice. This indeed is
the most illustrious branch of edu∣cation;
but as it falls not under the
present plan, I must deny myself the
satisfaction of expatiating upon it.</P>
<P>THIS trifle was compiled with a
private view, and it proved of some
use. But if in any degree useful,
why should it lurk in a corner? It
will be substantially useful, if it but
move others to labour upon the same
plan. Education may well be deem∣ed
one of the capital articles of go∣vernment.
It is intitled to the nur∣sing
care of the legislature; for no
state ever long flourished, where e∣ducation
was neglected. And even
in a private view, not a single
branch of it is below the attention
of the gravest writer.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION
TO THE
ART of THINKING.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Observations tending to ex∣plain
human nature.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Nature of Man.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND through all ages
have been the same: the first
times beheld first the present
vices. Yet who could imagine, that
there is such contrariety even in the same
character? It was Nero, who signing a
sentence against a criminal, wished to
the gods he could not write.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
<MILESTONE N="1"/>Nothing is more common than love
converted into hatred. And we have
seen instances of hatred converted into
love.</P>
<P>If our faces were not alike, we could
not distinguish a man from a beast. If
they were altogether alike, we could
not distinguish one man from another.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Principle of Liberty.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/>So fond of liberty is man, that to re∣strain
him from any thing, however in∣different,
is sufficient to make that thing
an object of desire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Principle of Society.</HEAD>
<P>It is more tolerable to be always alone,
than never to be so.</P>
<P>So prone is man to society, and so
happy in it, that to relish perpetual so∣litude,
one must be an angel or a brute.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/>In a solitary state no creature is more
timid than man; in society none more
bold.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="11"/>
Every one partakes of the honour
that is bestowed upon the worthy.</P>
<P>The number of offenders lessens the
disgrace of the crime; for a common
reproach is no reproach. Hence in po∣pulous
cities, the frequency of adultery,
drunkenness, robbery.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Moral Sense.</HEAD>
<P>No man ever did a designed injury to<MILESTONE N="4"/>
another, without doing a greater to
himself.</P>
<P>Man's chief good is an upright <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd,
which no earthly power can bestow, nor
take from him.</P>
<P>If you should escape the censure of o∣thers,
hope not to escape your own.</P>
<P>No man is thoroughly contemned by
others, but who is first contemned by
himself.</P>
<P>A man is more unhappy in reproach∣ing
himself when guilty, than in being
reproached by others when innocent.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12"/>
The evil I bring upon myself is the
hardest to bear.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5"/>When interest is at variance with con∣science,
any distinction to make them
friends will serve the hollow-hearted.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6"/>Seldom is a man so wicked but he
will endeavour to reconcile, if possible,
his actions with his duty. But such chi∣caning
will not lay his conscience a∣sleep:
it will notwithstanding haunt
him like a ghost, and frighten him out
of his wits.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7"/>In great crimes, the man's own con∣science
proves often to be the strongest
witness against him.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Our powers and faculties are much
limited.</HEAD>
<P>It is a true observation, that no man
ever excelled in two different arts. It
is an certain, there never was a man,
who might not have excelled in some
one art. How is it then that their num∣ber
is so scanty? Plainly from the folly
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
of deeming ourselves capable of every
thing, and of despising what costs us the
least trouble.</P>
<P>We are often mistaken for men of plea∣sure,
because we are not men of busi∣ness;
and for men of business, because
we are not men of pleasure. A great
genius finds leisure for both; an inferior
genius for neither.</P>
<P>Those who have great application to
trifles, have seldom a capacity for mat∣ters
of importance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Pain affects us more than pleasure.</HEAD>
<P>Happiness is less valued when we pos∣sess
it, than when we have lost it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Diffe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent pains compared.</HEAD>
<P>The pains of the mind are harder to
bear than those of the body.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Passion.</HEAD>
<P>A passion that ingrosses the mind,<MILESTONE N="8"/>
leaves no room for any other.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="14"/>
The plainest man animate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with pas∣sion,
affects us more than the greatest
orator without it.</P>
<P>We ought to distrust our passions, e∣ven
when they appear the most reason∣able.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Our opinions are swayed more by
feeling than by argument.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="9"/>Every man esteems his own misfor∣tune
the greatest.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"/>The present misfortune is always
deemed the greatest: And therefore small
causes are sufficient to make a man un∣easy,
when great ones are not in the way.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11"/>That reason which is favourable to our
desires, appears always the best.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="12"/>Change of condition begets new pas∣sions,
and consequently new opinions.</P>
<P>In matters of demonstration, it argues
a weakness of judgment to differ: not
so in matters of opinion; for these are
influenced by affection perhaps more than
by reason. A plain man, sincere and cre∣dulous,
will build upon very weak testi∣mony;
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
while the diffident and suspi∣cious
will scarce be satisfied with the
strongest. It is the province of reason
and experience to correct these ex∣tremes.</P>
<P>Is is idle as well as absurd, to impose<MILESTONE N="13"/>
our opinions upon others. The same
ground of conviction operates differently
on the same man in different circumstan∣ces,
and on different men in the same
circumstances.</P>
<P>A man is no sooner found less guilty<MILESTONE N="14"/>
than expected, but he is concluded more
innocent than he is.</P>
<P>Slight persecution makes converts:<MILESTONE N="15"/>
severe persecution, on the contrary,
hardens the heart against all conviction.</P>
<P>Those who take their opinions upon
trust, are always the most violent.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>We judge of most things by com∣parison.</HEAD>
<P>A man does but faintly relish that fe∣licity
which costs him nothing: Happy
they whom pain leads to pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16"/>
Joy suggests pleasant thoughts, and
grief those that are melancholy.</P>
<P>A new sorrow recalls all the former.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>A man is always in a hurry to de∣fend
his weak side.</HEAD>
<P>It is in some measure pleading guilty,
to be over hasty or solicitous in making
a defence.</P>
<P>He acknowledges the fact, who turns
angry at an aspersion.</P>
<P>Who incessantly vaunts of his probi∣ty
and honour, and swears to gain be∣lief,
has not even the art of counter∣feiting.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Custom.</HEAD>
<P>Men are governed by custom. Not
one of a thousand thinks for himself;
and the few who are emancipated, dare
not act up to their freedom, for fear of
being thought whimsical.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17"/>
Custom is the great leveller. It cor∣rects
the inequality of fortune, by lessen∣ing
equally the pleasures of the prince,
and the pains of the peasant.</P>
<P>Chuse what is the most fit, custom
will make it the most agreeable.</P>
<P>Custom bestows ease and confidence<MILESTONE N="16"/>
even in the middle of dangers.</P>
<P>Our opinions are greatly influenced<MILESTONE N="17"/>
by custom.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Magnanimity.</HEAD>
<P>A great mind will neither give an
affront, nor bear it.</P>
<P>A firm mind becomes rather more in∣flexible<MILESTONE N="18"/>
by poverty. If any thing can
mollify and render it more sociable, it
must be prosperity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Courage.</HEAD>
<P>Who hath not courage to revenge,
will never find generosity to forgive.</P>
<P>Cowards die many times: the valiant
never taste of death but once.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="18"/>
<MILESTONE N="19"/>Hope, is this mixed state of good and
ill, is a blessing from heaven: the gift
of prescience would be a curse.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Fear.</HEAD>
<P>An unknown evil is the most terrible.</P>
<P>Ignorance is the mother of fear, as
well as of admiration. A man intimate∣ly
acquainted with the nature of things,
has seldom occasion to be astonished.</P>
<P>Men of a fearful temper are prone to
suspicion and cruelty.</P>
<P>Fear begets apprehension, the parent
of suspicion; and suspicion begets ha∣tred
and revenge.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20"/>There is scarce a passion but is able to
conquer the fear of death: revenge,
love, ambition, grief, all triumph over
it. Death, then, should be no such ter∣rible
enemy, when it submits to so ma∣ny
conquerors.</P>
<P>He must fear many whom many fear.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>Chearfulness.</HEAD>
<P>A chearful countenance betokens a
good heart.</P>
<P>I love wisdom that is gay and civili∣zed.
Harshness and austerity are unna∣tural,
and therefore to be suspected.</P>
<P>In the chearfulness of life, death is<MILESTONE N="21"/>
the least terrible.</P>
<P>In those gentlemen whom the world
forsooth calls wise and solid, there is
generally either a moroseness that per∣secutes,
or a dulness that tires you. If
the good sense they boast of, happen to
be serviceable to you once in your life,
it is so impertinent as to disturb you e∣very
day.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Modesty.</HEAD>
<P>It is pure hypocisy in a man of qua∣lity
to decline the place due to his rank:
it costs him nothing to take the lowest
seat, when he is sure the highest will be
pressed upon him. Modesty shows
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
greater resignation in those of middle
rank: if they throw themselves among
the croud, if they take up with a disad∣vantageous
situation, they are sure to
remain there; they may be squeezed to
pieces, there is no mortal to take no∣tice
of them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Prudence.</HEAD>
<P>Few accidents are so unhappy but
may be mended by prudence: few so
happy but may be ruined by impru∣dence.</P>
<P>Over-wary prudence is an invin∣cible
obstruction to great and hazardous
exploits.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Candour, Dissimulation.</HEAD>
<P>It betokens as great a soul to be ca∣pable
of owning a fault, as to be inca∣pable
of committing it.</P>
<P>The first step toward vice is to make
a mystery of what is innocent: who∣ever
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
loves to hide, will soon or late have
reason to hide.</P>
<P>Hypocrisy is a homage that vice pays
to virtue.</P>
<P>It is more difficult to dissemble the
sentiments one has, than to feign those
he has not.</P>
<P>It is harder than is commonly thought,
to dissemble with those we despise.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Ambition.</HEAD>
<P>Ambition is one of those passions<MILESTONE N="22"/>
that is never to be satisfied. It swells
gradually with success; and every ac∣quisition
serves but as a spur to further
attempts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Pride.</HEAD>
<P>None are so invincible as your half∣witted
people: they know just enough
to excite their pride, not enough to cure
it.</P>
<P>A proud man is like Nebuchadnezzar:
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
he sets up his image to be worshipped
by all.</P>
<P>A man of merit in place, is never
troublesome by his pride. He is not e∣lated
with the post he fills, because of a
greater he has not, of which he knows
himself worthy.</P>
<P>Anxiety and constraint are the con∣stant
attendants of pride.</P>
<P>The same littleness of soul that makes
a man despise inferiors, and trample on
them, makes him abjectly obsequious to
superiors.</P>
<P>Pride, which raises a man in his own
opinion above his equals, is easily dis∣obliged,
but not easily obliged; favours
from inferiors being conceived as duties,
omissions as crimes. The vain are easi∣ly
obliged, and as easily disobliged. It
is a rare case to meet with one that is
easily obliged, but not easily disobliged;
because few have a less opinion of them∣selves
than they deserve. To those on∣ly
it belongs who are possessed of tho∣rough
good sense, not to be easily ob∣liged
nor easily disobliged.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23"/>
Pride is worse to bear than cruelty.</P>
<P>Pride, more than defect of judgment,
breeds opposition to established princi∣ples.
We chuse rather to lead than to
follow.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Vanity.</HEAD>
<P>Self-conceit is none of the smallest
blessings from heaven.</P>
<P>Vanity, where it makes a man value
himself upon good actions, is no despi∣cable
quality.</P>
<P>The good humour of some, is owing
to an inexhaustible fund of self-conceit.</P>
<P>Flattery is a false coin, which our va∣nity
makes current.</P>
<P>The vain fancy the flatteries of their<MILESTONE N="23"/>
own imagination to be the voice of
fame.</P>
<P>We fancy that we hate flattery, when
we only hate the manner of it.</P>
<P>Generally we speak ill of others, ra∣ther
out of vanity than malice.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
<HEAD>Avarice.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="24"/>Money stimulates avarice, does not
satisfy it.</P>
<P>The miser is a friend to none, but a
bitter enemy to himself.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Affectation.</HEAD>
<P>Men make themselves ridiculous, not
so much by the qualities they have, as
by the affectation of those they have not.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Positiveness.</HEAD>
<P>He who deals in blaming others for
being positive, gives them their revenge,
for they conclude him so.</P>
<P>A dogmatical tone is a sure sign of
ignorance. I am fond to dictate to o∣thers
what I have learnt a moment be∣fore;
and because it is new to me, I
conclude it is so to all the world.
Knowledge thoroughly digested becomes
habitual: the possessor by degrees for∣gets,
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
that things now so familiar were
ever unknown to himself or to others.
The vanity of novelty is gone, and he
talks of the most abstruse points, with
coolness and indifference.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Loquacity.</HEAD>
<P>He generally talks most who has least
to say.</P>
<P>He that says all he knows, will readily
say what he doth not know.</P>
<P>There is who is witty, and instructs
many, and yet is unprofitable to him∣self.
Such is wise in words, but foolish
in deeds.</P>
<P>To say little and perform much, is
the characteristic of a great mind.</P>
<P>As the climbing up of a sandy hill is
to the aged, so is a wife full of words to
a quiet man.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Industry.</HEAD>
<P>A man who gives his children a habit<MILESTONE N="25"/>
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
of industry, provides for them better
than by giving them a stock of money.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Justice and Injustice.</HEAD>
<P>Weighty is the anger of the righte∣ous.</P>
<P>He threatens many who injures one.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Benevolence.</HEAD>
<P>Benevolence is allied to few vices;
selfishness to fewer virtues.</P>
<P>Mistake not the selfish, as if they on∣ly
understood their own interest. On
the contrary, none err more widely
from it. The good-natured man is
the truly selfish. Benevolence procures
a stock of friends and well-wishers, of
greater value than a stock of money.
These will be of constant use and satis∣faction:
many times they bring relief in
pinching necessity, when riches prove
vain and unserviceable.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
<HEAD>Gratitude.</HEAD>
<P>Faith and gratitude are mostly to be
expected from those of your own rank.</P>
<P>To the grateful every favour becomes<MILESTONE N="26"/>
double; the ungrateful lose the single
through the pain of a return.</P>
<P>Wrongs are engraved on marble, be∣nefits
on sand. They are sometimes ac∣knowledged,
rarely requited.</P>
<P>He who complains heavily of favours
with-held, will be ungrateful when they
are bestowed. The man who cannot
distinguish liberality from justice, will
never think himself bound to be grate∣ful.</P>
<P>You may sooner expect a favour from
him who has already done you one, than
from him to whom you have done it.</P>
<P>It is hard to find one that a man of
spirit would be obliged to. For some
men are as sordid in bestowing favours
as in making bargains: they expect pro∣fit
equally from both.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="28"/>
Too great hurry in repaying an obli∣gation
is a species of ingratitude.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Friendship.</HEAD>
<P>Entire friends are like two souls in
one body: they can give or receive no∣thing;
all is common betwixt them.
Cares and good offices do not even me∣rit
to be put to account: names that
denote division and difference, such as,
benefits, obligation, intreaties, thanks,
gratitude, are odious to them.</P>
<P>Something to be wished like home
that is not home, like alone that is not
alone, found in a friend only, or in his
house.</P>
<P>A sordid mind is incapable of friend∣ship.</P>
<P>It is not easy to love those we do not
esteem. It is harder still to love those
who have more merit than we have.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="27"/>The difficulty is not so great to die
for a friend, as to find a friend worth
dying for.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28"/>He who can pride himself upon an ex∣tensive
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
acquaintance, is incapable of
true friendship.</P>
<P>Our good or bad fortune depends<MILESTONE N="29"/>
greatly on the choice we make of our
friends.</P>

As no man intends mischief who fore∣warns

<P>The boldest attempt of friendship is<MILESTONE N="30"/>

<HEAD>Love.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="32"/>Nothing more excites to every thing
noble and generous, than virtuous love.</P>
<P>That love which increases by degrees,
is so like friendship, that it can never be
violent.</P>
<P>When a man has a passion for an ill∣favoured
woman, it must needs be vio∣lent.</P>
<P>Men often go from love to ambition,
but seldom return from ambition to
love.</P>
<P>You may find many women who ne∣ver
were engaged in any gallantry; but
it is rare to find a woman who never was
engaged but in one.</P>
<P>In the first passion, women have com∣monly
an affection for the lover; after∣ward
they love for the pleasure of loving.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31"/>
The beginning of love is in the power
of every one: to put an end to it, in
the power of none.</P>
<P>Absence cools moderate love, but in∣flames
what is violent; just as the wind
blows out a candle, but kindles a fire.</P>
<P>Coldness in friendship has generally a
cause: in love there is commonly no o∣ther
reason for loving no more, than
having loved too much. Decay of love,
as well as its commencement, appear
from the trouble and confusion lovers
are in when left together.</P>
<P>There is no reason for blaming incon∣stancy
as a crime. It is no more in
one's power to love or not to love, than
to be in health or out of order. All
that can be demanded from the fickle is,
to acknowledge their change, and not
to add deceit to inconstancy.</P>
<P>True love is more frequent than true
friendship.</P>
<P>As nice as we are in love, we for∣give<MILESTONE N="33"/>
more faults in that than in friend∣ship.
Expostulations betwixt friends

<P>How comes it that man, so much a

of the world than his own? If by
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
some deity we were commanded to de∣clare
publicly every secret intention of
our hearts, how should we abhor the
dire necessity? Is it that we are more a∣fraid
of an evil reputation, than of an e∣vil
conscience?</P>
<P>We take less pains to be virtuous,
than to persuade the world that we are.</P>
<P>Men are not always averse to disco∣ver
their failings. One complains of
the badness of his memory, satisfied to
give you a hint of his judgment. You
need not be afraid of accusing one for
heedlessness; for his want of attention
to trifles, supposes his application to
be wholly bestowed upon matters of im∣portance.
A man of great genius, for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fied

<P>Who would preserve the admiration

strikes us with dread only while we are
ignorant of its ford, so a man attracts
our veneration only while the bounds of
his ability are undiscovered. It is our
fancy of the vastness of his merit, that
bestows on him esteem and pre-emi∣nence.</P>
<P>It is difficult to possess great fame and
great ease at the same time. Fame, like
fire, is with difficulty kindled, is easily
increased, but dies away if not conti∣nually

every enterprise ought to be a pledge

<P>Seldom would we desire with ardour,

<P>Many lose the relish of what they pos∣sess,<MILESTONE N="49"/>

<P>It is far more easy to suppress the first

<P>Virtue is no enemy to pleasure, gran∣deur,
or glory: her proper office is to
regulate our desires, that we may enjoy
every blessing with moderation, and
lose them without discontent.</P>
<P>In all well-instituted commonwealths,
care has been taken to limit mens pos∣sessions.
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
There are many reasons, and
one in particular which is not often con∣sidered,
that when bounds are set to
our desires by having as much as the laws
will permit, private interest is at an
end, and we have no remaining occupa∣tion
but to take care of the public.</P>
<P>The practice that came to prevail in
Rome, of distributing magistracies with∣out
respect to age, was a wide step to∣wards
the ruin of that commonwealth.
They who in youth tasted to supreme
honours, had nothing left them to de∣sire,
but a continuance of the same for
life. The desire was inflamed by ob∣structions
in the constitution of the

surmounted, but by trampling upon
the laws. The great men went to arms,

<P>It is not what we possess that makes

what we desire. In desiring nothing,
one is just as happy, as he who hath all
conveniencies. How many things may
there be wanting to the greatest prince?
To sleep in health and wake in plenty;
to live in the esteem and affection of e∣very

<P>If you live according to nature, you'll

<P>Adversity borrows its sharpest sting

<P>Those who are the most in love with

<P>Virtue and good behaviour are natu∣rally<MILESTONE N="50"/>

<P>Temperance, by fortifying the mind<MILESTONE N="51"/>

<HEAD>Education.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="52"/>Men commonly owe their virtue or

<P>Plato reproving a young man for
playing at some childish game; You
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
childe me, says the youth, for a trifling
fault. Custom, replied the philoso∣pher,
is no trifle. And, adds Montaigne,
he was in the right; for our vices be∣gin
in infancy.</P>
<P>There is no such fop as my young ma∣ster
of his lady-mother's making. She
blows him up with self-conceit, and
there he stops. She makes a man of
him at twelve, and a boy all his life
after.</P>
<P>To women that have been conversant
in the world, a gardener is a gardener,
and a mason a mason. To those who
have been bred in a retired way, a gar∣dener

And then every thing proves a tempta∣tion
to those who are afraid.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Peculiarities of age and sex.</HEAD>
<P>The young are slaves to novelty, the
old to custom.</P>
<P>No preacher is so successful as time.
It gives a turn of thought to the aged,
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
which it was impossible to inspire while
they were young.</P>
<P>Friendship, love, benevolence, pity,
and all the social passions which figure
in the generous warmth of youth, lose
ground insensibly upon the approach of
age; while the selfish passions are con∣tinually
gaining ground; witness parsi∣mony
in particular. Hence Aristotle
well observes, that friendship among the
old is founded more frequently upon
interest, than upon affection.</P>
<P>The errors of young men are the ruin
of business: the errors of old age have
no worse consequence than to delay or
prevent things from being done.</P>
<P>Unmarried men are the best friends,
the best masters, the best servants, but
not always the best subjects; a wife and
children being hostages to the public.</P>

<HEAD>Government.</HEAD>
<P>However desirable authority may ap∣pear,
yet, considering the weakness of
man, and the intricacies of government,
it is more agreeable to the nature of
most men to follow than to lead. It
gives great ease to have our road traced
out, in which we may walk at leisure,
not burdened with the concerns of o∣thers.</P>
<P>As the councils of a commonwealth
are generally more public than those of
a monarchy; so, generally, they are
more fair and honest.</P>
<P>The conviction of being free, makes
the people easy in a republic, even
where they are more burdened than un∣der
an arbitrary monarch.</P>
<P>A disinterested love for one's country
can only subsist in small republics. This
affection lessens as it is extended; and
in a great state vanisheth.</P>
<P>Cruel laws may depopulate a city,
but will scarce reform it.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="46"/>
It is an observation of Thucydides,
that men are more enraged at an unjust
decree, than at a private act of vio∣lence.</P>
<P>Our imaginary wants, which, in num∣ber,
far exceed the real, arise from
viewing others in a better condition
than ourselves. Hence in a state where
all are equally oppressed without any
respect of persons, we find less dis∣content
and heartburnings, than in a
milder government, where the subjects
are unequally burdened.</P>

<P>There is no other study in the court
of princes, but how to please; because
there a man makes his fortune by ma∣king

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Prejudices and biases founded

<P>WE esteem things according to
their intrinsic merit: it is
strange man should be an exception.
We prize a horse for his strength and
courage, not for his furniture. We
prize a man for his sumptuous palace,
his great train, his vast revenue; yet
these are his furniture, not his mind.</P>
<P>The riches, nay the dress of the speak∣er,
will recommend the most trifling
thoughts: his motions and grimaces
appear of importance. It cannot be,
we think, but that the man who enjoys
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
so many posts and preferments, who is
so haughty and high-spirited, must
know more than the common people.</P>
<P>Let a man of the most moderate parts
be raised to an exalted station, and our
heart comes to be insensibly filled with
awe, distance, and respect. Let him
sink down again among the croud, and
we are surprised what hath become of
his good qualities.</P>
<P>Let not the pomp that surrounds the
great dazzle your understanding. The
prince, so magnificent in the splendor
of a court, appears behind the curtain
but a common man. Irresolution and
care haunt him as much as another, and
fear lays hold of him in the midst of his
guards.</P>
<P>The true conveniencies of life are
common to the king with his meanest
subject. The king's sleep is not sweeter,
nor his appetite better.</P>
<P>A rich man cannot enjoy a sound
mind nor a sound body, without exer∣cise
and abstinence; and yet these are
truly the worst ingredients of poverty.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="49"/>
The pomp which distinguishes the
great man from the mob, defends him
not from the fever nor from grief. Give
a prince all the names of majesty that
are found in a folio dictionary, the first
attack of the gout will make him for∣get
his palace and his guards. If he be
in choler, will his princedom secure
him from turning pale and gnashing his
teeth like a fool? The smallest prick of
a nail, the slightest passion of the soul,
is capable to render insipid the mo∣narchy
of the world.</P>
<P>Leisure and solitude, the most va∣luable
blessings that riches can procure,
are avoided by the opulent; who, weary
of themselves, fly to company and busi∣ness
for relief. Where then lies the ad∣vantage
of riches over poverty?</P>
<P>The great and the little are more up∣on<MILESTONE N="53"/>
a level than they themselves are a∣ware
of: the splendor of the former is
more than compensated by the security
of the latter.</P>
<P>Wisdom is better than riches; ne∣vertheless
<PB N="42" REF="50"/>
the poor man's wisdom is de∣spised,
and his words are not heard.</P>
<P>A civility from a superior is equiva∣lent
to a real service from an equal: how
much, then, is it the interest of the great
to be assable?</P>
<P>The least coldness or incivility from
our betters, makes us hate them. But
they need not be in pain; the first smile
sets all to rights.</P>
<P>Weak mortal! a great man in his pas∣sion
calls your friend a fool. I do not
pretend you should tell him he is mis∣taken,
I only beg you to think so.</P>
<P>To gain a breach, conduct an embas∣sy,
govern a people, are shining actions.
To sell, pay, love, hate, laugh, rejoice,
converse, properly or honestly, to be
firm to a true interest, to be fair and
candid, are things more rare, more dif∣ficult,
and yet less conspicuous.</P>
<P>The virtue of Alexander appears to
me less vigorous than that of Socrates.
Socrates in Alexander's place I can rea∣dily
conceive: Alexander in that of So∣crates
I cannot. Alexander will tell
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
you, he can subdue the world: it was
a greater work in Socrates to fulfill the
whole duties of nature. Worth consists
most, not in great, but in good actions.</P>
<P>We are apt to reckon as nothing the<MILESTONE N="54"/>
virtues of the heart, while we idolize
the talents of the body or mind. One
shall say of himself coldly, and without
thinking to offend modesty, that he is
constant, faithful, honest, grateful;
yet dare not acknowledge that he has
vivacity, or that he has white teeth, or
a good complexion.</P>
<P>Beauty of mind, firmness of soul, dis∣interestedness,
extensive capacity, make
real merit; and yet they are not the
aptest to raise admiration. I have known
an advice given by a man of figure,
which would have proved the ruin of a
great state: I have known a contrary
one followed after mature deliberation,
that proved its preservation, without so
much reputation to the author, as he
would have gained by defeating a party
of six hundred horse. Events of this
kind strike the eye and imagination of
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
every one: good sense and refined po∣licy
are obvious to few, because they
are not discovered but by a train of re∣flection.</P>
<P>Cry to the multitude, There goes a
learned man; every one is struck with
admiration and respect. Cry, There goes
a good man; no mortal regards. We
are curious to know whether he under∣stand
Latin and Greek; but whether he
have become a better man, no body in∣quires.
Yet one should imagine, the
principal end of learning, is not merely
to know, but to know for some end or
purpose.</P>
<P>To how many stupid souls has a cold
silent mien procured the opinion of ca∣pacity?</P>
<P>It is a common failing, that one will
sooner renounce a large sum owing to
him, than give a small sum out of his

<P>Guicciardin observes, that prodiga∣lity
in kings, though accompanied with
avarice and extortion, is more praised,
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
than parsimony, though accompanied
with justice.</P>
<P>Nothing mends a man's character so
much as death. Is it that he grows bet∣ter
toward his latter end? By no means.
But circumstances are changed: emu∣lation
and envy are at an end, and com∣passion
has taken possession. It belongs
to the generous and impartial heart, to
consider others in the same light as if
they were dead. But this is a rule too
severe for the generality: it is much if
one observe it with regard to his com∣panions.</P>
<P>The admiration bestowed on former
times, is the bias of all times: the
golden age never was the present age.</P>
<P>Expectation takes up more joy on
trust than fruition can discharge: it i∣magines
its roses all flower and no
prickle: men always forecount their
wives prudent and their children duti∣ful.
A good unlook'd for is a virgin
happiness; whereas they who obtain
what has been long expected, only mar∣ry
whom they have deflowered.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="54"/>
We part more easily with what we
possess, than with our expectations
of what we wish for; because expecta∣tion
always goes beyond enjoyment.</P>
<P>Things remote, whether in time or
place, make little impression. A small
reward will satisfy a great service long
past. Artful people therefore never
pay beforehand, or while the work is
fresh in memory. The interest of their
money, is not the only thing that is sa∣ved
by such delay.</P>
<P>Report gives more scope to the ima∣gination

<P>The more powerful, though it is he

<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
and glory will soon discover their true
temper.</P>
<P>Unacquaintedness with danger, makes
the fiery brave, the phlegmatic fearful.
This apprehends too much, that too
little.</P>
<P>Some run headlong into danger, be∣cause
they have not courage to wait for
it.</P>
<P>The irresolute never prosecute their
views, so long as they have any excuse
left for delaying.</P>
<P>When it becomes necessary for the ir∣resolute
to act, they feel a great differ∣ence
betwixt inclination and will, be∣twixt
will and resolution, betwixt reso∣lution
and the choice of proper means,
and betwixt this choice and the proceed∣ing
to action.</P>
<P>A man is never entirely ingrossed by
pleasure, who can mix business with it.
He quits and retakes it at will; and in
the use he makes of it, finds a relaxation
of mind, not a dangerous charm to cor∣rupt
him. It is not so with the austere
and rigid; who, whenever by a change
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
of circumstances they taste of volup∣tuousness,
are inchanted with its sweets;
and nature being in them wearied with
hardships and inconveniencies, abandons
itself wholly to delight. They contract
an aversion to the severities of their past
life; what appeared virtuous, now ap∣pears
gross and morose: and the soul,
which imagines itself to be undeceived
of an old error, is inchanted with its new
state.</P>
<P>Some persons are with their friends,
as the generality of women with their
lovers; whatever services you have done
them, they cease to love you when you
cease to please them: disgusted also,
like them, with long acquaintance, they
are fond of the pleasures of a new friend∣ship.</P>
<P>It is a miserable state, to have few
things to desire and many to fear; and
yet that is commonly the much-envied
case of princes. Without desire, the
mind languishes; with fear, it never
can be serene.</P>
<P>The honour received by princes from
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
their dependents, is not true honour;
the respect is paid to the royalty, not to
the man. Grandeur deprives a prince
of the liberal commerce of society: he
sees no face about him without a mask.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="56"/>The parade and ceremony belonging
to the great, are a sad restraint upon
their freedom.</P>
<P>With respect to the opulent, the
greatest pleasures of sense turn disgust∣ful
by excess, or grow languid for want
of difficulty.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="57"/>Men in high prosperity are in a tick∣lish
state; many accidents to disorder
and discompose, few to please.</P>
<P>One would hardly wish for uninter∣rupted
prosperity, when he reflects,
that pride, anger, vain-glory, and de∣traction,
are its ordinary attendants.</P>
<P>The enjoyments of a plentiful fortune,
and the gladness of prosperity, furnish
so much mirth, that it is common to
see an exuberant laugh bestowed upon a
monkey, a dwarf, or upon a cold jest.
But men of inferior fortunes, laugh not
but where there is occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="59"/>
It is folly to trust to the gratitude of
men in high station. What they re∣ceive,
is considered as a service, not a
favour. Nor is this surprising. The
natural intercourse certainly is, that su∣periors
should bestow, and inferiors be
thankful.</P>
<P>It is a showy thing, to build a palace,
lay out a garden, or appoint an equi∣page.
This the great understand, this
they pique themselves upon. But to
fill a heart with joy, restore content to
the afflicted, or relieve the necessitous,
these fall not within the reach of their
five senses; they do not comprehend,
they have no relish for such actions.</P>
<P>Few of us would be less corrupted
than kings are, were we like them beset
with flatterers, and poisoned with that
vermine.</P>
<P>An ancient philosopher observed, that
the sons of princes learned nothing to
purpose but to manage the great horse,
which knows not to flatter, but will as
readily throw the king as the peasant.</P>
<P>Inlist me among the troops of a pri∣vate
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
man, I am Thersites. Place me at
the head of an army, I am Achilles him∣self.</P>
<P>No man ever sought well who had a
halter about his neck.</P>
<P>Admiration is the passion of the vul∣gar,
arising, not from the perfection of
the object, but from the ignorance of
the spectator. The most refined genius
is the most reserved upon that point.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="58"/>Nothing can poison the contentment
of a man who lives by his labour, but to
make him rich.</P>
<P>I have scarce known a peasant that was
troubled with one moment's thought
how he should pass his last hour. Na∣ture
teacheth him not to think of death
before it comes, and then he behaves
with a better grace than Aristotle him∣self,
whom death distressed doubly, in
itself, and in anxious foresight.</P>
<P>Few are able to reflect that they have
been young, and how difficult at that
time it was to preserve temperance or
chastity. They condemn the sallies of
youth, as if they had never tasted of
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
them. It gives them pain another
should possess those pleasures they are
no longer in a capacity to enjoy. It is
a sentiment of envy.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Rules for the conduct of life.</HEAD>
<P>TAke counsel of thine own heart,
for there is none more faithful.</P>
<P>The best practical rule of morality is,
never to do but what you are willing all
the world should know.</P>
<P>Always to prevent our appetites, is
not to gratify them, but to extinguish
them. Abstain that you may enjoy.</P>
<P>Be moderate in your pleasures, that<MILESTONE N="59"/>
your relish for them may continue.</P>
<P>Let same be regarded, but conscience
much more. It is an empty joy to ap∣pear
better than you are, but of the ut∣most
consequence to be what you ought
to be.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="62"/>
We content ourselves with appearing
to be what we are not, instead of en∣deavouring
to be what we appear.</P>
<P>In important actions, we are guided
less by conscience than by glory: and
yet the shortest way to arrive at glory, is
to act upon a principle of conscience.</P>
<P>If it be beneficial to store up ideas of
gardens, buildings, landscapes, how
much more to store up ideas of virtuous
characters and meritorious actions? If
the former tend to serenity, and chear∣fulness
of temper, the latter produce the
same effect, together with one more im∣portant,
that of improving us in virtue.</P>
<P>Before you set your heart upon any
thing, consider whether it give an ad∣ditional
happiness to the possessor.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="60"/>The gratification of our desire, is of∣ten
the worst thing than can befal us.</P>
<P>Examine well the counsel that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alls
in with your desires.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="61"/>Let your conduct be the result of de∣liberation,
never of impatience.</P>
<P>A house had better be too small for a
night, than too large for a year.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="63"/>
The shortest way to be rich, is not by
enlarging our esate, but by contracting
our desires. And to be contented with
a little, takes from our pain rather than
our pleasure.</P>
<P>The safe road to happiness is to limit<MILESTONE N="62"/>
our desires to our fortune, instead of
straining to enlarge our fortune to our
desires.</P>
<P>There is no condition that doth not
sit well upon a wise man. I shall never
quarrel with a philosopher for living in
a palace; but will not excuse him if he
cannot content himself with a cottage.
I shall not be scandalized, to behold him
in the apparel of kings, provided he have
not their ambition. Let Aristippus
possess the riches of Croesus, it matters
not; he will throw them away so soon
as they incommode him. Let Plato sit
down at the table of Dionysius the ty∣rant,
sometimes he will eat nothing but
olives. The sordid meal of the Cynics,
did neither contribute to their tranquil∣lity
nor to their modesty. Pride fol∣lowed
Diogenes into his tub; and there
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
it was he had the presumption to com∣mand
Alexander, the haughtiest of all
men.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="63"/>In the conduct of life, let it be one
great aim, to show that every thing you
do proceeds from yourself, not from
your passions. Chrysippus rewards in
joy, chastises in wrath, doth every thing
in passion. No person stands in awe of
Chrysippus, no person is grateful to
him. Why? Because it is not Chrysip∣pus
that acts, but his passions. We
shun him in wrath as we shun a wild
beast; and this is all the authority he
hath over us.</P>
<P>In correcting a child or a servant, an∣ger
does no good: on the contrary, it
does harm; for it lessens our authority.</P>
<P>Your anger against a servant for theft
has no weight, for you are not less an∣gry
when he neglects to clean a glass.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="64"/>Before you give way to anger, try to
find a reason for not being angry.</P>
<P>A word dropt by chance from your
friend offends your delicacy. Avoid a
hasty reply; and beware of opening
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
your discontent to the first person you
meet. When you are cool, it will va∣nish,
and leave no impression.</P>
<P>Wrath kindles wrath: therefore make
it an indispensable rule, never to utter
a word while you are angry.</P>
<P>To punish in wrath is generally fol∣lowed<MILESTONE N="65"/>
with bitter repentance.</P>
<P>Never indulge revenge to your own<MILESTONE N="66"/>
hurt.</P>
<P>The most subtile revenge is, to over∣look
the offence. The intended affront
recoils, and torments our adversary
with the sting of a disappointment.</P>
<P>It gives fresh vigour to an adversary,<MILESTONE N="67"/>
that he can give you pain. It lays open
your weak side, and shows him where
to direct a second blow.</P>
<P>The most profitable revenge, the most<MILESTONE N="68"/>
rational, and the most pleasant, is, to
make it the interest of the injurious per∣son
not to hurt you a second time.</P>
<P>In prosperity remember adversity, and
in adversity forget not prosperity.</P>
<P>Reflect but on the common lot of hu∣manity,<MILESTONE N="69"/>
and the misfortunes that have
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
befallen others, and you will find your
own not of the first magnitude.</P>
<P>To be always complaining is not the
way to be lamented.</P>
<P>When we sum up the miseries of life,
the grief and vexation bestowed on trifles
make up a great part of the account,
trifles which overlooked or neglected,
are nothing. How shameful such a
weakness? The more shameful that it
is so easily overcome.</P>
<P>By being soured with our misfortunes,
we draw the knot the harder. The true
method is, neither to be obstinately stub∣born
against misfortunes, nor sluggish∣ly
to succumb under them. Let us
leave nature a little to her own work;
she understands it best. We may be
ready to lend a helping hand; but it
will be a difficult task to restrain her al∣together
from her bias.</P>
<P>It is no small step toward tranquilli∣ty,
to accustom our thoughts to the
most agreeable prospects of human life,
and to make the best of misfortunes
when they come, instead of giving way
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
to the uneasiness they bring along.
Scarce any thing is so untoward, but
some good may be drawn from it.</P>
<P>We may learn as much from the faults
of our friends, as from their instructions.</P>
<P>When you descant upon the faults of
others, consider whether you be not
guilty of the same. The best way to
gain knowledge of ourselves, is to con∣vert
the imperfections of others into a
faithful mirror for discovering our own.</P>
<P>Travelling may produce coxcombs;<MILESTONE N="70"/>
but without good sense, attention, and
reflection, will never be of real service.</P>
<P>Labour to unite in thyself the scatter∣ed
perfections of the several nations
thou travellest among. Of one, who
with more application than judgment
frequented a library, and commonly ex∣cerpted
the greatest trifles, it was said,
that he weeded the library. Thus ma∣ny
travellers weed foreign countries,
bringing home German drunkenness,
Spanish pride, French levity, and Ita∣lian
deceit. As for the good herbs,
German industry, Spanish loyalty, French
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>
courtesy, and Italian frugality, these are
left behind.</P>
<P>To let a man into the knowledge of
our passions, is plainly to put ourselves
in his power, and to furnish him with
weapons that will subdue us.</P>
<P>Pride is an excellent quality, provi∣ded
it be concealed from others.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="71"/>Guard your weak side from being
known. If it be attacked, the best way
is to join in the attack.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="72"/>A prudent man will lean more to an∣other's
counsel than to his own. But
he will be aware of the counsel that is
suggested by self-interest.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="73"/>That man cannot fail to be ridiculous,
who follows implicitly every advice that
is given him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="74"/>He should consider often who can
chuse but once.</P>
<P>Let not a run of fortune carry you off
your feet to desert prudence: you may
succeed once and again, but behold the
end.</P>
<P>Francis the First consulting with his
generals how to lead his army over the
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
Alps into Italy, Amaril his fool sprung
from a corner, and advised him to con∣sult
rather how to bring it back.</P>
<P>Time is requisite to bring great pro∣jects
to maturity. Precipitation ruins
the best-contrived plan: patience ripens
the most difficult.</P>
<P>Apply yourself more to acquire know∣ledge
than to show it. Men generally
take great pains to put off the little
sock they have; but they take little
pains to acquire more.</P>
<P>Never quit certainty for hope.<MILESTONE N="75"/></P>
<P>Matters of great importance, and of
very small, ought to be dispatched at
present.</P>
<P>Trust not to others what you can do<MILESTONE N="76"/>
yourself. A man is always careful in his
own affairs.</P>
<P>Rather suffer yourself to be put in the
wrong when you are in the right, than
put yourself in the right when you are
in the wrong.</P>
<P>A man often loses more by defending
his vineyard, than by giving it up.</P>
<P>Lend not to him who is mightier
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
than thyself: if thou dost, count it lost.</P>
<P>He must be imprudent indeed, who
makes his physician his heir.</P>
<P>A wise man will beware of excelling
in trifles. He will be known by them,
at the expence of more valuable talents.</P>
<P>Most men who arrive at greatness,
assume new titles to authorise a new
power. The great art is, to assume
new powers under usual names and ap∣pearances.</P>
<P>A right-turned mind will chuse the
company of free spirits, who frankly
check or control, rather than of those
who are full of distance and deference.
Nothing can be more tiresome, than
fawning persons, who have not, or show
not, any will of their own.</P>
<P>Over-delicacy makes a man seek for
companions that can please him in eve∣ry
thing. It is far better to seek for
things that can please him in every com∣panion.</P>
<P>Avoid evil-doers: in such a society
the virtuous at last become almost a∣shamed
of themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="71"/>
Company is extremely infectious:
there is no medium; we must imitate
vices, or abhor them.</P>
<P>Dangerous it is to contract familiari∣ty
with persons of a perverse mind, or
false heart. Behave to them with re∣serve,
as to entire strangers, and you
will shun a multitude of rocks, in your
voyage through life.</P>
<P>Shun the proud and arrogant; but
without letting them perceive it; other∣wise
you provoke dangerous enemies.</P>
<P>Listen not to all that is spoke, lest
thou hear thy servant curse thee, says
Solomon. It is scarce credible what
uneasiness is created in life by an useless
curiosity, as when we pry into secrets
that are better unknown. Could we
procure some magic glass, wherein to
view all that malice which is in any way
at work against us, it were better to break
it than to use it. Curiosity loads the
mind with suspicion, a violent enemy to
prudent conduct, rendering it unsteady
and perplexed. It also frequently rivets
evils that otherwise would have blown
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
over. For it is dangerous to provoke
the consciences of men, who, so long as
they think themselves concealed, are ea∣sily
changed for the better; but if once
discovered, become irreconcileable. It
was esteemed consummate prudence in
Pompey, to burn all the papers of Serto∣rius,
without casting a single glance up∣on
them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="77"/>If you will preserve tranquillity, banish
tale-bearers and slanderers. Be not in∣quisitive
about what others say of you,
nor into the mistakes of your friends.
For this is to gather sticks to burn your
own house.</P>
<P>Were there none that listen to tales,
there would be no tale-bearer.</P>
<P>An angry vindication against an un∣kind
or unjust aspersion tends to spread
the calumny; because he who is in the
wrong is the aptest to be angry. Calm∣ness
is strong symptom of innocence.</P>
<P>Common reports, if ridiculous ra∣ther
than dangerous, are best confuted
by neglect. Seriously and sudiously to
endeavour a confutation, gives suspi∣cion
<PB N="65" REF="73"/>
that there may be somewhat at bot∣tom.
Fame hath much of the scold:
the best way to silence her, is to be silent
yourself: she will soon be out of breath
with blowing her own trumpet.</P>
<P>Contempt is the best return to scur∣rility.<MILESTONE N="78"/></P>
<P>Shut your ears equally against the man
who flatters you, or condemns others,
without reason.</P>
<P>Be aware of whoredome before father
or mother, of lying before the prince,
of unrighteousness before the judge, of
offence before the congregation, of un∣faithfulness
before a friend, and of theft
before a neighbour.</P>
<P>There are matters that in decency
ought never to be exposed bare-faced.
Necessity often pardons stretches in ac∣tion,
but words can never be necessary.
The world will excuse us for doing an
action, when it will not excuse us for
justifying it.</P>
<P>Vaunt not of the favours you bestow:
leave this to the receiver, whose ac∣knowledgments
will be the best test of
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
your generosity, and of his gratitude.</P>
<P>If you would teach secrecy to any
one, begin with yourself. How can you
expect another will keep your secret,
when you yourself cannot?</P>
<P>The closness of the heart in matters
of importance, is best concealed by an
openness in trifles.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="79"/>An inflexible temper has much to suf∣fer
and little to gain.</P>
<P>Never dispute for victory, but for in∣struction;
and yield to reason from
whomever it comes.</P>
<P>Never suffer your courage to exert it∣self
in fierceness, your resolution in ob∣stinacy,
your wisdom in cunning, nor
your patience in fullenness.</P>
<P>Prosecute not a coward too far, lest
you make him turn violent to your de∣struction.</P>
<P>Great and bold undertakings are dan∣gerous
to the adviser: he must lay his
account, either with the anger or the
envy of his prince.</P>
<P>If the spirit of the ruler rise up against
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
thee, leave thy place; for yielding paci∣fieth
great offences.</P>
<P>Press not upon the mighty, lest thou
be shut out: but go not far off, lest he
forget thee.</P>
<P>Solid merit is a cure for ambition it∣self.
A man of this character, aiming
at great things, cannot confine his am∣bition
to riches, preferments, fortune,
or favour. He finds nothing solid in
these to fill his heart, or to deserve at∣tention.
His great ambition would be,
to merit that sort of glory which arises
from pure and disinterested virtue. But
this is not understood among men, and
he gives it up.</P>
<P>Instead of looking down with con∣tempt
upon the crooked in mind or
body, we should with thankfulness look
up to God who hath made us better.</P>
<P>Be reserved in discourse; it may be of
great advantage, and never can be hurt∣ful.</P>
<P>A man's fortune is oftener made by his
tongue than by his virtues, and oftener
overthrown by it than by his vices.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="76"/>
Curse not the king, no not in thy
thought, nor the rich in thy bedchamber;
for a bird in the air shall carry the voice.</P>
<P>Speak contemptuously of none at or∣dinaries,
nor at public meetings; lest
some friend there, force you to a base re∣cantation,
or engage you in an indiscreet
quarrel.</P>
<P>Let it be a defect to speak favourably
of all sorts of people; it is, however,
what one would not change for some
virtues. It is agreeable, it is prudent,
being the surest way to guard against
the obloquy of others.</P>
<P>Speak not ill of an enemy; it will
be ascribed to prejudice, not truth.</P>
<P>Violent love is the worst of all rea∣sons
for marriage: a couple who have
no better reasons for uniting, seldom
continue long happy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="80"/>He will probably find a good wife,
who seeks nothing else.</P>
<P>An unquiet life betwixt man and wife,
lessens both in the esteem of others.</P>
<P>Equal matches are generally the most
happy.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="81"/>If it be your purpose to bring a man
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>
over to your side, try to bride his incli∣nations.</P>
<P>If you will deal with a man, you must
know his temper, and so lead him; or
his ends, and so persuade him; or those
he is attached to, and so govern him.</P>
<P>All are idolaters, some of glory, some
of interest, some of love: the art is to
find out the idol. This is the master∣key
to the heart; it gives easy entrance,
and of consequence absolute possession.</P>
<P>The most artful way of leading others,
is to put on a shew of being led by them.
The celebrated Hambden was so civil, so
modest, so humble, that he seemed to have
no opinion but what he derived from
others. By this means he had a won∣derful
art of governing men, and of lead∣ing
them into his principles and views;
whilst they believed that he wholly de∣pended
on them.</P>
<P>To show precipices on all sides, is the
best means to bring weak persons into
your path.</P>
<P>We engage others more effectually by
promises than presents. While men are
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
kept in dependence, they strive to me∣rit
favour.</P>
<P>The fear of not saying enough to per∣suade,
makes many say too much to be
believed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="82"/>Where a man naturally generous and
candid, has been tempted to neglect
his duty, or to do any wrong; if you
would reform him, the most effectual
method is, to conceal the fault.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="83"/>A slave may be subdued by terror;
but the only method for reclaiming an
equal, is affability and complaisance.</P>
<P>For a trifling benefit to yourself, ne∣ver
offend another. To be kind to o∣thers,
will afford you more satisfaction.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="84"/>Abstain from injuring others, if you
wish to be in safety yourself.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="85"/>Beware of giving provocation, for
the strongest are not always secure a∣gainst
the weakest.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="86"/>It is inhuman to make sport of what
is destructive to others.</P>
<P>To measure all reason by our own, is
a plain act of injustice: it is an incroach∣ment
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
upon the common rights of man∣kind.</P>
<P>Do always what you yourself think<MILESTONE N="87"/>
right, and let others enjoy the same pri∣vilege.
The latter is a duty you owe to
your neighbour; the former, as well as
the latter, are duties you owe to your
maker.</P>
<P>Difference in opinion is the very salt<MILESTONE N="88"/>
of conversation; and is not less natural
than difference in look. Why then
should we be offended at those who
think differently from us?</P>
<P>The first ingredient in conversation is
truth; the next, good sense; the third,
good humour; the last, wit.</P>
<P>The best method to succeed in con∣versation,
is, to admire little, to hear
much, to seem distrustful of your own
reason, but to set that of others in the
fullest light.</P>
<P>Let thy discourse appear rather as ea∣sily
drawn, then fondly issuing from
thee; that thou mayst not betray thy
weakness to hold, nor inclination to
talk, but desire to gratify thy friends.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="80"/>
To be an Englishman in London, a
Frenchman in Paris, a Spaniard in Ma∣drid,
is no easy matter; and yet it is
necessary.</P>
<P>A man entirely without ceremony,
had need of great merit in place of it.</P>
<P>From equals one is in danger of too
great familiarity, and therefore it is
good to keep some state; from inferiors
one shall be sure of respect, and there∣fore
it is good to be somewhat familiar.</P>
<P>In seconding another, it is good to
add somewhat of your own. If you ap∣prove
his opinion, let it be with a dis∣tinction;
if you follow his counsel, let
it be with alledging farther reasons. In
this way you will preserve both your su∣periority,

<P>He who restrains himself, and gives o∣thers
liberty, will always pass for a well∣bred

<P>Subdue the restless temper that leads

He who cannot bear a jest ought ne∣ver<MILESTONE N="89"/>

<P>With respect to our equals, it is less

<P>All the world is plagued with cold

<P>To make another's wit appear more

<P>The great error in conversation is,
that most men are fonder of speaking,
than of hearing. Few show more com∣plaisance
than barely to pretend to hear∣ken,
whilst their eyes and minds are ro∣ving
from what is said, to what they
themselves would say; not considering,
that to seek one's own pleasure so pas∣sionately,
can never be the way to please

<P>To be complaisant to the lowest, is

<P>Nothing so nauseous as undistinguish∣ed

<P>That firmness of mind and modera∣tion
of temper, so praise-worthy in those

we are, as to think ourselves privi∣leged,
upon all occasions, to burden
our friends with our misfortunes.</P>
<P>We ought to look upon our own pos∣sessions

<P>Put a plain coat upon a poor man's

<P>Benefits too loosely bestowed, and

<P>True liberality consists, not so much
in giving largely, as in giving season∣ably.</P>
<P>Give less than is expected! rather

<P>Better not to accuse, than to suffer

<P>The worst actions appear not so ugly,
as disguising and dissembling them will
be. In confession, every one is circum∣spect:
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>
but the circumspection is ill pla∣ced;
it ought to be in action. A habit
of sincerity in acknowledging faults,
will be a good guard against commit∣ting
what one is ashamed to acknow∣ledge.</P>
<P>One must be acquainted with his fail∣ings,
before he can think of a remedy;
and concealing them from others, is a
step towards concealing them from our∣selves.</P>
<P>Solicitude in hiding failings, makes
them appear the greater. It is a safer
and easier course, frankly to acknow∣ledge
them. A man owns that he is
ignorant: we admire his modesty, and
cannot imagine that he is deficient in
knowledge. He says he is old; we
scarce think him so. He declares him∣self
poor; we cannot believe that he
has just nothing at all.</P>
<P>Some promise through shame, and
get an enemy for nought.</P>
<P>Let it be your chief object in life, to<MILESTONE N="95"/>
gain a sincere friend; for friendly sym∣pathy
<PB N="78" REF="86"/>
inflames every joy, and softens
every affliction.</P>
<P>No man continues long to respect his
friends and benefactors, who allows him∣self
freely to talk of their faults.</P>
<P>It is fit to know the vices of your
friend, but not to hate them.</P>
<P>The nature of man is such, that it is
not possible to avoid all occasions of
complaint and discontent among rela∣tions
and neighbours. How are we to
behave when the seeds of discord are
sown? We must learn to bear and
forbear, by calling to mind, that if a
relation has his failings, we are not en∣tirely
exempt.</P>
<P>You are a fool! You dream! and
such like, are expressions one may easi∣ly
bear from his friends. Among free
spirits, I love freedom: let the words
go to the full length of the thought.
In a manly society, familiarity is agree∣able,
because it hath nothing effeminate
nor ceremonious.</P>
<P>By all means shun to judge in a con∣troversy
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>
betwixt two of your own
friends.</P>
<P>Nothing tends more to unfaithful∣ness,<MILESTONE N="96"/>
than distrust: to doubt a friend,
is to lose him. Believe a man honest,
and you make him so.</P>
<P>If a man be forced to break off a
friendship, he ought to withdraw insen∣sibly,
and without noise.</P>
<P>Beware equally of rash blame and rash
praise.</P>
<P>If we would honour merit, we must<MILESTONE N="97"/>
not judge by appearances.</P>
<P>To praise one's friend aloud, rising
early, has the same effect as cursing him,
says Solomon. Moderate and seasonable
praise, dropt occasionally, is of great
service to the reputation and fortunes
of men: immoderate, noisy, and ful∣some
panegyric, rather doth harm.</P>
<P>A man of thorough integrity will<MILESTONE N="98"/>
never listen to any reason against con∣science.</P>
<P>It was a saying of Socrates, That we

<P><MILESTONE N="100"/>THE pleasures of parental fondness
make large amends for all its an∣xieties.</P>
<P>A good-natured man has the whole
world to be happy in. Whatever good
befalls his species, a worthy man ad∣vanced,
a modest man encouraged, the
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>
indigent relieved, all these he looks up∣on
as remoter blessings to himself.
Providence makes him amends for the
narrowness of his fortune, by doing for
him, what he himself would do in
power and riches.</P>
<P>Civility is not so slight a matter as it
is commonly thought: it is a duty we
owe to others as well as to ourselves;
for how unjust is it to distress a person
who merits no punishment?</P>
<P>Without good-breeding a court would
be the seat of violence and desolation.
There all the passions are in fermenta∣tion,
because all pursue what but few
can obtain: there, if enemies did not
embrace, they would stab: there smiles
are often put on to conceal tears:
there, mutual services are professed
while mutual injuries are intended:
and there, the guile of the serpent si∣mulates
the gentleness of the dove. To
what a degree must good-breeding ad∣orn
the beauty of truth, when it can
thus soften the deformity of falsehood?</P>
<P>There are three stages of life; the
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
present, the past, and the future. The
present is momentary, the future dubi∣ous,
the past only certain. It is lost to
the busy, who have no time to look
back; and to the wicked, who have no
inclination. That man must keep a
strict watch over his actions, who pro∣poses
pleasure in reflection. He who
indulges the thirst of ambition, the stub∣bornness
of pride, the savageness of con∣quest,
the shame of deceit, the misery
of avarice, and the bitterness of prodi∣gality,
must for ever be an enemy to
memory. The past, no longer in the
power of fortune, is, to the virtuous
only, a constant source of enjoyment.
What satisfaction, in looking back with
approbation! what uneasiness, in look∣ing
back with shame and remorse! This,
above every consideration, establishes
the preference of virtue, and sets it at
an infinite distance from vice. Let us
consider every good action, as adding to
a stock that will support us for a life∣time,
in chearfulness and good humour;
a stock that may be liberally used, with∣out
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>
our diminution. Let us consider every
vicious action, as contracting a debt be∣yond
our power of paying, and which,
therefore, will distress us for ever.</P>
<P>To place religion entirely on the ob∣servance<MILESTONE N="101"/>
of rites of rites and ceremonies, is the
very essence of superstition.</P>
<P>A wicked man cannot have any true
love or esteem for himself. The sense
of his depravity must disgust him.</P>
<P>Light is not less favourable to merit,<MILESTONE N="102"/>
than unfavourable to imposture.</P>
<P>None but the virtuous dare hope in
bad circumstances.</P>
<P>You have obliged a man: very well!
what would you have more? Is not the
consciousness of doing good a sufficient
reward?</P>
<P>Pleasures, unless wholly innocent, ne∣ver
continue so long as the sting they
leave behind them.</P>
<P>In a just account of profit and loss,
an unlawful gain is a greater misfortune
than a real loss. This is but once felt;
that scarce ever wears out, but is the
source of continual affliction.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="92"/>
Usurpers and tyrants generally do ju∣stice
upon themselves for the injuries
they do others. Conscience performs
the office of the executioner, punishing
their public crimes by private remorse,
and by tormenting them with never∣ceasing
fears and jealousies.</P>
<P>The ungrateful rejoice but once in
the favours they receive; the grateful
always. Compare their lives: the one
is sad, and solicitous, as a deceiver, and
breaker of faith; the other chearful and
open, pleased with the favour, more
pleased when he makes the return.</P>
<P>Though ingratitude may escape courts
of law, don't think it escapes punish∣ment.
What punishment can be more
severe than public hatred, and private
remorse? Stung with the conscious∣ness
of the sneaking vice, he dares ac∣cept
a benefit from none, dares bestow
it upon none, is pointed at by all, or
believes himself to be.</P>

proceed from the same stock? Did not
those riches once belong to their com∣mon

suppose a small pittance would be
refused to any of their descendents?
Could they imagine, any of their heirs

but behold it remains unshaken.</P>
<P>Of our short lives, how short a space
do we live? The temper that leads to
put great weight upon trifles, and con∣sequently
to raise great trouble and ve∣xation
out of nothing, is the chief ingre∣dient
of that bitter mixture which
makes life unhappy.</P>
<P>Folly is a bad quality; but never to

<P>An ingenuous confession stands in the

<P>Chuse ever the plainest road, it al∣ways

chuse ever to do and say what is
the most just, and the most direct. This
conduct will save a thousand blushes,
and a thousand struggles, and will deli∣ver
you from those secret torments
which are the never-failing attendants
of dissimulation.</P>
<P>A thorough dissimulation is the so∣rest
task a man can undertake, where
the passions to be hid are, malice, ha∣tred,
or revenge; which, like savage
beasts, are continually breaking their
chains, to the destruction of their keep∣er.
What anxiety and torture is the
lot of the deep dissembler, who, to
secure a pitiful revenge, forces his
temper to caress and fawn upon his bit∣ter

that of the Lacedemonian youth, who,
to save a discovery, suffered the fox to
eat into his bowels. Pity it were, that

to commit this violence upon na∣ture,
for the ruin of an enemy? Don't
we give him too great advantage over
us, when we sacrifice the repose of our
lives, only to do him a mischief? To
get rid of an enemy; it is, believe me,
a more refined stratagem, to get rid of
the passion that makes him our enemy.
Let us throw the fox out of our bosom;
for in this case, there is neither shame
nor danger in the discovery.</P>
<P>Envy and wrath shorten life; and an∣xiety<MILESTONE N="111"/>

<P>To have your enemy in your power,
and yet to do him good, is the greatest

<P>Wounds may be bound up, and words
forgiven; but he who betrays the se∣crets
of his friend, loses all credit.</P>
<P>Modesty, were it to be recommend∣ed
for nothing else, leaves a man at ease,
by pretending to little: whereas vain∣glory
<PB N="92" REF="100"/>
requires perpetual labour to ap∣pear
what one is not. If we have sense,
modesty best sets it off; if not, best
hides the want.</P>
<P>That man will never be proud, who
considers his own imperfections, and
those of human nature.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="112"/>Humour that is forced against the na∣tural
bent of temper, must be ridicu∣lous.
If we follow nature, our best

But so prevalent is vanity, and the apish
humour of imitation, that we never

<P>AT the siege of Namur by the al∣lies,
there were in the ranks of
the company commanded by
Captain Pincent, in Colonel Frederick
Hamilton's regiment, one Unnion, a
corporal, and one Valentine a private
centinel: there happened between these
two men a dispute about a matter of
love, which, upon some aggravations,
grew to an irreconcileable hatred. Un∣nion
being the officer of Valentine,
took all opportunities even to strike his
rival, and profess the spite and revenge
which moved him to it. The centinel
bore it without resistance; but fre∣quently
said he would die to be reven∣ged
of that tyrant. They had spent
whole months thus, one injuring, the o∣ther
complaining; when in the midst of
this rage towards each other, they were
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
commanded upon the attack of the ca∣stle;
where the corporal received a
shot in the thigh, and fell. The French
pressing on, and he expecting to be
trampled to death, called out to his e∣nemy,
Ah, Valentine! can you leave
me here? Valentine immediately ran
back, and in the midst of a thick fire of
the French, took the corporal upon his
back, and brought him through all that
danger as far as the abbey of Salsine,
where a cannon-ball took off his head:
his body fell under his enemy whom he
was carrying off. Unnion immediate∣ly

preached to others. But now, my jew∣el,

wife, ravished with his good humour,
flew to the cellar. But alas, the barrel
was staved, and quite empty. What
should she do? There was no hiding.
My dear, said she, with despair in her

avail, when the hour of temp∣tation

his death, contemning the youth and
inexperience of Alexander; but that
the repeated news of his victories drove

them to the other extreme, and inspired
them with terror, not more bounded
than their contempt had been formerly.

<P>It must appear singular, that the Pa∣risians,
an immense body of people,

with such hatred against their lawful
sovereign, as to suffer, with patience,
the utmost distresses in the long siege
they endured <HI>anno</HI> 1590. Vast num∣bers
died of famine, and the dead be∣came
the ordinary food of the living.
Davila informs us, that it was a com∣mon
practice among the German soldiers
who guarded the town, to kill children
and eat them. And yet, during that
severe persecution, not a whisper of
yielding, though they were offered all
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
security for their religion. The Duke
of Parma raised the siege; and after his
return to Flanders, the siege was con∣verted
into a blockade, which prevent∣ing
any regular supplies, reduced the
Parisians to considerable straits, though
far from what they had formerly suffer∣ed.
It was during this time of mode∣rate
persecution, that they lost courage,
became impatient, and were willing to
submit upon any reasonable terms.
When the town was vigorously attack∣ed,
the inhabitants were not less vigo∣rous
in its defence, and their obstinacy
was inflamed by bigotry, and hatred to
the Reformed religion. During the
blockade, being suffered to live idle,
they had nothing to animate their op∣position;
and as in the interval betwixt
the siege and the blockade, they had ta∣sted
of plenty, they could not think
without abhorrence upon their former
miseries.</P>

Christian, and a virgin; and that she
abhorred more than death the debauch∣eries
of his seraglio, and the impoisoned
smoothness of his promises. All means
were used in vain to gain her. Magni∣ficent
habits, costly jewels, were reject∣ed
with disdain. Mahomet irritated
with unexpected resistance, fell from
love to hatred, and cut off her head in

<P>A solemn owl, puffed up with vanity,
sat repeating her screams at midnight
from the hollow of a blasted oak. And
wherefore, says she, this awful silence,
unless it be to favour my superior me∣lody?
Surely the groves are hushed in
expectation of my voice, and when I
sing all nature listens. An echo resound∣ing
from an adjacent rock, replied,
“All nature listens.” The nightingale,
resumed she, has usurped the sovereign∣ty
by night: her note indeed is musical,
but mine is sweeter far. The echo re∣plied
again, “Sweeter far.” Why,
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>
then, am I diffident, continued she, to
join the tuneful choir? The echo re∣peated,
“Join the tuneful choir.”
Roused by this shadow of approbation,
she mingled her hootings with the har∣mony
of the grove. But the tuneful
songsters, disgusted with her noise, and
affronted with her impudence, unani∣mously
drove her from their society.</P>

what is needful. But let him not
disturb my ashes, unless he be really
in want; for it will be a violation.”
The sepulchre remained untouched till

Hystaspes. His avar ce having moved

nothing but the dead body, with the

<P>Topal Osman, who had received his
education in the seraglio, being in the
year 1698 about the age of twenty-five,
was sent with the Sultan's orders
to the Bashaw of Cairo. He travelled
by land to <HI>Said;</HI> and being afraid of
the Arabs who rove about plundering
passengers and caravans, he imbarked
on board a Turkish vessel bound to Da∣mietta,
a city on the Nile. In this
short passage they were attacked by a
Spanish privateer, and a bloody action
ensued. Topal Osman gave here the
first proofs of that intrepidity, by which
he was so often signalized afterwards.
The crew, animated by his example,
fought with great bravery; but supe∣rior
numbers at last prevailed, and Os∣man
was taken prisoner, after being
dangerously wounded in the arm and
thigh.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="138"/>
Osman's gallantry induced the Spa∣nish
captain to pay him particular re∣gard:
but his wounds were still in a
bad way when he was carried to Malta,
whither the privateer went to refit.
The wound in his thigh was the most
dangerous; and he was lame of it ever
after; for which he had the name of
<HI>Topal,</HI> or cripple.</P>
<P>At that time Vincent Arnaud, a na∣tive
of Marseilles, was commander of
the port at Malta; who, as his business
required, went on board the privateer
so soon as she came to anchor. Osman
no sooner saw Arnaud, than he said to
him, “Can you do a generous and gal∣lant
action? Ransom me, and take
my word you shall lose nothing by
it.” Such a request from a slave in
chains was uncommon; but the manner
in which it was delivered, made an im∣pression
upon the Frenchman; who
turning to the captain of the privateer,
asked what he demanded for the ran∣som.
He answered 1000 sequins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Near L. 500</NOTE>.
Arnaud turning to the Turk, said, “I
<PB N="133" REF="139"/>
know nothing of you; and would
you have me risk 1000 sequins on
your bare word?” “Each of us act in
this (replied the Turk) with consist∣ency.
I am in chains, and therefore
try every method to recover my li∣berty,
and you may have reason to
distrust the word of a stranger. I
have nothing at present but my word
to give you; nor do I pretend to as∣sign
any reason why you should trust
to it. I can only say, that if you in∣cline
to act a generous part, you shall
have no reason to repent.” The
commander upon this went to make
his report to the Grand Master Don
Perellos. The air with which Osman
delivered himself, wrought so upon
Arnaud, that he returned immediately
on board the Spanish vessel, and agreed
with the captain for 600 sequins, which
he paid as the price of Osman's liberty.
He put him on board a vessel of his
own, and provided him a surgeon, with
every thing necessary for his entertain∣ment
and cure.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="140"/>
Osman had mentioned to his benefac∣tor,
that he might write to Constanti∣nople
for the money he had advanced;
but finding himself in the hands of a
man who had trusted so much to his ho∣nour,
he was emboldened to ask ano∣ther
favour; which was, to leave the
payment of the ransom entirely to him.
Arnaud discerned, that in such a case
things were not to be done by halves.
He agreed to the proposal with a good
grace; and shewed him every other
mark of generosity and friendship. Ac∣cordingly
Osman, so soon as he was in
a condition, set out again upon his voy∣age.</P>
<P>The French colours now protected
him from the privateers. In a short
time he reached Damietta, and sailed
up the Nile to Cairo. No sooner was
he arrived there, than he delivered
1000 sequins to the master of the ves∣sel,
to be paid to his benefactor Ar∣naud,
together with some rich furs;
and he gave to the master himself, five
hundred crowns as a present. He exe∣cuted
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
the orders of the Sultan his ma∣ster
with the Basha of Cairo; and set∣ting
out for Constantinople, was the
first who brought the news of his slave∣ry.</P>
<P>The favour received from Arnaud in
such circumstances, made an impression
upon a generous mind, too deep ever
to be eradicated. During the whole
course of his life, he did not cease, by
letters and other acknowledgements, to
testify his gratitude.</P>
<P>In the 1715, war was declared be∣tween
the Venetians and Turks. The
Grand Vizir, who had projected the in∣vasion
of the Morea, assembled the Ot∣toman
army near the isthmus of Co∣rinth,
the only pass by which this pe∣ninsula
can be attacked by land. To∣pal
Osman was charged with the com∣mand
to force the pass; which he not
only executed successfully, but after∣wards
took the city of Corinth by as∣sault.
For this service he was reward∣ed,
by being made a basha of two tails.
The next year he served as lieutenant-general
<PB N="136" REF="142"/>
under the Grand Vizir, at the
siege of Corfu, which the Turks were
obliged to abandon. Osman staid three
days before the place, to secure and
conduct the retreat of the Ottoman
troops.</P>
<P>In the 1722, he was appointed Se∣raskier<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General in chief.</NOTE>, and had the command of the
army in the Morea. When the con∣suls
of the different nations came to pay
their respects to him in this quality, he
distinguished the French by peculiar
marks of kindness and protection. “In∣form
Vincent Arnaud,” says he,
that I am the fonder of my new dig∣nity,
as it enables me to serve him.
Let me have his son in pledge of our
friendship; and I will charge myself
with making his fortune.” Accord∣ingly
Arnaud's son went into the Mo∣rea,
and the Seraskier not only made
him presents, but granted him privi∣leges
and advantages in trade, which
soon put him in a way of acquiring an
estate.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="143"/>
Topal Osman's parts and abilities
soon raised him to a greater command.
He was made a basha of three tails, and
beglerbeg of Romania, one of the great∣est
governments in the empire, and of
the greatest importance by its vicinity
to Hungary.</P>
<P>His residence during his government
was at Nyssa. In the year 1727, Vin∣cent
Arnaud and his son waited up∣on
him there, and were received
with the utmost tenderness. Laying
aside the basha and governor, he em∣braced
them, caused them to be served
with s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erbet and perfumes, and made
them sit upon the same sopha with him∣self;
an honour but rarely bestowed by
a basha of the first order, and hardly e∣ver
to a Christian. After these marks
of distinction, he sent them away load∣ed
with presents.</P>
<P>In the great revolution which hap∣pened
at Constantinople <HI>anno</HI> 1730,
the Grand Vizir Ibrahim perished. The
times were so tumultuary, that one and
the same year had seen no fewer than
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
three successive vizirs. In September
1731, Topal Osman was called from
his government to fill this place; which
being the highest in the Ottoman em∣pire,
and perhaps the highest that any
subject in the world enjoys, is always
dangerous, and was then greatly so.
He no sooner arrived at Constantinople
to take possession of his new dignity,
than he desired the French ambassador
to inform his old benefactor of his ad∣vancement;
and that he should hasten
to Constantinople, while things re∣mained
in the present situation; add∣ing,
that a Grand Vizir seldom kept
long in his station.</P>
<P>In the month of January 1732, Ar∣naud,
with his son, arrived at Constan∣tinople
from Malta, bringing with him
variety of presents, and twelve Turks
whom he had ransomed from slavery.
These, by command of the Vizir, were
ranged in order before him. Vincent
Arnaud, now seventy-two years of age,
with his son, were brought before To∣pal
Osman Grand Vizir of the Ottoman
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
empire. He received them in the pre∣sence
of the great officers of state, with
the utmost marks of affection. Then
turning to those about him, and point∣ing
to the ransomed Turks: “Behold,”
says he, “these your brethren, now
enjoying the sweets of liberty, after
having groaned in slavery: this
Frenchman is their deliverer. I was
myself a slave; loaded with chains,
streaming in blood, and covered with
wounds: this is the man who re∣deemed
and saved me; this is my
master and benefactor: to him I am
indebted for life, liberty, fortune,
and every thing I enjoy. Without
knowing me, he paid for me a large
ransom, sent me away upon my bare
word, and gave me a ship to carry
me. Where is ever a Mussulman
capable of such generosity?”</P>
<P>While Osman was speaking, all eyes
were fixed upon Arnauld, who held the
Grand Vizir's hands closely locked be∣tween
his own. The Vizir then asked
both father and son many questions con∣cerning
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
their situation and fortune,
heard their answers with kindness and
attention, and then ended with an Ara∣bic
sentence, ALLAH KERIM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The providence of God is great.</NOTE>. He
made before them the distribution of
the presents they had brought, the great∣est
part of which he sent to the Sultan,
the Sultana mother, and the Kislar
Aga<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chief of the black eu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>chs.</NOTE>. Upon which the two French∣men
made their obeisance, and retired.</P>
<P>After this ceremony was over, the son
of the Grand Vizir took them to his a∣partments,
where he treated them with
great kindness. Some time before they
left Constantinople, they had a confer∣ence
in private with the Vizir, who di∣vested
himself of all state and ceremony.
He let them understand, that the na∣ture
of his situation would not permit
him to do as he desired, since a mini∣ster
ever appears in the eyes of many,
to do nothing without a view to his
own particular interest; adding, that a
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
bashaw was lord and master in his own
province, but that the Grand Vizir at
Constantinople had a master greater
than himself.</P>
<P>He caused them to be amply paid for
the ransom of the Turks, and likewise
procured them payment of a debt which
they had looked on as desperate. He
also made them large presents in money,
and gave them an order for taking a
loading of corn at Salonica; which was
likely to be very profitable, as the ex∣portation
of corn from that part had
been for a long time prohibited.</P>
<P>As his gratitude was without bounds,
his liberality was the same. His beha∣viour
to his benefactor demonstrated
that greatness of soul, which displayed
itself in every action of his life. And
this behaviour must appear the more
generous, when it is considered, what
contempt and aversion the prejudices of
education create in a Turk against Chri∣stians.</P>

<P>Damon and Pythias were intimate
friends. Damon being condemned to
death by Dionysius the tyrant, demand∣ed
liberty to go home to set his af∣fairs
in order; and his friend offered
himself bail, submitting to death if Da∣mon
should not return. Every one
was in expectation what would be the
event, and every one began to condemn
Pythias for so rash an action. But he,
confident of the integrity of his friend,
waited the appointed time with alacri∣ty.
Damon, strict to his engagement,
returned at the appointed time. Dio∣nysius,
admiring their mutual fidelity,
pardoned Damon, and pray'd to have

<P>At the battle of Philippi, when Bru∣tus,
after the rout of his army, was in

enemies, his bosom-friend Lucilius gave
him an opportunity to escape, calling
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>
out, “I am Brutus, lead me to An∣tony.”
Being conducted to Antony,
he spoke with great resolution. “I
have employ'd this artifice,” said he,
“that Brutus might not fall alive into
the hands of his enemies. The gods
will never permit that fortune shall
triumph so far over virtue. In spite of
fortune, Brutus will always be found,
dead or alive, in a situation worthy
of his courage.” Antony admiring
the firmness of Lucilius, said to him,
“You merit a greater recompence than
it is in my power to bestow. I have
been just now informed of the death
of Brutus; and as your fidelity to
him is now at an end, I beg earnest∣ly
to be received in his place: love
me as you did him, I wish no more.”
Lucilius engaged himself to Antony,
and maintaining the same fidelity to him
that he had done to Brutus, adhered to
him when he was abandoned by all the
world.</P>

<P>A certain magpye was more busy

saw him with a flock of pigeons, plun∣dering
a field of ripe corn; anon,
perch'd on a cherry-tree with a parcel

situation, and the wildness of

my dear, quit the town-gaieties, and

my friend's agreeable conversation, pass
the remainder of my days in the solitude
he has chosen. Well, Sir, replies the
raven, I shall at all times be glad to re∣ceive
you in my old-fashioned way: but
you and I should certainly prove most
unsuitable companions. Your whole
ambition is to shine in company, and to
recommend yourself by universal com∣plaisance:
my greatest happiness con∣sists
in ease and privacy, with the con∣versation
of a few select friends. I pre∣fer
a good heart before the most voluble

<P>In that notable victory which Cyrus
<PB N="148" REF="154"/>
the Persian obtained over the Assyrians,
Panthea, wife to Abradatas King of the
Susians, was made a captive; and being
a lady reckoned the most beautiful of
Asia, was reserved for Cyrus, by his
captains. Her husband was not in the
battle, being employed to treat of an
alliance betwixt the Assyrians and the
King of Bactria. Cyrus, calling to him
Araspes, the companion of his youth,
recommended Panthea to his care.
Have you seen this woman, O Cyrus,
said Araspes? Cyrus answered, No.
But I did, replied he. When we chose
her for you, she was sitting in her tent,
without any distinguishing mark or ha∣bit,
surrounded by her women. But,
desirous to know which was the mistress,
we immediately found her out, though
covered with a veil, and looking on the
ground. She got up to receive us, and
we perceived that she excelled in sta∣ture,
in grace, and beautiful shape. The
eldest among us addressed her in the fol∣lowing
words. “Take courage, wo∣man.
We have heard that your hus∣band
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
is a brave man: but now you
are reserved for one not inferior to
him, in person, understanding, or
power; for if there be in the world
who deserves admiration, Cyrus is the
man, and to him you are destined.”
The woman, hearing this, tore her
robe, and, accompanied with her ser∣vants,
set up a lamentable cry. Upon
this, part of her face was discovered,
and her neck and hands. And be it
known to you, Cyrus, that we all
thought never was produced such an∣other
woman. Therefore, by all means,
you must see her. Cyrus answered,
That now he was resolved against it.
Why so? said the young man. Because,
said Cyrus, if, upon hearing from you
that she is handsome, I am persuaded to
see her, I am afraid I shall be more easily
tempted to see her a second time, and
perhaps come to neglect my affairs,
and sit gazing on her. Araspes smiling,
Do you think, Cyrus, that beauty can
necessitate one to act contrary to reason?
If this were naturally so, all would be
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>
under the same necessity. But of beau∣ties,
some inspire love, some not; for
love is voluntary, and every man loves
whom he pleases. How comes it then
to pass, replied Cyrus, if love be volun∣tary,
that one cannot give it over when
he inclines? I have seen persons in
grief and tears upon account of love,
wishing to be rid of it as of any other dis∣temper,
and yet bound by a stronger
tie of necessity than if bound in iron
chains. The young man to this said,
There are indeed examples of this kind;
but such are miserable wretches; for
though they are always wishing them∣selves
dead, as unhappy, yet they ne∣ver
think of parting with life. Just
such wretches are they who commit
theft; and yet, O Cyrus, I observe that
you treat these with great severity, as
reckoning theft no such fatal necessary
thing. So persons that are beautiful do
not necessitate others to love them, or
to covet what they ought not. Weak
men, impotent in mind, are slaves to
their passions; and to excuse themselves,
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
accuse love. But the firm and resolute,
though fond of gold, fine horses, beau∣tiful
women, can with ease abstain, so
as to do nothing contrary to right. I,
who have seen this woman, and think
her extremely beautiful, remain not∣withstanding
free, and ready in all re∣spects
to perform my duty. But per∣haps,
said Cyrus, you retired before
the time that love naturally lays hold of
a man. It is the nature of fire not in∣stantly
to burn; yet am I not willing,
either to meddle with fire, or to look
on beautiful persons. Be easy, said
he, Cyrus: though I look on Panthea
without ceasing, I will not be so con∣quered,
as to do any thing I ought not.
You speak, said Cyrus, handsomely:
be careful of the woman, for she may
be of service to us in some future exi∣gency.
And thus they parted.</P>
<P>Araspes, partly by conversing with a
woman not less wise than beautiful,
partly by studying to serve and please
her, partly by her gratitude when he
was sick, and her anxiety for his reco∣very;
<PB N="152" REF="158"/>
—by all these means, he was
made her captive in love. He ventu∣red
to open his heart to her; but with∣out
success: for she had the warmest
affection for her husband. Yet she for∣bore
complaining to Cyrus, being un∣willing
to hurt Araspes. Araspes be∣gan
to think of force; for his passion
was now too violent to be restrained.
Upon this, Panthea, apprehensive of
the consequences, was no longer silent:
she sent an eunuch to Cyrus to inform
him of her danger. Cyrus, laughing
at the man who thought himself above
the power of love, commanded his
chief minister to tell Araspes, That if
he could prevail by persuasion, it was
well; but that by no means was he to
think of force. The minister used no
tenderness in delivering the commis∣sion;
he accused Araspes as a betrayer
of his trust, reproaching him for his
injustice, and impotence of passion.
The young man, struck to the heart,
shed many tears. Cyrus sending for
him, I see, Araspes, said he, that you
<PB N="153" REF="159"/>
are overwhelmed with fear and shame;
but be comforted, for I have read, that
the gods themselves have been conquer∣ed
by love. The wisest of men are not
exempted from this passion; and I pro∣nounced
upon myself, that if I conver∣sed
with beautiful women, I was not
enough my own master to disregard
them. It is I that am the cause of your
misfortune, by shutting you up with
this irresistible beauty. Araspes warm∣ly
replied, You are in this, O Cyrus,
as in other matters, mild, and dispo∣sed
to pardon the failings of men. But
how shall I hold up after this miscar∣riage?
My friends will neglect me, and
my enemies triumph over me. Cyrus
said, Agreeable to me is thy sorrow, O
Araspes: lives there a mortal without
failings? Happy he who profits by
them.</P>
<P>Panthea, charmed with this conduct
in Cyrus, and admiring his excellent
qualifications, endeavoured to gain her
husband Abradatas to his side. She
knew there was no cordiality betwixt
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
him and the King of Assyria. That
prince had attempted to take Panthea
from him; and Abradatas, consider∣ing
him as an unjust man, wished no∣thing
more earnestly, than an opportu∣nity
to quit his service. For this rea∣son
he listened to the solicitations of
his wife; and came over to Cyrus with
two thousand horse. Panthea inform∣ed
him of the virtue of Cyrus, and of
his tender regard for her. What can
I do Panthea, said Abradatas, to show
my gratitude to Cyrus? What else,
said she, but to behave towards him as
he has behaved towards you? Upon
this, Abradatas, coming to Cyrus, and
taking him by the hand, said, O Cyrus,
in return for the benefits you have be∣stowed
upon us, I give myself to you,
an ally, a servant, and a friend.</P>
<P>From that time Cyrus had no ally
more attached to his interest than Abra∣datas.
The morning of that day in
which Cyrus overthrew Croesus, Pan∣thea
brought to her husband preparing
for the battle, a golden helmet, brace∣lets
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
for his wrists, a purple robe, and
a crest of a violet colour. These things
having been prepared without his know∣ledge,
he said to her, Have you made
me these arms, Panthea, by destroying
your own ornaments? No, surely, said
she, not by destroying what is the most
valuable of them; for you are my great∣est
ornament. Proceeding to put on
the armour, tears trickled down her
cheeks, though she endeavoured to re∣strain
them. Abradatas, in this dress,
appeared most beautiful and noble.
Panthae, after desiring all that were
present to retire, spoke as follows. “O
Abradatas! if ever there were a wo∣man
who regarded her husband more
than her own soul, you know that I
am she. And yet though I stand thus
affected toward you, I swear by our
mutual friendship, that rather would
I be put under ground with you,
approving yourself a brave man, than
live with you in disregard and shame.
We both lie under great obligations
to Cyrus, that when I was a captive,
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
and chosen for himself, he kept me
for you, as if I were his brother's
wife.” Abradatas, struck with ad∣miration
at her discourse, gently took
her hand into his, and lifting up his
eyes to heaven, made the following
prayer, “Do thou, O great Jupiter,
grant me to appear a husband wor∣thy
of Panthea, and a friend worthy
of Cyrus!” and having said thus, he
mounted his chariot, and moved along.
She could not refrain from following,
till Abradatas, seeing her, said, Have
courage, Panthea, the gods take care
of the virtuous: and upon this she was
conducted to her tent. Though Abra∣datas
in his chariot made a noble ap∣pearance,
yet he drew no eyes till Pan∣thea
was gone.</P>
<P>The victory that day was complete:
Cyrus routed his enemies, and got pos∣session
of their camp. Toward the e∣vening,
when the battle was over, Cy∣rus,
calling some of his servants, in∣quired,
whether any of them had seen
Abradatas? But Abradatas was now
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
no more! he was slain, breaking in up∣on
the Egyptians. All his followers,
except some trusty companions, had
turned their backs when they saw the
compact body of the enemy. And Cy∣rus
was informed, that Panthea had re∣tired
with the dead body to the bank of
the river Pactolus; that her servants
were digging a grave for it; and that
she herself was sitting upon the ground
with the head of her dead husband up∣on
her knees. Cyrus, hearing this,
smote his breast, and hastened to Pan∣thea.
Seeing Abradatas lying dead, he
shed tears, and said, Alas, thou brave
and faithful soul! hast thou left us, and
art no more? At the same time he took
him by the right hand, which came a∣way,
for it had been cut off in battle.
The woman, smothering her grief, took
the hand from Cyrus, kissed it, join∣ed
it to the body, and said, The rest,
Cyrus, is in the same condition. But
why should you look upon this mang∣led
body? for you are not less affected
than I am. “Fool that I was! fre∣quently
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
did I exhort him to show his
friendship for you; and I know he
never thought of what he himself
might suffer, but of what he should
do to gain your favour. He died,
therefore, without reproach, and I,
who urged him on, sit here alive.”
Cyrus, shedding tears, spoke thus: “He
has died, O woman! but his death
has been glorious, for he has van∣quished
his enemies. Honours shall
be paid him suiting a conqueror. A
lofty monument shall be erected for
him; and all the sacrifices shall be
made that are due to the memory of
a brave man.” Having said this, he
went away, with great concern for the
woman who had lost such a husband;
sorrowing also for the man who had
left such a wife behind him, never to
see her more.</P>
<P>The woman ordered her eunuchs to
retire, till such time, said she, as I have
lamented over my husband. She retain∣ed
only one faithful attendant, com∣manding,
that when she was dead, she
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
should be wrapped in the same mantle
with her husband. The servant, after
repeated remonstrances, finding her in∣treaties
unsuccessful, broke into a flood
of tears. Panthea, being beforehand
provided with a sword, thrust it into
her bosom, and laying her head upon her
husband's breast, died. The maid-ser∣vant,
setting up a most lamentable cry,
covered the bodies as she had been di∣rected.
Cyrus informed of this melan∣choly
scene, hastened to the place, struck
with admiration of the woman, and la∣mented
over her. Their funeral rites
were performed in the most solemn
manner; and their monument is to be
seen in that country to this day.</P>

<P>A connection that subsists upon gra∣titude
and mutual good offices, is ge∣nerally
brittle. Each is apt to over∣value
the good he does to the other;
and consequently to expect more grati∣tude
than is reasonable. Hence heart∣burnings
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
and disgust. It is otherwise
where the connection is formed upon
affection and habit. Quarrels tend to
strengthen the connection, by the pain
of being at variance. The first sort of
connection is commonly that of friends,
the other that of lovers.</P>

<P>It is observed of Maecenas and Salu∣stius
Crispus, the one the favourite of
Augustus, the other of Tiberius, that
in their declining years, they retained
more of show, than of reality, in the
friendship of these princes. Tacitus,
upon this, makes the following reflec∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Annal. l. 3. § 30.</NOTE>,
That favour is seldom long-li∣ved;
whether it be, that satiety takes
the prince, when he has nothing left to
bestow; or the favourite, when there
is nothing left for him to desire.</P>

<P>Just resentment is appeased by a suit∣able
acknowledgment; for it has no
further aim. But an unjust action ran∣kles
the mind, and inflames every male∣volent
passion. Hence a similar obser∣vation,
That it is more difficult to re∣concile
the person who does the injury,
than him who receives it. The very
sight of one we have injured, stings us
with remorse, and we are not far from
hating one who continually gives us
pain. This is apt to make the inju∣rious
person inflexible; whereas the
person injured feels nothing but the in∣jury
to obstruct a reconciliation; and
so soon as a proper atonement is made,
resentment is at an end.</P>

<P>Achaia, under the government of A∣ratus,
was the most flourishing republic
of Greece, till it came to be rivalled by
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
Sparta under Cleomenes. Sparta soli∣cited
an alliance with the Achaeans for
their common safety. But Aratus, re∣jecting
the proposition, chose to put his
people under the protection of Antigo∣nus
King of Macedon. This step was
inconsistent with sound politics. Cle∣omenes
was a man of virtue and civili∣zed
manners, and had no view beyond
the public good. Antigonus was a ty∣rant
and oppressor, so insolent, as even
to demand divine honours. But Anti∣gonus
was an old king, and considered
always by Aratus as his superior. Cle∣omenes,
on the contrary, was a young
man rising into fame; and what is still
of greater weight, he was of the same
rank, and in the same circumstances,
with Aratus. And it is a maxim we
may hold as unquestionable, That in the
race of glory, it gives us more pain to
see one gaining ground of us, than
twenty running before us.</P>

<P>Alexander having conquered Sidon,

recommended to Hephaestion to chuse

He offered the crown to two young men

refused the same, because they were
not of the royal stock; saying, that it
was against the law of their country for
any other family to inherit the crown.
Hephaestion, admiring their magnani∣mity,
cried out, “O! happy young
men, who know how much more
wise it is to reject a crown, than to
receive it unjustly!” And as a mark
of his esteem, he requested of them to
chuse the king. They pitched upon

being reduced to poverty, had nothing

<P>Melesichton, born at Megara, of il∣lustrious
parents, dreamed of nothing
in his youth, but to imitate the warlike
virtues of his ancestors. He signalized
himself in several expeditions, was in
<PB N="171" REF="177"/>
the midst of every dangerous attempt,
and came ever off victorious. Being
highly esteemed by his fellow-citizens,
he was chosen their general; and shew∣ed
himself greater by his conduct, than
formerly by his courage. His ambition
was inflamed; power corrupted his
mind, and he aimed at no less than the
sovereignty, being unable to obey whom
he had so long commanded. Thus,
from an useful member of the state, he
became a dangerous enemy. Lust of
rule threw down him, whom courage
and conduct had raised. He was depri∣ved
of all his employments, and a law
was made, that he should not thereafter
bear any command in the city. This
change of fortune threw him into de∣spair:
and to avoid disgrace, he retired
to the country with his wife and family.
His ambition had made him neglect mo∣ney,
and his inclination to magnifi∣cence
had dissipated the bulk of his pa∣ternal
estate. All that he had remain∣ing,
was a small farm in a remote cor∣ner.
<PB N="172" REF="178"/>
There he shut himself up out of
the eye of the world.</P>
<P>His wife Praxinoe had spirit and reso∣lution.
Her beauty and birth had made
her the object of many vows, but she
had preferred Melesichton purely for his
merit. Mutual affection, which had
made this couple happy for many years,
occasioned now their greatest distress.
Melesichton imagined that he could bear
singly the greatest misfortunes, but he
could not bear to see Praxinoe reduced
to poverty. Praxinoe, on the other
hand, was in despair to find that she
contributed to her husband's affliction.
Their children, a boy and a girl, were
their only remaining còmfort. Meli∣beus,
the son, began early to show
strength, address, and courage. In
this solitude, his father had leisure to
teach him every lesson for cultivating
and adorning the mind. Melibeus had
an air, simple, sweet, and ingenuous,
mixed with firmness and elevation. Me∣lesichton,
beholding him, could seldom
refrain from tears. His own misfor∣tunes
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>
he considered as nothing; but
it stung him to the heart that they
should be extended to his children. Da∣maeta,
the daughter, was instructed by
her mother in all the arts of Minerva.
She was skilled in music, and her voice
was accompanied with the lyre, more
moving than that of Orpheus. Her hair
hung waving in the wind without any
ornament. She was dressed in a plain
robe, borne up with with a girdle, which
made her motions perfectly easy. With∣out
dress, she had beauty; and knew it
not, having never even thought of
viewing herself in a fountain. The fa∣ther,
in the mean time, full of discon∣tent,
delivered himself up to despair.
His frequented walk was on the sea∣shore,
at the foot of an impending rock.
There he would often retire from his
family to deplore his misfortunes. He
never spoke but in sighs; he neglected
the cares of life, enervated and sunk in
black melancholy.</P>
<P>One day, overcome with weariness
and distress, he fell asleep. The god∣dess
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
Ceres appeared to him in a dream.
Her head was crowned with golden ears
of corn. She spoke to him with sweet∣ness
and majesty: “Is it for Melesich∣ton
to be subdued by the rigours of
fortune? Doth true nobility consist in
riches? Doth it not consist in a firm∣ness
of mind superior to fortune? Men
render themselves miserable, by in∣dolence
and false glory. If necessaries
be wanting, would you owe them to
others rather than to yourself? Con∣tent
yourself with little; gain that
little by your work; free yourself from
a dependence on others; and you shall
be most noble. Take courage, there∣fore,
and be industrious.” She end∣ed,
and presented him with a <HI>cornuco∣pia.</HI>
Bacchus appeared crowned with
ivy. Pan followed playing on a flute,
with the fawns and satyrs dancing around.
Pomona presented a lapful of fruits; and
Flora scattered flowers vivid and odori∣ferous.
These field-divinities, all of
them, threw a favourable regard upon
Melesichton.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="181"/>
He awaked, and was comforted. He
talked of his dream to Praxinoe. They
perceived contentment within their
reach, and began to taste rural pleasures.
Nothing was now to be seen in the fami∣ly
but a face of chearful industry. Praxi∣noe
and Damaeta applied themselves to
spinning. They had herbs from a small
garden, and milk from a large flock.
Their food was dressed up with clean∣ness
and propriety. It was simple, na∣tural,
and good, seasoned with an ap∣petite
inseparable from temperance and
travail. Their house was neat: the ta∣pestries
were sold, but the walls were
white and clean. Their beds were not rich,
but they were not the less decent, and
easy. The kitchen itself had an elegance
not to be seen in great houses, every
thing in it shining, and in its proper
place. To regale the family upon ex∣traordinary
occasions, Praxinoe produ∣ced
honey, and the finest fruits. She
cultivated a flower-garden, sold part,
and reserved part to adorn her house.
Damaeta imitated her mother. She
<PB N="176" REF="182"/>
went about singing at her work. Her
tender lambs danced upon the green,
and the echoes around repeated her
notes. Agriculture was Melesichton's
province. He himself held the plough,
sowed the grain, and attended the reap∣ers.
He found such labours more inno∣cent
than those of war. He planted a
vineyard, and had wine to entertain
his guests. Winter, the season of
repose, was dedicated to social inter∣course
and innocent amusement. Me∣lesichton
thanked the gods for opening
his eyes. He was now sensible of the
false lustre of ambition and greatness;
and he was entirely satisfied with his pre∣sent
lot. In Melibeus, occupation and toil
suppressed youthful passions. The orchard
was his care; he planted trees, and nursed
them up. He brought a canal of water
into the garden, which he divided into
many rills. His father had inspired him
with a taste for reading; and in the inter∣vals
of work, his diversions were hunt∣ing,
running, and wrestling with the
neighbouring youth.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="183"/>
Melesichton, now accustomed to a life
of simplicity, found himself more at ease,
than in his wonted grandeur. The ne∣cessaries
of life he had in abundance, and
he desired nothing beyond. The plea∣sures
of society he tasted in his own fa∣mily.
Love and tenderness united them
intimately, and bestowed sincere happi∣ness.
At a distance from court, they
were ignorant of its giddy pleasures,
dangerous in the fruition, and still more
dangerous in the consequences. Their
pleasures were sweet, innocent, simple,
and always within reach. Plenty once a∣gain
visited this family; but pride and
ambition returned no more.</P>
<P>All the world said to Melesichton,
“Riches are returned, it is time to re∣turn
to your former grandeur.” Am∣bition,
with regard to himself, was
thoroughly mortified: but he esteemed
his children, and thought them quali∣fied
for the highest rank. To deliberate
upon a step so important, he retired to
his solitary walk, and seated himself up∣on
the side of a limpid stream, revol∣ving
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>
in his mind the past and future.
Falling insensibly asleep, the goddess
Ceres appeared to him as in his former
dream, and thus she spoke: “To which
would you be devoted; to ambition,
which ruined you; or to industry,
which has made you rich and happy?
True dignity flows from independ∣ence,
and from the exercise of bene∣volence.
Owe therefore your subsist∣ence
to the fruitful earth, and to your
own labour. Let never indolence or
false glory tempt you to quit that
which is the natural and inexhaustible
source of all good.”</P>

me. In the mean time a purchaser
comes: he sees and purchases the parch∣ment-book;
it was an oracle of law.
At the first glance he condemns the o∣ther;
a poem, not less extravagant than
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>

so much precious leather thrown away.</P>

<P>Discontented with his present lot, a
certain man was always at his prayers
for better fortune. Jupiter in good
humour transports him into the cele∣stial
magazines, where a number of
bags sealed by the destinies, were ran∣ged
in order, containing all the differ∣ent
fortunes of men. Here, says Ju∣piter,
your lot is in your hand: but to
regulate your choice, know that the
most fortunate lots weigh the least;
misfortunes only are heavy. Thanks
to Jupiter, replies our man, I shall now
be happy. He lays hold of the first
bag, that of kings, covering cruel cares
under an external pomp. Oh ho! says
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
he, that man must be vigorous indeed
who bears so heavy a burden. Throw∣ing
it aside, he weighs a second, the
bag of the great, and of men in place.
There lie anxiety and profound medi∣tation,
the thirst of power, the terror
of disgrace. Miserable they to whom
this lot belongs! cries our man: may
heaven preserve me from it. He goes
on weighing bags without end, finding
them all too heavy, some by sad con∣finement,
some by unbounded desires,
some by envy and fear, and some mere∣ly
by the satiety of pleasure. At last he
stumbled on the lot that pleased him:
This, says he, weighs not so much. And
it would weigh still less, says the god,
if it did not belong to one who is ig∣norant

<P>When Calais, after a shameful re∣volt,
was retaken by Edward III. he,
as a punishment, appointed six of the
most reputable burgesses to be put to
death, leaving the inhabitants to chuse
the victims. While the inhabitants,
stupidly aghast, declined to make a
choice, Eustace de St Pierre, a bur∣gess
of the first rank, offered himself to
be one of the devoted six. A generosity
so uncommon raised such admiration,
that five more were quickly found who
followed his example. These six illu∣strious
persons, marching out bare-foot∣ed,
with halters about their necks, present∣ed
to the conqueror the keys of the town.
The Queen being informed of their he∣roic
virtue, threw herself at the King's
feet, intreating him, with tears in her
eyes, to regard such illustrious merit.
She not only obtained their pardon, but
entertained them in her own tent, and
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>
dismissed them with a handsome pre∣sent.</P>
<P>It was the fixed opinion of Aristides
the Athenian, that he was bound to
serve his country without the expecta∣tion
of being rewarded with riches or
honours. Being one day in the theatre,
where a tragedy of Aeschylus was acted,
containing the following words, “That
he cared more to be just, than to ap∣pear
so;” all eyes were instantly turn∣ed
upon Aristides, as meriting that
character; and from that time he got
the surname of <HI>Just.</HI> This remarkable
distinction roused envy, and envy pre∣vailed
so far as to procure his banish∣ment
for ten years, upon the unjust
suspicion, that his influence with the
people was dangerous to their freedom.
But his absence dissipated these vain ter∣rors.
He was soon recalled; and with∣out
shewing the least resentment against
his enemies, he, for many years, acted
both in peace and war with the great∣est
prudence and moderation. His dis∣regard
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
for money was visible at his
death; for though he was frequently
treasurer, as well as general, he scarce
left sufficient to defray the expence of
his burial. But his virtues did not pass
without reward. He had two daugh∣ters,
who were educated at the expence
of the state, and got portions allotted
them from the public treasury.</P>
<P>Plancus being proscribed by the
Triumvirs Antonius, Lepidus, and Oc∣tavius,
was forced to abscond. His
slaves, though put to the torture, re∣fused
to discover him. New torments
being prepared, Plancus appeared, to
prevent further distress to servants that
were so faithful to him, and offered his
throat to the swords of the execution∣ers.
An example so noble, of mutual
affection betwixt a master and his slaves,
procured a pardon to Plancus, and made
all the world say, that Plancus only
was worthy of so good servants, and
they only were worthy of so good a
master.</P>

Cneius Domitius, Tribune of the Ro∣man
people, burning to ruin his ene∣my
Marcus Scaurus, chief of the senate,
accused him publicly, before the peo∣ple,
of several high crimes and misde∣meanors.
His zeal in the prosecution
excited a slave of Scaurus, through
hope of a reward, to offer himself pri∣vately
as a witness. But justice here
prevailed over revenge: for Domitius,
without listening to a single word, or∣dered
the perfidious wretch to be fet∣tered,
and to be carried instantly to his
master. This action was so much ad∣mired,
that there was no end of heap∣ing
honours upon Domitius. He was
successively elected consul, censor, and

<P>A carpenter who had accidentally
dropt his ax into a river, petitioned
Mercury to help him to it again. Mer∣cury,
for a trial of his honesty, fished
up a gold ax; which the man refused,
as not belonging to him. The next
was a silver ax; which was also refu∣sed,
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
for the same reason. At last came
the identical ax that had dropt into the
water; and this the poor man claimed
as his property. Mercury, to reward his
honesty, gave him all the three. It
came into the head of another carpent∣er
to try the experiment. He threw
his ax into the water, imploring Mer∣cury
to restore it to him. First the
gold ax, and then the silver ax, being
presented, both were refused; but the
third was accepted, being that which
had been thrown into the water. The
knave, now swallowing, in his expec∣tations,
the other two axes, was bit∣terly
disappointed, when he heard the
following words pronounced with a
stern look, “Learn, impious mortal,
that the gods reward honesty, and not
deceit.”</P>

with caution, but suspicious of danger,
flew off to fruits and flowers, where, by
the moderation of his meal, he improved
his relish of them. In the evening, he
called upon his friend to accompany him
back to the hive; but found him sur∣feited
in sweets, which he was as un∣able

<P>A young man, son of a cobler in a
small village near Madrid, having push∣ed
his fortune in the Indies, returned to
his native country with a considerable
stock, and set up as a banker in Madrid.
In his absence his parents frequently
talked of him, praying fervently that
Heaven would take him under its pro∣tection;
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>
and the vicar being their-friend,
gave them frequently the public prayers
of the congregation for him. The
banker was not less dutiful on his part;
for so soon as he was settled, he mounted
on horseback, and went alone to the
village. It was ten at night before he
got there; and the honest cobler was a∣bed
with his wife in a sound sleep when
he knocked at the door. Open the
door, says the banker, 'tis your son
Francillo. Make others believe that if
you can, cried the old man, starting
from his sleep; go about your business,
you thieving rogues, here is nothing
for you: Francillo, if not dead, is now
in the Indies. He is no longer there,
replied the banker, he is returned home,
and it is he who now speaks to you:
open your door, and receive him. Ja∣cobo,
said the woman, let us rise then;
for I really believe 'tis Francillo, I think
I know his voice. The father starting
from bed, lighted a candle, and the mo∣ther
putting on her gown in a hurry, o∣pened
the door. Looking earnestly on
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
Francillo, she flung her arms about his
neck, and hugged him with the utmost
affection. Jacobo embraced his son in
his turn; and all three, transported with
joy after so long absence, had no end in
expressing their tenderness. After these
pleasing transports, the banker put his
horse into the stable, where he found
an old milch-cow, nurse to the whole
family. He then gave the old folks an
account of his voyage, and of all the
riches he had brought from Peru. They
listened greedily, and every the least
particular of his relation made on them
a sensible impression of grief or joy.
Having finished his story, he offered
them a part of his estate, and intreated
his father not to work any more. No,
my son, said Jacobo, I love my trade,
and will not leave it off. Why, repli∣ed
the banker, is it not now high time for
you to take your ease? I do not propose
your living with me at Madrid: I
know well that a city-life would not please
you: enjoy your own way of living;
but give over your hard labour, and pass
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
the remainder of your days in ease and
plenty. The mother seconded her son,
and Jacobo yielded. To please you,
Francillo, said he, I will not work any
more for the public, but will only mend
my own shoes, and those of my good
friend the vicar. This agreement being
concluded, the banker eat a couple of
eggs, and slept in the same bed with his
father and mother, enjoying that kindly
satisfaction which none but dutiful chil∣dren
can feel or understand. The next
morning the banker, leaving his parents
a purse of three hundred ducats, return∣ed
to Madrid: but was much surprised
to see Jacobo at his house a few days
thereafter. My father, said he, what
brings you here? Francillo, answered
the honest cobler, I have brought your
purse; take it again; for I desire to live
by my trade, and have been ready to die
with uneasiness ever since I left off work∣ing.</P>

as the price of his advancement. Nay,
laying aside this horrid circumstance,
she did not find the happiness she pro∣posed,
but the direct contrary. She
had laid her account, that her son would
be perfectly obsequious to her; and by
his means had swallowed, in her hopes,
dominion over the universe. But these
hopes, like all that are unbounded, pro∣ved
abortive. Nero would not be ru∣led

<P>Ned Froth, who had been several
years butler in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amily of distinction,
having saved about four hundred pounds,
took a little house in the suburbs, and
laid in a stock of liquors for which he
paid ready money, and which were,
therefore, the best of the kind. Ned
perceived his trade increase: he pur∣sued
it with fresh alacrity, he exulted
in his success, and the joy of his heart
sparkled in his countenance. But it hap∣pened
that Ned, in the midst of his hap∣piness
and prosperity, was prevailed
upon to buy a lottery-ticket. The mo∣ment
his hope was fixed upon an ob∣ject
which industry could not obtain,
he determined to be industrious no
longer: to draw drink for a dirty and
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
boisterous rabble, was a slavery to which
he now submitted with reluctance, and
he longed for the moment in which he
should be free: instead of telling his
story, and cracking his joke for the en∣tertainment
of his customers, he recei∣ved
them with indifference, was obser∣ved
to be silent and sullen, and amused
himself by going three or four times a∣day
to search the register of fortune for
the success of his ticket.</P>
<P>In this disposition Ned was sitting one
morning in the corner of a bench by his
fire-side, wholly abstracted in the con∣templation
of his future fortune; in∣dulging
this moment the hope of a mere
possibility, and the next shuddering with
the dread of losing the felicity which
his fancy had combined with the posses∣sion
of ten thousand pounds. A man
well dressed entered hastily, and inqui∣red
for him of his guests, who many
times called him aloud by his name,
and curst him for his deafness and stupi∣dity,
before Ned started up as from a
dream, and asked with a fretful impa∣tience
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
what they wanted. An affected
confidence of being well received, and
an air of forced jocularity in the stranger,
gave Ned some offence; but the next
moment he catched him in his arms in
a transport of joy, upon receiving his
congratulation as proprietor of the for∣tunate
ticket, which had that morning
been drawn a prize of the first class.</P>
<P>It was not, however, long, before
Ned discovered that ten thousand pounds
did not bring the felicity which he ex∣pected;
a discovery which generally
produces the dissipation of sudden af∣fluence
by prodigality. Ned drank, and
whored, and hired fidlers, and bought
fine cloaths; he bred riots at Vauxhall,
treated flatterers, and damned plays.
But something was still wanting; and
he resolved to strike a bold stroke, and
attempt to double the remainder of his
prize at play, that he might live in a
palace, and keep an equipage: but in
the execution of this project, he lost the
whole produce of his lottery-ticket, ex∣cept
five hundred pounds in bank-notes,
<PB N="204" REF="210"/>
which when he would have staked he
could not find. This sum was more
than that which had established him in
the trade he had left; and yet, with the
power of returning to a station that was
once the utmost of his ambition, and
of renewing that pursuit which alone
had made him happy, such was the pun∣gency
of his regret, that in the despair
of recovering the money which he knew
had produced nothing but riot, disease,
and vexation, he threw himself from
the bridge into the Thames.</P>

to a helot who carried himself insolent∣ly

were not angry, I would immediately
put thee to death.” How different
the behaviour of Piso upon such an oc∣casion.
A soldier returning from fo∣rage
without his companion, of whom
he gave no satisfactory account, Piso,
taking it for granted that he had mur∣dered
his companion, condemned him
instantly to death. The sentence was
at the very point of being executed,
when, behold! the wandering compa∣nion
arrived, which filled all hearts
with joy. They were carried instantly
to Piso, not doubting but that the sen∣tence
would be recalled. But shame
for being in the wrong rekindled Pi∣so's
rage, which made him incapable of
acknowledging his rashness; and, as if
perseverance would justify a wrong, or
hide it from others, he committed an∣other
act of injustice, much less excu∣sable
than the former. The first sol∣dier
was ordered to death, because sen∣tence
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
had passed against him; the se∣cond,
because his absence had occa∣sioned
the death of the first; and the

that anger was easily prevented, but
not easily subdued. To repress anger,
it is a good method to turn the injury
into a jest. Socrates having received a

would be well if people knew when it
were necessary to put on a helmet. Be∣ing

“What,” said he, “if an ass should
kick me, must I call him before the
judge?” Being attacked with oppro∣brious

that the man was not yet taught to speak
respectfully.</P>

Complaints were carried to the Marshal

without his authority, insisted to have
the troops instantly dislodged. Some

complaining to his General, was in∣stantly
<PB N="210" REF="216"/>
sent back to La Ferte, with the
following compliment: “That Tu∣renne
was much concerned to find his

him, and begged the soldier might
be punished as he thought proper.”

we short-lived mortals grieve at the
death of a friend, when we see eve∣ry

ashes? When so many illustrious men,
heads of the Roman state, have sub∣mitted
to death; why should you,

he gave him a considerable gratuity.</P>
<P>The Emperor Augustus being in∣formed
of a conspiracy against his life,
conducted by Lucius Cinna, was at first
moved by resentment to resolve upon
the cruelest punishment. But reflect∣ing
afterwards, that Cinna was a young
man of an illustrious family, and ne∣phew
to the great Pompey, he broke
out into bitter fits of passion: “Why
live I, if it be for the good of ma∣ny
that I should die? Must there be
no end of my cruelties? Is my life of
so great value, that oceans of blood
must be shed to preserve it?” His wife
Livia finding him in this perplexity,
<PB N="214" REF="220"/>
“Will you take a woman's counsel?”
said she. “Imitate the physicians, who
when the ordinary remedies fail, make
trial of what are extraordinary. By
severity you have prevailed nothing.
Lepidus has followed Savidienus,
Murena Lepidus, Caepio Murena,
and Egnatius Caepio. Begin now,
and try whether sweetness and cle∣mency
may not succeed. Cinna is
detected: forgive him; he will ne∣ver
henceforth have the heart to hurt
thee; and it will be an act of glory.”
Augustus was a man of sense. He re∣lished
the advice, and calling Cinna to
a private conference, he spoke as fol∣lows:
“Thou knowest, Cinna, that
having joined my enemies, I gave
thee thy life, restored thee all thy
goods, and advanced thy fortune e∣qually
with the best of those who had
always been my friends. The sacer∣dotal
office I conferred upon thee, af∣ter
having denied it to others, who
had borne arms in my service. And
yet, after so many obligations, thou
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>
hast undertaken to murder me.” See∣ing
Cinna astonished, and silent, with the
consciousness of guilt, he went on as
follows. “Well! Cinna, go thy way;
I again give thee that life as a traitor
and a parricide, which I before gave
thee as an enemy. Let friendship
from this time forward commence
betwixt us; and let us make it ap∣pear,
whether thou hast received thy
life, or I have given it, with the bet∣ter
faith.” Some time after, he pre∣ferred
Cinna to the consular dignity,
complaining that he had not resolution
to demand it. Their friendship conti∣nued
uninterrupted till Cinna's death;
who, in token of his gratitude, ap∣pointed
Augustus to be his sole heir.
And it is remarkable, that Augustus
reaped the due reward of a clemency so
generous and exemplary; for from that
time there never was the slightest con∣spiracy
or attempt against him.</P>

<P>A lion having fed too plentifully on
the carcase of a wild boar, was seized
with a violent and dangerous disorder.
The beasts of the forest flocked in quan∣tities
to pay their respects to their King
on this occasion; and there was not one
absent but the fox. The wolf seized
this opportunity to accuse the fox of
pride, ingratitude, and disaffection to
his Majesty. In the midst of his invec∣tive
the fox entered; who observing the
lion's countenance kindling into wrath,
addressed the assembly with a tone of
zealous loyalty, “May the King live
for ever.” Then turning to the lion,
<PB N="237" REF="243"/>
I see many here, who with mere lip∣service
pretend to show their loyalty;
but for my part, from the moment I
heard of your Majesty's illness, I em∣ployed
myself day and night to find a
remedy for your disease, and have at
length happily got one that is infal∣lible.
It is a plaister made from the
skin of a wolf, taken warm from his
back, and laid to your Majesty's sto∣mach.”
No sooner proposed than a∣greed
to. And while the operation was
performing, the fox, with a sarcastic
smile, whispered to the wolf this useful
maxim: If you would be safe from harm,
learn not to contrive mischief against o∣thers.</P>

<P>And it came to pass after these things,
that Abraham sat in the door of his tent,

<P>And behold, a man bent with age,
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
coming from the way of the wilderness,
leaning on a staff.</P>
<P>And Abraham arose, and met him,
said unto him, Turn in, I pray thee, and
wash thy feet, and tarry all night; and
thou shalt arise early in the morning, and
go on thy way.</P>
<P>And the man said, Nay, for I will a∣bide

he turned, and they went into the tent:
and Abraham baked unleavened bread,
and they did eat.</P>
<P>And when Abraham saw that the man
blessed not God, he said unto him,
Wherefore dost thou not worship the
most high God, creator of heaven and
earth?</P>
<P>And the man answered and said, I do
not worship thy God, neither do I call
upon his name; for I have made to my∣self
a god, which abideth always in
mine house, and provideth me with all
things.</P>
<P>And Abraham's zeal was kindled a∣gainst
the man, and he arose, and fell

upon him, and drove him forth with
blows into the wilderness.</P>
<P>And God called unto Abraham, say∣ing,
Abraham, where is the stranger?</P>
<P>And Abraham answered and said,
Lord, he would not worship thee, nei∣ther
would he call upon thy name;
therefore have I driven him out from
before my face, into the wilderness.</P>
<P>And God said, Have I borne with him
these hundred ninety and eight years,
and nourished him, and cloathed him,
notwithstanding his rebellion against
me; and couldst not thou, who art thyself
a sinner, bear with him one night?</P>
<P>And Abraham said, Let not the an∣ger

lo, I have sinned; forgive me, I
pray thee.</P>
<P>And Abraham arose, and went forth
into the wilderness, and sought dili∣gently
for the man; and found him,
and returned with him to his tent; and
when he had intreated him kindly, he
sent him away in the morning, with

<P>Four men there were, linked in close
friendship. If they differed, it was not
in love: In sentiment? that may be:
one was for the fair beauty, another for
the brown; one dealt in prose, another
in verse; which occasioned frequent dis∣putes
to season their conversation. One
day a favourite topic was started: they
took sides, grew warm; nothing but
noise instead of reason. At last they
parted almost in bad humour; and at
that instant scarce believed themselves
friends. After a calm was restored,
Gentlemen, says one, how happy would
it be for friends to be all of one mind?
They at once agreed upon a supplica∣tion
to the gods, to remove their only
cause of discord, by giving them one
mind, as they had one heart. They
marched in a body to the temple of A∣pollo,
and presented their humble re∣quest.
The god inclined his ear, ex∣erted
his power, and, in the twinkling
<PB N="242" REF="248"/>
of an eye, moulded their minds into
one. From that moment their thoughts,
their desires, their sentiments were the
same. If one made an observation, all
assented: if another declared his opi∣nion,
the rest gave a nod. Good! said
they, behold our disputes and our ill
blood are at an end. Very true: but
are not the charms of conversation at
an end also? no beautiful reflections, no
warm sentiments, sparks of fire struck
out by opposition, enlightening the
mind, chearing the heart, and making
time pass sweetly. <HI>Yes</HI> is now the on∣ly
word: friendship decays, indiffer∣ence
hangs over them like a cloud, and
irksome pass the hours, wont to fly
with a swift pace. Losing all patience,
they fly from each other, and seek with
industry new friendships.</P>

<P>The fox inclining to play the wag

her to dinner, consisting entirely of

soups served up in shallow dishes, which
were without reach of the stork, fur∣ther
than to touch them with the tip of
her bill. The fox, devouring plentiful∣ly,
demanded frequently of his guest how
she liked her entertainment, hoped that
every dish was seasoned to her mind,
and protested his sorrow to see her eat
so sparingly. The stork pretended to
like every dish extremely; and at part∣ing
gave the fox so hearty an invitation
to dine with her, that he could not
in civility refuse. But to his great
mortification, the dinner being compo∣sed
of minced meat, served up in long
narrow-necked glasses, he was tantali∣sed
with the sight of what he had no ac∣cess
to taste. The stork, thrusting in

turned to Reynard, who was eager∣ly
licking the outside of a jar where
some sauce had been spilled,—I am glad,
said she, smiling, that you have so good

<P>The Marquis of Louvois, jealous of
the Marshal de Turenne, did all in his
power secretly to cross his designs.
This jealousy was the main spring of
<PB N="245" REF="251"/>
the misfortunes of France in the cam∣paign
1673. The King saw himself
upon the point of being forsaken by his
allies, and left alone to maintain a war
against the Empire, Spain, and Hol∣land.
The Marshal de Turenne could
not dissemble his uneasiness, and there
appeared in his countenance an air of
thoughtfulness and melancholy. Ha∣ving
returned to court, after putting his
army into winter-quarters, the King re∣ceived
him with great demonstrations
of esteem and affection. His Majesty,
in private, conversed frequently with
him of the means to re-establish affairs
next campaign; and spoke to him one
day of the fatal consequences of Lou∣vois's
counsels; which gave Turenne
a favourable opportunity to revenge
himself of the minister, had he been so
disposed. The Marshal contented him∣self
with answering, “That the Mar∣quis
de Louvois was very capable of
doing his Majesty service in the cabi∣net,
but that he had not experience
enough in war to take upon him the
<PB N="246" REF="252"/>
direction of it.” This moderation
and generosity extremely pleased the
young King, who assured Turenne, that
in spite of all his ministers, he should
always be his favourite. He then spoke
of the Marquis de St Abré, acquaint∣ing
Turenne that St Abré had blamed
his conduct, and written to Louvois,
that if he had been consulted, he could
ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e saved Bonne, without hazarding
Alsace. “Why then did he not speak
to me?” said the Marshal, with
great moderation: “I should have
heard him with pleasure, and profit∣ed
by his advice.” He then excused
St Abré, commended him, gave an ex∣act
account of his services, intreated
the King not to deprive him of so able
a lieutenant-general, and left not the
cabinet till he obtained from the King a
gratuity to him.</P>

But he was pardoned by the interces∣sion

this Quintus Curtius observes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 6. cap. 8.</NOTE>, That

<P>Upon a like occasion, our King Wil∣liam
acted a different part, with general
approbation. After the revolution, let∣ters
were intercepted from the Earl of
Godolphin to the dethroned King. This
was a crime against the state, but not
a crime to be ashamed of. The Earl,
at the same time, was a man of appro∣ved
virtue. These circumstances
prompted the following course. The
King, in a private conference, produ∣ced
the Earl's letters to him; commend∣ed
his zeal for his former master, how∣ever
blind it might be; expressed a
fondness to have the Earl for his friend,
and with the same breath burnt the
<PB N="251" REF="257"/>
letters, that the Earl might not be un∣der
any constraint. This act of gene∣rosity
gained the Earl's heart, and his
faithful services ever after. The cir∣cumstances
here made the Earl certain
of the King's sincerity: at the same
time, the burning of the letters, which
were the only evidence against him,
placed him in absolute security, and
left no motive to action but gratitude
only.</P>

I find, said the loadstone, that you judge

<P>Cyrus one day being reproached by
Croesus for his profusion, a calculation
was made to how much his treasure
<PB N="262" REF="268"/>
might have amounted had he been more
sparing of it. To justify his liberality,
Cyrus sent dispatches to every person he
had particularly obliged, requesting them
to supply him with as much money as
they could, for a pressing occasion, and
to send him a note of what every one
could advance. When all these notes
came to Cyrus, it appeared that the
sum-total far surpssed the calculation
made by Croesus. “I am not,” said
he, “less in love with riches than other
princes; but a better manager of them.
You see at how low a price I have ac∣quired
many friends, an invaluable
treasure. My money, at the same
time, in the hands of these friends, is
not less at my command than in my
treasury.”</P>

<P>A certain rat dwelling near a granary,

at pleasure. It gives no joy to live

that their friendship was to have no end;
and who would suspect such joyous
companions of lying? But this life was
too good to last. The proprietor of the
granary discovered the hole, and closed
it up hard and fast. Our rat being thus
reduced to his shifts, Happily, says he, I
have acquired friends, who will relieve
me in my distress. Knocking at the
door of one of them, he was refused
entrance; and he made the entire round
with no better success. One stranger
rat only, charitably inclined, admitted
him, and treated him as a brother. I
despised, says he, your treasures and
your luxury, but I respect you distress:
be my guest: I have little, but that
little will suffice. I rely upon tempe∣rance;
but foolish he must be who relies

<P>Clodius, Tribune of the Roman
people, bearing resentment against Pro∣lomy
King of Cyprus, obtained a decree
of the people, deposing King Ptolomy,
and confiscating all his goods. His im∣mense
wealth was the prevailing mo∣tive,
without the least colour of justice.
Ptolomy informed of the decree, was
in despair. To resist the Roman power
he was unable, and to be less than a king
he could not bear. Resolving therefore
to make his riches, his life, and his reign,
end together, he put all on shipboard,
and lanched out into the sea, purposing
to sink to the bottom, by boring a hole
in the ship. But at the point of execu∣tion
he turned faint-hearted; not for
himself, but for his dear gold, which
he could not bear to destroy with his
own hands. He returned to land, and
having carefully replaced all in his trea∣sury,
he, with great coolness, put an
end to his life by poison, leaving all his

<P>The Prince of Wales named the <HI>Black
Prince,</HI> who distinguished himself by
his conduct and bravery in the battle of
Poictiers, was not less admired, after
the victory, for his modest and generous
behaviour to his prisoner King John.
<PB N="266" REF="272"/>
The evening after the battle, the Prince
refused to sit down with the King at sup∣per,
but attended him to entertain him
with discourse. As the King's thoughts
were wholly employed about his present
misfortune, the Prince said to him, in a
modest and unaffected manner, “That his
Majesty had one great reason to be com∣forted;
which was, that the battle was
not lost by his fault; that the English,
to their cost, had experienced him to be
the bravest of princes; and that God
alone had disposed of the victory.
And,” continued he, “if Fortune
have been your adversary, you may
at least rest secure, that an inviolable
regard shall be preserved for your per∣son;
and that you shall experience in
me a very respectful relation, if I may
glory in that title.” The King, upon
this, recovering himself, turned to the
Prince, and said, with an air of satisfac∣tion,
“That since it was his destiny to
be vanquished and taken in an action
wherein he had done nothing unbeco∣ming
his character, he found great
<PB N="267" REF="273"/>
comfort in falling into the hands of
the most valiant and generous prince
alive.” It is said, that when King
Edward, father to the Prince, received
the news of this battle, he declared, that
his satisfaction at so glorious a victory
was not comparable to what he had
from the generous behaviour of his son.</P>

<P>A contented country-mouse had once
the honour to receive a visit from an
old acquaintance bred up at court. The
country-mouse, fond to entertain her
guest, set before her the best cheese and
bacon her cottage afforded. If the re∣past
was homely, the welcome was hear∣ty:
they chatted away the evening a∣greeably,
and then retired to rest. The

her leave, kindly pressed her coun∣try-friend
to accompany her; setting
forth in pompous terms the elegance
and plenty in which they lived at court.
They set out together, and though it

was late in the evening when they ar∣rived
at the palace, they found the re∣mains
of a sumptuous entertainment;
plenty of creams, jellies, and sweet∣meats:
the cheese was Parmesan, and
they sok'd their whiskers in exquisite
champaign. But they were not far ad∣vanced
in their repast, when they were
alarmed with the barking and scratching
of a lap-dog. Beginning again, the
mewing of a cat frighted them almost
to death. This was scarce over when a
train of servants bursting into the room,
sweep'd away all in an instant. Ah!

so soon as she received courage to speak,
if your fine living be thus interrupted
with fears and dangers, let me return

<P>A young gentleman in the streets of

being moved, desired a lord of the first
quality to hand them up to him. The
gentlemen finding who he was, blushed,

heels, and braying affectedly, to show his
drollery and good-humour. This un∣usual
behaviour could not sail of raising
much laughter; which being mistaken
by the ass for approbation, he proceed∣ed
to leap upon his master's breast, and
to lick his face very lovingly. But he

<P>When Dion had rescued Syracuse
from slavery, Heraclides his declared e∣nemy
became his humble supplicant for
mercy. Dion was exhorted not to spare
a turbulent and wicked man, who
had brought his country almost to
ruin. Dion answered, “Those who
<PB N="274" REF="280"/>
are bred up to arms seldom think of
any study but that of war. I was
educated in the academy, and my
chief study was, to conquer anger,
revenge, envy, obstinacy, plagues
that corrupt the human heart. The
true test of such victory, is not kind∣ness
to friends and to good men, but
lenity to wicked men that are our
enemies. It is my resolution to o∣vercome
Heraclides, not by power
and prudence, but by humanity. Nor
is any man so perverse or wicked, as
not to yield at length to good treat∣ment.”</P>
<P>Henry Duke of Saxony was by nature
fierce and haughty, eager in his pursuits,
impatient of disappointment or control.
This temper was fostered by bad educa∣tion.
So soon as he could reflect, he
reflected that he was a sovereign, and he
was ever soothed in the notions that a
prince is above all law. At the same
time he was inclined to the principles
of justice and honour, where his passions
<PB N="275" REF="281"/>
did not oppose; and he had a profound
awe for the supreme being, which, by
his wicked life, deviated into supersti∣tion.
The outrages committed by this
prince were without end; every thing
was sacrificed to his lust, cruelty, and
ambition; and at his court, beauty,
riches, honours, became the greatest
misfortunes. His horrid enormities
filled him with suspicion: if a grandee
absented, it was for leisure to form
plots; if he was submissive and obe∣dient,
it was dissimulation merely. Thus
did the prince live wofully solitary, in
the midst of fancied society; at enmity
with every one, and least of all at peace
with himself; sinning daily, repenting
daily; feeling the agonies of reproving
conscience, which haunted him waking,
and left him not when asleep.</P>
<P>In a melancholy fit, under the impres∣sions
of a wicked action recently perpe∣trated,
he dreamed that the tutelar angel
of the country stood before him with
anger in his looks, mixed with some de∣gree
of pity. Ill-fated wretch, said the
<PB N="276" REF="282"/>
apparition, listen to the awful command
I bear. The Almighty, unwilling to
cut thee off in the fulness of iniquity,
has sent me to give thee warning. Up∣on
this the angel reached a scroll of pa∣per,
and vanished. The scroll contain∣ed
the following words, <HI>After six.</HI>
Here the dream ended; for the impres∣sion
it made broke his rest. The prince
awaked in the greatest consternation,
deeply struck with the vision. He was
convinced that the whole was from
God, to prepare him for death; which
he concluded was to happen in six
months, perhaps in six days; and that
this time was allotted him to make his
peace with his maker by an unfeigned re∣pentance
for all his crimes. How idle
and unpleasant seemed now those ob∣jects
which he formerly pursued at the
expence of religion and humanity!
Where is now that lust of command,
which occasioned so much bloodshed;
that cruel malice and envy against every
contending power; that suspicious jea∣lousy,
the cause of much imaginary trea∣son;
<PB N="277" REF="283"/>
furies fostered in his bosom, prey∣ing
incessantly upon his vitals, and yet
darlings of his soul? Happy expulsion,
if not succeeded by the greatest of all
furies, black despair.</P>
<P>Thus, in the utmost torments of
mind, six days, six weeks, and six months
passed away; but death did not follow.
And now he concluded, that six years
were to be the period of his miserable
life. By this time the violence of the
tempest was over. Hitherto he had
sequestered himself from mankind, and
had spent in abstinence and private wor∣ship,
the short time he thought allotted
him. Now began he to form resolu∣tions
of a more thorough repentance;
now was he fixed to do good, as for∣merly
he had done mischief, with all his
heart. The supposed shortness of his
warning had hitherto not left it in his
power to repair the many injuries he
had committed, which was the weigh∣tiest
load upon his mind. Now was he
resolved to make the most ample repa∣ration.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="284"/>
In this state, where hope prevailed,
and some beams of sunshine appeared
breaking through the cloud, he address∣ed
himself to his maker, in the follow∣ing
terms. “O thou glorious and om∣nipotent
being, parent and preserver
of all things! how lovely art thou in
peace and reconciliation! but oh!
how terrible to the workers of ini∣quity!
While my hands are lifted
up, how doth my heart tremble! for
manifold have been my transgressions.
Headlong driven by impetuous pas∣sion,
I deserted the path of virtue,
and wandered through every sort of
iniquity. Trampling conscience un∣der
foot, I surrendered myself to de∣lusions,
which, under the colour of
good, abandoned me still to misery
and remorse. Happy only if at any
moment an offended conscience could
be laid asleep. But what source of
happiness in doing good, and in feel∣ing
the calm sunshine of virtue and
honour! O my conscience! when
thou art a friend, what imports it
<PB N="279" REF="285"/>
who is an enemy? when thou lookest
dreadful, where are they fled, all the
blessings, all the amusements of life?
Thanks to a superabundant mercy,
that hath not abandoned me to repro∣bation,
but hath indulged a longer
day for repentance. Good God! the
lashes of agonizing remorse let me ne∣ver
more feel; be it now my only
concern in this life, to establish with
my conscience a saithful correspond∣ence.
My inordinate passions, those
deluding inchanters, root thou out;
for the work is too mighty for my
weak endeavour. And oh! mould
thou my soul into that moderation of
desire, and just balance of affection,
without which no enjoyment is solid,
no pleasure unmixed with pain. Here∣after
let it not be sufficient to be
quiet and inoffensive; but since gra∣ciously
to my life thou hast added
many days, may all be spent in doing
good; let that day be deemed lost,
which sees me not employed in some
work beneficial to my subjects, or to
<PB N="280" REF="286"/>
mankind; that at last I may lay me
down in peace, comforted if I have
not proved in every respect an unpro∣fitable
servant.”</P>
<P>His first endeavours were, to regain
the confidence of his nobles, and love of
his people. With unremitting applica∣tion
he attended to their good; and
soon felt that satisfaction in considering
himself as their father, which he never
knew when he considered them as his
slaves. N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w began he to relish the
pleasure<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f social intercourse, of which
pride and jealousy had made him hither∣to
insensiblè. He had thought friend∣ship
a chimera, devised to impose upon
mankind. Convinced now of its reali∣ty,
the cultivation of it was one of his
chief objects. Man he found to be a be∣ing
honest and faithful, deserving esteem,
and capable of friendship; hitherto he
had judged of others by the corrupt e∣motions
of his own heart. Well he re∣membered
his many gloomy moments
of disgust and remorse, his spleen and
bad humour, the never-failing attend∣ants
<PB N="281" REF="287"/>
of vice and debauchery. Fearful
to expose his wicked purposes, and
dreading every searching eye, he had e∣stranged
himself from the world; and
what could he expect, conscious as he
was of a depraved heart, but aversion and
horror? Miserable is that state, cut off
from all comfort, in which an unhappy
mortal's chief concern is to fly from
man, because every man is his enemy.
After tasting of this misery, how did he
bless the happy change! Now always
calm and serene, diffusive benevolence
gilded every thought of his heart, and
action of his life. It was now his de∣light
to be seen, and to lay open his
whole soul; for in it dwelt harmony
and peace.</P>
<P>Fame, now his friend, blazed his vir∣tues
all around; and now in distant re∣gions
was the good prince known, where
his vices had never reached. Among
his virtues, an absolute and pure disin∣terestedness
claimed every where the
chief place. In all disputes, he was the
constant mediator betwixt sovereigns,
<PB N="282" REF="288"/>
and betwixt them and their subjects;
and he gained more authority over neigh∣bouring
princes by esteem and reve∣rence,
than they had over their own sub∣jects.</P>
<P>In this manner elapsed the six years,
till the fatal period came. The vision
was fulfilled; but very differently from
what was expected. For at this precise
period, a vacancy happening, he was un∣animously
chosen Emperor of Germany.</P>
