<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>COnsidering the Proverb, That <HI>Too much Mettle is dangerous in a blind Mare</HI>; when the fam'd Author of that idoliz'd piece, <HI>CYDER, A POEM</HI>, first mounted upon the back of <HI>Ambiti∣on</HI>, his chiefest Care should have been to secure the Reins; for I remember the old Jocky <HI>Seneca</HI> says, <HI>Habet hoc vitium omnis Ambitio, non respicit</HI>.</P>
<P>I do not think there is any Work ex∣tant, that hath alarm'd the World more
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
than his; and bin I may say, some years, so much the talk and hopes of the Pub∣lick; especially those under his own <HI>Me∣ridian</HI>; Nor indeed has it fail'd in giving great Satisfaction, being generally cares∣sed with that fondness, which almost de∣serves the Name of <HI>Dotage</HI>: Thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Success is not so wonderful, if we be∣lieve the Poet, That
<Q>Expectation makes the Blessing dear.</Q></P>
<P>And if we observe, It had not only the Advantage of being introduc'd un∣der the Umbrage of <HI>Milton</HI>; but came also flying upon the Wings of <HI>Fame</HI>▪ not to mention the many <HI>Heroes</HI> who were summoned to defend it.</P>
<P>Wherein all its Beautys consist, is not obvious, I dare presume, to every Reader; It being in many places made Artificially dark, to prevent every com∣mon Understanding from peeping into the Bottom of it; but such is the Genius of this Age, to admire <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Novelty</HI>▪
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
That they have now raised the Author to the highest Class in the <HI>Muses</HI> School; Nor will he need any future <HI>Apotheosis</HI>, to immortalize his Name, as long as <HI>CY∣DER A POEM</HI>, lies securely bound in Sheeps-skin; For we may take notice, That notwithstanding he falls so far short, both of the <HI>Diction</HI>, and <HI>Harmony</HI> of <HI>Milton</HI>; yet he is addressed with the Title of being his <HI>Poetical Son</HI>, as <HI>Milton</HI> was of <HI>Spencer</HI>, tho' there indeed the <HI>Son</HI> ex∣ceeded the <HI>Father</HI>, and the Copy out∣shone the Original: But however, there are, I make no question, who breaking out into Wonderful <HI>Interjections</HI>; disdain not to say, he was Out-vied by them both; and this is easily conjectur'd, when we find some Persons have so far <HI>Apostatiz'd</HI> to Worship him, as the <HI>Numen Commune</HI>, even in C—sts C—ch; whilst others have sung his <HI>Nugae Canorae</HI> about, as the <HI>Grecians</HI> did the Works of <HI>Homer</HI>, at their Village Feasts.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6"/>Now I would not be thought fond of traducing his Performance, any far∣ther than I could compel his Humility to acknowledge, how much he has fallen short of <HI>Milton</HI>; and what he stands In∣debted to <HI>Virgil</HI> for his many Embellish∣ments; who has been all along the Prop of his Fancy, and whom he as carefully follows, as a Blind Man does his Dog in a String; So that <HI>Invention</HI> which is one of the greatest Blessings to a Poet, is not so peculiarly his <HI>Talent</HI>.</P>
<P>As for the professing himself a <HI>Votary</HI> to <HI>Milton</HI>'s Muse, I greatly fear he will be Superanuated, before he can attain to his Proficiency, for by a little Compa∣rison we soon may find a Difference; Nor can I think the best Doctor of <HI>Musick</HI> round the <HI>Theatre</HI>, will affirm their being tuned in <HI>Ʋnison</HI>; and therefore without much Offence he may be Challeng'd in the Words of <HI>Menalcas</HI> to <HI>Damae∣tas</HI>.</P>
<Q><PB N="vii" REF="7"/>

<P>Tho' to do Justice; a little allowance must be made him, because sometime <HI>Milton</HI> sung darkly, as it is reported, from the Name of <HI>Homer</HI>, that he did; But this our Author never was so happy, to enjoy the lucid Intervals of a dark Man, and that I might satisfie him I have not the least ill Will towards his exceeding both those Worthy Poets, if his Friends, especially those of the <HI>Quadrangle, inter alios</HI>, a Gentleman that has an <HI>endless store of Ʋniversal Knowledge</HI>; approve of it for his Good, I'll send him a Needle for the purpose, that he may afford us the plea∣sure, to hear one Tune from him, like a Blind <HI>Bull finch</HI>; and that he may not
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
be deterr'd from the Experiment, I dare warrant, upon putting a certain <HI>Knight</HI> of my acquaintance into his next Poem, that he will undertake to restore his Eyes, al∣though they should rowl in vain for twen∣ty years together; But to proceed be∣tween our Author and <HI>Virgil</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sheepwash</HI> being one of a profound penetration observes; That the <HI>Cut</HI> be∣fore the Title Page of the <HI>Anonymous</HI> Book upon <HI>Cyder</HI>, being the very same with that placed before the second <HI>Georgic</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI>, intimates something of a Design, that the <HI>Author</HI> would insinuate his, to bear the same Name; whereas (says he) it be∣ing baptized <HI>Miltonian Verse</HI>, The <HI>Sculp∣ture</HI> before <HI>Paradise lost</HI> had been more proper; and then the most Judicious Mr. <HI>Sheepwash</HI> very smartly took notice, That there were no <HI>Apples</HI> upon <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Trees, but <HI>Oak-Apples</HI>; Nor could I per∣swade, him they made the best <HI>Cyder</HI>; but however, to excuse the Matter as well as I could; I inform'd him that the <HI>Author</HI>
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
(it might be) was a very bashful Gentle∣man, and could not endure to see the Picture of <HI>Eve</HI> Naked, without falling into a Fit; And then said I; The De∣vil said I; Crawling, said I; under one of the Apple-Trees, said I; was a Sight too odious and intollerable, for the Eyes of a Righteous Man; and as for the Tree of <HI>Knowledge</HI>, he had no man∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of Business with it; But these were only Mr. <HI>Sheepwash</HI>'s Observations.</P>
<P>Yet I cannot but say in deference to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Author, as being a Man of all parts <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Speech, That since he has taken such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eat Pains to copy after <HI>Virgil</HI>, as I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave done my self the Honour to copy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter him, especially his 40 and 43d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages; That his two Books were high∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deserving the Name of <HI>Georgies</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd if I might be thought worthy to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vise poor <HI>Jacob Tonson</HI>, because of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat Charge and Family, if it were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en Years before the next Edition <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes out, to have a Glorious Title
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>
Page added to it, beginning, <HI>Two Spick and Span new Georgies, in Imitation of</HI> Virgil, <HI>Written in Miltonian Verse</HI>; and then I'll engage for the Sale.</P>
<P>But now, least it may be thought<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> flatter the Author, because he is a Gen∣tleman of some Substance and Figure having Land within a Mile of <HI>Pernas∣sus</HI>, and a great <HI>Copia Verborum</HI> of his own to Stock it; I will put down the beginning of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s two <HI>Georgie</HI>'s, and let the Learned Reader compare them with the <HI>Miltonian</HI> ones, for Example▪ <HI>Virgil</HI> begins his First
<Q><L>Quid faciat Laetas Segetes: quo sidere terram</L>
<L>Vertere—</L>
<BIBL><HI>Georg. 1. lin. 12</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And then a little after
<Q><L>Hinc canere incipiam. Vos, ô clarissim mund<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>Lumina,—</L>
<BIBL><HI>Id. lin. 5, 6<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="11"/>Only our Authors <HI>Clarissima Lumina mundi</HI>, are the <HI>Ariconian</HI> Knights, and fai∣rest Dames, and then as <HI>Virgil</HI> proceeds,
<Q><L>—Tuque ô cui prima frementem</L>
<L>Fudit equum magno tellus percussa tridenti,</L>
<L>Neptune:—</L>
<BIBL><HI>Id. lin. 12, 13.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P><HI>Cyder</HI> goes on in the very same Tune, <HI>And thou O</HI> Mostyn <HI>whose Benevolence</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But certainly, after all; methinks those Gentlemen and Ladies, are very little be∣holding to him for paying his Debts of Charity, since <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Gods were the first Motives to his Gratitude; yet I can hardly forbear thinking; that he raises <HI>Encomiums</HI> on all that Train of Nobility and Gentry, only to put him∣self under their Protection, and if so, he is very Extravagant; to covet such a Number of <HI>Patrons</HI>, when even <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI>, contented themselves with but one <HI>Maecenas</HI>; I cannot but
<PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
take Notice of it, because having so ma∣ny Friends to visit, he affords us but little of his Company in the <HI>Orchat</HI>, and and then he is in such a roving Temper, that we can hardly enjoy him above a Page or two, before he makes some other ramble, by which we may perceive the Spirit of <HI>Cyder</HI> is very <HI>Volatil</HI>; though ten to one but he justifies himself from the Authority of <HI>Homer</HI>, who takes up great part of his Second Book in flatter∣ing his Country-men.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> in his Second Book still waits assiduously upon <HI>Virgil</HI>; but is so mannerly not to follow too close at his Heels, for <HI>Virgil</HI> begins his Second <HI>Geor∣gie</HI>:
<Q><L>Hactenus arvorum cultus, &amp; Sidera Caeli:</L>
<L>Nunc te Bacche canam—</L>
<BIBL><HI>Geor. 2. lin. 1.2.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>But our new <HI>Maro</HI>, having another <HI>Maecenas</HI> and his Son upon his Hands, must first Coaks a little, Nay, even there
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
I find he is infinitely obliged to <HI>Virgil</HI>, for the most lively Complement or Fan∣cy, who speaking to <HI>Bacchus</HI> says,
<Q><L>—Tibi pampineo gravidus autumno</L>
<L>Floret ager, spumat plenis vindemia labris.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Id. lin. 5, 6.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And thus our Author accosting the young Gentleman, came by his <HI>S— Lo! for thee my Mill</HI>
<Q><L>Now grinds choice Apples, and the <HI>British</HI> Vats,</L>
<L>Overflow with generous Cyder—</L>
<BIBL><HI>Cyd. Fol. 51.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Which is almost a literal Translation, only <HI>mutatis mutandis</HI>; and then after tel∣ing every Body, that he has sent him the Book beyond Seas, which I suppose the young Gentleman is to make his Companion in his Travels, as <HI>Alexander</HI> did the Works of <HI>Homer</HI>, in his long March from <HI>Macedon</HI> to <HI>India</HI>, he goes on like <HI>Virgil</HI>.</P>
<Q><PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>
<P>Thus far of Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<BIBL>Id. fol. 51.</BIBL></Q>
<P>But now I shall hasten to <HI>Milton</HI> on∣ly I recommend the 36, 37, 38, 39, 40▪ 41, 42, 43, and 44 Pages of his Poem▪ to all those Gentlemen who are knock∣ing at the Gate of Preferment; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mr. <HI>L—y</HI> Mr. <HI>F—o</HI> Sir <HI>R—o B—y</HI>, or Dr. <HI>B—d</HI>, are desirous to augment the Number of their Inspir'd the Author in his 60th Page has taken care they may be supply'd with those who are of <HI>Times Intelligent</HI>, and ne∣ver speak but infallible Truths.</P>
<P>But to Conclude, and that I may an∣ticipate all Suspicion of being to nice in my Relish, I must confess some part o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Author's Entertainment is very a∣greeable; and though one Dish is il<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dress'd, yet another is better, like the Ta∣ble set out in <HI>Terence</HI>.</P>

<L>Preserv'd their well-fram'd Constitution pure;</L>
<L>Soon from this warm well cultivated Bed</L>
<L>Letters came forward, Sense began to spread,</L>
<L>And Wit shot up apace its thriving Head.</L>
<L>The Languid Muses, now, new Life acquire,</L>
<L>And every Genius feels his native Fire.</L>
<L>The chearful Bards their weekly Work reherse,</L>

<L>But soon the Flood, that with reluctance past,</L>
<L>To hear the charming Lays return'd in hast.</L>
<L>Their Conversation fed their mutual Flame,</L>
<L>And made their Bards at Flights much higher Aim.</L>
<L>For Men of Wit do Men of Wit inspire,</L>
<L>And Emulation strikes out nobler Fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean time these Sons of Wit advanc'd their Name▪</L>
<L>And fair <HI>Augusta</HI> rung with <HI>Kit-Cat</HI>'s Fame;</L>
<L>Their brighter Beams Eclypse the fading Toast,</L>
<L>That long before unrival'd rul'd the Roast.</L>
<L>Now Crowds to Founder <HI>BOCAJ</HI> did resort,</L>
<L>And for his Favour humbly made their Court;</L>
<L>The little Wits attended at his Gate,</L>
<L>And Men of Title did his Leve wait.</L>
<L>For he as Sovereign, by Prerogative</L>
<L>Old Members did exclude, and new receive.</L>
<L>He judg'd who most were for the Order fit,</L>
<L>And Chapters held, to make new Knights of Wit.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Kit-Cat</HI> Wits to their first Maxims true,</L>
<L>Not of high Station, and in Number few,</L>
<L>Did Wit's just Rights and Interests pursue.</L>

<L>Flat was the Wine, and tastless was the Chear</L>

<L>But who can flourish long, and raise no envious Foes?</L>
<L>As when new States Industrious, frugal, wise,</L>
<L>By a swift growth to Strength and Wealth arise,</L>

<L>IN Days of <HI>Yore</HI>, when Vertue was in Vogue,</L>
<L>And Folks disdain'd the Name of <HI>Whore</HI> and <HI>Rogue</HI>▪</L>
<L><HI>Conduct</HI> was thought a necessary Evil</L>
<L>To save a foolish Sinner from the Devil:</L>
<L>For tho' with Scorn, the World such Ridicule,</L>
<L>Yet this affected wise One is the Fool;</L>
<L>Who misapplies his Passions, Love or Hate;</L>
<L>Or whatsoe'er he does, comes out of Date;</L>
<L>For 'tis not Pride, but Folly rules his Fate.</L>
<L>His nat'ral Vanity is always such,</L>
<L>He either does too little, or too much.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor walks one foot alone, without his Mate,</L>
<L>That can as noisy and as empty prate:</L>
<L>Ev'ry Coquet can now her Author quote,</L>

<L>Their wit is like their Cloaths, gravely and slight,</L>
<L>That pleases not the Ear, nor these the Sight.</L>
<L>Their softning Arts, unthinking Fops beguile,</L>
<L>But cannot make the Stoick deign to smile.</L>
<L>For who can laugh at such prepost'rous Vice,</L>

<HEAD>The PEFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A Preface</HI> to a <HI>Satyr</HI> of this kind, may perhaps look▪ very odd among our new-fangl'd Quality, with whom nothing will relish, but what is gay and modish; for Vanity has got the Ascendant over their Virtue, good Nature, and Compassion: So that one Acquaintance will not bow to another, if the Advan∣tage lies on either side, especially if one be on Foot, and the other is mounted, as he imagines, in his tri∣umphal Chariot: But it would look more strange, if it was not conformable to the Mode of the Times; for if Gentlemen are never such dear Companions now, they must have no Conversation together, but upon equal terms, least some should say to the Man of Fi∣gure, <HI>Bless me, Sir! what strange filthy Fellow was that you bow'd to parading in the</HI> Mall, <HI>as you was driving to the</HI> Ring? I wonder any body will de∣mean themselves so much as to converse with dirty Peo∣ple that walk on Foot. A Gentleman should never be seen in the Street out of a Chair or a Coach; I do not mean a filthy Hackney-Coach, which is enough to make a Man that consults his Appetite, puke in a Morning; for 'tis Nicety in Taste that distinguishes a Man of Parts.</P>
<P>No Person can ever lay Claim to Wit and fine think∣ing, that does not lie soft a Nights, wear clean Lin∣nen a days, and eat with a peculiar kind of Delicacy at all times; for these things are as necessary to the forming of a bright Genius, as clean Straw and Chalk are to the whitening the Flesh of an <HI>Essex</HI> Calf. And
<PB N="4" REF="213"/>
as this Curiosity ought to be observ'd in our Diet, so it ought more particularly to be regarded in our Man∣ners, especially that part which tends to good Breed∣ing; which is the Reason the fair Sex so far outdo us in Punctillio's, the very Essence of Education; for I have heard of a Lady, whose Nicety prevail'd over her Inclinations so much, that she would scarce allow her self the Benefits of Nature, least they should de∣file the Purity of her Imaginations, and make her break thro' the Decorum of good Manners.

<L>Heavy and dull, like that moist Planet, now</L>
<L>The sprightly Wits and active Heroes grow;</L>
<L>The wat'ry Flegm lies floating in the Brain,</L>

<L>Othes come here to please their Appetites,</L>

<L><HI>Horatio</HI> round the splended Circle flies,</L>

<L>For what we gain with ease, we most despise.</L>

<L>Such diff'rent things our Inclination guide,</L>

<L>But <HI>Ratcliff</HI>'s must a-like with <HI>Garth</HI>'s prove Fools.</L>
<L>Satyr, look here, with more discerning Eyes,</L>
<L>Where Goldon Dust does from the City rise,</L>
<L>That triumphs boldly in th' Olympick Prize.</L>
<L><HI>Gouerius</HI> shines with most exalted Pride,</L>
<L>Because he's honour'd with a noble Bride;</L>
<L>The Pageant-Painting like a Lord-May'r's Show,</L>
<L>Deck'd out with Maiden Queen and mimick Beau,</L>
<L>Let's the Spectator quickly understand,</L>
<L>The Owner wants no Mony, and no Land;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="219"/>But thus profusely fine, can scarcely tell,</L>
<L>Whether he is a Man or Angel, well:</L>
<L>For rais'd above the crowd, with pompous train</L>
<L>He thinks his equal to a Monarch's Reign.</L>
<L>The indulgent Culls of late are grown so kind,</L>
<L>They always for their Vanity Excuses find;</L>
<L>Seldom to <HI>Park</HI> the good-natur'd Ninny drives,</L>
<L>But pleads, thus we must do to please our Wives;</L>
<L>When th' odds are very great, whether or no</L>
<L>You ever see the Dowdy with the Beau:</L>
<L>But if a Belle the Ape is fond to play,</L>

<L>She is a Saint, tho' others think an <HI>Eve</HI>.</L>
<L>With him she scorns to visit Plays or <HI>Park</HI>;</L>
<L>But rather there, than meet him in the Dark.</L>
<L>The Conquet does in ev'ry thing prevail,</L>
<L>Tho' all Men know her Art and Beauty stale;</L>
<L>But in the <HI>Ring</HI> she always will be seen</L>
<L>In various Colours, Yellow, Red, and Green,</L>
<L>And like her Horses, skinny, old, and lean.</L>
<L>No gaudy Tulip in the Month of <HI>May</HI>,</L>
<L>Smells half so rank, or dresses half so gay.</L>
<L><HI>Mutia</HI>'s a Widow, solemn looks and grave,</L>
<L>But yet would fain a second Venture have,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="220"/>Before her Daughters, who are all full grown,</L>
<L>Among the ramping six, can meet with one.</L>
<L>The Fault is theirs, perhaps the Maids are shy,</L>
<L>And will not, as some do, their Husbands buy;</L>
<L>Or take up, as some Widows have thought best,</L>
<L>With a young Rake, or else a brawny Priest.</L>
<L><HI>Mutias</HI>'s more modest, by her Liv'ry known,</L>
<L>A Non-Con-Gray, or else a Russet-Brown.</L>
<L><HI>Manlius</HI> thro' all the City does proclaim</L>
<L>His Arms, his Equipage, and ancient Name;</L>
<L>For search the Court of Honour, and you'll see</L>
<L><HI>Manlius</HI> his Name, but not his Pedigree.</L>
<L>What then? This is the Practice of the Town,</L>
<L>For should no Man bear Arms, but what's his own,</L>
<L>Hundreds that make the <HI>Ring</HI>, would carry none:</L>
<L>And that would spoil the Beauty of the Place,</L>
<L>For Scutcheons show Antiquity and Race;</L>
<L>Which ev'ry one have right to that come here,</L>
<L>As Soldiers have to Arms, that go to War.</L>
<L>This is th' Olympick-Field; he wins the Prize,</L>
<L>That dazles most the fair Spectators Eyes.</L>
<L>Here young <HI>Furnesio</HI>, like his Father vain,</L>
<L>Without the Purchase would the Conquest gain;</L>
<L>With tawdry Dress, for great and noble pass,</L>
<L>As with the Lyon's Skin once did the Ass;</L>
<L>But, spite of all his Politicks appears</L>
<L>Unluckily to his Disgrace, his Ears.</L>
<L>Just so the fancy'd Equipage will show</L>
<L>The Judgment and the Choice from whence they flow.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="221"/>Liv'ries sometimes afford a decent Grace,</L>
<L>That are not trimm'd with Gold or Silver Lace:</L>
<L>But who in Bays and Worsted would appear</L>
<L>Ingeniously genteel, must copy here.</L>
<L><HI>Gazus</HI> and <HI>Lycius</HI> long have been enroll'd</L>
<L>In the bright <HI>Circus</HI>, and their Stories told:</L>
<L>What Conquests they have made, what Triumphs won,</L>
<L>How often round the Olympick-Circle run,</L>
<L>The Prizes they have gain'd, how many Nymphs un∣done.</L>
<L>Tell now, my Muse, what Wonders thou hast seen,</L>
<L>What heaps of Chariot-Wheels thick crowding in,</L>
<L>To scour the dusty Plain, or beat the flow'ry Green.</L>
<L>Contend for Victory, which should exceed</L>
<L>The noblest Chariot, or the noblest Steed.</L>
<L>The Gilding, Carving, or the brightest Glass,</L>
<L>The fairest Periwig, or fairest Face.</L>
<L>The richest Clothing, or the nicest Shape,</L>
<L>The best Retinue, or the greatest Ape.</L>
<L>Nor are the beauteous Sex excluded here,</L>
<L>As anciently in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> they were,</L>
<L>But may contend ro win the glorious Prize,</L>
<L>Gain'd by their Dress, more often then their Eyes.</L>
<L>Here Heads 'gainst Heads are drawn up in Array,</L>
<L>When careless Negligence shall win the Day;</L>
<L>Hoods against Hoods, and Ribbons singly prove</L>
<L>The Colour which conduces most to love;</L>
<L>Ev'n Handkerchiefs are Ensigns now of War,</L>
<L>At once attract our Eyes, and guard the Fair,</L>
<L>Thus glitt'ring Ornaments most deeply wound,</L>
<L>And dart us thro', as hurry'd swiftly round.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="222"/>Just like the heated Wheels, the Heart grows warm,</L>
<L>And struggling Nature sucks in ev'ry Charm;</L>
<L>Lab'ring for Breath, instead of cooling Air,</L>
<L>We draw in Poyson, cast out by the Fair.</L>
<L>Contagious this, Men frantick grow, and mad,</L>
<L>And here forget the Reason once they had.</L>
<L><HI>Cymander</HI> thus, from a plain home-spun Clown,</L>
<L>Is now become the errant'st Rake in Town,</L>
<L>And dazles with a splendid Show, the <HI>Ring</HI>,</L>
<L>Tho' like the Bat at Twilight he come in:</L>
<L>For 'tis enough <HI>Cymander</HI> has been there,</L>
<L>To boast of Favours, and to toast the Fair:</L>
<L>Well skill'd in Heraldry, he vaunts his Arms</L>
<L>Have more Admirers, than <HI>Serinda</HI>'s Charms;</L>
<L>Tho' in a Hack he loves a gen'rous She,</L>
<L>He hates the nauseous Airs of Quality.</L>
<L>Freedom and Liberty is what he seeks,</L>
<L>And downright Bawdy chiefly what he speaks.</L>
<L>In short, to make his Character compleat,</L>
<L>All Rakish Vices singly in him meet.</L>
<L><HI>Volubius</HI> has a nice and courtly Mein,</L>
<L>That seldom is but with Decorum seen,</L>
<L>Hates gaudy Colours, but affects much Green.</L>
<L>His House, his Coach, his Equipage, his Wife,</L>
<L>Must bear his Badge. To draw him to the Life,</L>
<L>How strangely we're in Love with Colours grown?</L>
<L>For House-Painting, <HI>Marlb'rough</HI> is only known;</L>
<L>But for our Vices, we have really none.</L>
<L>This is a happy Age, when Vice may naked walk,</L>
<L>And Vertue only wants the' informing Cloak.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="223"/>That <HI>Virgius</HI> gives, not out of modish Whim,</L>
<L>But for a Cue, that others follow him</L>
<L>In Russet-Brown, and well chose Orange-Trim.</L>
<L>He that would to the Top Court-Fashion go,</L>
<L>Must not in flanting Lace assume the Beau,</L>
<L>But chuse grave Colours, fac'd with Red, or so.</L>
<L>These decently apply'd with harmless plain,</L>
<L>And six rare Steeds to stretch the silken Rein,</L>
<L>Will win the noblest Prize there set to view,</L>
<L>Before the Green, the Yellow, or the Blue.</L>
<L>Not but <HI>Severus</HI> has much Honour gain'd,</L>
<L>And long the Glory of the Field maintain'd,</L>
<L>Since Grandeur from Nobility will shine,</L>
<L>And make the Heirs confess their noble Line,</L>

<L>To those that merit, and to those that want.</L>

<L>The bounteous Gifts that from true Merit flow.</L>
<L>This don't in outward Equipage appear,</L>

<L>HAdst thou like other Sirs and Knights of Worth,</L>
<L>Sickned and dy'd, been stretch out, and laid forth,</L>
<L>After thy farewel Sermon taken Earth,</L>
<L>And left no Deed to praise thee, but thy Birth;</L>

<L>Then had we worn the Sprigs of Memory</L>

<L>But since it was so ordered and thought fit</L>
<L>By some who knew thy Truth, and fear'd thy Wit,</L>
<L>Thou shouldst be poyson'd, Death hath done thee Grace,</L>
<L>Rankt thee above the Regions of the Place,</L>

<L>IF I were to chuse a Woman,</L>

<L>First, to make my Choice the bolder,</L>

<L>Therefore to prevent such Care</L>
<L>That Repentance soon may bring,</L>

<L>Useful, good, not glittering.</L>
<L>He that weds for State or Face,</L>

The first only absolutely good: The other being built upon the first, likewise become so. Then the Application of that Woman by Love to himself, which makes her a Wife. And lastly, the only Condition of a Wife, Fitness.</P>

<HEAD>A WIFE.</HEAD>
<L>EACH Woman is a Brief of Womankind,</L>
<L>And doth in little even as much contain,</L>
<L>As in one Day and Night all Life we find,</L>
<L>Of either, More, is but the same again:</L>
<L>God fram'd her so, that to her Husband she,</L>
<L>As <HI>Eve</HI>, should all the <HI>World of Woman be</HI>.</L>
<L>So fram'd he both, that neither Power he gave</L>
<L>Use of themselves, but by Exchange to make:</L>
<L>Whence in their Face the Fair no Pleasure have,</L>
<L>But by Reflex of what thence other take.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="234"/>Our Lips in their own Kiss no Pleasure find:</L>
<L>Toward their proper Face our Eyes are blind.</L>

<L>In <HI>Adam</HI>, God created only one,</L>
<L><HI>Eve</HI> and the World to come, in <HI>Eve</HI> he made.</L>

<L><HI>Adam</HI> was <HI>Eve</HI>'s, <HI>Eve</HI> Mother of Mankind,</L>

<L>One thus made Two, Marriage doth re-unite,</L>
<L>And makes them both but one <HI>Hermaphrodite</HI>.</L>
<L>Man did but the well-being of this Life</L>
<L>From Woman take; her Being she from Man:</L>

<L>Marriage; to all whose Joys two Parties be,</L>

<L>Wherein the very Act is Chastity,</L>
<L>Whereby two Souls into one Body go.</L>
<L>Which makes two One, while here they living be,</L>
<L>And after Death in their Posterity.</L>
<L>God to each Man a private Woman gave,</L>

<L>Natur eis God's, Art is Man's Instrument.</L>
<L>Now all Man's Art but only dead things makes,</L>
<L>But herein Man in things of Life partakes.</L>
<L>For wand'ring Lust; I know 'tis infinite,</L>
<L>It still begins, and adds not more to more.</L>
<L>The Guilt is everlasting, the delight,</L>
<L>This instant doth not feel, of that before.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="235"/>The Taste of it is only in the Sense,</L>

<L>My self I cannot chuse, my Wife I may:</L>

<L>Or rather let me Love, than be in love</L>

<L>Short even of Pictures, shorter liv'd the Life,</L>
<L>And yet the Love survives, that's built thereon:</L>

<HEAD>To the Free-born Reader.</HEAD>
<P>WHoever hath already read, or will yet give himself the Trouble of reading Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI>'s <HI>Utopia</HI>, may at once easily understand both the Motive to the Writing of this <HI>Canto</HI>, and the Meaning or Drift of what is written, in Imitation of so Great a Man, at this Juncture of Affairs.</P>
<P>The main Burden of his Book indeed seems to be for taking away all <HI>Property</HI>, and levelling or laying Things in <HI>common</HI>, upon an imeginary Regulation of <HI>Govern∣ment</HI>: But our <HI>Birds</HI> here sing of another Establishment in <HI>Utopia</HI>, as strange and wonderful; which has some∣thing more of Reality in it, than mere Fancy, Fiction, or Romance.</P>
<P>He has not told us in what Part of the World his <HI>U∣topia</HI> was situated; but we need not go to the <HI>Antipodes</HI>, to find whereabouts, and in what Latitude <HI>ours</HI> lies, tho' not to be found in the Map; not far from the <HI>Streights</HI> Mouth, we may imagine, or between <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis</HI>.</P>
<P>'Tis natural both for Man and Beast to love his own native Country best. Ought not I to prefer my old Acquaintance, my old Friends, or even my old Shoes, (that King <HI>James</HI> the Ist said were easiest for his Feet) before Strangers, Sharpers, and Intruders; Hoghen-Moghens, <HI>Hugonots</HI>, and Wooden Shoe-makers? In a Word, can any one of Sense and Reason, be so barba∣rous to his own Bowels, as to undervalue, undermine and undo his natural-fellow-free-born Subjects, for any interloping <HI>Canary-Birds</HI>, or naturaliz'd Foreigners? I so, the wise <HI>Ʋtopians</HI> then must degenerate.</P>
<P>However, this is a Kind of Doggrel Poem; and ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I do not rival the inimitable <HI>Hudibras</HI>: But I hope i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may pass for Burlesque, Travesty, or jingling Rhim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at least, among our native People.

<HEAD>CANARY-BIRDS Naturaliz'd.</HEAD>
<L>IN our unhappy Days of <HI>Yore</HI>,</L>
<L>When foreign <HI>Birds</HI>, from <HI>German</HI> Shore,</L>
<L>Came flocking to <HI>Utopia</HI>'s Coast,</L>
<L>And o'er the Country rul'd the Roast;</L>
<L>Of our good People, did two Thirds</L>
<L>So much admire <HI>Canary-Birds</HI>,</L>
<L>For outward Show, or finer Feathers,</L>
<L>Far more regarded than all others.</L>
<L>We bought 'em dear, and fed 'em well,</L>
<L>'Till they began for to rebel.</L>
<L>Unsatisfy'd, they did resort,</L>
<L>For greater Liberty, to Court,</L>
<L>And equal Privilege would claim,</L>
<L>Or with the Natives much the same;</L>
<L>As if no Birth-right had been given</L>
<L>To our own <HI>Birds</HI> from unkind Heaven.</L>
<L>A loud <HI>Canary</HI> then did sing,</L>
<L>And make a Noise like any King,</L>
<L>Or some usurping vainer Thing;</L>
<L>And still the Burden of its Song,</L>
<L>Was, to be <HI>Nat'ral'd</HI>, right ot wrong.</L>
<L>The rest, at this, set up their Throats</L>
<L>As shrill with <HI>Nat'ralizing</HI> Notes.</L>
<L>So num'rous were their fond Allies,</L>
<L>They pierc'd the high and mighty Skies,</L>
<L>'Till with the Force of ecchoing Bill,</L>
<L>They did our feather'd Nation fill.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="275"/>Here they grew fat, and liv'd at Ease,</L>
<L>And bigger look'd than <HI>Refugees</HI>;</L>
<L>Kindly protected from the Stroke</L>
<L>Of swift persuing <HI>Gallick</HI> Hawk.</L>
<L>Them we so well did entertain,</L>
<L>They would not choose go Home again,</L>
<L>But now at last so sawcy grew,</L>
<L>That to aspiring Heights they flew:</L>
<L>They must be topping Masters made,</L>
<L>And, as our free-born Subjects, trade.</L>
<L>On this Account, <HI>assembl'd</HI> were</L>
<L>The native <HI>Birds</HI> of all the Air;</L>
<L>And having laid their Heads together,</L>
<L>Advising and debating, whether</L>
<L>Those bold <HI>Canary-Birds</HI> should stay,</L>
<L>And nat'ralized be this Day</L>
<L>Through all disturb'd <HI>Utopia</HI>.</L>

<L>And far le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s pow'rful than the <HI>Bank</HI>,</L>
<L>Both Men and Money still ingrossing,</L>

<L>'That we these Foreigners may fear?</L>

<L>'They never go to Church, as I,</L>

<L>We shall be reckon'd very fickle,</L>

<L>Where there are no harmonious Lays,</L>
<L>Transported with our Maker's Praise▪</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="276"/>So loyal <HI>Red-breast</HI> did conclude</L>
<L>Their deep Design was nothing good;</L>
<L>Not Peace, Division understood.</L>
<L>The chirping <HI>Sparrow</HI> next began;</L>
<L>'These proud Intruders sure ne'er can</L>
<L>'Expect so great a Liberty,</L>
<L>'To live as nat'ral Subjects, free!</L>
<L>'This Condscension is too much</L>
<L>'To gratify or <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI>;</L>
<L>'For such <HI>Canary-Birds</HI>, my Fear's,</L>

<L>'Or in our Nation breed ill Blood</L>

<L>'Let's not defile our own dear Nest,</L>

<L>'That would us to their Lure betray.</L>
<L>The charming <HI>Linnet</HI> then besought</L>
<L>His Brother <HI>Birds</HI> to weigh this Thought.</L>
<L>He wisely said, and sweetly sung,</L>
<L>And with a pop'lar Air it rung:</L>
<L>'Whether they could believe it Reason,</L>
<L>'To nat'ralize them at this Season,</L>
<L>'When our own Traders hardly live,</L>
<L>'And scarce industrious Workers thrive?</L>
<L>'For tho' they sing a merry Note,</L>
<L>'They are perhaps not worth a Groat.</L>
<L>'And why should we <HI>infranchise</HI> those</L>
<L>'That Strangers come, and whence God knows?</L>
<L>'Or give such Rights to foreign Breasts,</L>
<L>''Till we have feather'd our own Nests?</L>
<L>'They'll underlive and sell us too,</L>

<L>'Like <HI>Cucko's</HI>, bring a spurious Brood;</L>

<L>RAsh Author, 'tis a vain presumptuous Crime</L>
<L>To undertake the Sacred Art of Rhyme;</L>
<L>If at thy Birth the Stars that rul'd thy Sence</L>
<L>Shone not with a Poetic Influence:</L>
<L>In thy strait Genius thou wilt still be bound,</L>
<L>Find <HI>Phoebus</HI> deaf, and <HI>Pegasus</HI> unsound.</L>
<L>You then, that burn with the desire to try</L>
<L>The dangerous Course of charming Poetry;</L>
<L>Forbear in frutless Verse to lose your time,</L>
<L>Or take for Genius the desire of Rhyme:</L>
<L>Fear the allurements of a specious Bait,</L>
<L>And well consider your own Force and Weight.</L>
<L>Nature abounds in Wits of every kind,</L>
<L>And for each Author can a Talent find:</L>
<L>One may in Verse describe an Amorous Flame,</L>
<L>Another sharpen a short Epigram:</L>

<L>What-e're you write of Pleasant or Sublime,</L>
<L>Always let sense accompany your Rhyme:</L>
<L>Falsely they seem each other to oppose;</L>
<L>Rhyme must be made with Reason's Laws to close:</L>
<L>And when to conquer her you bend your force,</L>
<L>The Mind will Triumph in the Noble Course;</L>
<L>To Reason's yoke she quickly will incline,</L>
<L>Which, far from hurting, renders her Divine:</L>
<L>But, if neglected, will as easily stray,</L>
<L>And master Reason, which she should obey.</L>
<L>Love Reason then: and let whate'er you Write</L>
<L>Borrow from her its Beauty, Force, and Light.</L>
<L>Most Writers, mounted on a resty Muse,</L>
<L>Extravagant, and Senceless Objects chuse;</L>
<L>They Think they err, if in their Verse they fall</L>
<L>On any thought that's Plain, or Natural:</L>
<L>Fly this excess; and let <HI>Italians</HI> be</L>
<L>Vain Authors of false glitt'ring Poetry.</L>
<L>All ought to aim at Sence; but most in vain</L>
<L>Strive the hard Pass, and slipp'ry Path to gain.</L>
<L>You drown, if to the right or left you stray;</L>
<L>Reason to go has often but one way.</L>
<L>Sometimes an Author, fond of his own Though<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</L>
<L>Pursues his Object till it's over-wrought:</L>

<HEAD>Moral REFLEXIONS on the foregoing Dialogue.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW happy is that God-like Man;</L>
<L>Who can forgive Offences,</L>
<L>And wink at such and odious Stain,</L>
<L>That startles human Senses?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The nuptial Treach'ry of the Fair,</L>

<L>Adultery, the very Name</L>

<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>I Can neither call this Piece of <HI>Tully</HI>'s nor my own, being much altered from the Original, not only by the change of the Style, but by Addition and Substraction. I believe you will be better pleas'd, to receive it, as I did, at the first sight; for to me <HI>Cicero</HI> did not so much appear to write, as <HI>Cato</HI> to speak; and to do right to my Au∣thor, I believe no Character of any Person was ever better drawn to the Life than this. Therefore neither consider <HI>Cicero</HI>, nor Me, but <HI>Cato</HI> himself, who being then rais'd from the Dead to speak the Language of that Age and Place; neither the di∣stance of Place or Time makes it less possible to raise him now to speak ours.</P>
<P>Though I dare not compare my Copy with the Original, yet you will find it mention'd here, how much Fruits are improv'd by Grafting; and here, by grafting Verse upon Prose, some of these severer Arguments may receive a more mild and pleasing Taste.</P>
<P><HI>Cato</HI> says (in another Place) of himself, that he learn'd to speak <HI>Greek</HI> between the Seventieth and Eightieth Year of his Age, beginning that so late, he may not yet be too old to learn <HI>English</HI>, be∣ing now between his Seventeenth and Eighteenth Hundred Year.

<L>Four Causes, which its Misery declare.

<ITEM><HI>1.</HI> Because our Bodies Strength it much impairs;</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>2.</HI> That it takes off our Minds from great Affairs;</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>3.</HI> Next, That our Sense of Pleasures it deprives;</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>4.</HI> Last, That approaching Death attends our Lives.</ITEM>
</LIST></L>
<L>Of all these several Causes I'll Discourse,</L>
<L>And then of each, in Order, weigh the Force.</L>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The FIRST PART.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<L>THE Old from such Affairs is only freed,</L>
<L>which vigorous Youth, and Strength of Body need.</L>
<L>But to more high Affairs our Age is lent,</L>

<L>Nor <HI>Appius</HI>, with whose Strength his Sight was lost,</L>
<L>Who when the Senate was to Peace inclin'd</L>
<L>With <HI>Pyrrhus</HI>, shew'd his Reason was not blind.</L>
<L>Whither's our Courage and our Wisdom come?</L>
<L>When <HI>Rome</HI> it self conspires the Fate of <HI>Rome</HI>.</L>

<L>Great Actions less from Courage, Strength, and Spee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>Than from wise Counsels and Commands proceed;</L>
<L>Those Arts, Age wants not, which to Age belong,</L>
<L>Not heat, but cold Experience makes us strong:</L>
<L>A Consul, Tribune, General, I have been,</L>
<L>All sorts of War I have past through, and seen;</L>
<L>And now grown Old, I seem t'abondon it,</L>

<L>I every day 'gainst <HI>Carthage</HI> War proclaim,</L>
<L>(For <HI>Rome</HI>'s Destruction hath been long her Aim)</L>
<L>Nor shall I cease till I her Ruin see,</L>
<L>Which Triumph may the Gods design for thee;</L>
<L>That <HI>Scipio</HI> may revenge his Grand sire's Ghost,</L>
<L>Whose Life at <HI>Cannae</HI> with great Honour lost,</L>
<L>Is on Record, nor had he wearied been</L>
<L>With Age, if he an Hundred Years had seen,</L>

<L>Which, if our Ancestors ha'd not retain'd,</L>

<L>The <HI>Spartans</HI> to their highest Magistrate,</L>

<L>When the Tragedian <HI>Naevius</HI> did demand,</L>
<L>Why did your Common-wealth no longer stand?</L>
<L>'Twas answer'd, that their Senators were new,</L>
<L>Foolish, and young, and such as nothing knew:</L>
<L>Nature to Youth hot Rashness doth dispence,</L>

<L>But Age ('tis said) will Memory decay,</L>

<L>Not to remember where they hid their Gold.</L>
<L>From Age such Art of Memory we learn,</L>

<L>No Understanding, Memory can want,</L>
<L>Where Wisdom studious Industry doth plant.</L>
<L>Nor does it only in the Active live,</L>

<L>When <HI>Sophocles</HI> (who Plays, when aged wrote)</L>

<L>The Judges hearing with Applause, at th' end,</L>
<L>Freed him, and said no Fool such Lines had penn'd.</L>

<L>And pierc'd the Brain of <HI>Richard</HI>'s constant Friend.</L>
<L>When <HI>Oxford</HI> saw him sink, his Noble Soul</L>
<L>Was full of Grief, which made him thus condole:</L>
<L>'Farewel, true Knight, to whom no costly Grave</L>
<L>'Can give due Honour: Would my Tears might save</L>
<L>'Those Streams of Blood, deserving to be spilt</L>
<L>'In better Service: Had not <HI>Richard</HI>'s Guilt</L>
<L>'Such heavy Weight upon his Fortune laid,</L>
<L>'Thy glorious Vertues had his Sins outweigh'd,</L>
<L>Courageous <HI>Talbot</HI> had with <HI>Surrey</HI> met,</L>
<L>And after many Blows begins to fret,</L>
<L>That one so young in Arms should thus unmov'd,</L>
<L>Resist his Strength, so oft in War approv'd.</L>
<L>And now the Earl beholds his Father fall;</L>
<L>Whose Death like horrid Darkness frighted all:</L>
<L>Some give themselves as Captives, others flie,</L>
<L>But this young Lion casts his gen'rous Eye</L>
<L>On <HI>Mowbrayes</HI> Lion, painted in his Shield,</L>
<L>And with that King of Beasts repines to yield:</L>
<L>'The Field (<HI>saith he</HI>) in which the Lion stands,</L>
<L>'Is Blood, and Blood I offer to the hands</L>
<L>'Of daring Foes; but never shall my Flight</L>
<L>'Die black my Lion, which as yet is white.</L>
<L>His Enemies (like cunning Huntsmen) strive</L>
<L>In binding Snares, to take their Prey alive,</L>
<L>While he desires t' expose his naked Breast,</L>
<L>And thinks the Sword that deepest strikes is best.</L>
<L>Young <HI>Howard</HI> single with an Army fights,</L>
<L>When mov'd with Pity two Renowned Knights,</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="412"/>Strong <HI>Clarindon</HI>, and valiant <HI>Coniers</HI> trie</L>
<L>To rescue him, in which attempt they die;</L>
<L>For <HI>Savage</HI> red with Blood of slaughter'd Foes,</L>
<L>Doth them in midst of all his Troops inclose,</L>
<L>Where though the Captain for their Safety strives,</L>
<L>Yet baser hands deprive them of their Lives.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Surrey</HI> fainting, scarce his Sword can hold,</L>
<L>Which made a common Soldier grow so bold,</L>
<L>To lay rude hands upon that Noble Flower;</L>
<L>Which he disdaining (Anger gives him Power)</L>
<L>Erects his Weapon with a nimble round,</L>
<L>And sends the Peasants Arm to kiss the Ground.</L>
<L>This done, to <HI>Talbot</HI> he presents his Blade,</L>
<L>And saith, 'It is not hope of Life hath made</L>
<L>'This my Submission, but my Strength is spent▪</L>
<L>'And some perhaps of Villain Blood will vent</L>
<L>'My weary Soul: This Favour I demand,</L>
<L>'That I may die by your victorious hand.</L>
<L>'Nay, God forbid that any of my Name,</L>
<L>'(<HI>Quoth</HI> Talbot) should put out so bright a Flame,</L>
<L>'As burns in thee (brave Youth) where thou hast err'd,</L>
<L>'It was thy Father's fault, since he preferr'd</L>
<L>'A Tyrant's Crown before the juster Side.</L>
<L>The Earl still mindful of his Birth replied,</L>
<L>'I wonder <HI>(Talbot)</HI> that thy Noble Heart</L>
<L>'Insults on Ruines of the vanquisht part:</L>
<L>'We had the right, if now to you it flow,</L>
<L>'The Fortune of your Swords hath made it so:</L>
<L>'I never will my luckless Choice repent,</L>
<L>'Nor can it stain mine Honour or Descent,</L>
<L>'Set <HI>England</HI>'s Royal Wreath upon a Stake,</L>
<L>'There will I fight, and not the place forsake:</L>
<L>'And if the Will of God hath so dispos'd,</L>
<L>'That <HI>Richmond</HI>'s Brow be with the Crown inclos'd,</L>
<L>'I shall to him, or his give doubtless Signs,</L>
<L>'That Duty in my Thoughts, not Faction, shines.</L>
<L>The earnest Soldiers still the Chase pursue:</L>
<L>But their Commanders grieve they should imbrue</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="413"/>Their Swords in Blood which springs from <HI>English</HI> Veins▪</L>
<L>The peaceful Sound of Trumpets then restrains</L>

<L>To rest contented in this first Defeat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The King intended at his setting out,</L>
<L>To help his Vantguard, but a nimble Scout</L>
<L>Runs crying; 'Sir, I saw not far from hence,</L>
<L>'Where <HI>Richmond</HI> hovers with a small Defence,</L>
<L>'And like one guilty of some heinous Ill,</L>
<L>'Is cover'd with the Shade of yonder Hill.</L>
<L>The Raven almost famish'd joys not more,</L>
<L>When restless Billows tumble to the Shore</L>
<L>A heap of Bodies shipwrack'd in the Seas,</L>
<L>Than <HI>Richard</HI> with this News himself doth please:</L>
<L>He now diverts his Course another way,</L>
<L>And with his Army led in fair Array,</L>
<L>Ascends the rising Ground, and taking view</L>
<L>Of <HI>Henry</HI>'s Soldiers, sees they are but few:</L>
<L>Imperial Courage fires his Noblest Breast,</L>
<L>He sets a threat'ning Spear within his rest,</L>
<L>Thus saying: 'All true Knights, on me attend,</L>

<L>To them brave <HI>Ratcliffe</HI>, gen'rous <HI>Clifton</HI> haste,</L>
<L>Old <HI>Brakenbury</HI> scorns to be the last:</L>

<L>Resolv'd for Safety of their Prince to die;</L>
<L>And <HI>Catesby</HI> to this Number adds his Name,</L>
<L>Though pale with Fear, yet overcome with Shame▪</L>
<L>Their Boldness <HI>Richmond</HI> dreads not, but admires;</L>
<L>He sees their Motion like to rolling Fires,</L>
<L>Which by the Wind along the Fields are born</L>
<L>Amidst the Trees, the Hedges, and the Corn,</L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="414"/>Where they the hopes of Husbandmen consume,</L>
<L>And fill the troubled Air with dusky Fume.</L>
<L>Now as a careful Lord of Neighb'ring Grounds,</L>
<L>He keeps the Flame from entring in his Bounds,</L>
<L>Each Man is warn'd to hold his Station sure,</L>
<L>Prepar'd with Courage strong Assaults t' endure:</L>
<L>But all in vain, no Force, no Warlike Art,</L>
<L>From sudden breaking can preserve that part,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Richard</HI> like a Dart from Thunder falls,</L>
<L>His Foes give way, and stand as brazen Walls</L>
<L>On either side of his inforced Path,</L>
<L>While he neglects them, and reserves his Wrath</L>
<L>For him whose Death these threat'ning Clouds would clear,</L>
<L>Whom now with Gladness he beholdeth near,</L>
<L>And all those Faculties together brings,</L>
<L>Which move the Soul to high and noble things.</L>
<L>Ev'n so a Tyger having follow'd long</L>
<L>The Hunter's steps that robb'd her of her Young:</L>
<L>When first she sees him, is by Rage inclin'd</L>
<L>Her steps to double, and her Teeth to grind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Horse to Horse, and Man is joyn'd to Man</L>
<L>So strictly, that the Soldiers hardly can</L>
<L>Their Adversaries from their Fellows know:</L>
<L>Here each brave Champion singles out his Foe.</L>
<L>In this Confusion <HI>Brakenbury</HI> meets</L>
<L>With <HI>Hungerford</HI>, and him thus foully greets:</L>
<L>'Ah Traytor, false in Breach of Faith and Love,</L>
<L>'What Discontent could thee and <HI>Bourchier</HI> move,</L>
<L>'Who had so long my Fellows been in Arms,</L>
<L>'To flie to Rebels? What seducing Charms</L>
<L>'Could on your clouded Minds such Darkness bring,</L>
<L>'To serve an Out-Law, and neglect the King?</L>
<L>With these sharp Speeches <HI>Hungerford</HI> enrag'd,</L>
<L>T' uphold his Honour, thus the Battel wag'd:</L>
<L>'Thy doting Age (<HI>saith he</HI>) delights in words,</L>
<L>'But this Aspersion must be try'd by Swords.</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="415"/>Then leaving Talk, he by his Weapon speaks,</L>
<L>And drives a Blow, which <HI>Brackenbury</HI> breaks</L>
<L>By lifting up his Left Hand, else the Steel</L>
<L>Had pierc'd his Burgonet, and made him feel</L>
<L>The Pangs of Death: But now the Fury fell</L>
<L>Upon the Hand that did the Stroke repel,</L>
<L>And cuts so large a Portion of the Shield,</L>
<L>That it no more can safe Protection yield.</L>
<L>Bold <HI>Hungerford</HI> disdains his Use to make</L>
<L>Of this advantage, but doth straight forsake</L>
<L>His massy Target, render'd to his 'Squire,</L>
<L>And saith: 'Let Cowards such Defence desire.</L>
<L>This done, these valiant Knights dispose their Blades,</L>
<L>And still the one the other's Face invades,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Brakenbury</HI>'s Helmet giving way</L>
<L>To those fierce Strokes that <HI>Hungerford</HI> doth lay,</L>
<L>Is bruis'd and gapes, which <HI>Bourchier</HI> fighting near,</L>
<L>Perceives and cries: 'Brave <HI>Hungerford</HI> forbear,</L>
<L>'Bring not those Silver Hairs to timeless end,</L>
<L>'He was, and may be once again our Friend.</L>
<L>But oh, too late! the fatal Blow was sent</L>
<L>From <HI>Hungerford</HI>, which he may now repent,</L>
<L>But not recal, and digs a Mortal Wound</L>
<L>In <HI>Brakenbury</HI>'s Head, which should be crown'd</L>
<L>With precious Metals, and with Bays adorn'd</L>
<L>For constant Truth appearing, when he scorn'd</L>
<L>To stain his hand in those young Princes Blood,</L>
<L>And like a Rock amidst the Ocean stood</L>
<L>Against the Tyrant's Charms, and Threats unmov'd,</L>
<L>Though Death declares how much he <HI>Richard</HI> lov'd.</L>
<L>Stout <HI>Ferrers</HI> strives to fix his mighty Launce</L>
<L>In <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s Heart, which on the Steel doth glance,</L>
<L>And runs in vain the empty Air to press:</L>
<L>But <HI>Pembroke</HI>'s Spear obtaining wisht Success,</L>
<L>Through <HI>Ferrers</HI> Breast-plate and his Body sinks,</L>
<L>And Vital Blood from inward Vessels drinks.</L>
<L>Here <HI>Stanley</HI> and brave <HI>Lovell</HI> try their Strength,</L>
<L>Whose equal Courage draws the Strife to length,</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="416"/>They think not how they may themselves defend,</L>
<L>To strike is all their Care, to kill, their end.</L>

<L>The hollow Crags, when striving for their Bounds,</L>
<L>They wash their piercing Horns in mutual Wounds,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If in the midst of such a bloody Fight</L>
<L>The Name of Friendship be not thought too light,</L>
<L>Recount my Muse, how <HI>Byron</HI>'s faithful Love</L>
<L>To dying <HI>Clifton</HI> did it self approve:</L>
<L>For <HI>Clifton</HI> fighting bravely in the Troop,</L>
<L>Receives a Wound, and now begins to droop:</L>
<L>Which <HI>Byron</HI> seeing, though in Arms his Foe,</L>
<L>In Heart his Friend, and hoping that the Blow</L>
<L>Had not been mortal, guards him with his Shield</L>
<L>From second Hurts, and cries, 'Dear <HI>Clifton</HI>, yield;</L>
<L>'Thou hither cam'st led by sinister Fate,</L>
<L>'Against my first Advice, yet now, though late,</L>
<L>'Take this my Counsel. <HI>Clifton</HI> thus replied:</L>
<L>'It is too late, for I must now provide</L>
<L>'To seek another Life: Live thou, sweet Friend,</L>
<L>'And when thy side obtains a happy end,</L>
<L>'Upon the Fortunes of my Children look,</L>
<L>'Remember what a solemn Oath he took,</L>

<L>'Would with the Conqu'ror try his utmost Might,</L>
<L>'To save the other Lands from rav'nous Paws,</L>
<L>'Which seize on Fragments of a luckless Cause.</L>
<L>'My Father's Fall our House had almost drown'd.</L>
<L>'But I by chance aboard in Shipwreck found.</L>
<L>'May never more such Danger threaten mine:</L>
<L>'Deal thou for them, as I would do for thine.</L>

<L>The King grows weary, and begins to faint,</L>
<L>It grieves him that his Foes perceive the taint:</L>
<L>Some strike him, that till then durst not come near,</L>
<L>With Weight and Number they to Ground him bear,</L>
<L>Where trampled down, and hew'd with many Swords,</L>
<L>He softly utter'd these his dying Words,</L>

<PB REF="427"/>
they han't one Farthing in their Pock∣ets to keep the Devil out; but being <HI>Com∣moners</HI> (altho' scandalous) they endeavour to ride Paramount, and foolishly indulge themselves in a stupid Fondness of being counted Genteel, when perhaps but last Year they followed the Plough, or else which is worse, served their Brother Hogs.

<HEAD>THE COMMONER, A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN <HI>Titan</HI> with his splendid Rays had blest</L>
<L>The drooping Earth, with Winter's Cold opprest,</L>
<L>And grateful <HI>Ceres</HI> did begin to smile</L>
<L>On Peasants that had grumbl'd a long while,</L>
<L>Then 'twas that a poor Bumpkin who had been</L>
<L>Some Lord's Foot-Page, or else some Farmer's Hind,</L>
<L>Began to rent a Farm ten Pounds <HI>per</HI> Year,</L>
<L>And liv'd as great as Lords at <HI>Westminster</HI>,</L>
<L>As he thought: He thriv'd, and strait begun</L>
<L>To chuse a Mate, by whom he got a Son.</L>
<L>Of Nursing of this Son I shall not treat,</L>
<L>Who lay in Blankets oft for want of Sheet.</L>
<L>Altho' thus hardy bred, the Boy yet thriv'd,</L>
<L>And to six Years of Age at length arriv'd,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="429"/>And then to School the Bumpkins their Son sent,</L>
<L>(The following Lines shall shew for what Intent,)</L>
<L>As by the Fire Old <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI> were sate,</L>
<L>And Dame pull'd up her Coats (as wont) to heat—</L>
<L>The Sparks of Fire did her Black Nest annoy,</L>
<L>And then she thought on the fled Bird, her Boy.</L>
<L>And thus spoke: <HI>John</HI>, what shall we do, (says she)</L>
<L>With our Young Darling Son, my Boy <HI>Tommy</HI>?</L>
<L>Labor'ous Tasks we've under gone with Sweat</L>
<L>To get our Bread, and very often wet</L>
<L>Have been as high as fork'd, and all we can</L>
<L>Endeavour'd of <HI>Tom</HI> t' make a Gentleman.</L>
<L>What mean you by a Gentleman? ask'd he,</L>
<L>And said, our <HI>Tom</HI> shall go to plough with me.</L>
<L>Vor he's sturdy, lusty, sprack, and bold,</L>
<L>Stout, surly, strong, and can the Plough Tail hold.</L>
<L>Knows very well, how with an Hey or Hoe</L>
<L>To make the Horses slow'r, or faster goe:</L>
<L>This Work, I think, 'tis best to put him to.</L>
<L>Therefore let's breed him to this Business, Wife;</L>
<L>Vor 'tis an Healthy and Gold-getting Life.</L>
<L>At this she storm'd and raving swore aloud,</L>
<L>That her Son should not work, do what he would.</L>
<L>At last to put a stop to further Strife,</L>
<L>Old <HI>John</HI> was forc'd to yield, to please his Wife.</L>
<L>The Boy to School must go for six Years more;</L>
<L>Which being expir'd, he knew as much before</L>
<L>As now he did almost: Excepting this,</L>
<L>To grope a Maid, or give a stabb'ring Kiss.</L>
<L>But when the Boy was grown to full Fifteen,</L>
<L>A second Conf'rence was begun between</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="430"/>The careful Parents; what they had best do</L>
<L>With this their Son: And what to put him to.</L>
<L>The Father said he should his Living get</L>
<L>By lopping Beards: The Old Dame in a Pet</L>
<L>Cries no— no, <HI>John</HI>, he shall a Parson be,</L>
<L>We'll send him to the University.</L>
<L>For Scholarship he is most Excellent,</L>
<L>Can read the <HI>Bible</HI> and the <HI>Testament</HI>.</L>
<L>Therefore to <HI>Oxon</HI> let us send him quick,</L>
<L>Who knows but he may get a Bishoprick.</L>
<L>But yet suppose he can't attain that Station,</L>
<L>But hath the poorest Parish in the Nation,</L>
<L>That doth not yield him past ten Pounds a Year,</L>
<L>He then may preach to Day, the next sell Beer.</L>
<L>And after Evening Zarmon, ('tis no sin)</L>
<L>May play on Fiddle to call Custom in.</L>
<L>An hot Dispute there was: Which to decide,</L>
<L>I'll to his Master gwo, the Old Man cry'd,</L>
<L>That I mayn't loose my Work, I'll walk anon</L>
<L>To zee the Master when the Boys are gwon.</L>
<L>Thus spoke: In hast out sets the good Old Man,</L>
<L>With flopping Hat and Hazell Stick in hand.</L>
<L>But when within the Sight of t' House he came,</L>
<L>Cock't was his Hat, and cleans'd his Hazell Cane.</L>
<L>At Door he knocks: Out came the Master strait,</L>
<L>And to the Clown gave Entrance at the Gate.</L>
<L>So soon as seen, three Rev'rend Bows were gave,</L>
<L>As Papists do when they adore the Grave</L>
<L>Of some renown'd Saint, who in former Days</L>
<L>For Conquest over Sin did wear the Bays.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="431"/>When Compliments were past, thus spoke the Boar,</L>
<L>'Zur I am come to be advis'd, bevore</L>
<L>'That I my lurned Zon do from School take,</L>
<L>'Wore I had best of him a Priest to make.</L>
<L>'Vor he have cost me many Pounds I'm zure,</L>
<L>'The which to raise much Labour I endure.</L>
<L>'But yet I will not grudge my pains, if he</L>
<L>'But by his Lurning may a Bishup be.</L>
<L>'I have a mind to zend him to <HI>Oxvord</HI>,</L>
<L>'That he hereafter may live like a Lord.</L>
<L>To which the Master smiling, Answer made,</L>
<L>It will be better for him than a Trade.</L>
<L>Some Rules I will, good Farmer, your Son give,</L>
<L>That he as cheap as if at Home may live.</L>
<L>A Servitour; you may maintain him cheap</L>
<L>For three or four Shillings I'm sure a Week.</L>
<L>'A Zarvitor! Zur I should be asham'd</L>
<L>'That zuch a thing should be hereafter nam'd.</L>
<L>'For Vorty Pounds a Year I have been told</L>
<L>'A Mon might live, and keep zum store of Gold</L>
<L>'To zerve Occas'on if he should be ill,</L>
<L>'Zo much I will afford with a free Will.</L>
<L>He may live on't, if he'll but careful be,</L>
<L>But somewhat shabby (as you'll quickly see.)</L>
<L>'He must live close (quoth he) as I have done,</L>
<L>'Or else I'm zure he must again come Home.</L>
<L>And thus advis'd, he with three formal Scrapes</L>
<L>Draws back; and of the Master his leave takes.</L>
<L>Full fraught with News he hurries Home in hast,</L>
<L>Relates to <HI>Joan</HI> what had betwixt them past.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="432"/>At this the Dame was pleased wondrous well,</L>
<L>And said, That she next Market-Day would zell</L>
<L>Eggs, Cheese and Butter, and would also buy</L>
<L>Zom things to fit her Zon for Varsity.</L>
<L>The Day is come: With speed out sets the Dame,</L>
<L>(And her Horse prov'd to be in one Foot lame)</L>
<L>But by good Chance she to the Market came.</L>
<L>Willing she was to sell, but yet sold dear,</L>
<L>Consid'ring the great Charges of the Year.</L>
<L>At last she sold: And with the Money bought</L>
<L>Some rugged Freze to make her Son a Coat.</L>
<L>The Taylor's sent for, and must come with speed,</L>
<L>Because it is a thing of Urgent Need.</L>
<L>The Boy is measur'd, and strict Charge is given</L>
<L>To make it large, to turn upon occasion.</L>

<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now put up to fat against the time</L>

<L><PB N="10" REF="433"/>To him a piece of good Plumb-Cake she slides,</L>
<L>And says 'twill serve to eat as you do ride.</L>
<L>Now Father mounts his old Dun cripled Beast,</L>
<L>The Son an Ass nineteen Years old at least.</L>
<L>Longing to see dear <HI>Alma Mater</HI>'s Face,</L>
<L>With rusty Spur pricks Horse to mend his pace.</L>
<L>But by hard Riding having Leather lost,</L>
<L><HI>Tom</HI> thought he had rid with the Devil Post;</L>
<L>Curs'd all the Sciences, and bid Hell take</L>
<L>And spoil all Learning for his poor Bum's sake.</L>
<L>Fortune was kind, and on them still did smile,</L>
<L>'Till they to <HI>Oxford</HI> came within a Mile:</L>
<L>Where on a sudden a Gowns-Man they saw,</L>
<L>Who on their Spirits struck a dreadful Awe.</L>
<L>'What's that? Cries <HI>Tom</HI>, alass, I greatly fear</L>
<L>'The Place that's <HI>Bedlam</HI> call'd is seated here.</L>
<L>'For zure that Man is mad, or he would ne'er</L>
<L>'A square Clout instead of a Beaver wear.</L>
<L>But when they came a little further in,</L>
<L>They saw some Deans that had been circuiting.</L>
<L>'They'r mad indeed (says the Old Man) alack!</L>
<L>'Here come some Men with Red Rags at their Back.</L>
<L>To Inn they come: Calls for a private Room,</L>
<L>And the Old Man reads <HI>Tom</HI> his Fatal Doom.</L>
<L>'Now Zon (quoth he) mark and mind what I zay,</L>
<L>'And study hard as well at Night as Day.</L>
<L>'Take care of Evil Company, my Zon,</L>
<L>'And do not into vicious Courses run.</L>
<L>'Abstain from Drink, Rakes Company decline,</L>
<L>'And be at Home before the Clock strikes Nine.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="434"/>Thus having said: He whistled for the Host,</L>
<L>And order'd him to bring up a large Toast,</L>
<L>Sugar and Ale, Nutmeg and Spice, that he</L>
<L>And <HI>Tom</HI> together might sup lovingly.</L>
<L>So having ended Supper, went to bed,</L>
<L>After they had some mumbling Prayers said.</L>
<L>But Toast lying heavy on the Maw, <HI>Tom</HI> lay</L>
<L>Cursing the Night and wishing for the Day.</L>
<L>No sooner had the watchful Cock declar'd,</L>
<L>That <HI>Sol</HI>'s bright Chariot in the East appear'd;</L>
<L>But up he gets, and nicely put on's Cloaths,</L>
<L>Brushing his Hat and Rowling up his Hose:</L>
<L>Hose: So I call them, for they were home-spun,</L>
<L>One part Black Wool inter-wove with White Thrum.</L>
<L>His Wastcoat, Coat and Breeches were of Freze,</L>
<L>Which dangled down a Foot below his Knees.</L>
<L>His Hair was thin, short and Canonical,</L>
<L>Like that of Friars, shap'd by Edge of Bowl:</L>
<L>Naked on top, (by which Emblem they show</L>
<L>That <HI>Aetna</HI> cold above, is hot below,</L>
<L>And that they as much as brisk young Men can do.</L>
<L>Thus being dress'd, they walkt abroad to see</L>
<L>The Buildings of the University.</L>
<L>They thought the Schools a Church, so entred in</L>
<L>To see the Rareties that were therein:</L>
<L>Dirty their Shoes, walking they did refrain,</L>
<L>Pull'd off their Hats, and so march'd out again.</L>
<L>Passing along, they did with Joy repair</L>
<L>To see that stately Pile, the Theatre:</L>
<L>Where they but little saw, as they thought rare,</L>
<L>Except some Benches, and an old work'd Chair.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="435"/>To Physick-Garden then they bend their Course▪</L>
<L>But the Old Man was forc'd to ride on's Horse;</L>
<L>For Stockings stiff and dirty by the Sweat</L>
<L>Had miserably gall'd his stinking Feet.</L>
<L>But when they at the Garden Door arriv'd,</L>
<L><HI>Shafer</HI> dismounting Steed, on each hand spy'd</L>
<L>Two Men in Green of a prodigious Size,</L>
<L>With Mouths from Ear to Ear and Sawcer Eyes.</L>
<L>To them these Men of Yew-Tree did appear,</L>
<L><HI>Gigantes</HI> fierce, which made them run for fear.</L>
<L>Rambling on farther still, at last they come</L>
<L>Unto the Place, where hangs Ill-natur'd <HI>TOM</HI>,</L>
<L>Whose dreadful Sound calls Scholars Home at Nine,</L>
<L>Tho' in the midst of Jollity and Wine.</L>
<L>And makes them hurry Home in hast; tho' they</L>
<L>Are willing to sit up till break of Day.</L>
<L>No sooner had Old <HI>Tag</HI> the Bell perceiv'd,</L>
<L>But he (well read in Scripture) strait believ'd</L>
<L>That 'twas the Son of great God <HI>BELL</HI> and said,</L>
<L>That to his Father Kings great Homage paid.</L>
<L>Therefore with Hat in hand, he and his Son</L>
<L>Bow'd low: The Hammer presently struck One:</L>
<L>Whose Stroak <HI>Tom</HI> feeling, made a dismal Noise,</L>
<L>And told it One a Clock by his hoarse Voice.</L>
<L>At this Old <HI>Waggum</HI> frightned, would not stay,</L>
<L>But mounting <HI>Shagg</HI>, rode hastily away.</L>
<L>They came to Inn, and whilst they din'd, did tell</L>
<L>The Dangers manifold that them befel.</L>
<L>And having din'd, a second Walk they went,</L>
<L>And to the Tutor's Chamber their Course bent.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="436"/>Where being come, they thrice knockt at the Door:</L>
<L>Out came the Rev'rend Tutor: But before</L>
<L>He came in sight, their Hats were held in hand,</L>
<L>And trembling stood as tho' on Holy Land.</L>
<L>With thrice three Bows our Senior Peasant said,</L>
<L>'Zur, I have brought my Zon that you might aid</L>
<L>'Him in zome things: I will of him Care take,</L>
<L>And be his Friend for his old Master's sake,</L>
<L>The worthy Tutor said: And then begun</L>
<L>To ask some Quest'ons of the Farmer's Son.</L>
<L>To every Word the Youngster spoke, a Nod</L>
<L>Was gave, as tho' he fear'd the Lash of Rod.</L>
<L>'What Gown do you design that he shall wear?</L>
<L>'Alas, good Zur, he is a Commoner.</L>
<L>The Gown's put on; the Boy himself can't know</L>
<L>(No Wonder) for he looks like some Scare-Crow.</L>
<L>Of all their other Acts I shall not speak,</L>
<L>Because, I'm sure, they would take up a Week.</L>
<L>Now 'tis high time for <HI>Gaffa</HI> to go Home,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd leave behind him his Beloved Son.</L>

<L><PB N="14" REF="437"/>The Scene is alter'd much; for now you'll find</L>

<L>Shoes, Caps and Shirts and taken upon Tick,</L>
<L>And ten to one but that he shows a Trick.</L>
<L>Or if not so: He can't from Chamber come,</L>
<L>For fear of that pestiferous thing, a Dun.</L>
<L>If one knocks at the Door, (altho' well known)</L>
<L>'Tis hard to get Admittance: lest that one</L>
<L>Should come along with him, whose Aspect would</L>

<L>Thus miserable lives the Vaunting Beau,</L>
<L>And dares not, but his Head like Owls, to show.</L>

<HEAD>The Husband, A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LIFE was inspir'd, the first Life was Divine,</L>
<L>Then Life divided was: The Number Two</L>
<L>Made both unequal; but the chiefest sign</L>
<L>Of Duty is to think, and then to do:</L>
<L>Both which had purchas'd a perpetual Life,</L>
<L>If <HI>Adam</HI> had been equal with his Wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For then inferior Woman had not strove</L>
<L>To tempt her Monarch: Who did thoughtless yield,</L>
<L>Seeing he had none equal nor above,</L>
<L>But his Creator, in the spacious Field:</L>
<L>Thinking for any there was then no room,</L>
<L>But for himself, himself to overcome.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So did one weaker, and one far below,</L>
<L>Subvert the Folly of Man's poor Conceit:</L>
<L>For he did only Good and Evil know,</L>
<L>By Prospect, not by Burthen or by Weight:</L>
<L>Thus though no living Creature well could reach</L>
<L>His Worth, yet Woman could his Will impeach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="442"/>
<L>And hence it comes that all inferior Forms,</L>
<L>Traduce the worthy Shape which is above:</L>
<L>Our Ocean is distracted, by the Storms</L>
<L>Invisible: And Luck forsakes true Love:</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Adam</HI> though he knew the Guilt of Sin,</L>
<L>Yet knew he not the Curse which was within.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So <HI>Adam</HI>'s Dignity was over-match'd,</L>
<L>Not match'd: And so Conspiracies destroy</L>
<L>The Cause remote; but they away are snatch'd</L>
<L>E'er with Success they can the same enjoy:</L>
<L>For we deceive our Memories indeed,</L>
<L>When we deprive, we still hope to succeed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor <HI>Adam</HI>'s Will may simply be excus'd.</L>
<L>For he had Power to restrain his Will:</L>
<L>Yet Flesh so far his Heavenly Part abus'd,</L>
<L>To shew he could not be exempt from Ill:</L>
<L>And we have taken the same President,</L>
<L>That we might know by our Experiment.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From <HI>Adam</HI> we derive Infirmity,</L>
<L>And somewhat more: He never knew the Name</L>
<L>Of Child but Youthful, for Minority</L>
<L>Of doubtful Practice purchas'd all his Blame:</L>
<L>But (the Compleat Man which in Figure lies,</L>
<L>Being his own) he might have Prejudice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For if we sleep away the Name of Child,</L>
<L>As <HI>Adam</HI> did; and when we first awake,</L>
<L>But at full Age, or may be truly stil'd</L>
<L>As perfect Men by Knowledge: this doth make</L>
<L>No full disproof: For we do only guess</L>
<L>Until we try bad Luck or Happiness.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gold I may know, yet never know the Weight:</L>
<L>I may discern the dusky Colour dark,</L>
<L>In some deep Vault; but never know the Height,</L>
<L>Till I descend: I hear Tunes, not the Lark,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="443"/>Till I approach: So <HI>Adam</HI> he did see</L>
<L>The Colour only, not the Quantity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Adam</HI> was first a Man, but was alone,</L>
<L>His Marriage was a thing of Consequence,</L>
<L>And better Husband than himself was none,</L>
<L>Because the first: All Acts were Innocence</L>
<L>Except the first, which being set aside,</L>
<L><HI>Adam</HI> (to us) might soon be Stellify'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Husband, with <HI>Adam</HI> did begin to make</L>
<L>Man more supreme, than Nature could devise:</L>
<L>Nature (by Approbation) doth awake</L>
<L>Fancy; but Marriage makes our Fancy wise:</L>
<L>For if it thrive, we still seek to preserve,</L>
<L>If it thrives ill, we seek how to deserve.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Election is an Optick of the Soul,</L>
<L>Which chuseth Men far off, among the Croud,</L>
<L>Yes whilst unknown: we cannot Choice controul,</L>
<L>Although we do obscure it with a Cloud:</L>
<L>For Modesty may blush, but never can</L>
<L>Be able to resist her chosen Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Both Sexes have their Privilege alike</L>
<L>To chuse: But Woman hath Prerogative:</L>
<L>She may forbear, deny, and never strike</L>
<L>Till the just Hour, but Man doth still revive.</L>
<L>Each Minute's Fancy: And at first agree</L>
<L>To know by <HI>Distance</HI>, what the Hour will be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All our Election is Conditional,</L>
<L>But Dotage is Election Absolute:</L>
<L>The end of both Fruition: But withal</L>
<L>The first is past when we enjoy the Fruit:</L>
<L>The second never doth enough enjoy,</L>
<L>Until we do the object clean destroy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dotage is servile, doth neglect, abuse,</L>
<L>And (like the Spainiel) doth become more fond▪</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="444"/>A doating Husband can have no Excuse,</L>
<L>But the consuming part of Wedlock's Bond:</L>
<L>For 'tis attended ever with one Pain,</L>
<L>To love, yet nothing to receive again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She never was well match'd that chose a Man</L>
<L>By Commendations of another's Tongue:</L>
<L>Love makes the Choice: And Innocence the Swan</L>
<L>May never with Adversity be stung.</L>
<L>If he miscarry Woman doth lament</L>
<L>The Cause: Not of her chosen Love repent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Friends Friend is a more deceitful Path</L>
<L>Than Dotage for a Woman to conceive:</L>
<L>Love neither Thanks nor Thoughts but Freedom hath,</L>
<L>And Love to Praises may her Will bereave,</L>
<L>Not her Affection: Dotage sees her own:</L>
<L>But Objects only prais'd, are seldom known.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Love honours best and worst, both Rich and Poor,</L>
<L>Tawny Complection, Fair, and Swarth, and Black,</L>
<L>With equal Vertue: Fancy is the Door,</L>
<L>Love the Receiver: True Love cannot lack.</L>
<L>The simple End, if but enjoy it can,</L>
<L>Nor doth it wish, to love a better Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor must a Woman, therefore give Consent</L>
<L>To take this Man, because she cannot call</L>
<L>Another, Husband: Her Affections bent</L>
<L>With being Sun-burnt; and the very All</L>
<L>Of her Intention is a crooked Piece,</L>
<L>And only hangs about the Flesh or Fleece.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Humour is Nature's own Interpreter,</L>
<L>And often doth against his Will express,</L>
<L>Caution enough to some: Who can infer</L>
<L>Judgment, by Signs of his Unsteadiness?</L>
<L>Safe is not sudden, nor is violent,</L>
<L>Degrees make perfect Love, not our intent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="445"/>
<L>With Humours Melancholy hath a place,</L>
<L>And is, (if graceful) a producing Art:</L>
<L>But that which you discover by the Face,</L>
<L>Makes Discontent appear: The middle part</L>
<L>Of this inclines to Choler, though he purge,</L>
<L>It comes again: And Discontent doth urge.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet Spleen is needful, and doth Relish give</L>
<L>To thy just Credit, Diligence, and Mirth:</L>
<L>Choler consumes all: And alone doth live;</L>
<L>True Spleen implies a Sense, 'bove Clay and Earth▪</L>
<L>Choler excludes Mirth; Spleen submits, admits</L>
<L>The Title Husband, in his Fore-head sits.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Youth saith he loves, and he may get Belief,</L>
<L>If you persuaded be, he loves no more:</L>
<L>Youth hath the quicker Spirit, but in brief,</L>
<L>Full Man hath Futures, saw what went before.</L>
<L>And searches rather to apply, than learn,</L>
<L>For else Religion were a thing extern.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Old Men do marry first, then they would love,</L>
<L>If they quickned up with Flattery:</L>
<L>Else they eft-soons more troublesome do prove,</L>
<L>And will constrain a formal Amity.</L>
<L>Like Children they avoid the dark: And stay</L>
<L>Near fresh-warm Life, that Death might lose his way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Jealous they are, not wrong'd with Jealousy,</L>
<L>For he extends no further than himself:</L>
<L>Nor doth he more esteem the Dignity</L>
<L>Or Loss, than Carnal Beauty: Muckish Pelf</L>
<L>He honours much: He is by Life implor'd,</L>
<L>Only to love what cannot be restor'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Batchelor is to be doubted more</L>
<L>Than Widower, not to be fear'd so much:</L>
<L>Doubts be of that which never was before,</L>
<L>Fear of what hath been, lest it should be such:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="446"/>In Mischief: But where first Love firmly stood,</L>
<L>Then fear the second cannot be so good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Although you doubt of such as never knew</L>
<L>The Force of Wedlock, yet conceive some hope:</L>
<L>For though (unmarried) such do prove untrue,</L>
<L>Husband, may change their most lascivious Scope.</L>
<L>A Wife adds Ballance: Makes him still rely</L>
<L>Much upon her, much on Posterity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Widowers, if they did first abuse</L>
<L>Wedlock: The Sequel you may justly fear</L>
<L>By instance: If they did directly chuse</L>
<L>And love the first; they will forgetless bear</L>
<L>That Love till Death: So precious Ointments leave</L>
<L>An Odour, though the Substance you bereave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When therefore such a Man thou dost behold</L>
<L>With Reason's Eye; survey the Body last:</L>
<L>Chuse where his Love was rather young, than old▪</L>
<L>With chief relation to his Marriage past.</L>
<L>Love him who truly did not love before,</L>
<L>Rather than such a one, who lov'd <HI>no more</HI>.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Male doth not make the Man, but Majesty,</L>
<L>That knows no more of Comely than command:</L>
<L>If either do exceed; his Dignity</L>
<L>Becomes effeminate; or doth withstand</L>
<L>The pleasing Humour of smooth-breasted Love,</L>
<L>And comes too nigh, or doth too far remove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Decent with him is fairly beautiful,</L>
<L>And if his well-grac'd Carriage can express</L>
<L>A valiant Beauty, to abhor the Gull:</L>
<L>To make his Mind, not Strength the Happiness</L>
<L>Of Shame's Encounter, yet include his Strength,</L>
<L>His clear Distinction hath a Husband's Length.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Deformity of Limbs Inferior,</L>
<L>Is no essential part of Womens Hate▪</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="447"/>The Smile, Voice, Countenance, be superior,</L>
<L>And do express enough, or to abate,</L>
<L>Or multiply the Sparks of Womens Love,</L>
<L>But things indifferent cannot purchase Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Gloss and Varnish of a Husband's Choice,</L>
<L>Be Cloaths, and good Behaviour: They attract</L>
<L>Only, or else confirm: A silver Voice</L>
<L>Meeting these unforestall'd, doth well enact</L>
<L>The Face's Admiration; and Elect</L>
<L>That (then which) nothing can be more select.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Authority is a commanding Style,</L>
<L>And doth impart small Motives to consent,</L>
<L>Except the Match: If Personage be vile,</L>
<L>Then she respects not him, but her Extent.</L>
<L>If he, or any love, without Love's Skill,</L>
<L>It makes a Wife unchaste against her Will.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let his Profession be the World's, not thine,</L>
<L>So, be it shameful, it offends not thee;</L>
<L>Be it ingenious, it will combine</L>
<L>Thy vow'd Affection: Things indifferent be.</L>
<L>Which do depend upon some principal,</L>
<L>Take only that, and you enjoy them all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor may the Love that you bestow on them,</L>
<L>Give the due Honour unto him you chuse:</L>
<L>But if you make his Majesty the Stem</L>
<L>Of your Conceit, Love nothing will refuse:</L>
<L>For Life and Motion follow perfect Health,</L>
<L>As Love attracts the Complement of Wealth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take what he hath, and leave what he hath not,</L>
<L>To the Perfection of a better Age:</L>
<L>Things un-existent are by Love begot;</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t doth with Futures present need asswage.</L>
<L>If you see Adjuncts, you propound a Limb,</L>
<L>But do include all, by propounding him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="448"/>
<L>His Beard is but an outward Complement,</L>
<L>And yet bewrays he hath had time to learn:</L>
<L>Which well may serve (though some hath been mispent)</L>
<L>To make a Husband; Fame the upper-Quearn</L>
<L>Which grinds him, will discover what he is,</L>
<L>Contempt of Fame may make him prove amiss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such Fame is Publick, and the Circumstance</L>
<L>Of it, incourages a happy End;</L>
<L>Contempt will purchase no Deliverance,</L>
<L>Nor take due Motives: if he do commend.</L>
<L>Fame with an Affectation he is proud,</L>
<L>If he contemns, he cannot be allow'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fame is our Hackney, not the Journey's end,</L>
<L>He runs together, when we move our selves</L>
<L>Goes backward, if the Rider him offend,</L>
<L>And with incessant Speediness he delves</L>
<L>The Grave of Goods Oblivion: Much trust</L>
<L>In Fame deceives, too little, makes Men rust.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take therefore such a Man that hath bestrid,</L>
<L>The lack of Fame, where he is best beknown:</L>
<L>Stipendious Voices ever will out-bid</L>
<L>The common Rumour, which Report is grown</L>
<L>A Tryal now, t'approve Good, and condemn,</L>
<L>For Sins it calls Sins, though it nourish them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bad Fame is Black Complection to the Eye,</L>
<L>And gives a bitter Taste to outward Form:</L>
<L>A comely Villain pitied we espy,</L>
<L>Seldom by true Love, rescued from the Storm,</L>
<L>For when she takes the Med'cine with the Weed,</L>
<L>That Woman only, loves a Man indeed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But your protesting Suitor runs too fast,</L>
<L>He loves the Name of Husband, not the Wife:</L>
<L>The Tongue bewrays the Judgment over-past,</L>
<L>He doth exclude Necessity in Strife:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="449"/>And like (the <HI>Turkish</HI> Captains) doth propound</L>
<L>Peace, where the Act of Conquest doth abound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One too Officious, or too Eloquent,</L>
<L>The Tenor of his Meaning doth betray:</L>
<L>And rather practise a new Element,</L>
<L>Of Shadow than Affection: This delay</L>
<L>Confounds: Proves subtle, or imply</L>
<L>The vain Indulgence of Idolatry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The true best Husband never doth divide</L>
<L>Affection into Rags: But holds entire:</L>
<L>To Wife his Love is one: Nor is deny'd,</L>
<L>Nor looks above himself: The noble Hire</L>
<L>Of that alone deserves an equal Wife,</L>
<L>For all his Age is but another's Life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Woman's Birth, with Beauty being compar'd,</L>
<L>Is nothing to the Man: His Pedigree</L>
<L>Weighed with bad Fame: Is but to be ensnar'd</L>
<L>Betwixt two Mischiefs: Honour makes up three.</L>
<L>Remove that Fame, they both are excellent,</L>
<L>Add, and it makes the Ill more Eminent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wealth she may take, but cannot chuse the Wealth</L>
<L>If she loves well: Nor may she Wealth despise,</L>
<L>Although she hath enough: The outward Stealth</L>
<L>Of Fame and Credit on Expences lies,</L>
<L>With many more: Wealth is medicinal.</L>
<L>To the true Master, and Official.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good Nature is with Men much better far,</L>
<L>Than is the same with Women: Or than Art</L>

<LG>
<L>To chuse a Man by Art is frivolous,</L>
<L>For you must love his Nature, not his Art;</L>
<L>He cannot Art bestow in Love, and thus,</L>
<L>You challenge Nature as the chiefest part;</L>
<L>Which doth retain it self, yet render all,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Art is too subtle: Nature is too plain;</L>

<L>Love walks between; rejects all meer Disdain,</L>

<L>They love their Children as the Soul of both,</L>
<L>The Soul's Affections crave unequal rate:</L>
<L>Some follow Indiscretion, Shame, and Sloth,</L>
<L>Those we reclaim first; then we banish Hate;</L>
<L>Which leaves the Organ and resists the Vice,</L>
<L>Bad Children once; good be respected twice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Love still survives, and quickens in the Loss,</L>
<L>The Wife inherits all the Husband's Love:</L>
<L>As he receives of her: The chiefest Gloss</L>

<HEAD>The Metamorphosis of <HI>Baucis</HI> and <HI>Philemon,</HI> Burlesqu'd; from the <HI>8</HI>th Book of <HI>Ovid</HI>.</HEAD>
<L>IN Ancient Times, as Story tells,</L>
<L>The Saints would often leave their Cells,</L>
<L>And strole about, but hide their Quality,</L>
<L>To try good Peoples Hospitality.</L>
<L>It happen'd on a Winter-Night,</L>
<L>As Authors of the Legend write,</L>
<L>Two Brother Hermits, Saints by Trade,</L>
<L>Taking their Tour in Masquerade,</L>
<L>Disguis'd in Habits, poor and rent,</L>
<L>To a small Village in <HI>Somerset</HI> went;</L>
<L>Where in the Strolers Canting Strain,</L>
<L>They begg'd from Door to Door in vain;</L>
<L>Try'd ev'ry Tone might Pity win,</L>
<L>But not a Soul wou'd let them in.</L>
<L>Our wand'ring Saints in woful State,</L>
<L>Treated at this ungodly Rate.</L>
<L>Having through all the Village past,</L>
<L>To a small Cottage came at last,</L>
<L>Where dwelt a good honest Yeoman,</L>
<L>Call'd in the Neighbourhood <HI>Philemon</HI>,</L>
<L>Who kindly did the Saints invite</L>
<L>In his poor Hut to pass the Night;</L>
<L>And then the Hospital Sire,</L>
<L>Bid Goody <HI>Baucis</HI> mend the Fire;</L>
<L>Whilst he from out the Chimney took</L>
<L>A Flitch of Bacon off the Hook,</L>
<L>And freely from the fattest Side</L>
<L>Cut out large Slices to be fry'd:</L>
<L>Then stept aside to fetch them Drink,</L>
<L>Fill'd a large Jug up to the Brink,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="457"/>And saw it fairly twice go round;</L>
<L>Yet (what is wonderful) they found,</L>
<L>'Twas still replenish'd to the Top,</L>
<L>As if they ne'er had touch'd a Drop.</L>
<L>The good old Couple were amaz'd,</L>
<L>And often on each other gaz'd:</L>
<L>For both were frighted to the Heart,</L>
<L>And just began to cry, What art!</L>
<L>Then softly turn'd aside to view,</L>
<L>Whether the Lights were burning blue,</L>
<L>The gentle Saints were soon aware on't,</L>
<L>Told them their Calling, and their Errand:</L>
<L>Good Folks, you need not be afraid,</L>
<L>We are but Saints, the Hermits said,</L>
<L>No Hurt shall come to you or yours;</L>
<L>But for that pack of Churlish Boors,</L>
<L>Not fit to live on Christian Ground,</L>
<L>They, and their Houses, shall be drown'd:</L>
<L>Whilst you shall see your Cottage rise,</L>
<L>And grow a Church before your Eyes.</L>
<L>They scarce had spoke, when fair and soft,</L>
<L>The Roof began to mount aloft:</L>
<L>Aloft rose ev'ry Beam, and Rafter,</L>
<L>The heavy Wall climb'd slowly after.</L>
<L>The Chimney widen'd, and grew higher,</L>
<L>Became a Steeple with a Spire;</L>
<L>The Kettle to the Top was hoist,</L>
<L>And there stood fastned to a Joist;</L>
<L>But with the upside down, to shew</L>
<L>Its inclination for below.</L>
<L>In vain: For a Superiour Force</L>
<L>Apply'd at bottom▪ stops its Course,</L>
<L>Doom'd ever in suspense to dwell;</L>
<L>'Tis now no Kettle, but a Bell.</L>
<L>A Wooden Jack, which had almost,</L>

<L>A sudden Alteration feels,</L>

<L><PB N="5" REF="458"/>But what exalts the Wonder more,</L>

<L>Turn'd round so quick, you scarce cou'd see it;</L>
<L>But slacken'd by some secret Power,</L>
<L>Now hardly moves an Inch an Hour.</L>
<L>The Jack and Chimney near ally'd,</L>
<L>Had never left each others side;</L>
<L>The Chimney to a Steeple grown,</L>
<L>The Jack would not be left alone,</L>
<L>But up against the Steeple rear'd,</L>
<L>Became a Clock, and still adher'd:</L>
<L>And still its Love to Houshold Cares,</L>
<L>By a shrill Voice at Noon declares;</L>
<L>Warning the Cook-maid not to burn</L>
<L>That Roast-meat which it cannot turn.</L>
<L>The Groaning Chair began to crawl,</L>
<L>Like an huge Snail, along the Wall;</L>
<L>Then stuck aloft in publick view,</L>
<L>And with small Change a Pulpit grew.</L>
<L>The Porringers that in a Row,</L>
<L>Hung high, and made a glitt'ring show,</L>
<L>To a less noble Substance chang'd,</L>
<L>Were now but Leathern Buckets rang'd.</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Humbly sheweth,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>THat I went to warm my self in Lady <HI>Betty</HI>'s Cham∣ber, because I was Cold,</L>
<L>And I had in a Purse, Seven Pounds and Four Shillings, (besides Farthings) in Money, and Gold:</L>
<L>So because I had been buying things for my Lady last Night,</L>
<L>I was resolv'd to tell my Money, to see if it was right.</L>
<L>Now you must know, because my Trunk has a very bad Lock;</L>
<L>Therefore all the Money I have, which, God knows, is a very small Stock,</L>
<L>I keep in a Pocket ty'd about my middle, next my Smock.</L>
<L>So when I put up my Purse, as God would have it, my Smock was unript;</L>
<L>And instead of putting it into my Pocket, down it slipt.</L>
<L>Then the Bell rung, and I went down Stairs to put my Lady to Bed;</L>
<L>When, God knows, I thought my Money as safe as my Maidenhead.</L>
<L>So when I came up again, I found my Pocket very light;</L>
<L>But when I search'd and miss'd my Purse, Lord! I thought I should have sunk outright:</L>
<L>Lord! <HI>Madam</HI>, says <HI>Mary</HI>, how d'ye do? Indeed, says I, never worse:</L>
<L>But pray, <HI>Mary</HI>, can you tell what I have done with my Purse!</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="462"/>Lord help me, said <HI>Mary</HI>, I never stirr'd out of this Place!</L>
<L>Nay, said I, I had it in Lady <HI>Betty</HI>'s Chamber, that's a plain Case.</L>
<L>So <HI>Mary</HI> got me to Bed, and cover'd me up warm;</L>
<L>However, she stole away my Garters, that I might do my self no Harm:</L>
<L>So I tumbled and toss'd all Night, as you may very well think,</L>
<L>But hardly ever set my Eyes together, or slept a Wink.</L>
<L>So I was dream'd, methought, that we went and search'd the Folks round,</L>
<L>And in a corner of Mrs. <HI>Duke</HI>'s Box, ty'd in a Rag, the Money was found.</L>
<L>So next Morning we told <HI>Whittle</HI>, and he fell a swearing;</L>
<L>Then Mrs. <HI>Wadgar</HI> came, and she, you know, is thick o' hearing:</L>
<L>Dame, said I, as loud as I could bawl, do you know what a Loss I have had?</L>
<L>Nay, said she, my Lord <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gallaway.</NOTE> <HI>Collway</HI>'s Folks are all very sad.</L>

<L>And in all the Places I liv'd, I never heard of such a Thing.</L>
<L>Yes, says the Steward, when I was at my Lady <HI>Shrews∣bury</HI>'s,</L>
<L>Such a thing as this happen'd just about the time of Goosberries.</L>
<L>So I went to the Party suspected, and found her full of Grief;</L>
<L>Now you know, of all things in the World I hate a Thief:</L>
<L>However, I was resolv'd to bring the Discourse slily about,</L>
<L>Mrs. <HI>Duke</HI>'s, said I, here's an ugly Accident has happen'd out;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="463"/>'Tis not that I value the Money Three Skips of a Louse</L>
<L>But the thing I stand upon, is the Credit of the House:</L>

<L>Besides, as they say, Service is no Inheritance in these Ages.</L>
<L>Now Mrs. <HI>Dukes</HI>, you know, and every Body under∣stands,</L>
<L>That tho' 'tis hard to judge—Money can't go without Hands.</L>
<L>The Devil take me, said she, blessing her self, if ever saw't!</L>
<L>So she roar'd like a Bedlam, as tho' I had call'd her to naught:</L>
<L>So you know, what could I say to her any more,</L>

<L>No, said I, 'tis the same thing, the Chaplain will be here anon.</L>
<L>So the Chaplain came in; now the Servants say, he is my Sweet-heart,</L>

<L>With that, he twisted his Girdle like a Rope, as who should say,</L>
<L>Now you may go hang your self for me, and so went away.</L>
<L>Well, I thought I should have swoon'd: Lord, said I, what shall I do?</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have lost my Money, and shall lose my True-Love too.</L>
<L>Then my Lord call'd me; <HI>Harris</HI>, said my Lord, don't cry,</L>
<L>I'll give something towards thy Loss; and, says my Lady, so will I.</L>
<L>Oh but, said I, what if after all, my Chaplain won't come to?</L>
<L>For that, he said, (and't please your Excellencies) I must petition you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Premisses tenderly consider'd, I desire your Excel∣lencies Protection,</L>

<L>MIss <HI>Molly</HI>, a fam'd Toast, was Fair and Young,</L>
<L>Had Wealth and Charms,—but then she had Tongue!</L>
<L>From Morn to Night th' Eternal Larum run,</L>
<L>Which often lost those Hearts her Eyes had won.</L>
<L>Sir <HI>John</HI> was smitten, and confess'd his Flame,</L>
<L>Sigh'd out the usual Time, then wed the Dame:</L>
<L>Possess'd he thought of ev'ry Joy of Life,</L>
<L>But his dear <HI>Molly</HI> prov'd a Very Wife.</L>
<L>Excess of Fondness did in Time decline,</L>
<L><HI>Madam</HI> lov'd Money, and the <HI>Knight</HI> lov'd Wine.</L>
<L>From whence some petty Discord would arise,</L>
<L><HI>As,</HI> You're a Fool; — <HI>and,</HI> You are mighty Wise!</L>
<L>Tho' he and all the World allow'd her Wit,</L>
<L>Her Voice was shrill, and rather loud than sweet.</L>
<L>When she began, —for Hat and Sword he'd call,</L>
<L>Then, after a faint Kiss, —Cry, B'y, Dear <HI>Moll</HI>:</L>
<L>Supper and Friends expect me at the <HI>Rose</HI>.</L>
<L>And, what, Sir <HI>John</HI>, You'l get your usual Dose!</L>
<L>Go, stink of Smoak, and gusle nasty Wine,</L>
<L>Sure, never Virtuous Love was us'd like mine!</L>
<L>Oft, as the watchful Bellman march'd his Round,</L>
<L>At a fresh Bottle gay Sir <HI>John</HI> he found.</L>
<L>By Four the <HI>Knight</HI> would get his Business done,</L>
<L>And only then reel'd off,— because alone;</L>
<L>Full well he knew the dreadful Storm to come,</L>

<L>What, can't you find one Bed about the House!</L>
<L>Will that perpetual Clack lie never still!</L>
<L>That Rival to the Softness of a Mill!</L>
<L>Some Couch and distant Room must be my Choice,</L>
<L>Where I may sleep uncurs'd with Wife and Noise.</L>
<L>Long this uncomfortable Life they led,</L>
<L>With snarling Meals, and each a separate Bed.</L>
<L>To an old Uncle oft she would complain,</L>

<L>Old <HI>Wisewood</HI> smoak'd the Matter as it was,</L>

<L>Why, How now, <HI>Molly</HI>, What's the Crotchet now?</L>

<L>Nay, kiss me, <HI>Molly</HI>, for I'm much inclin'd.</L>
<L>Her Lace she cuts to take him in the Mind.</L>
<L>Thus the Fond Pair to Bed enamour'd went,</L>

<L>For many Days these Fond Endearments pass'd,</L>
<L>The Reconciling Bottle fails at last;</L>
<L>'Twas us'd and gone,—Then Midnight Storms arose</L>
<L>And Looks and Words, the Union discompose.</L>
<L>Her Coach is order'd, and Post-haste she flies;</L>

<L>Her Knight's Conversion, and her happy State!</L>
<L>Why, Neece, says he,— I prithee apprehend,</L>

<L>HOW this Fantastick World is chang'd of late!</L>
<L>Sure some Full Moon has work'd upon the State:</L>
<L>Time was, when it was question'd much in Story.</L>
<L>Which best deserv'd, the <HI>Devil</HI> or a <HI>Tory</HI>?</L>
<L>But now, alass! those happy Times are o'er,</L>

<L>Pleas'd with the Bliss, their Friendly Union made,</L>
<L>Beneath the bending Olive's peaceful Shade,</L>
<L>Careless and free her happy <HI>Sons</HI> were laid.</L>
<L>No Feuds, no groundless Jealousys appear</L>
<L>To rouze their Rage, or wake them into Fear:</L>
<L>With Pity they beheld a Neighb'ring State,</L>
<L>Tost by the Tempest of a stormy Fate;</L>
<L>Wild Frenzy thro' her blasted Borders past,</L>
<L>Whilst noisy Faction drove the furious Blast;</L>
<L>Calm and serene we heard the Tempest roar,</L>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P><HI>A</HI> Poem with so bold a Title, and a Name prefix'd, from which the handling of so serious a subject wou'd not be expected, may reasonably oblige the Author, to say somewhat in defence both of himself, and of his undertaking. In the first place, if it be objected to me, that being a <HI>Layman</HI>, I ought not to have concern'd my self with Speculations, which belong to the Profession of <HI>Divinity;</HI> I cou'd Answer, that perhaps, Laymen, with equal advantages of Parts and Knowledge, are not the most incompetent Judges of Sacred things; But in the due sense of my own weakness and want of Learning, I plead not this: I pretend not to make my self a Judge of Faith, in others, but only to make a Confession of my own; I lay no unhallowed hand upon the Ark; but wait on it, with the Reverence that becomes me at a di∣stance: In the next place I will ingeniously confess, that the helps I have us'd in this small Treatise, were many of them taken from the Works of our own Reverend Divines of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> so that the Weapons with which I combat Irreligion are already consecrated; though I suppose they may be taken down as lawfully as the Sword of <HI>Goliah</HI> was by <HI>David,</HI> when they are to be employed for the common Cause, against the Enemies of Piety. I intend not by this to intitle them to any of my errours; which, yet, I hope are only those of Charity to Mankind; and such as my <HI>own</HI> charity has caus'd me to commit, that of <HI>others</HI> may mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> easily excuse. Being naturally inclin'd to Scepticism in Philosophy, I have no reason to impose my Opinions, in a Subject which is above it But whatever they are, I submit them with all Reverence to my Mo∣ther Church, accounting them no farther mine, than as they are autho∣riz'd, or at least, uncondemn'd by her. And indeed, to secure my self on this side, I have us'd the necessary Precaution, of showing this Pa∣per before it was publish'd to a judicious and learned Friend, a man in∣defatigably zealous in the service of the Church and State: and whose Writings have highly deserv'd of both. He was pleas'd to approve the body of the Discourse, and I hope he is more my Friend, than to do it our of Complaisance: 'Tis true he had too good a taste to like it all; and amongst some other faults recommended to my second view, what I have written, perhaps too boldly, on St. <HI>Athanasius:</HI> which he advised m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wholly to omit. I am sensible enough that I had done more <HI>prudently</HI> to have follow'd his opinion: But then I could not have satisfied m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="506"/>
self, that I had done honestly not to have written what was my own. It has always been my <HI>thought,</HI> that Heathens, who never did, nor with∣out Miracle cou'd here of the Name of Christ, were yet in a possibility of Salvation. Neither will it enter easily into my belief, that before the coming of our Saviour, the whole World, excepting only the Jewish Nation, shou'd lye under the inevitable necessity of everlasting Punish∣ment, for want of that Revelation, which was confin'd to so small a spot of ground as that of <HI>Palestine</HI>. Among the Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> we read of one onely who was accurs'd; and if a blessing in the ripeness of time was re∣serv'd for <HI>Japhet,</HI> (of whose Progeny we are,) it seems unaccountable to me, why so many Generations of the same Offspring, as preceeded our Saviour in the Flesh, shou'd be all involv'd in one common condemnation, and yet that their Posterity shou'd be entituled to the hopes of Salvation: As if a Bill of Exclusion had passed only on the Fathers, which debarr'd not the Sons from their Succession. Or that so many Ages had been <HI>de∣liver'd over</HI> to Hell, and so many <HI>reserv'd</HI> for Heaven, and that the Devil had the first choice, and God the next. Truly I am apt to think, that the revealed Religion which was taught by <HI>Noah</HI> to all his Sons might continue for some Ages in the whole Posterity. That afterwards it was included wholly in the Family of <HI>Sem</HI> is manifest: but when the Progenies of <HI>Cham</HI> and <HI>Japhet</HI> swarm'd into Colonies, and those Colonies were subdivided into many others; in process of time their Descendants lost by little and little the Primitive and Purer Rites of Divine Wor∣ship, retaining only the notion of one Deity; to which succeeding Gene∣rations added others: (for men took their Degrees in those Ages from Conquerors to Gods.) Revelation being thus eclipsed to almost all Man∣kind, the light of Nature as the next in Dignity was substituted; and that is it which St. <HI>Paul</HI> concludes to be the Rule of the Heathens; and by which they are hereafter to be judg'd. If my supposition be true, then the consequence which I have assum'd in my Poem may be also true; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amely, that Deism, or the Principles of Natural Worship, are only the faint remnants or dying flames of reveal'd Religion in the Posteri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of <HI>Noah</HI>. And that our Modern Philosophers, nay and some of our Philosophising Divines have too much exalted the faculties of our Souls, when they have maintain'd that by their force mankind has been able <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o find out that there is one Supreme Agent or Intellectual Being which we call God: that Praise and Prayer are his due Worship; and the rest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f those deducements, which I am confident are the remote effects of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evelation, and unattainable by our Discourse, I mean as simply consi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered, and without the benefit of Divine Illumination. So that we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave not lifted up our selves to God, by the weak Pinions of our Reason <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been pleased to descend to us: and what <HI>Socrates</HI> said of him, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat <HI>Plato</HI> writ, and the rest of the Heathen Philosophers of several <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations, is all no more than the Twilight of Revelation, after the Sun <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was set in the Race of <HI>Noah</HI>. That there is something above us, one Principle of <HI>motion,</HI> our Reason can apprehend, though it cannot
<PB N="6" REF="507"/>
discover what it is, by its own Virtue. And indeed it is very improba∣ble, that we, who by the strength of our faculties cannot enter into the knowledge of any <HI>Being,</HI> not so much as of our <HI>own,</HI> should be able to find out by them, that Supreme Nature, which we cannot otherwise define, than by saying it is Infinite; as if Infinite were definable, or In∣finity a Subject for our narrow understanding. They who wou'd prove Religion by Reason, do but weaken the cause which they endeavour to sup∣port: 'tis to take away the Pillar from our Faith, and to prop it only with a twig: 'tis to design a Tower like that of <HI>Babel,</HI> which if it were possible (as it is not) to reach Heaven would come to nothing by the confusion of the Workmen. For every man is Building a several way; impotently conceited of his own Model, and his own Materials▪ Rea∣son is always striving, and always at a loss: and of necessity it must so come to pass, while 'tis exercis'd about that which is not its proper ob∣ject. Let us be content at last, to know God by his own Methods; at least so much of him, as he is pleas'd to reveal to us in the Sacred Scrip∣tures; to apprehend them to be the Word of God, is all our Reason has to do; for all beyond it is the work of Faith, which is the Seal of Hea∣ven impress'd upon our human understanding.</P>
<P>And now for what concerns the Holy Bishop <HI>Athanasius,</HI> the Preface of whose Creed seems inconsistent with my opinion; which is, that Hea∣thens may possibly be sav'd; in the first place I desire it may be consider'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that it is the Preface only, not the Creed it self, which, (till I am bet∣ter inform'd) is of too hard a digestion for my Charity. 'Tis not that I am ignorant how many several Texts of Scripture seemingly suppor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Cause: but neither am I ignorant how all those Texts may receive a kinder, and more mollified Interpretation. Every man who is read in Church History knows <HI>that</HI> Belief was drawn up after a long contestati∣on with <HI>Arrius,</HI> concerning the Divinity of our Blessed Saviour, and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being one Substance with the Father; and that thus compil'd, it was sent abroad among the Christian Churches, as a kind of Test, which whoso∣ever took, was look'd on as an Orthodox Believer 'Tis manifest from hence, that the Heathen part of the Empire was not concerned in it: for its business was not to distinguish betwixt Pagans and Christians, but betwixt Hereticks and true Believers. This, well consider'd, takes of the Heavy weight of Censure, which I wou'd willingly avoid from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> venerable a Man; for if this Proportion, <HI>Whosoever will be sav'd,</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> restrained only to those to whom it was intended, and for whom it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> composed, I mean the Christians; then the Anathema reaches not th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heathens, who had never heard of Christ, and were nothing interess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in that dispute. After all, I am far from blaming even that Prefator<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> addition to the Creed▪ and as far from cavelling at the continuation of it in the Liturgy of the Church; where, on the days appointed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> publickly read: For, I suppose, there is the same reason for it now, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> opposition to the <HI>So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ini<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> as there was then against the <HI>Arrians;</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being a Heresie which seems to have been refin'd out of the other
<PB N="7" REF="508"/>
and with how much more plausibility of Reason it combats our Religion, with so much more caution to be avoided: and therefore the prudence of our Church is to be commended, which has interpos'd her Authority for the recommendation of this Creed. Yet to such as are grounded in the true believe, those explanatory Creeds, the <HI>Nicene</HI> and this of <HI>Athana∣sius</HI> might perhaps be spar'd: for what is supernatural, will always be a Mystery in spight of Exposition: and for my own part the plain Apo∣stles Creed is most suitable to my weak understanding; as the simplest diet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most easie of Digestion.</P>
<P>I have dwelt longer on this Subject than I intended; and longer than, perhaps, I ought; for having laid down, as my Foundation, that the Scripture is a Rule; that in all things needful to Salvation, it is clear, sufficient, and ordain'd by God Almighty for that purpose, I have left my self no right to interpret obscure places, such as concern the possi∣bility of eternal happiness to Heathens: because whatsoever is obscure is concluded not necessary to be known.</P>
<P>But by asserting the Scripture to be the Canon of our Faith, I have unavoidably created to my self two sorts of Enemies: The Papists in∣deed, more directly, because they have kept the Scripture from us, what they cou'd; and have reserv'd to themselves a right of Interpreting what they have deliver'd under the pretence of Infallibility: and the Fana∣ticks more collaterally, because they have assum'd what amounts to an Infallibility, in the private Spirit: and have detorted those Texts of Scripture, which are not necessary to Salvation, to the damnable uses of Sedition, disturbance and destruction of the Civil Government. To be∣gin with the Papists, and to speak freely, I think them the less dange∣rous (at least in appearance to our present State) for not only the Pe∣nal Laws are in Force against them, and their number is contemptible; but also their Peerage and Commons are excluded from Parliaments, and consequently those Laws in no probability of being Repeald. A General and Uninterrupted Plot of their Clergy, ever since the Reformation, I suppose all Protestants believe. For 'tis not reasonable to think but that so many of their Orders, as were outed from their fat Possessions, wou'd endeavour a re-entrance against those whom they account Hereticks. As for the late design, Mr. <HI>Coleman's</HI> Letters, for ought I know are the best Evidence; and what they discover, without wyre-drawing their Sense, or malicious Glosses, all Men of reason conclude credible. If there be any thing more than this requir'd of me, I must believe it as well as I am able, in spight of the Witnesses, and out of a decent conformity to the Votes of Parliament: For I suppose the Fanaticks will not allow the private Spirit in this Case: Here the Infallibility is at least in one part of the Government; and our understandings as well as our wills are represented. But to return to the Roman Catholicks, how can we be se∣cure from the practice of Jesuited Papists in that Religion; For not two or three of that Order, as some of them would impose upon us, but a∣most the whole Body of them are of opinion, that their infallible Master
<PB N="8" REF="509"/>
has a right over Kings, not only in Spirituals but Temporals. Not to name <HI>Mariano. Bellarmine, Emanuel Sa, Molina, Sentaret, Simanca</HI> and at least twenty others of Foreign Countries; we can produce of our own Nation, <HI>Campian,</HI> and <HI>Doleman</HI> or <HI>Parsons,</HI> besides many are nam'd whom I have not read, who all of them attest this Doctrine, that the Pope can depose and give away the Right of any Sovereign Prince, <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vel paulum deflexerit,</HI> if he shall never so little Worp: but if he once comes to be Excommunicated, then the Bond of obedience is taken off from Subjects; and they may and ought to drive him like another <HI>Nebuchad∣nezzar, ex hominum Christianorum Dominatu,</HI> from exercising Domi∣nion over Christians: and to this they are bound by virtue of Divine Precept, and by all the tyes of Conscience under no less Penalty than Damnation. If they answer me (as a Learned Priest has lately Writ∣ten,) that this Doctrine of the Jesuites is not <HI>de fide,</HI> and that conse∣quently they are not oblig'd by it, they must pardon me, if I think they have said nothing to the purpose; for 'tis a Maxim in their Church▪ where Points of Faith are not decided, and that Doctors are of contrary opinions, they may follow which part they please: but more safely the most receiv'd and most authoriz'd. And their Champion <HI>Bellarmine</HI> has told the World, in his Apology, that the King of <HI>England</HI> is a Vassal to the Pope, <HI>ratione directi Domini,</HI> and that he holds in Villanage of his Roman Landlord. Which is no new claim put in for <HI>England</HI>. Our Chronicles are his Authentique Witnesses, that, King <HI>John</HI> was depos'd by the same Plea, and <HI>Phillip Augustus</HI> admitted Tenant. And which makes the more for <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> the French King was again ejected when our King submitted to the Church, and the Crown receiv'd under th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sordid Condition of a Vassalage.</P>
<P>'Tis not sufficient for the more moderate and well-meaning Papists, (of which I doubt not there are many) to produce the Evidences of their Loy∣alty to the late King, and to declare their Innocency in this Plot; I will grant their behaviour in the first, to have been as Loyal and as brav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as they desire; and will be willing to hold them excus'd as to the second▪ (I mean when it comes to my turn, and after my betters; for 'tis a mad∣ness to be sober alone, while the Nation continues Drunk:) but that Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing of their Father <HI>Cres.</HI> is still running in my head, that they may be dispens'd with in their Obedience to an Heretick Prince, while the neces∣sity of the times shall oblige them to it: (for that (as another of them tells us,) is only the effect of Christian Prudence) but when once they shall get power to shake him off, an Heretick is no lawful King, and con∣sequently to rise against him is no Rebellion. I should be glad therefore that they wou'd follow the advice which was charitably given them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Reverend Prelate of our Church; namely, that they would joyn in by publick Act of disowning and detesting those Jesuitick Principles; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subscribe to all Doctrines which deny the Pope's Authority of Deposing Kings, and releasing Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance: to which I should think they might easily be induc'd, if it be true that this prese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="9" REF="510"/>
Pope has condemn'd the Doctrine of King killing (a Thesis of the Jesuites) amongst others <HI>ex Cathedra</HI> (as they call it) or in open Consistory.</P>
<P>Leaving them, therefore, in so fair a way (if they please themselves) of satisfying all reasonable Men, of their sincerity and good meaning to the Government, I shall make bold to consider that other extreme of our Religion, I mean the Fanaticks, or Schismaticks, of the English Church. Since the Bible has been translated into our Tongue, they have us'd it so, as if their business was not to be sav'd, but to be damn'd by its Contents, if me consider only them, better had it been for the English Nation, that it had still remain'd in the original Greek and Hebrew, or at least in the honest Latin of St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> than that several Texts in it, should have been prevaricated to the destruction of that Government which put it into so ungrateful hands.</P>
<P>How many Heresies the first Translation of <HI>Tyndal</HI> produce in few years, let my Lord <HI>Herbert</HI>'s History of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth inform you; Insomuch that for the gross errours in it, and the great mischiefs it oc∣casion'd, a Sentence pass'd on the first Edition of the Bible, too shame∣ful almost to be repeated. After the short Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth (who had continued to carry on the Reformation, on other Principles than it was begun) every one knows that not only the chief Promoters of that Work, but many others, whose Consciences wou'd not dispence with Popery, were forc'd for fear of persecution, to change Climates: from whence returning at the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, many of them who had been in <HI>France,</HI> and at <HI>Geneva,</HI> brought back the rigid opinions and imperious discipline of <HI>Calvin,</HI> to graff upon our Reformation, which though they cunningly conceal'd at first, (as well knowing how nauseously that Drug wou'd go down in a lawful Mo∣narchy, which was prescrib'd for a rebellious Common-wealth) yet they always kept it in reserve; and were never wan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to themselves either in Court or Parliament, when either they had any prospect of a nume∣rous Party of Fanatick Members in the one, or the Encouragement of any Favourite in the other, whose Covetousness was gaping at the Patrimo∣ny of the Church. They who will consult the Works of our venerable <HI>Hooker,</HI> or the account of his Life, or more particularly the Letter writ∣ten to him on his Subject, by <HI>George Cranmer,</HI> may see by what grada∣tions they proceeded; from the dislike of Cap and Surplice, the very next step was Admonitions to the Parliament against the whole Government Ecclesiastical: then came out Volumes in English and Latin in defence of their Tenets: and immediately Practices were set on foot to erect their Discipline without Authority. Those not succeeding, Satyr and Railing was the next: And <HI>Martin Mar-Prelate</HI> (the <HI>Marvel</HI> of those times) was the first Presbyterian Scribler, who sanctify'd Libels and Scurrility to the use of the Good Old Cause. Which was done (say's my Author) upon this account; that (their serious Treatises having been fully answered and refuted) they might compass by railing what they had lost by reason∣ing; and when their Cause was sunk in Court and Parliament, they
<PB N="10" REF="511"/>
might at least hedge in a stake amongst the Rabble: for to their igno∣rance all things are Wit which are abusive; but if Church and State were made the Theme, then the Doctoral Degree of Wit was to be taken at <HI>Billingsgate:</HI> even the Most Saint-like of the Party, though they durst not excuse this contempt and villyfying of the Government, yet were pleas'd, and grin'd at it with a pious smile; and call'd it a judgment of God against the Hierarchy. Thus Sectaries, we may see, were born with teeth, foul mouth'd and scurrilous from their infancy: and if Spi∣ritual Pride, Venome, Violence. Contempt of Superiours and Slander had been the marks of Orthodox Belief; the Presbytery and the rest of our Schismaticks, which are their Spawn, were always the Most visible Church in the Christian World.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Government was too strong at that time for a Rebelli∣on; but to shew what proficiency they had made in <HI>Calvin</HI>'s School, even <HI>Then</HI> their mouth's water'd at it: for two of their gifted Brotherhood (<HI>Hacket</HI> and <HI>Coppinger</HI>) as the Story tells us, got up into a Pease-Cart, and harangued the People, to dispose them to an Insurrection, and to establish the Discipline by force: so that however it comes about, that now they celebrate Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Birth-night, as that of their Saint and Patroness; yet then they were for doing the work of the Lord by Arms against her; and in all probability, they wanted but a Fana∣tique Lord Mayor and two Sheriffs of their Party to have compass'd it.</P>
<P>Our venerable <HI>Hooker,</HI> after many Admonitions which he had given them, toward the end of his Preface, breaks out into this Prophetick Speech, <Q>“<HI>There is in every one of these Considerations most just cause to f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, lest our hastiness to embrace a thing of so perilous conse∣quence</HI> (meaning the Presbyterian Discipline) <HI>should cause Posteri∣ty to feel those Evils, which as yet are more easie for us to prevent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endq;than they would be for them to remedy</HI>.</Q></P>
<P>How fatally this <HI>Cassandra</HI> has foretold we know too well by sad ex∣perience: the Seeds were sown in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the bloody Harvest ripened in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr: and because all the Sheaves could not be carried off without shedding some of the loose Grains, another Crop is too like to follow; nay I fear 'tis unavoidable, if the Conventiclers be permitted still to scatter.</P>
<P>A man may be suffer'd to quote an Adversary to our Religion, when he speaks Truth: and 'tis the observation of <HI>Melmbourgh</HI> in his Histo∣ry of Calvinism, that where-ever this Discipline was planted and em∣brac'd, Rebellion, Civil-War and Misery attended it. And how in∣deed should it happen otherwise? Reformation of Church and State has always been the ground of our Divisions in <HI>England</HI>. While we are Papists, our Holy Father rid us, by pretending authority out of the Scriptures to depose Princes, when we shook off his Authority, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ries furnish'd themselves with the same Weapons; and out of the same Magazine, the Bible. So that the Scriptures, which are in themselves the greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Governours, as Commanding <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="11" REF="512"/>
them, are now turn'd to their destruction; and never since the Refor∣mation, has there wanted a Text of their interpreting to Authorize a Rebel. And 'tis to be noted by the way, that the Doctrines of King kil∣ling and Deposing, which have been taken up only by the worst Party of the Papists, the most frontless Flatterers of the Pope's Authority, have been espous'd, defended and are still maintain'd by the whole body of Non-conformists and Republicans. 'Tis but dubbing themselves the People of God, which 'tis the Interest of their Preachers to tell them they are and their own Interest to believe; and after that, they cannot dip into the Bible, but one Text or another will turn up for their purpose: If they are under Persecution (as they call it,) then that is a mark of their Election; of their flourish, then God works Miracles for their Deliverance, and the Saints are to possess the Earth.</P>
<P>They may think themselves to be too roughly handled in this Paper; but I who know best how far I could have gone on this Subject, must be hold to tell them they are spar'd: though at the same time I am not Ig∣norant that they interpret the mildness of a Writer to them, as they do the mercy of the Government; in the one they think it Fear, and con∣clude it Weakness in the other. The best way for them to confute me, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as I before advis'd the Papists, to disclaim their Principles, and re∣nounce their Practices. We shall all be glad to think them true English∣men when they obey the King, and true Protestants when they conform to the Church Discipline.</P>
<P>It remains that I acquaint the Reader, that the Verses were written for an ingenious young Gentleman, my Friend; upon his Translation of <HI>The Critical History of the Old Testament,</HI> compos'd by the learned Fa∣ther <HI>Simon:</HI> The Verses therefore are addressed to the Translator of that Work, and the style of them is, what it ought to be, Epistolary.</P>
<P>If any one be so lamentable a Critick as to require the Smoothness, the Numbers and the Turn of Heroick Poetry of this Poem, I must tell him, that if he has not read <HI>Horace,</HI> I have studied him, and hope the style of his Epistles is not ill imitated here. The Expressions of a Poem, design'd purely for instruction, ought to be Plain and Natural, and yet Majestick: for here the Poet is presum'd to be a kind of Law giver, and those three qualities which I have nam'd are proper to the Legislative style. The Horid, Elevated and Figurative way is for the Passions; for Love and Hatred, Fear and Anger, are begotten in the Soul by shewing their Ob∣jects out of their true proportion, either greater than the Life, or less; but instruction i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be given by shewing them what they naturally are. A Man is to be cheated into Passion, but to be reason'd into Truth.</P>

<L>The few, by Nature form'd, with Learning fraught,</L>

<L>Not that Tradition's parts are useless here:</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is strange to think, in an Age so addicted to the <HI>Muses,</HI> how <HI>Pastoral Poetry</HI> comes to be never so much as thought upon; considering especially, that it has always been accounted the most considerable of the smaller Poems: <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Spencer</HI> made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of it as a Prelude to <HI>Heroick Poetry</HI>. But I fear the Innocency of the Subject makes it so little inviting at present.</P>
<P>There is no sort of Poetry, if well wrought, but gives Delight. And the <HI>Pastoral</HI> perhaps may boast of this in a peculiar manner. For, as in Painting, so I believe, in Poetry, the Country affords the most entertaining Scenes, and most delightful Prospects.</P>
<P><HI>Gassendus,</HI> I remember, tells us, That <HI>Peireskius</HI> was a great Lover of Musick, especially that of Birds; because their Artless Strains seem to have less of Passion and Vio∣lence, but more of a natural Easiness, and therefore do the rather befriend Contemplation. It is after the same manner that <HI>Pastoral</HI> gives a sweet and gentle Composure to the Mind; whereas the <HI>Epick</HI> and <HI>Tragick</HI> Poems put the Spirits in too great a Ferment by the Vehemence of their Motions.</P>
<P>To see a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately, well built Palace strikes us, indeed, with Admiration, and swells the Soul, as it were, with Notions of Grandeur. But when I view a little Country Dwelling, advantageously situated amidst a beautiful Va∣riety of Fields, Woods, and Rivers, I feel an unspeakable kind of Satisfaction, and cannot forbear wishing, that my good Fortune would place me in so sweet a Retirement.</P>
<P><HI>Theocritus, Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Spencer,</HI> are the only Writers that seeem to have hit upon the true Nature of <HI>Pastoral</HI> Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ems. So that it will be Honour sufficient for me, if I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not altogether fail'd in my Attempt.</P>

<L>IF we, O <HI>Dorset</HI>, quit the City Throng</L>
<L>To meditate in Shades the Rural Song</L>
<L>By your Commands; be present: And, O, bring</L>
<L>The Muse along! The Muse to you shall sing.</L>
<L>Begin. — A Sepherd Boy, one Ev'ning fair,</L>
<L>As Western Winds had cool'd the sultry Air,</L>
<L>When as his Sheep within their Fold were pent,</L>
<L>Thus plain'd him of his dreary Discontent;</L>
<L>So pitiful, that all the Starry Throng</L>
<L>Attentive seem'd to hear his mournful Song.</L>
<L>Ah well a Day! How long must I endure</L>
<L>This pining Pain? Or who shall work my Cure?</L>
<L>Fond Love no Cure will have; seeks no Repose;</L>
<L>Delights in Grief; nor any Measure knows.</L>
<L>And now the Moon begins in Clouds to rise;</L>
<L>The twinkling Stars are lighted in the Skies;</L>
<L>The Winds are hush'd; the Dews distil; and Sleep</L>
<L>With soft Embrace has seiz'd my weary Sheep.</L>
<L>I only, with the proaling Wolf, constrain'd</L>
<L>All Night to wake. With Hunger is he pain'd,</L>
<L>And I with Love. His Hunger he may tame:</L>
<L>But who in Love can stop the growing Flame?</L>
<L>Whilome did I, all as this Pop'lar fair,</L>
<L>Up raise my heedless Head, devoid of Care,</L>
<L>'Mong rustick Routs the chief for wanton Game;</L>
<L>Nor could they merry make 'till <HI>Lobbin</HI> came.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="529"/>Who better seen, than I, in Shepherds Arts,</L>

<L>O think, unwitting Maid, while yet is Time,</L>

<L>Thy Virgin Bloom will not for ever stay;</L>
<L>And Flow'rs, tho' left ungather'd, will decay.</L>
<L>The Flow'rs a new returning Seasons bring;</L>
<L>But Beauty faded has no second Spring.</L>
<L>My Words are Wind! She, deaf to all my Cries,</L>
<L>Takes Pleasure in the Mischief of her Eyes.</L>
<L>Like F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isking Heifers, loose in Flow'ry Meads,</L>

<L>While, wing'd with Scorn, she flies my fond Embrace.</L>

<L>IN Rural Strains we first our Musick try,</L>

<L>Distrustful of our Skill. Yet, if thro' Time</L>
<L>Our Voice improving gain a Pitch Sublime,</L>
<L>Thy growing Virtues, <HI>Sackvil</HI>, shall engage</L>
<L>My riper Verse, and my more settled Age.</L>
<L>The Sun now mounted to the Noon of Day,</L>
<L>Began to shoot direct his burning Ray,</L>
<L>When, with the Flocks, their Feeders sought the Shade,</L>
<L>A Venerable Oak wide-spreading, made.</L>
<L>What should they do to pass the loit'ring Time?</L>
<L>As Fancy led, each form'd his Tale in Rhyme:</L>
<L>And some the Joys, and some the Pains of Love,</L>
<L>And some to set out strange Adventures strove;</L>
<L>The Trade of Wizzards some, and <HI>Merlin</HI>'s Skill,</L>
<L>And whence to charm such Empire o'er the Will.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Cuddy</HI> last (who <HI>Cuddy</HI> can excel,</L>
<L>In neat Device?) his Tale began to tell.</L>
<L>When Shepherds flourish'd in <HI>Eliza</HI>'s Reign,</L>
<L>There liv'd in great Esteem a jolly Swain,</L>
<L>Young <HI>Colin Clout</HI>; who well could pipe and sing,</L>
<L>And by his Notes invite the lagging Spring.</L>
<L>He, as his Custom was, at leisure laid</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n silent Shade, without a Rival play'd.</L>
<L>Drawn by the Magick of th' inticing Sound,</L>
<L>What Crouds of mute Admirers flock'd around!</L>
<L>The Steerlings left their Food; and Creatures wild</L>
<L>By Nature form'd, insensibly grew mild.</L>
<L>He makes the Birds in Troops about him throng,</L>
<L>And loads th' neighb'ring Branches with his Song.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="543"/>Among the rest, a Nightingale of Fame,</L>
<L>Jealous, and fond of Praise, to listen came.</L>
<L>She turn'd her Ear; and Emulous, with Pride,</L>
<L>Like Eccho, to the Shepherd's Pipe reply'd.</L>
<L>The Shepherd heard with Wonder; and again,</L>
<L>To try her more, renew'd his various Strain.</L>
<L>To all his various Strain she shapes her Throat,</L>
<L>And adds peculiar Grace to ev'ry Note.</L>
<L>If <HI>Colin</HI> in complaining Accents grieves,</L>
<L>Or brisker Motion to his Measure gives;</L>
<L>If gentle Sounds he modulates, or strong,</L>
<L>She, not a little vain, repeats his Song:</L>
<L>But so repeats, that <HI>Colin</HI> half despis'd</L>
<L>His Pipe and Skill so much by others priz'd,</L>
<L>And sweetest Songster of the Winged Kind,</L>
<L>What Thanks, said he, what Praises can I find</L>
<L>To equal thy melodious Voice? In thee</L>
<L>The Rudeness of my Rural Fife I see;</L>
<L>From thee I learn to vaunt no more my Skill.</L>
<L>Aloft in Air she fate▪ provoking still</L>
<L>The vanquish'd Swain: Provok'd at last, he strove</L>

<L>His utmost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt: if so some small Esteem</L>
<L>He might obtain, and Credit lost, redeem.</L>
<L>He draws in Breath, his rising Breast to fill;</L>
<L>Thro' all the Wood his Pipe is heard to shrill.</L>
<L>Fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Note to Note in haste his Fingers fly;</L>

<L>The Shepherd, in his own harmonious Lays;</L>
<L>Thro' ev'ry changing Cadence runs at length,</L>
<L>And adds in Sweetness, what she wants in Strength</L>
<L>Then <HI>Colin</HI> threw his Fife disgrac'd aside;</L>
<L>While she loud Triumph sings, proclaiming wide</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="544"/>Her mighty Conquest. What could <HI>Colin</HI> more?</L>
<L>A little Harp of Maple Ware, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bore:</L>
<L>The Harp it self was Old, but Newly strung,</L>
<L>Which usual he a-cross his Shoulders hung.</L>
<L>Now take, delightful Bird, my last Farewel,</L>
<L>He said; and learn from hence, thou dost excel</L>
<L>No trivial Artist. And at that he wound</L>
<L>The murm'ring Strings, and order'd ev'ry Sound.</L>
<L>Then earnest to his Instrument he bends,</L>
<L>And both his Hands upon the Strings extends.</L>
<L>The Strings obey his Touch, and various move,</L>
<L>The low'r answ'ring still to those above.</L>
<L>His restless Fingers traverse to and fro,</L>
<L>And in Pursuit of Harmony they go;</L>
<L>Now, lightly skimming, o'er the Strings they pass,</L>
<L>Like Winds, that gently brush the plying Grass,</L>
<L>And melting Airs arise at their Command:</L>
<L>And now, laborious, with a weighty Hand</L>
<L>He sinks into the Cords with solemn Pace,</L>
<L>And gives the swelling Tonges a Manly Grace:</L>
<L>Then, intricate he blends agreeing Sounds,</L>
<L>While Musick thro' the trembling Harp abounds.</L>
<L>The double Sounds the Nightingale perplex,</L>
<L>And pos'd, she does her troubled Spirit vex.</L>
<L>She warbles di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fident, 'twixt Hope and Fear,</L>
<L>And hits imperfect Accents, here and there.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Colin</HI> play'd again, and playing Sung.</L>
<L>She, with the Fatal Love of Glory stung,</L>
<L>Hears all in Pain: her Heart begins to swell;</L>
<L>In piteous Notes she sighs, in Notes that tell</L>
<L>Her bitter Anguish. He, still singing, plies</L>
<L>His limber Joints: Her Sorrows higher rise.</L>
<L>How shall she bear a Conqu'ror, who before</L>
<L>No equal, thro' the Grove, in Musick bore?</L>
<L>She droops, and hangs her flagging Wings, and moans,</L>
<L>And fetches from her Breast melodious Groans.</L>
<L>Oppress'd with Grief at last, too great to quell,</L>
<L>Down Breathless on the guilty Harp she fell.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="545"/>Then <HI>Colin</HI> loud lamented o'er the Dead,</L>
<L>And unavailing Tears profusely shed,</L>
<L>And broke his wicked Strings, and curs'd his Skill;</L>
<L>And, best to make Atonement for the ill,</L>
<L>(If for such Ill Atonement might be made)</L>
<L>He builds her Tomb beneath a Laurel Shade:</L>
<L>Then adds a Verse, and sets with Flow'rs the Ground,</L>
<L>And makes a Fence of winding Osiers round:</L>
<L>A Verse and Tomb is all I now can give,</L>
<L>And here thy Name at least, he said, shall live.</L>

<L>But who can tell the Joys of those that lye</L>
<L>Beneath the constant Influence of Her Eye!</L>
<L>Whilst in diffusive Show'rs Her Bounties fall,</L>
<L>Like Heav'ns Indulgence, and descend on All;</L>
<L>Secure the Happy, Succour the Distrest,</L>

<L>In the smooth Records of a faithful Verse;</L>
<L>That, if such Numbers can o'er Time prevail,</L>
<L>May tell Posterity the wond'rous Tale.</L>
<L>When Actions, unadorn'd, are faint and weak,</L>
<L>Cities and Countries must be taught to speak:</L>
<L>Gods may descend in Factions from the Skies,</L>
<L>And Rivers from their Oozy Beds arise:</L>
<L>Fiction may deck the Truth with spurious Rays,</L>
<L>And round the Heroe cast a borrow'd Blaze.</L>
<L><HI>MARLBRO</HI>'s Exploits appear divinely bright,</L>

<LG>
<L>NOrthward a County lyes (in which does stand,</L>
<L>The Second City of the <HI>English</HI> Land)</L>
<L>With which no <HI>Nation</HI> underneath the Sky,</L>
<L>Can for Horse-stealers, and Attorneys vie:</L>
<L>And if 'tis hard t' imagin, which is worse,</L>
<L>To <HI>steal</HI> a Gelding, or to <HI>take</HI> a Purse.</L>
<L>Why only to the better of the two,</L>
<L>Gibbets and Halters does the Law allow;</L>
<L>And let the more rapacious Villains live,</L>
<L>Securely cozen, multiply, and thrive;</L>
<L>Yet has, to hang 'em, a twofold Pretence,</L>
<L>Both in Mankind's, and in its own defence?</L>
<L><HI>One</HI> from this monstrous Herd I'll single out,</L>
<L>(The greatest Villain of 'em all, no doubt)</L>
<L>One surely destin'd never to do good,</L>
<L>A Scandal to the Scandalous Brotherhood;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="569"/>The vilest, wicked'st, most <HI>corrupted Limb</HI>,</L>
<L>All Roguery's epitomiz'd in him:</L>
<L>Of Villanie's highest, but Birth's lowest Rank;</L>
<L><HI>Sordid</HI> by Nature, tho' his Name be <HI>Frank;</HI></L>
<L>A Piece so spurious, infamous, and base,</L>
<L>Heralds cou'd never his Forefathers trace:</L>
<L>And if his Life like other Men's began,</L>
<L>His Birth's beyond the Memory of Man.</L>
<L>Whether, when young, he dropt from out the Moon,</L>
<L>(As wiser <HI>Woodcocks</HI> (some believe) have done;</L>
<L>And many able <HI>Antiquaries</HI> say,</L>
<L>He came undoubtedly the <HI>Milky-way</HI>)</L>
<L>Or some ignoble, lousie Footman's Whore,</L>
<L>Unwisely laid him at a <HI>Poor-man</HI>'s Door;</L>
<L>Is of no great Importance to be known,</L>
<L>Since him an Hospitable <HI>Pair</HI> did own,</L>
<L>Or for their natural, or adopted Son;</L>
<L>Sent him (<HI>tho' late</HI>) with his Horn-book to <HI>Y—k</HI>,</L>
<L>(Where th'one sold Cheese and Butter, t'other Beef and Pork.)</L>
<L>Lastly, instead of beating Hemp and Straw,</L>
<L>Put him to thrash far less relenting Law,</L>

<L>Whom Nature had design'd to hold the <HI>Plow</HI>.</L>
<L>Vast change of outward <HI>hue!</HI> and yet, 'tis plain,</L>
<L>He might take any Colour, that was <HI>Rogue in grain</HI>.</L>
<L>Apprenticeship he serv'd, and then began</L>
<L>To work Law-business as a <HI>Journey-man</HI>;</L>
<L>By which he only earn'd his <HI>Meat</HI>, but chose</L>
<L>Far viler Ways to get him <HI>Drink</HI> and, <HI>Cloaths</HI>.</L>
<L><HI>Pallister</HI>'s <HI>Coat</HI> feloniously did take,</L>
<L>When Cloath's were somewhat wanting to his <HI>Back</HI>.</L>
<L>And when good Drink was to his <HI>Belly</HI> due,</L>
<L>He that great Happiness did thus pursue:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="570"/>In filthy Puddle like a Swine, he dived,</L>

<L>Was both the leanest, and the least of all:</L>

<L>But <HI>M—ley</HI> gave him many a purging Dose:</L>
<L>For which ('tis thought) he ne'er a penny saw,</L>
<L>But took it out in Pennyworth's of Law.</L>
<L>These were his <HI>ways</HI> of Living, 'till at last,</L>
<L>Sir <HI>William</HI>, pitying the Wretch, him grac'd,</L>

<L>A more unworthy, or ungrateful <HI>Hound</HI>.</L>

<L>And (what few Hypocrites have done before)</L>
<L><HI>Blasphemes</HI>, and <HI>Worships</HI>, in the self-same Hour.</L>
<L>At Ev'ning Pray'rs the Wretch, with Wine unman'd,</L>

<L><PB N="6" REF="571"/>But when the Morning does his Sence recall,</L>

<L>Drinking and Whoring rule the Night, the Day</L>
