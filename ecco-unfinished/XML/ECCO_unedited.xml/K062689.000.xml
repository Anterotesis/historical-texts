<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THis small Treatise is only levell'd against those
Opera's which are entirely Musical; for those
which are Drammatical may be partly defended by
the Examples of the Ancients. We have endeavour'd
to shew in the following Treatise, that the English Stage
is like to be overthrown by the Progress of these new
Opera's; it would be easie here to shew the Importance
of that Stage to the Publick: That People must and will
have Diversions, and that a great and flourishing Peo∣ple
will have publick Diversions, that if the Govern∣ment
does not take care to provide reasonable Diversions
for them, they will not fail to provide such for them∣selves
as are without Reason. That unreasonable ones
are pernicious to Government, and that reasonable ones
are advantagious to it; that pleasure of Sense being
too much indulged, makes Reason cease to be a Pleasure,
and by consequence is contrary both to publick and pri∣vate
Duty. That the Drama of all reasonable Diver∣sions
is the best that has ever been invented at once
to delight and instruct the World, that it has never
flourish'd but in Three or Four of the bravest Nations
that have been since the World began, and that in the
most flourishing States of those Nations, and that
<PB REF="3"/>
a People must have a very good share of Virtue as well
at Understanding before they can receive it among them,
that it is so very agreeable to good Government, that most
of the great Men who have writ of the Art of Govern∣ing,
from <HI>Plato</HI> down to <HI>Harrington,</HI> have writ
either Plays or Directions, or Rules for the Stage.
That some of the greatest Monarchs and greatest Mi∣nisters
of State have not only encourag'd Plays, but
have writ them themselves; that some of the greatest
Philosophers have done the same, that here in <HI>England</HI>
indeed Two or Three formal affected Bigots have en∣deavour'd
to contradict all these and the common Sense
of Men, and upon a pretence of making all Men good
Christians, which Christ and his Apostles have so often
told us never will be, have actually made Thousands
ten times worse than they would have been without them.
That the consequence of their Writings has been, that
Plays have been for some Years discourag'd, and Diver∣sions
establish'd in the room of them, that have really
been and are like to be ten times more prejudicial to the
Publick than ever Plays were pretended to be. That
one of those Diversions has been gaming, which has done
unspeakable harm to bath Sexes in every part of the
Town: That gaming, since the publishing the Books
against the Stage has increas'd Ten-fold, and that the
number of Bankrupts during that time has been as much
augmented; that the number of Cuckolds in all likely∣hood
has advanced proportionably; That gaming, by
<PB REF="4"/>
giving Men a privilege to be familiar with, and
sometimes rude to Women, removes that awe which
Nature has plac'd between the Sexes as the strongest
Bulwark of Chastity; that when a young Lady ev'n
of the strictest and most unblemish'd Honour, looses a
Summ of Money, which she dares not own to her Re∣lations,
and which she cannot pay without them, and
looses it to a young agreeable Fellow, who perhaps loves
her, and has a secret Design upon her, she finds a
Temptation that tries her utmost Virtue.</P>
<P>We have endeavour'd to shew in the following Trea∣tise,
by the force of Reason, that the <HI>Italian Opera,</HI>
another Entertainment, which is about to be establish'd
in the room of Plays, is a Diversion of more pernicious
consequence, than the most licentious Play that ever has
appear'd upon the Stage. It would be no hard matter
to support those Proofs by the Authorities of some of the
most celebrated Authors among the Ancients and Mo∣derns,
but we shall content our selves with that of
<HI>Boileau,</HI> because he is equally fam'd for Judgment
and Sincerity, excepting Matters in which his King is
concern'd, and is known by all the World to be perfectly
Master of the Subject. Let us see then what this ce∣lebrated
Author, who has approv'd of Plays, in so so∣lemn
and publick a manner, says in relation to Opera's.
The Passage is in his Tenth Satyr, which is writ
by way of Letter to a Friend to advise him not
to marry.</P>

<HEAD>Which is thus in English.</HEAD>
<P>The Wife of whom thou art about to make choice, having been
hitherto unblemish;d in her Conduct, and brought up, as they tell
us within Port Royal, in the Practice of every Virtue, regulates
her Passions by Reasons severe Rule; but who can assure thee that
she will still remain victorious over Pleasure, and still preserve her
original Innocence, when thou hast once made her Mistress of her
own Conduct? As soon as she is usher'd by her Uxorious Husband
to the Opera, with what Air dost thou think the young Saint will
behold the Harmonious Pomp of an enchanting Spectacle, those
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anton Dances, those Heroes with luxurious Voices? With what
Air dost thou think she will listen to a Discourse that rowls upon
<PB REF="6"/>
Love alone, to those mad Orlandos, and those melting Rinaldo's;
hearing from them that we ought to sacrifice all, nay, ev'n Virtue
itself, to Love, as to the only supreme Divinity; that we can never
suffer our selves to take Fire too soon, that bounteous Heaven has
bestow'd a Heart upon us only that we might love; and all those
common places of slippery Morals, to which <HI>Lully</HI> has given fresh
Fire by the Charms of his Musick. Then how will she be melted,
how transported, how will every Sense be shaken in her? I dare not
assure thee, that as she comes back, throwing off that Awe which
has hitherto been a restraint upon her, and having all her Soul
possest with those melting Sounds, she does not instantly withdraw
to some convenient Retirement, and with some young Medoro bring
these fine Speculations to practise. Yet let us suppose for once, that
she comes back as faithful and chast as she went from this dange∣rous
Shock, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nothing can be fuller than this Passage of <HI>Boileau;</HI>
we could easily make it appear that <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI>
are of the same Opinion, but what need can there be
of Authorities, when we can shew by experience what
Influence the soft and effeminate Measures of the
<HI>Italian Opera</HI> has upon the Minds and Manners of
Men. The Modern Italians have the very same Sun
and Soil which the Antient Romans had, yet are their
Manners directly opposite; their Men are neither Ver∣tuous,
nor Wise, nor Valiant, and they who have rea∣son
to know their Women, never trust them out of their
sight. 'Tis impossible to give any reason of so great a
Difference between the Ancient Romans, and the
Modern Italians but only Luxury, and the Reigning
Luxury of <HI>Modern Italy,</HI> is that soft and effeminate
Musick which abounds in the <HI>Italian Opera.</HI> And
if Musick of the same Nature has not as yet had the
<PB REF="7"/>
same Influence on <HI>France,</HI> it is because the French
Musick is by no means so meltingly moving as the
Italian, and that the effect of the Charm has been in
some measure retarded by the whole Nation's having
been in Arms for so many Tears together.</P>
<P>There is one Observation which naturally occurs
here, and with which we shall conclude this Pre∣face;
and that is, that the Alterations which have
been made in the Entertainment of the Stage for these
last Ten Years, seem to have had some influence
ev'n upon common Society. For as Sense upon the
Stage seems to have given place to Sound, the same
thing appears to have happen'd in familiar Conversa∣tion,
which is reduc'd to such a Level among all sorts
of People, as perhaps never was known in the World
before. For go where you will, either among Citts
or Courtiers, among Men of Sense or Blockheads, the
Conversation rolls most upon Two Points, which are
News and Toasting. Now this is certain, that a
very solemn dull Fool makes a very pretty News∣monger;
and a very empty, errant Coxcomb, a very
accomplish'd Toaster.</P>

<PB N="1" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>Essay on the Opera's.</HEAD>
<P>THere appears to have been of late Years, a Com∣bination
of all sorts of People, to set up Opera's,
and Entertainments of Singing and Dancing
in the room of Dramatick Poems. At a time
when we are contending with our Enemies for our ve∣ry
Being; we are aukwardly Aping their Luxuries and
their Vices, which we neglected or contemn'd while
we were at full Peace with them; as if by a certain
foreboding Delusion we were preparing our selves for
Slavery, and endeavouring to make our selves agreeable
to our new Masters.</P>
<P>But that so many People of great Quality, and of
greater Parts, Lovers of their Country, and Encoura∣gers
of Art, and of Poetry more particularly, should
prove so zealous in the encouraging and promoting
Entertainments, which tend so directly to the Detri∣ment
of the Publick, to the Detriment of Arts, and
especially of expiring Poetry; Entertainments which
are so directly contrary to their Nobler Pleasures, and
their real Interests, can proceed from nothing but from
that Weight of Affairs which oppresses them, and de∣prives
them of time and leisure to consider deliberate∣ly
of these things.</P>
<P>There is no Man living, who has either a higher
esteem than my self for their natural and acquir'd En∣dowments,
or a greater Veneration for their restless
Endeavours to promote the real good of their Country
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
in all other things. And I depend upon those great
Qualities, upon their exquisite Discernment, their exact
Justice, and their magnanimous Spirit of Liberty, when
I presume to oppose a popular and prevailing Caprice, and
to defend the English Stage, which together with our
English Liberties has descended to us from our Ance∣stors,
to defend it against that Deluge of Mortal Foes,
which have come pouring in from the Continent, to
drive out the Muses, its Old Inhabitants, and seat
themselves in their stead; that while the English Arms
are every where Victorious abroad, the English Arts
may not be vanquish'd and oppress'd at home by the In∣vasion
of Foreign Luxury.</P>
<P>There is no Man living who is more convinc'd than
my self of the Power of Harmony, or more penetra∣ted
by the Charms of Musick. I know very well that
Musick makes a considerable Part both of Eloquence
and of Poetry; and therefore to endeavour to decry it
fully, would be as well a foolish, as an ungrateful
Task, since the very efforts which we should make
against it, would only serve to declare its Excellence,
it being impossible to succeed in them, but by supplies
which we should borrow from its own Harmony. Mu∣sick
may be made profitable as well as delightful, if it
is subordinate to some nobler Art, and subservient to
Reason; but if it presumes not only to degenerate
from its ancient Severity, from its sacred Solemnity,
but to set up for itself, and to grow independant, as it
does in our late Opera's, it becomes a meer sensual
Delight, utterly incapable of informing the Under∣sanding,
or of reforming the Will; and for that very
Reason utterly unfit to be made a publick Diversion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and then the more charming it grows, it becomes the
more pernicious. Since when it is once habitual, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
must so far debauch the Minds of Men, as to make them
incapable of those reasonable Diversions, which have
got the just Possession of the Stage.</P>
<P>Thus unless we use timely Prevention, the British
Muse is like to meet with the same Fate that <HI>Tithonus</HI>
is said to have done of old, who had no other Fruit of
his Immortality, than to see himself depriv'd by the
length of Days, of all his Strength, his Spirit, and his
Tow'ring Thoughts, and eaten and consum'd by the
Jaws of Time, till nothing remain'd of him but an
empty Voice.</P>
<P>'Tis undeniable, that in whatever Countries Opera's
have been establish'd after the manner of <HI>Italy,</HI> they
have driven out Poetry from among that People. 'Tis
now more than a Hundred Years since the very species
of Poets has disappear'd in <HI>Italy;</HI> and at present there
is not so much as one Poet in so vast a Kingdom as
<HI>France,</HI> allowing <HI>Boileau</HI> to be superannuated.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this War, we were perhaps the
only People in <HI>Europe,</HI> who could justly boast of Free∣dom
or of Poetry. We have indeed very bravely de∣fended
our Liberties, but we have at the same time
abandon'd our Poetry to the very Nations who have
attack'd the other, and by I know not what Whimsey
of Fate, while in the Field we have been knocking
their braved Men on the Head, we have been cares∣sing
and hugging the Off-scowring of them at home.</P>
<P>That Poetry is like from the Progress of Musick, to
have the same Fate in <HI>England,</HI> that it met with in
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> we have very good reason to believe,
when we consider that of late Years, they who have
had some Talent for writing, have, for the most part,
still writ worse and worse, and when that which has
been well writ, has been worse received by our Au∣diences;
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
when those Audiences will hardly suffer a Play,
that is not interlarded with Singing and Dancing,
whereas these are become Theatrical Entertainments,
without any thing of the Drama, when our People of
Quality utterly neglecting English Comedy and Trage∣dy,
give such Encouragement to Italian Musick, that if
they gave but the like to the proper Entertainments
of the Stage, the English would infallibly excell both
Ancients and Moderns.</P>
<P>That this Alteration in the Writers and Audiences
is to be ascrib'd to the Progress of Musick, rather than
attributed to any unknown Cause, or imputed to Fan∣cy,
or the Inconstancy of the People, we shall now
very clearly shew.</P>
<P>Man is so very Fantastical a Creature, that perhaps
he owes his best and his worthiest Actions to what may
be properly called his Weakness, that is, to his Vanity,
or his Love of Glory. For tho' that depends upon an
Opinion of Excellence, which is almost always false,
and is therefore truly a Weakness, yet it gives the Mind
a Force, an Elevation and an Enthusiasm, which it has
not without it, and which make it capable of quite other
things than it was before. Now the greater the Action
is that any one designs, the more is requir'd of so impe∣tuous
a Motive to execute it; but the writing a Tragedy,
or an Epick Poem, being perhaps the greatest thing that
a Man can design, and it being impossible to succeed in
Poetry without Enthusiasm, the Epick, the Tragick,
and indeed all Poets who aspire to the greater Poetry,
have occasion for so enthusiastick a Motive as the Love of
Glory; if they write with any other view than to be
praised, than to be admired, they must certainly write
contemptibly, nay, they ought to propose to themselves
to raise their Reputations equal to the first of Men, to
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
place themselves among the Benefactors of Mankind,
and rank their Glory with the deathless Fame of the
Heroes whom they celebrate. But that this Vanity may
be nourish'd and supported in them, they must actually
find themselves prais'd by the best of Men, and meet with
an Admiration equal to the Idea which they conceive of
their Labours. But if either that Praise is wanting, or
if it is shar'd by the Professors of inferior or illiberate
Arts; if upon the very Stage the Capital of the Muses
<HI>Dominion,</HI> and the Poets <HI>Domain,</HI> not only Composers, but
ev'n Singers and Dancers, meet with greater Applause,
and greater Encouragement, what wonder if their
Pride is immediately mortify'd, and their Fire extin∣guish'd.</P>
<P>Thus Musick has caus'd so great a Change in our Wri∣ters,
because it has wrought so great a one in our Au∣diences,
and it will certainly work a greater in both if it
goes on Triumphantly; for the generality of our Au∣diences
are far more capable of a Pleasure of Sense than
of a Delight of Reason. Now Musick that is not sub∣servient
to Reason, especially if it be soft and effeminate,
is a meer Delight of Sense; and as some body has ob∣serv'd
that Friendship grows insipid to those who have
tasted of Love, it grows exceeding difficult, ev'n for those
who are capable of the severe Delights of Reason to make
a pleasing Return to them, if they have at any time
left them for the bewitching Pleasure of Sense. Man
naturally pursues Pleasure and flies from Pain, and en∣deavours
to be happy at as little Expence as he can, and
therefore the Delights of Sense are preferred to reasona∣ble
Pleasures, because the Soul takes in the first without
any effort, but the last require severe Preparation, or at
the least Attention. In short, if 'tis so hard to part
with sensual Pleasurer, after they are once become ha∣bitual,
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
tho' all a Man's Interest and his whole Reputation
require it, how much more difficult must it be, when
these two powerful Motives are wanting.</P>
<P>Perhaps too the Pride and Vanity that is in Mankind,
may determine the generality to give into Musick at
the expence of Poetry. Men love to enjoy their Plea∣sures
entirely, and not to have them restrain'd by Awe,
or curb'd by Mortification. Now there are but few
judicious Spectators at our Dramatick Representations,
since none can be so, but who with great Endowments
of Nature have had a very generous Education, and the
rest are frequently mortify'd by passing foolish Judg∣ments;
but in Musick the Case is vastly different, to
judge of that requires only Use and a fine Ear, which
the Footman often has a great deal finer than his Ma∣ster.
In short, a Man without common Sense may very
well judge of what a Man writes without common Sense,
and without common Sense composes.</P>
<P>Since then we have made it appear so plainly, that
by introducing Entertainments of meer Musick among
us, we must of necessity banish Poetry; let us now en∣quire
of what consequence the doing that must be to
the Reputation and the Interest of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Interest and Reputation of any Nation con∣sists
in Power, as Power consists in the Wisdom, Num∣bers,
and Spirit of the People, but the chiefest of these
i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Spirit, since that is capable of making the other
two, but without that the other two are of no signi∣ficancy.</P>
<P>Now publick Spirit includes two things, Zeal and
Affection, for the Honour and Interest of ones Coun∣try,
and Courage and Resolution to put any thing in
Practice that may promote its Service or Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="14"/>
Now if we can shew that Poetry augments this Spi∣rit
where-ever it finds it, and sometimes begets it where
it was not before, and that meer Musick, such as is that
of our Opera's, is so far from begetting this Spirit where
it was not before, or from augmenting it where it meets
with it, that it has a natural tendency to the diminishing
it, and destroying it, then I hope it will be readily gran∣ted,
that since publick Entertainments of meer Musick
and Poetry are incompatible, and that we must banish
one and retain the other, it will be reasonable to banish
the Opera and not Poetry.</P>
<P>If the Entertainment which we have from our Opera's
is a meer sensual Pleasure, which says nothing either to
enlighten the Understanding or to convert the Will, it
is impossible to conceive, how it can either raise the Pas∣sions
to correct them, or infuse generous sentiments into
the Soul, to exalt and confirm the Reason, or to inspire
publick Spirit, and publick Virtue, and elevated notions
of Liberty.</P>
<P>It belongs to Poetry only, to teach publick Virtue
and publick Spirit, and a noble contempt of Death,
with an Expression and with an Air becoming of its
God-like Notions. That alone can worthily tell Man∣kind
that we were not born for our selves; that we
were fram'd and contriv'd for Society by an All-wise
Maker; and that the greatest of Men are Miserable if
they are long in Solitude. That so great is the sym∣pathy
of Souls, that it is impossible for a thinking Man
to be Happy, but in the common Felicity of his Fellow
Creatures; that He who never did any thing to pro∣mote
that, never felt perfect Pleasure; that Man has
infinitely more Pleasure, ev'n of Sense, from those acts
by which he maintains his Species, than he has from
those by which he preserves himself. What Raptures
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
of mind must those Heroes feel, whose Virtue has been
the preserver of Nations, and made a World Happy?
That great Minds bravely contemn Death to further that
Felicity; that Fate is unavoidable to Mankind, and that
Thirty, Forty, Fifty Years is so very much nothing
in the view of a comprehensive Soul, that a Hero must
esteem it wiser as well as nobler, rather than languish∣ingly
to expect Death, to go out and meet him for the
publick good, and so to make a sublime Virtue ev'n of
the last necessity: That what we call Life here is not pro∣perly
the Hero's Life, that almost half of it is pass'd in
absolute Death, and the rest in Desire, in Grief, in Love,
in Rage, in Pain. And that the bright and eternal
Fame, to which great Minds aspire, is never fully attain'd
to here; that the Names of the greatest Heroes are cir∣cumscrib'd
by narrow bounds both of time and space;
and that their best and their bravest Actions, are mistaken
and misinterpreted by some, ev'n of those who have the
fortune to hear of them, that they are traduced by others
envyed by more, that that is properly the Hero's Life,
when set free from these mortal Bonds, he shall arrive at
that blissful Mansion which is on purpose prepar'd for
those illustrious Souls, who by making it their business
here below to do good to their Country and Mankind,
have practis'd the noblest and most extensive Charity that
divinest Poets can teach or God Himself can inspire; that
there they shall enjoy a Life, which shall be for ever set
free from Death, there their Happiness shall far surpass
ev'n what the Heart of Man can conceive, and their
Glory transcend ev'n their own aspiring Wishes.</P>
<P>These Godlike Sentiments exalted Poetry instills into
Mankind, and by infusing these inspires us with a Zeal
and Affection for our Country's Service, and with a ge∣nerous
contempt of Death in time of the publick Dan∣ger.
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
And as there is no other principle of humane
Action but Sentiment, it is wholly impossible but that a
People habituated to these Heroick Notions must be pre∣par'd
and form'd for the performing Heroick Actions.</P>
<P>These unspeakable advantages has lofty Poetry over
empty sounds, and harmonious trifles, which, as the
pleasure that they give us is a sensual Delight, utterly in∣dependant
of Reason, must do something directly opposite
to this, since 'tis natural to sense to bring a Man home to
himself, and confine him there, as 'tis natural to Reason
to expand the Soul, if I may have leave to use the expres∣sion,
and throw it out upon the Publick: And as soft and
delicious Musick by soothing the Senses, and making a
Man too much in Love with himself, makes him too lit∣tle
fond of the publick, so by emasculating and dissolving
the mind, it shakes the very foundation of Fortitude,
and so is destructive of both branches of the publick
Spirit.</P>
<P>But if any one objects that an Opera may be so con∣triv'd
and Writ, as to inspire us with an affection for the
Publick, and with a generous contempt of Death; to
him I answer, that an Opera so design'd, must be writ
with force or without it. If 'tis writ with force 'tis in∣compatible
with Musick, especially in so masculine a Lan∣guage
as ours; for force in our Language cannot be ex∣prest
without a great many Consonants, and Words that
terminate in Consonants, but a great many Consonants
and especially Consonants terminating Words, cannot be
pronounced without very frequently shutting the mouth,
which is diametrically opposite to the expressing of Mu∣sick.</P>
<P>But if an Opera so design'd is not writ with force, I
leave it to any one to judge, whether the weakness of the
expression and of the sentiments, are like to make Im∣pression
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
enough to work any change in the Souls of an
Audience; or if they are not like to be wholly lost in the
softness of luscious sounds; or if the mind is fit to attend
to its duty, while the whole Man is dissolv'd in the wan∣tonness
of effeminate Airs.</P>
<P>After what has been said, I appeal to any Lover of his
Country, if Poetry which begets a publick Spirit, ought
to be banish'd for Musick which destroys it, which as it
corrupts Mankind has a natural tendency to the Inslaving
them; and indeed where-ever Opera's have been a con∣stant
Entertainment they have been attended with slave∣ry.
We are at present contending for Liberty, and hard
is the Contention, and the event doubtful, and we can∣not
so much as hope to succeed, but by the Virtue of that
magnanimous Spirit, which Poetry exalts, and which
effeminate Musick debases.</P>
<P>I know not by what Fate it has happen'd, that when
in some late Reigns, in which Arbitrary Pow'r was the
thing that was aim'd at, the Stage the Protector of Liber∣ty
was chiefly encourag'd, in a Reign like this which De∣signs
and Breaths forth nothing but Liberty; Pleasures
should be encourag'd ev'n by Lovers of Liberty,
which are Independant of Reason, and tend to nothing
but Slavery. A long experience has told us, that what
My Lord <HI>Roscommon</HI> has said in his Essay on translated
Verse is true.</P>
<Q><L>True Poets are the Guardians of a State,</L>
<L>And when they fail portend approaching Fate.</L>
<L>For that which <HI>Rome</HI> to Conquest did inspire,</L>
<L>Was not the Vestal but the Muses Fire;</L>
<L>Heav'n Joyns the Blessings, no declining Age</L>
<L>E're felt the Raptures of Poetick Rage.</L></Q>
<P>The Declension of Poetry in <HI>Greece</HI> and Ancient <HI>Rome</HI>
was soon follow'd by that of Liberty and Empire. And
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
the very Spirit of Prophesie, which was the Spirit of He∣brew
Poetry, departing from the Jews in the Babylonish
Captivity, was a fatal Omen that Liberty and Empire
were never to flourish more with them.</P>
<P>That the Declension of Poetry should portend the fall
of Empire is not without very good Reason. Because it
shews a slackning of the publick Spirit, and an increase
of universal Corruption, which prepares the Fate of
Empires, as a spreading mortification fore-runs the Fate
of Men. If a Poet is not admir'd, tho' the Man may
live, the Spirit of the Poet dies, but a People to admire
those generous Sentiments which abound in Poetry, must
at least have something in them that answers to them:
If they once grow wholly immerst and sunk in Pleasures
of sense, those elevated Notions appear as so many Li∣bels
upon them, and their sickly Souls either turn away
from them, or very feebly answer to them. In short,
where-ever there is either the Love of Liberty or the Love
of Glory, a true Poet may well be admir'd, and in how
wretched a condition must the Nation be where both
those Qualities are wanting. From what has been said
'tis manifest that it behoves us to think, before we fully
resolve upon banishing so useful an Entertainment as that
of the <HI>Drama,</HI> for the pernicious Amusement of Opera's.</P>
<P>The <HI>Drama</HI> was establish'd here in <HI>England</HI> at the same
time with Reformation and Liberty: For the <HI>Drama</HI> was
set up in the Reign of Qu. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in whose Reign the
Reformation was fully establish'd, and before which the
People of <HI>England,</HI> for Reasons too long to be Inserted
here, could hardly be said to be entirely free. As the
<HI>Drama</HI> came in with them, it has flourish'd with them,
and gone a good way towards the supporting that Spirit
of Liberty on which the Reformation depends. It would
here be easie to make an odd Remark, and that is, that
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
the <HI>Drama</HI> had never like to have fall'n, but that and Li∣berty
stumbled almost together.</P>
<P>In the time of the late Civil Wars, when the Bigo∣try
of Hypocritical Zeal had once suppress'd our Theatres,
a Military Government soon follow'd, which is the
worst or Slaveries.</P>
<P>And when in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II, upon the
breaking out of the Popish Plot, the Theatres were both
abandon'd, it was not long before all the Charters were
surrender'd.</P>
<P>And yet tho' the Reformation and Liberty and the
Drama were establish'd among us together, and have
flourish'd among us together, and have still been like
to have fall'n together; notwithstanding all this, at this
present Juncture, when Liberty, and the Reformation
are in the utmost Danger, we are going very bravely to
oppress the Drama, in order to establish the luxurious
Diversions of those very Nations, from whose Attempts
and Designs both Liberty and the Reformation are in
the utmost Danger.</P>
<P>That so unhappy a Change will be as little conducive
to the Glory of <HI>England,</HI> as it will be to its Interest, is
not in the least to be doubted; for what must those
Strangers say who arrive among us, if they have any
taste, when they behold a People so lofty, so fierce,
and formerly so famous for their Contempt of Foreign
Manners, forgetting their old Pride to so strange a de∣gree,
that very Pride by which they have so long main∣tain'd
their Liberties, to imitate the prodigious Luxury
of <HI>Italy</HI> with an awkward and vile Imitation, and some
Men of the greatest Parts in the Kingdom, applauding
and encouraging that vile Imitation with all their In∣dustry
and all their Diligence, and in order to that dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountenancing
instructive Comedy, in which the En∣glish
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
excel Mankind, and neglecting the most noble and
most beneficial of all Entertainments, Tragedy; in
which Nature has qualify'd us to excel all the Moderns.</P>
<P>What must those Strangers say, when they behold
Englishmen applaud an Italian for Singing, or a French∣man
for Dancing, and the very Moment afterwards ex∣plode
an Englishman for the very same things? What
must they say, unless they have Candour enough to in∣terpret
it this way, that an Englishman is deservedly
scorned by Englishmen, when he descends so far be∣neath
himself, as to Sing or to Dance in publick, be∣cause
by doing so he practises Arts which Nature has
bestow'd upon effeminate Nations, but denied to him,
as below the Dignity of his Country, and the Majesty
of the British Genius.</P>
<P>What must those Strangers say, when they see that
we leave so reasonable and so instructive an Entertain∣ment
as Tragedy, for one so pernicious and so extreme∣ly
absurd; for there is something in the Italian Opera,
which is Barbarous and Gothick, and so contrary to a
true Taste, that an Opera in any Country can be only
advanc'd by the same Degrees that the Taste of Men is
debauch'd for more generous Arts. Thus in <HI>Italy,</HI>
where an Opera is most advanc'd, there is no one who
can write either Verse or Prose, nor any one who can
judge of them. For when once the Italians were fal'n
so low, as to prefer Sound to Sense, they quickly grew
to write such Sense that Sound deserv'd to be preferr'd
to it.</P>
<P>If that is truly the most Gothick, which is the most
oppos'd to Antick, nothing can be more Gothick than
an Opera, since nothing can be more oppos'd to the an∣cient
Tragedy, than the modern Tragedy in Musick,
because the one is reasonable, the other ridiculous;
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
the one is artful, the other absurd; the one beneficial,
the other pernicious; in short, the one natural, and the
other monstrous. And the modern Tragedy in Musick,
is as much oppos'd to the Chorus, which is the Musi∣cal
part of the Ancient Tragedy, as it is to the <HI>Episodique;</HI>
because in the Chorus the Musick is always great and
solemn, in the Opera 'tis often most trifling and most
effeminate; in the Chorus the Musick is only for the sake
of the Sense, in the Opera the Sense is most apparently
for the sake of the Musick.</P>
<P>When I affirm that an Opera after the Italian Man∣ner
is monstrous, I cannot think that I deal too severely
with it; no not tho' I add, that it is so prodigiously
unnatural, that it could take its beginning from no
Country, but that which is renowned throughout the
World, for preferring monstrous abominable Pleasures
to those which are according to Nature.</P>
<P>But yet this must be allow'd, that tho' the Opera in
<HI>Italy</HI> is a Monster, 'tis a beautiful harmonious Monster,
but here in <HI>England</HI> 'tis an ugly howling one. What
then must not only Strangers, but we our selves say,
with all our Partiality to our selves, when we consider
that we not only leave a reasonable Entertainment for
a ridiculous one, an artful one for an absurd one, a be∣neficial
one for a destructive one, and a very natural
one for one that is very monstrous; but that we for∣sake
a most noble Art, for succeeding in which we are
perhaps the best qualify'd of any Peeple in <HI>Europe,</HI> for a
very vile one for which Heaven and Nature have not
at all design'd us, as having given us, neither Ears, nor
Voices, nor Languages, nor Climate proper to it. <HI>En∣gland</HI>
may certainly with a little Encouragement pro∣duce
the greatest Tragick Poets in <HI>Europe,</HI> but there is
scarce one Nation in the Christian World, but is quali∣fy'd
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
to surpass us in Opera's, since they are almost all sci∣tuated
under a serener Sky.</P>
<P>If a private Man who mistakes his Talent, and applies
himself to things, for which neither God nor Nature
have qualify'd him, does by that very choice deface all
his good Qualities, and render himself contemptible to
the World, how much more dishonourable must it be
for a whole Nation?</P>
<P>As all Kingdoms that are in different Latitudes, have
Plants with very different Properties, so have they Na∣tives
with very different Talents. If any Yeoman of
<HI>Kent</HI> or <HI>Sussex,</HI> should neglect to sow his Wheat or his
Barley, should grub up his Fruit Trees, and demolish
his Hop Grounds, and fall a planting the Olive of Lucca,
the Orange of Naples, and the Muscatello of Monte-Fiascone,
or of Mont-Alchin; what would his Neigh∣bours
think of such a Proceeding? And yet that Person
would plainly aspire in his choice. What then, must
not the French and Italians think of us, who despise the
most generous Productions of our own Minds, and indeed
of the Mind of Man, for the vilest of theirs of which we
are not capable. Let us take heed, that as we have ta∣ken
the Opera from the Nations which we despise, it
renders us not contemptible to those very Nations.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>SInce the Printing of this Essay, I have been inform'd
by very good Hands, that a young Lady of the
first Quality, equally famous for her Beauty, her Spirit,
and her Virtue, did lately to the Glory of her own Sex,
and the Shame of ours, give very strict Order, that
the <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> which was acted at her
Request, should be done without any Performance ei∣ther
of Singing or Dancing. Which Order has shewn
that she is as much distinguish'd by the Beauty of her
Mind, as by that of her Person; and as every Grace
has been always a constant Attendant on her, 'tis be∣come
the Duty of every Muse to wait on her, and to
return her Thanks for making way by her illustrious
Example, for the delivering English Poetry from the
Oppression of Foreign Luxury, as every Englishman is
bound to extol the Heroe from whom she sprung, for
lessening in English Hearts the Apprehension of Fo∣reign
Tyranny. I make no doubt but that her attra∣ctive
Example will have much more Influence upon the
World than these few Speculations, and raise a noble
Emulation in her Sex, and a just Confusion in ours.
May she be follow'd by every fair one, as <HI>Venus</HI> is by
the Graces, but after they have all in imitation of her,
combin'd to banish foreign Foppery from of the English
Stage, may the Glory of the Triumph be peculiarly
hers, who first so happily shew'd the way to conquer it,
as her illustrious Father will justly share in the Honour
of every Confederate General, because all Victories that
are to come will be influenc'd by that Immortal one,
which shew'd us first that the French are not Invincible.</P>
